Each consists of a domestic site dating to the Neolithic and Beaker periods and four produced extensive quantities of pottery, flint, stone and bone artefacts as well as evidence for houses. Two main forms of settlement are recognised. One is characterised by unprotected house sites of the type identified by O Riordain elsewhere on the peninsula; The subvention granted by University College, Dublin, towards the cost of publication of papers by members of its staff is gratefully acknowledged by the Royal Irish Academy. Proc.R.Ir.Acad. Vol. 87c, 299-506 (1987) [G7]</page><page sequence="2">300 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy the other consists of enclosed habitations. The latter were delimited by a substantial double-kerbed wall retaining a rubble and earth bank. The enclosures are in general circular encompassing an area ranging from 500m2 to 700m2 and well-defined entrances occurred. Evidence for centrally located houses came from three sites and there was a limited number of individual burials contemporary with the settlement. Three of the sites, including one which was of single-phase activity only, were enclosed during the Neolithic, while the walls at two other sites were constructed in the Beaker period. Domestic occupation continued into this period at some sites, and at one site the final phase is represented by a small quantity of Bowl food vessels. Limited activity occurred during the Later Bronze Age at Circle K while Circle J was used as a burial ground during the first millennium a.d. Two further excavations at Circles O and P to the east of the lake, for which little original documentation survived, are summarised. Clearly Lough Gur was an attractive location for prehistoric settlement. The Knockadoon peninsula, protected naturally by the lake, was an ideal focus for the exploitation of the surrounding landscape. Although the main period of prehistoric activity was towards the end of the Neolithic, the area continued to be used during the Bronze and Iron Ages and was again to become a centre of intensive settlement in the Early Christian and medieval periods. Introduction Professor Sean P. O Riordain commenced his campaign of excavations at Lough Gur in 1936 and with the exception of 1952-3, when he excavated Rath na Seanad at Tara, his excavations continued until 1954. During this lengthy period, O Riordain excavated a large number of sites, which varied in form, function and date (see p. 493). One of his most outstanding achievements was the recognition and investigation of several habitation sites of Neolithic/Beaker date on the Knockadoon peninsula. This work commenced in 1939 at Site A, and during subsequent seasons up to 1954 greater emphasis was placed on the settlement aspect of the archaeology of Lough Gur. In all, Professor 6 Riordain examined fourteen Neolithic/Beaker sites and in 1954 an extensive report on nine, A to I, was published in these Proceedings. He had been preparing for publication the remaining five sites but his untimely death on 11 April 1957 left the work unfinished. He had completed preliminary manuscript reports and an initial analysis of the finds as well as some ground plans and illustrations. The records were in the Department of Archaeology, University College, Dublin, where O Riordain had been Professor of Archaeology since 1943, and the finds were in the National Museum of Ireland. This report is based on the preliminary reports, the field notebooks, some excava tion drawings and the finds index and on a thorough examination and evaluation of the finds themselves. The surviving information on two other sites, Circles O and P, is also included as Appendix B. While this report has deficiencies, nevertheless we hope that it does some justice to the sites by making available to archaeological scholarship the results of the excavations and by highlighting 6 Riordain's work. Extensive as they were, the Neolithic/Beaker habitation investigations were only a part of his Lough Gur campaign, which in turn was just one aspect of his thorough and wide-ranging research. O Riordain's intensive study of the prehistoric settlement clearly demonstrates his innovative approach and commitment. The Lough Gur campaigns involved the detailed investigation of a defined area systematically planned over a long series of excavating seasons. Above all, O Riordain brilliantly perceived the potential of settlement archaeology and the relationship of settlement to its wider landscape and environmental context. In addition, he extended the known range of Neolithic settlement into Munster</page><page sequence="3">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 301 Pl. I ?Airview of Lough Gur from west. and, of equal if not greater importance, put Ireland on the Beaker 'map'. This is the final report of his Lough Gur excavations. We have benefited and learned much during the course of its preparation and hope that it can also be viewed as a small tribute to the achievements and inspiration of Sean P. O Riordain. His work has made enormous contributions to archaeological studies and forms a solid foundation on which further advancements can be built. This report deals with each excavation separately. As a sequence of activity was noted on four of the sites each phase or structural aspect is described individually, followed by the finds from that context. Where appropriate some discussion of the finds or structures has been inserted. A general discussion of the whole group and their local and wider contexts occurs at the end of the paper. A separate National Museum registration number has been allocated to the finds from each individual site in this report. These are as follows: E251 -Circle J E252-Circle K E253-Circle L E254-Site 10 E255-Site 12 E256-Circle P These prefixes are not included, except where appropriate, in the text or on the illustrations.</page><page sequence="4">00 o to Pl.

Where possible, dimensions of the vessels are provided and a reconstruction of the profile is illustrated. In no case was it feasible to reconstruct the vessels themselves. Colour definitions are based on the Munsell Soil Colour Chart and where a colour match was possible the reference number is provided. Circle J (Figs 1-9; Pis I-Xb) Three main phases of activity are represented on this site. The first, dating to the late Neolithic, is an unenclosed habitation. This was succeeded by a second phase during which the domestic site was enclosed by a double-kerbed wall. Long after its occupation role, Circle J was used as a burial ground in the late prehistoric/early historic period. This site is on the south-centre of the Knockadoon peninsula (Fig. 1, Pl. I; OS 6" Limerick sheet 32, 15.1cm from N, 17.9cm from W). It occupies a generally level natural platform. On the southern side the ground drops sharply towards the more gently graded lake shore and a similar slope occurs on the eastern and western sides. To the north is a corresponding rise towards the brow of the peninsula. Circle J is an enclosed habitation site. Before excavation the wall was clearly visible on the southern and western sides. At the north it appeared more as an earthen bank, and rock outcrop had been used to form part of the circumference in this area. The wall ceased completely to the east and the line of the circle was not evident. The enclosure has an average external diameter of c. 29m. A small standing stone occurs in the south-eastern quadrant. Excavation was carried out over two seasons in 1946 and 1947. A considerable portion of the interior was investigated, including all of the south-east quadrant (cuttings 1-4 and 6) with cutting through the wall to the north (7-9) and west (5) (Fig. 2). Two cuttings (10 and 11) were opened outside the enclosure to the north-east. All the cuttings were 3m wide except No. 1, which was 2m. The excavation grid was laid out with conventional north 33? west of true north. All descriptions, unless otherwise stated, refer to the orientation of the grid. A small excavation was carried out during the 1860s by J. Harkness, then Professor of Anatomy in University College, Cork (1869, 388-90; see below, pp 332-4). The site was designated J and described by Windle (1912, 297-9). Pre-enclosure activity The earliest phase of occupation took place before the construction of the enclosure wall. Owing to the considerable damage caused by the later use of the site as a cemetery (see below) this pre-enclosure occupation was only clearly identifiable where it extended under the wall itself. However, material derived from the pre-enclosure activity was contained throughout the fill of the wall, indicating that intensive occupation took place. Elsewhere post-holes and spreads of habitation material occurred on the old ground surface both inside and outside the circle but it was not possible to establish to which habitation phase they belonged. A large pit (1) and five post-holes (1-5) occurred under the wall on the south-eastern corner. The pit was nearly circular, 85cm in diameter and 20cm deep. Four of the post-holes (1-4) formed an arc around the pit and were 0.6m-1.5m from it. Post-hole 5 lay to the north of this arc and another example (6) occurred 2m to the west. The latter was not sealed under the wall but it was cut into the subsoil and may be associated. The post-holes were about 7cm in diameter and ranged in depth from 12cm to 25cm. An irregular spread of habitation material, 2.5m by 2m, was found to the north of this</page><page sequence="8">306 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy y^m^-y^ ,iM9: '?&amp;??. ??j?

It was 20cm beneath the level of the wall-facing, but the wall itself had been destroyed so it could not be shown conclusively that it was pre-enclosure. Post-hole 7 was sealed beneath it. The spread had been cut by burial 30. Isolated patches of similar material occurred to the north-east of the burial and 2m to the north-west at the foot of burial 29. These appear to be surviving portions of a more extensive habitation layer which covered this area before construction of the wall. The layer had an average depth of 10cm but tapered out in the northern area around burial 30.</page><page sequence="9">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 307 Finds (Figs 4, 6) These came from the pit (37-9), post-holes 1 (19, 63), 4 (20) and 8 (28, 35), the habitation layer in cuttings 3 and 6 (1-18, 21-7, 29-34, 36, 40-50, 53-5) and under the wall fill in cutting 4 (51-2, 56-62). Stone (Fig. 4). Fourteen pieces of flint and chert (1-8, 9a-c, 10-12) came from the habitation layer. Only three (10-12) were waste and of these No. 10 may have come from the same pebble as No. 3. Nos 1-2 are leaf-shaped bifacially worked arrowheads but only the upper portion of 2 survives. A single scraper (3) has fine working on two sides of a thin flake from the outer portion of a flint pebble. No. 4 is a knife, worked on both faces, and 5 and 6, which are worked along one edge, may be similar artefacts. No. 7 is a point, serrated on one long edge, 8 is a blade and 9a-c are fragments of blades; 9a has wear along one edge. The following materials were used: flint?1, 3, 5-6, 10; chert ?2, 4, 7-9c, 11-12. There are three small fragments of axeheads (13-15). No. 13 is from the faceted edge of an axe of which 15 may be a chip. No. 14 has a broad facet on the face and is rounded at both edges. Three small pieces of quartz crystal (16-18) came from this level. Only 16, which may have been an end scraper, is worked. Pottery. This area yielded forty-one sherds (22-62), most of them small and fragmentary, with little evidence of wear to the edges. Because of considerable later disturbance much of the pottery is poorly preserved, and only a small quantity is suitable for illustration. There are twenty-six sherds (22-47) of western neolithic ware (O Riordain's Class I) from a minimum of five vessels. Nos 22-3 are fragments of rims, possibly from the same vessel, flat-topped and sharply everted; 22 has a flat outer face. No. 24 is a neck, while 25-6 are simple rounded shoulders, possibly from the same vessel as the rims. The remainder (27-47) are bodysherds of which 27-9 could be from the vessel described above. The fifteen sherds of coarse flat-bottomed ware (48-62) (O Riordain's Class II) come from four or five vessels. No. 48 is a flat-topped rim with a slight pinched-out lip. There is a concave neck which is more sharply out-turned near the rim (Fig. 6). Nos 49-50 are rims of the same ware, 49 is rounded while 50, a fragment, has a flat top with a pinched lip on the inner face. Nos 51-2 are bodysherds, 12mm thick, from the same vessel as 50. This may be Vessel 4 (see below). Nos 53-5 are bodysherds. The inner face is smooth and similar to good quality western neolithic ware but the core is very crumbly and liberally gritted with quartzite. This gritting is also evident in 56-9, which come from another vessel of similar thickness. Finds from the fill of the enclosure wall (Figs 4, 6-7) This material, in a secondary, sealed context, was derived from the level of the pre-enclosure activity. It is presented here as a group with the pre-enclosure finds. Stone (Fig. 4). Of the thirty-four pieces offlint and chert (67-100) twenty-seven were waste, 74-87 of flint and 88-100 of chert. There are two round thumbnail scrapers, 67 (chert) and 68 (flint), an end scraper, 69 (chert), and two broken portions of the rounded types, 70-1 (both flint). The retouch on 67, 69-70 is of good quality. No. 72 is a chert point and 73 a flint blade. Of the five fragments of axeheads three (101-3) are from the same greenstone axe. It has ground facets on either side of one edge. No. 104a is a small chip of greenstone and 104b is of siltstone. A single shale bead (105) from the wall fill has a flattened oval outline, a thin slightly curved profile and an off-centre perforation bored from both sides. Of the five pieces of quartz crystal (106-10) only two are worked. No. 106 is a rectangular blade with facets on three sides and 107 is a triangular piece with one short edge serrated. Pottery (selection illustrated, Fig. 6). There are forty-four sherds of western neolithic ware (Class I) (111-54) representing at least six vessels although there are only two or three sherds of most of them. One vessel is represented by eight sherds and several small fragments (111-19). Only part of a rim (111) survives. It is sharply everted and has a flat top, the neck is slightly concave and the shoulder is of the medium step type ( ^ 2.5mm). Eight other rimsherds (120, 123-6, 129-31) from four or more vessels are rounded and everted, except No. 123, which</page><page sequence="10">308 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy is a broad flat-topped rim with an everted, slightly angular profile and concave neck. Although from the opposite side of the enclosure, this sherd may be from the same vessel as 111-19. Nos 121-2 and 127-8 are bodysherds from the same pots as 120 and 125-6 respectively, while 132 is from the same vessel as 130-1. Of the remaining bodysherds (133-54), 137-41 are of distinctive, well-fired, evenly made ware and come from a vessel not represented above. Among the twenty-one sherds of coarse flat-bottomed ware (Class II) (155-75) are the remains of at least three vessels. Most are worn and fragmentary but 155-63 are of distinctive, very dark grey ware with occasional calcite and igneous grits. Among the eight sherds of Beaker (176-83) are two rims (176-7) and two necksherds (178-9), which come from the same vessels. The rim has a simple rounded profile. A piece of daub (184) also came from the wall fill. The enclosure (Figs 2-7; Pis Ila-Vb) The enclosure was roughly circular but was apparently flattened on the eastern side (see below). It has maximum external dimensions of 30m north/south and c. 26m east/west. The enclosure wall, consisting of two concentric rings of limestone boulders set about lm apart, was 1.80m-2m wide. The wall-facing stones varied considerably in size but averaged 70cm long, 50cm wide and 35cm high. Most were set on the limestone bedrock, which was close to the surface especially on the periphery, but occasionally small propping stones were used to provide a level base (Fig. 3, section 7). On the south eastern side the wall was constructed directly over the pre-enclosure habitation layer. The wall fill or packing rested directly on this layer. Throughout the circle it consisted of limestone rubble and some earth. In the area of earlier activity the fill also contained habitation material derived from that occupation but finds also came from the northern, southern and western sides. The wall was reasonably well preserved on the north-west and southern edges. On the northern side excavation in cuttings 7 and 8 exposed a number of wall stones, but few of these were in situ and the general inward collapse was a result of the steeper slope in this area. The position and curve of the wall on the eastern side was less clear cut. To the south-east two converging lines of stones formed the wall-facings in cutting 6 (Fig. 2; Pl. V). The line of the circle turned sharply inwards at this point and the convergence of the wall-facings suggests that the entrance may have been at this, the most sheltered point in the circle. While it may be an earlier, unrelated feature, it is noteworthy that post-hole 7 occurred at the apparent terminus of the wall at this point. Beyond it, in the north-eastern quadrant, a loose scatter of large stones continued this line as far as the surviving wall in cutting 8. It is probable that this constituted the destroyed remnant of the wall in this sector. The character of the incurved section in cutting 6 was quite different from that of the surviving portions elsewhere on the site and it is possible that the deviation from a circular outline was a result of the remodelling of the enclosure during its occupation phase. The rubble fill of the wall in cutting 6 had a 'capping' formed by rough paving. This also occurred on the northern and western sides and may originally have been a consistent feature of the wall structure. Internal features (Figs 2, 3; Pis IV, V) Owing to the very considerable disturbance caused mainly by the later use of the site as a cemetery (see below) very little survived in situ of either the pre-enclosure or the enclosed habitation. The small number of features described here could belong to either phase, although where clearly preserved the earlier material appeared to be confined to the eastern part of the site.

It is evident from the level at which the top of this feature was found that it must have been in use well into the enclosure phase even if its initial use was earlier, but it may have been a pit cut from a higher, even post-enclosure level, whose edges were not apparent during excavation. Two bodysherds of hard coarse flat-bottomed ware (186-7) came from this feature. They are from a vessel with a concave neck and average thickness of 8mm. There were three post-holes (Nos 6, 9, 10) within the enclosure. No. 6, which may be part of the pre-enclosure activity, has already been dealt with.

A blackened area, 50cm wide and 12cm deep, occurred in the north section face of cutting 5 (Fig. 3; section 5, North: Hearth). This was 10cm above the old ground surface. A necksherd of western neolithic ware (1520), two chips of flint (1521-2), five fragments of burnt finds (1523-7) and one of unburnt bone (1528) came from this feature. A Beaker bodysherd (188), a cattle tooth (189) and two pieces of bone, 190 (cut and heavily burnt) and 191, came from a possible post-hole on the northern side of the site. The information contained with the finds, but not duplicated elsewhere, locates this feature in cutting 7 (2.35m from north; 2m from west). The post-hole was 25cm deep. It also contained a small quantity of charcoal (192). A flat-based standing stone was found in the south-eastern quadrant (Fig. 2; Pis IVc-d) about 5m in from the enclosure wall resting directly on the old ground surface. Unlike the large stones which make up the wall this is a conglomerate. There was no indication of its date but its position within the area of the enclosure most intensively used as a cemetery suggests that it was contemporary with this later use of the site. The stone has a maximum height of 85cm. A limestone pillar, 1.5m long and 45cm wide, was found lying over pit 7 in cuttings 1 and 2. O Riordain suggested that this 'may be a fallen standing stone'. Two burials, Nos 6-7 (see below), had been dug into the fill of the pit, which had maximum dimensions of 3m by 1.5m and was lm deep. The function and date of the pit are unknown. An apparently circular pit, 1.10m by 50cm, occurred on the southern side of cutting 5 (Fig. 2: Pit 2). A line of small stones ringed the pit on the northern side but no information concerning the pit or the stones survives. A large percentage of the Circle J assemblage came from the disturbed interior of the enclosure. Finds came from all levels, including the fill of the later slab-lined graves (see below). It was clear that none of these was from a secure context and the material is treated here as one group. Finds from the enclosure (Figs 4-7) Stone (Figs 4-7). There are 140 pieces of flint and chert (193-335). Amongst the waste or scrap are forty pieces of flint (261-300); the remainder are of chert (301-35). Most of this material had been struck but there is no indication of deliberate working or utilisation. There are sixty-nine artefacts or utilised pieces. The retouch, where present, is of a high standard and compares favourably with other assemblages from the peninsula. The flint artefacts are generally small and made from pebble flint. Nos 193-200 are arrowheads. All are bifacially worked. Nos 193-6 are leaf-shaped and have thin or pointed oval sections. Of the two hollow-based examples, 197 is particularly finely worked with well-formed barbs, while 198 is a cruder almost triangular piece. Nos 199-200 are broken and 200 lacks part of the tang. No. 201 is an unfinished leaf-shaped arrowhead, roughly prepared on both faces and with fine retouch along one edge. There are fifteen scrapers (202-16). The rounded examples (202-4) have a convex ventral profile while the end scrapers (205-9) are concave. Nos 205-6 have very steep retouch on the working edge and 208 has retouch on one long side. No. 209 is a reversible tool with working on both ends. Nos 210-14 are oblong pieces, with retouch on one end and at least one edge; 211-13 are worked on all but one end. These may have had a variety of functions as knife/scraper. No. 215 is a broken and burnt piece with retouch on one rounded edge. No. 216, part of a hollow scraper, has two very finely retpuched concave faces set opposite each other. Half of the upper one (as illustrated) survives but the tip of the horn is missing; the lower face is also damaged. No. 217 is an unfinished round or end scraper and is worked on one edge, which has steep retouch. Nos 218-25 are knives. No. 218, trimmed on one face and trimmed and retouched on the other, is an oblong piece with one finely worked edge. Nos 219-20 are similar curved knives. No. 219 is worked around the curved end and on part of the convex side, the bulbar face having wear lines particularly on the convex side. No. 220 is worked along the convex side and on the butt edge of the concave.

Nos 226-43 are blades. They are generally parallel-sided and without retouch, and fall into two groups, those over 25mm long and those under 20mm. As is usual at Lough Gur, the better blades, of both sizes here, are of flint. No. 224 is a tiny blade about 9mm long with flake scars on the ventral face. Nos 245-52 wee points, i.e. flakes with one pointed end. No. 245 is retouched along one edge on the ventral side and scarred on this edge at the point. Nos 253-60 are utilised pieces, trimmed or occasionally retouched (253). The following materials were used: flint-193, 195-7, 202-5, 207, 209, 210, 212-17, 219, 221, 226-32, 235-9, 244-8, 250, 254-5, 257-60; chert-194, 198-201, 206, 208, 211, 218, 220, 222-5, 233-4, 240-3, 249a-b, 251-3, 256. Axes. One complete axehead (336), a butt (337), the mid section of an axe (338) and thirty six fragments and chips (339-73) came from the enclosure. On 336 one side is virtually straight, the other slightly curved (Fig. 6). The edge is gently curved and has a marked junction with the sides. The butt is squared with a thin profile. The axe has a symmetric profile. The section is a pointed oval and narrow facets occur along both sides. The axehead was manufactured from a pebble and had been chipped prior to grinding and polishing. One small flake was subsequently removed but the artefact is otherwise undamaged and shows little sign of wear. No. 337, a fragment from the butt, has a very marked junction with the surviving side. The butt is thin in profile and squared in plan and the axe may have had a pointed oval section. No. 338, the mid portion of a large axe, has a pointed oval section with narrow facets along both sides. No. 339, part of the mid section of an axe, is oval in section and has a narrow facet along the surviving side. No. 340 is a similar but smaller fragment from a different axe. No. 341 has narrow facets on either side of the surviving edge giving it a pointed section and 342 is a chip from the same axe. No. 341 has broad facets on the face close to the side. No. 343 is a small and damaged piece preserving part of a faceted side. Nos 344-5 are fragments with portions of both faces surviving; 345 is from close to the butt. Nos 346-57 are chips from the same axehead. A small part of a faceted side is represented by 347. The remaining chips (358-73) have, with the exception of 367, a ground surface. No. 336 is of Andesitic-Dacitic lava, while 337-73 are of Dacitic lava. Stone objects (Fig. 6). No. 374, part of a sandstone spearhead of the type found at Site 10 (Fig. 65), 28mm wide and 4.3mm thick, is broken at both ends, both faces have been ground smooth and the edges have been sharpened. On both faces there is a band of horizontal grooves or scores along both edges. No. 375, an object of similar size, is of siltstone. It is broken but the surviving end is rounded. It is slightly damaged and appears to be worn on one side. One face is virtually flat and the other is convex. Very distinct grooves have been cut into both edges at regular intervals and these continue onto the sides of both faces. The object is 26mm wide, 9mm thick and tapers slightly towards the surviving end. Although similar in size and having grooves like those on 374, this object may not be a spearhead, but could be the butt of one. Or it may have been for a more mundane task such as the winding of string, which would provide a practical explanation for the deep grooves on both edges. Six stone beads (376-81) from the enclosure were all isolated finds (Fig. 7). Nos 376-9 are disc-shaped beads of mudrock, each with a central perforation bored from one side only and ranging from 7.5mm to 11.5mm in diameter. No. 380 represents about half of a notched bead of 'serpentine' and has an off-centre hourglass boring. No. 381, part of a flat oval-shaped bead or pendant of mudrock, has a centrally placed perforation bored from one side. Nos 380-1 are both broken through the perforation. Nos 382-3 may be the upper rubbing stones for use on a saddle quern. Both are bun-shaped, 382 being circular and 383 oval in plan. They have a rough texture, apart from one face of 383, which is very smooth, and similar but less accentuated patches occur on 382. No. 384 is a barrel-shaped stone with a rough texture on the sides. Both ends appear to be abraded, suggesting that the stone was used as a hammer. Bone (Fig. 7). Nos 385a-d are points. These were split and trimmed. On 385a the tip is polished. Nos 385b-c are slivers of split bone sharpened at both ends, while 385d is trimmed at one end only. No. 385e has been split and sharpened at one end, but the point is missing. No. 385f is a triangular piece of cut bone. See Appendix C.</page><page sequence="19">Grogan and Eogan ?Lough Gur excavations 317 f;i'-i) v$$n ff i ^S^i I \^a*^ ?9 ^p^^ ^ :1629 V at?

Three portions of antler of red deer were found. No. 64 is a tine fragment with chop/cut marks around the base. The point is worn smooth. Nos 65-6 are a main beam in two portions with chop/cut marks on the body. See Appendix C. Quartz (Fig. 6). There are sixty-six pieces of quartz crystal from the enclosure (388-453). Some of this material was deliberately struck and the characteristic result is a small blade, usually oblong with at least one very sharp straight edge. There are fifteen (389-403) varying in length from 8mm to 22mm and having a length to breadth ratio of 2:1 or 3:1. Occasionally some attempt at retouch is evident, as on 388 which may have been a knife. Nos 404-14 are small struck flakes which may have been utilised but do not belong to any clear artefact form; 416-20 are larger pieces from which flakes, possibly the smaller blades, were struck. Nos 421-39 are small flakes, probably waste, some of which retain part of the natural crystal facets. Nos 440-53 are unmodified scrap pieces. Pottery. There are 154 sherds of plain western neolithic pottery (Class I) from the enclosure (454-607), representing at least ten vessels. Ware generally of good quality, with quartzite grits up to 2mm long. Temper was used on most vessels; Vessel 3, for example, has a characteristic corky appearance. Vessels 1 and 2 are of very hard, slightly gritty fine ware, with a smooth unpitted Finish, and of a very dark grey (5YR 3/1) to light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) colour; but reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) and reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) also occur. Sherds are 4mm-8.5mm thick, average about 6mm. Vessel 1 (Fig. 6) (454-61): markedly everted rim (454) with beaded profile, slightly concave neck, simple pointed type shoulder, and the upper part of the body apparently had an almost vertical profile. Vessel 2 (462-72, not illustrated): simple, rounded, slightly everted rim (462-4); no neck or shoulder sherds. Nos 473-6 are from another vessel with sharply everted, flat-topped rim (473-4). Vessel 3 (477-93, not illustrated): bulbous, everted rim (477-80), neck slightly concave and shoulder (481) of medium step variety (2.5-5mm); three necksherds (494-6) possibly from this pot. Nos 497-500: angular, flat-topped, everted rims possibly from one vessel; 501-2: simple, pointed shoulders from the same vessel as 497. Nos 503-7: rims from at least two slight vessels, with angular (503-4, 507) or rounded profiles. No. 508: simple, pointed shoulder sherd. Nos 509-20: bodysherds, average thickness 6.5mm, from pot (possibly represented by rimsherds 497-500). No. 521: slightly concave necksherd. Nos 522-44: bodysherds, average thickness 4.5mm from smaller vessel represented by rimsherds 503-7. Nos 545-6: two rimsherds from vessel with rounded, everted rim profile. Nos 547-8: bodysherds from the same pot. Nos 549-51: with elongated, outward splay. No. 552: small worn rimsherd with angular, flat-topped profile. Nos 553-8: from small vessel with rounded, everted rim (553), shoulder (554-5) pinched-out, pointed and 5mm wide. Nos 559-607: miscellaneous bodysherds, probably from the vessels described above. A number of groups from individual vessels are represented by 561-2, 565-6, 568-71, 572-3, 580-4, 586-92, 595-600 and 602-4. Decorated western neolithic ware (O Riordain Class la) (Figs 6,7). Fourteen sherds represent six vessels (608-21). No. 608: broad-topped rim with rounded profile; top has two broad facets, one sloping inwards, one outwards. Decoration consists of closely set oblique strokes across top. Neck is upright and very thin (c. 5mm). Good quality ware containing very finely crushed quartzite and grog and few surface cavities. Outer face has fine slip and is burnished. Nos 609-11: from vessel similar to that represented by 608; rim (609) same form and size, but top has convex profile, is very worn and no decoration survives. Nos 610-11: worn necksherds. No. 612: rimsherd from vessel with upright neck, about 6mm thick, outer portion of rim missing but appears to have had angular broad-topped profile, decoration closely spaced, roughly parallel oblique scores across top. No. 613: rim of same form as 612 but from smaller vessel, very worn, no visible decoration. No. 614: rimsherd with broad, flat, outward-sloping face, profile curving inwards at the top, which is rounded, very worn and with no visible decoration. No. 615: bodysherd from same vessel. Nos 616-21: from similar vessel to 614. Rim (616) has broad, outward-sloping face with convex profile and curves inwards at the top, which is rounded. Shoulder (617) formed by simple angle, neck slightly concave. Sherds worn and pitted, dusty, gritless texture with no visible decoration.</page><page sequence="21">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 319 Despite lack of visible decoration on all vessels represented, rim form in particular is indicative of decorated western neolithic variety. No. 608 and probably 609-13 are of most characteristic decorated form (Class la) at Lough Gur. Ware is generally thicker and less gritted than plain variety and vessels usually have a dusty texture. Application of slip, as on 608 and 612, may have been more common than suggested by this group as a whole, most of which are very worn. All except 608, from cutting 10, are from northern part of enclosure in cuttings 8 and 9. Coarse flat-bottomed ware (Class II) (Fig. 6, only Vessel 4 illustrated). At least nine vessels represented by the 252 sherds (622-873) of this type. Ware is generally coarse and crumbly, with large number of quartz and igneous grits up to 5mm long, but finely crushed material also used. Some vessels are of considerably better quality. Vessel 4 and that represented by 709-24 had thick slip on outer surface, giving smooth, slightly dusty texture. Vessel 5 and 806-17 were of hard, finely gritted ware with smooth finish. Vessel 4 (622-708): appears to have narrowed towards base; walls slightly convex; rim (622-40) has broad rounded profile. A line of widely spaced, deeply impressed dots immediately below rim may be imitation of more usual perforations in this pottery type. Maximum internal diameter at mouth 22cm, average thickness 13mm. If ratio of height to width at mouth was same as reconstructed vessels from Site C (O Riordain 1954, fig. 16: 1, 2) this pot would have been about 22cm high. Outer face reasonably smooth, uneven reddish yellow colour, with a dusty texture; the inner face smoother and light brown. Nos 709-24: from vessel similar to Vessel 4 but coarser, rim an upright profile either rounded (709) or with slightly inward-sloping top (721). Average thickness of walls 15mm. Vessel 5 (725-53): round-topped rim (725-8) with slightly concave, inward-sloping face; 725 has single small perforation through wall 10mm below rim. Maximum internal diameter at mouth 20cm. Profile slightly convex, and apparently narrowed towards base. Uniformly hard ware with numerous grits of quartzite and igneous rock occasionally up to 5mm. Wall about 11.5mm thick just below rim, thinning to about 8mm lower down. Light brown to dark grey throughout. Prominent gritting on outer surface but much smoother inside. Grits rarely penetrate surface. No. 754: rimsherd, very coarse and gritty pottery, with flat top and outwardly protruding rounded lip. Nos 755-6: bodysherds from same vessel. A round-topped rim (757) and bodysherds (758-70) from vessel of same ware as 709-24. Nos 771-2: round-topped rims from vessel of hard, very gritty ware. No. 773: rim of same type as 754; bodysherds 774-800 from pot similar to 709-24. Nos 801-5: miscellaneous rimsherds; 801 round-topped, 802 has pointed profile with concave inner face, possibly from same vessel as 803, which also has inward-protruding lip; 804 has flat inward-sloping top; 805 is worn, possibly similar to 803. Nos 806-17: from a vessel of hard, finely gritted ware, average thickness 7.5mm. Nos 806-8: rim with flat top and slight expansion on both sides. Nos 818-73: miscellaneous bodysherds. The ware can be paralleled amongst the vessels already described. Only a small amount of Beaker pottery (874-926) came from the enclosure; only 903 is illustrated. This material is appreciably more worn and abraded than the other pottery types. There are twenty-eight sherds of fine ware. No. 874: pointed rim with two off-vertical scores on outer face. No. 875: bodysherd with two horizontal lines of comb ornament. Nos 876-8: undecorated rimsherds; 876-7 have pointed profiles; 878 is flat-topped and comes from plain vessel of abrasive ware containing quartzite grits. Bodysherds 879-84 may be from the same pot. No. 885: plain basesherd of very hard, slightly abrasive ware containing fine quartzite grits. Nos 886-901: miscellaneous undecorated bodysherds. There are no rimsherds amongst the twenty five sherds of Domestic Beaker. No. 902: basesherd with slightly protruding lip on foot-ring. No. 903, the only decorated sherd, has three deeply scored horizontal lines. No. 905: basesherd. Nos 906-7: bodysherds from vessel of dusty almost gritless ware. Nos 913-17: may also be from this pot, but are much darker reddish yellow than 905-7. Nos 908-12 and 918-22: miscellaneous bodysherds. Nos 923-6: flat basesherds, possibly from same vessel as 913-17. Nos 927-39: pieces of daub. No. 940: the only sherd, a rim, of 6 Riordain's 'small cup' type (1954, 327-30, fig. 15). Activity outside the enclosure (Figs 2, 6-8) On the north-eastern side of the site two cuttings, Nos 10 and 11, were opened in order to investigate a slight ridge running north/south on the rising ground in this area. This feature consisted of a low bank of gravel upcast derived from a shallow ditch on</page><page sequence="22">320 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy the western side in cutting 11 but could only be traced for a short distance northward in cutting 10. The function of the bank and ditch is unknown but they are a late feature on the site and considerably post-date the activity on the old ground surface in this area. The extensive spread of habitation material on the eastern side of the ditch, 20cm below the base of the upcast, was 3.5m wide on the southern side and appeared to have extended for 6m to the north into cutting 10. In that area there were further, more limited spreads to the west. The habitation layer had an average depth of 20cm. As the layer rested directly on the old ground surface and contained western neolithic and coarse flat-bottomed ware vessels it may be part of the pre-enclosure activity on the eastern side of the site (see above). However, sherds from one of the coarse flat bottomed ware vessels (No. 11) also came from a small area of activity abutting onto the enclosure wall, so some of this activity may post-date the enclosure (see below). Finds (Figs 6-8) Stone (Fig. 8). Of the thirty-five pieces offlint and chert (946-80), twenty-one are artefacts (946-66) and fourteen are waste or scrap pieces, seven of flint (967-73) and seven of chert (974-80). Nos 946-50: leaf-shaped arrowheads, bifacially worked, the first three finely retouched. Nos 949-50, poorer material, have correspondingly uninspired working. Butt of 949 and tip of 950 are missing. No. 951: small and elongated with curved profile. Nos 951-5: rounded scrapers, good quality retouch on 951-2, of which only tip survives, remaining pieces cruder. No. 956: knife, broken on one side, with fine working on part of the other, lozenge-shaped side. No. 957: irregular, with retouch on one curved side. Nos 958-60: blades', 961 a large rectangular flake with one serrated edge; 962 has one concave and one convex side with retouch on both. No. 963: an oblong piece with one curved end, possibly in preparation for retouch. Nos 964-6: prepared and struck pieces, worked (only 966 is illustrated). Axes (Fig. 8). No. 981: blade end of much abraded greenstone axehead; very marked junction with the sides, symmetric profile. Sides were apparently straight; pointed oval section. No. 982: large fragment from towards butt of sandstone piece, straight side, pointed oval section. No. 983: fragment. Nos 984-95: chips of greenstone axes, 984 worked along one long side, in the manner of flint and chert, probably functioned as knife. Nos 996-7: unmodified greenstone pebbles. No. 998: probably a whetstone, a square-sectioned sandstone block with worn groove in unbroken end and smooth sides. Probably of same date as cemetery (see below). No. 999: stone bead or pendant of green-black siltstone, oblong with thick oval section and central cylindrical perforation. No. 1000: piece of polished 'serpentine', possibly part of a bead. Nos 1001-2: bone points or pins; 1001 split, with finely polished tip; 1002 larger, less well-preserved tip, broken, also polished. Nos 1003-6: pieces of quartz crystal; 1003-4 blades; 1005-6 small chips. Pottery (Fig. 6). The ninety-seven sherds of plain western neolithic ware (Class I) from this area (1007-103) represent at least five vessels. Vessel 6 (1007-25): very hard fine ware containing fine to medium quartzite grits, rim (1007-10) rounded and everted, neck gently curved, shoulder simple and rounded. Maximum external diameter at rim about 30cm, wall 5mm thick immediately beneath the rim but the neck averages 7mm overall. Bodysherds 5mm thick with few cavities in either surface. Nos 1026-32: from smaller vessel with maximum external diameter at mouth about 20cm. Rim (1026) angular, neck curved, simple rounded shoulder (1027). Ware is fine with small amount of fine quartzite grits and carefully smoothed outer surface with few cavities. Average thickness 6mm but, like vessel 6, neck is thinner (475mm) immediately below rim. Nos 1033-6: rimsherds from three separate vessels. No. 1033 has everted, slightly pointed profile; 1034 angular; 1035-6 rounded. No. 1037: shoulder of small step variety (^ 2.5mm) from vessel with curved neck (1038) possibly that represented by rimsherd 1034. Nos 1039-78: bodysherds, many about thumb-nail size, possibly from same vessel as 1035-6. Nos 1079-83: neck- and bodysherds from vessel of very hard, almost gritless ware, with gently curved neck and simple rounded shoulder (1079). Nos 1084-90: necksherd and five bodysherds, of very hard gritty ware, average thickness 4.5mm. Nos 1091-3: two necksherds and one bodysherd from much larger vessel, possibly No. 6, as perhaps 1094-103, all bodysherds.</page><page sequence="23">Grogan and Eogan?Lough Gur excavations 321 *^^^ 946 ^^ 947 948 949 "^^ 050a 950b 961 852 953 ^^^^^ n^\ v / V r&gt;^ ^^B woo \jy W ^S ^^ 959 -^^^ 957 ^ gu Q'ft 1)1 $10 ^^^ 966 ^^^ * ^ss*^ ^^ 961 982 ^|^^H^ ^^^^^^^ /////A j^^^^^^ 981 996 ^C////^'f ^^^^^^^m ?=^m ? ? 7cm ^^^^e ?i? 3in Fig. 8- Circle J.

Vessel 7 (1104-34): of very similar ware to 1139-78, so intermingling between the two pots is possible. Nos 1104-7: rim with angular everted profile and broad inward-sloping top. Nos 1108, 1111-14: shoulder of medium step (2.5mm-5mm) variety. No. 1108: has vertical rectangular lug applied. No. 1109: a detached lug. The neck (1115-17) is upright. Ware is worn but where intact, e.g. on underside of 1104, apparently had smooth almost burnished finish. Apart from the lugs the only surviving decoration consists of oblique lines on the top of 1104. Nos 1135-44: T-headed or club rim with pronounced outward protrusion, now broken. Neck of this vessel (1146-8) gently curved, all sherds very worn, no surviving decoration but vessels with rims of this form at Lough Gur are generally decorated. No. 1151: sharply everted rim with broad convex top, decorated with closely spaced oblique lines across the top itself and band of short diagonal lines along outer edge. Coarse flat-bottomed ware (Class II) (Figs 6, 7). (Nos 1152-447: from minimum of six vessels.) Vessel 8 (1152-331): Hard brittle ware containing large quantity of fine to large igneous grits, which generally protrude through both surfaces. Upper portion smooth with grits removed from both surfaces. Light red to reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) with some reddish grey and light brown. Weight 1440g. Maximum external diameter at mouth about 30cm, similar diameter at base. Rim (1152-7) out-turned with angular profile and flat inward-sloping face. Overall profile appears to have been gently S-shaped. Base (1158-68) formed by plate 23mm thick, from which the body rises almost vertically, sherds 9.5mm-10mm thick. Vessel 9 (1332-53; Fig. 7: V9): hard gritty ware with smooth grit-free inner face. Curved profile, maximum external diameter at the mouth about 26cm. Average thickness 9.5mm. Rim (1332-46) round-topped with slight inward facet. Large perforations, executed from outside, occur about 10mm below the rim. Vessel 10 (1354-82): of very similar ware to vessel 9, slightly larger with maximum external diameter at mouth about 30cm. Average thickness 10mm-12mm. Upright rim (1354-5) with rounded profile. Vessel apparently had gently curved profile. Upper part, especially rim, is smooth and gritless with a dusty texture. Nos 1401-41: bodysherds from both 9 and 10. Nos 1383-4: rimsherds with flat inward-sloping top. Compact ware with smooth, grit-free surfaces. Part of a cylindrical bodysherd from same vessel, 8mm thick. Nos 1386-9: three rim and one bodysherd from another pot; light brown to grey ware in contrast to the medium to large calcite grits. Rim has upright rounded profile. No. 1390: round-topped rimsherd with gentle S-shaped profile; 7mm thick. Hard, pinkish grey (7.SYR N5) to reddish yellow (7.SYR 7/8), ware containing fine quartzite grits and similar to much of the western neolithic pottery. Single thumb-nail impression immediately below the rim on the outer face was possibly caused accidentally when the top was being smoothed. No. 1391: very worn, round-topped rimsherd possibly from the same vessel. Nos 1392-6: miscellaneous bodysherds. No. 1397: about twenty fragments. No. 1448: piece of hard gritty clay, possibly daub, with irregular scores over surface. Nos 1398-400, 1441-7: coarse flat-bottomed ware from cutting 11. Nos 1441-7: bodysherds from large vessel of thick (14mm-16mm) heavily gritted ware with smooth grit-free outer surface. Nos 1449-51: Rusticated/Domestic Beaker ware, probably from the same vessel; 1449 is a basesherd. Animal bone. Several fragments of animal bone from the habitation layer (1452-7) include cattle teeth (1452), unburnt (1453-4) and burnt pieces (1455-7). Post-enclosure activity (Figs 2, 3, 7) A small and apparently discrete spread of habitation material abutted the enclosure wall on the eastern side in cutting 6 (Fig. 2). This was sealed by wall collapse. The spread was partly contained in pit 6, a circular feature with a maximum diameter of lm and a depth of 15cm. Although this activity is later than the wall it may have taken place during the enclosure phase. Finds No. 1464: single flint point, struck and trimmed, but not retouched. No. 1465: a chip from a greenstone axehead; 1466-7: quartz crystal chips.</page><page sequence="25">Grogan and Eogan -Lough Gur excavations 323 Pottery. Nos 1468-71: western neolithic ware (Class I), a shoulder and three bodysherds from same vessel (1468-71). Nos (1472-505): coarse flat-bottomed ware (Class II) sherds. Nos 1472-85: from Vessel 11 (see Fig. 7: V. 11), which was also represented in area of activity north-east of the site (see above); 1486-505: miscellaneous bodysherds; 1506: fragments. Four pieces of gritless daub came from pit 6 (1507-10). Glass. Two fragments of greenish turquoise-blue beads were found in disturbed context; 1512, from outside the enclosure wall in cutting 6, has an oval cross-section and centrally placed cylindrical perforation; 1513, from cutting 10, is a similar but smaller bead with a large perforation. Lignite (Fig. 7). Nos 1514-17: portions of bracelets. Only 1514, from beneath the stone facing of the bank in cutting 11, was not in a disturbed context. No. 1514: a small portion of bracelet with flattened oval cross-section and maximum internal diameter of 7.4cm. No. 1515: from much slighter example with rounded D-shaped cross-section 7cm in diameter. No. 1516: similar in section and about 8cm in diameter with hourglass perforation somewhat carelessly put through one end, probably after breakage, for re-use as a pendant, a feature of a bracelet from Site C (O Riordain 1954, 354; fig. 26: 1). No. 1517: broken and worn piece with quadrangular cross section; section and curve on inner edge indicate it had been part of bracelet with internal diameter of 7.4cm. Iron. Nos 1518-19: two nondescript fragments of iron. Other finds. Several fragments of unburnt animal bone, probably cattle, came from the spread. A small piece of bronze or copper from the pit cannot now be located, but was described by O Riordain in the site notebook as a small piece with a flat, truncated oval cross-section, possibly the cross-piece of a sword or spearhead but the piece is so small that one cannot be certain from what object it may derive. Remarks While Circle J was clearly an enclosed habitation site the considerable amount of later activity had destroyed most of the occupation evidence and, in particular, the remains of any structures that were probably associated with it. Nevertheless, sufficient evidence survived to show that the site was intensively occupied during the Neolithic period and that at least two phases of activity, one predating and the other associated with the enclosure, occurred. There was no indication of any time-lapse between the two phases. There was only a small amount of Beaker pottery and related material on the site. Some of this appeared to come from the pre-enclosure phase and a limited amount was associated with the enclosure itself. Since it is improbable that a phase during which Beaker was in use would be succeeded by one where Neolithic pottery was exclusively in vogue, and in view of the evidence as a whole, it seems best to regard the 'pre-enclosure' Beaker as intrusive and to suggest that all of the Beaker material was a late arrival on the site. Burials Long after its original use as an enclosed habitation site Circle J was used as a cemetery. In all, fifty-eight burials were excavated (Nos 1-58) but in addition the remains of at least eighteen other individuals were recovered. Nine of the burials (1, 12, 13-15, 24, 26, 43-4) were contained in slab-lined graves and a further nine of these structures (A-1) were either empty or produced only fragmentary skeletal remains. Upright slabs from a minimum of four other slab-lined graves were also excavated. The remaining burials were contained in simple pits or dug graves. In the following list the orientation of the burials is given with the location of the head placed first. Unless otherwise stated all the burials consist of extended inhumations lying on the back.</page><page sequence="26">Burial Dimensions No. Fig. Pl. Sex Age Height Orientation Grave type L. W.

Previous excavation A small area around the centre of the site was investigated in the 1860s by J. Harkness (1869, 390), then Professor of Anatomy at University College, Cork. In the south-eastern quadrant he described a 'rude circle' of small stones about 2.45m in diameter surrounding the standing stone (see above). This circle did not exist at the time of W indie's description of Circle J (1912, 297-8), nor was any trace of it found during</page><page sequence="35">Grogan and Eogan?

A box of skeletal remains labelled 'Bones from a cist in a Stone Circle, Knockadoon, Co. Limerick' was discovered in 1984 in the Department of Archaeology, University College, Cork, by Barra O Donnabhain to whom we are indebted for the information. He identified the remains as the skull and fragments of the right femur, right radius, left innominate, ribs and some foot bones of an adult about twenty years old and possibly female, and fragments of a lower mandible, long bones, vertebrae and foot bones from a child aged about six. It is probable that these are the remains of the two individuals discovered by Harkness. It appears from his description that the 'cist' lay in the</page><page sequence="36">334 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy unexcavated south-western quadrant since its small size rules out its being any of the subsequently excavated examples (8-14, 24-7) in the area west of the standing stone. Harkness also opened the ground immediately west of the standing stone, that is in the vicinity of burial 23 (a child). Here he discovered 'at depth of little more than a foot . . . fragments of bones of the arms, a nearly perfect lower jaw, a portion of the upper jaw, the frontal and parietal bones of the skull, very nearly entire, with the temporal and occipital bones in a less perfect state. These bones had all belonged to one individual? a young person of from six to eight years of age'. The list of remains indicates that this was not part of burial 23. Both Harkness (1869, 390) and Windle (1912, 297-8) refer to another central circle but this was not evident prior to excavation nor was any trace of it subsequently revealed. Discussion As can be seen from the above list the burials were generally orientated west/east and only two (Nos 21, 30) deviated to any extent from this norm. With only one exception (No. 40, see below) the burials were extended on the back. Occasionally the skeleton was turned slightly to one side (Nos 25, 45) or the legs were flexed (No. 35). In a number of instances, e.g. Nos 17, 50, the head was inclined to the right or left side and frequently one or both hands lay over the pelvis. Burial 40 was unique in that it lay chest downwards. The body had apparently been arranged in the grave as the head was turned to the right side, the feet were pointed and the right hand lay behind the pelvis. Although the distortion to the upper spine noted during excavation was not referred to by the anatomist and may have occurred after deposition, it is more likely that it was the result of a physical deformity and this is probably the reason for the unusual position of the burial. It is not clear if all of the slab-lined graves originally had cover stones. While some of them were damaged others appeared undisturbed and yet only five, D, F, 26-7, 44 and that excavated by Harkness, had any evidence for capstones. Although the possibility of later removal cannot be ruled out, it appears that some at least of the graves had no covering or were, perhaps, roofed with timber. While it is probable that those burials not placed in slab-lined graves were accommo dated in dug graves, the edges of these were only apparent where they penetrated the subsoil. This was due to the degree of disturbance caused by the continuing use of the cemetery. It was also impossible to determine the level from which the graves were cut. However, they were between 30cm and 80cm deep and some of the uprights of the slab-lined graves appeared immediately beneath the sod, so it seems likely that the ground level at the time of the cemetery's use was similar to that at the time of excava tion. In the absence of orthodox stratigraphy there was, however, some evidence for a relative succession, but this was limited to instances where one burial was subsequently disturbed or overlain by another. There is no evidence to suggest that there was any chronological difference between the slab-lined and dug graves, and the infant burials appear to be an integral part of the cemetery. In some areas the arrangement of the burials, and particularly those in the slab lined graves, formed groups within the cemetery. One of these consisted of Graves E, F, 15, G-I and the damaged examples between E and G which occurred in two ordered rows. The graves had the same alignment and this was slightly different to those in the immediate vicinity such as A, 43-4. A second group was formed by D, 9-14, 24, 26 on the southern edge of the enclosure. The ordered arrangement of these groups was not evident elsewhere in the cemetery, and those in the north-eastern quadrant, for example, were much more haphazardly placed. A small number of burials (Nos 30-6, 58) were found outside the apparent line of the enclosure on the eastern side (see above). Only a limited area outside the circle</page><page sequence="37">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 335 was excavated and this portion produced a small number of burials (Nos 30-3, 58) on the eastern side. Nevertheless the vast majority of the burials occurred within it and it seems probable that the enclosure was intended as the delimiting feature of the cemetery. The use of pre-existing habitation enclosures as burial grounds is not an unusual feature of the late prehistoric/early historic period and occurs, for example, at Dooey, Co. Donegal (A. B. O Riordain and Rynne 1961). Of the forty-eight burials within the enclosure, forty (Nos 1-27, 37-48) came from the south-eastern quadrant. While no part of the south-western quadrant was excavated (by O Riordain) it is evident that the two northern ones were less extensively used and, in addition, all of the disturbed remains also came from the south-eastern quadrant. It was not possible to determine the condition of the enclosure at the time of its initial use as a cemetery, but if the theory that the circle itself was intended as a delimiting factor is correct then it must have been reasonably intact or at least visible. Furthermore, if the postulated outline of the enclosure on the eastern side (see above) is accurate then only one burial, No. 29, impinged on it. While it is possible that some further destruction of the enclosure wall was a result of the use of wall stones in the construction of the slab-lined graves, the character of the slabs forming the graves is quite different to those in the surviving part of the wall. It is also improbable that the users of the burial ground would occasion the destruction of the wall if this was an essential feature of the cemetery. Although fifty-eight individuals were represented only fifty of these were clearly in situ remains. To this minimum can be added the remains of at least twenty-three others which were associated with the burials themselves or came from disturbed contexts on the site. The range of ages represented, even in this small sample, is illustrative of contemporary life expectancy. The predictably high infant mortality is reflected in the fact that 30 per cent of the burials were of children under the age of five, while a further 17.8 per cent were under ten years of age. Having survived childhood it appears that natural hazards were considerably reduced and only 7 per cent of the sample were between ten and twenty years old. While 46.6 per cent survived into adulthood it was only possible to determine the ages of eighteen of the thirty-four adults present. The majority, over 60 per cent, were between twenty and thirty years of age. A further 28 per cent were between thirty and forty, while two individuals, one male and one female, were over fifty years of age. Although the sample is small, there appears to have been little difference in life expectancy between the sexes. Dating and conclusions Although there is no unequivocal evidence for dating the burial rite, the general orientation east/west, the absence of grave goods and the use of an enclosure without any ecclesiastical remains all point to a late prehistoric/early historic date for the cemetery. The use of slab-lined graves or cists is well known, and the evidence at present points to a similar date for their use. Within the cemetery it may be possible to detect two broad phases, the earlier represented by the partly crouched and the north/south orientated burials (Nos 35, 54, 21, 29, 30) and the later by the more ordered arrangement of the slab-lined graves. This grouping of similarly aligned burials was also a feature of the lintel grave cemetery at Reask, Co. Kerry, which the excavator has suggested dates to between the fifth and seventh centuries a.d. (Fanning 1981, 152). The Circle J slab-lined graves, and particularly those which had in situ capping, are similar to the Reask lintel graves. The broadly contemporary habitation sites at Carraig Aille (O Riordain 1949) look across the lake towards Circle J. Caulfield (1981, 208-9) has noted the likelihood of an Iron Age date, possibly the fourth century a.d., for the two ringforts. It is interesting</page><page sequence="38">336 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy to consider whether the cemetery at Circle J may have been used by the community at Carraig Aille. Circle K (Figs 1, 10-31; Pis XIa-XV) This is an enclosed habitation site dating to the later Neolithic and Beaker periods. Two major phases of activity are represented. In the earlier unenclosed phase, occupa tion centred on a roughly square house (No. 1). Subsequently this was replaced with a rectangular house (No. 2) located within a double-kerbed enclosure. A small quantity of later Bronze Age material came from higher levels on the site. Circle K is situated on the western side of Knockadoon on a level plateau below the crest of the peninsula (Fig. 1; OS 6" Limerick sheet 32, 14.7cm from N, 16.9cm from W). Before excavation the outline of the enclosure and part of the central house (No. 2) were clearly visible (Pl. XIa). The site had previously been designated K and described by Windle (1912, 300-1). O Riordain excavated the site in 1940. It was the first of the enclosed habitation sites to be investigated (6 Riordain 1954, 445) and it was laid out in a grid system based on 10 foot (3m) squares and divided into four quadrants (NE, NW, SE, SW) with a separate numbering of the squares in each quadrant. Pre-enclosure activity (Figs 10-17) According to Professor O Riordain, in a typescript report of 1940, the earliest activity at Circle K consists of a small number of inhumation burials on the north eastern side of the site immediately outside the enclosure wall. However, apart from burial 2, which appears to have underlain one of the post-holes of the square house (No. 1, see below), there is no clear evidence that the burials pre-date the house itself. Nos 3 and 4 do appear to be earlier than the enclosure wall, while No. 1 may have been inserted into the habitation layer overlying the house floor. There is no informa tion to indicate the relative stratigraphical position of burial 5, but it is included here for convenience. Burial No. 1 (Figs 10-13, 17; Pl. XV) Very disturbed; only skull and some vertebrate fragments found at base of an upright of outer ring of enclosure and in upper level of habitation layer overlying floor of House 1. Area covered by burial 28cm by 25cm, no indication of pit. Dr Inkster reported that these were 'a handful of very broken fragments of a child's skeleton. The halves of the neural arches have fused, indicating an age of over one year'. The dental report indicates an approximate age of two years. Finds (Fig. 13; Pl. XV). Necklace consisting of a stone pendant (1173) and six bone beads (1174-9), found in area around and under the jaw. The pendant, of dark grey slate, has irregular D-shaped outline and maximum dimensions of 33mm by 26mm; it is 4mm thick. There is roughly central hourglass perforation. Three of the beads (1174-6) are waisted; 1174-5 have three segments; 1174 is rounded in cross-section; 1175 is faceted. No. 1176: two segments, square in section with rounded corners. Surviving half of bead is rough at one end indicating it may originally have had three or more segments. Nos 1177-8: barrel-shaped in section and triangular in plan, 11mm and 8mm high, 15mm and 14mm in maximum width respectively. No. 1179 is also barrel-shaped, 15mm long, oval in section. Western neolithic and coarse flat-bottomed fragments were found in dark earth around the burial, but it is not known if they had been deposited with it.</page><page sequence="39">Grogan and Eogan ?Lough Gur excavations 337 I flft / 0p Wall facing, displaced J? \ \^ [ \ y b Bur'a| I_ I-*o.

Within pelvis, lying upon interior of right os nominatum and extending up line of body were a number of fragments of an infant's vertebrae and ribs. Burial from below patch of rough limestone gravel forming part of house floor. Part of skeleton underlay one of wall post-holes. The earth under and around burial was black and sticky and contained numerous charcoal fragments. No indication of pit or formal covering. All bones in very fragmentary condition. Dr Inkster reported: A considerable number of fragments are present from all parts of an adult skeleton. All the epiphyses available such as upper end of ulna and radius, upper end of femur, heads of metacarpals and bases of phalanges have fused. Apart from the history which suggests that the sex is female, foetal bones have been found in the pelvis, there is no conclusive evidence of sex. The tali have a considerable horizontal angle, about 23?, between the neck and body, a concave medial malleolar facet placed far forwards and a groove on the back</page><page sequence="41">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 339 Rock Outcrop ~~~~~~ ^v** 0^_^^^^3 M Fig. 12- Circle K. House 1, sections. of the trochlear surface extending obliquely downwards and laterally from the posterior end of the malleolar facet. The groove is to be associated with pronounced extension of the foot; the large angle of the neck and the condition of the medial malleolar facet both indicate habitual inversion of the foot. On the other surface, the posterior calcanean facet extends forwards and medially in a manner which also indicates habitual pronounced inversion of the foot. The anterior border of the trochlea is straight and there are no facets or extensions of articular surface such as would indicate strong dorsiflexion of the ankle. Among the adult bones were found the petrous part of a young temporal bone and three pieces, lower end of humerus, a phalanx and a first metatarsal, from a young child. The size of the humerus agrees with the size of a specimen from a child about two years old. Fragments of foetal bones, found in pelvis of burial 2, consisted mostly of fragments of vertebrae, including fourteen cantra and about seventeen pieces of neural arches. A few pieces of limb bones were present; the lower end of a humerus and two fragments of ischium indicate by their size that the child, though probably unborn, was nearing full term. Also included are a pisiform bone from an adult and some fragments belonging to a small skeleton, possibly to the two-year-old child mentioned above. There were no finds associated with this burial. Burial No. 3 In crushed heap on flat slab of limestone against which the feet of burial 2 were laid (Fig. 11), slat partly covered by projecting stone set in earthen bank supporting the circle uprights. Crushed fragments of skull, some vertebrae and other fragments were found beneath outer ring of enclosure. Some bones, including portions of the skull, overlapped the edge of the slab on southern and western sides, apparently confused with remains of burial 4. Dr Inkster reported:</page><page sequence="42">340 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy These bones include fragments of skull vault and a piece of mandible from the chin region, a right petrous temporal bone, a fragment of a left temporal bone and a left zygomatic bone, the centre of seven vertebrae and separate neural arches of a similar number. One neural arch has definitely joined the centrum, one has definitely not joined and most of the arches are broken so as to suggest union rather than separation. The estimated age from the above is between three and six years. The size of several pieces of long bones such as shafts of radius and ulna, metacarpals etc. suggest an age nearer three than six years. Dr McCaughey's report on the teeth and parts of an upper jaw indicated the remains of two children, one approximately two years old, the other perhaps one year older. A few teeth and bones were found inside the wall of the circle exactly 30cm south of burial 7. Dr McCaughey reported that the teeth were two temporary molars and one developing permanent molar from a child aged two to four. There were no finds associated with this burial. Burial 4 A few fragments of skull and other bones on adjoining flat slab, at right angles to burial 3 and at foot of burial 2 (Fig. 11). Dr Inkster reported: These fragments are mostly the remains of a child and include fragments of skull vault, arches of vertebrae and fragments of ribs. The vertebral arches have been separated from their centra in the thoracic region so as to indicate an age of about three years or less. The crowns of an incisor tooth and a canine were also found. Dr McCaughey suggested that the 'upper left temporary canine just about to be shed' belonged to a young person aged eleven to thirteen and the 'upper left permanent incisor' was from a child aged two to four. He reported: 'assuming that the root of the canine has not been broken, and I do not think it is, these teeth could not belong to the same individual'. Immediately south of burial 3, 60cm beneath the bank supporting the enclosure at this point and a little west of burial 4, a few human teeth and bones were found on the surface of the bedrock. These are numbered 4a. Dr Inkster reported: These consist of a handful of fragments similar to those in burial 4 and include pieces of the vault of a young skull, the petrous parts of young right and left temporal bones and a couple of pieces of vertebral arch. They may be from the younger skeleton found in burial 4. Also included is a piece of the shaft of a long bone either from an older skeleton or of animal origin. Burials 4 and 4a appear to consist of superimposed interments of a child (aged two to four) and a young person (aged eleven to thirteen). No finds were associated with either burial. Burial 5 A deposit of poorly preserved bones, 12cm deep, in a natural triangular hollow in bedrock on northern edge of house (Fig. 11), covered by black earth mixed with animal bone fragments up to 45cm deep and about 18cm diameter. Dr Inkster reported: These bones are the remains of an infant and include fragments of skull vault, petrous temporal bone, neural arches of vertebrae, ribs, innominate bone, lower end of humerus and pieces of other long bones. From the size of the bones the child was probably newborn or in its first year of life. A developing incisor tooth was also found. Dr McCaughey reported that 'it is probably a developing temporary central incisor, in which case the age is about the time of birth'.</page><page sequence="43">Grogan and Eogan ?

Grave-goods: burial 1 (1173-9) and burial 6 (1180-92). House 1 (Figs 10-12, 14, 15; Pl. XIIc) On north-eastern side of site, in natural, saucer-shaped hollow in bedrock, reasonably well defined but structural details were not forthcoming. The house is almost square (7.25m east/west and 6.65m north/south). On northern side plan is provided by low bank of gravel, 10cm high, with irregular row of stones set on top of it. The gravel bank also occurs on eastern side but here there are no stones in situ, except at southern</page><page sequence="44">342 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy end where there, is a line of stones but no bank. There are also a few post-holes on northern and eastern sides. On the other two sides the walls are defined by post-holes only; they are particularly numerous on southern side. Professor O Riordain suggested in his typescript report that part of the southern wall underlay the gravel bank supporting the enclosure wall (see below), but this would mean incorporating post-holes 9-11 and 22, making the overall plan implausible, as it would have been extremely irregular on this side. Similarly Nos 3, 6 and 23 are not easily accommodated as containing major structural components, but may, like the previous three, have been auxiliary props. There are two obvious gaps in the walls, on the northern and eastern sides (lm and 1.5m wide respectively). Either may have been the original entrance. Internally a large post-pit (No. 1) and a smaller post-hole (No. 17) provided support for the roof. The discrepancy in the relative sizes of these two features is not readily explained unless the roof was higher on the northern side, in which case the entrance would have been here also. A hearth, 90cm by 60cm, in the south-western corner consisted of a 15cm deep accumulation of charcoal and burnt earth lying on a flat, much blackened projection of rock. In this area also there was an irregular floor of cobbles; throughout the rest of the house rough gravel provided the floor, apart from one limited area of paving near the southern wall. Associated with the house and extending beyond it on the northern side and beneath the gravel bank supporting the enclosure wall to the south was a layer of habitation debris up to 30cm deep. It was thicker and more homogeneous inside the house and is clearly occupation material associated with activity in the structure. The upper portion had been disturbed, perhaps when the enclosure wall was constructed or more probably at a later stage after the introduction of Beaker. At this time some Beaker pottery became incorporated in the disturbed material and sherds from other vessels were redeposited at a higher level. Finds Stone (Fig. 14). Forty artefacts or utilised pieces of flint and chert came from House 1. While both materials were worked in the house or its immediate vicinity the amount of waste is small, eighty-four pieces of flint weighing lOOg (40a-c, 41) and fifteen of chert weighing 20g (42). Nos 40a-c had been burnt. Projectile heads. All arrowheads (1-9). No. 1: a fine, laurel-shaped artefact with part of butt missing.

Scrapers (10-26b). No. 10: good thumb scraper made from small flint pebble; others mostly rounded but owing to poor quality of the raw material only a few, such as 11-15, can properly be described as round scrapers. High standard retouch on 11, 12, 14, 15 and 18, but 7, 21 and 24-6b are quite crude.

Some disturbance evidently took place around the house, probably during construction of enclosure wall, and Nos 575-630, from vessels 1-5 (described below) came from immediate vicinity of house or a higher level. Vessel 1: represented by sherds 83-108 from the house itself and 575-85 from area around it. There are seven rims (83-8, 575), two shoulder (576-7), fourteen neck (89-98, 578-81) and fourteen bodysherds (99-108, 582-5). Compact, well-fired ware containing large quantity of crushed quartzite grits; both faces smooth, few cavities; outer surface red to black, with a red/brown dominant; core and inner face consistently red; walls 5mm-7mm thick, rim everted and formed by folding out top of neck and pressing it into outer face. On some sherds (e.g. 83) the top was then pinched out giving the rim an angular profile. On others (85-6) the rim was turned out between the thumb and forefinger leaving a distinct line of thumb-nail impressions immediately beneath it on the surface. Neck has pronounced curve at junction with rim, straightening towards shoulder, which is a simple angle. Upper portion of vessel was joined to body at neck. Vessel 2 (109-51): similar ware and fabric but larger and heavier pot. External diameter at mouth about 26cm; average thickness of walls 8mm; soft texture; red to black externally; red core and inner surface. There are seven rims (109-15), twelve necksherds (116-27), five shoulder sherds (128-32) and nineteen bodysherds (133-51). Rim everted and formed by rolling over top of neck and pinching it out; neck 3.8cm high; shoulder of slight step variety. A worn rimsherd (586) and a bodysherd (587) came from vicinity of house. Vessel 3 (Figs 15, 26): represented by 152-87 from house and 588-607 from vicinity. Compact, very well-fired ware containing crushed quartzite grits; both surfaces smooth, few cavities, brown to black with a brown core, walls generally 6mm thick, some bodysherds, probably from near base, up to 7mm; rim everted with rounded profile, neck straight and upright; shoulder, represented by four sherds from vicinity of house (591-4), is of small step type. There are eight rimsherds (152-6, 588-90), fifteen neck- and shouldersherds (157-63, 591-8) and thirty-three bodysherds (164-87, 599-607). Vessel 4 (Fig. 32): represented by 188-209 from the house and 608-17 from vicinity. Smooth, compact and well-fired ware, both surfaces black, core brown. Similar to No. 3 but consistently thinner (5mm); a few bodysherds (e.g. 199, 204, 207-8) could belong to either vessel. Rim everted and rounded, neck (about 2.4cm high) straight and slightly out-turned; shoulder forms slight step (609-11). There are two rims (188, 608) and three shoulders (609-11), four neck- (189-92) and twenty-three bodysherds (193-209, 612-17). Vessel 5: represented by 210-18 from house and 618-25 from vicinity. A small pot, of poorer quality than previous examples, irregularly finished; walls 5mm-6mm thick; rim pinched out at sharp angle to slightly curved neck; shoulder formed by small step. There are five rims (210-12, 618-19), three shoulders (214, 215, 620), three neck- (213, 621-2) and six bodysherds (216-18, 623-5). Vessel 6: represented by 233-52 and 626-62. A poorly made pot with simple folded-over rim (233-7, 626-7), neck slightly curved, shoulder (represented by 628) is slight. Well-fired, compact ware, smooth but irregular, with quartzite and calcite grits.

Vessel 12: represented by forty-five sherds from the house (309-52) and seven from area around it (708-14). Coarse ware with large greenstone grits; buff to cream externally with brown to dark core and inner surface; latter being generally smooth, outer surface regular; rim (309-11) pinched up and flat-topped, may be slightly everted; upright profile and flat base (312a-b); average thickness of wall 10mm. Vessel 13: represented by nine sherds all from house (353-61). Compact ware, smooth but uneven surface with limestone grits, generally dark, but some areas are cream to buff, sherds 10mm-12mm thick; upright, flat-topped rim (353-7). Vessel 14: represented by nine sherds from the house (362-70) and five from the area around it (715-19). Similar ware and texture to Nos 13 and 15; rim flat internally but rounded out into outer wall; average thickness of body 10mm; Nos 371-4, 441-2: rimsherds from pots similar to Vessels 13-14; on some, such as 371-2, rim is flat-topped; 374 has inward-sloping rim; 441-2 have rounded profiles. No. 441 has cylindrical perforation 11mm beneath the rim. A burnt accretion occurs on inner surface of sherds and in perforation itself. Because of wear or damage eight bodysherds (461-8) could not be assigned to any of the vessels described although the ware can be paralleled amongst them. A few sherds form Vessels 15-16 and 18-22 came from the house floor, but as these pots were associated with the area immediately around and above that layer they are described under Finds from the vicinity of House 1 (see below) as are the sixty-five sherds of Beaker pottery (469-533) from House 1. All are from the upper, disturbed area and as they come from a minimum of ten vessels, some of them clearly came from the area around and above the house and were not, therefore, in a primary position. Finds from enclosure wall fill (Fig. 16) Although in a disturbed context this material was derived from the pre-enclosure habitation. Stone.

There are seven pieces of quartz (1849-55); 1849-51 small pointed chips, possibly tools; 1852-3 and 1854-5 are fragments. Western neolithic pottery (Class I) (Fig. 16) (1856-71). A rim and shoulder (1856-7) are from a vessel similar in ware and form to No. 1 from House 1. No. 1858: a shoulder; 1859-63: necksherds of dark, well-fired ware 5mm thick. Nos 1864-71: miscellaneous bodysherds. The vast majority of the pottery from the wall fill consisted of coarse flat-bottomed ware (Class II), represented by 260 sherds (1872-2131), at least nine vessels, of which one (No. 16) is better represented in the vicinity of House 1 (see below). Vessel 30 (1872-915): hard ware, with large number of limestone grits protruding through both surfaces, cream to dark; rims (1872-9) have a rounded profile with a slight flattening along the top. Cross-section of base (1880-3) suggests vessel had low upright foot. Pot similar in ware and form to one of the reconstructed vessels from Site C (6 Riordain 1954, fig. 16: 1). Diameter at mouth about 24cm, average thickness of walls 10mm. Vessel 31 (1955-86): represented by thirty-two sherds found together on south-western side of the site, very coarse, buff to black ware with large quantity of limestone grits; outer surface poorly preserved except near rim (1955-61) which has a rounded profile with the top separately applied as a 'skin' (see 1956). Appears to have had an open profile (see 1955); diameter at mouth about 10cm; walls 10mm-11mm thick. Vessel 32 (2012-25): found at southern side of enclosure; ware hard with shale, limestone and quartzite grits; cream to buff externally with gritty texture, burnt accretion on inner face;</page><page sequence="52">350 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy rim has pointed profile with slight outward extension and an inward-sloping facet; average thickness of walls 11mm. Vessel 33 (2036-70): no rimsherds, but the pot may have had an overall profile like No. 30. The base (2036-40) 16cm in diameter has an upright foot and from the point the wall swells outwards. The ware is slightly friable and contains limestone and quartzite grits, outer surface cream to dark with slightly dusty texture; inner surface rough. Nos 2041-70: bodysherds; 2071 from near the rim is, like 2059-65, of more compact ware than the others and may be part of this vessel; three pinched-up cordons on outer face. Nos 1916-47: bodysherds found together in wall fill on western side of the site; hard cream to dark ware containing numerous large limestone grits; average thickness 8mm. No. 1916 has single incised channel on outer face. These sherds, and possibly 1948-54 from same area, are from a vessel similar in profile and form to No. 30. Nos 1987-89: rims of similar ware to 1955-61, flattened top, cylindrical perforation through 1987. Nos 1990-2011: bodysherds possibly from a single pot. Nos 2026-34: from Vessel 16 or one very similar. No. 2026: rimsherd from eastern edge of site; 2027: a rim fragment; 2028-34: bodysherds from wall on the south-western side. No. 2035, a rim found with 2026, has a pointed profile, elongated and slightly concave inward sloping facet, of well-fired compact ware dark throughout, containing crushed quartzite grits. Pointed rims do not occur elsewhere at Circle K, but a small number of vessels at Site 10 (see E254: 893, 895, Fig. 68) have a similar profile. Nos 2072-3: rims; 2072 has pointed profile and flared neck; 2073 has broad flat top with slight expansion on both sides. Dark compact ware containing limestone grits. No. 2074: possibly a rim, has evidence for a separately applied top; vertical groove on inner face, very compact ware 13mm thick. Nos 2075-31: miscellaneous bodysherds; ware can be paralleled amongst vessels described above but it is not possible to ascribe them to any particular pot. Beaker pottery (2132-4). No. 2134: undecorated bodysherd, from western side of site at point where inner wall face does not survive. No. 2132: probably from close to rim of a vessel (Fig. 16); single line of cord decoration on inner face; outside worn but may have had some form of horizontal ornament; good quality ware, buff with dark core, 5mm thick. No. 2133: plain bodysherd. No. 2135: flat-topped rim, expanding slightly and evenly from wall, from vessel with open profile; very unusual ware, red to buff in colour throughout, exceptionally compact and well fired. It contains grog and very fine shale grits and the sherd is 6mm thick. The enclosure (Fig. 10; Pis XI, XIII) Constructed on the rim of a large saucer-shaped depression of cracked and weathered limestone the enclosure is roughly circular with maximum external dimensions of 31m east/west and about 27.7m north/south. Internally the walls enclose an area 26.5m (east/west) by about 24m (north/south), that is about 500m2. The walls were formed by two concentric rings of limestone boulders. While most of them were erected orthostatically, many were set lengthways along the circumference of the circle. The rings were about 1.5m apart and the gap between them was filled with a mixture of earth and limestone rubble. This survived to a maximum height of 60cm. The stones of the outer ring, generally larger than those of the inner ring, average 90cm high, 80cm long and 50cm wide. Except for a section along the north-eastern side, where they were placed on an artificial bank of earth and gravel constructed directly over House 1, the rings were set directly onto the bedrock. A few boulders with uneven bases were supported from underneath by packing stones, otherwise they were held in position by small amounts of packing against the base on both sides. The walls were in general well preserved. At several points to the south and west small gaps occurred in both rings, but those stones that had overturned were in most cases found close by. The northern segment was in poor condition and few of the wall stones remained in situ. The construction on this side differed also and the wall curve was marked by a compact mass of small blocks. The dilapidation may have been partly due to the</page><page sequence="53">Pl. XHIa Circle K.

The entrance is on the left and House 2 in the centre with the large natural hollow immediately to its right.</page><page sequence="54">352 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy exposed position of the wall, which appears to have been rebuilt in its present form at some later date. The entrance (Pl. XHIa) consisted of a simple passage through the wall on the south eastern side, lined on either side by a row of boulders which terminated the wall fill. The passage is flanked by four post-holes, two on the line of the inner ring 1.8m apart and two along the outer line 2.4m apart, made by enlarging natural depressions in the bedrock. They are 25cm in diameter and 30cm deep, have packing stones set around them and probably held gate-posts for a double gate arrangement. The southern side of the entrance is continued outwards for about 3m by a row of large stones extending from the end of the outer ring. A similar feature, at present indicated by a single stone, may have existed on the northern side. The interior of the enclosure consists of a cracked and weathered limestone depression. This was saucer-shaped, with the highest part on the western side. The depth of stratigraphy was less than 10cm over most of this area, but most of the finds came from natural pockets and depressions in the bedrock, largest of which was a roughly trefoil-shaped hollow on the north-western side with maximum dimensions of 16.5m north/south and 9m east/west (Fig. 10). While this was generally about 75cm deep, in places holes and pockets were up to 1.4m deep. The floor of the hollow consisted of sticky yellow charcoal-flecked clay, possibly a buried sod layer, and above it an artificial fill. The lower part consisted of dark humified earth and the upper level of rough limestone blocks measuring about 30cm by 30cm by 30cm, which provided a roughly level stone floor on top of the earthen fill. The finds in the fill itself (2402, 2406-14, 2492-567, 2844, 2847-8) are contained in this section, although they may pre date the main occupation phase within the enclosure. The ratio (1:9) of western neolithic to coarse, flat-bottomed ware is virtually identical at both levels, but there is considerably less Beaker ware (three sherds) in the hollow, and these may be intrusive. The cave (Fig. 10; Pl. XlVa) Natural feature in north-eastern quadrant of circle and consisting of an opening in the vertical north face of a deep hollow in the limestone bedrock. The base of the hollow was 3.2m beneath the plateau and the entrance to the cave consisted of a pointed opening just over lm high and 87cm wide. It sloped downwards to a depth of 5.35m. At its innermost extremity it was 46cm wide and 80cm high. A limited amount of activity took place within the cave. A small hearth, 33cm by 28cm, formed by three flat stones set against the*eastern wall immediately inside the entrance, contained charcoal and blackened gravel 7cm deep. A cavity in the base of the western wall, which had been sealed off by a row of stones, contained a human tooth (the second molar of a young person, which has not survived) and further down the slope a few animal bones (not surviving) were found. The cave contained an artificial fill of gravelly earth and dark, reddish sand containing flecks of charcoal. The mouth of the hollow had been blocked off with several large boulders before the main phase of activity in order to level off the floor of the enclosure. Burials (Figs 10, 13; Pl. XV) Two burials (Nos 6 and 7) occurred in the enclosure between House 2 and the cave. No. 6, a double interment, lay near southern edge of hollow from which cave opened. The deposit covered an area 91cm by 61cm and was covered by closely spaced angular stones, sealed by a 50cm-thick layer of dark habitation material; orientated north/south. Although it had the appearance of a single extended inhumation the anatomical and dental reports both show that at least two subjects were present.

Dr Inkster reported that 'the remains include a large number of skull fragments from a young person, a handful of pieces of ribs and fifteen pieces of vertebral neural arches'. The finds from burial 6 consist of twelve stone beads all of green-black siltstone (1180-91; Fig. 13). The excavation report states that some came from immediately above it, others were found just south of it and one was from the base of the skull, but as they were all given a single site number it is not possible to distinguish the beads from each location. These are very similar and probably formed a necklace associated with one or both of the individuals present. The beads are generally oval, rounded on one face, flat on the other. They vary from 17.4mm (1180) to 14.1mm (1191) long and from 11.6mm (1180) to 9.6mm (1190) wide; all between 2.6mm and 4.0mm thick. Nos 1182, 1184, 1187, 1189 and 1190 have notched outlines similar to, but less distinct than, those from the necklace in Circle L (E253: 1906-23). No. 1192, a similar but broken bead from immediate vicinity of burial, probably derived from the necklace. Burial No. 7, immediately outside north-eastern wall of House 2, orientated north-east/south-west (Fig. 10); extended on back, contained in shallow oval pit 40cm by 15cm; head turned slightly to left. Dr Inkster reported that 'there are fragments of bone representing most of the skeleton of a new born child. The size of the bones correspond to that of a foetus about one month before full term'. There were no grave goods. The only other features within the enclosure are two pits (Fig. 10) or extended natural hollows. No. 1, immediately north of House 1, has already been discussed. No. 2, on the western side of the enclosure beside the wall, has a pointed oval plan and maximum dimensions of 1.50m by 65cm and is about 20cm deep. The fill consisted of blackened earth and contained three knives or blades (2314, 2317, 2319) and four pieces of waste flint (2333, 2357-9). A concentration of material (2136-301) came from an area around the northern and eastern sides of House 2. While there is no evidence to connect these with the activity in the house itself there was an absence of finds between this central area and the internal perimeter of the enclosure. All the finds from the enclosure are described together. Finds from within the enclosure (Figs 18-22) (2136-864, 3078-90) Stone (Figs 18, 19). One hundred and seventeen pieces of flint and chert (2136-80, 2302-61, 2856-7, 3078-87), forty-nine waste (2162-80, 2332-61 and 3084-7), fifty-six artefacts, nine utilised pieces; 2136 and 2303-4 are arrowheads, leaf-shaped except for 2304, which is tanged and possibly barbed. No. 2305: broken tip of lozenge-shaped arrowhead. There are eleven scrapers; rounded examples (2137-9, 2306) of good quality; 2138-9, 2306 good thumb scrapers. Nos 2140-1, 2307-9, 2856: end scrapers, 2856 of particularly good workmanship, retouch along most of the edge. No. 2310: worn and broken, one side slightly concave, surviving edge worked.

Donegal (Flanagan and Flanagan 1966, 25, fig. 11: AC), while 2858 is like two beads from the portal tomb at Ballyrenan, Co. Tyrone (Davies 1937, 99-100, fig. p. 97: BM 1, 2). As in Circle K, they are all examples made from naturally rolled pebbles. Both ends of 2858 are chipped, so it is not possible to determine if they were lipped.

Vessel 34 (2415-46): same compact, smooth cream to brown ware as vessels 13-15, contains limestone and shale grits up to 10mm long, average thickness of walls 9mm; rim (2415-20) slightly rounded and everted with flat inward-sloping facet; no basesherds. Vessel 35 (2447-77): similar ware and colour to No. 34 but with larger quantity of grits, many of which protrude through outer surface giving a rough appearance. Rim (2447): flat-topped, slopes outwards slightly with slight inward expansion; single cylindrical perforation applied through wall from exterior. The vessel may have had flared profile at mouth; base (2448) flat, vertical foot about 10mm high; walls average 10mm thick.

Nos 2503-46: collection of forty-four bodysherds found together; ware smooth but slightly uneven surface, cream to brown externally, dark core and inner face, grits of shale and limestone. Nos 2547-50: bodysherds of similar ware. Nos 2551-5: from Vessel 36, also represented by 2568-74 from enclosure floor (see below). No. 2551: rim fragment; 2552: beneath rim, ridge or cordon on outer face. Nos 2556-67: miscellaneous bodysherds. Nos 2556, 2558: thicker (12mm) than the other sherds from hollow. Nos 2575-87: collection of rims (2575-9) and bodysherds (2580-7) from same vessel from surface of bedrock on western side of enclosure. Ware contains numerous limestone and shale grits, some over 10mm long, protruding through rough outer face; inner face dark and smooth, sherds 10mm-12mm thick, rim has flat top which slopes inwards. Nos 2617-29: bodysherds of hard grey to creamy brown ware with large quantity of fine stone grits, average thickness 8mm. Nos 2617-18 have closely spaced ridges or cordons on outer face. Nos 2630-8: miscellaneous bodysherds. Nos 2639-63: from southern side of enclosure. Nos 2639-70: from Vessel 38, ware compact and smooth, creamy brown to dark externally, with dark core and inner surface, fine grits of quartzite and some limestone, although large grits, up to 6mm long, also occur. Body has average thickness of 10mm, rim rounded and vessel has a curved profile like that of Nos 13-15. Vessel 39 (2671-88): similar ware but outer face is worn, leaving rough and slightly gritty appearance. Inner surface is unusually smoothly finished and has burnt accretion, rim (2671) has flat inward-sloping top, body 10mm in average thickness. Nos 2689-98: from vessel of unusually compact dark to black ware, few stone grits, some protruding through inner face. Rim (2689-92). flared rather than everted with rounded top.

Lough Gur excavations 363 reasonably fine gritting of quartzite. Nos 2718-19: from large vessel of same type as No. 34. No. 2720: very compact ware with quite fine igneous or occasionally chert grits; very pale brown externally, grey core and inner surface. Nos 2721-6: from vessel of somewhat corky ware containing some large igneous grits; inner surface dark grey and well finished, outer reddish yellow. The sherds are 9mm-10mm thick. Nos 2727-37: bodysherds of very similar ware with occasional quartzite grits. Nos 2219-57: from indeterminate number of vessels of type represented elsewhere on site. Rims (2219-22, 2230-2); No. 2219: broad flat-topped; 2220-2: of similar form but narrower. No. 2220 is perforated; latter rims and bodysherds (2223-9) from vessel of dark, compact gritty ware. No. 2230: same ware, more rounded profile. No. 2231: rounded section, orange externally with dark core, pinched-up boss on outer face. No. 2232: same form as 2219-22 but contains shaly grits. No. 2233: bodysherd from close to rim of a vessel, also represented by 2234-6, which has broad horizontal channel on outer surface. Nos 2237-51, 2738-63: miscellaneous bodysherds. Beaker (Figs 20-1) (1253-7, 2795-843, 2252-84). Vessel 41 is the only one well represented, ware very like western neolithic pot (No. 40, see above) but has fewer cavities; gritting of fine quartzite, ware reddish yellow externally and brownish yellow internally. Rim (1253, 2795) flat topped with rounded edges with fringe of incised oblique strokes immediately beneath. Above and below waist are horizontal channels (2798-9). Although finger-nail impressions occur on 2797-800 the body of the vessel (1254-7, 2801-12) is plain; average thickness 5mm. Nos 2813-20: sherds from plain vessel of very smooth yellow to reddish yellow ware containing grog and very fine gritting of both quartzite and igneous rock. Profile of rim (2813) indicates slight eversion at mouth; belly angular (2814). Nos 2821-7: sherds from several vessels. Nos 2821-2: from neck of small plain pot; fine reddish yellow ware, pitted and 4.5mm thick. No. 2823 necksherd and 2824 bodysherd, from another small vessel, ware pink externally with grey core and pinkish white to grey inner surface; row of oblique stab-and-drag marks on 2823 with remains of two oblique rows of joining impressions beneath it; horizontal line of similar impressions on 2824. No. 2825: worn sherd with two horizontal lines on outer face. No. 2826a-b: plain worn bodysherds; 2827: from waist of another vessel. Nos 2828-43: part of large group of sherds (including 2796-810 and western neolithic vessel 40) found together in north-western area of enclosure. While most are clearly Beaker, 2828 in particular is more easily paralleled amongst western neolithic material. No. 2828 probably from immediately beneath shoulder of vessel like No. 40; good quality ware with pitted exterior; gritting of very fine igneous rock, but ware also contains some grog; outer face decorated with poorly incised and discontinuous horizontal lines. This pattern is repeated on 2829, which also has internal decoration in the form of haphazard cross-hatching, ware similar to that of 2828, but more like 2830, which has lines of well-executed but widely spaced and occasionally discontinuous comb decoration. Decoration similar to this occurs on 2831-2, but is of poorer quality and these sherds are thicker (11mm and 10mm respectively) and do not have the very smooth fine external finish of 2830. Remaining sherds (2833-42) undecorated. Nos 2840-2: basesherds. Others, all bodysherds, fall into two groups, those under 9mm thick, which are probably from the same vessel as 2830 and possibly 2829, and those lOmm-l 1mm thick, which may come from same pot as 2831 and 2832. Despite the decoration and the presence of grog, 2828 is probably from a western neolithic vessel. No. 2843: five fragments similar ware. Nos 2252-84: all from vessel types represented elsewhere on site. None is decorated. Nos 2252-8: same hard, fine red ware as 483-5b from high level in House 1 and E254: 390-400 from Site 10. No. 2252: flat-topped rim; 2253: from junction between body and base. Remainder bodysherds. Nos 2252 and 2254 show method of coil manufacture where the surface gives way abruptly to the exposed core which is smooth and irregular. Nos 2259-62: rims with rounded profile; 2263-4: from close to base of two separate vessels. Remainder bodysherds. Nos 2285-7: pieces of daub. Nos 2297-301: very worn sherds which may be Beaker. Beaker Domestic or Rusticated ware (2288-96 and 2844-50). All from vessels such as 25-7 already described. Nos 2288-9: decorated, possibly from one vessel. No. 2288 has three closely spaced vertical finger-nail impressions, while 2289 has three horizontal impressions set in a vertical band. No. 2290: rimsherd with rounded out-turned profile with facet on outer edge. Nos 2291-3: bodysherds from a vessel; average thickness 8mm. Nos 2844-50 and 2294-6: plain [Gil]</page><page sequence="66">364 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy bodysherds; 2851-2: pieces of daub. No. 2853 is a rim and 2854-5 are adjoining sherds from vessel of very hard brick-like ware; very fine gritting of both quartzite and igneous rock; sherds reddish to dark reddish brown externally and red to light red on inner surface; rim upright with pointed cross-section which curves downwards in concave facet to inner wall. Single off-vertical stroke on outer face immediately beneath rim; overall profile suggests bowl-shaped vessel; sherds uniformly 10mm thick; ware, firing and general shape of this vessel have no parallel at Lough Gur. Bronze (Fig. 22). Apart from No. 3091 (see below) all the bronze items came from the sod or immediately beneath it within (3092-3, 3096-7, 3100) or outside (3094-5, 3098-9, 3101) the enclosure. No. 3091: awl with round-sectioned body tapering from junction with tang to a point; tang square-sectioned (3mm by 3mm), 42mm long, but upper portion of tang is missing. From large natural hollow on north-western side of enclosure, 76cm deep in fill. Objects of this type were found at Sites C and D (6 Riordain 1954, 361, 411; figs 28: 4, 43: 1-3) and one (Site D. No. 1) came from an early stage of activity. While a disturbance of the fill through later activity cannot be completely ruled out, and although bronze and iron awls of this form are known from Early Christian contexts, as at Cahercommaun (Hencken 1938, 48; fig. 29: 512), the position of this piece indicates that it is broadly contemporary with House 2 and possibly the primary phase of use of the enclosure itself. Nos 3092a-d: four fragments of thin disc less than 1mm thick, original diameter about 33mm; decorated on one face with poorly incised design. This consists of irregular line concentric to and about 2mm in from edge. Occasionally this occurs as two lines. In centre of disc is a band of cross-hatched incision, which may terminate at a line around centre of disc enclosing an area 14mm in diameter (see 3092a, Fig. 22). No. 3093: small bronze 'toggle'-like object, 11.5mm long, with round cross-section; waisted in centre, where it is less than 3mm in diameter; ends 4mm thick and slightly expanded. Nos 3094-7: possibly fragments of pin stems. No. 3094: from close to tip; present length 28mm; round-sectioned body, 2.5mm in maximum thickness. No. 3095: short piece, possibly from stem of pin; surviving length 14mm; at one end rounded in section, at other a squat oval; maximum thickness 5mm. No. 3096 has a rectangular to lozenge-shaped cross-section; 15mm long and 3.5mm in maximum thickness. No. 3097: 19mm long, broken at both ends, mid section, flattened, a thin rectangle in section, while two ends are oval. No. 3098 may be portion of a pin stem, although the regular curve may suggest a bracelet. However, the estimated diameter of 8cm would seem to rule out the latter possibility; 30mm long with circular cross-section. No. 3099: part of finger ring, diameter 20mm. Cast decoration, six raised ridges separated by deep V-shaped channels, occurs on both faces. No. 3100: concave disc, 17mm in maximum diameter, with broken protrusion on under, convex, side. No portion of edge survives, so it may originally have been larger. While possibly the head of a pin, this object is more probably a button. Nos 3101-2: T-sectioned pieces of casting debris. Glass (Fig. 22). The card index for Circle K noted thirty-three beads or fragments, but only thirty-two of these (3103-34) could be located. Most of them came from the sod or a high level and were found in the north-eastern quadrant. They are blue/green or turquoise. All except 3134 are circular in outline, have a flattened oval profile and a cyclindrical opening. The cross section is a flattened D-shape. The diameter ranges from 5mm to 11mm and the perforations are 3mm-7mm wide. Five decorated examples (3103-7), of which 3103 and 3106-7 are incomplete; ornament consists of three regularly spaced oval motifs set on outer face of beads; decoration is in the form of well-defined U-sectioned channels filled with white paste. This survives partially on all the examples, but is almost intact on 3106-7. No. 3103, the most elaborate bead, has conical projections at the centre of each motif consisting of three concentric ovals each. Nos 3104-5 have two ovals in each design; 3106-7 have single outlines. On 3107 the area within each oval was fitted with what now appears as a gritty light brown paste. No. 3134: fragment of possible spherical bead with off-centre cylindrical perforation. Another fragment (3135) has a flat base and an hourglass-shaped profile. It may have been a mount or stud. Lignite (Fig. 22). Nos 3136-40: portions of five lignite bracelets. No. 3136 represents about a quarter of one bracelet with oval outline; diameter 6.2cm-7.6cm; rounded D-shaped cross - section,</page><page sequence="67">Grogan and Eogan ?

No. 3137: a slighter example, 8cm in diameter; more pointed section, 5mm wide and 5mm thick. Although less well preserved, 3138 is similar to 3136, 8.1cm in diameter, 7mm wide and 6mm thick. No. 3139 has oval cross-section, 6mm wide and 5mm thick and about 7cm in diameter. No. 3140: a small fragment from a bracelet, also with an oval cross-section, 6mm wide and 7mm thick. Lignite bracelet fragments were found at Sites C and D (O Riordain 1954, 354, fig. 26: 1-4; 410, fig. 43: 13). As two of those (Nos 1 and 2) from Site C came from beneath the gravel layer, O Riordain suggested that they were contemporary with the early activity there. Animal bones. About 866kg (1911 lbs) of animal bones came from Circle K, from throughout the interior of the enclosure, from the wall filling and from the area around House 1. The animals represented were cattle (c. 95 per cent of total number); pig (c. 3.5 per cent); sheep/goat (c. 1.5 per cent); and small numbers of horse, dog, fox, cat, hare, bear and bird bones (fowl, rook, marsh harrier, coot, greylag goose, duck and some fragments of domestic fowl). Some oyster shells were also recovered. Only selected samples of the bones were retained and these have been examined by van Wijngaarden-Bakker (1974, 371-5): Sheep/ Brown Wild Red Cattle Goat Horse Dog Bear Cat Deer Hare antler ? ? _ _ _ 3 _ skull - - _ 4 _ _ _ _ mandibula ? ? ? 3 ? ? ?

The bones from the other species found at prehistoric sites were usually kept (oral communication Professor M, J. O'Kelly). The presence of brown bear bones from the stone circle is mentioned by S. P. 6 Riordain (1954). The cat bones have been identified on archaeozoological grounds as Felis silvestris. Among the hare remains, seven bones have such a smooth uncorroded surface that they may be classified as 'modern' and four bones from a juvenile animal and therefore cannot be identified with certainty (van Wijngaarden-Bakker 1974, 371). House 2 (Figs 10, 23; Pis XI, XHIb) A three-sided arrangement of grass-covered stones, suggesting the presence of a rectangular structure, was visible before excavation (Pl. Xlb) a little to the south of the centre of the enclosure. The house was rectangular in plan with maximum dimensions of 8.20m north-east/south-west and 6.40m north-west/south-east (Fig. 23). It was constructed on a roughly level spread of limestone gravel ? the naturally weathered surface of the limestone bedrock?which formed the floor. Three sides were defined</page><page sequence="69">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 367 (D 0 ? Entrance \ 0 5 Metres Fig. 23 ?Circle K. House 2, ground plan. by post-holes and low wall footings. The north-eastern side consisted of a double row of large stones (about 45cm by 30cm) with an earthen packing. The stones were set on a small earthen bank about 25cm high. On the south-east was a single row of slightly larger stones (about 50cm by 35cm); those towards the northern end were set on a continuation of the earthen bank and those on the southern end were placed on a slight rock outcrop, also about 25cm in height. The south-western footing too consisted of a single line of stones and here knobs of outcrop were used as part of it. Post-holes were placed on both sides of these three walls, occasionally paired opposite each other on either side of the stone footing (e.g. 7, 8, 13, 14). The north-western</page><page sequence="70">368 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy wall was marked by a line of three post-holes (10-12) cut into the rock outcrop on this side. Two large holes (17, 18) positioned slightly north and east of the house centre may have held roof supports. The post-holes have maximum dimensions of 15cm-50cm wide and 13cm-48cm deep. The entrance was probably in the middle of the south eastern wall, where there was a gap 80cm wide in the wall footing. The house had no internal fireplace. There was no stratigraphical evidence to show that the house was contemporary with the enclosure; another structure, House 1, which was unprotected, also occurred on the site. Nevertheless the virtually central location of the house with its entrance facing that of the enclosure and the absence of any other structural evidence within the circle suggest that the house and enclosure form one integral phase on the site. Finds (Figs 21, 24) The finds came from throughout the house, but the majority were from the floor on the south-eastern side and very few occurred on the western side where the rock outcrop formed the old ground surface. Stone. There are eighteen artefacts or utilised pieces of flint and chert and only a small amount of waste, eight of flint (1663-70) and three of chert (all 1671). Nos 1645-6: arrowheads; 1645 lozenge-shaped; tip damaged, retouch of poor quality; only the butt of 1646, a fine leaf-shaped piece, survives. Both bifacially worked. Six scrapers (1647-52): all but 1652 are generally rounded and finely worked. No. 1649: thumb scraper. No. 1652: rectangular piece with working along one end and side. Nos 1653-4: roughouts for rounded scrapers. Two knives (1655-6): retouch along one long edge. No. 1657: blade. No. 1658: piece of pebble flint from which elongated flakes, possible blades, have been struck. Nos 1659-62: worked but do not belong to any artefact class (only 1662 is illustrated). Flint-1645, 1647, 1649-50, 1652, 1654-5, 1658, 1660-2; chert-1646, 1648, 1651, 1653, 1656-7, 1659. Axes (Fig. 21). No. 1672: large fragment of finely polished greenstone axe, blade well preserved and still sharp. Nos 1673-4: small chips; 1673 is from the axe represented by 56-8 from House 1. Beads (Fig. 21). Seven beads came from House 2, four stone (1675-8) and five bone examples (1679-81). No. 1675: D-shaped bead of 'serpentine', central hourglass perforation. No. 1676: oval example of mudstone; 1677: a similar bead of siltstone. Both have cylindrical perforations. No. 1678: part of oval siltstone piece with notched outline. No. 1679: barrel-shaped bone bead with circular cross-sectkm and oval perforation. Nos 1680a-b, 1681a: cylindrical or squat barrel shaped beads. No. 1680a has subrectangular cross-section, while 1680b and 1681a are oval. All have oval-sectioned perforations. No. 1681b: double-segmented bead with rectangular to oval cross-section; cylindrical perforation has similar section. Quartz (1682-93). Nos 1682-7 worked by removing long flakes from surface. Most are roughly triangular with sharp, unretouched edges and may have functioned as knives or scrapers. Remaining six pieces have no evidence of working but could represent waste from a manufacturing process. Pottery (Fig. 24). Only 137 sherds came from House 2. Clearly this area had been disturbed and some sherds from vessels in the house itself were found in the area immediately around it. Seventy-eight sherds of western neolithic pottery (1694-768) are from at least nine vessels, some of which are represented by fewer than five sherds. Nos 1694-6, 1700, 1712-13, 1720, 1729 are rims. No. 1694: rounded and everted with flared neck; ware hard, leathery and brown to dark.

No. 1728 has highly burnished outer surface, polishing occurs on edges of outer face, suggesting it was carried out after the pot was broken. Nos 1729-36: worn sherds of cream to buff ware with dusty texture; rim (1729) has pronounced out-turned angular profile. Neck flared and shoulder (1730-1) of slight step variety; average thickness 6mm-7mm. Nos 1737-8: also very worn sherds of red to brown ware. No. 1737 may be from neck of vessel, while 1739 may be part of shoulder with 'gutter'. Nos 1740-4: similar pitted ware.

Forty-nine sherds (1769-817) from at least three vessels. Vessel 28: four rims (1769-72) and eleven bodysherds (1773-83); ware compact, averaging 10mm thick, buff to dark containing crushed limestone grits. Vessel has flat-topped rim rounded into the walls, overall profile like that of Vessel 11. Diameter at mouth about 17cm. Perforations occur about lcm beneath rim on 1769 and at junction between 1770 and 1771. Vessel 29: two rims (1784-5), nine bodysherds (1786-94) and a further five sherds may also be from this pot (1795-9). Ware more friable than that of No. 28; buff exterior and grey to dark core and inner surface. Limestone grits protrude through outer face. Overall profile like that of previous vessel. Rim tends to be flat-topped; upright lug or handle with horizontal perforation applied to 1784. A break on top of 1785 has two opposed finger-nail impressions.

No. 1809: basesherd from vessel with numerous quartzite grits; 1810-19: miscellaneous bodysherds, probably from vessels represented above. There is a single rimsherd of hard, buff, almost gritless ware (1829) belonging to O Riordain's 'small cup" variety (1954, 327). There are only nine sherds of Beaker pottery (1820-8) (Fig. 24). Only 1820, a bodysherd probably from Vessel 24, is decorated. It is from the same part of the body as 1232-3. No. 1821: undecorated rimsherd with somewhat flat top and slight outward expansion, core red with dark surface containing quartzite and shale grits. No. 1822: basesherd, ware buff with calcite grits; 1823: from junction between base and body of another vessel. Remainder bodysherds of good quality ware well represented in vicinity of House 1. Burials Two burials, Nos 8 and 9, came from the floor of House 2 (Figs 17, 23; Pis XIVb,c). Burial 8 was contained in a shallow pit or hollow, 46cm by 23cm, near north-eastern wall, aligned east/west with head towards west. Skeleton on back with head turned slightly to left, arms by the sides and legs extended close together. The crushed skull rested against rectangular limestone block, 30cm by 15cm, but burial otherwise undisturbed. Dr Inkster reported that the remains made up 'practically the whole of a young child in the early part of the first year of life or about the time of birth'. No grave-goods. Burial 9 was orientated north-west/south-east with head to north-west; extended on back with skull, which rested against rock outcrop on western side of house, turned to right. Burial contained in shallow pit and covered an area 40cm by 22cm; lower limbs and pelvis were separated from upper part of body by about 8cm, owing to some</page><page sequence="73">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 371 disturbance. One half of the pelvis lay by right femur, other half and several vertebrae found around right tibia. Dr Inkster reported that 'the pieces of bone present include most of the skeleton of a young child. Some pieces of the laminae of the neural arches have fused indicating that the age can be placed somewhere in the first year of life. The petromastoid is partly fused with the temporal squama, a process which also takes place during the first year'. The dental report indicated that the mandible and teeth are from a child about four months old. No grave-goods, but small fragments of burnt animal bone and charcoal were found over the body. Finds from outside the enclosure A small number of finds come from outside the enclosure (2865-3077). Some may have been derived from the pre-enclosure activity but others belong to the enclosure or post-enclosure phase. In no case was it possible to relate them directly to the sequence on the main part of the site. Stone (Fig. 25). There are twenty pieces offlint and chert (2865-79 and 3071a-4). Nos 2865-73, 307lab are artefacts, 2865 and 3071a are well-made round scrapers, and 2866 is a similar unfinished or broken piece; 3071b is a knife or side scraper; 2867 is a damaged example with a plano-convex longitudinal section; 2868-9 are unfinished knives; 2870-2 are blades, some retouch along one edge of 2870 of which only the mid-section survives. No. 2873: elongated triangular artefact with long flakes removed from ventral face; 3073 has some slight retouch along one edge. Remaining pieces (2874-9, 3073-4) are waste. Flint-2867, 2870-2, 2874, 2876, 2878, 3071a, 3074; chert-2865-6, 2868-9, 2873, 2875, 2877, 2879, 3071b-3073. No. 3077: large, somewhat crude axe of siltstone, cutting edge broken, flattened oval section thinning to narrow, pointed butt. No. 2880: butt of finely made rhyolite axe, oval cross-section with facets along both edges. Extreme tip missing, but it may have been pointed. No. 2881: mid section of similar greenstone axe. No. 2882: large chip from axe of same material, some evidence of retouch, suggesting it may have been used as scraper. No. 2883: small chip of greenstone. No. 3070: fragment of flat stone bead of grey-black siltstone. Quartz crystal. Nos 2884-9, 3075-6: 2884-5 may be simple blades; remainder are broken fragments. No. 2890: bone scoop or gouge, 7.7cm long, worn and broken at one end. (See Appendix C). Pottery. There are eighteen sherds (2891-2908) of western neolithic pottery (Fig. 25). Rims 2891-4. No. 2895: shoulder, remainder bodysherds. No. 2891: rounded and everted, comes from a finely made vessel of very hard, dark grey ware with crushed quartzite grits. Nos 2892-4: grey to light grey abrasive ware containing quartzite grits; rounded everted profiles. No. 2895: shouldersherd of small step variety, surface is pitted but ware compact and vessel was well made. Colour varies from light red to dark reddish brown. Nos 2896-8 may be bodysherds from a single pot, average thickness 7mm. Nos 2899-903: bodysherds of ware similar to previous group but with average thickness of 4mm. Nos 2904-8: miscellaneous bodysherds. Coarse flat-bottomed ware (2909-3050) from at least seven vessels (Fig. 25). Vessel 41 (2909-65): large pot with diameter at base of about 19cm, ware crumbly, very like that of Vessel 10, but containing numerous igneous grits up to 6mm long. Outer surface smooth but irregular and only a comparatively small number of mainly fine grits protrude, texture dusty. No rims but base (2909-12) has upright foot about 17mm high. From here the body curves outwards. At some point higher up there is a sharp bend in the wall which may have given the vessel a biconical profile, although it is equally possible that the bend occurred just beneath the rim. Average thickness of wall 14mm. Vessel 42 (2966-93): has upright or slightly flared profile with diameter at mouth of about 26cm. Ware light reddish brown containing large quantity of quartzite grits up to 9mm long. Grits appear on both surfaces but do not protrude and vessel has smooth, regular and slightly dusty appearance. Ware of this vessel and bodysherds 2994-3003 are like that of Vessels 16 and 36. Rim of Vessel 42 rounded with irregular inward expansion on 2966-7, which is a result of folding over the top. Wall has an average thickness of 11mm.</page><page sequence="74">372 Proceedings of the Royal Irish A cademy mil' \ III \ ^ ^^ 3071a 3071b ll'r ^ "" \ lljp'V Q&amp; ikj^^y V ^g$ f W\\ : ? if/ * V^IS tF\3 MM'-.' _f W V^-^ ^# Mfcv. -: p V w so" 2894 "i- 2893 2895 ^mg^maW :^^ W' 3004 2909 2913 2966 Ji * * I .# ^| #1 W 3032 3041 30433044 3057 3058 3025 3011-3015 _?_____B_i 3in 305g 3060* ~~~ 534 535 _-h&gt; 536 ^^ Fig. 25- Circle K.

Lough Gur excavations 373 Nos 3004-10: compact ware containing small quantity of igneous grits, possibly from Vessel 18 which was found in same area. Nos 3004-5: basesherds with rounded foot; base clearly made as separate disc from which wall was built up. Nos 3011-15 are from base (3011) or close to base of pot whose inner surface is very dark grey. Both faces smooth, and small number of igneous grits do not appear on surface. Nos 3016-24: bodysherds of very compact ware containing large quantity of igneous grits; in some places surface has fallen away exposing very gritty core. Where the surface survived it is evenly finished with an abrasive texture. Average thickness 14mm. Nos 3025-40: friable, heavily oxodised ware containing igneous grits. No. 3025: pointed rim with concave inward bevel; cylindrical perforation through sherd just below bevel. Nos 3031-2: also rims; 3031 has pointed profile while 3032 has flat inward bevel.

There are thirteen sherds of Beaker (3057-69) (Fig. 25), of which 3057-8 are decorated bodysherds. No. 3057 has worn horizontal lines of broad comb; 3058 has a row of closely spaced vertical finger-nail impressions. No. 3059: rim with flat inward bevel; 3060 has rounded top with cylindrical perforation immediately beneath it. Nos 3061-5: plain bodysherds. Nos 3067-9: plain sherds of Beaker Domestic ware. Nos 3067-8 from neck of a single vessel. Finds from vicinity of House 1 A large amount of material came from the vicinity of House 1 outside the enclosure wall. Some of this was clearly deposited after the construction of the enclosure as a number of pottery vessels, mainly of Beaker and Rusticated Beaker but also some western neolithic and coarse flat bottomed ware, only occur outside the wall. The activity from which the material is derived may, however, have taken place within Circle K, in which case the area around the earlier house could have been used as a refuse dump. Stone (Figs 25-6). Fourteen artefacts or utilised pieces of flint and chert came from the vicinity of the house. There was only a small amount of waste, ten pieces (weighing 38g), all of flint (548-57). Projectile heads: three examples (534-6), all arrowheads, only upper part of 534 survives; poor quality working on both faces. No. 535: very fine bifacially worked example, tip missing. No. 536: roughout for another leaf-shaped arrowhead with some working on both faces. No. 537: scraper made from outer portion of irregular flint pebble with good quality retouch along one edge; 538: a somewhat oval piece with working on one long side. No. 539: a point, possibly broken off tip of an arrowhead roughout. No. 540: small knife or blade; 541-2: blades. Nos 543-7 are utilised pieces although retouch only occurs on 543-4. Flint?534, 537-9, 541-7; chert-535-6, 540. Axes (Fig. 26). Nos 558-9: conjoining fragments from coarse-grained granite axe also represented by pieces from other parts of site. It has a pointed butt with oval cross-section and narrow facet along one edge (558). No. 561, on which two facets form a pointed edge, may be from close to the blade. No. 562: large fragment; 563 chip from fine-grained greenstone axe. A number of chips like 563 have been removed from 562, leaving only one small area of original surface on each side; two other pieces from this axe found in vicinity of House 2 (2368-9). No. 564: chip from fine-grained greenstone axe with highly polished but irregular surface. No. 565: chip from axe similar to that represented by 49a-b and 50 from House 1.

Small vessel (about 12cm in diameter at the mouth) with average thickness of 6mm. Rounded out-turned rim set at right angles to upright neck, while shoulder is formed by simple angle. Removal of grits from upper portion of vessel prior to smoothing and firing resulted in pitted or corky appearance, but the rest of outer surface is smooth and buff to black. Vessel 8 has only four sherds surviving (667-70), rim set at sharp angle to neck and is slightly rounded. Lip along outside of junction between neck and rim where wall was folded over to form the rim itself. No. 671: shoulder of small type, may be from the same vessel; ware of good quality, containing quartzite and calcite grits, is consistently smooth and even; walls 5mm thick. Nos 672-4: two rims and a shouldersherd from vessel similar to No. 7 with rounded out-turned rim, curved neck and medium step shoulder of good quality red to buff ware containing quartzite grits. No. 676: part of flat-topped, strongly everted rim, 18mm wide; 667 is portion of shoulder sherd from same pot. Nos 676 and 667-8 are most closely paralleled amongst decorated western neolithic pottery at Lough Gur. Vessel 9 (677-91): rounded and slightly everted rim (677-8) and simple angle shoulder (679-82); ware buff to grey, containing quartzite grits; 6mm in average thickness. Nos 692-4: rounded and slightly everted rims of smooth, good quality black ware; bodysherds 695-8 of similar ware and probably from vessel or vessels represented by the rims. No. 699: necksherd with part of the shoulder of vessel of good thin (5mm) ware containing high quantity of crushed quartzite grits; 1140-5: bodysherds possibly from the same vessel. Nos 1131-2: a rim- and bodysherd, from large vessel with walls 12mm thick; rim has flat top with outward-sloping facet and neck is upright; ware hard, well fired and smooth with some quartzite, and buff to dark. No. 1133: necksherd from very similar vessel but only 8mm thick. No. 1134, worn shoulder of the small step type, grey dusty ware with crushed quartzite grits; 1135-6: shouldersherds from vessel similar to No. 3. No. 1137: bulbous everted rim of orange/buff ware containing calcite grits. No. 1138: worn angular everted rim, cream to buff, hard ware containing quartzite grits. Necksherd (1139): from vessel like that represented by 672-4, while 1146-58 are bodysherds similar to 675-6. Nos 115972c: miscellaneous worn bodysherds. Miscellaneous decorated pottery (Fig. 32): ten sherds representing two vessels. Nos 1634-8: friable, heavily gritted grey to black neolithic ware, applied outer face; decoration consists of whipped cord impressions apparently set in triangles. Although the ware is of much poorer quality the decoration can be compared with that on a small group of sherds from Circle L (E253: 2500-3, Fig. 32). This form of ornament also occurs on vessels from Ballyaiton, Co. Down, and Rath, Co. Wicklow (Case 1961, figs 13: 2; 18: 2). Nos 1639-43: compact, finely gritted reddish-ye How ware; decoration consists of much worn horizontal grooves, possibly broad impressed comb; possibly from a food vessel. Four hundred and ninety-two sherds of coarse flat-bottomed ware (Class II) came from the area immediately above and around the house (Fig. 27). They represent at least fifteen vessels, some of which have already been described in the section dealing with the finds from the house itself. Of the eight well-represented vessels associated with activity in the vicinity of the house, four are also represented by a small number of sherds derived from the habitation layer in the house itself, again indicating that some disturbance of this material took place, perhaps when the enclosure wall was being constructed. Vessel 15: represented by forty-eight sherds, eight from the house (375-82) and forty from the vicinity (720-52, 1092-8); ware well fired with smooth but irregular surface very like that of Nos 13-14; cream/buff to black containing limestone grits. Vessel has upright profile and pinched-up flat-topped rim; average thickness 9mm. Vessel 16: 127 sherds, weighing 860g, of which 117 (753-866, 1082-3) are from the area around the house and ten (383-92) are from the house floor. A large, heavy vessel of crumbly cream to grey or black ware, containing numerous quartzite and calcite grits up to 6mm long. Outer surface smooth, although grits appear on the surface, while the inside is pitted as a result of poorer finishing. Profile upright with pointed to round rim with inward bevel and lip at junction with the wall. Average thickness of sherds llmm-14mm.

Outside buff, inner blackened and core black to grey. No rimsherds, but the pot is very like No. 10. Base made as separate disc onto which body was applied (1017). Average thickness of wall 11 mm-12mm. Sherds 398-400 from the house are of similar ware but from another vessel. Vessel 21: represented by thirteen sherds (1032-44) of which 1041-4 are from the house. Similar to No. 20, but ware is slightly coarser and consistently thinner (9mm-llmm). Flat-topped rim slopes inwards slightly; flat base (1033) of same type as No. 20; 1034-5 show the method of joining the base and body. Vessel22: represented by at least thirteen sherds (1049-61). A base- (1062) and seven bodysherds (1063-9) may also be part of it. Ware hard and compact with small quartzite and calcite grits; walls 7mm-9mm thick but thicken towards rim, which has flat, inward-sloping top. This vessel is similar to No. 14. Nos 1045-8: from small, poorly made and preserved vessel containing stone and calcite grits; rim flat-topped with inward slope. Where best preserved both faces are smooth but blackened and irregular. Average thickness of wall 7mm. Nos 1070-3: bodysherds of good quality smooth ware from vessel of same type as that represented by 401 from the house; average thickness 12mm.

Nos 1618-20: from body of same vessel. Nos 1621-4: brown to orange containing limestone and quartzite grits. Three pieces of daub (1625-7) suggest that some pottery was manufactured on the site. There are 175 sherds of Beaker pottery (1213-381, Figs 28-30). The sixty-five sherds from the upper level of the house itself (469-533) are described with them in this section (Fig. 27). As many as fifteen vessels may be represented, of which at least eleven are decorated. There are seven pieces of daub (531a-d, 1372a-c). One surface of 1372a, which contains quartzite grits, is covered in impressions and had been kneaded between the thumb and forefinger with the thumb-nail pressed into the concave face. No. 1382 is a small cone of gritless red daub, 13mm long, which had been rolled between the thumb and finger. Vessel 23: Bell Beaker with soft S-shaped profile (1213-21), with regular spaced bands of horizontal decoration; ware orange to buff throughout, containing grog and finely crushed quartzite grits. Average thickness of sherds 6mm; vessel has diameter at mouth of about 12cm. The rim is rounded.

Nos 1271-6: dusty buff ware with dark core, containing grog and finely crushed quartzite grits; decoration consisting of an irregular incised line with a frill of oblique stab-marks beneath it. On 1275 the stabs are in the opposite direction to those on the other sherds. Nos 471 and 1277-81: bodysherds of the same ware; 471 and 1277 are undecorated while 1278-81 have lines of comb decoration. Nos 1282-3 have incised line ornament, are of similar ware but with considerably larger grits. No. 1290: small sherd of hard buff ware 5mm thick; one discontinuous and three complete lines of incision with two stab-marks below. No. 1291, while only 4mm thick, is in ware and decoration the same as 1290. Nos 1292-3, buff ware with dark core and finely crushed quartzite grits, are from different vessels with similar impressions. Decoration on 1293 similar but less well executed. Nos 1294-6: from neck of vessel of buff, well-fired ware containing large quartzite grits; all have lightly incised decoration. No. 1284: poorly preserved, slightly everted rim of abrasive buff ware with black core and quartzite grits; two very worn lines on the outer surface. No. 1285: similar ware, containing grog and has lines of comb. Nos 1286-7: bodysherds of buff ware with black core, containing grog and crushed limestone grits. No. 1288: orange sherd with calcite grits, has two closely spaced lines of broad comb with blank and a third beneath the other two. No. 1289: abrasive red ware with calcite grits with two worn and widely spaced lines of ornament. There are three bodysherds (1298-300) with three lines of large comb impressions from a vessel of buff dusty ware with a buff to dark core; 9mm thick. The three decorated basesherds from this area (472-3, 1297) represent three separate vessels. No. 472: well-fired orange ware containing grog and finely crushed quartzite grits; decoration consists of three lines of comb. Body swells out sharply from base. No. 473: buff ware with some large limestone grits up to 6mm long, forms an angle of about 45? with the wall; single incised groove lcm from the foot. No. 1297 has similar profile and decorative features but is of cream to buff ware with a dark core and quartzite grits. Nos 476-529, 532a, 532b, 533 and 1301-70: at least five undecorated vessels. Nos 1301-3: worn everted rims of buff ware with dark core. No. 1304: from vessel with flared profile of hard buff ware with grey core, while 474 and 1305 have pointed to somewhat flattened tops. Both average 9mm in thickness but 1305 is coarser and contains large quartzite and calcite grits. No. 1306: portion of pointed everted rim of fine ware with crushed quartzite and calcite grits. Nos 1307 and 475: from junction between neck and body of the same vessel; 1308 from body immediately beneath junction. Nos 1309-16: bodysherds, probably from this pot. No. 1317 rim and 1318-20 from body of a vessel with flared neck; ware hard and red containing quartzite grits. Nos 476-82 and 1322: thin, well fired with quartzite and calcite grits; brownish red. Nos 476-7 from neck and 478 may be from base. Nos 479-82: bodysherds. Nos 483-4 and 1323: basesherds from vessel of very fine red ware containing crushed quartzite grits and grog. Nos 485a-b and 1324: from body of the same vessel which can be closely compared with E254: 390-400 from Site 10. There is a shallow groove on the inner face of 1324. No. 1325: hard red ware with crushed quartzite grits, has small cavities in both faces; from vessel with slightly flared neck and everted rim. While the profile is most easily paralleled amongst the western neolithic pottery from Lough Gur, the ware is quite clearly Beaker. Nos 1326-8: flat basesherds, probably from this vessel, while 486-8 and 1329-30 are bodysherds of very similar ware. A further eighty-three undecorated Beaker bodysherds come from the house (489-529) and the area immediately above and around it (1331-70, 1373-4). Nos 530 and 1371: eighteen fragments or badly worn sherds. Nos 1375a-f and 1376-9: bodysherds of coarser, abrasive ware from more than one vessel. Nos 532a-b, 533 and 1373 are rims and 1374 a bodysherd from small bowl-shaped pots similar to those described by O Riordain as 'small cups' (1954, 327). The ware of these sherds is identical to that amongst the Beaker, is orange to brownish, and contains finely crushed quartzite. These pots are smoother and more evenly made than O Riordain's examples and are at Circle K clearly related to the Beaker assemblage. Domestic or Rusticated Beaker (Figs 30-1). 154 sherds from the area above and around House 1 (1389-92 and 1394-1543) and seven from a high disturbed level in the floor of the house itself (1383-8, 1393); from at least three vessels.

Limestone is occasionally present. The pottery has a dusty texture and, although generally smooth, lipped cavities occur on a number of sherds. The colour is brownish, but a rust or orange tinge is common. Some sherds have a slightly irregular outer surface; the thickness varies from 8mm-14mm. Vessel 25: represented by seventy-four sherds, seven from the house (1383-8, 1393) and sixty seven from the area around it (1389-92, 1394-1456) is a large pot with a flat-topped rim (1383, 1395-8), long curved neck (1400-8) and a flat base (1384, 1409-10). It has a single row of bird bone impressions on the rim top and two horizontal rows on the interior immediately beneath it. A number of rectangular stab marks occur on the outer face near the rim. On 1400 these are set in two slightly curved rows but on 1401-5 they appear as opposed oblique pairs. A few sherds from the body of the vessel have occasional and apparently haphazard finger-nail and other impressions (1411-16). A group of seventeen sherds (1457-73) of orange to brown dusty ware with grey to dark core may be from close to the base of this pot. Vessel 26 (1474-520): represented by forty-seven sherds. Ware identical to that of No. 25 but the pot is smaller and lighter with wall 7mm-8mm thick. Rounded to slightly flattened rim (1474-8) thickens towards neck, which has an open profile. Thumb-nail impressions occur haphazardly along the outer face about lcm beneath the rim. There is internal decoration of two irregular lines of light and vertical thumb-nail impressions immediately beneath the rim of 1474. Beneath this is a faint horizontal incised line. A slightly curved channel, probably accidentally caused by a thumb-nail, cuts across the line. No. 1475 has a motif similar to that of 1474. Although no decoration is visible on 1476-8 these are worn and any original design may have been erased. No. 1479, from close to the rim, has two oblique thumb-nail impressions on the outside and a single vertical impression with a shallow horizontal groove beneath it internally. Nos 1480-1 are similarly ornamented. The vessel has a flat base (see 1482-3) and a slightly angular profile (1484). No. 1521 is a plain bodysherd possibly from this pot. Vessel 27 (1522-41): represented by twenty sherds, similar ware to Nos 25-6 but sherds are consistently thicker (up to 12mm) and the pot was less well made. Rim (1522-5) rounded and neck flared. There are paired finger-nail impressions on the outer face of 1522 and haphazardly placed stab-marks on 1525. Two bodysherds (1533-4) have what may be impressions, again on the outside. The vessel has a flat base (1526-8). Nos 1542-3 are very worn sherds, possibly from this pot. Clay moulds (Fig. 32). Six fragments of a mould, or moulds, came from a high level outside the enclosure on the north-eastern side (1628-33). Four pieces (1628-31) retain part of the innermost layer of clay, i.e. the portion that would have been in contact with the metal. It has a sandy texture and is baked to a grey colour. Outside this is a second envelope of light red sandier clay. Nos 1628-9 retain part of the matrix, which has a slightly concave cross-section with a more marked curve on one edge. The overall width of the object was about 34mm at this point. It is impossible to tell with any certainty what type of object was cast in the mould but it may have been a sword. If so this type of cross-section is most likely to have occurred towards the end of the Bronze Age, probably during the Dowris phase (Eogan 1964, 293-323; 1965). Nos 1632-3 have two layers, the second envelope present on the other four and a third outer* casing which is light red and more sandy. Remarks There were two main phases at Circle K, the first consisting of an unprotected house and the second of an enclosed habitation site. There was no evidence for any discontinuity or a time-lapse between the two phases. The earlier house, No. 1, and the area immediately around it were associated with western neolithic (35 per cent) and coarse flat-bottomed pottery (55 per cent). (All percentages are based on sherd counts.) While some Beaker came from this area, it was all at a high level and was almost certainly intrusive. After the house had gone out of use the enclosure wall was constructed. This necessitated the erection of a gravel bank over the hollow in which House 1 had stood to provide a level foundation for the wall of the circle. The bulk of the pottery from the wall fill, which was derived from the pre-enclosure occupation,</page><page sequence="86">384 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy 1628 1?W 1630 1?32 1633 __5 I W91 f*_P I ^ _^w 1634 1636 1635 p638 1639 ?54o 1641 ^12^ I -/:\ ;;J\ 608 2514-2618 &lt;y^\*?mW \ ^^-?_?_^?_ \ ^---"' Fig. 32-Circle K.

Small cup' from pre-enclosure activity (2514-15). was coarse flat-bottomed ware (93 per cent) but there was also some western neolithic pottery (6 per cent) and three sherds of Beaker, which appeared to be intrusive. Some rebuilding of the wall is evident on the northern side and it is probable that other repairs took place during its period of use. The central house, No. 2, was constructed in a similar manner to Site A and the second phase was Site B (6 Riordain 1954, figs 1, 6). The assemblage from the house included western neolithic (57 per cent), coarse flat-bottomed (36 per cent) and Beaker pottery (7 per cent). In the enclosed area generally the respective quantities were 13 per cent, 66 per cent and 20 per cent. The later activity in the vicinity of House 1 was associated with a much greater amount of Beaker (40 per cent) and this accounted for 78 per cent of all the Beaker at Circle K. While western neolithic pottery (13 per cent) and coarse flat-bottomed ware (44 per cent) also came from this area the activity</page><page sequence="87">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 385 here clearly post-dated the construction of the wall and may represent a third, post enclosure, phase of habitation. A large number of glass beads came from the upper levels on the site. While 6 Riordain (1954, 354-8) suggested that those from Site C could belong to the Neolithic/Early Bronze Age settlement, more recent evidence indicates that in Ireland they are unlikely to be earlier than the Later Bronze Age. The closest parallels for the Circle K example and the two decorated beads from Site C (1954, 358) came from the excavations at Rathgall, Co. Wicklow (Barry Raftery, personal communication). Dr Raftery has kindly allowed us to compare the material from the two sites (see Appendix D). The Rathgall beads, some of which are stratified in the later Bronze Age levels, are of the same size, colour and ornamentation as those from Circle K. However, it may be noted that 6 Riordain (1954, 354-8) compared the Site C examples to beads from fourteenth-century b.c. contexts in Egypt and a possibly early Iron Age site at Grotte Landric, Aveyron, France. The presence of clay mould fragments on the site, which may also be dated to the Later Bronze Age, is particularly significant in view of the evidence of the glass beads. Later Bronze Age activity occurred at other sites, for example at Site F, and, more pertinent in this case, at Site C (6 Riordain 1954, 415-25, 321-84). Another feature of the Circle K assemblage was the relatively large amount of copper or bronze. As with the glass and mould fragments, these pieces were all, with the exception of the small awl (3091), from a high level on the site. The awl may be contemporary with the enclosure phase but the possibility of its later intrusion cannot be discounted. Simple implements of this type have a very long history in Ireland with examples dating to sites from the Early Bronze Age, as at Carrickinab, Co. Down (Collins and Evans 1968), to the Early Christian period, as at Cahercommaun, Co. Clare (Hencken 1938). While it is not impossible that some copper artefacts could have been acquired by Late Neolithic people at Lough Gur, it is far more likely that these were introduced onto this site at a later period. The awl might be as early as the Beaker period but, like the other pieces, it may be contemporary with the glass beads at a time when some bronze casting apparently occurred on the site. Circle L (Figs 33-60; Pis XVI-XIXa) This is an enclosed habitation site. Two main phases of activity are represented. In the first an open settlement was associated with three broadly contemporary houses. In the second phase the site was enclosed by a double-kerbed wall and a central house was constructed over the remains of one of the earlier structures. Circle L is on the south-eastern side of the peninsula overlooking the marshland that was probably once part of the lake (Fig. 1, Pl. I; OS 6" Limerick sheet 32, 13.9cm from N, 20.8cm from W). Before excavation it appeared as a poorly defined circle of stones, in places seemingly double like Circles J and K, and was most clearly visible on the north-eastern side (Pl. XVI). The enclosure was constructed in a sheltered position on a naturally level platform extending out from a limestone outcrop forming a low cliff. Many of the stones of the enclosure, particularly at the south-west, were completely covered with earth and moss and, as Windle remarked, it had the 'appearance of a grass-covered wall, and more resembles the mound of a small rath than a stone circle' (1912-13, 301). Circle L was excavated in 1951. Almost all the interior was investigated using a grid of 3m squares with a 4m-long cutting extended through the wall on the northern side and a 10m cutting at the west. The excavation grid was laid out with conventional north 13? west of true north.</page><page sequence="88">00 ^SHS__"'**^-L_*"'* **** *t^v^ &gt;JS^ &gt;*' -' -; ' %s'**l:'' **---* *' " j^ 3*1*1^^-*t ^, j* ^^Kdiifej^^ftiB^g^Kl^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ".^t^StlaP_*^r1^?!l_ '. * ,__- ***-"-* **?* . -? ... * * D , ? _*_BMM____Wl_il8|j^^ ^ ' - T" 'TKiT -?iiif^:^**^ " ' * r .JBf ^_ .- ?? ^ , ^ .. _I__BM__BBOB_Md-^?'-'- - ^wtt^^ ilil1"', 7 '' &amp;*.* ._? __&amp;__B&amp; ^ ~____i_______________l_S@ ' - __l &amp;* l%__ft^^Hi)^__^__^__^__^__^__^__E!i^^ :^HIHi^^H^^^^^^^^^BiA________________________ ______________________________R___________________P____________B_B^ - _l ""^ ** iii__^^^ _.**"1*^r^- ^' * # ^ -"X ^* - mr w ^r^*"* iJta. *____ __*&amp;_ * _**_&amp; " '. __.

Pre-enclosure activity (Figs 33-54; XVIIa, b) Intensive occupation was evidenced by a large number of post-holes, pits, hearths and areas of burning on the old ground level. These were concentrated in the centre of the area later enclosed (Figs 33-4) and, although no formal house plan could be discerned, it is clear that a structure or structures stood here. The number and extent of these features, including sixty-five post- or stake-holes, suggest that several stages of rebuilding or remodelling are represented. The greatest concentration of features occurs to the north of the main activity centre in squares 17, 21 and 30 (Fig. 35: Possible House A; Pl. XVIIb). These cover an area 6m by 5m. On the eastern side is a double arc of post-holes, 1, 13, 18 and 19 on the inner line and 14-17 on the outer. Further north the outer line appears to be continued by 25 and 27-9, while 26 and</page><page sequence="90">388 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy g^^D^^^nStickyay, CiPCteWaM "^^^^^^^^^^'^^^^^^^^^^^^^^vtr^ ^4*rown Earth with Stones Brown Earth with Stones l\^ yPjt? yYcV.ow/ Grey Stony Packing Stong^flj^^ X. 0 4 metres ? _ ?

If these features do represent the outline of a house ? and only the eastern group are completely convincing?then the structure would have been oval or roughly circular with a maximum external diameter of about 7.5m. Within it there may be concentric lines of post-holes, one about 5.5m across (11, 12, 2, 50-5) and another about 3.5m across (5, 6, 3, 4, 9, 10, 36-45, 49), which may represent rings of roof supports around the central triangular area of burning, which measured 2.5m by 2.35m (Fireplace 1). It must be stressed that this is a speculative attempt to present a logical scheme for the large number of post-holes in this area. A number of other post- ana stake-holes occurred, including a small arc in the north eastern corner (31-4). There were seven pits within this general area, six on the eastern side (Nos 2, 2a and 3-6) and one to the west (No. 7). Small patches of burning occurred to the west of the fireplace while other patches along the eastern perimeter are reminiscent of the burning in the wall at Site A which 6 Riordain (1954, 302) suggested might have resulted from fire damage to that house. The number of finds from the area around the structure was limited; only about 150 pot sherds were recovered. Some sherds of western neolithic (98, 105, 331, 365) and Beaker pottery (1354) came from an unspecified post-hole in sq. 30. Hearth 1 (Fig. 35), within the central area of activity, consisted of a 60cm deposit of charcoal and ash, which was between and over large stones. The initial use of the hearth was on the old ground surface but it was evidently in use throughout the early phase of occupation. Sherds of western neolithic ware (64-5, 201, 276, 329, 337) and coarse flat-bottomed ware (838, 854-5, 866-9) came from throughout the deposit and Beaker pottery was also present at a high level (1296, 1322, 1356-9, 1363-4, 1408-9). The hearth was overlain by and separated from the later central house by a layer of blackish gravelly earth.</page><page sequence="91">Grogan and Eogan?Lough Gur excavations 389 ,.? * _ 1 ^- i__ _? ; *"* i? ^_^^^ &gt;-v F Central House^lirst phase) Meant* i ^ ^ A(^\. c_ Jn ... &lt;g,CSg _fciK " (10 yft?3 _ ?,______) NC" ** I \ - +Possible House B "'-1 Ml ph.

While the find index suggests this feature was in sq. 7 there is no reference to it in the field notebook nor is it on the ground plan. However, an area of burning in sq. 6 (Fig. 35: Fireplace 2) is described; it contained these types of pottery. It seems reasonable to consider these as one feature, that referred to in sq. 6. This fireplace was in use initially on the old ground surface and continued in use throughout the early phase of occupation. The western neolithic pottery came from this level. During its period of use the focus on the fireplace moved north-eastwards (only its position on the subsoil is shown in Fig. 35). Later, probably after the construction of the enclosure, it was replaced by another fireplace abutting the paving associated with the house (see below). Although some of the Beaker pottery came from immediately beneath the paving, most came from the higher level. Another concentration of features, Possible House B, occurred on the southern side of the site on the old ground surface (Fig. 35). Two sides of what may have been a circular or subrectangular structure are represented by post-holes 79-85 on the western side and 97-100 to the south. The southern side also had an irregular trench, which may also have been part of a house. Within this area was a line of posts (91-5) and two areas of burning, one towards the western side and the other near the site. If these features do represent a house, its maximum width was about 6.5m. The area yielded seventy-seven sherds of western neolithic pottery, including sherds from Vessels 6, 7, 11-12. There were thirty-three sherds of coarse flat-bottomed ware (902-34), including sherds from Vessels 22-3, and nineteen sherds of Beaker (1379-86, 1389, 1391, 1393-1400, 1412). Finds (Figs 36-54) A considerable amount of material came from the level of the possible houses. The main concentration occurred to the south of Possible House A in the vicinity of the Central House (sqs 1, 6-9, 11, 16, 23) with significant quantities to the north (sqs 3, 4) and in the area around Possible House B (sqs 25-9). Unfortunately no find cards for Circle L have survived and the only details available were those on the bags containing the pottery. The information is reasonably comprehensive, but regrettably many of the labels are now indecipherable, hence the number of sherds from an unknown context (see below). Finds from the central area (Figs 36-9; Pis XV, XVIIa) Beads. A collection of beads, twenty-six of stone (1906-31) and twenty-one of bone (1932-52), were found together in an apparently undisturbed position on the old ground surface on the eastern side of the site (Pl. XVIIa). These evidently formed a necklace. The two materials were mixed and do not appear to have been graduated according to size. The beads rested on a slight step in the yellow clay. Charcoal and disintegrated western neolithic pottery were mixed through the find, which was covered by the habitation layer and stones. The stone beads vary in size and shape but two basic forms can be recognised, those with an irregular or notched outline and those that are roughly circular. All except 1931 (see below), which is of black siltstone, are of grey-black siltstone. They are flat with a smooth finish. The perforations vary from almost conical or cylindrical borings made from one side to more specific hourglass forms. They range from 55.4mm (1906) to 16.3mm (1923) long and from 36.7mm (1925) to 16mm (1923) wide. They are 3.5mm-8mm thick. The first group varies from those with a slightly irregular outline, such as 1907 and 1912, to those with a distinctive notching on both sides, giving a tripartite division of the bead, like 1915 and 1918. These pieces have an anthropomorphic shape. No. 1931 is a cylindrical bead with a similar perforation, which expands at the openings. One side is thicker than the other and evidently hung downwards. Both faces are slightly concave and there is evidence of wear on the upper side of each face. The bead is black and highly polished</page><page sequence="94">392 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy 1 ___&gt; 1906 1907 1908 1910 1911 1912 1913 1914 1915 1916 1917 1918 1919 ___=___=___ 5 cm ?? 12 in Fig. 36 ?Circle L.

The beads of bone are of one type, barrel shape cut from a hollow bone, but there is some variation in size and detail. They have all been burnt, but as this does not appear to have caused any damage it may have been a deliberate act. Furthermore as they appear to come from the same necklace as the stone beads, which have not been subjected to fire, it would suggest that firing was part of the manufacturing process. The beads are black to buff with black specks and have a highly polished finish, particularly on the black areas. Many of the beads have flattened facets giving them a subrectangular cross-section. No. 1937 has a double perfora tion but the thin barrier between the two borings has disintegrated except at one end. No. 1939 may have been similarly divided but nothing now remains save a ridge at one side. The remainder have cylindrical perforations. The beads vary in length from 21mm (1932) to 13.8mm (1946) and in diameter from 26.2mm (1942) to 19.3mm (1946). Four other beads (1953-5, 1966) came from this level. No. 1953, of 'serpentine', is a roughly quadrangular bead with slight notches on one long side. It has a thin, wedge-shaped section and an hourglass perforation. No. 1954, of sandstone, is oval in plan but with flat facets along the sides. The section is flat on one side and slightly domed on the other. No. 1955 is a disc shaped slate bead. No. 1966 is a large ring cut from a hollow bone of oval section. Two horizontal grooves were cut into it to produce a collar at both ends. The cylindrical 'perforation' has an oval cross-section. Where it survives the surface appears to have been polished. Pottery: western neolithic ware. There are fifteen well-represented vessels from this site (Nos 6-20); in most cases it was possible to reconstruct at least a rim-to-shoulder profile (Figs 40-1) and to establish the original diameter at the mouth. An estimated minimum of fifteen further vessels was arrived at by counting rim- and other sherds of distinctive ware or shape, but the overall total may be as high as forty-six. Most of the vessels are of good quality ware with a smooth or occasionally slightly burnished finish. Grits are usually of fine quartzite with the less frequent inclusion of calcite or igneous material. Cavities are not a common feature and where present are the result of the carbonisation of organic inclusions or the removal of larger, protruding grits prior to smoothing and firing. Vessel walls range from 3mm (687-702) to 10mm (Vessel 20) thick but the majority average 5mm-7mm. In general the neck is thinner than the body of the pot. There are a wide range of colours with very dark grey (7.5YR 1/3) and light red to reddish brown (2.5YR 6/6-4/6) surface dominant. Others represented are pinkish grey (5YR 6/2) and reddish yellow (5YR 6/6). As noted, there can be a variety of colours on the same vessel. The better ware is usually a uniform colour throughout, but dark cores (354-5) or darker cores and inner faces (Vessel 20) do occur. The most common rim form is rounded and everted (Vessels 6, 9, 11-14) but broad flattened types also occur (Nos 7, 8, 10, 15, 20). There is a single pointed example, No. 16. The neck can be upright (Nos 10, 12, 14/15, 17, 20) or slightly curved (Nos 6-9, 13, 16, 18, 19) while two vessels (Nos 11, 363-7) have a pronounced concave profile. The shoulders are predominantly simple of a rounded (Nos 6-8, 10, 12, 16, 18, 19) or slightly pointed form. Pinched-out (418-19), small step (2.5mm, No. 9) and medium step (5mm, Nos 17, 20) are also present, while Vessel 14 appears to be unshouldered with an upright profile. The 336 sherds of western neolithic pottery from the pre-enclosure phase (54-389) represent at least twenty-five vessels (Fig. 40). A further thirty-three sherds (390-412 and 482-91) from elsewhere on the site were derived from these pots and are described here. Vessel 6: represented by forty-three sherds (54-87, 435-8, 482-6). Rim bulbous and everted, neck slightly concave, simple rounded shoulder. Large vessel with maximum external diameter at mouth of about 28cm; height from rim to shoulder about 8.5cm. Fabric hard, burnished inside and out, containing fine quartzite grits. Infrequent cavities; wall is 4mm-7mm thick. Nos 88-97, 487: from a similar but smaller vessel with diameter at mouth of about 26cm; rim more everted and rounded and shoulder slightly more pronounced than No. 6. Some calcite grits as well as fine quartzite ones, but otherwise fabric is very similar to that of No. 6; indeed some bodysherds such as 82 and 87 may belong to this vessel. Sherds average 6mm thick. Vessel 7: represented by forty sherds (98-128, 411, 412 and 800-5). Broad (20mm-26mm) everted rim and vessel had external diameter at mouth of about 26cm.

The best preserved sherds, such as 98-9, are of good quality, burnished inside and out, containing very fine quartzite grits. More cavities than in No. 6 but otherwise general form and fabric are very similar. Rimsherd 101a: slightly thicker and broader top than others; formed by folding top of neck over and pinching out. This feature is not evident on the other rims. Vessel 8: represented by forty sherds (129-68). Broad, flat-topped and everted rim, slightly concave neck and simple shoulder. External diameter at mouth of about 26cm. Height from rim to shoulder is about 6cm. Ware of good quality, smooth inside and out, outside slightly burnished. Gritting consists mainly of fine calcite but some quartzite is also present. Only small cavities occur in the outer surface. Average thickness of wall 5mm-6mm. Vessel 9: represented by thirty sherds (169-91, 390-5, 488). Rounded rim set at sharp angle to neck which is upright. Shoulder of small step type; height from rim to shoulder is 5cm. Although of good quality fabric, the finishing on this vessel is poorer than on the previous examples. There are some cavities in both surfaces, which are smooth, and the wall has an average thickness of 6mm. Vessel 10: represented by forty-three sherds (192-234). Similar in form, size and fabric to No. 9. Rim broader, less sharply out-turned and has pointed profile. Pot has external diameter at mouth of about 15cm and height from rim to shoulder is about 7cm. Neck upright and shoulder of small step variety. Although the neck is 5mm thick some bodysherds, for example 201, are 6mm thick. Where best preserved the outer surface is smooth and burnished. Vessel 11: represented by thirty-four sherds (235-64 and 396-9). Rim slightly everted, rounded externally and has flat inner face; formed by folding over neck, which is concave. Shoulder is a sharp angle. Height from rim to shoulder is about 6cm. Ware corky; lipped cavities in both surfaces. The best preserved sherds have a smooth burnished outer face and are 5mm-7mm thick. The infrequent gritting is of quartzite and calcite. Vessel 12: represented by twenty-six sherds (265-79 and 400-10). Rim very similar to No. 11 but more everted. There are two broad shallow channels on the inner face; neck upright and shoulder of simple rounded type. Height from rim to shoulder is about 7cm. Ware same as No. 11 but is consistently thicker and averages 6mm-8mm. Vessel 13: represented by twenty-two sherds (280-98 and 489-491). Small beaded rim; neck concave and shoulder simple and pointed. Height from rim to shoulder is about 6.5cm; external diameter at mouth of about 24cm. Average thickness 6mm-7mm; ware good quality with smooth outer surface and infrequent cavities. Gritting of quartzite and calcite. Vessel 14; represented by ten sherds (299-308). Uncarinated pot with uniformly thin (4mm-5mm) walls. Rim pointed with slight outward projection. Although the neck is upright the vessel probably had a round base. Both faces smooth and ware of reasonable quality containing quartzite and calcite grits. Vessel 15: represented by seven sherds (309-15). External diameter at mouth of about 16cm. Rim angular and everted with flat top; neck slightly concave; shoulder of medium step type. No bodysherds present. Rim to shoulder height about 4cm; sherds average 5mm thick. Good quality dark red ware has smooth slightly striated finish and contains fine quartzite grits. A collection of sherds (316-32) of similar reddish yellow (SYR 6/6) fine ware came from at least two separate vessels. Two rim types, a rounded (316) and an angular (318), are present, while 319-20, although like 316, are slighter. Shoulders 322-6: simple with rounded or pointed profile. Ware generally good with few cavities, infrequent calcite and very fine quartzite grits. Thickness 5mm-7mm. Eighteen rimsherds (333-49) from a minimum of five and perhaps as many as nine further vessels. All everted and can, in general, be paralleled amongst the vessels already described. No. 336: broad top, angular in profile, and sharply everted while 338-9 are rounded examples which are set almost at right angles to the neck. Thirteen shoulder (350-62) and eleven necksherds (363-73) represent at least five vessels. Nos 350-2 are from a pot with a medium step shoulder as are 359, 361-2. The last three come from two similar vessels with an average sherd thickness of 6mm-8mm, while necksherds 363-7 are from another pot 11mm thick. No rim or bodysherds appropriate to vessels of this size were found. Nos 374-89: miscellaneous bodysherds. A further 107 sherds came from concentrations of material associated with activity peripheral to the central area (390-481, 2004-18). Nos 390-412 and 435-8 are from vessels described above</page><page sequence="102">400 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy and come mainly from the vicinity of Possible House B. The presence here of these sherds may represent the clearance of rubbish pits or general occupation debris associated with a pre-enclosure house. The remaining sherds are from at least three further vessels. There are four rims (413-16), nine shoulders (417-21, 425, 432-4) and five necksherds (439-44). No. 413: flat-topped everted rim similar to but slighter than that of Vessel 8. Nos 418-19: from a vessel with medium step, pinched-out shoulder while the remaining shoulders are of the more common simple rounded variety. Nos 445-81: miscellaneous sherds. Of these 445-52, eight bodysherds, and 453-7, a shoulder-, two neck- and two bodysherds, are from vessels similar to Nos 6-8 above, while 458 may be from Vessel 6. Nos 2004-8 came from a vessel with a small everted rim, a slightly concave neck and a simple angle shoulder. No. 2009 is a necksherd and 2010-18 are miscellaneous bodysherds. Decorated western neolithic pottery (Class la) (Figs 42-3). Sixty-eight sherds from at least seven decorated vessels (1-53 and 2000-3). Four or more of these belong to O Rfordain's Class la (1954, 315-19). Most of the sherds came from the lower levels of activity associated with the pre-enclosure occupation in the centre of the site. Vessel 2, however, came from the house and belongs to the enclosure phase. Vessel 1: represented by twenty-five sherds (l-16g). Broad ^verted rim, straight neck and large step shoulder (5mm). Large vessel with external diameter at mouth of 30cm; rim to shoulder height of at least 8cm. Rim decorated with closely spaced scored lines which may have continued right across the top of the rim, but as it is worn they are now best defined on the inner and outer edges. One of the two shouldersherds (5) has a triangular impression on the outer face, but this may be an accidental feature as the other sherd (6) is plain and 10mm-12mm thick. Ware of good quality containing crushed quartzite grits. Cavities are infrequent, especially on the outer face which is smooth and even. Two other similar vessels are represented by rimsherds 17, 19, 20. No. 17, which could not be located, had a broad, slightly convex top and a bulbous profile; decoration consisted of oblique strokes in two rows along the inner and outer edges overlapping in the centre. On 19-20 decoration is almost identical to that on Vessel 1, but there is an additional row of more widely spaced, slightly oblique impressions along the outer edge. Sherds reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) on outer face and core and very dark greyish brown (10YR 3/2) internally. Another rimsherd (18) is also missing. It was broad-topped with a marked outward slope and a cavetto neck. A row of vertical finger-nail impressions occur within the curve of the neck. The rim belongs to a globular bowl. No. 21: everted, flat-topped rim of hard well-fired ware containing crushed calcite and quartzite grits; surface very dark grey and core light reddish brown (5YR 6/4). Although only part of the rim survives the decoration consists of oblique broad impressions along the top. The closest analogies for this vessel come from Site 10 (E254: 363-8). No. 22: shouldersherd of medium step (3mm-5mm) variety; row of oblique oval impressions along the outer face of the shoulder itself. No. 23: body'sherd from the same vessel, which may also be the one to which 21 belongs. No. 24 is markedly everted with a convex top; decoration consists of oblique strokes across the top. Ware of good quality with burnished very dark grey exterior and lighter core. Gritting of crushed quartzite. Vessel 2: represented by seven sherds (25-31) which, with the exception of 25, were found together in sq. 16 in the centre of the site at the same level as the first phase of the central house floor. No. 25: inverted rimsherd with a flat outward-sloping top came from beneath the wall collapse outside the enclosure to the east. On outer face rim is stepped-out from neck giving an angular expanded profile; top of rim is decorated with oblique, elongated triangular stabs set close to the outer edge. On the outer expanded face is a row of widely spaced oval impressions set obliquely, while beneath them on the neck are large triangular stab marks opposing those above. Shoulder (26-7): pinched out and slightly pointed. There is a vertical applied lug on the outer face of the shoulder on 26. The body (28-31) has horizontal rilling. Within the troughs are three oblique rows of elongated oval impressions with each row opposing those above and below. The smooth undecorated portion at the bottom of 28 suggests that the lower part of the vessel was undecorated. Although a large pot with a maximum diameter below the shoulder of about 28cm, the walls are fine with an average thickness of 6.7mm. Ware compact and of very good quality, smooth and burnished internally and externally. Grits, of crushed stone, are</page><page sequence="103">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 401 &lt;_f. i !

Both faces have small cavities. Colour varies from red (10R 4/8) to yellowish red (SYR 5/6) to very dark greyish brown (10YR 3/2) on the surface while the core is generally light brown. Two further rims (32-3), though similar in both form and decoration, are probably from two separate vessels; upright profile, rim everted with a broad, slightly convex top. On 32 there is a slight inward protrusion and a similar feature may have occurred on 33, which is damaged. No. 33 has decoration on the top in the form of slightly oblique scores which occasionally transverse it. On 32 the lines are less marked, partly owing to wear, and more oblique. Although 34 has the superficial appearance of a shoulder, the curvature of the sherd suggests that the raised portion is an applied diagonal feature, possibly part of a lug. Decoration consists of elongated triangular stabs on one side and more truncated examples on the other. No. 35 is a worn rimsherd, which may have had a profile similar to 32-3. Vessel 4: represented by only one sherd (36), a shoulder. The shoulder itself is slight and consists of a simple change of direction. A horizontal strip of clay 4cm high was applied over this. When it was pressed into position it formed a more exaggerated shoulder with a marked horizontal channel beneath. A vertical lug, about 3.5cm long, was then added and smoothed into position. Subsequently a thin slip was applied over the outer surface of the vessel giving it a glossy appearance. It is probable that the applied shoulder was a continuous feature rather than a localised 'base' for the lug. Decoration, in the form of light, generally vertical strokes, occurs on the neck, while there are horizontal impressions across the outer, slightly flattened, face of the lug. The ware is compact and of very good quality. It contains a liberal quantity of calcite grits and there are few cavities. The neck has an average thickness of 7.5mm. It was a large vessel similar in form and size to No. 2. While both of these can be paralleled in general amongst the decorated vessels from other sites at Lough Gur (cf. O Riordain 1954, figs 13-14) the form of the rim and the decorated body of No. 2 and the elaborate nature of No. 4 are exceptional. Vessel 5: represented by twelve sherds (37-48); 49-51 may be from the same pot. The form is that of an open bowl with a maximum diameter of at least 30cm. It was not possible to determine the nature of the upper portion of the vessel. Apart from a small area around the base there appears to have been all-over decoration. The largest surviving portion is provided by conjoining bodysherds (40-3). At the bottom of these is an arc of oblique, pointed oval stab marks, probably part of a circle, about 10cm in diameter, marking off the base of the vessel. Within this is a second, less well-defined arc of oblique strokes. Above the outer or upper arc the decoration consists of two complete vertical panels with the remains of a third. Each panel has opposed lines of virtually horizontal stab-marks. These are elongated triangles or pointed ovals with the broad ends outermost. To one side of the vertical ones are three diagonal panels executed in the same manner. Nos 37-9 come from a point higher up on the vessel. A vertical rectangular applied lug, whose edges had been carefully smoothed into the wall, is decorated with shallow diagonal channels. On either side of the lug is at least one vertical panel of the type which occurs on the lower part of the body, while below it are at least two such panels set horizontally. Nos 49-57 may be necksherds from this vessel. Each has a curved profile, convex on top and concave underneath. The sherds are thicker at one end, possibly where they were attached to a rim or shoulder. Each is decorated with deep, well-marked grooves which appear to come from a concentric motif around the circumference of a vessel. Between the grooves are flat ridges which are decorated with neat, closely spaced impressions set radially or obliquely across, forming ladder patterns. It is possible, however, that 49-51 belong to a separate vessel, represented also by four bodysherds 52a-53. Nos 52a-c are decorated with elongated scores set in two opposing oblique rows, while 53 has a zig-zag pattern. No. 2000 is an upright neck. This is decorated with light oblique strokes while at the base are two grooves of the type occurring on 49-51 with oblique strokes on the ridge between them. All the sherds (37-53, 2000) are of the same ware. This is of exceptionally good quality, compact and evenly fired. The grits are of calcite. Pitting of the surface giving a corky appearance is a feature of the inner surface but these are very small and infrequent on the outer surface of 37-48 especially. The outer surface of all the sherds was carefully smoothed and burnished while the inner face of 49-51 is also smooth. The thickness of the sherds varies from 4mm at the base to c. 6.5mm on the upper portions</page><page sequence="106">404 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy of Vessel 5. The same range is represented on 49-53. The colour of the outer surface is light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) to reddish brown (5YR 4/3) and the internal face has a similar range although dark brown (7.5YR 4/2) also occurs in some areas. No. 52c, while clearly of the same group, is reddish yellow (SYR 6/6) throughout. The core shows the same range of colour. This group of sherds appears to represent at least two vessels, although it is possible that 37-51 and 2000 might come from a single pot with a shallow body, slight shoulder and upright neck. Whatever the actual number of vessels present, the group as a whole is not easily paralleled amongst the other decorated pots from Lough Gur, although some of the decorative features such as the ladder pattern do occur, for example on the vessel accompanying the burial at Site C (6 Riordain 1954, 371-4, pl. XXX; Herity 1982, fig. 26:25). The closest analogies are provided by vessels from Linkardstown Type (Brindley et. al. 1983) and other related burials, particularly three groups of sherds from Linkardstown, Co. Carlow (Herity 1982, 296, fig. 19: 3, 4, fig. 20: 1). The circumferential grooves and ladder pattern on the sherds of groups 3 and 5 are similar to those on 49-51, while the triangular stab-marks on group 4 are not only like those on 37-48 but are grouped in similar panels. Both of the Linkardstown groups are considerably thicker than the Circle L examples, and Herity (1982, 296) suggests that the group 4 sherds may be of Carrowkeel ware. Ladder patterns within circumferential grooves occur on other decorated vessels such as Jerpoint West, Co. Kilkenny (Ryan 1973, 115-18, fig. 5), and Rath East (Herity 1982, fig. 71: 3), as do demarcated bases at, for example, Jerpoint West and Linkardstown. Shallow bodies, of the type evidenced by Vessel 5, are a feature of decorated neolithic vessels, particularly Herity's Style 1 (1982, fig. 5), as are lugs. While the small assemblage of decorated western neolithic pottery from Circle L can, in some respects, be paralleled on other sites at Lough Gur, there are clearly broader affinities represented especially by Vessel 5. Two other vessels, Nos 2 and 4, clearly belong to 6 Riordain's Class la but have features unusual within that group. Nos 2004-8 are from a vessel with a broad flat-topped rim (2004) set at right angles to a slightly concave neck. The shoulder (2006) is formed by a change in direction. The ware is of good quality and contains calcite and quartzite grits. Nos 2009-18, a neck- and nine bodysherds, probably come from the same vessel. Coarse flat-bottomed ware (Figs 44-5). There are 596 sherds of this ware from Circle L, representing a minimum of twenty vessels (806-1260, 2526-659, 2761-7). Of these at least seven are decorated. Although compact finely made vessels occur, the ware is generally friable and contains fine, medium and large grits of quartzite and volcanic ash. Most of the vessels are evenly made and range from 8.6mm to 16mm in thickness. The surfaces, particularly the outer ones, are smooth. The outer face is generally grey in colour but creamy brown also occurs, while the inside varies from grey brown to very dark grey. An unusual feature at this site was the small number of rims and bases present and it was only possible to estimate the size of a few vessels. One hundred and nine sherds come from the central area of pre-enclosure activity (806-901, 2526-38) and a further thirty-three (902-34) come from the vicinity of Possible House B. There are also seventy-nine sherds which are derived from vessels represented at the pre-enclosure stage from higher levels (950-77, 1102-19, 1165-6, 1168-80, 1243-60). All are described here for convenience. Vessel 21: represented by thirty-one sherds (806-35, 1165). Rim (806-11) upright with rounded top. Upper portion of vessel decorated with poorly executed incised lines forming a loose pattern of pendant loops and horizontal lines. At some point below the decorative band is a slight pinched up cordon (815-18). Overall profile slightly convex; the cordon may have occurred at the widest point. External diameter at mouth about 24cm; average thickness of 8mm-9mm. Vessel 22: represented by 118 sherds (836-76, 902-10, 950-81, 1102-19 and 1243-60), almost identical in fabric and general form to No. 21. Pot heavier, with average thickness of 10mm to 11mm, and larger. External diameter at mouth 28cm. The decoration, also poorly incised, is in the form of an irregular lattice. Flat base (846) rises to slightly convex profile and a cordon, more pronounced than that of No. 21, occurs at the widest part of the body. Vessel 23: represented by twenty-three sherds (885-7, 911-20, 1120-9). Fabric more compact than that of Nos 21-2 and contains medium quartzite grits. Average thickness of 10mm. Rim (911-12, 1120-1): flat inward-sloping top; the vessel probably had a convex section.</page><page sequence="107">Grogan and Eogan ?

No. 2529: plain, flat-topped rimsherd; 2530-8: bodysherds. Nos 2768-70: decorated bodysherds from vessel of heavily gritted ware with reddish yellow applied outer face and dusty texture. There is a single line of broad comb ornament on each sherd. Beaker pottery. This site produced six hundred sherds of fine Beaker (1261-719, 2395-499, 2660-95) from at least twenty vessels. Of these only four vessels (Nos 28-31) were well represented, although the decorative arrangement of several others was reasonably complete. The ware is of good quality, contains fine quartzite and igneous grits and, occasionally, grog. It is characteristically light red (10R 6/8) or reddish yellow (5YR 7/8) in colour with a darker core. There is a wide range of thickness, between 4mm (1321) and 10mm (1435), but usually the sherds are 6mm-7mm thick. The main decorative techniques are comb and other impressions and incision, the latter usually in the form of horizontal lines. Cord ornament does not occur at Circle L. The decoration usually occurs in zones but less formal arrangements are also represented. One hundred and seventy-eight sherds (1261-378, 2395-454) come from the central pre enclosure level (Figs 46-7). As this was the main focus of occupation during both phases the bulk of this material may be derived from a higher level. However, some of the Beaker came from a low level and an overlap in the use of this pottery and western neolithic ware is possible. While there are sherds from at least eleven vessels, only three of these are well represented. Other sherds derived from these vessels but found elsewhere on the site are described here for convenience. Vessel28: represented by thirty-eight sherds (1261-94, 1418-19, 1611-12). Rim 1264-5, 1611-12) flat-topped with slight outward expansion. The only decoration occurs near the base (1261-3, 1418-19) and consists of two slightly irregular lines of comb. Nos 1266-94 are bodysherds with an average thickness of 6mm. The diameter at the base is c. 8cm. No. 1295: flat-topped upright rim with six horizontal lines of comb decoration. No. 1577: necksherd from the same vessel with six, or possibly seven, lines of comb and a single finger-nail impression beneath. Only one sherd from Vessel 29 (1296) came from this level (the vessel is described with the finds from the Central House, see p. 417). Nos 1297-8: rounded rimsherds which expand slightly on both sides. No. 1297 has a cordon within the curve of the neck. A line of impressions occurs immediately beneath the rim, but these may have been caused accidentally when the rim was being pinched out. There is a row of closely spaced finger-nail impressions below the cordon with a second, discontinuous row beneath it. Vessel 30: represented by fifteen sherds (1299-306, 1578-83, and 1637). Rim (1299) flat-topped; bodysherds have average thickness of 6.7mm. Decoration consists of deeply incised, discontinuous lines. Nos 1307-9 and 1420 (rim-, two base- and a bodysherd): from highly ornamented vessel with average thickness of 6mm; rim is pointed and neck concave. On the outer face are two rows of vertical finger-nail impressions. Between these are four horizontal lines of comb ornament with a single row of diagonal finger-nail impressions immediately beneath the rim on the inside and five lines of very fine comb below. On 1420, which comes from the belly, a single line of comb is separated by a blank area from four further lines lower down. The base has three lines of comb near the foot and a band of diagonal lines of comb decoration immediately above. This vessel had a diameter at the base of c. 6cm. No. 1310: round-topped rim with deep oval stab mark and the remains of second. Nos 1311-15: bodysherds with horizontal lines of comb ornament; 1311 may be from the same vessel as 1295. No. 1314 has three diagonal lines of comb beneath three horizontal ones. Nos 1316 and 1588 have a band of decoration bordered on top by a single line of comb and at the bottom by two closely spaced ones. Between these are vertical rows of ornament, each consisting of four horizontal finger-nail impressions. No. 1317 has four irregularly spaced lines of comb with a possible fifth above. Beneath the lowermost line is a frill of elongated diagonal stab-marks. The sherd is 8mm thick. Nos 1318, 1421, 1589, 1638-9 have a band of decoration</page><page sequence="110">408 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy 1 1261-3 _14J_8_ 1264' \fy ^3 I __M2?__l__12_9!_!5T2__ ~297 ' y^ ' 1301 1299 . 1300 _&gt;.~ ^ /-*%. y r i I--i 11439 &lt;*?-&lt;7 0 r^^\ H 1438 1580 V30 1579 ^ =Ha=BHC=HB 7cm MHHac==iHBHa 3in 1582-3 .: I 1307 1582 3 1637 I 1308 1309 1420 \&gt;jI WI Nil I?hI xy ? \^ s1* vs^ fl 1310 13i1 !312 1313 Fig. 46-Circle L.

Between these are three rows of oval impressions set diagonally forming a zig-zag pattern. Nos 1319-20 have a similar band, but the impressions are arranged in two horizontal though somewhat irregular lines. No. 1321: bodysherd of very fine hard ware 4mm thick; decorations consists of three evenly spaced incised lines. Between these, and cutting the middle line, are closely spaced vertical impressions.

Most rounded but 1330-1 and 1340-1 are flat-topped. No. 1341: of pitted grey ware similar to some of the western neolithic pottery from the site while 1342-3 are from a vessel or vessels of thin (4mm) compact ware with a flared neck and round-topped rim.</page><page sequence="112">410 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Nos 1345-73: undecorated bodysherds. Nos 1345-9: of identical fabric to Vessel 28 but are consistently thinner, averaging 4.8mm. Nos 1350-3: of thin ware like that of 1342-3 and may be from the same pot. Although 1374-8, all basesherds, are undecorated, some or all of them may be from decorated vessels represented above. Nos 1374-5: from the same pot with a pinched out foot as 1377, which is of coarser ware. Fabric of 1378 is very similar to that of Vessel 28. Only thirty-eight sherds of Beaker pottery came from this level elsewhere in the enclosure (1379-416). All the sherds are from vessels best represented in the central area of activity or at a higher level. Nos 1379-87: undecorated rims which can be round or flat-topped. Nos 1382-6 are slightly everted; 1384 is from the same vessel as 1338, and 1385 is from the same pot as 1337. Nos 1388-416: plain bodysherds. No. 1388 is from a pot similar to that represented by 1342 while 1390-5 may be from Vessel 28. No. 1417: about one hundred broken or worn fragments from the pre-enclosure phase throughout the site. Nos 2395-412: group of. sherds found together on the old ground level below the paving associated with the Central House (see below). No. 2395 is from the junction between the neck and body; single, lightly incised line below the 'shoulder'. No. 2396 has the remains of three horizontal lines of comb ornament. The remaining sherds are from the neck (2397-400) and body (2401-12) of at least three vessels. Nos 2411-12 are unusually thin (4mm) sherds. Nos 2413-15: from vessel with flat-topped rim. Of the three rims only 2415 is decorated with a single diagonal stroke. It is probable that necksherds 2421-6 and bodysherds 2427-34 are from this vessel which may be undecorated apart from 2415. Nos 2416-17: worn rimsherds from two further vessels. Nos 2418-20: decorated neck- (2418-19) and body- (2420) sherds with elongated triangular impressions set in opposed diagonal rows, three of which are present on 2418. No. 2457 and possibly 2458, from the enclosure phase, are also from this vessel. In addition to a diagonal row 2457, a necksherd, also has a vertical row. Nos 2435-9: basesherds possibly from a single vessel, which may be from either of these two pots. Nos 2440-54: undecorated neck and bodysherds. Rusticated /Domestic Beaker. There are 510 sherds of this pottery from Circle L (1720a-91, 2117-394, 2696-760) representing at least eighteen vessels, but no complete profiles could be constructed. The ware is generally identical to the fine Beaker but is thicker and less well finished. It is compact, averaging 7.5mm-10mm in thickness, and contains grog and fine quartzite grits. The pottery has a dusty texture and is smooth, but the surfaces, particularly near the base, are frequently uneven. Decoration, most commonly in the form of opposed finger-nail impressions arranged haphazardly on the upper part of the vessel, occurs on some of the pots. Other techniques include cordons, again applied or pinched up close to the rim, incision and comb. The vessels have a soft S-shaped profile but can have a more pronounced curve towards the base. The size varies considerably, and although the diameter at the mouth could only be estimated in two cases, at 18cm and 24cm, diameters at the base of six other vessels ?6cm, 8cm, 8cm, 10cm, 12cm and 16cm ?indicate that some may have been twice as large as others. An unusual feature, not represented on the fine Beaker, was the application in a few cases of a thin slip. One hundred and sixty-seven sherds came from the pre-enclosure phase (1720a-91, 2023-116) (Fig. 52) representing at least five vessels. Vessel 32: represented by seventy-three sherds (1720a-91). Rim, 1720a-21, simple and flat topped while neck, 1728-35, elongated and gently curved. Decoration limited to occasional finger nail impressions or stab-marks on a few bodysherds (1722-7) from below the waist. There are three basesherds, 1736-8. Vessel 33: represented by twenty-five sherds, fourteen from the pre-enclosure level (1098-2111) and eleven from the upper level of the Central House (2156-66). No rimsherds present; ware distinctive but quite similar to that of Vessel 34, average thickness 10mm. There is a pinched-up cordon on 2098 with a deep stab-mark or impression set diagonally beneath it. Nos 2099-103 and 2156-9: decorated bodysherds; ornament executed by thumb-nail impressions or by drawing the nail through the clay. These are set opposite each other. Nos 2104-111 and 2160-6: undecorated. Three further vessels are represented by three rims (2023-4, 2026) and fifty-four other sherds (2027-9) which may be from any of the three. No. 2023: rounded rim; flattened facet along the top caused by drawing a flat object along it. About 2cm lower down is a pinched-up cordon.</page><page sequence="113">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 411 A row of incised diagonal lines runs down from the rim and across the apex of the cordon. These were executed with a thin sharp implement and cut into the clay at a slight angle. Another row, set in the opposite direction, occurs a short distance below the cordon. One of these scores is broader and more deeply cut than the others. No. 2023 is from a vessel with a maximum diameter at the mouth of 18cm. No. 2024: thick flat-topped rim with a slight outward expansion; immediately beneath is a rounded cordon. The sherd thins considerably into the neck, which is lljmm thick. No. 2025: cordoned sherd from the rim of the same vessel. No. 2026 is a pointed rimsherd with a slightly concave inner face and a rounded exterior. There is a cordon beneath it and this occurs on 2027-8 also. No. 2029 is a decorated necksherd. The decoration consists of two or possibly three irregular impressions. No. 2030-1: decorated bodysherds. Each has an incised line, on 2030 this may have been executed by pressing in the thumb-nail and drawing it across the surface. No. 2031 has two closely set opposite stab-marks. No. 2032a is from the junction between the neck and belly. It has closely spaced intermittent incised lines set diagonally. There are four basesherds (2033-7), again representing three separate vessels. The angle between the base and the wall is greatest on 2035-6 which are from the same vessel and slightest on 2033. No. 2034 has an upright foot ring. There is a white accretion on the inner face of 2033 and this also occurs on a number of body sherds (2040-1, 2045-6, 2052). There are score marks on the outer face of 2036, some of which may be thumb-nail imprints but all appear to be unintentional. No. 2037 is from near the base of the same vessel as 2035-6. No. 2033 had a maximum diameter at the base of c. 16cm, while 2034 was considerably smaller, about 6cm. Nos 2038-9: undecorated necksherds; 2040: from the junction between neck and body. Bodysherds 2041-84 are all of the same ware and texture but fall into three broad categories of thickness. Nos 2041-69 are between 9.8mm and 11.5mm in thickness, 2070-9 average 9mm while 2080-4 are 12mm or more thick. There appears not to be any significance in these groupings, as the rimsherds come from vessels with an average thickness of c. 10mm. However, sherds in the thickest group (2080-4) are not likely to belong to any of these three vessels. There are eighteen other sherds (2085-97, 2112-16) from the early occupation phase. No. 2085: part of flat-topped and slightly everted rim. Nos 2086-8: decorated necksherds from vessels best represented at a higher level. No. 2089 is a necksherd; 2090-6 and 2112-16 are plain bodysherds. No. 2097: basesherd or possibly a sherd from the junction between the neck and body. The enclosure (Figs 33-4, 55; Pis XVI, XVIIIa-XIXa) As noted above, the site was constructed on a naturally level sheltered platform. On the western side it abutted onto a limestone outcrop which rises to form a small cliff. In parts the wall on this side was made up by the cliff alone. The outline of the enclosure is flattened along this side but is still roughly circular with a maximum external diameter of 25m. The double-walling of the enclosure was less formal than at Circles J and K and was indistinguishable in places. This was partly due to more haphazard building, but is also a result of collapse, particularly along the western and south-western sides, where it was erected directly on the loose habitation layer of the pre-enclosure occupation. Along this side is a sharp drop towards the present lake shore. The wall was best preserved on the southern side, where it consisted of a facing of large irregular blocks (Fig. 55; Pl. XVIII). Inside this was a bank of smaller stones set against the facing. A few haphazardly placed large stones were all that remained of the inner wall. On the north eastern side were two irregular lines of walling, but many of the stones, again erected on soft occupation debris, had fallen or slipped out of their original positions (Figs 33, 55). Towards the north-west the wall was poorly preserved and the indications here were of a bank consisting in part of large stones and in part of smaller stones and clay. It is probable, however, that the bank originally had an inner and outer facing. Owing to the steep natural slope on the eastern side the wall in this area was in a very collapsed state and in plan appeared as a jumble of large and small stones.

Lough Gur excavations 413 sections, however, it was possible to distinguish an inner and outer wall consisting of uprights supported on clay and smaller stones with a compact stony fill between them. The clay under the wall in this area was sterile and clearly in a transported position. In contrast the brown stony clay in the wall packing contained a considerable amount of charcoal and animal bone which had been derived from the earlier habitation layer. The entrance was not located and this evidently occurs in an unexcavated segment of the enclosure wall. As the wall was constructed directly on the habitation layer associated with the pre enclosure activity without any intervening sterile layer it is probable that occupation on the site was continuous. A considerable amount of habitation evidence came from the second, enclosed phase and this included a house, fireplaces, post-holes, pits and stone settings. It was, however, difficult to identify features which had been cut into the earlier layers and clearly some material which occurred at a low level was derived from the later activity. The Central House (Figs 34, 55) This structure occurred in the centre of the enclosure. Two phases of construction were recognised. While the first phase probably belongs to the pre-enclosure level, the evidence for structural continuity justifies its inclusion here. In the first phase the main evidence consisted of a thin layer of habitation soil defined on the south-western side by a line of large post-pits (Fig. 35, Nos 8-10). These were up to 58cm in depth and post-holes were contained in Nos 9-10 (71 and 72 respectively). The habitation layer had an average depth of 40cm. The perimeter of the structure was poorly defined on the other sides, but a number of post- or stake-holes on the north-eastern (Nos 50-61) and southern (Nos 73-6) sides may have contained wall supports. In this area the plans of this house and Possible House A appear to have overlapped and post-holes 50-61 could have belonged to either structure, as could 62-5. Although the evidence is limited, the homogeneity of the habitation layer of the Central House suggests that it is later than A. Within this area there were two concentrations of burnt earth and a small circular pit, No. 11. A cluster of post- or stake-holes occurred near the western wall (Nos 62-70) and as most of these underlie the clay floor of the second phase they may be associated with the earlier building. During the second phase the house had an oval plan with maximum external dimensions of 6.5m by 4.0m and was 5.0m by 3.5m internally (Fig. 55). The outline is provided by an almost continuous line of large boulders averaging 90cm by 50cm by 35cm. These provided a wall footing while beyond this on the western side was a trench designed to support wooden uprights. Three post-holes, including Nos 71-2 which had been in use during the earlier phase, were recognised at this level, and other large examples occurred on the eastern side (Nos 58-60). As this structure was constructed on soft occupation soil derived from the earlier phase it was not possible to recognise further wall or roof supports. A well-defined clay floor, 10cm thick and covering an area of 2.0m by 1.2m, occurred near the centre. Abutting onto this was an area of rough cobbling which may originally have formed the floor throughout the rest of the house. Outside the house on the eastern side clearly contemporary, carefully laid paving covered an area 6,8m by 5.2m. This appears to be an associated yard. While no fireplace was found within the house, a hearth occurred in an unpaved area lm to the north east of the wall where a gap may represent an entrance. The hearth lay on a layer of yellow, fire-reddened and charcoal-flecked earth which ran beneath the paving and probably served the house.

Lough Gur excavations 415 the yard in the open air. Immediately outside the house on the southern side was a large rubbish pit (No. 1). This had a maximum diameter of 1 .lm and was 81cm deep and originally served the earlier structure, as it was partly covered by a wall stone of the later house. It was revealed at the level of the later house, however, and evidently continued in use during this phase. The fill contained large quantities of animal bones and charcoal as well as sherds of western neolithic pottery (84, 108, 115-16, 235, 323, 342, 354-5, 385). The burial (Fig. 55; Pl. XlXa) An extended adult inhumation occurred on the northern edge of the paving. It was orientated south-west/north-east with the head at the south-west and was turned to the right, facing east-south-east. The arms were at the sides and the feet were close together, the right lying slightly over the left. The overall length was 1.75m. The skeleton lay on a base of small pebbles with large stones placed around it to form the rough outline of a grave. These stones were at a higher level than the paving. A few small stones lay over the burial but there was no evidence for any formal covering. The skeleton was in a reasonable state of preservation, although many of the hand bones and the left ribs were missing. Professor Keenan reported that 'the skeletal remains are those of a strong, well-built adult male with considerable wearing of teeth. The fragmented condition of the skull and long bones did not allow of any measure ment being made.' A few fragments of western neolithic pottery, a flint blade and a piece of worked chert came from the neighbourhood of the burial. Another piece of chert and a small flint blade lay on top of the bones with some tiny scraps of featureless pottery. None of these finds was identified in the preliminary unpublished typescript report and it appears unlikely that any were gravegoods. Finds (Figs 40, 45, 48-9, 53-4) As the first phase of this structure belongs to the pre-enclosure activity the finds from it have been described in that section (391-411). There are ninety-seven sherds of western neolithic ware from the second phase including the paving (482-578, Fig. 40). Some of these (482-91) are from Vessels 6, 9 and 13, which are associated with Possible House A. Amongst the remaining sherds only one distinct vessel, No. 16, was recognised. Vessel 16 is represented by twenty-seven sherds (4?2-518). Rim (492) has pointed and everted profile; neck (493-5) concave and shoulder simple (496-501); average thickness of wall 6mm. Diameter at mouth about 16cm. Ware slightly corky, pitted inside and out and containing some quartzite grits. Nos 519-31: from vessel similar to No. 6. Neck (520-4) concave, pot has simple rounded shoulder (519). Sherds 6mm-8mm thick. No. 532 is a rim and 533 a simple rounded shoulder from the same vessel as 339-42 while 536-7 are rims from a pot similar to No. 14. No. 538 may be from Vessel 9; 539 is a rounded everted rim of poor quality highly gritted ware. A poorly made vessel of corky ware containing quartzite grits is represented by 540-6. Neck (541) slightly concave, simple rounded shoulder (540). Nos 547-78: miscellaneous shoulder, neck and bodysherds. There are sixty-five sherds of coarse flat-bottomed ware (935-99) from three separate vessels (Fig. 45). Of these 950-77, from Vessel 22, have already been described. Vessel 24: represented by twenty-eight sherds (935-49, 1168-80); rim (935-6, 1168-9) has flat inward-sloping top. A horizontal incised line occurs 5mm beneath the rim on the outer face and below this are both vertical (936) and diagonal lines (935). Nos 982-8: sherds of very coarse gritty ware with average thickness of 10.5mm. The rim, 982, has a broad rounded top. There are 159 sherds of Beaker pottery (1418-576). Some of these have already been described with the material from the possible house from the pre-enclosure level. At least ten vessels are represented (Figs 48-9).</page><page sequence="118">416 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy fl fr--"j I r*Er^3^ fl te^iy B fl &gt;P-&gt; 1 ta^F I ^r^ 1422 ;423 '1424 1425. 1426 V " 1432 1428 1427 1433 1640 1435 |:Sf2|f / / ebb f 4h~/ I \ 7 / ' ? w W- 1437 VvC/ f 1436: 1719 1434. _ ^ $| sail #/ 1594 ^ ^ ?, V^ 1445 129fi _._1444_J 1J^,6 ^? 1447 1448 144g 'l4.t ?"-* ,5" ,1^* k=3K=metz^ 7cm mmmmr=m?mm 3in Fig. 48 -Circle L.

Within the curve of the neck is a cordon decorated with three rows of deep triangular and quadrangular impressions. The uppermost runs along the top of the cordon; this and the middle row are slightly irregular but the lowermost, which also occurs on 1446b, has evenly spaced impressions. This form of decoration is repeated, by bands of two rows each, immediately above the waist (1447-8) and on the belly (1449-52). Base (1453-5) has slight foot; it and the remainder of the vessel (1456-525) are undecorated. Fabric red (2.5YR 4/6) to reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6), containing grog and very fine grits of quartzite and igneous rock. Similar to No. 28; some of the undecorated bodysherds could belong to either vessel.</page><page sequence="120">418 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Nos 1422-8: bodysherds with closely set horizontal lines of comb. On 1423 the lines are not all continuous and some overlapping occurs. There is an irregular diagonal score below the horizontal band. No. 1426 of different ware has decoration identical to that on 1307 with a row of short vertical incisions above a band of horizontal comb lines. Nos 1427-8 are from the same vessel, possibly that from which 1314 is derived. On 1427 there are five evenly spaced lines of comb with a frill of diagonal ones cutting the lowermost. On 1428 the horizontal lines overlap slightly. No. 1429 has three horizontal lines of comb with diagonal lines above. Below is a frill of elongated comb stab-marks. No. 1430 has nine and 1431 four lines of comb, but at least one of those on 1430 is discontinuous. No. 1431 has a frill, similar to that on 1429, and all three sherds may come from the same vessel. No. 1432 has a single horizontal line with a diagonal one beneath. No. 1433 is a round-topped rim with a concave neck; decoration consists of unevenly spaced and overlapping lines of well-executed comb. No. 1640 is a similarly ornamented sherd from the belly of the same vessel. Nos 1434a-b and 1719, also round-topped rims, are from a small pot with a diameter at the mouth of about 8cm and a height of about 10cm. The vessel has all-over ornament consisting of closely set and occasionally overlapping rows of very fine triangular to oval impressions or stab-marks. Nos 1435-7 are sherds of unusually heavy ware 9mm thick probably from the same vessel as that represented by E252: 2830 from Circle K (Fig. 21); decoration consists of widely spaced lines of well-executed comb. The lines are unevenly spaced and occasionally discontinuous. Nos 1438-9, possibly from Vessel 30, have unevenly spaced incised lines, one of them overlapping on 1439. Nos 1440-3 also have incised decoration. No. 1444 has a band of decoration bordered by a single line of comb at either end. Immediately inside each line is a row of deep, oblique oval stab-marks. No. 1445, which is worn, has a horizontal row of oval to triangular impressions joined to a diagonal line beneath. The latter two are from vessels similar to those represented by 1316-20. Nos 1526-49: rimsherds; 1526 has row of incised lines along the inner edge of the flat top. Nos 1548-9 have cordons within the curve of the neck. The remaining rims are undecorated. Nos 1527-8 are of similar ware and profile to 1526. Most of the others are flat-topped, but 1542-4 have a pointed profile and a slight external swelling. Nos 1533-6 are from the same vessel. Nos 1550-76: undecorated bodysherds. Nos 1550-2: from a thin-walled pot (4.2mm) of slightly burnished appearance. Rusticated/Domestic Beaker (Figs 53-4). Of 293 sherds (2117-394, 2696-710) only six did not come from the house or the area immediately around it. The sherds are from at least nine vessels. Vessel 34; represented by forty-one sherds (2117-155). Rim, 211719c, flat-topped with rounded outward expansion, which blends in with the evenly spaced pinched-up cordons which occur on the upper part of the vessel. There appear to be at least four of these and the lower portion is undecorated. External diameter at mouth about 24cm and average thickness 9mm-10mm. Upper portion of pot finely made with applied slip on outer surface. Both faces burnished, outer dark grey to light red (2.5YR 6/6), inner surface light red. The same accretion which occurs on 2033 from the pre-enclosure occupation is present on a number of sherds from this vessel. No. 2167 is a rimsherd from same vessel as 2026. Nos 2168-71: cordoned rimsherds with flat top with an outward projection; very similar but appear to belong to two separate vessels. Nos 2168-9: of red (2.5YR 5/6) slightly dusty ware with dark core. Nos 2170-1: reddish yellow (5YR 7/6), have fine slip which was applied with a narrow instrument which resulted in fine 'trails' across surface; rim broader than on previous two and has slight outward slope. These vessels with a cordon in the curve of the neck are the domestic equivalent of the fine Beakers represented by rimsherds like 1297 and 1548-9. No. 2172: fragment of flat-topped rim. No. 2173: an unusual rim, which has broad, slightly convex top which protrudes inwards; vessel finished with thin slip on outer surface; top of rim has two circumferential rows of regularly spaced bird-bone impressions with a third on curved junction between rim and wall; hard compact ware matched by 2174-80 which might be from same vessel. Nos 2174-7b, clearly from the same pot, have rows of vertical impressions; 2174 has five rows. Impressions made with oval implement, thinner at one end than the other, which had three small protrusions causing corresponding stab-marks at the base of each impression. The implement was inserted at a slight angle, forcing the clay up on one side. In some instances this was not subsequently smoothed down. Neither impressions nor rows are evenly spaced; thin</page><page sequence="121">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 419 slip applied to outer surface and pot later burnished. Nos 2178-9 have similar impressions but executed with different tool; on 2179 this was dragged downwards slightly from the impression. No. 2180: more carefully decorated with two opposed rows of regularly spaced comb. A thin chisel-like implement, possibly of wood or bone, with a slightly curved section was used. This had five closely spaced teeth and one set slightly apart. The ware, curvature and thickness (c. 10mm) of 2173-80 suggest that all come from the same vessel which had an external diameter at the mouth of c. 22cm and an upright or slightly swollen profile. Nos 2174-5: from lower level (possibly pre-enclosure) than the other sherds. The remaining 224 sherds (2181-394, 2696-710) have been divided into eight groups on the basis of ware and thickness and are from at least five vessels. Nos 2181-7: from decorated vessel with average thickness of 9mm-10mm. Nos 2181-4 are necksherds and 2185-7 bodysherds from vessel with average thickness of 10mm. No. 2181: ornamented with two diagonal impressions made with an implement similar to that used on 2180; two curved impressions are set opposite each other. On 2182 there are two stab-marks made with different tools. Nos 2183-4, from lower down on neck, are plain but show method of coil-building used in vessel's manufacture. Nos 2185-6 have opposed finger-nail impressions; interior of 2182a-b decorated with deeply incised overlapping lines, possibly part of a lattice motif. Nos 2188-254: between 8.5mm and 10mm thick and may come from one vessel; small number of sherds (2188a-95) decorated. Nos 2188a-b and 2189 have opposed finger-nail impressions in central portion of neck where curvature is less pronounced. Nos 2190-4 have incised horizontal lines and come from the body, possibly close to junction with neck. No. 2190 has two such lines while 2194 has two diagonal stabs beneath a single line. No. 2195: the most elaborately decorated sherd in group, has closely spaced but randomly arranged impressions formed by small toothed implement similar to, but finer than, that used on 2180. No. 2196: basesherd with slight foot ring from which body swells out at about 45?. No. 2197: from central portion of base. Nos 2198-254: plain neck and bodysherds. Nos 2255-65: group of sherds with very smooth outer surface, similar in ware, colour and thickness to 2174-80. On 2255 there is a pinched-up subrectangular boss or lug, but it is not possible to tell if this was set horizontally or vertically. No. 2256 has two lines of horizontal ornament formed by drawing twig or similar item across surface. Nos 2256-61: fire-blackened sooty internal surface. Nos 2256-63: from neck; 2264 and 2265 are bodysherds. Nos 2266-338: from vessel or vessels with elongated slightly concave neck, gently curved body and average thickness of 8mm; some at least of these sherds come from vessel represented by 2070-9 from pre-enclosure phase. Range of decorative details suggests that more than one vessel is represented. No. 2266 has evidence of three rows of impressions probably made with same implement as that used on 2174-7. No. 2267 has vertical scores which may be part of stab-and drag motif. Nos 2268-71 have opposed finger-nail impressions. No. 2272, from the waist, has single incised line set at that point and an irregular 'score' beneath. Nos 2273-88: plain necksherds; 2290-329: bodysherds. There are nine basesherds in this group (2330-8). Nos 2330-1: from same vessel as 2035-6. On 2332-4 the wall curves up directly from base while there is a foot-ring on 2335-7. Approximate diameters: 12cm (2330-1), 10cm (2332-4) and 8cm (2335-7). No. 2338: from base with concave section. Nos 2339-67: group of sherds with thickness of 10.5mm-12.5mm; some slightly coarser than usual in this type. No. 2339: from close to rim; pronounced pinched-up cordon with three score or stab-marks beneath it; most prominent of these is a deep diagonal score. Nos 2340-1, which clearly come from different vessels, have panel of comb ornament consisting of horizontal lines which are joined by diagonal ones. No. 2342 has deeply incised overlapping lines and 2343 has gapped diagonal line. No. 2344, the only decorated bodysherd, has finger-nail impressions. Nos 2345-7: plain necksherds; 2348-63: bodysherds. No. 2364: from junction between neck and body. Nos 2365-7: basesherds. No. 2365 has slight foot-ring; from this 'body' extends outwards parallel to base itself; it may come from an open dish although there are no other sherds which appear to be derived from a vessel of that form. Nos 2366-7: from central portion of flat-bottomed pot. Nos 2368-73: from vessel with average thickness of less than 7.5mm, none decorated. Nos 2374-94: miscellaneous worn bodysherds; some at least from vessels represented above.</page><page sequence="122">420 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Nos 2696-7: decorated bodysherds from same vessel, two incised lines on each, on 2696 widely spaced and parallel and on 2697 irregular. No. 2698 has a single oval impression. No. 2699 has horizontal line of broad, worn, comb ornament. Nos 2700-8: basesherds, 2700-2 are from the same vessel, possibly Nos 33-4, while 2703 may also be from this pot, which had diameter at base of 11mm and slight foot-ring. No. 2704: from vessel with slight rounded foot-ring from which body swells out at sharp angle. On 2705 body curves out directly from base while 2706-8 are from bottom of two separate vessels. There are two pieces of daub, 2709-10. Fifty more sherds of Rusticated /Domestic Beaker (2711-60) are from unknown contexts. At least four vessels are represented. Vessel 38 (2711-40) has round-top rim, 2711, with slight outward splay; four sherds, 2712-15, probably from neck, have finger-nail impressions randomly set; base (2716-18) has slight upright foot-ring from which body swells out at an angle of c. 45?; twenty-two bodysherds (2719-40). Vessel had long, reasonably upright neck with more marked curvature especially towards base. External diameter of base c. 8cm; sherds have average thickness of 8.5mm. All the sherds have the same excavation number and were evidently found together. Nos 2741-50: bodysherds of similar ware to Vessel 38, but significantly thicker, averaging 10mm. Although found with No. 38 the presence of basesherd 2751, which is also thicker, suggests that this group comes from separate vessel, which had diameter at base of 8cm. Another basesherd, 2752, which has slight, pinched-out foot-ring, is from a vessel similar to No. 38 with diameter at base of 7cm. There are four other undecorated bodysherds, 2753-6. Nos 2757-60: decorated necksherds. No. 2757 has four evenly spaced horizontal lines of comb ornament and is 8.5mm thick. No. 2758 has two parallel oblique lines of heavy comb ornament with third line set at right angles to them. No. 2759 has lightly incised and 2760 heavily scored horizontal lines. Finds from the enclosure (Figs 32, 41, 45, 48-51) A large quantity of material came from the interior. Most of this was contemporary with the construction and use of the enclosure and the house. As already mentioned, much of the pottery was no longer accompanied by details of its context and/or location, but as it appears to have come from within the enclosure it is included here. Similarly, while some at least of the lithic assemblage from Circle L must have been derived from the enclosure phase, no details of its context have survived. Pottery. Two hundred and twenty-two sherds of western neolithic ware (579-799) came from the enclosure phase or from unknown contexts (Fig. 41). Of this 21 per cent could be ascribed to the enclosure while the remaining 79 per cent was derived from activity on the site throughout its period of use. In all at least six vessels represented. Vessel 17: represented by twenty-two sherds (579-600), majority from centre of site. Rim, 579, has rounded out-turned profile, neck upright and shoulder is of medium to large (5.5mm) variety. At Circle L only decorated vessel No. 1 has shoulder of this form. Vessel 17 is a large pot with external diameter at shoulder of 24cm-26cm and rim to shoulder height of c. 8cm; ware of good quality with occasional cavities in outer surface; gritting of quartzite and igneous rock, some over 10mm long; wall has average thickness of 6mm-7mm. Vessel 18: represented by fifteen sherds (601-14, 662), all from centre of site. Rim (601 and 662): flat-topped and slightly everted, neck (602-6) slightly concave and shoulder is of simple rounded form (607-9). Ware of reasonable quality, contains igneous and crushed quartzite grits; very few cavities in either surface; sherds 7mm-8mm thick. Vessel 19 (615-61): represented by forty-seven sherds, most from central area but small number found on southern and eastern side. Rim (615): everted, rounded on outside and flat on top. Form of neck (616-23) and shoulder (624-8) as well as the ware is very like that of No. 6, but wall of vessel is consistently thicker, averaging 7.5mm; external diameter at shoulder of c. 22cm and rim to shoulder height of c. 7.3cm. Vessel 20: the most complete pot from Circle L, represented by sixty-five sherds (735-99). Neither location nor context of vessel is known. Rim (735-51): flat-topped and out-turned; out turned portion varies in thickness from 7.5mm to 14.5mm and top is 2.5mm wide.

Vessel is of poor quality both in ware and manufacture; ware is friable and contains large quantity of quartzite grits which are up to 8mm long. Lipped cavities in both surfaces which, although smooth, are uneven. Vessel had external diameter at rim of c. 28cm. The closest analogy is provided by decorated vessel No. 1. Remaining sherds (663-734) include some from minimum of three vessels not represented above. Amongst these are two groups of sherds, 663-71 from thick-walled vessel (9mm) of similar ware and form to No. 20, and 687-702 which are bodysherds from another vessel with average thickness of only 3mm. Three hundred and forty sherds of coarse flat-bottomed ware (1000-260, 2539, 2647-59; Fig. 45) came from the enclosure phase (66 per cent) or from an unknown context (34 per cent) (2539-646, 2761-7).

Lough Gur excavations 423 Vessel 25: 102 sherds (1000-101), mainly from areas immediately around centre of site. Same ware and fabric as Nos 21-2 with average thickness of 9mm-11mm. Rim, 1000-1, upright and flat-topped and below this is well-defined, pinched-up cordon (1002-6). Vessel 26: represented by seventeen sherds (1135-49, 888, 1166); flat-topped rim with slight outward expansion (1135-7) and 2.6cm beneath this is 'shoulder where wall thickens to 14mm. Almost continuous line of incised dashes occurs beneath rim, which has appearance of elongated comb impressions; a second line immediately above 'shoulder' and the two lines are joined by diagonals. Fabric similar to that of Nos 21-2 but has more numerous and larger igneous grits. Vessel 27: represented by only six sherds (1150-3, 877-8); upright profile and round-topped rim. Fabric similar to that of No. 24 but more compact and walls average 8mm thick. Incised horizontal line beneath rim on 1150. On 877 this consists of almost continuous row of finger-nail impressions doubled over part of sherd. No. 1151 has two elongated finger-nail impressions forming an irregular line and it may be that the line on 1150 was executed using the same method. Beneath it are deeply incised vertical and diagonal strokes. Nos 1154-9: undecorated rims of same fabric as No. 27; 1154-6 have rounded and 1157-9 have flat inward-sloping tops. Nos 1160-2: heavy rims with broad flat to slightly rounded tops, average thickness 13mm. Nos 1163-4 of similar but finer ware, have pointed profile and inward-sloping facet. No. 1167: cordoned bodysherd with four closely spaced ovals impressed on cordon. Fabric and cordon like that of No. 21 but no other cordoned sherds from that vessel are decorated. No. 2539: rimsherd with concave bevel and rounded top. Nos 1181-92: from vessel similar to No. 21; 1193-7, all bodysherds, may be from No. 22. Nos 1198-218, 1219-23 and 1224-9 are groups of bodysherds from at least three vessels not represented in the above material. Nos 1230-42: miscellaneous bodysherds. Vessel 35 (2555-90): substantially preserved (Fig. 51); maximum diameter at mouth 20cm, 13cm in diameter at base, about 20cm high. Foot-ring at base and from this body swells out slightly. Slight 'shoulder' forms junction between body and slightly concave neck. Rim upright with inward-sloping bevel; in places rim has slight outward expansion. Ware hard, very compact, containing very large quantity of small to medium (2mm-5mm) grits. No cavities; both surfaces are smooth but uneven. The survivng sherds, which constitute about 70 per cent of the vessel, weigh 1240g, while base alone weighs 475g. Sherds 11mm- 13mm thick. Some animal bone fragments were found with this vessel (2779-822, see Appendix C). Vessel 36: represented by fifty-five sherds (2592-646), of similar ware and appearance to No. 35. Rim, 2592-604: round-topped with concave inward-sloping face which ends in rounded lip extending over inner wall. Vessel has slightly curved profile, maximum external diameter at mouth c. 24cm; sherds average 10mm thick. No basesherds present. Sherds have same excavation number and were evidently found together with some sherds (2558-9, 2562-4, 2568-9) from Vessel 35. Vessel 37: represented by fifteen sherds (2647-59). Rim (2647): flat-topped with slight inward slope; sharp concave dip in the neck, 3cm below rim, and beneath this is a series of shallow pinched-up cordons forming horizontal band of ornament. Rim and neck decorated with poorly executed lattice motif. Nos 2761-7: from thick-walled (14mm) vessel with smooth but uneven dusty textured outer face. No. 2761, which may be from close to rim, has part of lightly incised lattice motif. Nos 2762-4 have very slight, pinched-up cordons. One hundred sherds of Beaker (1577-631, 2455-99) came from the enclosure (Figs 49, 50). Some of these are from vessels best represented from the pre-enclosure phase or the Central House and have already been described. Nos 1584-5 have lines of deep but poorly defined comb. No. 1587 has two D-shaped impressions while 1590 has oval ones set diagonally. Nos 1591-2: neck and bodysherd from same vessel as 1307-9. On 1591 there are light irregularly spaced lines of fine comb while 1592 has border of cross-hatched diagonal lines of comb beneath three horizontal ones. No. 1593 has two off-vertical stab marks enclosed top and bottom by horizontal lines of fine finger-nail impressions. Nos 1595-6: from the same vessel, decoration consists of widely spaced lines of comb with diagonal ones beneath. Nos 1597-9 also have comb ornament. No. 1600: highly decorated base from a small vessel with average thickness of 4mm. Decoration (from bottom up): two horizontal incised lines, a band of closely spaced diagonal stabs, three</page><page sequence="126">424 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy incised lines and a second band of diagonal stabs opposed to the lower one with two further lines above. Nos 1601-6 have incised horizontal lines. On 1601 these are finely executed and closely set, while 1605 has single broad line. No. 1607: decorated with row of diagonal stab marks; 1608-9 have broad channel and 1610 is a cordoned neck sherd. Nos 1613, 1634: rims; 1635 a bodysherd from vessel like that from which 1434 is derived, decorated with three irregular rows of small circular stab-marks. Miscellaneous pottery (Fig. 51). Nos 2500-3: from vessel of compact evenly fired ware containing very fine micaceous grits; sherds 7mm-8mm thick, light red to light reddish brown. Sherds have a waxy appearance and texture. On 2500-2 decoration consists of evenly spaced horizontal lines of comb. Three lines on 2500, two on 2501 and five on 2502. Beneath lowermost line on 2500-1 is a row of triangular comb impressions forming frill. On 2502 such a frill occurs within band of horizontal lines. One of the impressions has been extended, possibly through the use of the implement used in forming the horizontal lines. The zones of ornament on 2500 and 2502, which are both from an upright neck, probably overlap, while 2501 comes from junction between neck and body. No. 2503: of same ware but has rougher inner surface, appears to come from base of same vessel. Base decorated with zig-zag motif of comb-impressed lines. While the ware, decoration and form of this vessel can in general be paralleled amongst the sherds of the Beaker assemblage from Circle L, the closest analogies for the ware are amongst the decorated western neolithic vessels. Nos 2504a-b: sherds from vessel with slightly concave neck and simple rounded shoulder. Nos 2504a-6: from neck; 2507-8a may be from body. Sherds all ornamented with deep, slightly curved strokes executed by drawing a bone, reed or similar object across surface. A line of these strokes occurs diagonally across the lower part of the neck although on 2504a there is a single opposed stroke higher up. This motif of opposed diagonal strokes also occurs on 2507 and 2508b. Outer face of sherds has smooth, slipped surface but inner has disappeared from 2504a-b, 2505 and 2507 exposing very poor quality, gritty ware beneath. No. 2507: waxy appearance and texture like that of 2500-3. In general ware and finish of this group closest to that of western neolithic pottery, while form is that characteristic of this ceramic style. While there is no specific analogy for the decoration, opposed diagonal lines do occur on Beaker and particularly on the Rusticated or Domestic forms. Neck about 8mm thick, while 2507-8a are about 10mm thick. No. 2509: similar in texture and ornament to previous group, but of compact well-fired reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) ware throughout; bodysherd with average thickness of 8mm. No. 2510: from small vessel with upright neck and simple round-topped rim; body swells out slightly below neck. Overall profile may be like that of a small Bell Beaker. Ware, however, is that of coarse flat-bottomed pottery, very dark grey throughout and having friable gritty texture. Body portion of this sherd 7.5mm thick. Decoration, which occurs on neck, consists of two horizontal lines of slightly irregular finger-nail impressions. Nos 2511-12: conjoining bodysherds of heavy ware similar to that of Rusticated/Domestic Beaker; slip applied to outer surface; decoration consists of two horizontal panels of ornament. At bottom is horizontal line of comb with row of evenly spaced diagonal lines of thicker comb above, bordered above and below by line of fine comb. Second, similarly arranged panel is separated from first by a further line of fine comb. In this panel the diagonal lines are set opposite those below. Sherds 9mm-10mm thick. Nos 2513-43 belong to a type called 'small cup' by 6 Riordain (1954, 327-30, fig. 15). The ware generally contains no grits or temper and the vessels are simply made by drawing up the walls from a lump of clay. They can be round (2514-18) or flat-bottomed (2523). No. 2513: flat-topped rim with cavetto neck, unusually, has cavities indicating that a temper of some type was used. Nos 2514-18: from small round-bottomed example with maximum height of c. 4cm (Fig. 32). Nos 2771-5: from decorated vessel of hard compact gritty ware, similar to but finer than the coarse flat-bottomed ware vessels. Rim, 277T2, upright with flat top and rounded edges. Slightly curved neck and below this vessel has convex profile suggesting it may have been round - bottomed. Thickness increases from 6.5mm at rim to 8.5mm at bottom of 2775. On 2771 the decoration consists of five evenly spaced horizontal lines of cord ornament, three within curve of neck and two below. The upper two lines also occur on 2772 but third and fourth are replaced by off-vertical line.

Thin slip applied to outer face and sherd is decorated with three lines of cord ornament, two parallel and closely set and the third set at right angles to them and joining the outermost one. Nos 2777-8: of same ware as 2771-6. Both have lines of cord ornament. No. 2777 has raised horizontal ridge, possibly cordon, boss or shoulder. Below (or possibly above) this are two horizontal lines of cord with off-vertical line beneath, while 2778 has the two horizontal lines. Diameter at mouth c. 8cm. Although thinner at mouth, body averages 13mm thick. Nos 2519-22: rimsherds from four separate vessels with average thicknesses of 5mm, 9mm, 8mm and 8mm respectively. Vessels have approximate diameters at mouth of 6cm, 8cm, 6cm and 6cm. No. 2523: large portion of base and wall of flat-bottomed example. This vessel is particularly crude and has irregular and occasionally cratered surface. Horizontal line, executed by drawing finger-nail across the surface, near surviving top edge; vertical line extends upwards from this. No. 2524: worn, possibly from vessel of this type. The small size of these 'cups', the general absence of grits or temper and the frequently crude nature of their manufacture suggests that they may be children's playthings or practice pieces. No. 2525: flat basesherd from thin-walled (4mm) vessel which has slightly irregular surface. Ware contains small to medium calcite grits. There is an almost imperceptible foot-ring. While this may be a Beaker vessel the profile is not characteristic. No. 1614: a rim; 1615-18: bodysherds from undecorated vessel; rim rounded and vessel has S-shaped profile. Nos 1619-31: miscellaneous undecorated bodysherds; 1632 covers a group of broken or very worn fragments. [G15]</page><page sequence="130">428 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy J^?__ Kl .

There are three evenly spaced rows of inverted V-shaped stab-marks on 2660 executed with sharpened bone object. No. 2662: flat-topped rimsherd with slight outward protrusion; neck has softly curved profile; a single gapped, incised line occurs 2cm below rim. One other rimsherd (2663) is decorated with three triangular stab-marks set obliquely in horizontal row; rounded upright profile. Nos 2664-7: plain rimsherds. No. 2664: flat-topped, neck has gently curved profile. No. 2665: round-topped and upright; 2666 has broader rounded top and is slightly out-turned. No. 2667: an unusual sharply everted rim of very fine ware. There are eight decorated bodysherds. Nos 2668-9: from single vessel; band of three horizontal comb-impressed lines on 2668-9 while 2669 has single incised line. No. 2670 has five irregularly spaced horizontal lines of very fine comb. There are five gapped incised lines on 2677 while 2672 has two single widely spaced incised lines and frill of oblique rectangular stab-marks below. Nos 2673-4: from a single pot, possibly Vessel 30. They have evenly spaced, horizontally incised lines. Nos 2675-7: from another vessel; only 2675, which has two widely spaced incised lines, is decorated. The lines appear to have been executed together as they both overlap at the starting point. Nos 2678-93: undecorated bodysherds. No. 2694: basesherd with pronounced foot-ring; 2695 is from foot-ring itself. Nos 2455-6: flat-topped undecorated rimsherds. No. 2455: from same vessel as 2413-15; 2456 from very similar but slightly larger one. Nos 2457-8: from same vessel as 2418-20, have already been described. Nos 2459-60: from neck of vessel with row of vertical finger-nail impressions. Nos 2461-4: decorated bodysherds; 2465-9: undecorated bodysherds from same vessel as 2464, which has a small body. No. 2470: plain necksherd possibly from the same pot. Nos 2471-6 undecorated necksherds and 2477-96 bodysherds from same vessel or vessels as 2413-15, 2421-34, 2455-6. Nos 2497-9: basesherds. Nos 2497-8, which come from a single pot, have slight foot ring, while on 2499 the wall rises directly from base. There are eighty-six sherds of Beaker from the upper levels above the house, at Circle L (1633-718). Some of those (1634-40) are from vessels represented above, and they are described in the appropriate sections. Amongst the remaining seventy-nine sherds there are at least three vessels not previously noted (Fig. 50). No. 1633: rim with row of diagonal stab-marks immediately beneath it. Further down are three unevenly spaced lines of comb. No. 1641 has closely set, and 1643 widely spaced, incised lines which overlap slightly. The decoration on 1643, necksherd, is on inner face. No. 1642 has two deep quadrangular impressions. No. 1644 has two or possibly three rows of small dots and 1645 has two overlapping finger-nail impressions. Nos 1647-55: undecorated rimsherds which are round or flat-topped. Nos 1647-8: from a single vessel. Vessel 31: represented by twenty-four sherds (1656-79). Round-topped rim (1656-7): slightly everted; low cordon occurs immediately beneath on 1656. Second cordon below first also present on 1658-9. No. 1658: decorated with elongated diagonal stab-marks set opposite each other above and below cordon. No. 1660, a bodysherd, has two finger-nail impressions. Base, 1679, has slight out-turning at foot. No. 1680: damaged basesherd with simple angle between wall and foot. Nos 1681-90: undecorated bodysherds from vessel similar to No. 28. No 1691: from neck of pot with slight cordon and 1692-718 are miscellaneous bodysherds. Finds from unknown contexts Stone (Figs 56-9). As has already been mentioned, the finds index for the lithic assemblage has not survived and it was not possible to assign the material to a context. There are ninety-six pieces of flint and chert. Sixty-eight of these are artefacts (1792-859) and there are twenty-eight waste pieces, fifteen of chert (1866-80) and twelve of flint (1881-92); a piece of quartzo-sandstone, 1893, had been struck in the same manner as flint. As unusual feature at this site is that artefacts make up the majority (71 per cent) of the assemblage. Projectile heads (Fig. 56) (1792-7). No. 1792: fine bifacially worked leaf-shaped arrowhead; central portion not found, but tip and butt survive. No. 1793: lozenge-shaped example less well made than 1792. No. 1794: apparently unfinished tanged piece; only one face is worked. Although bifacially worked, 1795-6 have fine retouch on one face only. They are triangular pieces which probably served as javelin or arrowheads. No. 1797: detached half of apparently leaf-shaped roughout for small javelin head. Twenty-four scrapers came from the site (1798-820, 1851). Nos 1798-807 are thumb scrapers; the three latter examples are made from small flint pebbles. No. 1798: bifacially worked.

Six are end scrapers, 1814-19, while 1820 is a poorly worked fragment of flint pebble which may be a scraper. Nos 1821-8 have retouch along one long edge which can be curved (1822) or straight (1826-8), probably knives. No. 1821, which has been burnt and broken, is worked on one end and may also have been a scraper. No. 1822: bifacially worked. Nos 1827-8 may be portions of the same artefact. Nos 1829-40: blades: 1841-7: points; 1845 has fine retouch along one side. Remaining utilised pieces show evidence of having been carefully struck, but most do not belong to any artefact class. Nos 1850 and 1857 may be broken or unfinished blades; 1857 is butt-trimmed. No. 1852 could be a broken scraper or knife. Fourteen pieces of quartz crystal (1860-5, 1957-64). Nos 1860-5 display evidence of deliberate working (Fig. 57) but remaining fragments could have been broken accidentally. No. 1860 appears to be a core from which thin blades were removed, possibly by pressure flaking. Nos 1861-5 have been retouched in the same manner as flint or chert and probably functioned as scrapers. Although evidently from different levels on the site, this assemblage displays considerable homogeneity suggesting that little alteration in artefact manufacture took place during the period of occupation. Although the flint used is in most cases poor, the quality of workmanship is generally good and some of the artefacts, notably 1792, 1795-6 and 1822 which were all made from comparatively large pieces of flint, are very finely retouched. Axes (Figs 58-9; PL XV). Eight complete (1893-900) and five large fragments (1901-5). No. 1893: close-grained granite; some damage to blade and butt, otherwise well preserved; blade is slightly convex, one side straight, other gently curved. Straight side not ground down to same extent as rest of artefact; profile symmetric and section a pointed oval; butt thin. No. 1894: chloritic tuff, blade damaged but may have had marked junction with sides; oblique butt thin and pointed. One side virtually straight, while other is convex; straight side has flat facet. On face illustrated broad facet occurs along main axis, while on reverse a number of areas have been ground to erase natural irregularities in stone. Blade of 1895, mudrock, damaged but may have been gently curved; butt thin and pointed while sides are slightly convex. Narrow, slightly irregular facets occur on both sides. No. 1896, greenstone, has slightly convex blade which still retains its cutting edge; irregular sides gently curved. Butt damaged but may have been either flattened or pointed; thin profile. A green/grey patina occurs over most of one face and this shows that most of the irregularities are natural; profile not symmetric, one face is convex while other is gently curved. No. 1897: well preserved with only slight damage on butt and blade. Blade gently curved and butt flattened; both have marked junctions with side. One side slightly curved while other virtually straight. Profile asymmetric, one face convex while other is straight. However, blade is symmetric, suggesting natural shape of stone dictated overall profile. No. 1897: sandstone. No. 1898: chloritic tuff, well preserved; most of surface irregularities appear to be natural; blade gently curved while butt probably had similar outline. Marked junctions with sides; sides virtually straight but very sharp widening of axe near blade. Both the shape and the profile (one face convex and the other straight) are probably due to the natural shape of the stone. No. 1899, mudrock, well preserved; some of the chipping along sides may be result of shaping of axe but most of this is natural. Blade still retains cutting edge, convex and slightly oblique, and thin butt is rounded. Marked junction between blade and sides which are virtually straight; profile symmetric. Ground and polished facets occur on both faces. No. 1900, mudrock, well preserved; curved blade retains cutting edge, very marked junction with sides, splayed. Sides otherwise virtually straight; butt flattened and slightly oblique and has marked junction with sides. Profile symmetric, ground or polished facets occur on butt, faces and sides. No. 1901: greenstone, large fragment of axe from blade end. Blade, well preserved, gently curved and slightly oblique; sides may have been straight. Slight facets along both sides; profile symmetric. No. 1902: fine-grained granite, butt end of axe. Butt virtually straight, and has marked junction with sides; pointed profile. One side straight and other curved; facets on both; section oval. No. 1903: fine grained granite blade end of large axe; blade convex and has marked junction with one side. Both sides faceted and appear to be straight; profile symmetric and section oval. No. 1904: coarse grained andesite, mid section of large axe or hammer. Virtually straight sides and tapered from edge to butt; polished or ground facets around and on sides; oval section.

Finds from unknown contexts-bone (1980-92) and lignite (1993). Lignite. No. 1993: small fragment of lignite bracelet (Fig. 60); curved piece, broken at one end but smooth and apparently finished at other; oval cross-section. Towards smooth end is a small hourglass perforation made after the object had been polished. Information on bag suggested that it had come from below floor level of Central House. Bone (Fig. 60). No. 1965: segmented bead with four U- to V-sectioned 'waists' separating the five segments. Cross-section subrectangular to triangular, while cylindrical perforation has oval section. Bead finely polished, indicating it is finished artefact rather than roughout for production of smaller beads. Twenty-four bone points (1980-9). Context of this material and of 1990-2 below not known, nor has it been possible to locate objects themselves. A selection was, however, drawn for publication when the original report was draughted in 1951 and this is reproduced here (Fig. 60); descriptions based on that text. There is a considerable variety in the types represented and this includes a thin flat piece (1980), more rounded examples made from split bones (1983-4)</page><page sequence="138">436 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy and sharply pointed pins (1985). One example (1986) of common form produced by removing an oblique section from end of pointed round bone. No. 1987: rounded at point only; may have been used as perforator. No. 1988: obliquely cut and this produced a gouge-like implement. A very well-finished example of a bone chisel (1990) 'was found on old ground level on a charcoal area and had been burnt'. Implement made by polishing edge of split bone to form a chisel, in this case with very fine edge. No. 1991: similar but more crudely made example fashioned by cutting to thin point the two sides of fairly thick fragment of bone, broad end forming the working edge. No. 1992 tapers towards both ends; thin notch is cut parallel to broader sides at each end. Smoother face has series of fine parallel incisions made either deliberately by cutting with blade or in some manner incidental to its use. Irregularly rectangular cross-section. Purpose of this object unknown. Animal bone. Although animal bones are referred to throughout the field notebook and preliminary report, only a few small fragments (1967-78) can now be located. The context of this material is unknown, although it is evident that animal bones were found at all levels of activity. No. 1967: small portion of a rib (?) which has been cut diagonally. No. 1976 may also be from a rib but the other pieces are too fragmentary for identification. All except 1970 had been burnt, and 1971-2 and 1978 are calcified. Nos 1979a-b are cattle teeth. Two pieces of antler (1993-4). No. 1993 has two tines; both shaped towards tips which are abraded and worn. Appears to have served as digging implement. No. 1994, tine, similarly worn and abraded, may have had same function. There are distinct diagonal cut marks or scars near the tip. Both pieces broken at proximal end. (See Appendix C.) Iron. Two pieces from unknown context. No. 1996: oval ring with rectangular cross-section and may be belt buckle; 1997 is a nail. It expands gradually towards a simple flat head and has a square to rectangular cross-section. Other finds. There are two clay pipes. No. 1998 is a virtually complete bowl from a 'churchwarden' type. A band of cog-wheel decoration occurs immediately beneath the mouth. No. 1999 is a fragment from a similar bowl. Two lead musket balls (2079, 2020) came from the centre of the enclosure immediately beneath the sod. They have maximum diameters of 18mm. Two samples of plant seed remains were examined by Michael Monk, Department of Archaeology, University College, Cork. The first sample, of hazelnut shells (2021), came from square 22 near the centre of the enclosure. These were associated with charcoal at a depth of 90cm. Dr Monk reported that these were the 'charred shells of hazelnuts, Corytus avellana. In all there were 76 fragments from 2mm to 15mm maximum length but of these only three were complete enough to measure. Two of these were half nut shell fragments and had measurable dimensions of 15mm width by 13mm maximum height and 11mm by 10.2mm. A third fragment was longer, 12.4mm by 14.2mm in height. Charred hazelnut shells that have similar variations in size and shape have been found widely on early prehistoric sites and it is very likely that hazelnuts were an important food supplement from the earliest times in Ireland.' The second sample (2022) came from between the stones of the enclosure wall at a high level (47cm) in square 9. These 'consisted of haw stones of the hawthorn. These were not charred and since they were not retrieved from a waterlogged situation they are probably modern. The interesting thing about them is that they each have a little hole in the top made by a rodent of some kind?possibly a mouse or shrew?and since they were together, they probably came from an animal hoard.' Remarks There were two main phases at Circle L. As at Circles J and K occupation took place before construction of the circle itself. Although no clearly defined plans survive there was extensive evidence for at least three houses, the first phase of the Central House and Possible Houses A and B. The complexity and number of features associated with House A, on the northern side of the site, suggest that it may have been rebuilt on a number of occasions. Whether these three structures were in use together or</page><page sequence="139">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 437 successively is not certain, but the homogeneity of the pre-enclosure assemblage indicates that they were at least broadly contemporary. The central structure was replaced by the oval house, the main dwelling of the enclosed habitation. It was impossible to establish any precise sequence for the pottery because of the disturbance caused by the prolonged and intensive occupation on the site. However, a general trend is apparent in the change in the relative percentage of each type between the two main phases (Diagram 1, p. 480). In the pre-enclosure phase western neolithic pottery represented 47 per cent of the assemblage, coarse flat-bottomed ware accounted for 26 per cent and Beaker made up 34 per cent (all percentages based on sherd counts). In the second, enclosed stage the figures were 16 per cent, 18 per cent and 63 per cent respectively. Two important factors must, however, be borne in mind here. First, 75 per cent of all the pottery from the earlier phase came from the vicinity of the Central House so that this was not only the area of most intensive activity but also the location of the later oval house. Second, 75 per cent of all the Beaker pottery at Circle L came from this central area, while 70 per cent of the Domestic form was associated with the later house itself. In view of these facts the apparently large percentage of Beaker in the earlier phase may be explained in terms of later intrusion; nevertheless some overlap in the use of this type of pottery and western neolithic ware is probable. Support for this suggestion comes from the relative stability in the amount of coarse flat-bottomed ware and the general continuity indicated by the construction of the later oval house as a replace ment for the earlier one, the continued use of Pit 1 and the building of the circle directly on top of the pre-enclosure occupation material. The sequence at Circle L, therefore, appears to be a phase of unprotected occupation, represented by three houses (either successive or contemporary) associated with a western neolithic assemblage having a smaller coarse flat-bottomed ware component, succeeded by a period when Beaker pottery was the dominant form but was associated with the continued, if limited, use of the other two types. The construction of the enclosure wall probably occurred at this stage and during the final occupation of the site Beaker may have been the only form of "pottery in use. An unusual feature of the pottery assemblage, particularly of the western neolithic material, was the lack of wear to most of the sherds which, apart from indicating a limited amount of disturbance (other than in the area of the Central House), allowed for the reconstruction, on paper, of the rim to shoulder profiles of fifteen vessels (6, 6a and 7-20, Figs 40-1). 'Simple' forms predominate (see pp 396-9, 415, 420-1) and many of the vessels are comparable to Case's Ballymarlagh style, although the mean thickness of the Circle L vessels is closer to, and in many instances finer than, his Dunmurry style (Case 1961, 175-7). The Circle L material has ready parallels elsewhere on Knockadoon, especially Site B (O Riordain 1954, fig. 7). Two radiocarbon dates from Circle L are both from the first phase of the Central House. They are 4690 ? 240 b.p. (D-41, 2740 b.c.) and 4410 ? 240 b.p (D-40, 2460 b.c). As both have very large standard deviations and as this area was one of intensive later activity, they are of limited value in dating the site. Site 10 (Figs 61-71; Pis XlXb-XXb) This is an enclosed habitation dating to the later Neolithic and Beaker periods. Initially, towards the end of the Neolithic, an open settlement was associated with a poorly defined house. In the second phase the site was protected by a double-kerbed wall which cut Site 10 off from the rest of the peninsula. The enclosure produced an assemblage dominated by Beaker, but activity, represented by a small quantity of Food Vessel pottery, continued on into the Early Bronze Age.</page><page sequence="140">r)\ ---~ v-: - -&gt; - .- "' ----- \ ''/'^-10.50-,' 750-I L^\^..

The enclosure wall on the northern side of the site looking towards the entrance.</page><page sequence="142">440 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy This site is on a naturally level platform at the south-western corner of the Knockadoon peninsula (Fig. 1; OS 6" Limerick sheet 32, 16.0cm from N, 15.2cm from W) only a short distance from the lake shore which it overlooks to the south. The platform, 34m by 20m, is bounded on the eastern and western sides by outcrops of limestone. To the south-west the ground falls away in a series of broad steps to the lake shore. Before excavation a double-kerbed wall was visible running across the northern side of the site joining these outcrops (Pl. XXa); excavation concentrated on the southern and eastern sides of the main platform. In addition a short length of wall bounding the eastern side of a lower platform to the south was exposed and two trial trenches (not shown on plan) were opened to the south of the site but produced no evidence of activity. The most recent aerial photographs (Pl. I) show that the site was enclosed on at least three sides and only the southern edge, which faces the lake, is without a wall. Site 10 was excavated in 1954. Pre-enclosure activity (Fig. 62; Pl. XlXb) The main feature of the pre-enclosure phase was a habitation layer covering the entire main platform except where the rock outcrop was close to the surface. It extended under and beyond the wall to the north and contained large quantities of charcoal, animal bones, stones and pottery as well as other finds. It occurred directly on the old ground surface which, apart from a small area on the southern part of the main platform of yellow clay, was made up of the limestone bedrock. Material was deepest on the northern side of the site, where it averaged 30cm, but where there were natural dips and hollows in the rock it was up to 50cm deep. Over the rest of the excavated area it averaged less than 20cm. Seventeen post-holes and three stake-holes had been dug into the yellow clay at the southern side of the main platform. They were 30cm-60cm in diameter and occurred over an area 12.8m by 4m. No structural plan could be discerned, although the main central group formed three rough lines or arcs and may have been associated with a shelter or lean-to built against the rock outcrop to the south (Fig. 62, Pl. XlXb; Possible Structure). A number of the post-holes retained packing stones and most contained some charcoal and animal bones. A few other post-holes occurred in the rock outcrop on the northern side of the main platform, including one under the outer face of the later wall. A large pit, 90cm in diameter and 20cm deep, partly formed by rock outcrop, occurred 3.2m north-east of the enclosure entrance (Fig. 62, Pit). The pit fill consisted of dark earth containing a high charcoal content and some animal bone. Finds Stone (Figs 63-6). Seventy-three artefacts or utilised pieces of flint and chert came from this level. Both materials were worked and the waste consisted of forty-one pieces of flint and 193 of chert (No. 71). In general the chert was of better quality than the flint, which came from small pebbles. However, almost half of the artefacts were made of flint. The retouch on both types of material is mainly of a high standard. Projectile heads (l-14b): seventeen examples. No. 1: laurel-leaf point finely worked on both faces. Nos 2-12b: leaf-shaped arrowheads. Nos 2-9: bifacially worked; on 2-5 and 8 (fragment from centre of arrowhead) retouch is of high calibre. No. 7 has an elongated point; 9 has rounded head and is broken across base. Roughouts or unfinished examples: six pieces, 10-12b. Nos 10, lie (not illustrated) and 12b have little or no retouch while the working on the others, lla-b and 12a, occurs on both faces but is incomplete. No. 13: portion of large point, possibly javelin head, although there is no retouch on one flat side. Single barbed and tanged arrowhead, 14b, is neatly and regularly made. Forty scrapers come from this level; most, 15-38, generally rounded although only a few, such as 16 and 17, are good round scrapers. Only working faces of 28-9 survive.

End scrapers (39-49): most (41-6) finely worked; retouch usually confined to rounded end. On 43-5, however, working also occurs on one long side. No. 47: unusually long in relation to width, working poor. No. 44 made from flint pebble, retains part of cortex. Nos 50-4 have working along one long side and may be side scrapers. Retouch on most scrapers shallow but steep retouch occurs on several examples like 17, 21, 24, 32, 41 and 44. Nos 55-7: retouch along both long sides; pointed or rounded at one or both ends.

No. 73: greenstone, oval cross-section and pointed butt; several chips in surface including damage to blade which has good cutting edge. Axe clearly made from stone which was already pitted as most of the indentations have been polished. No. 74: greenstone; roughly triangular in shape, rounded butt and oval cross-section with polished facet along one side. Good cutting edge with only small amount of wear. No. 75: large fragment, green tuff, from near butt; pointed oval cross-section; 76, coarse-grained gabbro, is rounded butt with oval section.

Fourteen chips of greenstone axes all No. 80 (not illustrated). Nos 81a-b: portions of grey-green mudrock spearhead with thin pointed oval cross-section. These are not conjoining and both point and butt are damaged. Spearhead similar to those from Sites A and C (1949) (O Riordain 1954, 310, fig. 4: 2 and 379, pl. XXXIIb: 1) and Circle J (p. 316, Fig. 6: 374). Beads (Figs 65-6). Nineteen stone and thirteen bone beads (86-118). Stone: 86-104, all thin and appear to be made from suitably sized pebbles which were easy to perforate rather than being manufactured in any particular size or shape. Range well paralleled by that from Site D (6 Riordain 1954, 407, pl. XLVIb). Most hourglass perforations; some regular and well executed (89-90), others uneven (91, 99). Nos 93, 100, 103 bored from one side only but these also have dished opening while 96, 98, 102 have cylindrical perforations. No. 96 has beginnings of second perforation. Nos 86-91: irregularly shaped ranging from roughly oval, 87 and 89, to quadrangular, 88 and 91. Nos 86-90 similar size with maximum dimensions of 17mm-21mm while 91 is 14mm long. Nos 92-4: larger oval beads or pendants 31-5mm long; 95, subrectangular pendant 64mm long and 45mm wide. Perforation in 92, and probably in 94, positioned near one long side while those on 93 (bored from one side only) and 95 are roughly central. Nos 96-103: approximately circular and have, except for 98, central perforations; diameters range from 20mm (No. 96) to 13mm (No. 100). Nos 97-100: flat on one side and domed on other. No. 101: similar but smaller (10mm) example. Two small cylindrical beads, 102 and 103, 11mm in diameter. No. 104: portion of bead which may have been similar to Nos 86-7. Nos 88, 91, 95, 99 of serpentine, while others are made of black shale, siltstone and mudstone (see Appendix A). Eight of the bone beads (105-12) were found together under rubble fill of enclosure wall to west of entrance. These evidently formed a necklace. Nos 105-12: segmented beads; 105 has four segments, 106a has three and 106b is probably part of it, 107-9 are complete triple-segmented beads while 110-11 are portions of similar examples, possibly the same one. No. 112 has two segments, more rounded than others. No. 113: simple oval bead. Of the other bone beads 114</page><page sequence="149">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 447 is a double-segmented piece larger than 112, while 115-16 are simple oval beads similar to 113. No. 117: cylindrical length of bone with cut edges showing its use in manufacture of beads; 118 is cut from such a cylinder but unpolished and still having one rough cut edge (see O Riordain 1954, 409, fig. 42: 5, 6). Bone pins and points (Fig. 66) (see Appendix C for bone identification). Two polished bone pins, 119 and 120a, and portion of another, 120b. No. 119: 97mm long; most of length has pointed oval cross-section; top damaged. Both tip and head of 120a are missing; oval cross-section with natural channel down one side; 57mm long. No. 120b: broken fragment of polished pin possibly re-used as point. Nos 121-2: large points made from distal ends of cattle humeri; manufactured by splitting bones and sharpening them with oblique cuts. These two points are probably too large to have been used in leather-working for example, but might have served as digging implements. Nos 123-33: considerably smaller and made from bone flakes; more pointed, where tips survive, than other two and probably for leather-working. Nos 134a-q: not illustrated. No. 135: part of parallel-sided object with rounded 'blade', probably gouge or chisel; 136 is a scoop or gouge. No. 137: large oval scoop or spoon. Nos 138-43r, 2046, 2065: (twenty-five) flakes of bone with cut marks which are the raw material for, or waste pieces from, the manufacture of bone points and possibly beads. None illustrated. No. 144a-c, 2082: four pieces of pig tusk with cut marks (not illustrated). Pottery. Three hundred and twenty sherds of western neolithic pottery representing at least thirty five vessels (Fig. 67). Generally thin, varies in thickness from 6mm to 8mm; well-fired hard ware with smooth outer surface; inner one consistently less carefully finished. Grits common, usually calcite or very fine quartzite. The larger of these were frequently removed from the outer surface before firing and the surface then smoothed over leaving characteristic lipped cavities. The colour varied considerably, even on the same vessel, but dark reddish brown to grey is the most common while some vessels are, at least in part, light reddish brown. Most of the pots have simple rounded out-turned or bulbous rims (145-8, 162-5) but those with a pointed profile and a flat inward-sloping upper surface also occur (335-6). There are also a few rims which are turned out at right angles to the shoulder (347-8, 350). The necks of most vessels were upright but 277-84 and 349 were sharply curved. Where information was available it appears that all of the pottery was carinated, but the shoulders usually consist of a simple change of direction and none of the angular examples common at other Lough Gur sites are represented. It was possible partly to reconstruct the profiles of four vessels. Rim- 145-8, shoulder- 149-57 and bodysherds 159-61 come from Vessel 1, with a simple rounded rim, upright neck and rounded shoulder. Outer surface black and smooth with few grits while inner is red, rough and gritty. Nos 162-5: similar rims to 145-8 while 166-8 are shoulders and 169-72 bodysherds from similar vessels. Vessel 2: represented by thirty-three sherds (173-205) including thirteen rims (173-85) and six shouldersherds (186-91). Almost vertical neck with out-turned bulbous rim giving an inward sloping upper surface; shoulder consists of a simple angle; well-fired ware, grey to dark brown containing high proportion of crushed calcite grits. Outer surface and inner portion of rim have smooth finish. Nos 206-9 are rims and 210-12 bodysherds of similar vessels. Vessel 3: represented by fifty-one sherds, 213-64: profile from rim to shoulder flared with even curve; only slight out-turning of rim itself. Some rimsherds (213-27), such as 213-20, have flat top but others more rounded. Shoulder (227-32) forms slight step. Ware slightly corky with pitted but smooth outer surface; contains crushed quartzite grits. Vessel 4: twenty-three sherds (277-99). Six other bodysherds (300-5) may belong also to this vessel. Considerably larger than other three vessels, with diameter at rim of c. 18cm. Shoulder (285-9): simple sharp angle and above this neck follows consistent curve into rim which deviates outwards only slightly from this curve. Rim (277-84) folded over inwards leaving characteristic 'lip' immediately beneath it on inside; flat, inward-sloping upper surface. Hard red to black well-fired ware containing crushed quartz and calcite grits. Walls of vessel vary in thickness from 6mm above the shoulder to 5mm beneath. Three beaded rimsherds (265-7) from vessel similar to No. 3, while 268-70 cover thirty-seven bodysherds which are thinner than 243-9; 269a-n and 270a-g are of harder ware with smooth</page><page sequence="150">448 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy It i _ 2,,&lt;?% lit |49j173 174 I f0*&gt; J J : V.2 Jf186i 227 V3 216228 ?.j.ft M 279 280 265 306 309 315 I-1 !

Nos 271-4 are shouldersherds with a medium step and 275a-g bodysherds which also come from a vessel like that represented by 213-49. While it is unlikely that any of the clearly carinated vessels were flat-bottomed the presence of one flat basesherd, 275h, and three other sherds (276a-c) of identical ware with one flat face and a thickening towards one side on the other face, indicate that this possibility cannot be entirely discounted. Rimsherd 306: hard well-fired grey ware with calcite grits; out-turned and folded over leaving lip on outer surface. No. 307: worn shouldersherd, 308a-q bodysherds of same ware. No. 309: two conjoining rimsherds of similar fabric and shape to 306. Sherds thinner, 4mm, belong to vessel with outcurving rim which has an external swelling immediately beneath it. No. 310a, rim of this ware but more markedly everted than 309, while on 310b rim is set at right angles to neck; top</page><page sequence="151">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 449 rounded. Lip along inner edge where folded over before being turned out. On outer face, at junction with neck, is a broad channel; ware red throughout, hard and slightly abrasive. Four rimsherds, 311-14: from poorly made vessel with rounded, everted rim and pronounced swelling immediately beneath on outside; ware red to grey containing fine quartzite grits. Nos 315-21: sherds of hard, well-fired red ware with gritty texture, from vessel with angular everted rim, curved neck and simple angle shoulder. There are twenty-four other rimsherds. Nos 322-6: upright rounded variety; slight swelling immediately beneath rim on outer surface of 323-4 (bodysherds) while 325 has a groove in similar position. Nos 327-9: out-turned; 330-3: fragments of rounded rims. Three rim-, 335-7, and two bodysherds, 338-9, from vessel with everted, almost pointed rim with flat inward-sloping upper surface. No. 335 shows that the clay was first folded over outwards before the rim was pinched out, as it has cracked along the fold during firing; ware gritted with fine calcite, generally light reddish brown on surfaces but mottled on inside. Nos 340-1: everted, slight external thickening immediately beneath rim. Outer face is black and smooth with few cavities left by grit removal prior to firing. Inner surface light reddish brown, heavily pitted, gritting of calcite. Nos 342-6: bodysherds of same vessel. No. 347: rounded rim, everted at right angles to neck. This effected by bending over rim between thumb and forefinger leaving finger-nail impressions at junction between neck and rim on outside. Ware hard and well fired with calcite gritting. No. 348: rimsherd of large well-fired vessel with gritty texture; rim everted at right angles and has flat upper surface; upper portion of pot folded before turning rim outwards. No. 349: angular rim; black smooth ware containing fine quartzite grits. No. 350: rounded, almost beaded rim; ware unusually hard, very well fired, light red throughout containing small amount of large quartzite grits. Conjoining shouldersherds, 351-2, from vessel with smooth inner and rough outer surface; ware contains calcite grits; shoulder has medium step and neck upright. No. 353: neck and part of rim of similar vessel with curved rim to shoulder profile. No. 354: necksherd of this pot. No. 355: like that of 277-99 but shoulder less angular. Nos 356-8: bodysherds, similar vessels. Nos 359-62: thirty-three bodysherds whose ware can be paralleled amongst the featured examples but cannot be specifically identified with any of them. Only three decorated western neolithic (6 Riordain's Class la) vessels are represented at Site 10 (Fig. 67). First (363-8): good quality smooth ware; fine quartzite gritting. Core brown with black inner and outer surface. Rim everted with tendency to be pointed, has flat, inward-sloping upper surface similar to No. 4. Vessel 4: rim formed by first folding inwards top edge of rim and then pinching rim itself leaving slight lip along inner edge. Neck upright and unusually high. Three rimsherds, 363-5, have shallow radiating channels spaced 2mm-3mm apart like decoration on pot from Site B (6 Riordain 1954, fig. 9:1). No shoulder- or bodysherd found. Second vessel represented by rim, 369, and two conjoining shouldersherds, 370-1. Rim made from single applied coil and rimsherds broken at joint with neck. Decorated with fringe of short diagonal lines set 4mm in from outer edge and defined on that side by line concentric to edge. On inner side of this are two opposed rows of acute lines separated from fringe by undecorated band 3mm wide. Three lines, parallel to the fringe, may indicate similar decoration along now broken inner edge. Shoulder: large step (5mm) typical of this pottery form. Band of decoration, three broad and very shallow channels with diagonal channels contained within the two outer horizontal ones, immediately beneath shoulder. Similar to that on shoulder from Sjte C (6 Riordain 1954, fig. 14:16). Ware corky and retains grass impression beneath shoulder on sherd 370. Few grits of fine quartzite. Third vessel: single worn sherd, 372, rim set at right angles to neck. Slight extension on inside suggests restricted club form. Flat upper surface decorated with radiating channels similar to those on 363-5; single diagonal stroke along damaged outer edge may indicate fringe like that on 369. Ware grey to light red; corky containing calcite grits. At least fifteen vessels of coarse flat-bottomed ware occurred in the pre-enclosure level and these are represented by over seven hundred sherds. Some vessels carefully finished with slip which gives them a smooth dusty texture while others have an irregular gritty exterior. Most sherds crumbly and poorly preserved and only small selection illustrated (Fig. 68). Nos 893-6: rimsherds from three separate vessels. Rims have inward bevel, slightly curved, and below is slight shoulder. Nos 893-4 have external criss-cross diagonal grooves while 895-6 have continuous row of V-shaped designs filled with diagonal lines and may be from different vessel. Decoration on all four sherds incised. No. 895 also has lightly incised crossing lines on inside of rim.

Three undecorated rimsherds, 902-4, of same form as 893-6 but of harder, better-fired ware containing numerous quartzite grits; cylindrical perforation through 902. Nos 905a-i: bodysherds of same vessel. No. 906: fragment of rim like 893-6 from smaller vessel. Ten decorated sherds, 907-16, come from shouldered (914-19) vessel with flat base (920). Ornament of scattered crossing incised lines although 910-11 have remains of triangular or lozenge shaped designs. Ware poor quality with dark interior and core and red outer surface. Numerous grits of crushed quartzite and sandstone protrude through surface. Substantial part of large, flat-rimmed (922-8) and flat-based (929-38) vessel represented by forty-four large sherds (922-39) and sixteen smaller pieces (all 940). Rim slightly pinched out and has flat inward-sloping top. Ware of very good quality, 16mm thick; buff exterior and black interior. Grits of fine quartzite numerous but only occasionally visible in smooth surface. Although not possible to reconstruct vessel fully it has diameter at mouth of about 18cm, at base of about 13cm and is 18cm-21cm high. Slight swelling of body just below rim from which it tapers to base. Base: flat disc of clay to which wall was joined (930). Four basesherds (941-4), seventeen bodysherds (945-6) and seven small fragments (all 947) come from similar vessel. No. 945 pinched-up internal cordon from near rim. Ware much more friable and contains higher quality of quartzite grits. Wall 13mm thick, outer part cream, inner portion black. Wall splays out more from base than previous vessel indicating more open form. At least four other vessels of this form of coarse, unevenly made ware. Group consisting of fifteen rims (948-62), basesherd (963) and fifty bodysherds (all 964), some of less than thumb nail size, represent at least two and possibly three vessels. Nos 948-9 upright with inward bevel, 9mm thick, while 950-1, of same form, are 14mm. Nos 952-62 may be from same pot as 948-9 but are flat-topped with slight inward projection in some cases, e.g. 955-7. Poorly preserved basesherd (963) from flat-based vessel. Nos 965-6 rounded rims and 967-9 cover forty-two bodysherds of more compact ware, generally black with thin red outer surface; some compact red throughout. Liberal quantities of volcanic ash grits protrude through surface giving sherds abrasive quality; average thickness 11mm. Two rounded rimsherds, three fragments (969-7lc) and eleven bodysherds (all 972) from vessel of compact black ware containing numerous very fine quartzite grits; two other rimsherds and five bodysherds (973-5) of similar ware. Basesherds, 976-7, of well-fired red ware with calcite grits with profiles like 941-4. Six bodysherds (978) and thirty-five fragments (979) not related to vessels described above. Large collection, 400 sherds, from immediately inside wall on western side of site (1186-216) represent at least two and possibly three vessels. Fragmentary condition and reconstruction not possible. Ware 8mm-10mm thick with rough uneven surface containing numerous limestone grits. Black to brown or even red in places; rims (1186-205) flat-topped or with slight inward bevel even on same vessel (e.g. 1186, 1188). Four hundred and nineteen sherds of Beaker pottery from pre-enclosure occupation (Figs 58, 69) represent at least twenty-four vessels although it was not possible to reconstruct any examples. Majority from fine vessels which average 6mm. Very fine grits of calcite and quartzite occur in all, quantity varied considerably ? some sherds (e.g. 623-30) containing liberal amounts and others (405-16) relatively few. In most cases grits visible on surface. Ware generally compact and well fired, although sherds 378-89, 423-32 and 447-60 are very similar to much of western neolithic pottery. Light red and light reddish brown most common; texture mainly dusty but some sherds (e.g. 652-64) abrasive. One hundred and eleven sherds decorated; these from about eleven vessels. Decoration arranged horizontally with addition of oblique lines or fringes in a few cases (e.g. 375, 413). Vessel 5: fifteen sherds (378-89); rim rounded, below is pinched-up external cordon. Immediately beneath, three evenly spaced horizontal lines of comb decoration divided from two similar lines by undecorated band. Two uppermost lines more deeply impressed than others. Corky appearance and ware very similar to some western neolithic pottery in pre-enclosure assemblage. Light red externally, very dark grey internally, containing large quartzite grits, some protruding through outer surface. Vessel 6 (390-400): flat rim, elongated S-shaped profile. Ware light red, compact and well bonded with very fine quartzite grits. Smooth, slightly shiny surface; walls 5mm thick. Decoration: two broad shallow channels, set horizontally, upper one 2cm beneath rim. Separated from three similar channels by undecorated band 2.7cm wide.</page><page sequence="154">452 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Two other groups of sherds (423-33, 447-60) of same ware; 423-33 may be from lower portions of a single vessel. No. 447: rounded rim with two slight cordons or swellings beneath from vessel with upright neck with two discontinuous horizontal incised lines. Five decorated (448-50) and eleven undecorated sherds from a single vessel (457-60). Ornament of discontinuous slightly overlapping incised lines. One hundred and eleven sherds are decorated; these from about eleven vessels. Decoration arranged horizontally with addition of oblique lines of fringes in a few cases (e.g. 375, 413). Twelve decorated rimsherds: 374-402b and 447; 374 slightly flattened on top, buff throughout and thickens from the top (5mm) to bottom (8mm); decoration on both faces. Exterior has three evenly spaced horizontal lines or poorly executed comb impressions. Beneath these is shallow V formed by broad incised line. Interior has three thumb-nail impressions forming line 7mm beneath rim. Nos 375-6: conjoining rimsherds, 5mm thick, with slightly curved profile. Two parallel incised lines, upper one 11mm beneath rim, crossed by four thumb-nail impressions. Ware contains some grog and small amount of fine quartzite grits. No. 377: very similar ware and decoration, although thumb-nail impressions do not intersect single horizontal line present. Nos 401a-b: rounded rimsherds?single vessel decorated with oval impressions on interior immediately beneath rim. Small, poorly preserved, flat-topped rimsherd, 403, has two lines of cord decoration on interior. Two bodysherds, 404a-b, have more carefully applied cord decoration on inner surface; first has single line of comb and three lines of poorly preserved comb decoration on exterior, while 404b has two lines of cord internally and two lines of incised or possibly comb decoration on outer surface. Nos 405-9: possibly from the vessel represented by rims 375-6. Each has two bands of horizontal decoration separated by blank area. On 405-6 bands consist of evenly spaced row of short oval impressions with line, or, on one side of 405, two lines, of comb decoration. No. 407: two lines of comb on either side of blank area and fringe of vertical strokes beneath uppermost example. On 408-10, decoration is more prominent; over second line of comb is another fringe with incised groove running through it and another directly above. Nos 411-12: five lines of comb decoration, upper two separated from others by two alternating rows of evenly spaced oval to D-shaped impressions. Compact smooth ware same as 405-10, reddish brown on surfaces, dark core; these sherds may be from the same vessel. Nos 413-14: similar ware with smooth shiny exterior. Decoration very finely executed consisting of three closely spaced lines of comb with fringe of triangular impressions immediately underneath. Sherd broken at bottom along junction of two coils and core retains thumb impressions which had come through from exterior when coils were being joined. No. 415: two oval impressions on outer surface; from same pot as 413-14, also broken along junction of two coils. No. 416: two closely spaced lines of comb decoration. Four other sherds, 417-20, also have fine comb impressions. Four lines on 421, two on either side of band of oblique strokes, while 422 has similar band. Nos 423-32: corky ware with reddish brown outer surface, darker core and inner face. Decoration on 423-8 consists of one or two horizontal and one oblique line of comb. No. 433: of same ware and may be from same vessel although ornament consists of single line of comb with two lines of discontinuous strokes, which does not occur on 423-8. Nos 434-42: sherds of same vessel as 433 with parallel lines of poorly preserved comb, as on 443-6 which are from different pots. Nos 461-75: decorated with parallel lines of incision. In some cases these are thin, 461-2, while on others, such as 446-7, they form shallow grooves. Both closely (462, 464) and widely (467-8) spaced lines occur. The other sherds, 476-81, have impressed designs. No. 482: three very worn lines of decoration, possibly comb, on exterior and single finger-nail impression on interior. Twenty-four undecorated rimsherds, 484a-5 09. Nos 484a and 485 a: flat-topped while others, with exception of single pointed example, 504, are rounded. Vessels with slightly flared rims represented by 485 a, 492-3, 504, while others are upright. No. 484 a: slight, pinched-up cordon on outer surface, ware usually fine and well bonded; most sherds c. 6mm thick but 489 and 493-7 are up to 8mm.

Four hundred and sixty-three undecorated bodysherds (535-844, not every sherd has an individual number). Nos 535-602 are sherds from a vessel or vessels of fine ware. Both surfaces are light red in colour and the core is dark. They vary in thickness from 6mm to 9mm. There are relatively few fine quartzite grits and grog is present in some sherds, e.g. 535. Nos 603-22 are from a vessel of this ware but with a slightly corky dark inner surface while 623-30 are less well finished and the inner surface is uneven and has a high quantity of larger, protruding grits. Nos 631-51 are thinner sherds with a more gritty texture and 652-64 are a collection of pieces with a hard abrasive quality. Nos 665-78 and 679-92 are sherds of fine dusty cream ware; the first group are 6mm in average thickness while the others average 4mm. Eighteen sherds, 693-710, of hard grey ware with fine quartz grits come from the same vessel(s) as rims 489-91 and 504. Nos 711-98 are of fine reddish brown ware, with an average thickness of 4mm-5mm; these are from the same pots as rimsherds 484a, 487-8 and 505. The remaining sherds, 799-844, vary from red, very gritty pieces like 799-809, to eroded and damaged examples (810-38) which may be from vessels similar to those represented by 535-630. Nos 839-44 cover 114 very small or badly preserved fragments. One hundred and forty-nine sherds of Rusticated/Domestic Beaker (Fig. 69) from at least five vessels. Two rimsherds, 483a and 885; No. 483a from vessel with flat-topped rim and slightly flared profile; ware slightly abrasive and about 8mm thick. Nos 507 and 509 average 10mm thick; 507 has rounded, slightly everted profile while 508 is upright and poorly preserved. No. 885: decorated rimsherd with flat inward-sloping top; ware light red to light reddish brown with medium to large calcite and quartzite grits not protruding through smooth dusty surface. Two rows of large D-shaped bone impressions on outer face. Three decorated and four undecorated bodysherds, 886-92, from vessel containing medium to large calcite grits. No. 886: two rows of opposed oblique strokes; 887, which has end of one stroke, from same part of pot. Average thickness 10.5mm. Nos 521-2, 523b, 527, 529, 531, 534 are basesherds.

Nos 631-40: again similar but contain large calcite grits. Nos 809a-l: group of sherds containing numerous fine to medium quartzite grits giving an abrasive texture. Nos 810-22 average 7.5mm thick; single finger-nail impression occurs on 810. Finds from the enclosure wall fill The quantity of small finds from the wall fill was not great and clearly all of this material was derived from the pre-enclosure habitation layer. Twenty-nine pieces offlint and chert (Fig. 70) of which seven are artefacts.

At the southern edge of the platform is a sharp step downwards to a second smaller platform bounded on the eastern side by a second, shorter length of wall joining a knoll of outcrop to the southern cliff edge. On the western side this platform is delimited by the steep slope which drops to the lake shore. In all 17m of the northern and 4m of the eastern wall were excavated (Fig. 62; Pl. XXb). They are well constructed. Each consists of a double facing of large boulders averaging 65cm by 35cm by 30cm in maximum dimensions. The facings are set 1.5m apart but in some places the outer kerb of the northern wall was doubled. Although this may have been part of a rebuilding or remodelling of the wall it is no wider in the areas with a double exterior and this feature is probably part of the original construction. The wall fill consists of small stones with some earth containing occupation debris including charcoal, animal bones, pottery and stone artefacts (see above). As the enclosure was built directly on the earlier habitation layer the fill, and consequently the finds, must be derived from that level. This is emphasised by the occurrence of pottery sherds from vessels present in the pre-enclosure occupation. There is a well defined entrance, 1.5m wide, in the northern wall close to the junction with the eastern rock outcrop. It is straight-sided and formed by a facing of boulders somewhat larger than those in the wall itself. A large conglomerate which lay just outside in line with the central axis of the entrance may be a fallen portal stone or possibly part of an extension of the facing forming a corridor like that at Circle K. A considerable number of stones occurred throughout the habitation layer (see above) and it appears that these were thrown down periodically to provide a clean and more solid living floor. The uppermost of this was laid down after the construction of the enclosure and this gave an even cobbled surface over much of the site, but was particularly regular on the northern side. This marked the final occupation level and a considerable assemblage of material came from amongst the cobbles and the habitation debris which accumulated on it to a maximum depth of 12cm. Finds from the cobbled final enclosure floor (Figs 70-2) Four hundred and thirty-seven pieces of flint and chert (1102-57); fifty-five artefacts or utilised items. Three hundred and seventy-two waste chips, 236 (c. 460g) of chert (all 1157a) and 136 (c. 200g) of flint (all 1157b); the quantity indicates that a considerable amount of manufacture</page><page sequence="159">Grogan and Eogan ?

Nos 1115-20, 1125 and 1127a-b all retain part of cortex while only portions of 1112 and 1114 survive. Two end scrapers, both of very good quality (1128-9), and six pieces with working on one or more edges which were probably used as knives or side scrapers (1130-5). Nos 1136-46: blades; generally parallel-sided; 1136 has retouch on both faces and 1140 is serrated along one edge. Ten points (1147-56) varying from neatly retouched examples like 1147-9 to small irregular pieces such as 1155-6. Nos 1158-60: large fragments of polished stone axe (Fig. 70); eighty-six small chips (all 1162). Five of latter (1162a-e) have slight retouch along one or more edges. No. 1158a: slightly pointed butt of green/grey siltstone. No. 1158b: sharp butt of greenstone, pointed oval cross-section; worn and chipped along both edges and one face. No. 1159: mid portion of siltstone; although damaged may have had a pointed oval section; No. 1160: greenstone from similar axe with polished facet along one edge. Six beads (1163-8), all of stone (Fig. 70). No. 1163: circular, 13mm in diameter, with two pointed lateral projections; slightly domed with hourglass perforation as are 1165-6. Nos 1164-5: circular domed beads 13mm and 23mm in diameter respectively; slightly off-centre perforations, that of 1164 bored from one side only like those of 1167-8. No. 1166: bead or pendant, broken at top, large off-centre perforation. No. 1167: disc-shaped, originally had highly polished smooth surface most of which had broken off leaving it rough. No. 1168: about one-half of disc-shaped bead 9mm in diameter. Nos 1165 and 1168 are mudstone while others are green siltstone. Two joining pieces of a very light lignite, or possibly jet, bracelet (1169-70, Fig. 72) of D-shaped cross-section from cobbles on southern side of site. Very similar piece from near upper terrace wall at Site D (6 Riordain 1954, 410; fig. 43: 13) and a small fragment, perforated at one end and polished at the other for re-use as a pendant, came from Circle L (p. 435). Similarly reworked portion of bracelet came from unassociated level at Monknewtown (Sweetman 1976, 69). Two pieces at Site 10 found 6m apart, indicating some disturbance in this area, and as some later activity took place on the site (see below) it could have been introduced from a higher level. No. 1171: polished, roughly cone-shaped piece of sandstone; square cross-section and one side, or facet, particularly smooth, may indicate wear rather than polishing; base rounded. The single item of copper or bronze, a concave-headed pin, came from the cobbles (1172); part of head and stem missing; small conical projection in centre of head which is 6.5mm in diameter and has distinct lip around edge. Stem 2mm thick. Similar pins, but without the projection, came from Sites C and D (6 Riordain 1954, pp 360-1, fig. 28: 2; p. 411, fig. 43: 5). This is akin to a Later Bronze Age example from Heathery Burn, Durham (Britton 1968). Pottery. Only a small number of sherds of western neolithic pottery come from the final floor; at least five vessels represented by 109 sherds. Six rimsherds (1217-22). Nos 1217-18: rounded out-turned profile; rim folded over crudely before eversion. No. 1219: damaged rimsherd from same vessel; ware smooth and well fired containing small amount of quartzite gritting. Nos 1220-1: similar rims of rounded, slightly everted form; slightly abrasive texture. Although damaged, 1222 appears to be from vessel with out-turned pointed rim. Two shouldersherds (1223-4): simple angle; from same vessel as rims 1220-1; 1225 of medium step type. Group of thirty-six sherds (1226-61): hard, black to brown ware containing very fine quartzite grits; 5mm to 8mm thick; from same vessel as 277-99 from pre-enclosure occupation. Nos 1262-76: very similar ware but with greater grit content and pitted surface; black to red, average thickness of 6mm. Five sherds (1277-81): heavier ware, 9mm thick, while 1282-300 come from at least three vessels not represented above. Good quality with fine quartzite grits, slightly corky appearance. Two decorated vessels (Class la) represented and both clearly derived from pre-enclosure occupation. Nos 1301-7, including one rimsherd, come from same vessel as 363-8 and 1308 is part of same rim as 369. Two hundred and fifty sherds of coarse flat-bottomed pottery (1809-2037). Two groups, 1809-23 and 1824-39, from vessels which occurred in pre-enclosure occupation (893-901, 922-9 respectively) and these vessels are described in that section. At least eight other vessels represented. Nos 1840-52: well-fired Finely gritted ware with cream surface and black core. Nos 1840-T. pointed rimsherds; curved inward bevel. No. 1853: rim from similar pot. Another well-made vessel of [G17]</page><page sequence="162">460 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy pitted dark ware represented by two rimsherds (1854-5) and seven bodysherds (1854-62). Rim has slight inward bevel. Rimsherds 1863-81 and bodysherds 1882-982 from three or more vessels of gritty black to buff or even cream ware with upright profile. Nos 1863-7: flat-topped; even surface containing limestone and quartzite grits. Another vessel with flat to slightly rounded rim represented by 1868-77 while 1878-81 have inward bevel and slight internal cordon immediately underneath. Nos 1983-91: broad flat rims with outward expansion; ware similar to that of 1863-982, black with smooth but crudely finished surface. Twenty-eight bodysherds of the same vessel (1992-2018). There are eighteen sherds and about twenty fragments of very coarse thick walled vessel (2019-37) which has large quantity of sandstone grits. Two hundred and twenty-three sherds of Beaker pottery. Same range of ware and decoration as those in pre-enclosure occupation; some sherds derived from vessels at that level. Fifty-seven decorated sherds including five rims (1309, 1311, 1313, 1315-16). No. 1309: rounded with three broad incised lines on exterior and three closely spaced rows of cord on interior; probably from same vessel as 403-4, as is bodysherd 1310 which has same decorative arrangement. No. 1311: also rounded and upright of dusty cream to red ware with dark core; two horizontal lines of comb decoration with two diagonal thumb-nail impressions above. This and 1312, from near rim, are from same vessel as 375-7. No. 1313: rounded with curved profile. Decoration: four lines of comb, first and third joined by evenly spaced incised vertical lines. No. 1314, from near rim of this vessel, has same ornament; ware similar to that of 1311-12. Nos 1315-16: rims; 1317: bodysherd of pot represented by 447-50. Nos 1318-24: lines of comb decoration with fringe of diagonal impressions; of same fine dusty ware; may be from same vessel as 1311-12. Fifteen other comb-decorated sherds. Nos 1325-39 from vessel of which 1330-2 are undecorated sherds, with band of four lines of well-executed comb; ware corky with red outer surface and dark core and interior. No. 1330 has swelling or slight cordon, which suggests that this vessel may have had profile similar to 1315-17. Five bodysherds (1333-6b): from pot with similar ornament but light reddish yellow containing grog. Remaining five sherds (1337-41): fine comb decoration arranged in horizontal lines. Thirty-four sherds have decoration of horizontal incised lines. Nos 1342-7: from a vessel of fine dusty cream ware with overlapping lines which are deeply scored. Incision on other twenty-eight sherds (1348-75) varies from widely (e.g. 1348) to closely (1349-51) spaced lines while on some examples lines are broad and shallow forming channels (1353). No. 1376: row of diagonally set oval impressions. Only one basesherd (1377) decorated with discontinuous incised lines; body rises vertically from it. No. 1378: undecorated rimsherd from vessel of very fine hard red ware like 390-400; 1379-80 are decorated and 1381 is undecorated bodysherd of same vessel. Thirty-five undecorated rimsherds (1382-416) representing at least thirteen vessels. Nos 1382-96: upright; most round-topped (1383-4, 1388-96) while others are flat. Ware generally fine; some sherds very thin (1382-92, 3mm-4mm) but 1393-6, from a single vessel, are 9mm thick and have abrasive quality produced by high quartzite grit content. Although of fine ware these may belong to a domestic vessel. Three rimsherds (1399-401): everted with angular profile; pitted surface apparently caused by removal of large grits prior to firing. Nos 1402-10: out-turned examples with slightly pointed profile; 1410 has also been folded over. Two poorly preserved rims, 1411-12, are also everted, while 1413-16, of Beaker quality ware, come from small round bottomed pots similar to 6 Riordain's 'small cup" type (1954, 327, fig. 15). Eight undecorated basesherds (1417-24). On 1417-22 body flares out slightly from base but 1423-4 have a more open angle. Nos 1417-19: from vessel also represented by twenty-three undecorated bodysherds (1425-47). Ware light reddish brown with dark core; small quantity of quartzite grits; 6mm thick. Eighty-two bodysherds (1448-529): from same vessel as 1420-1; like 1425-47 of buff to red dusty ware, 6mm thick. On 1423 wall flares out above base which is straight-edged; ware hard and slightly abrasive with pitted surface. There are thirty-two bodysherds (1530-61) from this vessel and rims 1389-90 may also belong to it. Of the remaining 245 bodysherds (1562-806) most are of fine ware ranging in thickness from 4mm to 6mm (1562-631). One group of sherds (1632-51) is considerably thicker (c. 11mm) and although of good quality these are very similar to the Beaker-related vessels on the site, (e.g. 885-92). Most sherds red or buff to brown; gritting of small amounts of crushed quartzite. One group (1784-806), however, of poorly preserved grey to cream ware from vessel or vessels represented by rimsherds</page><page sequence="163">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 461 1403-7. Over one hundred fragmentary or very worn sherds (all 1807) and thirty irregular lumps of daub which seem to be waste from the production of Beaker vessels (1808). Twenty-two sherds of Rusticated /Domestic Beaker (1397-8, 1632-51) representing two vessels. Nos 1397-8: rimsherds. No. 1397: upright rounded profile; 1398 has thin rounded top and slightly concave inner face and swells inwards towards body. No. 1632: decorated bodysherd with two rows of oblique strokes set opposite each other. No. 1633: flat base of same vessel; 1634-51 are undecorated bodysherds. Four Bowl food vessels represented (980-1020c, Fig. 72). Nos 980-4 rimsherds and 985-97 bodysherds from one of hard well-fired ware, 9mm average thickness and with diameter at mouth of about 14cm. Outer surface cream to brown while core and interior are brown to black. Vessel has all-over decoration; flat inward-sloping top of rim has row of X-motifs, each of crossing thumb nail impressions. Beneath rim row of these impressions set obliquely between two broad shallow channels which overlap on 981. Below this a wide band of decoration of lozenges set edge to edge which are outlined by channels and filled with diagonally set oval impressions. Whole band occurs between two horizontal channels. Lower portion of vessel poorly represented but row of elongated impressions between two further channels is set beneath main decorative band. Rim 1016 and seven bodysherds 1017-19b from second vessel. Ware compact, 6mm-7mm thick; black, slightly shiny outer surface; core and inner face brown to buff. Gritting of small amounts of calcite and quartzite. Almost flat-topped rim slopes and expands outwards; slight cordon or swelling beneath. Decoration of elongated stab-marks set in opposing pairs. Single line of diagonal thumb-nail impressions occurs immediately beneath rim on interior. Third food vessel: represented by three sherds (1020a-c); ware similar to 1016-19 but thicker (8mm-11mm) and contains greater quantity of calcite grits. Rim flat-topped and slopes inwards slightly, has row of diagonal, pointed impressions. Immediately beneath rim on outer surface is similar decorative band; rest of face damaged but retains remains of applied cordon. Bodysherds have larger diagonal stab-marks, on 1020b two parallel stabs, while on 1020c they are set opposite each other. Eighteen sherds of fourth vessel (998-1015); flat-topped rim with slight inward slope projects outwards; beneath it two evenly spaced, pinched-up cordons. Decoration, of lightly incised channels, occurs on outer face; ware very friable, has some large limestone grits. Outer surface grey to buff, core and interior brown to black. Average thickness of walls 11mm. Nos 1021-6e: from unusual vessel of hard thin (5.6mm) ware; surface grey and shiny, gritting of finely crushed quartzite. Decoration, of incised diagonal strokes, on flat, inward-sloping rim top. Beneath, on exterior, at least five closely spaced horizontal grooves or channels and below is band of closely spaced lozenges set in rows. Vessel has bowl-shaped profile. Another unusual vessel represented by seven sherds (1028a-g) from upper portion of vessel and shoulder consists of simple change of angle. Broad channel occurs just above shoulder and appears to be thumb imprints left when neck and body were being joined. Ware hard, grey to black containing quartzite grits which protrude the surface giving abrasive texture. No. 1027: sherd of compact smooth ware; grey with incised channels making a zig-zag pattern. Affinities more probably with Beaker rather than food vessel pottery. Animal bones came from throughout the site in and above the cobbled layer but the only material surviving (2040-5, 2047-63, 2078-81, 2083-4, 2087-92) consists of mainly unidentifiable fragments, probably waste from the manufacture of artefacts. Later activity Some fragments of slag and bloom came from a high level outside the enclosure on the north-eastern side. These were examined by Professor O'Kelly who suggested that all this material is the residue of primitive iron smelting and clearly this occurred at a much later stage of activity on the site. Two modern iron horseshoes came from a similar level but it is impossible to suggest any date for the iron-smelting or iron working activity. Remarks There were two phases of activity at Site 10. As at Circles J, K and L, occupation took place before construction of the enclosure wall and there was no evidence for a gap</page><page sequence="164">462 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy between the unprotected and enclosed phases. At least one house (the Possible Structure) appears to have been associated with the first phase, but others may have occurred in the other unexcavated two-thirds of the site. Western neolithic (20 per cent), coarse flat-bottomed (44 per cent) and Beaker (36 per cent) pottery were found at this level and appear to be contemporary. The enclosure wall was built directly on the earlier occupation layer and was planned to take maximum advantage of the naturally level platforms on the site overlooking the lake. No indication of dwellings survived for this phase, but a house or houses may have stood in the unexcavated part of the site. The same range of pottery came from the fill of the wall and the enclosed habitation as had been in use before its construction. The relative percentages were 19 per cent, 40 per cent and 40 per cent respectively (Diagram 1, p. 480). The overall evidence for continuity coupled with the slight fall in the percentages of western neolithic and coarse flat-bottomed ware and a corresponding rise in the amount of Beaker between the pre-enclosure and enclosed phases suggests that there was a gradual replacement of the Neolithic forms, but that the use of Neolithic and Beaker pottery to some extent overlapped. The presence of a small amount of food vessel pottery indicates that occupation continued on into the Early Bronze Age on Site 10 after the other enclosed habitation sites had apparently been abandoned. This suggestion accords well with a generally later date for Site 10, but its utilisation overlapped with that of Circles J, K and L. Site 11 This irregular enclosure of similar construction to Site 12 is on the northern side of Knockadoon (Fig. 1). Although O'Kelly indicated that this site had been excavated (O'Kelly and O'Kelly 1978, 21) no records of the excavation are known. However, there appears to have been some confusion over the numbering of the finds from Site 12 as this was originally designated Site 11. The number of Site 12 was subsequently changed to its present one and this alteration may have given rise to the impression that Site 11 had indeed been excavated. Site 12 (Figs 1, 72-4; Pis 1, XXI) This is a roughly D-shaped enclosure on the western side of Knockadoon east of and above Site G (6 Riordain 1954, 259; OS 6" Limerick sheet 32, 16.0cm from N, 16.2cm from W). No plans or sections of this site survived. Site 12 was excavated in 1954. A steep cliff runs north/south across the western side of the site. On the eastern side of this a curved wall enclosed a D-shaped area (PL XXI). The western portion of the site is level but towards the east it slopes steeply upwards and is irregular and broken by rock outcrops. The excavation was mainly confined to the western side with cuttings extended out through the enclosure wall at the south and east. This consisted of two rough kerbs of fairly small stones set on the natural rock with some loose pebble fill between them. The wall was best preserved on the northern side and although it was recognisable elsewhere it was more irregular owing to the uneven nature of the ground surface. There was no evidence for an entrance. Even on the level western side the natural rock was very close to the surface and the depth of deposit, including humus, averages only 20cm. Where there were natural depressions and crevices the deposit was up to 30cm deep. Although no structural features were found there was evidence for occupation consisting of animal bones, pottery and flints which came from the crevices.</page><page sequence="165">Pl.

Characteristically thick-walled and containing high quantity of large grit, mainly of igneous rock and quartz, which are poorly bonded to the clay. Although it is very difficult to estimate numbers with this ware it appears that at least four vessels are represented at Site 12. Rims all simple and can be flat-topped (45a, 46a) or have an internal bevel (44a). Rim of 48 represented by three sherds (ac), rounded in profile, has been pinched up leaving internal 'shoulder immediately beneath. No. 49a: similar sherd from coarser vessel. Vessels appear to have been either straight-walled or slightly curved, although rimsherd 45a has inward curve which suggests bowl-shaped profile and may come from a 'small cup' (6 Riordain 1954, fig. 15: 6). There were only two basesherds, 48d and 49b, both from flat-based vessels. General discussion The five sites described in this report (Circles J, K, L and Sites 10 and 12), all on the Knockadoon peninsula, are domestic sites, generally Neolithic in date but with a limited and later Beaker component. As they are part of the wider settlement pattern on Knockadoon the present paper must be considered in conjunction with O Riordain's (1954) where nine unprotected sites are described and evaluated. Each site consists of a concentration of occupation material centred on a house. For the Neolithic there are two main types of settlement site, unprotected houses and enclosed habitations. As the name implies the unprotected houses lack external delimiting features. Outside the houses there is evidence for associated activity in the form of patches of paving, fireplaces, pits and post-holes of uncertain function. The enclosed habitation sites consist of a generally circular area, about 25m-30m in internal diameter, delimited by a wall 1.5m thick, which consists of a facing of large stones on the inner and outer sides and a core of stones and earth. There is usually a well defined entrance. A dwelling house was the main internal feature. At each of these five sites the area enclosed was reasonably level. Circles J, K and L each enclosed roughly the same area, about 700m2, and had similar layouts. Although Site 10 appeared on the ground to consist of a series of small terraces cut off from the main area of the peninsula by a slightly curved wall, the most recent aerial photographs (Pl. I) show that it is subrectangular with walls on the northern and western sides. It too consisted of a similar area. Site 12, which is D-shaped, is about 500m2. The walls at each site were constructed in the same manner. Large blocks of limestone were erected orthostatically, or occasionally lengthways, to form two concentric wall-facings. Between the rings was a fill of smaller stones and some earth usually surviving to a height of about 50cm. The facings rested directly on the underlying surface but small propping stones were also employed. Rock outcrops were used as part of the walls at Circle J and Sites 10 and 12. There was no indication that further stones were used above the facing to increase their height. The presence of some earth in the wall core suggested to 6 Riordain (6 Riordain and de Valera 1979, 34) that the stone facings were intended as revetting for a bank of sods or earth. If this hypothesis is correct then the rubble fill must have been a foundation feature on which a bank was constructed or simply the remnant of the earth and stone bank itself. The rough paving forming the top of the fill at Circle J suggests that the foundation theory is correct, and would have provided a firm and level base for a wall of sods. It is improbable that an entrance as elaborate as that at Circle K would have been necessary if the wall had stood only to its present height. Well-defined entrances occurred at Circle K and Site 10. The pairs of post-holes on either side of the Circle K entrance probably supported double gates, while a single</page><page sequence="170">468 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy gate may be indicated at Site 10. At Circle J the single post-hole at the terminus of the incurving south-eastern portion of the wall may represent both the entrance and a gate. Houses There are three basic house forms, rectangular, circular and oval or D-shaped; these types occur on both the unprotected and enclosed sites and are best represented at Sites A, C and D respectively (O Riordain 1954). A fourth category consists of a concentra tion of structural features, evidently the site of a house but lacking a recognisable ground plan. On the enclosed sites the definite houses have been given numbers and the possible ones are designated by letters. There is evidence for possible houses at Circle L and Sites 10 and C. The houses were not isolated features and at the sites where the environs of the house were excavated other evidence for intensive activity came to light. The most complete picture was that at Site C, where a large number of pits, post-holes, fireplaces and areas of paving occurred in association with at least three houses (O Riordain 1954, 321-84; pis XVIII, XXII). At Circle L the area within the enclosure wall also produced a large number of structural features, pits, post-holes and areas of burning representing fireplaces. Houses 1 and 2 at Circle K and the later Central House at Circle L were well defined and had square, rectangular and oval plans respectively. Less conclusive evidence for four other structures occurred at Site 10 (Fig. 62, Possible House) and at Circle L (Fig. 35, Central House, first phase, and Possible Houses A and B). The Circle K structures, and especially No. 2, can be readily paralleled elsewhere on Knockadoon. At Site A and the second phase at B (6 Riordain 1954, 229-321; figs 1, 6) the plans were also indicated by a low wall-footing of stones with post-holes on either side. The post-holes were generally set in opposed pairs and each pair of uprights would have been braced together with cross-ties. If, as postulated by O Riordain (1954, 302), the wall cavities were filled with organic material then this sort of structural detail would have been necessary to retain the fill. This type of box construction is inherently stable and its strength may explain the comparatively shallow nature of the post-holes which, at all three sites, average only 25cm deep. An organic fill retained by the wall-facings supported on the timber uprights would have provided good insulation and explains the need for a stone footing, which functioned as a 'damp-proof course', preventing moisture from lodging in the wall cavity. While details of the house walls at Sites A and B are replicated at House 2, Circle K, they are not confined to rectangular houses. Wall-footings and paired post-holes occurred at Site C where the circular Houses 1 and 2 had a similar arrangement of posts, while at House 1 some wall stones were also present (6 Riordain 1954, pl. XVIII). Part of the wall on the eastern side of Possible House A, Circle L, consisted of concentric arcs of post-holes while two wall trenches, fulfilling the same functions, occurred at the D-shaped House 3 at site D (O Riordain 1954, pl. XLI). A combination of stones and an earthen bank provided the foundation of the wall at House 1, Circle K. Although the formal pairing of posts was not in evidence here, post-holes did occur on either side of the footing. The consistent presence of these features shows them to be characteristic of domestic architecture at Lough Gur. While there are considerable difficulties in establishing the nature of the roofing at any of the houses it is apparent that two basic methods were employed. The similarity of the wall construction already noted at houses on Sites A and C (1 and 2) and Circle K (No. 2) indicates that these structures were roofed in the same manner, notwith standing the fact that some were circular and others rectangular. The uprights of the</page><page sequence="171">Grogan and Eogan ?Lough Gur excavations 469 walls probably supported rafters but wall-plates may have been used to allow the rafters to be positioned at will rather than being restricted to the uprights. The main difference between the circular and rectangular houses was, of course, the location of the internal roof supports. While the round houses had a central post onto which the rafters converged 6 Riordain (1954, 302-4, fig. 2) noted the absence of a medial line of posts at Site A, and this appears to be the case at House 2, Circle K. In the apparent absence of a ridge-pole, collar braces may have been used to link opposing rafters. However, the presence of post-holes set longitudinally inside each wall at Site A suggests that purlins were used and these would allow for sufficient internal support without the need for collar braces. The roof itself was probably pitched at an angle of about 45? and the rafters may have projected beyond the line of the walls. This detail would also counter-balance the internal weight of the roof. The nature of the roofing materials is also one of conjecture, but thatching is the most likely method. Screens of wattle could have been laid over the rafters as a base for the thatch. The number of Neolithic houses elsewhere in Ireland is not great and, although both rectangular and circular examples are known, none is closely comparable to the Lough Gur examples. The best parallels are provided, for the circular structures, at Slieve Breagh, Co. Meath, where two houses were excavated between 1959 and 1961 (unpublished but referred to in Lucas 1960, 6; Herity and Eogan 1977, 49). One of these was defined by a single line of post-holes in the manner of House 3 at Site C (6 Riordain 1954, pl. XXIII). It had a diameter of 5m compared with 5.5m for the Lough Gur example. The other Slieve Breagh house was delimited by two closely set concentric lines of posts and had a diameter of 6m. It is not certain if these represent the wall, as for example at Houses 1 and 2, Site C, and Possible House A at Circle L, or the wall and an inner line of roof supports. The County Meath sites produced an assemblage of western neolithic and coarse flat-bottomed pottery (Herity and Eogan 1977, 49), which suggests a date broadly contemporary with the Lough Gur settlement. Rectangular dwellings occurred at Ballyglass, Co. Mayo (O Nuallain 1972), Ballynagilly, Co. Tyrone (ApSimon 1969), and Knowth, Co. Meath (Eogan 1984, 211-19, fig. 75). At each of these sites the walls were supported in bedding trenches, although individual post-holes were identified at Ballyglass and Knowth. The layout and structural details are, however, quite different from the rectangular houses at Lough Gur. It is interesting to compare the relative sizes of the Irish houses; in general the rectangular ones were larger than the others (Table 1). It is clear that some of the smaller structures, like Sites G and H at Lough Gur, are unlikely to have been used as dwelling places and may have functioned as work-shops. Table 1 ?

The best defined evidence came from Circle K where part of House 1 was sealed beneath the later wall. The assemblage form this phase consisted of western neolithic and coarse flat-bottomed pottery although a few sherds of Beaker were later incorporated into the upper disturbed part of the occupation layer. At Circle L all three types of pottery apparently came from the pre-enclosure phase, although here it is possible that Beaker was incorporated into the earlier layer at a later stage of activity. As many as three houses may have been associated with the earlier phase. Site 10 produced some structural remains and the assemblage was made up, as at Circle L, of all three types of pottery. The position at Circle J was complicated by its much later use as a cemetery but it too produced pre-enclosure occupation. The area enclosed at each of these four sites did not correspond exactly to that previously utilised but, as each site was chosen because it was a comparatively level area, a very strong element of continuity is apparent. The evidence at Circle K and Site 12 indicates that these two were enclosed before the introduction of Beaker pottery onto the settlement and that the concept of enclosure was an aspect of the Neolithic occupation at Lough Gur. Circle J produced a small quantity of Beaker, some of it possibly from the pre-enclosure phase, but it was a minor component of the assemblage and this site also appears to be Neolithic. Although we cannot rule out the chance that the evidence at Circle L and Site 10 was completely mixed because of intensive later occupation, it seems that these enclosed habitation sites were constructed after Beaker had become an element in the cultural assemblage. The duration of the occupation of the five sites is an elusive problem. The best evidence appears to come from Circle K where each of the two phases of activity is associated with a house. In the absence of any indication of a gap between them it is reasonable to suggest that they represent two successive generations of occupation most probably by one family unit. This can be paralleled by the evidence at Site B (6 Riordain 1954, 312-21, fig. 6) where there were two superimposed houses. At Circle L the situation was more complex and three reasonably distinct areas were used for house building. In the case of the Central House and Possible House A, at least two phases of construction were in evidence. There are two possible interpretations of the sequence at this site. The first is that, as at Circle K, only two phases of activity are represented, the earlier one by the initial house in each area and the later by the second structure, while another house, Possible House B, could have belonged to either phase. Secondly, in view of the evidence at Circle K and Site B, it could be argued that each site was used by a single family and that a much longer span of occupation, five generations or more, is indicated at Circle L. A similar case can be put forward for Site C where, as suggested above, at least five houses may have existed. In the context of the overall continuity of settlement evident at Lough Gur it is probable that each focus of habitation was the traditional occupation site of an individual family. This hypothesis is supported by the evidence from the enclosed habitation sites, each of which appears to delimit the 'homestead' of a single family. While the exact function of the enclosing wall is uncertain, there are a number of possible explanations. For instance, as we shall see, Lough Gur had a subsistence strategy dominated by pastoralism. It is probable that, in addition to the exploitation of the surrounding landscape, cattle were brought onto the peninsula itself and the enclosures would have protected the domestic dwellings from the intrusion of grazing animals. Although these sites are on the sunnier southern and western sides of the peninsula, this is the area most exposed to the prevailing wind, and where identifiable the entrances face east, away from the lake; in other words, the enclosures were used to provide shelter for</page><page sequence="173">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 471 the houses. These are practical explanations of their function, but it is clear that the enclosed habitations, although an integral part, were not a universal feature of the settlement. Even among sites delimited by walls there is the evidence at four, J, K, L and 10, for a previous phase of unprotected occupation. There is no suggestion that any less monumental barriers, such as timber fences, were erected at any of the other sites. While the enclosed sites might represent one phase in the continuum of settle ment on Knockadoon, all the evidence indicates that unprotected houses and enclosed habitations were contemporary features and the latter do not represent a general progression in the elaboration of the settlement sites. It is probable, therefore, that the enclosed sites indicate an element of stratification in the community, with some wealthier or higher-ranking families or individuals defining their dwellings as a symbol of status or wealth. This suggestion is given some additional support by the apparently greater quantity of personal adornments found on these sites (Table 3) although there was no difference in the size or nature of the houses associated with the- enclosed habitations. Since both types of habitation site were contemporary and all but one of the enclosures had been occupied before the construction of the wall, it is unlikely that the more elaborate sites were a feature of the earlier part of the Lough Gur settlement. Furthermore, as there is evidence for the construction of two of these sites after the introduction of Beaker pottery, it appears that the enclosure of habitations was an aspect of the Later Neolithic on Knockadoon. Burials Ten inhumation burials, contemporary with the enclosed habitation sites, came from Circles K and L. Nine of these, consisting of the remains of at least fourteen individuals, came from Circle K. At Sites C and D 6 Riordain (1954, 371-2, 386-8) discovered three burials associated with the occupation levels. Of the Lough Gur interments four were crouched and four were extended; it was not possible to determine the original position of the remaining eight. Only three of the burials had grave-goods. At Site C the crouched skeleton of a fourteen-year-old youth was accompanied by a decorated western neolithic vessel. A necklace consisting of a stone pendant and six bone beads was found with burial 1 (a two-year-old child) at Circle K; and burial 6, the extended remains of an infant at the same site, was accompanied by a necklace of twelve stone beads. While the pendants and beads associated with the Circle K burials occurred in these instances in a ritual context, exact counterparts were forthcoming as isolated finds or as groups amongst the domestic assemblages on several sites, such as Circle L and Sites D and 10. The two crouched burials at Site D were associated with the occupation of one, or possibly both, of the houses and at House 1, Circle K, burials both pre- and post-dated the structure. Two burials also came from the floor of House 2, and although there was no stratigraphical evidence to indicate their relationship to the house, the relatively undamaged nature of the skeletons suggests that they may have post-dated the use of the structure as a dwelling. Of the eighteen individuals represented in the burials only two ?one of the three in burial 2 at Circle K and the single burial at Circle L ?were adults. Two others ?one of those in burial 4a, Circle K, and that at Site C ?were adolescents, and fourteen were children under the age of six. Although the evidence is incomplete, it appears that adults were not usually buried on the habitations. Certainly the occurrence of two children, one a newborn infant, with the young adult female at Circle K is unusual. Although individual interments did take place, four of the burials contained more than one individual. This may be a reflection of the more common Neolithic rite of communal burial. The overall impression is that these burials were an integral part of the settlement and that the rite of inhumation, whether crouched or extended, was an important aspect of the Neolithic burial custom at Lough Gur.</page><page sequence="174">472 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Table 2 ?Comparative percentages of artefact types (flint and chert) from the enclosed habitation sites. ~" J K L 10 12 ARTIFACT% 55 43 72 18 28 % arrowheads 16.7 13.2 8.7 22.4 23.4 round scrapers 167 299 260 36'4 9'5 endsc%rapers 69 4? 87 70 4'8 all scrapers 24-5 339 34-7 434 14'3 knles 12'7 150 10-1 96 19'? blades 23-5 27'7 246 12?

On a wider front, single burials are a feature of the Linkardstown Type Burials although with these a formal protection, such as a cist, is a major characteristic. The burials at Lough Gur and those of the Linkardstown Type, however, contrast with the interments in the megalithic tombs (long barrow and passage tomb) where the burial rite was predominantly cremation and communal burial was the norm. Material assemblage A very large body of material, consisting of over 10,500 finds, came from the five sites. This material can be paralleled amongst that already published by O Riordain (1947; 1951; 1954) but a short summary of the assemblages is appropriate to establish their local and wider context. Unless otherwise stated the material dealt with is from the sites dealt with in this report.</page><page sequence="175">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 473 Flint and chert. All the flint was from glacially derived pebbles. This was of reasonable quality but it was a limited resource and most of the objects were relatively small. The supply was augmented by the use of chert which was available locally and represents about 40 per cent of the artefacts and utilised pieces. Quartz crystal, also found in the vicinity, was occasionally used for small implements, usually blades, although 6 Ribrdain's (1954, 308) reference to these as 'microliths' is misleading, as they clearly belong to the Neolithic/Beaker activity. Both flint and chert were worked at all five sites but the amount found varied considerably, from only ninety-six pieces (including waste and scrap) at Circle L to over 750 at Site 10. It should be noted that Site 10 was the last site to be excavated, in 1954, and while it produced far more lithic material than the other sites (53 per cent of the total) 6nly 18 per cent of this was worked compared with 28 per cent (Site 12), 43 per cent (Circle K), 50 per cent (Circle J) and 72 per cent (Circle L) at the others (Table 2). The standard of workmanship in both flint and chert was consistently high and finely retouched artefacts came from all the sites. Only three definite flint cores, two from Site 10 and one from Circle K, were recovered, but this indicates the scarcity of the material rather than the initial preparation of implements elsewhere on the settlement. In all cases scrapers were the most common type, but blades and arrowheads were also represented (Table 2). Another point of interest is the relative increase in blades and a corresponding decrease in arrowheads at Circle K and Site 10, where the lithic assemblages could be divided into two phases. At these sites the percentage of scrapers (round and end) fell, while that of knives increased. There was no general preference shown in the choice of material (flint or chert) except in the case of blades, 90 per cent of which were made of flint. Although the majority of the artefacts were of Neolithic derivation, a few types have Beaker affinities. The barbed and tanged arrowheads, found at Sites C, D, 10 and Circle K, are the most diagnostic of these, but the small 'thumb scrapers' from, for example, Circle L (Fig. 56: 1798-807), may be of similar derivation, although these also come from Neolithic sites like Knowth (Eogan 1984, table B). In view of the considerable amount of Beaker pottery at Sites D and 10 it is somewhat surprising that so few related artefacts were present. Axes. Over thirty complete or reasonably intact stone axes came from the enclosed habitation sites (Table 3) and there were more than 180 large fragments and smaller chips or flakes. The most common type of axe (cf. Pl. XV) has straight sides usually faceted. The blade is gently curved and the butt thin and slightly pointed. There is a marked junction between the blade and sides, the profile is symmetric and the section a pointed oval. A small number of axe chips were reworked as scrapers or knives, possibly an attempt to augment the flint/chert resource. The majority of the axes were of green or grey-green siltstone, mudstone or sandstone (all generally referred to in the text as greenstone) but granite was also used and a considerable quantity of the pieces from Circle J were of Dacitic lava (Appendix A). Most of these rock forms could have been available in the immediate vicinity of Lough Gur in the glacial drift, but the original source areas for some of the materials were probably in the Limerick volcanics, to the east of Lough Gur, and the upper carboniferous area to the west (for a more thorough analysis see Appendix A). The belief that the raw material was glacially derived is supported by the fact that the axes were all made from pebbles which were ground and polished into shape, but which generally retained some of the irregularities of their original form. There is, however, evidence for long-distance contact, possibly trade, with the north-east of Ireland in the presence, at Site D (6 Riordain 1954, 404; Jope 1952, 53, Nos 54A, B), of two axe fragments of porcellanite from Tievebulliagh/</page><page sequence="176">474 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Table 3 ?Comparison of the area excavated and the range and quantity of material from the excavations on Knockadoon. area exc. pottery axes : .

Antrim. Some of the raw material for the manufacture of beads also came from outside the area (see below) and it is possible that stone for at least some of the other axes was also traded for. While there was no direct evidence it seems probable that axes were manufactured on the settlement and O Riordain (1954, 449) suggested that some of the rubbing stones were used in the grinding stage. Personal adornment. The large number of beads in particular is a feature of the settlement (Table 3: 232 beads and pendants came from Knockadoon, 160 of stone and seventy-two of bone) and 141 of them are from the enclosed habitation sites. This represents 61 per cent of the total. Most of the stone examples were made of siltstone (about 75 per cent) but a significant number were of'serpentine' (calc-silicate) which is not available in the area and may have been brought in from Connemara (6 Riordain 1954, 349; Appendix A). The occurrence of necklaces as grave-goods at Circle K shows that the beads and pendants were worn as personal ornaments. Apart from the material from which they were manufactured two main groups are evident among the stone beads. The first of these consists of a simple flat type with a circular, oval or sub rectangular outline and a generally central hourglass boring. These are similar to</page><page sequence="177">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 475 examples from Lyles Hill, Co. Antrim (Evans 1953, fig. 24: 74-5), and Knowth (Eogan 1984, fig. 83). They also occur in court tombs, for example Creevykeel, Co. Sligo (Hencken 1939, fig. 5: 118). At all of these sites the beads were associated with western neolithic pottery which is similar to much of the material at Lough Gur (see below). The second group have a notched or indented outline. Examples of this form come from Sites C, D, I and 10 and from Circles J, K and L. The indentations vary in their elaboration; in some cases there is no more than a slight irregularity in the outline, while in others a marked notching is evident. The most clearly defined examples occur at Site C (6 Riordain 1954, fig. 23: 10) and Circle L, which has several with an exaggerated outline. The shape of the more elaborate beads is probably anthropomor phic and it may be inferred that the less well-defined pieces were similarly inspired. Two beads from Circle K (E 252: 2858-9, Fig. 19) can be paralleled among the material from both court tombs as at Bavan, Co. Donegal (Flanagan and Flanagan 1966, fig. 11: AC), and portal tombs like Ballyrenan, Co. Tyrone (Davies 1937, fig. on p. 97: BM 1-2). There are also two types of bone bead from Lough Gur, simple and notched or segmented. These too were found in both burial and domestic contexts and were worn as personal ornaments. The segmented beads were shaped and polished as finished items and are readily distinguishable from the more angular roughouts from which some of the simple type were manufactured (cf. Fig. 67: 105-12, 117-18). The more elaborate types have between two and five segments and appear to be the bone equivalent of the notched stone beads. In Ireland there are no good parallels for these particular forms of ornament, although two serpentine beads or pendants from Lyles Hill have a notched outline (Evans 1953, fig. 24: 72-3) and elaborate beads and pendants of both stone and bone do occur in passage tombs (Herity 1974, figs 143, 146). In dealing with the possible origins of the Lough Gur items O Riordain pointed out the similarity of the stone beads to the Flachidole from passage tomb contexts in Iberia (1956). He also noted a resemblance between the elaborate bone beads and segmented types from the same area. While other parallels between Ireland and Iberia have more recently been cited by one of the present writers (Eogan 1981) there is as yet insufficient evidence to establish any connection between Lough Gur and the Iberian peninsula, although this remains an intriguing possibility. Bone. The quantity of other bone artefacts from the enclosed habitations was small compared to that from the unprotected houses, but they were of the same general range. Points were the most common type. Their relative abundance and simplicity of manufacture indicate that they were tools. They are readily distinguishable from the bone pins, which were more carefully finished by polishing. Bone points of the Lough Gur type are a reasonably common feature of the Neolithic and are known at sites like Fourknocks 1 (Hartnett 1957, fig. 8: 1: 70-1), while similar pieces have come from the Beaker levels at Newgrange (O'Kelly et al. 1983, 48-52). Antler pins, of a plain or more elaborate mushroom-headed form, are characteristic of passage tombs in Ireland but the basic bone type is also found on other Neolithic sites (Herity 1974, 132-4). Pottery. Pottery was by far the most important component of the material assemblage at Lough Gur; a total of over 29,700 sherds came from all the excavated sites on Knockadoon; of these 8700 came from the enclosed habitation sites (Table 3). Four main types are represented, plain and decorated western neolithic pottery (O Ribrdain's Class I and la), coarse flat-bottomed ware (Class II), Beaker (both fine and domestic) TG181</page><page sequence="178">476 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy and Food Vessel. Each type is dealt with individually and their context and affinities are then assessed. The most common form of plain western neolithic pottery on the enclosed habita tions is the classic round-bottomed shouldered type with an everted rim. The rims are predominantly of the simple rounded, bulbous or beaded form (Case 1961, fig. 1), although more elaborate varieties such as broad or flat-topped rims also occur (see Figs 41-2). The neck can be upright or, more usually, slightly concave in profile and the shoulders are of the simple angle or, less frequently, of the small to medium step type (Case 1961, fig. 11). The ware is generally fine to medium in quality, 5mm-7mm thick with inclusions of fine particles of quartzite or calcite. The vessels were carefully finished and both surfaces are usually smooth; a small number of vessels were burnished. While there is a considerable homogeneity in this pottery throughout the settlement and all of the vessels from the enclosed sites can readily be paralleled among the others, the unprotected houses produced a higher percentage of larger, more developed rims and more markedly stepped shoulders (Case 1961, 180-5, figs 7, 9-11: Limerick Style). The range of forms on the enclosed sites is similar to that at sites like Lyles Hill, Co. Antrim (Evans 1953), and Ballyglass, Co. Mayo (6 Nuallain 1972), but the 'open' profiles from Lyles Hill are absent at Lough Gur. The more elaborate rim forms from Knowth, Co. Meath (Eogan 1984, 210-44), are closer to the broader and T-shaped Lough Gur examples and T-shaped rims are also a feature of the Lyles Hill assemblage. The exaggerated club rims from Sites C and D (6 Riordain 1954, figs 11, 12, 32) do not, however, occur at Knowth or Lyles Hill, nor are they a feature of the assemblages from the enclosed habitations. Indeed the broad rims and stepped shoulders do not, in the light of the evidence from these sites, appear to be typical of the entire Lough Gur settlement. The decorated western neolithic pottery is of three basic types: those of the same form as the plain ware which have simple decoration confined generally to the rims (e.g. Site 10, Fig. 68: 364a), vessels with more elaborate rims and shoulders, both of which are usually ornamented (6 Riordain's Class la), and a third type with extensive finely executed decoration which is represented by only one vessel (No. 5, Fig. 40) from Circle L. While a sequence of internal development may be indicated by the presence of an intermediate type between the plain vessels and the more elaborate Class la form, there is no other evidence to support such a framework. There is a limited range of decorative motifs and with few exceptions, e.g. cord ornament at Site C (O Riordain 1954, fig. 14), these were incised or impressed. The ware of the Class la vessels is coarser and more heavily gritted than the plain pottery, but a fine slip was occasionally applied to the outer surface as on Vessel 4, Circle K (Fig. 40). The la variety is a characteristic feature of the assemblages at Sites B, C and D (O Riordain 1954, figs. 8, 9, 13, 14, 33). It represents a local form of decorated Irish Neolithic pottery and has affinities with other types such as Case's Sandhills Western (1961, 209). It is not, however, common on the other sites, including the enclosed habitations, at Lough Gur. The affinities of the exotic Circle L pot have already been discussed (pp 403-4) and it is sufficient here to repeat that its closest analogies are with the Linkardstown Type vessels. The comparisons made in the past between that group and the more common Lough Gur form (Class la), as in the Site C burial, have recently been convincingly called into question (Brindley et al. 1983, 2) and the Circle L vessel is best viewed as an exotic, and perhaps 'imported1, item. Coarse flat-bottomed ware (Class II) is the single most common type of pottery on the settlement. It is present at all the enclosed habitations. There is a general</page><page sequence="179">Grogan and Eogan ?

Pottery (X V2).</page><page sequence="180">478 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy consistency in the form of the vessels from Lough Gur. Although, as the name implies, the ware is coarse with a high density of fine to large grits of quartzite, volcanic ash and, less frequently, calcite, there are a number of vessels where the fabric is hard and of medium quality. 'The usual form was a comparatively high, flat-based pot, the sides of which might be almost straight or showing varying degrees of curvature' (O Riordain 1954, 333). The rims are generally flat-topped or slightly rounded but more elaborate forms, such as concave internal bevels, also occur. The height of the vessels was 25cm-30cm and the diameter at the mouth was normally the same as the height. Most vessels narrowed towards the base. No evidence for round-based pots came from the enclosed sites, although O Riordain (1954, 333) noted some possible examples at Site C. In most cases the base formed a simple angle with the side, but foot-rings also occur. The walls are 9mm-16mm thick. Only a small percentage was decorated and this generally consisted of poorly executed lattice motifs incised into the upper part of the vessel, although cord ornament was occasionally applied. The dating of coarse flat-bottomed pottery to the Neolithic has, with some justifica tion, been treated with scepticism on a number of occasions (e.g. Case 1961, 206-8) and one of the most important aspects of the evaluation of the pottery evidence from the five sites in this report was the re-examination of the position of this type at Lough Gur. All the evidence points to confirmation of O Riordain's assessment, namely that this form of pottery is a component of the Neolithic assemblage on the settlement. At all the sites it is present at the earliest levels and there was no indication of 'a phase when Class I or la was exclusively in use' (6 Riordain 1954, 450). The question of why Lough Gur should have another form of domestic Neolithic ware, in addition to the round-bottomed shouldered bowl, has not been resolved, nor has it been possible to explain the apparent association of similar coarse pottery with Later Bronze Age activity at sites like D and F (6 Riordain 1954, 400-3, 415-23). The Neolithic date of this pottery is attested at other sites in the area. Coarse flat-bottomed ware came from beneath the bank at the Grange Stone Circle where it was associated with western neolithic pottery (6 Riordain 1951, 64-7). Although apparently similar pottery has been found in a number of court tombs such as Ballybriest (Evans 1939) and Tamnyrankin (Herring 1941), both in County Derry, the context of this material is not totally secure. More pertinent is the pottery from other habitations like Lyles Hill (Evans 1953), Knowth (Eogan 1984) and Slieve Breagh (Herity and Eogan 1977, 49). At Lyles Hill the coarse ware was not apparently a component of the earliest assemblage. The vessels at Knowth are quite different from the Lough Gur type and display clear affinities with the associated western neolithic pottery. More recently pottery comparable to the Knockadoon ware has been radiocarbon-dated to the second half of the third millennium b.c, at a habitation site in County Meath (Fourknocks 4, pers. comm. Heather King). Although the phenomenon is not yet fully understood it appears that coarse flat-bottomed ware was a component of the Neolithic assemblage in some parts of Ireland, at least during the latter part of the period. Beaker pottery is an important aspect of the assemblages at three of the sites, Circles K and L and Site 10. Although present at Circle J it occurred in only small amounts and it was totally absent from Site 12. Two forms of Beaker are represented, 'fine' ware and a 'Domestic' (and Rusticated) variety. All the fine ware vessels appear to be Bell Beakers with the characteristic gentle S-shaped profile. The ware contains very fine to medium quartzite or occasionally sandstone grits and grog. The surface is smooth, and burnishing was infrequently used to finish the pots (e.g. Vessel 29, Circle L). A large percentage of the vessels was decorated and it appears that in most cases ornament was not confined to any particular part of the vessel. The most common type of</page><page sequence="181">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 479 decoration is incision, but comb-impressed ornament is also a feature. Both types are normally arranged in horizontal lines which can also occur in bands with blank zones between them. Fringes of finger-nail impressions were used in combination with lines, and especially bands, of comb. Bands of finger-nail impressions set in horizontal rows or zig-zag patterns bordered by lines of comb occurred at Circles K and L and Site 10. Other forms of decoration include cord-impressed lines, oblique or diagonal strokes set in opposed lines, low cordons set in the curve of the neck just below the rim and rows of closely set dots or triangular impressions. The two latter forms occurred only at Circle L (Fig. 48) among the enclosed sites, but can be compared with a small number of sherds from Site C (6 Riordain 1954, fig. 30: 3) and the Grange Stone Circle, although the Grange material was not identified as Beaker but 'related to Neolithic wares' (6 Riordain 1951, 63, fig. 9: 15-20). The other, more usual, motifs can be paralleled on Sites C and D (6 Riordain 1954, 377-9, 394-9, figs 35-7, pis 36-7). Other Beaker habitation sites in Ireland such as Knowth (Eogan 1984, 245-322), Newgrange (O'Kelly et al. 1983) and Monknewtown, Co. Meath (Sweetman 1976), produced similar material. The Domestic' component of the Beaker assemblage on the enclosed habitations is represented by larger vessels with thicker walls and less frequent decoration. The fabric of this pottery is identical to that of the fine Beaker, but the vessels appear to have a more elongated S-shaped profile and they are generally less well made and finished. However, a small amount of exceptional pottery which had a thin slip on the outer face came from Circle L (Vessel 34 and sherds E253: 2170-1, 2173-7b, Fig. 53). Most of the Domestic pots were decorated but this was generally of poor quality consisting in the main of paired finger-nail impressions set haphazardly on the upper part of the vessel. Pots with this type of ornament, or with bone or stick impressions, are referred to as 'Rusticated'. Other decorative 'motifs' are rare, but oblique or diagonal strokes, low cordons and incised horizontal lines also occur. Although Domestic Beaker was not identified as such by O Riordain he did draw attention to what is clearly this form of pottery at Sites C and D (1954, 378, 399-400, figs 30, 38) and noted the occurrence of similar material from Cahirguiilamore (Hunt 1967, fig. 2) and Rockbarton, Co. Limerick (Mitchell and 6 Riordain 1942). Both Rusticated and Domestic Beaker are now known from a number of sites in Ireland and especially in the Boyne Valley at Knowth (Eogan 1984, 245-322), Monknewtown (Sweetman 1976) and Newgrange (O'Kelly et al. 1983). Sequence and stratigraphy Understanding the sequence of activity at Lough Gur is complicated by two main factors. The most important of these is the shallow stratigraphy over most of Knockadoon. This made it extremely difficult to distinguish structural evidence at any but the earliest levels. Although many of the sites were clearly occupied over a prolonged period and houses must have been associated with the later phases, evidence for these was forthcoming only at Circles K and L. Furthermore, the continued use of the sites resulted in the disturbance of earlier material by subsequent activity. Another problem is the absence of any comparative stratigraphy between the individual excavations, which necessitated an examination of each site before a reasonably complete picture for the entire settlement could be proposed. The amount of pottery and the depth of stratigraphy were greater at Site C than at any of the other sites published by 6 Riordain in 1954. For this reason his suggested pottery sequence and therefore his implied chronology for the whole of Lough Gur were largely based on the evidence from that site (1954, 449-56, fig. 55). As at all the other sites the evidence was complicated by the continuous activity represented. In addition</page><page sequence="182">480 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy the relevant depth of deposit, i.e. beneath the sealing layer (1954, 322), averaged less than 35cm in the 1949 area of the excavation and, although it did reach 70cm over very limited parts of the 1940 area, it averaged less than 25cm there. At Site C (1940) 'Class II was found at the lowest level' and Class I 'at the surface' (1954, 342). Even allowing for the possibility that some coarse flat-bottomed pottery (Class II) could have been deposited in later pits dug from higher levels than that at which it was found, it is still clear that western neolithic (Class I) and the flat-bottomed pottery were contemporary at the earliest level (6 Riordain 1954, 451). The only possible indication for a phase predating the coarse flat-bottomed ware at Lough Gur came from the northernmost portion of the 1949 area at Site C where a layer of yellow clay sealed the earliest habitation material. This consisted exclusively of plain western neolithic pottery. However, even in this portion the clay layer was not continuous and there was 70T I-pre-enclosure-1 aaI rsmal1 sample-1 ^H ____ wn dwn * B wn dwn I B wn dwn I B wn dwn ?

Lough Gur excavations 481 very little evidence for occupation in the vicinity. As coarse flat-bottomed ware came from the old ground level throughout the rest of Site C it appears that its absence in this small area may have been due to a localised fluctuation in the stratigraphy and not to the occurrence of the exclusively western neolithic phase. The indication that the coarse pottery was an element of the Neolithic assemblage is supported by the evidence from the enclosed habitation sites. At Circle K the earliest occupation, associated with the pre-enclosure house (No. 1), produced western neolithic and flat-bottomed ware. This situation is repeated at the other four sites and it is significant that the percentages of coarse flat-bottomed ware and western neolithic pottery fall between the pre-enclosure and enclosure phases at Circles J, K and L and Site 10 (Diagram 1). The most well-defined sequence on Knockadoon occurs at Circle K and here the earliest phase is a 'pure' Neolithic one, i.e. the pottery consisted of western neolithic and coarse flat-bottomed wares. The construction of the enclosure and the central house (No. 2) also appear to be Neolithic although a small amount of Beaker was found in the house. The bulk of the Beaker material (including 78 per cent of this pottery from the site) was associated with a third phase when activity seems to have been concentrated on the north-eastern side of the enclosure both inside and outside the wall. Nevertheless, there appears to have been an overlap in the use of the neolithic and Beaker pottery at this site and this continuity is even more evident at Circle L and Site 10 where both types were present together both before and after the construction of the enclosure. This situation is repeated, in a less clear-cut manner, at Site D and 6 Riordain, in assessing the evidence from the unprotected house sites, indicated an overlap between the Neolithic and Beaker traditions at Lough Gur and stated 'the Beaker folk must have formed a significant ethnic element in the population ... an element which readily coalesced with the local population (1954, 452). While terms such as 'ethnic elements' would now appear to be unsuitable, 6 Riordains suggestions are, in their broad sense, of importance in the wider context of the Lough Gur settlement. All but one of the houses on Knockadoon were Neolithic in date. Beaker pottery has been found at each of the sites, but it is usually a minor component of the assemblages associated with the structures. At Site C Beaker amounted to only one per cent on the southern (1940) part of the excavation and less than 7 per cent on the northern (1949) part. A large proportion of the pottery at Site D was Beaker but 'the wooden houses (II and III) were associated with the occurrence of the almost pure Class I (and la) pottery from near old ground level' (6 Riordain 1954, 390). At Circle L, however, the later phase of the Central House produced a predominantly Beaker assemblage and appears to be the only clearly 'Beaker' dwelling as yet excavated on the peninsula. Appropriately it is the most difficult to parallel amongst the domestic structures at Lough Gur. The large blocks of stone forming the wall foundation may be analogous to the slighter features at the other sites and the oval plan that occurs at Site D (House II). At Site E large blocks of stone were apparently used in combination with a small number of posts but the evidence for activity there was meagre and its function is uncertain (6 Riordain 1954, 413-15, fig. 44). Sites G and H (O Riordain 1954, 426-35, figs 48-9), which were similar to E, were clearly not domestic and only a few sherds of Beaker were found, at Site H. The scarcity of evidence for formal domestic structures associated with Beaker pottery is not confined to Lough Gur and despite the large assemblages from Knowth and Newgrange, for example, there was only meagre evidence for 'impermanent structures' (Eogan 1984, 314) although a larger rectangular house and dwellings may have existed at Newgrange (O'Kelly et al. 1983, 23-6, fig. 8). The evidence at Circle L, however, suggests that other houses may have existed elsewhere on Knockadoon. In the absence of clear delimiting features, such</page><page sequence="184">482 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy as the large wall stones of the Circle L structure, these would be difficult to identify if constructed on earlier occupation debris. This would also be the case with less substantial houses or shelters such as that on the eastern side of Lough Gur (Cleary 1982, 3-7). A general sequence on the settlement is apparent even if some of the details remain obscure. There is clearly a 'pure' Neolithic horizon with an assemblage that includes not only western neolithic components, such as the round-bottomed shouldered vessels and leaf-shaped arrowheads, but also an 'ordinary domestic ware' (O Riordain 1954, 451). The simple form of some of the western neolithic pottery indicates that part of the occupation need not be late (Case 1966, 2202) and parallels, such as Vessels 6-16 from Circle L, with the material from sites like Lyles Hill are not inappropriate. The presence of the coarse flat-bottomed ware at an early stage in the settlement indicates, however, that the sequence probably began at a developed stage of the Neolithic. In this regard it is important to underline the fact that no megalithic tombs of either court or passage tomb type, which are a feature of the Neolithic in the northern half of Ireland, occur in the area around Lough Gur. This emphasises that the settlement here does not fulfil all the major criteria for the mainstream Neolithic in Ireland, although this in itself need not preclude an early date. The position of the decorated western neolithic pottery (Class la) in the cultural succession has not been completely solved but it appears to represent a local development related to the wider family of decorated Neolithic wares in Ireland (Case 1961, 186-96; Herity 1982). The recent review of the dating of the Linkardstown Type Burials shows that some of these forms were emerging by about 2800 b.c. (Brindley et al. 1983) but the relevance of this for the Knockadoon settlement is restricted to the single related vessel (No. 5) from Circle L. The overall impression is that the more common type (la) on the occupation sites was a later feature ultimately deriving from that earlier development. It is significant that the largest quantity of decorated vessels came, amongst the enclosed habitations, from those with some evidence for continuity into a time when Beaker formed a component of the cultural assemblage. The position of Beaker pottery on the occupation sites is not yet entirely clear but the evidence suggests that some overlap with Neolithic is irrefutable. This is indicated in general by the occupation of the same areas on Knockadoon during both periods and the frequent, and apparently genuine, association of the main pottery types. Apart from the pottery the 'Beaker' component on the occupation sites seems to be restricted to a few new types of flint artefact and possibly some simple copper tools. However, there is an indication of some alteration on the settlement in the scarcity of 'Beaker' houses, which is in marked contrast to evidence from the Neolithic levels. On the wider front the intrusive elements are more apparent and monuments like the embanked stone circle at Grange (O Riordain 1951) indicate that the 'Beaker1 contribution was more fundamental than is suggested on the settlement. A wide range of ritual sites in the Lough Gur area could have a Beaker background. Circle O (Appendix B) is a large ritual enclosure of similar size and construction to Grange. The free-standing stone circles at C, D and T on the fringes of the lake are more obscure in their affinities but are generally dated to the Early Bronze Age (6 Nuallain 1984) as are the standing stones, which tend to ring the area on the higher ground to the north and east (Fig. 75; 6 Nuallain 1975, 102). Certainly the monoliths at Punchestown and Longstone Rath in County Kildare and their associated cists belong to that period (Leask 1937; Macalister et al. 1913) as do the stones from Drumnahare and Carrownacaw, Co. Down (Collins 1957). The wedge tomb on the southern shore of Lough Gur (O Riordain and O hlceadha 1955) produced Beaker, coarse flat-bottomed</page><page sequence="185">?

Other tombs, further to the west, may be of the same type (O Riordain 1954, 458; see Fig. 75). The assemblage at Grange contained the same range of material. Its affinities are with the embanked enclosures which are concentrated in the County Meath area but the presence of some Food Vessel pottery suggests a slightly later date for Grange. Although only one of these sites, at Monknewtown, has been excavated (Sweetman 1976), their background is the more intensively investigated British henges (Burl 1969), which were constructed from the end of the Neolithic into the Early Bronze Age, and during the latter period they have a strong Beaker element. The inner stone facing of Grange is not generally found in the east of Ireland, although an internally revetted bank occurs at Castleruddery, Co. Wicklow, and this appears to be a local development as is the elaborate entrance passage. These are not isolated features and the enclosed habitation sites provide a local origin for the facing, and the entrance at Circle K is a less monumental parallel for the Grange passage. While the embanked stone circle had only an inner facing as a revetment for the bank, Circle O (Appendix B) is more closely comparable to the habitation enclosures with its outer and inner walls. A ditch, like that at Circle O, occurs at Dun Ruadh, Co. Tyrone (Davies 1936; Evans 1966, 201). The overall impression is of contact with the Beaker sites in the eastern part of Ireland and the addition of local elements which have a Neolithic background. The wedge tombs, which are predominantly a western phenomenon, may indicate other areas of contact. Here we can return to 6 Riordain's suggestion of an 'ethnic element' and a ready coalescence. The picture on Knockadoon is one of continuity in the location of settlement and in the style of domestic enclosure, indicating a considerable degree of population stability. It is also probable that there was a continuation of some components of the Neolithic material culture, the flints and pottery in particular. Nevertheless there is evidence for fundamental changes too: the virtual absence of formal dwellings contrasts with the previous situation on Knockadoon; new material in the form of pottery (and techniques of pottery manufacture), flint types and possibly incipient metallurgy were also introduced. In the wider Lough Gur area new elements, related to the introduction of Beaker pottery and other material, were associated with broad changes in ritual architecture and, no doubt, in the rituals themselves. While these were being constructed in a manner which combined local and intrusive elements, we must qualify the local contribution by recognising two vital factors. Firstly, the labour input into monuments such as Grange and Circle O was considerably greater than that required for the building of the enclosed habitations, and secondly this required, for the first time in the area, an organised communal effort which itself indicates an important, if not basic, alteration in social organisation. In summary the Beaker element at Lough Gur was not just the acquisition of Beaker traits by Neolithic people: there was a more substantial alteration in material culture and in ritual and social behaviour; in other words it was a new archaeological phase. Economy and environment Lough Gur is a small lake set in a group of limestone hills. The surrounding landscape is dominated by low-lying heavy soils and this contrasts with the immediate vicinity of the lake which has a 'mature limestone landscape' where the soils are thinner and well drained. The limestone bedrock outcrops irregularly, particularly on the Knockadoon peninsula, and 'the weathering of the limestone has given rise to rugged hillocks and small valleys and to the more marked north-south valley which crosses Knockadoon' (6 Riordain 1954, 447). There is a considerable variety in the types of modern soils present in the area (Fig. 76; Finch and Ryan 1966). While this evidence should be applied with caution</page><page sequence="187">Grogan and Eogan ?

Distribution of soils and site catchment area around Lough Gur. to the prehistoric situation it is, nevertheless, a reasonable indication of the range of soil resources available to the contemporary inhabitants. An area 5km in radius with the Knockadoon settlement at the centre is shown, with the distribution of the modern soils, on Fig. 76. This indicates all the land which could, theoretically, be reached from the settlement in one hour's walk, i.e. the extent of the probable area of intensive exploitation by prehistoric farmers. The greatest range of soil types occurs in the immediate vicinity of the lake. The Knockadoon peninsula and the area immediately around the lake are dominated by light fertile soils (brown earths and brown or grey brown podzolics) with only small patches of low-lying land covered with peats. This forms a contrast with landscape further away from Lough Gur which has a greater component of poorer soils (gieys) which, because of the topography, are less well drained (Figs 75-76). Although the suitability of the land for agriculture must have been of fundamental importance in the choice of settlement location in the Neolithic, the nature of the soil was unlikely to have been the only criterion used. Undoubtedly the topography of the area would also have been a vital factor as would the availability of a reliable water</page><page sequence="188">486 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy supply. The Lough Gur area appears to combine all the desirable elements for Neolithic settlement. The area around the lake has a diversity of land potential, indicated by the range of soil types, and it appears that Neolithic communities practised a wide spectrum subsistence pattern and that they were capable of choosing suitable soil conditions (Herity and Eogan 1977, 51; Cooney 1979, 83-7). The siting of the Lough Gur settlement has parallels at other Neolithic occupation sites, such as Ballynagilly, Co. Tyrone (ApSimon 1969), Feltrim Hill, Co. Dublin (Hartnett and Eogan 1984), and Lyles Hill (Evans 1953), which are located on focal points generally higher than the surrounding landscape. Most of these overlook rivers or lakes and were positioned to take maximum advantage of the environment which supported the subsistence strategy of the inhabitants. Evidence for the economy derived from the excavations on Knockadoon was somewhat limited. Large amounts of animal bones occurred on all the habitation sites, including the enclosed ones, and it is clear from them that cattle, represented by about 95 per cent (all percentages are by quantity) of the material, had a central if not dominant role. Pig (about 3.5 per cent) and sheep/goat (about 1.5 per cent) were raised and small numbers of horse are also represented. Our present state of knowledge indicates that horses were not present in Ireland before Beaker times (van Wijngaarden Baaker 1974, 346). Dogs were kept and these might have been used in the herding of cattle. Apart from domestic species there is evidence for the exploitation of the wildlife of the area with the occurrence of the bones of fox, wildcat, hare, brown bear (possibly contemporary), red deer, rook, marsh harrier, coot, greylag goose, cormorant, duck and fish; frog bones and oyster shells were also found. The quantity of these bones is small and these species can only have played a minor role in the Neolithic diet as was probably also the case with the edible fruits and nuts of blackberry and hazel found at Sites A, C, D (Mitchell 1954, 487-8) and Circle L. There is limited indirect evidence for cultivation. No cereal grains or grain impressions came from the occupation sites but cereal and cultivation weeds (Gramineae, Plantago lanceolata and Rumex) were represented in the pollen diagrams from the area (Mitchell 1954). A number of small 'rubbing stones' were found on Knockadoon but, as 6 Riordain pointed out (1954, 449), they were probably used for grinding stone axes. Terrace walls, possibly delimiting small cultivation fields, occurred at Sites D and I (6 Riordain 1954, 385-6, 435-8). The field wall at Site I appears to be contemporary with the Neolithic occupation. A number of other, unexcavated examples occur in and across the same valley as Site I. However, the terrace walls at Site D were constructed after the introduction of Beaker pottery. More extensive 'ancient' field boundaries are present on Knockfennel Hill (Pl. I), on the northern edge of the lake, and while they may represent cultivation within the site catchment area their date is, at present, unknown. The overall picture is that Lough Gur had a farming economy dominated by pastoralism in which cattle played a central role. The landscape in the area around the lake appears, on the basis of the pollen analysis, to have been largely open during the Neolithic/Beaker periods (Mitchell 1954). The types of tree represented by charcoal derived from firewood on the habitations were (in order of frequency) hazel, ash, hawthorn, holly, whitebeam, cherry and pine, indicating a predominance of bushes and scrub rather than forest and, as Mitchell has remarked (1976, 122), 'the natural limestone terraces and light soils around Lough Gur on the one hand attracted continuous settlement, and on the other discouraged regeneration of heavy woodland'. The landscape around Knockadoon was eminently suitable for rich pasture and an extensive area was probably exploited by the community which lived centrally in the environment on which they depended. This point is given</page><page sequence="189">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 487 emphasis by the location, during the Beaker period, of the ritual and ceremonial sites on the fringes of the lake defining the area of most intensive utilisation around the settlement which provided the focus for the contemporary management of the landscape (Fig. 75). The settlement It appears that Knockadoon was virtually an island during the prehistoric period as it still remains surrounded 'in part by open water, in part by marsh' (O Riordain 1954, 448). The actual level of the lake, at that time, has been discussed by O Riordain (1954, 448), Mitchell (1954, 485-6), Liversage (1958, 80) and, more recently, O'Cleary (1982, 13-20) who has shown, through excavation, that the lake was much larger before the 1847 drainage scheme. This conclusion accords well with the suggestions of Liversage and Mitchell and confirms the late seventeenth-century documentary evidence (Dinely 1870). It is apparent from the aerial photographs taken in the middle part of this century (O Riordain 1954, pl. XHIa) that a series of earlier foreshores was present, particularly on the southern side of Knockadoon, indicating again that the lake had been considerably higher at some time in the past and that it has undergone continuous fluctuation. This is aptly illustrated by comparing the earlier aerial photographs with those taken more recently (Pl. I) which show a marked rise in the lake, apparently owing to the silting up of the 1847 drainage channels. All available evidence indicates that the lake was larger in the Neolithic period and the short-term changes in its level during the last 150 years are, no doubt, a reflection of more protracted fluctuations over the past millennia. Even if the water level was not higher the Knockadoon peninsula was an ideal location for settlement. The lake and marsh provided an effective natural boundary with only two points of access, one across from the south-eastern side of the lake and the other from the eastern side. An indication of the strategic position of the peninsula was the construction, in the medieval period, of two strongholds, the Black Castle (at the south-east) and Bouchier's Castle (at the east), at a time, as we have already seen, when Knockadoon was an island. There is no evidence for any prehistoric barriers or man-made defensive features?and while perhaps equally secure the settlement differs in this regard from the defended enclosures at Donegore, Co. Antrim (Mallory and Hartwell 1984), and possibly Lyles Hill (Evans 1953)? nor were there any features comparable to the pallisade enclosure at Knowth (Eogan 1984, 219-24). The enclosed habitations are too small to be considered as defensive structures, although they may have provided some measure of protection for the occupants. The nature of the walls can be paralleled at Mullaghfarna in the Carrowkeel, Co. Sligo, passage tomb cemetery (Macalister et al. 1912). While there is no firm evidence that the hut circles there are Neolithic their covering of blanket bog shows that they are at least prehistoric and their siting is very like that of the Lough Gur settlement. Further afield the defended Neolithic sites at Cam Brea, Cornwall (Mercer 1981), and Clegyr Boia, St David's, Pembrokeshire (Williams 1953; Mercer 1981, 194), are encircled by walls constructed in the same manner as the Lough Gur sites. These settlements belong to an earlier part of the Neolithic as do the 'causewayed camps' of southern England (Smith 1971). On the Continent, large-scale enclosed and occasionally defended settlements, as at Sarup by Hoorby, Fyn, Denmark (Andersen 1980), Urmitz near Koblenz, Germany (Boelicke 1978-9), and Biard, Segonzac, France (Burnez 1957), are an important facet of the Neolithic. While these sites are considerably larger than the enclosed habitations at Lough Gur, for example Carn Brea encircled about 7500m2 and Clegyr Boia 2200, the area of the Knockadoon peninsula, effectively the extent of the enclosure for the entire settlement, is about 45ha, which is very large even by comparison with the huge site at Urmitz which encloses about 80ha.</page><page sequence="190">488 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Dating There are four radiocarbon determinations from Lough Gur of which two, 4690 ? 240 b.p. (D-41, c. 2740 b.c.) and 4410 ? 240 b.p. (D-40, c. 2460 b.c), came from the first phase of the Central House at Circle L. The small-scale activity on Geroid Island (Liversage 1958) produced two further dates of 4090 ? 140 b.p. (D-39, c. 2140 b.c.) and 3680 ? 140 b.p. (D-34, c. 1730 b.c). Unfortunately all four determinations have very large standard deviations and are of limited value in dating the settlement. It is therefore necessary to rely on comparative evidence. As has been indicated, some of the western pottery is of a form which could date to an early phase of the Neolithic and has parallels with sites like Lyles Hill and Ballyglass which belong to the period roughly between 3000 b.c and 2500 b.c There is a small amount of other material, such as Vessel 5 from Circle L, which is closely paralleled amongst the burials of Linkardstown Type, which may date to a similar time, and this, coupled with a cautious application of the dates from Circle L, might suggest a limited amount of activity on Knockadoon at an early stage of the Neolithic. At Lough Gur, however, those simpler forms are found in association with more elaborate types, some of which (Class la) are decorated, and with coarse flat-bottomed ware, both of which, in our present state of knowledge, appear to be a feature of the Later Neolithic and probably date to the period after 2500 b.c The consistent evidence for continuity on the habitation sites indicates that the major part of the settlement belongs to the end of the Neolithic in the centuries before 2000 b.c A considerable amount of activity is also associated with the introduction of Beaker pottery and it appears that Neolithic wares continued to be utilised at this stage. As we have seen, both the Beaker pottery and some of the ritual monuments in the Lough Gur area can be paralleled in the eastern part of Ireland. Several of these monuments, including Knowth, Monknewtown and Newgrange in the Boyne Valley, have produced radiocarbon dates and these indicate that Beaker activity in that area spans the period 2100-1800 b.c approximately (Eogan 1984, 245-322; Sweetman 1976; O'Kelly et al. 1983). If we are correct in deriving some elements of the Beaker ritual monuments and the material assemblage from that area then a slightly later date for the Lough Gur evidence seems probable, although no significant time-lag need be postulated. The presence of a small amount of food vessel pottery on Knockadoon, for example at Site 10, shows that there was a limited survival of settlement up to the end of the Beaker/Early Bronze Age and the evidence at Circle P suggests that sporadic activity continued in the area. There seems to have been a renewed, if restricted, interest in the Knockadoon peninsula during the Later Bronze Age as indicated by the clay moulds and some, at least, of the glass beads on sites like Circle K. The later prehistoric period is scantily represented although a few objects dating to the Iron Age have come from the area (Raftery 1984, 58-61, 146) and the fort at Carraig Aille 2 may have been occupied initially in the early centuries a.d. (Caulfield 1981, 208-9). In the Early Christian and medieval periods more extensive activity is attested by a large number of sites, some of which have been excavated (6 Riordain 1949; 6 Riordain and Hunt 1942; 6 Riordain and Lucas 1947; Cleary 1982; see also O'Kelly and O'Kelly 1978). Conclusions An extensive Neolithic and Beaker settlement was located on the Knockadoon peninsula. At least fifteen houses were found as well as a number of other less substantial structures. Several of the houses were contemporary and these are evidence for a relatively large and stable population. As only about one per cent of the peninsula was excavated it is probable that this is only a small sample of the available data. The</page><page sequence="191">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 489 community lived in an agglomerated if not necessarily integrated settlement and the evidence of the enclosed habitation sites suggests that there was an element of ranking within the community at least towards the latter part of the settlement. Although self sufficient, the Neolithic inhabitants had contacts with areas as far away as the north east and west of Ireland and to judge by the number and range of personal adornments the community was stable and prosperous. In the absence of megalithic tombs, usually associated with the western Neolithic in Ireland, evidence for ritual is provided by the 'single' or individual burials on the occupation sites. The beginnings and early development of prehistoric settlement at Lough Gur may be viewed in the wider context. There was extensive earlier Neolithic settlement in the northern part of the country as is demonstrated by habitation sites including large defended settlements as at Donegore but especially the court tombs. Expansion from the northern area, possibly as part of the need for new lands owing to increasing population, might explain the beginnings of Lough Gur settlement. But this expansion may have been part of wider changes involving other factors such as ritual, in which the court tombs were not now an integral feature. One could then picture an impact stage characterised by settlement at Site L with its assemblage of round-bottomed pottery vessels. But before long, one might speculate around 2500 b.c, this stage gave way to a phase which was characterised by consolidation leading to the emergence of a more sophisticated complex which included a range of personal ornaments but especially by the appearance of agglomerated settlement. Because of its natural resources, the Lough Gur area now became a focus for large-scale settlement. Its heart was Knockadoon, a peninsula of 45 hectares approached by two causeways. There emerged a major naturally protected settlement, virtually a village, indicating social stability and wealth, and perhaps equivalent to the great defended sites of the European Neolithic like Urmitz. However, this period of enrichment need not have emerged solely as a result of local enterprise such as intensified agricultural production but could, at least in part, reflect wider developments. Amongst these may have been the establish ment of a role within a wider system of economic expansion and social organisation, while an indirect contributing factor could have been the emergence of the refined Boyne culture in the east. In the ensuing centuries Lough Gur remained stable economically and possibly socially, but with stratification developing in the society, as indicated by the enclosed settlements and more sophisticated personal ornaments. But around 2000 b.c. the established 'culture' was disrupted or augmented. The advent of Beaker pottery in the area could have been only a part of wider introductions including ritual and involving the construction of ceremonial monuments. While this was a period of widespread change some continuity is evident on the settlement. It is clear that at that time new influences, even new people, were affecting Lough Gur. The background to this could have been in the east of Ireland. At least in Meath recent work in the Boyne Valley in particular is revealing an interesting Beaker assemblage, not only artefacts but also settlement and large enclosures including impressive embanked sites. For Lough Gur settlement continued on Knockadoon but enclosures like Grange indicate ritual change and further evidence for that is provided by the wedge tomb, which in addition suggests that extraneous influences were also coming from the south or west. After the Beaker stage the role of Lough Gur in the history of settlement and ritual diminished and it ceased to be the key area that it had been during the preceding centuries. This may have been due to the emergence of a more dispersed settlement pattern during the Bronze Age.</page><page sequence="192">490 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The excavations reported in this paper were part of a long campaign and during that time many people took part in the work.

Appendix A Geological identifications John Rees Trinity College, Dublin All samples were examined using non-destructive techniques (including sectioning) and field names have been used throughout this report. Given the form of analysis, and in the absence of related fieldwork, it was not possible to identify precise sources for the material. A large proportion of the samples are of mudstone or siltstone and the origin of this material is probably in the carboniferous areas to the west of Lough Gur, or possibly the Limerick volcanics. There is, however, some variation in the material and this, combined with the fact that many of the axes appear to be manufactured from well-rolled pebbles, suggests that the immediate origin was in the glacial drift of the area surrounding Lough Gur itself. On the other hand the calc silicate ('serpentine'), of Ordovician origin, is very unlikely to have been present locally and the most probable source for this is in the Clifden/Connemara region. I would like to thank Brian McGonnell for his advice and assistance with the identifications.</page><page sequence="196">Circle J Object Material E251: 101 axe, fragment green tuff E251: 102 axe, chip green siltstone E251: 103 axe, chip green lower Palaeozoic siltstone E251: 104a axe, chip grey-green sandstone E251: 104b axe, chip green sandstone E251: 336 axe Andesitic-Dacitic lava E251: 337-339 axe, fragments Dacitic laca E251:340-343 axe, chips Dacitic lava E251: 344 axe, fragment Dacitic lava E251: 345-373 axe, chips Dacitic lava E251: 374* spearhead grey-green very fine-grained sandstone E25L375 spearhead? brown-black siltstone E25L376, 377 beads green-black, brown mudstone E251:378 bead grey-black mudstone E25L379 bead brown-black siltstone E251: 380 bead calc-silicate (ophicalcite?)

Although situated on rising ground which generally overlooks Lough Gur they are set in a broad valley surrounded by higher ground. Circle O was excavated in 1936 and 1937 and Circle P in 1936 (O Riordain 1936/7, 82). No original documentation for either site could be located but the ground plans of both had been drawn up and these are presented here together with a summary of the known information based on the plans themselves and a short description published by O Rfordain (1936/37, 82). Circle O (Fig. 77) This is a bank faced with upright stones on both sides. Two modern field fences, both banks, overlay the monument. One runs east/west across the centre but this was removed under archaeological supervision in 1954 and no new features were revealed. The other impinges on the south-eastern side of the site and meets the first on the edge of the circle. The enclosing wall consists of a bank of earth which is faced inside and out by continuous rings of boulders set orthostatically. The site is circular and had a maximum external diameter of 54.4m. The bank, including the facings, averages 4,2m in width but is up to 6m wide in some of the unexcavated areas. Although no sections survive the present height of the bank is about 1.2m, i.e. it reaches the top of the facings. There appears to have been no evidence for sockets but some of the uprights were supported by packing-stones. The original entrance did not come to light. Although small patches of paving occurred immediately under the bank 6 Riordain (1936/7, 82) doubted if these were intentional features. Cremated bones were found under the bank but it is not known if they were human or animal. The ground surface within the circle is markedly lower than that outside, averaging 80cm. A partly rock cut ditch was found within the enclosure about 5m in from the inner facing of the bank. This had completely silted up and was not visible before excavation. The ditch was continuous and, in the absence of a causeway, 6 Riordain (1936/7, 82) noted that 'there were at one point on the western side indications that suggested a wooden gangway, but this feature was not fully examined'. An inner ring of upright boulders, centrally placed within the circle, had a maximum diameter of 15m. Packing stones were again used to support the uprights. A pile of large stones was found in the south-eastern corner of the ring. O Riordain suggested that this must have formed a platform or rostrum. A pebble paving occurred throughout the southern half of the inner circle but was largely absent on the northern side. However, owing to the presence of the modern field fence, most of this area was not excavated. A number of stake- and plank-holes occurred apparently at random throughout the same area as the paving but no plan or pattern is descernible. The post-holes, paving and 'platform' were contemporary. What appear to be settings of stones occur in an arc between the outer bank and the inner ring on the eastern side. No other features occurred in the circle but a small area of charcoal was found in the ditch on the western side of the site. There were also two post-holes immediately outside the circle to the south. There were no finds from Circle O. Structurally the closest analogy for the site is the Grange Stone Circle (B) (6 Riordain 1951) which is situated on the opposite, western, side of Lough Gur. At Grange, which had a maximum external diameter of 65.5m, the bank was retained only on the inside by a continuous facing of upright boulders. It has an internal width of 45.5m compared with 44m for Circle O. There are</page><page sequence="199">Grogan and Eogan ?

Nevertheless the similarities are sufficient to establish a relationship between them. The affinities of Grange are with the embanked enclosures found mainly in the east of Ireland, e.g. Monknewtown, Co. Meath (Sweetman 1976), and on structural grounds and given the presence of intensive Beaker evidence at Grange and on Knockadoon it seems probable that Circle O is a closely related and broadly contemporary site. The occurrence of stone facings on both sides of the bank also proclaims a relationship with the enclosed habitations on Knockadoon. The absence of any finds or occupation debris and the presence of the central inner ring suggest that Circle O had a ritual function, another indication of an affinity with the Grange monument.</page><page sequence="200">498 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Circle P (Fig. 78) This site, 30m south-east of Circle O (Fig. 75), is a flat-topped kerbed cairn delimited by a continuous circle of 29 stones of various sizes, the small stones being reinforced by a banking of clay on the outside' set lengthways. Most of the circumference is defined by single blocks but on the north-eastern side two courses of slightly smaller stones were used (Fig. 78: section c-d). The circle has a maximum external diameter of 11m (north-west to south-east) but averages 10.3m. The cairn survived to the height of the kerbstones, lm, but may originally have been higher.

Lough Gur excavations 499 layer of material, about 15cm thick, which was labelled 'old ground level' and this may have been a buried sod. Sockets or scoops contained the base of some of the kerbstones (section y-x) while other kerbs rested directly on the old ground level (section we). The body of the cairn consisted of 'clay and pebbles' with large stones 'concentrated immediately inside the kerb . . .'; scattered bones of animals were found through the filling and also a single human bone, which has been identified as part of a child's skeleton. Several post-holes, including one 'at the exact centre of the monument', occurred beneath the cairn. They did not form any pattern or plan, although they may have had to do with some structure used to lift the stones into position. The central post-hole may have been utilised in marking out the site. A pit, lm north of the centre of the site (Fig. 78: section y-x), had been cut into the subsoil to a depth of about 50cm and had a diameter of about 80cm. The remains of two large pottery vessels (E256: 1, 2; Pl. XXIII; Fig. 79), each containing cremated burials, occurred in the pit. Neither the cremations nor any record of their analysis survive. 'One of the urns was complete but of the other only the base and portion of the body remained.' Both vessels, which are in the National Museum, are of light red coarse ware containing numerous fine to medium grits of quartzite and volcanic ash. They Fig. 79-Finds from Circle P: E256: 2. are flat-based and the walls have an average thickness of 16mm. No. 1 is 30cm high and has a diameter at the mouth of 30cm. The rim is flat-topped and the vessel has a biconical profile with an angular 'shoulder' 10cm below the rim. This vessel was not available for examination. Only the base of No. 2 (17cm-18cm in diameter) survives but it may have been a similar vessel. It occurred at a higher level in the pit and 6 Riordain suggested that it was damaged when the other vessel (No. 1) was inserted into the pit. Dr Rhoda Kavanagh (pers. comm.) considers the vessels to be Cinerary Urns of uncertain type and suggests that as they are not inverted they are outside the normal Urn burial tradition. This, coupled with the absence of a cist, may indicate a late date. While the pit appears to be sealed by the layer described as the old ground level (section y-x), it is clear that its position is projected onto the section. In addition its central position argues against the cairn being accidentally constructed over it. The absence of a cut through the layer at this point suggests that it may be a redeposited feature. The most reasonable explanation is that the upper part of Vessel 2 was inadvertently damaged during the deposition of the second burial contained in Vessel 1. Subsequently the cairn, the base of which was formed by a layer of redeposited sod, was constructed and this was intended as a covering for both burials. Burial mounds and cairns are a feature of the developed Early Bronze Age in Ireland (Herity and Eogan 1977, 151-3) but those without cists are not common (Waddell 1970,</page><page sequence="202">500 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy SP?k &lt; **** ;**, .*?* * &gt; ,w*s ^^m^^^^^K^m Pi.. XXIII Circle P. Vessel E256: 1 in situ in central pit. 101). Kerbs were frequently used to delimit the mound as at Moneen, Co. Cork (O'Kelly 1952). The presence of Circle P indicates that activity in the Lough Gur area continued into a period in the Bronze Age when Urns were the usual pottery in ritual contexts. Although approximately circular, the site has a flattened outline on the western side which is due to the presence of a long slab-like kerb. Directly opposite this is a slight incurving on the east side with a 60cm gap between the kerbs at this point. It is not known if this gap is an original feature. This arrangement is reminiscent of the juxtaposition of entrance and axial stone in the stone circles of Cork and Kerry (6 Nuallain 1975, 84-7). The 'orientation' of Circle P, with the long kerb on the west side, is also similar. While there is no well-defined entrance and the kerbs are</page><page sequence="203">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 501 contiguous and of even height some relationship with the monument complex in the south-west may be suggested. In this regard it may be noted that Windle (1912-13, 304) referred to two 'recumbent' stones about 12.5m to the west of the circle. Other excavations In 1938 O Riordain excavated the 'Red Cellar' cave on the steep eastern face of Knockfennel (OS 6" sheet 32, 17.5cm W, 6.7cm N, 122m OD). This was a small natural rock crevice, which produced bones of Quaternary fauna including Arctic lemming, elk and bear but no archaeological material (Leask et al. 1938, 314). A small ring cairn on the highest point of Knockfennel was also excavated (OS 6" sheet 32, 16.8cm W, 6.5cm N, 162m OD), This had a maximum diameter of 15.25m and was defined by 'a continuous rubble kerb' (O'Kelly 1943, 47). The central portion was a bowl-shaped hollow. Pockets of cremated bone (human?) were found 'at various points round the kerb' but there were no other finds.

Appendix D The chemical analysis of glass from Lough Gur and its archaeological interpretation Julian Henderson Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art, Oxford University Introduction Although the glass from Lough Gur was derived from insecure contexts, it has certain archaeological and compositional characteristics that make it worthy of detailed study. The principal aims of an archaeological and analytical investigation of ancient glass are fourfold:</page><page sequence="205">Grogan-and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 503 (1) to place the glass within a technical tradition which might have a bearing on its date and place of manufacture; (2) to suggest a possible source for the glass; (3) once sufficient analyses have been carried out on comparable and dissimilar glass, to build up geographical distribution maps of chemically characterised glasses; (4) through a close analysis of the archaeological contexts which produced the glass, to suggest a social/economic/ritual value for the glass within a specific socio economic sphere. In this report it will, in broad terms, be possible to fulfil the first two of these aims; future discovery and analysis of more comparable glass may make it possible to fulfil the third and fourth. Although the Lough Gur (henceforth LG) glass definitely derived from the site, there is no reliable record for its archaeological context (see pp 364, 385 and Fig. 22). Out of a total of thirty-three glass artefacts from LG five broken and complete glass beads were analysed using non-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (XRF).1 The technique provides a surface analysis of glass and is ideal for the non-destructive analysis of museum objects.2 Non-dispersive XRF provides a simultaneous analysis of major, minor and trace components which can be displayed on a multi-channel analyser in the form of an X-ray spectrum. By narrowing down the width of the primary X-ray beam with a collimator, a restricted surface area of glass can be analysed. The glass beads All the beads analysed were globular (see Fig. 22) and consisted of a bubbled translucent turquoise (blue-green) glass. A precise typological parallel for the LG beads can be found in some recently excavated examples from Rathgall, Co. Wicklow (Raftery 1973), A selection of the Rathgall beads derive from radiometrically dated contexts of the ninth-seventh centuries b.c. (Barry Raftery, pers. comm.). Although the context information for the LG beads is poor, taking the analytical results (see below) and the typological parallels into account it is possible to suggest that they are of a Later Bronze Age date. It is not always wise to assume that because a close typological parallel can be identified the artefacts were made in the same place or at the same time. An example of two groups of typologically very similar glass beads from Ireland ('Loughey', Co. Down) and England (Meare Lake Village, Somerset) with entirely different chemical compositions has recently been identified, leading to an archaeological reinterpretation of the assemblages from which the beads were derived (Henderson in press, a). 1 The XRF equipment consisted of a Kevex 50k. V. X-ray tube with a rhodium target, a Si(Li) detector and a sample chamber which could be held under vacuum. The X-ray beam was collimated down to an ellipse of 2.2mm in length on the sample surface. Each cleaned sample and glass standard was analysed for 800 seconds under the same conditions at 30k.V.

ND = Not detected D = Detected Results The chemical analyses form a relatively coherent group and are closely comparable with the analyses of turquoise glass from Rathgall. Specific chemical characteristics of the LG and Rathgall glass make it possible to distinguish them from some Continental Hallstatt B, C and D glass and also from Irish, British and European Iron Age glass (Henderson 1982; in press, b; Frana et al. 1987). Quantitative chemical analyses of the LG glass are given in Table 1. It can be seen that analyses 1, 2, 4 and 5 contain approximately equal contents of potash (K20) and soda (Na20), and analysis 3 nearly two and a half times more soda than potash. All the glasses can therefore be described as of a mixed-alkali composition. The predominance of K20 is unusual amongst first millennium b.c. glass compositions, as indeed are the low lime (CaO) contents and the fact that all the glasses contain a relatively low level of magnesia (MgO) with respect to potash. The glass is deliberately coloured with copper in its oxidised state (CuO). The use of reduced copper oxide (Cu20) as an opacifier and red colorant has also been identified in an Earlier Bronze Age glass bead from Wilsford, Wiltshire (Guido et al. 1984). The presence of arsenic oxide in analyses 1 and 3 can possibly be explained as the use of an arsenical copper-tin alloy for introducing the copper colorant into the glass. The low manganese oxide (MnO) contents are to be expected in such turquoise glasses of pre-second-century b.c. date (Henderson and Warren 1983). Interpretation The close compositional and typological similarity between the LG and Rathgall glass (Henderson and Raftery in press; Henderson in press, b) strongly suggests that the LG glass was made with the same or very similar raw materials (sand, a plant ash</page><page sequence="207">Grogan and Eogan ? Lough Gur excavations 505 and a colorant). The results from analyses 1, 2, 4 and 5 are sufficiently similar for it to be possible to suggest that they were made in the same place from a 'batch' of glass and perhaps at the same time as the Rathgall glass. Without the industrial debris from the production process, and considering that glass beads and raw glass can potentially be easily transported (irrespective of whether glass had a ritual or profane significance in society), it is difficult to suggest precisely where the production centre was located. The only similar European glass compositions to the LG glass that can be cited are of glass from Fratessine, Rovigo, near the mouth of the river Po, northern Italy (Sestieri 1976; I am grateful to Dr R. H. Brill for analytical information prior to publication), and from Hauterive-Champreveyres, Lake Neuchatel, Switzerland (unpublished analyses by the author). The same turquoise green-coloured glass was used for the production of beads in both the Italian and Swiss glasses, and, though both sites are earlier (eleventh-ninth centuries B.C.) and there is both typological similarity to and variation from the Irish glass, it is possible that Switzerland or northern Italy were areas of origin for the LG glass. Since Later Bronze Age glass is rare, and where associated with amber, for example, often occurs in smaller quantities, it can be regarded as an exotic substance in western European contexts. Because of its rarity it would not be surprising if it were 'curated' for 100-200 years. Although a continental European source for the LG glass is a strong possibility, an alternative one, which should not be entirely discounted, is Ireland. If glass technology is viewed in the context of other Irish Later Bronze Age high-temperature industries, the necessary pyrotechnology and refractories would be available for glass production. The sophisticated Irish Later Bronze Age gold products (Herity and Eogan 1977; Taylor 1979; Eogan 1981) and the high standard of sheet-bronze working at the time (Herity and Eogan 1977; Eogan 1983) are testament to the skills of the Irish metalworkers. Localised production of faience in Europe earlier in the Bronze Age has been strongly supported through the chemical characterisation of faience using neutron activation analysis (Aspinall et al. 1972; Harding and Warren 1973). Since there is a vitreous component to faience technology, glass might be considered a natural technical development. However, there is no known evidence for Irish faience production. In considering the question of the Irish or European origin of the LG glass, passing reference should be made to recent Bronze Age glass finds in England. The site of Potterne, Wiltshire, has produced glass from eighth- to seventh-century b.c. contexts. Analysis of the glass using electron-probe microanalysis (Henderson in prep.) reveals a range of compositions in use which is distinct from the LG glass, as indeed are some of the glass colours used. The lack of other British parallels for the LG glass underlines the Irish or Continental character of the glass. Since prehistoric European glass technology might be seen as forming a continuum we must also consider any compositional differences between Iron Age and Bronze Age glass. During the Iron Age there were probably several centres of glass artefact manufacture in southern, central and western Europe that produced typologically distinctive products for which localised distribution patterns can be suggested (Venclova 1986, fig. 1; Henderson forthcoming). European Iron Age transparent glass was typically of a soda-lime-silica composition and is therefore entirely different from the LG mixed-alkali glass. For the sake of argument, if the characteristics of Iron Age glass production are used as an analogy for the Bronze Age European glass industry (even though there was considerably less glass in circulation in the Bronze Age), three possible alternative situations can be suggested which might have led to the glass finding its way to LG in the Later Bronze Age:</page><page sequence="208">506 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy (1) the LG glass beads were imported from central or southern Europe; (2) ready-made raw lumps of transparent turquoise glass manufactured in Switzerland or northern Italy were imported to one or more bead production centres in Ireland where they were made into beads; (3) the glass was melted from primary raw materials (in Ireland) using the same glass recipe as used for the glass found in Later Bronze Age Switzerland. Conclusions Since there are as yet no compositional or typological parallels for the LG glass in England, and since its closest compositional parallel is found in glass from Rathgall, Co. Wicklow, and Lake Neuchatel, Switzerland, it is probable that either transparent turquoise raw glass, or the beads themselves, were imported via the Atlantic to Ireland during the Later Bronze Age. In view of other contemporary sophisticated high temperature industries, there is a slight possibility that the LG glass beads were manufactured in Ireland using primary raw materials. Without firm industrial evidence, however, this is difficult to prove. In order to add weight to one or other of these interpretations further discovery and chemical analysis of Bronze Age Irish and European (particularly French) glass is needed. The fact that we can infer anything at all about the source of the LG glass indicates the importance of chemical analysis in the development of archaeological interpretation.
