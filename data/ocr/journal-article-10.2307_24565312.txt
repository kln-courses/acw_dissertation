<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Bitter and Delicious Relations": The Transitional Object in Williams's Poetry Sharon Dolin The Cooper Union Object relations theory grounds human development in the child's relation to others. One of the ramifications of this theoretical shift away from Freudian drive-centered formulations is that the development of language itself and, by extension, cultural production, is no longer predicated on the Oedipus Complex. Instead, language is conceived of as pre-Oedipal, derived primarily from the relation between parent and child. Transitional objects, a key concept in object relations theory, has been described by the British psychoanalyst D. W. Winnicott in his 1951 essay, 'Transitional Objects and Transitional Phenomena," as those special objects, such as "the first soft animal or doll," that a child uses to negotiate her or his separation from the mother, investing these objects with a magical significance (Playing 14). Psychologist John Dore has gone one step further and proposed that language itself may be viewed as a "transitional phenomenon" (Stern 206-07, Dore 234-53). Dore bases this assertion on the results of a groundbreaking empirical study that documents a child's use of "crib-talk"as a transitional object and that challenges the essentialist role of the mother as language-bearer. Re search psychologist Katherine Nelson has concluded that a two-year-old girl's acquisition of language is a product of the ritual of her father putting her to bed each night, conversing with her, then leaving her to "soliloquize" in order to "keep herself controlled emotionally" and to stave off feelings of being alone (Stern 206-07). This recent theoretical assumption, that language itself has the potential to function as a transitional object, makes object relations an ideal theory for literary speculation. In the case of Williams, if we keep in mind his profound emphasis on the object itself as the only adequate symbol-and much of Williams's best poetry is a poetry of objects-what "Bitter and Delicious Relations" 19</page><page sequence="2">would it mean to view the-poem-as-object and the objects within the poem as transitional objects? Nelson's study suggests that language may function as a transi tional phenomenon for a child to detach from the father as well as from the mother, thus extending Winnicott's usual emphasis on the role of the mother. However, Williams's lifelong attachment to his mother and his more distant relation with his father, which are already well docu mented in Paul Mariani's biography and elsewhere, suggest that Will iams developed within a family based on traditional gender roles and so in his case, transitional phenomena would tend to exhibit themselves in relation to the mother. Regarding Williams's hybrid biography of his mother, Yes, Mrs. Williams, Kerry Driscoll has observed that the terms in which Williams describes his mother "evoke an imaginative regres sion, a recovery of the [uroboric] state of infancy in which a child is undifferentiated from its mother.. . . Williams assesses the significance of his mother solely in relation to himself" (62). Winnicott's description of the transitional object seems pertinent here: Transitional objects and transitional phenomena belong to the realm of illusion which is at the basis of initiation of experience. This early stage in development is made possible by the mother's special capacity for making adaptation to the needs of her infant, thus allowing the infant the illusion that what the infant creates really exists This intermediate area of experience, unchallenged in re spect of its belonging to inner or external (shared) reality, constitutes the greater part of the infant's experience, and throughout life is retained in the intense experiencing that belongs to the arts and to religion and to imaginative living, and to creative scientific work. (Playing 14) The drama of Williams's attachment and identification with his mother and his problematic separation from her is a theme that Will iams continues to evoke and work through in his poetry-specifically in his use of recurring images, which function as transitional objects. A quick scan through Williams's Collected Poems will yield several recur ring images that serve as transitional objects.The tree is one such image that figures prominently in Williams's early poetry and that seems to have the potential to function symbolically as a transitional object: from the 1917 'Danse Russe" where "the sun is a flame white disc / in silken mists/ above shining trees" (86-87), to the 1927 short poem "Paterson": -Say it, no ideas but in things - nothing but the blank faces of the house and cylindrical trees bent, forked by preconception and accident split, furrowed, creased, mottled, stained secret- into the body of the light- (CPl 263) 20 William Carlos Williams Review vol. 22, no. 2: Fall 1996</page><page sequence="3">to the 1935 poem "Tree and Sky": Again the bare brush of the half-broken and already-written-of tree alone on its battered hummock- (CPl 385) Williams himself has acknowledged that the tree had a very early primal connection for him to his mother and father. Within his poems, as I will show, he often plays out notions of gender identification and confusion using the image of the tree. On the first page of his Autobiography, he writes about one of his earliest memories-or, rather, what he remembers his mother recollecting about him. He supposedly first laughed as a baby while his father was chopping down a tree: And the first time I ever laughed out loud, Mother says, was when I must have been under a year.... Pop was chopping down a small tree. Each time he'd swing the axe and I heard it wham into the wood, I'd let out a wild cackle of delight. (A 3) While it's tempting to give a standard Freudian reading of the laughter as the child's defense against castration anxiety (it was, after all, a "small tree" his father was chopping down), a less reductive reading concerning Williams's particular gender development may have more explanatory power. Since Williams's mother recalled the incident, we may read the infant's glee as being about Williams's fleeting identifica tion with his father who could knock down the often feminized tree. Think of Williams's "Botticellian Trees,"whose "alphabet of / the trees" becomes "sentences // [that] move as a woman's / limbs under cloth" (CP 1 348-49). Williams found it difficult to sustain a positive identification with the father and is constantly in danger of falling back into his mother's orbit and an identification with the feminine in general, which certainly dominated Williams's emotional and artistic life Toward the end of the Autobiography, Williams records another incident that predates his birth. A woman, who later turns out to be Williams's "old fourth-grade teacher," recounts the following recollec tion to Flossie, Williams's wife: While his mother was pregnant with him, she habitually crossed a public space that was always covered by trees. He writes: She had noted, as a little girl will, that Mrs. Williams was in not too many weeks to have a baby, and she wondered, she told Floss, what it would be, a girl or a boy. It was I. "BiUer and Delicious Relations " 21</page><page sequence="4">Perhaps that explained my love of trees and that my first wish was to be a forester. (A 281) So even before his birth, both Williams's connection to his mother and his gender differentiation are connected with trees in Williams's own mind. Of significance also is Williams's recollection of climbing a tree as a young boy "where I was rocking, swaying with a delightful motion back and forth." His mother disturbs him by calling him down from the tree. He writes, "I can't imagine what was the matter with her" (A 20). Williams, as a boy, was using the tree as a symbol, a transitional object, of the merging and separating from the mother. Here, in memory, it takes the shape of a womblike cradle that rocked and swayed him. Even as an adult, within his poetry, Williams continued to imaginatively transform an external object into an illusory presence-which is the hallmark of the transitional object. For the transitional object is "the intermediate area between the subjective and that which is objectively perceived" (Winnicott, Playing 3), belonging neither wholly to the child's inner world (it's not entirely fantasy) nor to the outer (its reality must be transmuted)-like a work of art. For Winnicott, in fact, as Richard Poirier, points out, "The precursor of poetry is . . . the infant's creative work with transitional objects; the precursor of the poet is the child 'lost in play"' (Poirier 219). Roughly sixty years after the event, it is remarkable-and telling-that Williams (given his scant early childhood memories) still connects the tree with his mother and his prenatal state. "It is creative apperception more than anything else that makes the individual feel that life is worth living," writes Winnicott in his book, Playing and Reality (65). What are the ramifications of viewing Williams's fascination with the visual world, particularly with trees, as imbuing them with the status of transitional objects within his poetry? The tree marks the psychic space where the masculine and the feminine fuse and diverge. If the transitional object functions for the child as the transitional state between his/her fusion with the mother (or father) and the formation of a separate identity, then Williams, starting as an infant boy, takes creative possession of the tree in order to gain autonomy from his mother as well as to begin to establish his masculine identity. It may be, according to Williams, "the woman in us / that makes us write"-lines taken from a 1914 poem aptly titled 'Transitional" (CPl 40). But it is also the man in Wilhams he must create and possess, first imaginatively in order to then detach from his mother. As Nancy Chodorow explains, "a girl's development into a woman is more continuous and understand able than a boy's development into a man." This is because "the girls can begin to take on feminine identification with their mothers, while for little boys, masculine identification comes through a process of differen tiation" (32). We also need to keep in mind that Williams's transition from his close attachment to his mother to autonomy was hampered (or, possibly, his adult detachment from her underwent a regression) due to the very real circumstances of his life: Mrs. Elena Hoheb Wilhams, Williams's 22 William Carlos Williams Review vol. 22, no. 2: Fall 1996</page><page sequence="5">mother, lived withher son and his family for thirty-one years-from 1918, after her husband died, until her death in 1949. Thus, most of Williams's early poetry (after the 1917 volume Al Que Quiere!), was written while his mother was physically living in his home. "Young Sycamore," one of Williams's most important "tree" poems, explores the gendering of an individual through the metaphor of the tree. After the first fine's framework of dialogical urgency, "I must tell you," the visual eye takes over and absorbs the reader in the descriptive verbal scanning of the tree: I must tell you this young tree whose round and firm trunk between the wet pavement and the gutter (where water is trickling) rises bodily into the air with one undulant thrust half its height and then dividing and waning sending young branches on all sides hung with cocoons it thins till nothing is left of it but two eccentric knotted twigs bending forward hornlike at the top (CPl 266-67) As we read down the page, from "round and firm trunk" to the final stanza's two "hornlike" twigs, we are also imaginatively glancing up the tree's form. Williams's trees are almost always eroticized, anthropomor phic, ambiguously gendered. Here, the tree begins with the suggested feminine "round and firm trunk," then "rises / bodily," thus acquiring an unmistakable human dimension. By the third stanza, the tree assumes a more masculine sexuality, with "one undulant / thrust half its height" though by the next stanza, it seems to regenerate itself, almost, through "Bitter and Delicious Relations" 23</page><page sequence="6">parthenogenesis, parenting new branches: "dividing and waning send ing out / young branches." "[I]t thins /till nothing is left of it." Ingrowth, the tree actually diminishes itself until, at the top, it seems more caterpillarlike than human: eccentric knotted twigs bending forward hornlike at the top For all the poem's concision, it manages a rather complex series of visual and temporal operations. It describes the movement of the eye up the tree through time while describing the tree's own growth throughout a larger time scale. It also manages to hint metaphorically at various stages of a person's life: Someone starts out with a "young," "round and firm," and "wet" body, becomes sexually mature and aggressively thrusts him/herself to produce "young," then starts to wane "till nothing is left" but the eccentricities of age. In 1927, Williams was already 44 when he wrote this poem. Y et he seems to have always been preoccupied with the issue of feminine/masculine fusion/differentiation. J. Hillis Miller has remarked that Williams's work differs from Wordsworth's and Tennyson's experience of nature in that in his poems there is a "disappearance of a distinction between subject and object" (290-91). In other words, every time Wilhams writes about trees, he is always writing about himself and the other and their fusion or confusion. So, in "Danse Russe," the tree is both the sign of Williams's separation from his sleeping wife "and the baby and Kathleen" and his union with them. For the bodily inventory he takes, all couched in the coyly hypothetical "If': "I admire my arms, my face, / my shoulders, flanks, buttocks / against the yellow drawn shades,-" it is his shadow against the shades, somewhat treelike, that he is admiring, though here, instead of scanning up his body, as he does in the "Young Sycamore," he scans down, ending with the buttocks, and leaving in shadowy absence his genitals, which distinguish him from the sleeping women and even from the gender-neutral baby (no matter that we know, extra-textually, it is a boy) and, certainly, from the other sleeping woman in the house who goes unmentioned, his mother. This poem also eloquently dramatizes Winnicott's theory of how a child-and therefore an adult-learns to be alone. Recall the speaker's famous exclamatory: I am lonely, lonely I was born to be lonely, I am best so! (CPl 86-87) According to Winnicott, the one necessary ingredient for a child to successfully learn how to be alone is, paradoxically, to have the "experi ence . . . of being alone, as an infant and small child, in the presence of 24 William Carlos Williams Review vol. 22, no. 2: Fall 1996</page><page sequence="7">mother" ("Capacity" 30, his emphasis). Over time, "the individual introjects the ego-supportive mother and . . . becomes able to be alone without frequent reference to the mother or mother symbol" ("Capacity" 32). This poem may suggest that Williams can only happily proclaim his loneliness in the mirror because the feminine (his wife and mother) are asleep nearby, thus illustrating his continuing poetic "dance" of attach ment and separation from the feminine Poirier, quoting Kenneth Burke, makes the following observation about Frost's poetry, that "we invert the usual view that 'words are the signs of things' and instead try to uphold the proposition that 'things are the signs of words'" (Poirier 222). This insight seems even truer of Williams's poetry, whose preoccupation with putting things in his poems has the effect of reifying the words themselves-as may be seen by a comparison of the two versions of "The Locust Tree in Flower," written in 1933 and 1935 respectively, when Williams had already turned fifty. In the first, fuller version, there is the requisite anthropomorphic description: Among the leaves bright green of wrist-thick tree and old stiff broken branch .... (CP1 366-67) The tree is "wrist-thick." Also, of salience is Williams's prepositional positioning: "Among" and "of' gain even more prominence in the pared down famously disjunctive revised first stanza: "Among / of / green" (CP 1 379-80). So the language stresses betweenness along with genitive possession, which is what transitional objects also do. The transitional object occupies the space between self and other, between objective reality and illusion. The radical compression of the revised opening stanza gains through Williams's emphasis of the disjunction and be tweenness of the words themselves as objects or things (Miller 305). Wilhams himself has commented on his own revision: "I cut out everything except the essential words to leave the thing as simple as possible and to make the reader concentrate as much as he can" (CPl 538). Yet a comparison of the two poems shows that what he left in is just as crucial. It remains a poem composed in tercets, a form whose intrinsic property is the quality of betweenness that the middle line establishes between the opening and closing line of each stanza. This betweenness has, I believe, something to do with the tree as a transitional object and "BiUer and Delicious Relations" 25</page><page sequence="8">Williams's initial memories of being inside his mother as she walked through a grove of trees: being fused with her and gaining a rapidly developing individual life; being in the tree in the intermediary stage between attachment to his mother and autonomy, as preserved by the fourth stanza of the first "Locust Tree in Flower": ferncool swaying loosely strung The middle-line's single word, "swaying," is the same Williams used to describe his experience in the tree when his mother called him down: "I was rocking, swaying with a delightful motion back and forth" (A 20). Thus, the word "swaying" occupies the transitional space: It is the position of Williams as a boy in the tree and also of the leaves, the white blossoms (the syntax, in fact, makes it impossible to choose just one). It seems more than coincidental that the one poem Williams trans lates and records of his mother's in Yes, Mrs. Williams, "From My Window," is a poem about trees losing their leaves in the autumn"-a now-tired metaphor for old age, though once illustriously employed by Shakespeare's sonnets: Look, look how they fall They are the dried leaves of the inexorable Autumn No need to be sorrowful they will relive in the radiant Springtime Alas, for lost illusions they are leaves falling from the tree of the heart these will not relive But they are dead in the Winter of human life. (Y 123) Though Elena wrote "Por mi ventana" ("From My Window"), we need to bear in mind that we are reading it through the filtering lens of Williams's translation. Perhaps the act of translation may also serve as a transitional space: Williams, the son, uses English as a transitional object between himself and his mother's Spanish. Driscoll is right to call it "Elena's lofty aesthetic sensibility," but it was an aesthetic sensibility her son shared with her as late as 1917. If leaves in Elena's poem are a metaphor for an old woman's "lost illusions," they are "the stain of love" for her romantic thirty-four-year-old son in "Love Song": I he here thinking of you: 26 William Carlos Williams Review vol. 22, no. 2: Fall 1996</page><page sequence="9">the stain of love is upon the world! Yellow, yellow, yellow it eats into the leaves smears with saffron the horned branches that lean heavily against a smooth purple sky! (CPl 107) As in "Young Sycamore," written ten years later, the phrase "horned branches" arises in an even more frankly erotic poem with a tree metaphor. Moreover, the lineation of "lean / heavily / against a smooth purple sky!" suggests the sexual union of masculine tree and feminine sky, and the "horned branches" are suggestively phallic. For Williams, writing poems was one way of achieving this union of the masculine and the feminine and of acknowledging the fusion and separation of self from parent. The transitional object "symbolizes the union of two now separate things, baby and mother, at the point in time and space of the initiation of their state of separateness" (Wirmicott, Playing 96-97). Jane Flax, a feminist psychoanalyst, has recently written, "(Cjulture, like play, exists in this third area, the potential space between the individual's inner life and objective reality" (Flax 119). While Flax sees the value of object relations theory, she remains critical of its "gender blindness." One need only recall Nelson's study of a daughter's acquisition of language via her father's bedtime chats as evidence that object relations theory is descriptive, not prescriptive, of gender relations within the family. In Williams's case (as in the case of many children even today), he was raised primarily by his mother. Part of what may keep us entranced by his poetry is that his poems dramatize the process of identification and separation with the feminine through the use of transitional objects such as the tree.
