Publication No. 88, 1968. (two reviews) REVIEW NUMBER ONE - CAVEAT ON CAUSES AND CORRELATIONS by Joann W. Kealiinohomoku It has been a recurring observation that dance reflects everyday behavior. It was suggested by Franziska Boas (1944), Holt and Bateson (1944), Kurath (1960), Waterman (1962), and by Lomax and his choreometrics staff (1968). This is avalid observation, but it must be accepted with a caveat. It is valid and of primary importance if, by this observation, it is meant that there is a "relationship between dance and the way of life" as Franziska Boas states (1944:3), but it may not be valid if it implies cause and effect. There is a real problem in Lomax's hypothesis "that danced movement is patterned reinforcement of the habitual movement patterns of each culture and culture area" (Lomax 1968:xv), and that "dance is composed of those gestures, postures, movements, and movement qualities most characteristic and most essential of the activity of everyday, and thus crucial to cultural continuity" (Lomax, Bartenieff, Paulay 1968:224). Lomax, et al, tell us in Folk Song Stle_and Culture that they looked at more than 200 films for analogies between work style and dance style . . . [and] discovered that wherever [they] had adequate records of work and dance from the same cultures, the same or very similar qualities generally animated both members of the pair . . . this conclusion cannot be supported by firm statistical evidence because . . .completely coded both dance and work from only 21 cultures. Nevertheless . . . for a majority of the cases and in a great variety of cultures, work and dance movement styles are virtually identical . . . The best results Joann W. Kealiinohomoku, anthropologist with a major focus on dance, has just completed two semesters teaching on the World Campus Afloat of Chapman College, traveling around the world and throughout the Pacific Basin. Summer of 1974, Ms. Kealiinohomoku will teach "The Hula and Ethnochoreology" for an Institute on Hawaiian culture, and classes in anthropology for the University of Hawaii in Hilo, Hawaii. August 1, 1974 - August 1, 1975, she will be a Weatherhead Scholar in Residence for the School of American Research in Santa Fe, New Mexico and will be writing up her sixteen months of field research with the Hopi Indians of northern Arizona.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 21 are obtained by comparing work to dance, not dance to work. Dance, it appears, has a more crystallized, culture- specific pattern than work. (1968:225) When I first began comparing motor behavior and postures of West African Blacks and United States Blacks, I was struck by the comparable use of the alternating flexed and over-extended knee. I noticed also that West Africans frequently worked in the fields or with a project on the ground to which they bent over from the waist while locking the legs in the same over-extended stance as they sometimes used in dance. I wondered whether this stance was comfortable because of habitual stretching of the ligaments, or whether such a stance was comfortable because the phenotypical shape of the leg and foot permitted it to be comfortable. It is a chicken-egg question. I became increasingly aware of the phenotypical leg and foot configurations in most West African and many United States Blacks, as demonstrated to me by physical anthropologists. At the same time, my study showed that the stance seemed to become less noticeable in United States Blacks' work posture and behavior, but tended to continue in dance (Kealiinohomoku 1965). This suggests that Lomax's hypothesis is useful only for areas that are culturally homogeneous, where there has been little acculturation and minimal technological change. Surely there are few such societies today. Lomax, et al, seem to be concerned with homogeneous societies, rather than societies that have dance as an institutionalized special- ization, and I am not sure how useful that limitation is. But, even for homogeneous societies, his assumptions must be questioned when culture change occurs. If there is a positive correlation between dance behavior and everyday behavior, then the dance styles would be expected to change when everyday behavior changes. They do change, but at varying ratios and with varying degrees of adaptation. Lomax's proposals do not shed light, for example, on why West African dance movements and postures carry over to the United States by Blacks, and have been borrowed to a degree by Whites, when there is little carryover to everyday movement. When change in observable for everyday movements by Hopis, Hawaiians, and Balinese, do their dance movements and movement qualities change accordingly? There is no simple answer, but Lomax does not seem to consider the question. His study suggests that somewhere there are static societies that are instrumentally determined and not subject to the dynamics of culture. There are big problems in trying to correlate work habits and dance. For every positive correlation, I can suggest a negative correlation. For example, where squatting is a common feature of everyday behavior there is no definite correlation with squatting in dance. Okinawans habitually hunker for resting, talking, and working, yet Okinawan dances, so far as I know, never include squatting movements nor any movements that could benefit from the tendon and muscle stretching associated with hunkering. Conversely, typical Russian folk dances for men include a number of movements employing the squat, yet I am not aware of this behavior in their everyday patterns.</page><page sequence="3">22 There are many cases where dance postures and behavior are delib- erately different from work posture and work behavior in order to make dance become super-ordinary. Clothing, too, may be very different for the super-ordinary occasion, as it is in Western ballet. However, the basic shape for the clothing is often constant, and the special touch is to use finer fabrics, vary the dimensions of the clothing (for example, more petticoats for some European folk dance costumes) and to adorn it with jewelry, embroidery, and the like. If Japanese women reflected everyday posture motifs, their dances would be in a bow or on their knees. Kimonos, however, whether common or fancy, bind the legs together and really shape much of the movement style, whether kneeling as in everyday life, or dancing on two feet. It seems to me that occasion and clothing may prove to be more significant than work patterns for shaping dance movements and postures. If we follow Lomax, how can we account for the fact that the East African Masai are pastoral, and the Navajos of the American Southwest are pastoral, but the former are characterized by high jump dances, while the latter cling to the ground in their dances? How can we account for the fact that the Hopis are horticulturists and the Hawaiians are horticulturists, yet the Hopis sometimes prance and dance with their torsos flexed forward, while the Hawaiians keep their feet close to the ground and thrust the pelvis forward in dance? Lomax makes other suggestions concerning "carryovers" from the work/dance analogy. He explains that the films used by the researchers indicate that there are "many examples of the carryover of posture from work stance into dance stance, of work-team shape into choreographic shape" (pp. 224-225). This is a surprising statement from Lomax because there seems to be no inclusion in the choreometric study, at least in the 1968 published form, of the relationships of dancers to one another, nor does the written study indicate even such basic facts as to whether there are solo dancers or group dancers. As a matter of fact, there are many examples from real life to show that one cannot predict "choreographic shape" from "work-team shape". Hopis do not have work-teams, but they always dance in a team. Navajo men do not work in teams, but they, too, dance in teams. In the film Lomax himself made about the hobby horse festivities in Cornwall, England ('Oss 'Oss Wee 'Oss) there is team dancing. Do these men work in teams? I suspect they do not. It is imperative to look for correlations, but it is equally imperative that correlations not be confused with causes. Lomax's arguments about correlations suggest positive causations. It is safer, at present, to look for correlations while expecting those correlations to be part of a network of influences with many parameters that are still unidentified. But even the correlations are suspect in Lomax's work because of the inadequacy of his film sample. The</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 23 sample does not fulfill minimal requirements because it is too limited and in some cases atypical. At least one film was made under contrived conditions: the people who were supposed to dance for the Iroquois Long House film backed out at the last moment, and a different group was brought in, performing out of context and in a simplified version (Gertrude P. Kurath: communication). Although Lomax did not make that film, he should have verified its authenticity before using it. Lomax's experts looked at Polynesia with samples from Samoa and Ellice Islands. Since the choreometric people had not experienced viewing dances from other Polynesian groups, their extrapolation was not correct but they could not really know this. For example, despite the claims that "in Oceania one does not see the full pelvic twisting" and that "Polynesians do not seem to punctuate their activity with bursts of strength or speed" and that the movements are "without sharp- edged focus" (pp. 254-256), such characteristics could be applied at times to dances from New Zealand, Tahiti, Tonga, and traditional Hawai'i. The suggestion that "the behavior of Ellice Islanders . . . may point to some relation between Micronesia and East Asia" cannot be evaluated from the text because they have not included a published coding for Micronesia. Some of Lomax's dramatic conclusions are disturbing to say the least. Here is one sample: Europe: The Caucasian Georgian dance style has a strong stylistic affinity with African movement styles, a weaker one with Old High Culture. Indeed the tightly coordinated Georgian dances are performed with typically Oriental loops and delicate peripheral developments . . . The four-square leg dances of England and western France strongly resemble each other, but show stylistic similarity, as does Portuguese dance, to the styles of New Guinea and Amerindia. This strange connection may be a product of a very meager sample which does not represent the variety of European dance style; nevertheless, northwestern European dancing, with its attachment to the one-unit system of body attitude and simple reversal, properly shows its strongest ties with the four-square, solid-trunk style of the primitive Pacific. (p. 234) I am not criticizing Lomax's collaborators, Bartenieff and Paulay for their space-effort analyses. They are experts in a valuable field. The problem is that Bartenieff and Paulay are not trained in the theoretical concepts of anthropology, and they are not knowledgeable about the intra-cultural and cross-cultural varieties of dance on a world-wide basis. They could not be expected to know that their film samples were so inadequate. Lomax, an innovative thinker, asked some very important questions when he launched the choremetrics project. The interest it has attracted is testimony to this. Even if many of his conclusions are impeachable, that does not undermine the contribution he has made for</page><page sequence="5">24 stimulating thought and opening new vistas. Lomax, however, is not a dance scholar. The lesson to be learned from this is that the ethnochoreologist should be trained in both dance and anthropology, especially if that person is designing and directing ethnochoreological research.

One knows that the authors of the project are human; they have human names and they would doubtless appear very human if one were to meet them over a cup of coffee, but their ignorance of the nature of the dance - of syntactical, grammatical, spatio-linguistic and above all semantic features of dances - seems so profound as to be explainable only by assuming that their minds were taken over by members of an alien race, probably Kryptonians. They speak of unheard of spheres of cultural activity; 'wildly hip- swinging dances of Dogon and Afro-American' which 'form a tight sub- cluster at the level of eighty-two percent' (wherever that is). They attribute to people of our earth such queer features as 'forcefulness parameters'. They tell us that the word 'choreometrics' is a coined term meaning 'the measure of dance or dance as a measure of society' but what the project really seems to be about is fairly naive measures of dance. The reader is led into (but never led out of) a Behaviouristic maze supported several hundred feet off the ground by statistical models which, although perhaps ably and accurately constructed by project statisticians, is an abuse of the model and of dancing. They make the profound error of assuming that human danced actions are mechanical. According to Choreometric theory, dancing does not negotiate insights or mediate meanings. Rather it 'effectively organizes joint motor activity'. *Editorial comment: Drid Williams' review uses the English style of spelling and punctuation and, at the author's request, it has not been edited.

The title of her doctoral thesis is 'The Role of Movement in Selected Symbolic Systems'.</page><page sequence="7">26 It is 'the most repetitious, redundant and organized system of movement'. One would have thought that a redundant system of movement was, perhaps, eating - but the above statements are not about the dances of people - to Kryptonians we are doubtless 'organisms' who display 'behaviours' which are the effects of causes located somewhere in the never-never land between independent and dependent variables and an extremely vague notion of identity criteria. But we know, even if Kryptonians do not, that 'organisms' do not dance, nor construct meaningful action-utterance languages like dances, rites, ceremonials or liturgies. Only people do all of that. But, how much do people count in Kryptonian similarity- wave-frequency-ratio programmes? These are similar, we suspect, to oscillascopes and their programmatic results, used by real scientists to measure sound frequencies. One has the impression that somehow, the dance had to be made to fit into the results of the parent Cantometrics project, started in 1961, leading to Choreometrics around 1967-8. It is here that we can see how very human the director of both these projects is: statistical measure- ments may have worked very well with sound frequencies, we can imagine how they would, and we have all made the human mistake of thinking that methodology appropriate to one kind of phenomena or scientific discipline will be appropriate to another. Mr. Lomax's expertise, and his well- deserved recognition, lie in the field of folk-song; not, as he has admitted himself, in any category of dance. This factor probably explains two of Irmgard Bartenieff's revealing statements (CORD: May 1967) about the project: 1) 'We found an already established approach for linking aesthetic and social behavioural patterns cross-culturally' (underline is mine), and 2) 'Dance cannot profitably stretch its concepts to fit the mold of existing scientific models'. We would emphatically agree, but with one qualification: there are several deep-structural aspects of dance which fit supremely well into non-metric mathematical models. In fact, in order to define the meta- rules of the dance; elucidate the explanatory laws which govern any human actions anywhere in the world, such non-metric models are absolutely necessary. This category of rules constitute only one level of paradigmatic structures of the dance and they must be accompanied with other levels of explanation and description, including first-rate ethnographies of people in the real four-dimensional world, not the shadow world of films. We all know how complex one dance is. We know, too, how long the dance has suffered in the past from academic neglect and trival, totally deficient explanations ranging from the 'scientistic' (i.e. sex, sub- stitution and needs theories) to morally dogmatic censures and literary explanations; often a ragbag of sentimental, casual and value-laden notions about dancers. None of them are of any theoretical or explanatory value whatsoever. We also know that when the dance finally did gain a foot-hold in academic institutions in the United States (owing much to the superb achievements of M. H'Doubler and M. Hill, circa 1915-1925),</page><page sequence="8">REVIEWS 27 it did so under the then respectiable umbrella of the functional- behaviouristic scientific paradigm, as expressed through biology and physiology. Fifty years later, out of date as it is, the paradigm still covers Choreometrics, but here, the Kryptonian mentality reveals itself for what it truly is. On Krypton, a positivistic, nor a linguistic philosophy prevails; naive causal laws, (very like those of Hume) not transformational ones are fashionable; mechanical models of human beings are in order, not anthropomorphic ones. And it seems a great pity, for even if dancers are intuitively uneasy about Choreometrics, they may feel compelled to support the project simply because it has 'made it' in a reputable academic instituion. Or, if dance people do not under- stand Kryptonian jargon and find the graphs mysterious, they may think they are at fault, having been unaware of the extent and depth of the invasion. About the only redeeming feature of Choreometrics lies in the cour- ageous, expensive, though misguided attempts of its many contributors to push functionalist theory and the statistical model to their limits - and beyond. In this, they have done us all a service; for seeing the model in such larger than life perspectives is perhaps the only way of seeing that entirely different approaches to an anthropology of dance are necessary. Anyone who is familiar with various models and modes of explanation in science can see where the faults in Choreometrics lie: 1) the projects' data are filmed, not actual 'behaviour' and because of this, its data are value-laden, prejudiced and incomplete, 2) theoretically, it is internally inconsistent, owing to many ambiguities surrounding the movement units on which it is based, 3) it is impossible to tell on what population parameters Choreometric samples are based; are they geographical or political boundaries, linguistic similarities, agri- cultural distributions, skin-pigmentation or continental units? and 4) this project purports to answer anthropological questions about consistency, continuity and change in human social systems. It is supposed to do this by correlation of filmed dance and non-dance activities, but it just does not provide even adequate, far less satisfactory, answers to such questions. Obviously, there is no available space to take up these points one by one. Suffice it to say that the most striking feature of Choreometric theory to the disinterested, outside observer is the naive causal relations which support the whole structure. Lomax suggests correlations between levels of complexity to be found in dances and levels of technolgical development in a society. He infers that we may expect to find 'simple' dances among people who till the soil with hoes, for example, and 'complex' dances among people who till the soil with tractors. This would mean that the Ubakala Dance Plays (Hanna) the Dance of the Bedu Moon (Williams), Hungarian Folk Dances (Martin and Pesovar), Dance in Bali (NcPhee), Tiv dances (Harper), Yoruba dances (Thompson), Hopi dance (Kealiinohomoku), Anuak dance (G. Lienhardt), Azande dance (Evans-Pritchard) and countless</page><page sequence="9">28 others could be expected to be 'simpler' than the folk dance forms to be found in my native state of Oregon, where farmers (including my grandfather and several uncles) tilled the soil with tractors, combines, etc. Such a contention is simply untrue. It is surprising that Lomax has not been drowned in a righteous flood of fieldnotes before this! 'Motor complexity' is one set of activities; agricultural technology, is assumed to be a constant factor in danced, so-called, 'motor activities' as well. A causal relation is implied between dances and movements pertaining to the securing of food. The two independent activities of 'dancing' and 'working', connected only by virtue of the fact that they are 'group organizational activities' are further connected by a statistical relation between them, established by finding recurring motion patterns, 'shapes' or 'dynamic somethings' in both. Thus, both activities are reduced to their gross 'motor' components and treated as if they were the same. What sort of criterion for identity of 'behaviour' is this based on? We are all, as dance anthropologists (though I personally prefer the term ritual semiologist), interested in a movement unit which could be used for cross-cultural comparison of dance and other ceremonial or liturgical material. Such a movement unit should be mathematically structured, linguistically tied and empirically based. Choreometrics has no such unit to offer. We are also all vitally interested in the definitions of dance: in fact, I reckon we have all racked our brains over this one. Since I have been rather devastatingly critical of Mr. Lomax's definitions of dance, here are mine. Elsewhere, I have asserted that dancin&amp; is the termination, through actions, of a certain kind of symbolic transformation of human experience. I submit that 'a dance' is a visually apprehended, kinesthetically felt, rhythmically ordered, spatially organized phenomenon which exists in three dimensions of space and at least three of time (clock, historical, and rhythmic). It is articulated in terms of the act of dancing on the level of articulation of the dancers' bodies, in a 'body-instrument' space which is ninety-dimensional. It is articulated in terms of 'a dance' on the level of a pattern of interacting forces; the form-space of a dance, briefly definable as the empirically perceivable structure which modulates in and through time. Clearly, such distinctions between 'dancing', 'a dance' and 'the dance' are meant to recall Saussurian distinctions between 'la parole', 'la langue' and 'langage'. The semiotic of dance forms depends on space, time, lighting conditions, orientation, direction and force. Whatever the surface structures or 'styles', dances and dancers have limitations; rules within which they and their semasiological utterances operate. These rules govern any idiomatic or stylistic expressions of dancing. They provide an analytical framework which at once provides a unitary frame of reference without erasing any of the multiplicity or richness of diversity to be found in the world's dances.</page><page sequence="10">REVIEWS 29 Why can we not simply try to understand the nature of The Dance as people on this earth perform it? What prevents us from understanding the gestural languages of people who dance, including ourselves? If the anthropology of dance is to assume its rightful place as a major contributor to general anthropological knowledge, we must be suspicious of methodology and theory which trivializes dance, making what in fact are supremely meaningful human actions into empty, meaningless 'gross physical behaviour'. One would have thought that the effects upon dance education and dance departments might be considered as well: does anyone really agree that future dance research should be determined by the results of Mr. Lomax's project? RUST, FRANCES, DANCE IN SOCIETY: an Analysis of the Relationship between the Social Dance and Society in England from the Middle Ages to the Present Day. London: Routledge and K. Paul, 1969, 280 pages, f3.25. Reviewed by Drid Williams Reading Frances Rust's book on English dancing leaves one with very divided impressions: some very good and some quite the opposite. The ninety-odd pages of historical research, taken by themselves, are very good indeed. This section of Rust's book represents a solid contribution to our subject. However, pressed into the service of a functionalist explanation and a statistical survey, her socio-hist- orical study suffers. Why does it suffer? Rust defines the scope of her book as a 'small-scale pioneer approach to the sociology of dance' which is concerned with one particular classification of dance; i.e. social dance as against all other classifications, and which is also 'scaled down to one particular country' (England) and to a specific period of history (p.xiii). So far, so good. These statements of intention reflect a laudable clarity of expression to be found throughout her work. Drid Williams (see footnote page 25 )</page></plain_text>
