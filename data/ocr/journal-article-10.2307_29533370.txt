<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FLESH AND THE WORD: THE EVOLUTION OF A METAPHYSIC IN THE EARLY WORK OF D. H. LAWRENCE JOHN R. HARRISON In their joint Preface the three authors of the Cambridge Biography of D. H. Lawrence raise certain important issues regarding his perception of identity, especially the ambiguous relationship between what they see as its continuities and its changes. They suggest that a specific idea of identity-a personal core or center, an "essential self," out of which character grows in a process of development-is central to our culture, whereas Lawrence's work has a more powerful emphasis on fluidity and change. Lawrence, in denouncing novelists' depiction of the "old stable ego," preferred to imagine his progress through life in terms of rebirth, again and again, into new states of being. They also claim that three Lawrences emerging from the different biographers' particular material will answer to the ordinary experience of other people, and will achieve "the necessary tension between a continuous and a continuously changing Lawrence" in a way no synoptic view could.1 This is not the place to examine the validity of this somewhat questionable attempt to justify their joint authorship, except to say that the above assess? ment blurs the distinction between the author's preferred way of imagining the development of his own sense of selfhood on the one hand, and his perceptions of identity as expressed in his fiction on the other, particularly his attempts to mine the essential "carbon" of his fictional characters in contrast to what he considered earlier novelists' preferences for the "old stable ego." This is unfortunate even with a writer such as Lawrence whose work is to an unusual degree intimately related to his own personality and experience. Moreover, he also wrote of himself that it would be an absurdity to be one thing today and another tomorrow, which would be to "deny identity": "One may seem very different from one's past, but one is nevertheless the new child Studies in the Novel, Volume 32, number 1 (Spring 2000).

He also believed that every novel must have the background or structural skeleton of a "metaphysic," a concept in which there is no trace of the earlier misuse of the term to mean the science of things transcending what is physical or natural. On the contrary, Lawrence's metaphysic deals with first principles, including being, substance, essence and identity; it is what he called a "theory of being and knowing," or more specifically an attempt to reconcile such a theory with his "living sense of being."3 His first attempts at such a theory were the Foreword to Sons and Lovers, written after the novel and completed by January 1913, but which he never intended for publication, and his "Study of Thomas Hardy," which he had begun by June 1914. Both of these have been interpreted as appropriate to Lawrence's imaginative and philosophical concerns in and after The Rain? bow, but not relevant to anything he had written previously. The first of these views is justified, the second I shall argue is not. The question I wish to address is the extent to which, and the ways in which, the essential percep? tions contained in Lawrence's ontology and epistemology are woven intu? itively into the fabric of the best of his early fiction and provided the imaginative source of the theory, although not precisely as formulated there, and the degree of continuity of such perceptions even within his emphasis on fluidity and change. There is a tendency to assume a consequential relationship between metaphysical ideas and imaginative writing. Lawrence, however, in his Foreword to Fantasia of the Unconscious, claimed the reverse, that his "pseudo-philosophy," as he ironically called it, was "deduced" from his imaginative writings, which "come unwatched out of one's pen."4 These are "pure passionate experience," whereas the philosophy consists of "infer? ences made afterwards, from the experience" (p. 11). It was his "absolute need" (p. 10) for some sort of satisfactory mental attitude towards himself and to the external world that made him abstract definite conclusions from his experiences as a man and a writer, although this metaphysic must always subserve the artistic purpose beyond the artist's conscious aim.5 Whether such a claim is justified, or simply an imaginative writer's attempt to assert the primacy of intuitive perceptions over rational analysis, is an important question regarding the relationship between his art and his metaphysic, and the nature of his creative processes. It is a claim, however, that critics either have ignored, had difficulty in accepting, or disputed. In some of the most important critical studies there are surprising omissions. Neither in F. R. Leavis's D. H. Lawrence: Novelist, nor in Mark Spilka's The Love Ethic ofD. H. Lawrence, is there any mention of either the Foreword to Sons and Lovers or the "Study of Thomas Hardy," which is also</page><page sequence="3">D.H.LAWRENCE / 31 the case, perhaps even more surprisingly, in Mary Freeman's D. H. Lawrence: A Basic Study of His Ideas. H. M. Daleski in, The Forked Flame, makes no reference to the Foreword despite the fact that his subject, Lawrence's concept of duality, is its essential theme.6 John Worthen in, D. H. Lawrence and the Idea of the Novel, comments only briefly and generally dismissively on the Foreword and the "Study" in terms of their form and content, and claims that while the "Study" primarily developed themes subsequently explored in the early drafts of The Rainbow, its "problem" is one of isolation from the literary texts, one of "ideas in a void."7 Where commentators have examined the ways in which Lawrence's intellectual themes are incorporated into his fiction, they have tended to do so by adopting the consequential view that his ideas pre-existed their imaginative expres? sion. Daleski's work in particular is illustrative of this methodology. He envisages the theoretical works as largely distinct in origin from the imagi? native writings, discussing both in terms of the influence of the former on the latter, and stating explicitly that he approaches the novels by way of the ideas that are formulated in Lawrence's expository writings (p. 13). This is also essentially true of two of the most stimulating seminal works on Lawrence, Graham Hough's The Dark Sun and Frank Kermode's Lawrence} Both have difficulty in accepting Lawrence's claim that his metaphysic evolved out of his fiction, although with varying degrees of explicitness. Hough states categorically that the Foreword to Sons and Lovers is a document which could not have been deduced from the novels of the period but was derived from Lawrence's experience of marriage, and is thus intimately related to the complex of feelings that subsequently went to make up The Rainbow and Women in Love (p. 56). Kermode's approach is similar but somewhat more complex. His intention is to explore the "pro? found transformation" of metaphysical ideas in Lawrence's major novels from The Rainbow onwards, to address the "problem of reconciling doctrine and tale" (p. 27), and to show how "the visionary is contained by the novelist, how the prophetic fury is woven into the silk" (p. 7); that is, to show how Lawrence's "doctrine" is suitably transmuted into acceptable imaginative, fictional forms. Seminal works such as these have created assumptions that persist up to the present day, ones which doubt or dispute Lawrence's own view of the matter, or at least beg the question I wish to address, as does F. R. Leavis's later study, Thought, Words and Creativity: Art and Thought in Lawrence.9 Leavis more than once asserts that Lawrence's thought and novelistic art are one, and that there can be no question of "a genetic or dynamic priority" (p. 28) being assigned to either of them. However, he fails to provide any substantial analysis of what he calls this "whole organic complex of Laurentian thought" (p. 86), illustrated by his failure to recognise the implications of the "Moony" chapter in Women in Love. Here Birkin throws</page><page sequence="4">32 / HARRISON stones at the reflection of the moon on the mill pond at Willey Green, cursing Cybele as he does so, but each time sees the "inviolable moon" gather itself together in "triumphant reassumption."10 Cybele was a great mother-god? dess, worshiped as the power of fertility and life, whose acolytes either offered their fertility permanently to her, or preserved the life-principle within their bodies dedicated to the Mother's service. In some versions of the myth her youthful lover, Attis, is also her son.11 Birkin has accused Ursula of wanting love to administer to her egoism and his stoning of the moon's reflection is a symbolic rejection of what he calls the detestable Magna Mater, the "awful, arrogant queen of life" to whom a man must always be considered as "the broken-off fragment of a woman" (p. 200), a theme later developed more systematically but equally bitterly in Fantasia of the Unconscious. Leavis is apparently unaware of these resonances and their obvious relevance to the relationship between Lawrence's imaginative vision, in this case stretching back at least as far as Sons and Lovers, and his later more theoretical expression of its themes. Lawrence's imaginative and theoretical concerns regarding the question of identity had both a personal and a universal dimension: the need to confront the divisions within his own identity, and the imperative to create a new identity for the age, for both men and women. Fundamental to all of Lawrence's thinking on such issues is the concept of polarity: female and male; body and spirit; impulse and ideal; blood-consciousness and mental consciousness; organic and mechanical principles, and so on. This concept is paramount whether it is a question of personal identity, the "soul or self or being" (Lawrence's italics) of every living creature, or of intimate personal relations and involvement in the social and political worlds, or of the ultimate sense of place, the individual and collective relationship with the cosmos.12 Yet the word "polarity" itself has an internal dichotomy in that it can mean the possession of two opposite or contrasted principles, but can also mean, especially in a figurative sense, the direction of thought or feeling towards a single point, and this ambiguity is implied in Lawrence's conception. He believed no human being can develop except through the polarized connec? tion with other beings, a "circuit of polarised unison" that precedes all mind and all knowing, which is ascendent over the human will, and which was embodied in the science of the pagan world, of Egypt and Greece, a "science in terms of life."13 However, the Biblical language of the Foreword to Sons and Lovers suggests a specifically Christian discourse. In fact, it expresses not a theological, but a profound ontological truth which, since it is an intuitive, imaginative and spiritual truth, Lawrence may have been reluctant to express in overtly philosophical or metaphysical terms. The source of this truth, that at Christ's Incarnation "'The Flesh was made Word,'" is a Nietzschean trans valuation of the Christian doctrine expounded by St. John that the Word</page><page sequence="5">D.H.LAWRENCE / 33 was made Flesh, a false premise for which women have an irrefutable answer: they "simply go on bearing talkative sons."14 The Flesh is the Father, forever unquestioned and unanswerable, the primary entity which one can deny but not destroy, out of which comes the finite transitory Word, the Son, which is merely the form or "fabric" of the Flesh-a belief in the primacy of the infinite, "unutterable Flesh" (p. 467) that was a first principle not only of Lawrence's theory of being and knowing and of his whole cosmology, but also of his art. Since the Flesh is also called God the Father, the Almighty, "the Inscrutable, the Unknowable" (p. 471), it has been interpreted as the creative life energy of the universe, the source of physical existence, which is independent of, and infinitely more powerful than, human consciousness and the human will; while the Word has been defined as the products of this creative life energy-nature, humanity and civilization, conscious and intel? lectual endeavor, and spiritual and ethical values.15 However, this interpre? tation, valid as it is, does not reach the quick of Lawrence's theory of being, which is best approached through his accounts of the rose, the poppy, and the phoenix. Lawrence perceived the essential being of any living thing to be its sheer physical existence, its "protoplasm," a substance thought to consist of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen in a complex, unstable combination, to have "vital properties," and to constitute the physical basis of life in all plants and animals. However, for him this was no reductive concept since each manifestation of the generic form is completely new; its like has been seen before but never its exact equivalent. In the Foreword to Sons and Lovers, what Lawrence envisages as "really 'Rose'" is the "quivering, shimmering flesh of flesh ... the eternal, the unquestioned, the infinite of the 'Rose', the Flesh" (p. 470). The rose is most vividly itself in the flower, a perception echoed in the "Study of Thomas Hardy" in the "gaudy, fleeting poppy" that squanders in the "red outburst" of its flowering all its labor, energy, chemistry, and "careful architecture" (p. 8), but in doing so consum? mates its "fiery self, the flower, gorgeously" (p. 52). Its essential being is manifested above all in its evanescent abundance, just as the phoenix, having attained maturity and wisdom, bursts into flame and expires in ash; yet the flame and the ash are "the be-all and the end-all" (p. 10), which may seem to be a wasteful ordering of things but is the reality of life and the triumph of being. It is the excess of self at its maximum of being, quivering on "the brink of the unfathomed void" (p. 18), the unknown. It is the affirmation that being has nothing to do with religious or moral precepts, self-preservation, or the "strenuous purpose" that has evolved nations and "tremendous governments" and "the whole frantic turmoil of modern industry," but is manifested in "the exclamation of joy, or of pain . . . which announces T am F" and nothing more, that the final aim of every living being is "the full achievement of itself."16 It is instinctive, spontaneous, physical, purely organic, uncon</page><page sequence="6">34 / HARRISON scious, and non-intellectual life, which has no purpose other than its own efflorescence, its fullness of being.17 In humans this is revealed in the spontaneous life of the body, for example in Sons and Lovers in the "dusky, golden softness" of the young Walter Morel's "sensuous flame of life, that flowed from off his flesh like the flame from a candle" (p. 18), or in his son's "flame that had lit a warmth" (p. 182) in Miriam Leivers, but which in the Foreword manifests itself primarily "in the Flesh, in Woman" (p. 471) who is the source of instinctive or blood-knowledge and who produces all the rest of the flesh, including "the intermediary pieces called man" (p. 470). Thus the first principle of the creative life force is female: the Father should be called Mother, the source of renewal and identification with the Flesh, to whom a man goes for "suggestion and renewal," to be re-born of her and then go to his work, "his Uttering," bringing to it the vigor of his "scrambling body, which is God Almighty in him" (p. 471), since in the flesh of the woman "does God enact Himself (p. 472), a relation between the flesh and the word which Lawrence explored primarily in the B rang wen marriages in The Rainbow. Such perceptions mark a significant change in Lawrence's depiction of relationships between men and women and there can be little doubt that this was the result of his intimacy with Frieda Weekley, whom he met when, like Paul Morel, he was "suffering for want of a woman," an intimacy which inspired the perception that "all women in their natures are like giantesses."18 The dichotomy of the Flesh and the Word had informed Lawrence's fiction from the start, but often with the female/male polarity opposite to that which characterizes his metaphysic. Since much of his imaginative exploration of this theme is concerned with what he perceived as wrong in terms of identity, it is in some ways the negative polarity out of which grew the countervailing positive of his theory of being. Thus in the early fiction the Flesh is usually embodied in virile male characters and only rarely in women. In the main Lawrence had known and imaginatively created what he called soulful or "Dreaming Women" whose passion "exhausts itself at the mouth," who want "passionate love without physical desire."19 In Sons and Lovers, Miriam Leivers can be only Paul's conscience, not his "mate" (p. 337), their relation being on a "high plane of abstraction" where his "natural fire of love" is transmitted into a "fine stream of thought" (p. 210). While he tries to paint the "shimmering protoplasm" of things rather than the "stiffness" of their shape, because only in this "shimmeriness" is the "real living" (p. 183), it is only when hearing him discuss Michelangelo's paintings that Miriam feels she is "fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life" (p. 232). It is likely that in Lawrence's theory of being his choice of the rose to illustrate the quivering, shimmering flesh of flesh, the infinite Flesh, was a reversal of the rose bush incident in Sons and Lovers, in which Miriam's roses are symbolic of her intense spirituality-white, "incurved and holy,"</page><page sequence="7">D.H.LAWRENCE / 35 with a "white, virgin scent"-and in which, when Paul's look seems to "travel down into her," it is "the communion she wanted" (p. 196), a communion of the word not of the flesh. The female characters in Lawrence's early fiction are predominantly dreaming women such as Helena, in The Trespasser, who doesn't have Siegmund's "brightness and vividness of blood" (p. 64), and for whom the "dream" is always more than the "actuality"-the physical man, "burning, volcanic, as if he would destroy her" (p. 69), to whom she coweringly offers herself, as Miriam does to Paul, "to sacrifice." However, although the perception of sexual identity here seems to be the reverse of subsequent associations with the Flesh and the Word, one can see Lawrence feeling his way towards the perception of woman's regenerative role as subsequently expressed in his theory of being. Following the sexual consummation of their relationship, Siegmund feels "transported to a new life" (p. 72), restored to the full "'will to live'" (p. 87), losing himself in the woman who is the "centre and swivel"20 on which he turns. Even Helena has an intimation that she is the "earth in which his strange flowers grew," giving him a "new, soft beauty" (p. 69), but it is an experience from which she feels she will emerge at best as "metal to be cast in another shape" (p. 119), at worst "blasted" (p. 87). Siegmund has sensed her revulsion from his physical being, rejecting him '"as if I were a baboon, under my clothing'" (p. 74). Having cut himself while swimming and seeing the blood run down his thigh, he is invaded by a sense of a pristine, purely physical identity: '"That is I, that creeping red, and this whiteness I pride myself on is I, and my black hair, and my blue eyes are I. It is a weird thing to be a person. What makes me myself, among all these?'" His confusion does not dissipate the intensity of the perception that his physical being is the elemental source of his identity, a post-Darwinian perception wh;ch, despite its formulation in consciousness, is not so much mental cognition as thinking in, or through, the body: "It was his physical self thinking." For Lawrence no marriage service can declare a man and a woman to be "one flesh"; the Word can only confirm what the Flesh decrees. The deepest impulse of attraction is beyond choice, consciousness, will or ceremony; it is a manifestation of the cosmic life-energy. In the Foreword to Sons and Lovers he claims every woman demands that a man shall come home to her as simply her man of flesh to be "restored," "nourished," "re-born of her" (p. 472); if he does not, it is a universal law of the Flesh that she will reject him and both will be destroyed. In Lawrence's early fiction such a law seems to apply universally; there are virtually no such revivifying relationships. Both in fiction and in reality, Lawrence envisaged contemporary male female relationships as a total failure and saw the exploration and the establishment of a new relation between men and women as the critical issue</page><page sequence="8">36 / HARRISON of the age, and as such central to both his theory of being and his literary mission. This theme is explored imaginatively in the contrasting identities and marital choices made by the two Lindley sisters in "Daughters of the Vicar,"21 which involve a choice not only of a husband but of life and identity, incorporating a kind of death for both of them, albeit of a different nature. Mary, the elder, who has the "proud, pure look of submission to a high fate" (p. 42), chooses to marry her father's curate, a "ch?tif (puny) Oxford M.A. who lives only from his strong, philosophical mind, a "perfect Christian" whose religion consists merely of a "calculated well-doing" (p. 50), and whose body is "almost unthinkable" (p. 48). However, her choices are self contradictory and wilfully self-deluding. From a sense of family duty she chooses materialism to avoid materialism, while from a mistaken sense of moral purpose and moral right she chooses to be a "pure reason" like her husband, devoted to "high-minded living" (p. 56) but devoid of feeling or impulse. She contracts what, in the "Study of Thomas Hardy," Lawrence describes as a "spiritual marriage, bodiless"(p. 115), electing to get "rid of her body ... for a higher thing" ("Daughters," p. 56), to sacrifice the inscrutable flesh, of which she is the living embodiment, to a perverted conception of the word-a "murdering" of her identity which breeds hatred and self-hatred and a nihilistic urge to destroy: "Sometimes she felt she must rise and bring about death, lift her hand for utter denial of everything, by a general destruction" (p. 57). She hates motherhood because it makes her "live again in the flesh" instead of merely in the mind, so with her purpose "broken in two," she becomes "amorphous, purposeless, without real being ... a fragmentary, ignoble thing." While this perception of female identity was partly derived from Lawrence's personal experience of women such as Jessie Chambers, Helen Corke, Louie Burrows, and Agnes Holt, in the "Study of Thomas Hardy" he argued that it was the legacy of centuries of British Puritan moralism, of sexual repression and sublimation that had imposed a female identity that was the antithesis of the embodiment of the Flesh, one that insisted on the "bodilessness of Love" in order to "attain the condition of Knowledge" and "escape the conditions of being" (p. 116). This idea is foreshadowed in The Trespasser, embodied in the character of Helena, an example of "a certain type of woman" who has for centuries rejected "'the animal'" in humanity and made herself "abstract" so that her "blood runs in bondage" (p. 64). In contrast, in "Daughters of the Vicar" Mary's sister, Louisa, rejects such "high spirituality" (p. 58) and is determined to have a man she loves as her birthright, although for neither of them is it a matter of conscious choice. Alfred Durant is one of "the vulgar" (p. 41) she has been taught to despise, until during a visit to his terminally-ill mother she is asked to wash his back</page><page sequence="9">D.H.LAWRENCE / 37 as the miners' womenfolk do. At first, resenting the "almost repulsive intimacy" of such contact (p. 72), she is drawn towards this "living centre. Her heart ran hot. She had reached some goal in this beautiful, clear, male body. She loved him in a white, impersonal heat... Now her soul was going to open, she was going to see another. She felt strange and pregnant" (p. 73). Although he feels no connection between them, she being "all that was beyond him, of revelation and exquisiteness" (p. 75), he is aware of her not in his conscious mind, but in anticipation of Lawrence's relocation of consciousness in Fantasia of the Unconscious at a more primal level: "his chest was conscious of her . . . she carried him with her into an unformed, unknown chaos." Louisa's commitment to love is inseparable from the unknowable impulse, beyond choice, which impels her to Durant: "Suddenly a sharp pang, like lightning, seared her from head to foot, and she was beyond herself (p. 81); it is both "a kind of death of herself (p. 82) and a kind of pregnancy. One sister experiences the death of identity in the flesh; the other, a rebirth into a new one. However, Louisa is a unique example in Lawrence's early fiction of what the "Study of Thomas Hardy" calls the "true female," who will "eternally hold her body superior to any idea, will hold full life in the body to be the real happiness" (p. 94). Lettie Beardsall, in The White Peacock, might have been such a female but surrendered herself to family expectation and marital duty. Clara Dawes, in Sons and Lovers, might seem to be another one-a perception of woman and of sexuality as a manifestation of a universal, creative life energy is contained in the accounts of her intercourse with Paul Morel, in which she is described as a "strong, strange, wild life, that breathed with his in the darkness" (p. 398). Both are described as the embodiment of the universal Flesh, united in the flesh with the living cosmos: Just as he was, so it seemed the vigorous, wintry stars were strong also with life. He and they struck with the same pulse of fire ... It was as if he and the stars and the dark herbage and Clara were licked up in an immense tongue of flame which tore onwards and upwards. Everything rushed along in living beside him, everything was still, perfect in itself, along with him. This wonderful stillness in each thing in itself, while it was being borne along in a very ecstasy of living, seemed the highest point of bliss. (P. 408) Compared to Miriam's "impotence" before him, which is her "extremity," this ecstasy of living, this highest point of bliss, is the human equivalent of the shimmering flesh of flesh of the infinite of the rose, the red outburst of the poppy's flowering, the expiring of the phoenix in flame and ash-the excess of self at the maximum of being. However, this is Paul's, not Clara's, passionate and imaginative experience: although she knew "something great</page><page sequence="10">38 / HARRISON enveloped her," she had not "realised fully" (p. 398) and "did this for him in his need" (p. 397). The ontological dichotomy of Word and Flesh is not so much a meta? physical concept as the imaginative realization of fundamental aspects of Lawrence's own identity and, more importantly, of the deep divisions within that identity which he recognized and confronted at an early stage but which continued throughout his life and work: for example, divisions between the "irritable geyser" of his soul, which enabled him to write "delicately and well," and a purely physical identity of which he was proud when working in the hay fields, feeling "as complacent as a god," his hands "brown, hard, and coarse."22 He may satisfy his moral sense by working within the parameters of what he can achieve artistically, but a man's body is "a quivering plasm of what will be," and for real satisfaction he must give himself up to "complete quivering uncertainty, to sentient non-knowledge," since he is "like a palpitating leading-shoot of life, where the unknown, all unresolved, beats and pulses, containing the quick of all experience."23 He believed this dichotomy was his genetic and family inheritance, and there is ample evidence that the young Lawrence inherited from his father Walter Morel's warm, spontaneous, non-intellectual nature and the capacity to radiate warmth in those who knew him "as if [they] had drunk wine."24 However, under the influence of his mother and the "soulful women" with whom he was intimate before he met Frieda Weekley, he learned to repress, and especially after his mother's death to hate in his father, this most vital part of himself. He embodied this division in a series of contrasting fictional characters; in Sons and Lovers, for example, although again the reverse of the female/ male polarities which emerged in his theory of being, in Gertrude and Walter Morel: she-puritan, "high-minded, and really stern" (p. 18) and "deeply religious" (p. 17); he- "full of colour and animation," with a flame of life that is both sensuous and free, not "baffled and gripped into incandescence by thought and spirit as her life was" (p. 18). It is also embodied in contrasting male characters such as Cyril Mersham in "A Modern Lover,"25 an exquisite aesthete who moves indolently and lies limply in a chair saying "clever nothings in a lazy drawl" (p. 39); and in Tom Vickers, a handsome man with the fine limbs, large thighs and thick wrists of a man of "healthy animalism" (p. 39), and a "fine elastic adjustment" (p. 44) of his body to his movements. From the nature of the language associated with this latter manifestation of what Lawrence conceived as the polarities in his identity, it might appear that he identifies with the strong, physical, manly and uncomplicated at the expense of the intellectual and aesthetic. In fact, as the detached, artistic observer he aspired to be at this time, together with a possibly unconscious need to maintain a creative balance or at least a psychological truce between</page><page sequence="11">D.H.LAWRENCE / 39 them, he tries to ensure that he does not identify with either, not entirely successfully. Lawrence could not help giving, almost certainly reluctantly, an implied supremacy to what he sensed was at this stage the more influential aspect of his identity, although not one likely to ensure him either comfort or lasting happiness. Mersham, bidding Vickers goodnight, murmurs, '"Sic Transit,' . . . meaning Tom Vickers, and beautiful lustihood that is uncon? scious like a blossom" (p. 45). The most extensive early treatment of such a "manly" man would seem to be that of Annable in The White Peacock,26 a man of "magnificent physique" and "great vigour and vitality" (p. 146) who chooses to live according to what the "Study of Thomas Hardy" calls "some primal morality" (p. 28), the "vast, unexplored morality of life itself," against which people draw up the "little, pathetic pattern of man's moral life" to defend themselves against the "immorality," the "waste enormity" (p. 29), of nature. Having chosen to live by the principle "be separate in your own soul, and live," Annable tries to ensure that his children live it instinctively, in sentient non knowledge, not contaminated by the "painted fungus of rottenness" (p. 146) which is civilization. He wants them to grow up as natural as birds, weasels, vipers or squirrels, able to fend for themselves "Tike wild beasts do,'" because'"when a man's more than nature he's a devil'"(p. 132), a conception of the corrupting influence of modern western civilisation that Lawrence asserted increasingly forcefully. Annable is described variously as a "brute" (p. 135), a "devil of the woods" (p. 146), and a "malicious Pan" (p. 130), a judgement that seems to be born out by the violent scene in his home in which his wife, in a state of near hysteria, tries to cope with these children reared in a state of nature. However, Lawrence's theory of being as subsequently expressed in the "Study of Thomas Hardy" presupposes that all individual identities comprise both male and female, and that a man who is "strongly male" tends to live essentially to satisfy some purpose and take "no heed for his body," his "more female part" (p. 94), and Annable is no brutal, uneducated gamekeeper but someone whose identity is deeply ambiguous in much the way Lawrence's was at the time of writing. Rather preposterously, but in keeping with the literary and philosophical ethos of the novel, he had been a Cambridge undergraduate who failed to complete his course, and subsequently a parson with a fine old church and a "great rich parsonage" (p. 149) in Leicestershire, where he married into the gentry. He is now a "thorough materialist" (p. 146) who scorns religion and all forms of mysticism, who resents any sign of "culture," and yet addresses his wife as Proserpine, the Roman goddess of fertility. His motto is '"Be a good animal, true to your animal instinct'" (p. 147), but even this is a quotation from Herbert Spencer.</page><page sequence="12">40 / HARRISON Jessie Chambers believed that a "living vibration" passed between Lawrence and the "wild things" that constitute the natural world, that he was in "primal sympathy" with the life and forms of nature, in which what he means by Flesh is inevitably paramount and most readily perceived, "as if a bit of apple-blossom stood for God in his Wonder."27 Yet Lawrence's early fiction is characterized not only by this sense of empathy, but by an even more profound and instinctive feeling of identification between the individual and the entire cosmos. To Cyril Beardsall, in The White Peacock, the hills had been his "walls," his "own beloved sky" his "roof overhead," the stars his siblings, "born when I was born," and the sun a father to him, "all my father to me" (p. 260), an identification echoed in Sons and Lovers by Gertrude Morel's impulse to give the infant Paul back again to the sun "whence he came" (p. 51). The sense of the need for the r?int?gration of personal identity and the cosmos that became so striking and pervasive in Lawrence's work is here rooted in the feeling that it was generated in him and subsequently nurtured by cosmic forces. This was no adopted literary concept but deeply ingrained in his psyche, and while a product of the intense, sensitive response to the living forms and rhythms of nature that he shared with his father, it is often expressed in feminine terms and imagery.28 However, Lawrence rapidly dispensed with the over-elaborate descrip? tions of nature which are so abundant in The White Peacock, but not, I believe, for the stylistic reasons he gave.29 It was more probably because he sensed the incompatibility between the rather self-indulgent, anthropomorphic ide? alization of nature which in his next novel, The Trespasser, he was to depict critically in the character of Helena, and his perception, later objectified in the Foreword to Sons and Lovers, of nature as the prime manifestation of the "quivering, shimmering flesh of flesh" (p. 470), supremely indifferent to human concerns. This perception is projected onto Siegmund, in The Tres? passer, who is aware that under the "delicious warm surface" of life is the "relentless mass of cold beneath, the mass of life which has no sympathy with the individual, no cognisance of him" (p. 94). The contrast is at its starkest in the internal tension of the description of Annable's funeral in The White Peacock, held on an early spring morning when there is "a certain thrill and quickening everywhere, as a woman must feel when she has conceived" (p. 155), and when one can see the "bright ecstasy" in the eyes of a nesting thrush, because of the "rounded caress of the eggs against her breast!" Yet the cry of the peewits, birds of augury, sounds like despair, echoed by the grief of the coffin-bearers, who will remember all their lives the "smell of new, warm elm-wood" (p. 156), cut and planed to fashion Annable's coffin. Yet no more than a momentary gloom passes across the face of nature, reflecting the unsentimental relation between the human and the natural that his life embodied. Two swans sail "with perfect blythe grace" across the unruffled water of the mill pond, and a pair of horses nod slowly across the</page><page sequence="13">D.H.LAWRENCE / 41 fallow in the still valley, "full of sunshine and eternal forgetfulness. The day had already forgotten" (p. 157). After the funeral Cyril Beardsall soon begins to feel "indolent" and then "very glad" (p. 158) as he strokes the laughing faces of the coltsfoot and smells the scent of black-currants. The tone of this incident reflects not so much the deliberately-assumed detachment of Lawrence's fictional persona as a deep, instinctive sense of the subtle and intimate intermingling of the human and the non-human, birth and death, joy and grief, lifelong remembrance and eternal forgetfulness, the sacramental and the mundane, and of the ambiguous nature of the human sense of oneness with the earth and the ultimate indifference of the cosmos towards human affairs. After Leslie Tempest's serious injury in a car accident, Cyril feels that the earth "must listen to us; . . . she soaks up our blood tenderly, in the darkness, grieving, and in the light she soothes and reassures us. Here on our earth is sympathy and hope, the heavens have nothing but distance" (pp. 194-95). It was a distance that Lawrence, in A Propos of "Lady Chatterley's Lover," would later attempt to bridge: It is a question, practically, of relationship. We must get back into relation, vivid and nourishing relation to the cosmos and the universe ... This is an affair of the individual and the household... Then the ritual of the seasons, with the Drama and the Passion of the soul embodied in procession and dance, this is for the . . . whole community, in together? ness. And the ritual of the great events in the year of stars is for nations and whole peoples.30 Such passages explore aspects of human identity which are both in? tensely personal and universal, an expression of Lawrence's sense of a cosmic creative life energy, of the profound meaning the natural world had not only for him personally, but which he believed it held for everyone. Both Lettie and Emily in The White Peacock believe that snowdrops and mistletoe are something out of an old religion, perhaps of "some strange hearted Druid folk" (p. 129), or some "knowledge" that humanity has lost: "we can lose things from off the earth-like mastodons, and those old monstrosities-but also things that matter-like wisdom" (p. 130). Cyril disagrees with such an intuition; it is against his "creed" to accept that such primeval knowledge and wisdom are lost to the human race, a creed that Lawrence embraced with increasingly powerful conviction in his later work, although not without considerable soul-searching. In March 1915, he wrote to Bertrand Russell asking if he might send him some of the "philosophy," the "revolutionary utterance," he was working on. He felt himself to be "a piece of darkness pulsating in shocks," in a "subterranean black universe" of dark passions, full of "things which have not yet had being," but which nevertheless constituted a terrible, ultimate reality, a stark contrast with the "entire unreality" of the material world. He</page><page sequence="14">42 / HARRISON wanted Russell to "swear a sort of allegiance" with him, to be with him "in the underworld,"31 although I am not sure that the man often considered the greatest logician since Aristotle was the most appropriate choice. Lawrence was clearly experiencing a dark night of the soul, a kind of death and re-birth (he feels he is writing from a grave or a womb), the kind of spiritual identity crisis that has been a manifestation of the search for both Christian and anti Christian identity: of Christian mystics such as St. John of the Cross and Christian converts such as T. S. Eliot, but also of a Nietzschean trans valuation of values, the "downgoing" and "overgoing" which in Thus Spake Zarathustra he embodied in the symbol of the phoenix, and which Lawrence adopted as his own. It is a theme that Lawrence returned to time and again as certain of his fictional alter-egos undergo the same kind of identity crisis, one foreshadowed particularly powerfully and disturbingly in The Prussian Officer.32 Written in early June 1913, shortly after the Foreword to Sons and Lovers but before the "Study of Thomas Hardy," it narrates the conflict between a Prussian infantry captain and his young orderly which has been interpreted variously in terms of the brutality of Prussian militarism, homo? sexuality and sado-masochism, conflict between Consciousness and the Unconscious, Lawrence's conception of historical cycles or of the Fall of Man, but whose real theme, I believe, is the battle between fundamental divisions in his own sense of identity up to that time and beyond, a battle to the death.33 The officer is a man of "passionate temper" (p. 4) who has the look of a man who "fights with life" (p. 2) and who always "kept himself suppressed" (p. 4), who refuses to allow any "stirring of his innate self," but who is a "devil when roused" (p. 2). His orderly might have been one of Annable' s sons, one who "never seemed to have thought, only to have received life direct through his senses, and acted straight from instinct" (p. 3), with a "zest, such as wild animals have in free movement" (p. 4), which was like a warm flame upon the older man's "tense, rigid body" (p. 3). The officer's repressions cause him to inflict increasing physical violence on the servant which, given the power relation, the latter can do nothing to resist, and from which the officer derives a "thrill of deep pleasure, and of shame" (p. 6), but against which he experiences a "whole agony of reaction" (p. 8). Consequently, despite the "intense gratification of his passion," he instinctively attempts to repress it, "rigid with a will to keep blank his consciousness, to prevent his mind grasping." Subsequently, when on maneuvres some instinct in the young man "suddenly jerked free" (p. 14), causing him to snap the officer's neck across a tree stump, after which he is like a man in the darkness who has gone into "the unknown," feeling a "big pulse of sickness" throbbing in him as if "through the whole earth" (p. 17), the pain of "another single self (p. 20). However, "It was all right, somehow . . . now he had got beyond himself (p. 18), experiencing a "sense of arrival... amid the reality, on the real, dark</page><page sequence="15">D.H.LAWRENCE / 43 bottom" (p. 19). He dies the same night and the two bodies are laid side by side in the mortuary, the officer's "laid rigidly at rest," the orderly ' s "looking as if every moment it must rouse into life again, so young and unused, from a slumber" (p. 21). This is one of the most intense and disturbing treatments of identity in Lawrence's work, one which depicts a literally bloody battle between what he saw as polarised sides to his nature: on the one hand, the decisive rejection of the "old" Lawrence-the one he believed the women in his life had insisted on making "moral" and "abstract"; a passionate but repressed man whose body had consequently come to feel fixed and "almost unliving"; an imper? sonal, detached, stiffly self-disciplined man who seemed to have always had to fight with life, in the way Paul Morel seemed to do: "Battle-battle-and suffer, it's about all you do" (p. 300); and on the other hand, the freeing of the self he justifiably believed he had been when young, personified by the young orderly in The Prussian Officer-a "warm, full nature" (p. 4), a "vigorous, unconscious presence" that acted "like a warm flame" (p. 3) on others. It is clearly possible to interpret this story, and the disturbing intensity of the violent passions released, as Lawrence confronting, and ruthlessly repressing, latent homosexual tendencies in himself, and this has been the predominant, although not unanimous, critical response.34 In my view, it is more likely that the homosexual dimension is essentially an imaginative requirement: that the fictional description of the confrontation between different components of his identity calls for two male protagonists, although the conflict is between what he perceived as the masculine and feminine sides of his nature. Both the repressed homosexual attraction of the Captain for the orderly and the power relationship that allowed his sadistic indulgence of it are needed to generate passions of sufficient power and violence to cause their mutual destruction. Lawrence intended this battle of identity to be to the death, but with the promise of resurrection for the body that "must rouse into life again, so young and unused." Written soon after the Foreword to Sons and Lovers and while working on The Sisters, this story is a particularly revealing example of the relation? ship between art and metaphysic, one that reaches both backward and forward in Lawrence's life and work. It is a remarkably intense treatment of the internal conflict between the over-developed word and the suppressed flesh, an exploration of identity essentially in the context of "his innate self (p. 4). As a result of a savage exploration of internal conflicts involving a substantial rejection of important aspects of his past, and a sense of unknown dark forces, both exterior and interior to one's identity, which were increasingly to occupy and disturb his mind in the coming years, there is a symbolic glimpse at the end of new life and new possibilities. What the young man experiences, and what he sees and imagines after the killing, reflect Lawrence's own experiences and recurring concerns, images and themes pertaining to identity</page><page sequence="16">44 / HARRISON up to and including The Rainbow: a farm and a church spire; a woman "crossing there to the other side," a "bright, solid unreality" (p. 19) with whom he has now no common language; a sense of isolation, separation, and yet freedom in the dark but "open land," with all the others, "father and mother and sweetheart" (p. 18) left behind; the vivid response to sheer physicality, human and non-human; the cosmic life-pulse that throbs not only in people but through the whole earth; the sudden eruption into consciousness and action of uncontrollable, unconscious psychic forces; the constant interplay between literal and symbolic horizontals and verticals; banked mountains "ranged across the pale edge of the morning sky," which in anticipation of the symbolic connotations of the rainbow at the end of the novel to which it gives its name, arch "still and wonderful between earth and heaven," which in their beauty seem to have "that which was lost in him," so that "he wanted to leave himself and be identified with them" (p. 20). The relationship between art and a metaphysic is inevitably complex and problematic, particularly so in Lawrence's case as his approach to such matters is essentially subjective, and the link between the two is as intuitive as is that between the form and content of his epistemology and ontology. The primacy of the Flesh as the creative life energy of the universe is reflected in the primacy of the irrational power of the imagination in art. Frank Kermode suggests that Lawrence qualified his claim for the primacy of his imaginative vision by adding that it existed first as a dynamic idea or metaphysics and was then unfolded into his life and art (p. 28). What he actually wrote, in Fantasia of the Unconscious, was that people live and see the world according to "some gradually developing and gradually withering vision" (p. 11), which also exists first as a dynamic idea or metaphysics. However, the "old veil of vision" needs to be ripped across in order to find "what the heart really believes in, after all." If Kermode's interpretation of Lawrence's two statements is correct, the second is not a qualification but a contradiction of the first. Lawrence did not mean that his metaphysic had prior existence, but that a "dynamic idea" is an imaginative and intellectual force in action, one that exists as "passionate experience," partly conscious, partly emotional, partly aesthetic, partly intellectual, in a synergy that cannot be separated into discrete entities, but with an unmistakable emphasis on the wisdom of "the heart." Thus the imagination, operating dynamically in the fiction and largely beyond the conscious control of the intellect, creates the substance and forms from which the doctrine is subsequently deduced, certainly up to the completion of the "Study of Thomas Hardy," a doctrine that Lawrence later developed and refined but which in its essentials remained the same. A careful analysis of Lawrence's early creative and intellectual pro? cesses provides substantial confirmation of his belief in the irrational power of the imagination as the driving force of those processes, a conviction which is not only fundamental to an understanding of his own work, but one shared</page><page sequence="17">D.H.LAWRENCE / 45 by writers such as Blake, Nietzsche and Yeats.35 Moreover, while the source of Lawrence's perception of the interdependent polarities of the Flesh and the Word was his own sense of identity, there are also intimations in his early work of their presence in the creative individual and collective relationship with the living cosmos to which in his later work he became so deeply committed imaginatively, intellectually and spiritually, and which is reso? nant of what Jung called the Collective Unconscious, and Yeats, Spiritus Mundi. Lawrence's treatment of such polarities was not idiosyncratic, but his unique contribution to a literary and intellectual tradition manifested in ways which are imaginatively closest to Lawrence in Blake's "Contraries" of Body and Soul, without which there is no progression, and in his belief that "Energy" is "Eternal Delight"; in Nietzsche's conception of the creative tension between the Dionysian and Apollonian; and in what Yeats perceived as "Unity of Being." The importance of Lawrence's intense and lasting concern with the nature of human identity is not only that it enabled him to recognize and come to terms with the polarities within his own identity, and to explore propheti? cally the complexities of his fictional characters, but that it taught him the nature of the fundamental unity of his creative and intellectual processes, and especially the knowledge that, in the words of one of Blake's Proverbs of Hell, "What is now proved was once only imagin'd."

See also David J. Gordon, D. H. Lawrence as Literary Critic (New Haven and London: Yale Univ.

Montgomery's stated aim is to "penetrate the ground of unity between the fiction and philosophy ... to understand the ways in which the fiction is prophetic but also the ways in which the philosophy is poetic" (p. 3). In fact, his approach is overwhelmingly philosophical and almost wholly external to the imaginative texts.

Somers in Kangaroo, "broken off from the England he had belonged to, feeling that every aspect of his identity has been entirely stripped away, left "mindless and memoryless," remembers being in Cornwall during the First World War when the night descended on the dark moors and granite masses "so ancient and Druidical." He feels himself invaded by the spirit of the ancient pre-Christian world, drifting into a "dark blood-consciousness" that makes him "savage" and "strangely sensitive" to the "mystery of blood-sacrifice" (Kangaroo, ed.

Kate Leslie's belief that the clue to all living and to "all moving-on into new living," into "future possibility," lay in the "vivid blood-relation between man and woman." This requires her submission to the "ancient phallic mystery," the old "dark consciousness, non-cerebral, but vertebrate," which is part of the "mystery of the twilit, primitive world" that has gone by but has not passed away, and which involves "the death of her individual self and her rebirth as the living goddess Malintzi (The Plumed Serpent, ed.
