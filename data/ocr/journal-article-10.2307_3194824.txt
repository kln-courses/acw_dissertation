<plain_text><page sequence="1">Towards Re-presentation: Spatiality and Voice in Roger Vitrac's Surrealist Sketches Martine Antle According to Vitrac, the intentions of Dada were not understood due to the fact that all manifestations of Dada were remembered for their provocation rather than being recognized as "poetic" or "theatrical" works: Le Coeur a qaz was written in several minutes for a Dada manifestation which took place at the Montaigne Gallery. That is to say that the play wasn't one. Many remember that it was produced without scenery by actors without coats [.. .]. At this time, they considered Le Coeur a qaz not as a poetic or theatrical work but as a manifestation designed to make the public furious.' (my underlining) During the Dada period, the theatrical text and the stage set lost their importance on behalf of spontaneous creations. This spontaneous aspect of presentation, which can be compared to the Commedia del- l'arte, prefigures the "happenings" of the 50s and 60s. Like the Dada movement, the "happenings" were born of visual-movement painting and sculpture and had as their goal the complete suppression of the actor/ spectator duality. This new actor/spectator relationship present in Jarry's Ubu plays, is surely the most important legacy for Vitrac's surrealist theater. As early as 1921, before Antonin Artaud's writings on the theater, Vitrac published an article entitled "The Alchemist" in which he presents the idea of a magic theater: His revealed theater [that of the alchemist] presented no role, other than seven characters who may or may not be anthropomorphic, it was hard to know in spite of their regular, rigid faces, because their bodies were constantly changing shapes, following a law that I found fabulous.2 Theater, as Artaud understands it, calls for a wide definition of the term and includes all expressions of psychic activities (gesture and cry) in addition to the physical existence of each scenic object. This is precisely what happens in Vitrac's sketches as early as 1922. In Vitrac's surrealist theater, visual and auditory elements take priority-the language of words gives precedence to the language of the stage. Vitrac also, like most surrealists, brings dream to the stage and widely uses its mechanisms in his surrealist plays. This leads us to rethink the function of referentiality in surrealist theater, referentiality which loses its fixity to assume a mobility that plays an essential role in Vitrac's first theatrical period. This mobility is especially emphasized through the central female character.3 In this study I will examine the notion of theatricality in four of Roger Vitrac's surrealist sketches:4 Le Peintre (1921), Poison (1922), Mademoiselle Pidge (1922) and L'EphgmBre (1929). More particularly, I 19</page><page sequence="2">will show how these sketches sign the end of mimetic representation and function as artifact. I will examine how spoken language is replaced by scenic language (voice, light and sound as physical materiality on stage) and how the scenic space leads to a fictional dramatic scene.5 Le Peintre, a one-act farce, staged in 1930 at a private party in the home of Lise Deharme, shows the close link between the female character-as-object and the objects which create her particular world. These elements deepen the vision of the female character and bring to the surface aspects of the woman-as-object-of-negation in theatrical presenta- tion. For example, Mrs. Parchemin (the female character) is negated throughout the play because her perception of the color red is denied by Mr. Parchemin, who claims the scenic space is green. Hence, the color (red) of the scenic space functions as the medium through which the feminine identity is projected. At the beginning of this sketch, whether for the reader or the spectator, the signifier red is present. The color red is not named immediately, therefore it gives the spectator no more than a floating signifier. This signifier appears through several languages: 1. Visual/gesturing: "A painter paints a door red." "He paints the wom- an's and the child's faces red." 2. Sound: 'Mrs. Parchemin and Young Parchemin exit crying." This sketch becomes a metonymy of the circus and what interests us here is that on the one hand, the female character's identity comes from the scenic space as such and not from the dialogues. On the other hand, when the signifier red, which belongs to the scenic space, is named, it is negated several times in the dialogues: PAINTER: You insist that this door is green? MRS. PARCHEMIN: No, it is red, red, red. Perception of the color red is negated to the end of the sketch when Mrs. Parchemin endorses her husband's rule: "It is green, green, green." The female character's perception is negated through the dialogues: she is only presented through didascalia, or specifically scenic language. Moreover, in Le Peintre, Vitrac, with constant movements of Mrs. and Parchemin Junior from inside to outside the stage, resorts to an infinite play or oscillation between the scenic space and what could be called "off-stage." As we have seen, the color red as perceived by the female character, indicates the unrepresentable. But the color red painted on the faces of Mrs. and Parchemin Junior represent on one hand what is off-stage (or "hors-scene") since these characters leave the stage as soon as they are painted red, and, on the other hand, the passage from scenic (or from text) to off-stage. Objects in Le Peintre add to the "virtual" character of re-presentation. The most striking object is the set of false teeth that Mr. Parchemin has ordered for his wife's birthday: Mr. PARCHEMIN: The prison? Mr. GLUCOSE: The set of false teeth The box opens by itself. A set of gold false teeth appears. (20, my underlining) 20</page><page sequence="3">The false teeth play a crucial role because they make concrete Mr. Parchemin's intentions of controlling his wife. Moreover, the female character is associated here with a surrealist object that is not representa- ble as such. This object superimposes two levels of representations: one belonging to the real (teeth) and the other to the surreal and to dream imagery (the box, the teeth and their respective movements). Poison (1922), a drama without words dedicated to Andre Breton, could be read like a surrealist collage exploiting all the arts and all materials since from scene to scene, the stage is transformed progressively from "mirror," to "written poem" and to a "fabric of tattered silk."6 In this sketch, plastic and visual elements take over the scenic space by them- selves. Visual, gestural and auditory elements become language and interconnect to give rise to a succession of images similar to a series of cinematic images. In the first scene, the scenic space divided in two by a mirror, is essentially an unstable space in which decor, characters and sound effects (explosion) merge into one another, as the gigantic figure issuing from the broken mirror indicates.' The enormity of the feminine figure alters the dimension of the stage: The back of the stage represents a huge mirror-An explosion takes place breaking the mirror in pieces to uncover the shadow of a nude woman who is as tall as the theater. The feminine figure-half plaster, half woman-shrinks (or rather explodes) to normal height and the silent yet moving presence of the female character signifies as much as the props. Through distortion of the female body, the theatrical presentation undergoes a process of continual destruction. The status of the female character (as a mobile signifier, on the borderline between being and nonbeing) and her gestures (though minimal), become a theatrical set for language. This passage from animate being to inanimate nonbeing is also found in Les Mustares de ramour8 (1923). For example, in the second act of this play, Mother L6a appears, "carrying in her arms a doll of half-red, half-yellow material" (25). L6a identifies herself with the doll and finds her own likeness in it; but at the same time this identification is made through a fragmented figure with the use of synecdoche in which the whole (in the example below, the face) remains absent since it is not mentioned as such: LEA: Just look, Patrick. She has my eyes, my nose, my mouth. What a pity that they cut her hair like that. Is it a little chinese girl? I'm blond. But you know quite well she is your's. (26, my underlining) The signifying doll sends us back to the blurred referent mother/- object, and/or, mother/child who is playing with a doll. As soon as the doll object wakes up and cries, it becomes L6a's child and is treated like an object that one can place in a river and on which one can inflict dismemberment:9 21</page><page sequence="4">A little girl's head rests on the pillow. (26) We shouldn't notice that the child has been sawed through at the shoulders. (27) The mutilations of the child's body are displaced onto the mother's body. She leans toward the bed and takes out the eyes of the little girl. They are as large as ostrich eyes. LEA: My eyes, Patrick! My eyes! (27, my underlining) This text then, functions to indicate that the feminine character remains an unstable figure: mother/child, animate being/inanimate being and has no place within the "scriptural"'0 object other than as un- representable. In Mademoiselle Pidge (1922), a fragment" as Roger Vitrac calls it, the feminine character is removed from theatrical presentation. Miss Piege is an absent character about whom one can only guess on the basis of fragmented dialogues. The mystery of this fragment centers on the absence of the female character. The theatrical text and didascalia make this character a mobile, polyvalent signifier. For example, Miss Piege, either "she" or "it" refers simultaneously to a dress or to a box: CHENE: Here is Miss Piege's dress. PLOMB, pointing at the box: She/it is there. (27) In this sketch, the scenic space remains undefined. It emerges only from the bits of dialogues: we know there is a manager, an elevator, the "49," which suggest that we are in a hotel hall. In addition, Miss Piege's name can be read literally; she is herself the location of the "Piege" ("trap") and this is confirmed by Mr. Clair who comes down with bloody hands, and Mr. Mus6e (senior) who disappears into the elevator, leaving his son despondent. From a semiotic standpoint, the character's name in theater may have a communication function in the construction of the scenic space. We will note here that in this sketch the name of the character (Miss Piege) is her single means of representation. Moreover, the absence of Miss Piege on stage allows us a glimpse of another stage. This stage doesn't belong to theatrical presentation but it designates the location of a trap as a name.12 A similar imaginary space evolves from the last act of Poison through the presence of a silent voice. The last act is composed of a single sentence: "The stage represents a mouth which gives the appearance of talking" (54). The semblance of speech which this mouth expresses, signals the end of a language of words, while suggesting through its silence and movement, the off-stage presence of a voice which occupies the whole dramatic space. We will note here that the space of the voice excludes sounds. Gestures and visual elements are the substitutes of sounds on stage as the silent mouth indicates. In L'EphimBre'3 (1929), a "phantasmagoria" dedicated to Andre Breton, the voice plays a crucial role in the construction of the dramatic space. An anonymous voice is heard from the beginning of this sketch: 22</page><page sequence="5">The theater, as the curtain rises, presents complete darkness and silence. One can hear the "EphtmBre" fly, while a very small and distant yet perceptible light, to the left of the theater, varies in intensity with the insect-winged vibrations. An anonymous and monotonous voice is heard, depending on the words it utters, in a very high timbre. (27, my underlining) In the didascalia, the voice, (which we will call the play's voice since it is not presented by any character), is heard in a ringing of varying intensity along with that of light. The play's voice appears then both through sound and visual elements. But, on stage a voice is present: VOICE (of man). This voice echoes the ringing of the play's voice, which is at once the bird and the Eph6mbre's voice: VOICE (of man): [.. .] And the bird rings, the bird rings, for it will never sing. (57, my underlining) Moreover, the Voice (of man), referred to as "Sir" by the Woman's Voice, is perceived as the play's voice: WOMAN VOICE: You are laughing? VOICE (of man): No, it isn't me, it's the Ephembre. (58) In the theatrical presentation, the location of the voice remains undetermined. The Voice (of man) and Woman's Voice "reflect" on stage the play's voice. The play's voice can be represented through characters (spoken voice) and through the visual field (silent voice: play of lights). However, it can leave the visual field (the whirring of the invisible Ephe'mbre: "We can hear the Ephembre fly"). This indicates that the play's voice occupies the entirety of the theatrical space. The voice in this sketch weaves a real spider web: the one being visual (characters, light show) and the other a non-visual one (inarticulate voice and sounds). Thus, the voice takes on the concreteness of a stage object, filling the whole theatrical space. The play's voice occupies the stage in the strict sense of the term (stage on which a number of characters appear) as well as the whole theater. Its multiple echoes along with the contrast of light and darkness create a virtual or imaginary stage. Even though the play's voice may seem to be represented by characters (through sound or lights) it is in fact detached from any physical localisation. Later in the play, the Voice (of man) and the Woman's Voice are replaced by the first and second reflected lights, by the name, still that of the Ephemere. Vitrac specifies in regard to the character-reflections: That is to say that everything is only suggested on stage by ordinarily dazzling parts: daylight for objects, the shining part for characters. (62) The characters-reflections are just lights then, which sends us back to the Eph~mbre, and therefore to the anonymous voice at the beginning of the play (or the play's voice). And here, as the play unfolds, the only physical elements to which the play's voice is attached are no more than 23</page><page sequence="6">shadows of bodies-or fragmented bodies--suggested by the "gigantic sky which pants and breathes" (59) and the eye with "a lid closing itself" (68) at the end of the play. Yet on stage, a child is present throughout the sketch. The child seeks the Ephembre: CHILD: Tied to the Ephembre I searched for it everywhere. The most beautiful sleeper, the feather, the diamond, the winged pod. (66) The Eph(mmre evokes an air fairy ("Une fee abrienne"), or mother- effect ("Ephembre/mbre-effet"), a word created in French by the rever- sal of phonemes, presented only by the sound element and light show in didascalia. The play's voice (or voice of the mother) indicates the pres- ence of a mother who remains unseen during theatrical presentation, but whose voice would have the power to completely annihilate the perfor- mance, as the end of the play indicates: "The set changes to represent an enormous eye closing itself." This ending, similar to the last scene of Poison (the giant mouth as stage set) emphasizes the scenic concreteness of the voice-the other theatrical set-both in and out of the visual field, and which for this reason subverts the limits of theatrical presentation. We could ask here if Vitrac's sketches are impossible to present? How can we produce some of the characters' transformations which take place on stage? For example: "The child removes its feather, and is immediately changed into a gigantic Ephmemre which flies across the appartment. Finally he [the father] reaches it and the monster falls" (66). Only modem theater methods, namely the film or video screen could produce such texts. But this medium would change both theatrical code and message because, in contrast to the theater, film directs the spectator's eye. Vitrac turned toward the cinema at the end of his career but he never associated theater and cinema, even if his theater and cinematic research were oriented toward a new conception of space."4 In his concept of theatrical presentation, based on the direct relationship between the spectator and the actor, film was never the equal of theater for Vitrac. The novelty of Vitrac's sketches resides in the fact that they are addressed to the reader as much as to the spectator, since they require an imaginary structure. For example, the presentation of objects that come on stage and come to life, or characters who suddenly appear "out of plaster," are in fact "virtual images." Vitrac himself specifies the virtual quality of objects and images in the didascalia of L'Ephedmre: The stage empties instantly and is suddenly invaded by phantom objects. It is completely filled with armor, tools, furniture, machines, columns and plants. A prodigious disorder of virtual images is superimposed and emanates in all directions. (59-60, my underlining) Elsewhere, this juxtaposition of odds and ends, similar to the bodies of Ubac's photographs,'5 is characteristic of surrealist painting and 24</page><page sequence="7">writing. The scenic space created in L'Ephemere is merely a poetic space, in which "virtual" images unfold. Here the stage would be a "poetic raw material" on the basis of which the theatrical re-presentation takes place. In L'Ephemere the passage from scenic (or textual) to off-stage, is achieved through voice and the sound element. In Mademoiselle Piege, Miss Piege, absent from stage, represents the off-stage. The movement towards the off-stage is traced here by the elevator, and by the gestures of characters who actually "plunge" into it. In Le Peintre, as we have seen the color red assures this passage to the off-stage. In Poison, the theatrical text functions like a "geno-texte." It forms a real symphony of gestures ("sym- phonie gestuelle"), a term which, according to Anne Ubersfeld refers to "complicated texts whose diverse elements function in semantic combina- tion and visual scenes."'6 This type of space (or "plural spaces") presented in Vitrac's surreal- ist sketches becomes a veritable space of sign and requires a resemantisa- tion for reader or spectator. In this permanent spatial deconstruction, the theatrical space for the reader and/or for the spectator becomes the space of the non-representable. In other words, the reader and/or the spectator must fill in the lack of continuity with the imaginary: beyond the text and virtual stage crossing each other here. In Vitrac's sketches, the off-stage is conveyed through manifesta- tions of the human body (voice/gesture) and through inanimate objects, or by transformation of body into object, rather than by dialogues. There are no mimetic or iconic relationships either in the text or in the presenta- tion itself. In fact, as Umberto Eco and Anne Ubersfeld have pointed out, the theatrical sign "is never isolated but always functions in relation with both its scenic and fictional context" (Ecole du Spectateur, 129). The theatrical text or the theatrical presentation can be read or presented ("presente") endlessly: The word "representation" is inaccurate although custamary to the extent that it assumes that something will be re-presented which in another space (of a book or play) has already been presented once. But "reprd- sentation" is "presentation." The "representation" is a work of art, or more precisely an artistic production in which the linguistic part (of the text) is not decisive. (Ecole du Spectateur, 10, my underlining) Vitrac's surrealist sketches always evoke an imaginary stage or off-stage. However, Vitrac goes beyond questioning the referentiality of the stage and its power to represent an imaginary world. His sketches also announce the auto-referentiality of theatrical space-and its power to assert itself as artifact-in contemporary drama of the forties and fifties. Whether the geared down space of Poison, or the later gigantism of the stage-set in his most famous surrealist play Victor ou les enfants au pouvoir, theater as Vitrac conceives it, leads the way to modem theater, because it is the meeting point of all arts: performance (theater/dance) as well as non figurative painting. His theater prefigures Artaud's total theater and calls for a poetics of space, constantly questioning the concept of traditional presentation. Vitrac's surrealist plays cannot be classified 25</page><page sequence="8">except among those plays considered "experimental" since, as we have seen they stand on the limit of possible presentation. This may be why they haven't yet received the full attention they deserve. University of Wisconsin, Madison NOTES 1. Roger Vitrac, "Guet Apens," Les Hommes du Jour, 4 August 1923. 2.

The female character passes through a verita- ble metamorphosis, at times physical at times symbolic. These transforma- tions appear on stage as well as in the writing ("l'criture"). While the woman behind all these transformations becomes more multi-faceted, the scenic space undergoes constant upheaval, leading to a new definition of theatricality. 4. Roger Vitrac, Thcitre III. Le Peintre (1921), Poison (1922), Mademoiselle Piege (1922), L'Ephimbre (1929), (Paris: Gallimard, 1964). The quotes in this article are my own translations. 5. In this article I distinguish three different types of space: 1. The scenic space refers to the stage in the strict sense of the term. 2. The theatrical space includes the scenic space as well as the spectators, that is, the whole theater. Finally the dramatic space incorporates the theatrical space as well as the fictional space created by reader or spectator. 6. Whether through collage, rayogram, solarisation, frottage or decalcomania, surrealist artists used many different types of materials and objects in their art. Moreover, writing itself stopped being a literary object and became an artistic object. 7. I would like to emphasize the originality of this sketch both in its genre and in the theatrical viewpoint it presents. It can only be compared to George Ribemont-Dessaignes "Projet de Ballet." The ballet sketch puts on stage twelve "tubes" whose movements are organised around a female nude. This sketch is related to Poison by its scenic movement and the numerous appearances and disappearances of characters. However, it never leads to the overthrow of scenic space we find in Vitrac's work. This sketch is reproduced in its entirety in: George Ribemont-Dessaignes, Presentation, biographie et bibliographie par Jean-Pierre Begot (Paris: Editions Champ Libre, 1974) 128-129. 8. Roger Vitrac, Thcitre II, Les Mystires de l'amour (1923), (Paris: Gallimard, 1948). 9. We will recall Hans Bellmer: his "Distortion" as well as his numerous dolls who have been purposely designed to be continuously transformed and/or dismembered. 10. We make a distinction here between the object having a scenic existence and the "scriptural" or "textual" object. 11. Does Vitrac suggest here that the "fragment" could be a genre of its own in theater? The sketch has the word "fragment" as a subtitle. One could think, while reading Mademoiselle Pidge that the "fragment" designates the genre as well as the discontinuity of the writing of the sketch and the fragmented image of Miss Pidge. 26</page><page sequence="9">12. In Vitrac's work, the spectator and/or the reader is not only the recipient of the verbal and scenic message or receiver of communication in process. He is written into the theatrical code and texts, producing them endlessly. This is exactly what happens in Mademoiselle Piege. The "piege" also refers to the presentation trap. In fact, the spectator finds himself caught in a trap that he doesn't understand and thus he takes part in the presentation. 13. The word "ephembre" in French has a double meaning. As an adjective, it means ephemeral, but as a noun, it refers to the ephemera or may fly. Thus, it designates both an insect and the evocative state of being "short-lived." 14.
