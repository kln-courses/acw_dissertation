<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Peregrine's Saga and other Stories of the Country Green. By Henry Williamson. [Pp. vii + 301, with illustrations by Warwick Reynolds.] (London : W. Collins &amp; Sons, 1923. Price 7 s. 6 d. net.) This book of animal stories differs in some essential respects from other similar volumes. For one thing, most of the tales have an unfortunate ending. This is no doubt as it should be if the pictures are to be true to life, where the happy ending is a rare event. But there is something beyond that in many of them - the gruesome touch of le grand guignol . Perhaps this is also as it should be, but we hope not. The knighted squire who gleefully releases a deliberately blinded peregrine to avenge himself for raids on his pet pigeons, or the pauper who fieezes to death after his last meal of rat and owl, can hardly be every-day personages. The author has an easy and vivid manner of recounting his tales, and is evidently on intimate terms with the wild life of the countryside. Although his interpretation of animal actions is distinctly anthropomorphic, he takes but few liberties with facts. If his raven does live to become a centenarian and his peregrine stoops at pigeons at two hundred miles an hour, and he mates his carrion crow with a rook, these are perhaps legitimate liberties, for they concern the heroes of stories that are exceptionally well told.
