<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> GENUS, LXV (No. 0), 99-143  BERNARDO COLOMBO    Human rights, ideology and population policies        From the moment in which I accepted, or rather received the invitation  to give a report on the theme set for this morning, I felt and continue to feel  my heart shrink. I am not a philosopher in law, or in politics, neither am I  an expert on social history; eyen as a demographer, as a result of so many  commitments which over the last few years have kept me away from my  favourite fields of work, it seems to me I now belong to this particular  international community more as an amateur than as a professional. But it  has not been so much, or principally, the awareness of these and other  personal deficiencies which has kept me in a continuous state of  apprehension, but rather an acute sense of inadequacy. The prime source of  my embarrassment is in fact the actual theme for discussion.  Recently Bernard Berelson, writing about social research in the  demographic field, has succinctly summed up the difference between the  scholar and the person who deals with political decisions by recalling the  saying according to which the first one tries to solve puzzles, the other  problems. This also is clearly the case, as it is in general in the social  sciences, but here, with the subject of population today, there is something  more, in my opinion. Both the scholar and the man of affairs frequently find  themselves faced with real-life dramas and neither can call on a deus ex  machina for an easy solution. I must confess to finding myself in the same  situation as our President Carmen Mirò when she wrote that she did not  claim to put herself in the same category as those who have resolved all  doubts and thus find themselves already firmly entrenched in fixed positions.  I rely on the goodwill of the audience towards someone who, in persistent  fog, strains his eyes to keep on the right road.      1. IDEOLOGY     It is convenient for me to speak first of all briefly about ideology. This  term appeared for the first time at the very end of the eighteenth century in  an academic paper by a French author. But its popularity, and also its usual  meaning both in scientific and everyday language, owes a lot above all,  _____________________________  Reprinted from GENUS (1977), XXXIII (No. 3-4), 1-46      99  </page> <page sequence="2"> BERNARDO COLOMBO  it seems to me, to the use Karl Marx made of it. For Karl Marx, to put it   extremely briefly, ideology equals inverted and distorted thinking: inverted  in so far as you do not realize that it is the reality of the system of  production, on which social relationships are superimposed, which gives  form and substance to the judicial and political “superstructure”, to religion,  art, etc. and not vice versa; distorted because it considers to be universally  valid theories things which are simply temporary camouflage for the  interests of one class.  Today the same term takes on different meanings according to various,  sometimes bizarre contexts, as when you come upon an item in a newspaper  and read that the “ideologist” of a band of thieves has been arrested. George  Sabine, in his classic treatise on the history of political theory, uses it to  denote a body of beliefs, values and convictions which a social group, acting  as a unit, must have: a body which reflects the understanding the group has  of itself, of its surroundings and of the other social groups with which it  interrelates, and which is indeed an essential condition fur the existence of  the group. These beliefs, Sabine goes on to say, range from knowledge into  myth and, until they are no longer discussed, seem to be the “normal” way of  thinking and believing of human beings for those who share them.  For Marx the word “ideology” often takes on a certain pejorative  connotation, serving to expose the intellectual naїvety and bad faith from  which superior and enlightened minds are exempt. Even today this debased  meaning of the word is widespread. You can see ideology as an all  comprehensive view deduced from a limited standpoint which, taken as a  whole, involves a deformation and erroneous description of reality. Worse  still, however, it is not seen as merely a judgment which leads to action in  the social sphere; it also has connotations of intolerance, of aggressiveness  and of a desire to impose which expects to bend everyone to the attainment  of predetermined goals, of a mind attuned only to power and domination like  that of terribles simplificateurs (J. Burckhardt) who know everything and  have an answer on everything for everyone. For extreme attitudes to  violence, including physical violence, a colleague of mine in Padua has used  the expression “sadism of Utopia”.   Nothing is more alien to the animus of the scientist. Even the “truth” he  is searching for is cogent to a certain extent. It limits itself, however, to  exercising its power over the realm of the intellect: it can fascinate or  disappoint, amaze or leave you indifferent, but it does not require your  agreement, it does not fetter free-will, which is left entirely self-determining.  Again nothing is more foreign to the way in which a scientist works. He does  not presume to dominate the minds of others, but on the contrary is  concerned as a very minimum with the plausibility of his theories. In  100    </page> <page sequence="3"> HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES  addition, according to the limitations set by the subject matter severe in the  specific case of the social scientist, who, as it often occurs, can only consider  a post hoc (after which it is easy for superficially minded people to place an  ergo propter hoc) and in the best of cases can make use of only quasi –  experimental plans – he concentrates on an empirical check of these same  theories. Neither is he satisfied with this, if he is a serious scientist, afraid of  being betrayed, so fond is he of his thesis, and adopts along with Karl  Popper the criterion of falsifiability as a check on his mental constructions.  Aware of the fact that with similar checks you cannot construct a universal  law, he remains open to the lesson from an isolated empirical result which  by itself suffices to invalidate the alleged universality of the law. Far from  being dogmatic, he is always open to being refuted.  Yet the creative thinking of the scientist does not originate from a  tabula rasa, like a free product, but – apart from his cultural background and  talent – it is normally directed at and guided by attitudes and cognitive  prescientific actions made on the basis of preferences, preconceptions and  presuppositions. I can illustrate the point by making use of an example which  really applies more to natural sciences, particularly physics, but precisely  because of this it underlines the general significance of the statement: “The  (usually unacknowledged) presuppositions pervading the work of scientists –  Gerard Holton said recently at the 5th International Symposium of the  Smithsonian Institution, commemorating the 500th Anniversary of the birth  of Copernicus – have long included such thematic preconceptions as these:  simplicity, order and symmetry; the primacy of experience versus that of  symbolic formalism; reductionism versus holism; discontinuity versus the  continuum; hierarchical structure versus unity; the animate versus the  inanimate; the use of mechanism versus theological or anthropomorphic  modes of approach”1.   Joseph Schumpeter was thinking along the same lines – and with him  we are in the field of social sciences – when he concluded his report at the  61st Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association by recognizing  the importance of a cognitive prescientific action rising from ideologies, as a  necessary condition for scientific work: “No new departure in any science is  possible without it. Through it we acquire new material for our scientific  endeavors and something to formulate, to defend, to attack. Our stock of  facts and tools grows and rejuvenates itself in the process. And so – though  we proceed slowly because of our ideologies, we might not proceed at all                                                    1 O. GINGEIUCH, Ed., The Nature of Scientific Discovery, Smithsonian Institution Press,  City all Washington, 1975.   101 </page> <page sequence="4"> BERNARDO COLOMBO  without them”2. But one can go further than this. Unlike the significant rôle  played by the “magi” in the intellectual life of the Renaissance, Owen  Gingerich – at the Symposium quoted – has noted how science today is far  more exclusive: “Magic and love, music, poetry, and religion all lie outside  its bounds; but that is not to say that science encompasses all that there is to  know, for such intimations can only alienate some of the most creative  spirits among us”. And in the discussion at the same session, Werner  Heisenberg was emphatic in asserting that “ ... rationalism alone, so far as I  can see, is not sufficient to establish a sound basis of a social community.  This is simply because, when you go to rational arguments, they always lead  from assumptions to results, but you can never prove whether the  assumption is right”.   This succession of quotations leads me to a conclusion. It has been seen  that ideology is the expression of a group. In addition to this, in the social  field in its stress on praxis it encompasses a system of values, a judgment on  what is good and bad, a singling-out and ordering of goals: in brief, it seems  like an act of faith which demands as much from the intellect as from the  will, lives on experience as well as on forecasts and hopes, it is a  Weltanschauung, an insight into the meaning of life and the world. When I  observe that from different positions believers in various religions and  “secularists” appealing to “ humanitarian” considerations, the man in the  street and followers of schools of philosophy, all converge in affirming – and  agreeing on – the existence of basic human rights. I like to see in this a  peephole uncovered and a glimmer caught of that truth towards which  everyone is moving.      2. HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE UNITED NATIONS SYSTEM    To give concrete recognition to human, or fundamental, or essential  rights or however you wish to call them, naturally constitutes a political act.  With this we come down from abstract ideas, from theory, and move  towards observance, putting into practice, guarantee and defense. Usually  such recognition is written into constitutional statutes, but here is certainly  not the time to make comparisons, which, besides, would go well beyond my  powers. Rather, the recent status and the assertion of the idea of basic human  rights in international documents or, better, in some of these which seem  more interesting because of the train of ideas to be dealt with later, deserve a  moment of reflection.                                                    2 J.A. SCHUMPETER, Science and Ideology, “The American Economic Review” Vol. 39, n.  2, 1949.  102    </page> <page sequence="5"> HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES  In this respect it is imperative to quote first the United Nations Charter.  According to article 56, a State which becomes a member of the  Organization explicitly pledges itself, amongst other things, to work for the  universal respect and observance of human rights and of fundamental  liberties for everyone. The reference to these rights and liberties right from  the preamble of the Charter, with successively repeated reminders,  constitutes and important qualitative difference between this and the Statute  of the defunct League of Nations. The Universal Declaration of Human  Rights, adopted and proclaimed on December 10th, 1948 by an almost  unanimous vote – with a few, but significant, abstentions – soon intervened  to provide solid contents for the formal wrappings of the synthetic and  general terms of the Charter. It took 18 years then for the way to be opened  for binding instruments such as the two Covenants adopted on December  16th, 1966, one relating to economic, cultural and social rights, the other  concerning the more traditional civil and political rights. The lodging of the  ratifications to these by member States went forward relatively slowly, so  much so that the goal fixed for their coming into force was only reached  about a year and a half ago. At the moment in which I am writing, we are at  around forty, almost the same countries for both Covenants; there have only  been about thirteen States, however, which have formally agreed to the  optional protocol on civil and political rights which empowers the  “Committee for Human Rights” to receive and examine petitions coming  from individuals too, and not only those presented by a State. Turning a  globe and concerning ourselves only with some of the most important  countries, demographically speaking, without ignoring the others, we realize  that acceptance has still to come from France, Nigeria, Brazil, The United  States, Indonesia, China, India and Egypt and finally my own country, which  did indeed sign the above mentioned document last year but as yet has  ratified nothing.  These omissions give us definite proof of the present limited juridical  scope of such instruments. Moreover, their nature must be seen as not  issuing forth from a universal conception of people as citizens of the world  making the first step towards a united form of political organization. It is a  question of mere interstate agreements. An absolute value is not given in  them to man as such, but only a relative one as the subject of a Sovereign  State. Moreover, the fragility of the forms of guarantee drawn up reveal  another source of weakness for rights, which, in order to be actually  regarded as such in real life, should see their enforcement adequately  ensured. Markedly more effective procedures with this goal in mind are only  in force or codified in international instruments with regional significance: I  am thinking, for example, of the European Convention on Human Rights   103 </page> <page sequence="6"> BERNARDO COLOMBO  which carne into force in 1953, or of the Pact of San José of Costa Rica of  1969 by the Organization of American States.   The basic rights which concern us more closely, apart from the frail  basis of the Pacts mentioned, also find support today at a world level in a  series of declarations, proclamations, recommendations, conventions, plans  of actions, etc., which, however, only come into a legal discourse indirectly,  deprived as they are of any immediate binding effect on member States. It is  true that the repeated reaffirmation of a right in successive documents may  tend to give the same a stronger basis, but it may also be an indication of its  widespread lack of observance: without taking into account at all the fact  that the variants introduced, or abandoned, in successive formulations are  bound to raise more than a few doubts as to their exact meaning.  It must be said in this connection that the political setting in which the  finishing touches are put to these sorts of documents are among the least  suited to producing precise, clear and coherent legal terms. The text drawn  up often emerges as a result of a series of compromises, with each party on  the look-out to ensure that what is said does not ignore its own interests  neither is it prejudicial to them. Such was the case with the world plan of  Bucharest. One delegation demanded reaffirmation of the need for  appropriate legal protection for the family, the basic unit of society: what  harm was there in satisfying them? Another demanded that the objective of  legal and social equality in the treatment of those born within and outside a  marriage be stressed – and so it was. A third was disturbed by the reference  to polygamy which appeared in the draft: it was cut out. And so on and so  forth. Anyone who, unacquainted with this, while making a dispassionate,  delayed examination of the final version aware of the incoherence and  ambiguity in it, must not judge those responsible too severely. Only someone  who realizes the frenetic overlapping of sessions, contacts, amendments and  interventions of those hot August days will fully understand them. No  unexceptionable document, not only from the legal point of view, but looked  at from any point of view whatsoever, could emerge from such a place.  It is easy to draw the conclusion that if, in areas of our most specific  interest, we take into consideration all the indications furnished by various  places and in various forms in the ambit of the United Nations system as a  basis of positive law, we shall come up against grave difficulties.  Uncertainties would arise of the same type that can explain the reluctance of  certain countries to sign Pacts which deal mostly with material already taken  into account in their constitutions, hallowed by lengthy experimentation, on  which legal science has been exercised for a long time and all the  jurisprudence has been built, both responsible for essential work in  clarification, in abstracting first principles and deriving precise inferences.  104    </page> <page sequence="7"> HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES  Another criticism made of those texts is that they reflect Western  experience too much and are not sufficiently flexible to be adapted with the  necessary realism to the pluralism of ideas of different peoples. In this line  of thinking, a specific example which might closely interest us would be the  idea of marriage. However, as a role, there might be seen in them an  excessive insistence on the individual, lavish in the listing of rights and not  well-balanced· by too general a mention of duties. The text of the first clause  of Article 29 of the Declaration of 1948 is typical: “Everyone has duties to  the community in which alone the free and full development of his  personality is possible”. It would seem that at the origin of duties towards  the community lies only the duty of – if not even solely an interest in – free  and full development of one’s own personality. And hasn’t the development  of that of others anything to do with the bases of those duties’? Can one  conceive of healthy and long-lasting communal life as egoistic self- fulfillment?  In addition to the distortion quoted, a further reason for the inadequacy  of those “texts” may be found in verifying that they originate in the meeting  of different speculative ideologies. Indeed it can be maintained that the  existence of at least this common denominator is a happy coincidence, or  even a clear sign of the validity of its contents; and that nothing remains to  be done but to put these into practice. Unfortunately, there is a reason for  believing that the ideological disagreement set aside or smoothed out in  written formulae and principles, re-emerge insidiously just at the moment of  interpretation and judgment of an actual case. Has it not happened to us  more than once, and precisely in matters of demographic importance, that  Supreme Court judges arbitrarily put the sword of Brennus of their own  ideological choices on the scales? If this could happen with interpretative  judgments on the fundamental charters of individual countries, is it not even  more plausible to expect it in relation to laws of external origin?   These and other even more severe criticisms can be made about the  work of the United Nations – and I have dwelt on this as the most relevant –  in the field of human rights. And yet! And yet I think I can accept as my  own the opinion of whoever defined the universal declaration as a “great act  of conscience of the judicial thinking of contemporary man” (V. Frosini). I  sense in it the voice of modern man as opposed to the barbarism of tyrants  who claim to be above the law and to use it as a mere instrument of their  own power. I see in it the enemy of the absolute monarch of yesteryear, of  the “general will” of Rousseau, of the “Me” of today, who wants everything  and everyone to be subservient to its pleasure, of any hypostatized form  which reduces men to slaves. I recognize in it the restoration of the  indispensable ethical basis of law and institutions, the continuation of the   105 </page> <page sequence="8"> BERNARDO COLOMBO  historical function of the Prophetism, the appeal to unwritten laws, or to  natural law delved out in cordibus, rising as the ultimate weaponless defense  of the weak against the most powerful.      3. SOME BASIC PRINCIPLES     In the Organizing Committee’s invitation I thought I saw – perhaps  rashly – not a suggestion simply to survey present-day and emerging  situations but the expectation of a personal effort to deepen knowledge and  make proposals. Setting about this, I know very well I am leaving a road  bristling with obstacles but at least one familiar to us, and venturing along a  route void of reassuring checks. I can no longer remain only a demographer,  nor strictly speaking a scientist in the usual sense. I must in fact make what I  consider to be an ideological choice, in the sense already stated, before  further discussion. With this I present myself in all humility, aware of its  lack of rational constraint, conscious of my fallibility and of the severe limits  imposed on me by my weakness and ignorance. On the other hand, I  maintain that no-one can talk about human rights today, and profess to  measure any political action by their yard-stick, without clarifying the  contents and foundations of the same. I am certain the audience will excuse  me if, on a problem which needs quite a different development, I find myself  forced to be extremely concise and apodictic.  At this point a historico-semantic analysis of the word ‘diritto’3 comes  to my aid – valid for all languages in which the same etymology has given  rise to words with parallel meanings – treated by a colleague specializing in  Roman law, Bernardo Albanese4, ‘Diritto’ comes from directum, gradually  substituting the old ius in the Middle Ages. Directum is from dirigere (and  this from regere) which is quite a special way of giving orders. It is not in  fact, states Albanese, an imperare or an iubere (not connected with ius) “ ...  which refer to the type of command in which those to whom it is addressed  are considered only as almost passive executants in an authoritarian context  or one of force. Rather, in dirigere one finds a different reality: something in  which the aspect of ‘guiding’, ‘directing’, of seeking free and conforming  conduct is predominant. The subjects of ‘diritto’ are assumed, according to  the philosophy implied by the word we are interest in, to be free beings, by  definition, in the fullness of their humanity”. But directum, the noun formed                                                    3 The Italian word ‘diritto’ is used when there is an opportunity of underlining its double  meaning in the sense explained later.  4 B. ALBANESE, Verba tene, res sequentur, “Quaderni del diritto e del processo civile”, di  Salvtore Satta, II, 1969.  106    </page> <page sequence="9"> HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES  from the past participle, draws attention, rather than to the “activity of  guiding and directing”, to the resultant effect, a state of affairs which,  according to the meaning stated of dirigere, is thought of as “human,  harmonious, and free”.   ‘Diritto’ has a double meaning, an objective and a subjective one –  although not in English where right refers only to the latter, whilst law is  used for the former – which are, respectively, that of a legal system, of a  system of norms, etc., or that of the attribution of advantages, and only  advantages, to a subject. In this division, whose origins go back a long way  (and was unthinkable far ius) that “synthetic feeling of ‘diritto’” born out of  the “merging into a single unit of the values contained in dirigere (an  activity of putting into order), in directum (the order resulting from that  activity) and in rectum (the ideal criterion of justice) “has come to die out or  be lost. According to Albanese, a recovery of these values is made possible  if ‘diritto’ is understood as ‘order’: more precisely, as a specific order which  is distinguishable from amongst the various orders conceivable “ ... in so far  as it is necessary and sufficient far the existence” of a society. It is an order  which means not only a command but also “ ... a harmonious disposition of  many entities, which are in order, precisely, when their reciprocal  relationships consist of stable harmonious forms”: ordered relationships,  naturally, set in a society of “free and rational beings”. And Albanese  follows this up by stating “ ... if by ‘diritto’ one means order (in the complex  sense previously pointed out), by a subjective ‘diritto’ one must mean the  order which is a subject’s expectation. And then it would seem to be  incorrect to limit subjective ‘diritto’ to just the attribution of advantages, and  one would also have to include the attribution of disadvantages: duty would  be added to power at the very heart of the subjective ‘diritto’”.   So far goes my colleague. Continuing, the argument becomes, or goes  on being, overtly ontological. Society is made up of rational being, who,  gifted with self-awareness and free will, are aware of their knowledge and  capable of setting goals to achieve, of distinguishing between various ends,  or between different, equally effective means towards the same end, of  arranging these in order of importance, of making choices, of foreseeing and  freely accepting the consequences of their own actions, etc. It also deals with  social beings, to bring back an Aristotelian adjective. Now, I do not attach a  merely existential meaning to this living with others, being with others, to  this Mitsein, but also a teleological and dynamic one. Each and every person  in being with others has the possibility of living his own life more fully, of  reaching self-fulfillment and perfection, of contributing to the analogous  development and expansion of the lives of others. Co-existence also means  co-operation in an interweaving of relationships between individuals which   107 </page> <page sequence="10"> BERNARDO COLOMBO  gives rise to expectations and rights for everyone, as well as imposing  obligations and duties. No-one call only receive without at the same time  giving (even a madman gives to his neighbour: at least it affords him an  opportunity of feeding his own altruism). No-one can be reduced to being  simply someone else’s tool. Things, plants, animals, institutions, are tools  for man, but other human beings are not, otherwise they would lose their  own essential identity as free people. Beyond every individual variation  whether innate, or tied to fortune, social conditions or culture, everyone is on  the same level in these reciprocal relationships, is equal because of their  fundamental natural characteristics, because of their existential purpose. The  symmetry between obligations and rights, and equality are also valid far the  relations between single individuals and society, or between groups of  people: no-one is anyone else’s master no-one can demand only advantages  and shirk his load.  In the “harmonious disposition” already mentioned, co-essential to the  expectation of what is due is the responsibility to commit oneself so that  others can benefit from the right claimed in their own turn. Or, in negative  terms, which I like less and which are not perhaps as suitable: no-one can  cheat another person out of the right he claims far himself, no-one can  deliberately put someone else at a disadvantage in relation to the attainment  of all that he anticipated far himself, no-one can make another pay the  penalty for his own mistakes or misdeeds. Rectum, i.e. what is just, provides  support and serves as a model for this harmonious and stable disposition, in  particular in so far as it concerns distributive justice but also in a higher  sense of apportioning the means a person may have at his disposal in relation  to the fullest development attainable given his potential. Orderly living  together implies again respect far others, and also, or maybe above all,  truthfulness and loyalty, in the absence of which there is less likelihood of  weaving responsible inter-relationships in so far as one does not know how  to foresee the consequences of one’s own actions either for oneself or far  others.  There is certainly nothing new in what I have tried to say. Many others  have said as much far more forcibly and clearly, and then the argument  could flow on in various directions. But time presses and I must leave this  discussion in the air for the moment to take it up again later on as and when  it is necessary. Instead I may add that, in my opinion, such a position is  wholly reconcilable with – if not underlying – classic statements on human  rights, where furthermore at times it is recalled to mind explicitly. I am also  perfectly aware of the fact that my exposition has left certain problems of the  first order unresolved. What, far example, does integration and full  development of one’s own personality mean, and how does one arrive at  108    </page> <page sequence="11"> HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES  this? In trying to reply to such a question, there is obviously scope for the  widest differentiation of ideological positions. But if I am not mistaken what  I have said must still have cleared the ground .of some positions which,  however, have found well-versed supporters recently and not so recently. It  does not seem to me, far example, that I have left ground far supermen and  Leviathans.  Rather there still remains something to be said to delimit the  subcategory of basic human rights (and duties) within the category of rights  (and duties). I do not propose to drawn up a list, arising in part from its link  with historical circumstances and from progressive deductive and inductive  clarification. I shall only try to identify what essential characteristics a right  must have in order to rise to the level of a human right, which puts it as a  prius in relation to every other right, and which indeed makes it such as to  stand above every system of positive norms which cannot be opposed to it: a  right which finds its limits only in rights of the same type, one’s own or  those of other subjects. I maintain that this characteristic can be verified in  rights by the violation of which the subject is wronged in qualities, essential  to him as a human being; for example when an attempt is made to deprive  him of his life, his freedom, or his consciousness, etc. The ontological  discourse is obviously turning up again. To make someone lose  consciousness artificially – other than temporarily and in his own interest as  with an anesthetic – for example by “brain-washing”, is to violate a human  right. To forbid being stupefied with drugs is not. Here duty and  responsibility re-emerge, indissolubly linked to right. If I am a slave I am not  a man in the full sense of the word, being unable to enjoy my liberty: this is  true even when I am a slave to my vices. It seems to me a contradiction in  terms to claim the voluntarily transforming of myself into a non-man –  implying by this losing the possibility of claiming human rights (for  example, that of life) – as a “human right”.  But this is not sufficient. The considerations just dealt with help us to  understand the foundation of those human rights which are sometimes  labeled negative, in the sense of being a freedom from something. If  however, one goes back to the idea put forward previously of a harmonious  and dynamic social fabric in which individuals work together towards the  expansion and perfection of their own personality, one sees another category  of rights being asserted, still qualifying as human, in so far as their  fulfillment gives support to the first and permits their fuller enjoyment. The  defense and exercise of these rights demand not a refraining from  obstruction, or a removing, as with the first, but on the contrary a giving:  they imply active behaviour, definable as positive, from each person and  from the entire body politic and from the State in particular. The eradication   109 </page> <page sequence="12"> BERNARDO COLOMBO  of poverty, the chance to educate one self and to choose a job, equality in the  eyes of the law, the community’s effective participation in political affairs  all come into this category of rights, making human existence richer and  freer, and safeguarding its dignity. It is obvious that historical circumstances  have a bearing on the emergence of rights in this second category, whilst the  first are exempt from this. Moreover, on this ground it is not easy to trace the  boundaries within which real, basic rights exist. I suppose that always dining  on caviar and champagne cannot qualify as a right which is essential to  human dignity, whilst that of not being forced to barter your own freedom –  with anyone, with another individual as well as with State power – for your  daily bread does. But a whole gamut of situations ranges in between and it  seems very hard to single out points of discontinuity.  Besides this, it is also difficult to decide among rights which are  competitive, where the satisfaction of one person involves sacrifices far  others, as it appears clear far the second category indicated of basic rights,  though it also holds good for those of the first, depending a lot on actual  circumstances. Thus positive human rights – in the sense indicated, not in  that of ius in civitate positum – are closely conditioned by history and by  specific situations. The abstract listing of rights which cannot be enforced –  as might be that of immigration today – could seem an empty exercise.  There are already those, indeed, who are critical about the work and  numerous declarations of the whole United Nations system in this direction,  maintaining that they only serve to give rise to expectations which end in  frustration and that they are a fraud. In the last six-year plan put forward at  the session of the UNESCO General Conference held in Nairobi last year it  is clearly written that human rights must not be devalued by a plethora of  texts bearing with them false hopes and hiding the sad truth; that establishing  new norms is not as useful as plumbing the depths of those that already exist,  that a man “situated in time and place” must be protected “before creating  new rights for the benefit of an abstract, non-existent man”.      4. POPULATION POLICIES: INTRODUCTION     Before sifting demographic policies through the principles I have  expounded, it would be useful to survey, if only fleetingly, some of the  actual elements that condition them, and some of the dominant ideologies  amongst these elements. I must leave it at that, though I do so reluctantly,  because even reducing it to an impressionistic sketch would mean  lengthening this already ample discourse beyond an tolerable limits of  endurance. Some points will be lightly touched on from time to time in order  110    </page> <page sequence="13"> HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES  to keep our sensibilities alert for the value systems within which political  action finds itself channeled, flashes of light on a variegated panorama  which, as a whole, we must leave veiled in the background.  In an extremely synthetic form, we may label as population policies  government actions which influence demographic variables. Inaction may  also be included in it, in so far as an agnostic and laisser faire position also  has an effect. On the other hand, absolute non-interference on any  demographic parameter whatsoever is unknown: one need only think how  common is interference with international migration movements in the form  of detailed rules and regulations. I have talked about governments, as is the  custom, even though one should refer to the whole public sector, and  particularly to the State, divided into its executive, legislative and judicial  functions. Neither should it be forgotten that the political community as a  whole – of which the State is only a part and an instrument –, groups as well  as individual, all exercise an influence over demographic events: and here I  am not referring to the fact that such events originate from a myriad of  isolated decisions of individuals families and limited bodies but to private  actions directing or conditioning other people’s decisions, and with this  demographic phenomena in general. The choice of where to locate industrial  investment, illegal recruitment of foreign labour, scientific discoveries about  mechanisms connected with reproduction, messages on the pages of a daily  newspaper aiming at manipulating public opinion are some of the countless  examples which could be put  forward in this connection.  There are a good many variables on which political intervention, in the  above mentioned sense of the word, can have a bearing: total size of the  population, the form and rhythm of its dynamics in absolute or relative  terms, the components of the same also as absolute values or as rates; and  again, the various characteristics of the population, such as its age and sex  structure, its social makeup, its territorial distribution, its relations with the  outside world. Soviet authors would include amongst these social mobility,  which often goes together with territorial mobility, as does mobility between  sectors of economic activity and between firms.  The above-mentioned public actions taken as a whole may or may not  form part of a policy which has been explicitly laid down and deliberated on;  they are characterised by the various degrees to which power is involved, as  abstract econometric exercise, occasional event, continuous practice,  forming part of a wider programme, and backed by proper organizing  support; they can be understood as simply a collection of data, but one which  is indispensable and valuable, ranging from the spreading of information,  and going as far as evaluating procedures of the results obtained by applying  specific plans of action for predetermined objectives, with feed-back for later   111 </page> <page sequence="14"> BERNARDO COLOMBO  developments. They include direct action, such as immigration restrictions,  and other forms which have a mediating influence, such as the legislation on  contraception, or indirect action, as with the regulations on landownership,  inheritance, housing policy, jobs for women, and so on.  Demographic policy may spring from the weight brought to bear by  small pressure groups. Apart from the case when these are merely the  expression of egoistic and special interests, l maintain that this is still a risk  even when enlightened élites are behind it. It in fact impinges on  fundamental moments in the life of each person. An essential condition for  the success of demographic policy is that it be founded on the most fully  thought out, convinced, responsible general consensus. After all, the  achievement of the· desired results often requires behaviour which is correct  and to the purpose from the people involved, and individual self-control,  which the State alone is hardly in a position to promote. There are too many  delicate decisions to take and a balance to achieve between conflicting  interests – between the young and old, the present and future generations,  between different parts of the social body – for a government to be allowed  to neglect the widest possible participation in dealing with them.  Demographic policies are not pursued for their own sake, but for more  general ends which the State, as an instrument at the service of single  individuals as well as of society as a whole, proposes to achieve with the  general welfare of the community in mind, which is the basis for, and  legitimization of, its intervention. In its action, the State can act simply as a  catalyst for voluntary, individual decisions or it can resort to its powers of  coercion: in each case a choice of means must be made, which necessarily  originates in a value system and by itself constitutes a moral decision in  addition to a juridical fact. It is here, in the ambit of how to determine ends  and the ways to attain them, that the field opens up for the various ideologies  and the problem of their relation to human rights is set.  In the light of the principles set out, and moving on to an evaluation of  the reality emerging in the area of demographic policies, I am omitting some  themes which could be proposed for a non-too-distant future: I rely on the  perspicacity of colleagues like Jean Bourgeois-Pichat, in their “existential”  and “essential” lives, for arguments like the predetermination of sex at  conception, foetus transplants, or alchemies of biological engineering. I am  stopping instead on some points which I claim are more worthy of reflection  today, in various sectors and from different angles.           112    </page> <page sequence="15"> HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES  5. INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION     I shall begin my examination starting off with a field in which firm  political action is the order of the day and the determining factor: I am  referring to international migration on which precisely, in one form or  another and for various aims, every State intervenes with carefully- considered laws. The world is divided into States which are jealous of their  own sovereignty and this is a fact one must he resigned to, even if one can  recognize in it a prime source of many inequalities in existence today. It may  be that later generations will condemn present-day reality as immoral and  scandalous, as we may do today in relation to past slave régimes: let us hope  that, in judging us on such a subject, they will be understanding and  indulgent in recognizing our present intellectual and emotional difficulties.  The right to emigrate – from one’s own or any other country – as the  expression of the fundamental right for everybody to find the most suitable  ways to develop his own potential fully, is recognized in international  documents and also in constitutional charters. There is silence, however, on  the right to immigrate and this is quite understandable: a State has first the  duty, and consequently the right, to work for the common good of the  community. If, on the other hand, one accepts the principle of everyone’s  joint responsibility for everybody’s future, it follows that every State also  has a duty of being sensitive to the needs of others, and of meeting them  even by welcoming immigrants if this can help without wreaking serious  damage on the domestic economic, social and political order. Paying  attention only to one’s on standard of living, ignoring circumstances in  which in other countries the basic necessities are not taken care of, whilst  one could have lent a hand, sounds like a violation of human rights.  Having said this, it should also be added that in present-day  circumstances it would be difficult to consider emigration as a realistic  solution to pressure and population growth if this involves broad masses  of the population. It is not enough, in fact, to move people. It is also  necessary that tension does not build up, that a gradual assimilation takes  place, that stable and living communities be formed. One may ask the  host society to respect, for example, the culture and language of new- arrivals, to accept for themselves too an evolution and enrichment in a  multi-cultural sense. One cannot impose on a host country organized  minorities who remain substantially and permanently foreign. There  must be limits – in the immigrants own interests too – on how many  people can be integrated into a different community within a given space  of time. Moreover this process needs capital which, as an alternative  solution, might be more usefully invested in the countries of origin to   113 </page> <page sequence="16"> BERNARDO COLOMBO  stimulate economic development suitable for keeping migrants on the  spot. Even this solution has its drawbacks, surrounded as it is by a  climate of fear and suspicion against foreign investment in the home  country.  As examples of directions in which, compared with previous  practices, there appear to be greater respect for human dignity, one may  put forward the latest regulations on priorities in issuing immigration  visas adopted by the United States and Australia: the former abandoned  the rigid system of quotas by country and has given priority to uniting  families, the latter has changed from an ethnic criterion to one of  professional qualifications. On the other hand, serious problems on the  grounds of human rights are posed by not a few massive irregular  immigrations, above all the fact that those entering illegally easily find  themselves without any defend against economic exploitation on the part  of unscrupulous employers.  On this subject, each case has its own particular history and one  cannot propose·a uniform solution. But it seems permissible to hope, as a  general principle, that the State concerned would assume an attitude at  once flexible and clear, making assimilation easier for those already  resident for some time and promoting the reunification of families, but at  the same time penalizing those who promote illegal trafficking, or who  speculate on it.  On migration of a temporary nature for job motives, Massimo Livi  Bacci has written some enlightening material, with particular reference to  Western Europe5. In this case, rather than migrations one might talk  about the movement of manpower and Livi Bacci has made it clear that,  in his opinion, as such it answers only contingent and superficial  interests, not the real basic needs of the countries of origin or of  destination, and of the workers themselves. For the former, it concerns  lessening employment pressures and crediting remittances against a balance  of payments deficit. For the latter, there is the advantage of finding adaptable  and replaceable personnel at one’s disposition whom one can often entrust  with duties the indigenous population does not like. A limited contract, one  year at the most, is a convenient instrument in so far as it is of sufficient  length to make the job productive and at the same time ensures plenty of  elasticity. The migrants, on their side, find work more easily and earn more  than at home. And they save – how they save! – accepting separation from  their families, segregated in ghettoes, with very little contact with the local                                                    5 M. LIVI BACCI, Report on the Demographic and Social Pattern of migrants in Europe,  Especially with Regard to International Migrations. Part I: The Countries of Emigration,  Council of Europe, 2nd European Population Conference, Strasbourg 1971.  114    </page> <page sequence="17"> HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES  people, without any stimulus to learn the language, deprived, as a rule, of the  possibility of making any real progress in their professional training. They  end up by returning unprepared to use their accumulated savings  productively and not laying down a solid base either for their own future or  for the development of their country. As for those who have been their hosts,  the choice of basing their own expansion on cheap foreign labour rather than  investing in their own demographic development is not one which, in the  long run, augurs a rosy future.  Livi Bacci is right in writing that everyone must know that there is a  price to pay to improve the situation. And this is not only a matter of  economic costs, because break-ups and separations are brought about which  go well beyond economics and mere legal factors only, involving  psychological aspects and mores. Turning one’s attention to a list of possible  remedies to some of the most obvious inadequacies, the following might he  mentioned: l) facilitating the reuniting of families, above all by adequately  facing the problem of housing; 2) ensuring complete equality with the  indigenous population on the level of social and economic rights with the  possibility of changing jobs when this does not evidently damage local  labour; 3) taking care of the professional training, and level of instruction in  general, at least of the young; 4) extending the length of contracts; 5)  allowing foreign workers to participate in the organization of forms of  assistance, and leisure time occupations; etc.  Leaving aside questions like the right of asylum, expulsion, the fate of  refugees and the like which take up plenty of space in international  documents, a final point to be touched on in the field of international  migrations is that of the “brain drail”, which concerns many different  developing countries. One certainly cannot question the right to freedom of  movement of any category of people whatsoever, unless, perhaps, restriction  is imposed for their own and greater good. But it is not only this aspect  which must be kept in mind. If one accepts the principle stated above that  every right is linked to a corresponding duty, it seems permissible to expect  from someone who sees a way open to improve his own position greater  concern for the needs of others, particularly his fellow countrymen who,  being closest to him, have perhaps also made the most sacrifices for him, and  in any case can be more easily understood and helped. I would stress this  recall to a sense of responsibility on the part of every citizen, and  particularly those most gifted, in relation to the nation’s ideals. Even here, it  is not so much a question of juridical limitations, which can easily be  avoided, as of the education of personality. To this end, along with suitable  economic incentives, may go shrewd internal policies on the level of  organizing instruction and research centers, if necessary maintained by   115 </page> <page sequence="18"> BERNARDO COLOMBO  international co-operation, which would give rise to possibilities and  prospects on the spot – or within a region – thus drying up at source one of  the main reasons for the flow.      6. INTERNAL MIGRATION    In the various regions a State is divided into, the internal migratory  waves stand out quite often in greater relief, as regards the dynamics of a  population and its structure, than those of births and deaths, whether for  numerical consistency, or for their selective character, or finally for changes  with time and the characteristic difficulty in forecasting which creates the  greatest obstacles for those who try to calculate demographic projections for  restricted areas. Local problems which have their origin in internal  migrations are often more serious than those caused by natural increase.  Phenomena such as urban congestion, heterogeneity and tensions between  groups of citizens, depopulation and impoverishment of rural zones, are all  as a rule connected with migration and with the ways in which it occurs,  more than with the total amount of population. Despite this, the ample  literature on demographic policies pays relatively little attention to the  distribution or population by area which is hardly ever the only, and rarely  even the principal, object of political action. On the other hand the aims  concerning a population’s territorial settlement are barely distinguishable  from those more general ones of the country’s overall economic and social  development, in every place and under every régime.  Freedom of movement and choice of place of residence, closely linked  with the concrete exercise of other rights, are explicitly recognized as basic  rights. At an individual and family level it is nothing but the expression of a  search for better conditions to realize one’s own potential, in terms of greater  well-being, of more secure and varied professional options, of more  satisfactory social services, etc. Moreover, spatial mobility is generally an  indispensable condition for progress, for structural change and for  modernization at a macro-social level. But these transfers also go hand in  hand with costs of various types, sometimes to the extent of nullifying the  looked-for benefits completely and harming whole social groups. Women  and children may come up against much greater difficulty in adapting to the  new environment than the working head of the family who is  psychologically more prepared for the change. Changes of residence  resulting from erroneous information and expectations, rather than from real  opportunities for social evolution may turn into merely decanting poverty  and deprivation territorially. Urban concentration may give rise not only to  116    </page> <page sequence="19"> HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES  environmental but also to spiritual pollution. The disproportionate weighting  given as a result of political decisions to certain lots of citizens, particularly  the middle class and the unionized working class, is at the bottom of  seriously disproportionate public investment, diverted, for example, to give  preference to accelerated expansion in the educational sectors and types of  jobs which suit these classes better, with the resultant strengthening of the  urban pull, of ill-fated influxes, of fringe poverty. The attitude of  governments, who have not the strength to set themselves up as impartial  judges, emerges as ambiguous and inconsistent, also because of the objective  difficulty of reconciling impulses towards modernizations and the necessity  of keeping people tied to the fields.  The principle of respect for freedom of movement excludes any  recourse to coercing individuals, except in cases of greater necessities,  sanctioned by law, f.i. in rare emergencies or when the principle is in  conflict with universal rights; also clearly inadmissible is forcing whole  communities to move, which at times goes to the extremes of genocide.  Acceptable or beneficial are, on the other hand, instruments (economic,  social, juridical) working directly or indirectly, when used to channel  legitimate personal aspirations in the direction of defending freedom for  everybody or promoting greater general welfare: rules for the location of  economic enterprises or residential projects; administrative decentralization  and spreading social services to rural zones; creating development centres  and new towns; incentives to send labour force and professional skills to  areas in which there are natural resources to be exploited; services for prior  information and then guidance for those moving from the land to urban  centres; etc. There are many plans in hand, but there are also many failures  in an area in which there is still so much to learn. We demographers could be  of assistance to politicians by stimulating their imaginations in anticipating  the wide range of immediate and long-term consequences of their  intervention as far as population is concerned. We can join others in  stressing the ever more vital importance of space, in scotching the  scandalous operation of real estate speculators who no longer even earn the  merit of running risks, in making it easier to recover for the benefit of all the  wind full profits which are reaped because of events, which our own work  will have helped to predict with ever greater precision.  But, even in this field, public action is certainly not enough. Certain  barriers erected through prejudice, such as on account of the color of one’s  skin, religion, or other reasons fiercely resist any control by legal or  administrative regulations. They will only fall when respect for the dignity  of human beings and for their basic rights has firmly taken root in  everybody’s conscience.   117 </page> <page sequence="20"> BERNARDO COLOMBO  7. MORTALITY    “Whatsoever house I enter, there will I go for the benefit of the sick” ,  says the doctor taking the traditional Hippocratic oath dedicating himself in  his vocation to bringing the light of hope into the sad, grey room of the  suffering, and his acts are branded with nobility from the sacredness of life  which they have in their care. The right to life and, as a natural corollary, to  the highest level attainable of physical and mental health, is fundamental and  the same for everybody, as is the dominion held over everybody by death’s  impartial majesty. We would be naїve, misinformed and blindly optimistic if  we maintained that it is like this in real life, that this right finds equal respect  and fulfillment everywhere and for everyone.  I am not referring to patent diversities between countries, but to less  comprehensible and justifiable ones existing inside a single State, for  example between those who live in towns and those inhabiting rural areas. I  have not got in mind so much the greater ease, in comparison with the poor  and weak, enjoyed by the powerful and rich in securing the most expensive  health facilities and the most effective treatment. I am thinking rather of the  discrimination which is simply rooted in ignorance. It makes one depressed  to note how often failure to resort to services which nevertheless exist, or  failure to use them in the best possible way, comes from cultural  backwardness, from insufficient information, from inability to stir oneself  and make use of one’s actual rights. One cannot meet such personal  shortcomings by greater financial expenditure or more precise bureaucratic  regulations of medical health services, but rather by extending general  education, and by the training of every category of medical staff to full  respect for the dignity of every person: precisely in the spirit of that oath I  quoted. It is a good opportunity to add that one must appeal to the same  sense of moral conscience and self-discipline – in this case, of researchers –,  rather than to public control (surely necessary and cautiously administered),  for the respect of rights and fundamental dignity in the case of experiments  on man: one knows how often research is centered on subjects least able to  defend themselves, institutionalized patients, poor, ignorant people, children,  fetuses removed alive by induced abortions, and inhabitants of  underdeveloped countries.  The dynamics of mortality is at the origin of much present-day  preoccupation with population trends: despite this, its control is more the  subject of social policy than demographic policy. The direction of  intervention, in fact, can only be one-way and its effect, taken as a whole,  can work only in one direction. The demographic relevance of the various  forms of intervention has not been studied much, and demographic impacts  118    </page> <page sequence="21"> HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES  do not constitute a basic motive for steps taken to affect mortality even in the  case of infant mortality, whose decline is considered by some the  determining factor for controlling fertility. The commitment to fight disease  and death increasingly more effectively is self-evident, but one does not  stick to considerations of demographic dynamics in establishing, for  example, the allocation of resources for such a purpose and expenditure  aimed at making the days of the living more and more happy – however few  or many they may be. Neither are we guided by such considerations when  pharaonic installations are put up for high-level specialization while vast  health sectors are left in penury, paying for the privilege and prestige of a  few with the sacrifice of many; nor, on the contrary, when goals of equity  are pursued to ensure the change of adequate treatment for all categories,  regardless of financial possibilities, age, sex, etc. In conclusion one may say  that the degree to which justice and human rights are honored by a society in  this area depends on the measure to which treatment is ensured for the most  under-privileged of its members.      8. MARRIAGE     The expression “demographic policy” has been used also in a narrow  sense to indicate a “policy intended to act on the spontaneous tendencies of  fecundity”. Going into this specific area now, we may first remind ourselves  of the classic Malthusian remedy for the fatal course on which demographic  evolution was bound, that of moral restraint which meant at least delaying  marriage until one was sure of being able to maintain a family. Over the  centuries we know of various examples of interference with marriage  customs by political authority with the aim of influencing the demographic  dynamics of populations or particular classes. In this post-war period, little  attention has been paid to such instruments of demographic policies until  recent years. They have been the years waiting for the “ideal” contraceptive  which would solve all questions: why set off on a road bristling with  obstacles like that of modifying deep-rooted marriage customs reinforced by  social circumstances and life philosophies, running the risk of appearing to  be dictators of freedom, when the perfect contraceptive would clear up all  worries? Were there not perhaps concrete examples of legislative reform  which remained a dead letter? On the other hand, what result could a limited  delay of marriage have when so much fertile time still remained in which,  making up for lost years by increased fecundity, it was still possible to  ensure the same final descent?  Before examining some more recent tendencies in this connection, it is   119 </page> <page sequence="22"> BERNARDO COLOMBO  a good opportunity to stop and make some remarks on the scope of human  rights on this subject. In this connection, comparing it with classic  formulations, the 1948 Declaration has something new, subsequently  confirmed in the 1966 Pact on civil and political rights: to be precise, the  acknowledgement that everyone, of legal marriage age, has the right to  marry and start a family, linked to the requirement of the intending spouses  full and free consent and of their equal rights during marriage and until its  dissolution. Along with the attestation of this right; goes the reassertion of  the concept of the family as the natural and basic element of society, and as  such having the right to the protection by society itself and by the State. By  this, explicit recognition is given to the social function fulfilled and to the  social status assumed by the spouses and by all members of the family, and  similarly to the consequent duties and rights. Marriage is not the outcome of  a whim, nor a private act, but a solemn undertaking made in front of the  whole community: the necessary freedom of consent in taking it on is a  condition and, at the same time, an expression of personal responsibility for  the consequent duties, for the fulfillment of which one has the right to  special attention and care on the part of the social body. The marriage  institution is a complex reality of people, rights and obligations: for example,  the duties of a couple to each other, towards their children and vice versa,  and of all of them to the community in which they live. The multiplicity and  physical and psychic complementarity of people, the variety of  interrelationships experienced in a state in which affection, authority,  freedom, natural competition, patient tolerance, wider knowledge, spirit of  sacrifice, unity despite diversity, all exist together, and make the family  unequalled and irreplaceable as a socializing element. It is firmly rooted in  the couple’s loyalty to their original undertaking, continually born out in –  and protected by – the fidelity and stability of their relationship, which is an  essential condition for bringing up and educating their offspring, the future  adult members of society, and so providing the principal basis of the right to  special protection from the last.  Set against the principles expounded here, one finds the greatest  diversity in actual examples and concrete interpretations of marriage and the  family, let alone in the status of the people involved. From marriage in the  Confucian tradition whereby, through the union of two people, one sees that  of two families and the start of a new line of descendance across the  centuries, and as such constitutes the object of inter-family agreements, to  marriage considered as the outlet of romantic love, from the Jewish – Yahwist and Christian conception of the couple, to that expressed in Islamic  laws, the distances are enormous. The person who, going back to the basic  principle enunciated at the beginning of this report, considers he ought to  120    </page> <page sequence="23"> HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES  point out lack of respect for fundamental rights in the case where marital  unions are arranged by relations, could well declare, in accordance with the  same principles, violations of equal rights among those peoples in which one  marriage out of two these days disintegrates, calmly disregarding the  children’s interests. The married state is something quite other than a union,  formalized as much as one wants, in which each person seeks gratification  and self-realization: it is a disinterested, faithful, constant dedication and  giving of oneself to another, of oneself to all the other components of the  family, and in this lies its prime social function.  Incentives to marriage introduced as an indirect instrument to encourage  greater overall births – but here too one must repeat that social and  demographic purposes are often barely distinguishable – are in practice in  various forms in several countries. Those that are economic – non refundable  subsidies, loans on favorable terms, aid with housing, etc. – can be  interpreted as solidarity on the part of the community at a critical moment in  family life. Others, however, like exclusive career privileges, or for  obtaining a given job, in favour of those who are married, seem to me to be a  jarring offence against freedom of choice for people having different  vocations.  In recent years the reverse direction has become increasingly  fashionable, re-echoing the Malthusian proposal previously quoted. It began  by pointing out that, even if the number of children remains the same, a  higher average age at marriage would raise the average age at childbirth and  thus permit the lengthening of generations. The accent was then put on the  fact that, by delaying a woman’s start to married life, greater time is left to  increase her own education and eventually prove herself in extra-domestic  activity, thus allowing her to gain a maturity and state of mind that would  have an influence both on her personal attitude and on her relations with her  spouse concerning decisions to be made relating to offspring. Again, it was  pointed out that raising the minimum legal marriage age could at the very  least have a psychological effect even in States where the widespread  absence of registration of births jeopardized the enforcement of the law.  Finally, ever increasing notice has been given, as an example to be held up,  to the signs coming from the People’s Republic of China, on methods  followed there and on the results obtained in this field.  In fact, in numerous countries the prescribed legal age as been raised for  both sexes; although such innovations have been accompanied at times by a  lowering of the age below which parental consent is necessary. Various  incentives have also been adopted or studied to increase the age at marriage,  above all in the form of economic assistance provided the bride – or both  partners – is over a set age. There has not been sufficient experimentation to   121 </page> <page sequence="24"> BERNARDO COLOMBO  give a clear answer as to the practical effectiveness of these measures,  whether as to distribution of marriages by age, or their relative frequency, or  numbers of offspring.  It must not be forgotten that the norm is not the same as actual practice,  and that to influence mores it is necessary to resort to a vast programme  involving a multiplicity of concrete causes which shape prevalent practice.  But interventions of this sort, even if seeming suitable, can be interpreted  badly and thus result in high individual and social psychological costs. This  is particularly so with women: pushing them to marrying later, or giving up  marriage, without offering them valid alternatives, can mean condemning  them for years, or for all their lives, to a subordinate position. Similarly, in  certain industrialized countries, early marriage by the young, who continue  to lean on their parents for financial support, has become a way of staying  for years in a state of immaturity verging on the infantile.  Apart from political action, marriage has always been subject to social  control. Both social control and political action can alter in the face of new  circumstances. Today attention is being paid to the modification of marriage  patterns as a means of checking fertility as a whole. It seems to me that, if  one wants to take this road, it should not be thought of simply as a technical  instrument to achieve the desired effect, but rather should be gone along as a  path to be followed in order to increase and make the most of the sense of  responsibility with which one must prepare for marriage. Only by acquiring  such a responsible maturity in judgment and behaviour first, will it be  strengthened and demonstrated in the course of married life as married life  itself requires, above all in a well thought out and careful decision as to how  many children to have. It is difficult to say how much political action and  laws can achieve by themselves in this task of the inner education of young  people:I think that they are certainly not sufficient alone. They may not be  even the principal agents in such education. They must necessarily be  accompanied by the conscious effort of everybody in society, beginning with  parents, who clearly have both a rôle and an opportunity.      9. FERTILITY    It is rarely possible for a State to be able to control international  migratory waves to obtain appreciable results in regulating the whole of its  own demographic evolution in the desired directions. As a rule, for such an  aim – discounting the relative inflexibility of mortality as a means of control  – only fertility can be considered. As regards the influence which  intervention on marriage customs may have on it, this has already been  122    </page> <page sequence="25"> HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES  discussed. We shall now move on to another subject, with the immediate  warning that on this terrain contrasts of an ideological origin more easily  come to light, as one will be able to verify even if only through fleeting  indications.  In this connection, an interpolation is permissible on the meaning of  ideological choices in the social field. From so much that has been said we  know that ideology too often means an instrument of struggle, of power  conquest and of prevarication. We also know that, in the sense previously  defined it can constitute a seed of understanding about things in life and the  world, and bring us nearer to truth. If we want to compare various ideologies  in order to arrange them in order of importance, in the first case – for those  who want to use them like this – the only yardstick to evaluate them  becomes that of success. Advancement in knowledge, uplifting of minds,  etc., do not count for those who think only of crushing others. In the second,  a comparison can be made with a serene and open mind: for example, by a  dispassionate examination of the meaning of the empirical situation from  which an ideology stems and in which it believes to find its confirmation, to  evaluate the reliability of the agreement between facts and ideas; by an  internal criticism of the coherence and completeness of basic assumptions,  and of deductions deriving from them; by a comparison between the latter  and the consequences to which putting choices inspired by fundamental  ideas into practice leads: by continual vigilance, from the start to the arrival  point, within the inner forum of one’s own moral conscience. No relativism,  therefore, if one does not want to remove completely from ideology all  power to stimulate intuition, knowledge and progress. Neither any resort to a  clash in affirming the ‘best’, which it is only possible to attain in a really  human sense by an effort to understand the reasons of others, of tolerance,  persuasion and testimony.  This said, I think it opportune to enunciate first some principles, which  will be of use to me later on, by reflecting on a text recently proposed within  the system of the United Nations. I am referring to par. 14, f) of the World  Population Plan of Action approved in Bucharest, which states: “All couples  and individuals have the basic right to decide freely and responsibly the  number and spacing of their children and to have the information, education  and means to do so; the responsibility of couples and individuals in the  exercise of this right takes into account the needs of their living and future  children, and their responsibility, towards the community”.  Let us analyse this statement. The hendiadys which associates freedom  and responsibility appears for the first time in Resolution XVIII and with a  slight variation in the Proclamation, both approved in Teheran in 1968 on the  occasion of the International Conference on Human Rights, in their turn   123 </page> <page sequence="26"> BERNARDO COLOMBO  improving on and incorporating previous texts. But responsibility and  freedom are complex concepts which require to be deepened at least with the  following considerations in mind. I cannot be responsible unless in a context  of freedom (otherwise it would be determinism), even if limited (only God  can have an absolute one), nonetheless allowing a real multiplicity of  attainable alternatives; in a condition in which I am actually able to choose  with reference to a value, to a good regarding which my choice has meaning,  and the knowledge and desiring of which I am at the very least able to work  towards. Responsible action is not merely accidental, but is always directed  towards something; as such, it implies the possibility, or rather the  requirement, of being judged and, consistently, corrected and punished. But,  I repeat, in order for it to be judged and imputable my action must be free, in  a situation which contains both a psychological dimension and immunity  from external coercion. That is, one finds once again the necessary existence  of acceptable options, the knowledge of these and of the consequences of  choices taken as a result, the availability of suitable means towards the goals  wished for, or which duty requires, the aptitude for evaluating and ordering  the alternatives, to make rational decisions about them, to put them into  practice.  Before going back to the above-mentioned text, let us clear up a point  connected to the theme. I have seen it written that one does not find the  fundamental right to procreate confirmed in the documents of the United  Nations. The observation seems to me to be out of place. Perhaps one  does not read in them that everyone has the right, not only to marry, but  also to start a family? What does one want more explicit than that? When  the right to live is affirmed, that of breathing is not added. It has been  written also that the Teheran declarations allow parents to have children  as and when they like. This, too, I maintain, is inexact. The principle of  freedom of choice for parents against external interference of any kind  whatsoever is certainly established in them. But at the same time it is  confirmed that the fundamental right refers to a responsible choice, and  not just any one. That means it refers to a choice by which, in exercising  the right, one assumes responsibility for the fulfilment of analogous or  other expectations of other people in regard to the same or other  fundamental rights, which one must respect and defend in the carrying  out of one’s own. In the second clause of the paragraph quoted from  Bucharest; an example of these rights of other people is indeed provided,  the neglecting of which – in exercising one’s own – could amount to an  abuse.  The Bucharest text also talks about the right to adequate information  and instruction “on such questions” (unfortunate wording which leaves  124    </page> <page sequence="27"> HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES  uncertain which precise questions it is referring to). If I have grasped the  meaning of the phrase correctly, it seems to me the case to add that, apart  from a right, it also relates to an opportunity: even if the enlightening of  minds is not sufficient in itself, it nevertheless is still a major way to  eliminate or minimise abuses. Aiming to get round these by compulsorily  setting limits which cannot be crossed to decisions which, in order to be  “human”, must be freely taken and for which responsibility must be  accepted, is to strike at the roots of an essential attribute of people and is  to treat them like battery hens.  Again, the text in question mentions the right to benefit from  “adequate services”, recalling much the same thing put forward for the  first time – it seems to me – in a document originating from within the  United Nations system in art. 22, b) of the Declaration on Social Progress  and Development of 1969. In my opinion, a deduction from the basic  concept of autonomously responsible choice is introduced here which  commits the sin of partiality. In it, in essence, the particular right to be  helped in avoiding the so-called “unwanted” or “undesired” births is  underlined (I shall not stop for semantic analysis of such fleeting  concepts). No-one will deny that ignorance or lack of services constitute  formidable obstacles to the exercising of freedom of choice as to the  number and spacing of children. And the desperate man who submits to  sterilization through urgent need of the money given as an incentive, or  married couples who give up having another child in order not to further  complicate relations with another family with whom – through housing  scarcity – they are forced to share a flat are they free, or rather are their  essential rights not spurned? The text approved at Bucharest sins by  omission, saying nothing about the right to be able to have desired and  wanted children and which one must consciously renounce through  circumstances beyond one’s own control, through social injustice, or other’s  mistakes or misdeeds. The exercise of responsibility cannot be seen one- sidedly: otherwise, the right to procreate is practically ignored for those who  live in poverty through no fault of their own. We shall come back to this  point of fundamental importance.  Finally, by those entitled to the fundamental right under discussion is  meant “every couple and every individual”. Let us remember the kind of  justification brought into the conference room in support of the principle of  attributing the right to individuals as well as to couples. There are – it was  said – women who want to have a child, but who do not wish to tie  themselves up with marriage. But can we speak of an essential human right  in the context of a desire of this sort? To me it does not seem so, and I shall  explain why. A child is not a doll which one buys at a supermarket. It is a   125 </page> <page sequence="28"> BERNARDO COLOMBO  human being and precisely as such has its own fundamental rights, like that,  for example, of not starting off, in all innocence, in an unfavorable position  because of others, and least of all because of its mother. For its normal  development, the newly-born child has a right to have parents, not just a  mother. It has the right as a person not to feel different from others, all its  life, because of a condition forced on it at birth. But there is also the father.  The fact that a man lends himself to such a solution, albeit voluntarily, or  actually with gratitude because – for example – he receives a reward, is  irrelevant to the conclusions arrived at in judging the action itself, which is  to treat another human being as a mere instrument for one’s own ends. One  cannot talk about human rights when exercising them automatically violates  the human rights of others.  Let us now turn our attention to the married couple (or even, within its  own limitations, to a couple tied together only by mutual consent through  reciprocal relationships of affection and trust. As for the solipsistic practice  of two people who are selfishly seeking only their own pleasure, it is not the  case to call into question the category of fundamental rights). It has been  claimed that, in the case of a couple’s conflicting aspirations and opinions,  the final decision and responsibility for bringing children into the world, and  when to do so, is up to the woman. In the most complete text I have seen on  the subject6 three reasons are given: 1) the principle whereby no-one has the  right to exploit the body and labours of another person without his or her  consent; 2) the fact that pregnancy and childbirth may severely endanger a  woman’s health, and even her life; 3) the circumstance that, in the eyes of  the family, the society and the mother herself, a woman usually has the  greater responsibility for nurturing, protecting and caring for young children.  Now let us consider the two possibilities. Either it is the wife who wants to  have a child, whilst the husband hesitates, or vice versa. In the former case,  the husband may have good reasons for not wanting a child. It is not only  biological facts, or looking after the new-born child that is involved. There is  also the responsibility to be taken on of continuing to maintain and educate  the child until of age, and ensuring the whole family is supported in certain  conditions; there may also be a particular psychological component. With a  couple it is not necessarily the woman who constitutes the most fragile and  vulnerable point in a complex picture of facts, evaluations and previsions.  Apart from this, to claim that the husband should follow his wife’s own  wishes, when he responsibly leans in a different direction, would mean  forcing him to be simply an instrument. After so many, well-deserved                                                    6 UNITED NATIONS, “Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Status of Women and  Family Planning: Report of the Special Rapporteur Appointed by the Economic and Social  Council under Resolution 1326 (XLIV)”, New York, 1975.  126    </page> <page sequence="29"> HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES  protests against considering a woman merely an object, do we want to make  exactly the same mistake in reverse?  The other possibility corresponds perfectly to the first. In neither can  one identify an abstract and privileged basic right for one partner rather than  the other, who would otherwise be reduced to purely the function of an  instrument, liable to domination. In an actual situation, possible conflicts  must always be examined and settled in the light of equity, that is of justice  in a concrete case. The only actual fundamental right which exists for a  responsibly independent decision is the indivisible one of the couple. Having  forgotten this has made not possible to point out, in the second part of the  paragraph, that each partner, in consciously deciding to have a child, must  put first whatever is good for the other, and for both of them, to the  advantage of all the family.  Moving on to examine concrete forms of political intervention as far as  fertility is concerned, the themes with which one could begin a discussion  crowd in: as it is impossible to treat them systematically, I shall choose some  typical examples on this subject.  A distinction, in connection with government intervention, is frequently  made between those who stay within the limits of so-called family planning  and those who cross them and go beyond family planning, as usually said in  the literature on the subject in English. It is a distinction I appreciate as a  classifying criterion from various points of view, but which I like less when I  see with it activities being passed off as means for a policy to control  demographic development, which should not, strictly speaking, figure as  such. Let me make myself clear. If birth control, in the terms laid down, is an  essential right-duty, safeguarding it and making its practical application  easier are intrinsic values, which must be pursued as such, to the best of  actual possibilities, in every time and place, independently of other different  kinds of objectives, and this as much in the public sector as in the private  one. Between the personal goal a couple aims at in marriage and the  particular social aim of the latter lies a delicate problem of balance, which  changes according to circumstances, to be solved by the couple’s  enlightened conscience. A similarly difficult problem of balance exists  between the results of marital decisions and the demands of the social body  which it is up to the politician to resolve by arranging everything into a  harmonious whole. But such an “arrangement” is one thing, facilitating the  effective exercise of the above mentioned rights is another. If an action  aimed at guaranteeing this proves also to be a precious element in the accord  between the micro-family level and the macro-social, so much the better: but   127 </page> <page sequence="30"> BERNARDO COLOMBO  this does not constitute in itself either the basis or the justification far it7.  Amongst the various means which a government can avail itself of in  order to ensure the opportunity to exercise the right-duty in question for the  couple, there is the law. As a deterrent supported by a system of sanctions, a  purely formal legitimization of established customs, an educational school, a  potential catalyst for social change, an essentially revolutionary instrument,  or whatever one wishes to think of it as, the law is, in every particular case,  the primary criterion for reference which has moral substance and reflects  and ideological view.  The technical means today theoretically at the disposition of the couple  in case of need are numerous: for example, abstinence, as indicated in  declarations of ecclesiastical authorities of the Eastern Ortodox Churches, by  Ghandi and by Mrs. Besant when she became a Theosophist; in addition,  periodic continence, accepted by the Roman Catholic Magisterium and – in  the past – by Mormon authorities; a wide range of other contraceptive  methods, including the I.U.D. which may result in the waste of products of  conception; one of the methods which stop development of the foetus, at any  time in its intrauterine life; and surgical sterilization. Positive law, and with  it the State, in ruling on birth control methods, follow an ideological and  moral vision: in particular, they adopt a specific practical ideology in  relation to human rights. What happens, in other words – focusing attention  on another sector –, is what occurs when it is forbidden to use, on this  occasion in order to check and select demographic dynamics, means like the  Spartan custom of infanticide, or eliminating those with hereditary defects or  anyone who belongs to particular categories from amongst those who have  years of fertile life ahead of them. Let us consider infanticide: if it were not  for the burden of pregnancy, it would be for the specified goal and from  certain points of view a more convenient method than others mentioned  above. If a deformed child were born, or more than the number one  desires in a multiple birth, or one of the wrong sex, one could get rid of  it, sparing the mother and family a distressful life and future, possibly  causing psychological harm, and taking mental and physical health.                                                    7 Along with the basic concept of responsible procreation as a good in itse1f goes a whole  series of other reasons, at times deriving from more general ideological positions. Thus, birth  control, if achieved through learning and practice of contraceptive methods, may be seen as a  means to reduce resorting to induced abortion; more generally, one may emphasise its fitness  as an instrument for the “1iberation” of women from a status seen as merely functional; one  may see in it a terrain propitious for the welfare of women and children, and for the  improvement of family relationships; one may recognise in it a way to reduce social  assistance costs; one finds that it can appear as a less expensive and more easily acceptable  component of a national demographic policy; etc. We are moving, thus, gradually from the  family level to the macro-social one.  128    </page> <page sequence="31"> HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES  Returning to our theme, it seems clear that the necessity of having  at one’s disposal the means to exercise the fundamental right of birth  regulation does not mean the right to use any means that may come to  mind, particularly those which infringe other human rights. I find no  difficulty, for example, in saying that for me induced abortion is a  violation of the fundamental right of a human being, who is such from  conception, a living creature, already as distinct from his mother and  from any other person as he will be for the rest of his days. In other  words, I do not recognise the existence of a fundamental right to  abortion and I find, together with others, that the key phrase of the  United States Supreme Court sentence of 1973 according to which the  right of privacy is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision  whether or not to terminate her pregnancy is surprising in its gratuity.  Such a violation also exists for me when abortion is permitted by law:  instum quia iussum is not a valid principle. Personally, I could not let  myself, in a seat of law, demand heroism from a mother in order not to  put her in prison. But neither should I be disposed to endorse the judicial  artifact on an attack on the part of minuscule little beings against, for  example – as experience shows us -, so many defenceless, poor, ignorant  girls from industrialized countries. Rather, I should try every possible  way to smooth away the difficulties which a mother encounters in the  case of a difficult pregnancy to allow her to give birth in the greatest  possible tranquility.  However, I am not here to pronounce legal formulae either on this  complex argument, or on others which could affect basic rights- irreversible sterilization8, relations between husband and wife and  between them and their children9, freedom of conscience of medical  personnel, safeguarding health in relation to side effects, etc. I consider  it more important to emphasize that, in a pluralistic society, on the one  hand the procedure for legitimizing legal action on this subject should  provide for the widest and most conscious participation equally for every                                                    8 It has been stated that to refuse sterilization to someone who asks for it is to violate a human  right. lf as a hypothesis, others claim that sterilization harms a person in his essential quality  as a – free – human being, in the name of what should a human right be acknowledged for the  applicant to have other people submitted to his own way of thinking?  9 I have heard the opinion attributed to doctors that in rural Mexico the I.U.D. would be a  particularly convenient instrument in so far as it would allow a wife to avoid pregnancy  without her husband's knowledge. Resort to sterilization for men without the wife's consent is  often reported in India. The United States Supreme Court decided in 1976 that a woman does  not have to have her husband's consent to have an abortion or, if she is under 18, that of her  parents, Apart from all other considerations, if one breaks the tie of loyalty, what remains of a  family other than fragments?   129 </page> <page sequence="32"> BERNARDO COLOMBO  citizen, on the other that the collaboration and critical vigilance of the whole  social body must continually be sought and listened to in applying the  formulae expressing the majority opinion.  But, on the subject of basic rights, one expects more from a government  than simply a legislative framework of what is permitted and forbidden as  and where necessary. Precisely one expects an active work of guarantee,  protection and defense. There are those who claim the market is a neutral  and sensitive way which, in a period of rapid change, can respond better  than a bureaucratic organization to the varying demands for means and  proper services for contraception, whilst others emphasize the advantages of  freeing such a subject from the profit motive. It is not the time to discuss the  merits of these sorts of alternatives. It should be specified, however, that if  there is no obligation for State power to provide on its own for everything, it  has the obligation to work directly towards integrating spontaneous  initiatives where these are not sufficient, and to face up to the needs of  couples who otherwise would remain underprivileged. Let us be quite clear,  nonetheless, that providing means and services is only part – and not the  most important – of the problem of encouraging the accomplishment of  responsible procreation. Working on the premise that people are to be treated  as intelligent and mature, they must he helped in forming their own  enlightened opinion, and there must he developed, with such an end in mind,  a process of information, consultation, of stimulus towards methodic  behavior and a sense of responsibility with regard to all that can happen in  life, in which members and organized groups, which in the political body  have a real rôle as educators, can and do have the right to intervene.  At this point, let us take up once again the argument on the right to  procreation. Equality for everybody in such a fundamental right is not  limited to purely a biological element but must include the opportunity for  everyone to give their children chances to realize their potential on the same  level as other people’s children. In order that the teleological meaning – of  which I have spoken – of living together in a community be observed,  society must be organized in such a way that the means to develop personal  talents and bring them to fruition in the light of potential parity in final  results, in comparison with those born in the most advantageous situations,  must be ensured for children of the poor and underprivileged despite initial  unfavorable conditions. I know very well how difficult it is: the relatively  disappointing experience in this direction in the scholastic sector is one of so  many examples one might consider. But the obstacles must not hide the aim,  nor allow the principle in question to be forgotten. For this reason, let us try  to avoid facile talk about excessive fertility as the cause of a family’s  poverty. By definition, everything that is in excess creates lack of balance:  130    </page> <page sequence="33"> HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES  so too with relatively excessive poverty resulting from bad social  organization, such as to make impossible or restrict the effective exercising  of the right of which we are speaking.  Now let us turn our attention to another field. The government’s  right to exert an influence – in any direction – on fertility has been  questioned, because all relative decisions must necessarily remain the  exclusive concern of the parents. The fact is that decisions, or more  generally behavior, are in every case conditioned by the concrete  circumstances in which they express themselves, legal, economic,  cultural, of customs and habits; etc., and particularly those having their  origins in political actions. If a government, working towards the  common good – that is, towards an improvement of the human living  conditions of all, so that everyone at least potentially might enjoy greater  liberty, economic security, spiritual well-being, etc. – and in the area of  its function to rationalize social life, has the opportunity, if not indeed the  necessity, to shape its actions in such a way as to change the framework  within which family choices are made, it is difficult to imagine why it  should be reprimanded, especially as long as it does not work in  opposition to basic rights. In fact, a government has a duty, and therefore  a right, to carry through initiatives to the best of its cognitive and  realizational abilities, for the sake of the higher aims which guide its life.  But this is not all. When a government takes legislative steps in the  area of means and services to favour responsible parenthood, it cannot  forget that the question goes far beyond purely technical and particularly  clinical aspects, since it concerns relations between the sexes, and  between parents and children, family integrity, public morality,  education, etc. In the same way a government which claims to operate in  such a manner as to modify the fertility level of the population, and thus  to act on other demographic parameters, must seriously consider all the  consequences which can result from its action, in a number of directions.  The technicalities of this analysis and the opportunity to create an on- going system of verification and control which could give timely  warnings about necessary changes of direction, cannot be examined here.  In this place one must remember the necessity to be careful not to break  up or compromise, with badly-formulated pressures on fertility, values  which are higher than those aimed at by the pressures themselves: mere  material well-being cannot constitute the only, or even the primary,  criterion of reference when other deeply-felt human and moral values are  in play, otherwise the psychic and cultural costs of the operation could  perhaps outweigh the advantages in other directions.  On the contrary, it must be added that, precisely because   131 </page> <page sequence="34"> BERNARDO COLOMBO  demographic policies never constitute an isolated moment in the process  of government, all programmers of action on fertility must be preceded  by a prudent comparison with the possibilities open for attaining by some  other route all the desired objectives. It must be obvious that this specific  type of government action is imperative, irreplaceable and something  that cannot be postponed, if it is to be understood and if it is to persuade  and to arouse agreement. This is so precisely because it intimately  touches human sensibilities in those things which are most dear.  A word should also be said concerning who it will be to make  judgments and draw conclusions, but I consider that my opinion on the  degree of participation to be demanded from the entire social body has  already been made sufficiently clear.  Amongst the objectives that one would like to assign to a fertility policy  is that of eliminating or toning down circumstantial oscillations which are  superimposed upon the evolutive tendency of births. It is a theme evoked,  for example, in analyses and discussions of recent experience in  economically developed countries: I shall examine it first because it leads on  into the maze of the problems with which we shall later be concerned. First  of all let us consider that this objective is seen from a different viewpoint  than the one most suitable to the demographic field, orientated rather  towards the long term. In the second place it is introduced against a  background of uncertainties: what will ever be the optimum population for a  given historical situation, what the optimum rate of demographic increase,  will it be most convenient to witness a uniform rate in time, or is that not  necessary, how can the latter be manœuvred to arrive at the former? If we  were able to answer queries of this nature, we should have a guide in  operational terms. But what is to be done when for example a Kuznets, in the  paper presented at the Belgrade Conference10 writes: “Given the variety of  possible qualifying conditions, it is difficult to establish unequivocal  quantitative relations between demographic trends in numbers and  quantitative aspects of economic growth. Thus, under some conditions  higher rates of population – growth may, in the long run, induce higher rates  of increase in per capita products: under others, lower; and quite often we  cannot tell”?  Then there is another line of opinion to be considered. Some people  believe that it is difficult to level out circumstantial waves, others point out  experimental interventions which have been effective in the short term; on  one side the expediency of concentrating attention on the modification of                                                    10 S. KUZNETS, “Demographic Aspects of Modem Economic Growth”, Background Paper  A. 10/2/e/389, United Nations World Population Conference, Belgrade, 1965.  132    </page> <page sequence="35"> HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES  generational rather than of contemporary ways of behaving is underlined; on  the other the immediate effectiveness of measures which, however, lose  strength in the long run, through a type of “psychological usury”, is stressed.  Rightly emphasized then are the psychic costs that alternate enforcements  following close one after another in opposite directions have on decisions  that the couples make, endangering the eventual attainment of responsible  parenthood which is certainly easier to achieve if backed up by a life plan  than if enforced by a day to day arrangement. If moreover one takes into  account the various kind of limits and obstacles – like those we shall shortly  see – which interventions upon the procreative behavior of couples come up  against, the idea of a counsel and an invitation to politicians seems to  emerge: that they try to consider whether, for their aims of equilibrium and  well-being, it may not be better to move in a different direction, introducing  instead greater elements of elasticity into the tissue of economic and social  organization to put this into such conditions as to be able to absorb without  too great a shock the various unfavorable effects of the changing number of  births.  In most industrialized countries today, reproductivity is not ensured, or  was not until a short time ago. In some, deaths out-number births. A  spreading preoccupation with this phenomenon is evident, and in some cases  important innovations to encourage a rise in the birth rate have been  introduced. These experiences, which are the repetition of previous ones  with uncertain results, again underline how arduous it is to obtain notable  results in this direction, how one must move on various levels, and how it is  necessary to put into action a series of mechanisms aimed at stimulating  behaviour which the law is certainly not capable of imposing. Well, one can  wonder if, in these initiatives, problems appear which have some connection  with human rights. This seems to be so, in my opinion, and I will give some  examples.  Among the instruments used is an increase in family allowances, with  the evident purpose of sharing among the collectivity and the families the  costs of the bringing up of children in a manner which is more favourable to  families. There are cases in which the scale of the allowances, variable  according to the order of birth of the children, is reduced above a certain  parity to a merely symbolic level. The intention to hinder the formation of  large families is clear. Some people, even, theorize about specific reserves to  be exploited, for example births of the third order, concentrating resources  and investments on these. These solutions do not satisfy me. It seems to me  that the responsible freedom of the partners, distributive justice, the real  good of society, are better safeguarded by a system of allowances which  increase, not only according to the number of children, but in proportion to   133 </page> <page sequence="36"> BERNARDO COLOMBO  the extra economic weight – differing from one case to another – that each  new birth gives rise to, which is graduated as a function of the age reached  by the children themselves, which ensures to each new-born child at least the  indispensable minimum for his human development, which takes into  account the evolution of the economic cycle of family income and outgoings  over the years and in the unfolding of the family life cycle, and so on.  Certainly this is a complex solution to complex requirements. But one must  not impose in practice certain family sizes, because, for example, they are  adapted more easily than others to the typology set down by a building  project for living accommodations. There is no need to turn back to genetics  and to remember the importance of the variability of the number of children  per family for the adaptation to environment to appreciate the risks – and the  boredom of an unbroken uniformity. A single, abstract, ideal family size for  a given society does not exist: instead a variety of individual disposition,  realized and evolving in a framework of concrete situations, does. We shall  quickly examine certain difficult problems which arise when the guidance of  such autonomous dispositions is aimed at without hateful discriminations.  Appreciable results in the inversion of birth tendencies have been  obtained in cases in which restrictions on legal abortions have been included  in the adopted policies. Certainly, I have no objection to make on this subject  when modifications are the fruit of greater moral and civil awareness: I have  already stated my position. I also accept the claim of the educational  function of the law, to direct citizens along more humane paths. Finally, I  understand the reasons put forward as a result of greater experience in the  realm of the consequences on the health of the mother and later children.  Much less do I appreciate, to say the least, the use of the valve of legislation  on abortion as an instrument of manœuvring demographic growth.   Thus, I would be cautious in expressing any judgment on the weight of  certain measures concerning extra-domestic work by women. I find  commendable· any effort that society might make to ensure that women have  the maximum possibility of freedom of choice: long maternity leaves and  also leaves for the upbringing of the children, the possibility of not only  keeping one’s job but also of returning to it in equal conditions, and without  sacrifices for the future development of one’s career; working hours that are  flexible and can be agreed upon; interesting solutions to part-time  employment; suitable infrastructural support for assistance in infancy and  pre-school cares, etc. I am less enthusiastic about social policies which press  women to enter into professional activity, linking the improvement of living  standards to the increase in the number of workers rather than to raising the  earnings of the person who constitutes the family’s main source of income.  If we choose, in this field, first to grant benefits and then to withdraw or  134    </page> <page sequence="37"> HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES  annul them, in practice laying the burden of attaining demographic  objectives above all on the woman’s condition, this would give me serious  reservations.  The scene is very different if, passing over the cases in which, more or  less correctly, the demographic element is taken as a purely exogenous  variable, we turn our attention to countries in which the reduction of the  birth rate is not only encouraged, but set down as a necessary objective. Here  we are entering a dense forest of problems of all kinds, and confront a  firework display of ideas and initiatives. Following the thread of our theme, I  shall pause once again on some most important and qualifying subjects.  On the subject of responsible parenthood – I am taking this as my  starting – point – one does not stop at satisfying spontaneous demands, but  goes on to take promotional steps, in these cases. One begins with the idea  that a high fertility rate need not be an answer to deliberate intentions, but  may constitute a mere sequence of habits, an expression of stereotypes  which do not correspond to fundamental needs, a result of ignorance, and so  forth. The circulation of appropriate information would allow people to free  themselves from the crystallized encrustations of a different era and, opening  their eyes to new realities, would give rise to a type of behaviour more in  line with them. The availability of adequate services would crown an arc of  changes which rests upon voluntary bases. A not unimportant advantage of  this approach would lie in the circumstance that the consequent reduction in  the birth rate would be translated, above all, into a checking of “unwanted”  births, that is, of those who from the very beginning are disadvantaged by an  unfavorable psychological climate.  Such an outline is extremely simplified and hides very complex facts.  Think – to make a rather unusual example – what it means to be given such  knowledge as we now have about the fertile and unfertile days of the  monthly cycle. What could before be taken as an obvious result in general,  but unforeseeable in the particular instances, of a normal way of life, within  the bounds of marriage; now makes itself felt in the more or less probable  consequences of each single act. On the individual act, that is, rest hopes,  weigh fears, are concentrated tensions of choices which are of enormous  importance to the couple concerned. The need for a personal habit of  responsible action is hence enormously amplified.  More generally, it is never a question of mere instructive information  and of providing technical assistance. Much deeper and more complex  values and relationships which it is imperative to understand and lo confront,  striving towards the formation of consciences, education in the full sense of  the word, always enter into play. Above all, in my opinion, interpersonal  relationships between the partners need further attention. Not, therefore,   135 </page> <page sequence="38"> BERNARDO COLOMBO  suggestions for evasions or tricks, but the confrontation with reality and the  development of co-responsibility of each partner in the couple on an equal  footing. I think that the promotion of the establishment of a more open  dialogue between husband and wife might be the hest path to draw greater  attention to the needs and condition of women in decisions about the  children to be brought into the world. In this order of ideas, I might add that  I can well understand efforts lo find a contraceptive method that is ideal  because it causes less disturbances and requires less continuous effort. I  consider, however, that this does not exempt us from the need lo  simultaneously educate and form characters with a sense of responsibility,  which in order to be deep and lasting must integrally embrace the human  personality. The determined, aware application required for the exercising of  responsibility in parenthood is hard to reconcile with levity of behaviour in  sexual matters. After all, even the perfect method has no effect if forgotten at  the right moment.  Yet there is more to be said, because in the area of family planning one  does not limit oneself to these positions, of informing and providing service,  dear to those who recognize in them the most civil road to the solution of  certain demographic problems: one goes on to propaganda, to incentives, to  pressure, as far as to forms of coercion. Before going any further, let us  mention at least some of the criticisms, advanced by those of other  ideological footings, against the initiatives that have been taken in this area.  On various occasions these have been seen as a useful instrument of defence  of the status quo, a substitute for indispensable social change, a covering of  the interests of others, a swindle, a source of false hopes which is responsible  for the evasion of what really counts to eradicate the evils of society that is  struggle and revolutionary catharsis. Such accusations annoy many people –  just as, on the other hand, others are disgusted by the praises sung of the  outcomes of birth control campaigns when they see time series of  sterilizations and abortions presented, together with other series, as   indicators, not of abdications and tragedies, as they consider them to be, but  of successes –, but to ignore them would be a mistake. Apart from every  other consideration, they encourage further investigations of our theme.  In fact these criticisms put forward an implied query: when, to reduce  procreation, one starts down the path of pressure of whatever type, who are  the ones to foot the bill, and, on the other hand, who gains from the results?  Are we dealing with the same families and the same groups of people, or  with different groups and families because of a differential incidence of  these actions on various parts of the social community?  The central nucleus of the problem to be solved by governments  worried by a too rapid demographic growth is that of satisfactorily  136    </page> <page sequence="39"> HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES  reconciling the consequences of decisions taken autonomously, on the basis  of particular interests and points of view, with the well-being of society as a  whole, inclusive of the families responsible for those atomistic decisions. To  such an end, the modification of the present division between families and  collectivity of the costs to be supported in order to bring up the children, and  of the benefits drawn from the latter, can be proposed. In using such terms I  am certainly not alluding only to items quite easily translatable into the  language of economic accountancy: I am well aware that others, indeed  perhaps the most important, are not translatable. Once reaffirmed the  principle that in no case is it permissible to transfer to others’ shoulders  burdens deriving from one’s own disorderly behaviour and that, on the other  hand, everyone has a duty to help those in a state of need through no fault of  their own, it must also be said that often the conflict of interests – or  different ways of viewing these interests – between isolated families and  society is not clearly amainable to responsibilities of a moral order but rather  are a result of innovatory facts and limited knowledge. In such  circumstances re-stabilizing action, aimed at turning individual streams and  the river of collective well-being back into the bed they share, has not even  what little guidance might be gleaned from the evaluation of mistakes to be  repaired and errors to be corrected. Consequently this action becomes very  delicate and it comes up against at least two categories of difficulties. The  first is that of the difficulties which arise because of the uncertainty  weighing upon the outcomes·of decisions that might be taken, given the lack  of knowledge on the subject. In the second place, and more especially, are  those which arise because action taken can cause social effects which are  contrary to what was intended. I must develop this last point, which is of  fundamental importance. Even if a government limits itself to weighing its  hand with thundering campaigns of propaganda, it is not acting impartially  in relation to the rights and expectancies of the various social components;  one could maintain that, in the end, the government pushes people to  renounce one kind of good – the joy which comes from children – which is  among the few in which the least favored social categories are on a level  with the others. Moreover, at least potentially, economic stimuli exercise a  bad influence, under many headings: in the subordination to purchasing  power of the exercising of a fundamental, inalienable right; in weighing  heavily upon the already precarious situation of the poorest since they, in  order to be effective, must be substantial; in the risk of leaving at the same  comparative level of income those unfortunate classes to whom, on the other  hand, is denied the gratification which comes from a family. What is even  worse, in certain cases, by increasing poverty, they impose punishment not  only and not so heavily on the parents, who may perhaps have acted less   137 </page> <page sequence="40"> BERNARDO COLOMBO  than responsibly, but also on the children who are born obviously innocent,  and on their brothers. A type of social self-destruction is the result, obliging  the community to somehow face the problems that its members, placed since  birth in pockets of emargination, cannot fail to cause.  Even if, to impose limits upon their regressive influence, one wished to  graduate rewards and punishments according to the subject’s income, the  basic objection, which has already been put forward, would not be overruled.  In fact, what meaning can be given to a tax on children which increases with  the order of birth and is scaled in its size according to family income, heavier  for the rich, lighter for the poor? Or to a financial incentive in favour of  those who have no other children – at least for a certain length of time –  higher for the poor and lower for the rich? Let us leave aside all  considerations about the actual possibility of using similar instruments on  millions of people in the present state of administrative organization of many  countries. Let us also ignore the fact that such methods risk accentuating  corruption phenomena by constituting a further incentive to conceal one’s  own income. But let us take note of the fact that in substance they can be  seen – and further encouraged by the agreement of those concerned – as an  open road to overcoming one’s own poor conditions. Essentially, in other  words, the problem remains within the area of a barter between shortages of  economic means and basic rights.  Is this the right road to eradicating poverty, or is it not more correct to  turn the foundations upside down in order to grant equality to everyone in  the exercising of human rights? Is it not better to carry out economic and  social changes which go towards fulfilling the basic needs of those lower  down the social scale; which guarantee to everyone at least that minimum  necessary for their human dignity and purpose; which – by spreading  education – put everyone into the position of being able to benefit from the  existing possibilities, without which efforts aimed at achieving greater social  equality would fall into the void; etc.? If we adopt this viewpoint, we must  agree that a higher distributive justice is not merely to be considered a  technique that promotes a reduction in births, but a condition that must be  satisfied as a logical preliminary in order to be entitled to spur people on into  pursuing it. If such a condition is not respected, the evocation of the  fundamental right of responsible parenthood and also of the means and  services needed to realize this lays itself open to the criticism that the  category of man’s rights is used far purposes which have little to do with  them.  A couple of words about the most excessive lines that are being talked  about or are in force to control demographic increase: I am referring to  proposals for agents to sterilize the whole population and connected licences  138    </page> <page sequence="41"> HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES  to have children, to sterilization and abortion made obligatory in certain  conditions, to the breakdown and weakening of nuclear family ties, to the  encouragement of homosexuality, to drastic restrictions in the number and  the type of dwelling-places, to policies that in practice oblige women to  work outside the home without even guaranteeing sufficient children’s  services, etc. From the point of view of essential rights, which is the one  which is of interest here, there seems to be no doubt that these are  unacceptable invasions into the sphere of personal liberty, or actions that  cause serious harm to the dignity of man and to his rights to choose how to  live his own life. Even when primary rights are not obviously cast aside,  these policies are so severe as to impose the burden of proving their  necessity, irreplaceability, immediacy on those who carry them out: these  people should always remember that the aim of public action is the well- being of human beings, not of capons in a coop.  While in recent years a sense of delusion and frustration with family  planning campaigns has mounted, and also uncertainty about which roads to  take in the future, a different orientation is taking up more and more ground,  putting in the foreground an indirect front of attack to the problems raised by  demographic dynamics. According to this train of thought, recourse to  family planning at most eliminates “unwanted” births, whatever  interpretation might be given to this ambiguous expression. This is not  sufficient to bring fertility to tolerable levels because in many societies the  family size in fact desired still remains too large. Therefore it is necessary to  aim at a modification of the basic motivations which underlie this behaviour.  Such a modification, which among other things would facilitate the success  of the aforementioned campaigns, is sought via changes in the socio- economic structure of the community: rationalization of work in the fields,  according to the idea that a more rational attitude in important areas like the  efforts to be made to conserve and improve the material conditions of one’s  own existence can also be transferred to the level of procreation; a change in  the woman’s condition in the family circle, and in society, with equal access  to education and an entrance to alternative rôles than domestic life; the  assurance of the stability of employment as a guarantee of security for  family fortunes; once again, progress in the equalization of incomes and  of social positions: and so forth in the same vein. Stripped of certain  exaggerations, this proves an inviting road which is certainly valid for its  intrinsic merits, and which in every case is to be followed. But will the  results come so quickly, and in such plenty, as is necessary? And what,  then, are the most effective reforms, compatible from other points of  view with essential rights? These questions need only be formulated for  one to realize how much remains to be studied and discovered about this   139 </page> <page sequence="42"> BERNARDO COLOMBO  subject. I shall add that I am but little convinced – at least in the forms in  which it has been presented up till now by a nouvelle vague which  seemed partly inspired by accounts of experiences in the People’s  Republic of China – by that which is known by the term  “communalism”, that is the establishment on the level of small local  groups of an autonomous community responsibility, united for a  programme of procreation and development. This constant checking by  neighbours – not even by one’s own family – on most intimate decisions  and relationships seems to me to be a form of coercion which is  incompatible with safeguarding human rights, and is also less  psychologically tolerable than a rough plan directly imposed by the  central power, with which it would probably ultimately end in agreement  on sanctions concerning the deviants from the system.   The problem of the discovery of suitable ways of achieving a  modification of the fertility level which would combine the maintenance  of a wide family variability, reflecting the free choices of those  concerned,·with a reduction of the average level thus remains a totally  open one. It is a current, shocking demonstration of the eternal problem  of the search far a system of social organization which conserves the ever  fragile equilibrium between authority and the consensus of citizens. For  an opportune solution, on the level of the individual, it suggests a  tendency towards the attainment of individual autonomy in conformity  with the heteronomy of a social order which permits the maximum  perfectioning of his own being to everyone. Without this personal  tension, no organizational solution fitting for man, which is carried  through by the State, can stand on its own feet.  A similar conclusion would be reached by extending the argument to the  world community – substituting States for persons –, with the further  warning that, in the absence of the guidance and power of an authority  that is above the State’s, in practice all solutions are entrusted to the  spirit of solidarity – as well as, of course, to the contractual and political  power, and to the brute force – of the member countries alone. I say of  the countries and not of the governors because, in a democratic regime,  these could do nothing alone, without the support af the whole internal  political body.       10. WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD?    In the dossier that he prepared for the benefit of the participants at the  well-known Williamsburg Conference in 1952, John Hajnal quoted the range  140    </page> <page sequence="43"> HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES  of estimates then current on the number of inhabitants that the earth could  sustain: it went from 4 to 6 billion, that is, at the most, to 6 or 7 times the  population at that time. In the document presented by the Secretariat of the  United Nations at Bucharest on “Population, resources and environment”  (E/CONF.60/5) is written that the earth is potentially capable of giving food  to 38 to 48 billion men, i.e: at least to almost ten times the population in  1974. A paper by the FAO, also included in the documentation of Bucharest  (E/CONF.60/CBP/25), raises these last figures to 50 to 130 billion, in  subordination to technological discoveries which can reasonably be  considered as within our scope, such as the desalinization of sea water so as  to render irrigable the warm deserts. In the same study it is affirmed that we  can go even further, provided that reference is made to diets which involve  the transformation of less cereals through livestock. This is not enough: the  limits would be moved even further outwards on the basis of non- conventional foodstuffs which require less land for their production.  Obviously, 130 billion means about 1000 inhabitants per km2 of  emerged land, excluding the polar caps and Greenland. That is not to say all  those people must always keep their feet on earthly soil. They could also live  in librated cities in inter-planetary space. Think of the progress which has  been made in less than 100 years in the flight of matter heavier than air. I  mention this, not for the sake of sensationalism, but to provide a peep-hole to  view the immense territories that the ability of homo sapiens opens out for  us. This points to a world very different from the present one, but man has  always dedicated himself to leaving his mark on and to fashioning new  worlds, different from those he has found.   However, another point must also be made. We today know that with a  definitely normal procreation – in fact, one surpassed by numerous  populations – combined with a control of mortality equal to that attained in  the most developed countries, rhythms of demographic increase are achieved  which appear unsustainable in the long run. Taking up an observation by  Ansley Coale, in a length of time of the same order of magnitude as our  historical period “the mass of humanity would form a sphere expanding at  the speed of light”. That is, on the basis of present knowledge, the future is  coming to meet us swathed in darkness and the cloak of absurdity.  The necessity for a stationary population appears today to be  inescapable: in this, which many hope for and urge to be attained as soon as  possible, I read a condemnation. I consider, in fact, the costs of stationarity  which, with the aforesaid mortality and current nuptiality, signifies on  average only about two children per family. I see in this the risk that within  the family itself motives of tension become institutionalized. Jealousy can  take root more easily between only two children. If they have come into the   141 </page> <page sequence="44"> BERNARDO COLOMBO  world over a short period of time, without older brothers who share their  position and, in a certain sense, also participate in parental authority, the  distance between parents and children can be accentuated and hence the  danger of generational conflicts; if they are of very different ages, each may  feel the psychological difficulties of the only child. In either case, the  educational potentiality of the family seems to have deteriorated. On the  crystallized structure of population weighs one of the greatest problems of  modern society, the emargination suffered by the wide band of people who  are getting on in years; and until at least 50 a constant excess of males is  registered, so that there is the risk of some people seeing themselves denied  monogamous marriage at the age most suitable for weddings. The world  seems impoverished and life greyer. And we know that to these  observations, which will be valid when a stationary state is reached  gradually and smoothly, other sadder ones would be added and substituted in  the case of drastic changes.  Concerning such conclusions, I find completely indifferent the fact that,  in the final reckoning, populations which do not assure their own  reproductivity, some of which are in regression, do not show any actual  grave signs of suffering, that indeed, at least from an economic point of  view, they are placed among those who are better off. At the most, some  years hence, a historian may find himself in the situation of repeating with  regard to them what Polybius alleged was amongst the causes of the  decadence of Greece: “Men, moved to arrogance, cupidity, and sloth, no  longer wished to contract marriage, or, if married, to raise offspring, keeping  at most one or two children to leave them in wealth and dissolution” (37, 4,  7). In fact, the tragedy is born from the lack of freedom of choice. Thousands  of years’ experience has taught us not to impose limits on man’s creative  capacities. But man, using these very capacities, seems to have built across  the path in front of him a wall which we can now only conceive of as  insurmountable: he seems to have chained his autonomy for an essential  moment of his personal expression and existential experience, which is that  of giving life to new beings and bringing them up to adulthood. In this  advancing reality I can see arising much more exacting problems than those  (although extremely serious) posed by the enormous inequalities existing on  an international plane, or by present local conditions. They are problems  which concern all mankind, who, to resolve them, will not be able to put his  trust only in science and technology, but who will have to rediscover the  moral value of imposing himself limits, and to make recourse to all his most  deeply hidden spiritual energies. This will not be the last lesson that our  discipline will have helped to give to modern man.    142    </page> <page sequence="45"> HUMAN RIGHTS, IDEOLOGY AND POPULATION POLICIES  Acknowledgements    The author wishes to express his deepest gratitude to the IUSSP for  kindly permitting this publication and, for their help, to several people.
