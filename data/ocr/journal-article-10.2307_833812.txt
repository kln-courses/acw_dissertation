<plain_text><page sequence="1">MUSIC IN THE TALE OF GENJI Fredric Lieberman Introduction The Tale of Genji (Genji Monogatari) is a novel in six books, written during the first decades of the tenth century by Lady Murasaki, a Japanese noblewoman. Dealing with the life and times of a certain fictional Prince Genji, the novel is one of the great works of Japanese literature; its characters are presented with such forcefullness and skill, however, that it easily transcends the barriers of time and culture to cecome a member of that comparatively small group of works which are truly world-literature. It is the purpose of this essay to examine the references to music found in the first two books of The Tale of Genji, with an eye toward the inferring of general cultural values for music in this period of Japanese history. Page references are keyed to Arthur Waley's translation in the Doubleday Anchor paperback edition (2 volumes, A55 and A176). Music and Nature The wind in the pine-woods, the whispering of innumerable night-insects: these sounds are as important in The Tale of Genji as are those of human music. The sounds of nature are an integral part of the novel, and have the effect of intensifying the emotional timbre of a scene, making it real, sensual. The absence of anthropomorphic imagery is conspicuous. Nature is never personalized; its sounds are abstract, definitely non-human, and yet capable of inspiring human emotion. This is a very sophisticated attitude; one almost expects the emotional power to be rationalized by some sort of anthropomorphism. But the preoccupation is with the sound, its quality, and its effect on the hearer. The majority of references to sounds of nature assign them emotional values in the range between mournful and utterly depressing. A typical phrase: "The rustling of the wind, the chirping of an insect would cast him into deepest melancholy . . . (I, 11). Natural music and human music cooperate. "The sound of the zithern reached the house on the hillside nearby, mingled with the sighing of pine-woods and the restling of summer waves. " (II, 118). The natural music inspires the human music, and their blending mutually intensifies their effect. Human music was considered a sophisticated partner of natural music--not an imitation, and neither superior nor inferior: merely another kind of music, and under human 39</page><page sequence="2">control. A minority of natural sounds serves specifically as a backdrop for human music. "It is only as a background to music that the sound of the sea is tolerable. " (II, 131). More frequently, the natural setting itself, particularly a moonlit night, is seen as a background that cries out for mnusic in order to be complete. "The waning moon had at last begun to rise. 'It is at times like this,' said the Emperor sadly, 'that one longs for music. '" (II, 34). Music was not only considered an arrangement of sounds and silences, but was more nearly related to the sound itself; tone quality was particularly important. "True, she was not a great performer; but the instrument was a particularly fine one and Genji found her playing by no means unpleasant to listen to. " (I, 149). Music is not associated with divine presence; indeed all facets of the novel are surprisingly free of the supernatural. This is in direct contrast to the Chinese musical philosophy which connects the music of man with the music of heaven in a highly intellectualized way. Music and Emotion A major premise of The Tale of Genji is that music and emotion are almost synonymous. The range of emotions associated with music is limitless: from joy to fear, from contemplative melancholy to sexual frenzy. For music to be conceived and perceived in such terms, the listeners would have to be extremely sensitive and emotional, by normal Western standards. This is somewhat surprising, considering the stereotype characterization of traditional Japanese as people able to master their emotions in any situation. Perhaps in the process of learning to master onets emotions, one's inner sensitivity to them is heightened to a comparable degree. Certainly, though the range of emotions in The Tale of Genji is extreme, the characters manage to maintain their outward composure and objectivity under the most trying conditions--at one point in the narrative Genji receives a verbal assault, is about to lash back in anger but refrains from doing so because he realizes that the reprimand was well deserved. And yet (a seeming inconsistency): "So moving and beautiful was this dance that at the end of it the Emperor's eyes were wet. " (1, 175). The symbiotic relationship between music and emotion is particularly important because The Tale of Genji is primarily a novel of emotions and personal rela- tionships, as opposed to a novel of ideas. Almost all the time, Genji is involved in a love affair of one kind or another. And Genji, like Tristan and other familiar tragic heroes, invariably loves most intensely precisely that woman who is the least obtainable. Small wonder, then, that emotional imagery is paramount throughout the novel, and that the emotions of frustration and melancholy are most prominent. Music and Society Everybody who was anybody played at least one instrument well; preferably two or more. We are informed that Genji had mastered no less than four instruments 40</page><page sequence="3">(II, 239), and that he was a top-ranking zithern player. Children were taught music as part of their serious studies beginning around age eight; and they learned by rote. Everyone thus knew enough music so that a friendly impromptu concert was likely to develop whenever people gathered socially: like singing madrigals or playing bridge. Women were often quite skillful, and it was not considered improper for a female virtuoso to join a normally all-male professional orchestra on occasion. It is somewhat remarkable that every important woman in Genji's love-life is represented as a virtuoso on either zithern or lute. One possible explanation for this is simply that only the most refined and cultured woman should be capable of attracting a refined and cultured prince--thus implying a moral lesson for readers: to catch a prince, study hard. Though there is probably some truth in this, it seems more likely that Lady Murasaki, in plotting the multitude of affairs indulged in by her libidinous hero, felt it necessary to rationalize Genji's limitless sex-urge in terms of something more intellectual. Thus, having seen a woman once--from a distance--Genji would be likely to conceive a violent passion for her, but would not actually seduce her until he has been entranced by the music of her zithern. Music and Musicales The main musical reference in The Tale of Tenji tells of a nostalgic musicale held at the home of an old nobleman-turned-recluse-priest, who had offered hospitality during Genji's exile from court (II, 118-121). Almost all facets of Japanese music previously mentioned in this essay can be found in this musicale, but that of musical style stands out. Genji begins the proceedings by playing a Chinese tune. This is obviously a somewhat sophisticated, somewhat passe style as the author uses the opportunity to comment that the playing was so fine that the local peasantry was attracted, even though the "strange musik" was beyond the pale of their experience. Perhaps Genji was not merely being esoteric, but was consciously attempting to compliment his host, who, having cultivated and cherished the traditions of a long-gone court, would feel more at home with "Chinese music. " This is clarified when the old man plays; he uses a "discarded" Chinese technique. The difference between the so-called Chinese style and the style of the day was not too great, as it was easy for Genji to join in singing as the old man played. From this and other references it can be inferred that musically the Age of Genji was one of transition from a classic, intellectual, "Chinese" tradition, to a more lyric, romantic, and even passionate tradition. But the artist is always several jumps ahead of society, no matter what period he finds himself in. "She clattered at the strings with all the frenzy that fashion now demands. It was a fine performance, no doubt, but I cannot say that it made a very agreeable impression on me. " (I, 36). 41</page><page sequence="4">Musical Instruments Most prominent among the musical instruments mentioned in The Tale of Genji is the zithern koto, which existed in various styles and sizes. Other important instruments are the lute biwa, various flutes, the mouth-organ sho, the reed pipe hichiriki, drums, and bells. Except for flutes, drums, bells, and the five-string zithern wagon, the musical instruments of tenth-century Japan were of Chinese origin. One scene in the novel describes a formal orchestral concert, and this is a somewhat unusual concert, being part of a large festival during which "forty men stood circlewise with their flutes. " (I, 177). Most of the ensembles are "pick-up groups" which are formed according to who is in the mood to play, or whoever happens to be around. Although there is no description of a formal court concert by the Imperial Orchestra, several references are made to the existence of such a group, which no doubt made up the conservative element in the musical life of the court, preserving the old, Chinese traditions as it does up to the present time. 42</page></plain_text>
