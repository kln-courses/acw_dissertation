SAMBURSKY: The Physical World of the Greeks. Translated from the Hebrew by Merton Dagut. Pp. x+255. London: Routledge, I956. Cloth, 25s. net. THIS is an excellent book, well translated. Classical scholars, as well as the general reader, are greatly in the debt of Professor Sambursky, an eminent spectro- scopist who is now Director of the Research Council of Israel, for producing what is at many points a more illuminating treatment of Greek science than any other that I know. Its author emphasizes that the book is intended not as a systematic history, but as a series of studies of some of the more important aspects of Greek science (in which, it may be said, special emphasis is laid on the neglected subject of Stoic physics), woven around a fairly numerous selection of ancient texts which are given in translation. The book does, however, incidentally present a useful survey of the Greek physical (but not medical or biological) sciences down to the time of Ptolemy and Plutarch. Specialists in different parts of this wide field will inevitably, of course, find matter for disagreement, and in certain respects improvements can be sug- gested. Far more often, however, the author has succeeded in a way almost beyond reproach; in particular, he has largely avoided the special traps that await the scientist who compares the motives of ancient science with those of modern. Such comparisons do indeed constantly and usefully occur, but the conclusions drawn from them are sober and reasonable. In the first chapter, on 'The Scientific Approach', the main differences between modern and ancient science are outlined. In the former there is a balanced use of induction and deduction; theory and practical application help one another. The Greeks, on the other hand, relied too much on induction, formed a priori hypotheses too readily, and neglected close and systematic observation and experiment-largely because their main motive, as Aristotle approvingly said, was curiosity, rather than the attempt to dominate Nature. The account of the Milesians and of Empedocles has certain drawbacks. In spite of a warning about Aristotle's methods, his conjectures are too readily taken as the truth about Thales, and the Aristotelian substrate is accepted without question as the true nature of the originative material. Anaximander is praised for using a scientific model, by which is meant his map-but the significance of his proportional arrangement of the heavenly bodies, which was the first step among the Presocratics towards the mathematization of the cosmos, is not noticed. The comparison between Anaximander's theory that the earth</page><page sequence="2">II2 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW stays still because of 'its similar distance from all things', and the scientific 'principle of the lack of sufficient reason', is an interesting one, the more so since Sambursky observes that this principle is dangerously misleading if applied with insufficient knowledge: 'Today . . . we regard the apparent absence of a sufficient cause as a sign that our knowledge is incomplete' (p. 13). Less caution is shown over Empedocles' Love and Strife: 'The modern physi- cist is amazed at the intuition which led Empedocles to propound the simul- taneous existence of forces of attraction and repulsion' (p. I9). The fact is, however, that Empedocles simply took the two opposite motives which, as Hesiod and many others had clearly recognized, dominate all human relations ('Strife' as well as 'connexion' had recently been emphasized by Heraclitus), and applied them in a quasi-material form to the cosmos. What is rather sur- prising here is that Empedocles still resorted, almost as openly as Anaximander, to an anthropomorphic explanation of physical interactions; though we must remember that even Aristotle did something similar. Other minor criticisms of this chapter are that Anaxagoras did not invent the idea of aether, as is implied, nor was aether regarded as an 'extremely rarefied form of air', except by Anaximenes; and the theory that the moon's light is reflected is at least as early as Parmenides. The second chapter, 'Nature and Number', gives a rather too brief and dogmatic account of Pythagoreanism, in which many of the serious chrono- logical difficulties are ignored and the fragments of Philolaus are accepted as genuine with no note of warning (fr. 12 at least, which is quoted, surely de- pends on Aristotle). Plato is firmly but not hysterically indicted for making 'pure' mathematics the philosopher-scientist's only concern; but Heraclitus is oddly underrated in relation to the progressive mathematization of the physical world, since his concept of Logos (which probably includes the idea of pro- portion), both in man and in the outside world, is clearly relevant here. He also seems to have been a notable exception to the tendency detected by Sambursky in all periods of Greek science of treating the world as a living body. This kind of judgement, which is now rather commonly made, is in fact too sweeping: a distinction should be clearly drawn between the treatment of movement as analogous to organic life and the imposition of anthropomorphic motives on external events; the former, at least, Heraclitus avoided. Sambursky perhaps exaggerates the scientific quality of Pythagoreanism, and for this reason is disappointed that it made little progress towards a science of dynamics. In any case, as Sambursky well shows, Aristotle held up further advance in this direc- tion; and the acute observation of Theophrastus, quoted on p. 48, that 'mathe- matics would seem to be constructed by us who put figures, shapes and ratios into things which in themselves do not exist in nature' (a translation which would be clearer if 'into things' preceded 'figures'), was taken as an indication that the process of phenomenal events could not decently be reduced to mathematical expression. Even Archimedes hardly touched upon dynamics. The third chapter is mainly astronomical, and is of high quality. It empha- sizes that astronomy was the most fruitful field for Greek scientific inquiry because its data presented themselves without trouble, could be observed more or less exactly, and were mostly recurrent and therefore could be checked. Sambursky tellingly restates the contrast between the modern view of regula- rity of motion, based on the analogy of the machine, as 'automatic' and soulless, and the Greek view, well exemplified in the Epinomis, that regular motion</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 1I3 implies a directing mind-here the analogy is said to be that of the craftsman faultlessly imitating his model. The idea of the divinity of the stars persisted through Plato to Aristotle, and the implied qualitative separation of heaven and earth meant that the mathematical study of the stars was kept utterly separate from terrestrial physics. A clear description is given of the main astronomical discoveries from the fourth century B.C. onwards: the explanation of planetary movements by concentric spheres, then by the theory of epicycles; Hipparchus' discovery of the precession of the equinoxes; the arguments on heliocentricity, in which the Pythagoreans and Aristarchus were overwhelmed by Aristotle, Hipparchus, and anthropocentric conservatism; and the measure- ments of the earth's circumference and of the distances of sun and moon. Here, incidentally, one may wonder how Aristarchus was able to overestimate by four times the angular diameter of the moon, which can be measured far more accurately than this with the very simplest of devices. The next chapter, on 'The Cosmos of Aristotle', is again acute and deeply interesting. Sambursky notes that Aristotle's teleological approach was more damaging to his astrono- mical than to his biological studies, for in the latter a presupposition of purpose does not much affect investigation within the species. The disastrous theory of natural places and of absolute lightness and weight arose from the old anti- thetical analysis, which, Sambursky remarks, led nowhere and in addition discouraged exact observation and measurement. After Aristotle's lifetime his cosmology was not accepted intact until the Middle Ages; it is remarkable, in fact, that it survived at all in face of radical differences in Stoicism and Epicureanism (much as they owed to Aristotle), and also in Alexandrian theories, like that of the precession of the equinoxes, which were incompatible with the Aristotelian structure of the cosmos. Indeed one may say that Aristotle was preserved by a sort of intellectual rroAtzo: for while Theophrastus was dubious about the teleological principle, the Stoics, who rejected the Aristote- lian finite universe, reinstated teleology, and so on, until Christian theology gratefully accepted the principle and ossified it for a millennium. In his fifth chapter Sambursky turns to Atomism. What he says on the differences between the ancient and modern theories is sensible enough; but it would have been helpful to add something on the interrelation of the two, for example in the person of Gassendi. There are a number of mistakes in this chapter which place it below the level of most of the others. It is not 'known' that Leucippus was an Eleatic (p. I07); to say that the postulation of a vacuum inescapably leads to solid atoms puts the cart before the horse (pp. IO8 f.); 7raT/roS is admittedly ascribed to Democritus once in Aetius, but is probably a backward projection from Epicurus (pp. 113, I24); the quotation assigned on p. I 14 to Simplicius is in fact reproduced by him from Aristotle's On Demo- critus, while on p. i30 Diels's very speculative supplement at the end of Democritus fr. I I is translated as though it were by Democritus; the passage from Aristotle's Metaphysics quoted on p. I27, in which the difference between shape, arrangement, and position of atoms is said to be illustrated in Demo- critus by A, N, AN, NA, and so on, has no known connexion with that in the Theaetetus where letters and syllables illustrate the idea of physical elements as such. On occasion in this chapter scientific terminology is used unnecessarily and perhaps misleadingly: thus a clear account of the Democritean explana- tion of differences between, for example, lead and iron is not really helped (even for the scientist ?) by references to 'lattice structure'; and it is confusing</page><page sequence="4">II4 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW to write of Epicurus' molecular theory, as distinct from the atomic theory of Democritus, solely on the grounds of Epicurus' stress on the concept of the concilium of atoms (though Sambursky has much that is interesting to say here). On p. I I I Sambursky uses language which makes it appear as though he subscribed to the mistaken view that infinite atomic shapes necessarily entailed infinite atomic sizes. Bailey exemplified this error when he wrote (The Greek Atomists and Epicurus, p. I27): 'Now logically of course infinite differences of shape imply infinite differences in size', and added in a note 'This was perhaps first seen by Epicurus'. Sambursky now states that 'To every given size it is possible to assign only a finite number of distinctly different shapes . . .', where the word 'distinctly' only confuses the issue. It is difficult to see what Sam- bursky means when he continues as follows: 'once all the possible mutations have been exhausted, a fresh shape can only come into being through an increase in the volume of the atom'. This argument is one apparently advanced by the author himself, and not reported, for example, from Epicurus; it must be regarded as unfortunately phrased. The fact is, of course, that in a con- tinuous atom an infinite number of shapes can be imposed upon a given volume. In the sixth chapter, entitled 'The World of the Continuum' and dealing with Stoic physics, the author immediately regains his highest standards. He gives a clear account of Stoic ,rvev,ua and of ~rvevlxartKos WvovS, which gives to matter its specific structure and therefore its qualities. The Stoics, it is claimed, improved on Aristotle in their conception of movement in a continuum (though it is surely exaggerated to write on p. I 39 of their 'profound understanding of dynamic phenomena in an elastic medium and their power of precise formula- tion'). 'Tensional motion' is well contrasted with the Epicurean idea of 'throbbing' or 'vibration', and is illustrated by quoting Galen on the out- stretched arm. Posidonius' concept of 'sympathy' is clearly described; too much, perhaps, is claimed for Chrysippus' theory of total mixture. The problem of mixture leads on to a discussion of infinite divisibility as treated by Zeno of Elea; an excellent summary of the paradoxes and their implications shows how Aristotle in his discussion of them almost arrived at the concept of velocity. The difficulties over the definition of Time are stated on p. 152: 'the obstacles to the analytical description of time on the analogy of length are great, bound up as they are with our own inner consciousness of time: our fundamental biological sensation of the onward flow of time stands in the way of its compre- hension in the abstract and its transformation into a geometrical dimension. This decisive step, which was the prerequisite of the evolution of modern physics, had to wait for Galileo.' The chapter closes with an interesting dis- cussion of the application of the principle of convergence to famous problems in continuity like Democritus' paradox about adjacent sections of a cone and Eudoxus' determination of the volume of the cone. Chrysippus evolved the expression 'equal and unequal' to describe the relationship of adjacent conic sections: here I side with Plutarch against Sambursky in finding this 'an infringement of the fundamental concepts of logic'-it was, no doubt, a useful paradox, but logic is concerned with the description of the determinable and not with paradoxes, however evocative. In his next chapter Sambursky considers ancient views of causation. The rigid Atomistic view presaged the analogy of the machine; Aristotle reverted to the Socratic analogy of the craftsman; Epicurus abandoned science in his theories of atomic swerve and of alternative explanations; the Stoic Logos, with</page><page sequence="5">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 1I5 its implication of a continuous cosmos, restored a rigid system of cause and effect-'hence we observe the paradoxical situation that the essentially reli- gious Stoic school becomes the legitimate heir of the Democritean concep- tion of mechanical necessity and the bitterest opponent of Epicurus' attempt to circumvent causality' (p. I69). The author maintains that it was the 'philo- sophical' element in Epicurus which subdued the 'scientific' element; but this antithesis between philosophy and science is a misleading one, and it would be truer to say that the schematic, dogmatic, a priori element (and philosophy is not necessarily all these things) dominated the deductive and rationalistic element. Yet the scientist's viewpoint is revealing and useful here, as also in the comment on Democritus on p. I6I that '. .. in his refusal to be drawn into 'metaphysical' questions, we can see his intellectual acumen and his deep understanding of physics'. The Stoic attempt to explain free-will by the dis- tinction of preliminary from determining causes is well explained; it is noted that in Stoic physics, perhaps more strikingly than elsewhere in Greek thought, 'we find a penetrating analysis of scientific method or scientific reasoning which is either performed upon the wrong object or mixed up with worthless super- stitions' (p. 174)-for example, with the belief in divination. It was the Stoics, and particularly Chrysippus, who progressed from Theophrastus' examination of hypothetical syllogisms to a definition of the possible; yet no general theory of probability was achieved. Here Sambursky has an excellent discussion of the Greek indifference to questions of probability, illustrated by the rules of the game of knuckle-bones, in which there was no correlation between the scoring and the probable frequency of the four different throws. Chapter 8 deals with cosmogonies, with special reference to the use of the vortex-idea (which is, of course, important in modern cosmogonical theory). Again the Presocratics are handled in a manner that is less convincing than usual, and the author's use of evidence is less discriminating than is desirable in such a delicate field. Thus Anaximander, if he believed in a vortex at all, certainly did not believe in the permanent existence of one in the Boundless; and the Atomists evidently did attempt to describe how their vortices originated. The statement that from the doxographical sources it is 'probable' that Anaxi- mander believed in an infinite number of simultaneous worlds is unacceptable nowadays. The weaknesses of this chapter are more than made good by its able successor, 'The Beginnings of Astrophysics', which is mainly a long and fascina- ting discussion of Plutarch's essay On the Face in the Moon-'a distillation of the science, philosophy and mythology of all the four hundred years that separate Empedocles from Poseidonius'. Sambursky shows how Aristarchus' heliocentric hypothesis, though not generally accepted, led one of Plutarch's Stoic sources to something like a theory of gravity-at any rate, to a radical departure (unfortunately quite ephemeral) from the Aristotelian geocentric theory of natural places. The chapter ends by contrasting the cautious scientific spirit of Seneca's discussion of comets with the dogmatism of the Aristotelian tradition. Last comes a brilliant essay on 'The Limitations of Greek Science'. The theory that is so hard worked by Farrington and others, that it was the institu- tion of slavery that produced the Greek lack of interest in technology, is briefly and conclusively dismissed by references to Egypt, where slavery and techno- logy flourished together. Scientific progress was eventually inhibited by the same a priori attitude which gave to it its original stimulus; and lack of technical</page><page sequence="6">I 6 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW development and of experimentation produced after the second century B.C. what Sambursky calls a shortage of scientific fuel, which allowed an irrational penetration from the East and favoured the spread of belief in the new ideas offered by Christianity. This process was reversed, as it were, at the Renais- sance, when the petrifaction of science and philosophy by the Christian scholastics finally resulted in a belated reaction against Aristotelianism. It is perhaps a little naive to marvel at 'the framing of mechanistic cosmogonies at a time when the machine was unknown'; this is to exaggerate the place of analogy in human reasoning, and after all, the natural world does exemplify, if at- tentively studied, a tendency to regularity of event and consequence. Little else can be found to criticize in this discussion of the limitations of Greek science, which is the best that I have seen. It is a fitting conclusion to a book that is a learned, enlightening, and highly commendable contribution to the study of ancient thought. Trinity Hall, Cambridge G. S. KIRK HOMERICA GISELA STRASBURGER: Die kleinen KEmpfer der Ilias. (Frankfurt Diss.) PP. I43. Frankfurt: privately printed, I954. Paper. DR. STRASBURGER begins her very illuminating dissertation with a stylistic analysis of the various ways of mentioning minor warriors in the Iliad. She dis- tinguishes the simple catalogue of names alone (e.g. v. 677-8); the name with patronymic (v. 707); the name with an epithet descriptive either of racial or local origin (v. 706); and the name with a description of costume (v. 707) or warlike valour, skill, or strength (v. 706). The simple catalogues show certain stylistic variations; and a tendency to alliteration may be significant. Some- times the patronymic is expanded into a genealogy (e.g. xv. 525-7), in which, as a further variation, some special quality of an ancestor may be mentioned (e.g. v. 76-78); or the local origin may be particularized (e.g. v. 44); or the valour may be emphasized (e.g. v. 536). Similes are also used for giving vividness. These sub-heroic figures help the main narrative in several ways. They give a concreteness and definiteness to the presence and movements of the armies at Troy. Their defeats serve to enhance the glory of the chief heroes (whose 'kills' a later writer like Hyginus could record as if they were hunting records). Their variously contrived deaths emphasize the sadness of war. The details of their personal background arouse pathos through echoes of homeland and family. There is an implicit contrast here between the world of peace and the world of war, the world of heroism and the world of everyday life: 'Was tut man dort? Leben. Was muss man hier? Sterben.' And there is a further con- trast between the splendid funeral and abiding fame that attend the top-flight hero after his death and the oblivion that obliterates the minor warrior. Occasionally, also, a minor warrior enables the poet to introduce associations and suggestions which help to emphasize the underlying feelings of the whole poem. This is best seen in Lycaon, whose death (as E. T. Owen, quoted here, has suggested) 'puts before us, in Homer's objective way, as an event, the true inwardness of the tragedy of Achilles'.
