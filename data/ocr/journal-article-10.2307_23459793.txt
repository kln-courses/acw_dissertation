These finds shed new light on Chal colithic art and culture as well as on Chalcolithic society in general. They establish a new refer ence point for the Chalcolithic period in the Upper Galilee which was hitherto outside the pale of Chalcolithic research. One of the most important and intriguing contributions of the Peqi'in assemblage is the large quantity and wide variety of human representations, which add a new dimension to an aspect of Chal colithic art previously encountered on a very limited scale. Full-length and full-featured anthropomorphic portrayals attributed to Chalcolithic Palestine are few, consisting only of ivory figurines from Be'er Sheva' (Perrot 1959) and the ceramic "Woman with Churn" from Gilat (Alon 1976). Partial representations are, however, more com mon, consisting principally of facial features. They are an essential component of the basalt pillar figures found in the Golan (Epstein 1988) and are common on ossuaries uncovered in vari ous burial caves (Perrot and Ladiray 1980:38, PI. X:a-f, 1-7). Features commonly portrayed during this period include the prominent nose (Perrot and Ladiray 1980:38, PL X:a-f), painted eyes (Alon 1976: Figs. 33, 36; Perrot and Ladi ray 1980: PI. X:4-7), carved eyes (Epstein 1988: Fig. 2:1-3,5-8) and symbolic beard (Perrot 1959: PI. 2; Epstein 1988: Figs. 1,2a, 2b, 5:30,31). The Peqi'in cave, in contrast, presents an ar ray of unique painted, applied and sculpted human facial and body features on ossuaries, ossuary lids, ossuary jars, high-footed bowls and stands. Interpretation of these anthropomorphic motifs requires a multidisciplinary approach encompassing various anthropological, mytho logical, sociological and iconographic aspects. This preliminary study has no such far-reaching intent; indeed, a full study of the anthropomor phic assemblage must await presentation of the entire mortuary assemblage. Nevertheless, the remarkable and innovative nature of the Peqi'in finds—chief among them the new, even revolu tionary, concept of complete, naturalistic two and three-dimensional presentation of human heads—justifies the presentation of a selected group of anthropomorphic finds, accompanied by preliminary suggestions regarding their inter pretation. The artifacts presented here are, by necessity, a small portion of the entire assemblage, which consists of 250 to 300 vessels. Approximately half of these have at least a single anthropomor phic motif.1 The large proportion of ossuaries and ossuary lids reflects the fact that these are the largest category of objects in the cave.

Does the appearance of extremely different styles, which perhaps indicate different ideological or cubic approaches to human por trayal, have any chronological significance? Should a linear development of artistic conven tion be assumed, wherein naturalistic portrayal precedes the more abstract and symbolic or vice versa (Herskovits 1948:385-398)? Or is this situation simply the result of the existence of individual artisans each practicing his/her craft in a personalized manner? Any serious consid eration of these issues requires analysis of the entire cave assemblage and, thus, these shall remain at present moot points. The present selection illustrates the variegated forms in which the two- and three- dimensional painted and sculpted features appear. The out standing sculpted heads, some of which were found detached from their original vessel (e.g. Figs. 3, 4), present complete natural human fea tures. These features comprise not only the typically Chalcolithic exaggerated applied nose, but also nostrils, eyes, ears, mouth, teeth, beard and hair. Other recurring physical features are hands and breasts. The mouth is a new contribution to Chalcolithic iconography. The unprecedented appearance of painted (Figs. 1,4, 5) and modelled mouths (Figs. 2, 4, 6, 9), both open and closed, is a very signifi cant addition to human portrayal, since it has been commonly assumed that this period produced "mute" personifications (Fox 1995:221). In two examples presented here even teeth are portrayed (Figs. 4, 5). Beards are also rare in Chalcolithic anthropo morphic iconography, being confined to the Golan basalt pillar figures on which they were infrequently sculpted (Epstein 1988: Fig. 1:1, 2a, 2b). In Peqi'in, however, they are portrayed in three fashions: painted (Figs. 1, 5, 11), modelled (Figs. 3,6), or both modelled and painted (Fig. 4). On some heads prominent ears are formed either by applied ceramic rings (Fig. 3), occa sionally centrally pierced (Figs. 2, 4), or as modelled protruding extensions of the head (Fig. 1), similar, once again, to ears sculpted on the Golan pillar figures (Epstein 1988: Fig. 3). Nostrils, though stated by Perrot to be indi cated on some ossuaries, are, in fact, quite rare in the standard Chalcolithic repertoire, appear ing on only two of the ossuaries he discussed (Perrot and Ladiray 1980:37; Figs. 61:7; 83). Their frequent appearance in the Peqi'in cave (Figs. 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 13) adds import and relevance to this hitherto negligible anthropo morphic motif. Interpretation of the iconographic representations in the cave must take them into account. Prior to their appearance at Peqi'in, the ab sence of mouths, beards and nostrils was so marked a characteristic of the Chalcolithic facial portrait, that the depiction of only an exagger ated nose and large round eyes was considered as artistic convention (Gonen 1992:76). The ap pearance of mouths and nostrils at Peqi'in thus constitutes a revolutionary approach to human portrayal. The addition of these breathing organs to the iconographic repertoire may be interpreted as an allusion to the human soul and to those life-giv ing forces which would strengthen the deceased in the afterlife. They may have been understood, furthermore, as symbolizing attributes of a life giving and life-enhancing deity, as Epstein (1982:65-72) suggested in regard to the appear ance of the prominent nose. Beck (1989:45-46) appears to have accorded less importance to the nose motif, placing it in the broader context of funerary symbolism and possible ancestor wor ship, though not totally abandoning the suggestion of divine symbolism. Assuming that anthropomorphic iconographic features are evidence of gender definition of the interred, it would appear that beards indicate male burials. Stylized breasts, using this logic, should be assigned to females.5 Although one might have expected that, in addition to breasts, female gender would be indicated by other at</page><page sequence="13">Finds from the Peqitn Cave 13* tributes, no further clearly female attribute, nei ther facial nor physical, was found. The breasts, in general, were most frequently modelled on the facade of the ossuary lid, where they never appeared alone, but always in conjunction with further anthropomorphic features (Figs. 7, 8), unlike the nose, which was occasionally the sole feature. Breasts are found as a motif on ossuary jars as well, where they may appear either in association with other features, usually the nose (Fig. 10), or as a sole anthropomorphic symbol. Their appearance may be understood as signify ing gender definition or, like the breathing organs discussed above, as relating to life-giving forces. Merhav (1993:38-40) is of the opinion that the breasts, in association with the promi nent nose, should be interpreted as representing a female deity. The similarity in shape of a number of the lid facades (e.g. Fig. 7) to that of Chalcolithic violin figurines, commonly understood as representing a feminine aspect, is striking (cf. Yadin 1976). The common appearance here of anthropomor phic features on such facades buttresses the claim that their shape represents schematic hu man figures. Moreover, the frequent application of breasts on these facades would appear to pro vide further evidence for their being essentially an abstract expression of female gender, human or divine. An uncommon stone violin figurine with sculpted breasts from Peqi'in, similar to a figurine from Shiqmim (Levy and Alon 1985: PI. 11:C), is further evidence for the relation between the violin shape and female gender. Hands and arms are additional features which appear, though sparingly, on various ossuaries. In Fig. 2 they are depicted in a natural hands-on hips position as components of a figure compos ing the entire facade of a large ossuary. A more stylized portrayal of a figure with downward extending arms, somewhat bent at the elbows, appears on an ossuary lid (Fig. 6). In contrast, on two additional, almost identical, lids, one of which is illustrated in Fig. 8, the arms are raised in what appears, significantly, to be a ritual con notation familiar from other, later, appearances (Beck 1995: Fig. 6). There is little repetition in the Peqi'in portrait repertoire. Of the material presented here, in addition to the above-mentioned lid, only the large ossuary topped by the bearded head (Fig. 1) is one of two nearly identical renditions.6 Also, the unusual figure depicted in Fig. 2 is strikingly reminiscent of an anthropomorphic portrayal applied to a completely different vessel type—an extraordinary stand (not illustrated)— and possibly hints at their relating to a single individual, either in a cultic or in a personal aspect. As far as can be determined at the pre sent time, each of the remaining sculpted heads and anthropomorphic compositions is unique. It is this feature which may suggest that each por trayal represents a specific individual and not simply more or less skillful attempts to depict a standard symbolic face. More care and expres sion would seem to have been invested in the production of these artifacts than in standardized manufacture. Thus even hair (Fig. 4) is a person alized feature, applied to an ossuary or lid intended for a specific individual. However, it cannot be excluded that the various heads and more stylized anthropomorphic representations may, alternatively, symbolize multi-faceted di vine incarnations (Merhav 1993:41). A significant aspect of personification may be found in the "twins" ossuary (Fig. 9). It would seem apt to propose that this ossuary possessed two, probably related, individuals in light of the fact that in a number of instances two individu als were actually found interred in a single ossuary.7 While a detailed typology of ossuaries and ossuary jars in the tomb lies outside the scope of this discussion, a three-fold division in the mode of secondary interment in the cave is evident:8 (1) interments in ornate anthropomorphic recep tacles; (2) interments in containers with less complex anthropomorphic features or with var ied linear decoration; (3) ordered collections of bones, outside of any burial receptacle. The three separate burial fashions, although all entailing secondary burial, may be an expres sion of the social status of those individuals in each reinterment and, thus, may be interpreted</page><page sequence="14">14* Gal, Smithline and Shalem as reflecting the existence of social hierarchy in the community which utilized this burial cave: leading families or individuals being reinterred in the more ornate ossuaries, those of lesser in fluence or affluence in plain ossuaries and jars, and members of the lowest social stratum rein terred in the cave, outside any receptacle. The degree of hierarchical structure in Chal colithic society has been addressed through the study of settlement characteristics, material cul ture and mortuary practices. Levy (1995:325) interpreted settlement patterns and burial prac tices at Shiqmim—which are quite different from those known now from Peqi'in—to indi cate the existence of a ranked society. Excavations at the cemetery in Nahal Kissufim (Goren and Fabian 1993:91) and at the Nahal Qanah cave (Gopher and Tsuk 1996:236) led the excavators to similar conclusions. Earlier, Perrot interpreted the evidence in a different light, sug gesting that it reflects an essentially egalitarian society (Perrot and Ladiray 1980:131). Gilead (1988: 428^)29) is of the opinion that there is insufficient evidence for the existence of a so cially-differentiated society. The objects from the Peqi'in cave now pro vide the most convincing evidence yet found for the existence of a ranked society. The imposing, almost menacing figure on the facade of the large ossuary depicted in Fig. 2, for instance, suggests an authoritative, influential individual within the local community, or even, within greater Chalcolithic society. Although the cave was found in utter disarray, it appears, nonetheless, that a concentration of the anthropomorphic ossuaries was originally placed near or on the well-constructed stone floor of the upper terrace, in relative proximity to the cave entrance and above the burial area within. In this fashion, what could be charac terized as a "VIP" section was created. This lends further support to the assumed high status of those reinterred in these ossuaries. Conclusions The association of finds comparable to those from Peqi'in with various cultic and sacred func tions, and their presumed symbolic representation of specific deities, has been suggested—if on meager evidence—by Epstein (1982), Beck (1989) and Merhav (1993). The finds from the Peqi'in cave, we believe, present clear evidence, for the first time, that by molding or painting faces on ossuaries, jars and stands, personal at tention was paid to certain individuals, as individuals or as members of a high-ranking class. This may be further interpreted as an as pect of ancestor worship. We have attempted to demonstrate that the mortuary finds in the Peqi'in cave, and the ap proach to death and interment which they illuminate, reflect a structured and hierarchical society. Only such a society could have sup ported the artisans who would have produced such expressive works of art. The existence of a caste, tantamount to a priestly caste, that main tained the physical state of the cave and determined and organized ritual practices and ceremonies associated with the reburials, may be presumed. This should be understood as one of the determining hierarchical aspects of a large, geographically-dispersed and socially diversified society. Ironically, only a few Chalcolithic sites have been surveyed in Upper Galilee, and there is scant evidence for settlement in the immediate vicinity of the cave (Frankel, Getzov and Aviam forthcoming). The fragility and cumbersome na ture of the ceramic artifacts would seem to imply that they were produced in close proxim ity to the cave, in an as yet unknown site. Assuming, then, that the Chalcolithic settlement of this area was not dense, it cannot be excluded that the deceased who were reinterred in the cave were brought from one or several of the geographically-dispersed population centers which flourished during this period—the Golan Heights, Jordan Valley, Negev, Judaean Desert and the coastal plain as far north as Byblos. Taking into account the existence of major Chal</page><page sequence="15">Finds from the Peqitn Cave 15' colithic burial sites in the Negev and central coastal plain, it would appear reasonable to as sume that this cave served the inhabitants of the northern regions, from the Golan plateau in the east to the northern coastal plain in the west. This conforms with the recurring pattern of Chalcolithic cemetery and settlement distribu tion, where large burial areas cannot always be associated with specific nearby occupation sites (Gopher and Tsuk 1996:230-232). Within the context of our present knowledge of this period, the artistic qualities of the objects from the Peqi'in cave, their social and cultic implications within the Chalcolithic culture, and the character of the burial site itself, are difficult to associate with any of the known major settle ments. If the cave was utilized only by a local populace, then the similarity of numerous finds to those known from other, distant sites, would certainly indicate that they had intensive ties with the above-mentioned regions (Gal, Smith line and Shalem 1997:154). Nevertheless, these unique works of art may indicate the existence of a distinct, previously unrecognized Upper Galilee Chalcolithic culture. The repertoire of the Chalcolithic period has been immensely enriched by the many catego ries of finds in the Peqi'in cave; undoubtedly, the sheer quantity of anthropomorphic repre sentations will lead to a reassessment of the symbolic, cultic and sociological constructs of this seminal age. Notes 1 It should be pointed out that additional categories of ossuaries, most notably a unique group with zoo morphic iconography, were found in the cave. 2 The difficult reconstruction of the vessels from the burial assemblage was expertly done by Michal Ben Gal and Elisheva Kamaisky. The drawings were prepared by Noga Ze'evi and the photographs by Mariana Salzberger, all of the IAA. 3 A similar, although petrified—and thus irremov able —ossuary was left in the cave. 4 This facade is reminiscent of the shape of violin figurines, to be discussed below. 5 This hypothesis cannot be tested due to the de stroyed nature of the burials. 6 Cf. n. 3. 7 There is, unfortunately, no direct evidence to prove that the "twins" facade actually belongs to one of these ossuaries since it was found smashed with no definite osteological remains associated with it. 8 Cf. n. 1.
