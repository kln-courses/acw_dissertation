<plain_text><page sequence="1">BUDDHIST STUDIES K.R. van Kooij and H. van der Veere, eds., Function and Meaning in Buddhist Art. Proceedings of a seminar held at Leiden University 21-24 October 1991 (Gonda Indological Studies, III). Egbert Forsten, Groningen 1995, XII-212 pp. with b/w and colour illustrations in the text. These are the very nicely edited and printed proceedings of a workshop, the main target of which was to analyse Buddhist art through spectacles already tested in the study of European art. Karel R. van Kooij is certainly right when he says (p. XI) that this idea, 'of course, is not completely new' ? he is right, but it is also true that most of the scholarly literature dealing with Oriental (especially Indian) art is decidedly backward compared with the much more sophisticated tradition of iconological, sociological, semiotic studies in the history of European art. If on the one hand the analysis 206</page><page sequence="2">of styles has often reached quite a satisfactory level, on the other, the interpretation of meaning in Indian visual art (and to a certain extent, also in the other Eastern arts) is still so narrow mindedly bound to reading the images by means of the literary texts alone or using iconographies only for what they empirically depict, that books like these are most welcome. The first paper is 'Buddhist art in medieval China: the ecclesiastical view' (pp. 1-20), by Erik Z?rcher. This paper is very important for the students of Indian art as well, as it contains a large number of passages from the Scriptures relevant to sculpture, painting, and the use of images. Jan Fontein deals with 'Relics and reliquaries, texts and artefacts' (pp. 21-31). One might perhaps object to his premiss, that the relics (sarira) 'constitute the principal raison d'etre for the st?pa \ nevertheless he is certainly right when he says that surprisingly enough the relics 'have by no means received the same kind of attention' as the shape, function, and symbolism of the st?pa, a subject much debated in recent years. Fontein identifies four kinds of sarira cult in chronological succession. The first one had the corporeal remains of the Buddha himself as its object, but the author wisely concludes that at this early stage there is no indisputable connection between the literary texts and the archaeological evidence. The second phase of the sarira cult dates back to the time of Asoka ? the erection of an unbelievably large number of st?pas (each on a portion of sarira) in the various parts of the kingdom was to represent a model for many other sovereigns, chiefly in China. The third phase is a development of the second one; it is represented by the large-scale distribution of Buddhist relics throughout the empire, which for example took place in A.D. 601, when the Sui emperor Wendi decreed that the enshrinement ceremony should be performed everywhere at exactly the same time: 'It should be said', Fontein adds, 'that now for the first time literary evidence begins to match archaeological finds'. Eventually a new development took place, that of the 'cult of spiritual relics': dh?ranis or mantras (i.e., dharmasariras) take the place of corporeal relics (real or forged, it makes no difference) ? a tradition that seems to have been transmitted from India to China during the 7th or 8th century. The relevant bibliography referred to is not perhaps fully satisfactory ? one at least wonders why the fundamental essay by G. Tucci on this subject (Indo-Tibetica, I. 'mc'od rten' e 'ts'a ts'a nel Tibet indiano ed occidentale, Roma 1932) is not even mentiond. That the terms 'aniconic', 'aniconism', are not fully satisfactory for expressing the concept that the Buddha was not represented in human form, is a point on which all will agree. Nevertheless the papers by Susan Huntington ? though rich in interesting observations ? have created a much greater confusion. Her suggestion that in many cases the artists of Bharhut and Sanchi depicted scenes of pilgrimage to the holy places or re enactments of episodes of the Buddha's life, is hardly acceptable and even useless for her own purpose ? viz, that of demonstrating that the early Buddhist art was not 'aniconic'. Karel R. van Kooij cautiously touches upon this topic in his contribution 'Remarks on festivals and altars in early Buddhist art' (pp. 33-43): though he always maintains a critical attitude towards the subject dealt with, it seems to me that he takes Dr Huntington's hypothesis even too seriously. The article by van Kooij is very useful and convincing as far as the interpretation of altars / ?sanas etc. is concerned, but it does not appear to have put into the proper focus the questions raised by S. Huntington: she may provide evidence of dozens of cases in which not one mythical scene is represented but undoubtedly a re-enactment or a 'modern' pilgrimage ? the fact remains that the Buddha is never represented either in the stories of his life or (if we accept Dr Huntington's suggestion) in the places of pilgrimage. The word is perhaps improper, but there are grounds enough for speaking of 'aniconism'. Professor van Kooij tries to find an inter? mediate position when he writes (about the 'empty thrones', altars in his opinion, surrounded by festive gatherings), 'Knowing that the Buddha image was to appear a few centuries later, we may call the gathering-typus a pre-iconic artistic formula, but not an aniconic one'. Will Professor van Kooij forgive me if I say that he is somehow playing upon words? Some perplexity arises also when Professor van Kooij deals with the Bharhut relief depicting 207</page><page sequence="3">the adoration of the relic of the hair-crestjewel in heaven. The inscription (on the roof) reads, sudhamm? deva sabh? and bhagavato c?da maho\ van Kooij comments, The word mahas is the keyword in this inscription. It is a festival that is represented. Another inscription [...] indicates the setting of this festive gathering, viz. Indra's palace. The wording of these inscriptions refers to both the festival itself and its legendary background [...]'. I am afraid I cannot fully agree. The artist has represented the legend itself, as it is narrated, e.g. by the Lalitavistara (a festival is established by the Tr?yastrimsa gods for the Buddha's hair), not a festival re-enacting that legend. Why should he make this second? hand choice? and, if he actually had done so, why should he draw the onlookers' attention to the fact that the building is the deva-sabh?? On the other hand we can perhaps agree with Professor van Kooij when he says, 'Changes took place at the beginning of the Christian Era when both iconic and aniconic formulas were introduced. The first Buddha images and the first representations of a true [empty] seat or throne are contemporary'. We can perhaps agree, provided the words 'iconic and aniconic formulas' are substituted by 'anthropomorphic and non anthropomorphic formulas'. This is a very sensible suggestion by van Kooij: before the beginning of the Christian era Buddhist art was in an aniconic phase, in the sense that there were no icons of the Buddha. The real novelty was not in making the Buddha man-like, rather in representing him at all! ? this is a good starting point for an important discussion. 'Pilgrimage and the evidence of Bodhgaya's images' (pp. 45-57) by Janice Leoschko provides a survey of the images in the Mah?bodhi Temple and its compound. The connections between the pilgrimage and the artistic production both in the P?la and the later periods are highlighted. Another somewhat preliminary though very useful contribution is the one by Claudine Bautze-Picron, 'Between men and gods: Small motifs in the Buddhist art of eastern India, an interpretation' (pp. 59-79). It is an attempt to identify those 'minor' subjects which appear on some rectangular slabs and at the base of stelae, being either motifs of general meaning, or related to the iconography of the depicted deity, or implying a 'protective' meaning, or even depicting objects connected with the cult performed or offered to the deity. '[...] one can rightly consider' ? the authoress concludes ? 'that those carvings evoke, through some of their motifs, the link between the human world and the divine reality'. A rarely studied subject in Tibetan art is taken into consideration by Jane Casey Singer, 'Early portrait painting in Tibet' (pp. 81-99). Portraiture appears to be particularly prominent in Tibet between c. 1000 and 1400 A.D., its function being also that of showing the leaders of sectarian groups as legitimate successors of acknowledged spiritual authorities. As one would expect, Tn rendering Buddhist hierarchs, artists frequently relied on iconography already established for the portrayal of Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and other deities, an observance justified by the Tibetan perception of their religious leaders as living Buddhas and bodhisattvas'. Roger Goepper ('The role of the icon in different layers of Shingon ritual, exemplified by the figure of Aizen-My??, pp. 101-9) provides an acute analysis of images and texts which leads to a better understanding of how an image was built up 'step by step' on the grounds of speculative considerations. H. Hunter's contribution deals with the 'Five Secrets mandala' (pp. 111-24), i.e. the Gohimitsu mandara of the Japanese esoteric Buddhist pantheon. 'The depiction of M?ra in early Buddhist art' (pp. 125-34) by Prithivi K. Agrawala is a useful survey of the iconographic solutions proposed by early Indian Buddhist artists in order to represent the god M?ra, identified, up to a certain extent, with the god of love Kama. Images of Kama on terracotta plaques of the 1st century B.C. to the 1st A.D. are compared with reliefs from Sanchi, Amaravati, Mathura, etc. depicting the M?radharsana and temptation scenes. Adalbert Gail in his paper, 'Manjusrl and his sword' (pp. 135-38) tries to demonstrate that 'it is possible that the sword is the interpretatio indica of the Chinese discussion staff, since the Indian iconography is thoroughly familiar with the sword whereas the discussion staff was unknown to it'. According to Gail, 'The conception and representation of Manjusrl carrying a sword, 208</page><page sequence="4">however, became so prominent that he returned to China with it and displaced the discussion staff. As the iconographical characters of this Bodhisattva are apparently so fluctuating, I wonder why Gail seems so ready to exclude that the Gandharan Bodhisattvas with a book can be identified as Manjusrl (as proposed by A.M. Quagliotti, EW, 40, pp. 99-113), on the grounds that 'the consequence of this view would be that the production of Manjusrl image stopped at the end of the Gandh?ran school of sculptures (4th/5th century) and was taken up only two or three centuries later, both in Bihar and Nepal, in quite a different manner [...]'. There follow three nice papers on special iconographical subjects ? 'Lokesvaras in Nepal. A living tradition?' (pp. 139-48) by Margriet Blom, 'Ruixiang at Dunhuang' (pp. 149-56) by Roderick Whitfield, and 'The role of legend in Kory? iconography (I) The Ksitigarbha triad in Engakuji' (pp. 157-65) by Youngsook Pak. Nandana Chutiwongs, 'The role of narrative sculpture and painting in Thailand' (pp. 167-78), provides a brief survey of Buddhist narrative representations up to the present days, when European influence on imagery and space structure is strongly felt. 'Buddhist art and ritual: a view from the west' (pp. 179-95) by Robert W. Serieller is the sensible reflection of an historian of European art on what he heard during the seminar about the art of eastern Asia. Differences and similarities are opportunely highlighted by the author. The last paper, 'Comparative iconology: a sociobiological approach' (pp. 197-204) by Jan Baptist Bedaux employs the tools provided by sociobiology for explaining some of the most widespread (and at the same time most intriguing) iconographies from Europe and Asia ? the erect penis is certainly one of the best known among them. The author inclines to explain it not so much as a symbol of fertility, rather as the representation of a ritualized display of the male sex, which obviously involves the concept of protection of a given space. Bedaux's final suggestion is perhaps worth a brief comment. He says, 'In my opinion, it is particularly this quality of the phallus [a sign of victory, a mark of strength] which makes it understandable why Siva-Rudra could emerge into a phallus and become a linga. Maybe I should express myself more carefully. The powerful destructive forces of Siva, Siva as Bhairava [...] may just as well, maybe even more, be linked to the linga as the aspect of fertility'. This is certainly very interesting and one has to keep these words in mind when trying to interpret Indian ithyphallic deities ? but the linga is something more: it is not only a symbol of fertility, it is also the origin of all things, a sort of primordial egg. From Siva's linga Siva himself is born. The mystery is more profound than we would expect until we think of fertility on one side, wrath and protective power on the other. Any pebble can appear as the linga to the devotee: in raising it in a sacred spot or in making a spot sacred by raising the pebble in it, the devotee performs a gesture that involves his whole being, beyond any care for fertility or immediate protection. An Index of Buddhist names and terms (pp. 205-12) completes this thought-provoking collection of essays. Maurizio Taddei ?</page></plain_text>
