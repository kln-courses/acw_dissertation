<plain_text><page sequence="1">HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES Copeta 2010, No. 2, 334-340 Clarence Lavett Smith David Smith1 far as we know, the subject of this perspective and its author are not related, although the parallels in our lives are remarkable. We grew up in neighboring communities in western New York State, and our mothers were both schoolteachers. We attended the same university, and were drawn into the study of fishes by the same major professor. We even ended up doing research on the same tiny Caribbean island. The subject does, however, retain exclusive rights to the nickname "Smitty," by which he is universally known, and which the author concedes on the basis of priority. As a final coincidence, the author's brother and family live outside Denver, Colorado. That is how we found ourselves at Smitty's house in nearby Colorado Springs, enjoying the hospitality offered by him and his wife, Marj. The Smiths live in a spacious, split-level house on a quiet, tree-lined side street, close enough to the main highway to be convenient, but far enough off to be away from the noise and commotion. On a clear day, which is most of the time in Colorado Springs, Pike's Peak dominates the western horizon, as it did for the explorers and settlers who passed through the area in the 19th century. On the August day that we visited, the air was clear, dry, and comfortably warm, altogether a perfect place to spend a summer day and listen to the story of a life in ichthyology. Clarence Lavett Smith was born on 19 December 1927 in Hamburg, New York, a small town about ten miles south of Buffalo, the only child of Clarence Lavett Smith, Sr. (ca. 1895-1961) and Mildred Gaeckle Smith (ca. 1895-1971). His father worked for many years at the Bethlehem Steel plant in nearby Lackawanna but took early retirement and thereafter operated a small farm in Orchard Park. Living in the country and working around the farm gave Smitty an introduction to nature. In high school, he had a particularly influential biology teacher who helped him develop his interest in science. Although Smitty was not much of a joiner during his school days, he was active in the Boy Scouts, reaching the rank of Eagle Scout. This was during World War II, and when his scoutmaster went into the Army, Smitty became the acting scoutmaster by default. What he remembers most about this experience is that it convinced him that he never wanted to be an administrator when he grew up. After graduating from high school, Smitty enrolled in the New York State College of Agriculture at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. At the time, he thought he might become a veterinarian, and Cornell was well known for its college of veterinary medicine. It was also, as Smitty admits, one of the few colleges he knew anything about. Although his mother had graduated from the state teacher's college in Buffalo, no one else from his family had ever attended a college or university, so he had no direct experience with Fig. 1. C. L and Marjorie Smith, Colorado Springs, 2008. any of them. As a resident of New York State, Smitty would be eligible for the low in-state tuition rate, another important factor. It proved to be an excellent decision. Cornell at that time had a particularly strong program in zoology, or, as it would be called today, "organismal biology." Among the prominent faculty members were the herpetologist Albert Hazen Wright (1879-1970), ornitholo- gists Arthur A. Allen (1885-1964) and Peter Paul Kellogg (1899-1975), the mammalogist William J. Hamilton, Jr. (1902-1990), the comparative anatomist Perry W. Gilbert (1912-2000), and the ichthyologist Edward C. Raney (1919- 1984). Although he arrived with vague intentions of study- ing veterinary medicine, his first zoology course convinced Smitty that his true interest lay there, and he never applied to vet school. The most influential figure in his undergraduate career was undoubtedly Raney. Zoology at Cornell was then undergoing a kind of generational transition. The best- known faculty members at the time were probably Wright and Allen. Wright had authored, along with his wife, Anna, authoritative books on snakes and anurans of North America. Arthur Allen had made Cornell into one of the leading centers of ornithological research in the country. Both, however, were aging, and their best work was behind them. Raney, on the other hand, was a rising star who was gathering an outstanding group of graduate students around him. More than one student who had come to Cornell because of its reputation in ornithology was converted to ichthyology by Raney's dynamism. Raney had an ability to recognize talent in students, and he gave them the opportunity to pursue their interests. Indeed, the "Cornell School" of ichthyology was rivaled only by Stanford Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of Natural History, MRC-159, Washington, D.C. 20013-7012; E-mail: smithd@si.edu. © 2010 by the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists 0 DOI: 10.1643/OT-09-192</page><page sequence="2">Historical perspectives 335 ) y University and perhaps the University of Michigan in the number of influential ichthyologists that it turned out during those years. It was also a place where an under- graduate could feel welcome and be a part of the enterprise. Among the students there at the time were Robert H. Gibbs, Jr. (1919-1988), C. Richard Robins, Royal D. Suttkus, Richard H. Backus, Roland Wigley, Ralph W. Yerger (1922- 2003), Paul K. Anderson, and Max Hecht. The summer after his junior year, Smitty worked as a seasonal aid for the New York State Conservation Department on a trouble-shooting crew in the Adirondacks It was here that he discovered his love of field work, a passion that was to characterize his entire career. The next summer he worked in a fish hatchery at Elk Grove, California. After graduating from Cornell in 1949, Smitty enrolled at Tulane, where, through Raney's assistance, he obtained a scholarship to work on the effects of water hyacinth control on fish populations. The work involved both experimental studies and field surveys. The experimental work involved a series of small ponds, each stocked with fish that would then be treated with predetermined amounts of pesticide. Unfortunately, the ponds were near the water table and were difficult to pump out. In addition, some local muskrats had decided to dig their burrows there, providing a passage for fish to move from one pond to the next. Smitty found that many of the fish he had put in one pond soon turned up in adjacent ponds. That part of his thesis work was a failure, but he salvaged the project by working on fishes that occurred around water hyacinth beds in open water. Had he arrived at Tulane a few years later, he could have joined Royal Suttkus's ichthyology group, but Suttkus only arrived near the end of Smitty's time there. However, he was able to join the group that was carrying out a herpetological survey of Louisiana, and that gave him a chance to get into the field. This group included Alan Chaney, Richard Etheridge, Donald Tinkle (1930-1980), Ernie Liner, Sam Nichols, and Paul K. Anderson. His graduate advisor was the herpetologist Fred Cagle (1915-1968). After receiving his M.S. from Tulane in 1951, Smitty entered the University of Michigan for his Ph.D. studies. Like Cornell, Michigan was an important center of ichthyol- ogy. Carl L. Hubbs (1894-1979) had been there for many years, and although he had long since departed for California, several other eminent ichthyologists remained, including Reeve M. Bailey, Robert Rush Miller (1916-2003), Karl F. Lagler (1912-1985), and John Bardach (1915-2001). As his advisor, Smitty chose Reeve Bailey, a decision he says he never regretted. Bailey was an excellent mentor who gave his students plenty of leeway to plan and carry out their own studies. Smitty feels that this is a much better way to handle students than to oversupervise them. At Michigan as at Cornell, he joined a talented group of graduate students, including Carter R. Gilbert, William Ralph Taylor (1914- 2004), R. Jack Schultz, Howard Huddle, Carl Bond (1920- 2007), Carl Riggs, Carroll Norden (1920-2003), Jorge Carranza, Howard Winn (1926-1995), Conrad Istock, Don Thomson, Don McAllister (1934-2001), Teruya Uyeno, and Gerald Smith. He initially intended to work on feeding in minnows, but in 1954 he was drafted and had to interrupt his studies for a two-year tour of duty in the U.S. Army. What seemed at the time like an unwelcome impediment to his career turned out to be a lucky break. The Army sent him to Puerto Rico, where he was assigned to a civilian malacologist who was working on the snail hosts of Bilharzia. This was Smitty;s first experience with the tropical marine environment, and it made a lasting impression on him. He spent his spare time collecting and observing fish and in the process discovered and described two new species of blennioid fishes (Smith, 1958). Upon returning to Michigan, he found that John Bardach had started a fisheries research program in Bermuda. Groupers made up a large part of the Bermuda commercial fishery, and they are notorious for their different color phases. Bardach wanted someone to examine their taxon- omy. Inspired by his experience in Puerto Rico, Smitty decided to make that his Ph.D. project. One of the first problems began as an attempt to answer a simple question. Did the different color phases represent sexual dimorphism? When he started looking at gonads, he soon discovered that he could not tell male from female in any of the smaller specimens he looked at. He took some of the samples back to Michigan and sectioned them. Every one turned out to be a female. This did not seem to make sense, so the following year he collected a larger sample of gonads and examined them microscopically. He eventually found that they all start out as females and later transform into males. This had been reported a couple of times in the literature, but no one had ever followed up on it. As part of his Ph.D. work, he also conducted field research at the Lerner Marine Laboratory in Bimini, Bahamas. Later, at Bimini, he would expand his survey to cover more of the Serranidae. He found that essentially all serranids practiced hermaphroditism of some type. The epinephelines were protogynous, starting out as females and then changing to males later on. Serranines, on the other hand, were synchronous, often alternating male and female roles in mating behavior. The type of hermaphroditism, therefore, reflected systematic relationships. Interestingly, the genus Morone, then considered a serranid, showed no sign of hermaphroditism. We now know that Morone does not belong in the Serranidae at all, and its lack of hermaphrodit- ism was probably telling us that all along. During his time at Michigan, he took advantage of several opportunities to broaden his scientific horizons and increase his experience and expertise. In addition to the field work in Bermuda and the Bahamas, he spent the summer of 1952 working on a paleontological dig in western Kansas under the direction of Claude Hibbard (1905-1973). The site was located in a series of Pliocene and Pleistocene fossil beds that contained abundant fish bones. Smitty remembers this as one of his most productive summers, and it helped form his ideas of what he wanted to do. Hibbard made a lasting impression on Smitty, who remembers him as a truly memorable character. Smitty recalls that although he had a rustic manner, he was a very inspiring teacher. "Somebody once said that if you want to know who is an effective professor/' Smitty observes, "you walk down the hall at night and you find the office with the open door and a bunch of graduate students in there. That was Hibbard/' Smitty initially signed on to Hibbard's summer field project as the camp cook, for which his talents were questionable at best. Fortunately for all concerned, Hib- bard's wife decided to come along at the last minute, and cooking appealed to her far more than digging dirt. Smitty, on the other hand, greatly preferred the digging part, so the two switched responsibilities. Following his graduation from Michigan in 1959, he stayed on for two years on a grant obtained by Bailey. This</page><page sequence="3">336 Copeia 2010, No. 2 involved studies of the dorsal fin supports (Smith, 1961) and the subocular shelf of fishes (Smith and Bailey, 1962). The next year, he was presented with the opportunity to go farther afield when he obtained a two-year contract to teach at the College of Guam in the western Pacific. This was Smitty's first experience outside the Atlantic. He did some collecting there and sent the material back to Michigan. After completing the first year of his contract in Guam, another opportunity opened at the University of Hawaii, where William A. Gosline (1915-2002) had taken a leave of absence for a year. The University needed someone to fill in for Gosline, and Smitty made himself available. He taught ichthyology and did some collecting with the class. The two years at Guam and Hawaii gave him a good introduction to tropical Pacific fishes. The study of coral-reef fishes would occupy a good portion of his research time in the years ahead. In 1962, an even better opportunity presented itself, this time at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York City. The process of filling positions was considerably less formal in those days than it is today. Instead of search committees, interviews, and seminars, decisions were often made simply through personal con- nections. It so happened that Reeve Bailey knew the Director of the AMNH, James Oliver (1914-1981). The previous Director had been Albert Eide Parr (1900-1991). Although he was an ichthyologist who had written many papers on systematics, Parr was not interested in collections and put no effort into building and supporting the collections at AMNH. Charles M. Breder (1897-1983) was the ichthyologist at the time, but he was not interested in collections either. Oliver wanted to change that situation and had recently hired Donn Eric Rosen (1929-1986) as a curator of fishes. Oliver also wanted to add another ichthyologist to the staff and was looking for a suitable candidate. Bailey recommended Smitty, who interviewed for the position and was hired. He would spend the rest of his career there. When Smitty arrived at the AMNH, he joined Breder and Rosen as the ichthyological curators. Breder retired soon afterward, leaving Smitty and Rosen as the resident ichthyologists. They were soon joined by James W. Atz as Dean Bibliographer. Atz was charged with resurrecting the immensely valuable Dean's Bibliography of Fishes, which had not been updated since its publication in 1916. A meticulous scholar, Atz was an excellent choice for this job and produced two volumes (1968 and 1969) of the new Dean Bibliography of Fishes. Unfortunately, the program failed to find financial support and had to be discontinued. Rosen was one of the most influential systematic ichthyologists of the later 20th century and would have an enormous impact on the classification of fishes and on the science of biological systematics in general. Along with Gareth J. Nelson, who arrived some ten years later, he would be a leading proponent of phylogenetic systematics. Although Smitty greatly admired Rosen and respected his work, he made a conscious decision not to work closely with him. Rosen had a strong personality, and Smitty could see the possibility of disagreements and conflicts if he were to work in the same area. He decided instead to carve out his own research programs. Equally important, Smitty wanted to get out into the field, and the AMNH operated a field station, the Lerner Marine Laboratory at Bimini in the Bahamas. Smitty took full advantage of the facilities at Bimini, and much of his early work at AMNH was conducted there. Also, it was there that he began his long-running collaboration with James C. Tyler, then at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. At the time, the Academy was carrying out a survey of the shore fishes of the Bahamas, a project that would culminate in the publication of the classic "Fishes of the Bahamas" by James E. Böhlke (1930- 1982) and Charles C. G. Chaplin (1906-1991). As Böhlke was then doing the taxonomic work on Bahaman fishes, Smitty and Tyler decided to focus on community ecology. Patch reefs form discrete units spatially isolated from other such units and are thus ideal for the study of coral-reef fish communities. Smitty's work on community ecology progressed in three distinct stages. The first and most basic step was to inventory the fishes that inhabited these patch reefs. Many of the fishes can be surveyed visually, but many others spend most of their time out of sight, hidden within the structure of the reef. These fishes can be sampled by using small quantities of rotenone on individual patch reefs or coral heads. Through experiment, Smitty found that a single rotenone station recovers, on average, about 75% of the species present. This coverage can be refined through resampling; three successive treatments of the same area would increase the coverage to about 90% of the species present (Smith, 1973). Rotenone has the advantage of breaking down rapidly in seawater, and the treated area will then be resettled by fishes arriving from surrounding areas. Smitty found that after about nine months, the fish population in a treated area had returned to its original state. In the process of conducting these surveys, Smitty was necessarily learning to know and recognize all the fishes he encountered. Indeed, there are few people today who know the West Indian coral-reef fish fauna as well as Smitty does. This expertise was vital in carrying out the next stages of his field studies. Sampling coral reefs with rotenone will tell you what species live there, but nothing about how they behave and interact. How do the various species divide the resources among themselves? How does morphology and behavior equip a species to occupy a particular ecological niche? Obtaining answers to these questions requires continuous observation over an extended period of time. When the animals in question live underwater, however, the observer is limited by the air supply he can take with him. In practical terms, this means an hour or so two or three times a day. In deeper water the problem is compounded by the need to allow time for the excess nitrogen to escape from the blood without forming bubbles. The solution to this limitation arrived with the various underwater habitats that were constructed beginning in the 1960s. The goal was to provide a place where observers could live for extended periods of time without having to come to the surface. The atmosphere in the interior of the habitat would be held at ambient pressure, thus providing a place where divers could stay between dives without having to worry about decompres- sing after each dive. Their blood would remain saturated with nitrogen throughout their stay in the habitat. They could dive as often as they wanted and stay as long as they had to, returning to the habitat to sleep and eat. All the decompression would be done at the end.</page><page sequence="4">Historical perspectives 337 ) The habitats came along at just the right time for Smitty's community ecology studies. Having learned what fishes occurred on the patch reefs, he could now undertake extensive observations on what they did and how they interacted with each other and with their environment. His first project involved the Tektite program, operated jointly by NASA, the Office of Naval Research, and the Department of the Interior. Tektite was inspired in large part by the space program and was designed to test the effectiveness of scientists working under isolated living conditions. This had implications for NASA's Skylab program, which was just getting started. Skylab would be the follow-up to the Apollo program, and would involve astronauts working for ex- tended periods in an earth-orbiting space station. Tektite was a good bargain for all concerned. The scientists would get a chance to spend long periods of time at their studies under the sea, and the agencies in turn would get to study how the scientists reacted to living and working under those conditions. Smitty joined Jim Tyler for a 17-day mission at Tektite II in the Virgin Islands in September-October 1970. Living in the habitat required some adjustment. Smitty recalls that early in the mission Jim attempted to boil some water for tea. After some time, the water still had not boiled. Thinking something might be wrong with the heater, Jim tested the water with his finger. At that moment he was reminded the hard way that increased atmospheric pressure raises the boiling point of water. Their study area was a patch reef approximately three meters on a side, at a depth of 11-12 m. Observations were made both day and night, and detailed notes were made on some 72 species. In many cases, they could recognize individual fish and follow their movements and activities over the course of the study. In a way, they became part of the fishes' world, living with them day and night for more than two weeks (Smith and Tyler, 1975). Over the next eight years, Smitty participated in several more saturation diving projects, in Florida, the Virgin Islands, and the Bahamas. One of these involved excursions as deep as 250 feet. To Smitty's disappointment, the habitat program eventually wound down and was essentially discontinued. The advent of remote viewing technology was deemed to make manned habitats obsolete, but there is really no substitute for human observers on the scene. During his work on the HYDROLAB project in the Virgin Islands, Smitty became interested in the larvae of the fishes living on and around coral reefs and the processes by which they settle from the open-water community and take up residence in the benthic community. He would take up this subject in more detail later. In 1969, he returned to the Pacific for the first time since leaving Hawaii some seven years earlier. He joined Jim Tyler on an expedition to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. The ostensible purpose of the trip was an attempt to recover the cannons jettisoned by Capt. James Cook during his voyage there in 1770. The ship was partially grounded on a reef, and in an effort to lighten her, excess equipment such as the deck cannons, was thrown overboard. While the sponsors of the trip were mainly interested in the cannons, Jim and Smitty were far more interested in collecting fish, which would provide a good justification for the expense if the cannons were not found. As it turned out, everyone got what he wanted. The cannons were successfully recovered, and the two ichthyologists made a nice collection of fishes, which they split between their two institutions. The following year, he had the opportunity to collect fishes in the Austral and Society Islands in French Polynesia. Smitty was largely on his own here, and the results were limited, but these were some of the first fish collections ever made from islands such as Rapa. In 1976, he joined Victor G. Springer and Thomas H. Fraser in sampling another poorly known location, St. Brandon's shoals in the Indian Ocean. Other collecting trips to the Indo-Pacific included Guam and Palau in 1971, the Galapagos Islands in 1978 aboard the R/V Alpha Helix, and the Ninigo and Hermit Islands in Papua New Guinea, also in 1978 and also with Vic Springer. With the Lerner Lab closed and the underwater habitat programs winding down, Smitty had to find other places to do his research. Much of his field work in later years was done at the Smithsonian Institution's laboratory at Carrie Bow Cay on the barrier reef at Belize, along with his old sidekick, Jim Tyler. Jim had come to the Smithsonian in the late 1980s as an interim director at both the National Museum of Natural History and the National Air and Space Museum. As a break from his administrative duties, Jim had begun doing research at the field station in Belize. Carrie Bow Cay is an island about the size of a football field that sits on the outer edge of the largest barrier-reef system in the Atlantic. A few hundred meters to the east, the outer ridge rises almost vertically out of the depths of the Caribbean. To the west lies the extensive lagoon system between the reef and the mainland, dotted with islands and mangroves. A wide variety of habitats are accessible within a short distance of the laboratory, making it an ideal location for research of all kinds. It was particularly suitable for the kind of behavioral and ecological work that Jim and Smitty enjoyed doing. It was almost like being in the underwater habitats, with study sites literally at their doorstep. His work at Carrie Bow Cay, which spanned the years between 1986 and 2001, comprised three main areas of research. One of these was a continuation of the behavioral/ ecological work that he had long been doing with Jim Tyler. Among their principal study animals were blennioid fishes such as Emblemaria pandionis (Smith et al., 1998). His second area of emphasis involved inshore ichthyo- plankton, a study he had begun some years earlier in the Virgin Islands (Smith et al., 1987). Carrie Bow Cay proved uniquely suitable for these studies. At night, fish larvae are picked up and swept across the reef crest by the wind-driven east-to-west current. A plankton net set in the small, shallow lagoon on the windward side of the island will collect larvae in substantial numbers, all of them in excellent condition and many even alive. They can then be taken to the nearby laboratory to be studied at leisure. Smitty produced descrip- tions and drawings of some 300 larval and juvenile fishes. The final project involved a survey of the fishes of the Pelican Cays, a group of islands a few km south of Carrie Bow Cay that is home to a distinct ichthyofauna. This took place between 1997 and 2001 and was Smitty's last major field work. He worked in collaboration with Jim Tyler, William P. Davis, and Robert S. Jones, together forming a sort of over-the-hill gang who proudly referred to them- selves as the "60+ Club." Smitty himself was nearly 70 when the project began. The resulting publication (Smith et al., 2003) provides a good framework for a checklist of the marine fishes of Belize.</page><page sequence="5">338 Copela 2010, No. 2 Smitty did not limit his field work to faraway islands and coral reefs. He also devoted a substantial amount of time and effort to studying the fishes of his native New York State. In fact, this was among the work he most enjoyed. Working as he did at the AMNH presented something of a paradox. On the one hand, he was studying nature; on the other hand, he was working in one of the most unnatural places on the face of the earth, New York City. The fishes of New York project gave him the chance to get out of the city and enjoy the natural beauty of New York state. During summers from 1975-1982, Smitty and his students sampled fishes from every part of the state. Their goal was to collect, at least once, every species known to inhabit the state. They would load up their station wagon and head to the selected destination, usually choosing to go during the week to avoid the crowds. They would camp, eating breakfast and lunch on the run in order to make the most of their time, but they would always make a point to eat dinner at, as Smitty puts it, "the best restaurant that would have us." The result of all this work was The Inland Fishes of New York State (Smith, 1986). In addition to his curatorial and research duties, Smitty has been continuously involved with education. He very much enjoys teaching and working with students. In New York, he was on the adjunct faculty at City University of New York (1971-1997), Rutgers University (1981-1988), and C. W. Post College (1977-1985), where he taught courses and supervised graduate students. Through its association with local universities, the AMNH has produced a signifi- cant number of students who have gone on to successful careers themselves. Smitty has supervised nine M.S. and five Ph.D. students. Besides his teaching activities in New York, he has spent many summers as a visiting professor at such institutions as Ohio State University, the University of Oklahoma, and the University of Michigan. His longest association has been with Ohio State's F. T. Stone Laboratory on Lake Erie, where he first taught a summer course in 1959, and then again in 1963-66, 1971-72, and 1994-2004. Public service and outreach have always been an im- portant part of Smitty's life. He believes that scientists have a duty to communicate their findings to the public. To that end, he has written a number of popular articles and books. His articles have appeared in such magazines as Natural History, Audubon, Oceans, International Wildlife, and Underwater Naturalist. His popular books reflect his two greatest areas of expertise, New York State inland fishes (Smith, 1986, 1994), and Caribbean reef fishes (Smith, 1997, 2000). He has served on boards and advisory councils for such organizations as Museum of the Hudson Highlands, the Closter Nature Center, the Hudson River Environmental Society, the Bahamas National Trust Advisory Council, the Hudson River Fisheries Advisory Committee, Hudsonia Limited, and the Friends of Fishes Scientific Advisory Board. On a more personal level, Smitty and Marj have served as museum representatives on some 20 Discovery Tours run by the AMNH between 1977 and 1997. Smitty lectured on fishes and led snorkeling on coral reefs. They traveled to Fig. 2. Field work in Kansas, 1 952.</page><page sequence="6">Historical perspectives 339 J such varied places as the Caribbean, Indonesia, Burma, India, Egypt, Singapore, Thailand, Australia, French Poly- nesia, the upper Amazon, western South America, and the islands of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and South Georgia. Since retirement they have traveled to higher latitudes including Alaska and Antarctica. Eventually, Smitty realized that he could best serve the AMNH by retiring. He continued at the Museum as curator emeritus while he and Marj decided where they wanted to live. Finally, in 1997 they settled in Colorado Springs near Marj's sister where they had visited numerous times over the years. In his retirement, Smitty has found time to indulge in one of his favorite hobbies: writing fiction. When he was a youngster working around his family's farm, he used to amuse himself by making up stories. He neglected this during his working years, but lately he has taken it up again. When he is writing, Smitty says he often has no idea what will come next; the story just seems to appear and write itself. Like most successful writers, Smitty draws on his experience and knowledge in choosing his subject matter. One novel that he has completed involves a retired professor who leads a group of students on an expedition to explore an underground stream in a western state. The story involves what they find there. Another book-length manu- script is intended for young readers and involves a series of fables about fishes. The anthropomorphic characters teach the reader something about the fishes concerned. One fable features Larry the Lamprey. He spends his early years living happily in the bottom sediment eating plankton and detritus. Then one day, he notices that he is growing teeth; he also notices a big fish nearby and starts to think that it might be good to eat. He also realizes that he doesn't have jaws like the other fishes. At first, he feels bad about that, but then he sees a bass grab a hook and disappear overhead. "If this was what jaws got you, who needs jaws?" One of his more unusual experiences in retirement occurred when he became interested in the Western Museum of Mining and Industry, which was located in Colorado Springs. He admits he knows little about either mining or industry, but he did have the experience of working in a museum all his life and figured that he could be useful in some way. He inquired about it and was offered a position on the collections committee and eventually became a Board member. All went well at first, but then the museum ran out of money and the director retired. Smitty was on the search committee for a new director, and after sorting through the list of candidates, many of whom were totally unqualified, they settled on a candidate who had experience and training in museum administration. Disillusionment soon set in when it became apparent that the individual in question was trained as a businessman and had no particular expertise in museums. Costs had to be cut, and the new director decided to address this problem by firing the curator. Predictably, the museum went down the road to becoming an entertainment center. Although successful in this enterprise, the museum was no longer a true museum. Rather than using the collection to strengthen the educational mission, the museum simply mothballed the collections. Thus an important opportunity was lost. Smitty eventually ended his association with the institution, although he still attends its programs from time to time. Fig. 3. At Bimini, 1971. He also enjoys working with his hands and has always had a well-equipped workshop at home. He has put this talent to good use in his research. For example, in his study of Emblemana pandionis with Jim Tyler, he made an artificial blenny that could raise and lower its dorsal fin on command. He also enjoys boatbuilding, and two of his home-made boats are sitting in his garage now. In Colorado Springs, of course, it is a bit more difficult to get into the water than it was when he lived near the Hudson River in New Jersey. Smitty met his wife, Marjorie, at Michigan, where they were both graduate teaching fellows. They were married in 1954 just after he completed basic training in the Army. Their two children, Robert and Laura, were born while Smitty was in graduate school in Michigan in 1957 and 1959, respectively. Prior to meeting Smitty, Marj had taught high school biology in Guam and had numerous friends there, so when the family went to Guam in 1960, it was a sort of homecoming for her. Robert, who has a masters in creative writing, is now a paraprofessional teacher and published poet in San Francisco, and Laura, who lives in Fort Collins, CO with her husband and three children, has her masters degree in geology and now volunteers in the local schools. Smitty first joined ASIH around 1948 while he was a student at Cornell. He attended his first meeting in 1952 at</page><page sequence="7">340 Copela 2010, No. 2 Fig. 4. Seining in Michigan, 1976. Austin, TX. He served on the Board of Governors in the classes of 1967 and 1974. Over the course of his career, Smitty has produced some 126 publications, both technical and popular, including seven books. When asked to rate his most important contributions, Smitty would put his work on hermaphrodit- ism in groupers near the top, along with his behavioral work. Without question, the activity he has enjoyed most over the years has been his field work, both the underwater work and the freshwater collecting in New York. Thinking about the changes that have taken place in the field since he was a student, Smitty has some mixed feelings. On one hand, he is somewhat disappointed in today's students. He finds that they often lack the broad back- ground and the library skills that they need, preferring to use the internet as a shortcut rather than take the time to familiarize themselves with the literature in their field. On the other hand, he is impressed by the many new techniques such as computer technology and molecular analysis that are available today. These will greatly enhance our ability to assess relationships and phylogeny. When he started out in ichthyology, the study of phylogeny and higher relationships was in the doldrums. That all changed during the cladistic revolution, spearheaded by his col- leagues Rosen and Nelson at the AMNH, and now it is a vibrant and active field that Smitty finds very exciting. On the whole, then, he is optimistic about the future of ichthyology. One area that particularly interests him is the mid-depths of the ocean, between the limits of scuba diving and the abyssal plain. This is a largely unexplored region that undoubtedly contains many interesting discoveries. New technologies will greatly enhance our knowledge of what occurs there. Postscript - C.
