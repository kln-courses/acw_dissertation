Welch ABSTRACT We analyse the extent of possible computations following Hogarth ([2004]) conducted in Malament-Hogarth (MH) spacetimes, and Etesi and Nemeti ([2002]) in the special subclass containing rotating Kerr black holes. Hogarth ([1994]) had shown that any arithmetic statement could be resolved in a suitable MH spacetime. Etesi and Nemeti ([2002]) had shown that some V3 relations on natural numbers that are neither universal nor co-universal, can be decided in Kerr spacetimes, and had asked specifically as to the extent of computational limits there. The purpose of this note is to address this question, and further show that MH spacetimes can compute far beyond the arithmetic: effectively Borel statements (so hyperarithmetic in second-order number theory, or the structure of analysis) can likewise be resolved: Theorem A. If H is any hyperarithmetic predicate on integers, then there is an MH spacetime in which any query In e W. can be computed. In one sense this is best possible, as there is an upper bound to computational ability in any spacetime, which is thus a universal constant of that spacetime. Theorem C. Assuming the (modest and standard) requirement that spacetime manifolds be paracompact and Hausdorff for any spacetime M there will be a countable ordinal upper bound, w(M), on the complexity of questions in the Borel hierarchy computable in it. 1 Introduction 1.1 History and preliminaries 2 Hyperarithmetic Computations in MH Spacetimes 2.1 Generalising SADn regions 2.2 The complexity of questions decidable in Kerr spacetimes 3 An Upper Bound on Computational Complexity for Each Spacetime 1 Introduction Hogarth ([2004]) has shown that not only any universal statement, such as ' Goldbach's Conjecture, but any arithmetical statement can be resolved in finite © The Author (2008).

Welch time, in a suitable Malament-Hogarth (MH) spacetime (these are defined in Section 1.1 below). Our commentary has two strands: first, that there is no reason for Hogarth to stop at first-order statements of arithmetic: effectively Borel statements (so hyperarithmetic in second-order number theory, or the structure of analysis) can likewise be resolved (Section 2): Theorem A. If H is any hyperarithmetic predicate on integers, then there is an MH spacetime in which any query In e HI can be computed. In fact for any transfinite Borel statement about the integers, one can define an MH spacetime in which the statement can be resolved. In one sense this is best possible, as a second strand, there is an upper bound to computational ability in any spacetime, which is thus a universal constant of that spacetime (Section 3). The following is merely an observation: Theorem C. Assuming the (modest and standard) requirement that spacetime manifolds be paracompact and Hausdorff for any spacetime M there is a uni- versal constant, which will be a countable ordinal upper bound, w(M), on the complexity of predicates in the Borel hierarchy computable in it. Etesi and Nemeti ([2002]) noted that some V3 relations on natural numbers that are neither universal (V) nor co-universal (3), can be decided in certain MH spacetimes (instantiated by rotating Kerr black holes) and they ask specifically as to the extent of computational limits in such spacetimes. Theorem B. The relations RC.N computable in the spacetimes of (Etesi and Nemeti [2002]) form a subclass of the ^-relations on N; this is a proper subclass if and only if there is a fixed finite bound on the number of signals sent to the observer on the finite-length path. This is treated in Section 2.2. 1.1 History and preliminaries Pitowsky ([1990]) gives an account of an attempt to define spacetimes in which supertasks can almost be completed - essentially they allow the result of in- finitely many computations by one observer Or (he used the, as then unsolved, example of Fermat's Last Theorem) performed on their infinite (i.e., endless in proper time) world line y\ , to check whether there exists a triple of integers xk + y* = z* for some k &gt; 2 as a counterexample to the Theorem or not. If a counterexample was found a signal would be sent to another observer Op travelling along a world line yi- The difference being that the proper time along y2 was finite, and thus Op could know the truth or falsity of the Theorem in a</page><page sequence="3">The Extent of Computation in Malament-Hogarth Spacetimes 661 (for them) finite time, depending on whether a signal was received or not. As Earman and Norton ([1993]) mention, there are problems with this account not least that along yi Op must undergo unbounded acceleration. Malament and Hogarth alighted upon a different spacetime example. The following definition comes from Earman and Norton ([1993]): Definition 1. M - (M, g.d\,) is a Malament-Hogarth (MH) spacetime just in case there is a time like half- curve y\ C M and a point p € M such that f dx - oo andy\ C /"(/?)• (Here r is proper time.1) As they remark this makes no reference to the word-line of a receiver of messages Op travelling along a y^, but point out that there will be in any case such a future-directed timelike curve yi from a point q e I~(p) top such that f , ,dr&lt;oo, with q chosen to lie in the causal future of the past endpoint of yi. As Hogarth showed in ([1992]) such spacetimes are not globally hyperbolic, thus ruling out many 'standard' space-times (such as Minkowski space-time). Earman and Norton's diagram of a 'toy MH space- time' is shown in Figure 1 . Hogarth's perhaps more succinct picture is on the right. To rerun (and update) the Pitowski argument: the proper time along y\ is in- finite, thus a Turing machine can be programmed to look for counterexamples to the Goldbach Conjecture (or any other proposition involving a single univer- sal quantifier over an unqualified matrix: VnP(n)) by checking P(0), P(l), . . . each of which in turn only takes a finite amount of time; if a counterexample is found a signal is sent out to the observer Op travelling along the finite proper time curve yi- If no signal is received by the time Op reaches/? then Op knows that the Conjecture is true. Either way Op is supposed to have discovered the truth by this point. To obtain a spacetime as above, they take Minkowski spacetime A/o = (K4, fob) and choose a scalar field ft, which is everywhere equal to 1 outside of a compact set C, and which rapidly goes to +oo as the point r is approached. The point r is removed and the MH spacetime is then M - (K4\{r), gab), where gab = Q2rjah. Q and y\ can be chosen so that y\ is a timelike geodesic. Earman and Norton discuss at length the physical possibilities and diffi- culties of this scenario: Godel spacetimes are MH, but are causally vicious; the toy spacetime above need not satisfy any energy conditions; anti-de Sitter spacetime is MH, but fails a strong energy condition; Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime meets this but, as in all MH spacetimes, there is divergent blue-shift of the signal to Op and further, of the unbounded amplification of signals that 1 We conform to the notation of Hawking and Ellis ([1973]) and so / (p) is the chronological past of/?: the set of all points q from which a future-directed timelike curve meets/?. The spacetimes, all derived from Malament and Hogarth's ktoy spacetime', are differentible manifolds with a Lorentz metric gat&gt;, and are time-oriented.</page><page sequence="4">662 P D. Welch Figure 1. A basic SAD spacetime construction (left) with its pictorial shorthand (right). Op may have to receive, etc., etc. It is not our aim here to add to this discus- sion on physical viabilities but to make some observations on the purely logical possibilities and boundaries of this kind of arrangement. Logicians accordingly calibrate the complexity of propositions in the lan- guage of arithmetic by the following hierarchy: Definition 2 (Arithmetical Hierarchy). Call a predicate Pc^5]0 or n0 i/P is recursive; P c Nk+l is in £„ iff Nk+l\P is in Un; if P c Nk+{ is in Un then Q = {fa, . . . , ak)\3b e N(ft, &lt;n, . . . , ak) e P] c Nk is in Ew+1. A recursive predicate may be taken as one given by the extension of a quantifier-free formula of the language of arithmetic. (We sometimes iden- tify predicates, and their extensions, with their characteristic functions, and shall implicitly assume in the future that for each k there is a recursive bijection rk : Nk &lt; - &gt; N .) Deciding whether P(n) holds for a recursive predicate is then performable by a computer or Turing machine in finite time.2 Hogarth ([1994]) (and in the later work ([2004])) uses the right-hand diagram of Figure 1 above as a kind of short-hand for a component of larger processes. He calls this a 'SADi spacetime' or region. A segment of spacetime such as the above can be used to decide membership of any n i or E i definable set of integers (just as the set of even integers which satisfy Goldbach's conjecture is a So set, so the statement of Goldbach's conjecture forms a FIi sentence, whose extension is a truth value, i.e., is 0 or 1). If a spacetime contains a sequence 0 = (Oj \j &gt; 0) of non-intersecting open regions such that (1) for all j &gt; 0 Oj c I~(OJ+\) and (2) there is a point p e M such that V/ &gt; 0 O; c I~(p) then O is said to form a past temporal string or just string. To decide membership in a rh-definable set of integers P(n) = Va3bQ(a, b, n), he then stacks up a string of SADj regions 2 As explicitly here for monadic predicates, but also via the coding functions r^, for any fc-ary predicate also.</page><page sequence="5">The Extent of Computation in Malament-Hogarth Spacetimes 663 Figure 2. A SAD3 region as a past temporal string of SAD2 regions and its tree representation (right). Oj, each looking like a component from the right-hand side of Figure 1, with Go being used to decide BbQ(0, b, n), if this fails a signal is sent out to Op; but if this is successful, a signal is sent to O\ to start to decide 3bQ(\, b, n) etc. Ultimately, putting this all together, again Op receives a signal if -&gt;P(n), or else knows after a finite interval that it is true. It should be noted that Assumption 1. The open regions Oj are disjoint, and that no observer or part of the machinery of the system has to send or receive infinitely many signals ('no swamping' - we shall call this Assumption 2). This whole region is then dubbed a 'SAD2' spacetime. A 'SADn+i' spacetime is defined accordingly as composed from an infinite string of (again disjoint) SADW regions On, again all in the past of some point p. (Earman and Norton ([1996]) show that a SADi spacetime cannot decide n2 statements. See the discussion in Section 2.2 for what can occur if an arbitrary but finite number of signals can be sent from the observer Or to p : if the spacetime is SADi then A2 questions are resolvable. Hogarth ([2004]) followed up Earman and Norton ([1996]) with the generalisation that SAD, cannot decide n7+i statements.) In Figure 2, if each On is SAD7 then the diagram on the left is that of a SADy+i region. On the right is the underlying tree structure of a SAD3 region for computing queries of the form In e A? for some E3 set A: each circle represents a SAD2 region which can be used for computing the answers to E2 queries, and contains an infinite string of SADi components (pictured by the terminal nodes of the tree) which appeared above at (the right-hand side of) Figure 1 . Definition 3. A spacetime (M, ga\&gt;) is an arithmetic deciding (AD) spacetime just when it admits a past temporal string of disjoint open regions O = ( Oj \j &gt; 0) with each Oj a SAD/+1. An AD spacetime is then a suitable manifold in which the truth of any arith- metical sentence, or statement concerning any integer n, can be determined.</page><page sequence="6">664 R D. Welch Again the various regions are connected in such an inductive manner that no points receive infinitely many signals, and in (Hogarth [1994], p. 131 following) prima facie reasons of how the 'hardware' fits into the regions concerned are given. An initial Turing machine is thought of as 'control' of the process, in that, for example, it signals to activate the appropriate S AD7 region to compute the answer when given as input a query whose complexity is Fly. To actually define the AD spacetime, we may adapt the toy spacetime example above so that every component of our SAD regions contains future directed half-lines approaching some 'removed' point such as r above. Hogarth actually takes a closed inertial line segment v inside C, rather than a single point r; all the components of the SAD regions are appropriately arranged around v so that they intersect it. Now Q is chosen to rapidly approach +oo as v is approached, and the segment v is removed. The spacetime is then XAd = (^4\v, ^2^ab) (see Hogarth [1994], p. 133). 2 Hyperarithmetic Computations in MH Spacetimes Our first remark is that this only scratches the surface of what is possible in such spacetimes. The question of how far one can proceed in the arithmetical hierarchy is also raised and discussed by Etesi and Nemeti ([2002]). Our thesis is that one can decide questions far beyond arithmetic in suitable spacetimes (Theorem A). However, as we shall see, under the mild assumptions that spacetimes are modelled by Hausdorff and paracompact manifolds (Hawking and Ellis [1973], p. 14), no one spacetime can decide all Borel questions (Theorem C). 2.1 Generalising SAD,, regions First a definition: let f= (?, &lt;^&gt; = &lt;!^&lt;f\ 2) be the tree of all finite se- quences of natural numbers ordered by reverse inclusion (thus the empty sequence (&gt; is the topmost element of this tree and we view it as growing downwards as sequences are extended). Members of T are thus finite func- tions: v = (u(0), v(l), . . . , v(k)) with each v(i) € N. Definition 4. A finite path tree is any subtree (T, &lt;T) of f where all branches under &lt;T are of finite length. We assign ordinal ranks to the nodes of a finite path tree (which we shall call just trees from now on) by induction: the terminal 'leaves' at the end of the branches are given rank zero, and in general the rank of a node u € f^J&lt;N is the least strict upper bound of the ranks of the nodes u, which extend the sequence u. The rank of T is then the rank of the empty sequence, (&gt; , the topmost node. The point is that the tree, although all branches are of finite length, is in</page><page sequence="7">The Extent of Computation in Malament-Hogarth Spacetimes 665 Figure 3. A finite path tree representation of an AD spacetime. general infinitely splitting (a given node u may have infinitely many immediate one step extensions); hence ranks of nodes can in general be infinite, but of countable ordinal height (for an account of this and the following context, see, e.g., Rogers [1967], Section 15.2). We are less interested in the tree as being composed of finite sequences of natural numbers, but rather the graph of the tree, or what it looks like: the finite sequences simply give an informative way of indexing the nodes of the tree. We shall be affixing other labels to the nodes of such trees. Since an AD spacetime consists of an infinite string of regions Oj where each is a SAD7+i spacetime region, which itself (if j &gt; 0) is a string of SADy spacetime regions, we can picture an AD spacetime by the finite path tree in Figure 3. Finite path trees can be used to describe the construction of sets in the Borel Hierarchy of sets of reals numbers. By 'the reals' here we mean infinite strings of integers from N, thus elements of Baire space NN topologised by the product topology on the discrete topology of l\l.3 A basic open neighbourhood in this topology is a set of the form Ns =df {x e NN\s c x] where s e N&lt;N is a finite initial segment of x (thus if s is of length k, s(i) = x(i) for / &lt; k). We define in marginally greater generality the Borel hierarchy in the space M x f^JN where l\l has the discrete topology and again the product topology is taken on this with the f^N. A basic open neighbourhood here can be taken as Ns =df {(«, x)6f^Jx NN\s{Q) = n a s(i + 1) = *(/) for i + 1 &lt; lh(s)}. Definition 5.

Nothing that we do, or analytical problems that we attempt to solve in such spacetimes, depends on any geometric consideration, or on the usual Euclidean metric on the real continuum.</page><page sequence="8">666 R D. Welch X=(Jn An where each An e n^ for some £„ &lt; f ; a set X is Borel if X e E$ for some countable ordinal £ . (Here cX is the complement of X.) It is well known that such a hierarchy is (1) proper, that is E$ ^ n$ for f &gt; 0, and with both S$, n^ c S$+i for all % &lt; o)\, where the latter is the first uncountable cardinal number, and (2) the hierarchy terminates at co\ : EWl+i = EWl . It is easy to reason that for any set Xc. N x f^lN, if it is Borel, and let us suppose that £ is least with Xe S$, then, as per (iii), there are infinitely many An (possibly with repetitions) so that X- |JW An. We may then grow a finite path tree with Xat the topmost node, then, infinitely splitting the tree below this node we have at the next level down, the sets A$, A\ , . . ., which occur at lower levels in the hierarchy. Each of these is in some n^ (with £„ least) and below the node for An either (1) we place a single node labelled with cAn if in fact An £ E^; or else (2) An e E^ and the tree infinitely further splits with nodes below that of An labelled for Bm where An = Uw Bm and each Bm e Ylu for some fm &lt; £„. In this way we can consider Borel sets as built up according to a recipe, that can be described by a finite path tree (finite because the ordinals are well founded) where the determining labels are the (at most countably many) basic open sets attached to each of the end nodes of each branch (and the appropriately constructed sets labelling the nodes higher up, although of course the whole tree-labelling is determined by the tree structure and the assignment of basic open sets at the terminal nodes). As the reader can work out for himself or herself, Ew+i predicates P of integers can be obtained by a process that can be given by a diagram that has the structure of a tree of rank 2« + 1 (the So sets are at the bottom at rank 0, Ei occupy the next layer up, 111 then occurs at the rank 2 next level after that; then come E2 sets having rank 3, and so on; the Ew+i set P occupies the node labelled by the empty sequence). The arithmetic sets are those that can be built up using basic open sets in a finite number of stages: they are those sets of finite rank: symbolically Arithmetic = \Jn Ew. Hogarth's AD spacetime is thus needed to calculate answers to membership questions of the form In e 5? where S ranges over arithmetic sets. The reader can probably now surmise what is going to happen: one can form sets of integers Selo, that are not arithmetic: they are countable unions of arithmetic sets but there is no finite bound on their definitional complexity. Such are represented by trees with no finite bound on path length, but have infinite rank. Actually one construal of an AD spacetime is that it could answer questions of the form ?« € 5? for some 5eEw: such an S= \Jm Tm where each Tm is arithmetic. If we assume (by expanding the list of Tm if need be with dummy sets Tk = 0) that each rm e Em we may query if n e Tm for each m in turn, where the mth component of the AD spacetime is charged with answering this question.</page><page sequence="9">The Extent of Computation in Malament-Hogarth Space times 667 Again if some m is found for which n e Tm then a signal may be sent to the final observer. Notice that the tree structure in Figure 3 could equally well be used to describe the components of the AD spacetime and the compositional structure of the set S.A Why just some Ew sets S in the above? Because the sequence of sets (Tm\m e N) may not be recursively, or effectively given to us. The description of this sequence may itself be beyond the computational powers of us or our spacetime- regions. Accordingly, we first focus on a hierarchy of sets that can be given an effective or algorithmic description. This special class of sets of integers are well known and are called the hyperarithmetic sets (cf. Rogers [1967], Section 16.8 or Sacks [1990]): these are formed by protocols that can be represented by finite path trees of recursive ordinal height, where the terminal nodes are labelled with a recursively given list of basic open sets.5 Alternatively put, the underlying recursive finite path trees T are themselves the outputs of a subset of the class of all Turing machines. (We thus imagine the machine outputting an integer k if, under some suitable computable coding, k codes the fact that u &lt;T v where the sequence v is an initial segment of the sequence u in the tree T). In short, the hyperarithmetic sets are those where there is a recursive description of their construction via finite path trees. We may imagine then, in analogy to an AD spacetime, for a given hyper- arithmetic set S, a spacetime SAD 5, which consists of a suitable piece of the manifold where there is a tree structure of computational components reflect- ing the construction of S from recursive (in topological terms, basic open) sets. An initial 'control' machine is given n (the integer on which the query is based), together with e, the code of the machine, which outputs the recursive tree structure Ts of the set S being queried. The spacetime has been chosen so that its open regions Of correspond to this recursive tree structure and so to the subqueries that arise, and these will be arranged as nested subregions in a way reflecting precisely the structure of Ts (just as a SAD, region is physically arranged or chosen so that it can answer Ey or Y\j queries). The adaptation of the toy spacetime construction for the case of an AD spacetime is the same as for any SAD5 spacetime: it simply is a matter of ensuring that the line segment v intersects each of the regions of the components appropriately. We can be more specific in this regard: Hogarth needs a plentiful supply of points where the metric goes rapidly to +00. In defining a SAD2 region an 4 Although the tree structure for an arithmetic set is slightly expanded vis a vis the AD structure, as a SADy+i region can calculate truth values of both Ey and n7 statements, whereas drawing a tree for a n, set adds one rank over an L, set, but this is a non-essential difference and may be ignored. 5 Recall that a recursive ordinal is one for which there is a Turing machine Pe that will compute a set of integers W that codes in some sensible fashion, a well-ordering, &lt; w, of a set of integers of length or order type that ordinal. There is a least ordinal countable ordinal which is not so representable, and is known as o&gt;{k (read 'Church-Kleene-omega-l').</page><page sequence="10">668 R D. Welch ^-sequence of points (r/|/ &lt; co) is needed, which will eventually be removed from the manifold, but towards each of which the metric goes to +00 and there is some qt with /"(#/) containing an endless half-line approaching r; ; for a SAD3 region each of the ^-sequence of SADi regions is replaced by a SAD2 region (which in turn contains an ^-sequence of removed points); thus a sequence of points of order type co2 = co x co, where the metric goes to +00, is needed. Sim- ilarly a SAD7+i region requires, according to the Hogarth construction, an coj sequence of such points, and an AD region an coa)(= supy coj) sequence. Now suppose S is hyperarithmetic and (T, &lt;T) is the recursive subtree of (f^J&lt;f\ 2) whose structure corresponds to the construction of S once a recursive assign- ment of recursive sets has been attached to the terminal nodes. We may embed the tree in a (1-1) &lt;7-order preserving fashion into the countable ordinals by some function n : T - ► On so that u &lt;T v implies n(u) &lt; n(v). We may do this by using the Kleene-Brouwer ordering on (f^&lt;f^, 2): u &lt;kb v if for the least i so that u(i) ^ v(i), either v(i) is undefined, or both u(i), v(i) are defined and u{i) &lt; v(i). It is routine to check that if T is a finite path tree, then the Kleene- Brouwer ordering restricted to T is a well ordering, and hence is isomorphic to some countable ordinal 0 = 6{T) &lt; co\ . We map each node u e T via &lt;kb \ T and the isomorphism just mentioned, to an ordinal n(u) &lt; 0. We may then recreate a spacetime with the tree structure of T by using Hogarth's method on a sequence of points r8 (8 &lt; 9(T)) for each of which, as approached, the metric will go off to -hex). As any countable ordinal can be embedded into a (finite) closed line segment, this is unproblematic. This sequence of points will be eventually removed. If 8 = n(u) and u has infinitely many immediate tree &lt;t extensions v of the form v = u ^ (n), then 8 will be a limit ordinal and the local region we may be visualising, Ou, will contain at the next level down the infinitely many subregions Ov for v of the above form. Formally, then we may regard the spacetime construction as one performed by induction on the T-rank of nodes u g T when defining the regions Ou. We attach a Turing machine to all nodes of rank 0, and if rankj-(w) = a, then we gather all imme- diate extensions of the form v = u - («&gt;, (which have rank &lt; a) and connect these region-components Ov according to the KB-ordering on such v: in other words, iff/ = u ^ («,) for / e co enumerate such, then we 'connect' the regions so that OVi lies in I~(qVj) iff f, &lt;kb Vj (iff «; &lt; rij) just as in the left-hand part of Figure 1, with the components approaching some point ru =df rn(u) with the latter in I~(qu) where qu =df q^u) is some suitable point. In other words, given the finite path tree structure, we may define the spacetime inductively from it. We formally state this argument as: Lemma 1. Let (T, &lt;^) be a finite path tree of rank a. Then there is a MH spacetime with regions Oufor u e T, with points qu, so that (i) ifv&lt;Tu then Ov c Ou and Ov c I~{qu);</page><page sequence="11">The Extent of Computation in Malament-Hogarth Space times 669 (ii) if Vj = u ^ («/&gt; i &gt; 0, enumerates the one-point extensions of u with u ^ («/&gt; e T, and i &lt; j - &gt; «, &lt; «7 then there is a past temporal string of regions O = (OVj\j &gt; 0) with distinguished points qj € OVj, and qu e Ou, with [qVi] U OVi C I~(OVj), and OVj C I~{qu) connected as in Figure 2. Proof. The Lemma may be proven as an induction on a. Let v,- = («,•) enu- merate those one-point extensions of (&gt; with nt in increasing order. For a given / the restriction of &lt; ^ to the subtree of nodes in T extending vf , TVi , is a subtree of rank less than a. By induction we may construct suitable pieces of an MH spacetime corresponding to those subtrees; call these O\ = Ov. . As Hogarth does for the AD spacetime, we may consider these constructions done so that the 'removed points' rv. lie along some closed line segment v where the metric will go off to +oc, and then we string them together to form a past temporal string. Alternatively, the construction can proceed directly again by induction but along the Kleene-Brouwer ordering restricted to T. QED (Lemma 1 and Theorem A) Note, for a later discussion, that the construction does not require that the finite path tree T be recursive: we may define the connections and the regions by induction on the rank of nodes in any such T. An alternative description of hyperarithmetic sets may prove helpful: suppose B c,N. Let xb € 2N be its characteristic function. A code for B is any function /€ ^N so that either: (i) /(0) = 0 and V/i(/(/i + 1) = xbW); or (ii) /(0) = 1 and there is a code g for N\B, and V/i(/(/i + 1) = g(n)); or (iii) /(0) = 2 and there is a sequence of sets (Ck)keN and a sequence of reals fk e NN so that/* is a code for C*, v/ithVnVk(f(r2(k, n) + 1) = fk(n)\ and lastly B = \Jk Ck. By (i) trivially any set has a code! However, the hyperarithmetic sets can be characterised as precisely those sets S that possess a recursive code.6 If S is hyperarithmetic, we may think of the recursive code /as given by an index e e N for some Turing program Pe. This latter program computes /(0) and, to take the more interesting case, if it is 2, Pe proceeds to compute values of the recursively given list of recursive functions fk - which we may consider as themselves given by their index numbers ek. (Thus, inter alia, the sequence (ek)keN is itself a recursive list.) Hence from e we may envisage a control program indexed by some e which takes a query In e Sel and if /(0) = 2 it computes the recursive list (ek)keN of 6 Of course this is not to say that S is itself recursive, it is just that its construction has a recursive description. The set of codes of hyperarithmetic sets is not recursive, or r.e., or even arithmetic, it is complete nj (see the next footnote).</page><page sequence="12">670 P. D. Welch indices of codes, passing n and these indices to each in turn of an infinite list of machines at the next level down; these machines compute ^(0) in turn, and act according to the 0,1,2 outcome. Eventually, as the terminal leaves in the tree are reached, the last code is that of a basic open set, and any such is recursive. We conclude: Proposition 1. If (et\i e N) enumerates those indices of Turing programs that 'construct' in the above sense hyperarithmetic sets &amp;,- , via recursive trees, we may define a single MH 'hyperarithmetically deciding', HYPD, spacetime region in which any query of the form In e &amp;,? can be answered in finite time. In the above, we may define the HYPD region by piecing together parts of spacetime that are iSei -deciding' just as an AD region can be so defined: an overall control machine can take (/, n) as input and activate the z'th ma- chine constructing &amp;,. . It is worth emphasising that no machine in this tree array is itself performing 'supertasks' (i.e., performing infinitely many ac- tions in its own proper time), but if it issues a signal to another process, it does so only once after a finite amount of its own proper time. How- ever, a tree structure for such a region can no longer have recursive ordi- nal height, as it can be shown (again see Rogers [1967]) that the ranks of finite path trees constructing hyperarithmetic sets exhaust all the recursive ordinals. Thus an MH spacetime may be able to calculate 'beyond' any hy- perarithmetic set, but the spacetime structure is not realised by a recursive tree. Moreover, as noted above, any finite path tree can be realised in an MH spacetime: thus there apparently is no a priori upper bound on computational complexity. 2.2 The complexity of questions decidable in Kerr spacetimes Etesi and Nemeti consider a special class of MH spacetimes, Kerr spacetimes, which contain rotating blackholes. (The reasons, which we shall not discuss, why they choose this particular spacetime, is that the physics of communication between the observer moving along an infinite y\ to that on yi is less problem- atic. This is further elaborated in Nemeti and David [2006].) Their Proposition 1 shows, just as Hogarth ([1992]) did, that any Ej predicate can be decided in their arrangement. They also obey Assumption 2 that there is no swamping, and in fact, initially at least, the observer Or travelling along y\ only sends a single signal to p on yi. They further remark though (Proposition 2) that in fact the set-up allows for resolving of queries In e R! for sets slightly more complicated: R can be taken as a union of a Ei and a 111 set - and thus need not be in either class. Indeed they indicate an argument at Proposition 3 that if the observer Or is allowed to send k different signals, (they take k = 2) then any fc-fold Boolean combination of Ei and FIi sets R = r\i&lt;k-\(si u pi) (with</page><page sequence="13">The Extent of Computation in Malament-Hogarth Spacetimes 671 Sl e Ei and Pl e l\\) can be decided. They ask how far in the arithmetical hierarchy this kind of argument can be taken. The classes of predicates just indicated all fall within A2 (=df £2 n n2). However, even allowing k to go to oo will not exhaust this class. The class of A 2 predicates can be characterised using Turing machines that may write to an output tape a single 0 or 1 digit, which the machine may, however, later change (this class was studied, and so characterised, by a number of persons: Davis, Gold [1965], Putnam [1965]). Definition 6 (Putnam [1965]) R c 1^1 is a trial-and-error predicate if there are Turing machines Ado, M\ of this sort so that (i) each of Aft, M\ changes its mind about its output at most finitely many times, for any input n, and (ii) n e R &lt;=^ the eventual value of Aft 's output tape on input n is 1 n £ R &lt;&lt;=&gt;&gt; the eventual value of M\ 's output tape on input n is 0. We then have that R C N is A2 if and only if it is a trial-and-error predicate. Can Etesi and Nemeti's analysis of Boolean combinations of universal and co-universal predicates be extended to trial-and-error predicates? The answer has to be no, if the machinery is required to only send a fixed number of signals to p on y2: the observer r on y\ m&amp;y now run two Turing machines Aft, Mi of the above type, and may send a signal Sl to p each time Mt changes its output digit, but crucially we do not know in advance how many times that will be. It is not that/? will or may receive infinitely many signals (so it is not 'swamping' that is the problem), but that p will have to be prepared to receive a potential infinity of signals of one type, if the arrangement is to resolve A2 predicates. It is not hard to show that there are A2 predicates R so that for any representation in terms of machines of the type Mt above, there will be no recursive functions /• so that f(n) bounds the number of times that Mt changes its mind about input n. (Hence for deciding A2 -predicates, it is not just that we cannot do this if there is a fixed k on the number of alternations allowed for any n as input; we cannot even, given the input «, run some other initial recursive test on n to determine in advance what the k = k{n) should be for this particular n.) However, if we relax this fixed bounding assumption on the number of signals that can be transmitted to p (but still require the number to be fi- nite so that Assumption 2 holds) then both these spacetimes (and also SADj spacetimes) can compute A2 (but not in general E2) predicates. We summarise this discussion as: Theorem B. The relations Re. N computable in the Etesi-Nemeti models form a subclass of the ^-relations on N; this is a proper subclass if and only if there is a fixed finite bound on the number of signals sent to the observer on the finite-length path.</page><page sequence="14">672 P D. Welch 3 An Upper Bound on Computational Complexity for Each Spacetime There are only countably many hyperarithmetic sets (as there are only countably many recursive trees) whilst there are uncountably many non-recursive finite path trees. However, Hogarth's construction of AD spacetime regions, which we have extended to hyperarithmetic deciding regions, only depends on being able to take the 'toy' spacetime construction at the beginning and reproduce that in a suffiently nested manner in order to create more and more complicated regions. It is possible that a piece of an MH spacetime has a region that reflects the structure of a finite path tree that is not recursive: given any finite path tree T one can 'construct' an MH spacetime M t satisfying the requirement that its SAD components reflect the structure of T. The reader may very well have several objections at this point (if not well before): (1) that in general we may have no way of conceiving of a 'problem' or 'calculation' at an arbitrary level of complexity in this hierarchy; that (2) if we could we would not be able to initiate, or 'control' the hardware for the problem (or even locate the relevant spacetime region in which it could be performed!). Just to consider the objection (2) first: I think this problem already arises for an AD spacetime: this contains an infinite string of Turing machines, that whilst acting independently to some extent in their own patches of spacetime Oj, and not swamping each other with messages, cannot conceivably be 'set up' or initialised by finite beings in a finite time, to perform the task in our mind. Hogarth imagines the machinery all set up and ready to go: it is just waiting for our input and the switch to be thrown. However, we can imagine that here too. For (1): we can readily conceive of, or think up, mathematical questions about Sw or Sw+W or SW2 ... for larger recursive ordinals; the questions are more likely to be intimately related to those ordinals, rather than some general problem in number theory. Indeed, it is not clear anyway what the class of hyperarithmetic sets is: for example, we are unable to enumerate them in any effective way: we may define them as those sets built up using those Turing machines Pe. which output codes of finite path trees, but in fact we have no effective or algorithmic way of knowing of a given index e whether Pe does or does not code a finite path tree. In general, whether Pe codes a (not necessarily finite) path tree is itself a 111 property of e but that it codes a finite, that is, a well-founded path tree is far even from arithmetic.7 Supposing we did actually have a part of our spacetime that was HYPD (and we could recognise it!) then given an integer n we would not know in full and absolute generality, which indices e it is suitable to even ask In e Sel However, this is not really the point 7 The set of indices coding finite path trees is a complete FI [ -set of integers: it thus requires a universal function quantification in analysis, or second-order number theory (see for example, Rogers [1967], Theorem XX).</page><page sequence="15">The Extent of Computation in Malament-Hogarth Space times 673 of the argument: we are looking at logico-mathematical boundaries to these kinds of spacetimes (and not anthropomorphic limitations). Any set of integers 5cf\J whatsoever can be seen as resolvable by a SAD spacetime region containing a finite path tree structure T with an assignment of basic open sets, i.e., recursive sets, to the terminal nodes: it is the case that we can cheat and hardwire the answers to queries concerning B into the very structure of the tree ^beforehand (just as any set B indeed has a code according to the definition above, but again for trivial reasons). At least we shall not have uncountably many worries of this sort as the following arguments show. Definition 7. Let M = (M, gab) be a spacetime. We define w(M) to be the least ordinal r\ so that M contains no SAD region whose underlying tree structure has ordinal rank rj. Note that 0 &lt; w(M) &lt; co\ (0 = w(M) implies that M contains no SAD re- gions whatsoever, that is, is not MH; the upper bound of co\, the first uncount- able ordinal, is for the trivial reason that every finite path tree is a countable object and so cannot have uncountable ordinal rank). Proposition 2. For any spacetime M, w(M) &lt; o)\\ thus w(M) is always a countable ordinal. Proof. We here use only general assumptions on our manifolds: Assumption (1) that for different rj the different SAD,, components occupy disjoint open regions On of the manifold, and (2) that the manifold is separable (which follows from paracompactness and being Hausdorff). Let X c Mbe a countable dense subset of M. Then each open region On of M contains members of X. As disjoint regions contain differing members of X there can only be countably many such regions On c M, and therefore a countable bound. □ (Of course this is only the generalisation of the argument that in U there can only be countably many disjoint open intervals of the form (a, b)\). This proposition is thus our Theorem C. Consequently, if our spacetime Mo happens to be MH, then for some count- able universal constant of our universe, w(Mo), the possible 'calculations' theoretically performable all have complexity bounded by w(Mo)- We let the reader muse on what they believe the true value of w (Mo) might be.
