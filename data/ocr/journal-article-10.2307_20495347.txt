<plain_text><page sequence="1">Are We Twigging democrats? By CARL L. WILSON (Probably the teachers and administrators of every public school in America believe they are producing democratic citizens. And, by any one of several defi nitions of democratic, they are. But, if we accept one fairly rigorous operational definition of democracy, we may wonder about the number and kind of demo crats we are producing. Here is the definition: democ racy occurs whenever those persons who will be equally affected by a decision exercise equal responsi bility. in making the decision. After pondering the implications of that definition, we should be ready to consider such questions as, Are we producing that kind of democrats? Would it be good for them and for society if we did? Could we do it if we wanted to?-C. L. W.) I. WHAT DEMOCRATS? HREE recent experimental studies of emer 1 gent leadership indicate that the college stu dents of America prefer autocratic leaders.to dem ocratic ones.1 The most recent of the three studies reports that emergent leadership from 32 inter actions, 45 minutes long, involving 135 students, was associated with autocratic behavior at almost the .05 level, was negatively related to laissez faire behavior at the .25 level, and was not re lated to democratic behavior at even the .50 level.2 However, the interactions were described by the participants as about three-fifths demo cratic, one-fifth autocratic, and one-fifth laissez faire. With democratic leadership available, the students chose autocratic. Furthermore, the auto crats to whom they yielded leadership were recog nized as the most influential persons: the group mean of a measure of estimated exerted influence was related to the measure of emergent leader ship at the .01 level. Lewin's classification of so cial behavior was used: the autocrat controls others for his own purposes, the democrat co operates with others for common purposes, the laissez-faire person refrains from interaction for * Carl L.

On the basis of these three studies, particularly the last one, are we not justified in raising the question, What democrats? II. THE "LOWER CASE" DEMOCRAT Although the "lower case" democrat has not yet been produced in any experimental study that has come to this writer's attention,4 he can be conceived of as a person who (1) participates (2) for integration. He is not an asocial laissez faire spectator, nor is he an anti-social autocrat who participates for domination. He is distin guished from the "upper case" "democrat" who is concerned primarily with the "democratic forms" of "public discussion," "free and open debate," and "parliamentary procedure." The "upper case" "democrat" accepts a majority vote as democratic, but the "lower case" democrat knows that majority votes-although often ex pedient-are far short of consensus and integra tion. He is willing to engage patiently in joint inquiry and group discussion because his purpose is integration, not domination. He can occasion ally be observed in action in small unorganized peer-groups. If by chance anyone should discover him-and it will be by chance, like "discovering" a beautiful sunrise-he may observe that the "lower case" democrat is not interested in wheth er he is a leader or a follower, for his purpose is not domination of others but integration of him self and others into a satisfactory group adjust ment to some group problem. "Leadership" in such a group may change "hands" as rapidly as a basketball in a fast game. III.

Only one leadership and fol lowership occur during democratic interactions. The other eight influences occur in dominating interactions and are differentiated by the nature of the sanctions available to the leaders. The head man in a formal organization, such as a school superintendent, has the power to hire and to dis cipline as well as to persuade. His ability to rely on democratic leadership alone is restricted to the ability of the persons in an interaction to "forget" that he has official power. The leaders in two different6 informal organizations, the activity centered sociotele, such as a sand-lot football team, and the personality-centered psychetele, such as a student clique, have the power of with holding acceptance and the power to persuade. The fourth type of dominator operates in unor ganized peer-groups through his power of ma nipulative persuasion; he uses ambiguous sug gestion, arouses non-adaptive emotion, and re sorts to distorted evidence and reasoning in his manipulation of the peer-group for his own ends. The fifth leadership, democratic leadership, oc curs in unorganized functional peer-groups and consists, apparently, primarily of clarifying and proposing and secondarily of understanding and accepting; democratic followership consists, ap parently, primarily of understanding and accept ing and secondarily of clarifying and proposing. Democratic leadership unsullied by domination can occur only in unorganized groups because the process of organizing is the process of differenti ating responsibilities: the abrogation of certain responsibilities by the many and consequent dele gation of those responsibilities to the few. At first sight, it appears that teachers and administrators must be dominators, and, indeed, they must-to some extent. But those dominators who wish to let in a few bright rays from the beautiful sunrise of democratic leadership can do so by re-delegat ing some of their decision-making authority to small advisory bodies representative of all those persons who will be affected by the decisions. Although democratic leadership so far has eluded the experimenter and will elude all but the most patient observers, it is not illusive. It can be found and can probably be created-most easily in peer-groups but also in organizations. IV. DEMOCRATS AT A DISCOUNT Topsy of Uncle Tom's Cabin "just growed," but widespread democratic leadership won't. It will have to be deliberately planted in a favorable culture, nourished, cultivated, and matured. Until a "natural crop" has been harvested, seed-stock can apparently be produced only by mutation, "accidental" or contrived, and by "grafting" upon the prevailing autocratic growth. But there are certain perils in the production of democrats and certain pitfalls in the practicing of democracy. A. THE PERILS OF PRODUCING DEMOCRATS Any headman, such as a teacher, who proposes to "mutate" or to "graft" democrats will find a sequence of problems, rhymed, with reason, as motion, emotion, and commotion. The problem of motion arises as soon as the teacher tries to move the students from their accustomed laissez faire spectator role as listeners to the unwonted and usually unwanted-role as participant inte grator of goals, activities, supplies, and evalua tions. However slowly the twigging of democrats occurs, there comes a day when every student real izes, usually with penetrating pain, "This means work; this means me." Then is when the emotion starts. Prodding the laissez-faire off his haunches produces pain, but halting a bolting autocrat in his tracks is akin to roping a wild stallion: a ram pant dominator must be "captured," "domesti cated," and "harnessed" to the civilized work of integration. "Breaking" a confirmed autocrat into a democrat produces agony, an agony not often borne in silence. Then is when the commotion starts, a commotion that may spread outside the dassroom. However, the mutation of democrats is not all thorns; there are some roses who unfold with such alacrity and beauty that their enthusiasm radi ates to others and mutates them, leaving only a few self-oriented and insecure laissez-faire and autocratic thorns gouging the body democratic. B. THE PITFALLS OF PRACTICING DEMOCRACY Economic headmen of the nation deplore the dearth of leaders to hire. Industrial, commercial, military, and even scholastic headmen apparently want to hire manipulative peer-persuaders, endow them with official power, then reap the rewards of democratic leadership. They confuse the super ficial thrills of a game of "post office" with the MAY, 1953 ? Wilson, ibid.

And what happens to the young democrat, who knows the advantages of integrated decisions and frets at autocracy, when he secures a position in a "conservative" school or business? Probably the loudest charge hurled at "progressive" schools is that they are "subver sive"; they graduate young people who "cannot take orders," who won't "cooperate," who lack "discipline," who don't want to "work" as their fore-fathers did. Personnel directors point to the rapid turnover of young employees; Sunday sup plements print articles stating that "personality' conflicts account for most job separations. Some how, it is made to seem, the schools are at fault. And the young democrat, starting perhaps his ninth job in four years, is inclined to agree that schools are "subversive," that they unfitted him for the economic life he found. He may want to bite the hand that twigged him. If the production of democrats is dangerous to the assembly-line and if they circulate at an eco nomic discount, why bother? V. THE HIGH COST OF DOMINATION Whenever two or more persons with different purposes interact until some joint-decision is reached, they can interact in only two modes: domination or integration. (A compromise, such as a majority vote, may integrate some but deny, i.e., dominate, others.) An analysis of consider able evidence reveals in study after study-no ex ceptions were found-that domination is inferior to integration. Apparently the attempt to domi nate produces defensive reactions of fight or flight. Energy spent in struggle or escape cannot be spent on the group-task. Accompanying the restricted task-involvement of dominating interactions are consequent thwarted creativity, attrited morale, and confused direction. Even if the dominator suc ceeds in concealing his motives and methods and thereby avoids antagonism, the resultant restricted and misleading communication prevents a real grappling with the group-task, precipitates lower morale, and yields a mal-adjustive structure and direction of group energy. Can a democratically oriented culture with its back to the wall afford the high cost of domination? Although the evidence indicates that democrats of the kind being discussed here are exceedingly rare, it also indicates that approximations to the ideal democrat suffer a bloody birth, lead a bat tered existence, but nevertheless brighten the cor ners where they are. How can we produce enough democrats to permeate every decision-reaching group and generate complete involvements with the group-task, release the creative potential of every participant, achieve the greatest morale and the dearest sense of direction? VI. THE TWIGGING OF DEMOCRATS ToMoRRow! Because no one has yet twigged democrats in a measured experiment, no functional correlates of democratic leadership can be reported with demonstrable validity. But by analyzing the known correlates of emergent autocratic leader ship, certain hypotheses about democratic leader ship can be derived. The three experimental studies of emergent leadership,8 although not en tirely similar, do not contradict each other in any important respect; they do support and supple ment each other. Seven functional variables were associated with emergent autocratic leadership at the .05 level or better. They were (1) partici pation, (2) with ideas considered worthwhile by group members (all measures were from group member's rankings and ratings of each member), (3) in appropriate speech habits, (4) the assump tion of chairmanship functions, (5) the stating of a superior goal, (6) superior approved so lutions, and (7) being liked as discussion par ticipants (leaders were highly chosen as future discussion companions). The correlations, though significant, were low and accounted for only a fraction of the total leadership. Measures of the ability to state standards for judging goals and goal-paths were found to be not significantly re lated to autocracy.9 It is hypothesized that, in addition to the seven functions already listed, democratic leaders will be able to (1) state standards for judging goals and goal-paths, and (2) integrate initially con flicting standards, goals, and goal-paths. It is fur ther hypothesized that if what is now known about communication for consensus were taught over a period of time, democratic leaders could be pro duced, perhaps within one semester. The pro posed course in "Communication for Consensus" can be outlined only briefly here.

ORIENTATION: COMMUNICATION FOR DEMOCRATIC ACTION The ultimate source of democratic behavior is the need of interactants to perceive each other as, not necessarily equally capable, but as equally in dependent and equally responsible inviolable per sons not subject to laissez-faire dependence or to autocratic dominance. The desire to learn to com municate for democratic action instead of auto cratic action has been crystallized by recounting the history of democratic participation, by ex plaining the theoretical advantages, by citing the experimental evidence, by emphasizing the pres ent world-wide crisis, and by detailed training in the appropriate format. This orientation affects the majority; what will re-orient diehard laissez faire and autocratic persons remains to be seen. B. FORMAT: GENERAL GROUP PROBLEM SOLVING PROCEDURE A general group problem-solving procedure has been adapted from Dewey's "thought formula," or "pattern of reflective thinking." Students can be trained in each of the seven steps: (1) stat ing the goal, (2) stating obstacles to the goal, (3) stating proposed solutions to the obstacles, (4) stating standards for judging proposed solu tions, (5) stating conflicts between standards and proposed solutions, (6) stating approved solu tions, and (7) measuring the adequacy of the approved solutions to reach the goal. This format should be accompanied by training in the evalua tion of evidence, in inductive and deductive rea soning, and by wide and deep reading in group dynamics and the literature of the problem-area. This format, like golfing, can be learned super ficially in an afternoon; the perfection of it may occupy years. C. SCIENCE: GENERAL SEMANTICS The comparatively new linguistic science of general semantics may be as important to man kind as the formula E - mc2, although it cannot be stated in five symbols. The distinctions between process level and verbal level, the awareness of abstracting, the avoidance of allness, word-magic, elementalism, anthropomorphism, and false di chotomy, the differentiation of word and referent, intensional and extensional meaning, and report, inference, and judgment can be learned, at the verbal level, in a few days; but probably no one would claim that such complete re-orientation at the action level could occur except by years of conscious effort. Nevertheless, students are able within a few days to make appreciable progress in acquiring this science of consensus. D. CONSCIENCE: GENERAL ETHICS Every communication is meant to create in the respondent a cognitive structure, a motivational structure, and an action structure,10 although the three parts of the communication may be un equally emphasized, even telescoped into one word, as "Halt!" Each of the three parts of a communication is freighted with ethical problems if the persons who will be equally affected by a decision exercise equal responsibility in making the decision. Realizing this ideal of democracy requires responsible cognition (evidence and rea soning), responsible motivation, and a responsible action structure. To illustrate the problems-but not to solve them!-consider an all-too-popular communication: "The Russians have the atomic bomb (evidence?); they hate America (evi dence?); therefore (reasoning?), they will bomb American cities first, without warning (reason ing of "they will bomb?" reasoning of "they will bomb America?" reasoning of "they will bomb American cities?" reasoning of "they will bomb American cities first?" reasoning of "without warning?"); so (reasoning?), drink up, boys, and be merry (action structure?), for (reasoning?) tomorrow you may die" (motivation structure?). The ethical problems of, What do we per ceive? (cognition), What difference does it make to us? (motivation), and, What shall we do about it? (action) are more easily stated than solved. The democratic intent and training in the evalua tion of evidence and of reasoning (inductive and deductive), in the general problem-solving pro cedure, in interaction analysis ("group dynam ics"), and in general semantics, all help, but more is needed. A psychiatrist has provided what he considers "an absolute, general answer appli cable everywhere and at any time: . . . the three fundamental subjective principles of primary mo rality: It is bad (i.e., it arouses guilt) to injure or threaten a good object; it is good to love, repair and defend a good object; it is also good to hate, (Continued on page 336) MAY, 1953 10 The writer is indebted to Dorwin Cartwright, "Some Prin ciples of Mass Persuasion," Human Relations, II (1949), for the terminology of this implicit definition of persuasion, but not for the predication.</page><page sequence="5">ARE WE TWIGGING DEMOCRATS? (Concluded from page 310) attack, or destroy a bad object, that is, any thing or person that threatens to destroy a good one." These may be termed negative, positive, and ag gressive morality, respectively." Apparently, the one remaining stumbling block to the twigging of democrats is the inability of participants to agree on what are the "good ob jects" that would be affected by the proposed ac tion structure. Whenever group members can reach consensus on "good objects," they should be able, guided by the conscience, or "seeing to gether," of general ethics through the science of general semantics and the format of general group problem-solving procedures, to reach their objective: communication for democratic action. Are democrats "good objects" in a democrati cally oriented culture? Shall we, despite the pain on the production line and the strain on the con sumption line, keep on trying to learn how to twig them until the earth is forested with stalwart trees able to withstand the blows of hammers, the slashes of sickles, and the blasts of whatever force the anti-democrats anywhere choose to hurl at us. 11 Roger E.
