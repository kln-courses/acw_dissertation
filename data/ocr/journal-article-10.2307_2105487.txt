<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Problem of God in Philosophy of Religion. HENRY DuMERY. Trans. by Charles Courtney. Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, 1964. Pp. xi, 135. Henry Dum6ry's book is defective on two counts. On the one hand, it lends itself to obscurantism in religion because it departs from the plane of pure phenomenological descriptions and uses inferential thinking and dialectics, rather than accuracy of description, to validate religious expe- rience. Perhaps this is a way of saying that the validity of religious affir- mations cannot be accounted for by pure descriptions alone. If we had the allotted space in this review to deal with this important problem of validation in phenomenology, it would be worthwhile to elaborate on it. On the other hand, the efficacy of primary thinking, as over against critical reflection, has not been demonstrated by Dumery's work. What it does demonstrate, however, is that primary thinking, with its ready access to the immediate given in experience, is the servant of any master who chooses its service in some willful pursuit. In this review we wish to concentrate on this point. Even after numerous investigations in the field of phenomenology of religion there is still some doubt whether this approach can avoid being a weapon of apologetics if the investigator is both a phenomenologist and a religionist. Henry Dum6ry's work is a case in point because it contributes to the problem of anti-intellectualism in religion. He begins his investigation with a sharp line of demarcation between primary thinking and secondary reflection which, in the field of religion, turns into the distinction between living spirituality and critical reflection. But what is concrete existence, lived experience, and concrete theism in the context of primary thinking? From our point of view, it is a rubber stamp for the identification of Dumery's definition of existence and experience with concrete existence and experience per se. Critical reflection can merely "state" what spontaneous religious thinking affirms because it has to limit itself to recovering the affirmations of lived spirituality. It thus functions in the capacity of a theology by preparing the subject self for the mood of receptivity in which the notion of the Absolute will prove its existence. It should be noted, however, that lived spirituality is already a con-</page><page sequence="2">138 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH struck of the highest order when it dictates to the intellect how it should procede with the investigation of the religious phenomena. Spontaneous thinking is thus much closer to faith, which is a "separate order" and a "sui generis venture," than it is to the critical intellect and, consequently, is more open than the latter for apologetic uses. It is on the side of the concrete self and its beliefs, over against knowledge and criticism, and convinces the self of the "manner in which spontaneous thought leads to God." But what is this something in the spontaneity of thought which leads directly to the eternal's spontaneity, as pure unity? It is the affir- mation of pure spirit which primary thinking affinns, without having recourse to its own logical standards, but only to the norms of lived spirituality. Dumery's fourth reduction, which posits God as a transcate- gorial unity above all order, is such a construct that rests on the "religious initiative." The human spirit, in acts of self-transcendence, tends toward the eternal. Spontaneous thinking accepts this position dutifully because its task is merely to state what religion believes. In this context the fourth reduction is not an impossibility. But this is phenomenology with mystic overtones. This remarkable ascent is achieved without the counsel of dialogue between man and God. In his attempts to avoid anthropomorphism, Dumery views the nature of dialogue in a disparaging way, as merely "a mode of representation, relative to certain planes of consciousness and not of vital necessity to the religious consciousness (p. 129). He advocates a sure return to the eternal, without the counsel of dialogue. The same lack of dialogue which is characteristic of the God/man relationship is also lacking between religion and philosophy. There it is not needed either, since the spirit will direct reason in the atmospheric current of spontaneity, where man's spontaneity touches the hem of God's spon- taneity. "There is God, affirmed by spontaneous consciousness (in its religious elan) and, by way of this affirmation, criticized by the philoso- pher... it is reflective appreciation of a spiritual act that is performed on the plane of effective engagement" (pp. 12-13).
