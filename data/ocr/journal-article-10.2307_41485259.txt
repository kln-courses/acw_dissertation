Methods Linked census-cancer records (1981 -2004) were used to determine incidence rates of endometrial cancer by ethnicity. Health survey data (2006-2007) were used to determine risk factor prevalence by ethnicity. Relative risks for the association between diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity and endometrial cancer were sourced from pub- lished studies. Population attributable risk (PAR) methods, with Monte Carlo simulation, were used to estimate the PAR% by ethnicity and applied to 2001-2004 cancer rates. Results Pacific women had 2.61 (95 % confidence inter- val 2.22-3.05) times the endometrial cancer rate of Euro- pean/Other women pooled over time, and the most rapidly increasing rates over time with the rate ratio increasing from 1.96 (1.14-3.37) in 1981/1986 to 3.78 (3.03-4.71) in 2001/2004 (p for trend = 0.14).

Applying these PAR% to 2001-2004 endometrial cancer rates, the rate ratio com- paring Pacific to European/Other endometrial cancer reduced from 3.8 for total cancer (attributable plus non- attributable) to 2.3 for non-attributable cancer, and the rate difference reduced by 79 % from 51 to 11 per 100,000. Conclusions Pacific women have high endometrial can- cer rates in New Zealand. Some, but not all, of the ethnic inequalities were explained by measured differences in obesity/overweight, DM, and physical inactivity. Keywords Endometrial cancer • Diabetes • Obesity • Physical activity • Pacific Introduction Endometrial cancer is the fifth most common cancer among New Zealand women [1]. Endometrial cancer is generally more common in developed nations with 20-fold variations between these and developing nations [2] and a clear pre- dominance among white women [3-5]. However, in the late 1980s, international comparisons of age-standardized inci- dence rates of endometrial cancer suggested an increased risk of endometrial cancer among women of Polynesian heritage (largely immigrants to New Zealand since the 1960s) with rates significantly higher than that of NZ Maori (indigenous people of New Zealand, but also migrants from the Pacific c.1000 AD) ánd European/Other women [2]. There are four main ethnic groups in New Zealand; (1) Maori, (2) those of European origin who commenced migration in the mid- 1800s, (3) people from islands in the Pacific region, and (4) a substantial 'Asian' ethnic group, Springer</page><page sequence="2">876 Cancer Causes Control (2012) 23:875-885 mostly from a recent wave of migrants over the last 3 decades. By the 2006 census, the New Zealand population was just over 4 million, with 65 % New Zealand European, 14 % Maori, 7 % Pacific, 9 % Asian, and around 1 1 % identifying with other ethnic groups (predominantly of European heritage). Recent analyses on the New Zealand Cancer Registry data have shown higher rates of endo- metrial cancer among Pacific women than Maori and European women [6]. Other recent work which uses linked New Zealand census-cancer data from 1981 to 2004 (that overcomes numerator-denominator bias from different recording of ethnicity in health (numerator) and census (denominator) data sets [7]) found Pacific rates for endo- metrial cancer to be 2.61 (95 % CI 2.22-3.05) times higher than European/Other rates [8] and highlighted the need for further research on why Pacific rates are much higher. The pattern of this disease among women in New Zea- land is in stark contrast to the rest of the developed world where endometrial cancer is predominantly a disease of white women. In the United States, where endometrial cancer is the most common invasive gynecological malignancy [9-12], non-Hispanic white women have the highest age-adjusted incidence rates of cancer of the uter- ine corpus with rates 20 % higher than those of African American women, 40 % higher than Asian/Pacific women, and 60 % higher than women of Hispanic backgrounds [13]. The reasons for the unusual epidemiology of endome- trial cancer in New Zealand are unclear. Samoans consti- tute the largest group of Pacific people living in New Zealand followed by Cook Islanders and Tongans [14]. It has been difficult to estimate the true incidence rate of common adult cancers in the Pacific Island nations due to the underdevelopment of data management systems as well as hospital facilities for diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Recent efforts at setting up cancer registries within the Pacific have had varying degrees of success [15]. For the period 2000-2005, age-standardized incidence rates (to the WHO world standard) for endometrial cancer in the Cook Islands and Tonga were 47.0/100,000 (95 % CI 45.1-48.9) and 23.9/100,000 (95 % CI 23.3-24.5), respectively [16]. Unfortunately, to date, there is no registry in Samoa. In New Zealand, age-standardized incidence rates (to the WHO world standard) for Pacific women between 2001 and 2004 were 69.7/100,000 (95 % CI 55.1-84.2) [7]. Known risk factors for endometrial cancer include obesity, diabetes, physical inactivity, nulliparity, early menarche, late menopause, and exogenous unopposed estrogen [5, 10, 11, 17, 18]. It has been suggested that hypertension is a risk factor [11, 16], but this may just be a correlate or consequence of obesity and diabetes, all of which are components of the metabolic syndrome. In addition to this, it is now recognized that physical activity Springer is protective with many high-quality studies showing risk reductions of 20 % or more with high levels of physical activity, and dose-dependent relationships [17, 19]. Hy- perinsulinaemia, in the setting of insulin resistance, is associated with cancer risk [20] and in particular endo- metrial cancer [21, 22]. Important hormonal-metabolic alterations pertinent to this syndrome may be stimulatory to the development of endometrial cancer, but more signifi- cantly, seem to primarily affect cancer progression and are associated with more aggressive disease [23, 24]. There is a growing body of evidence lending support to the influence obesity has on cancer risk. A meta-analysis looking at the link between BMI and adult cancers found that each 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI was strongly associated with endometrial cancer with a risk ratio of 1.59 (95 % CI 1.50-1.68) [25]. Pacific people have the highest rates of obesity and diabetes in New Zealand. In the 2006/2007 New Zealand Health Survey, the prevalence of obesity (BMI &gt; 30) among Pacific people was 63.7 % compared with 41.7% for Maori and 24.3 % for European/Other. After adjusting for age, Pacific people in New Zealand were 2.5 times more likely to be obese than anyone else in the total population [26]. In New Zealand, this translates to 48 % of endometrial cancer in Pacific Island females being attribut- able to a BMI &gt; 25, 37 % for Maori females, and 33 % for all women combined [27]. For Pacific Island females, this suggests that if all Pacific women had a BMI of &lt;25, we would reduce the incidence rate of endometrial cancer in this group by 48 % (assuming no confounding by other risk factors that do no change commensurately with BMI). Diabetes is strongly associated with endometrial cancer with a meta-analysis providing a summary RR of 2.47 (95 % CI 1.37-4.45) for diabetics compared with non- diabetics, after controlling for physical activity and BMI [28]. A Swedish cohort study examining the combined association of diabetes, physical activity, and obesity found that the relative risk for obese, diabetic women was 6.39 (95 % CI 3.38-12.06) compared with non-diabetic women with a BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2. The relative risk increased to 9.61(95 % CI 4.66-19.83) if women were also physically inactive [29]. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to describe the incidence rate trends between 1981 and 2004 of endome- trial cancer in Pacific Island (and Maori) women compared with European/Other women in New Zealand, and by age; (2) to analyze whether the disparities between ethnicities can be explained by differences in prevalence of three known major risk factors in these ethnic groups. Regarding the first objective, we have previously reported the endo- metrial cancer rates for 1981-2004 combined [7]; this paper additionally presents trends and age-specific rates. To achieve the second objective, we use population attributable risk (PAR) methodology to determine the</page><page sequence="3">Cancer Causes Control (2012) 23:875-885 877 burden of disease attributable to the joint distribution of obesity, diabetes mellitus, and physical inactivity among women in New Zealand. This study provides the most detailed analysis of Pacific womens' risk of endometrial cancer to date in any country and is the only study to our knowledge to investigate the impact of known risk factors on endometrial cancer risk among this group. Method Incidence rates and trends The data set was created by linking New Zealand Cancer Registry (NZCR) records to the 5-year New Zealand cen- sus of population and dwellings (the census) data and is published in detail elsewhere [7, 30, 31]. Briefly, five closed cohorts were created of the New Zealand usual resident population (all ages) on census night 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001, followed up for incident cancer(s) until the subsequent census or in the case of the 2001 cohort, until 31 December 2004 (the most recent data available at the time of the study's record linkage). The NZCR is a population-based cancer register that collects data on the full population of New Zealand, including all endometrial cancers (ICD code C54). It is not possible to reliably dis- tinguish Type I and Type II endometrial cancers using the NZCR data, therefore all endometrial cancers are analyzed together. Between 73.2 % (1981-1986) and 81.7 % (2001-2004) of eligible endometrial cancers were linked to a census record. This linkage varied by sociodemographics, with 19-33 % of Pacific cancer records unable to be linked (partly due to younger age of Pacific cancer registrants, but also due to a direct 'ethnic effect'). To avoid underesti- mation of rates due to linkage bias, weights were calculated for strata based on age, sex, ethnicity, and small-area deprivation. For example, if 20 out of 30 cancer registra- tions for Pacific females aged 45-64 living in moderately deprived areas were linked, each of the 20 linked records was assigned a weight of 30/20 = 1.5, making the 20 records representative of the 30 eligible records. All anal- yses used these weights. Approval was granted for this project under the Statis- tics New Zealand Data Integration Policy [32], and the Wellington Ethics Committee granted ethics approval for CancerTrends (Ref 04/10/093). A modified total ethnicity approach was used for this work. Total ethnicity places an individual in all ethnic groups that they identify with. If individuals indicated any / all of Maori, Pacific, and/or Asian ethnic affiliation, they were placed in any/all of Total Maori, Total Pacific, Total Asian ethnic groups. The residual people who did not indicate any of the above ethnic affiliations were placed in the non-Mãori/Pacific/ Asian (referred to as European/Other hereafter). Incidence rates and rate ratios (and 95 % confidence intervals) were calculated after direct standardisation of the cohorts to the age structure of the 2001 WHO world standard population. Statistical tests of trend were con- ducted for rates, and of the log transformed rate ratios, by regressing them on calendar year and using the p value for calendar year coefficient. All measures were also calcu- lated for all five cohorts pooled. All these analyses were conducted in SAS v9. Population attributable risk calculations The avoidable burden is the reduction in the future burden of disease if we reduced the exposure to a particular risk factor to a counterfactual level of exposure , and there is either no confounding or confounding variables commen- surately change in the counterfactual with the exposure. A counterfactual distribution is an alternative population distribution of a variable of which 4 types have been described: theoretical minimum risk, plausible minimum risk, feasible minimum risk, and cost-effective minimum risk [33]. For the purposes of this paper, we have used a theoretical minimum risk, which represents the lowest population risk, with this ideal being a physically active, non-diabetic female with a BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2. Physical activity performed in various settings is assigned a meta- bolic equivalent (MET), which is the ratio of work meta- bolic rate to a standard resting metabolic rate of 1.0 [34]. One MET is a resting metabolic rate during quiet sitting. We have defined physical activity as being recreational exercise (including walking for transport) that is per- formed at a moderate to vigorous intensity, i.e., &gt;3 MET. We generated three a priori categories for recreational physical activity: None, &gt;0 to &lt;450 MET min/week and &gt;450 MET min/week. Our highest category of physical activity corresponds to 30 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity (i.e., &gt;3 MET activity) at least 5 days a week (or 150 min/week of walking at a brisk pace). This is the minimum recommended physical activity by the American Heart Association for the reduction of cardio- vascular risk and improved health benefits [35] and is also the New Zealand population recommendation adopted and supported by Sport and Recreation New Zealand [36]. BMI cut-offs are defined according to WHO criteria. A diag- nosis of diabetes mellitus is based on the surveyed indi- vidual confirming that a general practitioner had told them that they have diabetes mellitus. Springer</page><page sequence="4">878 Cancer Causes Control (2012) 23:875-885 Relative risk estimates Relative risk estimates for combinations of these exposure variables were obtained from a search of existing literature, using the following key search terms: endometrial cancer, corpus uteri cancer, diabetes, physical activity, obesity, and BMI. For the purposes of the categorical PAR% calculation method we employ (see below), it was necessary to gen- erate a relative risk for all possible combinations of BMI (&lt;25 kg/m2; 25-30 and &gt;30), diabetes (binary) and phys- ical activity (none; &gt;0 to &lt;450 MET min/week; and &gt;450 MET min/week). That is, relative risk for 17 non- referent strata compared to those with a BMI &lt; 25, high physical activity, and non-diabetic. Table 1 shows the derived RRs. The referenced cells represent the values that were obtained directly from systematic review and meta- analyses which were available or best available evidence. Namely, a systematic review from Renehan et al. [25] found an RR of 1.59 for developing endometrial cancer for a 5-unit increase in BMI from 25 kg/m2. The Million Women cohort study [37] also examined cancer incidence in relation to BMI and reported an RR of 2.73 for women with BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2. A case-control study looking at exercise and risk of endometrial cancer reported a 34 % risk reduction (0.66, 95 % CI 0.50-0.87) for women engaging in more than 450 MET min/week of moderate to vigorous physical activity (adjusted for age and BMI) [38]. This paper best approximates the physical activity data collected in the New Zealand Health Survey. We have used an RR of 2.47 [28] for diabetes and the risk of developing endometrial cancer. Multiplicative methods were then used to fill in the remaining cells. We obtained an RR of 4.01 for non-diabetic, obese women who do not engage in physical activity (i.e., 2.73 x 1.47). In support of this is a case- Table 1 Relative risk estimates for combination of risk factor exposures and association with endometrial cancer MET min/week BMI &lt;25 kg/m2 25-30 kg/m2 &gt;30 kg/m2 No diabetes mellitus &gt;450 1 (referent) 1.6a 2.73b &gt;0-450 1.2 1.92 3.28 None 1.47e 2.35 4.01 Diabetes mellitus &gt;450 2.47d 3.95 7.14 &gt;0-450 2.96 4.74 8.09 None 3.63 5.81 9.91 a Renehan et al.

[28] Ô Springer control study that found an RR of 4.1 (95 % CI 1.5-11.3) for women with a BMI &gt; 28 kg/m2 who are physically inactive compared with active women with a BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2 [39]. Consistently, no statistically significant interactions between BMI and physical activity have been reported in the literature to our knowledge [38-46]. How- ever, studies are inconsistent with some studies showing differential risk by BMI [39, 43, 45, 46] and others reporting stable risk estimates across BMI strata [29, 40, 41, 47, 48]. Our estimate for the highest risk group, i.e., BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2, no physical activity and diabetic, is 9.91 (i.e., 2.73 x 1.47 x 2.47). A Swedish cohort [29] corroborates this estimate with an RR of 9.61(95 % CI 4.66-19.83) for the same group compared with women with BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2, high physical activity and no dia- betes. Only one paper found a statistically significant interaction (on a multiplicative scale) between diabetes mellitus and BMI [49] with most papers reporting non- significant interactions [29, 50-54]. A statistically signifi- cant interaction between diabetes mellitus and physical activity was reported by one paper [29], and only one other paper reported that there was no suggestion of interaction between diabetes and other risk factors that were examined [43]. Terms for interaction between age and physical activity, BMI or diabetes did not reach statistical signifi- cance [41, 53, 54]. Therefore, we assume no interactions between diabetes, physical activity and BMI and that the relative risks presented in Table 1 apply uniformly across age groups, and ethnic groups, in the absence of any published literature to suggest otherwise. Risk factor prevalence estimates Data on the prevalence of major known risk factors were collected by the New Zealand Adult Health Survey (2006/ 2007). This was a household survey of 12,488 people aged 15 years and older, of whom 1,033 were Pacific. It inclu- ded questions on physical activity, diagnosed diabetes, and anthropomorphic measurements allowing calculation of BMI (&lt;1 % missing data for all responses). The response rate for this survey was 67.5 % overall, and 70.2, 67.5, and 67.8 % for Pacific, Maori, and European/Other, respectively. The minimum level of recreational exercise that the NZHS records is that of walking at a brisk pace which is a 3.3 MET activity [34]. It also enquires about more vigor- ous activity performed and total time for each activity over the previous 7-day period. A new variable was generated for physical activity in order to calculate a continuous score for total MET activity. We used 3.3 MET for walking at a brisk pace, 4.0 MET for moderate activity (e.g., carrying light loads, bicycling at a slow pace), and 8.0 MET for vigorous exercise (e.g., heavy lifting, digging, aerobics)</page><page sequence="5">Cancer Causes Control (2012) 23:875-885 879 [55]. We then created the three a priori categories for physical activity. Proportions for each of the 18 strata (BMI X diabetes x level of physical activity) by ethnicity and 10-year age groups (25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74 year, 75+ year) were derived from the NZHS 2006/07 data using STATA (see Appendix in ESM). To model uncertainty around all proportions, a simula- tion based on random sampling of a multinomial distribu- tion was applied to all strata by ethnicity and age group. To avoid preferential zero resampling, a small amount of random noise was added to the zeros to allow for non-zero numbers to be sampled. The noise is from a random uni- form distribution with mean zero and small standard deviation. To make sure the total sum of the counts remained the same before adding the noise, the total added noise was unevenly subtracted from all other non-zero values, while making sure that negative and/or zero counts would not be created. Calculating the PAR% We calculated joint PARs to provide estimates for the combined effect of risk factors, matched to prevalence data on obesity, diabetes mellitus, and physical activity obtained from the 2006/2007 New Zealand Adult Health Survey Data. The population impact fraction (PIF) was calculated using the following equation: JZo RR(U, k)P(x)dx - J"'=Q RRQ'j, k)P' (дрек J™=0RR(i,j,k)P(x)dx where RR (/, j, к) is the relative risk for the exposed; P(x) is the prevalence of the exposure, P'(x) is the alternative distribution, and i, jy к represent each of diabetes, physical inactivity, and obesity, respectively. PARs were calculated for 10-year age groups: 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74 year, and 75+ year, by eth- nicity. A Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation was used to generate 1,000 simulations, drawing from the probability density distributions around the risk factor proportions (multinomial distribution) and relative risks (95 % confi- dence intervals). Each simulation performed a random sampling of relative risk but this was kept constant across all age groups within a single simulation. This was based on our assumption that the relative risk was uniform across age. Sensitivity analyses were conducted in relation to the missing BMI data for each ethnicity with best case (i.e., if all those missing BMI were &lt;25 kg/m2, physically active and non-diabetic) and worst case (i.e., if all those missing BMI were &gt;30 kg/m2, not physically active and diabetic) scenarios applied. This had little effect on resultant PAR%. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted about a moderate interaction (on the multiplicative scale) of BMI with physical activity, but this also had little effect on the resultant PAR% (see Appendix in ESM). Calculating non-attributable endometrial cancer rates Incidence rates from the 2001/2004 cohort were used to calculate non-attributable rates. Age-specific PAR% (cal- culated above) were applied to age-specific rates by eth- nicity, and attributable rates for each stratum were calculated by direct standardisation to the 2001 WHO world standard population. These were then summed to give total attributable and non-attributable endometrial cancer rates by ethnicity, using the following formula: 6 у IR = Y £-AjWj у 1 1 4-¿ 100 1 1 where for the jth age group, incidence rate is A,, PAR% is Xj, and weight is w y. A 95 % uncertainty or simulation interval about these attributable rates was derived from the cumulative rank of all 1,000 simulations. Note that in each simulation, the sampled draws from the probability density distributions about the PAR% and age-specific rates were independent across age. All data analyses were conducted in R 2.13.0 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) [56]. Results Incidence rates and trends over time There were a total of 5,586 registered cases of endometrial cancer for the entire study period. Of these 315 were Pacific (with 879,037 person years of follow-up time), 549 were Maori (with 2,397,008 person years of follow-up time), and 4,722 were European/Other (with 20,982,675 person years of follow-up time). Table 2 shows age-stan- dardized rates (SR) and rate ratios (SRR) for women over the age of 25 years by ethnicity. For all cohort periods, Pacific women had the highest incidence rates of endo- metrial cancer.

By contrast, both rates and relative risks for Maori women were stable or increased only very slightly over the same period (for Maori RR = 1.54 in 1981/1986 to 1.66 in 2001/2004, p for trend = 0.72). When disaggregated by age, essentially the same pattern is seen for all age groups, although the relative risk is much higher in the youngest age group for Pacific women relative to European/Other women (pooled RR = 6.36; 4.39-9.22 for women aged 25-44 years). Table 2 also shows SRs and SRRs for women aged 45-64 years and 65+ years. Numbers were too small in the youngest age group to calculate trends over time by ethnic group. Population attributable risk Table 3 shows calculated PAR% for the joint effects of DM, physical inactivity, and overweight/obesity on endo- metrial cancer for all 10-year age groups by ethnicity. For all age groups, Pacific women had the highest PAR%. All ethnicities demonstrated a rise in PAR% with age and a small decrease in the 75+ year age group. The highest PAR% for Pacific was in the 55-64-year age group (73 %) while European/Other and Maori women peaked in the 65-74-year age group (57 and 69 %, respectively). Ô Springer Rates attributable to the joint effects of the specified risk factors for all ages combined are calculated by taking the WHO World Standard weighted sum of the product of the PAR% and total endometrial cancer rate across all age groups. In 2001-2004 (the period closest to the health survey data used to calculate age-specific PAR%), the age- standardized rates of endometrial cancer attributable to the joint distribution and effects of DM, physical inactivity, and overweight/obesity are 50.5 (95 % simulation interval 38.6-64.3) for Pacific, 18.7 (14.6-23.1) for Maori, and 10.3 (8.7-12.1) for European/Other. Dividing these age-stan- dardized attributable rates back into the total age-stan- dardized rates, one gets estimates of the PAR% across all ages: 72 % for Pacific, 61 % for Maori, and 56 % for European/Other (Table 3). Figure 2 shows the rates by ethnicity for 2001-2004, decomposed into attributable (avoidable) and non-attrib- utable (unavoidable) components. (The non-attributable rate is that which might counterfactually exist if all ethnic groups had a BMI less than 25, no diabetes and were all highly physically active.) Pacific women would experience a decrease from 69.7 per 100,000 to 19.2 per 100,000, a reduction of 50.5 per 100,000. For Maori women, this would decrease the incidence rate from 30.7 per 100,000 to 12.0 per 100,000 (18.7 per 100,000 py reduction) and European/Other from 18.5 per 100,000 to 8.2 per 100,000</page><page sequence="7">Cancer Causes Control (2012) 23:875-885 881 Fig. 1 Age-standardized incidence rates * (with 95 % confidence intervals) for endometrial cancer in all women over the age of 25 years by ethnicity * Incidence rates have been standardized to WHO world standard population (10.3 per 100,000 py reduction) (Table 4). The Pacific SRD decreases from 51.2 to 11.0 per 100,000 - a 79 % reduction in the absolute gap. The Pacific SRRs reduce from 3.78 to 2.34 for total to non-attributable cancer, a 52 % reduction in the relative gap. Discussion This study has two important findings: (1) Pacific women have very high incidence rates of endometrial cancer compared with other New Zealand women; and (2) reducing exposure to three key risk factors: diabetes mellitus, physical inactivity, and overweight/obesity would substantially reduce the burden of endometrial cancer for all women in New Zealand. It is clear that Pacific Island women in New Zealand experience a disproportionate burden of endometrial can- cer. They have had consistently high incidence rates, which have been increasing rapidly over time since 1991 for both the 45-65-year and 65+- year age groups. There is a high prevalence of diabetes and overweight/obesity among Pacific women, and both these risk factors have been becoming more prevalent over the same time period [26]. We have estimated that these two risk factors as measured, in combination with measured physical inactivity, account for over two-thirds of the incidence of endometrial cancer among Pacific women. However, even if all women had optimal levels of these risk factors, our estimates suggest that Pacific women may still have well over double the risk of endometrial cancer compared with European/Other women. Why? There are five main possibilities: First, the adult risk of endometrial cancer is likely to be a function of exposure to these risk factors over a life course. We are limited to measuring them at one point in time. There is some evidence from migrant studies that early life risk is important. For instance, the incidence rate of endometrial cancer in Japanese-American women born in the United States is twice that of Japanese-American women born in Japan [57]. A similar picture is seen among Chinese- American women although the difference between those born in the US and those born in China is not as great. Incidence rates are lowest for women living in their homelands. However, this trend is not consistent, for example, Filipino women who migrate to the United States retain the risk of their homeland even into the second generation. Unfortunately, it is not clear whether age at migration influences this increase in risk, and we do not have sufficient data to investigate this hypothesis among Pacific women in New Zealand. Second, the data we have on current risk factors are imperfect. For example, we only have data on diagnosed diabetes prevalence, true underlying prevalence is likely to be considerably higher and the extent of under-diagnosis may vary by ethnic group. Furthermore, self-reported data Table 3 PAR% for combined effects of DM, physical inactivity, and overweight/obesity on endometrial cancer, calculations for 10-year age groups and age groups combined (with 2.5 and 97.5 % simulation intervals) Ethnicity 25-34 years 35-44 years 45-54 years 55-64 years 65-74 years 75+ years 25+ yearsa European 40 (32-50) 43 (37-51) 47 (40-56) 53 (46-60) 57 (49-66) 56 (45-66) 56 % Pacific 61 (56-67) 62 (56-68) 69 (62-78) 73 (64-83) 72 (63-82) 69 (46-88) 72 % Maori 52 (46-60) 58 (53-64) 61 (53-70) 65 (58-74) 69 (61-79) 64 (51-76) 61 % a Calculated by dividing the age-standardized attributable rate ((WHO World Standard) weighted sum of age-specific attributable rates (PAR% multiplied by age-specific rate)) by the total age-standardized rate.

BMI may have a different impact on different ethnic groups, and higher cut-offs are often used for Pacific people because of their generally higher muscle mass. If we had perfectly measured data on these variables, it is possible that we would be able to explain both more of the incidence and inequalities between ethnic groups (although using higher BMI cut-offs would have had the opposite effect). Third, there may be other risk factors that we have not measured that vary across ethnic groups, for example, age at menarche, menopause, and first pregnancy may all vary across ethnic groups and are associated with risk of endometrial cancer. Fourth, there could theoretically be diagnostic differ- ences between ethnic groups. However, while this may result in earlier age at diagnosis, it is unlikely to lead to differing incidence rates per se. Furthermore, such better and earlier diagnosis would have to differentially favor Pacific women in New Zealand to result in the patterns seen here. Evidence from New Zealand is that, if differ- ences are present, Maori and Pacific people are likely to be under-served in relation to diagnostic and other services relative to the New Zealand European population [58-61]. Fifth, there may be genetic differences between ethnic groups in New Zealand. While this remains a possibility, it is extremely unlikely to be the only factor given patterns seen in migrant studies. However, it is possible that genetic susceptibility may differ between groups to some extent and could interact with some environmental exposure that is changing over time potentially resulting in diverging trends. Summarizing, the PAR% calculations show that a con- siderable proportion of endometrial cancer incidence for each ethnic group is due to a combination of diabetes, overweight or obesity, and physical inactivity. This adds yet more evidence to support population approaches to reducing exposure to these risk factors (and promoting protective factors). Most risk factors for endometrial cancer can be explained by the "unopposed estrogen hypothesis" which proposes that unopposed estrogen exposure results in increased mitotic activity and replication errors in endometrial cells Table 4 Age-standardized rates (total, attributable to DM, physical inactivity, and overweight/obesity and non-attributable), PAR%, SRRs and SRDs of endometrial cancer, for all ages combined applied to 2001/2004 cohort (with 2.5 and 97.5 % quantiles) Variable Total, attributable or non-attributable Ethnicity to joint distribution of DM/PA/BMI - European Pacific Maori Rates Total (95% CI) 18.5 (17.1-19.8) 69.7 (55.1-84.2) 30.7 (24.6-36.8) Attributable (95 % sim int) 10.3 (8.7-12.1) 50.5 (38.6-64.3) 18.7 (14.6-23.1) Non-attributable (95 % sim int) 8.2 19.2 12 SRRs Total 1 3.78 1.66 Non-attributable 1 2.34 1.46 % reduction total to non-attributable SRR - 52 % 30 % SRDs Total 0 51.2 12.2 Non-attributable 0 11.0 3.8 % reduction total to non-attributable SRD - 79 % 69 % &lt;0 Springer</page><page sequence="9">Cancer Causes Control (2012) 23:875-885 883 resulting in malignant change [62]. While hereditary forms account for about 3 % of endometrial cancer cases [63], it has been proposed that these environmental and non-genetic effects are important causal influences in up to 80 % of endometrial cancers [19, 38, 40] suggesting that environ- mental, behavior, and lifestyle modification will reduce the risk of this disease. Strengths and limitations The linkage of cancer registry and census data presents a rare international opportunity to examine ethnic trends in endo- metrial cancer incidence, accounting for systematic differ- ences in the way ethnicity data are collected in cancer incidence and census data sets, but the results are still prone to limitations. First, not all eligible cancer registry records are linked back to a census record. However, we adjust for resultant linkage bias using weights, and we are confident that the residual bias is likely to be minimal - or at least not varying over time. It is likely that the linkage weights applied will, in part, adjust for any differences in risk factor status between the linked and unlinked records because linkage success can be determined by sociodemographics which are also predictive of the risk factors under investigation. Thirdly, registration of cancers on to the New Zealand Cancer Registry became mandatory in 1995, and as a result, there may have been a small artefactual increase in cases around that time. However, it is likely that almost all endo- metrial cancers were registered before then, and it is unlikely that any under-ascertainment would be differential by eth- nicity. Fourth, it was not possible to distinguish between Type I and Type II endometrial cancers. However, 80-90 % of endometrial cancers are Type 1 and estrogen dependent [64] which are related to physical activity, obesity, and diabetes. The remaining 10-20 % constitute Type 2 endo- metrial cancers for which epidemiology and biology is not well characterized but are not thought to operate through the estrogen-dependent pathway. This subtype is more aggres- sive and is responsible for almost 50 % of mortality related to endometrial cancer [64]. Therefore, changing the risk factors - may reduce disparities in incidence, but have less impact on mortality. Finally, because Pacific women tend to be rela- tively recent migrants, it is possible that some may return to the Islands after completing a Census and are therefore lost to follow-up. If these women subsequently develop endome- trial cancer, we would not identify them as such. We may, therefore, have slightly underestimated the incidence rate for all women, but particularly for Pacific women. If we were able to correct for this, it is likely that the trends identified here would be even stronger. Non-response to the NZHS 2006/2007 questionnaire was 67.5 % overall. It is possible that there were demo- graphic differences between those who responded and those who did not. The data used to generate these esti- mates were weighted for non-response and therefore adjusted as best as possible for this. However, in order to change the results substantially, the remaining 30 % would need to have very different responses to change the dis- tribution of risk factors by demographic group. As described above, we are also limited by both the measurement of physical activity in the NZHS 2006/2007 (i.e., self report) and the relative risk estimates obtained in relation to physical activity and endometrial cancer. We have been able to closely approximate our NZHS physical activity categories to the published papers from which the relative risk estimates were obtained. As we model recre- ational PA only, we do not capture the likely extra pro- tective effects of total PA; it is possible therefore that PA explains more endometrial cancer than modeled in this paper. Similar concerns apply to all three risk factors across the life course, meaning we have probably under- estimated the endometrial cancer rates attributable to these risk factors. Excess zeros in our count data and overdispersion pre- sented another challenge. This was a particular problem for Pacific women because of such small numbers. We have allowed for uncertainty around all proportions by per- forming multiple simulations based on a multinomial dis- tribution. Of the 18 strata, for all ethnicities, the most heavily populated cells were non-diabetics and physical activity &gt;450 MET min/week. It is of note therefore that sizeable PAR%s were driven by the large relative risk estimates for the high-risk groups (diabetic, obese, no physical activity) despite the actual proportions in these strata being quite small. Finally, the relative risks we use in our modeling are sourced from published studies and may be prone to error. For example (non-differential and non-dependent), mea- surement error of risk factors in those studies will mean the relative risks are underestimated, contributing to a likely underestimation in our study of the PAR%. In regard to the association between physical activity and endometrial cancer risk, there is mixed evidence as to whether there is differential risk by BMI. While we assume no statistically significant interaction between BMI and physical activity due to a lack of literature supporting this, statistical tests of interaction are frequently underpowered and the absence of this does not mean the absence of effect modification by BMI. Nevertheless, for a simple sensitivity analysis about such a possible interaction (see Appendix in ESM), we found that it did not substantively alter our results.

There is a growing body of knowledge supporting strong causal associations between diabetes, obesity, and malignancy. With increasing ethnic disparities for various cancers in New Zealand and internationally, in combination with differential rates of these predisposing risk factors, there needs to be a drive to create and promote healthier com- munities (i.e., reduce obesogenic environments) in partic- ular among the most vulnerable.
