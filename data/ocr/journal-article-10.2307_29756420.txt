<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION Hans-Joachim Klimkeit, Anti-religi?se Bewegun? gen im modernen S?dindien - "Eine religions? soziologische Untersuchung zur S?kularisier ungs frage (Untersuchungen zur allgemeinen Reli? gionsgeschichte, Neue Folge, Heft 7). (Bonn, Ludwig R?hrscheid Verlag, 1971, 156 pp.). As everyone is aware, the philosophical con? cept in Indian thought is a highly complex one, or rather ? to use a term now fashionable ? very "pluralistic". For it embodies in nuce prac? tically all the western metaphysical systems, albeit reduced to essentials, to the constituent elements of thought. Subjecting separate thought struc? tures called "systems5 to the tyranny of "isms5 is a more difficult and risky operation in Indian than in western philosophy, since Indian "systems' elude this tyranny more easily. One of these "isms5 that can be applied to Indian thought only cum grano salts is "materialism5, or something analogous to the Weltanschauung as we use the word. It is an attitude and way of thinking upheld in India by the N?stikas ? those denying the existence of God, the gods, the soul (and hence the immortality of the latter since it is looked upon as non-existent), of moral values and norms, etc. Regarding this Indian "materialism5 as a philosophical attitude and "system5, the reader is referred to the lucid explanations of G. Tucci (in: Memorie della R. Accad. Naz. dei Lincei, V, 1923, and VI, 1929), and also to Die Philo? sophie der Inder (2nd ed., 1958) by H. v. Gla senapp, especially to the short passages devoted to the "materialism5 of the C?rv?kas and of the Lokdyata-system. Several other authorities and works referring to this (little known) Indian materialism both ancient and modern are cited by Klimkeit in his informative Literaturverzeichnis, a valuable com? ponent of his book since it lists a large number of works in the local languages of the subconti? nent, Tamil in particular ? a very interesting Dravidian language and literature but, alas, little known in the West. Klimkeit, who at present holds the Chair of the history of religions at Bonn University, mastered this tongue during a prolon? ged stay in southern India. But the main scope of his work does not come within either a histo rico-literary or historico-philosophical context. He defines the aim he has set himself as follows: "... to make clear an evolution that has remained relatively unnoticed in the West, the birth, that is, of autonomous and hence anti-religious move? ments in India, in this classic land of religions. As well as clarifying the phenomena as such, we try to discover their roots in this autochthonous area. Thereby, we not only seek to clarify the historical backgrounds, but to make a contribution also to elucidating the complex and stratified problem of secularization in general: a problem that in many cases today is viewed solely from a western standpoint and against the background of the history of the western spirit". We know that the problem of the seculariza? tion of the traditional world, its ideas and insti? tutions under way in western and westernizing societies has, since the time of Max Weber, been one of those most discussed in the history and sociology of religions. The most institutionalized among the latter are mainly affected, but the process sometimes extends to the whole apparatus religi?s us which is thus in time "dismantled5 and dissolved, as it were, in the mare magnum of 426</page><page sequence="2">utilitarian and social functions. This "sociologism" is one of the dangers of Religionssoziologie. Ano? ther consists in looking at religion and religions from a one-sided western standpoint, that is, from Christian and Jewish positions on which western civilization is historically founded. Needless to say, a sociology of religion worthy of the name must strenuously avoid being either European- or Christian-centred. What more than the religious -irreligious world of India deserves to be scruti? nized according to criteria that are bound up with neither the geography nor the history of a single ? and perforce partial and one-sided ? possibi? lity of interpretation? The present author, the indirect disciple of Max Weber and the direct disciple of a historian and sociologist of religion of the solid reputation of Gustav Mensching (whose successor he is in the Bonn Chair) has, in the present work, produced a model of the way to approach the spiritual and social reality of India. In the ideological reality of India, the "classic land of religions" as the author defines it, even "irreligion" or rather, "a-religiosity" has been a familiar feature from the earliest times. In the southern, Dravidian part of the subcontinent the twilight of the ancient gods is spreading more perceptibly with more rapid and radical politico social secularization than in the northern, Aryan part. It is a momentous G?tterd?mmerung of great consequence for the future destiny of India and perhaps not of India alone. This process is deeply rooted in the Indian Geistesgeschichte and, quite correctly, Klimkeit does not fail to stress this. He points out that the problem of God, the "theology" of his "life" and "death" is inextricably bound up in the West with the domi? nant form of personalized monotheism institutio? nalized in Judaism and Christianity. In the spi? ritual world of India, on the contrary, we find alongside rationalistic, materialistic and atheistic conceptions of the world even great religions like Buddhism and Jainism professing varieties of ma? terialistic and atomistic theories, etc. As the author emphasizes, Buddhism, Jainism and certain forms of Hinduism are non-theistic religions, nirisvara v?da, "Ways of the non-God': "... of the six ortho? dox and the three heterodox religious systems, only the Ved?nta, in certain of its formulations, is monotheistic!" In such a context, where it is a question of dharma and not of religio, the concept of secularization, the author goes on, must evidently take on a quite different meaning from that current in the West. And, we could add, the whole problem of atheism radically changes in appearance when nothing more than a variant of religion and religiosity (contingent and not a priori in nature) faces its death struggle. The variant we mean is the one that is dominated by personalism, and anthropomorphic, anthropo centric, monotheistic notions, etc. These are cha? racteristic features of the primitive phase of reli? gious thought (and Erlebnis), a phase already su? perseded by some of the great Pre-Socratics, yet still fossilized in the great institutional religions that still (quousque tandem?) predominate in the world. One could, moreover, take a further tentative step in the same direction: not even scientific materialism is necessarily bound to end in anti religious "secularization5. For there is no lack of those who, observing the course of post-Einstei nian and post-Planckian science, speak of a grow? ing dematerialization du materialisme (G. Bache? lard). On the other hand, the danger certainly remains that the new "pantheism5 that has broadly succeeded the old worn-out materialism will im? perceptibly turn into a h?flicher Atheismus (Scho? penhauer). In relation to the immense amount of inter? national literature devoted to the "death of God", or at least posing the question "whether God has a future" (K. Bliss), Klimkeit's study opens up prospects that the philosophy of religions cannot ignore with impunity. India, Dravidian India in particular, can well add valuable ferment to this debate. It is a factor that present-day "Indology5 has so far tended to neglect, being inclined from the start to paint a rather one-sided picture of the "Indian spirit5 representing it as wholly per? meated by sacral awareness, mysticism and tran? scendentalism. The impressive mass of data pa? tiently collected by the author shows us the other face of India ? an India that is agnostic, a-reli gious if not irreligious, anti-Brahmanist, rationalist, anti-traditionalist, etc. Only if we bear in mind both these Indias can we hope to have a glimpse of the true face of Mother India, a matrix of the most disparate ways of reacting, emotionally and intellectually, to the world of the Realit?tsgege? benheit (N. Hartmann). In part, irreligious and anti-religious move? ments and attitudes in India are influenced by analogous ideologies that, since the second half of last century, have emerged in the international and especially Anglo-Saxon cultural world. But in part they have an autochthonous Indian origin, and it is this sector that is clearly the most inte? resting and significant from the point of view of cultural anthropology. Among foreign anti-reli? gious influences, the author analyzes those exerted by the western movement of Free Thinkers whose ideas have spread surprisingly in India as is evi? denced by the biographies of many front-rank Indian personalities such as the young Gandhi 427</page><page sequence="3">(who abandoned the "Sahara of atheism'' only at the end of his stay in London), Nehru and others. Klimkeit furnishes a detailed contribution to un? derstanding the spiritual development of these personages, basing himself on the most reliable sources. Equally well-documented is his account of the Radical Humanist movement which during and after the second world war was fairly wi? despread among intellectuals influenced by western culture in the towns of northern India. The leading figure in this movement is Manabendra Nath Roy (Narendra Nath Bhattacharyya) who hails from Bengal: his philosophical and political theories are expounded by Klimkeit with a wealth of details little known in the West. M. N. Roy's starting point was Marxism, but later he turned against the dialectics and sociological determinism of Marx, accentuating the role of the individual in society. Nevertheless, he remained inspired by the humanism and socialist goal of Marx and Engels, as well as by Hobbes, Hegel and the 18th century rationalists. Roy conceives of his "radical humanism" as a philosophy of liberty ba? sed on the insights of modern natural science. Religion sins against the presuppositions of huma? nism insofar as it derives human and ethical values from supernatural beings. On the whole, the anti-religious rationalism of Roy is that of the age of the European Englightenment with the addition of Feuerbach, etc. Despite these western influences, the movement initiated by M. N. Roy strives to find its own models also in Indian autochthonous tradition: namely, in the Bengal reform movement founded by R?m Mohan Roy (to which even Rabindranath Tagore had adhered). Indian Radical Humanism, however, is to be dif? ferentiated from this movement through its radical criticism of religious tradition and its anti-religious position on principle, whereas R?m Mohan Roy merely aspired after reform and renewal of Hindu faith and society. M. N. Roy's movement advo? cates a far more radical standpoint, for it calls for the total abolition of religion and the entire Hindu past, of every mystical-religious transcen? dentalism, etc. "The battle ahead is between atheistic rationalism and religious reaction" ? such is the declaration of war of one of the spokesmen of this movement whom Klimkeit quotes. Like the movement of the Radical Humanists, Indian communism and socialism, too, while not denying their debt to Marx, Engels, Lenin, etc. boast of ancient indigenous roots which are autochthonously Indian. It is significant that the Communist and Socialist Parties in India just like those in other parts of the world are most careful not to attack or discredit the traditional religions of India, or insert anti-religious paragraphs in their political programmes. Klimkeit cites the following statement from an official communica? tion of the Indian Socialist Party: "Socialism is a rationalistic conception of life, but it does not interfere in religious matters. In a socialist India religion would be completely free". Obviously, this does not prevent these parties from taking up positions opposed to the caste system and other social institutions conditioned by traditional religion. More far-reaching in scope is the effort by the Indian Communist Party to interpret the whole social and religious history of India in the light of an ideology that is no longer religious but communist. An Indian author (S. A. Dange), whom Klimkeit quotes, invokes the myth of an ancient-Indian primordial communism that is said to have been subsequently suffocated (but not for ever) by the semi-magical caste system and the development of a plethora of religious systems. It is the semi-religious myth of the aetas aurea that reappears in pseudo-historical constructions of this sort that are, indeed, supposedly anti-reli . gious, though they take on a millenarian and eschatological hue in their projection towards a vague future. In the brief bibliographical survey undertaken by Klimkeit mention is not omitted of those singular Indian tendencies postulating a synthesis between modern socialism, western in origin, and ancient Indian religious tradition. In? dian communism/socialism, the author concludes, is not merely religionskritisch in character, but is also capable of revealing nuances that are positi? vely religious; hence, in such syntheses one might discern the legitimate continuation of the religious heritage of India. Les extremes se touchent: it is really obvious to fall back on this trite proverb. After expounding critico-religious ideologies of foreign (western) origin, the author, in a chap? ter demanding the attention of anyone interested in contemporary India, turns to those anti-reli? gious movements that are to be looked upon as eigenst?ndig (autochthonous) in the subcontinent ? in the India of the north, and even more in the India of the Dravidian south. It is a chapter that could be warmly commended, as a powerful antidoton, to anyone who may still be influenced by the cliche of a "mysterious", "secret" and "sacred" India populated by Brahmans, Yogis, Fa? kirs, etc. It is a form of mythologization (and not seldom mystification) that will never adequa? tely account for the complexity of Indian cultural phenomenology, past and present. Klimkeit mar? shals the evidence: there is a long tradition of anti-Brahmanic resentment in some parts of nor? thern India, as in the Maharashtra area (one of the richest in literature) and in Bengal (where a long-standing literature is likewise to be found). 428</page><page sequence="4">Suffice it to recall the great name of the Mar?thi poet Tuk?r?m, a devotee of the god Vithob? at Pandharpur, a famous holy place in the Maha? rashtra area in western India; and the no less famous figures of Caitanya (Chaitanya) and Tulsi d?s, both Brahmans. With these two names we move into the sphere of bhakti mysticism, a po? werful ferment in the radical anti-Brahmanic mo? vement, yet far removed from anti-religious ratio? nalism. However, the latter, as Klimkeit has clearly perceived, is dialectically rooted ? with one of its roots ? in bhakti. Just to prove how far these devotees and poets are from any true rationalism, we have only to recall, for example, that Caitanya dubbed himself a convinced idolater who claimed Vishnu as the one true god reco? gnizing his real presence in a stone simulacrum which he regularly and ardently adored; while Tulsid?s, though certainly a great poet, was eclec? tic not to say muddled in his religious thought, managing to reconcile devotion to R?m both with the (Brahmanic) doctrine of monism and the poly? theistic mythology of Hinduism. Paradoxically, the anti-Brahmanic arguments that were born of a profound and sublime devotion and were the outcome of an equally deep irrationalism, are being taken up by not a few modern rationalist critics: e.g. the anti-Brahmanic movement of Maharashtra and the Bengal rationalists who do not shrink from falling back on ancient bhakti topics to define their secularized positions more clearly. The Maharashtra anti-Brahmanic move? ment, especially, is best described as a social mo? vement rather than one of critico-religious inspi? ration: the ancient social structure of India, foun? ded on the caste of the Brahmans, is the main enemy and target for attack. "If you see a snake and a Brahman, kill the Brahman first" ? that is the old saying widely current in southern India and taken up as a slogan by Dravidian nationalist movements. In describing and analyzing these movements, the author gets to the heart of his exposition that abounds in details largely unknown to the western reader, one reason being that the main sources are com? piled in the Tamil language. Lack of space pre? vents us following our learned author in his laborious work: we have to confine ourselves to listing these anti-religious and rationalist move? ments in Dravidian India today, summarizing their main characteristics. Roughly, they are the follow? ing: 1) The "Dravidian Organization of Culture" (Tir?vitar Cankam; 2) the Justice Party; 3) the "Self-Respect Movement"; 4) the movement for the creation of an atheist Dravidastan; 5) the "Dravidian Movement" (Tir?vita Kalakam); 6) the "Dravidian Progressive Movement" (Tir?vita Mun nerra Kalakam). The Tir?vitar Cankam y also known by its Eng? lish title of "Dravidian Association" was founded in 1910, and aims to create a new self-confidence in the non-Aryans of southern India. It is inspi? red by anti-Brahmanic and anti-Aryan resentment and is based on the ancient south Indian idea of the s am gam a (sangam), a semi-legendary, literary academy and cultural body dating from the Tamil kingdoms (it is thought, however, to have existed for thousands of years and among its members numbered thousands of poets, etc.). The modern revival of fancies of this sort has never achieved political and organizational importance. The Justice Party was founded in 1919, and the main task it set itself was to campaign for social rights and adequate political respresentation of non-Brahmans, combating the disproportionate weight of the latter in the economic, administra? tive and social life of Dravidian India. The mo? vement's bias is largely social, secular and pro? fessional, and it is becoming increasing separatist in tendency as regards "Aryan" India. The Self-Respect Movement aims at reform and displays social and ideological tendencies as well as political bias without, however, being a political party. Its leader is E. V. Ramaswami Naicker who is an interesting figure in Dravidian cultural life and whose programme is rigorously anti-Brahmanic: his movement is intent upon "ap? plying an axe to the roots of the abominable religious concepts and the whole unhealthy social fabric based upon them". In addition to the "tyranny of the Brahmans", he is waging a pas? sionate struggle against the whole Hindu religion and its social structure: "Hinduism is not the religion of the Dravidas and Sanskrit is not the language of the Dravidas. The Dravidas possess their own language and own religion". Needless to say the movement rejects the Hindu caste system and all its implications, the exploitation of lower by higher castes, the subordinate role of woman and the thousands of prohibitions and taboos of traditional Indian life: these are all grievances that must be done away together with their cause ? Hindu religion. Perhaps the most startling success achieved by this movement is, according to Klimkeit, the introduction of the so-called Self Respect marriage without religious ceremonies, priests and ancestral rites: it is now recognized by the state government of Madras. Klimkeit judges it "dynamite beneath a foundation of thought habits thousands of years old". The Movement for an atheist Dravidastan (Tir?vita N?tu), a Dravidastan independent and separated from the rest of India; it dominated 429</page><page sequence="5">the thought of many political personalities of Dravidian India in the years before the second world war, parallel with the Moslem movement for the setting up of an Islamic Pakistan. The yearned-for Dravidastan should comprise the ter? ritory of all peoples speaking Tamil, Telugu, Ma layalam and Kanarese as well as smaller language groups in an area stretching from the Vindhya mountains in the north to Cape Comorin in the south and taking in the whole of the Dekkhan plateau. The slogan "Tamilnad for the Tamils" has been broadened to "Dravidastan for the Dra vidas". Klimkeit rightly perceives that one of the sources of this pan-Dravidism is the spread of the results of western Dravidological science: the discovery of a separate and indipendent fa? mily of Dravidian languages (R. Caldwell, K. Graul, G. U. Pope, Gilbert Slater and others). The archaeological discovery (by Sir John Marshall and others) in the Indus valley of a great pre-Aryan culture, which was too hastily identified with ancient Dravidian culture, contributed to the de? velopment ? and excesses ? of this new pan Dravidian "self-confidence". In the Dravidian Movement (Tir?vita Kala kam) the dominant figure was the aforementioned E. V. R. Naicker, the leader of the anti-Hindu movement and a herald of liberation from Aryan social and religious predominance. He went beyond the verbal criticism contained in his count? less writings and leaflets, indulging in demonstra? tions to destroy the images and appurtenances of the Hindu religion and in violent attacks against Brahmans. The second leading figure in this movement, C.N. Annadurai, is likewise the author of numerous writings of the same type in the the Tamil language. The iconoclastic demonstra? tions of Naicker reached their peak upon the 2500th anniversary of the birth of Buddha (1956) when in honour of Buddha thousands of Hindu statues, especially of Ganesa, were destroyed. The Dravidian Progressive Movement [Tir?vita Munerra Kalakam) was founded through the ini? tiative of Annadurai (1949) following a breach between Annadurai and Naicker. In 1967 it was established as a political party and won the elec? tions in the state of Madras. Its ideological prin? ciples are rationalism, secularism and equality. The technique of ideological propaganda is very ad? vanced in this movement and its leaders are true masters of rhetoric. Literary and publicist out? put, too, is organized at grass-roots level and almost exclusively in the Tamil language. The thought of rationalist, agnostic and anti-clerical writers and philosophers in the West is popula? rized by many biographies and anthologies trans? lated into Tamil, the figures represented ranging from Socrates, Jesus of Nazareth, Luther, Giorda? no Bruno, Michael Servet, Bernard Shaw, Bertrand Russell, etc. Modern means of communication, too, films and TV particularly, are exerting an ever-growing "secularizing" influence on the mas? ses. By following the broad lines of this German scholar's exposition, we have sought to illustrate a little known sector of Indian cultural life: one that may, perhaps, have some political and spi? ritual surprises in store for us in the future of the subcontinent, especially its southern half. This forecast is confirmed by what the author has to say in his final chapter significantly entitled "au? tochthonous points of reference for the anti-reli? gious movements of southern India". Here Klim? keit looks for the roots of these modern move? ments in the literary evidence of Tamil classic works dating back more than a thousand years. It is a chapter that should not be overlooked by anyone interested in ancient and fascinating Ta? mil literature, but having used up the space allot? ted to us we cannot broach this subject. We will merely say that the classic work of the Ta? mils, the Kurd, postulates an ethos that is im? manent, innerweltlich (to use Max Weber's term) and not transcendent; an ethos based on the trivarga: dharma, artha and k?ma. References to "God", "Redemption" and "The Beyond" are not wholly lacking; but the quintessence of Tamil "wisdom" is immanence in this phenomenal life. Klimkeit's book is one of the most stimulating to come into our hands of late; it ends with these words which deserve to be pondered: "... al? ready from now on one can say that the autoch? thonous movements outlined here, with their open struggle against all the theocratic-hierarchical fea? tures of the Hindu social structure, embody one of the most complete threats faced by Hinduism in recent times".
