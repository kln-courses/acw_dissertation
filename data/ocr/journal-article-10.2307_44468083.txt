Tarrière PSA/ Renault Laboratory C. Chillon Peugeot S.A. G. Hufschmitt Régie Renault C. Got and A. Patei IRBA-R. Poincaré Hospital ABSTRACT The goal of this paper is to examine the validity of the Crashworthiness Fating Method (part of the New Car Assessment Program - NCAP - created by NHTSA) with reference to real-life accident data. A program was set up to verify the quality of predictive characteristics of vehicle models* real passive safety protection based on 35 mph crash tests against a 0° barrier. The Crashworthiness Fating Method was applied in the French context because seat belt use has been mandatory in France for over 10 years, and we have access to real- life accident files whose size and categories (type of vehicle model, crushed area, obstacle struck, seat occupied, age, and use of seat belt) allowed us to select cases appropriately and thoroughly. Additionally, the vehicle models which are representative of the French vehicle fleet were tested as if they were part of the NCAP. The results of crashworthiness rating tests expressed by criteria obtained on dummies and also by the OPSEM or the GILLIS index, were compared with accident statistics results expressed in the form of the fatality rate and the social cost index. None of the comparisons made (including vehicle model rating) showed any significant convergence between the NCAP-type tests and accident statistics. The discussion of the reasons for these divergences takes into account the conditions themselves of the NCAP test and the interpretations to which it lends itself, as well as the irrationality of the whole procedure of the method, whose very premises disregard the most basic lessons of accidentology • FOLLOWING THE 1972 CONSUMEF INFOFMATION ACT, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has every year (since 1974) carried out high-speed frontal impact vehicle tests within the framework of its New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). The most- recent model cars are crashed a single time against a "0° barrier", which is fixed and rigid, at a minimum speed of 35 mph. This speed is 5 mph greater than that established for many standards? this should not be interpreted as a minor increase. One must keep in mind that this higher speed leads to an increase of over one-third additional energy dissipation for vehicles which already fully comply with established standards. The NCAP' s basic objective was reiterated in October 1982 by HACKNEY AND QUAHLES (1)* of NHTSA. It concerns "the development of a methodology for providing consumers with a measure of the relative safety potential of automobiles". Because the vehicle models tested in the context of the NCAP yielded different tested results, the public proved to be very interested in "The Car Book" (2) of which 2 million copies were published by NHTSA. Additionally, "Consumer Fe ports" magazine publishes its interpretation of the NCAP (3, 4, 5, 6) annually. In view of this relative success with consumers , it appears imperative to stress the fact that the NCAP has no meaning if it cannot accurately and reliably reflect real- life highway accidents. But does the "driver- consumer" who attentively follows NCAP results know that he currently has no guarantee that good correlation exists between published evaluations of the * Numbers in parentheses designate references at end of paper. 1.1005 0096-736X/ 85/ 9301-1005$02 • 50 Copyright 1985 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">1.1006 C. THOMAS, ET AL. experimental rating system and real-life driving conditions (which are all that really concern and interest him)? In other words, no experimental evaluation method is scientific or worth publishing unless it is validated and confirmed by actual driving conditions. Dr • NIRMEL ( 7 ) , who ranked the 7 prerequisite qualities a crashworthiness rating system must have to be worth using, indicated that validation corresponding to an appropriate real-accident sample is a fundamental part of the procedure. It is not easy to contrast NCAP results with U.S. accident statistics for many reasons, including the following one: NCAP tests are performed using restrained dummies. However, only 10% of American automobile drivers or passengers (who are concerned with their own safety) use the seat belts available in every car. This low use rate partially explains why it is so difficult to gather data samples - even in the U.S. - which lend themselves to statistical analysis in the context of the Crashworthiness Rating Method. Since 1980, in a study performed for NHTSA, CARLSON (8) has come to the following preliminary conclusion: data on highway accidents do not by themselves allow for the establishment of a passive safety protection rating system which is useful to consumers. The main reason for this lies in the fact that several years have to pass after a new model is put on the market in order to have available a large enough accident sample showing the vehicle's relative evolution. The same author comes to a second very important conclusion: the differences between overall injury severity levels among models in the same vehicle weight class are very minor. "Most of the injury severity differences between vehicle subgroups were not statistically significant" • This aspect of the problem seemed important enough to the author for him to conclude the following: "This should not be ignored by NHTSA as it proceeds with its overall crashworthiness rating development". Following in the steps of the preceding author, two American teams directly confronted NCAP results on the one hand and accident statistics on the other. CAMPBELL (9) compared the Consumer's Union 5-level rating method (best - worst) based on NCAP testing with serious injury rates obtained from front-seat occupants in certain vehicle model accidents which occurred in North Carolina. For belted occupants, a slight tendency towards higher rates of injury for the cars ranked lowest in NCAP tests cannot be totally disregarded. But it clearly appears that no significant relationship can be established between NCAP test results as interpreted by the Consumer's Union and injury severity rates observed during real-life accidents. GRUSH, MARSH IV and SOUTH (10) compared NCAP results with those obtained from the American "Fatal Accident Reporting System" (FARS) on the one hand and with results from the Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI ) underwriters on the other hand. Comparative results show that there is no significant relationship between predictions issued by the NCAP and fatality rates of belted front- seat occupants in frontal impacts • In summary, it currently appears that on the basis of American data the (slight) differences in performance among models of the same vehicle weight/mass class observed during real-life frontal impacts are not made apparent by the NCAP. According to American experts, it does not look in the short run as if U.S. accident data are adequate to permit more extensive and complete studies on the verification of the Crashworthiness Rating Method's validity. In December of 1980, during the International Automotive Ratings Symposium held at the behest of NHTSA, recommendations were made to confront the Rating Method with accident data from a country possessing a great deal of data on seat belts. France falls in this cateqory because vehicles there have been equipped with seat belts since April 1, 1970 and a mandatory seat belt use law has been in effect since: - July 1, 1973 - outside urban centers - January 1, 1975 - in urban centers at night - October 15, 1979 - everywhere This is why the French automobile industry responded to the invitation and offered its contribution. This paper's objective is to attempt to verify the predictive passive safety evaluations set forth by NCAP-type experimental tests. METHOD On the one hand, a series of vehicles was tested under conditions identical to those of the NCAP. The cars were divided into three categories of vehicle mass. The models studied alone represent half of the French vehicle fleet at the end of 1982. Let us note that we had to exclude recent- model cars, for which accident data would evidently have been insufficient, from the selection. On the other hand, thanks to work done by the French National Police, we have access to a computerized bodily-accident file over a period of 5.5 years from January 1, 1978 until July 31, 1983. The file covers all of France, excluding collisions which occurred in urban centers of over 10,000 inhabitants. For this</page><page sequence="3">CRASHWORTHINESS RATING 1.1007 reason, the file is very representative of serious and fatal accidents since it records 35% of the bodily accidents and 71% of the fatal accidents which occurred in France. To this day, it includes a total of 440,000 bodily-accidents, 50,000 fatalities and 1,200,000 accident involvements • The information contained in the file is very complete since the general circumstances of the accident, its location, every vehicle and every occupant involved, are described by one line of coding 70 characters long. In particular, there are categories providing identification of the vehicle model, vehicle area struck, obstacle struck, seat occupied, use or non-use of seat belts, overall injury severity, and age. Through performing a rigorous selection of real accident data it becomes possible to compare (retrospectively) the degree of injury severity by type of vehicle model, with the results of criteria derived from dummies in experimental 35 mph tests against a 0° barrier. Due to precautions taken in selecting real accident cases and controlling skew non-attributable to the passive safety protection of the vehicle itself, evaluation by means of accident data of the crashworthiness rating system based on the NCAP may be feasible. If comparative evaluations prove to show more convergence than divergence, then the rating system based on the NCAP must be accepted. In the opposite case, it must be definitively rejected, at least in its present form, on the grounds of invalidity. DATA resulting from tests and accident statistics, followed by COMPARATIVE RESULTS and a DISCUSSION are found below. Note that the vehicle models have not been identified because: statistical confidentiality is required by French law, and also, some of the vehicle models used are not of the makes we represent. DATA RESULTING FROM TESTS - These are provided in Appendix A. Fourteen vehicles (4 "light" cars, 6 "medium" cars and 4 "heavy" cars) were tested with dummies against a 0° barrier at a minimum speed of 35 mph, under conditions required by the NCAP. Thirteen of the fourteen cars tested were equipped with 3-point retractable production seat belts, like those with which most of the vehicles in our real-life accident data are equipped.' For a single car (M^), the test was performed with a 3- point static production belt, in compliance with Procedure IP212.02 (leaving some play between the shoulder strap and the dummy 1 s chest) • This conscious choice corresponds to the observation that 70% of restrained occupants in this model vehicle were held by static belts whose use was discontinued between 1976 and 1978 in favor of 3-point retractable belts. The observed HICs range from 634 to 3154 for drivers and from 857 to 4085 for front-right seat passengers. This wide range of values obtained by vehicles of which most were designed over a decade ago is clearly predisposed to facilitate relative rating of the vehicle models. In this test series, the heaviest cars obtained a higher average HIC result than those of the other two weight classes: average HIC obtained driver /passenger vehicles light 1404/1186 medium 1401/1498 heavy 2603/1879 These experimental results tend to indicate that in frontal impacts against a fixed barrier where crush is distributed in the front of the vehicle, the quality of passive safety protection provided (in as much as the the HIC criteria accounts for it) does not systematically increase with greater vehicle mass. The chest (3 ms) is less than 60 g in 4 cases for drivers and in 12 cases for passengers. The best results obtained for passenger dummies are explained by the driver's interaction with the steering assembly. This same tendency is observed in NCAP results. "Femur" stress rarely exceeds the value limit of 2250 lbs (4 cases out of the 64 measurements taken). The measured criteria (HIC, chest , and "femur" stress) can be combined (usually by overvaluing HIC influence in relation to the 2 other criteria) so as to summarize the series of measurements taken on the dummies, either for an occupant or for the whole vehicle tested. BACKAITIS (11) has developed a criterion called the Occupant Protection System Evaluation Measure (OPSEM) • Note that even though the basic principle of this type of method interests us, our use of the OPSEM should not be looked upon as an endorsement of the values used to derive it. The use of value limits (HIC = 1500, chest Y = 80g, and pelvis/lower limb stress = 2800 lbs per limb) for 50% of fatal risks does not comply with results of recent studies performed on head tolerance (12). Besides, the claim that 2800 lbs of stress on a lower limb is fatal, is hardly a believable one. GILLIS (13) also proposed a coefficient calculated on the basis of values obtained from dummies. Besides a global coefficient for each occupant, the</page><page sequence="4">1.1008 C. THOMAS, ET AL. method yields one number which sums up all of the "dummy" criteria measured on a tested vehicle. The values of these two coefficients are given in Appendix B. Accident Data - This is provided by the French National Police file whose main characteristics have already been described previously. Let us recall, however, that the file covers a period of 5.5 years and that it contains accidents of considerable severity since collisions occurring in large urban centers are not included. The selection of an appropriate bodily- accident sample involving vehicle models tested with the Crashworthiness Rating Method (CRM) is an essential part of the method. This selection aims to: - Retain only those accident configurations which the CRM test is "supposed" to take into account. - Eliminate as much as possible all skew capable of falsifying the evaluation of the models* own intrinsic values regarding passive safety protection by itself. Below, selection criteria for the accident samples comprising at least one of the 14 models tested with the CRM is described in very general terms: Selection of front impacts with vehicle crush in the front center, front left, or front right. (This definition takes into account vehicles exhibiting asymmetrical crush in front.) Selection of front-seat restrained occupants (75% of front seat occupants are restrained) • Exclusion of collisions involving a pedestrian, a "two-wheeler" or a truck/bus . The frontal impact of a car - any car - against a truck/bus is a problem that, due to the differences in construction mass and stiffness, cannot currently be taken into account when evaluating the passive safety of cars themselves (construction, standards, or crashworthiness rating). (One must, however, remember that in frontal impacts for front-seat restrained occupants, the truck/bus obstacle represents 15% of accident involvements but, above all, 37% of fatalities). Exclusion of cases with a rear passenger more than 10 years old. (The exclusion of front-seat restrained occupant overloading cases complies with the CRM test conditions) • - Selection of front-seat occupants between 20 and 50 years old, inclusive. (The age distributions of the drivers in particular are not consistent, expecially in the "light" and "medium" vehicle classes. Depending on the model, the percentage of drivers varies between 2% and 9% for the under-20 year-olds, whereas it varies between 12% and 28% for the over-50 year- olds) • Additionally, the fatality rate for drivers by age category for all of the 14 vehicle models is the following: average &lt;20 years 20-50 years &gt;50 years fatality ^ „ rate 3,0 ^ 2,4 3,8 „ Two reasons justify excluding those samples of occupants either under 20 or over 50 years old: Even if human impact tolerance is overall relatively consistent until the ages of 45-50, it declines after that. The 50% greater fatality rate for over-50 year-olds as compared to the 20-50 age group is proof. - Drivers under 20 years of age have the highest rate of presumed responsibility (78%), whereas it is only 54% (on the average) in the 20-50 age group. This higher risk factor corresponds to a greater number of high-speed impacts, in particular against fixed objects. This explains why despite their good impact tolerance their fatality rate is 25% greater than the average fatality rate of the 20-50 age group. Finally, of the 179,772 front-seat occupants involved in the 14 vehicle models considered (excluding pedestrian and 2- wheeler collisions) only 43,272 were retained - or 24% of the base sample. Despite this rigorous selection, can it be guaranteed that comparisons of vehicle models' passive safety protection will be made with "all other things being equal"? In spite of the sample size, no amount of selection can totally eliminate possible impact violence skewing (which is uncontrollable) among models in the same vehicle group. In fact, speed variation data (Av) among occupants is, of course, not provided by the police. Nevertheless, if the û v were known it would be appropriate to question possible skewing of average deceleration for vehicles having undergone frontal impact. For two restrained occupants involved in a A v of 30 mph, for example, the violence of frontal impact is radically different both for the occupants and for the vehicles depending on whether the crash occurs "head-on" against a wall with average 18 g, or as a quarter- point frontal impact against the rear of another car with average 8 g. The same line of reasoning can be used with many other parameters, such as the direction of impact (11, 12, or 1 o'clock) or the type of front-surface crush. Finally, the integration into the case selection process of pertinent new parameters such as those mentioned above, as well as the use of sophisticated</page><page sequence="5">CRASHHORTHIN ESS RATING 1.1009 statistical techniques/ should in the middle term increase the assurance of passive safety performance comparisons among vehicle models in real-life accidents - but will never, of course/ attain perfection. In the present case, the selections made, weight classes used, sizes of sample studied/ greater proportion of "car -to -car" impacts, and control over certain indicators (relative proportion of impacts against fixed obstacles, for example) largely guard against the risk of significant skewing between vehicle models. It remains that the method must be believable. Actually, what value would we accord to conclusions based on even carefully-selected accidents, but which represent no more than a minute fraction of all collisions? Severity is indicated by two measures for every vehicle model: the fatality rate the social cost index Persons in the sample are considered seriously injured if they have been hospitalized for at least 6 days. This very liberal definition of serious injury includes certain victims suffering AIS 2 (14) degree injury severity. Since the use of a severity rate (fatally and seriously injured persons involved) which combines victims of simple bone fractures with fatal ones is inappropriate, a social cost index (SCI) has been devised. Because the social cost of fatalities is very close to that of all serious injuries taken together (15), the social cost index takes into account equally the significance of fatalities with that of serious injuries. Knowing that in the sample 13 serious injuries per death are observed, the social cost index is subsequently obtained from the following ratio : Nļ fatalities x 13 + ^ serious injuries/total persons involved Compared to the fatality rate, the social cost index differs by equally taking into account the significance of severely- injured persons. Data derived from accident statistics are provided in Appendix C. Confidence intervals at the threshold of 95% on fatality rates of drivers and front passengers were calculated, and are given in Appendix D. The confidence interval limits are especially far apart for passengers and vehicle models having little strength/power. The social cost index (due to the numbers involved) would provide for much more restrained confidence limits, but the use of statistical tests (given the index's method of construction) is not applicable. Within each vehicle weight class, checks for skewing do not show any significant differences among models regarding: - the proportion of collisions against fixed obstacles (20%) as compared to car-to- car collisions (80%). the proportion of front-seat passengers (20%) as compared to drivers (80%) for front occupants. - the proportion of drivers alone (65%) as compared to drivers accompanied by a front-seat passenger. Additionally, we confirmed that overall : - the severity level declines noticeably with increases in vehicle mass. the distribution per 100 fatalities per type of obstacle (fixed obstacle or car) varies, depending on the weight class, as is shown in the following table: Obstacles Fixed Cars "light" cars 49% 51% "medium" cars 56% 44% "heavy" cars 62% 39% The total number of comparisons between 2 models within the 3 vehicle weight classes comes to 27, distributed as follows: "light" cars : C ^=6 2 "medium" cars : C =15 6 2 "heavy" cars : C 4=6 In order to spotlight possible differences in passive safety among the vehicle models., the "x-squared" test is used for these 27 possible comparisons between driver, front-seat passenger and total front- occupant fatality rates. The vehicle models showing significant differences between fatality rates are set forth in detail in Appendix E. We limit ourselves here to giving the number of insignificant differences observed, on the one hand at .05, and on the other hand at .10 (threshold evidently favorable to differences between models, but at the cost of a greater risk of error): Front Front Drivers Passengers Occupants x2 .05 27/27 27/27 23/27 (100%) (100%) (85%) X2 .10 22/27 24/27 20/27 (81%) (89%) (74%)</page><page sequence="6">1.1010 C. THOMAS, ET AL. A first conclusion must be drawn before even proceeding to compare crashworthiness rating tests with the corresponding accident statistics. It is important to keep in mind that the significant differences between models in the same vehicle weight class are very minor (20% maximum of comparisons). Actually, we are only reiterating a conclusion previously drawn in this field by other researchers such as CARLSON (8) and CAMPBELL (9). Additionally, at this stage, it makes sense to question the interest of a program which tries - at great cost - to make differences (which do not really exist) apppear between vehicles of albeit different origins, but whose design and construction correspond at any given time to a series of very similar economic and regulatory constraints • The comparative results between crashworthiness rating tests and accident statistics are examined in the following order : 1 ) HIC and fatality rates 2) Crashworthiness rating performance and evolution of the fatality rate 3) OPSEM and social cost index (SCI) 4) "Driver/passenger" comparisons on the basis of crashworthiness rating tests ( GILLIS index) and accident statistics (SCI) 5) Classification by vehicle model ranking in the crashworthiness test (HIC and GILLIS index) and in accident statistics (fatality rate and social cost index). Due to the recent and justified abandoning of the "pass/fail" evaluation system , we will not consider it here. Let us point out, however, that Appendices A and E show proof that the "pass/fail" system is invalidated to a great extent by accident statistics. 1. HIC/ FATALIT Y RATE COMPARISONS Head injury is usually presented as the primary cause of death for vehicle occupants. Additionally, the HIC is a determinant criterion in evaluations made on the basis of crashworthiness rating tests. It would therefore make sense for HIC and fatality rates to be well-correlated. Figures 1 and 2 give fatality rates as a function of HIC for drivers and front-seat passengers, respectively. In the graph referring to drivers of medium-weight /mas s vehicles, M^ has the worst HIC (2152) even though it has the lowest fatality rate (1.15). Two other comments must be made regarding the driver of M . 6 LIGHT CARS MEDIUM CARS HEAVY CARS fatality rate fatality rate fatality rate HIC Ao HIC A 3 HIC i 3 T° ¿ i T 4000- _^4 4000- 4000- 3000- / f/-2- 3000- "J 3000-:~^-'.

On the basis of his HIC of 1280, would undeniably have been judged superior to M^. This, however, is not the case since the significantly different fatality rates (with 95% certainty) attest to the superiority of M^_ (1.15) over (1.86). - and have similar fatality rates, whereas the HiC of (634) is close to 3.5 times less than that of M^. Another example was taken from "heavy" car passengers: showed a fatality rate hardly less than that of H„ (1.40 against 1.51, respectively) but while the HIC of H2 was 1647, that of H3 was 4085! To finish this comparison, we can see that none of the 6 comparative "HIC/fatality rate" graphs were free from obvious aberrations (which when they exist suffice to invalidate the projected method of classification) • 2. CRASHWORTHINESS RATING PROTECTION AND COMPARATIVE EVOLUTION OF THE FATALITY RATE A three-level scale ( "good - middle - bad") was established based on criteria obtained from dummies during crashworthiness rating tests: HIC Chest Femur Stress , . , . good ^ &lt;1000 and &lt;60 g and &lt;2250 lbs crashworthiness , . , . ^ rating middle 1000-1500 and ^70 g and/or 1 femur&gt;2250 lbs performance ^a(j &gt;1500 no condition no condition</page><page sequence="8">1. 1012 C. THOMAS, ET AL. Within each vehicle weight/mass class and seat occupied, each vehicle model is ranked according to crashworthiness rating performance obtained. Figures 3, 4, and 5 show the evolution of the fatality rate as a function of the decrease in rating performance results. No substantial increase in the fatality rate is observed as crashworthiness protection decreases for either drivers or passengers. Two reservations exist, however : a. For "heavy" vehicles, the crashworthiness rating results obtained leave one of the three levels of the scale uninformed about drivers as well as about passengers. b. The scarcity of figures concerning vehicle model passengers is evident. This remark does not change the interpretation given above, because the "good" and "middle" vehicle models finally both have an identical fatality rate. 3. " OPSEM/ SOC I AL COST INDEX" COMPARISON Both BACKAITIS 1 "OPSEM" integration criteria measured on dummies used in the CRM and the social cost index derived from accident statistics have already been presented. Figures 6 and 7 show comparisons in graph form. OPSEM values range from 0 to infinity. (The latter is attained when one of the criteria exceeds the presumed fatality level for 50% of the population.) Let us examine the case of medium- weight car drivers as an example. The OPSEM value was less than 10 in 2 cases (M^ and M^ ) whereas it was equal to infinity in 4 cases (M3, m., M^., and M^). In real-life accidents, if highway predictability characteristics were attributed to OPSEM, vehicles M^ and should have obtained the most favorable social cost indices (SCI). However, this is not the case, since the two most favorable SCI1 s were observed for vehicles M4 and Mß - M^ and especially M£ only follow later. legend- P-R-S. = Protection Rating Scale - confidence limit at 95 % level f3ratety I DRIVERS fa^J 'ty | FROHT PASSENGERS I 4 4 ' I / ' 6.. 6- I ' / N 5- 5-- / ' *67 / ' 4- ' 4- ' ' ' 169 / ' 3- ' ' 3-- i ' ^ / 2 52 303 ' ' 2,17 / 2 52 ^2'46 2 - * 2 • « 1 .91 ^&lt;71 187 V-1,43 P I 43 ^ ^ 1,16 V-1,43 P I 43 1- ^ 1- ^ / 0.80 ^ ^ / P.R.S.

Let us add that the OPSEM method is very close in concept to the pass/fail method. It only differs from the latter in its use of criteria value limits based on the risk of fatal injury. Ultimately, the OPSEM as applied to crashworthiness rating is not a good predictive tool of passive safety protection offered by a given vehicle. 4. "DRIVER/PASSENGER" COMPARISON This comparison is based on the GILLIS index measured on each dummy, and on the social cost index. (Definitions are given above.) We emphasize that the social cost index for drivers was calculated on accompanied passengers, so as not to compare the two front occupants unless they were both on board the vehicle involved in an accident. Figure 8 shows the ratio of "passenger/driver" indices for each model tested for crashworthiness rating and involved in a real-life accident. In 6 out of 14 cases, we observed convergence between crashworthiness rating tests and accident data (in 3 cases, the passenger was more adversely affected than the driver - L^, M^ , M^ - the contrary was observed in the 3 other cases - M , H , h2). In 8 cases out of 14, the results from crashworthiness rating tests and accident data were divergent. Finally, "driver/passenger" comparison reveals that predictive indicators from crashworthiness rating tests are invalidated by accident reality for most of the vehicles tested. 5. RANKING COMPARISONS FOR CRASHWORTHINESS RATING RESULTS AND ACCIDENT STATISTICS Crashworthiness rating is gradually developing into crashworthiness ranking. The difference is slight but must be explained. The consumer wants simple, comparative information; but the binary "pass/fail" system was too simple and its 2- class division was too skimpy on information.

THOMAS, ET AL. between two vehicle models which had both "passed", he wasn't any farther ahead! The division into 5 classes improves the system, but its principles remain unchanged. Crashworthiness ranking based on a continuous-evaluation scale is much more appealing. Each vehicle model not only receives a grade as if for a test, but is affected above all by existing rankings like in a competition. The results of this ranking of vehicles tested with the CRM, also have to correspond with real-life results gathered from highway accidents. Ranking of vehicles in order of decreasing merit is done for both sources of data - tests and accident data - using results quantifiable on a continuous scale. For crashworthiness rating tests, the HIC and the GILLIS index serve as the basis for ranking vehicles by model for both the driver and passenger. Ranking of the vehicle model as a whole can only be achieved with the help of the GILLIS index (which has that as its main objective) • Concerning accident data, rankings of front occupants and the vehicle itself are based on the fatality rate on the one hand, and the social cost index on the other. Table 1 gives ranking of vehicle models in each weight/mass group by seat occupied, as a function of the HIC and the GILLIS index on the one hand, and the fatality rate on the other. Table 2 is identical to Table 1, except that the social cost index replaces the fatality rate. Two appropriate classical statistical tests are used to compare rankings: the SPEARMAN ranking correlation coefficient (rg)/ and the KENDALL ranking correlation coefficient ( r&gt;. Results are given in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1 shows that the 6 rankings established according to HIC and the 9 rankings based on the GILLIS index are all significantly different (at the .05 threshold) from those indicated by fatality rates. The 15 results r of SPEARMAN and the other 15 'Y of KENDAl£ clearly prove that rankings resulting from crashworthiness rating tests are not the same as those observed on the highway. Table 2 shows that rankings established on the basis of the social cost indices are significantly different in 5 out of 6 cases from those based on the HIC, and in 8 out of 9 cases from those indicated by the GILLIS index. The lack of significant difference at the • 05 threshold between rankings according to the GILLIS index and rankings according to the social cost index was only observed for front-seat passengers in the "middle" weight/mass class vehicles. Together, the two statistical tests showed that the GILLIS index yields - with 95% certainty - a ranking comparable to that provided by the social cost index. It is observed that for front-seat passengers in "medium" cars, only KENDALL'S indicates the lack of signficant difference between ranking according to HIC and ranking according to the social cost index. The explanation for this exception probably can be found in the fact that since the "medium" vehicle group is larger, statistical tests can "tolerate" slight differences between rankings. Concerning front-seat passengers, it is conceivable that the results of criteria measured on dummies are less random than those for drivers (presence of the steering wheel). This is perhaps not without influence upon the origin of this exception. Whatever the case may be, 57 out of 60 statistical tests performed on rankings obtained from crashworthiness rating on the one hand, and from accidents on the other hand, show that the crashworthiness rating classifications are without basis. Finally, all the comparisons systematically show a clear predominance of divergences over convergences between crashworthiness rating tests and accident data. That is why it would be advisable to look for possible causes. DISCUSSION Why do results of NCAP-type tests so badly reflect real-life accidents? Among others, the three reasons below merit discussion. They concern the test itself and its interpretation, lessons learned from accidentology, and the general procedure used. The NCAP-type Test and its Interpretation - All the authors (16 to 19) join together in emphasizing the lack of consistency of repeatability for identical tests. The authors of a report intended for NHTSA indicate that in the NCAP tests, drivers' HIC can vary on an average of 45% and 700 points between two identical tests • Additionally, interpretation of criteria values measured on dummies (of which the anthropomorphism is not guaranteed) is always the subject of discussion (20), especially concerning the relationship between HIC and head AIS. Lessons Learned from Accidentology - Several research teams all over the world are scientifically studying highway accidents and injury causes. The PEUGEOT S.A. /RENAULT Association's investigation began in 1970 and includes 6000 very well-documented accidents which show that:</page><page sequence="13">CRASHWORTH INESS RATING 1.1017 TABLE 1 - MODELS RANKING COMPARISONS - "HIC AND GILLIS INDEX VERSUS FATALITY RATE"(F.R.)

It only represents 26% of the O.AIS&gt;3 for restrained occupants in frontal impacts, as opposed to twice that much when the impact is comparable to that against a 30° barrier. Besides, 34% of drivers and 60% of front-seat passengers, all O.AIS^3 and restrained, involved in frontal impacts without excessive damage to the passenger compartment, show AIS£3 injuries to other body parts than those taken into account by the 3 crashworthiness rating test criteria: "head/chest/ lower limbs". Adding a supplementary criterion for the abdomen would bring the percentages indicated above to 20% and 31%. General Procedure Used - Although various studies show that differences in passive safety protection provided by vehicles in the same weight/mass class are slight, the search for an evaluation method is not blameworthy in itself. It is nevertheless necessary for it to be reliable and verifiable by results observed on the highway, in order to prove useful. The crashworthiness rating method based on the NCAP, however, is actually nothing else but an extension of old procedures based on laboratory analysis. The FMVSS 208 Test Procedure was developed in 1971, and since then has had only very minor modifications made to it. By scorning knowledge of accident realities acquired during the past ten years, it is hardly surprising that accident statistics would invalidate the results of this type of procedure. In the future, a base of real-life, reliable data derived by trained accidentologists must be used to devise a rating system which also integrates the latest biomechanical and technological advances •• .and not the reverse, as is currently the case. CONCLUSIONS Application of the crashworthiness rating method based on NCAP testing was used on the French base of data. First, 14 well- represented models in the French vehicle fleet were tested at 35 mph against a 0° barrier, like in the NCAP. Next, due to mandatory seat belt use and the availability of a very well-documented, nationwide computerized data file covering 5.5 years, it was possible to establish a large sub- sampling particularly adapted to- comparison with the crashworthiness rating test. Conclusions drawn by vehicle weight/mass groups from NCAP-type tests and accident data are the following: The significant differences between models of the same vehicle weight/mass class are very minor (20% maximum of possible comparisons) • - The HIC measured give a different vehicle model hierarchy from that indicated by fatality rates. Results observed from the three performance categories "good/middle/bad" of the vehicle models tested for crashworthiness rating do not correlate with the corresponding fatality rates. The "Occupant Protection System Evaluation Measures" (OPSEM) calculated for each tested dummy lead to different conclusions from those indicated by accident data as expressed by the social cost index (which considers, model by model, the number of fatalities and serious injuries in relation to total persons involved). For most of the vehicle models studied, the relative "driver/passenger" severity is different for crashworthiness rating tests (GILLIS index) and accident data (social cost index ) • Finally, the classification ranking of vehicle models in crashworthiness rating tests (performed on the HIC and GILLIS index) are significantly different from those indicated by accident data (based on fatality rates and social cost indices) • Ultimately, the study's principal conclusion is that no significant correlation between NCAP-type tests and accident data exists. This unfavorable conclusion (already previously established by two American authors) in addition to numerous criticisms pertaining to unsatisfactory test repeatability, the disputable value of "measured criteria/AIS" relationships , and dummy non- representativity , strongly indicate that the present crashworthiness rating program based on NCAP tests does not have any scientific basis .
