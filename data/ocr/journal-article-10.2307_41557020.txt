<plain_text><page sequence="1">Italy and the United States: The Politics and Poetics of 'The Southern Problem' MICHAEL KREYLING Both nations were 'made' in the 1860s. One was proclaimed on March 17, 1861 ; the other began a doomed civil war for its autonomy on April 1 2, 1 86 1 . The architect of Italian unification, Count Camillo Cavour, did not live to see the national reality; he died a few months after the proclamation. Abraham Lincoln died before national unity was reclaimed. As a policy of unification, the victorious North dis- solved monasteries without anticipating negative effects on employment and social services for the poor. The victorious North dissolved the slave labour system in the defeated states without ade- quately anticipating the effect on employment and social services for the poor and black. In the southern regions of Italy the primary organisation for agricultural land use was a large holding, usually owned by one family, and rented to peasants: latifundia. In the south- ern regions of the United States the primary organization for agricultural land use was a large holding, usually owned by one fam- ily, and worked by slave labour: plantations. Southerners in the new Italy tended to view their civilisation as separate from the new nation, 'an ancient and glorious nation in its own right'.1 Southern- ers in the US tended to view their civilisation as separate within the nation as a whole, 'ancient' by New World standards, and 'glorious' by virtue of its traditions. Because of its rural nature, southern Italy is prone to diseases such as malaria and malnutrition, and to the ills of underdevelopment such as illiteracy.2 To the present day, most of the states of the American union that rank at or near the bottom in health care, education, and social services are states of the former Â©CS 2000</page><page sequence="2">44 Critical Survey , Volume 12, Number 1 Confederacy. As late as the 1950s, the southern region of Italy lan- guished with one-half the per capita income of the rest of the nation. In 1938 President Franklin Roosevelt declared the South the nation's No. 1 economic problem. In the US, conservative Southern tradi- tionalists are sometimes metaphorically called 'Bourbons'; in the South of Italy, they might actually have been Bourbons. In the respective histories of the two nations for the past century and a half the most stubborn knot in the skein of national unity has been designated 'South' and the literature produced by and about 'the South' is thought to contain an explanation of the problem. From historical novels written in the immediate circumstances of national unification or reconstruction, to ethnographic accounts of visits to a South almost equivalent to an internal undiscovered country, the literary histories of both nations exhibit similar canon- ical evolutions. More than simple coincidence may account for the parallels. It may be that the South becomes a 'new place' not only by adding new geography and social reality to a pre-existing national episteme. 'South' is also the name of a process of adding new narratives of cultural and psychological identity resembling what James Clifford, in his study of modern literature and anthro- pology, has termed 'ethnographic allegory': Twentieth-century identities no longer presuppose continuous cultures or traditions. Everywhere individuals and groups improvise local per- formances from (re)collected pasts, drawing on foreign media, symbols, and languages.3 My thesis in this essay is that the South, especially the South as embedded in the discourse suggested by the ubiquitous phrase 'The Problem of the South,' is no longer a 'continuous culture' but rather a narrative, and that a comparative study of texts in Italian/US lit- erary histories illustrates the nature of 'South' as place and process. In Confederates in the Attic: Dispatches from the Unfinished Civil War (1998), Tony Horwitz interviews several actual and vir- tual Southerners in the US as they re-enact Southern identity that can no longer be authentically enacted. Horwitz closes with a short memoir of his father, a post-Appomattox Jewish immigrant who</page><page sequence="3">The Politics and Poetics of ' The Southern Problem ' 45 found one aspect of his new American history worthy of interest, if not veneration: the rebel South. Horwitz's father's improvised mem- ories become the son's 'confederates in the attic', and he plots on his own history the problems of a 'South' originating as lived experi- ence but evolving into performative self.4 If Horwitz presents a South far gone in improvisations and reenactments of itself, he nev- ertheless suggests a new phase of Southern cultural study: the study of comparative, perhaps virtual, Souths. The historical South that fought a civil war for secession from the United States may serve as the vessel for the performative memories of the diasporic 'South- erner,' like Horwitz's father. This 'new place' for the South in virtual memory rather than in corroborated history suggests the possibility of similar historical coincidences and dynamics in national litera- tures that seem to present a parallel. Literary scholarship is not new to this form of comparative study. Latin American writers of fiction, with Vargas Llosa and Garcia Marquez in the lead, have for decades laid claim to the influence of William Faulkner and the South of doomed imperial designs, guilt, defeat, and oppression. This essay ventures beyond the 'major figure'. Coincidences linking Italian and US literature and history sug- gest strong possibilities for further comparative study of the evolving 'place' of the South in national discourse. To jump for- ward to my conclusions: parallels imply that in 'early' phases of national-cultural construction (that is, in periods of time hard upon national trauma when governments' attentions are explicitly aimed at nationalising regions) conventional (i.e. Lukacs-ian) versions of the historical novel lend themselves to cultural work. With the pas- sage of time and the accumulation of what James Clifford calls 'modernity's inescapable momentum'5, the calculus of history and literature, event and text, becomes problematic. Adapting Clifford's model of the literary critic/writer as ethnographer in the latter half of this essay, I argue that parallels between Italian and US textual- isations of our southern problem(s) involve similar politics and poetics. In what I call the latter phases, the cultural work of 'South' is not so much nationalisation as it is relief from the ennui of accomplished sameness. Issues of comparative Southernisms are more complicated as immediate trauma becomes intertwined with</page><page sequence="4">46 Critical Survey, Volume 12, Number 1 modalities of memory (Lost Causes or distanced heritage) and modern anomie , the widespread but difficult-to-pinpoint anxiety that technological progress means the impoverishment of humane pursuits. In this latter cultural environment, 'South' seems to take on a complex of meanings far more intricate than those it carries in its historical-policy incarnation. Bringing the laggard region up to national speed seems, to several constituencies, less desirable, less feasible, less possible. Northern or metropolitan intellectuals - such as, in the Italian case, Antonio Gramsci or Carlo Levi - seek to reformulate 'The Southern Problem' within boundaries of the political and the poetic. In the US, a similar complication might explain the cultural constructions of the South by Agrarian aes- thetic-conservatives as well as progressive aesthetic-liberals (most notably James Agee and Walker Evans). This essay, then, is organ- ised in two sections that might be subtitled early- and middle-historical, reserving for our present the adjective 'late'. Risorgimento and Reconstruction novels stand on a pedestal of cul- tural myth that is as old in both cases as nationalist thought. Students of southern literature in the US are familiar with the regional spectrum Thomas Jefferson enunciated in his letter to Chastellux in 1785: In the North they are cool sober laborious persevering independent jealous of their own liberties and just to those of others interested chicaning superstitious and hypocritical in their religion In the South they are fiery voluptuary indolent unsteady independent zealous for their own liberties, but trampling on those of others generous candid without attachments or pretensions to any religion but that of the heart.6 Jefferson made regional differences in climate generative of differ- ences in human and social character. By proposing a neat dichotomy, Jefferson also supplied the basic infrastructure for a system of fictional representation and narrative: specifically, the</page><page sequence="5">The Politics and Poetics of ' The Southern Problem ' 47 reconstruction romance in which traits from one category clash with those in the other, and the romance plot heals the dichotomy with the marriage outcome and the promise of offspring who rec- oncile opposing traits. The most powerful text of the traumatic nineteenth century in the US, Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), operates on this design, although Stowe did not include a reconciling mar- riage. As the slave Tom is sold from his home in Kentucky 'down the river' to New Orleans, he encounters ever more cruel and inhu- mane treatment. Progressively, his torturers inflict more 'Southern' cruelties culminating at his final stop, Simon Legree's plantation in Louisiana, where Tom is murdered. Stowe moralises Jefferson's theory. It is no surprise that southern authors, confronted with such an attack on their belief system, would rally to rebut her. For exam- ple, John Pendleton Kennedy revised his plantation novel Swallow Barn (1831) twenty years after its original publication to answer Stowe's 'libels.' After the war, the victorious North 'reconstructed' the wayward South by federal occupation from 1868-1877. This meant, in fact, that many Union army officers were sent to the former Confeder- acy to oversee the national 'repatriation' of legal and political institutions. These men came into contact with a southern female population decimated of most of the men who had gone off to war in 1861. If the demographic situation was ripe for intersectional marriages, the literary situation was overripe for romances of rec- onciliation. William R. Taylor's Cavalier and Yankee (1961) is an early exploration of cultural battle by means of such regional stereotyping. Recent articles by Karen A. Keely and Jane Turner Censer suggest that cultural studies methodologies have found rea- sons to reopen the area.7 At virtually the same moment in history, Italy was undergoing nationalization out of a wider range of sectional differences. Yet a North/South axis predominates. The idea of nationhood, came admin- istratively, philosophically, and militarily from Cavour's Piedmont (the North) and was resisted by the Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Siciles - the South, il mezzogiorno. Both nations faced the challenge of creating a unity - one nation, out of competing pockets of identity.</page><page sequence="6">48 Critical Survey , Volume 12, Number 1 Both nations' writers used literary form - the historical novel with graftings of romance - to facilitate the nationalising process. Several works in the history of Italian literature had alerted pop- ular recognition of the meaning in intersectional romance. Most literary critics and historians give Alessandro Manzoni credit for anticipating Italian national purpose in literature with I Promessi Sposi (1827), whose pair of lovers, Renzo and Lucia, are as uni- versally known in Italy as Rhett and Scarlett are in the US.8 If Manzoni's classic antedates Risorgimento, it still strives, through the romantic plot of separated lovers overcoming dangers before finally embracing, to claim an essential Italian national character. If Renzo and Lucia are less than Northern man and Southern belle, they are lovers across borders enduring political complications to the consummation of their love. Generations of Italian readers know that once the lovers are united, national unity is also part of the promise of their union. It took military action in the North and the South to enrich liter- ary material for the crucial unification novels of the latter half of the century. Works by such Southern authors as Catanian Giovanni Verga, Mastro-Don Gesualdo (1888), and Neapolitan Federico De Roberto, I VicerÃ© (1894), use romance to plot new distributions of material and cultural power in a unified nation. Verga follows the transfer of such power (via marriage) from the nobility, brought low by the 'revolutions' leading up to nationhood, to an emerging class of bourgeois landowners who make money and social posi- tion out of the wreckage of the old order. Verga's plot would be familiar to readers of US reconstruction novels: the marriage of a woman from a higher class and social order to a man from the lower who, despite his low status, possesses the energy and ambi- tion to accumulate what the upper classes are losing. Gesualdo Motta is a precursor to several US Southern characters: Ellen Glas- gow's Nicholas Burr in The Man of the People (1900) and Faulkner's Flem Snopes in The Hamlet (1940). The plots of these novels follow the money from gentry to the underclass, raising the latter and turning the status-quo social world topsy-turvy. Like Glasgow and Faulkner, Verga sees both fulfillment and failure for his upstart.</page><page sequence="7">The Politics and Poetics of ' The Southern Problem ' 49 Echoing Flem Snopes, who marries the princess of Frenchman's Bend, Eula Varner, Gesualdo marries Isabella Trao, the daughter of the local grandee. Their successful and fruitful marriage should, on the symbolic level of Mastro-Don Gesualdo, mirror the successful unification of competing interests in the political creation of Italy. Verga, however, is a pessimist. Gesualdo Motta's marriage to Isabella Trao is neither happy nor fruitful. Gesualdo is not as satanic as Flem Snopes, rather he is confused by the rapid pace of his acqui- sition of land and money. The pre-Risorgimento caste system that had, like the caste system in the Old South, kept the top rail on top, gave way to a bourgeois individualism that eventually threw a con- trolled market open to ungoverned forces. Faulkner used Snopes to revel in the crass indignity of perpetual economic accumulation, penny by penny. Verga's novel diagnoses a similarly devalued social system. As Gesualdo continues to accumulate wealth, his wishes for personal and family happiness disintegrate. Like a recurring admo- nition, the peasant woman he should have married reappears in the text, each time a more faded hint of a pre-lapsarian happiness rooted in the original Motta farm. As Gesualdo goes down in misery yet up in material wealth, he escapes into memories of a former happiness on the land - an Agrarian nostalgic dream. Verga's nobility have no such redeeming virtue.9 Federico De Roberto uses a similar plot to follow generations of the titled Uzeda family through the upheavals of revolution and republic in Sicily. I VicerÃ© (1894) bears a more formulaic resem- blance to the US reconstruction romance than Mastro- Don Gesualdo. The Uzeda family resembles the often-represented southern plantation family. They see their identity in terms of land held over generations, not in terms of their own work on the land, and in terms of inherited ('natural') social authority over the lower classes who do the work. One Uzeda son, Eugenio, becomes so obsessed with genealogy, and the social control it represents, that he drives himself mad, like the addled Jarman Posey in Allen Tate's The Fathers (1938), who likewise loses touch with reality by con- centrating too much on his family's past. Another Uzeda son, Raimondo, bears a strong resemblance to Margaret Mitchell's Ash- ley Wilkes, the male inheritor of family and regional traditions who</page><page sequence="8">50 Critical Survey, Volume 12, Number 1 is less than red-blooded in times of upheaval. Raimondo's son, Consalvo, is a scoundrel-hero similar to Scarlett O'Hara. Both sur- vive the destruction of the old order and prosper in the new, but the methods they use for survival mark them as predators - perhaps even hypocrites who lack sufficient moral vision to know or care whom they hurt on their way to survival. I VicerÃ© begins with dynastic transfer: the matriarch of the house of Uzeda chooses the third son, Raimondo, for the patrimony. Rai- mondo appears to be the best defender of the family name and social position. He might also play a part in the reconciliation romance through his announced marriage to Matilde, daughter of a nobleman who had supported the 'rivoluzione del Quarantotto' ('the revolu- tion of 1848') and had subsequently suffered exile to Malta.10 Yet, in the turbulent times leading up to 1861, Raimondo proves shallow. He confesses contempt for the benighted South and moves with his wife to Florence as the Garabaldini sweep through Palermo. Raimondo's son, Consalvo Uzeda, grows up during the 'recon- struction' of Sicily, the 'South' of I VicerÃ©. During Consalvo's youth and early manhood such progressive innovations as public works, paper money, and central banking come to his formerly feu- dal homeland. Consalvo, sensing like Scarlett O'Hara that there is money to be made in the wreck of a civilisation, becomes mayor of his town. But his motives prove self-serving. He dresses municipal firefighters in new, flashy uniforms but does not improve service. Adhering to the policy that 'image is everything', Consalvo runs the municipality into debt and escapes to Rome as a deputy to the national assembly before the bills are due. I VicerÃ© is clearly not a bullish recommendation for reconstruc- tion. De Roberto foresees a plethora of conditions undermining unification. His aristocrats prove adept at missing the point. Rai- mondo Uzeda, like Ashley Wilkes and Faulkner's Mr. Compson, wilts when the new order calls upon him. Consalvo, his son, disap- pears into the ranks of smooth profiteers - a kind of male Scarlett O'Hara, but with more sleazy self-awareness and less charm than Margaret Mitchell's archetypal figure. Perhaps the most famous Italian novel on the reconstruction theme, Sicilian Giuseppe di Lampedusa's The Leopard (1955),</page><page sequence="9">The Politics and Poetics of ' The Southern Problem ' 5 1 takes a long, dreamy look back on the transition from traditional to modern orders from the perspective of a well-established modern age. Di Lampedusa uses a simplified North/South schema. As the novel opens in May, 1860, the Bourbon South is about to be replaced by a Northern creation: the nation of Italy. Prince Fabrizio Salina, whose ancestors go back to the Byzantines, seeks refuge in Donnafugata, one of his several latifundia, or plantations, where he can still maintain the image of feudal ascendancy with himself at the apex. At Donnafugata, as on the southern plantation, history disappears and idyll prevails. The Prince's peasants (to his face) treat him with the kind of deference shown by traditional slaves to the master of the plantation; the Prince in turn shows them noblesse. But, like all idylls, this one cannot last. History forces its way back into the Prince's world in the person of Don Calogera Sedara, like Verga's Gesualdo Motta, one of the new men spawned by changes in the social and economic order. The Plebiscite of October, 1860, like Lee's surrender at Appomattox, ushers in an age of tin and the 'golden days' recede into legend. The marriage of the Prince's son Tancredi to Angelina Sedara marks the beginning of the end, for the Sedara family, in spite of Angelina's personal beauty, represents the 'ignorant vulgarity' of the unrefined under- class.11 The recession of the old aristocratic order results in a social and economic vacuum (or opportunity), and the Snopes/Sedara are inducted into a new order that exposes the ruthlessness of acquisi- tion years of aristocratic myth have burnished almost to a blinding sheen. Prince Fabrizio Salina himself succumbs to the inevitability of the new order when he declines nomination to the newly-created office of Senator; a nobleman with genealogical ties to Byzantium would only be dishonoured by such a public title. He suggests Don Calogera Sedara instead.12 Di Lampedusa is quite clear on the Prince's motivation: the old aristocrat possesses too much inflexi- ble pride in the old order, is too identified with/in The Past. W. J. Cash, whose The Mind of the South (1941) is still cited as authori- tative in such issues, sketched the US version of this character type under the label 'the savage ideal'.13 The Leopard concludes in the early years of the twentieth cen- tury; the remnants of the Salina family are threadbare, and the</page><page sequence="10">52 Critical Survey, Volume 12, Number 1 Catholic authorities cart away their private religious relics to the trash. An earlier prelate, Fr. Pirrone, had extolled noblesse oblige and explained the hierarchical social order, like a true Old South cavalier, by a theory of natural aristocracy.14 But that was 1861. The priest who comes to confiscate the survivors' religious charms was not a Sicilian, he was not even a Southerner or a Roman, and many years before he had tried to leaven with Northern activity the inert and heavy dough of the island's spiritual life in general and the clergy's in particular. Flanked by two or three secretaries from his own parts, he had deluded himself, those first years, that he could remove abuses and clear the soil of its more obvious stumbling blocks. But soon he had to realize that he was, as it were, firing into cotton wool . . .15 Spiritual or economic, the life of the South is represented as resistant to 'improvement' by the North. Reconstruction novels written during the Italian unification period, or those like The Leopard, written in reminiscence of that period, hew to a dichotomy similar to the one operating in US literary history. The regions produce two different, and opposed, types of character and society. Amalgamation, touted as a plank in unification political programmes, is in practice elusive or impossible. The peasants of mezzogiorno, like the crackers of the South, are too miserably educated and too inured to centuries of feu- dal hierarchy to learn what their saviours from the North have to teach. Antonio Gramsci, who knew 'The Southern Problem' by virtue of being born and bred a Sardinian, could repeat the litany: It is well known what kind of ideology has been disseminated on a vast scale by bourgeois propagandists among the masses in the North: that the South is the ball and chain that is holding back the social development of Italy; that Southerners are biologically inferior beings, semi-baibarians or complete barbarians by natural destiny; that if the South is backward, the fault does not lie with the capitalist system or any other historical cause, but with Nature, which made Southerners lazy, inept, criminal and barbaric - only tempering this cruel fate with the purely individual explosion of a few great geniuses, who stand like solitary palm trees in an arid, barren desert.16 Gramsci wrote this in the mid- 1920s, shortly before he was incar- cerated by Mussolini. It could have been written by US</page><page sequence="11">The Politics and Poetics of ' The Southern Problem ' 53 Southerners of a range of political persuasions, the Vanderbilt Agrarians or the Chapel Hill progressives. Mencken's imagery in 'The Sahara of the Bozart' (1917) uncannily predicts Gramsci's own desert imagery. The convergence of imagery, and the shift of the South's positioning from historical discourse to a discourse of ideology brings the Souths of the US and Italy into even closer overlay in the twentieth century. The passage from history to ideology can be seen in the usage and the users of South in both Italy and the US as the deployment of the South in the formulation of political policy discourses waned. With the dismissive phrase 'it is well known', Gramsci implies that the ideological rendition of South can be manipulated by anyone and for a range of purposes, not necessarily having to do with immediate social change. One such example of ideological manipulation occurs in Norman Douglas's South Wind (US, 1920). Set in a thinly-disguised Capri where Douglas could live a rela- tively open homosexual life, South Wind resembles its near-contemporary in Faulkner's early work: Mosquitoes (1927). The same blurb could apply to both novels: As the south wind blows and the characters in both novels mostly just talk, their talk, in the 'semi-barbaric' medium of the southern ideological climate, ranges freely over subject matters ruled out of order in Northern, or official, discourse: desire, sex, transgression. Early in South Wind, Douglas distinguishes between the English (Northern) clergyman Mr. Heard, Anglican bishop of Tampopo, and the sophisticated Southern priest, Don Francesco: Worldly-wise, indolent, good-natured and, like most Southerners, a thor- ough-going pagan, Don Francesco was deservedly popular as ecclesiastic. Women adoied him; he adored women. He passed for an unrivaled preacher; his golden eloquence made converts everywhere, greatly to the annoyance of the pyrrhic, the parish priest, who was doubt- less sounder on the Trinity but a shocking bad orator and altogether deficient in humanity ... 17 Douglas, deploying Gramsci's formula, depicts an ideological as well as a travelogue South. The immediate purpose is to undermine</page><page sequence="12">54 Critical Survey , Volume 12, Number 1 official religion. Don Francesco's southernised character traits - indolence rather than industry, sensuality rather than moral strict- ness, style rather than doctrinal or intellectual rigour, warmth of humanity over analytical intellect - redistribute the authority of orthodox religion with respect to human behaviour. In other words, in the figure of Don Francesco desire cohabits with religion, and 'Southerness' as 'text' makes that mixture of pure and impure top- ics possible. Another Southerner in South Wind , Count Caloveglia, presents his own theories on what makes a southerner superior and distinct: But as for other Northern men, the enlightened ones - I cannot help thinking that they will come to their senses again one of these days. Oh yes! They will recover their sanity. They will perceive under what artifi- cial and cramping conditions, under what false standards, they have been living; they will realize the advantages of a climate where nature meets you half-way. I know little of England but the United States are pretty familiar to me; the two climates, I imagine, cannot be very dissimilar. That a man should wear himself to the bone in the acquisition of mater- ial gain is not pretty. But what else can he do in lands adapted only for wolves and bears?18 Climate is at the foundation of all difference; the farther North one goes the more acquisitive and greedy, the farther South the more gracious and humane. Jefferson wrote an early draft; the Count brushes it up. In both texts it is an example of ideology in operation, ideology used to expose and critique official reality from the dis- tance of the marginal. This positioning is perhaps clearer in the words of yet another exile from the North in Douglas's novel, the Scotsman Keith, for in Keith Douglas utilises the trope of the exotic, and with the exotic the outlines of Clifford's ethnographic allegory begin to appear: Perhaps this capacity of the Southern scenery to bear a mortal inter- pretation accounts for the anthropomorphic deities of classical days. I often think it does. Even we moderns are unaccountably moved by its varying facets which act sometimes as an aphrodisiac, and sometimes by their very perfection, their discouraging spell, their innocent beauty, suggest the hopelessness of all human endeavour ,..19</page><page sequence="13">The Politics and Poetics of ' The Southern Problem ' 55 The southern place, Keith goes on to say, is not simply natural. Rather, the South is a supernatural place where human ideas and moods are changed into religion. The North cannot be supernatural, it is always a place of spiritual exile: They [the native people of Nepenthe-Capri-the South] do what you cannot so effectually do in the North; they humanize it, identifying its various aspects with their own moods, its features with their own tra- ditions.'20 Refuge in the 'South', then, is refuge in what Clifford categorises as the 'exotic', an aesthetic and cultural artefact used 'as a primary court of appeal against the rational, the beautiful, the normal of the West'.21 1 contend here that, with the waning of historical urgency, the South emerges as a cultural tropes (losing much of its function as a geographical designation), not least of which is the Other or the exotic, which James Clifford ranks as one of the most powerful determinants of modern life. A new narrative supplants or revises the reconciliation romance narrative: the narrative of exile and (perhaps) return. Historical circumstances - the continuing resistance of both Souths to the economic progress of the respective Norths - proved an ambiva- lent trigger mechanism for the function of South as exotic release. But, if the Souths in both national cases continue to be perceived and rep- resented as backward and resistant to change and progress, there is a rear-guard contingent of Northern intellectuals and esthetes who sur- reptitiously reveal an interest in keeping the South 'barbaric.' Gramsci, from his ideological position as a Communist, clearly saw the bour- geois political interests to be garnered by preventing the coalition of Southern peasants and Northern proletariat; he agitated to make both classes aware of the divide-and-conquer strategy. In his early writings, he only saw "The Southern Problem' in terms of politics, not in more fine-grained terms of cultural narratives. To a certain intelligentsia in both US and Italian Norths, keeping the South primitive was a vital interest. Clifford's study of modern enthnographers suggests one rea- son: the hunger in modernist consciousness for appropriating the Other as an antidote to its (our) own anomie.22 The professional ethnogra- phers whom Clifford studies needed the Nuer peoples or the Bororo, or</page><page sequence="14">56 Critical Survey, Volume 12, Number 1 exhibitions of their artefacts in metropolitan museums, as escape routes from the dead-end of bourgeois subjectivity. For other 'ethnog- raphers,' however, the South functioned as an internal Other. Two texts, almost contemporaiy, illustrate this crossover of usages: James Agee and Walker Evans's Let Us Now Praise Famous Men (1941) and Carlo Levi's Cristo si Ã¨ fermato a Eboli ( Christ Stopped at Eboli ), pub- lished in 1945. Both books record the expedition and/or exile of urban intellectuals in their respective Souths. Agee was sent by Fortune magazine in July 1 936 to tour the South in order to discover what was keeping the region from emerging from the Great Depression. Levi, a Socialist painter and writer in Turin who became a small stone in the Fascist shoe, was sent into internal exile in Basilicata, a remote and mountainous region south and inland of Naples, on the grounds that he harboured ideas harmful to the State. He was shuttled from village to village lest the locals learn too much of the outside world. Levi's year of exile was 1935-1936, one year before Antonio Gramsci (considered a more lethal threat to the State) died in prison after ten years of a twenty year sentence. Levi's written record of his exile was not published for ten years. The story of Agee, a writer, and Walker Evans, a photographer, is more widely known. Evans, a documentary photographer with the Farm Security Administration, was to capture in images what Agee would explain with the written word. Their 'internal exile' was Alabama, a fair US equivalent to Basilicata. Fortune declined what the two produced, but Houghton Mifflin published an expanded version in 1941. To James Agee, even though he had been born in Tennessee, the natives of the sharecropping, rural south were as exotic as undiscov- ered tribes in the Amazon rain forest. Every moment he spends with the Woods or Gudger or Ricketts sharecropper families is a moment redolent of the encounter of ethnographer and primitive tribe, initiat- ing scene in the 'ethnographic allegory' as Clifford reads its pattern: Moreover, all really simple and naive people incline strongly toward exact symmetries, and have some sort of instinctive dislike that any one thing shall touch any other save what it rest on . . ,23 Because, as he amply shows in his text, he sensed his own life a maelstrom of sexual, political, aesthetic, and class anxieties, Agee-</page><page sequence="15">The Politics and Poetics of ' The Southern Problem * 57 the-modern projects his desired order on the poor. Since the South is the reduced condition in which the 'really simple and naive' can exist, the South then is open for ideological and psychological fieldwork serving a range of Agee's needs: if he could merge with the exotic poor, he could purge his modern guilt. As he professes to try to understand their lives as 'light, casual, totally actual'24 , Agee also clearly attempts to justify himself as the consumer of their lives' work. His supercharged prose appropriates their lives as folk aesthetic objects - suitable for collection and museum display - and Evans's images seal the transformation. One of Agee's descriptions of a sharecropper shack is particularly impli- cated in his role as aesthetic consumer and curator. After minutely inventorying the things arrayed about the interior, Agee takes to meta-commentary : It is my belief that such houses as these approximate, or at times by chance achieve, an extraordinary 'beauty.' In part because this is ordi- narily neglected or even misrepresented in favor of their shortcomings as shelters; and in part because their esthetic success seems to me even more important than their functional failure; and finally out of the uncontrollable effort to be faithful to my personal predilections, I have neglected function in favor of esthetics.25 At frequent junctures in the text, Agee invokes a modern pantheon of holy madmen - Blake, Celine, Kafka, and others - as if seeking identification with the visionary company of wretched, alienated seers. At other moments, he recognises that his acts of contempla- tion have been appropriated by the museum consciousness of his caste and class: a particular scene metamorphoses in his vision from 'rembrandÅ¥ to photograph.26 None of this internal conflict is lost on Agee; like Kafka, he is a connoisseur of his own suffering, guilt, and the psychic mecha- nisms that perpetuate them. In fact, retelling the story of his guilt functions as his attempt to exorcise it: If I were going to use these lives of yours for 'Art,' if I were going to dab at them here, cut them short here, make some trifling improvement over here, in order to make you worthy of The Saturday Review of Literature, I would just now for instance be very careful of Anticlimax which, you</page><page sequence="16">58 Critical Survey, Volume 12, Number 1 must understand, is just not quite nice. It happens in life of course, over and over again, in fact there is no such thing as a lack of it, but Art, as all of you would understand, if you had had my advantages, has nothing to do with Life, or no more to do with it than is thoroughly convenient at a given time ...21 Agee uses his exile first to exoticise the South, then to position himself within the Other in such a way as to expose and possibly to exorcise his guilt for not knowing or caring enough as a member of the class consuming it. A self-proclaimed Communist (often with- out the upper case 'C'), Agee found himself working for arch-capitalist Henry Luce, who owned Fortune. Clearly, the writer suffered severe internal contradictions that the elemental life he imagined for the rural southern poor offset. Levi creates the same prehistorical existence for the rural south- ern people to whom he was dispatched by a paranoid Fascist government. The title of Levi's memoir, as translated into English - Christ Stopped at Eboli - can be misleading. A more effective translation might be 'Christ Never Got as Far as Eboli'. Levi wished to signal with his title that Eboli, like the rural Alabama of Agee's memoir, had not yet entered History (the standard segrega- tion of historical time between B.C. and A.D.): Many years have gone by [Levi's opening chapter begins], years of war and of what men call History. Buffeted here and there at random I have not been able to return to my peasants as I promised when I left them, and I do not know when, if ever, I can keep my promise. But closed in one room, in a world apart, I am glad to travel in my memory to that other world, hedged in by custom and sorrow, cut off from His- tory and the State, eternally patient, to that land without comfort or solace, where the peasant lives out his motionless civilization on bar- ren ground in remote poverty, and in the presence of death.28 Like Agee, the modern Levi, far from the comforts of Turin in the North, loses his sense of time after a few days in the South. He becomes convinced that he has passed beyond or beneath history by living with a people who have themselves (like Agee's 'primi- tives') been bypassed by modern life. To Levi, 'magic' explains both the South's history and its metaphysics. Giulia, his first house-</page><page sequence="17">The Politics and Poetics of ' The Southern Problem ' 59 keeper, Levi ultimately decides, is a witch; nothing else can explain her power over him and the village. And Levi observes a young, malarial boy mimic his painting gestures with cobbled-together materials, believing that a 'painting' will appear like magic.29 Also like Agee, instead of trying to interrogate the history that has marginalised the people of his exile, Levi prefers to turn them into aesthetic objects by painting their portraits, their things, their landscapes. Evans's photographic images of the sharecroppers and their houses captured the special 'beauty' Agee reserved for the poor, and labelled 'classicism'.30 To his cosmopolitan eye, Agee confessed, usage of the word 'classicism' obscured the real depri- vation of means and materials that permitted only shacks, nothing like a house. And he was candid about the appropriation of those substandard dwellings as aesthetic objects: To those who own and create it this 'beauty' is, however, irrelevant and undiscernible. It is best discernible to those who by economic advantages of training have only a shameful and thief's right to it: and it might be said that they have any 'rights' whatever only in proportion as they recognize the ugliness and disgrace implicit in their privilege of perception.31 Evans's photographs, Agee's verbal fugues, Levi's portraits and memoir turn the southerners into commodities in an economy of aesthetic perception, a voyeurism, leaving action to the unseemly and the naive. Levi himself blocks peasant action. Late in his exile he is called to attend a man with a ruptured appendix. Levi had made, and rev- elled in, something of a reputation as a shaman by practising rudimentary (but modern) medicine in the countryside. His jailers, fearful of his reputation, banned him from giving such aid. In the case of the man suffering the ruptured appendix, Levi notes, his aid would have done no good: the man was too far gone and Levi him- self had no instruments or skill for surgery. Still, his peasants considered him a Dr. Schweitzer, and when news of the man's ago- nising death reached the village the peasants mobilised to revolt: Revolt was in the air. The peasants' deep sense of justice had been out- raged and, gentle, passive, and resigned as they were, impervious to</page><page sequence="18">60 Critical Survey, Volume 12, Number 1 political reasoning and party slogans, they felt stirring in them the old spirit of the brigands. These downtrodden folk have always been given to wilful and ephemeral explosions ... That day, if I had wished, I might have put myself at the head of several hundred brigands and have either laid siege to the village or fled to the wilds. For a moment I was sorely tempted, but in 1936 the time was not yet ripe. Instead, after considerable effort, I managed to calm the peasants.32 Realistically, the peasants were probably better off not taking arms against the better-equipped and more numerous forces of the State. Ideologically, however, it is also fitting that Levi prevented them from claiming agency, and entitlement to history. The modern, enmeshed in the role of ethnographer, must confess an interest in keeping the primitive in his/her place. If the aesthetic construct should speak, hail the 'thief' in the act of making away with the image, then the voyeur would be revealed. Agee has no solution to the material problem of the South. Even though he identifies himself 'by sympathy and conviction a Com- munist', Let Us Now Praise Famous Men carries no call to action, no programme.33 Agee might rail against other intellectuals who show concern for the economic problems of the southern share- cropper, but he does not venture his own (even partial) solution. Levi, a Socialist, is less aloof. His call to action, however, preserves the South as a kind of aesthetic enclave. Rejecting solely Fascist, Communist, and 'even Liberal' forms of government as wrong for the South, and for Italy, Levi proposes a kind of mythic preserve for the rural South, a privileged historical and social status exempt from change and eerily like that proposed by the Twelve Southerners who contributed to I'll Take My Stand (1930).34 Those Agrarians were avowed conservatives, even proud reactionaries, yet Levi's conclu- sion sounds, in part, like theirs: The State can only be a group of autonomies, an organic federation. The unit or cell through which the peasants can take part in the com- plex life of the nation must be the autonomous or self-governing rural community. This is the only form of government which can solve in our time the three interdependent aspects of the problem of the South; which can allow the co-existence of two different civilizations, without one lording it over the other or weighing the other down; which can</page><page sequence="19">The Politics and Poetics of 'The Southern Problem' 61 furnish a good chance for escape from poverty; and which, finally, by the abolition of the powers and functions of the landowners and the local middle class, can assure the peasants a life of their own, for the benefit of all.35 Levi and Agee needed 'the co-existence of two different civiliza- tions,' I would argue, not for political reasons having to do with the functions and relative powers of classes and parties, but for psycho- logical reasons having to do with their respective senses of displacement as modern intellectuals faced with the economic render- ing of their work and the lurking sense of obligation and guilt they felt face-to-face with the conditions of 'the wretched of the earth'.36 Bor- rowing that phrase from Fanon, I also suggest his concept of the co-opted bourgeois intellectual who is torn between identification with the victim and the pleasures of favour. I propose, in this comparative essay juxtaposing Italian and US texts exploring the historical and ide- ological meanings of 'South,' that in both nations the historical urgency of the region gave way, over time, to its deployment in a net- work of cultural politics. This politics negotiates both more and less than the actual South. The 'more and less' of my reference is the com- plex creation of centre and margin internal to a nation (Italy, the US) deliberately and then perennially in the throes of self-creation. The South functions in the earlier stage of nationhood as a tractable set of material circumstances which, by means of implementation of a polit- ical programme, can be made to change from something unlike the self or centre to another version of it. Later, when it is clear that the prob- lem of the South is its intractable Otherness, a different model - that of the ethnographer as critic - enshrines the South's changelessness, for it is that mythic changelessness that relieves the modern of the burden of modern history he/she has wrought.
