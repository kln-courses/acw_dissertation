Carter With a foreword by Lawrence Kohlberg This introduction to the philosophy of moral education is rooted in the Socratic method of teaching and learning and has extensive implications for moral educators today who are attempting to steer a course between the pressing claims of moral relativism on the one hand and moral absolutism on the other. Carter examines the fashionable Values Clarification approach, then critically analyses Kohlberg's stages of moral judgment and focuses on the importance of the person in existential thought. $27.50 cloth, $10.00 paper University of Toronto Press 33 East Tupper St., Buffalo NY 14203 Without Proof or Evidence By O. K. Bouwsma Edited by J. L. Craft and Ronald E. Hustwit The eleven essays presented treat the troubled questions of knowledge, belief, and faith, and the shadowy borders between them. Bouwsma discusses the authoritative voice of the Bible, the writings of theologians like Saint Anselm and S0ren Kierkegaard, and the snarling letters of the arch-atheist Friedrich Nietzsche. Without Proof or Evidence engages a central philosophical problem of our time, perhaps of any time: How are we able to understand language that lacks logical or scientific certainty? What is the place of religion in that realm of possibility, intuition, and doubt? "This will quite likely be one of the most important books in philosophy issued by any publisher in this decade." ?

"Koh?k has launched a splendid counter-attack against the Western desanctification of nature, against the dehumanization of both our arts and sciences . . .

The Imperative of Responsibility In Search of an Ethics for the Technological Age Hans Jonas Jonas rethinks the foundations of ethics in light of the awesome transformations wrought by modern technology. For the first time, ethics is forced to look beyond the direct, immediate dealings between people and consider actions that have an unprecedented causal reach into the future. Jonas argues that respon sibility, with no less than the fate of humanity for its object, must be moved to the center of the ethical stage.
