TAYLOR Reader in Islamics at the Selly Oak Colleges SOME ASPECTS OF ISLAMIC ESCHATOLOGY' WORLDMANSHIP AND OTHER-WORLDMANSHIP To a student audience seduced by the claims of a 'secular Christianity', Professor Gordon Rupp once urged the combined loyalties of 'worldman ship' and 'other-worldmanship'. The Muslim world shows little friendship to secularist ideologies which explicitly reject the eschatological dimension, but Muslims are increasingly involved in secularising processes; many of these are 'Islamised', if they are compatible with Islamic social or political ideals, and the stigma of bid'ah, innovation, is thereby avoided. A Lebanese author, Muhammad Darwazah, in his Dustur al-Qur'dni, Cairo I956, advocated a 'Qur'anic Constitution' for the modern world since the Qur'an's world-view is both in-worldly and other-worldly: 'Islam is a religion of the world (din al-dunyd), of government, society, morals and order, to the same extent as it is a religion of faith and belief and the next world (din al-dkhirah). '2 Modern Muslims, like modern Christians, are aware of a polarity in their world-view; this polarity must be retained in the perspective of the adherent and of the sensitive observer. A government or a scholar who plans for some utopian society in purely materialistic or administrative terms will be in danger of forfeiting the confidence of a pious peasantry and of a not insignificant section of the intelligentsia; one thinks of continued world-wide support for the Muslim Brotherhood. It is unfair to dub such piety as fatalist, escapist or obscurantist. Those for whom the Judgement of the Last Day (yawm al-din) is a reality may be all the more concerned for their social conscience and for their political responsibilities. The influential Indian, Abdul Hasan 'All Nadawl, eloquent for the retrieval of the former glories of the Muslim world, wrote in his Islam and the World, first published in Cairo in 1950, and since translated into Urdu and English: 'The Muslim states are exhibiting the same materialistic tendencies which are the hallmark of the Western Social System. The same enslavement to earthly longings is fast becoming the creed of the community the corner-stone of whose 1 A paper prepared for the September I967 meeting of the British Branch of the Intemational Association for the History of Religions. 2 M.

Its solicitude for After-life is declining day by day. It is subordinating its ethical principles to material ex pediency with a cheerful readiness that is really astonishing. In some respects the Muslims are actually outdoing the Western races in glorification of material wealth.' . . . 'The secret of a Muslim's strength lies in his faith in the Divine recompense and reward in the After-life." Perhaps one may place in juxtaposition with this another fervent vindication of the Islamic world-view; Sayyid Qutb, in his Social justice in Islam, con trasts this not with Western materialism but with a supposed other-worldli ness in the Christian tradition: 'Christianity forgot about "Render unto Caeser the things that are Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's". It took its stand upon the ground that "Religion concerns only a man and his God".' . . . 'Europe is compelled to put religion apart from the common life.'2 The themes of other-worldliness and materialism have been acrimoniously and repetitiously treated in the course of Christian-Muslim confrontation; it has been too easy to contrast, for example, the Christian social conscience with Islamic fatalism, or the Caliphate at its height with the Church at its self-seeking worst; both parties have been guilty. In inter-religious study and converse one should rather study each tradition in its own right and eschew invidious comparisons; some comparison is legitimate, as when a Christian registers his own ineradicable criteria as affecting to some extent his optics in his study of Islam. A Christian who seeks an objective appre ciation of Islamic eschatology may have added insight by virtue of his own subjective convictions. If one's own expectation of the Resurrection Day is not just a looking-forward-to but also a looking-out-upon, if realisation is added to anticipation, then one may understand the force of the oft-repeated prayer of the Prophet, as he awoke from sleep, that 'little brother of Death': 'Praise be to God who brought us to life after He had caused us to die, and to Him is our resurrection.'3 The scope of this paper must be limited to an enquiry into the way in which Muslims have integrated their eschatological orientation with their worldly experiences. Exhaustive descriptions and complete historical coverage would be impossibly unwieldly; we shall look briefly at the time of the Prophet, and then mainly at the 'synchronic surface' of the century of the Mongol invasion. This may show us how a range of Muslim individuals and sects, some of whom lived under the threat or with the memory of an almost apocalyptic destruction of the centres of the Muslim world in the seventh century A.H. (thirteenth century A.D.), interpreted the teaching of the Qur'an and the teachings and example of the Prophet, with special I Abdul HIasan Nadawi, Islam and the World (Lahore), I96I, pp. i8o and i86. 2 Sayyid Qutb, Social Justice in Islam (Washington, I953), pp. 4 and I4. 3 C.

The survival of mediaeval categories to the present day in the Muslim world, and to some extent the continued de pendence upon them and the reluctance to formulate fresh theological language and symbolism, mean that we shall not only indulge our historical curiosity, but may also illuminate the present situation where we try to find themes for constructive dialogue. The issue of eschatology may be in itself conducive to our mutual understanding as we are reminded that judgement is the prerogative of God, and as we find that our expectation of the trumpet blast introduces a measure of urgency into the task of reconciliation of man with man. Finally this is an area where neither party can presume to know all the answers. Jalal al-Din Ruimi (I207-I273) wrote: 'Every sort of religious sect foresaw the end (according to their own surmise): of necessity they fell captive to error. To foresee the end is not (as simple as) a hand-loom; otherwise how would there have been differences in religions?'" The metaphor of the hand-loom is used elsewhere in the Mathnawi to denote the idea of 'do-it-yourself'. Insight into eschatology is an appre hension of faith rather than comprehension grown of study. We shall trace the inter-play of Muslims' 'worldmanship' and 'other worldmanship' through three areas: first, the promises and threats of a didactic eschatology; second, the symbolic descriptions of an apocalyptic eschatology; third, the contemplative expectations and experiences of a mystical eschatology. We are wont to characterise. Muslims' mentality as either backward-looking as they refer back to the salaf, the normative days of the Prophet and orthodox caliphs, or else mundanely legalistic and political. Yet there are those for whom the message of the past and the prime duty of the present are to prepare for the Resurrection Day, on which, in the words given by Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, (I I49-I209): 'Everyone will say, "My people, my people", and the Fire will say, "My due, my due", and the worshipper will say "My Lord, my Lord", and the Lord will say, "My worshipper, my worshipper".'2 DIDACTIC ESCHATOLOGY The Qur'an reveals the ethical nature rather than the philosophical essence of God. God, as merciful yet strictJudge, calls forth men's awe and obedience. The Day of Judgement (rawm al-din) (Suirah I, v. 3, etc.) is also the Day of Reckoning (rawm al-.Hisdb) (S. 6o, v. 28) and the Day of Separation (rawm al-Fa.sl) (S. 77, v. I4). The Qur'an is very much a book of promise and threat (wa'd wa-wa'id) concerning men's reward or punishment on the Last Day. Descriptions of the Day, of Paradise (jannah) and of Hell (jahannam) are frequent (and even lurid, when the purpose of a passage is to warn, or denounce, disbelievers).

TAYLOR A typical group of early Meccan suirahs, 8i to 84, paint swift and vivid pictures of the terrors of that Day. The titles of these suarahs alone are sug gestive: 'The Darkening', 'The Splitting', 'The Stinters', 'The Rending'. The scepticism of those who denied the resurrection of the body is assailed in verses such as the following in S. 82, VV. 9-I6 and S. 83, vv. 9-17: '... you cry lies to the Doom; yet there are over you watchers noble, writers who know whatever you do. Surely the pious shall be in bliss, and the libertines shall be in a fiery furnace roasting therein on the Day of Doom nor shall they ever be absent from it.' 'Woe that day to those . . . who cry lies to the Day of Doom; and none cries lies to it but every guilty aggressor When our signs are recited to him, he says, "Fairy-tales of the ancients!" No indeed; but that they were earning has rusted upon their hearts No indeed; but upon that day they shall be veiled from their Lord, then they shall roast in Hell. Then it shall be said to them, "This is that you cried lies to." Another probably early surah, Sarah 55, 'The All-Merciful', speaks of how all the blessings of this life must perish; it describes Hell in verses 41-44, and Paradise in verses 46-76: 'The sinners shall be known by their mark, and they shall be seized by their forelocks and their feet. O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny? This is Gehenna, that sinners cried lies to; they shall go round between it and between hot, boiling water.' 'But such as fears the Station of his Lord, for them shall be two gardens ... abounding in branches ... therein two fountains of running water ... therein of every fruit two kinds ... reclining upon couches lined with brocade, the fruits of the gardens nigh to gather ... therein maidens restraining their glances, untouched before them by any man or jinn ... lovely as rubies, beautiful as coral ... Shall the recompense of goodness be other than goodness?'</page><page sequence="5">SOME ASPECTS OF ISLAMIC ESCHATOLOGY 6I .... And besides these shall be two gardens . . . green, green pastures .. therein two fountains of gushing water ... therein fruits, and palm-trees and pomegranates ... therein maidens good and comely .... houris cloistered in cool pavilions ... untouched before them by any man or jinn . . . reclining upon green cushions and lovely druggets O which of your Lord's bounties will you and you deny?' It seems best to allow the Qur'an to have spoken for itself in refuting the harsh criticism of some Western scholars. Miguel Asin Palacios, in his famous work Islam and the Divine Comedy, is appreciative of the deep spirituality of the eschatology of many Muslim mystics and philosophers, and yet he refers more than once to 'the coarse and sensual materialism of the paradise depicted in the Koran'.' This author dismisses Muhammad as 'a polygamist and warrior who led men to battle'.2 And yet it was precisely from the Qur'an and from the life of the Prophet that the mystics and philosophers of Islam took their primary inspiration: it was the verses of the Qur'an and the traditions concerning the Prophet upon which they meditated and which they took as the yardstick by which to judge any spontaneous or any second hand ideas. Carra de Vaux repeats the charge of materialism and adds, 'God does not appear in the Kur'anic descriptions of Paradise'.3 This is surely a literalism worse than the offending materialism! The rewards of the gardens of Paradise are implicitly and sometimes explicitly the marks of Divine mercy; in the unabridged version of the suirah last quoted every detail of Paradise is punctuated with the refrain: 'O which of your Lord's mercies will you and you deny?' At the Judgement itself, and surely thereafter in the memories of the blessed and damned, is the confrontation which is the spiritual climax of the pil grimage of each soul-the doctrine of Beatific Vision (ru'yah) as well as all the wealth of mystical aspiration and apocalyptic description stems from this too. Siurah 75 is known as 'The Resurrection'; we are referring to verse 22: 'Upon that day faces shall be radiant, gazing upon their Lord.' Predictably this 'vision' is not allowed to be understood in a materialist sense, as Muslim commentators are swift to assert; for example, the creed of al-Nasafi (io68-I 142), among the most influential from mediaeval times to the present, states: 'A proof on authority has come down affirming that Believers have a vision of Allah in the abode of the next World. And He is seen (unlike any material being) 1 M. Asin Palacios, Islam and the Divine Comedy (London, I 926), p. 136. 2 Ibid., p. 24. 3 Carra de Vaux, in article 'Djanna', Shorter E.

TAYLOR not in place or in a direction so far as being confronted, nor by the conjunction of the rays of light, nor by a certain definite distance between the one who sees and Allah.'" In supporting this orthodox stand as to the vision of God, Fakhr al-Din al-Razi writes in his Muhassal of the traditional proofs (al-dald'il al-sam'iah). After citing the case of Moses, whose request for ru'yah would have been 'useless and ignorant' (impossible for a Prophet) if vision were impermissible, he quotes Siurah 75 verse 22 and says that the word which Arberry translates as 'gazing' must either mean 'ru'yah' or else 'the twisting of the eyeballs as if in seeing and (only) seeking after ru'yah'.2 He dismisses the latter inter pretation as straining the obvious meaning. Nor can this gazing carry the idea of expectation, for this, says al-Razi, would be a 'cause of grief'. It is clear that even for a jurist-cum-theologian like al-Razi the Last Day holds not only terror but also, for the elect, the fulfilling adoration of the veil's being lifted: al-kashf al-tdmm. An article on 'The Resurrection and Judgement in the Kor'an' by Dalton Galloway concentrates almost entirely on the horrendous elements, and gives little space to the promises which are an almost invariable accom panying alternative for those who will repent. Galloway's image of Muham mad as like a 'revivalist preacher . . . dangling an audience over the terrors of the future torments'3 gives a wilfully one-sided view of the Qur'an. The suggestion that the Qur'an reflects an 'obsession'4 in Muhammad with the Last Day, which grew less as he had political success, is not borne out by plausible datings which indicate that many of the examples and threats of Divine punishment in this world and the next are set in the context of continuing opposition to the Prophet in the later stages of his ministry; in any case an early date for a suirah by no means argues that this siirah was never recited again thereafter. The eschatological dimension seems present throughout the Qur'an as Montgomery Watt concludes: 'The conception of a resurrection ofjudgement, followed by reward or punishment, is present from the very beginning, but that fear of punishment does not seem to have been the main driving motive behind the Islamic religion.'5 The Qur'an is impregnated with a typically Semitic sense of the awesome ness of God; but there is no capriciousness in his strict justice. God's guidance and God's forgiveness are available to all who do not stubbornly and self sufficiently invite his leading-astray and his anger. The availability of this guidance and forgiveness is one of the conditions of life before Judgement 1 al-TaftazanI, Sharh 'ald al-'Aqa'id al-Nasaff (Istanbul, 1326), p. 107 and ed. E. E.

It is a tactic of anti-Muslim polemic to ignore the promises which accompany the Qur'anic threats, or to debase those promises into a materialist literalism empty of symbolic value. The conservative Hanball with sufi leanings, 'Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani (d. II67) is quoted by Miss Padwick at the end of her remarkable book Muslim Devotions: 'He said to me, 0 help from the Almighty, if men knew what was after death they would take no pleasure in the life of the world below but would say before Me every moment, every instant, 0 Lord give me death. Then he said to me, There is no more companionship and pleasure even in Paradise, once I have appeared there, and no more loneliness and burning in hell once I have addressed its people.'" That this is not untypical of the spirituality of the Prophet Muhammad himself is confirmed by the closing pages of the biography by Ibn Ishaq; just before his being confined to bed in his last illness he took one of his freedmen to pray in the cemetery: 'Peace upon you, 0 people of the graves! Happy are you that you are so much better off than men here.' . . . Then he turned to me and said "I have been given the choice between the keys of the treasuries of this world and long life here followed by Paradise, and meeting my Lord and Paradise (at once)." I urged him to choose the former, but he said that he had chosen the latter.'2 The Jdhiltyah, the Age of Ignorance before the coming of Islam, had disparaged this world, where man was but a pawn of inexorable Time and Death. There is other-worldliness in the Qur'an too; but whereas the Jahili solution is to recommend hedonism in this life, the Qur'an looks to a future reward for man's present faith and good works. Yet the sensual imagery of the Qur'anic Paradise, while giving ample room for spiritual interpretation, does also imply an approval of sensual pleasures; the orthodox, including al-Ash'arl and al-Ghazali, allowed that there could be sensual pleasure in Paradise.3 The doctrine that Heaven and Hell are already created places was widely held (against the view of the Mu'tazilah); al Razi in his Ma'dlim Usul al-Din4 quotes, in support of this, Sirah 3, verse I27, and S. 2, V. 22, where the Garden is already 'prepared' for the godfearing and the Fire for the unbelievers. Siurah 3 is interesting for its criticism in verses I36-7 of those too anxious for initiating warfare against the Meccans and thereby winning Divine reward: 'Or did you suppose you should enter Paradise without God know who of you have struggled and who are patient? You were longing for death before you met it.' 1 C. E. Padwick, op. cit., p. 286. 2 Ibn IshIq, Sirat Rasiul Alldh, ed. Guillaume (London, 1955), p. 678. 3 Carra de Vaux, loc. cit. 4 Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, Ma'dlim U41l al-Dfn, Cairo, 1323, pp. 132-3. .</page><page sequence="8">64 JOHN B. TAYLOR A few verses later (v. 142) there is reference to 'the reward of this world and the fairest reward of the world to come'. Although the greatest incentive to right action and even to possibly sacrificial death in war is the reward of al-Akhirah, there is specific inclusion of a sense of reward already in this world. It is the combination of temporal blessing and eternal reward which gives much didactic force to the Qur'an. And yet the assurances of guidance and the promises of reward are not to lull the nominal Muslim into false security. Sir Hamilton Gibb insists: 'In no passage of the Koran ... (is there) any suggestion that the profession of Islam in itself is a sure passport to Paradise. Apart from martyrs for the Faith, the only promise of Paradise is made to "those who repent and believe and are righteous in act"." Is it thus wishful thinking on the part of that considerable number of Muslims who blithely claim such a passport? Subsequent traditions and theological elaborations have certainly fostered this optimism. It is the winsome rather than the fearsome aspect of God's justice which has allowed great erections to be built on such verses as Suirah 99, verse 8: 'And whoso has done an atom's weight of good shall see it.' The following verse where 'evil' is substituted for 'good' is not always added to complete the quotation! The Qur'an is not explicit that intercession after death will be of any avail-'except as God wills'. Yet the traditions are confident of the intercession of the Prophet and theologians promise that even great sins may be forgiven. The Maqdldt and Ibanah of al-Ash'ari both credit the tradition that God descends to the lowest heaven and asks 'Is there anyone who seeks forgiveness?'; only the supreme sin of unbelief merits eternal Fire.2 Accordingly the only real sanctions against Muslims become the punishments of the grave and purgatory, barzakh; and prayers for the dead may deflect these. It may seem that classical and mediaeval elaborations of the Qur'anic antithesis between Heaven and Hell took away some of its sting and some of its supposed sanctioning effect. In the political philosophising of Ibn Rushd (d. II98) he discusses the view of Plato on the immortality of the soul: 'After that he also produces rhetorical or dialectical argument in which he explains that the soul is immortal. Then after this there is a tale in which he describes the bliss and delight which the happy, just souls attain. But we have made known more than once that these tales are of no consequence. For the virtues that result from them are not true virtues....'3 Quite apart from Ibn Rushd's desire to de-mythologise, even if not so much in his own Muslim tradition, there seems an assumption that the ideal state 1 H.

Rosenthal, Political Thought in Mediaeval Islam (Cambridge, 1958), p. 205</page><page sequence="9">SOME ASPECTS OF ISLAMIC ESCHATOLOGY 65 is to be regulated by a Shari'ah implemented by virtue of its reasonableness; only in the case of unreasoning masses is it imposed as a fearful imperative, or praised as a potential passport. One moves even further from the Qur'anic imperatives with the 'Treat ment of the Fear of Death' advocated by the scientist-cum-philosopher Nasir al-Din Tiisi (120I-1274), a critic of al-Razi's theology: 'But when he attains certainty that death means that Man's essence and core and quintessence depart from the metaphorical, figurative body . . . that the soul then escapes from the impediment of place and time, attaching itself to the Presence of Divinity (which is the dwelling of the pious and the abode of the good), and becoming safe from death and conversion and extinction-(when, we say, he attains this certainty) he assuredly no longer allows himself to suffer any apprehension on account of this state. No longer does he trouble himself for any acceleration or delay (thereof) that may occur, nor does he acquiesce in the gaining of misery or inclination to the darknesses of Purgatory, the end of which will be the descending slopes to Hell."' One might expect such aloofness from Islamic teaching in one who himself came to terms with the pagan Mongol invaders; yet Tfisi did not regard himself as an unbeliever and his work became the best known ethical treatise of mediaeval Islam. His attitude to the after-life, as exemplified by the above passage, endorses the fact that most Muslims have felt a basic security that any justly incurred punishment would be eventually averted, or come to its limit. Saved from the prospect of eternal punishment, there might have been a temptation to lose the didactic implications of the promise and threat of al-Akhirah. But there remain the deterrents of millenia of 'temporary' punishment, and Rfimi reminds his fellow Muslims that the more opportunity they have as Muslims to know God's will, the more will be expected of them. And so the hypocritical Muslim had better think again upon the thrust of the following discourse of Ruimi: 'Hypocrites are consigned to the lowest reach of Hell because faith came to the hypocrite, but his unbelief was strong and so he did nothing; his punishment will be more severe so that he may become aware of God. To the unbeliever faith did not come; his unbelief is weak, and so he will become aware through a less punishment. So as between the breeches with dust upon them and the carpet with dust upon it, in the case of the trousers it is sufficient for one person to shake them a little for them to become clean, whereas it takes four persons shaking the carpet violently for the dust to leave it.'2 Exceptionally, therefore, we see that some Muslims can even envisage a term set to the sojourn of unbelievers in Hell, and even make this shorter than the stint of hypocritical Muslims. Such a view seems motivated less by close Qur'anic exegesis than by a spirituality generously optimistic about the operation of Divine mercy. It conflicts markedly with the Ash'arite exclusivism in the Ibdnah: l Nasir al-Din Tuisi, The Nasirean Ethics, trans. Wickens (London, I964), pp. I4I-2. 2 Jalal al-Din Riumi, Fz-hi mafz-hi, ed. Arberry (London, ig6i), p. 236. C</page><page sequence="10">66 JOHN B. TAYLOR 'Our view concerning the infants of polytheists is that God will kindle for them a fire in the next life, and then will say to them: "Rush ye into it blindly."-as that has come down in the traditions." It conflicts too with the traditional stern interpretation of Sarah 78, verse 23, which consigns unbelievers to Hell 'for ages' (ahqdb). Although modern commentators like Muhammad 'All with an eye to an Islamic liberalism say that the Qur'an rejects the eternity of Hell, the standard verdict of al Baydlwi, a contemporary of Riimi, is that: 'Ahqab means successive epochs; there is nothing in the word to say that (un believers) will come out of (Hell); for whether an "age" (huqb) lasts 8o years or 70,000 years, there is nothing to require the cessation of these ages.'2 The promises and threats of the next life are thus seen to be construed in a wide variety of ways by mediaeval Muslims. The prospect is neither one to introduce universal pessimism nor yet one to allow complacency for the elect. It emerges that it is more important to instruct oneself, one's fellow Muslims, and even the unbeliever, how best to mitigate one's due penance, and that this penance itself is a medium of instruction whereby the unrepentant will eventually be brought to repentance. There is also an appealing side in the inducements of heavenly rewards which demonstrate God's mercy and bounty. This world should not thereby be neglected or resented, but rather one's present faith and works and repentance should be taken more seriously; even the philosopher's doctrine of immortality of the soul was orientated towards tranquillity in this life. This didactic eschatology provides motivation for the Muslim community, making it self-confident, but also, perhaps paradoxically, more tolerant of and permissive towards non-Muslims than was mediaeval Europe. The grand dichotomy between the Garden and the Fire did not necessarily inspire the censorious consigning of one's fellows to Hell nor yet necessarily a morbid fear for oneself; these are caricatures of the one who believes in Heaven and Hell. In the full context of God's justice and mercy, the teaching of eternal reward and punishment epitomises his nature and his purpose. It is teaching which has chastened men, but which has inspired them to be committed to obedience in this world, and to embark upon an anticipation of the Last Things by formulating symbolic descriptions and, occasionally, by projecting themselves into a mystical realisation. APOCALYPTIC ESCHATOLOGY A didactic eschatology paints a backcloth against which men act out their present lives. In an apocalyptic eschatology Heaven and Hell are brought forward and given an almost tangible immediacy through the use of vivid 1 R. J. McCarthy, op. cit., pp. 252-3. 2 al-BaydAwi, Asrar al-Tanzil (Cairo, 1296), vol. II, p. 579.</page><page sequence="11">SOME ASPECTS OF ISLAMIC ESCHATOLOGY 67 myth and symbolism. From the background of men's minds, the Judgement and the After-life move to the forefront; in terms of time, the End becomes imminent, or at least inexorably closer, as 'Signs of the Hour' are foreseen or as cycles come round. In a didactic eschatology one was more concerned with the time scale of the individual's life, death and release from chastise ment; in an apocalyptic eschatology it is the cosmic time scale which is scrutinised. Thus we shall see an example of that prolifically produced genre of literature-books of cosmogony and eschatology, of the Beginning and the Return (al-mabda' wa-al-ma'dd). We shall also take a leap of imagi nation into a messianism which is not only expectant but which claims that the New Age has begun. But in preparation for-these more esoteric instances, we shall look first at the symbolic themes which are employed not only by extremists, but (having indeed originated in respectable 'traditional' circles) also by the self-styled orthodox. The most suggestive sources for apocalyptic description, apart from the Qur'an itself, are in the accounts of the Prophet's Night Journey (Isrd) to Jerusalem (or 'the further place of worship') and in those of his Ascension (Mi'rdj). The imagery of the Garden and Fire are greatly elaborated; special punishments in Purgatory and in Hell, which are allotted to specified categories of sinners, and the successive stages of Heaven through which the Prophet was led provided the basic geography for the mediaeval Mus lims' tiered vortex of Hell and tiered pyramid of Heaven. Much of this imagery is familiar to us from other traditions, whether from Greeks, Zoroastrians, pagan Arabs or Eastern Christians before Islam, or from Dante (if we accept Asin Palacios' thesis of Islamic influence upon the Divine Comedy). It is not our intention to trace the historical pedigree of these myths; this is fully documented and accessible in Asin Palacios' work and in the flood of supporting or critical comment ever since I9I9. Louis Massignon criticised the thesis at that time, but it was not until i957 that he made available his correspondence with the Spanish scholar; in his comments upon this he suggests that there must be a way between 'the literal terrain of borrowings' which engrossed Asin Palacios and the youthful belief in 'spontaneous invention' of which he had himself been accused., The mature Massignon poses the question whether the sort of deeply subjective study of mysticism upon which al-Ghazall insisted may lead us beyond the co incidental archetypes of international folklore to the common language of 'theopathic utterances' which 'make the dominant intentions of our lives converge according to the actual finality of a Divine grace'.2 There are profound implications here for our academic and spiritual dialogue with Muslims. In our present treatment of symbol and myth in Islamic eschato 1 L. Massignon, 'Mystique Musulmane et Mystique Chr6tienne' in Opera Minora, vol. II (Beirut, i963), PP. 474-5- ' Ibid., pp. 476-7</page><page sequence="12">68 JOHN B. TAYLOR logy we are led to appreciate the urge to stretch human vocabulary and imagery to their limit in order that the Prophet, poet, preacher or mystic may better articulate for himself and better communicate to others the mysterious truths which he perceives. Myth need not be an obstruction; it may be the only medium of expression whether for the simple or the sophisticated mind. The connections and coincidences between the Isrd' and the Mi'raj have been fully discussed elsewhere; most traditions assume that they follow upon each other. Gabriel leads the Prophet Muhammad through the seven heavens, introducing him to previous prophets in each, and also granting a prospect out upon Hell; finally there is his translation to before the Throne, the dazzling, ineffable Vision, and the return past the Lotus-tree of the Boundary (Suirah 53, v. 14) and the river Kauthar (S. io8, v. i). The journey is taken as an allegory of the pilgrimage of the human soul which later authors were to take up-notably Ibn al-'Arab! (II64-1240), in the visions which he describes as coming to him by the Ka'bah at Mecca al-Futzihdt al-Makkzyah. Ibn al-'Arabl's guide was an angelic youth who showed him the Qur'anic, the Prophetic, the astrological and the theoso phical land-marks for his journey through the veils. We shall return briefly to Ibn al-'Arabi in our last section, and shall consider the mysterious figure of Khidr, symbolic of God's guidance; and we shall note the Land of True Reality where our homologue enjoys unobscured Vision. Meanwhile we must stay with the eschatological insights associated with experiences or insights of the Prophet Muhammad, apart from his transmission of Qur'anic revelation. In turning to hadith sources we are less concerned with their historical authenticity than with their normative impact (because Muslims do regard them as authoritative). The hadzth materials provide details of the Ascension and its vivid de scriptions of the After-life; but they deal too with still more immediate apocalyptic issues, namely the 'Signs of the Hour' (Ishdrat al-Sd'ah) and the 'Greater Signs' ('Aldmat al-Sa'ah). If one turns to the Mishkdt al-Masdbih one finds that the former range from the loss of faith, through tumults and commotions, to the appearance of 'singing girls and stringed instruments'.' After this moral decline there are the more ominous, partially Qur'anic, signs such as: 'The smoke, the dajjal, the beast, the rising of the sun in its place of setting, the descent ofJesus son of Mary, Gog and Magog, three subsidences, one in the East, one in the West, and one in Arabia, at the end of which a fire will issue in the Yemen and drive mankind to their place of assembly.'2 It is possible that Siurah 43, v. 6i may allude to Jesus as a signal ('alam) of the Hour rather than to the Qur'an as a knowledge ('ilm) for the Hour. 1 trans.

The Qur'an, however, is not the sole authority for Muslims, and it is interesting that one of the gravest objections raised against the Ahmadis by traditionally minded Muslims is the Ahmadi scepticism about the Second Coming of Jesus. At the popular level there is also much expectation for a Mahdi; this is formally a part of the creeds of Shl'is, but it is carefully excluded from Sunni creeds and commentaries. Nevertheless there is a voluminous detail about popular messianic myths and expectations in the Tadhkirah of al-Qurtubi (died I273), and a century or so later, with the Mongols satiated and Islamised, Ibn Khaldun wrote: 'It has been commonly accepted (mashhiir) among the masses (al-kafa) of the people of Islam, as the ages have passed, that there must needs appear in the End of Time a man of the family of Muhammad (min ahl al-bait) who will aid the Faith (din) and make justice triumph; that the Muslims will follow him and that he will reign over the Muslim kingdoms and be called al-MahdI. The appearance of al-Dadjdjal and of the other Signs of the Last Day (ashrdt al-sa'a) which are established in sound traditon (al-.sahiz) will come after him. "Isa will descend after his appearance and will kill al-Dadjdjal or will descend along with him and aid him in that killing; and in worship 'Isa will follow the Mahdi as his imam." '2 Ibn Khaldiin is at pains to criticise the numerous relevant hadith passages; but that does not allow us to overlook the 'commonly accepted' phenomenon. There were many who looked forward to the End since it would bring a Deliverer from the abuses of this world. To this brief indication of the full hadith material bearing upon the Last Things, one must add a special word concerning the controversial hadith qudsi. There was a discredited theory that these sayings, purporting to come directly from God (and therefore not to represent the words of the Prophet), were communicated to him in the course of his Ascension from Jerusalem, al-Quds.3 They are more likely to represent theopathic utterances which the Prophet identified as different in nature from the revealed matter of the Qur'an. Professor Robson cites two of these traditions which are strangely parallel to Biblical passages; both concern the rewards and punishments of the here-after. God has prepared for the pious 'what eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has entered into the heart of man' (cf. Isaiah Lxiv, 4; 1 Cor. 2, 9). Secondly, on the Day of Judgement, God will say, ' "O son of Adam, I was sick and you did not visit me" '.4 This last is close to the spirit and wording of Matthew 25, 31 ff.... S. M. Zwemer (whose centenary and whose remarkable, if stern, concern for Muslims are currently being cele 1 G.

TAYLOR brated) gives a somewhat highly coloured hadith qudsi from al-Manawi's collection: 'God revealed to Jesus that He would move about from place to place, so that none could recognize Him and do Him harm. Then God swore by His greatness and His glory that He would marry Him to two thousand houris and give Him a vision in Paradise for four hundred years." This clearly refers to the eschatological coming of Jesus; the symbolism may be offensive to Zwemer, and indeed to most Christians, but there need be no lack of reverence implied if one understands these symbolic rewards as a Muslim would. We have already seen that a philosophically-minded Muslim like Ibn Rushd could disparage myth. A particularly vicious attack is launched by Tiisi on 'those who conceive the world-to-come as offering the same sort of pleasures and appetites as this world': 'From Eden's Paradise and proximity to the Divine Presence, they (only) ask excessive capacity to acquire pleasurable foods, or to have power over voluptuous women, or to get hold of much-coveted drinks. Yet in spite of all this, ... if they hear that the Angels . . . are sanctified and absolved from such impurities ... they still assert the eminence in rank of these beings; indeed, they recognize that the Maker . . . is aloof and elevated above this degree, and that pleasure and enjoyment in such things is not proper to Him. In this respect, such people are the companions of the dog and the pig, not to say of the beetles and worms, while in intelligence and distinction they are partners of the angels.'2 But this is a minority voice, and it would incense many Muslims to hear such scorn poured upon their literal interpretation of Qur'anic imagery. Not that T-asi's rationalism goes so far as to question the angelology which is as integral to the Aristotelian-Neo-Platonic world-view as to the Muslim. However, he is at pains to forbid us to 'append human virtues to the angels'.3 D. B. Macdonald says that they are 'philosophical and not Muslim prin ciples' which underly the view 'that they were spirits stripped of materiality ... free of even the beginnings of defects, like lust and anger, and from the obscurities of form and matter . . .'.4 There were scholastic theologians as well as philosophers who were embarrassed by anthropomorphic implications in eschatological terminology. We have already seen how their definition of Beatific Vision was safe guarding against this. Some time between I206 and I223 the Hanball jurist-theologian Ibn Qudamah launched his scathing attack upon this trend in speculative theology. He insisted upon exclusive reliance upon the Qur'an and Sunnah, both of which were to be taken at their face value with no indulgence in the 'meddlesomeness, foolishness, immoderation', etc.,5 of ta'wil, allegorical interpretation. Ibn Qudamah refers to the well-known 1 S. M. Zwemer, op. cit., p. 274. 2 Nasir al-Di Tusi, op. cit., p. 53. 3 Ibid., p. 208. 4 D. B.

Makdisi (London, 1962), p. 22.</page><page sequence="15">SOME ASPECTS OF ISLAMIC ESCHATOLOGY 71 tradition that 'God will call to the people on the Day of Resurrection with a voice which will be heard by him who is far as by him who is near' and to the tradition that Moses heard the voice of God and, 'upon hearing thereafter the words of humans, loathed them, so great was the impression remaining in his ears at hearing the words of God'. Accordingly, Ibn Qudamah pours scorn on the ta'wil of the mutakallim (scholastic theologian) Ibn 'Aqll: 'His statement that "the Divine voice is a burst or crack in the air", is sheer raving, and an empty assertion, the soundness of which is not attested by any prophetic tradition.'" For, the raising of the dead (al-ba'th), the Book of recorded deeds, the Balance to weigh those deeds, all are regarded as 'realities' in orthodoxy. One effect of this is to prevent or inhibit the allegorical interpretation on which a mystical eschatology depends at many points; the descriptions of the Last Things are to be of cosmic events which set a seal upon history, and they are not just to be taken as symbolic of the individual soul's spiritual progress. Orthodox literalism is still more opposed to heterodox manipulation of these 'realities' to support messianic expectations or actual messianic claims. The most notorious example of this, and the most execrated by the orthodox, was the Nizari Isma'ili proclamation of the Resurrection (Qjydmah) at Alamat, on I7th Ramadlan 559 (I I64) by IHasan II. Forty years before, Hasan-i Sabbah, the legendary Old Man of the Mountain, had inaugurated the Last Things. M. G. S. Hodgson describes this succession of the Qf'im (who summons forth the dead) to the Iujjah (the attestor): 'The .Hujja had no doubt been Hassan-i Sabbah. He had blown the first of the two blasts of the trumpet that proclaimed the resurrection; playing the role of Jesus, whose return was to herald the end.... Now was surely time, therefore, for a new wonder that should not be an anti-climax. The Resurrection, the Qiyama, was called for; the second blast of that fateful trumpet. It did come ... (an appropriate interval of time, in that Jesus' reign was commonly expected to last forty years before the last day); ijasan II fulfilling the announcements ascribed to Hasan-i Sabbiih that the time was at hand.' 'But they were not fulfilled in the physical guise expected by the orthodox Sunnis-like the trumpet blasts themselves the resurrection was spiritual. .. Paradise being the life of the spirit, moreover, it was even claimed that Paradise itself could be attained already before death; at least in a potential sense, which our death will merely actualise.'2 In our last section we shall return to this realisation or liv"ing appropriation of eschatological symbols. Long before the Mongols finally destroyed Alamfit, the idea of men living as resurrected beings had lost its popular attraction and had become a dead letter with the restoration of the Shari'ah after 47 years' abeyance. A further period of the imdm's being in hiding was 1 Ibn Qudamah, Tahrim an-nazarfi kutub ahl al-kalam, ed. Makdisi, (London, I962), p. 32. 2 M. G. S.

TAYLOR eventually accepted and the Niziri survivors made a truce with the rest of the world, and waited for another cycle to unfold. A final example of eschatological symbolism from among the richly diverse elements which make up the unity of Islam is from another esoteric Isma'ili group, the Yamani tradition. In the Treatise on Cosmogony and Eschatology of Sayyid-na al-Husayn ibn 'All (d. I268) we are led through a 'celestial drama', where the Angel of humanity, the spiritual Adam, falls from his proper rank, and strives for his restoration. This symbolic history reflects the progress of the soul drawn on by the 'Divine magnetism' (al magnatis al-ildha) which is a Column of Light ('amud min nir).' Finally the soul is conducted to the Threshold (Bdb) of the Resurrecter (al-Qa'im) around whom the 'forms of light' build a Temple of Light (Haykal nuirdni) in 'human form', albeit dazzlingly invisible to human eyes.2 Henry Corbin, who has made this esoteric spirituality accessible to us, draws attention to the salvific function of the Column of Light in Manichaean thought and sees the same motif in Zoroastrian eschatology; he writes of the Form of light which will be finally fully seen by the soul as it leaves the world: 'This form is indeed "the Image of light in the resemblance of the soul", the Angel wearing "the diadem and the crown", the celestial alter ego who is guide and saviour, to which Zoroastrianism and Manichaeanism gave the same name, Da6na.'3 The identification of the Temple of Light with the Imamdh gives a clue to the involvement of this eschatology with Isma'ill imamology; and it shows the messianic element in that imamology. It seems a far cry from traditional Islamic symbolism, but essentially it may appear as another way of harnessing earthly metaphor to lay hold of Ultimate Truth, with all its implications for our present lives. Isma'ili experience may perhaps best be integrated into the mainstream of Islamic thought by understanding it in the wider context of the Islamic mystical tradition-to which we now turn. MYSTICAL ESCHATOLOGY If a didactic eschatology hung a back-cloth, and if an apocalyptic escha tology set the stage of life with all the properties ready for the Last Day, then a mystical eschatology brings us into the drama. So far there have been only the instances of the Prophet's Night Journey and Ascension and the Isma'ills' proclamation of Qiydmah which might suggest a full appre hension, realisation or appropriation of the Next World. It was the afu-s, drawing their inspiration partly from historical aspects of the Prophet's teaching but also claiming the contemporary illumination of theophany (tajalli), who experienced what others anticipated. A favourite hadith with the stf7s is given as follows in the Kitdb al- Ta'arruf of al-Kalabadhi: 1 (Sayyid-ni) al-Ijusayn ibn 'Ali, Risdlat al-Mabda' wa-al-Ma'dd, ed. Corbin (Teheran/Paris, 196i), text p. II7, tr. p. 173. 2 Ibid., text p. ii8, tr. p. 174. " Ibid., p. 143.</page><page sequence="17">SOME ASPECTS OF ISLAMIC ESCHATOLOGY 73 'When the Prophet asked, "what is the reality of your faith?" Harithah replied, "I have inclined my soul away from this world, have fasted by day and kept vigil by night, and it is as if I behold the Throne of my Lord coming forth (bariz) and it is as if I behold the people of Paradise visiting each other, and the people of Hell at enmity with each other" (or "howling like dogs"-if one prefers the reading of this tradition in al-Kulayni, al-Mustamli and al-HujwIri).'" The typifying example of this very hazy historical figure, Harithah, points to a spirituality remote from the transcendental ideas of theologians who queried the vision or audibility of God even on the Last Day. The famous eighth century A.D. woman mystic, Rabi'ah al-'Adawiyah, was addressed as 'O woman of the Next World'; she was described as running with fire to set Heaven ablaze or with water to quench the flames of Hell that these two 'veils' might disappear and God's servants might behold Him without any object of hope or motive of fear; but she feared men would not in fact adore or obey without these.2 For herself she prayed: 'O God! if I worship Thee in fear of Hell, burn me in Hell; and if I worship Thee in hope of Paradise, exclude me from Paradise; but if I worship Thee for Thine own sake, withhold not Thine Everlasting Beauty!'3 Once when visited in her sickness, she said: 'By God, I know of no cause for my illness, except that Paradise was displayed to me, and I yearned after it in my heart; and I think that my Lord was jealous for me and so reproached me; and only He can make me happy.'4 Before turning to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries A.D., from which most of our examples for this paper have been drawn, we shall note one further case from the early, formative period of tasawwuf, namely al-Junayd (d. 9Io). For the early sufis were pioneers of (and occasionally martyrs for) mystical doctrines which later spread across the Muslim world with the greatest missionary impact and the most popular appeal; the most effective propagators were Ibn al-'Arabi (d. I240) and Jalal al-Din Ruiri (d. I273); both were innovators, but both built on earlier sfls' terminology and world-view. Al-Junayd, like Rabi'ah, knew that contemplation of the Divine Beauty, that sense of union with the One God, which obliterated any fear of death or any sense of waiting for death and Judgement; one of his aphorisms is, 'Those who know God do not die, they are only removed from one abode to another'. Al-Sha'rani commented upon this as follows: 'Junaid's meaning was that those who know God are, while still living, as though they had already died (i.e. through the death to self and to the world in al-fand') so that to say "those who know God" is equivalent to saying "the dead" and how should the action of "dying" be attributed to death itself?'5 1 al-KalbThdhi, Kitdb al-Ta'arruf (Cairo, 1380), p. 23. 2 G.-C.

Padwick, op. cit., p. 275.</page><page sequence="18">74 JOHN B. TAYLOR And yet al-Sha'rani might better have explained this saying by reference to the concept of baqd', continuance, which is the important concomitant to the concept of fand', annihilation. In order to appreciate Rabi'ah's disinterested love and al-Junayd's uninhibited union we must imagine them not as desiring a future reward but as persisting in the condition of being 'clad in the Peace of God (al-saklnah)', in the words of al-Hallaj's definition quoted by al-KaldbddhL.1 From the Prophetic note of didactic warning and from the symbolic imagery of apocalyptic description, we have moved to something close to what C. H. Dodd might term 'The absolute entrance of. . . the eschaton into human experience' ;2 but if one experiments with the applicability of the term 'realised eschatology' to the spirituality of the s'zffs, one must register that this 'entrance of the eschaton' is not primarily because of a Divine intervention and initiative in history (analogous to Christ's bringing in of the Kingdom); the sufz's 'realisation' or 'entrance' is the result of a personal experience, of a theophany which he claims for himself ... albeit with the intention of humble emulation of the Prophet Muhammad. We may jealously guard 'realised eschatology' as the designation of New Testament spirituality; but even that must make us all the more prepared to expose the concept, and the experience, to the taxing comparisons of inter-religious dialogue. The sufis' continuance in intimate communion with God is not simply a doctrine of the immortality of the soul such as the philosophers preached, nor is there any attempt to escape the harsh distinctions between Heaven and Hell. Indeed, the bliss or darkness are already perceptible in this life, as Ibn al-'Arabi expresses it: 'When He set Paradise and Hell in the world of the hereafter, the one for bliss and the other for torment, the former as a treasure house of good and the latter as a treasure house of evil, He likewise appointed that virtue which is at the core of the heart to be a Paradise for His believing servant, for it is the place where Allah is seen, where He reveals Himself, where confidential intercourse with Him takes place, where degrees of spirituality are attained, and where the lights burst forth. He also set the soul to be as Man's Hell, for that is where evil bursts forth, where Satan whispers and waits, the place where darkness is.'3 This passage appears as an even more remarkable appropriation of the eschatological dimension when we look further into the thought of Ibn al-'Arabi. The author of the 'Meccan Revelations' does not set forth his graphic descriptions of the dazzling Assembly of the chosen and their 'pure and unalloyed' Beatific vision4 as a flight of symbolic fancy. He describes a 1 al-Kalmabdhi, op. cit., p. I 23. 2 C. H. Dodd, 7he Apostolic Preaching, with an appendix on Eschatologv and History (London, I936), p. 232. 3 A. J.

Not that Ibn al-'Arabi is imposing on others his own theophany, for Khidr will lead them to their own homologue. In the Futahdt he endorses the description given by another mystic: 'This (Heavenly) Country is, for the mystics, the place where theophanies and theophanic visions are achieved. One of them recounts to us an instance which I myself recognise from personal vision: "In that Country", he recalls, "it hap pened that one day I penetrated into an assembly called 'The Assembly of Mercy' (Majlis al-Rahmah). I had never seen a more wonderful assembly than that one. When I found myself there, behold, a theophanic vision happened to me; far from snatching me away from myself, it stabilised me in my own company. That is one of the characteristic particularities of that Country. When theophanic visions happen to mystics in our material world, while they are attentive to their carnal bodies, they lift the ecstatics from themselves and deny them their vision.... On the other hand, when the visionary mystic has penetrated to this Country of which I speak and when a theophanic vision happens to him, it does not deny him contemplative perception of it, it does not snatch him from his act of existence; it causes the vision and the converse to co-exist for him." '2 The mystic refuses to divulge the secrets and the experiences which he was given in that land of spiritual resurrection, but Ibn al-'Arabi himself launches upon a description: 'In that Country there are gardens, Paradises, animals, minerals.... Everything, absolutely everything, which exists in that Country is living and speaking, with a life analogous to that of every living being.... Endowed with life and speech the beings correspond to those down here, with this difference that in that Heavenly Country things are permanent, imperishable and unchangeable.... It is a fact that this Country does not receive any of our physical bodies of human perishable clay.... Thus it is with their Spirit, and not with their material body, that the mystics penetrate it.'3 The defiance of human time scale and the penetration into an eternal dimension which Ibn al-'Arabi exemplifies cannot simply be dismissed as 'other-worldliness'; he insists on familiar human categories in the Land of Truth, not merely as symbols but as homologues with reality and perma nence. One is acutely aware of the limitations of prose to expound these ex periences of the mystics. The poet Riami should have the last word in de scribing the permanent reward of the p7fp's life of constant 'recollection' (dhikr) of God; even now he is brought into the 'Divine Presence' and no barrier of flesh or time remains: 'Tis just as the naked man jumped into the water, that in the water he might escape the sting of the hornets ... 1 H.
