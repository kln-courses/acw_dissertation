<plain_text><page sequence="1">A NEW FERTILITY FIGURINE and New Animal Motifs from the CHALCOLITHIC IN THE SOUTHERN LEVANT : Finds from Cave K-l at Quleh, Israel I. Milevski Abstract : Excavations at the Chalcolithic cemetery of Quleh in the Coastal Plain of Israel concentrated on eight burial caves. Cave K- 1 yielded a unique male fertility figurine found inside one of the several ossuaries placed inside the cave. Made of local clay and found broken in three parts, the almost complete ceramic figurine represents a nude male with erect penis (broken). From an iconographie point of view, its head and face, resemble some of the anthropomorphic motifs from PeqVin Cave in Upper Galilee and Shiqmim in the Northern Negev. This paper describes the object in detail and proposes an interpretation of its find spot within the framework of cultic beliefs and practices of the Chalcolithic of the Southern Levant. Résumé : Les fouilles du cimetière chalcolithique de Quleh (plaine cotière d'Israël) ont porté sur huit grottes à ossuaires. Dans l'un des ossuaires de la grotte K-l fut retrouvée une figurine masculine de fertilité jusqu 'ici unique. La figurine, quasi intacte, en terre cuite, faite d'argile locale, était brisée en trois morceaux. Elle représente un homme nu, avec le pénis (cassé) en érection. La tête et la face, d'un point de vue iconographique, sont à rapprocher des motifs anthropomorphes présents sur les ossuaires de Peqi 'in en Haute Galilée et de Shiqmin dans le nord du Neguev. Ici, nous décrivons avec précision l 'objet et proposons, dans le cadre des croyances et pratiques cultuelles du Chalcolithique du sud du Levant, une interprétation qui tient compte de son lieu de trouvaille. Key-Words : Chalcolithic, Iconography, Fertility figurine, Burial beliefs and practices. Mots Clefs : Chalcolithique, Iconographie, Figurine de fertilité, Croyances et pratiques funéraires. INTRODUCTION Quleh, ca. 15 km east of Tel Aviv (fig. 1) is best known for its medieval archaeological remains1. Recent development activity on the site led to the discovery of an extensive ceme- tery dating to the Chalcolithic period (fig. 2). To date, eight 1. An Arab village existed near the site until 1948 (KOCHAVI and BEIT- ARIEH, 1994 : Site 285). For Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine-Early Islamic remains see AVISSAR and SHABO, 1998 ; MILEVSKI and SHABO, 1998. Paléorient, vol. 28/2, p. 133-142 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2002 caves have been excavated in a series of salvage excavations by the author on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (hereafter IAA) in and around Quleh : Areas E and I (March- April 1997), Area J (November 2000), and Area К (February- March 2001). An other cave, excavated 1 km north of Quleh, nearby Mazor West, has been used as a tomb and as a dwell- ing as well. Cave K-l (figs 3 and 4) measured 13.00 x 7.00 m and was preserved to a height of ca 4.00 m. An opening (ca 1 m in diameter) existed in the center of the ceiling of the cave, but it is unclear whether or not it was the original entry.

Fig. 2 : Quleh, excavated areas. was filled with a light brown alluvium mixed with large stones. Beneath the alluvium layer was a dark brown-orange soil containing large and medium-sized stones, a large quan- tity of pottery sherds, ossuaries, ossuary fragments, and human bones. One of these ossuaries yielded three parts of the broken figurine. Excavations within the cave allowed us to identify at least four use-phases, labeled I to IV from top to bottom. The ear- liest three phases (IV-II) were dated to the Chalcolithic period, while Phase I was dated to the Intermediate Bronze Age (&lt; ca . 2 200-2 ООО ВС). The discussion below concentrates on the Chalcolithic horizon. Phases IV-II included ceramic ossuaries and jars contain- ing secondary inhumations (fig. 4). So-called V-shaped, cari- nated bowls, pedestaled vessels and cornets were also found, mainly in Phase IV. The ossuary (Locus 1 104. 1) in which the figurine has been found was in a layer associated with Phase III (figs 5, 6 and 7).

The lower part of the body and legs of the figurine appear in the upper end of the ossuary. THE FIGURINE The figurine is ca. 20 cm high (figs 8 and 9). The torso was made by rolling a lump of clay, and before the material dried the head and feet were subsequently modelled. The arms were applied later (figs 8a, 9a). The head is round and bald ; its round ears and long mouth were made by a relatively deeply incised line. The circular eyes were also fashioned by incisions ; the eyebrows are indicated by indentation of the ocular orbits. The nose is relatively pronounced and its tip may have been damaged. The sexual organs are pronounced (figs 8b and 9b) and were probably also applied to the body. Unfortunately the erect penis is broken and part of it is missing, but the testicles are well preserved. The buttocks are schematically suggested by two curved incised lines formed by pinching (figs 8c and 9c). The legs, one-sixth of the height of the entire figurine, are proportionally short and the feet broad. The proportions of the body show a height/width relationship of 5: 1 . The fabric color is brownish-red. The surface of the figu- rine was painted with a reddish-brown colour. Preserved traces suggest that the arms were probably painted with a pat- tern of diagonal parallel lines.

MILEVSKI that the ceramic components of the figurine are found in an area of Eocenian origin, ca. 20 km south of the site, in the vicinity of Gezer2. As noted above, the figurine was found inside one of the Phase III ossuaries in the center of the cave (fig. 3). The ossuaries of this phase were found sitting above stone slabs, placed on top of the fill of Phase IV. The three parts of the fig- urine were found in different places within the ossuary. The lower part of the body was found in the northeast corner (sit- ting on the base), while the head and the upper part of the body with the left arm were found in the southwest half. The right arm was missing. Several figurines, all somewhat similar are known from the Chalcolithic culture ; apparently all of them derive from the Beer Sheva facies. In spite of a similar ratio between height and width to the well known Chalcolithic figurines of Bir Safadi3, the Quleh figurine is significantly different from them both in style and material. The Bir Safadi figurines, made of ivory or bone, are similar in style to contemporary figurines found from the same period in Egypt, and must be considered related to the Badarian culture in that country4. They are more stylized, showing the human body in more detail. Notably, the proportion of the legs to the body is totally different in comparison with our figurine ; the legs in those figurines comprised almost half of the height of the figurine. While lacking close parallels, the Quleh figurine does in some respects resemble some other Chalcolithic human representations ; for instance, several heads attached to ossuaries found in the Peqfin5 burial cave, and a basalt head of a statuette from Shiqmim6. Thus, in general it may be noted that the Quleh figurine is an unusual, but not a totally unique example of Chalcolithic artistic representation. We suggest two possibilities regarding a reconstruction of the missing right arm. Either originally it was placed along- side the body, like its extant left arm and the Badarian figu- rines, or it may have grasped the penis, like the statues of the god Min from predynastic Coptos in Egypt7. 2.

LEVY and ALON, 1985. 7. KEMP, 2000. HORNED ANIMALS In addition to the figurine, we would like to insist on a group of five decorated ossuaries. They bear the heads of horned animals in groups of two (fig. 10a), three (figs 10b and c) and perhaps as many as four individuals (fig. lOd). The horned heads, identified as wild goats or ibexes, are applied to the frontons of the ossuaries8. The eyes were indicated by deep round incisions, and a long mouth was also made by a profound incised line, similar to the mouth of the human fig- urine. The horns were made by attaching a couple of thin indented coils to the top of the fronton. The animal horned-head motif discussed by Miroschedji9, appears widely in the Chalcolithic imagery, both in full repre- sentation and in a pars pro toto version, i.e., just the horns. Full representation is seen among the metal items from Nahal Mishmar10 and on pithoi and basalt statues from the Golan11. Horns appear on ossuaries from Azor, Ben Shemen and Bnei Brak12. In several instances the horns are applied to the upper part of the fronton, depicting a human face. This is the sole known example in which the motif appears fully represented on the frontons of a group of ossuaries. We tentatively suggest that this occurrence points to a distinctive characteristic of the group, probably pointing to kinship between the individuals buried in these ossuaries. Beck13 pointed out that human faces and horns as they appear in the above-mentioned ossuaries of Azor, Ben Shemen, and Bnei Brak, and the basalt pillar statues of the Golan are associated with cultic activities in relation to gods of fields and flocks. In addition, she suggested that Chalcol- ithic human figurines from the Negev are a separate phenom- enon, indicating regional differences within the Chalcolithic period. We prefer a different perspective that integrates the horned motifs with the human figurines, considering them, as in the case of the Gilat14 and Quleh figurines, as fertility rep- resentations. The relationship between sexual activity and milk extraction was depicted in Mesopotamia in a series of 8. The frontons were found scattered throughout the cave. Unfortunately the ossuaries related to these frontons are still not restored and we cannot pre- cise the original find spot for the frontons. 9. Miroschedji. 1993. 10. bar-Adon, 1980. 11.

Furthermore, milk production cults and fertility cults are known from several cultures in the Near East and the Old World. Weeramunda, an anthropologist studying the place of milk in religious beliefs in Sri Lanka, has shown that milk symbol- izes the bond between mother and child and it is strongly related to mother goddesses worship and fertility16. Semen is the counterpart in these beliefs ; while the milk of the mother is the blood transformed for the child nurturance, semen is the father's blood transformed during sexual intercourse. We sug- gest here that this is also the case for Chalcolithic iconography which combines elements and motifs related to fertility female and male figurines, and milk or milk related products as already suggested by Sacher Fox17. This includes violin- shaped figurines, a number of additional figurines including the nude woman with churn from Gilat, and the male horned animals (probably rams) carrying cornets and churns on the back from Gilat18 and Ein Gedi repectively19. All these figu- rines appear to be related to the milk industry. Notably, Alon and Levy20 have suggested that the nude women from Gilat is sitting on a birthing-stool21, an additional reason to suggest a relationship to a divinity of fertility22. The horned animals and motifs are also related to sexuality and fertility. Miroschedji23 has suggested that horned animals or personages (as depicted in the Early Bronze sealings) rep- resent a female divinity related to a fertility cult associated with underground waters, while Keel and Uehlinger24 pointed out that horned animals (more precisely wild goats) are related to strength and virility in the ancient tradition of the southern Levant. We are in agreement with the latter sugges- tion, because the horned animals are obviously males, whether they are to be identified as ibexes or another species of wild goat. 15.

This motif continued into the Early Bronze, as pointed out by BECK (1993) who has interpreted the so-called squared bed models as birthing-stools of the Early Bronze II-III. 22. A discussion of the non-divine interpretation of the Gilat Woman pro- posed by JOFFE, DESSEL and HALLOTE, 2001, and the domestic nature of Gilat as a locale inhabited by a shaman, as suggested by GlLEAD, 2002, is beyond the scope of this paper. 23. МИЮЗСНЕБЛ, 1993. 24. Keel und Uehlinger, 1992. I. MILEVSKI Thus, we regard the Sitz im Leben of the figurines as rep- resentations of fertility gods. The horned animals and motifs, and the human/animal figurines, related to the milk industry, represent a branch of the economic mode of subsistence of Chalcolithic society. Within this framework the Quleh figu- rine is understood as portraying the best known local male representation of fertility-associated beliefs of the Chalcol- ithic population. INTERPRETATION OF THE FIND SPOT Finally we suggest a possible interpretation of the find spot of the Quleh figurine. At a first glance, it seems as if the figurine was placed in the ossuary as a protective device for the dead. Fertility gods have also associated connotations of security, warmth and protection. However, according to the position in which the different parts of the figurine were found within the ossuary, it is plausible that it was broken before it was interred. An examination of the fractures shows that it is unlikely that the figurine was purposely broken as in the case of figurines of other cultures25. Moreover, the position of the figurine parts within the ossuary seems related to the pattern of human bones buried in the ossuaries (fig. 3). In general the skull is found in one extreme of the ossuary while the body parts are positioned at the opposite end. Long bones (extremities) are to be found along the sides of the box as is exemplified in ossuary Locus 1 1 12.1 which appears in the lower right corner of the figure. Thus, we suggest that as the figurine was broken it must have been considered as if it too had died. Accordingly we suggest here that the Quleh figurine was deliberately interred in the ossuary along with human remains. Such an interpretation adds new aspects of the idea that burial and cultic beliefs and practices in the Chalcolithic period were associated to the notion that birth, death and rebirth were cyclical related26.
