<plain_text><page sequence="1">DIVINE FOLLY IN OLD KIEVAN LITERATURE: THE TALE OF ISAAC THE CAVE DWELLER Natalie Challis and Horace W. Dewey, University of Michigan Some celebrated heroes of Old Russian Literature were holy fools. Only re- cently, however, have the literary aspects of divine folly (jurodstvo) begun to receive the attention they deserve.' Russia's earliest surviving story about a holy fool deals with Isaac the Cave-Dweller (Isaakij Pe'ernik), a monk in the Kiev Cave Monastery in the early decades after the monastery's founding, when its abbots included such luminaries as Anthony and Theodosius.2 Isaac's story is brief, and divine folly occupies only a part of it, yet one must view the tale as a significant work. We shall examine the tale on two levels: first, as a sample of Kievan storytelling art; and second, as an attempt to convey a message. Its narrative features must have gained it ap- preciative readers and listeners, but what was the tale really about? It was clearly "teleological," yet what point did the author most want to make? Isaac the layman was a wealthy merchant. Wishing to become a monk, he gave up his wordly riches and came to Anthony (founder of the' Kiev Cave Monastery), who tonsured him. Isaac the monk displayed an inor- dinate asceticism from the outset: he donned a hair shirt over which he pulled the raw skin of a newly-slaughtered goat, then sealed himself in a cramped cave cell with only a tiny "window" through which food could be passed to him. There he lived for seven years, fasting, tearfully praying, and never lying down. He slept little, and when he did, he stayed in an upright position. One night a brilliant light suddenly illuminated the cell. Two youths with radiant faces came to Isaac, presenting themselves as angels. Others ap- peared, among them one "more radiant than the rest." The two youths an- nounced that this was Christ Himself, and bade Isaac fall down and worship him. Isaac complied, whereupon his visitors abruptly revealed themselves as demons. "Thou art ours, Isaac!" they exulted. Some of the demons began playing musical pipes, stringed gusli and tambourines, compelling Isaac to "dance" (igrati - here, "rotate" or "twist around"?)3 until he collapsed, whereupon the demons left, mocking and cursing him. The next morning Anthony came and spoke to Isaac through the little window, but received no answer. Anthony finally summoned some monks who unsealed the entrance and carried Isaac out, "thinking him dead." In- SEEJ, Vol. 22, No. 3 (1978) 255</page><page sequence="2">256 Slavic and East European Journal deed he was barely alive. A two-year convalescence period followed, with Isaac in a coma much of the time, while abbot Theodosius personally cared for him. Isaac finally began to speak again in the third year; ultimately he made a full recovery. Theodosius died shortly thereafter, and only then did Isaac begin to play the holy fool. His initial jurodstvo was mild enough, amounting to little more than humility and asceticism. He would voluntarily perform the most menial tasks (such as helping the cooks in the kitchen) and would stand motionless during church services, with footwear so tattered that "his feet often froze to the stone" in winter. Once a cook teasingly order him to catch a raven. Isaac promptly caught the black bird and brought it to the cook and his fellows, who reacted with awe. News of Isaac's miraculous deed reached his brother monks, who "began to honor him." In true jurodstvo style, Isaac spurned "human glory," behaving outrageously. Unfortunately few examples of his scandalous conduct are given, but we are told of his practice of gathering the youthful sons of laymen and "clothing them in monks' garb." The new abbot (Nikon) beat him for his pains, as did the children's parents, but Isaac willingly "endured all that." After Isaac performed another miracle - walking barefoot on a stove to keep down the flames (which had threatened to blaze out of control) and suffering no harm from the fire - his supernatural powers gained even wider recognition. But his greatest triumphs came in the struggle against demons, who kept trying to frighten or ensnare him again. Vanquished, they finally left him in peace, and Isaac ceased playing the holy fool and lived out his remaining years in the manner of a conventional monk. After death he was "buried with honor among the holy fathers of the cave." Isaac's story is written in such a way as to appeal to a wide audience: its intended readers and listeners included private individuals at home, parishioners at church and monks in their monasterial dining hall.4 The author expressed his ideas simply and clearly throughout most of the narrative. The story moves along, like many other tales in the Patericon, with much action and few digressions. It contains some good dialogue, par- ticulary in those passages where Isaac confronts his demonic tormentors. The author shuns abstraction, naming specific people in specific walks of life, and identifying geographical localities. His details, often graphic, sometimes border on the naturalistic, as when he described the worms (maggots?) teeming under Isaac's ribs in the sweat and urine, while Isaac lies motionless in Theodosius' cell. Only after Isaac's death does the work lapse into a highly rhetorical style, eulogizing all the lavra monks: who shine radiantly, like stars, after death and who pray to God for the brethren here and for all who work in the house of God's mother and for the world's children, and for those who</page><page sequence="3">Divine Folly in Old Kievan Literature 257 come and give of their belongings to the monastery, where to this day those who live righteously dwell all together, in song and prayer and obedience, for the glory of God and His immaculate Mother, and protected by the prayers of the holy fathers Anthony and Theodosius Isaac is not mentioned here, and these lines contrast so strikingly with the preceding narrative that one might suspect they were added by a later copyist. We should remind ourselves, however, that disparate styles easily coexisted within a single work of Old Russian Literature. In this eulogistic segment prolixity was appropriate. We shall also see that it serves as the work's principal message. Isaac's conflicts with demonic adversaries contribute to the narrative interest and give the tale an exotic touch. The monk Isaac himself lived and died in Kiev, yet the demonological episodes in his story must have had a bizarre ring for East Slavs, despite the role played by demons in Byzantine popular hagiography (including literature on holy fools) which Kievans could read in Slavonic translation (see Challis and Dewey). If readers and listeners readily visualized the human actors (Kievan abbots, princes, monks, and service personnel) and the lavra setting in Isaac's story, the hero's devilish adversaries were less familiar characters in Isaac's time. The pagan East Slavs contended with evil spirits and supernatural foes, but nothing quite like the demons of the Patericon (Ivanov and Toporov, 75- 76). Malevolent "native" spirits were to be avoided where possible and pacified when necessary; it was useless to combat such hostile deities and unthinkable to shame them deliberately. In any event, none possessed the verbal skills, musical talents, or nimble mastery of disguise which Isaac's tormentors display: Slavic demons did not perform on pipes, tambourines, or stringed instruments; nor did they parade, now as anthropomorphic angels, now as bears or reptiles. Isaac's demons lied, bluffed and bullied - and added elements of narrative conflict and suspense. Best of all, an alert hero could defeat Isaac's demons in a duel of wits or repel them by crossing himself; Isaac, as a holy fool, repeatedly fended them off. When they returned long after their initial triumph, saying "Thou art ours, Isaac, for thou didst bow down to our chief!" Isaac replied that their chief was the Antichrist; he then crossed himself and the demons vanished. When they came back at night in his dreams, disguised as a human mob wielding hoes and picks, and shouting "we shall dig up this cave and bury this fellow alive!" he refused to be frightened and replied that "if ye were human beings, ye would walk about by daylight; but ye are darkness and walk about in darkness." He again crossed himself and they left. When they appeared yet again as bears, lions and reptiles, he mocked them. Recalling how he had been taken in by them when they first came to him disguised as Christ and His angels, he now observed that they looked like beasts and rep- tiles, "just as ye yourselves are."</page><page sequence="4">258 Slavic and East European Journal What models, if any, did the author use when portraying Isaac's demonic adversaries? Here one must consider general cultural phenomena (which influenced the author indirectly, at least) as well as specific literary sources (whose influence was quite direct). Isaac's demons bear a certain resemblance to skomoroxi, for example. These secular entertainers, who often played musical instruments like those used by Isaac's adversaries, made up part of the cultural background which influenced our author. Whether Kiev's skomoroxi were native Slavs or came from Byzantium makes little difference; the Russian church's hostility to the skomoroxi was clearly a Byzantine legacy.6 The author of Isaac's story ob- viously shared the Byzantine attitude that secular musical instruments were profane, devilish contraptions - particularly when played in a monastery or in the presence of a hermit monk! Isaac's demons appear to have been influenced by Judaeo-Byzantine models in other ways as well. The Talmud's Aggadah (or "folklore section") teems with demons who bear little resemblance to the evil spirits of Slavic paganism but who behave quite similarly to Isaac's tormentors. They are adept at disguising themselves, often in human form; they engage the hero in duels of wit - which a clever and righteous hero usually wins; they can also be rendered harmless by the appropriate religious countermeasure (if a Christian hero has but to cross himself, the Jewish hero has but to pronounce God's "Ineffable Name").' A tantalizing question here, of course, is where our author came across his Jewish models. Did he owe most of his demonological expertise to "second-hand" Byzantine sources, which in turn looked back to Hebrew folklore? Or had the author learned something from conversations with fellow Kievans (Jewish or Gentile) who were familiar with Hebrew lore (in the original or in translation)?8 In any event, Jewish demons and Byzantine-Slavic skomoroxi served only indirectly as models for Isaac's adversaries. For all their exotic origins, they were becoming part of the Kievan cultural setting. As such they made Isaac's enemies - and demons appearing elsewhere in the Kiev Cave Patericon - believable and literarily "acceptable." Yet we believe that the teller of Isaac's story also drew on a more direct, specific source. Did not the Old Testament's Book of Daniel serve as our author's im- mediate source of inspiraton? It can hardly be a coincidence that Isaac's story opens with the aphorism, "Just as gold is tested in the fire, so are men tried in the furnace of humility." In the Book of Daniel we read, over and again, that anyone refusing to fall down and worship the golden image (which the Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar had erected) would be "cast into a burning fiery furnace" (Daniel 3:6, 11, 15, 20-23). Equally significant are the biblical source's repeated references to musical instruments - "the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer and all kinds of music" -</page><page sequence="5">Divine Folly in Old Kievan Literature 259 sounds which served as a signal to fall down and worship the golden image (Daniel, 3:5, 7, 10, 15). Thus the Book of Daniel supplies three key elements associated with Isaac's story: the image of the fiery furnace, the motif of bowing down before false (though golden or "radiant") gods, and the per- formance of instrumental music to accompany such profane worship. Our Kievan storyteller, however, uses these elements in new ways, adapting them to suit his purposes. Isaac is not threatened with being thrown into a furnace if he refuses to bow down before his visitors; quite the contrary, he falls down gladly, and the furnace only appears as a metaphor in an aphorism. Nor does profane music serve as a prelude or signal to fall down and worship his shining visitor; in Isaac's case the music begins just after the fall. Isaac's temptation is more subtle - and therefore more dangerous - than the methods of Babylonian tyranny. Isaac is tricked into falling down, not compelled by threats. Instrumental music plays a role, not in his temptation, but in his later humiliation. So much, then, for certain aspects of storytelling art which must have given Isaac's story wide popular appeal: an accessible style enhanced by specific, easily-visualized details, a narrative pace unhindered by digres- sions, some impressive miracles, and a series of conflicts with "exotic" demons. Any lay listener could appreciate such features. But the work contains other levels. The author's purpose goes well beyond spinning an engrossing tale. What was his intended message? Was it the "Pauline" message which dominates so many Byzantine and Russian works on divine folly? We believe not; at least this theme is hardly central to Isaac's story. In other tales of holy fools the heroes are acting on Saint Paul's dictum that divine folly surpasses man's wisdom and that divine weakness is superior to man's strength. To shame the wise, God has chosen those whom the world regards as weak (I Cor: 3:18-31). Paul's words are fre- quently quoted, in fact, to help readers get the message (see Challis and Dewey, and sources cited there, 37, 39, 41). The literary jurodivyj typically appears as a reformer who engages in puzzling and "outrageous" acts to mock the vanity, corruption and wickedness in the world. With his powers of clairvoyance and prophecy he may also frighten and seem to bully, but his ultimate purpose is to save society's misguided members and to bring down those who deliberately commit evil. His "folly" is directed outwards, towards others. How different are Isaac's motives! He takes up jurodstvo to atone for his own vanity and to put down the demons who so cruelly tricked him. The author included a few motifs associated with divine folly, to be sure. Like his Byzantine forebear Isidora, Isaac dresses himself eccentrically and performs menial tasks for those with whom he lives.9 Like most of his predecessors (and successors) he ignores physical discomfort, achieves supernatural feats, and shuns "human glory." Such glory, we recall, first</page><page sequence="6">260 Slavic and East European Journal comes to him when he catches the raven. A modern reader may wonder why Isaac's fellow workers were so awestruck when they saw him with the bird. Did they marvel because they considered the raven a wise or "magic" creature - a ves{aja ptica like those whom God had entrusted to feed the prophet Elijah (I Kings 17:4-6)? Or did they still adhere to the Old Slavic view of the raven as a sinister force?'0 But the author avoids dwelling on Isaac's holy foolishness. He describes only one specific feat of "outrageous" jurodstvo - the act of assembling children and dressing them like monks. And no reason is provided for Isaac's conduct here, whereas the biographers of other holy fools generally explain or "motivate" their heroes' seemingly irrational behavior. For the rest we are merely told that Isaac "played nasty pranks, now on the abbot, now on the brethen, now on laymen," and was beaten by them. Isaac's last years, too, differ from those of most jurodivye. In general a holy fool, once embarked on a life of divine folly, will persist in it to the end. His jurodstvo holds center stage, with colorful episode following colorful episode, until the moment comes to die, at which time the hero commonly "fades away," with few persons aware of his actual demise. A holy fool's death seems unimportant, a sort of anti-climax to his life of spectacular, un- remitting struggle. But Isaac, once he has vanquished his demons, puts foolishness behind him, rejoining the monastic community and remaining a full-fledged member until death. Such a razvjazka is rare in works on divine folly." Isaac's death is described in some detail, resembling the manner in which a saint leaves the world: after lying serenely in the monastery for eight days he "departs in good confession" (after receiving the sacraments), and the abbot and all the brethren bury him "with honor." All this suggests that divine folly was not the dominant theme of Isaac's story. Does the main message, then, have to do with pride and humility? Put more specifically, does the tale not describe a man afflicted with a condition known as prelest', showing how that man nearly perished because of prelest', and how he was saved through the efforts of a dedicated fellow monk? Prelest' may be defined as a psychic state akin to fantasy or unhealthy self-delusion. The very antithesis of true humility (smirenie), which is a passionless state of mind, prelest' grows out of that "sin of sins, pride." The victim of prelest' suffers delusions of sanctity; his condition generates "pseudo-spiritual states" (mnimoduxovnye sostojanija) during which he may imagine himself in contact with Jesus, holding dialogues with Him, and so on.12 In tracing Isaac's passage from prelest' to serene, passionless humility, the author presents us with three sets of oppositions or contrasts. He draws these contrasts artfully yet indirectly, allowing the reader to perceive them on his own from the facts, as it were. If the oppositions were only dimly</page><page sequence="7">Divine Folly in Old Kievan Literature 261 sensed by some lay listeners, we must assume that clerical readers felt them keenly. The first set contrasts Isaac's formal or external asceticism with the pride and egocentric delusions which take over his soul. When Isaac becomes a monk, he goes to immediate extremes in his "pious" behavior. He lives all alone in his tiny cave, attired in hair shirt and goatskin, taking only bread and water, singing and praying, never lying down to sleep, and so on. After seven years he believes he is approaching sainthood. Without realizing it, he has become monstrously proud - so proud that he believes the "angels" when they tell him that Christ Himself has come to call. Isaac has succumbed to prelest'. A second contrast sets off the self-absorbed Isaac's prelest' against Theodosius' genuine humility and altruism. For all his asceticism, the cave- dwelling Isaac has no thought of helping others. His very ties to the "collec- tive" are tenuous - limited to the bread and water which Anthony passes through his window. After Isaac is stricken, Theodosius takes him into his own cell and patiently waits on him for two years, finally nursing him back to health. One detects no trace of flagrant asceticism or prelest' in Theodosius' service to Isaac, but the results are remarkable: he leads Isaac back from death's brink to life within the monastic community. The third opposition contrasts the "old Isaac" with the "new Issac." The "old Isaac" lived as a self-centered hermit and fell prey to demonic temptation. The "new Isaac" plays the holy fool, serving his brethren with self-effacing and long-suffering humility; he still faces temptation but now successfully withstands it. Finally he vanquishes his demonic foes. He has shed all traces of his earlier prelest'. It is to the author's credit that Isaac somehow stays in character despite passing from a iitie krepko to a new iitie zestoko. Finally, at the end of his life, Isaac achieves a saint-like apatheia, or passionless state. But does the dominant message in Isaac's story have to do with his transition from pride to humility? We think not. The reader of Isaac's tale easily discerns an order of preference or "hierarchy" when it comes to the author's evaluation of the different monkish lifestyles - those of the hermit, the holy fool and the coenobite. Nor should this surprise us. Chadwick re- minds us that from the fourth century onwards an "ideological tension" persisted among Eastern Christians, between those who upheld the "hermit ideal" and those who believed that "monastic life required a community un- der rule, with obedience to a superior." As for the numerous holy men who were "neither solitaries nor incorporated in a commnunity (coenobium), but wandered from place to place" - and most holy fools belonged to this last category - they "were regarded as an irresponsible, disturbing element.""3 The author of Isaac's story seems to regard the hermit's excessive solitude as unwise and to consider its practitioners as most exposed to the</page><page sequence="8">262 Slavic and East European Journal perils of prelest'.14 Divine folly is valued above solitary asceticism; jurodstvo can help "cure" a monk who has succumbed to prelest' while a hermit. But the highest service to God is coenobitic monasticism. Isaac welcomes that state after his victory over the demons. Although the story is ostensibly about Isaac, its real hero is Theodosius; Isaac's early deeds and aspirations are overshadowed by all that Theodosius stands for, particularly the collec- tive Studite ideal. And the work's closing eulogy, we recall, is not to Isaac the individual, but to the monasterial collective - the lavra brotherhood. Despite the merits of Isaac's story - one must acknowledge it as a well- constructed and well-narrated piece of literature - it did not set the pattern for subSequent tales of biographies of Russian holy fools. This Kieven tale tells us that jurodstvo should not be an end in itself, but that it can serve as an antidote for prelest' and thus open the way to the ideal coenobitic life. In later (North Russian) stories thejurodivye are never overshadowed by other protagonists, not even tsars or patriarchs. Divine folly, with its Pauline message directed at targets in the outside world, is more than a phase in the hero's life; it dominates the entire work. Once embarked on jurodstvo, the "foolish" hero remains true to it until death, as though to abandon his strange calling would be to lay down his arms in the never-ending struggle against sophistry and corruption.

Goly'enko and V. Dubrovina (M.: Nauka, 1967), 74-75. 7 Selected examples of Hebrew lore with commentary may be found in H. M. Nahmad, comp., A Portion in Paradise and Other Jewish Folktales (New York: Schocken, 1974), 16- 19, 42, 47, 61-66, 74, 78-80.

A Study in Folk Religion (New York: Behrman, 1939), particularly Chap. 3 ("The Powers of Evil"), 25-43, and Chap. 4 ("Man and the Demons"), 44-60. 8 That Kiev had a sizeable - and influential - Jewish community is clear even from casual references in our few surviving sources, e.g., the Kiev Patericon, which mentions it in con- nection with Theodosius' proselytizing efforts among Jews: Das Paterikon des Kiever Hbhlenklosters, 65. For data on Kiev's two Jewish suburbs and the "Jewish Gate," as well as references to Moses of Kiev, a rabbinical scholar, see S. Baron, The Russian Jew under Tsars and Soviets (New York: Macmillan, 1964), 6, and sources cited there. N. A. MeSderskij, "Iskusstvo perevoda Kievskoj Rusi," Trudy Otdela Drevnerusskoj Literatury (31 vols.; M.-L.: AN SSSR, 1934-76), XV, 58, argues convincingly that some Kievan literati were able to translate directly from Hebrew sources, rather than relying on the Greek. That Russians first regarded the Jew as a "veritable symbol of perfection," as Louis Greenberg, The Jews in Russia (New York: Schocken, 1976), 3, contends, may be an exaggeration, but we have little reason to challenge the same author's assertion that "Rus- sians thought of the Jew as a clever merchant and a carrier of culture." Nor can we ques- tion some Kievans' receptivity to Jewish thought. Nikita the Hermit, for example, came to know the Old testament "by heart" and wanted no more to do with the New Testament. Fellow monks in the Cave Monastery blamed his attitude on the devil and "cured" Nikita by exorcism and intensive reindoctrination. See Das Patericon des Kiever Hbhlenklosters, 125-27. The Slavic translation of the Sinai patericon has an additional section (roughly one-tenth of the total text) which is not to be found in the Byzantine original: Sinajskij paterik, 361-400. In this last part the demons seem considerably more "Jewish" than those in the earlier Byzantine section. Did the compilers draw on Jewish sources (folklore or other) directly, without Byzantine "intermediaries"? 9 The Greek text of Isidora's vita appears in D. C. Butler, The Lausiac History of Palladius II (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1904), 98-100, the English translation in W. Lowther-Clarke, The Lausiac History of Palladius (New York: Macmillan, 1918), 118-20. A Slavonic version appears in Kniga iitij svjatyx na mesjac Maij (s 1 po 13 den ) (M.: Sin. tip. 1880), 21-23. 10 One Slavic tradition held the raven to be a symbol of the "nether kingdom"; See V. Toporov, "K rekonstrukcii mifa o mirovom jajce (na materiale russkix skazok)," Readings in Soviet Semiotics, ed. L. Matejka et al., (Ann Arbor: Mich. Slavic Publications, 1977), 109, 116. In Jewish folklore the ravens play a more positive role, at least when deal- ing with a hero. See, for example, D. Noy, ed., Folktales of Israel (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1963), 54-55, and A Portion in Paradise, 127. 11 Mixail Klopskij is an important exception.

Dmitriev, Povesti o iitii Mixaila Klopskogo (M.-L.: Nauka, 1958).</page><page sequence="10">264 Slavic and East European Journal 12 A modern Orthodox theologian makes no mention of Isaac, but his definition of prelest' (which we have used) reads like a diagnosis of Isaac's condition when first visited by the demons: I. Brjanianinov, "U6ilise blago'estija," Pravoslavnaja ?izn ', 7 (1959), 32-33. 13 H. Chadwick, The Early Church (London: Cox and Wyman, 1967), 178. Authors of works in praise of divine folly, on the other hand, naturally contended that their heroes served God better than did the coenobite or anchorite; see our article "Byzantine Models for Russia's Literature of Divine Folly," 37, 40. One should note, however, that such authors held widely'divergent notions of "Christian perfection"; See J. Grosdidier de Matons, "Les thbmes d'6dification dans la vie d'Andre Salos," Centre de recherche d 'histoire et civilisation byzantines, Travaux et Mkmoires, (5 vols.; Paris: de Boccard, 1965) IV, 292-95, 305-11. 14 Nikita the Hermit, a young monk who wished to live a solitary life "not on God's ac- count," but wishing "to be glorified by men," also succumbed to prelest' after going into seclusion against the abbot's advice. The abbot vainly pointed out what had happened to Isaac. See Das Paterikon des Kiever Hbhlenklosters, 124-27. Even today Orthodox teachings, far from recommending the hermit's life for novices, warn against its dangers; see I. Brianchaninov, The Arena. An Offering to Contemporary Monasticism (Madras: Diocesan, 1970;, 14, 25. But for eloquent passages from St. Basil the Great on the life of solitude as a "paradise of the heart," see Anon., "Orthodox Monasticism in 5th and 6th Century Gaul," The Orthodox World, 13 (1977), 93.</page></plain_text>
