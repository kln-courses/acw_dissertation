Â© 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands. Articles .... I experience as much as anyone the uneasi- ness that an idea like that of God's anger inspires in modern man. Gabriel Marcel I That God has the capacity for anger - indeed, for anger of peerless intensity - constitutes a thesis with copious Scriptural foundation. One finds in the Sacred Text many graphic and stridently unsentimental depictions of divine wrath and its (at times) catastrophic consequences. While it is true that references to God's wrath appear with greater fre- quency in the Hebrew Bible1 than in the New Testament, Revelation 19:15 speaks explicitly "of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God". This notwithstanding, however, the idea of divine wrath has widely been regarded as an unacceptably naive or "primitive" piece of theology, i.e., as an anthropocentric slur upon the divine perfection. Indeed, as will shortly be elaborated, such is pretty much the view of those philosophical theologians that have been seriously influential in shaping normative theistic metaphysics. Accordingly, it has standardly been contended by distinguished philosophical representatives of Judaism and Christianity that the ascription of literal anger to God is a flagrant breach of concep- tual propriety. Moreover, this contention reflects the general doctrine that it is conceptually impermissible to ascribe any affective states to God. Rather (so the argument proceeds), the unsurpassable greatness of the</page><page sequence="2">130 divine nature entails that God is essentially impassable - that He neces- sarily lacks affective capacity. Accordingly, the doctrine that God can become literally wrathful reflects - so it has widely been held - an artless failure to grasp that the import of all ascription of affect to God is ex- clusively allegorical. In what follows, we propose to show that this long- standing theologically "sophisticated" view deserves our emphatic rejection. II To begin with, one needs no particular expertise in "hermeneutics" in order to recognize that God's wrath is portrayed in Scripture as having a distinctly moral nexus. That is, while a staple of Biblical monotheism is that God is "omnimerciful" or "slow to anger", He is also revealed in the Sacred Text as uncompromising in His demand for justice and overall moral decency. This being so, there are occasions (relatively infrequent, thank God) wherein the depth and scope of human sinfulness, i.e., of man's self-centered or willful violation of God's mandates, is of sufficient magnitude to provoke moral outrage in God. On such occasions, the divine requirement for justice and moral decency overrules (as it were) His mercy and tolerance, the result being that God then (to invert the well- worn adage) "tempers mercy with justice" by decreeing considerable suffering upon the relevant transgressors. Presumably, these "reactive decrees" - notwithstanding their harshness - are (given God's unsurpas- sable wisdom) precisely what is requisite for the proper chastening of those whose moral evil proved sufficient to provoke divine wrath. Of course, it would be misguided to suppose that God's moral outrage on the occasions in question warrants the view that He is less than infinitely caring2 towards His creatures. To the contrary, Biblical monotheism requires that divine wrath be seen as a corollary or function of divine care. Alternatively, it is because of God's immeasurable care for mankind that human sinfulness, and, accordingly, the pain and suffering that we inflict upon one another, can provoke Him to moral outrage.3 All of this notwithstanding, however, and as alluded to in our introduc- tion, distinguished philosophical theists have tended to reject a straightfor- ward interpretation of Scripture vis-a-vis God's capacity for wrath. Maimonides' analysis in this regard is instructively paradigmatic. He observes that while certain divine actions are "similar" to actions that we</page><page sequence="3">131 perform out of anger and other emotive states, one must not infer from this that there are (or can be) acts of God that result from a "similar aptitude of the soul".4 Rather, since God is to be "exalted above every deficiency", He is entirely bereft of passion. Aquinas is in full agreement: Anger and the like are attributed to God on account of a likeness of effect. Thus, because to punish is properly the act of an angry man, God's punishment is metaphorically spoken of as His anger.5 Of course, since it is emotion as such that is deemed unworthy of the divine nature - not simply "negative" emotions such as anger - even "positive" or admirable feelings such as compassion cannot with concep- tual propriety (on the canonical view) be predicated of God. In Chapter VIII of his Proslogion, Anselm defends the ostensibly outrageous doctrine that God is both compassionate and noncompassionate. Contradiction is eluded, however, since the sense in which Anselm maintains that God is compassionate turns out to be entirely Pickwickian. Specifically, and in his customary manner of doing philosophical theology in the context of talking to God, Anselm states the following concerning God's compas- sion: Truly, thou art so in terms of our experience, but thou art not so in terms of thine own. For, when thou beholdest us in our wretchedness, we experience the effect of compassion, but thou dost not experience thefeeling.6 Let us call this time-honored doctrine that it is conceptually improper to ascribe effective capacity to God - in, of course, a straightforward or literal sense - the Theologically Sophisticated Thesis (TST). In clear opposition to the TST is, of course, the claim that it is not conceptually improper to ascribe affective capacity to God. Let us call this latter contention the Theologically Naive Thesis (TNT). Needless to say that the TST has the support of many a modern theologian. For example, in discussing the "numinous" versus the "rational" aspects of the divine nature, Rudolph Otto supports the idea of "... defending the non-rational core of the Biblical conception of God from all excessive rationaliza- tion".7 However, notwithstanding the insight displayed by those who championed such a defense, Otto maintains that - unfortunately - they "sank into anthropomorphism" by virtue of defending . . . not figurative "anger" and "emotion", but literal anger and emotion,</page><page sequence="4">132 misconceiving the numinous character of the attributes in question . . . instead of realizing that they can only be admitted as figurative indica- tions of something essentially non-rational by means of symbols drawn from feelings that have analogy to it.8 Ill While the TST clearly has the weight of philosophical tradition in its corner, we hope to provide powerful justification for subscribing to the TNT over the TST. Accordingly, we intend to furnish strong philosophical vindication of a perfectly literal or straightforward construal of Scripture on the question of divine emotionality. So far as I can see - and I admit to being less than entirely clear about how to individuate arguments - it seems to me that there are three independent strands of reasoning in support of the TST that have a preliminary air of plausibility. Call them (1) The Argument from God's Absolute Immutability, (2) The Argument from Divine Incorporeality, and (3) The Argument from Divine Infal- libility, In addition to exposing - as concisely as we can - each of them as deficient, our refutation of the third and final argument for rejecting the TNT (or accepting the TST) involves the introduction and elaboration of a concept that constitutes the core of our positive defense of the TNT. Hence, it turns out that our reply to the final argument for rejecting the TNT embodies all of the justification we need for accepting the TNT - and thus for rejecting the TST. The Argument from God's Absolute Immutability, perhaps the most frequently employed polemic of those who argue for the conceptual impropriety of ascribing affective capacity to God, is rooted in the assumption that maximal greatness requires the transcendence of all changeability. This, in turn, seems to be derived from (though it seems far from clear just which idea is more "basic", if, indeed, one of them can properly be regarded as more basic than the other) the Aristotelian conception of Deity as necessarily devoid of potentiality, i.e., from the idea of God as Pure Act, Such a conception of God has been defended by an impressive number of theistic metaphysicians, including, of course, such luminaries of the tradition as Maimonides and Aquinas. Moreover, since it is natural to suppose that the properties being capable of affect and being absolutely immutable are incompatible,9 it seems eminently plausible to maintain that "X is immutable in all respects" entails "X lacks affective capacity".</page><page sequence="5">133 Response: Why accept the thesis of God's absolute immutability? Since the literature now contains arguments (by, incidentally, very traditional theists) for rejecting this doctrine that are - or so it seems to me - as strong or definitive as one can reasonably hope for,10 it would be gratuitous to devote serious space here in an effort to refute what has already (or so I believe) been refuted. Rather, we might simply note the following: one looks in vain for Scriptural support of the doctrine of God's absolute immutability. While Malachi 3:6 does tell us "For I the LORD change not - which, by the way, constitutes Aquinas" (sole) Biblical basis for subscribing to this doctrine (ST., Vol. I, Part I, Ques. 9) - a careful look at the context in which this sentence occurs, i.e., taking careful account of all that leads up to it (all that is said under Malachi 3:5), reveals that the sort of "immutability" in question is that of moral constancy: we can depend on God's unsurpassable goodness to be absolutely unwaver- ing. Accordingly, and quite independently of whether one holds to the view that God is absolutely - hence ontologically - immutable, it is remarkably perplexing that Malachi 3:6 has been cited by influential philosophical theists as justification for that view. Accordingly, it is very hard to see how that passage can properly be taken to warrant a conception of God as immutable in the sense that would seem to preclude His possession of affective capacity. Of course, it might be held that, absent Scriptural foundation for regarding God as immutable in all respects, there is philosophical or conceptual basis for doing so. It might, for example, be maintained that absolute immutability constitutes a requirement of maximal greatness. This contention, however, should properly be disposed of by our response to the third and final argument against the TNT. For what will have been shown thereby - assuming the success of that response - is that the possession of affective capacity is entirely compatible with maximal greatness. Accordingly, since (as noted previously) it is natural to suppose that the capacity for emotion is incompatible with absolute immutability, it is proper to conclude that being immutable in all respects is not a require- ment of maximal greatness. (2) The Argument from Gods Incorporeality is rooted in the notion that a conceptually necessary condition for the possession of affective capacity is the possession of a neurophysiology. Hence, since an absolutely central component of traditional theistic metaphysics is that God is essentially incorporeal, the ascription of literal affective capacity to God (so the argument proceeds) is unacceptable.</page><page sequence="6">134 Response: While there appears to be an empirically invariant associa- tion between the possession of affective capacity and the possession of a neurophysiology - experience seems to record no case of the former minus the latter - this clearly fails to entail that possessing a neurophysiol- ogy is conceptually necessary for possessing affective capacity. Moreover, it is readily seen that traditional theism entails the denial of the contention that one must possess a neurophysiology in order to possess affective capacity. To begin with, it is axiomatic to canonical theistic doctrine that God is both incorporeal and the subject of mental states, e.g., thoughts, beliefs, judgments. Accordingly, traditional theism patently entails that the possession of a neurophysiology is not a conceptual requirement for the possession of mental states. However, since their availability to introspec- tion ensures that anger, sadness, joy, and the like constitute mental states no less than do knowledge, beliefs, judgments, etc., God's essential incorporeality no more precludes His possessing affective capacity than it precludes His possessing intellective capacity. Of course, one might reject traditional theism by maintaining that mental states "reduce" to, or are necessarily dependent upon, physiologi- cal processes. But any such maneuver hardly constitutes a special threat to our thesis, i.e., that the ascription of literal affective capacity to God is entirely within the bounds of conceptual propriety. Moreover, if past attempts to establish the truth or plausibility of materialism are any indication of the measure of success that we can expect from future efforts on behalf of that ontology, it seems fair to conclude that traditional theism has little to fear from that quarter. (3) The Argument from Divine Infallibility can be taken to proceed as follows: as an absolutely perfect being, nothing about God's nature, states, actions, etc. could conceivably admit of the slightest deficiency. However, if God possessed affective capacity, He would not be absolutely immune from deficiency. For affective reactions are notorious for often being impulsive, unmeasured or over-reactive, uncalled-for, arbitrary, and otherwise injudicious, i.e., in many ways inappropriate to the situations that occasion them. Thus (so the argument unfolds), affective capacity carries with it the potential for a certain sort of fallibility that might properly be called "affective fallibility". Accordingly, since it is unim- peachable that God is essentially infallible, it is clear that He necessarily lacks affective capacity. Response: while God's absolute perfection ensures that there could be no conceivable respect in which He was fallible, it is no way derivable</page><page sequence="7">135 from this that His nature precludes affective capacity. For the claim that it is so derivable assumes that affective fallibility is a corollary of affective capacity. Surely, however, any such assumption deserves to be rejected. Consider, for example, the (all too) familiar phenomenon of intellectual fallibility. Clearly, human persons are intellectually fallible; indeed, our proclivity for holding false beliefs and assenting to unsound arguments is legendary. Note, however, that our being intellectually fallible in no way legitimates the idea that being intellectually fallible is a corollary of the possession of intellect. Rather, the case of God illustrates the spuriousness of any such contention, i.e., intellectual /^fallibility cannot but constitute one of God's essential attributes. Likewise, the inherent perfection of the divine nature could no more admit of affective deficiency than of intellec- tive deficiency. Accordingly, that affective fallibility accompanies affective capacity in human persons in no way warrants the view that the ascription of affective capacity to God is conceptually improper. To the contrary, God's absolute flawlessness ensures that, necessarily, if God (exists and) possesses affective capacity, He is affectively infallible. IV What we are now positioned to see is that the concept of Affective Infallibility is just what it takes to ensure the conceptual propriety of ascribing affective capacity to God in a perfectly straightforward or literal sense of "affective capacity". Reference to the divine intellect should once again prove to be instructive. In observing that God's intellect is perfect, there is compelling indication that the force of the word "intellect" is - and quite properly so - entirely literal. Consider: in recognizing that God's intellect is (in glaring contradistinction to our own) maximally great, we thereby acknowledge that there obtains a staggeringly vast difference between the cognitive power of man and that of God. However, that hardly justifies the notion that, in speaking of God's intellect, the term "intellect" cannot properly be understood in its literal sense. More posi- tively, since it is axiomatic that God's intellect could not conceivably admit of the slightest deficiency, it seems conceptually gratuitous to construe the divine intellect allegorically or "analogically". For when we assert that God's intellect is perfect, what idea of significance is conveyed but that the capacity for cognition, reasoning, judging, etc. that we possess</page><page sequence="8">136 (or exercise) so imperfectly is precisely the capacity that is possessed (or always exercised) by God in an absolutely unsurpassable manner? Likewise for the ascription of affective capacity to God. We have seen that the divine perfection does not preclude God's possession of such capacity, but, rather, precludes His being affectively fallible. Hence, just as with the case of God's intellect, it would be conceptually gratuitous to hold that, if we ascribe affective capacity to God, the "capacity" in question must be construed in figurative rather than literal terms. Rather, in recognizing that God could be nothing short of affectively infallible, we thereby recognize that precisely the capacity for affective response that we find in ourselves, a capacity that all too often results in emotive reactions that are (in many ways) inappropriate to the situations that occasion them, is possessed (or always exercised) by God in a manner that is consonant with His absolutely flawless nature. While this fails to entail that God actually possesses affective capacity, it does entail that the ascription of such capacity to God - in, of course, an entirely literal or straightforward sense - is entirely within the bounds of conceptual propriety. Accordingly, the concept of Affective Infallibility is seen to be precisely what it takes to ensure the triumph of the TNT over the TST, i.e., it ensures that there is nothing conceptually problematic about the view that God can become wrathful or morally outraged in a perfectly straightforward or literal sense. Since it is evident that an affective response that was less than fully appropriate could not conceivably be an affective response of God's, no case of divine anger - whatever its intensity - could be impulsive, overreactive, injudicious, or in any other way inappropriate to the situation that occasioned it. Intriguingly, then, it turns out that there is nothing unduly anthropocentric about the ascription of affective capacity to God. Rather, and more than a little ironically, it is those who deny the conceptual propriety of ascribing such capacity to God (insofar as this denial takes its cue from the affective fallibility characteris- tic of human affective response) who are guilty of such anthropocentrism. V If our argument thus far has succeeded, what has been secured is that the possession of affective capacity is - pace what has traditionally been held to be the case - compatible with maximal greatness. Might it be plausible, however, to make the stronger claim that the possession of affective</page><page sequence="9">137 capacity is required by maximal greatness?11 Briefly, it seems to me that there is profound intuitive sanction for the claim that affective capacity is a morally significant capacity, and, as such, constitutes an essential ingredient of moral perfection. If this is so, then - given as axiomatic that maximal greatness entails moral perfection - there is serious intuitive basis for maintaining that the possession of affective capacity is concep- tually requisite for maximal greatness, and, accordingly, for its religious corollary worship-worthiness. While this is not, course, to suggest that "intuitive justification" constitutes definitive justification, the brief speculations to follow are offered in the spirit of the Kripkean principle that it is misguided not to regard our intuitions as having ("ultimately speaking") significant evidential value.12 Central to our deliberations is a consideration of what would be included in the (or a) morally called-for response by a morally perfect individual to heinous moral evil. Rather than attempting anything so elusive and problematic as a rigorous definition of the concept of moral perfection, I suggest that an Anselmian-sort of "gedanken-experiment" is more than adequate to the task. Imagine a case of extreme moral evil (e.g., willful genocide) - brought about by (who else?) a group of human persons - and consider the following (alternative) responses to this evil by two candidates for moral perfection. Candidate One responds by punishing severely those responsible for this evil. We might also assume that this punitive action (call it A) is not only morally fitting but is such that its moral fittingness - as a response to the moral evil in question - is unsurpas- sable. However, Candidate One is neither angered, dismayed, nor reveolted by the heinous moral evil to which He has responded with action A. Candidate Two, however, in addition to responding to the case of willful genocide with action A - that punitive action the moral fittingness of which is unsurpassable - experiences wrath, i.e., is morally outraged by the genocidal slaughter in question. Is it not intuitively clear that - other relevant things (such as action A) "being equal" - Candidate Two, simply by virtue of Her affective responsiveness, is morally greater than Can- didate One? This does not, let it be clear, entail that Candidate One is to be faulted for not responding affectively to the case of genocide. For it might well be (let us stipulate that such is indeed the case) that Candidate One lacks affective capacity, and it seems incontestable that no one can properly be faulted for failing to respond in a way in which he/she is unable to respond. However, that in no way implies that the capacity in question</page><page sequence="10">138 does not morally enhance the nature of one who possesses it, i.e., does not significantly contribute to the level at which one weighs in on the "moral greatness" scale. Analogously, while my neighbor Sam is hardly to be faulted for his lack of athletic wherewithal, it is nonetheless true that, in at least this respect, Babe Ruth and Willie Mays are considerably greater than Sam. It seems to me that these speculations, while failing to yield conclusive justification for viewing the possession of affective capacity as an entail- ment of maximal greatness, ensure the rational acceptability of so viewing it. If so, then it is far from implausible to maintain that, necessarily, a being that lacks affective capacity is not a being than which a greater cannot be thought. What does seem to have been definitively or con- clusively adduced, however - with, of course, a major assist from the idea of Affective Infallibility - is that the TNT triumphs over the TST; i.e., that we are entitled to hold with complete confidence that the ascription of affective capacity to God is entirely within the bounds of conceptual propriety. Appendix While recognizing that attempts to provide convincing rigorous definitions of key notions have often proved to be quixotic, our argument might seem less than complete, given the clear centrality of the concept of Affective Infallibility to our thesis, minus some effort at formal explication of this concept. Fortunately, or so it seems to me, the idea in question is amenable to reasonably stringent definition. I suggest that the following fills the bill: N is affectively infallible = df Necessarily, for any emotion E, intensity of emotion /, and situation S of which N is aware, E of /-intensity constitutes the perfectly appropriate affective response to S iff E of /- intensity constitutes (is qualitatively identical to) N's affective response toS.13 Now lest it be contended that the foregoing generates a Euthyphro-typs conundrum, it should be clear that, while none of God's affective responses could conceivably fail to be perfectly appropriate, this in no way implies that their being perfectly appropriate just consists in their being God's affective responses. Brief reference to "divine-command" theories of moral obligation is all that we need to establish this point. Central to all</page><page sequence="11">139 such theories is that morally obligatory actions are necessarily coextensive with those actions that are commanded by God. This alone, however, fails to entail what many14 have thought to be the problematic doctrine that the moral obligatoriness of morally obligatory actions just consists in their having been commanded by God. Likewise, while God's affective infallibility ensures that, necessarily, He is incapable of an affective response that was less than perfectly appropriate to the situation that occasioned it, this fails to entail that perfectly appropriate affective responses are such that their perfect appropriateness just consists in their being qualitatively identical to what would be God's affective responses to the respective situations that occasioned them.15 Notes 1. Consider, for example, Exodus 22:23 and 32:10-11, Nehemiah 13:18, Ezekiel 7:14, Hosea 5:10, Deuteronomy 11:16, and the (entire if brief) Book of Nahum. 2. Among the nonnegotiable components of canonical theism is, of course, the doctrine of divine love. Indeed, St. Thomas went so far as to identify God's essence with His love (cf. Summa Theologica I, Question 20, Article 3, Obj. 2 and Reply Obj. 2). 3. For an especially valuable "theological" or faith-oriented discussion of the significance of God's wrath in Scripture and its connection with His compassion and love, cf.

There may well be situations to which there is more than one perfectly (or entirely) appropriate affective response. To accommodate any such case, the latter part of the definiens can be adjusted to read "... is precisely identical to an affective response that might be (have been) ATs affective response to S." Additionally, it should be clear that our explication is perfectly compatible with their being countless situations to which the (or a) perfectly appropriate affective response is the absence of any such response at all. 14. But not all, of course. Followers of William of Ockham, for example, find nothing problematic about the idea that the moral obligatoriness of morally obligatory actions is entirely a function of God's commanding that they be done. 15.
