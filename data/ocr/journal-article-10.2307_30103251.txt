<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BEGINNING OF NARRATIVE ART IN THE GREEK GEOMETRIC PERIOD (PLATES 5-12) I THE very familiarity of Greek art is apt to make us take its development very much for granted.' It has a beginning in the isolated silhouettes and matchstick processions of Geometric art; progresses through an ever more faithful, that is to say illusionistic, rendering of the objects of the natural world to classic formalism; goes on to the remarkable technical proficiency of the third century B.c.; and finally declines in late Hellenistic sterilities before being absorbed and transformed by Imperial Rome and the Early Christians. It seems to be a sort of organic process: birth, flowering, and death follow in such a logical and apparently inevitable fashion that it is difficult not to be seduced by the metaphor. It is beyond the scope of this inquiry to discuss the validity of this 'organic' interpretation, interesting though the question is.z But such an interpretation makes us see the development of Acknowledgements.

I My manuscript was substantially complete when J. L. Benson's extremely interesting study Horse, Bird and Man (Amherst, 1970) appeared. The thesis there presented, that the Geometric artist knew and drew upon the traditions of both Mycenaean and Egyptian art, and that his visual world was as formulaic, distant, and heroic as that of the contemporary epic bard, is evidently incompatible with many of my own views. There is much of value and much to provoke thought in Benson's book, and I may have under- estimated the possibility of some kind of continuity in figure-drawing traditions from Mycenaean to Geometric times. On the other hand, he perhaps goes too far in deny- ing powers of iconographic invention to Geometric artists. But rather than indulge in detailed controversy, I have thought it best to present my argument in its original form. Iudicet lector. 2 The organic interpretation fits Greek art much better than it does Roman, which is perhaps why its relevance to the former has been far less often questioned.

The whole process, once started, seems inevitable. But in fact the most remarkable thing of all is that the process did start; and this paper is an attempt to throw a little light on its beginnings. E. H. Gombrich, in a chapter of his brilliant and fascinating book, Art and Illusion,3 character- izes what happened in Greece between the eighth and fifth centuries B.c. as the 'Greek Revolu- tion'. He stresses the uniqueness of Greek art, in that it was the first time in the history of man that artists broke away from reliance on what he calls schemata. These are typical or conven- tional renderings used much as words or symbols might be used; and, like words, they lack any individuality or illusionistic qualities. The Greeks introduced 'corrections' into the schemata inherited from their own past and from the arts of Egypt and the Near East, so as to 'match' more nearly the actual appearance of things. Why did this happen? As Gombrich says 'What is normal to man and child all over the globe is the reliance on schemata, on what is called 'con- ceptual' art. What needs explanation is the sudden departure from this habit that spread from Greece to other parts of the world.' The explanation that Gombrich advances is connected with narrative art. He observes the lack of narrative illustration in Egyptian and Mesopotamian art by contrast with the 'free evocation of mythological events such as we know them from the arts of Greece and its successors'.4 He then discusses the character of Greek narration, in other words Homer, emphasizing the vividness of observation and description in the epic, and concludes: 'Where the poet was given the licence to vary and embroider the myth and to dwell on the "how" in the recital of epic events, the way was open for the visual artist to do likewise.' In brief, the vivid and dramatic narrative techniques of the poet were responsible for the freeing of Greek art from the tyranny of the schema. This is an attractive theory. It has the merit of supplying a specific reason for the Greek Revolution and does not depend on vague abstractions like 'the Greek spirit'. But if Gombrich is right, another question immediately occurs to us: why was Greek narration illustrated at all? Although the visual arts of the twentieth century have all but severed those links with narrative that go back to the Greek Revolution, it may still be difficult for us to realize that art before the Greeks had nothing to do with the illustration of literature and little to do with the rendering of specific time and place. Gombrich maintains that there is a difference between the way events are described in the Iliad and in the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh. Perhaps he is right. But the most striking fact is that illustrations of any particular event in the Gilgamesh Epic are almost entirely lacking-indeed, if one leaves aside the remarkable and isolated phenomenon of the Akkadian cylinder-seals, completely lacking.s And the civilizations of Mesopotamia, Anatolia, the Levant, and Egypt possessed many other stories of a mythological or heroic nature, references to which in the visual arts are limited to a few stereotyped and generic representations.6 Why then did the Greek epics furnish for a long time the chief, almost the only, 3 London and New York, I960 (Chapter iv, 'Reflections on the Greek Revolution'). 4 See the symposium 'Narration in ancient art', AJA 1xi (1957) 43-9I. s On the question of the identification of the bull-man of Mesopotamian glyptic as Enkidu, see the cautious dis- cussion of H. Frankfort, Cylinder Seals (London, 1939) 62-7. If the bull-man is Enkidu, as seems possible, the fact re- mains that he is being portrayed in characteristic rather than specific activity; and it may be, as Frankfort suggests, that existing Enkidu-images generated the descriptions in the poem, rather than vice versa. Gilgamesh himself is not certainly identifiable, unless one allows that any man depicted with a bull-man may, by association, be taken as Gilgamesh. The one possibly specific incident is Frankfort's pl. xi m, but there are no inscriptions and no other certain representations in other media to clinch the identification; but cf. the statuette mentioned at the end of the next note. 6 The rare mythological representations in Egyptian art do not depend on any particular narrative source, and owe their appearance to their religious or symbolic importance (Kantor in AJA lxi (1957) 44). It is Mesopotamian glyptic which provides the richest stock of illustrations of mythology; in particular, of episodes from the Babylonian Epic of Creation whose hero is the sun-god Marduk (see Langdon, The Babylonian Epic of Creation, Oxford, 1923). But this epic</page><page sequence="3">NARRATIVE ART IN THE GEOMETRIC PERIOD 27 subjects of Greek art? I believe that there is here a question that needs answering, and this paper is an investigation into the way in which epic scenes entered the subject-matter of Greek art in the second half of the eighth century B.C. What happened, as I hope to show, is that two different art-cultures met, that of Greece and that of the Near East. Neither culture had a tradition of narrative art, but both employed animal and human figures, either decoratively, or in traditional compositions, or in the repre- sentation of timeless ritual scenes. The figures were little more than ideographs, stereotypes without individuality or context in time or place, whose purpose was sufficiently fulfilled if they were recognized. Yet from the meeting of these two art-cultures sprang a completely new type of art which was to become one of the glories of later European civilization. II The moment of change from the Middle to the Late Geometric periods7 is marked by the introduction into Greek art of something quite new-new, that is, since the collapse of Myce- naean civilization and the almost complete obliteration of its artistic heritage: namely, massed figure-scenes. These first appear on the pottery painted by the man we know as the Dipylon Master. This is evidently a critical time, both from the point of view of painting, and because of developments which occurred in other media at about the same time. To understand the full significance of these, and to appreciate the importance of what happened in the Late Geometric period, it is necessary to know what immediately preceded. First, then, I shall try to outline the repertory of representational motifs8 in Greek Geometric art before the end of the Middle Geometric period, shortly before 750 B.c. For the moment, is hardly in the same category as the Epic of Gilgamesh, let alone the Iliad; it is rather a religious text, and its per- formance constituted part of the Babylonian New Year festival, the chief event of the religious year (Frankfort, op. cit. n. 5, 97). Illustrations of other myths (e.g. the myth of Zu, Frankfort 132 ff.) may likewise be seen as expressions of religious belief; though the seal apparently portraying the myth of Etana, a man who assisted an eagle and was carried up to heaven to obtain the plant of birth, is clearly a narrative illustration of a story told for its own sake. The Akkadian seal-cutters, one may conclude, definitely por- trayed on their seals specific episodes from the myths of their culture; these myths concerned chiefly the gods, and hence the content of the scenes is in a sense religious. But the narrative interest is present and important. None the less, these illustrations of myth and epic become very rare after the Akkadian period (AJA lxi (1957) 6o), and it must be very doubtful whether the occasional occurrence of similar scenes in Assyrian glyptic represents a living tradi- tion (see Frankfort 198-9). It is impossible, in fact, to believe that Akkadian artistic practice influenced in any way the artists of the Geometric period in Greece some one and a half millennia later. This is not to claim that art did not make use of mythological material; there is, for instance, a statuette in the Louvre (to which Dr. Barnett drew my attention) showing a Gilgamesh-type figure standing on a Humbaba-type head. But this, like the Egyptian references, denotes rather the permanent state of victory than any interest in the action of the story. 7 For terminology and chronology I use the system of Coldstream (GGP 330). The Attic sequence, which is by far the most important runs as follows: Early Geometric (EG) I 900-875 'ruhgeometrisch' 11875-850 Middle Geometric (MG) I 850-800 = 'streng- II 800-760 geometrisch' Late Geometric (LG) Ia 760-750 = 'reif- Ib 750-735) geometrisch' IIa 735-720 = 'spiit- IIb 720-700) geometrisch' 8 The question of the origin of these motifs and the reason for their use is both beyond the scope of this study and unrewarding to discuss. There are two basic viewpoints, either of which may be adopted, according to taste: (i) that some or all of the motifs, linear and representa- tional, are symbolic-a view which finds its extreme mani- festation in Anna Roes's Greek Geometric Art, its Symbolism and its Origin (Haarlem &amp; London, 1933). More moderate is W. Kraiker, 'Die Anfainge der Bildkunst in der attischen Malerei des 8. Jhr. v. Chr.', BJ clxi (I961) 108-20, who proposes (p. I I1) that the very early horses have a chthonic symbolism, being found only on funerary vessels; this is not strictly true, since Agora P 1654 (EG I, see n. 14 below) and P 6422 (a MG II krater, Davison fig. 145) are not from graves, and it should also be remembered that the great majority of preserved pots of this epoch come from graves in any case. None the less, the possible allusion to Poseidon Hippios remains. (ii) that the urge to draw simple figures of animals and people is common to mankind and requires no explanation (cf. pp. 38-9).</page><page sequence="4">28 JOHN CARTER I shall defer consideration of the Cretan bronze shields and related metalwork (see p. 44 below). As for the Attico-Boeotian class of fibulae with enlarged catchplates, on which are engraved animal and human subjects, I shall mention individual examples where they are relevant to the discussion. By far the greater number of those surviving have no datable context. The ones which can be approximately dated lie between the chronological limits of Kerameikos Grave 41, c. 850 B.c., and the early part of the seventh century.9 There seems no prima facie reason for supposing that the human figures and occasional mythological subjects found on these fibulae occur earlier upon them than upon other classes of object. Until firm evidence to the contrary can be produced, I hold that such developed subjects (particularly outside Argos and Attica) belong to the very late Geometric and sub-Geometric periods, and that the Boeotian fibulae display the same stylistic retardation as the contemporary pottery of that region. The most recent student of the material concludes: 'The pieces with mythological or other narrative scenes are all among the latest, and none of these ought to predate 700 B.c.'IO (a) The horse This is undoubtedly the commonest art-animal of the Early and Middle Geometric periods. It even occurs in Protogeometric," which is almost entirely devoid of representations of any kind. A propos of one of these (Kerameikos inv. no. 91 ) Desborough remarks: 'It is interesting to note that when the horse does make his appearance, he is not allowed to invade areas tradi- tionally reserved for rectilinear and circular ornament, but is either tucked away in some inconspicuous position, or else he is found conspicuously-as here-but in an area never before used for decoration, the neck.'Iz The animal form, it seems, is an intruder into the austerely abstract world of geometric decoration. The horse is just as uncommon on the pottery of the ninth century as of the tenth. There are a pair, facing each other across a swastika, on the neck of an amphora in Athens,13 and possibly the same arrangement on a fragmentary drinking-vessel from the Agora.I4 Both these are EG I. EG II yields nothing, MG I only a single inconspicuous example: on the fragmentary krater from Kerameikos Grave 43,15s beneath the handle, stands a horse. (We shall revert to this krater later.) In MG II the horse becomes slightly commoner, and, as a motif, less retiring. There are three examples of largish pots which all have metopes containing a single horse placed either side of the handles.16 The most important place in the decorative scheme, the central zone between the handles, is still occupied by the canonical maeander. The horses themselves have an air of improvisation about them, as though they were the spontaneous inventions of their creators. The same touch of amateurishness appears in the remaining Attic example (PLATE 5a). Here, on a humble mug,7 the painter has felt freer to experiment and has painted a three-figure 9 See BMQ xxiii (1961) 105. 1o K. DeVries, 'Hesiodic pictures: the Greek incised fibulae', AJA lxxiv (1970) 192 (summary). Fittschen (213- I) dates the bulk of the material around or after 700 B.c.; while R. Hampe, Friihgriechische Sagenbilder in Biotien (Athens, 1936) dates the material considerably earlier.

I know of one other pot of this period which bears a horse: a Cretan amphora from Knossos (GGP pl. 52c) which is very strongly Atticizing, and perhaps not quite so early as Coldstream, who gives it to Cretan EG (810-790), would make it. It shows a rather rubbery-looking animal tethered to a manger, and one might perhaps be justified in</page><page sequence="5">NARRATIVE ART IN THE GEOMETRIC PERIOD 29 group-two men with a horse between them. Although the composition fails to cohere, and the three elements remain visually separate, this is a very significant step forward in the develop- ment of Geometric painting. We have here a descriptive, not merely a decorative juxtaposition, which reflects a real relationship between the warrior and his horse. This is still a long way from narrative. It is no more than a generic statement. But it is the kind of statement that could not be made by the isolated figures which preceded it. Here, already, is an indication of the dominant characteristic of Greek art, its preoccupation with rendering the actual appearances and events of the visible world. Outside Attica, I know of only four instances of the horse before LG, all MG II: one of these is an Argive(?) export, the others are a Cretan amphora and two Argive pots,'8 all of which may be seen as imitating Attic fashions. The stylistic simplicity, even naivete, of these painted horses is paralleled in their plastic contemporaries. The terracotta horses of the tenth and ninth centuries from Athens are almost certainly children's toys'9 and it would be a mistake to discern in them either funerary sym- bolism or evidence for any process of stylistic development. A special case is the horse which does duty as a handle. The earliest example known is a ghost which has left prints of hooves and tail on the lid of an EG I globular pyxis from the Agora.20 Otherwise there is nothing till MG II, when the pyxis from Kerameikos Grave 6921 inaugurates a fashion which became really popular in LG I and lasted into LG II. Big pyxides acquire up to four horses;22 and a consistent tradition of decoration is maintained which is not so evident either in their predecessors or in con- temporary non-Attic imitations:23 reserved head with St. Andrews' cross or related ornament, breast-band of tangential circles (occasionally replaced by hatching),24 and across the back a band of dots, sometimes omitted. But a coherent pattern of stylistic evolution in the modelling inferring from it the existence of this subject in the Attic MG II repertoire. Ahlberg (PE 211) sees possible Near Eastern influence in the motif of two antithetic horses with a man between them, but her cited parallels are sculptural and date from near or after 700 B.C. IS Argive(?) export: krater frr. Samaria-Sebaste iii. 211 fig. 34. 1-2. Cretan amphora: see n. 17. Argive are the pyxis from Makris grave I, bearing two horses(?) and a man in a separate panel (GGP 124); and the kantharos Argos C33, with five horses on one side and five deer on the other (CGA pls. 60o, I39). H. Walter (Samos v, Friihe grie- chische Gefdsse, Bonn, 1968) publishes as ninth-century a krater-fragment (no. 25, pl. 6) bearing the head and neck of a horse at a manger. The fabric, which one cannot judge from a photograph, may of course provide an overriding argument for this dating; but the subject, virtually re- stricted to the Cycladic, Euboean, and Boeotian schools andto the LG period, and the confident and mannered stylization of the horse would naturally indicate an LG date. The hatching of the neck is hardly in itself sufficient reason for placing this fragment in EG, as Walter does (p. i8); note that the terracotta votive horses from the Heraion are most commonly hatched (AM lxv (1940) 1oi n. 2). '9 Ker pl. 142, inv. 642, and two without inv. nos., pls. 142, 143 (top); Schweitzer pl. 24, Zervos pls. 133, 135, 136. No. 642 is without doubt a toy since its legs are bored to take an axle. Unfortunately all three are isolated finds; but the only others of the Geometric period from this cemetery (pl. 143, inv. 1312, 1313) are from a child's grave (no. 50) containing other toys: a hen (pl. 144, inv. 1309), a donkey (pl. 144, inv. 1311), a basket (pl. II8, inv. 1307), and a miniature amphora (pl. Io, inv. 1306; cf. GGP 38 n. I). (For a rather different interpretation of the contents of this grave, see Ker 42.) Thus of the five examples from the Kera- meikos three are certainly toys; there is also a PG example, complete with wheels, from a child's grave in Amphiktyon St., Athens (ADelt xxii (1967) Chr 49 pl. 70. 1). The pre- sumption is therefore strong that the remaining two from the Kerameikos are also toys; on the other hand one was found in grave a at Eleusis, a woman's grave. Cf. also the terracotta donkeys or mules carrying jars (n. 48 below). 20 Agora P 19240, from grave D 16:2 (GGP II, pl.

Also early are the lid Ker pl. 66 neg. 5706, minus its animal but with a vestigial knob; and the horse in Heidelberg (CVA iii, pl. 103) minus its lid and with a strange ornament on its side resembling a Dipylon shield with rectangular instead of semicircular notches. Possibly contemporary with these is the pyxis illustrated by F. Matz, Geschichte der griechischen Kunst i (Frankfurt, 1950) pl. 26: the horse has a vertical chain of three cross-hatched lozenges on each shoulder, and no collar, which suggests an early, experimental stage of development. On the other hand there is no vestigial knob, and the chief ornament around the edge of the lid is the dotted lozenge which first becomes common in LG I (Matz gives this pot as from the Kerameikos; Kiibler, Ker 179 n. 176, denies this, but does not give the true origin or present location).

They are in origin no more than the expression of the primitive and universal desire to model and to embellish, and even at the height of their popularity they remain relatively unsophisticated and quite innocent of artistic influences from neighbouring cultures. There are also a mass of votive terracottas, mostly of very crude style, from sanctuaries in other parts of Greece.25 Such indications as there are of date place the majority of these in the eighth century, and at that time they are by far the commonest votive animal. The third main class of Geometric horses is the bronzes. Accurate dating of these is almost impossible before the mid-eighth century. They fall into two chief categories. There are the individual animals, often fixed to some sort of stand, which are found as votive offerings in large numbers at the chief sanctuaries of the epoch; and there are those that were fixed to the ring-handles of the great bronze tripod-cauldrons which were the most impressive dedications of the Geometric age at the same sanctuaries. But we have neither stratification nor closely-dated sequences of associated pottery to help us put these bronzes in a firm chronological series. Comparisons with painted and terracotta examples will not help since, as we have seen, these are too few in the period that concerns us at the moment to exhibit any consistent pattern of development-quite apart from the doubtful validity of such comparisons between works in different materials. Typology is the last resort of the baffled archaeologist-and here one must beware of the danger of constructing an artificially logical sequence which ignores variations in artistic competence and place of manufacture. In the case of the individual figurines, all one can say is that in view of the relative sophistication of the eighth-century examples, it is unlikely that the series begins much later than the middle of the ninth century.26 The tripod-cauldrons are more complex in form and survive (at least in fragments) in greater numbers. They offer the typologist a rich field. But external checks are entirely lacking, so that both the over-all chronology and the extent to which various types overlap are matters of pure speculation.27 Two points seem reasonably certain, however. First, the type with massive cast ring-handles is earlier than the type with hammered handles; and second, the series that we have cannot well begin later than the ninth century-though of course it may go back much further. For our immediate purpose, to establish the repertoire of animal ornament current in Greece in the first half of the eighth century, the uncertainties are not important. In the later examples the horse is overwhelmingly the most common animal, either by itself, or being led (in one case ridden)28 by a man. But in the earliest group, with massive handles of complex section, 25 Samos, Heraion: Ohly, AM lxv (i940) 90 ff., pls. 57-9 (cattle commoner earlier, horses later).

Delphi: apparently none, unless they were classed with the Mycenaean material (Fouilles de Delphes v. 15 no. 7). 26 The best and most recent study is by H.-V. Herrmann 'Werkstitten geometrischer Bronzeplastik', Jdllxxix (1964) 17-71, with full references and documentation. This has at last put the study of Geometric sculpture on a solid metho- dological foundation (see especially his introductory re- marks, pp. 18-2o); but in the absence of any firmly dated examples to serve as anchor-points it is difficult to see what real progress can be made. On the general question of a 'long' or 'short' chronology for the material from Olympia see R. Hampe Gymnasium lxxii (1965) 76-8I and E. Kunze Olympiabericht viii (1967) 219 ff., with a judicious evaluation of the controversy by A. M. Snodgrass in Gnomon xl (1968) 390-I. 27 F. Willemsen, Olympische Forschungen iii, Dreifusskessel von Olympia (Berlin, 1957), gives a complete catalogue and discussion of all examples known up to 1954. He favours a 'long' chronology and makes the preserved series start in the eleventh century. Amandry (Gnomon xxxii (1960) 459-63), noting the scarcity of PG and EG pottery, and indeed of votives of any sort, before the eighth century at the two chief centres, Delphi and Olympia, is sceptical. Note, however, the two clay models from the Kerameikos (PG tomb 4) of the tenth century and the new evidence from Lefkandi-a tripod-mould fragment in a tenth-century context. Tripod-cauldrons must have been made, even if they were neither dedicated nor decorated, throughout the Submycenaean and PG periods. The question is, whether any of the extant examples go back so far. 28 Olympia B 5633 (Olympiabericht viii 218-19, pl. 107.4), probably third quarter of the eighth century, discovered since Willemsen (op. cit. n. 27) wrote.</page><page sequence="7">NARRATIVE ART IN THE GEOMETRIC PERIOD 31 the bull-protome preponderates.29 It is interesting that this change also took place, to a less marked extent, among the terracotta votive animals at the Samian Heraion. Whether this is evidence for the increasing dominance of a horse-owning aristocracy-for only the wealthy could ever have afforded to dedicate such costly objects-I would not like to say. To sum up: by the middle of the eighth century the horse appears regularly and with an increasing degree of stylistic elegance in bronzework; equally commonly, but less elegantly, in the form of terracotta votives; and it is beginning to be at home upon Attic pottery. In all three media it has been depicted, though only recently, with a man (or men) in a generic, timeless relationship. Specific allusion is out of the question, and story-telling an unimagined possibility. (b) The bull As we have just seen, there is evidence which by the standards of the Geometric period is fairly strong for supposing that the bull (a term I use to include the cow) was once in greater favour than the horse, at least as a decorative motif on metalwork. Its head appears not only on the ring-handles, but at least twice as the ending of a functionless short projection on the inside of cast tripod-legs-this projection being presumably the atrophied and formalized rem- nant of a constructional detail appropriate to some obsolete method of manufacture.30 A bull- protome is also found on the outside of one of the legs of the rod-tripod from the Tiryns hoard3s (the other legs bearing goat- or stag-protomes). This tripod was imported from Cyprus, where it was made in the twelfth century B.c., and there are several other examples of ornamental bulls' heads on works produced by the Late Mycenaean bronzesmiths of the island.3z Catling suggests that the origin of this motif may lie on the Greek mainland in earlier Mycenaean metalwork.33 If this is so-and his case is certainly plausible-we may suppose either some continuity of tradition on the mainland, for which the evidence has vanished, or else that the mainland tradition was lost, but was restarted by copying the decoration of the evidently much-prized 29 The following statistics are drawn from Willemsen (op. cit. n. 27) and may be of some interest (pieces from Olym- pia are listed by number alone; the others may easily be tracked down through Willemsen's index): Early, complex-section, handles 7 Bull-protomes (Br 5449, 8721, 9229, 9398, B 1868; Delphi 1946(?), 2998); 2 Birds (Br 1047, 7872); 2 Horses (Br 5471, Ithaca 6b); In addition, I Horse (B 2040) and I Bull (Ithaca 6b) stand inside the handle, on the strap at the base; there is possibly another bull inside Delphi 1946 (BSA xxxv (1934/5) Ioo).

Amongst votive statuettes, the bull is the commonest animal after the horse, both in bronze and in terracotta. Only at Samos has it proved possible to distinguish between the earlier and the later terracottas. There, bulls predominate early, horses late, though there are always substantial numbers of each. At other sanctuaries fine examples of bronze bulls indicate that the animal was not eclipsed by the horse in the later stages of the Geometric period, as seems to have been the case on the ring-handles of the tripod-cauldrons.3s On the pottery, there is a solitary modelled head beside the knob on the lid of a MG pyxis from the Areopagus,36 and one or two of the arched double-handles of the big pots have been decorated so that they recall a horned animal- head of indeterminate species;37 but painted figures of bulls are entirely absent before LG II.38 The case here is very different from that of the horse. In the arts of Greece from Proto- geometric until very nearly the end of Late Geometric, the bull is found only in plastic form, and its popularity, though waning, lasted longest in the least consciously artistic of art-forms, the little votive statuette. There is good reason for this, namely the important place held by the bull in Late Mycenaean cult. Several large wheel-made terracotta statuettes of bulls are known from both Crete and Greece. These may derive from the well-known animal-head rhyta; the earliest of them seem to be of the late thirteenth century, and although the mainland examples die out by the eleventh century, the tradition lived on in Crete and Cyprus.39 In short, the bull appears rather to be a tenacious survivor from an earlier age than a naturally attractive subject for the artists of the ninth and early eighth centuries. (c) The bird The bird is such a common motif on LG pottery that it comes as something of a surprise to discover how recently it had been adopted by the pot-painters. If one leaves that strange and isolated style, Cretan Protogeometric B, out of the reckoning, there is no example earlier than MG II. On the mainland of Greece birds first occur in antithetical pairs (in Attica) or friezes (in Argos); in Crete, at the same time, they are found singly.40 There is at this stage no consistent tradition of drawing them, which confirms that we are not being misled by the accidents of survival. Otherwise, birds occur as votives both in terracotta and bronze, though whether any can be 34 The numerous clay imitations testify to their popu- larity, as does the example found (as an antique) with LG pottery on the Pnyx. See Catling (op. cit. n. 32) 194 no. 6 and 215 f. 35 See the publications listed in n. 25. 36 CVA Athens i, IIIHd pl. 1.9. 37 N. R. Oakeshott, 'Horned-head vase handles', JHS lxxxvi (1966) 114-32, believes that the double-arched handles of the PG and Geometric periods are a stylized continuation of the horned-head handles of the Warrior Vase from Mycenae. Although a second L.H. IIIC example has now come to light (M. R. Popham &amp; L. H. Sackett Excavations at Lefkandi, Euboea, 1964-66 (London, 1968) 20 fig. 38), it is still impossible to tell whether this was normal practice in the period or a flight of individual fancy. What does seem clear is that the potters and painters of Geometric Greece did not usually (pace Oakeshott) treat these double handles zoomorphically, as the rare examples where such treatment is unmistakable show. Double handles can scarcely help suggesting a pair of horns, and one hardly needs to postulate a formalized Mycenaean tradition to explain the appearance of horned-head handles on Cypriot pottery c. 700 B.c. More remarkable, if Oakeshott is right, is the restraint of artists in the intervening period. 38 GGP 69 n. I. 39 Higgins GT I2, I6, 21 pls. 4D, 5A, 5C; R. V. Nicholls BSA lxv (1970) 26 ff. and n.

(d) The deer and the goat These two animals are frequently confused both by LG artists, who had no thought of working from nature, and by others. For this reason I take them together. Sometimes it is possible to distinguish them. The art-deer has more or less straight horns, and a short tail which does not stick up. The alt-goat has wattles (rarely), curved horns, and a sticking-up tail. Any animal with a mixture of these characteristics may appropriately be called an 'antelope', a term without precise zoological significance.43 It is noteworthy that the rare examples of this animal on pottery before the LG period are perfectly distinct. The goat is a monopoly of Cretan painters and restricted to Protogeometric.44 The deer is not met with until MG II. The first Attic examples (PLATE 5b) have the clumsy look of creatures drawn for the first time by a man without the prop of an established schema to help him.45 The deer is in the same rather stiff, head-up pose as the horses of the time, very unlike the grazing or recumbent animal of later painting, whose artistic origins are as different as its physical posture (see pp. 40 ff.). Deer also appear in Argive pottery in MG II.46 In plastic form, there is a vessel in the shape of a stag from a Protogeometric Kerameikos grave.47 Among the votives, the deer is not significant, and when capable of being distinguished as such amongst the Noah's Ark of mis-shapen beasts which have survived the floods of time at Olympia and other sanctuaries, is probably of a later period than the one which now concerns us. The goat and 'antelope' I cannot find at all in Greek art between the end of Protogeometric and the beginning of LG. (e) Other animals The extreme rarity of these confirms the picture that is beginning to emerge of the severely restricted vocabulary of animal forms used by the artists of the Early and Middle Geometric periods. The votive bronzes and terracottas will have to be discounted, partly because they are impossible to date with sufficient accuracy to be of any use in this investigation, partly because they appear to have had no influence at all on any other class of works of art.48 41 There are no terracotta birds of the Geometric period at Delos, Perachora, or Samos. The bronzes have been comprehensively treated by J. Bouzek, 'Die griechisch- geometrischen Bronzev6gel', Eirene vi (1967) I115-39. 42 Olympia Br 1047, 7872 (a pair), B 1946. 43 According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica"I, s.v. BOVIDAE, 'antelope' may be used to describe a number of animals, some of which are deer-like in general appearance; these in fact belong to the family of Bovidae, which is distinct from that of Cervidae to which true deer belong. 44 Fortetsa no. 45, pls. 4, 135; BSA Ivi (1961) pl. II. v (from Knossos); the Mouliana krater (AE 1904 pl. 3) is earlier. The goat appears to have played an important part in Cretan cult: see B. C.

This pot, and the banded amphora with anti- thetical deer in neck-panels found in the same grave, may be by the same hand. The grave was an adult cremation next to the Isis Grave. 46 Argos C33 (see n. 18). 47 Kerameikos iv pl. 26, inv. 641, from grave 39. This has a hollow wheel-made body and seems to be an epigone of the L.M.

Doubtless there are others from sites less conveniently published, but they do not affect the argument. Many of these must be LG, if not later. Also worthy of separate mention are the wheel-made terracotta donkeys or mules carrying jars, probably toys, from Attica and Eretria (BSA lii (1957) 15 pl. 3; Ker pl. 144; Higgins GTpl. 8a; and Agora nos. T 1725, MC 385, and MC 685). D</page><page sequence="10">34 JOHN CARTER In other media, there is a family of pigS49 on the adventurous Louvre pyxis, along with its early horses and deer. An openwork cauldron-handle from Olympiaso carries a barely recogniz- able lion that looks to be at least half pig-clearly the work of a man who had only the faintest idea of the actual appearance of a lion. His model can only have been an art-lion; and there- fore I date this handle after the arrival of art-lions in mainland Greece, the earliest native representative of the species being (if not this very handle) the lion engraved on the catch-plate of one of the Elgin gold fibulae, which are certainly not to be placed before the middle of the ninth century and were most probably made early in the eighth.s5 Earlier than any of the lions are the fish engraved in antithetical pairs either side of a central swastika on the bows of four of the fibulae from Kerameikos Grave 41, about 850.52 In later Geometric art, fish are not un- common; but to the best of my knowledge they only once again occur as a subject in them- selves, and then on a fibula.s3 Otherwise they are always either an appendage to some other figure or object, or else serve simply as filling-ornament. The central swastika of these Keramei- kos fibulae recalls the arrangement of the horses on the Athens EG amphora (see n. 13), and the composition seems rather to reflect an older tradition than to adumbrate the future. Finally, I cannot resist mentioning an unpublished frog which serves as a handle to a pyxis from the Kerameikos, to be dated about 750.54 (f) The ship Few occurrences, but remarkable in that the ship is the only man-made object in the reper- toire. The two earliest are both on fibulae; again, one is from Kerameikos Grave 41, the other from the Elgin collection.55 Only the fore-part of the Kerameikos ship is preserved, with no sign of oars or of human figures. Underneath is a fish. The Elgin ship likewise lacks crew, sail, and oars, but is otherwise a detailed and careful drawing, considering the small space available to the artist. Kirk has christened this kind of representation a 'portrait-ship'.s6 The subject was taken up by the pot-painters of MG II as they tentatively began to admit real objects to their world of abstract decoration. Of the five possible examples of painted ships of this period known to me, four57 are of the portrait type-a simplified, factual, and within its limitations descriptive rendering. This is only to be expected, for these are the characteristics displayed also by con- temporary painted animals. The last of these ships, which like the others must belong to the later stages of MG II, adorns the much-discussed skyphos Eleusis 741.ss58 It is with this that we meet the first signs of the Greek, 49 GGP pl. 4h. so Olympia Br I11340 (Willemsen, op. cit. n. 27, pl. 54; BSA xxxv (I934/5) pl. 24. 4): those who believe in Myce- naean survivals may like to identify this 'lion' as a dog, noting its similarity to the top animal on side A of the wooden chest from Shaft Grave V (AM lv (1930) Beil. 29). I cannot follow Miss Benton in seeing a lion inside a tripod- leg from Olympia (BSA xxxv (1934/5) 95-6 no. 5, fig. 9, pl. 22.2).

The reasons for this interest are beyond the reach of speculation, but they must lie deep in the cultural make-up of the Greek people. An analogous and perhaps not irrelevant question is why the Olympian gods were exclusively anthropomorphic-at least in their funda- mental nature. We can only conclude that we have here evidence of that Greek preoccupation with man and with the here and now which has often been remarked. The central concern of Greek art is with the world of experience, not with that of fantasy. Strange magic, misty horrors, and monstrous beasts are as peripheral to it as they are to Homer.s5 Greek art is descriptive, it represents the actual, and its elaboration brings, not greater decorative intricacy, but the por- trayal of more complex relationships between the figures. Here, on the Eleusis skyphos (PLATE 5C) we see the ingredients of Homeric battle-a ship, its steersman, bowmen, heavy-armed warriors, and corpses. These ingredients are arranged symmetrically rather than logically. On the ship-fight side, the steersman is certainly in his right place; but is the bowman really to be thought of as running lightly along the gunwale between the thole-pins, aiming his shot the while at the passive warrior ahead of him? Is the ship beached, or not? If it is, what is the steersman doing? And if not, where are the two warriors supposed to be in relation to the ship? Simply to ask such questions is to realize how miscon- ceived they are. We have not yet reached a stage of pictorial representation where the juxta- position of objects implies anything at all about their relationship in space or time.60 Each figure is a generic or typical rendering, used like a word in a sentence. All three bowmen on the skyphos have the same stance, clearly our artist's 'bowman' stance, regardless of the action in which they are supposed to be taking part. The steersman is at his oar because that is what identifies him as a steersman. The land-battle on the other side appears to be more realistic; but almost any arrangement of the same figures would be equally realistic. As to the style of the figures, their fluidity, lack of sharpness, and undeveloped stylization fit very well with an early stage in the drawing of the human figure, before any strong tradition had been created or the organic curves of the human body had suffered from the stiffening effects of their geometric surroundings. (g) The human figure With the Eleusis skyphos and the Kerameikos mug (see pp. 28-9) we have already treated two of the six pots known to me which bear human representation before LG I.6i The third is an Argive pyxis where the man is in a separate panel and as experimental as the horses which accompany him (see n. 18). The remaining three are all datable to the second half of the ninth xxxiv (1962) 79; H.-V. Herrmann, Jdllxxix (1964) 69 n. 5; E. Kunze, Olympiabericht viii, 219 n. i6; GGP 26, 28; Schweitzer 37. The skyphos was too often dated, in earlier discussions, without taking into consideration the other pots from the same grave-group. All are unequivocally MG; the two skyphoi 740 and 743 (AJA xliv (1940) pl. 21.2, 3) are very near to those from Agora Grave 12: 17 (Agora viii nos. 261-2, GGP pl. 9 b, c) which Coldstream, though he classes them as LG Ia, says could well be MG II surviving in an LG Ia context. Arguments from the figure style in- volve a priori assumptions and are worthless until some con- sistent pattern of development has been established on other grounds. 59 The whole tale of Odysseus' wanderings, which are themselves only an expanded mise en scine, occupies less space than the stretch of fighting in the Iliad which culmi- nates in the death of Patroclus. 60 For a full discussion, see S. Brunnsiker in OpRom iv (1962) 187-94 (apropos the Pithecusa 'shipwreck' krater). Cf. also H. Marwitz in AuA x (1961) 13 f. 61 I have counted as MG II only two of the five pots listed in GGP 26. I see no reason to date either the Altheim skyphos (on which see also n. 192 below) or the Athens and Toronto stand-fragments earlier than LG. The fifth pot is the New York krater 34.11.2; because of its individuality it is impossible to date this accurately on stylistic grounds (see AHS 268) and I should prefer to fit it into the general line of development sketched in section III below and class it as the work of an individualist who took his ideas but not his style from the two great workshops of the day, those associated with the Dipylon and Hirschfeld Painters.</page><page sequence="12">36 JOHN CARTER century. Two are Cretan Protogeometric B: a pithos with a figure under the handles that clearly represents the Late Minoan goddess with the uplifted arms,62 and must rank as a survival rather than an innovation; and an amphora which seems to imitate an Attic grave-amphora in shape, in sobriety of decoration, and in its frieze with 'its schematic representation of corpses and mourners'.63 I am not so sure that the horizontal figures represent corpses, or are even to be interpreted as lying down, and it is at least possible that we have here another version of the same goddess. But if not, and if the frieze, like the shape, indicates an Attic model, then we must postulate the existence of groups of mourning figures, and very probably a complete prothesis scene, on Attic funerary pots as early as MG I.64 This must remain very uncertain; but there is excellent evidence that it could be so. On the krater from Kerameikos Grave 43 which we have already met in connection with the horse (see p. 28), there stands, in the spandrel above the handle, the figure of a single mourner, 'the first human figure on a Greek vase since Mycenaean times'.65 Exactly as the horses on Protogeo- metric pots were tentative in their placing, so too is the mourner on this krater. The explanation is the same in both cases: we are witnessing the intrusion of a new motif for which traditional schemes of decoration had no place. Whatever the reason for the introduction of the horse may have been, in the case of the human figure it is clear. The gesture of mourning and the fact that the pot served as a grave-marker link the figure with the ritual of burial-a ritual charged with religious solemnity and emotional tension. This quite exceptional decoration is placed, then, in a context of deep feeling. Art, like ritual, gives shape and comprehensibility to events; art, like ritual, externalizes emotion and helps to release it. It is not therefore surprising to find the human form, the most potent of all artistic images, making its first entry into the world of Geometric painting on a grave-krater. In other media, the human figure appears only amongst the votives and on the cauldron- handles. For the votives it is impossible to establish any sort of chronology until the LG period. A few males have exaggerated indications of sex,66 but it would be rash to declare that these are early and infer that the original purpose of the figures was to ensure fertility, this purpose being plainly revealed only in the most primitive examples. This is to argue in a circle from an un- proven assumption. One can only say again that the votives are an autonomous form of art, at least before the mid eighth century, and leave them alone.67 As to the cauldron-handles, the human figure appears to come on the scene as an adjunct to the horse, perhaps as early as the end of the ninth century.68 The Kerameikos mug represents a similar process of development in painting-unless it is simply a case of the painter borrowing a subject from the bronze- worker. 62 Fortetsa no. 1440, pls. 77, 163. 63 Ibid. no. 339, pls. 24, 144. 64 It would be difficult to down-date PGB, making it coexist with, rather than precede, Cretan EG and MG (see BSA lxii (1967) 64 ff.). There are pure PGB groups in tombs, uncontaminated by EG or MG. But even if one made the attempt, 775 would be as late as the end of PGB could possibly go. 6s GGP 21. Ahlberg (PE 261) comments on the icono- graphic link, provided by the gesture of mourning, be- tween Mycenaean and Geometric art. Benson (op. cit. n. I) 94 suggests as well a possible connection with Egyptian art. I would prefer to think that the gesture remained the same in real life, and that the Geometric artist, depicting the practice of his own day and dependent on no artistic tra- dition, inevitably produced a schema similar to that of his Mycenaean predecessors and Egyptian contemporaries. 66 Olympia iv pl. 15.236, 238; pl. 16.240, 241, 246. 67 I take all the bronzes of a more complicated nature showing figures e.g. sitting, driving chariots, playing an instrument, or dancing, to be LG at the earliest. The ring- dance (Olympia iv pl. 16.263; W. Lamb, Greek and Roman Bronzes (London, 1929) pl. I6b; F. Matz, op. cit. n. 21, 84, pl. 24b; Zervos pl. 158; for other examples see Corinth xv. 2, 42 and BCH lxxviii (1954) I8I fig. 41) indeed occurs in Mycenaean art, but there is no reason to suppose a con- nection or date any of the Geometric examples early. They are best explained as a plastic version of a subject which became very popular on LG pots (cf. R. T611e, Friih- griechische Reigentdnze (diss. Waldsassen 1964). 68 JdI lxxix (1964) 45 figs. 28-30.</page><page sequence="13">NARRATIVE ART IN THE GEOMETRIC PERIOD 37 We stand now on the threshold of Late Geometric art, which very quickly attains a richness and diversity of subject hardly to be suspected from examining its antecedents. The previous section has attempted to summarize the representational vocabulary of its protracted chrysalid stage. The subjects are extremely restricted, and their treatment naive. There is no sign of influence from other cultures or of anything more than the dimmest of dim memories from the Mycenaean age. There was, for all practical purposes, a complete hiatus in the tradition of figured decoration in Greece in the first half of the ninth century. From this nadir we have seen an entirely self-contained, matter-of-fact, descriptive art arise. Its subjects are drawn without exception from the world the artists saw around them, and it is just beginning to tackle the problems of depicting complex events that were of importance in the life of their society. There is no sign whatever of any desire to illustrate episodes from mythology, theology, or legend. III This process of development jumps forward rapidly at the opening of LG Ia. The pot which symbolizes the new period, even if it cannot strictly be said to inaugurate it, is the famous grave- amphora Athens 804.69 This carries on one side a panel depicting the prothesis of a dead woman. The corpse lies on a bier, a neatly checked shroud over her. This is lifted at the corners by the leading mourners of each of the two files which face the bier. Underneath are four more mourners, two seated women and two kneeling men. The scene on the reverse70 shows a line of eight mourners, while under the handles are six more, together with birds and other filling- ornament. The details, such as they are, can all be paralleled from the epic.7' The painter of this magnificent amphora, incontestably the finest of all extant Geometric pots, was a great stylist, and he is fittingly called the Dipylon Master. But he is much more than a great stylist, and his achievement was explosive. From one point of view, he may be seen as summing up the Middle Geometric period, binding together in a perfect balance the whole stock of the ornament of that period. From another, he appears as an innovator, expanding the tentative, small-scale figured scenes of his predecessors into massed groupings-more explicit, more detailed, and more impressive. The scene of mourning on Athens 804 is basically nothing more than an expansion of the idea behind the single mourning figure of the Kerameikos krater 1254 (see p. 36). But instead of the single mourner, we have here a representation which is starting to feel its way forward to spatial relationships (see n. 6o). This is much more than an agglomeration of individual figures and objects. Logically, the massing of the figures is unnecessary and conveys no more essential information about the scene than (say) three mourners would have done. The individual units remain hieroglyphs, or typical schemata; but the scene itself is on the way to becoming something more elaborate and less purely con- ventional.72 We are at the point of transition from 'ideographic' presentation to description, or in Gombrich's terms, from the 'what' to the 'how'. The Dipylon Master and his immediate followers developed the funeral theme still further by depicting two other parts of the heroic burial ceremony, the ekphora73 and the procession of horsemen, chariots, and warriors in honour of the dead man.74 But it was not through either of 69 GGP 29 ff.

The ekphora never became popular and was in any case a scene as stiff and solemn as the prothesis itself; while the processional theme, with its repetition of units, tends by its nature toward the condition of a purely decorative frieze. More fruitful was the parallel development of the themes of battle and naval warfare. The battle-scenes of the Dipylon Master and his disciples and imitators are complex and full of violent action. These, too, are expansions of MG subjects, and follow their predecessors as naturally as the prothesis scenes follow the single mourner; but more interesting is the fact that the overwhelming proportion of them occur on the huge kraters serving as grave-markers, which were a speciality of this generation of potters and painters and died out with them. Perhaps this is another aspect of an attitude to life revealed by the contemporary epics of Homer, that is to say a passionate interest in the winning of renown by great deeds. These magnificent kraters can only mark the graves of the Athenian aristocracy of the period. The scenes of fighting must show the sort of activity in which the typical aristocrat indulged during his lifetime.75 They are neither irrelevant adornment, nor illustrations of the epic (see pp. 54 ff.). They are typical scenes, as typical as the funeral cortege. They are drawn, like all the subjects of Geometric art we have so far considered, from the current experience of the society to which the artist belonged. They are generic, non-specific, non-narrative.76 They are not located in time or place, nor is there any temporal sequence within them. They resemble the epic because they are the products of the same society and reflect the same interests and values. These massed figure-scenes, then, appear to be a consistent development of an uncontami- nated native tradition, drawing its subjects from the life of the society whose expression it was. There is nothing very remarkable about it, except for its stern matter-of-factness and its evident interest in the portrayal of scenes of action. Apart from the battle-scenes, its representational vocabulary can be found, in apparently unrelated forms, in the minor arts (particularly the pottery) of the Orient during the previous millennium and more. Bulls, deer, goats, fish, and birds abound on the North Syrian ivories of the ninth and eighth centuries. The pottery of the Levant and Mesopotamia yields bulls, fish, birds, goats, deer, men, and even a ship, the metal- work predominantly quadrupeds and men. (I except the cylinder-seals from consideration: theirs is a separate world.)77 There is no question of Greek art borrowing these motifs from the 75 The frequency of ship-fights in art surely does not mean that this was the commonest form of encounter in this period, nor that the dead man honoured by a ship- krater was a sea-captain. Ships played an important part in early Greek warfare, largely if not entirely as a means of transport for fighting men, so it is scarcely surprising that both the Iliad and the pot-painters give considerable attention to fighting round ships. I cannot share Kirk's belief (BSA xliv (1949) 144-53) that the ship was popular simply because it was an intrinsically geometric and natur- ally attractive subject for the artist. It is noteworthy that so far no Attic figured kraters have been found outside Attica, and only one outside Athens: a fr. from Thorikos with a condensed prothesis-scene of the type found on the New York krater 34.11.2 (Thorikos iii (1965) 43 fig. 49). This could date to MG II. There is also the pedestal of a huge krater in the Eleusis Museum. 76 Contra: F. Chamoux RA xxxiii (1945) 84 f. Ahlberg (PE 285 ff.) believes that the variations occurring within the 'formulaic language' are too many and too important to be explained away as merely stylistic differences and that the scenes have particular and specific reference to the life (and death?) of the deceased. In spite of her detailed ana- lysis I feel that this remains a matter of opinion. 77 IVORIES: M. E. L. Mallowan, Nimrud and its Remains (London, 1966) ii; R. D.

They are the natural subject-matter of an undeveloped type of representational art, and their equivalent may be found all over the world. It is the ordinariness of Greek painting at this time that I wish to emphasize. In the respects in which it extends the decorative repertoire of the minor arts of the East, it merely reflects the technical and material poverty of eighth-century Greece. The ritual scenes of mourning corre- spond to the tomb-paintings and sculptured grave-stelai of more advanced societies, the battle- scenes to the extended commemorative sculpture and painting of the lords of Assyria and Egypt. All are concerned with the rendering of typical rather than unique activity. These subjects contain no hints that they illustrate a story, whether actual or legendary. They had occurred to other people in other places, where nothing much came of them. The kindred Oriental arts, painted pottery, carved ivory, and various sorts of decorative metalwork, never evolved any sort of real narrative.78 Nor did the major arts of that region; for although the Assyrian and Egyptian relief sculptures purport to depict particular events, they do so in an unhistorical way. These scenes of war, conquest, building, and hunting were intended in the first place to glorify and exalt the power of a ruler. They describe the 'what' but not the 'how'. Their concern is with a higher truth than the details of military operations. Rameses II, who got the worst of a drawn battle at Qadesh in 1288 B.C., was not thereby inhibited from having his court sculptors treat it as a testimonial to his own courage and prowess. I do not mean to deny all narrative intent to the sculptured records of the battle;79 none the less, the main purpose of the narrative is to exalt the Pharaoh. The same is true of the Assyrian reliefs. Each town sacked or taken is fresh proof of the invincible strength of the king and his armies. Indi- vidual details of place or costume serve only to distinguish one entry in this visual catalogue from the next. This 'pseudo-narrative' art never went further than the walls of the royal palaces and monuments, and never became an ordinary means of artistic expression. What, then, enabled Greek art to develop in such a fruitful way, when the art of the older civilizations had remained essentially static and generalized? How was it that a specific narra- tive art, depicting unique incidents bound to a particular time and place, grew out of this un- remarkable soil? One part of the answer lies in something I have already mentioned: an interest in the portrayal of violent action. But of itself, this led nowhere. The battle-pictures of the Di- pylon Master and his followers remain as generic, as impersonal, as anything earlier. And they have almost no successors. There are one or two seventh-century ship-fights,80 but essentially the subject drops out of the repertoire of Greek painting before the end of the eighth century, and the massed land-battle all but passes away with the last of the great grave-kraters very soon METAL BOWLS: A.

Attic Late Geometric art is not conventionally regarded as orientalizing; but although orientalizing style, linear motifs, and decorative forms are first clearly apparent in Protocorinthian and Protoattic pottery at the end of the eighth century, there are, as I hope to show, unmistakable and more than superficial traces of oriental influence long before then. Indeed, it is my argument that the later course of Greek art was determined by the influence exerted by oriental objects on Athenian artists living and working in the mid eighth century; and it is to this process that we must now turn. IV Less striking than the massed figure-scenes, but as important to this investigation, is another innovation of the Dipylon Master: the continuous friezes of birds, deer, and goats which adorn many of the potssz produced in his workshop (including the amphora Athens 804). Amandry8s3 has observed that these animals are the only ones which are treated in this way in Greek Geo- metric art, and if one takes him to mean LG I, the generalization is correct. Bird friezes are found 'in all the provinces of Hallstatt art-Greece, central Europe, Italy', and we have seen the beginnings of the native development of the theme on Greek soil in Argos in the MG period (see n. 40); but the other two animals are peculiar to Attica and the Cyclades. Furthermore, deer always graze, goats (or antelopes) are couchant with reverted head. They have no simi- larity to their isolated predecessors, which simply stand, head up, looking stolidly forward. Such a sudden appearance of two fixed, relatively sophisticated iconographic types in a limited area at the same time can only be explained as a borrowing from a neighbouring culture. A further proof, if one were needed, that we are dealing with an imitated art-type and not an animal observed from life is the variation of the details of the borrowed schema. These can be seen on the high-rimmed bowls illustrated on PLATE 6 a, b.84 The animals of the Munich bowl are, without much doubt, goats. But on the Athens bowl they have exchanged horns for ears and one has acquired a downward-pointing tail. It is futile to ask whether they are deer or goats. The anatomical details are of no concern to the artist who has found an exciting, decorative form which exists in its own right and not simply as a description of a known object. Here, evidently, is an autonomous art-type. The history of this type is long, and has recently been elucidated by Amandry (see n. 83). It originated in the third millennium B.C. in the Mesopotamian culture-area, and in the second was particularly frequent on the cylinder-seals of the Syrian region. Levantine models appear to be scarce in the early part of the first millennium, but precious, easily portable, and virtually indestructible objects such as seals may survive for very long stretches of time. There has been found on Greek soil a fifteenth-century Mitannian seal which illustrates the very motif that concerns us (PLATE 6c).85 This was part of the Tiryns hoard, buried not earlier than the twelfth s8 'The battle scenes cease abruptly around 750, at the end of the LG Ia phase.' (GGP 350.) The LG II oenochoai Agora P 4885 and Copenhagen 1628 may be taken to mark the end of the Geometric tradition (Ahlberg, Fighting on Land and Sea in Greek Geometric Art (Stockholm, 1971) figs. 2, 31); then we have two Protocorinthian aryballoi, one from Lechaion (PLATE I 2c), C. 690, the other from Perachora (T. J. Dunbabin, Perachora ii (Oxford, 1962) no. 27), c. 68o. 82 See Davison figs. I, 5, 6, Iob, 19, 20, for examples. 83 P.

Only one such seal, however preserved and however Odyssean its journey from its original homeland, need have come before the eyes of a great artist to stimulate him with its treasury of motifs. Another route by which this art-type could have reached Athens was by way of Iran and Urartu, since it is commoner in the arts of those regions from the ninth to the seventh century than it is in the Levant. However, in spite of the traditional date, so far unconfirmed by archaeology, of 757/6 for the foundation by the Greeks of Trapezus (Trebizond), this Black Sea (or, in a variant theory, Anatolian) route to Greece remains somewhat chimerical; in the absence of any firm proof of its existence I prefer to leave it out of account.86 A third possibility is that pot-painters took as their models the animals which were just starting to appear on con- temporary gold relief work, themselves of oriental origin (see below). The second borrowed motif, the grazing deer, is not so striking, but its home too is in the Orient. It is one of the animals favoured by the ivory-carvers of Phoenicia and Syria in the ninth and eighth centuries, when their workshops supplied vast quantities of luxury furniture and toilet articles to kings and princelings all over Western Asia. The ivories from Samaria and Arslan-Tash (PLATE 8a) include grazing deer amongst their decoration, as do those from Assur and Nimrud.87 The repetition of the same animal in a continuous frieze, though in general not common in the art of these areas, appears on the Samaria fragment. Possibly this treatment inspired Greek artists to handle other motifs similarly, for the frieze does not seem to have been a native Greek tradition: outside the Dipylon Workshop, which was perhaps responsible for pioneering the animal frieze as an element of Geometric pot-ornament, we can see a less adventurous artist copying the new motif, but sticking to the panel presentation that was de rigueur for animals in MG. The Kerameikos krater inv. no. 125588 preserves the traditional placing and treatment of the horse in metopes either side of the handle (cf. the krater Kera- meikos 29o, n. 16 above). Below them, there runs what should be a continuous frieze of the new-fangled deer; but the painter has compromised between old and new by dividing each deer from its neighbours by triglyphs. The closest parallel to the grazing deer of the ivories is not, however, to be found on the pottery, but on the gold bands studied by Ohly.89 These gold bands (PLATE 7), adorned with relief decoration, are a feature of many LG burials, at any rate the wealthier ones. Most have some kind of figured ornament: the earlier ones bear animal friezes, lions and grazing animals; slightly later come human figures, generally being devoured by one or more lions; and finally horses, centaurs, archers, warriors, even a would-be sphinx (on A I7). Since Ohly's book ap- peared, not only has the chronology of Geometric pottery become much less uncertain (thanks to the publication of the Kerameikos material and to Coldstream's comprehensive study), but the number of extant gold bands has been nearly doubled by new finds.9o It appears that the 86 R. D. Barnett, 'Ancient Oriental influences on archaic Greece', The Aegean and the Near East (New York, 1956) 212- 38, makes the case for the north-eastern route; but the Eusebian foundation-dates for Trapezus and Sinope are not above suspicion (JHS lxvi (1946) 72, 82), and none of the exports listed by Barnett need have travelled from Iran by way of the Black Sea. This is not to deny that there was a Black Sea route; but there is no certain evidence for its use as early as the eighth century. H.-V. Herrmann, 'Urartu und Griechenland', JdI lxxxi (1966) 79-141 has demolished the long-established myth of the importance of Urartu as an art-centre (omne ignotum pro magnifico). Mrs. J. M. Birming- ham, 'The overland route across Anatolia', (AS ii (196 1) 185- 95) documents the contacts between Phrygia and the west coast of Anatolia and between Phrygia and points further east; but Herrmann's article removes the linchpin of her argument for the existence of a regular trade-route. As for the metal objects with Iranian affinities from Samos and Lindos, she herself says (192) 'few objects of this Iranian group have so far appeared in central Anatolia'. 87 For the ivories, see the works listed in n. 77, and JHS lxviii (1948) pl.

Before the middle of the eighth century, the impressed or incised designs are exclusively linear: zigzag, herring-bone, maeander, or running spiral. Then suddenly, at almost exactly the same moment9' as the oriental goat and deer poses appear on the pottery, the linear designs give way partly or entirely to animal friezes and to scenes of human and animal combat. The motifs on the early figured bands are entirely oriental. We find not only the goat and the deer, but also the lion pulling down another animal or attacking it from behind-an ancient theme widespread in the art of the Levant at this time and traceable back to Mesopotamia in the third millennium. (This theme is also found in Myce- naean art; but if my remarks about the nature and scope of earlier Geometric art are correct, the theme cannot possibly have survived as a living tradition on Greek soil. If there is any Mycenaean tradition to be discerned in this, or other, subjects of Geometric art, such influence must either have travelled to Syria and Phoenicia and back again, or else be due to the chance finding of Mycenaean objects.) It is beyond doubt that these gold bands were made in Greece-in Athens, and later in Ere- tria: they have not been found outside the immediate vicinity of these places, and the object itself is an indigenous part of Greek culture. The phenomenon is precisely the same as with the pots: in each case, a traditional art form was enlivened by the injection of motifs taken from exotic sources. As with the motifs used by the Dipylon Master, one can make a number of con- jectures about how the actual borrowing took place. There could have been an immigrant Levantine craftsman who quickly adapted his stock-in-trade to local demand, or a Greek who learnt in a Levantine workshop (at Al Mina?) and returned home; another possibility is im- ported matrices, or even imported models (in any material) from which matrices could be made.92 Equal uncertainty surrounds the question whether painter or goldsmith first introduced the new pictorial vocabulary. No figured gold band has a pottery context as early as the first products of the Dipylon Workshop; but a precious object such as a gold band could well be in the owner's possession for many years before accompanying him (or her) to the grave.93 I from Kerameikos, gr. hS o09 (ibid. 40); I from south of Olympieion, Athens (ADelt xviii (1963) Chr 37-8, pl. 37d); 5 from Kriezi St., Athens (AAA i (1968) 23 fig. 5, ADelt xxii (1967) Chr 95, pl. 87a).

Note particularly one of the bands from Kriezi St. (n. 90(b) above) which has animals and was found with MG II/ LG Ia pots. 92 If one agrees with Ohly's view that the matrices were of stone, they could only, at this date, have been produced by a craftsman trained in the east. Much scorn has been poured, for no good reason, on theories which postulate travelling or immigrant workmen. The Greeks themselves had a tradition of wandering smiths, the Telchines (Dio- dorus v. 55, Strabo xiv. 653), and in the Odyssey a smith is one of the recognized wandering professions. But even without such references one could infer that in a primitive economy like that of Geometric Greece new and specialized techniques were unlikely to become established unless a practising exponent of them brought them with him. It seems very likely that the unique series of ivory female statuettes from Dipylon Grave XIII, datable to c. 750 B.c., are to be explained by some such circumstance. The type of figure, nude female with polos, is at home in Syria, but the style is far more Greek-austere, precise, but a little un- gainly-and the maeander of the polos is as near proof as one can ask for that these figures were carved on Greek soil. Ivory carving itself was, of course, a peculiarly Syrian speciality. 93 Ohly (68 ff.) believes that the bands could only have had a funerary purpose, because of their extreme fragility. As J. M. Cook pointed out (Gnomon xxvi (1954) Ixo), contemporary literature, especially Hesiod Theog. 578-84, is against this. It is quite possible that the bands were strengthened in some way, for example by being backed with leather or fabric.</page><page sequence="19">NARRATIVE ART IN THE GEOMETRIC PERIOD 43 Ohly's second group of gold bands (A7-AI in his list), which is little, if at all, removed from the first in date, shows not only the animals already discussed, but the human figure too (PLATE 7b). A helmeted man grapples with a lion which already has his head in its mouth, while a second lion mauls his hindquarters from the other side. There is a clumsiness and uncouthness about the style which indicates that this is no literal borrowing from the East. None the less, the subject is Eastern. The lion, unlike the horse, was not an animal to be seen in Attica. Certainly there were lions in the mountain fastnesses of northern Greece in the fifth century, but there is FIG. I. DETAIL OF BRONZE QUIVER-PLATE FROM FORTETSA (after Fortetsa pl. 169). no reason to suppose that any Attic artist of the Geometric period had ever seen one in the flesh.94 By contrast, we know from the imported bronze bowl from Kerameikos Grave 4295 that art-lions had entered Attica by the mid ninth century, and there are three examples from Crete which may be as early as the start of the eighth century. One is a bronze quiver-plate from Fortetsa96 (FIG. I), showing, between two lions, a warrior who wears a pure Late Hittite helmet, identical to those on the Carchemish reliefs (PLATE 8b). The second is a gold funerary diadem from the Khaniale Tekke tholos,97 impressed with a repeated design in which the pose of man and lion is identical to that on the quiver-plate. Both these works must be the products of Syrian craftsmen.98 The third is another gold plaque, from Fortetsa and on Brock's dating no later than 770, which shows two heraldically opposed rampant lions.99 This, though clearly a piece of oriental iconography, does not look nearly so oriental in style as the other two pieces, and I would be inclined to name its lions, along with those of the Elgin fibula and the Olympia cauldron-handle (see p. 34), as the first of all native Greek examples of the species. 94 See W.

Kunze, in his masterly analysis of them,'00 made the beginning of the series contemporary with the Attic gold bands on grounds of style and subject-matter. At the time he wrote, this was thought to be the late ninth century; but this date (as we have seen above) must now be brought down to the middle of the eighth.o01 The oriental inspiration of much of the decoration of these shields is obvious.0oz Dunbabin,I03 and more recently Boardman,'~4 have put forward the idea that these elaborate votive objects were made by immigrant Oriental bronzeworkers, whose Greek apprentices and successors were responsible for the gradually increasing Greekness of style which can be dis- cerned over the century or so covered by the whole series. This seems to be the most satisfactory account of a phenomenon which had very little effect on the rest of Greek art; for there is no sign of Cretan influence on the mainland in the critical second half of the eighth century. Perhaps much the same thing happened in the case of the Attic gold bands, though in this case the results were very different. An immigrant craftsman (to choose the theory I think most likely) brought with him both a technique and a repertoire of subjects that were new to Greece. But whereas in Crete the seed fell on stony ground, in Athens there existed soil ready to receive it. For in Athens there was already established a native tradition of painting men and animals. Thus the new oriental vocabulary of animal forms functioned as an extension of what was familiar, rather than as an exotic transplant on an alien shore. The lion took longer than the deer to appear on the pottery, perhaps because it was a less familiar animal to the Greeks. But by LG II the lion is becoming increasingly common. On a well-known early LG IIa kantharos in Copenhagen (PLATE 9a), amongst a variety of activities (boxing, dancing, lyre-playing, a sword-fight) which are best explained as being performed in honour of the dead, there appears the incongruous tableau of two lions devouring a warrior.105 Here the fashionable, exotic theme stands illogically alongside others derived from the native tradition of funerary art. On a jug from the KerameikosI06 the lion-pawing-man motif of the gold bands has been fully assimilated by the LG style of painting. And on a very late, perhaps Early Protoattic, kantharos in Athens107 (PLATE 9b), not only have the forms been rendered in complete conformity with contemporary Greek style, but the artist has injected life and a sense of reality into a theme that had been purely decorative. There is here none of the curious passivity with which the deer on the gold bands continue to graze while a lion sinks his teeth into their tail-end. Hampe has emphasized how much this sort of picture has in common with the Homeric lion similes,'8 but in view of the very clear artistic ancestry of the motif, it is surely wrong to see here any deliberate illustration of the epic. The reverse might be true, that the popularity of the lion in art inspired Homer to his favourite comparison; but I should doubt whether that could be demonstrated either. What is common to both Homer and Late Geo- metric art is an interest in the narration of action; and this appears to be a genuinely indigenous quality working on material which may come from within or without. 100 E. Kunze, Kretische Bronzereliefs (Stuttgart, 1931). 1o0 The essential correctness of Kunze's relative dating is confirmed by a fragment of an indisputably Cretan shield discovered at Delphi in a deposit containing Geometric pottery (BCH lxviii/lxix (1944/5) 45-9 pl. 3). Mr. J. N. Coldstream informs me that this pottery is Corinthian, not later than the third quarter of the eighth century. 1oz For a discussion of the oriental models, see H.

Now let us look at a clay tripod-stand from the Kerameikoso,0 (PLATE IOa). Here we find a scene that is quite certainly derived from another work of art and not from the artist's experience. Men do not grapple single-handed with lions- at least, not unless they are Assyrian kings, who can scarcely have been familiar figures in eighth- century Attica. On this tripod, we have a Geometric artist's version of the extremely common oriental theme of the hero subduing a lion.nIo It had already reached Crete, as the Khaniale Tekke plaque shows (see nn. 97-8). Very close to the Kerameikos tripod is an ivory pyxis from Nimrud ~I (PLATE I Oc). A variant of the theme became the royal seal of the Late Assyrian kings."I2 But there is no need to look for any particular extant exemplar. The important thing is the idea, which was then translated into the terms of Greek Geometric art. Gold, bronze, ivory, textiles, sealings-any of these could have carried the motif to Athens, there to be seen and transposed by the Greek painter. If this explanation is correct, we have here another case of the well-known artistic phenome- non of the image whose appearance subsists but whose content is transformed. A celebrated example is the flying Nike, which was interpreted by the Christians as a picture of an angel. The combat on the Kerameikos tripod has been read by some modern scholars as Herakles and the Nemean Lion, and in a sense they are right. Undoubtedly any Greek, if asked who the man was who could grapple with a lion, would have replied 'Herakles'. Homer knows nothing of the Nemean Lion, but it is to Herakles that any such exploit would have been referred in the absence of a specific lion-killing episode associated with any other god or hero. By the time Hesiod's Theogony was compiled, the story of the Nemean Lion existed (Theog. 332). It looks very much as though the story was developed to explain an otherwise meaningless image borrowed from the East. More cautiously, one could say that the image happened to coincide with an already existing story.'13 Whichever view one adopts, the consequences are important. This is the key to the early illustrations of epic. What we have here is an image which refers not to ritual, not to familiar events of pastoral or military life, but to a past legendary world known only through poetry. In other words, the possibility that art could render not only the here and now, the objects and events of day-to-day existence, but the world of imagination and heroic narrative, was presented to the artists of Athens. The connection between Greek art and the epic, so important, as Gombrich has emphasized, in what he calls the 'Greek Revolution', had been made. There is another art-creature which is often spoken of as though it were purely Greek in origin, but whose ancestry is at least in part oriental: I mean the creature with the body of a quadruped and the fore-part of a man. In the Orient, this is generally lion-bodied, and we call 109 Ker pl. 69, inv. 407, isolated find; Schefold pl. 5a; Zervos pl. io8. 110 Particularly relevant are its occurrences on the sculptures of Carchemish (C.

The Greek translation of the idea preferred a horse-body, which we call a centaur. But there were centaurs in the Orient too"l4 (although they were uncommon by comparison with other fantastic hybrids) and one cannot claim that centaurs are purely Greek, in the sense that they are pictures of creatures known by verbal description in Greek mythology. Centaurs in Homer have no horsy attributes whatever, indeed they have no physical attributes at all except bristly hair."s Someone who had never seen a picture of a Centaur would assume on reading Homer's references to them that they were rather rough, uncouth men, backwoods- men unused to razors or strong drink. All this was pointed out a generation ago by Buschor,II&amp; drawing attention to a Protocorinthian aryballos where the centaur must represent the monster Typhoeus; and there is also the seventh-century Boeotian relief pithos where Medusa is in the form of a centaur.'17 Thus there is no case for supposing a literary origin for the LG II centaur, as we see it for instance on a hydria now in Baghdad"8 (PLATE Iob). It took two or three generations before this creature was clearly identified with Homer's Centaurs.'I9 The inference is inevitable that it was an invention of the visual arts, and I think we can see it in course of evolution from the oriental sphinx. On a bowl in AthensI120 (PLATE II b, c) there are (inter alia) two heraldically opposed monsters, described by some as sphinxes, by others as centaurs.'2' Their back legs are undeniably horsy, and they seem to have arms, but they are winged and their heads give the impression of having been drawn by an artist who did not understand what he was copying. It is the wings which make me reluctant to call them centaurs; for although the winged centaur occurs in Near Eastern glyptic (see n. I 14), it is, none the less, a rarity and seems to have been at home rather in Assyria and Babylonia than in those areas of the Levant with which the Greeks were in direct contact at this time. It is more likely that the model for these strange beasts was, in fact, a sphinx-for reasons that will appear in a moment. To revert to the bowl: apart from the monsters, there is a woman(?) seated on a throne with her feet on a footstool, approached by four dancers or adorants whose leader holds a tambourine. Isolated from this group by two flanking Dipylon warriors is a kneeling figure with a harp (or possibly a poorly drawn Syrian lyre) in one hand and a branch in the other. This extraordinary farrago can be explained only in terms of an eclectic and ill-judged re- arrangement (probably at second or third hand) of the figures of a well-known oriental scene. This is the procession to a seated figure (deity or ruler) of which one of the Nimrud ivories once again provides a good examplelz2 (PLATE I Ia). The fully elaborated Syro-Phoenician version of the scene had a whole row of offering-bearers or dancers in front of the seated figure, as on the II4 L. W. King, Babylonian Boundary Stones and Memorial Tablets (London, 1912) pl. 29a (winged, two-headed, with horse-forelegs which end as scorpions); Frankfort, op. cit. n. 5, pls., 3If, 34d (both winged); Porada, op. cit. n. 77, no. 749 (winged); and others. Note that none has the human forelegs which characterize early Greek centaurs. It may be that the comparative unpopularity of the centaur in the Orient was because the horse did not arrive there before the later third millennium B.c., by which time the iconography of monsters had become fairly well fixed.

He notes that centaurs not involved in a situation ('ohne Handlungsbezug') become rare just when 'Handlungsbilder' start to come in, and argues that a change took place in their interpretation. Originally, he thinks, they had the character of a spirit of death (like the sphinx?), but when they became identified with the Cen- taur of myth, they lost their funerary associations, except in the West, where these survived and ultimately reappeared in the art of Rome. 120 NM 784, AMxviii (1893) 113 fig. io; R.

Only eight of these bowls'24 have so far come to light on the Greek mainland, but of this slender total, two carry the scene: one, probably from Sparta,"Z5 is very close to the Idalion bowl; the other, from Olympia,126 has a reduced and dismembered version with added Egyptianizing elements. It is true that neither bowl can be closely dated; but the type was current from Assyria to Etruria from the ninth to the seventh centuries B.c., and one example at least was imported into Athens by the middle of the ninth century to find its resting-place in the Kerameikos cemetery (see n. 95). It is reason- able to assume, in the light of other evidence for increasing Greek contact with the Levant at the time, that such bowls reached Greece in sufficient numbers to become fairly familiar objects by the mid-eighth century. We need hardly look any further to explain our painted pottery bowl. This is no scene of Greek hero-cult, but a mangled piece of Syrian iconography. One might go further, and suggest that the very shape of the pot, which makes a sudden appearance in LG II, is a modification of the traditional skyphos to make it resemble more closely the bronze original.127 But what of the 'sphinxes'? It seems that they must come from the same source. They do, indeed, in their homeland have a tenuous connection with the procession-scene we have just been discussing: on the sarcophagus of Ahiram,I2s the dead king, holding a down-turned lotus flower, sits on a sphinx-throne before an offering-table and a procession; and on the 'Hubbard amphora' (Cypro-Geometric III, probably to be dated after 8oo) z29 we find a strange deforma- tion of the same symbolism, where a seated woman drinking through a tube is waited on by an attendant while a sphinx holds up a lotus in its paw and sniffs at it. But since the scene on our bowl already contains a completely extraneous motif in the shape of the two Dipylon warriors, there is no need to seek out such a connection. It is enough to observe that the sphinx, whether Syrian or Egyptianizing, was one of the commonest animals in the repertory of the workshops which made the bronze bowls. Sphinxes appear on four of the eight bowls from Greece,130 and were obvious candidates for reproduction once the fashion for imitating creatures and scenes from an alien art-world had set in. I doubt if the artist of the Athens bowl had an oriental sphinx in front of him when he painted his curious monsters. Blindness could scarcely go so far. Either he trusted his memory of a creature that was half man and half quadruped, and thus the human part acquired a torso and arms and the quadruped tended towards its most familiar form, the horse; or else he was indeed copying, but at second or third hand when the process of artistic metamorphosis had already 123 H.

What is quite certain is that he did not know what a sphinx looked like, and I strongly suspect that he would not have been able to give any name to the beasts he had just painted. Imported oriental objects carried such, or similar, beings, and he was doing his best to keep up. This was art. not life.131 It may be that our artist knew the centaur, which according to received ideas about the development of Geometric bronze sculpture already existed as a type in the plastic arts. The celebrated group of a helmeted man (or god) grappling with a centaur,'32 now in the Metro- politan Museum, New York, is dated by Kunze133 shortly after the middle of the eighth century, and more cautiously by Herrmann134 about 730-725 B.c. There are echoes of this subject both in a bronze centaur from Olympia, which Herrmann would make its contemporary,'35 and in a similar group in terracotta, now in Athens, whose stylistic naivet6 makes close dating impossible.,36 Whether there is any connection between these three examples and the Late Protogeometric terracotta'37 recently discovered at Lefkandi in Euboea remains extremely doubtful. This has a hollow wheel-made body (with solid legs, human torso, and head) and belongs essentially to a class of L.H. IIIC terracotta figurines of bulls and other animals, which have been found widely distributed on the Greek mainland. The creature's left arm is missing, and it is unfortunately impossible to be sure whether it was carrying a club or branch over the left shoulder, as the centaurs on LG pots so often do. The breakages are consistent with such a pose, but do not prove it. However that may be, this centaur is a remarkable foreshadowing of the LG art-world. The problem is that two centuries lie between, across which there is no sign of any continuity of tradition. It seems more probable that it is a 'sport' on a dying type which belonged to the Helladic epoch, than evidence for the existence so early of a recognized iconography for a mythical beast. As support for this interpretation the 'centaur-askos' from a tenth-century tomb on Cos is relevant.38s This is unique, within its general class, like the Lefkandi centaur; but it is clearly of the type of the L.H. IIIC duck-askoi from Patras, whose shape, Emily Vermeule says, appears 'in every corner of the Aegean where the supposition is that Mycenaean culture lingered on without excessive outside interference, or at least had trade connections'.I39 No-one would argue that the duck-askos represented a legendary being; nor should we ever have read literary associations into these human-headed variants of zoomorphic terracotta types if it had not been for the matching of image and legend which took place in the LG period. Even if this view of the Cos and Lefkandi centaurs be rejected, the fact remains that the sub- ject can only be described as rare in Geometric sculpture, and it was clearly not familiar enough at the time the Athens bowl was painted for the artist to feel that he could simply paint a cen- taur and add wings. He was dithering. He did not recognize or understand the strange beast he was rendering; yet equally he could not call on an established centaur-form to help him out. If this interpretation of the Athens bowl is correct, its creatures ought to lie very early in the sequence of fantastic animals in Greek art. They should be earlier than any sphinxes or winged 13I Note that the sphinx does not occur at all in Homer, either in shape or in name; and Hesiod mentions the creature but does not describe it (Theog. 326f.). H. Walter (AuA x (1961) 63) remarks that it is 'das iussere Kleid, das die Griechen fibernehmen und mit Vorstellungen ihres eigenes Dimonenglaubens fiillen'. 132 E.

Is this so? If we discount, as before, Cretan metalwork140 on the grounds that it is essentially a quite separate phenomenon with negligible influence on the subsequent development of Greek art (see p. 44), it seems that it is. For although the Athens bowl is assigned by Cold- stream'4I to the Workshop of Athens 894, and hence to LG IIb, its context shows that it must lie very early in that period. It came from Dipylon Grave VII, along with two other pots of which one (Athens NM 782) is a pitcher of LG IIa date and the other (Athens NM 783) is a high- rimmed bowl of the orthodox LG I type which does not survive beyond LG IIa. 42 The trans- ition from LG IIa to LG IIb, to which the bowl therefore belongs, is set at about 720 B.C.'43 We may thus conclude that although the New York group and the bronze centaur from Olympia precede the bowl, they do so by at most a decade. In the other media, namely painting and engraved or beaten metalwork, there are no centaurs earlier than the bowl.I44 The same holds true for sphinxes and winged centaurs.45s Yet within twenty years all these beasts become, if not plentiful, at least no great rarities in the vocabulary of Attic artists. It is not my intention to exaggerate the importance of an artistically third-rate piece. It would be wrong to see it as a key link in the chain of transmission of oriental iconography to alien soil. Its fascination is that it allows us to see how the process actually influenced a very ordinary artist; it documents in its vivid and uncouth figures a critical moment in the trans- formation of the subject-matter, and hence of the scope, nature, and purpose, of Greek art. It may stand as a paradigm of how the visual images of an exotic culture were borrowed, trans- formed, and assimilated by the artists of Greece in the second half of the eighth century. Is it too much to suggest that it was such exotic impulses which gave the Greeks (or rather, a Greek) the idea of creating his own monster along the lines of oriental hybrids?I46 Thus the centaur was born, a creature of indeterminate significance that nevertheless survived and drew strength from the ever-increasing current of oriental influence, and was in the end 'matched' with an established part of Greek mythology. For contrast, I conclude this section with an example of an oriental motif which found no matching Greek myth and never gained a foothold in Greek art. This is the figure of the rider who stands (somewhat improbably) on the back of his mount. It occurs on a cast tripod-leg 140 In Kunze's catalogue (see n. Ioo) nos.

On the gold bands centaurs first appear on Ohly's AI9 (Group III), then on A2o and A2oa (Group IV), which were made on the same moulds and of which the latter was found inside the 'Stathatou' amphora (GGP 59 no. 15) and is therefore definitely dated to LG IIb.

The earliest sphinxes on Greek pots are on a fragmentary Argive LG II (late) krater from Tiryns (Nauplia Museum no. 4268, GGP 143), where they are helmeted and sickle-winged; and on an LG IIbjEPA transitional standed bowl (Ker pl. 126, inv. 302), where they are bare-headed and straight-winged. N. Verdhelis (BCH lxxv (1950) 1-37) dates the appearance of the sphinx in Greek art earlier than I do; he places the Ephesus ivories very early, and calls an early seventh-century Argive- influenced krater from Syracuse Corinthian Geometric. For sphinxes on Cretan metalwork, see n. 140; the dating of these remains in dispute, but the examples must certainly span the latter half of the eighth century. 146 See n. I14 for oriental centaurs. It is possible, of course, that one of the very rare seal stones carrying a centaur reached Greece; but since none of the oriental examples has human forelegs, as the Greek centaur does ab initio, and wings are usual, not, as in Greece, excep- tional, the direct copying of an oriental image seems to be excluded. E</page><page sequence="26">50 JOHN CARTER from Olympia,'47 probably of the third quarter of the eighth century (PLATE I 2a). There can be no doubt about the prototype for such a remarkable pose: it can only be the oriental god or goddess who rides standing on the back of a bull or a lion, as portrayed on rock-reliefs, grave- stelai, cylinder-seals (PLATE I2b), and 'lyre-player' seals from the North Syrian culture-area from the tenth to the eighth centuries. The god is Adad, the goddess Ishtar, and the examples are plentiful.148 An early example of its transmission abroad is a Cypriot White-Painted II stemmed bowl (mid ninth century or earlier),'49 where the representation is very similar to that of the Olympia tripod-leg, only rather more plausible: the rider, instead of indulging in a dare- devil balancing-act, is holding on to his mount-though whether to reins or mane is difficult to say. But from Greek lands I know of only one instance in the Geometric period apart from the Olympia tripod-leg, and that is from Crete; furthermore, it is a work so strongly Assyrianizing that it may in fact not be a native work at all, but an import. I refer to the so-called 'tympanon' from the Idaean cave:s50 a bearded god, flanked by a pair of winged human-headed Assyrian genii, brandishes a lion above his head while he steps on to the back of an undersized bull. Here the oriental lineage of the image is patent. It would, however, be inaccurate to say that this motif never again occurred in Greek art. It has a Subgeometric manifestation on an engraved bronze disc from Tegea,'s5 which shows on one side a naked female standing on the back of a quadruped whose hinder parts alone are preserved. The style of the engraving is that of the later Boeotian fibulae and therefore should place the disc in the first half of the seventh century. Later still, and hardly Greek, are a group of lead roundels, perforated for suspension as neck-medallions, which depict a worshipper facing a goddess who wears a polos and stands on a lion. It has been shown that these are to be dated in the second half of the sixth century and originate in Asia Minor.'sz Both the type of object and the motif it bears have very strong Assyrian connections, and it seems that this is a fresh and un- related borrowing of the old oriental type, which, once again, failed to strike roots in the Greek world. What was lacking was any figure of Greek myth or legend to which this unusual image could be referred. Thus propagation failed to take place. VI The argument so far has been intended to demonstrate the following development: first, we have a native artistic vocabulary of a few common animals, simply and singly rendered. Then, in the Middle Geometric period, and particularly towards its end, man and his creation the ship enter the repertoire and lead directly to the representation of actions or events associated with death or battle-in which, if Homer is any guide, there was great interest at the time. But these events remain generalized and typical. Lastly, a strengthening current from the world of oriental art reached Greece and particularly affected Athens. These alien images were soon transplanted and transformed into Greek terms, yet at the same time they invited the Greeks, who knew nothing of their original meaning, to see in some of them illustrations of traditional 147 Olympia B 1665: Willemsen, op. cit. n. 27, pl. 46; Zervos pls. 220, 223. 148 E.

Thus the idea of drawing on the rich stock of epic and legendary events as material for the artist was born. If this argument be accepted, it leads inescapably to the conclusion that there can be no illustrations of myth or legend in Greek art much before the end of LG I; and we should not expect to find a great number of such illustrations before the end of the eighth century. On the other hand, many of the scenes portrayed on Attic pottery from LG Ia onwards have their counterparts in the poetry of Homer--most notably the battle-pictures. It is possible to assert that these scenes are intended as illustrations of the epic; alternatively, one can say that painted and verbal subjects resemble each other because both reflect the same contemporary reality. Hitherto, I have simply assumed the latter; but the time has come to justify this point of view.'53 First, a general point. In the eighteenth book of the Iliad, Homer wishes to describe a shield. This is no ordinary shield, but the cunning work of a divine craftsman, destined to make possible the appearance of Achilles on the battlefield (for the first time in the poem) and permit the climactic resolution of the great epic song. How is Homer to do this? By describing some every- day work of art? By inventing something strange and new? Or by taking something essentially familiar to his listeners and giving it marvellous workmanship, precious material, and heroic dimensions? Surely the last. This great ekphrasis is a classic example of the epic technique of aggrandizement. The technique has its basis in the ordinary world. The scenes on Achilles' shield must be the normal subject-matter of art in Homer's day, but elaborated to the point where they take on a magic life of their own. Many of the germinal motifs-war, dancing, music-making, herding, and lion-hunting-can be paralleled in Late Geometric art,I54 and the others are of essentially the same kind. They are all drawn from the world of everyday experi- ence and reality. The apparent exceptions are Ares, Pallas Athene, and the personifications Eris, Kudoimos, and Ker, who all take part in the battle scene. I say 'apparent', because these deities and powers are an important part of Homeric battle-furniture. Thus a Homeric ek- phrasis of battle will naturally contain them, and we should not be surprised if they have, so to speak, spilled over from the narrative portions of the Iliad. In spite of the presence of these superhuman beings, the battle-scene remains timeless and generic, just like all the others. Hephaistos, marvellous smith though he was, could not anticipate the later development of Greek art. For him, for Homer, and for Homer's audience, the subject-matter of pictorial representation was the here and now. The deeds of gods and heroes, set in a legendary world of the past, were not yet the stuff of art, though soon to be.s55 Let us now pass to those actually-surviving scenes which are alleged to involve identifiable characters from myth or legend. DunbabinI56 listed twelve such scenes (to which one more should now be added) on pots earlier than 700 B.c.; but the list hardly stands up to close examination as we shall see. Of these thirteen, twoI57 involve centaurs (and more could now be added-see n. 144). This subject has already been discussed at sufficient length above (see pp. 45 ff.), but note that the relative frequency of centaurs compared with other legendary subjects, and the purely descriptive way in which they are generally portrayed-either singly or in 153 For what follows, see also K. F. Johansen, The Iliad in Early Greek Art (Copenhagen 1967) 17-25- s54 Many of these motifs can also be matched from Minoan-Mycenaean art, and it may be that the poetic tradition preserved a reminiscence of works such as the Siege Rhyton and the Harvesters' Vase. But the main argument, that for Homer and his audience the essential subject-matter of art was the everyday world, remains un- affected even if this was the case. I55 Matters were very different for the composer of the Hesiodic Scutum, and for Virgil. Is6 Op. cit. n. 103, appendix B, Attic nos. 1-9, Proto- corinthian no. I, Argive nos. 1-2.

The way the figures are arranged makes one think more naturally of a farewell scene, in which the woman is being left behind; but even if one concedes that she is about to be led on board, what is there to show that she is being abducted? Or if she is, that she is Helen? The scene contains not a single feature to link it with the rape of Helen, or any other unique and identifiable event.160 In the absence of any such feature it is difficult to maintain the epic interpretation. We need the support of other, contemporary pictures, which unambiguously depict scenes from the world of epic, before we can be justified in naming these two figures Paris and Helen, or Theseus and Ariadne; but as we shall see, there is no evidence that this is the case. The same objection, namely lack of sufficiently clear identification with the alleged subject- matter, disposes of a 'Herakles and the Stymphalian Birds',16' and of the solitary Corinthian candidate for epic honours, an ill-painted 'Zeus and Hera'.62z The 'Herakles and the Nemean Lion' of the Kerameikos tripod is, as we have seen, a transposed oriental theme (see p. 45). The most convincing of this group is the 'Shipwreck of Odysseus' on an oenochoe in Munich.I63 The ship is upside-down, ten of the crew are in the water holding on to the ship or a companion, and the eleventh is seated firmly astride the keel. Clearly, this could be a generic scene. None of the figures has attributes to distinguish it. But one man seems destined to survive, and the scene presents enough similarity to the essential features of Homer's account of the destruction of Odysseus' ship and his salvation by hanging on to a piece of the keel to make this interpreta- tion at least plausible. This takes us through seven of the thirteen instances with a score of one possible (Odysseus' shipwreck) and six disqualifications. Of the remaining six pots, no fewer than five'64 depict a pair of Siamese twins in combat with a hero, presumably the Molione fighting Nestor as related in Book XI of the Iliad. Certainly the Molione are distinctive enough, one might think. Even so, J. M. CookI65 has advanced powerful objections to the identification: the subject disappears after the Geometric period; the single body with multiplex extremities was already a Geometric convention for horses; and on one of these pots, the krater in New York, the thing appears no fewer than four times, in three of which it is behaving perfectly peaceably. Gudrun Ahlberg'66 thinks that the scenes in which the twin figure appears-mourning, racing or processing in a chariot, and receiving a tripod-cauldron-are intended to be successive and depict the events at the funeral of King Amarynkeus alluded to by Homer (Iliad xxiii. 638 ff.). She points out 8ss So Fittschen Io5f. s59 BM 1899.2-19.1 (GGP 55 no. 4, Davison fig. 98, Schefold pl. 5c, Zervos pl. 123). 160o ... die vorgeschlagene Deutung (viz. as the Rape of Helen) ... wire nur denn sicher, wenn sich annehmen liesse, dass der Frauenraub damals nur noch im Liede vorkam' (F.

This explanation depends on identifying the object the woman holds so prominently in her right hand as the Crown of Light, the attribute of Ariadne in later Greek art. But there is nothing to show that it is not a wreath or garland (as held, for example, by so many of the lead Potnia Theron figures from the shrine of Artemis Orthia at Sparta), which would be very appropriate at a farewell party. 16i Copenhagen, Ny Carlsberg Glyptothek (on loan): F.

One could perhaps argue that, on the contrary, these details indicate the unconven- tionality of the painter and prove that he was prone to experiment. The main weaknesses of her interpretation are that she does not explain satisfactorily why the twin figure occurs twice (successively) in the chariot frieze, nor why this alone of all grave-kraters should depict an epic scene, when all who looked at it would expect it, by analogy with the others, to refer to the present. An ingenious solution of the twin figure has been proposed by Coldstream: that the figure is indeed the Molione, but used by the Neleidai, who claimed to be the descendants of Nestor, as the equivalent of a family crest on their grave-markers.I67 In this case, we can hardly speak of narrative or illustrative art; and these LG I occurrences of an epic theme failed to inspire contemporary artists to paint other distinctive incidents of the same sort. The last item in Dunbabin's list is the clay shield from Tiryns which perhaps depicts a contest of Achilles and Penthesilea.x68 The identification is far from certain, since Penthesilea's femi- ninity is not in the least obvious. But in any case the style of the painting is not Geometric at all, as a comparison with the latest examples of the Argive Geometric figured style illustrated by Courbin will show.'69 The shield must date from the early seventh century, and therefore does not come into question here.170 Thus there is not a single scene from this list which can be certainly claimed as a narrative illustration of an episode or character from the world of myth and legend. However, since Dunbabin wrote, two more pieces have been identified as bearing epic representations. One is a fragment of pottery from the Athenian Agora which seems to show the Death of Astyanax;I71 even if this be conceded (and the identification is far from compelling), the date of the sherd can be little, if at all, before 700. The other is the so-called 'Lambros oenochoe' in the Louvre,172 which bears a complex and distinctive frieze of no less than sixteen figures, of whom one pair are warriors apparently exchanging gifts: a sword, and a belt or similar object. Johansen has argued that we have here an illustration of the exchange of gifts between Hector and Ajax in Book vii of the Iliad;i73 and since he accepts a date of about 750 for the oenochoe and cannot believe that our version of the Iliad existed then, he postulates pre-Homeric epic as the source of the story. On Coldstream's system, the date comes down to about 735, which perhaps makes it slightly easier to see Homer himself as the inspiration of the picture. But Johansen's interpreta- tion is very doubtful. The cornerstone of it is his belief that the object in the hand of one of the figures is a herald's staff, which identifies its bearer as Idaios. It is strange, then, that on the other side of the pot we find an almost exact repetition of the four-figure group of 'Ajax', 'Idaios', corpse, and 'Hector', in which 'Idaios', forsaking all pretence of heraldhood, brandishes his 'sceptre', now unmistakably a spear, in a most unfriendly manner at 'Ajax'. Nor is it easy to see why the warrior behind 'Hector' should be drawing his sword on him at this moment of heroic courtliness. Himmelmann-Wildschiitz has therefore offered a different reading.'74 According to him we have a series of prisoners being disarmed or surrendering on the battle- field-a view perhaps also open to objections of detail, but surely right in its essential 167 GGP 351. 168 BSA xlii (I947) pl.

Turning to media other than pottery, I know of only three images from the eighth century which might bear a literary interpretation. The first is the man-and-centaur group discussed on p. 48, which is surely unlikely, in view of its artistic ancestry as there described, to have been the embodiment of a particular legendary event or even particular legendary beings. The second is a struggle for a tripod between two men, depicted on the leg of a tripod from Olym- pia.'75 Those to whom all tripods are Delphic may like to label the antagonists Apollo and Herakles, but there is nothing in the scene itself to suggest this. It is far more probable that the artist, making a tripod which he knew was likely to become a prize for some athletic contest, decided to ornament it accordingly. The date of the piece is disputed, Kunze and Amandry placing it in the last quarter of the eighth century, Willemsen in the first quarter.176 The general argument of this paper, of course, supports the later date-for which confirmation may perhaps be seen in the lower panel of this same tripod-leg, where two heraldically arranged rampant lions are 'fighting'; such a subject seems to me improbable before c. 750. The third of these non- painted images has been preserved, incredibly, twice over: on a clay sealing we see a warrior carrying the body of another over his shoulder. One copy comes from Samos, the other from Ischia, both impressions being made from the same stone.'77 The pose is that later used, for example on the Frangois Vase, for Ajax bearing the dead Achilles, and in view of its rarity in any other connection it would be perverse to deny the identification here. The date of the stone appears to be late eighth-century. It may be convenient to have the results of this discussion set out in tabular form. The list below, then, gives all works of Geometric art which might depict subjects from Greek myth or legend. I ignore fantastic beasts and centaurs, and Boeotian fibulae (for which see p. 28). I bracket interpretations I consider unlikely, and query those that are probable but not certain.

Some years ago, Webster very ingeniously syggested that the Dipylon shield which appears on these kraters to the exclusion of any other type was in reality long extinct by the time these scenes were painted.'78 The Dipylon shield, he argued, never existed except in art; it was a reminiscence of the Mycenaean figure-of-eight shield; and it was used by Geometric artists to show that they were painting scenes drawn from the epic. This view has recently been supported by Snodgrass in a book which has good claims to be considered an authoritative treatment of its subject,'79 and if it is correct the whole case here presented collapses, since these battle-scenes are amongst the very earliest LG figure-paintings. Several arguments may be deployed in favour of Webster's view. First, there is the fact that Homer's descriptions of fighting and burial coincide in most respects with those depicted on the kraters. Second, it is clear that in later art the 'Boeotian' shield, of which no actual example has ever been found, was used in association with gods and heroes to place them in a legendary context.ISo Third, round bosses with a central spike have been found in tombs of Protogeometric and Geometric date in Athens (and elsewhere). Now the Dipylon shield has no central boss; and therefore the shields to which these spiked bosses belonged were of a different type, presum- ably the single-grip round shield common in the Orient at this time.'8s Fourth, no actual Dipylon shields have ever been found, nor remains of such a kind as would imply their existence. Fifth, the fact that one or two epic scenes are beyond doubt illustrated in LG art makes it reasonable to interpret slightly earlier paintings along the same lines. Let us take these points in order. First, the significance that can be attached to the similarity between Homer's descriptions and the scenes on the pottery depends on one's view of the nature of Homeric poetry. If one believes that the poetry of Homer is the product of a living and changing oral tradition, which reflects on balance more of the facets of contemporary life than of the distant Mycenaean world to which the heroes belonged, the similarity, far from being remarkable, is to be expected. The poet will be describing the kind of battle he and his contem- poraries knew, garnished with a few archaic touches such as bronze swords and Ajax' tower shield to lend a modicum of proper heroic colour. If, on the other hand, one believes that for a number of generations epic bards had forsworn invention and improvisation in favour of the constant iteration of traditional formulae, which will thus have preserved obsolete methods of fighting, then one may concede some force to Webster's argument. The matter is still sub iudice, although perhaps the majority of Homeric scholars would at the moment incline to the former view. Second, the Boeotian shield. It is not (so far as I know) contested that this piece of equipment never existed except in art.18Z It is a conscious anachronism or historical fiction. But every anachronism has to start somewhere. Whether the Boeotian shield was derived from an actually existing Dipylon shield, as K. Friis Johansen believes,'83 or from some reminiscence of the Mycenaean figure-of-eight shield (itself obsolete as a piece of practical gear long before the end of the Mycenaean age),'s4 would make no difference to its value as a heroic indicator in works of art so long as nothing similar had been in use in living memory--Ta ITroX?&amp;, as Thucydides 178 T.

I, Io5), since it conforms with his general ideas about the Mycenaean inspiration of Geo- metric art. For the case against, see also Fittschen 32 f. and Ahlberg (op. cit. n. 81) 59-66. 80so e.g. Exekias' Vatican amphora showing Ajax and Achilles at dice (AHS pl. 62). 181 For a full discussion see Snodgrass, op. cit. n. 179, 37-51. 182 'Boeotian' shields are depicted on the Apadana relief at Persepolis, with a central ornament of very similar type to one found at the Samian Heraion, probably of eighth- or seventh-century date.

Next, the spiked round bosses. Some doubt surrounds these: are they shield-bosses at all? The excavations at Vergina have shown that the examples from there are in fact belt-ornaments;s86 on the other hand the Kaloriziki bosses were definitely not belt-ornaments.'87 Let us, however, proceed on the most unfavourable assumption, namely that most of them are actually shield- bosses. There are two objections that need to be made here. The first is logical: these bosses certainly indicate the existence of non-Dipylon shields in the Geometric period, but what they do not prove is the non-existence of Dipylon shields-at least, not unless one is prepared to argue that the Greeks (unlike, for example, the Assyrians)'88 only ever made use of one type of shield at any one time. The second objection is chronological. Of the eighteen probable shield-bosses from datable contexts listed by Snodgrass,'89 two are sixth-century, twelve are Protogeometric or earlier (amongst which are three from Athens, all Protogeometric), and four are Geometric- two from Crete, one from Cyprus, and one from Athens. Five more have a vague context: three in the eighth century (all from Chauchitza in Macedonia) and two in the sixth. It may be rash to base any argument at all upon such meagre statistics; but if distribution in time and place of these shield-bosses means anything, it is that the type of shield which they adorned was commonest from the twelfth to the tenth century in mainland Greece but remained in favour longer in the outlying areas like Crete, Cyprus, and Macedonia. Of the six reasonably certain examples from the Peloponnese, Attica, and the nearer islands, five are Submycenaean or Protogeometric but only one is Geometric. This is scarcely proof that the round shield with central boss was the current type in Geometric Athens, to the exclusion of the Dipylon shield. On the fourth point we need waste little time. No actual example of a Dipylon shield, we are told, has survived. Nor has one of a Mycenaean figure-of-eight shield, and presumably for the same reason, that both were made entirely of perishable materials.190 Yet no-one doubts that the Mycenaeans did actually use the great figure-of-eight shields depicted on gems and rings, in painting, and in miniature form. There is in fact a curious parallelism in the history of the two types. Both became outmoded by a smaller, more manageable, round shield, yet survived in art. Was this because their sheer size and strangeness made them peculiarly appropriate equipment for the great heroes of bygone days? The fifth and last point raises the question which this whole paper is an attempt to answer: how did epic scenes come to be depicted on the pottery in the first place? I have attempted to describe what I believe happened; but if one accepts that epic poetry was suddenly seized upon by an Athenian artist in the middle of the eighth century B.c. as suitable matter for illustration, one is faced with one of the most extraordinary leaps of the artistic imagination that can ever have been made. That is not to say that it could not have happened: Iroxx " -ra 8sE1V, KOO,8iV avepc1rrcou 8Eiv6-rEpOV -rrEt.I9' But we should at least be aware of how extraordinary it was. 185 i. 21.

They have been heard before, but are none the worse for that. The most obvious objection to the 'heroic' interpretation is that there exist several scenes where the Dipylon shield is pictured alongside round or oblong ones, without any apparent distinction between their bearers being intended.9oz As for the rectangular shield, Snodgrass, though ob- serving that 'the evidence is far less adequate than in the case of the Dipylon shield', is prepared to concede to it the reality he denies to the latter;'93 while Webster says 'it would perhaps be fanciful to see here a mixture of heroes and contemporaries rather than a delight in the changing shapes in the shields of the painter's repertoire'.'94 But would a painter change his shield shapes, at this unsophisticated stage in the history of Greek art, unless real shields also changed their shapes? It may also be regarded as strange that just when unmistakable illustrations of epic do start to appear, in LG II,9s5 the Dipylon shield begins to disappear from Attic painting. Warriors with Dipylon shields linger on into LG IIb, but some of the late examples are so highly stylized as to make one suspect that the real thing was not very familiar to the artist.I96 By LG IIb the round shield has become, with one or two exceptions, the universal equipment of Attic warriors. What is the reason, one may ask, for this decision by Athenian painters that files of warriors are now contemporary, and no longer heroic? As I see it, the Dipylon shield, probably in a much more practical and less exaggerated form than we see it on the pottery,'97 was the common type of shield in Attica in the middle of the eighth century. There was experiment in the second half of the century with other shapes, both round and rectangular. The round shield proved the most satisfactory, and supplanted the other types before the end of the century. Artistic conservatism, the force of a traditional schema for the depiction of the Geometric warrior, will have ensured a rather longer life for the Dipylon shield on the pottery than in real life. Nevertheless, as far as Attica was concerned, the Dipylon shield was an antique by 700 B.C. It was certainly remembered, and perhaps even used, in the metro- politan centres of the mainland in the first decade or so of the seventh century, as witness a Proto- corinthian aryballos from the Lechaion cemetery (PLATE I2C), which shows a scene of combat between a warrior carrying a hoplite shield and three others using the Boeotian or Dipylon type;'98 the date of this is c. 690-680 B.c. The same contrast of shield types can also be seen on an ivory seal from Perachora, depicting a single combat, which is to be dated a few years later than the aryballos. I99 In the peripheral areas of Greece, the old-fashioned shield perhaps lasted longer; the example carried by the impressive bronze figurine (seventh century?) from Kardhitsa is entirely credible in its details (PLATE I2d).200 Thus we must reject Webster's theory, seductive though it is at first sight. The Dipylon shield, we conclude, is not in itself an indicator of the heroic world. With this prop removed, is it still possible to believe in the heroic interpretation of the fighting scenes? Such an interpretation '92 e.g. Altheim skyphos (Robinson Studies ii, pl. Io), round and Dipylon shields; Kerameikos frr. (AA 1963, 643, nos. I, 2, 3, 4); amphora from the Kynosarges cemetery (BSA xii (1905/6) 82 fig. 2a), oblong and Dipylon shields; amphora Markopoulo (Ergon I96o, 35 f. fig. 48 pl. II-I12), round and oblong shields; fr. in Vienna (A 1885, 139-40), round and Dipylon shields; and those listed in BSA 1 (1955) 42 n. 33. '93 Snodgrass (op. cit. n. 179) 61. '94 BSA 1 (1955) 42. x9s See p. 54. 196 e.g. the amphora Louvre CA 1823 (GGP pl. 12c). 197 Cf. the terracotta model in the British Museum, Lorimer (op. cit. n. I84) pl. vii. '9s Snodgrass (op. cit. n. 179) 60 and pl. 15. The only inference, pace Snodgrass, which can safely be made from the way the three 'Dipylo-Boeotian' shields on this lekythos are being handled by their owners is that the artist was not au fait with the finer points of shield-drill. Surely the two leading warriors' shields should have telamones visible? And how does one hold a convex shield at arm's length by a central hand-grip and still manage to carry a spear in the same hand, as these two are doing? r99 Perachora ii. 417 pl. 177 A 35- 200 Zervos, pl.

The argument would then be, presumably, that the pictures were intended to be read as a statement of the ideals to which the dead aspired. Now Ahlberg has recently made a close analysis of all the pictures of prothesis and ekphora, and this has revealed touches of realism and individuality which she believes to be inconsistent with the 'mythic/epic' interpretation.zo Her conclusion on this point is based solely on the internal evidence of the pictures themselves, and it is perfectly in agreement with the external arguments from context and patterns of develop- ment which I have attempted to set out here. Short of summoning an eighth-century Neleid from his grave, the matter is not susceptible of proof, but it seems very much more likely to me that the generalized battle-scenes of the Dipylon kraters, on the one hand, and the long passages describing fighting in the Iliad, on the other, both spring from a contemporary interest in an aspect of life which was of vital importance at the time. Of themselves such scenes and such descriptions would not have led Geometric artists to think of illustrating episodes from the heroic songs which were current in their own day. The necessary external stimulus came from the images of oriental art, which arrived devoid of meaning and demanded explanation. One or two of these images were capable of being interpreted as illustrations of Greek legends; and others of them broadened the narrow vocabulary of Geometric art and helped to free that art quickly from the constricting influence of its simple origins. Thus it was that the Late Geometric period, sloppy and unkempt though many of its products are, was one whose importance to the later history of art in Europe can hardly be exaggerated.
