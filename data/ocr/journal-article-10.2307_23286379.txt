Bloom has hold of something, but his description of it is limited and distorted. Calling himself a self-appointed religious critic, this well-read literary critic argues that there is an American religion and that it is found most centrally in Mormonism and the Southern Baptist Convention. Bloom brashly defines this religion as post-Christian. In doing so, he makes what I consider outrageous and unsupportable statements such as: Mormon ism is "as different from Christianity as Islam is" (p. 116); to Mormons, "Joseph Smith was and is a far more crucial figure than Jesus could be" (p. 123); and both Mormons and Baptists "do not need the Crucifixion, and show little interest in it" (p. 213). Acknowledging himself "an unbelieving Jew of strong Gnostic tendencies" (p. 30), Bloom sees "the American religion" as based on Gnosticism, Enthusiasm (inspiration or emotionalism), and Orphism ("the potential divinity of the elitist self," p. 52). In the fallen "Evening Land of Western culture" (p. 260) that Bloom sees as America, the Gnosticism of the American religion is a belief that something in the self "preceded the created world" and is at peace "when it is alone with an abyss that preceded the world God made" (p. 31). The American impulse is toward "a dangerous and doom-eager freedom: from nature, time, history, community, and other selves" (p. 49)- Gnosticism posits "a vast cosmological emptiness . . . headed by the Demiurge, a deity who created the cosmos, and our bodies and souls, in one blunder ing act that was also a Fall" (p. 50). This, Bloom affirms, has always been "the hidden religion of the United States" (p. 50). Bloom says the American religion began with a great camp meeting at Cane Ridge, Kentucky, in August 1801 that precipitated "a kind of orgiastic individualism" (p. 63) still found in Baptists who walk and talk one-on-one with what Bloom calls "the American Jesus." While devoting six of his sixteen chapters to the individualistic Mormons ("American original") and Baptists, Bloom also discusses elements of the American religion in "rival American originals," Christian Science, Seventh-day Adventism, Jehovah's Witnesses, Pentecostalism, and the New Age. In Bloom's central section on the Mormons, he lauds Joseph Smith as "an authentic religious genius, unique in our national history" (p. 82). This genius is manifest in Joseph Smith's "radical sense of theomorphic patriarchs and anthropomorphic gods," an "authentic return to J, or the Yahwist, the Bible's first author" (p. 83). Uneasy about what he interprets to be Joseph Smith's expanding kingdom of God, Bloom worries about "the surge of Mormon power that is incessant" in a society he considers "dangerously religion-soaked, even religion-mad" (pp. 92, 35). However much Bloom is uneasy about Mormonism, he admires Joseph Smith as surpassing "all Americans, before or since, in the posses sion and expression of what could be called the religion-making imagi</page><page sequence="3">146 Reviews nation" (pp. 96-97). Bloom has hold of something in asserting, "In proportion to his importance and his complexity, Joseph Smith] re mains the least-studied personage, of an undiminished vitality, in our entire national saga" (p. 95). Yet in dismissing the Book of Mormon as scarcely sustaining a full or close reading (p. 86), he misses an opportu nity to see the aesthetics and spirituality of this powerful book. Instead, he looks elsewhere for what he calls "the more mature spiritual specu lations of Joseph Smith" (p. 86)—those he considers intuitions of ele ments censored out of archaic Jewish religion. While Bloom often uses "audacious" in reference to others, the term best describes Bloom's performance in The American Religion. The work is sparsely documented, not allowing evaluation of Bloom's asser tions. Bloom the agnostic provides no validation for his view that "we possess religion... to obscure the truth of our perishing" (p. 29). Bloom the Gnostic is absolutely sure he knows what is hidden from others, yet offers no evidence at all for statements like this: The country's "believers are not at all what they purport to be" (p. 22). While Americans quest for "the unfindable primitive Christian church," what they "actually seek to restore is not the church of the first Christians, but the primal Abyss, named by the ancient Gnostics as both our foremother and our forefa ther" (p. 30). Despite the Mormon understanding that "the god of this world" (2 Cor. 4:4) is the devil, Bloom says Mormons "take Jesus only as another name for the God of this world" (p. 91); they "worship the Demiurge as God" (p. 32). "The American Christ is more an American than he is Christ" (p. 25). "We think we are Christian, but we are not" (p. 37). And, "the current Mormon rhetoric in invoking Jesus Christ does serve as a perhaps deliberate veil behind which a post-Christian religion continues its complex development" (p. 88). While I admire Bloom's skillful use of language, I am disturbed by his rhetorical tricks and fear-mongering. Bloom's initial reference to "bap tism for the dead" becomes "baptizing the dead"—which allows for the damning charge, "How do you therapeutically cleanse or purify the dead?" (p. 119). He sees "a shape darkly emergent ... in the overtly indigenous faiths, of which Mormonism is the most impressive" (p. 35). The Mormons with "spiritual audacity" are "sublimely insane" in their "titanic design" to convert the world Op. 94). And someday soon, Bloom is convinced, "they will be the Established Church of the American West" (p. 263). Besides "audacious," another favorite word for Bloom is "parody." In some respects, The American Religion in itself could be considered a parody. Bloom denies Joseph Smith as a divinely inspired prophet ("Smith's insight could have come only from a remarkably apt reading of the Bible," p. 84; italics mine); Bloom assumes "magical trance-states were involved" in the composition of the Book of Mormon (p. 86). At the same time, Bloom self-righteously sets himself up as a prophet. Calling Emerson, Nietzsche, and Freud "prophetic figures," he says,</page><page sequence="4">Journal of Mormon History 147 "Religious criticism and prophecy are two names for the same activity of the spirit" (p. 38). Given this slant, it fits that the concluding section of this book is entitled, "The American Religion: A Prophecy." Bloom's prophecy is essentially a political one and reveals his prominent bias against those who have brought "the fall of America during these Reagan-Bush years" (p. 231). Throughout the book, Bloom attacks President George Bush as "the American leader most deeply attached to linked emblems of our national religion: the flag and the fetus" (p. 45) and fears "that we will never again see a Democrat in the Presidency during my lifetime" (p. 57-58). Bloom is sure that a "dangerously strong" coalition of American Religionists "guarantee the continued ascendancy of the Reagan-Bush dynasty" (p. 269)—a prophecy now shown to be false. While I remain unpersuaded by most of its main arguments pertain ing to Mormonism, Bloom's The American Religion will be valuable if it prompts others to pay closer attention to what Bloom calls "the religion-making imagination" of Joseph Smith. Besides the latter-day scriptures, a place to begin is in carefully reading the emerging volumes of the Joseph Smith Papers, edited by Dean Jessee. While no man knows Smith's history, his thoughts and life are now more available for serious study. RICHARD DILWORTH RUST is a professor of English at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
