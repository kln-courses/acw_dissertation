(2004). The KARCO tests were carried out with various seat designs. Biomechanical responses were evaluated in speed ranges of 7-12, 13-17, 18-23 and 24-34 mph. For this analysis, all tests with matching yielding and stiff seats and matching occupant size and weight were analyzed for cases without 2nd row occupant interaction. Overall, the test data shows that conventional yielding seats provide a high degree of safety for small to large adult occupants in rear crashes; this data is also consistent with good field performance as found in NASS-CDS. Saczalski et al. 's (2004) predictive model of occupant injury is not correct as there are numerous cases from NASS-CDS that show no or minor injury in the region where serious injury is predicted. This model should not be used to assess injury risks in rear crashes. INTRODUCTION Dr. Kenneth Saczalski and KARCO Engineering have carried out more than 80 rear impact tests involving side-by-side comparisons of front occupants in production and modified seats. The seats are divided into 2 categories: conventional yielding seats and stiff seats, which more directly load the occupant's torso and substantially resist rearward rotation in severe rear impacts. These tests are being used by Saczalski et al. to support their opinion that stiff or unyielding seats provide equivalent or better occupant protection in rear impacts. An objective of this study was to analyze the KARCO tests and evaluate the biomechanical responses of the ATDs in tests with delta Vs of 7-12, 13- 17, 18-23 and 24-34 mph. METHODOLOGY In the last decade, Saczalski et al. (4-11) have discussed test data on ATD responses in rear impacts involving stiff and yielding seats. The tests were carried out by KARCO Engineering. For this paper, original test data was obtained and analyzed, since some of the data was not previously reported in their papers. Table 1 shows the test series available for use in this analysis. The different conditions tested included: Test vehicles: o Ford: Escort, Tempo, Explorer, Aerostar, Bronco o GM: Cadillac Seville, Saturn SLI, Pontiac Grand Am, Oldsmobile Ciera o Mazda: 626 o Chrysler: Plymouth Voyager, Dodge Ram, Dodge Grand Caravan o Nissan: Sentra Delta Vs: 7 to 34 mph Impact Scenarios: Vehicle into pole, vehicle-to- vehicle, sled into barrier, 301 barrier into sled Seats: yielding single recliner, and stiff reinforced single recliner or the Sebring seat with integrated belt restraints Front Occupant Sizes: 5th percentile female weighing 110-116 lbs, 50th percentile male weighing 167-175 lbs, and 50th percentile male ballasted to 238-245 lbs Front Occupant Pelvis: sitting or standing Rear Occupants: Rag doll, CRABI, 3 year old, 6 year old and 5 percentile female Figure 1 shows the process used in the analysis. All tests with matching yielding and stiff seats, matching size and weight ATDs, and without 2nd row seat occupant interaction were evaluated. Second row occupant interaction was not evaluated because the objective of this study was to compare front occupant responses in yielding and stiff seats. No other characterization of the seats was available beyond the general categories of yielding or stiff. 523</page><page sequence="2">Table 1 : Test Data Available for Use in the Analysis.

The test data was then analyzed in delta V ranges: Low: 7 to 1 2 mph Medium: 13 to 17 mph High: 18 to 23 mph Very High: 24 to 34 mph Test Data («ARCO Engineering) Delta-V Range Matched Tests with Stiff &amp; Yielding Seats Without 2nd Row Occupant Interaction Figure 1: Analysis Process Flow Diagram. The delta V ranges were based on the energy levels associated with the various delta Vs assuming a constant vehicle mass. The 10 mph delta V was taken as the reference and the energy ratio was calculated by dividing the square of the delta V by 100. As a result, the low delta Vs have an energy ratio of 0.49-1 .44 with an average of 1 .0; the medium delta Vs have an energy ratio of 1.7-2.9 corresponding to an average of approximately 2.5 times the reference energy; the high delta Vs have a ratio of 3.2-5.3 and an average of approximately 4.0 times the reference energy; and the very high delta Vs have a ratio ranging from 5.8 to 1 1 .6, generally more than 6.0 times the reference energy ratio. For the purposes of this study, the KARCO data has been accepted as presented in their reports and associated data files. This study assumed that the test set-ups were comparable, despite several known deficiencies in the test procedures. Such deficiencies include, for example, using spacing pads under the ATDs in some tests and not in others, reinforcing body structures behind the 2nd row seatback in the area contacted by the ATDs, and the practice of adding weight to a 50th percentile ATD instead of using a 95 percentile dummy. ATD RESPONSES The biomechanical responses in the ATDs included head acceleration, HIC, upper neck compression, tension and shear force, flexion and extension moment, and peak and 3 ms chest acceleration. Since lower neck data was available in only some of the Escort tests, it was not included in the matched test comparison. PELVIS The ATDs were fit with either a sitting or standing pelvis. In this analysis, the effect of the pelvis type was monitored but not further analyzed. The standing pelvis is not intended for use in ATDs seated in a vehicle. Nonetheless, prior studies have determined that the use of a seated ATD utilizing a standing pelvis has little effect on kinematics and neck loading (Prasad et al. 1997). RATIO ANALYSIS OF BIOMECHANICAL RESPONSES The ratio between biomechanical responses of the ATDs in the stiff and yielding seats was calculated based on the same test conditions, vehicle type, occupant type (5th percentile female, 50th percentile male or heavy 50th percentile male) and delta V range. For this study, comparable tests with stiff versus yielding seats allowed a statistical analysis of occupant responses. The following data was analyzed: Low Delta V (Appendix A) 3 comparable tests with the 1996 Ford Escort sled impacted by a standard 301 moving barrier with a crushable face. 8 comparable tests with the 1996 Ford Escort sled towed rearward into a crushable barrier. Medium Delta V (Appendix B) 3 comparable tests with the 1996 Dodge Grand Caravan towed rearward into a crushable barrier. Note: in this test series there were 2 tests carried out with the 5th percentile female in a stiff seat and 1 in a yielding seat. Similarly, there were 2 tests with the 50th percentile heavy male in the stiff seat and 1 in a yielding seat. For ratio comparisons, the average of the 2 stiff seat results was calculated and divided by the yielding seat result. High Delta V (Appendix C) 1 comparable test with the 1994 Saturn sled towed rearward into a crushable barrier. 2 comparable tests with the 1997 Dodge Ram sled towed rearward into a crushable barrier. Verv High Delta V (Appendix D) 2 comparable tests with the 1996 Dodge Grand Caravan sled towed rearward into a crushable barrier. Note: in this test series there were 2 tests carried out with the 50th percentile large male in a yielding seat and 1 in a stiff seat. For ratio comparisons, the stiff seat results were divided by the average of the yielding seat results. • 4 comparable tests with the 1996 Ford Escort buck towed rearward into a crushable barrier. 525</page><page sequence="4">Note: in this test series, there were 2 tests carried out with the 50th percentile heavy male in a stiff seat and 1 in a yielding seat.

T-TEST ANALYSIS A t-test of two samples was used assuming unequal variances to assess the significance of differences in the ratios. The t-test was available in the data analysis tool in Microsoft Excel; two-tail p-values are reported. PREDICTIVE MODEL ANALYSIS Based on the KARCO test data used in this study, Saczalski et al. (2004) published three injury prediction curves, including a curve for front occupants without 2nd row occupant contact in severe rear impacts. Although the same methods could be applied to all three curves, the focus of this paper is the front occupant without 2nd row occupant interaction. This curve consists of a risk function based on: HIC, delta V, and front occupant weight. In deriving the risk curves, Saczalski et al. used only cases where occupants were seriously injured and reconstructed the cases in crash tests. Overall injury rates and individual accident cases from the 1997-2004 NASS-CDS were compared to Saczalski et al. 's injury curve to assess the predictability and field relevancy of the relationship. Individual NASS-CDS cases were selected using the criteria of front occupants with minor injuries in rear impacts with delta Vs above 25 mph and not involving a 2nd row occupant interaction.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The sled and barrier test data shown in Figures 2-5 indicates generally lower biomechanical responses for the upper neck, head, and chest in the yielding seats as compared to the stiff seats at the low and medium delta Vs. The average biomechanical responses measured in these tests represent little or no risk of serious injury. Conventional yielding seats performed statistically better even though they had a lower head restraint height than the stiff seats used for comparison. It is noted that rear impacts with a delta V of 17 mph or less represent nearly 75% of real-world rear impacts with injury and/or property damage (Burnett et al. 2004, Prasad et al. 1997). 528</page><page sequence="7">The sled and barrier test data shown in Figures 6-9 indicates higher biomechanical responses for the head, lower responses for the chest, and a shift in the type of loading to the upper neck in the yielding seats as compared to the stiff seats at high and very high delta Vs. With the exception of the yielding seat HIC, the average biomechanical responses in the high and very high speed delta V ranges were below accepted injury reference values in both seat types, representing little or no risk of serious injury. This indicates low risks for serious injury with production yielding seats, and explains why serious cervical injuries are uncommon in rear impacts, accounting for less then 5% of all cervical injuries in real-world vehicle crashes (Figure 10). The average HIC in the very high speed delta V tests with yielding seats was 1,304. This is above the injury threshold of 1,000. This HIC level is indicative of approximately 40% risk of serious head injury based on the HIC vs injury risk curve in Prasad and Mertz (1985). This predicted high risk of serious head injury is contrary to what is observed in actual accidents and may be a testing artifact. Analysis of NASS-CDS data shows that the rate of real-world MAIS 3+ injury in 25-35 mph delta V rear impacts is less than 2%. This is for injury to any area of the body. Logically, the rate of serious head injury would be lower. All of the matched KARCO tests are reported as being performed with the ATD positioned with a similar head to head restraint distance. This positioning minimizes the effect of head restraint geometry in the comparison. This positioning also does not allow an evaluation of the out-of-position occupant. Due to the variable nature of rear impacts, out-of-position occupants should be considered in evaluating seat performance. Figure 10: Distribution of serious spinal injuries by impact type from Yoganandan et al. (1989). When critical-fatal occupant injury is considered in field accidents, the rate of injury is much lower in rear crashes than other directions of impact. For example, Figure 1 1 shows NASS-CDS accident data on the rate of MAIS 4+ injury in 20-25 mph delta V crashes. For rear impacts, the rate is less than 0.3%, Indicating current vehicles, yielding seats and restraints are performing well in protecting occupants in severe impacts. In contrast, the highest rate of MAIS 4+ injury is in side impacts. It is more than 20 times higher (5.5%) than in rear impacts. Figure 1 1 : Rate of MAIS 4+ injury in front, side and rear impacts of 20-25 mph delta V (Rate = # MAIS 4+ injuries per all occupants exposed in that delta V range). It is unfortunate that lower neck data was not recorded for the majority of the KARCO tests. An evaluation of the lower neck loading is critical to determining cervical injury risks. In order to determine the importance of the missing data, a re-run of a 30 mph KARCO rear impact test was conducted with a stiff seat. The test was conducted using the same stiff seat, same delta V, same seating posture and 50th percentile ATD. Table 2 compares the test results. The magnitude of the lower neck compression measured in this test cannot be ignored. This test helps illustrate why the lower neck loads should be considered in rear impact testing.

The average lower neck responses were higher with the stiff seats than with the conventional yielding seats. Also, lap belt loads were available for some of the matched 529</page><page sequence="8">rear tests. They were generally higher with stiff seats than in yielding seats because of greater rebound. In order to evaluate the Saczalski et al (2004) predictive model of occupant injury for front occupants without 2nd row occupancy, the predictive curve was compared to real world crash data from NASS-CDS. The Saczalski et al. 's (2004) curve in Figure 12 shows 100% serious injury for occupants over 150 lbs in collisions with a delta V above 25 mph. Eight individual cases in NASS-CDS are plotted in Figure 12 comparing real-world cases to Sazcalski et al. 's (2004) curve for front occupant injury without 2nd row occupancy. The NASS-CDS cases are plotted in the region of predicted serious injury, but none of these occupants were seriously injured. This is not an exhaustive comparison to real-world data, but simply an illustration that the injury curve and model are not predictive of actual field crashes. Figure 12: NASS-CDS cases without serious injury in the region where Saczalski et al. (2004) predict serious injury. Analysis of the methodology used by Saczalski et al. (2004) shows there is a need to include injury and non- injury cases when developing injury predictive models, not just serious injury cases from litigation. Furthermore, some of the test data used to reconstruct the cases selected by Sazcalski et al. (2004) may have included artifact responses from the dummies that did not reflect human responses. The variability of real-world rear impacts may make this type of simplistic injury predictive modeling not possible. CONCLUSIONS Dr. Saczalski et al. 's conclusion that stiff seats provide equal or better occupant protection in rear impacts is not supported by the KARCO tests for the following reasons: 1 . On average, the ATDs in the yielding seats had lower biomechanical responses than in the stiff seats in the low and medium delta V tests. Conventional yielding seats performed statistically better even though they had a lower head restraint height than the stiff seats used for comparison. The low and medium speed tests are representative of the majority of real-world rear crashes. 2. On average, the ATDs in the yielding seats had HICs that were unrealistically high in a number of tests at 24- 34 mph. Unknown testing artifacts that created these high values raise questions about the validity of the ATD responses in these tests. However, even with high head loads, the neck injury responses were generally low with respect to tolerance levels for serious injury in the high and very high speed rear impact tests. 3. The lower neck was not instrumented in the majority of the KARCO tests. Evaluating the lower neck is important in assessing the risk of injury in a rear impact. A conclusion based solely on the upper neck, head and chest would provide only a partial view of the occupant response. 4. There was no consideration made for out-of-position occupants in Saczalski et al. 's conclusion. The risk to out-of-position occupants in rear collisions should be considered in judging seat performance. Using the KARCO test data, predictive models were developed by Saczalski et al. (2004) for occupant injury based on crash severity and occupant weight. The predictive model for front occupant injury without interaction with a 2nd row seated occupant is not correct. NASS-CDS data shows real-world cases in the predicted injury region where no serious injury actually occurred with yielding seats. While not shown here, the other models are also not predictive when NASS-CDS cases with uninjured occupants are compared to model predictions. Saczalski et al. 's (2004) predictive models should not be used to assess crash injury risks. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors acknowledge the use and availability of the KARCO Engineering test data for this analysis. Vehicle model year is listed in the Appendices. The seat model year may vary from the vehicle model year. The height adjustment of the head restraint is listed in Appendix A. The height was not available for tests in Appendices B, C and D. Head restraint height was not taken into account in the matched-pair analysis. In the phase 1 low speed tests, the production seat head restraint was in the high position and the stiff seat head restraint was in the mid-position. The height range of the head restraint in the yielding seat was nominally lower than that in the stiff seat. 530</page><page sequence="9">REFERENCES 1. Burnett R, Carter J, Roberts V, Myers B.
