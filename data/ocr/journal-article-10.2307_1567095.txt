<plain_text><page sequence="1">94 Drawing a Conclusion Jeffrey Kipnis</page><page sequence="2">The object of architectural knowledge is architecture itself, as 95 it has been historically constituted. It does not consist of abstract functions, but of concrete forms. Alan Colquhoun, Essays in Architectural Criticism, Oppositions Books . . . we believe that any vital and relevant architecture relies on the prior development of theory. From the introductory editorial to Autonomous Architecture, The Harvard Architecture Review, v. 3 In the field of architecture we have today become accustomed to two distinct endeavors- architecture "itself" and architectural knowl- edge - taking for granted the difference and the relationship between the two. Architecture (itself), it seems, is the act, the art, the event that manifests a history; it is the thing itself, occurring in plastic materials and "concrete forms": drawings, models, buildings, and the like. Architectural knowledge, on the other hand -theory, history, commentary, and so on-consists of the examinations, the investiga- tions of architecture, the analyses from the outside looking in. This work is concerned with, and thus in the field, yet separate from the thing itself. Knowledge, consisting of abstract functions, is manifest (at least) in words, in writing.</page><page sequence="3">This informal brief is submitted simply to introduce a direction of inquiry that makes thematic the relationship between the theory of architecture and architecture itself. We are interested in examining the "self-evident" distinctions that enable (or cause) us to "take for granted" the difference between the two; and interested in why these self-evidencies manifest a hierarchy in the theory-architecture relation- ship such that "any vital and relevant architecture" might rely "on the prior development of theory." In the first of the introductory quotations, Colquhoun uses the criterion of materiality to identify the difference between architecture itself and theory (architectural knowledge): "It does not consist of abstract functions, but of concrete forms." This distinction between the abstract and the concrete (for example, between "curvature" and "a curve") seems obvious, evident beyond question. It appears to boil down, quite naturally, to what is seen (the physical), and what is thought about what is seen (the mental). There is no more necessary circumstance for investigation than everything that "appears quite naturally." We will find reason to scrutinize the "naturalness" of this difference in materiality. Like its nearest modern relative, "theater," the word "theory" comes to us from Greek origins (theoros, "spectator," from thea, "a view- ing") associated with seeing. This root links it with a host of words 96 currently affiliated with mentality that have associations with sight, such as " insight," " speculate," "suspect," "expect," "contemplate," "consider" (from Latin considerare, "to observe the stars carefully"), "discover," and "reflect." Of course we must be reluctant to rely on etymological analysis as anything but intriguing suggestion, innu- endo; after all, the origin of "salary" is salt, as we all know, and we would not take kindly to an erudite employer trying to pay us our salary etymologically (the situation with "wages" would be even worse, its origin being "to promise" !). Nevertheless, since we have temporarily divided "theory" from architecture (itself) on the "natu- ral" basis of the mental from the physical, this physicality implicit in our language of the mental is intriguing and foreshadows the direction of our inquiry. Recently literary theorists have turned their attention to analyzing the figurative and rhetorical language in critical and theoretical discourse. The problem these analysts pose -what self-evident differences gener- ate the distinction between literary and critical writing? - is similar to the one under discussion here. The difference is that they are concerned with one form of writing in relation to another, while we are concerned with one form of writing in relation to something physical, something other than writing- or so it seems. Remarkably, as they scrutinize discourse with the same analytic tools that have been used with success on literature, they find no substantive distinction. Critical writing, philosophy, and theory, all depend on precisely the same</page><page sequence="4">figurative devices so evident in, and so important to, literature: metaphor, metonomy, anthropomorphism, and so on. The distinction between the two -that is, the distinction between truth and fic- tion- rests solely in the reader's response. A reader privileges, less than consciously, certain figurative language with the authority of truthfulness and certain persuasions with the authority of knowledge. This situation will bear a closer look when we turn to the relationship between architecture and theory. It is most important at this point, however, to suggest that all rhetori- cal figures constitute one thing referring to a different thing. The suggestion in the etymology that a certain visibility is congenital to mentality is strengthened by this inescapable dependence of all theory on figures of the thing, on the "visible" object. All arguments depend on invoking objects to be moved around, perused. Using analytic "tools," we "look into" an argument's "foundations," its "grounding." We determine whether it is "substantial" or "insubstantial," "mate- rial" or "immaterial." We "see" if it is "deep" or "shallow. " We "reflect" on how well the examples "reflect" the argument, and we "find" how much "light they shed on" the argument. We first "make" arguments and "discover" principles and then "build" theories from these. In short, an "abstract function" is a kind of "concrete form"; it is architecture that provides many of the metaphors of "objectivity" that enable theory. It almost seems that we are "drawing a conclu- sion," that a vital and relevant theory relies on the prior development 97 of architecture. And that is almost right- almost. In order to finish our "drawing" and bring it to a "conclusion," we should first look at the material of architecture, the "concrete form," if for no other reason than to confirm the visibility of its physical presence. After all, when we have the object in front of our eyes- the "door," the "loggia," the "villa," the "modern skyscraper" - we do not rely on any figurative metaphor to inform us of what we are seeing. Or is the "thing" we are "seeing" already a metaphor? Is the "doorness" of a physical door not actually a response, a reading of that concrete form's relation to other forms? Consequently must we not conclude that there is no such thing as a door but only "doorness" itself, a metaphor written in form, constituted by relations, by differences? There is nothing more "doorful" about a "concrete" door in its relation to a "concrete" wall or to other "concrete doors" than the doorfulness of the "door which opens with the key to understand- ing," the abstract concept of door named by the word "door." One might try to rescue a self-evident distinction between the physical door and the word "door" by arguing that the physical door is "an example of a door," while the word "door" is the name of an abstract concept of door. But this difference between an "example" and a "name" simply reiterates the difference between the physical and the mental that seems to be falling apart before our very eyes. A name,</page><page sequence="5">one might try to argue, is a mental object, it "signs"; an example is a physical object, it "shows." But a name, a word, is as physical as an example, "loop" is as upside down as an upside down door itself. Are not "door,"" " ," and a "real door" all pictures of doors - that is, metaphoric pictures of the metaphor of "doorness"? In short, is not a concrete form a kind of abstract function? Having reached a point of contending that abstract functions are kinds of concrete forms and concrete forms are kinds of abstract functions, can it be still said that the distinction between the physical and mental is really "natural," really self-evident? Can a distinction that does not exist be "natural"? The distinction between theory and architecture itself echoes the Cartesian separation of mind (mental) and body (physical). Cartesian separations ostensibly identify neutral and equivalent bases that completely partition and define a field -that is, the vertical and horizontal axes defining a Euclidean plane. But at the same time violation of that neutrality is implied in such figures of speech as "mind over matter,"" higher intelligence," "backward civilization," and "lower forms of life." The source of these violations is precisely the source of the relationship between theory and architecture that we take for granted -eminent theory distinct from, but governing, vital architecture itself. 98 Since we have argued that the accepted distinction between the mental and the physical has no substance, we must conclude that the presumed "naturalness" of this separation is so obvious and transcendent as to be immune from need of justification. It suggests itself therefore that the dichotomy represents a need, a desire for the relationships the distinction generates. This short reflection does not allow for the arduous task of pursuing that desire and the symptomatic blindness it engenders. A look at another field in which an eminent mind similarly governs a body itself may suggest the ground to be covered in such a pursuit. In Freudian theory the eminent mentality of the superego, arena of the "higher" discourse of communality, of civilization- that is, of relationships- also governs (from super, "above") an id, an it in the physical body itself. The architecture and rhetoric of the Freudian theory of the psyche, with a blindness identical to the one in the theory-architecture dichotomy, both speak to the same desire for which the theory cannot account (though it professes to be the theory of desires), which it can only serve. In light of this discussion, a familiar example of theory preceding architecture -essentialist theory as leading to modern architecture- may be reconsidered. Essentialist theories and aesthetics, minimalism, structuralism, all account for the primacy of a geometric architecture,</page><page sequence="6">an architecture of "essential" form. But what dimension was "mini- mal" in minimalism? What two elements were so excellently close that their difference could be proclaimed minimal? What quantity, what length could be so wretched that the least of it was the ideal? Essentialist theory's tentative answer? Any movement from essence? What, then, is essential about geometric form? If the paradigmatic primitive hut is "close to" a "pure" enclosed volume in one analysis, one system of weights and measures, is it not, in its primitiveness, "close to" a "purity" of no-architecture in another, where distance is measured in terms of movement from pure, essential nature? The minimalism from no-shelter to shelter could then be the least interven- tion possible, a minimal naturalism. And in that system of weights, "pure" geometry, as an entirely mental "idealization" of nature, would be the most distant possible metaphor from "pure" physical nature itself. Minimalism becomes a maximalism of sorts. Rather than finding theory preceding a vital architecture, what we find is a matrix, a web of architectural and literary metaphors, of writing in form and language, devoted to persuading simultaneously both the priority of the mental and the integrity of the physical. Our prelimi- nary drawing, then, is the conclusion that a "theoretical article" is as much a "piece of architecture itself" as an architectural object itself is an article of discourse, of theory. Which, strictly speaking, amounts to saying that there is no "theory of architecture" nor an "architec- ture itself." 99</page></plain_text>
