Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995. xxxviii + 145 pages. Notes to p. 178. Bibl. to p. 186. Index to p. 195. $17.95 paper. Reviewed by Majid Fakhry Abu Nasr al-Farabi (d. A.D. 950) is generally regarded as the first systematic philosopher of Islam and the founder of Islamic Neoplatonism. His two leading predecessors, Abu Yusif Ya'qub al-Kindi (d. ca. A.D. 866) and Abu Bakr Muham- mad Ibn Zakariya al-Razi (d. ca. A.D. 925), were essentially moral philosophers. In addition, al-Farabi was the first genuine political philosopher of Islam and the leading Aristotelian logician, both in the East and the West, during the period separating Anicius Boethius (d. A.D. 520) and Pierre Abelard (d. A.D. 1142), in the West. Al-Farabi was thus a versatile philosopher, and his thought was truly complex. In metaphysics, he was a Neoplatonist of the emanationist type; in logic and ethics he was an Aristotelian; and in politics he was a Platonist. Inevitably, the com- plexity of his thought, not to say his eclecticism, has given rise to serious problems of interpreta- tion. The major thesis of Joshua Parens's well- researched book is that for both Plato and al- Farabi, metaphysics has an ancillary political function; hence the title of his book, Metaphysics as Rhetoric, by which Parens appears to mean metaphysics or rhetoric. The arguments adduced in support of this thesis are not always convinc- ing. Thus, the passage from Aristotle's Metaphys- ics XII, 1074 f.-which is a purely narrative account of the way the ancient astral religion of the Greeks, derived originally from the Babyloni- ans, passed into anthropomorphism in which the cause of "legal and utilitarian expediency" was well served-is used by the author to support his thesis of the ancillary character of metaphysics. In the more specific case of al-Farabi's Sum- mary of Plato's Laws, on which the discussion actually turns, the chief interest is that it is one of the few Platonic texts to have reached us, with any measure of completeness, in Arabic. Learned opinion, however, has tended, since its publica- tion in 1952, to play down al-Farabi's Summary as uninformative or even spurious. For Parens, on the other hand, its chief significance consists in</page><page sequence="2">290 * MIDDLE EAST JOURNAL enabling us to understand "how Farabi read Pla- to's Laws," as Leo Strauss had expressed it in his 1957 article bearing that title.' Both Parens and Strauss appear to hold that al-Farabi's purpose in the Summary is not to expound the Laws, but to reveal Plato's "inten- tions" and his symbolic or secretive method of presentation in that work. Rather than denigrate al-Farabi for omissions of, or deviations from, Plato's text, as some reviewers have done, Parens argues that such omissions or deviations are meaningful and are part of al-Farabi's design to interpret Plato's intentions rather than expound his views. In the process, Parens also attempts to refute the claims of some critics that the Summary is a summary of Claudius Galen's (d. ca. A.D. 200) Synopsis of the Laws, which is no longer extant, or a summary of some other lost summary. Parens does this by comparing al-Farabi's Summary to Plato's Laws "with the utmost care and in the utmost detail" (p. xxxiv). I believe that Parens has achieved this goal and, although highly convo- luted, as he himself admits, the discussion is thorough and informative. With respect to the "metaphysical dogmatism" of Plato and, by analogy, that of al-Farabi, Pa- rens's arguments are not conclusive. That Plato and al-Farabi resorted to dialectical or rhetorical arguments in their discussions of politics is not synonymous with the claim that, for them, meta- physics was reducible to rhetoric or dialectic, and that it served as a propaedeutic to their politics. It is a mark of the great complexity of the thought of both philosophers that they stand out as meta- physical and political philosophers in equal mea- sure. Nor does it follow from the preceding statement that they have no other recourse in their political disquisitions than the use of a "subphi- losophic" mode of discourse called by the author, following Leo Strauss, "philosophic kalam." At least, in the case of al-Farabi, it does not appear that the use of the term kalam and its derivatives in the Summary is connected with the traditional art of kalam, discussed dispassionately in al- Farabi's Enumeration of the Sciences. A partial aim of the author, as spelt out in the introduction and the conclusion, is to rebut Martin 1. cf. Melanges Louis Massignon (Damascus, 1957). Heidegger's (d. A.D. 1976) claim that Plato was the "founder of metaphysics." Accordingly, he distinguishes between two varieties of metaphys- ics, metaphysica generalis (or ontology) and metaphysica specialis (or scholastic theology). For Parens, both Plato and al-Farabi favored the latter variety as a propaedeutic to politics; a corollary of which would be, at least in the case of al-Farabi, the recognition of the primary function of philosophy as political. Leo Strauss had also adumbrated this thesis in his Persecution and the Art of Writing (1952). Now, as I hinted earlier, one need not deny the fundamental political pathos of both philosophers in the attempt to vindicate their equally funda- mental metaphysical pathos. At least in the case of Plato, a decisive argument is the testimony of Aristotle, for whom the core of Platonism was the theory of ideas-the most dogmatic form of metaphysical doctrines we have received from the Greeks, if one were to exclude that of Parmenides, who was Plato's acknowledged master. A cursory perusal of the Metaphysics of Aristotle, starting with Book I and ending with Books XIII and XIV, will show how much of it is an assault on, or critique of, his master's metaphysical doctrine. And if anyone was in a position to understand or assess the views of his teacher of 20 years, that one was unquestionably Aristotle.
