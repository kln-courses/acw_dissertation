<plain_text><page sequence="1">CATHERINE BATES George Turberville and the Painful Art of Falconry In Venerie 1575 or Christopher Hunting and Barker The Booke published of Faulconrie two volumes, or Hauking The , both Noble printed Arte of Venerie or Hunting and The Booke of Faulconrie or Hauking , both printed by Henry Bynneman, lavishly illustrated, translated from then fashion- able French and/or Italian sources, explicitly addressed to a noble readership, both reprinted in 161 1, and frequently found bound together as if to form a single exhaustive compendium on the art of hunting in all its various forms.1 Of the two, only the falconry manual carried the name of its English translator "George Turberuile Gendeman" on the title-page, and for a time some were led to believe that Turberville was responsible for both volumes.2 The translation of Venerie is now gener- ally accepted as being the work of George Gascoigne, but the two writers are sufFiciendy close in outlook and output - and above all in the ways they represent hunting in their poetry and prose - as to justify using the one as a means of introducing the other. On the face of it, everything about Gascoigne's Noble Arte of Venerie speaks to hunting as the acme of aristocratic privilege and masculine performance. Throughout the volume the chase is presented as the ceremonial spectacle whose arcane rituals and specialized vocabulary had, from medieval times, insured that hunting remained the exclusive I. The Booke of Faulconrie (1575) draws on Continental hunting manuals that include Francesco Sforzino da Carcano, I tre libri degli uccelli da rapina (Venice, 1547), Federico Giorgi, Libro di M. Federigo Giorgi, del modo di conoscere I buoni falconi (Vingia, 1547), and Jean de Franchières, La fauconnerie de F. Jan des Franchières, recueillie des livres de M. Martino, Malopin, Michili et Amé Cassiau: avec une autre fauconnerie Guillaume Tardif, plus la vollerie de Messire Arthelouche d'Alagona (Poitiers, 1567). The Noble Arte of Venerie or Hunting (1575) is a translation of the 1573 edition of the popular French manual, La vénerie, by Jacques du Fouilloux, itself an amalgam of medieval treatises, including sections from the fourteenth-century Maître de la Chasse by Gaston de Foix. 2. The case for Gascoigne's authorship of Venerie was made by Jean Robertson, "George Gascoigne and the Noble Arte of Venerie or Hunting," Modern Language Review 37 (1942), 484-85; and by Charles and Ruth Prouty, "George Gascoigne, The Noble Arte of Venerie, and Queen Elizabeth at Kenilworth," in Joseph Quiticy Adams Memorial Studies , ed.

The precise way in which the slaughtered animal should be cut up and its parts distributed, for example, or the proper terms for a beast's age, sex, size, species, parts, droppings, and so on, were all monitored with an exactitude bordering on mania. Throughout the volume, too, the sport is presented as a quintessentially masculine activity; as a test of courage, endurance, and physical strength; and as a pretext for daring and bravado that had from ancient times been celebrated as a symbolic surrogate if not practical training for war. And yet it is within this unlikely context that Gascoigne stages moments that at the very least challenge if not radically undermine the hunt's celebration of muscularity and bloodthirstiness. For within the text Gascoigne inserts four poems - three having no parallel in his French original and the fourth being a free enough translation (and expanded by over thirty per cent) to be treated as more or less authorial - all voiced by the sobbing, suffering victims of the huntsman's sport: namely, a hare, an otter, a fox, and a hart.3 All four poems articulate what, since the early sixteenth century, had become the classic humanist paradox whereby the rabid huntsman appears more savage and bestial than the gentle beast he pursues.4 "Are mindes of men, become so voyde of sense," asks the Hare, for example, "That they can ioye to hurte a harmlesse thing? ... If that be so, I thanke my Maker, than, / For makyng me, a Beast and not a Man" (11. 1-2, 5-6). 5 Men must have their change in venery, the Fox complains, "as first the Hare in Lent, / The Hart in Sommers heate, and me poore Foxe in cold: / But wherto serue these sundry sports, these chases manyfold?" (11. 57-59). This is a very good question, albeit one strangely posed in the midst of a hunting manual. What is the point of all this tearing around and tearing apart, especially when the animal in question is not being killed for food? How 3 . The three new poems are "The Hare, to the Hunter," "The Foxe to the Huntesman," and "The Otters oration." The fourth, "The wofull wordes of the Hart to the Hunter," is a rendering of the Complainte du cerf, a poem written by Jacques du Fouilloux's first editor, Guillaume Bouchet, and included in the 1561 and subsequent editions of La vénerie . Gascoigne extends the latter from ninety-eight to 134 lines. 4. On the development of anti-hunting sentiment in the sixteenth century, see Keith Thomas, Man and the Natural World (Harmondsworth, 1983); Matt Cartmill, A View To a Death in the Morning: Hunting and Nature through History (Cambridge, Mass., 1993)» ch. 5; and Emma Griffin, Blood Sport: Hunting in Britain since 1066 (New Haven, 2007), pp. 85-87. 5.

The question opens up an abyss into which Gascoigne's volume, with all its self-justificatory rhetoric and lovingly detailed attention to the hunter's art, threatens to disappear. A question posed by the Hart is more pointed still, since it calls into question not only the art of hunting but the whole business of writing a hunting manual. "Why arte thou not content, 0 murdryng cruell minde," it asks Gascoigne, "Thy selfe to hunte me so, which arte my foe by kynde, / But that thou must enstruct, with wordes in skilfull writte, / All other men to hunte me eke? O wicked wylie witte" (11. ii- 1 4). The original French poem never calls the writer to account. As an addition of Gascoigne's, this question has the effect, again, of undermining the project in hand and of cancelling the volume it is in, "this busie booke, / A looking Glasse of lessons lewde, wherein all Hunter[s] may looke" (11. 15-16). The presence of these animal poems disturbs the text's otherwise serene discourse of masculine self-congratulation enough to articulate a counter-cultural discourse and to offer an alternative mode of sub- jectivity, one as far removed as possible from that of the masterly male.6 A similar examination of the hunter figure is also evident in the better (if not best) known work of Gascoigne's, the poem "Woodmanship," first published in A Hundreth Sundrie Flowres (1573), in which the scenario of a hunt is again used to present two distinctly different modes of masculinity. This poem offers us the figure of Lord Grey, its direct addressee and a man whom the prefatory prose introduces as the quintessential^ good woodman: a hunter who delighted, "(amongst many other good qualities) in chusing of his winter [that is, female] deare, and killing the same with his bowe."7 Grey exemplifies that skill as a marksman or good shot that had from time immemorial charac- terized the purposeful and successful activity of the heroic male. As a member of the social elite, toward whom Gascoigne's poem directs its none too subtle bid for patronage, Grey is in complete command of the situation: of the land and all the animals on it (over whom he enjoys exclusive rights) no less than over the gaggle of suitors and hangers-on to whom he might or might not "choose" to dispense his 6.

By contrast, the bumbling and hopeless figure of the poem's speaker, one "master Gascoigne," who, notwithstanding the favor Grey has already shown in inviting him to join the hunt and in furnishing him "with a crossebowe," proves manifestly unequal to the task. In spite of "shooting very often, [he] could never hitte any deare, yea and often time he let the heard passe by as though he had not seene them." This embarrassing (and, to Grey, inexplicable) failure prompts the speaker in turn to try to "excuse it in verse," and the poem that follows proceeds with its now famous meditation on the way his marked lack of success on this particular occasion comes to stand for an entire lifetime of bad luck and missed opportunity. Thus the signature trope of shooting "awrie" - which in the course of the poem covers everything from not shooting at all, shooting at the wrong thing, shooting and missing, to identifying with the prey - comes to emblematize the speaker's sorry career to date: a dismal sequence of abortive targets and botched attempts. The poem clearly differentiates between the untroubled hunter such as Grey and his strangely doomed counterpart. And the uncanny tendency of the latter's arrow to swerve or veer away from its intended target suggests that characteristic turning or troping that marks out the field of the perverse. Hence Jonathan Crewe's exceptional reading of this poem as one in which the success of the supposedly "good" woodman in killing the deer is shown, ultimately, to look more like the acting out of a "brutal, gender-coded performance," while the speaker's sympathetic identification with the stricken beast at the poem's close - his "sensitively taking the part of the woman/hunted/other" - begins to look increasingly like a means of developing for the mascu- line subject a quite alternative mode of being.8 il A similar querying of (if not crisis in) the "masterly" male subject is also staged in the representations of hunting and falconry that are to be found within George Turberville's poetry and prose. In his two collections of verse, Epitaphes, Epigrams , Songs and Sonets (1567) and 8.

There are many reasons for considering Gascoigne and Turberville alongside one another. Both belonged to the same literary circle that was centered on the Inns of Court in the 1560s, a coterie that included Richard Edwards, Barnabe Googe, Arthur Broke, Thomas Twynne, and Roger Baynes.10 In their poetic personae, both present themselves as closely bound up with this group: as involved in the same homosocial literary exchange, and as offering the services of their pen by writing love poems at the request of their friends. The two almost certainly knew each other, both translating works by Italian writers as part of the then fashionable Italian revival, and both sharing in their own poetic output a common repertoire of metaphors, motifs, and ideas. In his literary self-presentation Turberville is as assiduous in casting himself as the gentleman amateur whose poems are trifles and whose inadequacies, according to the regulation modesty topos, oblige him to choose "light" over serious verse: "I write but of familiar stuffe," he avows in "The Authors Epilogue" (the penultimate poem of his Epitaphes and Son- nettes), "because my stile is lowe" (fol. I97v). In the prefatory poem that introduces the Tragicall tales, Turberville explains that, since he lacked the wit to translate Lucan's Civil War as he had originally intended, he instead "to reading Boccas fell, and sundrie other moe / Italian Authours" (fol. 11). In light of Ascham's attack on Italian "bawdy books," his ensuing translations of novelle from Boccaccio, Bandello, and others were no less provocative than Gascoigne's re-presentation of The Adventures of Master E J. in the 1575 Posies as an Italianate "riding tale."11 Moreover, Turberville justifies his literary decision to aim low rather than high here by means of a familiar metaphor: "Not euery woodman that doth shoote, hath skill to chose his Deere." (fol. 8v). In the opinion of 9. The only extant edition of the Tragicall Tales is dated 1587, but John Erskine Hankins postulates the existence of an earlier edition dated c. 1574, in The Life and Works of George Turbervile (Lawrence, Kan., 1940), pp. 36-37. 10. Turberville was at the Inns of Court in 1562, although he was probably enrolled in one of the subsidiary Inns of Chancery since his name does not appear on the registers of any of the four main Inns (Hankins, p. 7). Gascoigne was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1555 and returned there in 1564 or 1565. ii. Roger Ascham, The Schoolmaster (1570), ed. Lawrence V.

Instead, she instructs him to stick to lighter material, as he had already done in his translations of Mantuan's Eclogues and Ovid's Heroides , both published in 1567. Turberville duly bows at the Muse's behest: he will not be offering his readers anything that has pretensions to be serious or "high" literature. The imagery of the hunt is ubiquitous throughout Turbeville's verse, where it mobilizes themes that are for the most part highly familiar. Hunting is invoked in wholly traditional terms as the activity that had from ancient times been seen to embody vigor and manliness. In a poem modelled on Wyatt's "Myne owne John Poyntz," for example, the town-bound speaker conjures hunting as the apogee of the whole- some country life, where taking prey with his hounds or slaying "with Haukes the sielie Foule" allows his friend to "practise warre." Such exertions promote rigorous exercise in the approved manly fashion, much as Wyatt's speaker had preferred "to hounte and hawke" rather than be compromised by the sycophantic and effeminate life of the city and court.12 Hunting is similarly invoked as the age-old metaphor for the sexual chase, so that for the speaker to pursue a woman with whom he is unacquainted is to "pursue a Game vnknowne" ( EESS , fol. 48), or for his still unmarried friend to pursue women is "to beat the bush, / Where beauties birds do lodge," and to "shoote" or "bend your bowes" at them.13 In the same way hunting suggests itself to Turberville as the obvious metaphor for the bold, purposeful, and instrumental behavior of the male role-model. As he tells another male friend in "Spare to speake, Spare to speede:" The fisherman that feares his corke and coard to cast, Or spřed his net to take the fish, wel worthy is to fast. The forestman that dreads to rouse the lodged Bucke, Bicause of bramble brakes, deserues to haue no hunters lucke . . . Vnlesse thou cast thy lure, or throw hir out a traine: Thou seldome shalt a Falcon, or a Tassell gentle gaine (ES, fol. 154V) 12.

In every case, however, the manliness of the hunter figure that is gestured at and appealed to in these poems is undermined, reversed, or put in doubt. Thus the apparent wholesomeness of the envied friend's "Countrie sportes" ( EESS , fol. 80) is no less unproblematic than was the speaker's enforced rustication in Wyatt's "Myne owne John Poyntz." The lover who requests Cupid's help to pursue the "Game vnknowne" ends up, in another poem, requesting his permission "to quite renownce his game" ( EESS , fol. 104.v), and the young man who beats the bush and shoots the "birds" in fact demonstrates only his "feeble strengths" (EESS, fol. 194.v) because he has not yet caught - that is, married - one. In "Spare to speake, Spare to speede," although it exhorts the addressee to behave "like a man," the list of counter- examples in fact serves to up precisely the opposite, namely that the friend in question is a fearful fisherman, a fretful forester, and a feeble falconer. It would be fair to say, in fact, that in Turberville's poetry hunting (in its various aspects) is invariably used to cast the male subject as ineffective or useless. In time-honored fashion, he is pre- sented as either the hunted - the quarry or prey of Love or of rapa- cious women - or as the hunter who comes away from the chase unsuccessful and empty-handed. Turberville routinely figures his male lovers as baited fish or snared birds: "I am the fish, you are the flood," the lover tells his mistress in one poem, "my heart it is that hangs on hooke" (ES, fol. i49v)."Now hang abroade thy hookes," he begs her in another poem, "bestowe thy baytes elsewhere" (ES, fol. 165). In "The Authors excuse," the supposedly reformed speaker claims to deplore the fact that men . . . did seeke their owne mishap, And hunted dayly to deuoure the hookes, That beuty bayted, and were caught in trap, Like wilfull wights that fed on womens lookes, Who being once entangled in the line, Did yelde themselues and were content to pine (ES, fol. 199V) © 201 1 English Literary Renaissance Inc.</page><page sequence="8">410 English Literary Renaissance In the poem "To his friend T" he warns his friend against such female prédation: "Thou art the Fish, she beares the byting hookes" ( EESS , fol. 77). It is women who are the successful hunter-figures here, of course, and as such they are sometimes explicitly gendered as male: "As Shepheards" that catch a fox or as the "Boy" that catches birds, "So wily Women woont to laugh" (EESS, fol. 6ov) when they catch their man. When a male figure is explicitly described as "fishing" for a woman, it becomes a matter of debate - a formal "controuersie . . . twixt Fortune and Venus" - whether the man "kest his line" and so caught the woman or whether in fact she "kest hir looke" upon, and so caught, him (EESS, fol. Ó2v). No less routine are Turberville's presentations of the male lover as a failed or thwarted huntsman: "The Fish is scapte, and here remaines the Net" (EESS, fol. 64V), he complains in one poem. In another, "I too blame as many foulers bee: / Who had the bird in hand and let her flee" (ES, fol. 167V). The poet's own lover-persona is quite as fearful a fisherman or feeble a forester as that of the unmanly friend whom he tries to chivvy in "Spare to speake, Spare to speede ." Just as the latter is warned that he might never catch his woman - for "Vnlesse thou cast thy lure, or throw hir out a traine: / Thou seldome shalt a Falcon, or a Tassell gende gaine" - so Turberville frequently casts his own poetic "I" as an unskilled falconer: as a figure, that is, whose ability to hawk successfully - an integral part of the good hunter's repertoire and skill set - falls seriously short of the mark. in To develop the discussion further, let me shift the focus to the imagery of hawking as it appears in Turberville's hunting manual and in a number of what might be called his "falcon" poems. To begin with, as Turberville puts it in the Booke of Faulconrie, "the female of all byrdes of praye and rauyne, is euer more huge than the male, more ventrous, hardie, and watchfull" ("of suche byrdes as do not liue by rauyne and pray," he adds, "the male is more large than the female") [fol. 3]. The female raptor can be up to three times the body weight and wingspan of the male bird, which is named a "tiercel" possibly for that reason.14 14. As discussed by Robin S. Oggins, The Kings and Their Hawks: Falconry in Medieval England (New Haven, 2004), p. 12.

Except for those occasions where he is making specific reference to the tiercel, Turberville invariably refers to birds as "she" in his treatise. Eagles and falcons, for example - since they rank higher than hawks in the raptor pecking order - are both described as "Queenefs]" (fols. 24, 2 1 2). 15 By comparison, male birds are treated very sniffily: "The Gos- hawke is euer more regarded than hyrTiercell, for the males, or cockes among Hawkes and byrdes of praye, do make euident proofe and shew to the eye, of their difference from the femáis and Hawkes" (fol. 63). Similarly, the female merlin "onely will proue good" for flying at partridge, "in trayning or making the lacke, you should but loose your time" (fol. 170), while a goshawk "but no Tercell" (fol. 191) might successfully be flown at game. This specific gendering - unique to falconry - has an obvious bearing on the use of the sport as a metaphor for love, for the sexual chase, and for relations between male and female more generally. By way of illustration, one might compare the way in which other animal auxil- iaries such as horses and dogs have been treated in similar metaphors. While there are numerous examples of poems in which the male lover presents himself as a dog (usually spurned or fawning) or as a horse (usually spurred and beaten), there are infinitely fewer in which he presents his mistress as such.16 Since a falcon or hawk, by contrast, is by default a female of the species, "she" frequently maps on to the figure of gyrfalcons, peregrine falcons (often known as "falcons gentle"), lanners, sakers, merlins, gos- hawks, and sparrow hawks, see Oggins, pp. 12-15. Turberville offers an alternative etymology for "tiercel," suggesting that the male bird was so called because "there are most commonly disclosed three byrdes in one selfe eyree [nest], two Hawkes, and one Tiercell," toward Faulconrie , fol. 59. 15. It should be noted that the production of eggs is considered to be a highly undesirable event, and Turberville gives detailed instructions on how to remove unwanted eggs from the body of the female bird before they are laid (see fols. 269-71, 357- 5 8). The falconer's attitude toward this reproductive aspect of his female birds is powerfully conveyed in his language: "when Hawkes fall to laying egges, and to be with egge in the mewe ... in verie deede this is a great mischiefe" (fol. 269); removing the said eggs will "discharge thy hawke of this mischiefe, and bring hir to be in perfite state againe" (fol. 271). 16. The only exception that I know of is Fulke Greville's extraordinary poem Caelica II which addresses the mistress as "Faire Dog, which so my heart dost teare asunder," Poems and Dramas of Fulke Greville, First Lord Brooke , ed.

For them, "natural selection for the long-term survival of the species" has in effect been replaced by "artificial selection whose goal is to gratify human economic, social, cultural, or aesthetic needs." By contrast, a trained falcon or hawk is tame: it is "still a member of a wild species that has as an individual been behaviorally adapted to tolerate the proximity of man."18 The element of control is quite different. There is no question of breeding domesticated raptors: each bird has to be individually captured and trained up from the wild, a state to which it could (and often did) revert.The suggestiveness of this scenario, in which a male keeper painstakingly (and not always successfully) trains a wild female creature to obey his commands, was to prove irresistible to the poets of the period, with the result that the specialized language of falconry - as a distinct category within the larger vocabulary and imagery of the hunt in general - has a very special part to play in their depictions of love, the chase, and sexual relations. That falconry involved a specifically gendered relation is everywhere apparent in the sport's language and vocabulary. To train a hawk or falcon, for example, was to "man" her, and the OED cites Turberville's treatise as the first to introduce this sense of the verb into English, his typical phrase being "to make and man" the bird. The word probably derived from the French, main , since the first part of the training involved conditioning the bird to stand on her keeper's gloved hand. Nevertheless, the gendering implicit in the English verb proved irresist- ible to the sixteenth-century male mind and, as such, it quickly entered the language as an all too apt metaphor for the figuring of male-female relations. Petruchio, for example, to cite one very well known case, describes the taming of Kate in just such terms: "Another way I have to man my haggard, / To make her come and know her keeper's call."19 17.

A bird normally had a single keeper who gave her a name and trained her to respond to him alone (and to his voice, in particular). The training involved up to a year of intensive contact, with the falconer carrying his bird around in a darkened chamber for up to twenty-four hours at a time, keeping her in his bedroom at night and close to his bed while he slept, singing softly and cooing to her, stroking and caressing her, bathing her and spraying her gently with mouthfuls of water to cool her, feeding her, rewarding her with cinnamon and sugar-candy when she was good, and depriving her of food when she was not. As Thomas Alisen puts it, "in all cases, the key is what we now call conditioned reflex, a series of punishments and rewards to progressively modify behavior in desired ways."20 The most desired outcome was the establishment of a close bond between the bird and her keeper, and in his treatise Turberville fre- quently resorts to the language of love and courtesy in order to describe this relation in its ideal form: "vnlesse they [goshawks] be firste fonde of the keeper, and in loue with the call, they will not flee their game to the likyng of their owner" (fol. 62); "it is necessarie for him [the falconer] to bee fonde ouer his hawke" (fol. 76); the white falcon "is very gentle . . . and loueth hir keeper better" (fol. 87); the sparrow hawk should "loue hir keepers fiste, and his countenaunce" (fol. 93); falconers "must take greate heede that they offend them [haggard falcons] not, but rather coye [stroke, pat, or caress] them as much as they can with all deuises of fauor &amp; cherishing" (fol. 204); you should make your sparrow hawk "loue you and be fonde of you" (fol. 209). The fullest account of this ideal "love" relation between a keeper and his bird is to be found in the following insertion that Turberville adds to the French and Italian source texts he is otherwise following: And here I thinke good to expresse myne opinion, that hee whiche taketh in hande to bee a Falconer, ought fyrste to bee verye pacient, and therewythall to take syngular delyght in an Hawke, so that hee may seeme to bee in loue (as it were naturally) with his Hawke, euen that a the play. Patricia B. Phillippy argues that Shakespeare draws on Turberville's Booke of Faulconrie in his extensive use of such motifs in this play: "'Loytering in Love': Ovid's Heroides , Hospitality, and Humanist Education in The Taming of the Shrew Criticism 40 (1998), 27-53. 20.

Falconry had always been a noble sport and Turberville's treatise addresses itself to "Noble- men and Gentlemen" on its title-page quite as clearly as Gascoigne's Venerie does. In order to qualify as an "excellent," "perfecte," or "right Falconer," a man needed to be refined and courtly. He must be "curteous and full of patience" (fol. 42), he must deal with his bird "curteousely" (fol. 103), "as gently and as amiably as you can deuise" (fol. 134), and under no circumstances be "chollerique" (fol. 207) or lose his temper with her. Above all, he must love her with the "naturall instinct" that Turberville rather beautifully describes, for there is no surer sign of a bad falconer than that he makes "slender regarde" of his bird (fol. 217). To do that, or to fail to take the proper "delyght" in her, is to condemn oneself to the status of the mere peasant who hunts not for sport but for food, or, worse still, to that of the servant who is worthy only to carry the bag of game that his more noble master has caught (the rather wonderful "marrehawk" is, again according to the OED , a nonceword of Turberville's own invention). In its optimum form, then, the ideal relation between the "good falconer" (fol. 75) and his bird is very much like that between the courtly lover and his lady. As John Cummins writes, "the bird of prey's characteristics of physical beauty and independence of mind enable falconry practices to serve, as symbol or in simile, to express the emotional and physical attractiveness of woman to man."21 When describing the faithful few who remain loyal when all others are busy forsaking him, it is the close relationship between the falconer and his 21.

Thus, the "good hawk" is of "gentle and curteous condition and fashions" (fol. 26); "for one good vsage [she] will shewe a treble curtesie" (fol. 48); she will "be familiar with the man without any straungnesse or coynesse" (fol. 129). This ideal scenario of mutual "courtesy," however, is all too often not achieved, and scenes in which the courdy falconer cherishes his bird and causes her to love and to obey him frequendy contrast with distressingly alternative scenarios in which she disobeys his call, flies away, or worse still, flies off to another man. Turberville's treatise is haunted by the likelihood of such eventualities from the beginning, its prefatory poem describing the sport of falconry as being "right pleas- ant" and yet never not "mixt with paine" (sig.Biv). If the "good" hawk is courteous and gentle, then her "bad" counterpart has opprobrium heaped upon her, and often in distinctly gendered terms. Bad hawks "rangle [range] and wander" (fols. 19, 34) or "rangle and gadde" (fol. 62); they are "giddy headed, and fickle" (fol. 32), "very slouthfull, and hard mettelde" (fol. 48), "prowde and ramage" [ramage, from French, rameau , refers to a young bird that jumps branch to branch, i.e. is wild, untamed] and they think on nothing "but to soare and gadde abroade" (fol. 95); they are guilty of "ramage toyes" (fols. 108, 141); they are "coye and daungerous" (fol. 122), "coye and verye vntowarde" (fol. 142), "coy or ramage" (fol. 143) or "ramage and coy" (fol. 176); they might prove "a madbraine Kite" (fol. 174) or be "hotte and madbrayned" (fols. 175- 76). The bad hawk "through hir gadding moode &amp; gallantnesse of minde, doth ra[n]gle out from her keeper" (fol. 151), and, if not well-trained, "will not long be at your commaundement, but make you foliowe hir" (fol. 152), something that is presented as a worse case scenario - a kind of world-turned-upside down - for in place of the good falconer who instructs his bird to obey him, we have instead a bad bird who "oftentimes will teach you hot poasting iourneys" (fol. 158). A poem in A Handefull of Pleasant Delites (1566) entitled "The Lover compareth himself to the painful Falconer" describes just such a scenario in which the bird "Her Falconer doth constraine / Sometime to range the ground unknown, / To find her out againe," with the 22.

Turberville appears as just such a pained figure in his own "falcon" poems. In three of these poems the "I" appears as the unfortunate falconer who has lost (and lost control of) his bird. In each poem the perfect accord between man and bird is represented as an ideal love relation - as the model of intimate affection between lovers, or of "friendship" in the sixteenth-century meaning of that word. In every case, however, this ideal is presented as something no longer available to the speaker, as a relation he has irretrievably lost. In "The Louer to a Gentlewoman, that after great friendship without desart or cause of mislyking refused him," he writes, Haue you not heard it long ago of cunning Fawkners tolde, That Haukes which loue their keepers call are woorth their weight in Golde? And such as knowe the luring voice of him that feedes them still: And neuer rangle farre abroade against the keepers will . . .

Birds were hooded to shield them from surrounding sights and sounds that might alarm them; in training, a bird was attached to a line (or creance) to prevent her from flying away; a bewet was a ring or slip of leather used for attaching the bell to a hawk's leg; bells were used to locate and track down lost birds. © 201 1 English Literary Renaissance Inc.</page><page sequence="15">Catherine Bates 417 As might no Fowle for weightnesse well compare With thee, thou wert a Bird so passing rare: What may I deeme of thee (fayre Fawlcon) now, That neyther to my lure nor traine wilt bow.25 But this that when my back is turnde and gon, Another giues thee rumpes to tyre vpon.

(EESS, fol. 113V) Like Wyatt's "They flee from me," these poems conjure a female creature that was once ("sometime," "earst") faithful to her keeper/lover - once tame enough, that is, to take food from, fly back to, and sit upon his hand - but in the anguished present ("now"), is wild, out of sight, and out of his control. As in Wyatt's poem, the temporal disjunction between past and present drives home the sense of absolute loss - "thou wert my Bird, But (Fawlcon) now adue" (fol. 114.v) - for, with the joy he once possessed gone for good, the speaker is truly abandoned, forsaken, dispossessed. This situation goads the failed falconer into railing at his bird. He threatens to remove her trappings ("Yeelde me thy slanting Hood, shake off those Belles of thine," [fol. 1 13v]), to punish her, and to deprive her of privileges and food. He even wishes "some fowle and fell disease" (fol. 1 5 v) upon her, having in mind, no doubt, one of the many ailments to which hawks were prone, such as "the crampe . . . the cray, the stone that lies within, / The Philanders, the Frounce, the Goute, the Panthas, &amp; the pin, / the Rie, the Rhewme, the Canker," as well as "lice and my tes [that] marre, / And all such wormes, as with your hawks do wage co[n]tinual war," that the prefatory poem of the Booke of Faulconrie 25. A lure was a dummy used to attract the falcon back to her keeper, both during training and after a kill (specifically, it was a piece of meat attached to a length of string and to which the feathers or wings of the bird's characteristic prey were tied); a train was a live bird (often lamed or disabled in some way) offered as an enticement to a young hawk during its training. 26.

B2).27 Since a full third of Turberville's manual consists of detailed advice on how to prevent one's bird from contracting such unpleasant conditions, and since only a bad falconer or "marrehawke" would allow his bird to fall victim to them, the speaker's spiteful wish that "Diseases must of force . . . ensue" (fol. 11 4v) can be taken as a sign of how radically the once "courteous" relation between keeper and bird has broken down. Casting the woman as the disobedient bird naturally creates an oppor- tunity for the usual anti-feminist rant: "Well wanton well, if you were wise in deede / You would regard the fist whereon you feede" (fol. 1 1 1), "No, doubtlesse wanton lust and fleshly fowle desire / Did make thee loath my friendly lure, and set thy hart on fire" (fol. 1 14). And this is one reason, no doubt, why identifying the male speaker as the falconer and the mistress as his disobedient bird constitutes what, in the literature of the period, one critic calls "by far the largest such metaphorical group."28 The falconer's disenchantment with his bird, however, is not only the result of her flying away or flying off to another man, although these remain common complaints. In the first of Turberville's falcon poems, for example, the speaker refers to certain standard types of disobedient bird - such as those "that stoopeth to no stale [decoy bird]: / Nor forceth on the Lure" - but he then goes on to specify, quite distinctly, "another kinde, farre worser than the rest: / And those are they that flie at check, and stoupe to e[v]rie gest."When a hawk flies at check she forsakes her proper game and instead pursues some baser quarry (a rook or crow, for example) that happens to cross her flight.This capture of the wrong (that is, insufficiently "courtly") kind of prey, is presented as the ultimate in bad bird behavior - "They leaue the lawe that nature taught and shun their woonted kinde, / In fleeing after e[v]rie Foule that mounteth with the winde" (fol. 15) - and the poem ends with a savage castigation for such perverse or unnatural conduct: So some perhaps will liue in hope at length to light on thee, That earst reclaimde so gentle werte and louing birde to mee, But if thou chaunce to fall to check, and force on e[v]rie fowle, Thou shalt be worse detested then, than is the nightish O wie. 27.

Rather, she is demoted to the hated owl, as here, or in the other falcon poems to other low forms: "Such checking Bussards yll deserue or Bell or Hood so fine" (fols. H3v). Not even other men will want a bird who behaves in this way: I wishe thee this for woonted olde good will To flie more high, for feare the stowping will Breede him, that now doth keepe thee, out of loue And thinke his Fawlcon will a Bussard proue (fol. iii) The same language appears in the Booke of Faulconrie , where, if a bird persistently refuses to follow the correct prey, Turberville counsels the falconer to reject her out of hand: "I woulde not wishe you to trouble your selfe anye longer with such a vile Buzarde, but ridde your handes of hir, for sure it is great oddes that shee will neuer proue good" (fol. 186). I emphasize the point because the "checking" hawk relates to her keeper in a quite different way from the merely faithless or disobedient one. The latter maps all too easily onto the stereotype of the fickle woman, and those metaphors that make this comparison are the most conventional and, perhaps for that reason, the least interesting. The "checking" hawk, however, is castigated for being a bad weapon. The falconer relates to her as a hunter relates to his tool and not - in the first instance, at any rate - as a man relates to a woman. This kind of hawk is "bad" because it does not kill the right prey. In the ideal scenario, this feathered bolt that the skilled falconer releases into the air plummets with unerring accuracy onto the desired target and kills it outright. This is the point, furthermore, where the proper distinction needs to be made between falcons and hawks (which hitherto I have referred to interchangeably). For where hawks (genus accipiter) fly low and bring their prey down with a quick burst of speed, falcons (genus falco ) initially mount high in the sky and then dive or "stoop" on their prey from a great height, crushing it with a single blow.29 This char- acteristic behavior is frequently treated as a natural wonder. The "good" falcon is a brilliant killing machine: the unerring missile, the 29. This is the result of differences in wing shape and tail length. Falcons have narrow pointed wings and narrow tapering tails, their wing beats being rapid and regular. Hawks have © 201 1 English Literary Renaissance Inc.</page><page sequence="18">420 English Literary Renaissance impressively targeted arrow with which the (equally "good") falconer aims, shoots, and hits his prey (the right prey being, preferably a bird larger than the falcon herself, such as a heron or crane). Such a bird is, as Cummins puts it, "almost a physiological extension of its master" (p. 190). On those occasions, therefore, where the poet creates a scene in which that feathered shaft swerves, misses, or hits the wrong thing, he is putting himself in the same territory as Gascoigne's "Woodmanship," where shooting and missing, shooting and hitting the wrong thing, not shooting at all, or being shot at are all forms of shooting "awry." The failures ofTurberville's hapless falconer could be seen in their own way to constitute versions of such shooting wrong or shooting wide. In the poems discussed here, when the falcon hits on the wrong prey or flies at "check," it is presented as the ultimate disaster - as the most "awry" kind of shooting possible - its seriousness being of a quite a different order of magnitude from the mere misfortune of her flying away. For here the falcon doubles as a malfunctioning instrument: as an aim- inhibited missile or as a rogue weapon in the hunter's armory, detached, displaced, and curiously feminized in the process. The unre- liability of women generates the standard misogynistic complaint, but the unreliability of a man's shooting tool is something quite else. The man whose weapon refuses to go where directed or to bring off the right kill is, by implication, far worse off than the man whose bird has simply flown away or flown to someone else. In its dual function as both a female creature (whether friendly or fickle) and as a phallic weapon "shot" at target prey, whether straight or "awry," the falcon thus serves as a particularly mobile signifier in the mapping of male/female relations and identities. This mobility is strained to breaking point on those occasions when the male speaker appears not as the falcon's keeper (whether good or bad) but rather as the falcon's prey, an identification that, while less common than the former, nonetheless forms a recognized variation on the falconry motif. In "The dispairing Louer craues eyther mercie in time at his Ladies hands, or cruell death," Turberville obliges as follows: Like as the fearefull Foule within the Fawcons foote, Doth yeelde himselfe to die, and sees none other boote: shorter, rounder wings and a longer tail, resulting in a gliding flight broken at intervals by three or four wing beats. They often soar with wings and tail spread.

The hart within my breast with trembling feare doth quake: And saue your loue (my Deare) nought can my torment slake. (EESS, fol. 1 9 v) If the male speaker has appeared before as a fearful forestman, fisherman, or fowler, then the figure he mutates into here is that of the fearful fowl, as he resigns an already weak human identity for a still weaker animal one. As one critic puts it, Turberville represents the relation of lover to mistress here in terms of "the most abject servitude."30 In cases such as this, the falcon's dual function as both mistress and weapon becomes distinctly problematic. The falcon is clearly identified as the male speaker's "Ladie" or "Deare," and, in that capacity, she is implored to release the quaking victim she has in her clutches: the lover appeals to her "beautie," "ruth," and "grace" (fol. 19V) to spare his suffering if not his life and thereby to "showe thy selfe a friende" (fol. 20). Nevertheless, the mistress is equally clearly identified as a vicious bird of prey, and, in that capacity, what she is most likely to do is to tear her victim violently apart: a possibility to which the lover remains no less alert, asking her, if she will not save him, to "Sende mee the fatali toole, and cruell cutting knife: / And thou shalt see me rid my wretched limmes of life" (fol. 20). Although both possibilities are ostensibly held open, on balance the speaker would, if anything, opt for a quick death rather than a life of suffering: "Of both I count it least by cursed death to fall, / Than ruthlesse here to liue and aye to be a thrall" (fol. 20). The basic contradiction of the falcon metaphor, between a ruthful mistress and a ruthless predator, is made particularly evident in the poem's treatment of natural instinct or "kind." The behaviors in ques- tion are diametrically opposed. As mistress, the lady is asked to show her "natural" femininity: her beauty makes the speaker hope that she will be merciful to him, for "Where Nature hath yformde such featurde shape to showe, / There hath she closde in breast a hart for grace to growe" (fol. I9v)."As thou a Woman art by kinde," he urges, "to womans kinde agree" (fol. 20). But if women are "naturally" kind, then aren't raptors naturally cruel? Such an appeal to "kind" is unreliable in any case, since the natural order of things can be called upon to defend more or less 30. William E.

On numerous other occasions Turberville assures us (along with the usual male voice choir) that women are cruel, change- able, and light - not to mention, predatory - "by kind."32 In analogous poems of the period, the mistress is sometimes compared to a merlin (a form of falcon) that captures a lark or other small bird but then releases it unharmed.33 Each of these poems draws on the myth that the merlin would clutch the smaller bird in order to keep herself warm through the night, but would then let the poor creature go, terrified but otherwise none the worse for its ordeal. Popular as this piece of folklore may have been, however, it is very dubious as a piece of natural history, and the poets' various attempts to appeal to the merlin's apparendy "natural" altruism fare little better thanTurberville's appeal to his falcon's "female" kindness. Thus, where Barnabe Googe claims that "the tender marlion" exemplifies the miraculous charity or "kindness" to be found in nature, he is immediately refuted by an answering poem that offers the grisly example of the tench that heals the pike "by kind" and is promptly devoured for its pains. In Gascoigne's variation on the theme, nature is equally red in tooth and claw. For him (on this occasion, a captive partridge), "nature made the Merlyne mee to kyll, / And me to yeeld unto the Merlines will" (23.17-18). In these terms, for Turberville's equally captive speaker to appeal to the mercy and kindness of his falcon is hardly a safe bet. In the Booke of Faulconrie , Turberville frequently avers that the "mis- terie and skill" (fol. 213) of the sport lies precisely in its ability to alter the course of nature: the "arte" of falconry, for example, "deserueth no 31. For example, proverb lore is invoked to prove, as equally axiomatic, the fact that wild animals such as lions and tigers can be tamed (EESS&gt; fols. 22v, 70-70V), and that they can never be tamed ( EESS , fols. 76V, io8v); or that "kind" itself can never alter (EESS, fols. 82-8 2v; ES, fol. 175), and that it can and fřequendy does alter (EESS, fol. 124.v; ES, fol. 163). 32.

Such alteration, however, refers to the trained birds' surprising willingness to return to their keepers when they have "the whole scope of the heauens, and the circuite of the earth at their pleasure to range and peruse" (fol. 5), or to catch prey for their keepers rather than for themselves. There is no question that in their natural or trained condition these birds are anything other than bloodthirsty killers. So if the speaker's appeal to his mistress's milk of feminine kindness is at best somewhat risky, then any appeal he makes to the falcon's natural "kind" is positively suicidal. Turberville's poem stages several different states of masculine abjection, for in none of the positions he takes is the male speaker anything other than routed or disempowered. In the "best" case scenario, where the falcon is identi- fied with the mistress, he is at the mercy of a woman to whose kindness he not very convincingly appeals: as her fluttering captive, he puts himself in the powerless, yielding, "feminine" position, in a clear reversal of "normative" gender roles. In the "next" scenario, where the mistress is identified as a falcon, he is at the mercy of a killer bird whose instinctive behavior is to snuff out her prey, in which case he is positioning himself to be on the receiving end of that mighty bolt and effectively inviting her to penetrate, crush, and eviscerate him in the most violent way imaginable, with all the sexual violence that implies. He does end the poem, after all, resigned to his death. There is not much sign of heteronormative gender roles here, nor in the "final" scenario, where the falcon is identified as an airborne projectile that comes to fall back resoundingly upon the falconer, returning us to that familiar figure of self-defeat and self-sabotage: the hunter hunted, or the shooter shot. For Turberville no less than for his fellow poets, falconry turns out to be a "painful" business indeed. The falconry metaphor thus seems liable to fly off in unexpected directions and to take the poet to places quite unforeseen: to be as flighty and unreliable as a falcon itself. And the effect in Turberville's case seems to be to subvert or destabilize the masculine subject in some way, to undermine or cast doubt upon his integrity or mastery. The same might be said of a further variation on the falconry motif. In this case, the falcon is identified not with the mistress, to whom the lover relates as keeper or prey, but rather with the male lover, who now relates to his lady as an animal to its master-mistress: a scenario © 201 1 English Literary Renaissance Inc.</page><page sequence="22">424 English Literary Renaissance which - although it reverses the more customary arrangement whereby the bird is, by default, female and her keeper, generally, male - nonetheless had some validity in practice since women were known to fly and sometimes even to train falcons. In one of Turber- ville's poems, for example, the male lover tells his mistress that "Thy pleasant call shall haue no power to lure my cunning eare" (ES, fol. 165), this being the only occasion when a falcon actually speaks up for itself. Admittedly, the power-relation is "re-reversed" in this case, for the poem is one in which the male lover finally bids his lady farewell (having denounced her betrayal of their mutual "friendship"), so that the behavior that would have been branded as disobedient or wild if the falcon had been female, is here re-coded as a blessed escape from female sexual snares. Nevertheless, in an earlier poem the scenario of the female keeper and male hawk is given more extended treatment and its implications more fully developed and explored. In "The aunswere of a woman to hir Louer, supposing his complaint to be but fayned," the situation is seen from the woman's point of view. It is she who speaks and who, after many lines denouncing the treachery and untrustworthiness of men, declares: A Fawcon is full hard amongst you men to finde, For all your maners more agree vnto the Kytish kinder For gentle is the one and loues his keepers hande, But thother Busserdlike doth scorne on Fawckners fist to stände. For one good turne the one a thousand will requite, But vse the other nere so well he shewth himselfe a Kite. (EESS, fol. 32) On this occasion, all the terms of mutual love and courtesy to which the language of falconry so naturally lent itself are invoked, only to be turned around and used very much at men's expense. It is now they (note that the "Fawcon" is explicitly gendered as male) who are at fault and guilty of lapses from true courtliness that reduce them to buzzards and kites, the most base of conditions.34 This poem, moreover, is clearly presented as a requital or "aunswere" to the standard misogynistic rant, as the female speaker crisply reverses the age-old charges against 34. There are strong parallels here with Chaucer's Squire's Tale in which male perfidy is similarly figured as the behavior of a wicked male hawk which pretends "gentillesse" to his mistress but then deserts her for a base kite.

The poem is one of a group of paired epistles in which the woman takes up her pen in order to respond to her male correspondent, and this two-way gambit might be seen to structure the Epitaphes, Epigrams , Songs and Sonets as a whole, for while not every poem forms part of a pair of epistles, nonetheless the prefatory poem that opens the volume presents the collection that follows as modelled on the letter exchange between Paris and Helen.35 Turberville's literary prototype here is Ovid's Heroides , his translation of which (published in the same year as Epitaphes , Epigrams , Songs and Sonets) included letter exchanges between Paris and Helen and other lover-pairs, as well as single epistles written by women whose correspondents do not reply. Insofar as it lays bare the interior monologues of its female speakers, the Heroides allows for the "sustained articulation of a feminine mo/," one in which the male poet might identify with female subjectivity with some intimacy and imaginatively enter into female experience at some length.36 Among the first wave of Elizabethan translations of Ovid Turberville's Heroycall Epistles was, as Patricia Phillippy points out, "unique in its lack of moralizing gloss" (p. 3 3). Where other translators made extensive use of such glosses in order to repackage Ovid's characters and tales as moral exempla, Turberville offered his readers an un-annotated, unencumbered text, the purpose of which was, explicidy, not to teach but to delight: "Go (slender Muse) &amp; make report to men / That meer desire to pleasure them indeed / Made me in hand to take the painefull pen" (p. vii). By declining to domesticate Ovid's poem or to contain it within a moralizing framework, Turberville's translation aligns itself more closely with the original Heroides and the challenge it had posed to the "Vergilian" version of heroic masculinity. In this context, an epistle in which a woman expresses her disappointment at the failure of her male 35. "The aunswere of a woman to hir Louer, supposing his complaint to be but fayned" is a response to "To his absent Friend the Louer writes of his vnquiet and resdesse state" ( EESS , fols. 29V-31). The other epistle pairs are: "To his Friende to be constant after choise made," followed by "Counsell returned by Pyndara to Tymetes, of constancie" (EESS, fols. 20-2 iv); "A Letter sent by Tymetes to his Ladie Pyndara at the time of his departure," followed by " Pyndaras aunswere to the Letter which Tymetes sent hir at the time of his departure" (EESS, fols. 23-29); and "Of certaine Flowers sent him by his Loue vpon suspicion of chaunge," followed by "The Aunswere to the same" (EESS, fols. 42V-43V). 36.

Turberville also seems to have eschewed the one opportunity that the falcon metaphor might have offered him for redeeming the masculine writing subject and restoring him to some kind of agency. In The Eglogs that Turberville translated from Mantuan, for example (also published in 1567), the ninth and last poem is subtitled "Falco" and concludes with a paean to "A Shephierd, one that of the Falcon, Falco hight." The figure is praised for being not only a good pastor but a good poet: "That in his Songs excels the antique Poets, and / The skilfull Orpheus that both woods and rockes about the land / By force of Musike drew, the rest of Romaine race."37 In Mantuan's similarly subtitled original, the "Falco" in question was Falcone de'Sinibaldi, papal treasurer under Innocent VIII and the poet's great friend and protector in Rome. The eclogue was written in his honor. He is presented as the one good shepherd in an otherwise corrupt and worldly papal court, and the poem's bitter satire against the Roman curia is probably what made it the best known and most popular of Mantuan's eclogues, since it had an obvious appeal to English Protestant ears. It would also serve as a model for the September eclogue in Spenser's Shepheardes Calender. Having subtided his eclogue, however, Mantuan does not go on to develop the falcon metaphor. By contrast, Turberville makes a point of emphasizing that this good shepherd is "of the Falcon, Falco hight," and in so doing may have had in mind the use of the falcon metaphor to praise the figure of the poet, to make heroic his soaring flights.38 Turberville hints at this usage elsewhere in his poetry, as when he praises the Earl of Surrey, "Whose Pen approoude what wit he had in mue / Where such a skill in making Sonets grue" ( EESS , fol. 10). A "mew" was the cage or dedicated building in which hawks were kept. Turberville's own modesty topos and a very realistic assessment of his own limitations forbid him from aspiring to such poetic flights 37. The Eclogs of the Poet B. Mantuan Carmelitan, Turned into English Verse by G. Turbervile (1567), fol. 92V. Mantuan first published his eclogues under the title of Adulescentia in 1498.

In the prefatory poem to the Tragicall tales - the poem in which Melpomene sternly warns him against attempting the over- ambitious project of translating Lucan - she asks: "Darste thou presume with ymped quilles so prowde a pitch to Aie?" (fol. 7). Since "imped" feathers were those that a falconer engrafted into the wing or tail of his bird so as to make good any that had been damaged or lost (with an obvious pun on the poet's quill-pen), Melpomene clearly does not consider Turberville to be in the falcon's league: "The peeuishe puttocke may not preace in place where Eagles are" (fol. 9). In her view, the kind of "eagle" or high-flier who would be capable of such a task is Lord Buckhurst, a figure who, like Surrey, is not only of noble rank but also of proven poetic skill.39 When Turberville refers the falcon metaphor to himself, therefore, he uses it not to boast but rather to draw attention to his low social status and to denigrate his own writing skills. In "He craues his mistresse to accept his wryting being otherwise insufficient to winne good liking from her," for example, the speaker declares: Thus each one doth attempt, and puts the thing in vre [use] That fittest is to gaine good will, so Faulkners vse the lure. But I vnhappy wight, that can doe nought of these: How might I doe, or what deuise my mistresse minde to please [?] (ES fol. I59v) The activities he is incapable of pulling off are the courtly and courting skills of conversation, music, dance, song, or jousting, and once again the customary metaphor comes to hand to figure those multiple failures in terms of the poor falconer who cannot catch his bird. The only thing the speaker can do is write: "I can doe nought vnlesse it be with pen to shew my plight. / I only can in verse, set out a dame to show" (fol. 159V). On this basis he continues: Thus must I hunt for loue wherefoe (good Lady) then In lieu of other finer skilles, accept my ragged pen. Let me by writing win, what others doe by arte: And during life you shal assure, you of a louing hart. (fol. 160) This is the standard humility topos, of course: the lover's habitual bid for sincerity and "ardessness." But in a context where hunting and 39.
