<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Recent Contributions to Danish Ballad Research AAGE JORGENSEN AS is well-known the medieval centuries did not produce more than two major contributions to Danish national literature: Saxo's Latin Gesta Danorum and the ballads in the vernacular. The latter, originating from the centuries between 1100 and 1500, but known only from sources considerably younger, and from oral tradition, are available in Danmarks gamle Folkeviser, ten volumes, the publication of which was started in 1853 by Svend Grundt- vig and brought to completion in 1965 by Erik Dal.' Because of the artistic qualities of the ballads, and because of the variety of problems arising in connection with material of the kind in question, Dan- ish ballad research is far from easily surveyed, and it also represents rather many points of view and attitudes toward the subject. This fact is evidenced, e.g. by Jorgen Bang's anthology Synspunkter pa folkevisen,2 which aims at elucidating the historical development as well as the contemporary problems of ballad research. The volume may be considered a 'textual complement' to Erik Dal's outstanding study Nordisk folkeviseforskning siden 1800,3- both works are indispensable tools to anybody seriously occupied with prob- lems within this field. It is sub-divided into eight sections, the first of which concentrates on important aspects of ballad 'research' between Anders So- rensen Vedel's famous It Hundrede Vduaalde Danske Viser, 1591, and Svend Grundtvig's first DgF-volume, 1853, while the sections 2-7 are devoted to linguistic, philological-aesthetic, historical, folkloristic, musical, and literary points of view. The major contributions included are by Svend Grundtvig, Johannes Brondum-Nielsen, Axel Olrik, Johannes Steenstrup, and Iorn Pio, -and in the large section of literary approaches, where all the contributions are 'major', by Ernst Frandsen, Mogens Brondsted, Villy Sorensen, Flem- ming Harrits, and Peer E. Sorensen. The final section (pp. 328-70) contains meta-critical reflections by the editor and attempts, towards the end, to ques- tion much traditional thinking as regards the transmission of ballad material. The texts included are reproduced photographically. A select bibliography (of 162 items) concludes the anthology. The Frandsen contribution mentioned above is reprinted from a selection made up for educational purposes in 1937. It summarizes the author's im- portant-and much criticized-study Folkevisen, originally published in 1935 and reprinted in a paperback edition in 1969.4 This work asserts that Germany played a more significant part than England in the transmission of the ballad genre from France to Scandinavia. Frandsen compares the for- mulaic inventory of the ballads with that of the novels of chivalry, i.e. the</page><page sequence="2">SOME RECENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO DANISH BALLAD RESEARCH 187 Swedish Eufemia lays, especially the translation from 1303 of Chretien's Yvain: Le chevalier au lion, and postulates the existence of an East Scandi- navian minnesong. He also characterizes three stages in the early history of the ballads, considers the four-line stanza to be an extension of the two- line stanza, and rejects the theory of burden-stems ('stevstammeteori') de- veloped by Richard Steffen. Frandsen's periodization is almost exclusively based on the ballads of magic (in DgF, volume 2). This is also true of Villy Sorensen's. His essay on 'Folkeviser og forlovelser', originally published in 1959 and reprinted in a paperback edition in 1973,5 has been of great importance especially to the youngest generation of Danish critics, because it aims at understanding the ballads as interpretations of human existence, not at describing them as historical relics. Flemming Harrits, in an essay entitled 'Folkevisepro- blemer-med saerligt henblik pa Villy Sorensen',6 professes agreement as to the basic conception that 'a ballad demon is a "sindbillede" ' (i.e. a projec- tion, or symbol-but not an anthropomorphic natural force). Sorensen has, however, used 'reconstructed' texts in addition to the DgF material. His interpretations are also marked by 'a somewhat reductive Freudian ten- dency'. And his assertion that some ballads of chivalry have features in common with the ballads of magic is due to a misunderstanding of their realistic elements. Toward the end of his essay Harrits introduces an alterna- tive to the traditional view of the process of formation of the ballads. Every period is shaped by residual elements from several previous periods. Two ballads representing different attitudes may, therefore, be the products of different residual elements present in one period, rather than the products of different periods. Peer E. Sorensen's essay 'Et episk monster i folkevisen'7 attempts to re- place the well-known systematization of the ballads according to external criteria by a new one based on internal criteria. The author analyses a series of ballads and isolates a structure ('exposition'/'transition situation'/'con- sequence') that may be called archetypal. These three contributions to a more adequate understanding of the medieval ballads as literary works constituting a genre of their own are all included in Synspunkter pa folkevisen. Interpretations of individual ballads are, however, not considered in the anthology. At least two such contribu- tions, both published in a composite volume edited by Thomas Bredsdorff, and aiming at demonstrating different methods and approaches character- istic of Danish literary criticism of the 1960's, should be mentioned here: Jens Anker Jorgensen's interpretation of DgF 271, 'Redselille og Medel- vold', and Hans Molbjerg's of DgF 288, 'Torbens Datter og hendes Fader- bane'.8 Jens Anker Jorgensen has also published some reflections on 'Slaeg- tsnormer i folkevisen',9 i.e. the kind of social norms and standards most fre- quently causing the conflicts at least in the ballads of chivalry (i.e. in the two ballads interpreted in the Bredsdorff volume). Otto Holzapfel, who in 1968 published a minor article examining 'En tre- dage-formel i folkevisen','0 had his Inaugural-Dissertation published by the Frankfurt a.M. University the following year: Studien zur Formelhaftigkeit</page><page sequence="3">188 AAGE JORGENSEN der mittelalterlichen diinischen Volksballade," a thorough and competent in- vestigation of the function of some frequent formulas, especially the so- called 'Szenereiformel'. 'Mit ihr', maintains the author, 'stellt die Ballade wiederkehrende typische Vorginge dar und interpretiert diese mit der Formal nach einem festen Schema. [. .] Sie stellt nicht nur dar, sie charak- terisiert auch'. Holzapfel's work was sympathetically reviewed by lorn Pio,'2 at present the Danish folklorist most competently engaging himself in ballad research, and especially concerned with the folkloristic aspects of the ballads of magic. Together with Bengt Holbek he wrote the reference work Fabeldyr og Sagn- folk, that appeared in 1967.'3 Specific problems within the same area are thoroughly discussed in two articles on 'Overnaturlige vxesner i nordisk bal- ladetradition'.' 4 The first of these articles examines DgF 33, 'Germand Gla- densvend', and DgF 60, 'Valravnen', in order to determine what kind of demon the heroes of these two ballads of magic are confronted with. It gives the following answer: a human being transformed into a raven, who must drink boy-child blood in order to get out of the bewitched state. The second article, on DgF 38, 'Agnete og Havmanden', convincingly demonstrates that this well-known ballad is not a medieval one, but 'a pre-romantic song, pro- duced in Denmark in the 1770's'. Popular versions of these contributions have appeared in Skalk, a widely circulated journal devoted to archaeological and related matters. 15 An early era of Danish ballad research is represented by a new paperback edition of Edward Godfrey Cox's translation, originally published in 1914, of Johannes Steenstrup's Vore Folkeviser fra Middelalderen: Studier over Visernes .Esthetik, rette Form og Alder [Our Popular Ballads from the Middle Ages: Studies of the Aesthetics, Correct Form, and Age of the Ballads], 1891.16 Steenstrup was a historian and therefore mainly interested in the ballads as historical sources, and in the 'historical' ballads. He aimed at characterizing 'the "correct" spirit and form of the ballads', and maintained that the most important task of ballad research was to 'procure the genuine oldest form', i.e. to reconstruct the texts, to regain their 'original' versions. The historical background is also the main concern of H. Gosta Davidsen and Vilh. Moller-Christensen, who have made an attempt to identify the real persons and tensions that may have served as points of departure of the ballad, DgF 126, on Liden Kirsten's cruel death because of her secret love for Prince Buris.'7 How extremely difficult (or rather: how hopelessly impossible) it is to reconstruct ballads known only from manuscripts con- siderably younger than the 'original' forms-if this concept can be used at all in this context-is underlined from a linguistic point of view in Aage Jorgensen's Folkevisesproget,18 in which the language of the ballads, such as we know them (from the forty manuscripts and from DgF), is charac- terized and the basic problems of characterization discussed. DgF239, 'Meens Morgendromme', is utilized by way of exemplification. Recently the entire problem of the so-called burden-stems, i.e. lyrical stanzas placed in front of some (but not very many) of the ballads, has been reconsidered in an article, 'Folkevisens lyriske indledninger', by Kaare</page><page sequence="4">SOME RECENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO DANISH BALLAD RESEARCH 189 Vinten.' Richard Steffen maintained, in a book entitled Enstrofig nordisk folklyrik [Single-Stanza'd Scandinavian Folk-Lyrics], 1898, that these stanzas evidenced the existence in the Middle Ages of an old one-stanza dancing poetry, which had an impact on the ballads. Vinten repeats the rejec- tion of this theory, in the same way as, e.g. Ernst Frandsen did it, but on the other hand he questions Frandsen's conception not only in the 1935- book, but also in a 1954-article, which modifies the original point of view.20 The core of Frandsen's conception is that the lyrical introductions are the radical consequences of a 'lyrization' of the entire genre (a lyrization influenc- ing upon the poetic style of older ballads and determining the style of younger ones). Vinten agrees that the lyrization played a part in the develop- ment process of the introduction stanzas, but just as much as symptoms as as results-that in other words an understanding of the introductions de- pends on a recognition of their connection with literary preludes in general and with phenomena of the kind to be found in literature of the period of transcription in particular. Reference is made especially to German and to German-inspired Danish lyric poetry of the 1500's. Kaare Vinten's article appeared in the 1973-volume of Danske Studier, which also contained a photographic reprint of part 5f of a report elaborated by Kaj Bom a few years ago in order to clarify problems of isolating sources to be considered by an Old Danish dictionary in progress.2" Kaj Bom's con- clusion runs that most of the ballads should be considered in a post-medieval dictionary, since all manuscripts are from the period after 1550-and that the few fragments handed over from the medieval centuries may be referred to a Norse sphere of language. The fragments in question are discussed thoroughly from a philological point of view. Another 1973-contribution to ballad research, by Aage Henriksen, pro- vides stimulating reflections on a group of texts, DgF 73-81, in which the 'throwing of runes', symbolizing a kind of erotic compulsion socially con- nected with the dangerous zone of possibilities between legalized marriage and plain rape, plays a predominant part.22 Attention should also be called to an article by Gun Widmark on habits of rhyming in Old Icelandic and Danish ballad poetry,23 and to a contribu- tion by M. I. Steblin-Kamenskij, 'The Ballad in Scandinavia and Ballad Origins',24 in which it is maintained-in agreement with, e.g. Svale Sol- heim-that the hypothesis of the aristocratic origin of the ballads is an over- simplification. Themes and motifs struck by ballad poetry and varied by later literary works are surveyed by Aage Kabell in 'DgF 90 and the Danish Novel' (on the 'Aage og Else'-motif)2 5 and by W. Glyn Jones in 'Valdemar and Tove: From Danish Ballad to Schonberg's Gurrelieder' (on the DgF 121-motif).26 The best general survey of the entire ballad poetry of the Middle Ages is still the one provided by Oluf Friis in his outstanding torso Den danske Litteraturs Historie, vol. 1-which the author, for one or another odd reason, did not want to have reprinted in Synspunkterp folkevisen (so that the editor of the anthology cannot possibly be blamed for its most striking omission !). 2 7 Some recent minor accounts of Danish and/or Scandinavian literature</page><page sequence="5">190 AAGE JORGENSEN of course also contain comments on the ballads, but without adding new aspects to the considerations provided by their predecessors. Nonethe- less it should be natural to conclude this survey with references to these accounts: Frederic Durand's Histoire de la litterature danoise, 1967;2 8 Mario Gabrieli's Le letterature della Scandinavia, 2nd rev. ed., 1969 ;29 P.
