Printed in United States of America Wildlife documentaries: from classical forms to reality TV Jan-Christopher Horak Take a good look. We're not going to see this kind of thing much longer. It already belongs to the past.1 Thanks for vast herds of Bison to kill and skin, leaving their carcasses to rot in the fields2 e are now observing a paradigm shift in the functionality of wildlife documentary films and television programs. For nearly eighty years, filmed images of the natural world conformed to the classic documentary aesthetic. Such images were perceived to be an expansion of human vision, a means of entering into a world that was invisible to the human eye, an extension of the physical body of the subject, allowing for the creation of pleasure by bringing animals in their natural habitat closer to humans through the act of visualization in moving image media. And while the visualization of animal life entailed particular narrative conventions that also communicated overt and covert ideologies, as was the case with all classic documentary forms, audiences still believed in the iconic nature of that experience. Today, the impulse to document nature is augmented by the much higher stakes endeavor of "preserving" animal life in a virtual world. Looking over the precipice of an earth depopulated of its wildlife, the goal of nature filmmakers becomes the capture of animals, at least in images, so that society and science have a record of what was lost. Every moving image can potentially be the last "living" image of a species, in the truest sense of the word. We can compare this phenomenon in the natu ral world to the work of Edward S. Curtis, the photog rapher and documentary filmmaker who made it his duty to document Native American cultures in North America before they became extinct. In the first quote w above George Bird Grinnell is speaking to Edward S. Curtis as they watch a "Sun Dance" ceremony of the Blackfoot, Algonquin, and Bloods tribes in 1900. Curtis was convinced of his mission to preserve photo-chemically through images a "dying race" and its culture. The great documentar?an, Robert Fla herty, made similar statements about capturing a nearly extinct culture, when he produced Nanook of the North (1922). Human societies living close to nature were indeed the first victims of modernization and the capitalist exploitation of natural resources. In the not so distant future, our culture will possibly only see wild animals virtually or in special game reserves and zoos, much as we put native peoples in "reservations". Michel Foucault has in a posthumously published lecture defined zoological and botanical gardens as heterotopias. In these "other spaces", whether real or virtual, as in wildlife films, wildlife has been collected, ordered, and sys tematized "to create a space that is other, another real space, as perfect, as meticulous, as well ar ranged as ours is messy, ill constructed, and jum bled".3 Outside these heterotopias, other wildlife may be wiped out, probably without a "Thanksgiving Prayer", as composed by William Burroughs. Through a remorseless government policy, Ameri can bison were lead to the very brink of extinction in the late nineteenth century. Killing the buffalo was Jan-Christopher Horak is Acting Director of the Moving Image Archives Studies Program at UCLA, He is Founding Editor of The Moving Image (University of Minnesota Press), and has published numerous books and over 200 essays and reviews in English, German, French, Italian, Dutch, Spanish, Hungarian, Swedish, and Hebrew publications. Correspondence to jchrishorak@aol,com_</page><page sequence="2">460 Jan-Christopher Horak part of a campaign of genocide against Native Ameri cans. Almost immediately the nascent moving image suggested that the remaining species be "saved" by placing them in zoos. A Lubin Film Company cata logue comments on Buffaloes Born in the Zoo Gar dens (1907): "Here is all that remains of the once numerous buffalo of North America, the species be ing almost extinct".4 As a casual subject of moving images, animals have been present ever since Edweard Muybridge photographed his animal locomotion series, yet within classical documentary forms, animals have seemingly remained ghettoized in the scientific and educational sphere, only intermittently the subject of mainstream theatrical experience. The filmed adven tures of famous explorers, big game hunters, or scientists (or pseudo-scientists), like Jacques Cousteau represented exceptions, even if they be came box office hits, like the German wildlife film, Heia Safari (1928) by Martin Rikli, which out per formed Fritz Lang's Spies in some markets.5 With the introduction of television and cable, with its insatiable demand for content, wildlife documentaries have become ever more popular and ever more numer ous. Countless animal film festivals are in operation these days, giving animal lovers, ecology freaks, and the movie-going public an opportunity to commune with nature, whether the Festival International du Film Animalier in Albert, France, the Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival in Wyoming, the Japan Wildlife Festival in Tokyo or the European Nature Film Festival Valvert in Brussels, Belgium. The production of animal films for television has expanded geometrically with the establishment of a number of cable channels spe cializing in such fare, notably Animal Planet, the Na tional Geographic Channel, and The Discovery Channel. These networks broadcast animal docu mentaries almost 24 hours a day. There can be no doubt that these programs are popular, given the fact that National Geographic Channel has expanded into dozens of new markets since its founding seven years ago.6 In the winter of 2006, the French docu mentary La marche de l'empereur (The March of the Penguins, 2005, Luc Jacquet), which took anthropo morphism to new heights, earned over $80 million in the domestic American market, making it the second highest grossing documentary of all time. In crass contrast to the insatiable fascination that viewers bring to the experience of viewing wildlife films, the rate at which animals are becoming extinct is accelerating, victim of a civilization that places little value on natural habitats. The faster humanity ruins the natural environment through deforestation and the establishment of urban centers in previously un touched areas, the more rapidly certain species ex pire. According to the ongoing surveys of the International Union for Conservation of Natural Re sources, the so-called "Red Lists", more than 16,119 species are threatened with extinction, including 1003 kinds of mammals, i.e. 20 per cent. Also endan gered are 31 per cent of all amphibians, 12 per cent of all bird species, four percent of all reptiles, and four percent of all fish.7 In the United States 236 animal species have already become extinct. Many indige nous fish species are no longer present in European and American waters, many bird and fish species are suffering declining populations, due to insecticides and other ecological influences. Particularly at risk are our closest relatives in the animal world, the primates: of 296 primate species, 114 are critically endangered.8 One can therefore legitimately ask whether the growing obsession to document visually the animal world isn't at least partially a desperate act "to save" wildlife for a virtual world? Certainly an appeal to viewers to participate actively in preserving the natu ral environment is a narrative element in many mod ern wildlife documentaries, but these are usually depoliticized, calling for individual action, rather than social struggle. As Derek Bouse notes, there is little evidence to support the notion that wildlife films have contributed to saving nature.9 Meanwhile, the ur gency with which "the end of nature" is present in the master narratives of many recent wildlife documen taries, indicates that the worst fears of humanity are no longer unthinkable and may even become a real ity. Animal film producers are seemingly preparing the public for the day when all wildlife will merely be seen in zoos, wildlife reserves, aquaria or virtually as moving images. The fact that so many wildlife pro grams on television focus on zoos and wild life re serves underscores this assumption. It is noteworthy that while Edward S. Curtis was documenting Native Americans, a first generation of filmmakers was attempting not only to document the lives of animals, but was also particularly fascinated by their death. One of the most famous and contro versial films of early cinema is Electrocuting an Ele phant, produced by the Edison Manufacturing Company in January 1903. The viewer watches the elephant "Topsy" being executed: electric plates are attached to its feet and then the current is repeatedly</page><page sequence="3">Wildlife documentaries: from classical forms to reality TV 461 w! 9t. .: ....B Flg. 1-Pai//J. Rainey's African Hunt(W2). [Richard Koszarski Collection.] turned on, until finally the animal falls over and dies. However, before the elephant dies, it "dances" in pain as smoke rises from the burning flesh on its giant feet. Such horrific scenes were hardly a rare occurrence in early cinema, since their sensational ism drew audiences in droves. Ten years earlier, the Edison filmmakers W.K.L. Dickson and William Heise had shot a series of films about the extermination of rats: In Rat Killing (1894), a fox terrier is let loose in a rats nest, the camera capturing a gruesome carnage as the terrier does its work.10 The perverted visual pleasure in seeing living things being slaughtered is apparent throughout the history of cinema and seems to have increased sig nificantly in the late twentieth century.11 While animals in nature spend much of their lives resting or in static poses, moving images portray them in ceaseless activity. This emphasis on violent thrills is endemic to wildlife documentaries, at least those produced un der commercial imperatives, because such images are perceived to hold an audience's attention. Ac cording to Bouse: Anyone who spends time outdoors has prob ably realized that most real experiences of the natural world, away from cities and develop ment, tend to be experiences of serenity and quietude. Yet stillness and silence have almost no place in wildlife film, ... because stillness and silence are incompatible with the social and economic functions of film and televi 12 sion. It is also characteristic of nature documenta ries that despite their intention to reproduce the real iconically, they are never strictly documents of animal activity, but are artificial constructs which are largely dependent on classical documentary film tech niques. Indeed, many wildlife films emphasize in their publicity how much time, energy and money was spent in production. Narrators state flatly that film makers have waited patiently in the jungle for years in order to "capture" an animal on film. Directors, however, spend much more time in the studio and in the editing room than on location, since many spe cies can only be filmed in studio terrariums (a least until the advent of fiber optic cameras), for instance when filming ants in their underground colonies. The constant use of telephoto lenses to create close-ups of animals that are far from the camera, and the use of slow and fast motion, as well as other optical tricks, affords the audience views of animals they would not</page><page sequence="4">462 Jan-Christopher Horak see in such detail in nature, but also helps to create an artificial "emotional" relationship to animals. Just as important is the work of the film editor, since animals seldom follow directions, while "repeating a scene" in nature is also impossible. As a result, nature filmmakers produce at very high shooting ratios, then construct specific events through editing, utilizing images which may indeed have no spatial and temporal relationship to each other and may involve dozens of animals, rather than the one exam ple ostensibly being depicted. Indeed, the unity of space and time is only established artificially through cutting, much as is the case in classical documenta ries.13 It matters little whether the film in question is a scientific documentary or a nature film that empha sizes entertainment values. What kinds of relation ships do they construct between the animals and audience? Animals in documentaries are constantly subject to misuse. Obviously, a scientific film constructs a differ ent set of audience expectations than many enter tainment-oriented wildlife documentaries. However, some animal film commentators have concluded that wildlife films should not be considered docu mentaries at all, while others, including Greg Mitman, note that seeing animals on film cannot be equated with knowledge of animals in nature, despite the ideology in classical documentary that equates see ing with knowing.14 Like most classic documentaries, wildlife documentaries rely on narrative to construct meaning from disparate shots of nature, and to allow for viewer identification. In point of fact, wildlife films conform to most of the tenets of classical documen tary as we now understand them: the creative ma nipulation of real images carrying with them highly charged ideological texts. As Cynthia Chris notes, animal documentaries and television are always in formed by ideology: "The wildlife genre in particular, and the extra-media discourses that inform it, are sites of both purposeful ideological work and uncon scious elaboration of beliefs so normalized as com mon sense - about nature, animals, race, gender, sexuality, economic and political formations ...".15 Only in recent years, as a result of "reality shows" have cinema v?rit? techniques crept into the formal and technical arsenal of wildlife filmmakers, yet these, too, transport ideology within narratives. My goal here is to survey wildlife documenta ries that have been screened in theatrical and com mercial television contexts, while outlining the transformation of their master narratives in recent reality television programming from documentation to rescue. And while I briefly discuss theatrically released avant-garde films, I have consciously ex cluded from my discussion scientific and academic films about wildlife, since one of my lines of inquiry concerns the kind of anthropomorphism that has become ever more present in commercially pro duced wildlife images. Finally, I'm attempting to lo cate the transition from classic documentary forms to modern cinema v?rit? techniques, as manifested in much reality tv programming, given its focus on animals in captivity. The beginnings Even in the earliest actualit?s at the end of the nine teenth century, animals were subjects of interest. Oskar Messter, the pioneering German film pro ducer, lists four films with animal subject matter in his catalogue of 1898: Auf dem H?hnerhof {On the Chicken Farm), Junge L?wen im Zoologischen Garten {Young Lions at the Zoo in Berlin), Die zahmen Affen mit ihrem W?rter {Tame Monkeys with their Trainer), and Der dressierte indische Elephant {A Trained Indian Elephant) As indicated by its title, the first film was shot on a chicken farm, and, like numerous other titles in this category from the United States and France, was probably conceived as a way of presenting urban audiences with scenes of farm life. Edison, as well as Siegmund Lubin and American Biograph, also shot films on an ostrich farm {Ostrich Farm at Pasadena, 1901), since at the time there was an attempt to create a market for ostrich meat.17 Selig, meanwhile produced a series of approximately sixty films in the Chicago stockyards, which visual ized the industrialized process of animal slaughter and meat packaging (e.g. Koshering Cattle, 1900). The other three Messter titles mentioned above were shot in a zoo (probably the Berlin Zoo). As in the case of other actualit?s, the goal was not so much the scientific observation of animal behavior as the creation of interesting views, especially for audi ences far from urban zoological gardens. As Kerstin Stutterheim notes, filming in zoos would become a tradition.18 Some of the most well-known animal documentarians in Weimarer Germany and the Third Reich were either former zookeepers or zoologists, including Lola Kreuzberg, Wolfram Junghans and Ulrich K.T. Schulz, all of whom then raised animals or established film zoos, in order to produce their documentaries more efficiently. Filmed zoos had become a global phenomenon by the turn of the</page><page sequence="5">Wildlife documentaries: from classical forms to reality TV 463 century. The Lumi?re Brothers shot Lion, London Zoo (1895), Biograph produced Pelicans at the Zoo (1897) and Elephants at the Zoo (1898), while Path? Frer?s (Au jardin zoologique, 1904) and Gaumont (Zoo at London, 1906) distributed their own zoo pictures. The catalogue description for Edison's Scenes at the Zoo (1904), probably a dupe of the Path? film, indicates the character of these early films: "After a procession of elephants, wild beasts are shown in their cages. A zookeeper teases a lion with a stick".19 Filming animals in a zoo was, of course, much easier and more convenient than chasing them in the wilds with a camera, especially since telephoto lenses had not yet been invented. As Stutterheim notes, the filmmakers actually believed that animals would behave in a zoo the same way that they would in the wild, a notion that is now considered scientifically untenable.22 The Monkey's Feast (Biograph, 1896), for example, pictures two monkeys eating bananas, but the fact that they are tame and living in a zoo is left unsaid. The producer William Selig established a film zoo and jungle in Lincoln Park, Los Angeles, in 1909, almost at the same time that the American film industry began to move the center of its operations from the New York-New Jersey area to southern California. Selig's wildlife films were extremely popular both domesti cally and internationally, whether outright fakes, like Hunting Big Game in Africa (1909), or imbedded in fictional narratives, e.g. Pansy: The Story of a Bear (1912), Capturing Circus Animals in the African Wilds (1913).21 Perhaps, of more importance than the actual existence of zoo films, is the fact that the scopophilic relationship between humans and animals in a zoo is visually reproduced in such films. In most zoos, animals remain at a distance, framed by their cages, just as the viewfinder of the camera places animals on display for visual inspection. As John Berger reminds us, "The zoo to which people go to meet animals, to observe them, to see them, is in fact, a monument to the impossibility of such encounters" ,22 Berger is referring to the fact that as a result of modernity the schism between man and nature has grown to such an extent that our attempts to "expe rience" animals in zoos are doomed to failure. While humans in previous centuries lived with animals, imbuing them with both real and symbolic signifi cance, humans have now been completely sepa rated from the animal world. They have become mere objects of scopic desire. One of the oddest zoo films was undoubtedly Lyman H. Howe's Wild Animals' Impression of Music (1909), which was shot at the Washington Zoo in September 1909. Howe's cameraman filmed the re actions of zoo animals listening to various sounds, which Howe captured and played back in the pro gram with his own sound system.23 A mixture of science and vaudeville, the approach was also com mon to actualit?s of circus and vaudeville animals, who appeared repeatedly in early films as an attrac tion. Lubin, for example, distributed Carlisle's Trained Dogs (1904) as well as Cake Walking Horses, Feed ing the Rhinoceros, and Burlesque Cock Fight. The last three films were shot during a visit of the Fore paugh-Sells Circus to Philadelphia in April 1902. As early as 1894, W.K.L. Dickson and William Heise photographed Professor Harry Welton's trained ani mals in Edison's Black Maria Studio in Orange, NJ: The Wrestling Dog and Boxing Cats. The latter is a thirty-second film showing Welton manipulating two cats with boxing gloves on their front paws in such a way that they are seemingly fighting one another while standing on their hind legs. Violent spectator sports, such as cock fights, also proved to be ex tremely popular in the cinema's earliest years, pos sibly because such fights were banned by many municipalities. Edison's crew had filmed at least two different cock fights in 1894, shooting the roosters in front of black velvet and then a white canvas, in order to make them more visible to the camera.24 Another film topic that became saleable inter nationally, after audiences tired of the initial actu alit?s, were films that depicted the hunting of wild animals. As in the case of cock fights or elephant executions, such films offered bloodthirsty pleasures to those audiences seeking them out. Hunting films also offered ready-made narratives, since the ups and downs of stalking, finding, and killing animals was inherently dramatic. Path? Fr?res distributed a whole series of such hunting films which they sold well beyond the borders of France, including Une chasse a Tours blanc {Hunting the White Bear, 1903), Hunting the Hippopotamus (1909), and Hunting Sea Lions in Tasmania (1910). However, as Mitman has pointed out, hunting films often had a conservationist aspect to them. For example, the production of Roosevelt in Africa (1910), which documented Teddy Roosevelt's year-long hunt netting over 40,000 "specimens" for the taxidermist's knife, was financed by the Smithsonian; like other hunting films, it was supported by naturalists.25 Such hunting films,</page><page sequence="6">464 Jan-Christopher Horak Fig. 2. The cover of Martin Johnson's Camera Trails in Africa (New York: Century, 1924). whether shot in Africa, South America, Asia, or on a Hollywood back lot, connect to a long tradition of safari films, as can be seen from the extreme popu larity of Paul Rainey's African Hunt (1912) as well as the Osa and Martin Johnson films in the 1920s and 1930s, including Trailing African Wild Animals (1923) and Congorilla (1932).26 Simba: The King of the Beasts (1928) shows the couple tracking a lion for a whole year in East Africa. Naturalists, however, de cried the crass commercialism and outright fakery of the Johnson films: "For them, the preservation of wildlife on film served as a lasting record for future generations of a natural heritage that was being erased by modernizing forces of civilization".27 Showing evidence of a more scientific charac ter was a German film, produced by Oskar Messter in 1900, Der Film der fallenden Katze (Film of a Falling Cat), in conjunction with Prof. Dr. Spiess of the Berlin Urania. Demonstrating a cat's ability to always land on its feet, the experiment repeated a similar film made by Jules-Etienne Marey in 1884.28 Charles Urban (London) also produced a series of short actualit?s, which, based on their titles, reveal a sci entific impulse: Circulation of Protoplasm in Water weed (1905) and Circulation of Blood in a Frog's Foot (1907). Both probably consisted of shots taken with a microscope, which would have provided a view not visible to the human eye and therefore could poten tially be of interest to nickelodeon audiences. Urban had distributed a series of fifteen scenes under the title The Busy Bee as early as 1903, which visualized every phase of bee keeping, including the gathering of a bee swarm, the construction of a beehive, and the search for flowers.29 Bees remained a favorite subject for educationals, particularly in Germany. After World War I, the Germans in fact became leaders in the production of scientific wildlife docu mentaries, thanks to the founding of the UFA'S "Kul turfilm-abteilung" (Documentary Unit) in 1918.30 In the beginning, the unit only had enough funds to shoot small animals in a studio. By 1921, the UFA was producing as many as twenty wildlife shorts a year, including Raupenstudien {Caterpillar Studies), Seidenspinner {Silk Spinners), Der Rapsglanzk?fer {Rapeseed Beetles), Der Kohlweissling {Cabbage Butterfly), Unser Hausstorch {Our Stork on the Roof), Der Mehlk?fer {Flour Beetle), Der Zoologische Garten in M?nchen {Zoological Garden in Munich). A similar series was produced in the United Kingdom, "Se crets of Nature" (1922-33, British Instructional Films) by Percy Smith, Mary Field and Bruce Woolfe.31 As the partial list above demonstrates, the animal stars were for the most part common insects that could be filmed in a studio terrarium, and which would have been well-known to German audiences. Stutterheim notes: "Until the middle of the 1920s, animal docu mentaries were primarily concerned with native ani mals, known to local audiences, but with the help of modern film techniques their lives were shown in a way that would have been invisible to the casual wanderer in the woods".32 In 1923 the Kulturfilm makers purchased a telephoto lens, allowing them to capture on film wild animals in natural habitats.33 One of the UFA's most successful films in America was Mungo, der Schlangent?ter (1927, Ul rich K.T. Schulz), which was released by Paramount under the title, Killing the Killer. Shot in a terrarium, the film shows a mongoose killing a cobra. Many of the shots were taken in slow motion, in order to better visualize the mongoose's ability to jump out of harm's way. Despite the ferocious look of the cobra, the film ends with the mongoose burrowing its sharp claws and teeth in the back of the snake. The film was so popular that it not only remained in distribution for decades, but a fragment was also cut into Para mount's feature film, The Letter (1929, Jean de Limur), starring Jeanne Eagels.34 The UFA also broke new ground in the use of microscope cinematography. As early as 1920, Fritz</page><page sequence="7">Wildlife documentaries: from classical forms to reality TV 465 K?hler produced Der Wasserfloh (The Water Bug). After the UFA constructed a studio, complete with microscopes, other films followed, including Mikrok osmos im Reiche der Natur (Microcosm in the King dom of Nature, 1924, Ulrich K.T. Schulz).35 Meanwhile, in other parts of Europe microscopic films found an appreciative audience among the emerging film avant-garde. Dr. Comandon studied a water flea for ten years in France, producing a short film, Dytiscus (1925); the film was shown at the London Film Society, one of the earliest cine-clubs.36 In Holland, J.C. Mol began production of scientific films with microscopic views in 1924, which were regularly shown in the programs of the Dutch Film liga, and in 1928 were screened in the famous Paris avant-garde cinema, Studio 28. Avantgardists recog nized the aesthetic proximity between the abstract, "absolute film" and Mol's work, including Zwerfto chten door een waterdruppel (Life in a Drop of Water, 1928), Uit het rijk der kristallen (In the Kingdom of Crystals, 1928) and Strijdin hetinsectenleven (Battles in Insect Life, 1930). They pointed out that the micro scope camera view revealed scenes hidden from the naked eye, constructing a uniquely cinematic image, while displaying the abstract beauty of nature.37 Simi larly to Mol's films, the scientific underwater films of Jean Painlev? were critically received as little master pieces of avant-garde cinema, including La Pieuvre (The Octopus, 1928), Les Oursins (Sea Urchins, 1929) and Microscopie ? bord d'un bateau de p?che (Microscope Aboard a Fishing Boat, 1936). Georges Sadoul wrote about Painlev?'s films: "This former doctor understood how to raise the photography of microbes and the tiniest forms of life to a real art; ... With the help of a film camera and micro lenses he discovered a foreign, romantic world, which resem bles the abstract paintings of Kandinsky".38 While German nature films from the Weimar Republic depicted the struggle for survival in Darwin ian terms, wildlife documentaries made during the Third Reich transported ideological and racist con tent, which directly contradicted the scientific theses formulated by Charles Darwin. Especially in films like Der Ameisenstaat (The Ant Colony, 1935) and Der Bienenstaat (The Bee Colony, 1937), analogies were drawn between the social efficiency of these animal species and the German fascist state. Stutterheim notes in reference to the latter film: The commentary to this film is formulated in military jargon, the language of discipline and M^WW&amp;^fWf ^v- . "'A order clearly underscores the societal anal ogy. The little state of the bees is organized in a manner in which the National Socialists would like to have theirs organized - every member takes his appointed role, without wor rying about the meaning or purpose of his actions. Each role is fulfilled, even if certain death is the predictable outcome."39 In fact, while the production of wildlife films flourished in Germany thanks to its ideological func tion as metaphor for nationalist and fascist mes sages, the genre languished in 1930s America, the victim of repeated scandals, as those swirling around Osa and Martin Johnson.40 Like the Nazi films, many wildlife documenta ries made by European and American filmmakers in the first half of the twentieth century were primarily concerned with visualizing animals that would have been familiar to local audiences from their immediate surroundings and could also function as expressions of nationalist sentiment. This was also true for the Swedish filmmaker, Arne Sucksdorff, who, in a series of films produced between 1941 and 1957, created intimate portraits of the animals of his native country. For En sommarsaga {A Summer Story, 1941) Sucksdorff photographed wildlife around a small lake during one Swedish summer. The Swedish film historian G?sta Werner comments on the film: "The individual images are not only beautiful, they are romantic and glowing in their dreamy beauty. At the same time, they are surrounded by a dense aura of Fig. 3. Det Stora ?ventyret (The Great Adventure, 1953), directed by Arne Sucksdorff.</page><page sequence="8">466 Jan-Christopher Horak 7 Fig. 4. Disney True Life Adventure photographer, Stuart Jewel. fantasy".41 In The Hunterand the Forrest (1945), on the other hand, Sucksdorff is concerned with the brutality and ruthlessness of nature in a winter land scape, a theme to which the filmmaker will be repeat edly drawn. In his magnum opus, the feature length Det Stora ?ventyret (The Great Adventure, 1953), the director depicts a whole year in the life of a Swedish forest by taking the subjective view of two farm chil dren who have rescued an otter. Letting the audience experience the various seasons through a child-like subjectivity, the film tends to a certain degree of anthropomorphism, which is particularly prominent in the musical accompaniment. The composer, Nils Gustav Orn, in fact received exact instructions, prac tically from image to image, as to what kind of music should be heard in conjunction with the many animal characters in the film.42 The scenes with actors not withstanding, Sucksdorff was still primarily focused on the visualization of various forest animals, which he spent two years documenting in the woods. Posi tioned somewhere between the lyrical romanticism of his first film and the horrific "eat or be eaten" view of his later nature shorts, The Great Adventure be came a worldwide box office hit.43 American wildlife documentarians, too, stayed close to home. Shortly after the end of World War II, Walt Disney inaugurated a hugely successful series of "True Life Adventures", in which nature in the continental United States is depicted. The series got off the ground with On Seal Island (1948) and Beaver Valley (1950), both shorts directed by James Algar, who would carve out a niche for himself as Disney's nature specialist, producing many of the subsequent films in the series. There followed the feature-length documentaries The Living Desert (1953), The Vanish ing Prairie (1954) and White Wilderness (1958), which established a definite Disney style in this genre and virtually monopolized the nature film market in 1950s America.44 Other nature films copying the Disney style were the Irwin Allen productions, The Sea Around Us (1952) and The Animal World (1956). The last named feature attempted a history of animal life on the planet, beginning with the dinosaurs, created by special effects director Ray Harryhausen, and moving through to the present, often utilizing stock footage to save production costs. The Living Desert begins with endless Techni color images of an arid and dry desert landscape in Death Valley, consisting of sand, stone, and burning sun. But as narrator Winston Hibler tells the audience a few moments later, nature creates life even in the desert in ways that are often gruesome, sometimes beautiful. What follows is a series of little docu-dra mas, involving turtles mating, a tarantula family, wild boars, and various snake species, etc. The film is edited in a classical Hollywood style, creating unities of space and time where none exist, and constructing synthetic stories out of heterogeneous filmed mate rial, stories which position the subject within the drama and allow the audience to believe that the events occurred in nature as filmed. While Disney's publicity may have touted the fact that Disney cam eramen spent months in the wilds to capture a par ticular animal or mating ritual on film, the truth probably lay elsewhere. They were certainly equipped with the best technical apparatus and had unlimited amounts of raw film at their disposal, allow ing them to produce at fantastic shooting ratios, but in fact the direction occurred primarily in the editing suite. The music on the soundtrack is also matched perfectly to the images, supporting in an often hu morous fashion the "human interest" angle of the stories, which function primarily through the device of anthropomorphism. For example, in one se quence we hear and view a square dance while two scorpions complete a mating ritual, or we hear a "tarantella" in a scene with tarantulas. Such cute musical accompaniments were demanded by Walt Disney personally, e.g. in reference to the turtle se quence he wrote to the producer: "They look like knights in armor, old knights in battle. Give the audi ence a music cue, a tongue-in-cheek fanfare".45 Meanwhile, the narrator drones on over each</page><page sequence="9">Wildlife documentaries: from classical forms to reality TV 467 and every sequence, explaining the obvious to the viewer, continually emphasizing that this is all part and parcel of the great arc of life and death in nature. The natural world is presented as autarkical, follow ing only its own laws. However, at the same time, the film glosses over the more gruesome aspects of nature, creating a harmonious vision of nature through editing, music, and commentary. Viewers are encouraged to root for one species over another, while identifying with the cuter animals through an immature anthropomorphism, and thus downplaying the mysteries in nature.46 This leads to what Steve Baker has called the Disneyfication of all animal life in our culture. Animals, reduced to mere images, are made stereotypical and stupid: "The image of the animal seems to operate here as a kind of visual shorthand, but a shorthand gone wrong, a shorthand whose meanings intermittently veer from or turn treacherously back upon that of the fuller form of the text".47 Of course, Disney was not the first to engage in this kind of anthropomorphism for commercial ends. Bouse complains that once sound was avail able the British wildlife filmmaker Cherry Kearton had committed unpardonable sins by having his animals "talk".48 The Disney style influenced virtually every wild life film made for theatrical release or television in the next twenty years. The influence of human civilization on the natural environment was not yet an agenda item, even though interstate highways (invisible in the film) already criss-crossed Death Valley at the time of The Living Desert's production. All this would change at the end of the 1960s with the arrival of an ecological movement in the political landscape. Wildlife documentaries after 1970 With the establishment of an ecological conscious ness in the last thirty years, modern societies have become acutely aware of the endangered environ ment, leading not only to an expansion in the number of wildlife documentaries being produced, but also to the setting of wholly different agendas in their narratives. While in classical animal documentaries nature was depicted as an autonomous entity, unaf fected by the hand of humanity, with scientists and explorers only appearing as observers who enter into an alien sphere, modern films have created a very different paradigm. Nature's harmony has suddenly been thrown out of whack. Nature is now being destroyed by humans, while environmental factors in turn seemingly threaten man and civilization. More and more often wildlife documentaries make the point that animals are disappearing from the natural environment as quickly as man expands into former wildlife habitats. Ever more wildlife documentaries focus on the establishment and maintenance of ani mal parks and reservations, in which animals can roam freely and are subject to visual display. As in the case of classical zoos, but on a larger scale, such parks allow humans to experience animals visually and in a mediated fashion; the observer views ani mals from a distance and often through binoculars, just as the telephoto lens of a film or video camera captures animals in its viewfinder. The reestablish ment of a balance between untouched regions of the globe, in which nature can take its course without hindrance, and the agricultural and industrial devel opment of land hardly seems possible anymore. Seminal in this respect was Walon Green's The Hellstrom Chronicle (1971), which disseminated the sensationalist thesis that humanity was not only on the brink of destroying the environment, but also itself. Only the world of insects would survive, be cause they have been genetically programmed to survive the worst nuclear and environmental holo causts. The film is narrated by a supposed scientist, Dr. Hellstrom, played by an actor who articulates the film's thesis in no uncertain terms: Insects are pre sent at the beginning and at the end of the evolution ary cycle, because they are thoughtless followers of their own instincts, and because for 200 million years they have continually improved the perfect military machine. While human civilization has formed and deformed its environment, insects simply adapt to every new situation and are thus able to survive every kind of human or natural catastrophe. And they are big eaters. Insects are thus direct competitors to human beings, since the planet can only produce so much food. In conjunction with these apocalyptic theses which helped the film become a huge box office success, The Hellstrom Chronicle presents extremely graphic and impressive images: Hun dreds of red and black ants on a battlefield fighting for the corpse of a bee; millions of locusts in Africa who within minutes turn a lush green landscape into a desert; billions of army ants forming a fifteen mile long column, overrunning and eating every living thing in their path; two queen bees fighting to the death for control of a hive; mayflies dancing their nightly mating ritual, laying eggs, and expiring. Util izing extreme close-ups and highly saturated colors, the film displays a world both beautiful and terrifying.</page><page sequence="10">468 Jan-Christopher Horak Again and again the film points to the fact that hu manity is the only species not living in tune with the natural environment, while insects are super-at tuned, often changing colors or behaviors within a few generations, in order to better fit in. The insect world lives only to feed, to reproduce, and to die, while human beings always behave egoistically. Civi lization still has the upper hand, but not for much longer, the film claims. In the same year that The Hellstrom Chronicle opened, Blue Water, White Death (1971), directed by Peter Gimbel, appeared as the first of many films to deal with the great white sharks. As the title indicated, the film depicted an animal who represented both a mystery and a mythical threat to man. The great white shark is stylized as a symbol of the unbridled violence I in nature, just as Steven Spielberg would in his fic tional feature film, Jaws (1975). However, much of the film visualizes the hunt of several divers for the great white shark, while only the last reels of the film actually show audiences underwater footage of the shark. As is the case with many modern documen taries, the line between real and fictional scenes is purposely blurred, in order to stoke the fears of the audience. The film offers a vision of nature that is both unpredictable and uncontrollable, while attempting in its final scenes to prove the opposite. The demonization of sharks is, of course, an attempt to control nature through anthropomorphism at a time when it seems that civilization has lost all control over the environment. A regressive film like Animals Are Beautiful People (1974) by Jamie Uys must also be seen against this background, since it pretends in the best Disney fashion to introduce the Kalahari Desert and its wildlife to movie audiences. As in The Living Desert, the filmmaker succumbs to the temptation to anthropomorphize every creature depicted, whether through narration, musical ac companiment or editing. Tchaikovsky's "Nutcracker" serves as a background for gazelles jumping and Baboons dancing, while the bobbing heads of os triches visualize Bach's "Toccata", Smetana's "Vltava" provides acoustics for crocodiles swimming in the river, and Wagner's "Meisters?nger" gives a cloudburst mythic stature. The triviality of these mu sical analogies is on par with the banality of showing almost every animal in the desert behaving just like I a human being, whether a porcupine that has lost its mommy or a mother duck that manages to theatri cally distract a hyena from her own brood by playing a wounded animal. According to Bouse: "... the portrayal in wildlife films of the animal's family and social relations presents a kind of vast Rorschach pattern in which culturally preferred notions of mas culinity, femininity, romantic love, monogamous mar riage, responsible parenting, communal spirit... can all be read".49 Furthermore, the fact that much wildlife feeds on other animals to survive would have been too disturbing for the film's intended young audiences. Apart from the death of numerous little pelican ba bies that get stranded and are unable to fly away when a desert lake dries out, death has been banned from the film. The natural law of eat or be eaten remains invisible, since most of the animals depicted are vegetarians. Clearly, every animal is portrayed as a cute little toy, while parents need not fret about their offspring seeing violent images of nature. Signifi cantly, the native Bushmen are shown in an equally patronizing fashion as funny little human beings with out a lot of clothes. The animal kingdom is thus camouflaged as a harmonious paradise, and as the narrator notes: "In paradise, even the worms are cute". At the other end of the spectrum we find a film like The Animals Film (1981), produced in the United Kingdom and directed by Myriam Alaux and Victor Schonfeld, which depicts the planet as one huge, man-made slaughter house and/or experimental laboratory in which animals are tortured to death. As narrator Julie Christie notes, capitalism breeds many more animals than are actually needed, in order to maximize profits. Animals suffer unbearable pain, e.g. when the beaks of chicks are removed, so that they can be squeezed together in mass cages with out pecking each other to death. Even though twenty grams of vegetable protein is necessary to produce one gram of animal protein, Americans, in particular, insist on excessive portions of meat, a dietary con cept that they would like to propagate even in vege tarian cultures, such as India, thanks to the global domination of McDonalds. The latter corporation makes an appearance in a scene in which the film makers document the production of a hamburger commercial. Meanwhile, millions of animals are sac rificed for scientific research, even though the film makers maintain that many fewer animals would be necessary to achieve the same results, e.g. monkeys are exposed to deadly doses of radiation, as are donkeys and pigs, even though the effects of X-rays have long been known and scientifically studied. Other monkeys are exposed to deadly doses of LSD.</page><page sequence="11">Wildlife documentaries: from classical forms to reality TV 469 FT ay Hfl-_pg Fig. 5. Animals Are Beautiful People {WA), directed by Jamie Uys. Japanese footage demonstrates medical experi ments in which a dog's head and legs are attached to the back of another dog. Finally, the film points to the fact that Americans abandon twenty million house pets a year, who then of necessity land in the gas chambers of the humane societies for lack of families willing to adopt them. Furthermore, 250 mil lion animals are hunted and killed by either hobby hunters or professionals working for the fur industry. Never has so much blood flowed in an animal docu mentary. Much more consumable for television audi ences was the twelve-part television documentary series produced by Keenan Smart and David Atten borough for the British Broadcasting Company, The Trials of Life: A Natural History of Behavior (1990), which depicted nature in complete harmony in terms of its structural logic. The film theorizes a planetary system in which every force is matched by an equally powerful counterforce, while human beings are de picted as a relatively insignificant element in this system. The production of the series took more than two and a half years, during which Attenborough supposedly traveled 250,000 kilometers. Wildlife on the planet is minutely dissected, from the tiniest fleas to the largest primates, as the titles of the individual thirty-minute episodes clearly indicates: 1. Arriving, 2. Growing Up, 3. Finding Food, 4. Hunting and Escaping, 5. Finding the Way, 6. Homemaking, 7. Living Together, 8. Fighting, 9. Friends and Rivals, 10. Talking to Strangers, 11. Courting, 12. Continuing the Line. The narrative structure of each part remains the same, because the filmmakers are most inter ested in visualizing the myriad solutions for survival that evolution has brought forth, the almost countless forms of life on the planet. In "Hunting and Escaping" Attenborough first points to birds that eat the eggs of other birds, who are in turn hunted and swallowed whole in mid-flight by even larger sea birds. Next, the viewer experiences sea lions going to shore to bear their young, and in the process are attacked by killer whales, who literally throw themselves onto the shore, in order to capture their prey and consume them. In the ocean the oreas play with sea lions like cats with a mouse. However, larger or stronger spe cies don't always prevail. For example, a particular species of frog simulates the sounds of cats in order not to become the victim of a possum, while sala manders and skunks secrete poisonous odours to similar effect. Next Attenborough introduces animals that hunt in groups, whether army ants or chimpan zees, who surround and capture smaller but faster monkeys. After the society of chimpanzees manages to capture their prey, all of them, including the fe</page><page sequence="12">470 Jan-Christopher Horak males and children who have not taken part in the I hunt, let out a victory hoot. Attenborough concludes: blood lust and team work is also a sign of human activity. And because these primates are so close to humans on the evolutionary chain, the scene has an uncanny feel to it. On the other hand, signs of human civilization are completely invisible in the series, apart from Attenborough as on camera host. Typical, not only for this particular BBC series, but for wildlife docu mentaries in general over the past twenty years, the narrator is no longer heard from off camera, but s/he relays her/his impressions to the audience by directly addressing them on camera. Influenced by cinema ! v?rit?, filmmakers foreground their own activity, in order to also convey a sense of immediacy and reality, even when much of the surrounding footage is still captured by traditional documentary means. In | other words, documenting nature is communicated to be a subjective experience, whereby the narrator directly relates all the difficulties involved in the pro duction, rather than leaving that task to the publicity department. During the chimpanzee hunt, for exam ple, the camera focuses both on the monkeys giving chase, as well as on the narrator Attenborough huff ing and puffing, in order to keep up with the hunting party. Filming is thus integrated into the "adventure". The narrator establishes a personal relationship with the animals, as well as with the viewers by maintain ing eye contact with the camera. The narrator's sub jectivity becomes that of the audience. This technique is especially effective in films where the narrator is directly appealing to the audi ence to support the work of naturalists and filmmak ers, e.g. in Orangutans: Grasping the Last Branch (1991), made by David Root and Evelyn Gallardo. Shot in the jungles of Borneo, in areas where the last known Orangutans still live in the wild, the film com municates a horrifying message to the viewers: Due to massive clearings of the primal forest, the num bers of orangutans has shrunk to a few thousand. Soon they will only survive in zoos. The narrator, Betty Thomas, begins her story of the orangutans with her own involvement: In 1985 she journeyed to Indonesia to see these animals in the jungle, before "they are finally exterminated". Since, unlike gorillas or chim panzees, these primates do not live in social organi zations, but rather as solitary individuals, they are particularly susceptible to attack. As the film docu ments, the orangutan babies are captured and sold to zoos in Eastern Europe or to individuals as pets, with as many as half of them dying in transport. The J mothers are usually killed, in order to capture the babies. Business is good. An orangutan baby I bought from natives in Indonesia for $400, usually can be sold in the international black market for | $40,000. The film closes with a plea to create political pressure to stop the deforestation of the orangutan's natural habitat. The same filmmakers could be seen in Sep tember 2003 on the cable network Animal Planet in the program "Jungle Orphans", in which they rescue orangutan mothers and their babies. The filmmakers track down orangutans that are being held captive as pets and either purchase them from the owners I or free them from their captivity by slightly less than j legal means. The animals are then cared for, and I eventually brought to a wildlife refuge in the Indone sian jungle, where they live in close proximity to other freed orangutans. It is one of many "reality TV" pro grams on Animal Planet, which feature animals being rescued from intolerable conditions. It is in fact a strategy of commercial television to create rescue scenarios that feed into a collective imaginary, while suturing over the perceived trauma of the inevitable extinction of many animal species. Animal TV In 2006, American television offers animal documen tary programming almost 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Founded in 1996, the cable television net work Animal Planet consists exclusively of animal shows, which in terms of their narrative construction and style not only mimic regular television fare, but even parody it.50 Animal Planet broadcasts news and magazine programs ("The Most Extreme on the Planet"), variety programs ("Pet Star"), crime dramas ("Animal Cops, Houston"), reality shows ("Jeff Cor win Experience"), comedies ("The Planet's Funniest Animals"), hospital soap operas ("Emergency Vets") and family programs ("That's My Baby"). In the "Star Search" styled "Pet Star", we see trained animals do their tricks for the camera, with contestants compet ing, as if on "American Idol", while viewers vote for which animal makes it to the next round. In "The Funniest Animals", amateur videographers send tapes of their favorite pet tricks. A young moderator introduces the videos with a few jokes, and then provides a running commentary over a laugh track. Twenty per cent of air time consists of commercials for products that speak to animal lovers, including cat and dog food from Purina, or Meow-Mix. Insur</page><page sequence="13">Wildlife documentaries: from classical forms to reality TV 471  Fig. 6. Dolphins: The Wild Side, a 1999 television documentary directed by Paul Atkins. anee commercials for Mutual of Omaha recall its long-standing sponsorship for one of the most fa mous animal programs of the 1960s and 1970s, "Wild Kingdom". Wendy's hamburgers are for peo ple, but the new Subaru fits more than a few dogs, who need animal vitamins and the many varieties of flea collars. National Geographic Television offers a similar program of animal documentaries, sand wiched between their traditional geography pro gramming: "Crittercam", "Dogs With Jobs", "Be the Creature", "Living Wild", as well as many animal documentaries in their series "Classic Geographic". Apart from the fact that such programming is primarily created for entertainment while pretending to serve broadly educational purposes, what many of these animal series have in common is an almost obsessive involvement with animal rescue, during which pets are saved and given new masters or wild animals are placed in zoos and/or wildlife refuges. At the local level this narrative is played out in "Animal Precinct" (2001-05), a weekly reality series which followed the exploits of the animal police in New York City. The statistics which introduce each episode are impressive: "New York, 8 Million human beings, 5 Million pets, exactly ten paid animal control officers". In other words, the animal cops are totally under staffed and completely over-worked, but they do their best to rescue animals in the big city. Each episode is an amalgamation of little melodramas in a reality TV format: a kitten locked into a store; an emaciated dog sleeping in its own feces in a box; a Chihuahua with a whole catalogue of ailments, whose owners can't afford a veterinarian. It is reality television in the streets and housing projects of New York. Viewers are warned at the show's beginning that they might witness horrific scenes of animal cruelty. However, such scenes are diffused by the constant insertion of advertising, addressed to ani mal lovers, so that each story must have a happy end to keep consumers pliant. The dogs recover at the animal hospital, while the perpetrators are arrested and other animals find new homes and adoptive parents. Rescue arrives every week. In "Animal Cops: Houston" (2003-05), also broadcast on Ani mal Planet, the action is moved from the ghettos and boroughs of New York to a completely different American landscape, namely Texas along the Gulf of Mexico, while "Miami Animal Police" (2004-) visual izes the Florida adventures of animal control officers. While the flat dusty suburbs and subtropical environ ments present viewers with a different set of prob lems, the stories are often similar and invariably end in the rescue of some cute little animal. Other Animal Planet programs that play out the trope of animal rescue are "Adoption Tales", which focuses on finding new owners for stray dogs and an occasional sea otter, "Amazing Animals Ultimate Rescue Special", "Animal Miracles" (2001-), and "Emergency Vets " (1998-).51 In every case, animals are rescued on a one-by-one basis (that is, in the</page><page sequence="14">472 Jan-Christopher Horak U^ JSP^? Fig. 7. Disney's 777e Vanishing Prairie (1954), directed by James Algar. private sphere with private means), thus giving view ers a sense that society is making progress in this sphere and deflecting any discussion of collective political action to save the environment. In "Awesome Pawsome" (2000) the rescue is narrativized in slightly different form: four white tiger kittens are raised as house cats, so that as adults they will play with their keepers in a zoo. The viewer experiences their first birthday. Despite now being full sized tigers, they behave like overgrown kittens, in stead of like wild animals from the jungle. Again and again a narrator off camera emphasizes that if these "cats" create sympathy in viewers and zoo visitors, then maybe tigers in the wild will not be doomed to extinction. In this non sequitur it is not clear just how this is to occur, or what the connection is between "tame" tigers in zoos and wild tigers in nature, pos sibly because the camera remains exclusively fo cused on the cuddly tiger children. The rescue of tigers from extinction, this program, too, tells us, is a matter of setting up zoos and wildlife parks. In "Crocodile Hunter Diaries" (2002) Animal Planet vis ited the large private zoo of the late Steve Irwin, who became a celebrity through his show and his insur ance advertising. Both Steve's wife and new child were also actors in the show. Indeed, Iwin made newspaper and television broadcast headlines when on camera he held his baby in one hand, while feeding a crocodile with the other, thus exposing the baby to an unnecessarily dangerous situation.52 But mostly this show dealt with house-keeping matters in Irwin's Australian zoo, like training camels not to spit at guests or cleaning a forty-foot python, while in his other show, "Crocodile Hunter", he went out in the wilds to get up close and personal with all manner of wildlife. Similarly, "The Jeff Corwin Experience" (2001-) resembles classic wildlife hunting documen taries in terms of narrative, while the cin?ma v?rit? reality-TV format allows the narrator to address the audience directly and foreground the mechanics of the "hunt". Shooting seemingly off the cuff, the "sci entist" searches for exotic animals in the jungle, in the desert, or in other dangerous wildlife settings, and captures his experience on digital video. Corwin demonstrates and talks directly to the camera/audi ence, oftentimes holding animals to point out physi cal characteristics or behavior quirks. Wearing khaki shorts and boots, Corwin in one episode hunts down the most poisonous snakes in Mexico, ostensibly to gather venom for scientific research. At the begin ning of the same program, Corwin films an old man who has lost a finger, toes, and a leg to a snake bite. The focus on the dangers of hunting/filming is of course a staple of the genre, going back to the silent period. Furthermore, poisonous snakes are appar ently particularly attractive to viewers, since another Animal Planet show, "Venom ER" (2004), centers on a snake bite unit in Arizona, while National Geo graphic features "Nature's Most Dangerous Killers". Asageneral manager ?or Animal Planet noted, "There has to be something incredibly exciting every few minutes".53 In contrast to traditional wildlife documenta ries, then, in which the explorers or animal wranglers remain invisible, the hosts of these shows directly address the audience, animals in hand. The result is the illusion of a personal relationship between audi ence and animal through the medium of the narrator. Television consumption thus not only directly estab lishes an intimate relationship between animal, audi ence, and on camera narrator, but also creates the illusion that these animals have now been rescued at least digitally. One may then justifiably ask, to what degree do wildlife documentaries on television or on movie screens contribute to a change in consciousness about the natural environment, whether they appeal to the political conscience of the audience or not? As demonstrated in this essay, it appears that the great majority of broadcast and cable television program ming dealing with animals and wildlife is produced exclusively for entertainment purposes, and not to motivate the electorate to change the US govern ment position on, for example, the Kyoto Agree</page><page sequence="15">Wildlife documentaries: from classical forms to reality TV 473 ments. In other words, animal documentaries, par ticularly on television, have no other ambition than to allow for the consumption of images (of animals), interspersed with advertising for products bought by animal lovers. Anthropomorphizing animals is a simple strat egy to further identification with the idea of animals, which, however, does nothing more than create a renewed desire for the continued consumption of animal images. So the Disneyfication of animal im ages through extreme anthropomorphy continues unabated and in fact has been naturalized through new digital technologies. While Cherry Kearton, Walt Disney, and Jamie Uys were merely adding voices to wildlife, digital manipulation now allows filmmakers to "animate" animals, so they not only are heard, but also seen talking. For example, a commercial re leased during the 2005 Baseball World Series shows various nocturnal animals, including owls, rats, and a snake (all filmed with an infra-red lens), singing the pop tune "All Night Long", in support of a new caf feine-laced soft drink, Mountain Dew MDX, and end ing with the tag line: "Be Nocturnal". Without the soundtrack, these images could be mistaken for a nature documentary on nocturnal wildlife, but are we to actually read them as iconic or simply as cute images, drained of any reference to the real world? In fact, real animals are here semantically reduced to animal toys for consumption rather than observation. While much animal programming discusses the near extinction of many wildlife species, solutions to end the slaughter of wildlife are limited to exclu sively private forms of action: single animals are rescued and then placed in zoos or wildlife refuges. At best, a program or film may make an appeal to support the World Wildlife Fund, Greenpeace or other philanthropic organization dedicated to ani mals. What is rigorously excluded from such discus sions, however, is any debate about the political methodologies and strategies necessary to turn the tide of government policy or change the parameters of acceptable behavior in society, whether in the United States or Third World countries, where eco nomic development always takes precedence over concerns about the environment. The catastrophic situation of wildlife on the planet remains hidden or is repressed, because the reality is too horrible to contemplate in an entertainment media. Thus, the popularity of wildlife documentaries has been increasing steadily over the last one hun dred years, and seems to be expanding on television in inverse proportion to the number of animals sur viving on the planet. The seemingly insatiable de mand for such programming originates in several competing impulses. Originally such commercially released wildlife documentaries, especially those that explored unknown or inaccessible environ ments, satisfied the curiosity of audiences and the desire for exotic images. Today, the migration of nearly extinct animal species into the digital world can be seen as a virtual rescue from the uncomfort able reality of the natural world. The trope of animal rescue is obsessively played out in the sphere of the private, allowing audiences to feel as if progress is actually being made, while the more difficult larger questions go unanswered. In the digital world of animals, viewers glimpse the exotic and the familiar, the dangerous and the uncanny, the sweet and the cute, while anthropomorphism allows viewers to con sume both the cute and the threatening without dis comfort. While the parameters between scientific films and programs with an entertainment character were relatively visible in classic documentaries, the boundary has all but disappeared on Animal Planet, National Geographic and other programming dedi cated to "infotainment". As it was at the dawn of cinema over 100 years ago, fiction and reality, authenticity and fantasy now exist on virtually the same plane, i.e. animals will continue to "live" in images. Notes 1.

Abstracts Wildlife documentaries: from classical forms to reality TV, by Jan-Christopher Horak For nearly eighty years, filmed images of the natural world conformed to the classic documentary aesthetic: Such images were perceived to be an expansion of human vision, a means of entering into a world that was invisible to the human eye. Today, the impulse to document nature is augmented by the much higher stakes endeavor of "preserving" animal life in a virtual world. Looking over the precipice of an earth depopulated of its wildlife, the goal of nature filmmakers becomes the capture of animals, at least in images, so that society and science have a record of what was lost.</page></plain_text>
