<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Changing Landscape I find myself less concerned about the occasional warping of rational priorities that comes about be- cause of public fondness for crises - real or per- ceived - or about the only gradually evolving philo- sophical conceptions about our proper relationship to the natural environment than I am about our ability to get usable handles on the most pressing long-term problems. I believe it is true that the public and politicians tend to focus on the latest crisis and that some of the perceived dangers have much less substance than others. However, it is equally the case that our political system in general fails to operate unless goaded by crises. At such times, action long thought desirable becomes possible. The challenge, for politicians, the media, scientists, and public in- terest organizations, is to focus the attention gener- ated by unfolding events into meaningful, cost-ef- fective policy decisions. As we try to shape the degree and nature of our intervention in natural processes, new approaches and new measures of success will aid our deci- sions. Setting aside small parcels of land without recognition of natural boundaries will no longer be judged sufficient. We must now "manage" entire landscapes, with a focus on protecting biological diversity, landscapes that include areas that are left relatively undisturbed as well as land in which some human activities are allowed. As we lurch from one crisis to another, doing our best to develop sensible public policy and to avoid the pitfalls of undesirable anthropomorphic views of our relationship to nature, we must find ways to focus sufficient energy on bringing human population size back into balance with available re- sources. This challenge will come to occupy hu- man endeavors for the next several generations and must include major changes in political, eco- nomic, and religious institutions.
