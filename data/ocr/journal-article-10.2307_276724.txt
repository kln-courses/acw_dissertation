<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY detail. I (Smith, 1950) have presented a summary of the data from the same site. Fort Massapeag is the only aboriginal fort known to have existed on western Long Island. All of the forts on Long Island seem to have been more or less contemporary, dating from the mid- dle of the 17th century. In terms of the McKern classi- fication, Fort Corchaug is a manifestation of the Fort Corchaug focus of the Shantok aspect; Fort Massapeag belongs to the Fort Massapeag focus of the East River aspect. Both aspects are assigned to the Northeastern phase of the Woodland pattern. Solecki mapped Fort Massapeag in May, 1937 (So- lecki, unpublished field notes). The existence of his map was unknown to me when I surveyed the site with the assistance of Robert E. Fieux in November, 1938. A compass and 100 foot tape were used in making both maps. When plotted to the same scale they differ only to the extent that the bastions appear slightly larger on Solecki's map. In preparing Figure 28 the maps of 1937 and 1938 were superimposed; the map represents a compromise between the two. The Department of Public Works map indicates that the south and east sides may have been more irregular than shown here. As may be seen in Figure 28 the enclosure is almost square with projecting bastions at the northwest and southeast corners. Measurements taken from north to south and from east to west are nearly identical, ap- proximately 100 feet. At the time the maps were made the average depth of the ditch as seen on the surface was one foot. A natural rise in ground appears to have been selected as the site for the construction because the enclosed area is approximately six inches higher than the level ground surrounding the fort. The seem- ing absence of the ditch at the southeast corner may be attributable to encroachment of refuse upon the ditch from the shell heap on the south side. The break in the ditch at the northeast corner probably marks the entrance to the enclosure. Extending east and south from the bastion at the northwest corner is an embank- ment of earth rarely exceeding eight inches in height above the level surface of the interior of the fort. Test excavations within the enclosure failed to reveal evidence of human activity. Refuse in the form of marine shells mixed with stained earth, animal bones, debris resulting from the manufacture of wampum, worked stone, potsherds, and objects of European manu- facture was concentrated in the form of a low mound outside the enclosure on the south side. The shell heap had been disturbed by the haphazard activities of relic hunters and the sample obtained in our excavations was small. A limited excavation at the southwest corner by George Peters some 20 years ago revealed 4 posts, from 6 to 10 inches in diameter just inside the ditch and following the west wall. From the absence of refuse within the enclosure and its concentration out- side I conclude that the fort served as a refuge rather than as a fortification surrounding habitations.

PICTOGRAPHS OF THE SAN LUIS REY BASIN, CALIFORNIA The San Luis Rey River flows westward across north- ern San Diego County, California. The area from Henshaw dam down to and including the Bonsall post office can be described as the central San Luis Rey River basin. It includes a little less than half of the total watershed area but contains many tributary streams and probably accounts for more than half of the total runoff. The area is mountainous and wooded or brush covered and is dissected by numerous small streams, many of which originate in the higher elevations of the Agua Tibia and Palomar mountain ranges. Ample water supplies and favorable thermal zones which belt the area, coupled with a heavy growth of forest cover along the streams, provided both vegetal and animal food supplies which in turn resulted in more than average aboriginal population. The heaviest concentrations of population were in the areas now known as Pauma Valley, Rincon, The Potrero, and the La Jolla area, all of which still have sizable Indian populations living on reservations. In historic times, the region was occupied by Indians of the Luisefio stock (Kroeber, 1925, p. 648). The pictographs described herein are located within this central basin of the San Luis Rey. A total of 15 pictograph sites was recorded in this area by the writer. Detailed descriptions of the sites are on file at the University of California at Los Angeles. The heaviest concentrations of sites are at Pauma, Rincon, and the Potrero. This concentration of pictographs is due to the large number of Luisefio village sites found in this relatively small area, and partly to more extensive survey efforts in this area. It appears likely that there is at least one pictograph location for each village site. Of the former the majority conform closely to ethnographic descriptions. Most pictographs are located some distance from the village site on isolated boulders or rock outcrops. The remain- der are at the village sites or occupation areas and in small cave shelters. Most sites are found on the rocky *The author wishes to express his appreciation to C. W.

Generally they are less than one hundred feet above the stream level or village level and in some cases are found at stream level, although in some isolated instances they are found higher on the hillsides. There does not seem to be any preferred direction that these paintings must face since they are found facing in almost every direc- tion as regards both the compass and the village sites. However, there were undoubtedly requirements for lo- cating the paintings other than that they should be conspicuous and on suitable rock surfaces. To date no information on this problem has appeared, and there are many suitable locations and rock faces which fulfil all known requirements but lack the paintings. Gran- itic bedrock intrusions make up the greater part of the exposed boulders and rocky ridges, with the dense weather resistant stones standing exposed on hills and slopes of decomposed granite, or on residual clay soils of granitic origin. The majority of the paintings are found on these dense exposures with a few being found on a metamorphic rock found in pegmatite dike expo- sures. The paintings found on the rather coarse-surfaced stone are usually found in cave shelters or on overhangs, while the exposed paintings are nearly always on granite boulders. Most of the boulders are streaked with a travertine- like deposit or a reddish stain, and the best of the painted areas are found on the deposits or stains. De- sign elements on any given rock will usually range from clearly discernible elements on the stained areas to faint illegible blurs on the bare rock surfaces. It is likely that the presence of the mineral deposit provided a base into which the pigments could penetrate, thereby preserving the paintings. The association between pictograph sites and known Luisefio village sites is clearly visible by the manner in which these sites fit the ethnological descriptions. The relatively nonpermanent nature of the medium is such as to eliminate, in almost every case, any ideas regarding pre-Luisefio painting of the pictographs. There is no evidence to date to indicate pictograph painting by any prepottery Luisefio occupants of this area. The associ- ation of these pictographic representations with certain distinctive ceremonials gives us one of the few cases in which explanations of petroglyph origins exist. In- dians in other petroglyph areas usually deny knowledge of the designs and in many instances appear to be afraid of them. Here then we evidently have a documented association between petroglyphs and their makers. The earlier ethnological accounts disagree on many of the details surrounding the ceremonies with which these rock paintings are associated, but they all agree on the general custom with which the majority of the known sites conform. This is the use of pictograph paintings as part of ceremonies that are concluded by a race, in which the participant, or a relative, ends by painting a design on a previously designated rock. Kroeber's earlier account reports: The conclusion of the girls' period of restrictions at puberty was marked by paintings made by them on the smooth surfaces of large granite boulders. These paintings, some of which can still be seen, especially near the old village sites, consist of geometrical arrangements of lines in red, usually in patterns forming vertical stripes several feet high. After making her painting, a girl was again free to eat meat and salt. The paintings were called yunnish (Kroeber, 1908, pp. 175-76). A variation within the ceremonies is noted in Kroe- ber's later account, but he again mentions the geomet- ric designs and the race. The girls accompanied by friends, thereupon run a race, another ceremonial device of which the Luisefio are fond. The chief's wife again paints them. With the same paint she makes a large geometrical pattern upon a rock, or according to another account, the girls themselves do so. This face and rock painting is per- formed monthly three or four times (Kroeber, 1925, p. 675). Strong again cites a variation in the ceremonial pat- tern, but describes the same general customs as the others, and also describes the design elements in a similar way. The sand painting ceremony closed with a race, called hayic (or hayish) to a certain rock. Here a relative of each girl stood with red paint, and as each girl arrived she painted a design on the rock. According to Yela Wassuk any design was permissible, but other informants said such designs were always diamond shaped and represented the rattlesnake. The known rock paintings of this type at Rincon and La Jolla are geometric with a preponder- ance of diamond shaped designs (Strong, 1929, p. 299). Sparkman's account does not mention details of the race or rock paintings but does link the paintings of pictographs to the girls' puberty ceremonies. The ma- jority of the paintings were probably made in connec- tion with these rites, but pictograph painting is also described in connection with the boys' ant ordeal cere- mony which is part of their Toloache initiation. A pat- tern similar to the girls' puberty 'race appears to apply in this case also and is referred to by both Du Bois and Strong. A race was then held by the candidates, probably similar to the races made at the time of the new moon; and the winner of the race painted in the designated place with red and black paint (Du Bois, 1908, p. 92; cf. Strong, 1925, p. 317). In addition to the ant ordeal, the Toloache ceremony itself may have included pictograph painting, but the only ethnographic reference to this is a conjecture made by Du Bois (1908 p. 84). Inasmuch as the Cupefio and Serramo Toloache ceremonies were closed by such a race it is not at all difficult to imagine that the Luisefio also, at one time or another, included the race and pictographs in their Toloache ceremonies. Strong cites Du Bois' opinion and, although lacking direct evi- dence, admits the possibility of such a race by the Luiseio (Strong, 1929, p. 316). Descriptions of both the girls' puberty rites and the boys' ant ordeal cere- monies easily correspond to observable patterns of pictograph sites found in the San Luis Rey basin. There is little doubt that the Luisefio confined their petroglyph activity to the painting of pictographs as no authentic pecked designs or elements have been found in their territory. In the painted pictographs found, the colors are limited to red and black with red being the dominant color. Du Bois indicates that red, black, and white 69</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY colors were used (Du Bois, 1908, p. 96), but no white painting has been found on any site yet. Kroeber cites the use of red paint (Kroeber, 1908, p. 175-6), while Strong mentions the use of red in connection with the girls' puberty rites, and the use of red and black in the boys' ant ordeal ceremony (Strong, 1929, pp. 229, 317). The reds vary in shade from rather deep brick reds to somewhat faded orange tints. These variations in color must be considered in terms of paint formula variations, the rock surfaces on which the paint is placed, the degree of weathering, and the relative age of the painting. Of the paint itself, little is known except from ethnological accounts. Sparkman describes it as being made of a certain pigment obtained from springs on Mount Palomar, mixed with turpentine (made from pines on Palomar) and with an oil base made of an extract from the seeds of the Chilicothe (Echinocystis Macrocarpa). It is probable that the seeds were ground and the oil extracted at the site of the paintings since nearly every site has many of the vines growing around the base of the painted rock. The presence of this plant is not conclusive evidence, for this is a common plant in the region. However, its presence on nearly every site checked so far does tend to strengthen the ethnological descriptions of the paint ingredients. The seeds and paint pigments are de- scribed as being ground in a small mortar made es- pecially for this purpose. This mortar, Tamya-mal, is described as being polished and almost exactly round (Sparkman, 1908, p. 207). To date not one of these has been found on or near any of the pictograph sites. They do exist however, and were more than likely buried with other ceremonial devices by the person in charge of the rites. A modern Luisefio informant indi- cates that such ritual objects were hidden or buried by chiefs or medicine men. On many of the sites small bedrock mortars are found which were probably used in a manner similar to the Tamya-mal. This type of bed- rock mortar is also found in association with painted petroglyphs farther north on the western slopes of the Sierra (Mallery, 1889, p. 54). All ethnological sources agree that animal fats were not used in the paints, and these earlier accounts re- garding paint constituents are further substantiated by a chemical analysis of pigment taken from painted rocks. This showed that the pigment for red was ferric oxide and for black, manganese oxide (Harrington, 1933, p. 142). When used in red paint the chilicothe kernels were toasted, but not charred, prior to being ground. For black pigment they were charred and roasted on a piece of burning oak bark, after which they were pounded up fine and mixed with the ground manganese oxide (Harrington, 1933, p. 142). The iron oxide is obtained from hydrated hematite which is found in local rocks and the scum from cer- tain springs. This scum consists of depositions by bac- teria; in the summer it is gathered by the Indians, dried in the sun, and then burnt on a slab of oak bark (Quercus Kellogii or other local oak species). For detailed descriptions of these bacteria and the proces- ses involved in their use as paint pigments see Har- rington, 1933, pp. 141-44. Other materials were used for paints ethnographically, but these were not of the permanent nature of the pigments just described and they are not found on any of the sites. Such materials as soot, charcoal, clay, and ashes could not be ex- pected to survive for any length of time on exposed rock faces. Steward has defined southwestern California as a dis- tinctive petroglyph area (his area C). He describes the characteristic elements as follows: They stand apart from zig zags found elsewhere, not only in being painted and assembled in a characteristic manner but because they are connected with the girls' puberty ceremonies. In this region zig zags are combined in many ways. Generally there are several groups. These are made up of a number of parallel zig zags placed close together, or of zig zags superimposed in such a way as to form chains of diamonds. The color is almost invariably red. Their distribution falls entirely in southern California .... Few other designs occur in this area (Steward, 1929, p. 203). Fenenga's later report describes the design elements somewhat further and characterizes them as being dom- inated by red painted petroglyphs of geometrical forms in linear arrangement, especially chains of diamonds and parallel rows of zigzag lines. These are found on the vertical faces of isolated boulders (Fenenga, 1949, p. 2 and fig. 1). 9 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 II 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 - ( 4i;TuX W * 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 19 2\ \ 0 . . . :: 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 28 38 39 40 41 42 44 43 x X 45 DESIGNS IN RED :- DESIGNS IN BLACK Elements not to scole. FIC. 29. Pictograph design elements, San Luis Rey basin, California. 70 [ 1, 1954</page><page sequence="4">FACTS AND COMMENTS Simple geometric forms greatly predominate in the pictographs. Quadruped animal representations are absent and anthropomorphic figures are exceedingly rare, even including highly stylized figures which are rather dubious man-like representations. Spirals and snake forms, common in many other areas are not found. It is possible that some of the elements found in Luiseiio rock paintings represent the Chingichnich cult animal forms. The manner in which these paintings are directly associated with religious rites and the fact that many of the rites involved the use, in one form or another, of the cult animal forms leads to this con- jecture. One of the most commonly used forms in Chingichnich rites is the rattlesnake. The possibility that the diamond chain pattern represents the rattle- snake is suggested in Strong's account (Strong, 1929, p. 299). The diamond chain is the most common of all the elements used in Luisefio pictographs. In this survey of fifteen sites which form a representa- tive sample of all the known pictograph sites in the area, we find that there is considerable variation as regards the assembly of the typical chevrons, diamonds, and zigzags and also regarding the types of units in a given design. The recognizable variations total about thirty separate design elements. This does not take into consideration minor variations nor does it include the many blobs and blurs which occur on almost every site. Of these elements eight are identical to those Fio. 30. Distribution of pictograph sites, San Luis Rey basin, California. illustrated by Fenenga. (Fenenga, 1949, Fig. 2, design elements 8, 13, 14, 21, 23, 25, 26, 33.) There are three others that are similar but not identical to numbers 12, 22, 37 of Fenenga's Fig. 2. This leaves over twenty elements or variations which have not been previously reported and which represent less common petroglyph designs in Southern California. The elements found in this region can be separated into two general classes: those which are geometrical patterns and those which appear to represent natural forms. The geometrical forms make up the bulk of the paintings and can be divided into various units, the most obvious of which are the diamonds which make up the chains, the chevrons which make up the zigzag lines, simple crosses, X's and straight lines assembled in vari- ous ways. The most common is the simple single line diamond unit (Fig. 29, 1). Variations of this element are shown in Figure 29, 2-7. The manner in which these diamond units are assembled is variable as to the size and number of units which are put together, but they are always assembled vertically to form chain designs (except when found as single motifs). Occa- sionally they are found inclosed in vertical lines. Chevrons which are combined to form the various zigzag line elements are found in several patterns (see Fig. 29, 9-15). The use of lines to create crosshatching, single vertical lines, single horizontal lines, and groups of both vertical and horizontal lines in some manner of assembly is common (Fig. 29, 16-19). Ladder forms are found, but are not common (Fig. 29, 20). Other single line forms are found occasionally (Fig. 29, 21-23). The double Y and a modification are found only occa- sionally (Fig. 29, 25, 26). The single lined circle and concentric circles or target forms are not common but have been recorded from several sites (Fig. 29, 32, 34). A more complex form of the circle or target element is found in the wheel form which is found only at site S.D. 151 (Fig. 29, 35). The use of small dots in vertical or horizontal rows is found on only one site so far (site S. D. 151), but at this site it is the dominat- ing element (Fig. 29, 36). A variation of this design is the cage-like enclosures containing elements which ap- pear to be figure eights (Fig. 29, 37). Further use of small dots is made in elements in which the dots are assembled in groups of six, into squares about one and one half inches across, and which are grouped in lines about three fourths of an inch a part. These groups are made into chains, usually straight but some- times having a curve on one end. Although elements that resemble natural forms are rare, a few such elements have been found. These are summarized as follows: 1. Tree-like figures, one of which has the tips of the "branches" tipped in black (Fig. 29, 27, 28). 2. "Sun figures" or elements with lines radiating from a central spot. These are widely distributed and are found with several variations (Fig. 29, 29-31). 3. A turtle-like figure at site S.D. 152 (Fig. 29, 39). 71</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY 4. Bird and insect-like forms at Potrero Indian reser- vation (Fig. 1, 40-42). 5. A figure which appears to be a palm tree at one La Jolla site (Fig. 29, 43). 6. Hand prints, which appear on several sites (Fig. 29, 44). 7. A possible schematic representation of a human at site S. D. 153. The visible portion extends from a rather confused mass of blurred elements. This prob- lematical figure represents the only anthropomorphic element from the region. Such elements as diamonds, chevrons, dots, and sim- ple line forms can be traced in petroglyphs throughout California and the southwest. It is only in the char- acteristic manner of assembly and the circumstances under which they were made that the pictographs of this area become especially distinctive. The distinctive use of the geometric forms and the almost complete absence of many elements common to other petroglyph areas cause the designs of this region to stand out in a comparative study.
