<plain_text><page sequence="1">PILGRIMAGE, MEMORY AND DEATH IN VLADIMIR NABOKOV'S SHORT STORY "THE AURELIAN"* Maxim D. Shrayer, Boston College The protagonist of "Pil'gram" ("The Aurelian," 1930), a German shop- keeper and entomologist, dies of a stroke at the threshold of his perfect dream. The fifty-year old owner of a butterfly store in Weimar Berlin, Pil'gram spends his entire adult life attempting to undertake a collecting trip to one of the regions renowned for its rich butterfly population. All of his attempts fail for various reasons: his poor health disqualifies him from being sent to the colonies during World War One; the post-war crisis de- stroys his hard-earned savings; his business deteriorates plunging him into debt. Finally, when Pil'gram has all but given up on his obsessive plan, good fortune brings him a rich collector, one Sommer, who buys from Pil'gram a major collection of lepidoptera. The sum would only allow Pil'gram several months of economical travel, but he embraces the salutory opportunity without hesitation. Leaving his pitiful wife Eleanor behind without a source of income, Pil'gram sets out to go to Spain. A fatal stroke (he had suffered one before) halts his journey. In the morning, Eleanor finds him dead sitting on the floor of his shop. Such is the outline of this fascinating story, the first since December 1928, which Nabokov wrote in ten days between March 10 and 20, 1930 in Berlin.1 Later in 1930, "The Aurelian" appeared in issue 43 of Sovremennye zapiski (Contemporary Annals) to become Nabokov's second short story featured in the best journal of the Russian emigration. "The Aurelian" elicited numer- ous reponses in emigre reviews, including a separate essay in a Parisian newspaper, Rossija i slavjanstvo (Russia and Slavdom).2 In his milestone study of Russian emigre literature, Gleb Struve referred to "The Aurelian" as one of Nabokov's best and most emblematic stories.3 Georgij Adamovic praised the story for its "economy of means" and absence of gratuitous ornamentation-the qualities the critic valued most.4 Nabokov included "The Aurelian" in his second collection of short stories, Sogljadataj (The Eye; 1938), and chose it as one of the first to be translated into English. The SEEJ, Vol. 40, No. 4 (1996): p. 700-p. 725 700</page><page sequence="2">Pilgrimage, Memory and Death in "The Aurelian" 701 translation was published in the Atlantic Monthly in 1941 and thereafter reprinted twice in Nabokov's original English-language collections.5 "The Aurelian" opens Nabokov's Middle Period and represents a turn- ing point in terms of its relationship between formal composition and pro- jected metaphysical outlook.6 In the final paragraph of "The Aurelian," the reader faces a textual opening that invites to follow the protagonist into his otherworldly journey. Although the otherworldly vistas in such early texts as "Rozdestvo" ("Christmas," 1924) or "Katastrofa" ("Details of a Sunset"; literally "The Catastrophe," 1924) anticipate the textual opening in "The Aurelian," only in the latter do we see a critical dichotomy be- tween the metaphysical opening, through which Pil'gram enters the other- world, and the closed physical ending, that tells of Pil'gram's death: Yes, Pil'gram had gone far, very far. Most probably he visited Granada and Murcia and Albarracin, and then traveled farther still, to Surinam or Taprobane; and one can hardly doubt that he saw all the glorious bugs he had longed to see-velvety black butterflies soaring over the jungles, and a tiny moth in Tasmania, and that Chinese 'skipper' said to smell of crushed roses when alive, and the short-clubbed beauty that a Mr. Baron had just discovered in Mexico. So, in a certain sense, it is quite irrelevant that some time later, upon wandering into the shop, Eleanor saw the chequered suitcase, and then her husband, sprawling on the floor with his back to the counter, among scattered coins, his livid face knocked out of shape by death. (Stories 254/ND 87) The paradox of "The Aurelian," its mesmerizing power, lies in the fact that as far as the plot goes, the narrative is over when the reader learns of Pil'gram's death. At the same time, the text of Pil'gram's otherworldly travels continues in the reader's memory. A narrative split occurs at the story's physical ending. Along with Pil'gram's dead body-symbolizing here the end of the plot-the reader leaves behind a near-linear narrative of a Buninesque type, Ivan Bunin being one of Nabokov's masters of the short story. On the one hand, like many a Bunin short story with a closed ending, "The Aurelian" ends with a stunning death. On the other hand, Nabokov's metaphysical text continues beyond its closed physical ending. The narrative split between the closed ending and the textual opening in "The Aurelian" corresponds to a complex inner split within Pil'gram's own existence be- tween his mundane "dreary" Berlin life ("berlinskim prozjabaniem") and the "phantom of perfect happiness" ("prizrakom pronzitel'nogo scast'ja"; S 193; Stories 248/ND 80). After the initial act of reading, Pil'gram's death records itself in the reader's memory as a distant recollection, while the text of Pil'gram's otherworldly dream goes on as he continues his longed-for expedition across Spain, South America, Ceylon, or eternity. In "The Aurelian," Nabokov foregrounds a new model of a short story which-from the point of view of the "ideal reader," the author's double in Nabokov's terms-never ends.7 My purpose in this essay is to inquire into the motif and design of</page><page sequence="3">702 Slavic and East European Journal entering the otherworld in the poetics of "The Aurelian." I will do so by considering first the ways the protagonist's characterization supports the story's acute dichotomy between the idealized otherworldly dimension that underwrites the structure of a textual opening, and the oppressive quotid- ian reality which warrants a closed ending. I will then explore pilgrimage not only as an allegory and a structural embodiment of Pil'gram's dream, but also a recurrent motif in Nabokov's life and oeuvre. My next concern will be with the Russian text's transformation from the draft to the fair copy to the final version, as well as the latter's revamping into an English- language short story. I will evaluate the extent to which the changes in the surviving Russian versions, but also the translators' decisions in the En- glish, shape the sui generis nature of the story's central motifs. Finally, I will assess the connections between the story and Nabokov's experience as an exile as well as his career as a lepidopterist. The two-world architecture of Pil'gram's existence is signaled to the reader as early as the first paragraph. Inscribed into the otherwise inconspicuous cityscape of a Berlin residential street, Pil'gram's butterfly store stands apart from the other shops surrounding it, "a fruitier's [. . .] a tobacconist's [. . .] a delicatessen" (Stories 244/ND 75). The passers-by-noticing the bright colors of the butterflies on display-would "stop for a second before that symbol of fair weather" (Stories 244/ND 75). They "would say to themselves, 'What colors-amazing!' and plod on through the drizzle. Eyed wings wide-open in wonder, shimmering blue satin, black magic- these lingered for a while floating in one's vision ["zaderzivalis' u nego v pamjati," literally: "lingered for a while in one's memory"] until one boarded the trolley or bought a newspaper" (S 185; Stories 244/ND 75). The centrality of memory in fixating the opposition between the radiant otherworld of butterflies and the mundane world of city routine is under- scored both in the Russian and English versions. The opening passage suggests that although beatitude may be only one step off the everyday route, very few individuals allow it to remain as part of their memory. The protagonist enters the space of the narrative through the door to his neighborhood pub where the street's other shopkeepers imbibe their daily dose of alcohol while also playing cards. Pil'gram, a "flabby elderly man with a florid face, lank hair, and a greyish mustache" (Stories 245/ND 76), enters the pub on Saturdays and undergoes his weekly routine of ordering rum, smoking his pipe, and watching the game. His is a familiar presence at the pub where no one suspects Pil'gram's otherworldly dreams. Although he may not blend completely with the other frequenters of the pub, he appears an integral part of their established existence. He is a "Herr Profes- sor," a more learned burgher, but a good old burgher all the same. He emblematizes a shopkeeper's sensibility, hard work during the week and a</page><page sequence="4">Pilgrimage, Memory and Death in "The Aurelian" 703 weekend's rest at the pub. He makes sure not to miss a chance at having "a go at [the owner's daughter's] elusive hip"; his jokes are rude and devoid of humor. He is mindful of clock time and checks his "thick silver watch" against the cuckoo clock. His Saturday pub ritual ends "punctually at eleven" (Stories 245/ND 76), after which he proceeds to his apartment where a brass plate on the door announces his name. As the reader follows Pil'gram into his apartment, more is discovered about his mundane existence. He resides in a "tiny dingy" apartment (Sto- ries 245/ND 76) with a wife to whom he has been married for twenty-five years. Very little seems to connect Pil'gram and his wife. In fact, the only word he ever says to her in the story is "that guttural 'Ruhe!' ['Be quiet!'] several times, more and more fiercely" (Stories 245/ND 77). Even Pil'gram's wife, faceless, loyal, and all-enduring, misreads his character. In fact, Nabo- kov's narrator stresses Pil'gram's singularity vis-a-vis his "butterfly" dream. The first authorial statement regarding Pil'gram's existing in two worlds appears precisely during a description of his sleep, the time-as some meta- physical systems believe-when a man's soul joins God: OH cnan Bceraa Ha CHHHe, HH3KO HaABIHHyB Ha jio6 HOqHOH KOJInaK,-H 3TO 6bIn COH no ma6noHy, npoqHbIH H IIyMHbIH COH naBOqIHHKa, Ao6poro 6ioprepa, H, rnsas Ha Hero, MO&gt;KHO 6bIJIO npeInoOJI&gt;KiHTb, qTO COH C TaKOH npHCTOHHOH BHeIIHOCTbIO coBepmeHHO nJIHIIIH BHaeHHH.

(S 189) ("He slept on his back with an old-fashioned night-cap coming down on his forehead; it was to all appearances the solid and sonorous sleep that might be expected in an elderly German shopkeeper, and one could readily suppose that his quilted torpor was entirely devoid of visions; but actually this churlish, heavy man, who fed mainly on Erbswurst and boiled potatoes, placidly believing in his newspaper and quite ignorant of the world (in so far as his secret passion was not involved), dreamed of things that would have seemed utterly unintelligi- ble to his wife or his neighbors. ..." (Stories 246/ND 77). Set against the gray oppressive background of all of the above, Pil'gram's inner life not only gives him, an otherworldly daydreamer, strength to lead a shopkeeper's existence, but also redeems him in the eyes of the reader. For Nabokov and his privileged characters, to recall the emblematic poem "Vljublennost' " ("Being in Love," 1974), the otherworld conflates love, the transcendent, and perfect memories in an open moment of blissful eternity: MbI 3a6bIBaeM, qTO BJIIo06JeHHOCTb He npocTo noBopoT uasa A noj KynaBaMH 6e3AoHHOCTb, HoqHas naHHHKa HJIOBua. ..Ha a,O B eHHOCTb HanoMHHaio, qTO BJIIo6eHHOCTb</page><page sequence="5">704 Slavic and East European Journal He iBb, ITO MeTHHbI He Te, LITO MOmKeT 6bITb nOTyCTOpOHHOCTb nlpHOTBOpHJaCb B TeMHOTe. (Stixi 317-8; LATH 26) The protagonist and narrator of the novel Look at the Harlequins! (1974), a Russian emigre writer, Vadim Vadimych, composes "on the night of [. . .] a more oblique, more metaphysical little poem" which he recites-first in Russian-to a young English woman named Iris. Below is Vadim Vadi- mych's English rendition of the poem: We forget-or rather tend to forget-that being in love (vlyublyonnost') does not depend on the facial angle of the loved one, but is a bottomless spot under the nenuphars, a swimmer's panic in the night (here the iambic tetrameter happens to be rendered-last line of the first stanza, nochndya pdnika plovtsd). [. . .] Now comes the last stanza of this philosophical love poem. [. ..] Napomindyu, I remind you, that vlyublyonnost' is not wide-awake reality, that the markings are not the same (a moon-striped ceiling, polosatyy ot luny potolok), is, for instance, not the same kind of reality as a ceiling by day, and that, maybe, the hereafter stands slightly ajar in the dark (LATH 26). In keeping with Nabokov's paradigmatic formulation of an otherworldly state in the poem "Being in Love," its seems fruitful to inquire into the meaning of Pil'gram's dream in terms of love, passion, and happiness. In- deed, his plan for a butterfly-collecting expedition is characterized as strastnaja meeta ("passionate daydream") and ljubov' ("love"), and referred to as seast'e ("happiness") nine times in the Russian text. The story's omni- scient narrator presents the history of Pil'gram's private otherworldly dream as originating in his childhood. Butterflies figure in Pil'gram's earliest child- hood memories: "[Pil'gram] ljubil babocek s tex por, kak suscestvuet" (liter- ally: "Pil'gram loved butterflies since he has existed"; S 191; note that Nabo- kov's use of the verb "to exist" cements the opposition between Pil'gram's otherworldly love for butterflies and his mundane existence). Pil'gram might have inherited a thirst for travel from his father, a "sailor, a rover, a bit of a rogue" (Stories 247/ND 78) and his mother, a Dutch woman from Indonesia. After his father's death, Pil'gram converted their colonial souvenir shop into a butterfly store with rich holdings and collections. He had had, the reader is told, several opportunities to start a more lucrative business, but clung to his butterfly trade as "the only symbolic link between his dreary existence and the phantom of perfect happiness" (Stories 248/ND 79-80). Very few out- side the closed circuit of entomologists, and none within his shopkeeper's circle, know that Pil'gram is a "first-class entomologist" (Stories 247-8/ND 79) with several discoveries and contributions to his credit. Remarkably, given Pil'gram's status as a butterfly expert, he has never left his native Prussia. His only experiences at butterfly-collecting were those limited to Sunday summer trips to the outskirts of Berlin. Waves of nostalgic childhood memories overcome Pil'gram during his little trips:</page><page sequence="6">Pilgrimage, Memory and Death in "The Aurelian" 705 [.. .] BCIOMHHaJI geTCTBO, HOHMKH, Ka3aBiHmec5 eMy TorAa TaKHMH Heo6bIKHOBeHHbIMH, H C rpyCTbIO CMOTpeJI Ha 6a6oqeK, Bce BHIlbI KOTOpbIX eMy 6bIJIHM aBHbIM-naBHO H3BeCTHbI, npoqHO, 6e3Hae/xKHO COOTBeTCTBOBaJII neH3a)sy,-HJIH se Ha HBOBOM KyCTe OTbICKHBaJI 6oJIbmyIo, rony6oBaTo-3ejneHyIo, IIepoxoBaTyIO Ha omIynb ryceHHYIy c MaJIeHbKHM cpap)opoBbIM poroM Ha 3afKe.

(S 192) "[.. .] and he would be reminded of captures that had seemed to him so miraculous in his boyhood as he melancholically gazed at the familiar fauna about him, limited by a familiar landscape, to which it corresponded as hopelessly as he to his street [this last clause Nabokov added in the English version; it recalls the opening description of Pil'gram's shop amidst the other ones on his street and augments the note of hopelessness]. From a roadside shrub he would pick up a large turquoise-green caterpillar with a china-blue horn on the last ring; there it lay on the palm of his hand, and [*] presently, with a sigh, he would put it back on its twig as if it were some dead trinket"; Stories 248/ND 79). In the English, Nabokov decided to tone down the Russian version's deeply lyrical recollection of Pil'gram's childhood discovery of a caterpillar, marked above with an asterisk. In a literal translation, the omission would read as follows: "he recalled finding the same caterpillar in his childhood,-feeling numb, mumbling words of rapture." Perfect childhood memories charge Pil'gram's life-long anticipations of a real collecting trip with ideal character- istics. His dream of perfect happiness consists in netting "the rarest butter- flies of distant countries, to see them in flight with his own eyes [ . .] and feel the follow-through of the swishing net and then the furious throbbing of wings through a clutched fold of the gauze" (Stories 248/ND 80). In a sense Pil'grim longs to regain the lost Paradise of his childhood-a leitmotif of Nabokov's works from the earliest stories to the latest, from the novels Glory (1931-32) and The Gift (1937-38) to Lolita (1955) and Ada (1969). Pil'gram refers to the possibility of a real trip as nothing other than scast'e ("happiness"). Like Germann in Puskin's "Pikovaja dama" ("The Queen of Spades," 1833) whose inflamed mind endows surrounding ob- jects with signs of "three, seven, ace," Pil'gram also sees everything in terms of the way it relates to his "phantom" of happiness. At one point, when he fails yet again to set out on a lepidopterological expedition, Pil'gram's savings, which inflation turns into worthless paper, are described as "real'naja sguscennaja vozmoznost' scast'ja" (S 194; literally: "real con- centrated possibility of happiness"). Unable to travel, Pil'gram cognizes and maps the world outside Prussia in terms of its butterfly population and relationship to his dream. Completely oblivious to anything except lepidoptera, Pil'gram creates in his memory an esoteric map of the world, a guide book to the space of his dream trips. In surveying his representative butterfly and moth collections, Pil'gram revisits the native region(s) of certain species. The English version omits two semi- nal sentences describing Pil'gram's "longing/yearning" ("tomlenie," in the</page><page sequence="7">706 Slavic and East European Journal Russian frequently used with sensuous connotations) for the places he has visited only in his mind: BcIKasI qyKcaa cTpaHa npeXcTaBJIaJIacb eMy HCKJOIOHTeJIbHO KaK poMHHa TOH HJIH HHOH 6a60OqKH,-H TOMJIeHHe, KOTOpOe OH npH 3TOM HCHbITbIBaJI, MO&gt;KHO TOJIbKO cpaBHHTb C TOCKOHi no poiHHe.

(S 196) ("He envisioned any foreign country exclusively as the homeland of one butterfly or another,-and his yearning can only be compared to a longing for one's homeland. He knew the world in his peculiar way, from a unique perspective, surprisingly clear and yet unattain- able for the others"). The importance of the notion of "longing for one's homeland" could not be overestimated given Nabokov's status as a Russian emigre in the 1930s and the story's appearances in emigre publications. In the Russian text, the word rodina ("homeland") figures in two different contexts. First it refers to Pil'gram's real homeland, Prussia ("vsju zizn' on prozil na rodine"; S 192), the territory which he tries to leave behind. Later, rodina refers to his ideal homeland, an enchanting moveable dreamscape inhabited with per- fectly beautiful butterflies. Although Pil'gram never "traveled farther than Peacock Island on a neigh- boring lake" (Stories 247/ND 79), he seems very much aware of the tremen- dous, almost prohibitive, differences between the dull familiar look of Prus- sian landscapes and the otherworldly landscapes of his "journeys." The atlas of his private trips via memory and imagination includes a variety of territo- ries including such famous sites for butterfly collecting as Digne in southern France, Ragusa (Dubrovnik) in Dalmatia or Sarepta on the Volga. Pil'gram has mastered the space of his projected journeys to the point of knowing their most intricate details. In his mind, he visits the Canary Islands, Corsica, Lapland, Italy, Spain, the Ussurian region in the Far East, Congo, Indone- sia, and many other lands. In Pil'gram's visions, the butterfly collecting sites are marked with signs of exceptionality, singularity, mysteriousness, and blissfulness. Lifting a stone to find "a plump sleepy moth of a still unde- scribed species" is described as "no greater delight" ("net bol'sego naslazdenija"; Stories 250/ND 82). Gravel in Italian gardens crunches "invit- ingly" ("tainstvenno," literally "mysteriously"). The Ussurian region is re- ferred to as "volsebnyj" ("magical"; "enchanted"). Thus, Pil'gram's unparal- leled atlas of world lepidoptera actually becomes a map of his own private otherworld created and preserved in his memory.8 Also noteworthy is the very language that Nabokov employs to map the dreamscape of Pil'gram's travels. Each ecological niche that Pil'gram visits, Corsica or Sumatra alike, centers upon a particular species of butterfly or moth: "[. . .] the Islands of the Blessed, where in the hot ravines that cut the lower slopes [. . .] there occurs a weird local race of the cabbage white; and also that other island, those railway banks near Vizzanova and the pine</page><page sequence="8">Pilgrimage, Memory and Death in "The Aurelian" 707 woods farther up, which are the haunts of the squat and dusky Corsican swallowtail" (Stories 250/ND 82). The lepidoptera color their native land- scape (or cityscape as in the case of mothing in Seville) with ethereal beauty, and transfer upon the surroundings their own phenomenal fea- tures. In the case of Pil'gram's lepidoptera, the very language that he uses charges the butterflies with anthropomorphic details. The Corsican swal- lowtail ("korsikankij maxaon") is described in the Russian as "smuglyj," literally "dark-complexioned," used exclusively in reference to human skin as in "smugloe litso" ("dark-complexioned" or "dark-skinned face"). Grass on an Alpine meadow is called "koltunnaja," which the Englished text renders as "matted" for the lack of an appropriate English adjective; in the Russian, "koltunnyj" derives from "koltun"="plica," a human hair dis- ease, and can mean "tousled" (as in "tousled hair"). Another species, a moth, is characterized as "tolsten'kaja" and "sonnaja" ("plump" and "sleepy"); both adjectives in the Russian are normally used in reference to people, not fauna. The English is of course not equipped with diminutives to the extent as Russian is; "tolsten'kaja" ("plump"), from "tolstaja" ("fat"), adds a great deal of affection to the description of the moth. The anthropomorphic characterization of Pil'gram's butterflies lays ground for a key statement regarding his communication with the lepidop- terological otherworld. When the rich collector Sommer expresses interest in purchasing a large collection, Pil'gram negotiates the price while also contemplating the particulars of his would-be journey: H Tenepb, TOHKO TOprySCb c 3oMMepOM, OH ounyuanj BOJIHeHHe, TaSKeCTb B BHCKax, 'epHbIe flITHa nIJbIJIH nepejn rJIa3aMH,-H HIpenJyBCTBHe ciacTbs, npejnIyBcTBHe OTbe3Ra 6bIno elBa BbIHOCHMO.

(added emphases; S 201-2) ("[And now, as he skillfully negotiated the price with Sommer, he felt excitement, heaviness in his temples, black spots floating before his eyes,-and a foretaste of happiness, foretaste of departure was almost unbearable; this sentence, omitted in the English version, is provided in my literal translation-MDS]. He knew it was madness; he knew he was leaving a helpless Eleanor, debts, unpaid taxes, a store at which only trash was bought; he knew that the 950 marks he might get would permit him to travel for no longer than a few months; and still he accepted it all as a man who felt that tomorrow would bring dreary old age and that the good fortune [literally: "happiness"-MDS] which now beckoned would never again repeat its invitation"; Stories 252/ND 84.) Pil'gram feels that the otherworld-the haven of perfect happiness- communicates with him, calls for him, summons him to undertake an expedi- tion. As with many of Nabokov's privileged characters, Pil'gram's contacts with the otherworld affect him physically. Earlier in the story, the reader learns about the liminal fainting spells that Pil'gram would go through when</page><page sequence="9">708 Slavic and East European Journal trying to imagine the tropics: "[ . .] nonbTKa ya Tya npHHKHyTb MexITOH BbI3bIBaJIa ceparte6HeHHe H xyBCTBO, HIIOTH HecTepniMOe, cnaRlKoe, o6MopoqHoe [. ..]" (S 198).9 Pil'gram's "pangs," his heart pains, link him with the otherworldly experiences of such characters as Ivanov in "Soversenstvo" ("Perfection," 1932), Vasilij Ivanovic in "Oblako, ozero, basnja" ("Cloud, Castle, Lake," 1937) or Pnin in the eponymous novel (1957). Nabokov's description of Pil'gram's imminent happiness points to an- other "butterfly" story, the early masterpiece "Christmas." In both texts, an otherworldly experience is presented as a butterfly imago coming out of a cocoon. Here is a comment by the protagonist of "The Aurelian": "Koraa HaKOHeg 3oMMep cKa3aji, ITO qepe3 TpH AHH iacT OKOHqaTeIbHbIm OTBeT, IlHJIbrpaM pemHJi, qTO MeqTa BOT cefiqac, ceHiac H3 KyKOIKH BbIJynIHTC5" ("When finally Sommer said that on the fourth he would give a definite answer, Pil'gram decided that the dream of his life was about to break at last from its old crinkly cocoon"; S 202; Stories 252/ND 84). In "Christmas," the metamorphosis occurs at the end of the story, amounts to a textual opening, and offers its protagonist a modicum of consolation. In "The Aurelian," whose English title derives from the now obsolete aurelia, a pupa or chrysalis, the metaphor of Pil'gram's lifetime dream-"about to break at last from its old crinkly cocoon"-awards a foretaste of his libera- tion at the end of the story. The "old crinkly cocoon" stands for Pil'gram's mundane existence, while he himself is that aurelia trapped and dormant inside the boundaries of its dark and narrow world. Coming out of the cocoon to become a beautiful butterfly allegorizes Pil'gram's dream of exiting the constraints of this world and entering the otherworld. The motif of pilgrimage is central in the signification of the protagonist's otherworldly journey. The name of the protagonist draws immediate atten- tion due to its foreign sound to a Russian ear. Nabokov's passion for dictionary research might have yielded a fitting name for his protagonist. "Pilgram" (or "pilgerame") is the Scots word for "pilgrim."10 In Russian, two different words are used, the native Slavic "palomnik" and the Latin- derived "piligrim." While an English speaker seems quite likely to appre- hend the pilgram-pilgrim connection, fewer Russian speakers might be able to sense that the name Pil'gram encodes pilgrimage. Since the story's commentators have not noticed the highly meaningful link, the evolution of the protagonist's name deserves a closer look. In the first, heavily marked draft of the story, Nabokov uses the name Karl Gruber.11 On the first few pages of the fair copy, Nabokov refers to his protagonist as Alfred Zommer (Sommer) but then decides to change it to Pil'gram, just Pil'gram without any first name. The fair copy has preserved Nabokov's changes: he heavily crossed out the name Sommer and corrected it to Pil'gram. The</page><page sequence="10">Pilgrimage, Memory and Death in "The Aurelian" 709 name Sommer was given to the rich amateur sent by destiny to buy from Pil'gram a collection of "those small clear-winged moths that mimic wasps or mosquitoes" (Stories 251/ND 83); the collector's name was originally Krechmar (Kretscmar)-the name of the German protagonist of the novel Kamera Obskura (1932-33).12 In the fair copy, the story also bears a differ- ent title, "Palomnik," which is precisely the native Russian term for "pil- grim." Nabokov must have put much stock into the title and its special relationship to the protagonist's name. The first draft contains no title whatsoever. In the fair copy, from which a typescript was presumably made and sent to Contemporary Annals, two alternative titles (or two words of a single earlier title) are so heavily crossed out that it is difficult to make out what lies underneath the heavy layer of ink.13 The final title, "Palomnik" ("The Pilgrim"), was written above the two crossed-out words. Beneath the titles Nabokov wrote rasskaz ("short story")-something he does not usually do in other manuscripts. Perhaps the ecclesiastically-charged title did not quite agree with Nabokov's authorial and fictional intentions; by adding a clear genre label he must have hoped to avoid his piece being taken for an essay on pilgrimage.14 Unfortunately, neither the typescript of the story nor the corrected proofs seem to have survived. My guess is that Nabokov changed the title to "Pil'gram" either at the stage of a typescript, or the galley proofs.15 In the English version, Nabokov changed the title from "Pil'gram" to "The Aurelian." The fact that Nabokov opted for such a rare word as "aurelian" bespeaks his authorial wish to maintain an aura of mystery about the story's title. In the English version of the story, Nabokov also added the first name "Paul" to the name "Pil'gram" on the brass plate of the protagonist's door, thereby converting "Pil'gram" into a last name. This circumstance may have had something to do with the fact that such a last name does exist in Germany and Great Britain. Several dictionaries of British surnames list Pil'gram as a possible variant of the name Pilgrim, originally given to someone who has made a pilgrimage to Rome or the Holy Land. A Ger- man Deutsches Namenlexicon also lists Pil'gram as a possible variant of a last name. Consequently, at least for English and German readers, the last name "Pil'gram" is a speaking name that also preserves an outlandish aura. As for Russian readers, the name "Pil'gram" is virtually unreadable while such a title as "Palomnik," which Nabokov rejected, would have obviated the meaning of the story. It was not surprising to discover therefore that the English version is missing a passage that suggest pilgrimage, but not as directly as would the Russian word "palomnik," had it remained the title of the story. The following long sentence-omitted in the English text-occurs as part of the narrator's lengthy explication of how Pil'gram maps the dreamspace of his journeys:</page><page sequence="11">710 Slavic and East European Journal ECJIH 6bI OH no6bIBaJI B KaKOH HH6ynb [sic] npociaBjieHHOH MeCTHOCTH, nIjIIbrpaM 3aMeTHji 6bI TOJIbKO TO, HTO OTHOCHJIOCb K ero Ao6bIme, cJIy&gt;KHJIO IJI Hee eCTeCTBeHHbIM ()OHOM,-H TOJIbKO Torja 3anoMHHJ 6bI 3peKTeoH, ecJIn 6bI c JIHCTa OJIHBbI, pacTyeiie B rJiy6HHe CBITHJIHIaa, cJieTeia IH 6biJia noAxBaqeHa CBHICTmiAHM caqKOM rpenecKa nRocTOnpHMe- IaTeJIbHOCTb, KOTOpyIO JIHIIb OH, cneIHaJsmcT, MOr OgeHHTb. (S 196) ("If he were to visit some renowned place, Pil'gram would only notice what relates to the objects of his collecting and serves as its natural background; he would only remember Erechtheum if a Greek rarity-which he alone could appreciate as a specialist-were to fall off an olive branch growing in the depth of the sanctuary and be caught by a whistling net.") Erechtheum is an ancient Greek sanctuary, the original temple of tutelary deities, situated on the North side of the Acropolis of Athens.16 As a holy place in ancient Greek cults, Erechtheum symbolizes a site of pilgrimage. The notion of pilgrimage is organic to the otherworldly dreams of Paul Pil'gram, the story's modern pilgrim. Pilgrimage implies a visit to a place with which one is already familiar through cultural memory. A trip to a holy place, be it Jerusalem, Rome, or Mecca, promises a pilgrim liberation from various burdens of his everyday existence. The goal of any pilgrimage, be it a sinful monarch's or a pious nun's, is to reach a space that is charged with the timeless presence of holiness. During a pilgrimage, a pilgrim matches up a set of expectations based on the information obtained via various sources (oral history, books, sermons, etc.) with the actual holy place s/he visits. Pilgrimages are said to have a purifying effect upon those who undertake them because they offer cognitive keys to one's existence. In the case of Nabokov's protagonist, the reader observes a kindred relationship between Pil'gram's earlier knowledge of the otherworldly spaces that he strives to visit and the physical realities of the actual locales. In the Russian version, the narrator explains that Pil'gram possesses a brilliant memory that stores a great deal of information about world lepidoptera. Based on his vast knowl- edge, and owing to his fine memory, Pil'gram has compiled in his mind a matchless map of his would-be pilgrimages. In anticipation of a real pilgrim- age after Sommer's visit, Pil'gram begins to examine a real map on the wall of his shop, "choosing a route, estimating the time of appearances of this or that species" (Stories 252/ND 84). Suddenly, we are told, "something black and blinding welled before his eyes" (Stories 252/ND 84)-a prefiguration of Pil'gram's fatal stroke. Thus, an anticipation of a real pilgrimage has a powerful impact upon Pil'gram. At this point, since the reader does not know the end of the story, s/he can wonder about the shock of recognition that Pil'gram would experience during his pilgrimage. The larger context of Nabokov's oeuvre yields at least one more major exploration of the motif of pilgrimage ("palomnicestvo" in Russian). The 1927 poem "Palomnik" ("The Pilgrim"), originally published in the Berlin newspaper Rul' (The Rudder) and later included in Nabokov's first collec- tion of stories and poems, Vozvrascenie Corba (The Return of Chorb,</page><page sequence="12">Pilgrimage, Memory and Death in "The Aurelian" 711 1930), bears a dedication to the critic Julij Ajxenval'd, a friend of Nabo- kov's and a fellow emigre. In the poem, the lyrical persona, probably an exile, travels in his mind to the country estate ("usad'ba") of his childhood where he stays amid perfect memories. At one point, the Nabokovian protagonist of the poem hears a summoning signal: 1H Torna ycJibimy: BCnoMHH-Ka pbijalIoiiHH BaroH H cqacTbe CTpaHHOrO IaJIOMHHKa, 'IbS MeKKa TaM, rae OH.

(VC 232/Stixi 197-8) ("And then I will hear: do recall/ the sobbing train car/ and the happiness of a strange pilgrim/ whose Mecca is where he is. 11 He used to rejoice, wandering around the world,/ around lakes beneath the moon,/ in thunderous train stations and a room/ in a hotel at night") One notices several parallels between the pilgrim's experiences in the poem and Pil'gram's in the story. I have spoken earlier about the marked use of the word happiness in "The Aurelian" to refer to Pil'gram's otherworldly expec- tations. The adjective "strannyj"-in reference to a pilgrim-also surfaces in the story: "strannye ljudi, priexavsie izdaleka" (S 196; literally: "strange people who have come from afar"). Finally, the image of a pilgrim in a hotel at night also enters into the text of the story: "[. . .] Pil'gram saw himself troubling the sleep of a little hotel [. . .]" (Stories 250/ND 82). In the story, Pil'gram's otherworld fills his room with its presence when a gray moth flies in through an open window. In the poem, the lyrical pilgrim walks to the window (heavily, like Pil'gram himself) through which some "bright foreign country" beckons him to enter its space: O, KaK HOTHHeT BApyr Ha apKylO Iyxc)K6Hy, B RaJIbHHHI nTb . ...

(VC 232; Stixi 198) ("Oh, how suddenly I would be drawn to the bright/ foreign country, to take a long trip...../ How I would shuffle heavily to the window,/ how I would wish to bring back || all those trembling, springtime things/ which wept inside me,/ and more perfect than any reality-/ is a dream about one's homeland.") This poem concludes that an exile's perfect dream of a distant homeland eclipses the real experiences ("jav' ") of visiting such a homeland. Travel-</page><page sequence="13">712 Slavic and East European Journal ing to one's homeland, charged with holy memories and thus akin to a site of pilgrimage, allows the poem's protagonist to realize the superiority of a moveable pilgrimage, the kind he used to undertake in his dreams, over a physical journey. The poem uses the noun "jav" ("wide-awake reality"), which would later figure in the poem "Being in Love" as Nabokov's pri- mary opposition between this world (jav') and the otherworld (potus- toronnost'). This, in turn, links the motif of pilgrimage in "The Pilgrim" and "The Aurelian" with Nabokov's larger project of writing the other- world. A pilgrim, the space of whose holy land is always with him-etched in his memory-does not need to set out on an actual physical pilgrimage.17 This is why the story of Pil'gram's pilgrimage to a perfect idealized home- land of his beloved butterflies ends the way it does at the narrative's culmi- nation, with Pil'gram's closed-ended death and open journey across the reader's memory. Nabokov's short fiction makes a leap between the loose texture of "Roz- destvenskij rasskaz" ("A Christmas Story," 1928) and the astounding power of "The Aurelian" (1930). Such an artistic transformation took a great deal of searching. Prior to "The Aurelian," Nabokov had not written any short stories for one and a half years. The hiatus, separating the Early and Middle Periods, gave Nabokov time to capitalize on the achievements of such stories as "Christmas" and "The Return of Chorb" and leave be- hind the emblematic shortcomings of "Kartofel'nyj El'f" ("The Potato Elf," 1924) or "Skazka" ("A Nursery Tale," 1926). Although the story took just ten days to write, the surviving manuscripts tell an extraordinary story. A comparison of Nabokov's edited first draft with the clean fair copy yields the first level of changes. Below, I would like to concentrate on those of Nabokov's artistic decisions that alter Pil'gram's characterization and the story's narrative structure. I have already spoken of Nabokov's decision to change his protagonist's name from Karl Gruber to Alfred Sommer to Pil'gram. Several changes-both large- and small-scale- emphasize Pil'gram's fixation upon his dream and enhance the motif of pilgrimage. In the first draft, Pil'gram and his wife are said to have tried to have children. Eleanor first had a stillborn baby, then a miscarriage, then an- other serious medical problem. Only then is Pil'gram reported to have "left her alone" ("ostavil ee v pokoe") after which for a while he betrayed his wife with an old seamstress. Such a cluster of prosaic details-had it indeed remained in the final Russian version-would take the reader's attention away from Pil'gram's otherwise monomaniacal nature. To use a different example, the first draft allows an insight into the shaping of the seminal formulation about Pil'gram's butterfly store as the only link between his "dreary" mundane existence and the otherworldly "phantom of perfect</page><page sequence="14">Pilgrimage, Memory and Death in "The Aurelian" 713 happiness" (Stories 248/ND 80). Originally, Nabokov described the space of Pil'gram's longed-for pilgrimage as "ziv[oj] entomologiceski[j] ra[j]" (literally: "live entomological paradise"). As Nabokov's otherworld was becoming more and more sui generis, he experienced a growing need to write it without relying on readily-available formulas. A reference to an "entomological paradise" would have simplified and literalized Nabokov's metaphorical private codes. Hence Nabokov's decision to leave out a refer- ence to paradise, a traditional religious concept. One more important editorial decision is related to the entomological sign system in the story. The first draft contained an epigraph from the second stanza of Afanasii Fet's often-anthologized poem "Babocka" ("The Butter- fly," 1884): "He cnpauiHBaH: oTKyja nosBHiaacb?/ Kyya cnemy?" ("Don't ask: whence I come?/ Where I hurry?").18 Apparently, Nabokov originally intended to keep the epigraph in the fair copy but then changed his mind- after writing out the first verse-and marked it out diligently. Nabokov knew Fet's heritage intimately and would later translate three poems by Fet into English.19 Although Nabokov omitted the epigraph from Fet in his final version, he did leave a covert trace of the poem. While not disrupting the unity of the text, the following Russian sentence uses Fet's motif of a breath- ing butterfly as a subtext. The sentence is omitted in the English text: [.. .] rjiinbrpaM SCHO nonyBCTBOBaJI, ITO OH HHKorna HHKyja He yeneT, nojyMaJI, ITO eMy CKOpO ISITbaeCIT, 'TO OH AOJIaCeH BCeM COCeAIM, ITO HeneM nJIaTHTb HaJIOr,--H eMy nIOKa3aJIOCb IHKOH BbIIyMKOH, HeBO3MOKHbIM 6pejoM, qTO cefiqac, BOT B 3TOT MHr, cajHITCS IO)KHas 6a6o0Ka Ha 6a3aIbTOBbIir OCKOJIOK H 1RbIUHT KpbIJInbMH. (S 199) ("Pil'gram felt it clearly that he would never go anywhere; he thought that he was going to be fifty soon, that he owes all the neighbors, that there is no money to pay taxes,-and it seemed a wild fantasy, an impossible delirium that right now, at that very moment, a southern butter- fly descends onto a basalt rock and breathes with her wings").20 Two important changes signal the growing perfection of Nabokov's poet- ics. In the first draft, one finds a passage-omitted in the fair copy-which describes the logical steps Pil'gram undertakes in preparation for his depar- ture. He purchases a convenient suitcase (in the final version he ends up using his father's old one). He goes to the local precinct to "sign out." He goes to the consulates of the countries he hopes to visit (France, Spain, etc.). Although such preparations may indeed be necessary, the focus on the minute details of Pil'gram's preparations make his trip look like one of the tourist excursions that he vehemently resents. Reading the final Russian version, the reader is never completely sure whether Pil'gram is indeed planning a real trip. The reader wonders whether Pil'gram is capable of separating the reality of his otherworldly dreams and the actuality of a butterfly-collecting expedition. In this connec- tion, the following paragraph, which Nabokov chose to omit in the fair copy, appears especially gratifying and illuminating. In the first draft it is</page><page sequence="15">714 Slavic and East European Journal found on the last page, right after the sentence in which Pil'gram drops a money-pot and bends to pick up the coins: HHKTO He BHAeJI, KaK OH BbimeJI 3 gOMa.

("Now one saw him leave the house. The evening street, still sunny, was crowded; the neighbors locked up their shops, the harness-maker across the street played with his dog, two young women discussed something animatedly in their high voices. And everyone had watch- ful eyes, they all knew their street, knew who passes by where, and were prepared afterward to discuss any conspicuous trifle; but still no one saw anything.") In the first draft, Nabokov must have still felt compelled to justify his decision to create a narrative split between the textual opening of Pil'gram's departure and his death that engenders a closed ending. The quoted passage reads like a section of a detective story and prompts the readers to investi- gate the hidden possibilities of Pil'gram's disappearance. Conversely, the effect of the last "split" paragraph in the printed version is to launch the reader on an endless journey along with the protagonist, to enter a privileged textual zone that I have termed, here and elsewhere, textual otherworldly opening.21 By leaving the explanatory passage out of the final version, Nabo- kov decided not to "cater" to what he would later label "commonsense"- the enemy of artistic creation (and of reading by the same token). Just as Nabokov ends his seminal lecture "The Art of Literature and Common- sense" with a call to "shoot [commonsense] dead" (LL 380), he concludes "The Aurelian" with Pil'gram's death. The philistine in Pil'gram remains on the floor of his shop with his face "knocked out of shape" not by death, but by a burgher's commonsense, by a commonsensical cause-a money-pot that he drops on the floor. However, the idealist dreamer in Pil'gram defies the constrains of philistine commonsense and sets out on an endless journey across the memory of the reader (provided, of course, that the reader real- izes that commonsense could never justify genuine artistic imagination). Finally, I will mention one change which I find regrettable. In both the first draft and the final Russian version, Eleanor sees Pil'gram's note ("Off to Spain"; Stories 254/ND 87) and bursts into tears. In the first draft, the narrator offers the following remark: "MbIcJIb, HTO Myx aejIcTBHTejibHo yexajI [I yexan B TaKyIO HeBeaoMyIO cTpaHy, KOTOpyIO MOrKHO yBHaeTb TOJIbKO B KHHeMaTorpa4e, axonro] He yMexajiacb y Hee B Mo3ry" ("The thought that her husband has really left [and has left for some incomprehen- sible country which one can only see in the movies] could not fit in her brain (the brackets indicate the omitted phrase; S 206-7). Nabokov's deci- sion to omit the above clause is understandable: he was trying to avoid cliches and easily accessible metaphors, like the one comparing Spain to a</page><page sequence="16">Pilgrimage, Memory and Death in "The Aurelian" 715 movie. For Eleanor, Spain is at best an exotic country of bull fights and castanets which she knows from newsreels, and not the home of remark- able lepidoptera. Still, ironically, Eleanor's cinematic perception of where her husband went (she had just learned it from his note and still does not know he is dead) would only enhance the story's dramatization of the prohibitive gap between Pil'gram and his wife. As the emigre critic A. Savel'ev aptly remarked in his review of issue 43 of Contemporary Annals, Pil'gram's wife also dreams ("toze mectaet"), but her dreams are quite innocuous and do not threaten to destroy their philistine routine.22 The revision that Nakobov undertook while translating the story are among the most radical, comparable only to the transformation of the Russian novel, Kamera Obskura (1931), into the Anglo-American novel, Laughter in the Dark (1938). I have already identified several passages that Nabokov chose to exclude from the translation as well as his additions to the English text. Jane Grayson, in a ground-breaking study of Nabokov's poetics of self- translation, noticed several structural changes Nabokov made in the English version. In addition to the fact that the story was now divided into four parts marked with Roman numerals, Grayson also mentions that Nabokov tight- ened the plot and added dates to provide a temporal framework.23 The American version of "The Aurelian" reads quite differently from its Russian counterpart, almost like a new story. Nabokov translated it in 1941 together with Peter Pertzoff; it was the second translation of a short story that Nabo- kov supervised to be published in the United States.24 I would venture to propose that Nabokov was Englishing his Russian story with the American reader, if not with a specific magazine audience (Atlantic Monthly), in mind. This might explain Nabokov's insistence on contextualizing, historicizing, and overexplaining the details of the story's pre-World War Two European milieu. A number of examples of the ways Nabokov Americanized certain Euro- pean cultural concepts may be found in the text. The "skinny" and unap- pealing owner of Pil'gram's neighborhood pub becomes a good American "bartender, a dashing fellow in a ... green sweater" (Stories 244/ND 75); while the German pub owner has a knack for pouring cheap cognac into the snifters, his American coeval "was deft at shaving off with one stroke the foam topping the glass under the beer tap" (Stories 244/ND 75). The pub owner's ample daughter ("krupnaja devica") metamorphoses into the bartender's "pretty girl" who now wears a "polka-dotted frock" (Stories 245/ND 76) rather than a plaid wool dress. Pil'gram's dingy apartment is now equipped with a palm tree "that looked as bleak as if it were growing on Heligoland" (Stories 245/ND 76). Several additions specify the time and the amounts of money involved in the story. The American reader is told that Pil'gram and Eleanor were married in 1905, which-along with the</page><page sequence="17">716 Slavic and East European Journal time they have been married-yields the exact year when the story takes place: 1930. The day on which Sommer walks into Pil'gram's shop to change his fortune is specified to be "a certain first of April, of all dates" (Stories 251/ND 83). The pupae Pil'gram sells are assigned a price, one mark, instead of the Russian "nedorogo" ("inexpensively"). A female spe- cies of a rare butterfly which Pil'gram discusses with a colleague is said to have cost 14 pounds at an auction. The sum of money that Pil'gram hopes to get from Sommer has been lowered from "two-three thousand" to 950 marks. Certain other details must have been deemed insignificant for the American audience and dropped or revamped. Pil'gram's 8:29 train is no longer referred to as the Cologne train. The English version excludes the important reference to the ancient Greek sanctuary of Erechtheum but adds another one roughly in the same part of the text. The symbolic weight of a holy site is now assigned to Tatsienlu, East Tibet; Tatsienlu, better known as Kangting, is located in the Tibetan Autonomous District, a cen- ter of Buddhism. Nabokov adds a long sentence explaining the meaning of the term "aurelian" and its relationship to Pil'gram's occupation. Other examples may be found in the text. The above additions tune the story up to the wavelength of the American reader circa 1940s. They do not affect the meaning of Pil'gram's other- worldly dream. Conversely, the second group of changes does address the story's central cluster of motifs. On the whole, the English version deemphasizes the focus of the Russian text upon the absolute happiness which Pil'gram hopes to achieve during his expedition. The English version also leaves out the childhood flashback Pil'gram experiences when he picks up a caterpillar from a tree. Nabokov's change alters the history of Pil'gram's otherworldly dream, which in the Russian text is grounded in the protagonist's earliest perfect memories; the Russian story depicts Pil'gram's first caterpillar as a boy's first love. The very word "scast'e" ("happiness") occurs nine times in the Russian text, and only twice in the translation. While Nabokov might have been trying to avoid redundancy, the Russian text's insistence upon using the same term over and over again supports the idea of Pil'gram's fixation upon his dream. The English text depolarizes the original's crucial opposition between the world of Pil'gram's everyday existence and the perfect otherworld mapped in his memory. In the end, the American story with its "dashing" bartender and Pil'gram's savior, the rich amateur Sommer ("a sunburned, bespectacled man in an old macintosh and without any hat"; Stories 251/ND 83) appears as less of a tragedy and more of a tale with a mysterious ending than its Russian ancestor. Nabokov shares with his privileged characters a capacity to partake in otherworldly experiences. "The Aurelian" enjoys a special status, since</page><page sequence="18">Pilgrimage, Memory and Death in "The Aurelian" 717 both Pil'gram and his creator are entomologists, living in Berlin in the 1930s. One finds numerous connections between Pil'gram's and Nabokov's own lifelong passions for butterflies exhibited through their professional activities as lepidopterists, as well as in Nabokov's discursive statements in Speak, Memory and elsewhere. Characteristic is Nabokov's utilization of his entomological expertise. First, every name of an entomologist implicated in the story corresponds to the name of a real scientist. Dr. Rebel, the Viennese entomologist who names a species after Pil'gram, refers to Hans Rebel (1861-1940). Dr. Staudinger, whom Pil'gram praises for his learning, points to a major Ger- man entomologist Otto Staudinger (1830-1900). A reference to a certain Eisner, who is said to have purchased a rare butterfly at an auction, recalls the name of Nabokov's (and Pil'gram's) fellow entomologist, Gustavus August Eisen (1847-1940). Even Farther Dejean, mentioned in the En- glish version as an explorer of Tibet, appears to have been a historical personage, Pierre Fran9ois Marie August Dejean (1780-1845). Finally, "a Mr. Baron," a discoverer of a Mexican butterfly, probably refers to Oscar Theodor Baron (1847-1926). Even more fascinating are the entomological transformations of the names of the story's characters. Pil'gram's name had originally been Gruber; a Fritz Gruber is listed in the biographical dictio- nary of entomologists.25 In the final version, Nabokov opted for the name Sommer; two entomologists with this name lived in the nineteenth century. The name Sommer was later assigned to the rich collector. Finally, the English version adds the name of "a certain rare moth" that Dr. Rebel named after Pil'gram, Agrotis Pil'grami. Agrotis is in fact a representative genus in the Subfamily Noctuinae.26 Thus, Nabokov the scientist incorpo- rates precise information into the story's geographical and entomological dimensions. Nabokov the poet balances the scientific slant with the story's otherworldly radiance. Chapter Six of Nabokov's autobiography presents the history of Nabo- kov's passion for butterflies as going back to his childhood. Like Pil'gram, who loved butterflies literally since he "began to exist" ("ljubil babocek s tex por, kak suscestvuet"; S 190), Nabokov's existence "from the age of seven . . . was dominated by a single passion" (SM 119). "If my first glance of the morning was for the sun," Nabokov reports, "my first thought was for the butterflies it would engender" (SM 119-20). Both Pil'gram and Nabokov experience recurrent flashbacks to the "original event," the for- mative moment of their careers in lepidopterology. During his Sunday trips to the outskirts of Berlin, Pil'gram recalls the rapture of finding "a large turquoise-green caterpillar" (Stories 248/ND 79). Nabokov reminisces about locating "a rare visitor, a splendid, pale-yellow creature with black blotches, blue crenels, and a cinnabar eyespot above each chrome-rimmed black tail. As it probed the inclined flower from which it hung .. . , my</page><page sequence="19">718 Slavic and East European Journal desire for it was one of the most intense I have ever experienced" (SM 120). Nabokov's dream butterfly, his first Swallowtail ("maxaon"), also figures in "The Aurelian." The memories of Nabokov's and Pil'gram's growing interest in butterflies are rendered in a markedly romantic lan- guage employing such words as love, passion, desire, ecstasy. The fifty-year old Pil'gram sighs as he envisions himself as a child enamored with butter- flies; Nabokov, "as a grown man... under ether during appendec- tomy . . . saw [his own self] in a sailor suit mounting a freshly emerged Emperor moth .. ." (SM 121). As a researcher at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology, the forty-five year old Nabokov experienced joys of discovery that are comparable to the blissful memories of his "Russian boyhood" (SM 125). Pil'gram and his creator also share the highly private and individual nature of their passion. Nabokov recalls the "[a]cute desire to be alone, since any companion, no matter how quiet, interfered with the concen- trated. enjoyment of my mania" (SM 126; cf. Pil'gram's "obsession"). At times, both Pil'gram and Nabokov despair over "how little the ordinary person notices butterflies" (SM 129). A Swiss hiker replies to Nabokov that he saw "none" while descending the same trail as Nabokov. In the first draft of "The Aurelian," Pil'gram experiences an attack of bile when his acquaintance, a doctor, insists that there are no butterflies in Greece, for it is too hot" ("sliskom zarko"). At best, people notice the most obvious features of the butterflies, their bright colors. Pil'gram's customers pre- dominantly go for "popular stars among butterflies, some of them set on plaster and framed-intended merely for ornamenting the home" (Stories 247/ND 78). Nabokov's Mademoiselle buys for him ("something better than your cabbage butterflies") a "banal Urania moth mounted on plaster" (SM 128). The fact that for the most part people understand nothing about butterflies' beauty only enhances Pil'gram's-and Nabokov's own-sense of being privileged vis-a-vis their perfect and private lepidopterological otherworld.27 In places, the "butterfly" chapter of Nabokov's memoir/autobiography, Speak, Memory (1960), reads as a post-textual commentary on those details that the genre of "The Aurelian" did not allow the writer to elaborate. In fact, the term "Aurelian" figures directly in the text of the memoir as if pointing back to the short story; Nabokov recalls a particular subspecies that preoccupied him in Russia: "Those were the dung-loving males of what the old Aurelians used to call the Poplar Admirable" (added emphasis; SM 133). Given the fact that Nabokov's consciousness to some extent informs that of Pil'gram, one expects to find the same names of the butterfly and moth species in both texts. Moreover, Nabokov provides the names of entomologi- cal treatises that he read in his childhood; they give one an idea of where Pil'gram might have obtained his encyclopedic knowledge. Several names of</page><page sequence="20">Pilgrimage, Memory and Death in "The Aurelian" 719 entomologists, mentioned only in passing in the story, are reintroduced in the memoir. For instance, Nabokov provides the background on the name of Dr. Staudinger, of whom Pil'gram speaks with awe. One also finds a refer- ence to the Grand Duke Nikolaj Mixajlovic's Memoires of Asiatic lepidoptera, which might have informed Pil'gram's maps of the Far East; in the first draft of the story Pil'gram frets over the fact that only rich collectors, like the Grand Duke Nikolaj Mixajlovic, get a chance to travel. And those readers curious about the source of the name Kretschmar, which Nabokov originally intended for his protagonist, learn from the memoir that an ento- mologist with such a name had described a butterfly, Plusia excelsa, which Nabokov rediscovered as a Russian teenager. Finally, the autobiography quotes a stanza from Fet's "soliloquizing" poem, "The Butterfly," in Nabokov's translation: "Whence have I come and whither am I hasting/ Do not inquire;/ Now on a graceful flower I have settled/ And now respire" (SM 129). What used to flutter over the surface of "The Aurelian," has descended-some fifteen years later-on a page of Nabokov's autobiography. Thus, "The Aurelian" may be considered a "fu- ture recollection" ("buduscee vospominanie"), as Nabokov put it both in "Putevoditel' po Berlinu" ("A Guide to Berlin," 1925) and "Tjazelyj dym" ("Torpid Smoke," 1935),-a study for Nabokov's future memoir. In Speak, Memory, Nabokov also alludes to several butterfly collecting trips that illumine Pil'gram's plans in the story. "In the summer of 1929," Nabokov reminisces, "every time I walked through a village in the Eastern Pyrenees, and happened to look back, I would see in my wake the villagers frozen in the various attitudes my passage had caught them in, as if I were Sodom and they Lot's wife" (SM 131). In the Russian version of "The Aurelian," one finds a similar description of the locals' reaction ("udivlenie i strax aborigenov," literally: "the aborigines' surprise and fear") to the "strange people who have come from afar" (S 196). Nabokov's 1929 trip to the Eastern Pyrenees near the Spanish border is also important because several of Pil'gram's plans concern an expedition to Southern France and to Spain. His final trip into eternity is also camouflaged as a trip to Spain, during which "he visited Granada, Murcia, and Albarracin" (Stories 254/ ND 87). Two more references to Nabokov's life may elucidate the poetics of "The Aurelian." One has to do with Nabokov's recurrent dream of undertaking a tropical expedition that he never realized, much like his privileged char- acter Pil'gram. Nikolaj Raevskij, a writer who knew Nabokov in the 1920s in Prague and shared his professional interest in lepidoptera, recalled how an excited Nabokov told him about his dream of an expedition to New Guinea, French Equatorial Africa, and the Solomon Islands: "The climate there is wretched everywhere, but I am young, healthy, physically trained, so I would hope to survive and bring back remarkable collections."28</page><page sequence="21">720 Slavic and East European Journal Raevskij also recalled warning Nabokov in the 1920s against undertaking a long expedition to exotic lands because "the writer Nabokov could die an untimely death" in a dangerous climate. Raevskij's memoir contains insight- ful remarks about the relationship between Pil'gram and his creator. Raevskij suggests that "The Aurelian" tells a story of Nabokov's own "unrealized entomological dream." Raevskij speaks of the strength and irresistibility of Pil'gram's (and Nabokov's) passion which preserved for life "the pure child's perception of nature."29 A former emigre who was repatriated to the USSR after World War Two, Raevskij wrote his memoir at the end of 1980s. Although Raevskij appar- ently corresponded with Nabokov until the latter's death, Raevskij's knowl- edge of Nabokov's American years was sporadic. Perhaps this lack of infor- mation explains Raevskij's insistence that in "The Aurelian" the central motif of an unrequited and deferred dream underlies Nabokov's career in entomology. Raevskij apparently did not know that coming to America gave Nabokov a chance to go on the kinds of collecting trips that he had dreamed about as an emigre in Europe-to the American West and Southwest,- during which Nabokov reexperienced the joys of his childhood.30 One experience of catching butterflies in the United States, a visit to the Grand Canyon in 1941, during which Nabokov discovered a new species of the Neonympha genus, inspired an English poem, "On Discovering a But- terfly."31 Written in 1943 and anticipating an equally rewarding trip to Utah, the poem appeared in The New Yorker and ended with the following stanza: Dark pictures, thrones, the stones that pilgrims kiss, poems that take a thousand years to die but ape the immortality of this red label on a little butterfly. (PP 156)32 The motif of pilgrimage bridges-yet from another angle-Nabokov's biography and poetics. Chronologically, "The Aurelian" (1930) follows Nabokov's Russian poem "The Pilgrim" (1927) and precedes "On Discov- ering a Butterfly" (1943). Although Nabokov's artistic aspirations did not remain unchanged over these years, one finds that all three texts share a unique feature. I am speaking of the way the perfect dream-uniting Pil'gram and the lyrical personae of the two poems-awards a taste of timelessness, a window into otherworldly eternity. The three variants of the same human type, the optimistic young pilgrim of the Russian poem, the middle-aged deferred pilgrim of the story, and the clairvoyant ex- pilgrim of the English poem, may not see the meaning of their pilgrimages in the same terms. But they would all agree with what their creator, Vladimir Nabokov, writes at the end of Chapter Six of Speak, Memory,</page><page sequence="22">Pilgrimage, Memory and Death in "The Aurelian" 721 the chapter bringing his life-long experiences of butterfly collecting to a common artistic denominator. In this remarkable passage, the teenage Nabokov pursues a butterfly on a northern bog outside Petersburg (cf. Pil'gram's bogs in Lapland) and . . . sees that miraculously, "in the dis- tance, fleeting cloud shadows dappled the dull green of slopes above timber line, and the gray and white of Longs Peak" (SM 139). Having transcended both the time and the space separating Russia of the 1910s from the Colorado of the 1940s, Nabokov continues: I confess I do not believe in time, I like to fold my magic carpet, after use, in such a way as to superimpose one part of the pattern upon another. Let visitors trip. And the highest enjoyment of timelessness-in a landscape selected at random-is when I stand among rare butterflies and their food plants. This is ecstasy, and behind the ecstasy is something else, which is hard to explain. It is like a momentary vacuum into which rushes all that I love. A sense of oneness with sun and stone. A thrill of gratitude to whom it may concern-to the contrapuntal genius of human fate or to tender ghosts humoring a lucky human. (SM 139; added emphases) Chapter Six of the autobiography stands as an monument to Nabokov's lifelong passions, writing and butterflies. As in "The Aurelian," Nabokov places a major textual opening right at the end of his chapter, printed in The New Yorker as a separate piece under the title "Butterflies."33 The textual openings at the end of both pieces, the story and the autobiography, allow the reader access to eternity by alluding to what Nabokov identified as the otherworldly source of his art in the 1942 poem "Fame": But one day while disrupting the strata of sense and descending deep down to my wellspring I saw mirrored, besides my own self and the world something else, something else, something else. (PP 113) Exhibiting intimate connections with Nabokov's biographic and literary contexts, "The Aurelian" celebrates the success of a new poetics. Artisti- cally speaking, the most appealing quality of "The Aurelian," its beauty, grace and magnetism, is that it states what Aristotle favored in his Poetics, the impossible but plausible "Yes, Pil'gram had gone far, very far" (Stories 254/ND 87). This narrative split between the story's otherworldly textual opening and its commonsensical closure, rendered in such convincing and penetrating language, highlights Nabokov at his best. Possibly Nabokov's most idealistic short story, "The Aurelian" typifies Nabokov's Middle Pe- riod, when Germany was still a relatively safe haven for the Russian exile, when there was hope for a Russian writer in Europe, when Nabokov still felt as a happy "pilgrim whose Mecca is where he is."</page><page sequence="23">722 Slavic and East European Journal NOTES * I wish to thank the Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies for awarding me two Short-Term Grants (November 1993; May-June 1996) that allowed me to complete large parts of the research for this article.

Nabokov emphasized that "a writer has an idea of a reader, and in this respect the idea of a reader may be said to be one of the characters of the book. But this ideal reader is really the author's double-and has nothing to do with any readers an author imagines in terms of [. . .] time, race, local interests, etc." See Vladimir Nabokov, "Lectures," ms, VN LC, Library of Congress, container 8, folder 11. 8 I should mention that although one sometimes gets the feeling that Nabokov invents his details, like the names of the exotic locales, most of the details in the story are actually informed by genuine facts. In the case of the geography of Pil'gram's dream-travels, Nabokov at times creates the illusion of strangeness by using names that are obsolete or less known to the Russian and/or American reader. Thus, for instance, he uses the ancient Sanskrit name of Ceylon, "Taprobane," or the pre-1913 name of Kangting, Tatsienlu. He adopts Heligoland (Helogland in the Atlantic Monthly version), the slightly misspelled Old Norse version of Halogaland, a region in Norway's Nordland country, the homeland of Knut Hamsun.</page><page sequence="24">Pilgrimage, Memory and Death in "The Aurelian" 723 9 Hiiller (115) discusses Pilgram's and Ivanov's heartaches as well as the motif of living on the threshold of being and non-being, the motif originally noted by Khodasevich in "O Sirine"; see Literaturnye stat'i i vospominanija 125. 10 Several sources were consulted in preparation for this discussion; see Oxford English Dictionary VII: 858-59; Slovar' sovremennogo ... jazyka 9 (1959); Bahlow 378; Reaney 273-74; Hanks and Hodges 420. 11 See Vladimir Nabokov, "Pilgram" ("Palomnik"), ms, ts, and tear copy of the Sovremennye zapiski publication with Nabokov's notes towards an English translation, VN LC, con- tainer 7, folders dd, ee, ff. 12 I am grateful to SEEJ's editor, Michael M. Naydan, for pointing out the connection between the last name Sommer and summer, the time when butterflies are transformed and live. 13 The second word is babocek, genitive plural of babodka, "butterfly"; the first word appears to be "ljubitel' " ("lover"). The original title might have been "Ljubitel' babocek" ("A Lover of Butterflies"). 14 In 1925, following the publication of the short story "Baxman" ("Bachman") in The Rudder, Nabokov received a peculiar request from Dr. Bernhard Hirschbergof Frankfurt a/M. Taking Nabokov's short story to be a memoiristic essay, Hirschberg asked for permission to translate it into German to be published in "one of the local newspapers." See "To Vladimir Nabokov." March 8, 1925. Letter in VN LC, container 8, folder 13. 15 It is also possible that Nabokov did not want to have two texts under the same title; in 1927 he wrote and published a poem also entitled "Palomnik." 16 Harvey 4-5. 17 Alexandrov discusses a similar problem of Nabokov's "escape from emigration" with examples from Nabokov's discursive writings, Speak, Memory, The Defense, The Gift, and Lolita, in a recent Russian article; see Aleksandrov (Alexandrov), "Spasenie ot emigracii u Nabokova." 18 See Fet, Polnoe sobranie stixotvorenij 303. 19 The poems by Fet which Nabokov translated are: "Alter Ego" (1878), "Izmucen lizn'ju, kovarstvom nadeidy . ." ("When life is torture, when hope is a traitor ...," 1864), and "Lastocki" ("The Swallows," 1884); all three were published in The Russian Review, Vol. 3, No. 1 (Fall 1943): 31-33. For a discussion of Fet's "The Butterfly" in Nabokov's oeuvre see Bethea, "Izgnanie kak uxod v konon: obraz babocki u Nabokova i Brodskogo" 175, ftn. 6. 20 "The Butterfly" also points to Fet's earlier poem, "Ne spragivaj, nad cem zadumyvajus' ja.. ." ("Don't ask me what occupies my thoughts .. . ," 1854) which might have informed the image of Pilgram the dreamer. In Fet's poem, the lyrical voice confesses that 'his soul is filled with an insane dream' ("Mectoi bezumnoju polna dusa moja"); see Fet 262. 21 See Shrayer. 22 A. Savel'ev, "Sovremennye zapiski. Kn. 43-ja." 23 Grayson, Nabokov Translated 34. Only a few minor changes were made in the Contempo- rary Annals version, the latter being virtually identical with the text that appeared in Nabokov's second collection, The Eye. Since neither the authorized typescript nor the galley proofs have survived, one has to rely on the existing manuscript of Nabokov's fair copy as the final version of the story. The editors of Contemporary Annals, and/or Nabokov himself did make a few insignificant changes on the atomistic level. For in- stance, the adjective "Siberian" ("sibirskij") in reference to lepidoptera was replaced with "foreign" ("insotrannyj") in the description of Pilgram's previous attempts at under- taking a collecting trip; the reference to Siberia might have confused the Russian reader. 24 Virtually nothing has been written about the translator of three of Nabokov's best short</page><page sequence="25">724 Slavic and East European Journal stories, "Cloud, Castle, Lake," "The Aurelian," and "Spring in Fialta." At the same time, Nabokov's relationship with Pertzoff goes back as far as 1933 when Michael Karpo- vich recommended Pertzoff to Nabokov as a skillful translator. Originally, the matter concerned translating Nabokov's novels to be published in the U.S. Then, in 1938 Nabo- kov and Pertzoff discussed the possibility of translating the entire collection of short stories, The Eye. Later, in 1940, Pertzoff tried to help Nabokov with finding a job; there was a possibility of a job at a university library. In 1941 Nabokov suggested that Pertzoff take on a translation of The Gift, but the project was never consummated. The first short story which Pertzoff and Nabokov translated and placed in an American magazine was "Cloud, Castle, Lake," printed in Atlantic Monthly in July 1941. It was followed by "The Aurelian" which appeared in Atlantic Monthly in November 1941. As one can see from the surviving manuscripts and the correspondence, the co-translators followed the same procedure. First, Pertzoff would prepare a more or less literal translation of the Russian original. Then, Nabokov would go over it and edit it very thoroughly, rewriting up to 60% of Pertzoff's English. Nabokov called the process drakonit' (- "to dragonize"). Despite the number of emendations, Nabokov was very pleased with Pertzoff's work and hoped to continue their collaboration which was beginning to turn into friendship after Nabokov had visited Pertzoff in Ithaca in 1944. In August 1941, Nabokov suggested that Pertzoff start working on "Spring in Fialta." The translation underwent several revisions by Nabo- kov and was finished by March 1943. Atlantic Monthly rejected the story claiming that it was too long for them, and in 1947 the story was printed in Harper's Bazaar, predomi- nantly a high-fashion magazine. No correspondence with Pertzoff past 1944 has survived among Nabokov's papers.
