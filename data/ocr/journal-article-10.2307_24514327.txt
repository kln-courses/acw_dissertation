<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Chocolate Malted for Charles Ives Vaul West 1. PRE FACE Best to begin by saying that the following story by Jan Thor arrived in the mail one day, addressed to me (why to me specifically, I'm unsure, but a good enough reason would be that Ives was al ready dead). At first I thought the packet held a composition of my own rejected by some unlucky magazine and left it unopened for several days, scowling at the Illinois postmark (the only portion legible) until I felt readier for bad news or a thickly wrapped check. Imagine, then, I won't describe it, my surprise on at length hauling into the light Thor's typescript and his covering letter, this ad dressed to neither myself nor Charles Ives but, misleadingly, to "Kurie, Dear Friend." I gasped. Why me? Who on earth was Jan Thor? What on earth, or off, had Charles Ives to do with it all? Was a crank hell-bent on persecuting me by mail? Or was I sup posed to pass on this work of genius to some sympathetic editor of my acquaintance? So I began to read, both letter and story, found the former baffling, the latter a confection of meandering fibs, colossal hubris and indecipherable burden. But, I confess, the thing began to grow on me, like a polyp. I knew something about Charles Edward Ives (1874-1954), Jan Thor's noetic target, not having missed a certain raucous patriotism in the music of that composer, all flags, bands and catafalques, and had even learned something about his career in the insurance business. Recognition came later and his "People's World Nation," like his Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution, never. Not exactly uninformed, I sought to instruct myself further, even while grappling with Thor's text. Good ice-cream needs cone. Clearly, Jan Thor, jocularly doffing his hair shirt in the drug store mode of greeting, was made, though I could see a certain logic in offering a chocolate malted to Ives: a supremely Ameri can gesture. In some extraordinary fit of agitation, it seemed, Jan Thor had typed up, in red., what I can only call a penitential psalm 322</page><page sequence="2">Paul West tricked out in the Latin rubrics of a requiem mass and evoking not so much Ives as Mozart. Except that he garbled the rubrics and concocted at least one ["Exit") of his own, the result being hardly a progress of the soul from extremis to unction, but an uncouth travesty of the God-Son, Master-Slave, symbiosis, in which de monic possession figures as flagellated bliss and coherence as hell on earth. So be it. Who wants to read the likes of Middlemarch again? Not I. Let it be said, though, I have looked in vain in Jan Thor's text for justificatory references to bashful Ives playing handball at thirteen against the barn door while his father's band marched past the house playing the "Holiday Quickstep," or to Ives's disdain for the man who thinks being full of turbid feelings about himself qualifies him as an artist, or to his notion of an African's soul looking the same under X-ray as an American one, or to his joy in Emerson's finding poetic suggestiveness in the humming of the telegraph wire, or to the Human Oversoul, to 114 Songs, or even to his favorite quadratic monomial: Ix2 - V b2 + 4ac Beauty = — 3(χ + y)2 Whatever that meant. Again, Ives's commas were time-intervals, or a means of precluding sibilance, whereas Jan Thor's are routine little maggots flash-frozen in his meal. I conclude Jan Thor bestowed his text on Ives out of some tan gential musical pretension. An allusion, Ives-like, here and there, is the only reference he makes to the composer. In fact, Thor seems an ecumenical provincial with delusions of candor. If he was say ing something to while away the time, then all right: mice must play; but, if he was dying during the actual composition (as his covering letter implies), he died too late. Certainly, he never lived in or near Pekin, Illinois, and I have been unable to substantiate his other claims to whereabouts. I offer his dative text to the world only as a bow to a ghost in torment (it did grow on me, after all, as I've said), and to report yet another daft salience in these freak filled days, in which to breathe is to smother, to think to fail, to write to earn the cold-sore of malversation. A seal of malpractice awaits us all. Enough! Jan Thor's A Chocolate Malted for Charles Ives awaits you. Sup with Ives, or sup on his behalf. I remind you only that chocolate 323</page><page sequence="3">Paul West comes from the Aztec xococ (bitter) and atl (water), while malted evokes a grain that's been allowed to sprout. Need I say more? Can one ever say enough? Why speak at all? It's in our nature to resent texts that, in their juicily indifferent inscrutability, too much re mind us of the universe itself. Yet search with naked lights we must, ever for chaos. Or, like the dog in the old HMV advertise ments, we must listen for Our Master's Voice in the amplifying horn of every gramophone, even though the sound be turned down. Perhaps I have missed in Jan Thor's writing something you will find. If live we do in a galactic zoo, some terrestrial safari park, we'll never meet the Director. Caged beasts never do, whether bom in captivity or not. Enough I said a riff or ten ago. Follows the noise of Jan Thor singing unharmoniously to Charles Ives without benefit of clergy, organ job, or pride. Who is Thor? Who was he? Where is he now, if anywhere? None of this I know. But, at least, at one time he was not nothing. That much is clear. 2. THE LETTER AND THE ACCOMPANYING TEXT e/o-Mayo-Glinie,-Roeh Pekin, Illinois February 23rd, 1973 Kurie, Dear Friend: I trust you will tolerate the salutation, if you are still there. If it is obsolete, then forgive it. Here, much later than I had intended, is a full account of some recent happenings peculiar in the extreme as well as fatal. Writing is not my forte; in fact, nothing is. But that is my problem, or was. I trust simply that the enclosed will reach you, one way or another. I have told things as directly as possible, but sometimes moving away from the immediate point. I have let such detours stand, just as I have the present tense even after events invalidated it. To try to write this down at all was to have to relive it, hence some of the anachronisms. I have, I am assured, no hope of recovery. Feel free to make use 324</page><page sequence="4">Paul West of the enclosed material, on one condition: that you on no account give my name or in any way connect me with what I describe herein. As far as I am concerned, the whole affair is done with. Concluded. Jan Thor P.S. Please find the typescript herewith. A Chocolate Malted for Charles Ives by Jan Thor Once, when I was less myself than I am now, I founded a small travel agency in a medium-sized town in upper New York State. I prospered with it, especially through package deals. After about ten years, I sold the business, my interest in it having soured, the consequence of repeated futile attempts to visit Peking, both for my own pleasure and for the express but ancillary purpose of arranging China Tours. I had been everywhere else, so the frustra tion was singularly acute. Since selling out, at a more than hand some profit (the agency's name now having changed from Gulliver's World, The Honest-To-Jonathan, Swift-Travel Service — arch fancy of my prime —to Cook-Satellite, A Division of State National Bank), I have traveled not at all, done a little quiet reading (mostly in the prose classics — Dickens, Tolstoy, Balzac and Swift), and become something of a connoisseur in fortified wines. An occa sional mistress has sufficed, along with the music of Bartok, the king crab of Alaska (far superior, on my palate, to lobster), and the friendship of my landlord, Frank Etna, a former associate professor of bugle and trumpet who, finding himself unvalued and unpro moted at Pekin College, even after years of devoted service as con ductor of the College Blue-Band, turned to real estate and borrowed his way to a small fortune. He travels exhaustively while I mostly stay here (a second-best Peking, but enough), and then we exchange experiences: gadabout for static, foreign for native, abundance for next to none! He is the fox, I the hedgehog. We also sometimes play chess. There, that was relatively painless,· I'll go on. Over the years, it has proved a sufficiently aloof relationship: 325</page><page sequence="5">Paul West nothing too intimate, nothing too superficial either. He has a family, a tight circle of real-estate friends who meet weekly for a fifty-cent breakfast at the Pek-Inn, and four cars, one of them an antique. I have no family, only an ex-wife who remarried after leaving me many years ago before Gulliver's World turned a profit, and a daughter from whom I hear twice a year, she being currently an airline stewardess (one of the light militia of the lower air). These have been peaceful years, a peaceful decade almost. I've shifted quietly about, though not very far in any direction, now thinning my interests, now multiplying them, obligated to no body, known by few, loved by none. I've just passed forty-four, have had no major illness apart from a coronary five years ago, have irrecoverably lost fifty pounds (thus matching my five feet ten inches with the correct chart-weight of 155 pounds), and — well, I was going to explain my name. Thor is a truncation of Thoreau undertaken legally in my twenties when for the last time I wearied of being asked if I were indeed descended from that reclusive American author. I am not, I would not like to be, and I will not mention the matter again. My family name, truth told, was Taureaux, blurred by some unlettered official into that other. Nor has the name anything to do with thunder therefore. All was well, I was just saying, until that day last year when, with head not more than usually befuddled, staring into the freezer compartment of the refrigerator, and wondering what to thaw out for dinner, I heard a voice, not of anyone present and wholly unlike my own, a semi-strangled bass loaded with what sounded like uncontainable frustration. (On rereading this, I see I have cast it as being written before things went wrong, which is no doubt wishful thinking, the mind in recoil into the recent innocent past. Never mind, it will stand as witness to my re morse, if that is the word.) Whether, on that day, the pun-sound of thaw with Thoi activated the chain of events, I will never know; sufficient to begin at the beginning and conduct you through, as best I am able, to see what you make of it, whether voice, voices, or mere pre-senile echoes. Distinct as the evening television news, there came the first of who knows how many thousand words: "Ur — I don't usually hesitate. This's Atlas calling. A.T.L.A.S. ATLAS. Message ends. I'm through. Eon after eon, under these blue-black Moroccan skies, I've kept on calling the whole arrange ment into question, but've only managed to keep on calling it back 326</page><page sequence="6">Paul West into being. Ad Nau-say-AM. Repeatedly, I mean. I'm hoarse to the point of aphasia, meaning I only think my cries, can't so much as even mime them; my face and biceps (bicepses I suppose I mean) are numb as keystones; I can't remember when my head didn't ache from the weight of holding up everything. Shoulders I won't even mention, still less my bent frame in general. I hurt all over, all through. It's high time I stepped down, and out. And then, kerplunk, the sky falls, the whole cosmic drive-in comes thun dering down. Ur. . ." Unforgettable words,· I recall them verbatim; I recalled them always the same. For a while I heard no more, but I remained nervously alert. Where the voice of Atlas had come from, I had no idea, but in my own head it had certainly arrived: no doubt a tra ditional prelude to going (as folks say) mad. First you hear voices, then you begin talking to yourself (which we are born doing), after which. . . I won't reiterate the whole wretched, simplistic idea. I admit that, after various bizarre attempts to smooth out my head — living in a rented houseboat on Lake Cayuga for a lunar month, then for another in a tent near a mountain airport in Central Penn sylvania, finally in Frank Etna's majestic white house on the fringe of the Pekin campus — I had ended up with the same turbulence as before, except that the chunks of chaos had less serrated edges. Simply, thereafter, I stayed on in that house, disciplining myself into running a mile each day in sneakers and shorts, and permit ting myself only one extravagance: a case of Dry Sack sherry week ly, which the local store delivered on Fridays. You may not know the brew, or even the brand, but it comes wrapped in a neat little sacking bag with scarlet or brown drawstring at the neck. After the first month I had enough sacking bags (fifty or so) to make something to wear, so I ripped open the stitches and stapled the panels of fabric into a loose cape imprinted time and again DRY SACK DRY SACK DRY, etc. A bottle a day frees a panel to wear. But it was only after a month had passed that Atlas began to come through, at first loud and clear, as just now, then indistinct and soft, vice versa I mean, and I took it for granted, wondering only: Why Atlas{ Why me 11 didn't know, I still don't, that much about Greek mythology, having always felt such personages as, oh, Zeus, Prometheus, Oedipus, remote from me, despite sensible argu ments to the contrary. Nonetheless, it was clearly Atlas, self announced, definite, and forceful; so I asked myself what I knew about Atlas, and it was precious little. He held up the world, and 327</page><page sequence="7">Paul West not for ransom, or rather he held up the skies and it was only later on they tagged on the globe as well. Insult after injury, they'd named an ICBM after him; there was a range of mountains in North Africa (as his voice had reminded me); and of course there was every atlas of maps, over one of which I pored instead of gad ding about Mother Earth. Fairly eager, then, but still mystified as to what process was under way in my exasperated head, I hunted through Etna's books in the shelves the steam pipes ran vertically through (some of the warmest books ever!) and by a stroke of no doubt predestined luck found an 1892 translation of Oskar Seyf fert's Dictionaiy of Classical Antiquities, its binding split and some of the pages missing but with the vital entry intact. What Frank Etna was doing with it, I cannot imagine, for his mind did not lean that way at all, not even when he was in Greece. Here goes, I told myself; bone up on Atlas, just in case. "ATLAS (the bearer or endurer)," it said. 'The son of the Titan Iapetus and Clymene (or, according to another account, Asia), brother of Menoetius, Prometheus, and Epimetheus. In Homer I Od. i.52 I he is called the thinker of mischief, who knows about the depths of the sea, and has under his care the pillars which hold heaven and earth asunder. In Hesiod iTheog. 517 I he stands at the western end of the earth, near where the Hesperides dwell, hold ing the broad heaven on his head and his unwearied hands. To this condition he is forced by Zeus, according to a later version, as a punishment for the part he took in the battle with the Titans." Oh ho, thought I, no small fry he. Yet the entry did not fill a page. "By the Ocean nymph Pleione he is father of the Pleiades, by Aethra of the Hyades." It made sense: if you support the universe, you need a family. But, I wondered, how?What were the mechanics of all that siring, if presumably he stayed all the time where he's reputed to have been? In the standing-up position? Missionary? Or what? For answer, I read on, got nothing of the kind. "In Homer the nymph Calypso is also his daughter, who dwells on the island of Ogygia, the navel of the sea. Later authors make him the father of the Hesperides, by Hesperis. It is to him that Amphitrite flies when pursued by Poseidon. As their knowledge of the West extended, the Greeks transferred the abode of Atlas to the African mountain of the same name. Local stories of a moun tain which supported the heaven would, no doubt, encourage the identification. In later times Atlas was represented as a wealthy king, and owner of the garden of the Hesperides. Perseus, with his 328</page><page sequence="8">Paul West head of the Medusa, turned him into a rocky mountain for his inhospitality. In works of art he is represented as carrying the heaven; or (after the earth was discovered to be spherical) the terrestrial globe. Among the statues of Atlas the Farnese, in the Museum at Naples, is the best known. (See also OLYMPIC GAMES, fig. 3)." And that was all, except for an endnote reading: "In Greek archi tecture, the term Atlantes was employed to denote the colossal male statues sometimes used in great buildings instead of columns to support an entablature or a projecting roof." Next came ATREUS, so I set the book down, compulsively musing. What a paltry dossier for the voice of my demonic possessor (if such he were, were going to be). Certainly, Atlas was no mythic V.I.P. In the ordinary course of things I wouldn't have given him a moment's thought; after all, a man who isn't going to give the time of day to such a famous ancient as Prometheus (brother of Atlas or not) isn't likely to occupy himself with a character who at best is nothing but an anthropomorphic plinth. All the same, I'd heard Atlas talk to me, declaring himself as clearly as someone credit charging a phone call. Had he come to stay? Or was he, pardon the pun, a flash in Pan? Was Atlas never to be heard from again, like certain candidates for political office? Maybe, for instance, Napoleon or Thoth would be next, to be followed by Pope Joan or Mahomet. Coming home to roost a while. Until Atlas's voice began again, an hour later, I had no idea what to expect, and not even then. I pondered away in my trademarked sackcloth cape, search ing the entry text for clues, for an explanation of the episode, for (ah, Western man that I was then) the "meaning" of this haunting, its purpose, its use. The clear head I once had is no longer mine; in fact, since coming to live in that creaky, spacious house amid its lawns, I'd let myself go somewhat, leaving the door chimes disconnected, never setting the alarm clock, staying up all hours (long after the end of the Late Late Show), letting a week's dishes stand in the sink. Perhaps it was initially because, upstairs, I kept on bumping my head against the slanted, low ceilings,· I had been accustomed to vertical walls and horizontal ceilings, whereas there you never quite knew which was which. I had even begun to walk at the crouch, as if my head were not on straight. Nonetheless, I did my best to be balanced 329</page><page sequence="9">Paul West and systematic about Atlas, and found myself working thus: Atlas, a bearer, I know that much, but none of your native bearer, gun-bearer, on safari. He endures in time, he lasts, and he stomachs a lot. A good name, inspiring trust and confidence, especially if applied to heavy industrial goods. (I suddenly thought to dig out my portable tape recorder, determined to say him into it if he arose in my head again or, fat chance, uttered with his own voice.) I turned then to Prometheus, reading that an eagle was supposed to have pecked away at his liver. Or was it kidney? Then I jotted on a card as follows: Asia. Odd to think of Asia as a mother, his mother, anyone's. Where before have I heard the phrase Mother Asia? Western end. Hm, the West End of London, at any rate, is the smart part of town. Theaters, restaurants, stores. Isn't the West End of Hell called Limbo? Look up later. Wild West? Decline of West? Hesperides. Nearly familiar. Something to do with a garden where golden apples grow, so are the daughters apples? Fruit of seed? Cox's Orange Pippins? Russets? For apples read testicles? Titans. Suggesting the Titanic, though no connection. An obsolete race of gods. Gigantic too. Titanium? Daughters galore. Never a son? Why no mention of this fact? It's an obvious enough question. Calypso. Old word has new meanings. I think of West Indian, or Trinidadian, lyrics, improvised, sung to the music of a steel band. Good-humored, and sometimes satirical or lewd. Is also Cousteau's boat, is not? Maybe Calypso sang seductively. No. Leave space. Look up later. — No, she just gave friendly welcome to Odysseus. Mt. Atlas. OK, he was turned into this by the Medusa head. Or into the whole mountain range. What I'd call a peak experience, at least until an hour ago. Less. Wealthy king. Was Atlas Croesus too? Or Midas? Which is which? Check it out. —Neither one. Now Farnese. Farnese Bull. False trail. Try under Olympic Games, as told to. Here he is! Facing Heracles ( = Hercules, surely), with Hes peris saluting him. He's got a beard and seems to grow upward out of solid rock, embedded in it from the thigh down, and his palms extend as if he is beseeching something. Odd, though, the left arm is only a strut like part of an artifical leg; a whole piece has been broken away. That was all; now I knew how to get nowhere fast. As if on cue, the voice returned, and I forgot all about that evening's dinner as Atlas boomed again through my skull, then quieted a good deal while the cassette whirred. 330</page><page sequence="10">Paul West "Smile if you like, Jan Thor! You're not imagining any of it. This's Atlas again, old buddy. You bet. Now look here. I don't know ex actly how long I have, and no doubt I shouldn't be coming through at all. Blame the Heaviside Layer, one of my ceilings. Fact of the matter is, I've been and got myself a dose" (I flinched) "of the old-fashioned blues, those old no-initiative blues. Imagine being house-bound by the universe! That's a mind-boggier, all right, but grievances I needn't trump up; they're legion, as they say in North Africa, even now. A couple of examples off the cuff might help you though, show you how bad things are. OK for starters. South west of me, parallel but far from in harmony with yours truly, there're the so-called Anti-Atlas Mountains. Tactless montane pastiche if ever I saw one. Four hundred miles short, they run only from Gouimine to Ksares Souk, and then they peter out (I choose the word advisedly), whereas I, Atlas, pro-Atlas, who count my own Mount Toubke, over thirteen and a half thousand feet, a mere nipple, I sprawl all the way from Agadir to Bouarfa, over six hun dred. I'm big about it, bet your life, but to have imitators on your own doorstep, that's too much. You getting all this down?" I was, I was. "Yet even that's not as bad as the only town ever named after you's being not even marked in you own Rand McNally — huh — Worldmaster Atlas (word chosen most inadvisedly). Fact is, Thor, old son, the town of Atlas, Pa. (population 1,574 when last heard from) bears an ignominious asterisk signifying 'omitted from the maps because of scale size or lack of space... approximate loca tion only.' So a fan'd never find me in square D-8, no matter how hard he looked, though he'd easy-as-falling-off-a-log hit on such trash as Bodines, Shunk and West Milton. For shame! And there's tons more of it: grievance, humiliation, I mean. I marvel I never before thought of it — thunk it —but I should opt out right now. And then the universe can drop on all trash-atlases and trash towns. A name so often taken in vain or not at all had best be let lapse. I'd be better off as brother Prometheus, just for a day, except I grow nauseous at his very name, even 'Pro' his nickname, and my liver's none too good anyway, what with all the insupportable standing I've had to do since grammar school. No half-decent eagle'd touch it. I'm varicose to the navel." Oh, I thought, daftly, to see him! His navel or his face. But this Atlas is only a voice; so far, anyway. "Well," he resumed. "That was a beginning of sorts, wasn't it? 331</page><page sequence="11">Paul West We'll be on farting terms soon. A beginner's beginning, that's what it was. I don't come from a very intellectual family, so it isn't much my fault. Great Grandad Uranus, he was forever getting catcalled in the roadways by greenhorns whose only claim to fame was in playing midnight stinkfinger with poxdoctored nymphs. Ur, he was all balls was he, at least until —who was that feisty young bastard? — Cronus, cocky Cronus, sliced them off with one swipe of a sickle, and they plunged into the sea like two collided blimps. Out of that dreadful churning, Aphrodite was born, so the old mythical commercial has it; up here I hear all the rumors, few of the home-truths. Then there was Gaea, my Great Grandma, about whom I know only that she was earthy to a fault. A word to the wise, Thor, my lad? Whereas Grandad Oceanus, bless him, I've altogether better memory of, fondly remember him as Old H20 who tucked me in at night, gentle and hospitable even when he was locked away in his West Coast White House retreat with Tethys, getting a breather from all the parliamentary-minded gods. About Tethys herself, who knows? In the books I've seen it says, See Oceanus, except you can't, and, in any event, he never told, unless his opinion was somehow incorporated into his long beard, the bull's horns and crab's claws on his head, and the clique of sea monsters always surrounding him. I'm not keeping you from some thing, am I?" I explained I was overcome to hear from him, not having heard ever before. "I'm a maiden audience," I blurted, not meaning quite that, but he took it in his stride and really warmed up. "As for Dad, well he —Pops Iapetus —got himself exiled to the Tartar Steppe for breaking the peace by trying to postpone the twilight of the gods (or the twilight of some of them anyway). I'm not that keen on him, never was, prefer to write him off under an alias (those old Greeks were all disguises!): I'm thinking of Japheth, the third son of Noah, ancestor of the Indo-European race. The hell with it, it's an out for Pops. Big of me, that. A born loser he was, and by no means a thinker, he'd married Mom, née Asia, only out of geographical grandiosity, see? Forever after was known as Asia's Minor. Later on, after they'd taken Pops away, she changed her name to something whorish and started fucking the sun, but by then I had chores of my own to tend, had already forgotten my childhood (if I had any at all). Of my three brothers, Menoetius (couldn't even spell it!) didn't last long, got himself exiled with Pops, and then there were two: the after and the fore of things, 332</page><page sequence="12">Paul West Epimetheus, a bull-headed and impetuous chap, just the kind you'd expect to tie up with a know-it-all bitch like Pandora, and, of course, Big Brother Pro, already mentioned: he of the legendary forethought, a thief and a cosmic climber, a masochist and a sitter in and a smuggler. Lots more as well, none of it good. Pro, I vouch for it, was Henry Kissinger the First, his true ambition being to set himself up on a mountain as big as mine; hence that notorious forwarding address in the Caucasus. I never had a sister. What? Thought you said something mighty American there. But I reckon I must have had various bastard brothers, I mean bastard brothers who were even bigger bastards than the brothers legit. Forgive such outbursts. If you can. They come upon me, flash, and I'm undone quite. I'm the emotional brother. It's the result of holding the whole bloody thing up all the time, like always having to have an erection: not even time to pee, to scratch, have a perfunctory fidget. I was talking about sisters, wasn't I, and having none, though what with such goings-on as Uranus's being both the son and husband of Gaea, therefore being his own Dad, and Tethys's being old H20's wife and sister, thus making him his own brother, I'm glad I didn't. Of daughters, though, give or take a few by-blows never logged, I reckon I've had as many as twenty, at least a round dozen. Hyades. Pleiades. Hesperides. Bless 'em all! No wonder they said each of my sperms — the successful ones, anyway, who made it past Immigration —had a twat in him, ready-made, the reason being I was too much man myself; I'd overload the sex balance in space. It's as good an alibi as any (to use the word loosely), and the best in the world for someone whom the world fell on for no ac ceptable reason and who, ever since, has had a monkey and much else on his back. Libya's my stomping-ground, ether's my halo,· I'm multiform, dispersed and mute; I'm the prototype of those who Put Up with things; I shiver or sweat, I buckle or sway, but I stand fast. Such was my ancient, scurvy contract, which to de serve I must've committed some unspeakable infamy. Lord, what I wouldn't have given in the bad old days for a good agent! Or even an attorney. Too late now. It must've been something I did in my sleep, I wouldn't knowingly have done anything a hundredth as bad. As you and most folk know. Time out now for a breath-pause and a slight adjustment; something's out of kilter in Orion, I reckon. I've sure got an itch I hadn't seconds ago. Now I'm inhal ing. Hear that? In-h-a-l-e. Atlas's hale and heart all over again, ready for more. Thor? You still there?" 333</page><page sequence="13">Paul West If you have ever had a bullhorn in your skull, you'll know how he sounded, yet I'd heard him louder in even this short acquaintance. I went upstairs for aspirin, though still tuned in to Atlas, and clutching the tape recorder. I found a new tape in the so-called study (desk, chair, no books), and while I was swallowing he started up again, somewhat modulated. "Here I am, just as good as before, same call letters, identical vocation, but just a teensy-weeny bit more fed up than I was. If that's imaginable. You don't know how good it feels to be sounding off into the one available ear, old son. Odd, I'd always, over the long centuries, thought myself an iron man, indeed the only man for the job of Upholding Things, but I was only rationalizing when I thought that. Once upon a time, Hercules stood in for me, did a good job, oh yes, but was soon on his way again. That was the only stroll I ever took. And now, I confess it, I'm well on the way to my first nervous breakdown. Honest. It shows in the way I talk, don't it? Twitchy, jagged, hypertensive stuff. It'll soon be worse, mark my words. And then the whole damned universe'd better watch out. Blind, malicious old Homer called me 'the thinker of mischief,' you know; well, that's OK by me, you have to let poets get away with something now and then. But I reserve the right to earn my reputation!" Then he cannot, I reassured myself, read my mind: I know what Homer called him, having just read it in Seyffert. Here I was think ing he was all-knowing, some kind of omniscient revenant of the airwaves, and he's not. But maybe he's in the habit of repeating things, just out of boredom. Funny how he shuts up as soon as I begin to think in my own right. "But that old riff," he went on, a bit subdued-sounding, "in the handbooks about my being located — urhem — in the west, that's too limiting by half." Atlas in a sulk. Irrelevantly, I thought at once of saloons, gunfights at the OK Corral, stampedes and ten-gallon hats, then of Oswald Spengler being Jeremiah. "The truth's more nearly this." He'd again seemed to wait for me to complete my competing thought. "The West's part of the scene I sustain, but only part. I refuse to be located entire in one of my parts, or even to be thought favoring one brood of daughters (the Hesperides, natch) over the other two. Sensible? Of course. To get back: I was saying I'd reached the point of no return, was sick of supporting the whole show, of the way everything depended on 334</page><page sequence="14">Paul West me, as if the best of me were out on perpetual loan. Know how that feels? A career of sponsorship. All very well to think of my self as the man with the portable universe — portable to nowhere. I was more like a meal ticket for Creation, or, to change the figure (as Perseus, the Red Baron of Hyperborea, changed me for being a lousy host), more a rock than an identity. Atlas's there, steady as, etc.' 'We can always count on him.' 'No need to do anything for him. He has no needs, needs only the needs of others.' Such were the time-honored Atlas-assininities. My one privilege was to claim all my dependants as long as they possessed me. Huh. And a whole string of huhs. Now I claim me. I want my own exemption, see. These are the first words in the campaign for Atlas Unattached, his dugs for once unsucked, his udder swollen to bursting, his power to maintain devoted to himself alone. I'm talking about AUTONOMY, son!" "Of course," I parroted. "Autonomy. I know what that is. I've gone to a peck of trouble to cultivate a case of it for myself." Emboldened-sounding (not that he needed a backer), Atlas talked on, now droning, now mustering a semi-shout. "There's only one problem: how to duck from underneath in time, before the heavens fall. One shoulder I'd be able to whip clear all right, but the other? Heavens, I'd lose a foot, a leg, at least. It's all a matter of this's, where I stand non-stop, being a No Lone Zone: where you should never be alone, not if you expect to get out unscathed. Atlas alone can't do it. That's his lot of bad luck, see. I'd be maimed for sure, but that's beside the main fact: my very act of stepping down'd abolish the world I'd step into. What a bind. To survive I've to stay put; escape's just suicide. So, in a sense, I Atlas hold up not only the heavens but also Atlas as well, like some giant reflexive truss. That's the dilemma I've chomped on since (as the legend goes) Zeus, filthy old instigator of everything, decided to pay me back for— for what? I hardly even know. It certainly couldn't have been hubris: only mortals like yourself get up to that; yours is the monopoly, so to speak. So maybe it came under lèse-majesté, which I gather you can still commit in the land of Britain by affixing a monarch's-head stamp upside down on an envelope. To hell with it, I did nothing serious. And to hell, I follow up, with the conse quences of stepping out from under; so, if suddenly this confiden tial tirade ends, you'll know what's up. What's down. I just might do it, out of spite, say, and then I'd be in the funny position not of the narrator whose very voice expounding in the past tense tells 335</page><page sequence="15">Paul West you he survived but of the silenced narrator whose cessation tells you he didn't. In that case, how did he begin? Answer: the tale he was interrupted in telling, tale of woe or not, wasn't the tale of his own death. What I think I'm driving at is that a dead narrator can't cheat. There are no dead narrators; there are plenty of dead ex narrators, but no narrating dead. The zombie's an oral zero. Right? Gob (I'll not use D for Β even if it kills me), Gob, what vomit this is. Were I genuinely in the west, which isn't so much a place as an instrument, I'd be a genuine writer: set it all down with 2B (or 4F) pencil on —Atlas-sized sheets of course, twenty-six by thirty-three by thirty-four inches. Newspaper size." My scalp had begun to tingle, my head to buzz, aspirin or no. Playing back the Atlas tapes now, at this late date, in order to transcribe them (the tape I cannot bear to part with), I feel the same sensations all over again, plus giddiness, even after that voice is out of my head into the metal. Press on, I tell myself, don't get flustered this early on. "Anyone but me," I hear myself ventriloquizing for silent Atlas, "can buy those things they call alibi tapes: the sounds of airport, restaurant, surf: run the tape, then call a friend (or an enemy, like Zeus) and unreel your lies. 'Sorry, they're calling my flight now, I'll have to hang up.' Or, 'Sorry, here comes the roast duck à la marinated angel or whatever it is.' Or 'Stormy, I can't talk now, the tide's just lapping the phone cradle.' And so forth. But not me, I can't ever be in another place; never an alibi for Atlas. The crimes I commit I commit where I stand; I'm always at the scene of the crime, can't even voluptuously revisit it. I've quite literally no where to go, for here —as the copycat Romans are soon going to say —is everywhere: Res ipsissississima, the thing at its utter very mostest wherever it's at. Stupid language, that, not a patch on our ancient Greek. Do you know what they, not the Romans but the slander-mongers, used to say?" Orally hypnotized, I answer. "What?" "'Atlas's weakening,' they'd say. And then Atlas showed 'em. Canted up a big toe of the right foot, and Istanbul trembled. Flexed a triceps, set off an earthquake in Japan. Sneezed, and Krakatoa erupted. Farted, and the U.S. Coast Guard at once began firstnam ing the turbulence Agnes, Bertha, Cassie." One way or the other, Atlas was mad, or even insanely furious. Two mads in one. His mad is up, his mad is down. Vox A. just went on, however, now golden with vehemence. 336</page><page sequence="16">Paul West "Achronicity I calls it. All time is available to me, as you've no doubt noticed. It takes a bit of getting used to (even harder for the likes of you), but it can be super fun —ur, sometimes. I do some times like to have me a bit of fun, whereas brothers Pro and Epi never did. Like to, I mean, although they sometimes had some fun by accident — like when Pro set his hands ablaze with lighter fluid and Epi the scatterbrain set about making Man (haha) but only after handing out the best gifts to the animal kingdom: might and speed and guts and guile, fur, feathers, wings, shells and tails. Eff them both. I'd rather be an American football star, or, in quieter vein, a college tutor who takes a brisk stroll through the autumn leaves in the quadrangle, tetrangle I'd call it, where a few students are tossing a ball around, before going in for toast and tea by a blazing log fire, after which he reads Plato until the dinner bell. Sherry, chops and port. That kind of self-contained, cozy deal. I'd settle for any kind of chronic, which is a far cry from what I've got on my plate right now. In fact it's not even in the realm of far cry ing at all." Taking time out to wrinkle my mind at his weird, ersatz idiom, compact of Fifties slang and jock earthiness, I held him up, but only briefly. Crude he might have been, but his maimers were good; no one, I reckoned, had ever heard him out before. Or heard period. "Anyway, thanks to achronicity," he said, calmer, "I can at least think of it, half-master myself into living it. A kind of vicarious retirement. 'Scuse me a moment, it's time for the checklist." Then he picked up again, but in hushed, near-sanctimonious tones: "1. Inspect the pillars of the universe by squinting up, then down. All in order: Heaven and Earth still somewhat apart. 2. Twist clockwise once, then twist back: ur, the terminator should be along the Greenwich-Fiji line. Is. A-OK. 3. Count all the nonmili tary aircraft currently groping above the surface: Tri-Stars, Con cordes, Ilyushins. I make it four thousand three hundred, only two in the act of going down. Both cases of pilot error. Just like flies reconnoitering a Zeusturd, I must say. 4. Now say aloud: '"To bear on his back forever The cruel strength of the crushing world And the vault of the sky. Upon his shoulders the great pillar That holds apart the earth and heaven, A load not easy to be borne.'" 337</page><page sequence="17">Paul West Choke-voiced, he explains: "My sentence, see? Zeus put on the black cap and read it slow, and my knees began to give, even then. Anyway, there I'd said it again. I feel better with that bloody rub bish off my chest. Now I've to say another, which was the rider to the sentence. Listen. '"Monumental hunchback, Atlas I Will not invite peripety,· And further will not claim Copyright on Atlas's name.' Did you ever hear such bull?" I wondered who wrote that for Zeus and was just going to ask when he cheered up and began to gabble. "Sorry for that distraction; has to be done. But, at least, I don't have to waste time eating, sleeping and so on. When I pee, even, it's only a mime,· I pee air. After all, when a titan takes on the globe as well as the sky, he needs to concentrate. One silly wobble'd foul things up. I once thought of composing an autobiography, you know, better termed an anautoabiomimesis, which means a non self's non-life imitated, or simply Zilch, but I only kept on accu mulating epigraphs and couldn't get beyond them: after going on twenty-seven thousand august quotations I still wasn't even at first base. All I did was write down T and then, like a cop com mandeering a taxi, say 'Follow that pronoun!' But it came out mighty weird, you understand: the first person in all languages from Greek to Sanskrit, from Hebrew to Malagasy. Just imagine, after twenty-seven thousand epigraphs, being unable to come up with anything better than 'Ego, Ich, Yo, Io, Je, Ic, Ih, Eg, Jag, Jeg, Ek, Azu, Me, Aham, A, Ja, Ke, Ai, Wo, En, Ek, Jeg, Pu, J, Aj, Ani, Y-es, Inks, Is, Eu, Koy, Ngai, Ahni, Owau, Saja, Akero, Izaho, get ting bolder and bolder all the time of course, AKEN, IZAHO, et cetera, but... I... ur... a boy of five collecting basement spiders in a box would have more material than I did." "Excuse me," I interrupted. "You said Jeg twice. I used to be a travel agent, and I spot things like that with ease." "Fuck it," he said, and went on delivering himself of his remorse ful voluntary. "Freud and Jung swapping dreams during a trans atlantic voyage have more in common than I with life as others live it. A cricket outside in the cold, trying like hell to stridulate but achieving only the sound of a match being struck in vain — fth, fth — is in better voice. Marcello Sharif, movie star, who con ducts a protracted affair with an airline stewardess by flying from 338</page><page sequence="18">Paul West city to city with her, has more sense of direction. The man who takes a whole year to read one issue of the New York Times, until in fact the issue of the same day, next year, arrives, has more sense of urgency. Impotence is too grand a word for so complete a nullity as mine. I'm beat before I begin, and that's fact." I thought then, I think it now: he grows on you, into you, through you; sometimes is damned nearly you. He — "In the end, all I managed after the most frenzied exercise of all my faculties was a rumor, which I let fall into the airwaves. Impure malice, it read as follows: 'strong possibility carbon-dioxide BREATHING LIMBED MAMMALIAN ENTITIES 12-36 INCHES TALL IN COMBINATION AT SURFACE JUPITER MARINER 666 SECOND PARABOLA CLOSEUP PASS CBS REUTER AP STAY TUNED THIS CHANNEL FURTHER details.' Quietly, like the horizontal ship's mast in the physics problem, it flowed leftward from right across the bottom of the entire world's screens, incongruous conveyor-belt for Atlas at his most Antic. Crying 'Plagiarism,' Orson Welles went into cardiac arrest, I gather, while the hotline in the red telephone in the White House was unlocked." It was as if his voice had grinned, worldly wide. "Then I canceled the whole thing. Wiped it out." "You just erased it like that?" He answered me not. "That ended my first attempt at anautoabiomimesis." Flashily facetious, I said, "Then it wasn't anautoabiomimetic enough, as Aristotle might say!" But he ignored me again. "Instead, during the whole decline and fall of Egypt, I kept on tell ing myself: 'One plus two plus three plus four all squared equals a hundred.' Very soothing. Something to count on. A clue to some universal harmony I'd been exempted from. No? Well, anyway, ur — I'll come to other ideas about that later on. After later, in fact. I'm achronic, remember. The stumbling-block, it turned out, was my name: at least, regarded achronically, with full feedback and retrieval at full blast, plus flashes pro- and epi-, that's how it looked. It all comes back to A.T.L.A.S. Book of maps. Illustrated com pendium. Big size of paper. Man-column. Man with a great burden. Mountain or mountains. ICBM. Even a bone at the top of the neck. Even a misguided overdeveloped case of muscles with enough hubris to call himself Charles Atlas You Too Can Have A Body Like Mine! And there's more, lamentably much more. I've been spread too thin, as if my identity were marmalade of roses. Oh, the crap I have to take! And bear in mind it's me you get when you 339</page><page sequence="19">Paul West say Atlantis or Atlantic. Imagine —you don't have to —being so dispersed, so cheap a household name, so miscellaneous, whereas true dignity consists in singular application: Zeus is Zeus, I guess, and nothing else, whatever to the contrary gets said in the West. Adam's Adam. Christ's Christ in perpetuity. So I deplore the appli cation of JFK to an airport (same goes for Dulles), of mustang and jaguar to cars, of (a primarily British fault) such names as Hercules, typhoon and —ur, Blenheim to aircraft. Of the notorious craft be nightedly dubbed the Armstrong-Whitworth Atlas, I've nothing to say. No comment. No commentary." "Yes," I interjected, "but what about the Anti-Atlas Range?" "Shit." "And Atlas, Pa., pop. — " "Flaff !" A new word to me, it — "Don't you all know what flaff is? Flaff's the condition of negli gibility raised to its exponential maximum." All I could think was God help him, he wants it both ways: recognition and privacy, fame and inwardness. He's one gigantic odi et amo, love and hate in one bollixed-up ball. No wonder: where he comes from, a light year's a mere wink. What was he saying? He didn't say, but he sure as hellfire was coming out with this: "— that in itself being sufficient reason for retirement. Unbudg ing, I became a thing, virtually thoughtless, taken for granted like a mailbox or the smell of leather. Thought a dunce, a dunce I be came; become one, I thought more duncelike, duncishly, than ever, just to outdo them." "It happens to the best of men," I moaned. "I know." "What say they? Let them say," he quoted. "Sticks and stones may break my bones, but what they say can't — as a matter of fact it's hurt me a lot. More than I've ever told. He resumed. "Why, the last newspaper I read before stirring myself to this fairly agonizing appraisal of self and status made me look even more foolish than usual. It so happened the type'd been garbled and the caption to some photograph read thus: 'Conferring before testifying at Ways and Means Committee are anti-tax advocates, from left, Vivien More than 500,000 geese fly through the area twice a year, at Kent State University, and actress Gloria Swanson.' I never lived down Vivien More than 500,000 geese. The heavens resounded with it, terra firma spun giddily, and the little cosmic 340</page><page sequence="20">Paul West dogs I imagine (but only half-imagine) come to cock their legs to pee against the twin columns of my calves —Bach, Bruckner, Beethoven and Buxtehude I call 'em —they actually nipped my ankles, tickled with their tongues between my toes. I swayed several times before regaining my balance, and then a chorus began of 'Atlas can't read!' Bad luck maybe, and that's all; but you can see how it affected me. When the All's available, even without being asked for, you've got to keep it straight. Between then and now I've not read a single word, hence my lack of knowledge on certain topics. My job was to hold up —well, you know; I won't labor the point —and to do that as mindlessly as I wanted to. Which ex plains, if anything can, all this humbug and bumbling." I thought how hard he was on himself, couldn't figure out why he'd kept silent all this time. Sent to Coventry, he'd been in that city when it was bombed to bits in World War Two. "I'm left with one thought," he then told me, his voice gravid with gentleness. "It appalls. I believe I hold up what I hold up (not in any sense delaying it), but I've no proof, and to prove it one way or another's grievous; if I'm right in my belief, I won't survive the proof; yet if I'm wrong I won't be able to live with myself, not after standing in this position like a dummy since the year One with out so much as a week's leave, a day's truancy. Skip Hercules, he doesn't rate. I can't count that little episode, anyway, because I was still on duty, even when away getting him those goddamned golden apples. When he assumed the load, he perhaps waited until I was out of sight, and then sat down, the lazy bastard, and took it easy until just before I came back. And the whole shebang stayed put. As it always will. When I returned, told him he could jolly well go on holding it up, and he tricked me into reassuming things (so's, he said, he could stick a pad on his shoulders to ease the pres sure), he was only fooling. Had I then just walked away, saying 'Screw you, Here,' I'd have been free to roam an unfoundered Earth beneath a suspended Heaven. Imagine! Instead of conning me back into service, he actually double-conned me into a wholly redundant servitude. The answer's plain. I have to do it now, better late than never, eh? Walk away on my own two feet. Come on, Thor! Tell me to do it, and I will." Obligingly I said, "Shove off, Atlas! Be brave." I said it again, with more rank, more mustache. Nothing. "No, go," I finally heard him say. "I'm stuck. I daren't. I'd rather put up with everything than not be. I'm not feeling responsible, 341</page><page sequence="21">Paul West I'm just being selfish." I urged him again. "Attaboy, Atlas!" My shout must have jolted the tape recorder going in, it fairly split my eardrums as it came out; but Atlas, I gathered, did not shift a jot. "None of me moves," he wailed. "Feet, this is mind: move. No, it's no use. I'm paralyzed." "Try again, Atlas. Concentrate." I really cared; I was worked up, more excited than I'd been since my coronary. "For just a millisecond, maybe," I heard, "I could dart out from under, see if anything begins to topple, and, if so, resume position. How's that sound?" "Great idea. Do it." "No. 'Atlas,' I tell myself, 'you'd better think hard about the headaches, the weight, the pressure. Do they correspond to a real burden? All the gravity there is and ever was? Or, as may well be, aren't they imaginary? Minutely accurate responses to a fictitious situation? All this time, your cranium, shoulders, trunk, and legs, have settled into a bearing stance, a hunch, when all along there wasn't an ounce to lift. Think of the tennis smash perfectly exe cuted minus the ball, or the uppercut that strikes no chin, or the condemned man's recoil from the firing squad's volley of blanks.' I have to be right about this. It's quite a step I'm contemplating." He was going in circles, ever-decreasing ones at that, and I couldn't for the life of me face an Atlas who ended up disappearing into his own fundament. No, not that! Surely an ex-travel agent might help him. Guide his tour. "All right," I said. "The weight's imaginary." One little twitch fidget sideways would help him, buck him up. "Got it," he cried. "I'll step out from under just as imaginarily, see, and not a scrap will fall. Done it. Now I'm back in position. Safe as houses. Were I really to do it, the universe'd only have itself to blame, wouldn't it? In fact, the universe's always its own fault, whereas I'm my own. Truth told, Atlas's doomed to be imaginative enough, although not very imaginative all told, to talk himself into staying put, thus sentencing himself to a penal infinity. That's the sentence: having to inflict my guesswork on myself, not hav ing to uphold. The punishment's mental, not physical at all. Well, either I'll break free now or forever shelve the question. Do I count or don't I? Done. The next voice you will hear is — ur, why don't you say something? I'm in a proper funk up here." 342</page><page sequence="22">Paul West I wanted to, but I couldn't; I felt more stuck than he at that juncture. Besides, something malign, maybe even satanic, was seeping through my system: deep down, I wanted him to stay put; being static is what had made him famous, whereas trotting around ad lib he'd be just another pedestrian. Fixed, he'd be talkable-with, available, footloose, just another picaro, with eons of delusive self discipline to make up for. I'd found a garrulous, massive friend, and I didn't want to lose him. So I told him to keep calm, to stay put, shelve the whole dilemma, and I would do the same. I would stay put in Pekin, Illinois, and, indeed, so modify my life-style as to match his, and then we could mutually converse on the same footing, even-stephen and hunkydory. Let Atlas do as Atlas is, and Thor copy. But I no sooner thought that than I began to withdraw from the consequences; understand, if you will, the embarrassments of being a vicarious voice: I hearing Atlas uttered him, but in no way managing to reproduce the intonations, nuances or even the tart symphonic thrust of the voice I heard. And now, thanks be Fortune, Atlas is coming out as words, and I'm in the near-fatuous position of transposing a voice-in-the-head, but spoken into the tape by myself, into yet another medium, of which not even my best friend, Etna, would call me master. What is indisputably missing is the electric thrill of his very presence, a kind of massive vibrancy that makes you feel you've been plugged, for the first time, into the source of things. So it was much more than awoice I communi cated with, for me at any rate; it was the Atlas of that fourth century B.c. vase painting, in which he appears as a light-limbed boxer holding up both arms in a victory salute, except that resting on his palms there is a lightweight-looking flying saucer, maybe of aluminum, while to his left there prances a magical horse near some bushes, to his right there stands somebody giving him the two-finger sign, to which Atlas attends by looking sideways and a bit downward. I know this is a feeble account of the picture, doing scant justice to his in-trim insouciance, but it will have to serve. After all, I didn't ask him to come to me; there are thousands he'd have fared better with, but perhaps my being a former world traveler who has settled down, prizing myself on my ability to stay put, had something to do with it. In common we have the static, not to mention an overview of the world, and a developed sense of being excluded: he from liberty (or even rest or leave), I from Peking. 343</page><page sequence="23">Paul West Clearly, anyone determined to object will at once accuse me of imagining the whole thing; let him pass in peace and go on to read about the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. I faced that ob jection from the outset, knowing that from time to time I would catch myself half-supplying Atlas with Atlasisms; but then, a good listener always psychs and second-guesses, and even U.N. trans lators have been known to come up with prophetic renderings: three or four words of translation before the original is uttered. Such poachings or previsions are part of cranial voxology, take my word for it, just as I went on taking Atlas's own. When the Voice of the Ages (or whatever) deigns to favor you with some friendly gab, you don't make picayune cracks about the quality of recep tion, the speed or slowness of the transmission, the timbre of his vowels, and you certainly don't mind that occasionally you get lost in him, he in you, the pair of you in the maze of triply-transposed transcription. Man can always, if he weakens, go ape, whereas ape can never go man; I sometimes tell myself that when especially lamenting some gross piece of international mayhem. It soothes me somewhat; it's half-true; and it's five seconds killed. Just think how Atlas had to kill time, always at his station, never resting, always under the circumstances, never without an ache; no wonder he learned how to make the mind go blank. Blank brought me back to the crisis at hand. Tempted to breach civility and counsel Atlas to shit or get off the pot, I ferreted around in my own head for some way of helping him either to adjust or to strike clear and away. Mentally ready to shift, he was too far gone for the physical part, meaning he could always imagine himself out of anything; stoical duty had groomed him too well. Was I right in encouraging him to stay where, and as, he was? Was that selfish? Not if I made a sacrifice or two myself. What Atlas needed wasn't an initiative, but company, and so long as his voice kept on coming I'd be more than glad to partner him. Therefore, keep it coming by the gift of company non-stop! Invite him in, not only into my head, but into my life. Have him, somehow, meet Frank Etna, landlord extraordinary; share in the stapling of the daily longer sherry-sack cape; fill him in on food and the pleasures of the American bathroom. . . The only one elect, so far as I knew, I was elated; my eyes leaked driblets of joy, my hands quivered with fellow-feeling. "Are you there?" I asked him. "Any things you want to know? That 344</page><page sequence="24">Paul West you don't already. Or things you want done?" There ensued the kind of silence in which you imagine you can hear plants growing. Heedless of plants, I asked again, prefixing the question with his call letters enlivened into Aardvark, Tabernacle, Labium, Aardvark, Sabbath. And that fetched him back. Laughing (a sound of heavy chains being twirled in thick oil), he gave an answer I didn't expect: "Why has the Astronomer-Royal quit Greenwich, and its meridian, and moved to Sussex? Why didn't the English epicure stay put, like me? It's disorienting. And disoccidentalizing as well." I said something about pollution, peace, urban overspill, heard an Atlas-snort followed by another question: "Haven't I seen gold plated telescopes mounted in Lear jets?" He had indeed; I'd seen orb-torque, neutrino-nests, galaxy-starvation, antenna-warp, dust ball pool, nova-fishing, sungunnery, nebul-ovens, mirror-zero, Mars exemption, gamma-slang and quasar-cosmetics. As well as much more, a quick and humbling sample of the cosmic Sears and Roe buck catalogue. All I could retaliate with was something else I'd heard on TV, something about the end of the universe: "After thirty thousand million years more," I brashly told him, "the whole thing will come to rest and then begin to contract. Whether the universe will then bounce back is anyone's guess. I won't be here to check the answers." All I could hear was galactic buzz. Told him so. Where was he? Still only the buzz. What is it then? "We call it interferon," he said haughtily. "Nothing to do with the terrestrial common cold, something —not that anyone in your vicinity'd understand it —to do with argon. You guys don't want to be facetious, else the powers-that-be'll lay three dozen second comings on you, all on Fridays, just to fox you. You'd better not smartmouth about the End of anything; we don't deal in ends, we deal in currencies, nothing to do with money either!" Somehow Atlas was ruder, that was it; confidence gained had sapped his manners, and I was just going to object when I thought better of it. After all (and when I thought that phrase I really meant it: he was After All), who knows how many eons he'd spent trying to get through. So I just said, "Sorry: never being in the know gets us on the raw. 345</page><page sequence="25">Paul West We act up verbally when our minds draw blanks." "You're wondering, I bet, why I'm so goddamned astronomical!" True, I was. Occupational — ur, hazard, buddy-boy. Skip it. Maybe you can tell me the meaning of a phrase I caught the other year: 'World Premiere Encore.' If you ask me, that's contradictory." I apologized for the golden tongues of Madison Avenue, drawing his attention to fool's gold, muck and brass, and the overall deteri oration of the language, the disappearance of the verb, the plague of the abstract noun and the emasculated verb, the verb to be. "By the way, Thor," I heard next, "there was no Big Bang. Had there been one, I'd have known. It's always been steady state up here, just the gods that reel now and then. Took me a mite of time to realize it, but I'm the main part of that steadiness. I never had a beginning, I always was, and all that shit about Pops and Grandad is just a concession to cosmic respectability. I'm an uncaused ef fect, no doubt the first of the tribe you've ever beat gums with." Gulping "For sure, for sure," I asked him if he knew about — oh, a random sampling of our daily lives down here — passports, cucumbers, waste disposals, penicillin, fiber-point pens, hi-fi equip ment, air conditioning, mouthwash, scotch tape, scissors, DDT and Neapolitan ice cream. He knew the lot, seemed vaguely bored with it, and delivered me a counterquota of Atlas-tropes, none of which I understood. A change of tack was imperative — it was no use slanging each other with our respective systems — to quiz him about such of his past as hadn't made the primers in myth. "Did you ever get to college? If you have them there?" "Pro, he spent three light-years at Panbridge, and Epi about the same time —amount of time —at Luxford. But me, I was a dropout, took some evening classes in weightlifting at the Vulcan Institute, but I found even that a bore. I guess I was only antici pating my vocation. Fact is, there was nothing lying around heavy enough for me to practice on, so it's just as well there was a uni verse handy. Else I'd have been out of commission for keeps. Just imagine what it's like being eternal when there's not a thing you can do." Quick as a fisherman setting the hook, I asked him, "If that's so, why all the fuss about suicide? No such thing for you. Why, you could walk out from under, and even if it all came tumbling down, you'd be OK. Although where you'd be, I've no idea." 346</page><page sequence="26">Paul West His life, he told me, was his occupation, his worst fear being choreless. "I prefer world-sadness, world-weariness," he added, "to being unemployed. But it's not all been depressing. Back in the '30s I think it was, my daughter Maia, best known as the mother of Mercury, talked up such a storm in the ether that a team of air plane designers actually designed and built a mother flying-boat called after her, with a smaller but four-engined second flying-boat atop her on a mount, and that was Mercury. Eight engines between them! I dearly loved to watch them lift off the old briny, not so much wine-dark as beer-bright, and then Mercury would lift off from the mother ship at about five thousand feet. And then they played tag all over the airways, Mercury feinting at her hull as if trying to suck on her babylike, and Maia lumbering about a bit being so broad in the beam. He zipped and flitted, she droned and mumbled; he caught more of the light than she, his wings like blades, while she, with much broader wings, seemed like some giant manta-ray cruising ever below him in case he fell." Did I detect a throb in that rusty voice? I did indeed. "Proud of your grandson, Atlas?" "Maia, one of the seven Pleiades, you know, she was the smartest of them all, got herself written up in the glossies as Maia Majestas, Fauna, Bona Dea, Ops, the whole bit. I guess she'd rate as the Madonna of unfolded space. Mercury, though, he'd the smarts be yond compare; it figures, I guess, if you're Maia to begin with and old Zeusy-Boy slips you a foaming schlong's-length, ur — it figures you'd get a prodigy of some kind out of that. He once stole, and hid in a cave, fifty head of cattle; yep, Hermes, as I sometimes call him —Herm or Merc —was one of the first cattle rustlers in pre history! As they always say about him, born in the a.m., he's in vented the lyre by noon. That's the kind of speed he flew at. Sure, he was a big show-off even as a kid, but who wants a dumbbell for a grandson? Merc was some boy, fast as light, slippery-tongued, impossible to best in an argument; spent a good deal of his time operating as a Western Union galactogram-bearer, though he did hundreds of other things as well — a kind of winged cartel. I some times thought he'd taken on too much — agronomy, rhetoric, business management, heraldry, boxing, languages, astronomy, communications and even funeral-parlor practice, you name it, he did a bit of it, sometimes even a lot. What really poisoned him was the cult they made of him on your own planet, casing up little 347</page><page sequence="27">Paul West blobs of him in glass bulbs to tell the temperature by. He liked the functional part, but hated the cooped-up feeling the mercury trans mitted back to him. But, boy, when he flew, like a tiny fast moon round his Ma, there was red-shift to beat all, and for days after there was background rainbow fit to beat the band. Where those sea planes went to, we never found out; maybe mothballed some place. I guess it was one hell of an impractical idea, having one on the other's back like that, dolphin on the whale, and the fuel con sumption was out of sight. But it kind of made the family loom a bit larger than usual in the suburbs, see? Instead of being so shadowy (see the pesky ikons they made of me!), we seemed to be substantially there right in front of folks' eyes, like architecture, except it moved, and when it moved it took off and flew, and when it flew it split in half and when it'd split in half it stole parabolas from the spherical geometry of Zeus himself! But they always had to touch down separately, of course, which kind of spoiled the action. I always wished they'd been able somehow to link up again in flight, but I guess that was asking too much. Say, maybe, some day, you could find out for me about that double-decker airplane, where it's at now, what decided them to junk it. Just the sound of those engines blasting for the Off'd remove tons from the load on the top of my head. Try?" Try? I promised I'd succeed, certain I could dig up something somewhere in the campus library. But why, I mused, didn't he know? Maybe part of his punishment was to feel informed with out having the facts. Maybe he knew, after all, but no longer real ized that he knew,· a fact unused is one of knowledge's pariahs. It was no use wondering, Atlas was already into other things, still joyfully commemorating Maia, but more intimate in tone. "Once in a while, she'd zoom up behind me and give me a neck rub, working all the way from below my shoulder blades up to the base of my skull, kneading and smoothing until the blood began to run again. You've never ported, have you? But you sure know what it's like to have a stiff neck, when the cords feel like leather bound drill sticks. But that wasn't all, no sir! Round front, with daughterly delicacy, she'd nuzzle the bridge of my nose, tweak it and pinch it and sometimes put the balls of her thumbs against the top of the eyesockets. Talk about relief! You know the kind of ache that builds up around there. And, on special days, she'd even nip the flesh between my eyes with her teeth —I must be the only guy in creation with hickeys in that particular spot. A great one 348</page><page sequence="28">Paul West for kissing, she was, my Maia: not just the routine stuff, glancing little smooches on the side of my mouth and the tip of my nose, that goes without saying, but when the mood took her she'd pre tend I'd (as she'd say) fifteen thousand secret ears, visible to her alone, and she'd go about kissing each of them in turn. Of course, she didn't, but that was our fancy. Who was I to protest or be literal? It was the only attention I ever got, therefore the best. To cool me off, she'd blow against my closed eyes—you can't imagine the glare I have to put up with, this near umpteen suns — and then she'd just set her head against the side of my neck and stay that way for long hours, murmuring and cooing. A cool, velvet skin she had, like a tegument made of milk. 'Scuse the fancy way of putting it, there're times I get downright sentimental about the way things were. She'd even, once a month, clean my back; I mean squeeze out the black holes, clean out the pores. It was mostly accumulated cosmic dust, I guess. Time was I never knew where my back ended and space began, so I guess it's no miracle I was pitted with tiny craters where shrunken stars of almost incalcu lable gravity stuck and stayed put, all the time getting smaller and heavier, black to the point of invisibility. It's not everyone who'd take on such chores, but Maia did — at least until she had Mercury. He kept her busy from the first, conned her into being less flighty, I guess. He even persuaded her to stop one habit she had; instead of wearing false eyelashes for a social occasion —a state visit by Zeus, all tuxedo and talc —she used to fasten a couple of hum mingbirds to her eyelids, and that gave her eyes an incredible hypnotic flutter. Yes sir, those were the old days! Been none like 'em since." There is a slight sob in his voice; I try to cheer him, cannot; he sighs with enormous resonance. Then says "The past tense, see." "How was that?" Atlas sounds like he's cracking up. "She even used to burp me; all I ever got to sustain me was crab-nebula meat, always too hot, always gritty. No, I didn't mean that. You know about my daughters, don't you?" Without waiting for my response he blurted it right out: "The Pleiades: the seven-set. Maia was one of them, see. For some reason they were all born on a mountainside, which made 'em sometimes walk the wee-est bit gimpy. See, I can't bring myself to say it. Well: they all killed themselves, all committed suicide. To a one. Alcyone, Celaeno, Electra, Taygete, Sterope, Aero (a special one that) and even my own Maia. For why? Because 349</page><page sequence="29">Paul West the plight of their Dad upset them so. That's all. They couldn't take it eon after eon of seeing him stuck there with his back stiff as a ramrod, forever on cosmic parade, head held high, the whole caboodle on his back. With no hope of remission, no sabbatical. I've heard other versions: it was the death of their sisters, the Hyades, that broke their hearts, or it was Orion's fault, forever propositioning them, until old fussy Zeus, he said 'Enough of this bull, I'll turn them all into stars, Orion as well.' I don't much go for those two particular explanations. But the long and the short of it is all seven of them are stars, and the only converse a tired old titan can have with them is in mid-May, when they signal the approach of harvest-time by rising —out there in Taurus, in the northern hemisphere — and then again, in October, when they set, and that's the time to sow. To some, I gather, they signal the open ing and closing of the sailing season, but who cares? What grieves me, among other things, is that one of them, Aero (sometimes Merope to the gossip columnists), isn't even visible. Got herself into a bad marriage with a slippery customer called Sisyphus, and then he got himself a life sentence rolling a block of stone uphill. No doubt you've heard of him: another of Zeus's punitive measures. Do you wonder she can't bear to show her face? Her Dad and hus band both, penal servitude for life. It's enough to make a statue weep. Up here, among all the jamming, I hear radio of all kinds, much of it highfalutin chatter about totalitarianism, so-called. Let me tell you, Thor, old buddy, they invented that condition for Atlas (and a few more, such as Sisyphus, whom I call Cissy-fuss). Nobody knows what being a prisoner's like until he's had a dose of being Atlas fifty or a hundred years, with not even a chance of your good conduct's being taken into account. And then your daughters kill themselves off, they can't stand it. How do you like them apples? Just about as far as you can get from golden ones. I'd give a hell of a lot for just one glimpse of Aero's face, those wide and liquid-gray, quicksilver eyes, the neat light brown widow's peak she had, the nose that wasn't snub and wasn't schnozz either. The rest of the world, if it thinks about them at all, reckons them seven (or six) doves; Pleiades sounds like the Greek for dove, see. But I don't much go for that, I remember them as they were: daughters of the Ocean-nymph Pleione, long gone. Sure I had favorites,· I know you shouldn't, if you believe all the bullshit the pediatricians hand you, but I did. That's that. I still do. But it's been mighty quiet up here since their conversion, so-called. Hey, 350</page><page sequence="30">Paul West you ever tried, between May and October, to pick out seven (or six) particular stars from the hundreds of 'em in Taurus? It's damn nearly impossible. I know the girls are there, but I'm never certain which is which, or even if I haven't looked at the wrong seven. Sure it hurts; another of Zeus's power-ploys. You'd do well to watch out yourself, parleying with the likes of me. He's not one to take things lying down. Anyhow, as I was saying, I stand here and try to cheer myself up with little reminiscences; Pleiades, I say, they're an open cluster of stars, and the luminescent spikes I see attached to them aren't even there, they're diffraction effects in the eye of the beholder, some cloudy spot on the cornea, otherwise known as nebula. That kind of constellation's like drinking nitric acid. As stars go, they're young, those Pleiades, whereas those Hyades..." The voice dwindled to a chaffering of airwaves, a sound of light flails, either black-body background radiation or merely Atlas groaning in the hoosegow of his mind. I tried to prompt him back to the Hyades, those other daughters, of whom he'd had nothing to say, only he held off, finally broke into some practiced-sounding patter about pleiotropisms and asterisms, about being not only behind the times but also ahead of them, under and above them: a bout of intergalactic self-pity, as he himself called it. Then, by gradual allusion, he returned to the business of the daughters, his voice creaky with loss, I could tell that, and his idiom oddly im personal, for reasons that seemed obvious. "Know what? I don't even recall the names of the Hyades, I'm not even sure if there were two, or five, or six. Everything about them's mighty vague. Half-sisters of the others. Nurses they were, that's one fact. Also in Taurus, but much older than Maia's bunch. Aethra was their mother. Named, all of them, after the Greek for rain. Rain stars, that's what they are, but the goddamned Romans got it wrong and, because the Greek word sounded like their word for pig, called them the little pigs. This little pig went to market, this little pig stayed home: well, it's not known what they did as little pigs. As nurses, they breastfed the infant Dionysus and as a reward were made into stars. Couldn't get my attention any other way, I guess. I suppose I now and then catch sight of them up there in Taurus when I'm looking for the other seven. Being older, the Hyades I mean, they've already achieved white dwarf status, pretty shrunken by now, some of them already black dwarfs I wouldn't doubt and maybe even invisible at that. You know how it goes: as they cool down, they radiate less and less, and then, when they're cold and 351</page><page sequence="31">Paul West dead, they have colossal density, millions of times that of water, say. They're actually smaller than planet Earth, but their mass is like that of the Sun. Takes billions of years to get 'em to that point, of course, but get there they have gotten. They're kind of just memories, I guess, maybe not even that. Whereas Maia and Aero, well. . ." Again silence found him and lost him, as it sometimes did Frank Etna, my almost-forgotten friend, on his return from yet another raid on the world's wonders: exuberantly recalling how it was to have gone lundyfishing in Iceland, catching birds on a cliff with a net, or playing aqualung cowboy with the tunny deep off Gibraltar, he'd suddenly seize up, look into the middle distance and wordlessly relive it, incredulous that the human who went away and did those things could now be here trying to tell it. And then he'd pick up again, like Atlas, invigorated by the time-out. When would he be back? I'd completely forgotten. Was he in New Zealand or Fiji? Only time would tell, via him. Atlas was heartier now, funk-free, and regaling me with talk of Mercury who sometimes doubled, stood in, for the evening star, always kept his face toward you, and wobbled a bit like Dr. John son. In recent times he'd developed some curious discolorations down one side, a kind of planet-impetigo, weepy and a-tingle. Maybe a new mode of growth, Atlas suggested: the effect of the sun's getting gradually hotter and bigger. Or maybe some para sitism, where panspermia had touched him. All that was certain was that one day, in say about eight billion years ("How'd you like that to be the unserved portion of your sentence?" Atlas asked with grim jocosity), the Sun would become a red giant, engulf both Mercury and Venus, and its surfce would approach the orbit of Earth. "Then it'll all be over," laughed Atlas. "You'll have fried long before that!" No doubt to hearten himself during these morbid sallies, he chanted a little tune, the words of which ran thus: "He-he, h-h, H Ca, Mg Ca, Feca." What it meant, I have no idea, and he refused to tell; but the last word sounded oddly like fecal, though I'm sure it wasn't that at all. The second sound was merely a double aspirate, which he carried over to the third, and the effect of hearing my own voice reiterate this from the cassette was weird and sinister. Hemgcfca, I fast-thought: maybe it's Lincos, the lan guage for interstellar communication invented by the Dutch math ematician Hans Freudenthal (sometimes my TV-viewing pays off in extraordinary ways). Asked, Atlas pooh-poohed the notion, wouldn't tell ("You'd never understand," he said), and, instead, 352</page><page sequence="32">Paul West swung off into what I can only describe as a virtuoso piece, airing not so much his knowledge as, mirrorwise, my own ignorance (TV or no!). "Take Τ Tauri stars, for example. Photographed in red light, they can be caught actually ionizing the gas in their vicinity, thus creating what shows up, believe it or not, as a silver lining. Beauti ful! As for panspermia, which we were discussing only a moment ago, if the Earth had been seeded some billions of years ago, the initial germ must've been ejaculated from a star not more than six thousand light years away. If that doesn't make you think, nothing will." Then he rambled off into something about "hydrogen spin flip" and being slapped in the face when very young for miscount ing the petals on a flower. Whence, no doubt, his hositility to education. Or to its process, at least. For long spells, he claimed, he'd had no fun at all, so he'd wept for joy in 1054, on the Fourth of July in fact, when a Class I supernova in Taurus exploded, astonishing the Japanese and the Chinese although apparently not the Europeans. A star which had previously been quiet and well behaved burned so bright that it was visible even in the daytime. "Debris now known," he said complacently, "as the Crab Nebula, expanding at six hundred and eighty miles per second!" Solar flares he'd kind of gotten accustomed to, of course, but 1898 hadn't been too bad, that being the year of Asteroid Eros, fifteen miles long and five wide, the first asteroid to pass inside Earth's orbit. Then, in 1957, Comet Mrkos had cheered him up no end, with its solar windsock tail. "It's like," he explained "seeing an occasional bit of baseball, huh? After the Greeks there were only the Romans, and after them there was no more mythology. Things kind of slowed down, like the universe one day will. Ha, I recall the scheme labeled Project Ozma, supposed to detect interstellar radio signals of intelligent origin, if any! Well, they laid the 27-meter Green Bank antenna on two stars, Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti, in 1960, Fall through Christmas, I believe, and got nothing at all. 'Eleven years ago, on those two stars,' each being about eleven light years distant, the project-director told the American Astronomical Society, 'it was pretty dull.' Well, Thor, my friend, it's been pretty dull here too since the beginning, since the Bang, El Grando Detonation! Yes sir, quiet to beat the band." "I thought you said earlier," I heard myself objecting, "you be lieved in the Steady State theory." "I believe in both," Atlas said, not without malice. "When I want to window-dress my own performance, I'm a Steady man; when I 353</page><page sequence="33">Paul West feel neurotic, I'm Bang. Simple, huh?" Quite irresponsibly, at that point I cried for help. "Atlas, that isn't being fair. Don't you think I've heard about the universe's being made up of billions of galaxies systematically receding from one another like raisins in an expanding pudding? Isn't that so?" Told to eat my own pudding and like it (the alternative being, he said, an endless journey into and out of a Klein Bottle, which has neither inside nor outside), I decided to try to shift him back to family matters; but he wouldn't touch them, said instead what I wrote down as: "Wons Wiki One." "Hey," I blurted. "You're going too fast. Give me time to get things down." "I thought you were just parroting them onto tape." I told him there were one or two things I wrote down, either to keep my hands busy or, more probably, because I concentrated better when doodling, etc. He spelled it out. "You got it wrong, Thor. Sometimes I can receive visual signals. It's 1 Zwicky 1, the brightest object known. OK?" I don't know about OK, but writing it down again, during the perfunctory lull of transcription, I know I've got it right this time. Or was he, as sometimes, joking, being titanically snide? Had he, or had he not, somewhere in all this, when he was unduly piqued with my slowness or my denseness, told me "Piss off"? And had I said "The same to you! No, please don't!" Something of the kind must have taken place (though it isn't in the tape), for I distinctly recall his saying, "If I do, it'll be into the world's largest radio dish, the Arecibo radiotélescope of Cornell University, in Puerto Rico, three hundred meters across. Some John that!" (Or have I imagined this, in white heat of vicarious fervor? As if driving at speed to wards another car on a night highway, cussing the other man's brights, when all the time it's a mirror some prankster has erected in the road. Do I in discovering Atlas uncover myself? It was little use asking him, I'd have only confused the issue further, as if say ing to myself: Does the act of asking yourself who you are make you a préciser being than you were before? Balderdash; time I got back to the old drawing board.) "I know," I resumed, "I know that Atlas is as Atlas does. And Thor copies. That's understood. But in airing your knowledge of such things as 1 Zwicky 1, aren't you just a bit overdoing it? I don't, do I, need to know everything?" "Nothing less than all will serve. That's what Zeus told me 354</page><page sequence="34">Paul West when they fingerprinted me, unchained me, and led me out to meet the world. At the first hold-up." Atlas being oblique, I guess. All I could do was counter with something else: an Atlas-flaw, it might be read as. "The Hesperides," I sprang it on him. "Those other daughters. Why so little about them, when you go on about even the Hyades, whom you confess you can't even remember by name?" "What you want, boy? Want me to name 'em? Aegle, Arethusa, Eryth —" "No: that's too mechanical. Just mention them, I mean." One of those Atlas lulls ensued, no doubt while he thunk it over. I heard the hiss of space, began imagining a solar corona that crackled and broke the non-silence. It was ocher-yellow, gibbous, gigant - "Daughters of Night," he rapped out, then went into a gabble. "According to later accounts, daughters of Atlas. Hm. Four all told. Erytheia and Hesperia the other two. They lived, live, on the River Oceanus, old H20's territory, close to the Gorgons. On the borders of eternal darkness. In the garden of the gods. Along with a hun dred-headed dragon called Ladon. 'S that enough?" Nowhere near, I told him; his very idiom spelled neglect. Told to micturate in the opposite direction to on, I simply pur sued my point: Why so skimpy about these four? "Frankly," he said with an ostentatious groan, "I associate them with Hercules and that whole golden-apple fiasco. To me, they're not girls, women, you-know-what, they're —I was going to say Golden Apples, but they're not even that. They're hesperidiums, hesperidia, meaning berries, with a thickened, leathery rind, and juicy pulp divided into segments, like an orange is, a lemon. They're right out of botany. Fruits, not daughters. And when they talk they emit not words but hesperidin, a white or colorless crystalline compound, dig? C2eH34Oi5. Life is sometimes like that. You can't get any more emotional than that about it. Fuck the notion of their standing guard over the gilded orchard. I went and got the apples for Hercules, rot him, and since that time the word apple's put my teeth on edge. I can't stand fruit, OK?" Plain as day, an Atlantean hang-up! Hercules fooled him about the apples, and he's never got over it. It makes sense to write off the Hesperides as fruit, which he can't abide. All the same, he goes on talking: "After that mess, I got Maia to fly in circles, dropping leaflets to plead my case — 'Atlas Was Robbed/ 'Demand Justice 355</page><page sequence="35">Paul West For Atlas,' 'Restore the Golden Apples To the Garden/ all kinds of propaganda. But no one took the slightest notice, just used the leaflets to wipe their backsides with. You see, Flercules rated as Errol Flynn, Clint Eastwood: you name the He-man, he was it. It was no more use blowing the whistle on him on denouncing Jesus Christ as a nail-freak. Greeks, you see, were in the habit of being prepossessed by anything splendid; and, what with the whole uni verse, and their own myths, to go at, they rarely lacked for splen diferous voluptuary goings-on. Of the dull mechanics, such as I, who held the whole goddamned thing up, they knew next to noth ing. Didn't give a shit. That's why I can't bear to think in Hes peridean any more. It hurts. That's where my whole life and career went wrong. I stepped back in where I should've walked away, leaving Here holding the baby." Gently I reminded him the obligation — his life-sentence, the chance of suicide — might be illusory. Step out from under, I told him. And see. Risk it. Stop the world and get off. Same answer as before: in his mind, he had, which is the only way to test some thing illusory. "Test an illusion with an illusion," I exclaimed. "That's how you get an illusory answer!" Believe me or not, I felt as if he were trying to cool me with liquid helium, a dire chill invading my marrow. So, as an equiva lent to whistling in the dark, I piped up (although rather hoarse and indistinct) as follows: "Don't bother, Atlas. I'm home free. They say you can dip your hands in hot lead if you've soaped them first!" Not so much as a squeak came from him. Under the eye of eternity (if not that, what?), he was all of a sudden on best behavior. Or maybe he had just departed, same way as he came. I should not have expressed impatience with him; clearly he had been through too much to think rationally about resignation or straightforward ly walking off the premises. I nervously switched off, just as ner vously switched on again, heard the thin, high-pitched emission of a galaxy in distress; falsetto yearning to be whole again. Atlas ? Sounding so frail, so pressured? None other. At that juncture, Thor began to regret many things, to devise ways of obliging Atlas all over again. Think hard, Thor. Were none such. Would play for him even that cluster of galaxies known in the trade as Stefan's Quintet. Shine upon him a light brighter than 1 Zwicky l's. 356</page><page sequence="36">Paul West Bribe him with Stardust home-bottled (mis en bouteilles dans nos caves). Be a much more modern man than I am, world-traveler that I used to be; spare him the fireball when it comes, though none else. Yield him my drysack cape, to save his back from spicules which, geyserlike columns fiTre hundred miles wide, shoot out at twenty miles per second from the lower chromosphere, ramming protons into the corona and thus creating the solar wind. How know? I do declare Atlas's masterminding my belated education. "That all?" he whispered. "A poor all." But mine own, I was going to say, yet said "Wait. There's more. I'll stamp out the apple." "Promising." I was promising, not just showing promise. Furthermore, I told him, I'd have him installed in Golden Gate Park (sorry, Silver Gate Park, they'd have to repaint the bridge a different color next time round), as The Man With the Portable Universe. Roll up, and see. Hidden behind the fortification strata of all the migraine sufferers in the world. He made an encouraged, encouraging, noise. "And," I said with a flourish, "you'd have your choice of which decade to live in. Whichever suited you best." What he came up with next, only Atlas would have—well, he pipe-dreamed in reverse. "Know what I'd really have liked, Thor, old partner? One weekend conversing with the Presidents, Past, of Mount Rushmore. Like on the old six-cent postcard of your nation. Atlas being the fifth head. Over six thousand feet above sea level, buddying up with those other monoliths, Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt. We'd converse on the universe, putting our sixty-foot heads together. You know how Washington looks away, in a kind of aloof autonomy, and Jefferson gazes over Washington's shoulder with his eyes right, and Lincoln seems to be looking past them both, down into the bedrock of South Dakota, and Roosevelt's scrunched in between the last two like a neckless weightlifter? Well, I'd fit into that quartet, I'd reckon. I'd look right at the beholder, like the eyes in some photographs, and folks could stare back at me and try to read my mind. My jaw'd jut and there'd be rattlers' nests in my nostrils, eagles in my ears, and a spring pouring out of my mouth. I'd be much bigger than the Giza Sphinx, but unlike Roosevelt I'd have been completed, just a-set ting there and exchanging a few solid, inert words with the boys. 357</page><page sequence="37">Paul West Ur; hurrumph, Line... "'Yeah, Atl. For sure.' "'Hi there, Big Boy.' "'Mamin', Jarge. Chaw baccy?' "'Try me.' Teddy. "'Fine day but dull so far,' says Jeff, the long-winded one. Then there's nothing more said for several hours." "You'd do better," I tell him, determined to awe him with know how, "to 'labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire — conscience.' That's what it said in Washington's copybook when he was a schoolboy. I suppose you could even ar range to have some movie or other located on your shoulder or your head. In Hitchcock's North By Northwest didn't Eva Marie Saint take dinner on Lee's shoulder? Or something like that." Heavy-voiced, he answers, "Up here in the provinces, we get movies about two thousand light years late. I wouldn't know, honest. Swelp me, if those boys didn't have it easy! Nothing to hold up, in fact the strata support them. All they have to do all day is be themselves, keep still and act normal. Just be looked at. Photographed. Just weigh. Why, even the Statue of Liberty, even though she's just gotten rid of the shackles at her feet, has to hold up a burning torch and a book of laws. I wonder what it feels like to be made of hammered copper, have all that verdigris on you, stand on a star-shaped wall, be a tourist attraction. "Ά mighty woman with a torch, whose flame Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command.. .' Boy, does she need to watch out, or at least her PR woman, Emma Lazarus! There's nothing imprisoned about lightning, take it from me. One solar prominence'd be the death of her. But the poem's great, kind of soothing and even-footed; I'd just, myself, want no truck with all those tired and poor and huddled masses, all the wretched refuse. Atlas, he wants well-integrated and well-heeled sponsors. After an eternity in limbo, you need something with a bit of class, none of this downtrodden rabble. Speaking as the Old Colossus, I don't think much of the New." Well, I'll be — he sounds like a Republican! "Up the polis!" he shouts. "A polis of one." For a moment there, I thought he was shouting for the police, whose I know not; and then I thought of calling for them myself. 358</page><page sequence="38">Paul West But a voice, even a voice you're echoing, can't get out of hand, it's your own mind goes awry, the voice simply follows suit. Kin voiced, Atlas and I are far from being kin-minded: I become a boy again, go fishing for minnows in the Pekin creek; he goes fishing for neutrinos in a trap filled with cleaning fluid and located in the Homestake Goldmine in the town of Lead, South Dakota. It figures: he thinks the mine is underneath the men of Mount Rushmore,· he wants his statue filled with tetrachloroethylene. Bah! But (you know how an idea takes root, trunks up, is soon a crowning forest fire!), even as he thundered, pummeled on, his voice gaining in authority from moment to moment, I mind-staged him in that grandiose company, as I think a loyal American might. I gave Atlas to them and I had them tell him —well, not so much the best thing to tell Atlas, but rather what conveniently came into mind, beginning with a repetition of Washington's Labor to keep alive, et cetera, but moving swiftly to other eminent volun taries, which I had Atlas answer. Jefferson, with eyes oh-so-distantly focused, his face suffused with boyish altruism, spelling out something Atlas might bear in mind: "A lively and lasting sense of filial duty is more effectually impressed on the mind of a son or daughter by reading King Lear, than by all the dry volumes of ethics, and divinity, that ever were written." To which Atlas, less amazed than bearishly contemptu ous, huffed: "Best he try a decade or two of humping the flaming firmament on his back. Fuck filial duty period." More cunning, therefore, I decided, to try him with Lincoln, with honest and unpretentious words out of a mouth so wide and generous-lipped, so essentially accustomed to uttering the good, that Atlas'd cave in at their very sound. Fond fancy that I had! "Nobody has ever expected me to be President. In my poor, lean, lank face nobody has ever seen that any cabbages were sprouting out." After a brief, stertorous silence, Atlas let us (Lincoln and me) have it straight between the eyes. "He'd have done better to lard his face from time to time with manure, then he'd have found at least a Brussel sprout or two." Two down, two to play. No, three, I was committing the unpardonable sin of forgetting George Washington. Theodore Roosevelt brought things full circle. "Death," he said weightily, "is always and under all circumstances a tragedy, for if it is not, then it means that life itself has become 359</page><page sequence="39">Paul West one." Neat paradox, that, I thought: for sure that'll bring him up short. Didn't, though; Atlas retorted offhandedly as possible: "An other lightweight sparring bout with one of the old dichotomies! We invented 'em! Up here, we no more talk of death than members of the Senate compete to clean out the city sewers with their bare hands. It don't apply, Thor, my lad. Next?" But there was no next: imagining myself imagine him to his face, even while he was tromboning on about Samson and the Olympic weightlifting championship, that was too much nervous agitation in vacuo. Imaginarily I let him go, only to have him slap right back at me with sneering remarks about the George Wash ington Bridge, Lincoln Center, Mount Jefferson and Roosevelt Raceway: his old war cry against the naming of things, pressed wine of his own bizarre fusion of sour grapes with invaded privacy. I really must get him, I vowed, to sort out his feeling on that; he hasn't fared that badly; after all, an ICBM is an ICBM, and not in truth a bowel motion only, and an Atlas Range is an Atlas Range, an atlas is an atlas. .. Truth was, of course, he was by this time no more obligated to be consistent or logical than to auction off his calluses for souvenirs. Instead he handed me (I'm being meta phorical, of course; he voice-handed) this: w- HliilND BII.I. ή Just fir rived: Ip ttje Ship Ligopier, Capt.

I wouldn't touch it with a mile-long beta-ray-contaminated radar antenna. I know what I'm talking about too; that was exactly how I was treated: pressed into service along with, so to speak, cheeses, cider, sailcloth, Bristol beer and window-glass. One of the amenities." Marveling I hadn't countered with this before, I asked him in a proverbial flash, "By the way, who held things up before you did?" "Zeus, between his teeth, like a circus act." That was no answer at all, but slapstick quasi-theological eva sion. I asked again. 360</page><page sequence="40">Paul West "Ur," said Atlas. "Things held themselves up. Things were self sustaining till then. Soon as they found a victim, somebody to fix but good, they cooked up a gravitational universe so's I'd have something lousy to do." No, I told myself, nobody knew, nobody knows; Atlas's only an alibi for Zeus, etc. Stands to sense, he didn't exist before because their cosmology hadn't gotten off the ground. So to speak. That's how it always begins. They fudge up the stories to flesh out the guesswork mechanics of it all. Atlas's no more than a figment, dreamed up in order to dream himself into non-stop penal servi tude. Why, he's being made to blackmail himself with a communal dream. Invented, he can invent himself out. I told him, got nowhere, invoking all the dualities I'd ever heard of, just to make him release his teeth from the old dichotomy of Zeus-Man: dilemma, mirror, carbon-copy, black-white, pro-con, Doppelgànger, double, twin, either-or, and had even embarked on the threes (triads, triptychs, syllogisms, Hell-Purgatory-Paradise, the famous crucifixion) when he let out the most appalling shriek I've heard on sea or land, in ether or out, and in a reflex motion I flipped off the machine, which of course didn't stop him at all, but only prevented me from mimicking him into the tape. It was a noise of slow, inventive disembowelment, seeming to echo wetly in the cavern of his body cavity, and then to erupt from his mouth (or his mind's mouth, anyway) in an ill-enunciated cry: "Close.. .double.. .star. Binary, all the way." "Never," I said, first switching the cassette back on. "The whole show is single. Has nothing to do with you at all." But he persisted, claiming some double stars had one partner invisible (Zeus, clearly) while the other shone for both. This I knew, but I protested his analogy. "All it boils down to, my friend, is: Atlas's redundant. If you'll pardon an analogy of my own — Man isn't essential to the universe, he's merely incidental, a daub, a sport consequent on some roll of the cosmic dice. Wipe him out and the galaxies won't even blink. The quasars'll go on receding at, what is it, three-fourths the speed of light, the white dwarfs'll go on cooling, the basic temperature of space'll not alter one jot. Three degrees Kelvin, or whatever, it's nothing — " A roar, then a wheedling, pleading noise, and all of a sudden I construed better than I had in that entire decade: I realized that Atlas was nothing more than a writ-large version of all the human 361</page><page sequence="41">Paul West bids for importance there had ever been. King-sized hubris was his game, on behalf of all of us. Loitering around in the back alleys of myth and rumor, he battens on to any willing gullible, lets him have the whole trumped-up mouthful, and the sucker goes away wondering, quite heedless of its being rotation that keeps things in place, even more heedless of its being gravity that holds things up! What he ought to remember is this: if you collect up all the stellar and interstellar matter you are certain exists in the universe and spread it evenly against a sphere of radius ten billion light years, then there isn't enough stuff to balance the centrifugal speed. Hence your open universe, incessantly self-inflating balloon which cannot burst. On the other hand (and no sounds of fidgeting from Atlas now, he's either passed out or switched on his own tape recorder!), you have, say, several tens more times of intergalactic stuff than's at present known about, then the universe is denser, and being denser exerts a gravitational self-attraction strong enough to resist the tug to the periphery. Hence your pulsating universe. Phew! Either way, unless he eats or makes the cosmic stuff, it's out of Atlas's hands. It might even be better to miniaturize him, site him under a table that he can't quite touch with his fingertips, and treat him as courts once treated their jesters and fools. Give us a cosmic fright, Atlas! A galactic shiver? To heel, boy. Good Atlas, lie down. (That sort of thing, for a beginning, my whole aim being to render the universe aright as what it is: elements, equations, a motley posse of uncoordinated explosions, hottings-up and cool ings-down; nothing with a personality, a temperament, a human face, but the abstraction of all abstractions made flesh only so as, some of it, to be visible. With my mind running thus boldly, ram ming itself upon the horns of the universe, refusing to be senti mental about anything, I minimally embarked on what I can only think of now as a course of disaster. It is one thing to refuse to de lude yourself; it is another to push that refusal to the point of an obstinate madness, rather like Tolstoy's Pierre in reverse, bending every effort not to avoid "that dreadful it" but going all out to locate it and apprentice oneself to it. It is to such mentalities that an Atlas speaks, and it is to an Atlas that an oddball such as fan Thor finally addresses himself (yourself excepted, of course). Look, I told myself: for once and always convince Atlas of his re dundancy, point out to him that the universe, being the only mem ber of an elite of one, never needed Prometheus, Faust, Frankenstein; 362</page><page sequence="42">Paul West they, and their like, constitute the human obbligato, no more than that, are merely graffiti, accompaniment, feints. Lunatic as it may seem, when I look back on it, I began to usurp Atlas's role; after all he had fallen silent, no doubt in a sulk or a titanic tantrum, and the field was open. All I had to do was assume his stance, his office, and then move out. The universe would stay put; Atlas would recognize his essential freedom, his expendableness; and I, Jan Thor, would have exercised in the most renewing way the eidetic privilege of homo sapiens. Ridiculous? Now yes, but not at the time. I have come a long way since that episode, but by no means as far as the universe has gone, expanding away from me at imper sonal and inexplicable speed. First of all, I made some phone calls to prepare the basement. I needed several tons of soft sand and a ton of cement, but I settled for a ton of the former, a couple of sacks of the latter. Thinking (as I thought) with sublime straightness, I had a couple of janitors mix up the mortar early one evening, they as you might imagine cast ing baffled looks as they worked. "This here basement floor looks A-l to me," said one. "Why'd you want a new one?" Taking care of the future, I told him, but clearly he did not regard that as an explanation. "Two feet deep?" queried the other. "You want it two feet deep? Why that deep?" And his partner echoed the question. I just urged them to work as fast as possible while I went up stairs to receive other parts of my equipment at the door. The timing seemed exemplary; by midnight I would be ready and the demonstration could begin. To abbreviate (as I suspect you'd like), I'll say only that several hours later, with all the extension cables in place and a little wooden platform rigged up for me to walk on above the wet concrete, I looked upon my arrangement and found it good. Barrels, hosepipe, tape recorder were all in place. It was time, or rather, since there was nothing more to be done, there was no reason for not going ahead. Imagine, then, the scene, as with twelve color televisions blaring out and flashing lovely as sorted pageantry in one massed bank before my eyes, I mounted the plank platform, flicked on the recorder, drew the drysack robe about me (by now it was thirty feet long), set the hose in my mouth, prized away with my tongue and swallowed the plug of chewing gum and allowed the sherry from the barrel to feed into my mouth. 363</page><page sequence="43">Paul West Swallowing at an even pace, I stepped off the plank and settled down in the cement, oh about eighteen inches, and then raised my arms to take the weight of the beam I'd chosen. I pushed up hard with both hands and the weight spoke back to me, crunching me down a little; but I took heart and pushed back again, soon had the feel of it, and began to enjoy my role. As one would having at long last found something to do that was neither trite nor sentimental. Of course, the accumulated sound of all those TV loudspeakers at full blast was close to the pain threshold (I forget exactly how many decibels), but that was part of the required excess and more than compensated for by the rainbow galaxy of the color screens. What a commotion there was of barks, mutters, squeals of brakes, orchestras, jet whines, gunfire, hard-sell baritone voices, talk-show anecdotes, detonating forest fires and (as time wore on) national anthem drum rolls and the electronic roar of empty airwaves. After an hour or so, it was mostly westerns, and there was much more black-and-white than there had been. By that time I'd con sumed a quart of sherry, of course, and was feeling singularly blithe. The tape had run its length, but the inauguration had been pre served for posterity. My feet were numb, the cement was rigidify ing faster than I'd any right to expect, felt like wet puttees around my ankles and calves, and the beam with the house atop it was distinctly heavier. But I bore up, thrusting woozily against the weight, grateful for my cape about me, not so much a cape, I mused, as an unkempt pavilion, a pavilion being —need I remind you? — an ornate tent, evocative of medieval chivalry, usually an open and ornamental shelter originally named after the old word for butterfly (from its resemblance to the wings). I don't mind telling you, I felt quite regal, as well as grandly useful. Perhaps I should have found some means of attaching my hands to the beam, against the time when my arms and shoulders went numb, but I didn't, and my posture froze. Perhaps, too, I should have reckoned on my limited capacity for alcohol (yes! even I!), and found some way of shutting off the supply, but I didn't, and I soon began to make my own water down my leg on to the caked cement. Already it held me fast. And, no doubt, I should have reckoned on the drear time when the late late movies end, and all one has to contem plate is an array of banal test patterns and buzzing gray lozenges of light, but I didn't, and the basement sounded like a demented hive. It was too late for all these sensible expedients, so I occupied my mind with the program I'd often enough rehearsed: landlocked, 364</page><page sequence="44">Paul West but free, I Atlas Two relived my own incarnation, first of all as models A, Β and C, all non-operational, but infinitely useful and lukewarmly exciting as rehearsals for such things as nose-cone separation. Ten feet wide, I was over eighty feet long, and my taper ing nose-cone held a six-foot-wide nuclear warhead. Liquid fuel powered me, liquid oxygen served as oxidizer. I thrust (thrusted, I told myself) with almost four hundred thousand pounds in order to lift two hundred and sixty, and I traveled at sixteen thousand miles per hour. My range was nine thousand miles. In my time, I was the launch vehicle for the Mercury maimed orbital missions; it was I popped chimpanzee Enos up into the blue, not to mention Glenn, Carpenter, Schirra and Cooper. I thrill at my own physique, voluptuously savoring the names of my most private parts: inter pod cableway, pod nose fairing, thrust chamber, umbilical connec tions, helium storage, aft nacelle, liquid oxygen boiloff valve, stub pod, No. 1 Vernier, liquid oxygen fill and drain. I'm Tamberlaine the Great mouthing the names of all the cities he's conquered! As Atlas-Agena, I've thrust satellites and orbiting observatories high above the Earth's atmosphere. Now and then I lengthen, although I don't swell, and as Atlas-Centaur I even achieved the first restart of a liquid hydrogen engine in space. 'Twas I took Surveyor to the moon. I even, when I'm feeling mighty ambitious, take on a dual back-to-back (zwei-backed) payload. I'm big, I'm hard, I'm hot, I'm fast, I'm long, I'm lethal, I'm not even earthbound... Such my meditation was, at least for as long as consciousness lasted. How I stayed erect for the whole of the night, I have no idea, but I came to, still erect, in a wan light from a few sunrise semesters on the screens, the hose somewhere over my shoulder, the reek of sherry everywhere, and an appalling pain in my shoul ders and back. Now I knew how it felt to be Atlas (the earthbound type anyway). My feet seemed locked in the cement as well as completely numb. Praise be, though, the house had not fallen, and I pushed against the beam with all my might, reasoning that it means nothing to step out from under when you haven't even been holding something up. How soon collapse, mine I mean, would come, I wasn't sure; it would be before noon, I could tell, and as I sank to the concrete in which I was rooted I'd be overcome with gratification. I'd have proved the point. Having been all the Atlases known to man, I'd have done duty for Atlas my random interlocutor, found the means of freeing him in perpetuity. Fond dream that it was, it was better than continually being denied my 365</page><page sequence="45">Paul West trip to Peking. So the aches and pains, the stench and the damp, mattered little to me; I was both a stoic and a scapegoat, both a monument and a hunk of myth, both a creature and a creator, both a man and a universe, both a servant and a master. I was the North and South Poles' only living cousin. I was a man-mountain clad in cloth of gold, with golden apples for eyes, golden fleece for hair, with a golden horn in my loins, a golden bough stuck be tween my teeth and a golden mean in the dead center of my con duct. In a word, I was golden to the hilt. It's not everyone who puts his non-stop consumption of dry sack to such chivalric uses, there by promoting himself not socially but from mundanity to my thology. Atlassed thus, I refused to faint; but refusal has nothing to do with that special form of the syncope, and I distinctly recall the onset, as my remaining senses swam (a butterfly motion, of course) and my arms, like melting cantilevers, came a degree at a time down and out and down and away. I'm safe, I said aloud, the beam will hold; it's common sense, if such a commodity still exists. But then I heard it, my heart in even its enfeebled condition began to pound, and then to twist and writhe in its box, its flutter excruciating. A faint rattle, as of soil upon a coffin lid, grew into a rumble, as of bowling balls being unloaded on a boat's deck while you cower below, and then it was utterest commotion, like a bombardment mixed into a landslide, and I made sure the beam and the floor and the entire structure were beginning to descend, ponderously slow but beyond my power to reverse. Thunder on the left, I dimly thought, means that the gods are furious. I have trespassed too far on their reservation. But the thunder was com ing from all angles, oddly pitted with falsetto wails. I braced myself for the fall of yet another house of Usher, with Humpty-Dumpty at the bottom of the heap and uncountable galaxies banging and fizzing on top of him, but all I felt was the same old air around me, damp and foul but hardly an unbearable pressure. Once again, I concluded, the universe had gone wrong; old cosmos had skipped a beat, and the anticlimax was like being allowed into Peking on your deathbed. Or deathlitter, as it would almost certainly be. In actual fact, the rattle that became a thunder that became a lull was, phase by phase, the arrival upon the basement stairs of Frank Etna and two of his children, their untidy descent toward me, and their amazed, evidently dumbstruck, witnessing of Jan Thor in his Atlas guise. How long it took them to recover their wits I never discovered, but surely it was the children who adjusted first and 366</page><page sequence="46">Paul West best, Frank Etna himself having speedily (for him) recognized, amid the panoply of my pose, the symptoms of something less exotic: a second coronary, as far from a crowning as an atlas from Atlas. In short, they got me out, installed me in intensive care in commendably short time, and I never heard from Atlas again. Needless to say, my whole world has collapsed, and it is no mere trope when I refer to myself as a collapser: a white dwarf who, burgeoning in the center of a red giant, is immensely dense, ever and-ever colder and less luminous, soon to become invisible. As an extinct black dwarf, I'll be in no position to report, whether the truth or anything else, so I furnish you now with the one and only account of these miserable aberrations I'll ever be able to muster. Much good may it do you, as well as those who come after you (in loyalty, heredity or vengeance). SALVE ME The cooling process goes on for many billions of years. The light from the star becomes feebler and feebler, and ultimately disap pears. The star had died, as in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram's lower left-hand corner, where nothing shows. Atlas and I were never coeval, but, thanks to you, and through your possible inter vention, dear friend, kuiie, we may yet be. At last. I dedicate all this stuff to Charles Kingsley, Marcus Aurelius, Whittier, Montaigne, Paul of Tarsus, Robert Browning, Pythagoras, Charming, Milton, Sophocles, Swedenborg, Thoreau, Francis of Assisi, Wordsworth, Voltaire, Garrison, Plutarch, Ruskin, Ariosto and all kindred spirits and souls of great measure from David down to Rupert Brooke. Add Aeschylus, Petrarch, Henry Cowell. END CONSTRUCTION. Bells, brays, drums, elbow thumps, trombones on fire. I have not written a book at all — I have merely cleared house. 3. Poor Jan Thor, the twice ambiguously named, creature of my own concoction offered up whatever gods are available! He didn't, it seems to me, have much of a life, and the fault's all mine. Surely it's not beyond the bounds of decency, so-called, to fit out your pawns with a bit of fun, a career or even a good dose of ecstasy. 367</page><page sequence="47">Paul West Even so, I won't go back, won't disrupt his confected finality; being done, being done with, he enables me to go forward, away from that enlarged image of a man ruinously in converse with himself, doing duty for such a rank outsider of a figment as Atlas. It was one way of coming to terms with something stationary, landlocked, and somberly dutiful in myself. I, Ives, Atlassed Jan Thor, and I had Jan Thor Jan-Thor Atlas in part of that untidy osmosis of being that goes on year in, year out; it's a simple process, really, the most honest fraudulence there is; goes like this, no? 1. First of all find the deep end. 2. Slide in, an inch per millisecond. 3. Tread water. 4. Say a prayer, any prayer, provided it begins: "It is well past time that we claimed this mad, transplanted earthling as ours." Then you're safe, have a shore to return to. 5. After which you can list with impunity what drew you to Atlas in the first place: his, your, infernal capacity for staying put for hours (or, as it seems to others, days and weeks); a certain stolidity, with the imagination shut off and the mind's very chan nel closed; perfectionism of vocation; an honor-mad self-reliance which maybe would carry you as far as winkling out your own appendix, mending teeth-cavities with the point of a nail file, even doing necessary amputations by electric daylight in the kitchen with breadknife, dental floss, and a bottle of —well, something stronger than Dry Sack! You wouldn't think, talking as we are of amputations, it'd take a semi-civilized writerly type about seventy pages to begin the process of coming clean; but it did, and here he is, I am, old but no-so-old Proteus doffing one mask after another, attempting yet again that bone-hard, invincible thing known as writing about what you truly care about, no shit, with not an alias in sight, not a mask at hand, nary a mouthpiece nor a persona. And all you end up with, after putting aside such childish things, is the old Niagara of the heart behind the shadow play, in whose water's course dreams don't come true, oh no, but lies falter at their own inception. Odd, in this world of vérité, when they want to meet you, they want to meet the guy that invented those other guys, little guessing that those other guys brought more of you into being than you ever thought there'd be. They reckon the real you's behind the puppets, hence the interviewer's wry interest in what you wanted them to express, whereas the real you's always ahead of the puppets (and their paper embodiments) and they're behind 368</page><page sequence="48">Paul West you in the sense of — ur, as Atlas'd slur it, phantoms that reinforce and, best of all, can't be taken away from you. When in doubt that you existed at all, you point to them as scales you shed in passing. Kilroy was here. And Ives as well. It's that complicated. Fabrication be praised, then. "Maybe now," hum the circus animals, their minds full of deser tion, "the cranky bastard'll let us off, spare us further involvement with his rancid psyche." They'd still do my bidding; in fact I might even, at this moment, still be doing theirs. After a while they talk back to you, give you a bad time, won't let you express yourself without first paroling them. Well, they've more than kept me in sandwiches. And some other folk as well, whose Atlas I was deemed to be. Under the circumstances (which is a fine victimized-sounding way to begin a sentence), the dilemma's easy to settle: instead of plumping for A or Β — coming clean or staying masked — you set the dilemma, install it as if it's a refrigerator (which gets hot while making cold) dead-center under those very same circumstances, and thank your stars you're double. You just keep on doing both things, eyeing the Niagara you own and, as well, snapping up the water-babies as they whizz by. But a better figure's this, the one that's been lurking in the backside of my mind since I first realized the universe was unique, was the class from which nothing could be exempted. Stefan's Quintet has a lovely sound, as if it were chamber music from Prague, or wherever, but it stands for a bigger harmony than that, is one of those galaxy clusters I gape at in glossy albums. Sky-atlases! A close grouping of solid-looking cores of light which have connecting bridges of gas, it's up there in the constellation Serpens, a close-knit family of five. And the gas's the diaphanous blur in between and around them. How like, I thought, Atlas himself added to the quartet of giants on Mount Rushmore, but how much more like Ives's mind on almost any given day, with half a dozen areas of intense, incoherent light linked up by vaporings? From that notion to appropriating S.'s Q. and domesti cating it in the stockade of autobiography, it was a simple, tangily hubristic step. Thus the conceit grows of a loose five, each of the component parts as unalike as chalk, cheese, radium, limestone and teak (ex cept that first and fourth may be similar as that fudged-up trope of the moment —chalk-limestone —suggests). Yet one things sure: 369</page><page sequence="49">Paul West the Quintet won't fight back even if I do it wrong; the universe's kind of big that way, as Jan Thor kept on telling Atlas. So forward I fare, with a satisfactory heraldic node lodged on the premises, something to hold to, or bite on, as this version of five lumps of thought in a gas cloud of intuition extends itself as far as may be; goes, indeed, past all calculation. As Herschel said, in The Con struction of the Heavens (1811), the gradual dissolution of the Milky Way proves (a) it can't last forever, and (b) its past duration can't be admitted to be infinite. The gradual dissolution of this text, this essentially woven thing, proves it won't last forever, came from a finite past. And that's a relief of sorts: I'm not in the position of the doomed Ur-arithmetician who, smarting under the impact of the concept googol, first mooted by an eight-year-old boy to denote 1 followed by a hundred zeros, addressed himself to 10 to the power googol, otherwise known as a googolplex, and began writing out all the zeros shorthanded therein without living long enough to complete the task. Heavens! A googolplex's nowhere near infinity, yet a googol's a bigger number than there are ele mentary particles in the known universe! One begins to begin to be grateful that, almost by definition, a book ends, says finito at some point to the infinite. And so to bed, or the mortuary stone, or the padded cell in which it's impossible to scrawl numbers on the walls. Is it infinity that scares, or the hypothesis that the mind, if it could live long enough, could actu ally apprehend everything? In other words, may it not be mortality instead of bigness that floors us? To ponder that, I eat a lunch of fried fish slices, fresh Vienna bread and blackberry jelly, things finite as one could wish, yet extending into everything if you take the trouble to hunt them down, the fish into the sea, the bread into the field, the jelly into the fruit, and so on. That way, life be comes a dead end of infinitely referrable series. Better to trough lunch and ask to go no further than Stefan's Quintet, not even bothering to name the component galaxies, not even letter them with incestuous coyness A and Τ and L and A* and S. Having got my chest off that, let me declare here and now (who's to stop it?) I'll find something better for Jan Thor than demonic possession by, of, an Atlas. Given my own lead, what's better than to respond to it? Cued, why be cowed? So shift him I do, it takes a word only. 370</page></plain_text>
