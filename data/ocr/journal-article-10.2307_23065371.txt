<plain_text><page sequence="1">16 Divine Agency and Tyche in Euripides' Ion: Ambiguity and Shifting Perspectives VASILIKI GIANNOPOULOU Questions of divine agency, free will and chance lie at the heart of the tragic vision of the world and of many Euripidean plays. In the anagnorisis and mechanema plays Euripides emphasises the power of the incalculable, the unpredictable, to affect human plans either by frustrating them or by effecting a sudden change from extreme danger to unhoped-for happiness. The prominent place of the exposed hero motif in his oeuvre reveals his keen interest in plots containing adventure, intrigue and recognition as well as sudden changes from the fear of death to unexpected salvation. In all these areas we may see links between the actually divine and the seemingly accidental. The aim of this paper is to analyse Euripides' ambiguous treatment of tyche in Ion, and to show how he creates a surprising and exciting play by employing patterns of chance and unpredictable fluctuations.1 Tyche has a wide spectrum of meanings, encompassing success, (unexpected) event, accident, good or bad fortune, chance and fate. The term's fluidity makes its translation problematic. The fundamental distinction is between a static sense, i.e. tyche as factum (seen as a state, a condition or an event), and a more dynamic sense, i.e. Tyche (with a capital T) as agens (seen as an indefinite, supernatural agent capable of effecting changes in human life). This distinction2 can help us decide which translation of tyche is better in a given case,3 although it does not represent an absolute and clear-cut dichotomy. Sometimes it is hard to distinguish tyche (as what happens to somebody or a state of being, happy or unhappy) from Tyche (as an indefinite power, external to human control and comprehension). One reason for this might be the Greek readiness to personalise and transfer to the supernatural level what was perceived to be 1 For the numerous manifestations of chance in Euripidean narrative strategy, see Goward 1^99. 2 Introduced by Buriks 1948: 124-29. 3 For example, at Ion 67 we have to do with tyche as factum, whereas at Ion 1514 I am inclined to take Tyche as agens. At Eur. Hec. 491 the sense of tyche is dynamic, while at 498 it is static. Cf. also TrGF 57/58 F 1 (Patrocles). See further below.</page><page sequence="2">258 Illinois Classical Studies 24-25 (1999-2000) the source of an evil or generally of changes in one's life.4 Hence, not only Tyche as a personification of fortune or chance but also gods or an unspecified daimon could be seen as responsible for both happy and unhappy changes in one's state. We have no clear evidence of Tyche raised above the level of poetic personification or corresponding to a cultic reality before the fourth century BC, and even then only Agathe Tyche (good fortune or good luck) was worshipped, a phenomenon exemplifying Wilamowitz's observation that "das Bose oder der Bose ist dem Hellenen kein Gott."5 Euripides could assume in the fifth-century Athenian audience a shared belief in the power of both the divine and tyche. Presumably, his contemporaries would have perceived tyche both as subsumed by the gods and divine intentions6 and as a more or less independent power of chance. Having said this, it is important to make clear what we mean by "chance." When Euripidean characters speak of Tyche with no obvious connection to the divine, they often aim at the rhetorical effect of stressing their dramatic plight, as they seem to personify their actual experience. To put this vividly, they seem to think: "How accidentally and unexpectedly this good or bad thing has befallen me. It looks as if neither my purposes nor a god's rule, but rather uncertainty and purposeless chance." This intensified reference to the characters' experience or pathos is the most important effect of personifying Tyche, which makes it impossible to translate tuxti with any Single English word. "Pure" chance is better suited to philosophical constructions, and is the product of later, originally Aristotelian, distinctions. In the plurality of human experience expressed in tragedy, by contrast, overarching divine plans, orders or oracles coexist with (or in the case of Ion are partly interrupted by) human plans and apparently accidental occurrences. A relation between this emphasis on a Tyche dissociated from gods and the climate of scepticism about the divine in Athens after the plague of 430 BC is likely7 but not verifiable. The evidence for fifth-century uses of tyche shows a variety of attitudes and beliefs from which this or that view could be selected according to the context and the purposes of the person involved. In the second Tetralogy of Antiphon, for example, although the possibility of accidental death caused by tyche is recognised, the plaintiff argues that the accused is nevertheless to blame, and claims further that an accident may be the instrument of divine punishment,8 while in another 4 See Mikalson 1991: 12-19 and 22-29; Nilsson 1955: 774-79; Dover 1974: 138-44. 5 See Wilamowitz 1931: 27. 6 Belief in the gods' participation in every important action and outcome seems to have been part of both popular and philosophical thought. This is well expressed by Broadie at the beginning of her article (1999: 205): "Ancient Greek philosophy arose in a culture whose world had always teemed with divinities. 'Everything is full of gods' said Thales .. 7 On this, see Ewans 1996:440-41 and 445-46; also W. D.

In Homer neither the common noun nor personified tyche occurs. Yet the first seeds of the later senses and nuances of the noun exist in the different uses of the verb ruyxaveiv. The meaning "hitting the mark" or "striking somebody" is frequent in the Iliad.10 A person aims and hits the mark; the implication of human action, skill and success are clear. Hence, the sense of "meeting with success," "getting something good," arises (only at 11. 684, from which one gets the impression that luck also plays a role). However, human skill and success recede into the background at 5. 587, where we find a single occurrence of a purely accidental tu%evv.11 When one meets with something unfavourable, the meaning "befalling somebody" is appropriate (5. 653). If the emphasis falls on an actual moment, ruyxaveiv with participle is used; this construction resembles the English present continuous ("to be actually" or "to be in the course of doing something").12 In general, the overwhelming presence of gods, and especially of Zeus as the dispenser of both good and evil, and the patterns of foretelling and warning in Homer leave little room for the accidental. In the first occurrences of the noun, Tyche is personified and classified as an Oceanid (Hes. Theog. 360 and h.Cer. 420). The implication here is that Tyche denotes "good, bountiful fortune or success" (cf. also h.Hom. 11. 5). In Pindar a man's good luck, success or victory is seen as tycha coming from a daimon or a god (e.g. 01. 13. 115, 8. 67; Pyth. 8. 53; Nem. 6. 24) just as in the Iliad the cause of a man's failure to hit the mark is Zeus' will (17. 632). Nevertheless, at Isth. 4. 31-33 Pindar speaks of the uncertainty of the outcome of a contest as dcpdveia xuxaq, "which gives some of this and some of that"; it is also made responsible for the failure of the Cleonymids to win the chariot race (Pindar adds that techne can give the victory to a worse rather than a better man). Wilamowitz has observed how nicely tyche is first presented here as an abstraction and then as a person.13 Here xv%a is 9 Antiphon 6. 15: ov&gt; 8fixa eytoye, kXt]v ye Tfjq ty&gt;xtk, fytfip olpai Kai aWoiq noAAoTi; av0pcj7tcov aixia eaxiv aitoSavew. Gagarin 1997: 231 contrasts this passage with the second Tetralogy (3. 3. 8) and suggests that "attitudes towards tux1! had changed if a decade or two separates this case from the Tetralogies"; this would be fast-paced Geistesgeschichte indeed! 10 See e.g. 5. 98,279, 579; 12. 189; 13. 371; 23. 726. 11II. 5. 585-58: autap o y' doGpaivtov EUEpysoi; ektieoe Suppo-u / icup[}axo&lt;; ev Koviflmv E7ti Ppexfiov it Kal topoix;. / 8t|9oc paV eott|kei—tv&gt;xe yap p' apaBoio Pa0Eir|i;— / ocpp' iTtTico nXfi^avxE xapal paXov ev kovitioi. 12 Od. 14. 334; //. 11.116; cf. 11.75.

The special problem of glorifying men who competed in</page><page sequence="4">260 Illinois Classical Studies 24-25 (1999-2000) felt to be an independent power, as there is no obvious connection with gods. In 01. 12, however, Pindar pays homage to ocoxeipa Ttj/cc, daughter of Zeus Eleutherius, but in connection with Ergoteles' career as an exemplification of adversity proving to be a blessing.14 In fragment 41 (= Paus. 7. 26. 8) Tyche is one of the Moirai and even more powerful than her sisters. Further examples classifying the power of tyche with relation to the power of gods or to other Schicksalsmachte and abstractions can be found in lyric poetry.15 Along with the gods and moira, tyche can be held responsible for changes in human life; in this respect, they interchange, associate or dissociate freely according to the will of the author. There is no contradiction or incompatibility in expressing simultaneous belief in all these powers. Tyche as "Chance" is sometimes neither a divinity nor dependent on the gods, but without atheism being implied. The scanty and fragmentary evidence we have from the Presocratics shows that in their cosmogonies ti&gt;xt| signifies cosmic chance, a kind of non-teleological causality, which together with necessity plays a role in the creation of the universe.16 Herodotus recognises the role of chance in human life, whether he connects it with the divine or not.17 In Thucydides the games but did not win here seems to have dictated leaving the source of the Cleonymids' ill-luck open and indefinite. 14 This does not contradict Pindar's frequent link of success with divine favour.

In fifth-century literature tyche is almost never placed above the gods,20 but the sort of language used of gods or an unspecified daimon is applied to tyche as well.21 What is more, the image of the wheel of fortune and the mutability of human fate are connected. Probably the 0eoq on whose wheel Menelaus' destiny is always revolving and changing its nature is Tyche: aM.' ou|i6q del 7tot(j.o&lt;; ev 7ttncv£&gt; 0eov) / Tpoxqj kukXeuou mi |i£Ta/*J\.daaei qruaiv.22 Ion's invocation to (lexaPaXotiaa T6%ti at Ion 1512 ff. is generated by similar considerations and constitutes a fleeting personification of the apparently random, changeable and not divinely controlled course of events.23 In Ion Euripides dramatises an extraordinary and complex set of relationships between god and mortals. Apollo is the father of Ion, born to Creusa after the god has raped her. Later, Xuthus, Creusa's husband— presented as a kind of gullible dupe—is to regard Ion as his own son,24 but not by Creusa, and so is doubly mistaken about his relationship to him. He is not the only one being deceived. Creusa, ignorant of Apollo's providential plan, believes that her exposed child is dead. Similarly Ion, already an adolescent as the play starts, performing religious duties at Apollo's shrine in Delphi, is ignorant of his true identity and of what the god has in store for him; for a time he believes that Xuthus really is his father; then he discovers that this is not true, but that Creusa is his mother. Deception, ignorance and a myopic, limited perspective condition the characters' views and emotions throughout the play, until at the very end Athena reveals Apollo's far-reaching (though, as we shall see, not omniscient) perspective. 18 See 1. 78, 140; 2. 64. 2; cf. 1. 23; 3. 82; 4. 18. 3-5, 55, 62. 4; 5. 75; 7. 60. 5, 62, 78; 8. 24. 5. 19 See Bond 1963: 48 and Austin 1968: 86; cf. Trag. fr. adesp. 169 N; Eur. Cyc. 606, Hec. 488-93, fr. 901 N; contrast Trag. fr. adesp. 482 N. 20 For this reason, Kannicht and Snell conclude that Trag. fr. adesp. 506 does not belong to a pre-fourth-century play; this seems too absolute, given the fragmentary nature of our evidence and the sort of remarks about tyche in fifth-century plays collected in the previous note. 21 Wilamowitz 1931: 364 n.l: "Es leuchtet ein, daB in manchen Fallen xt&gt;xr| filr 8a{|iiov stehen kOnnte.

It is derailed apparently by chance,25 as human nature with its unforeseeable responses gives the course of events a movement of its own. For Euripides, then, even divine plans can be affected by to%t|, which has important implications for our perception of the power and range of chance in the world of his plays. In Ion prologue and epilogue give a single, divine scope; between those points, the action seems humanly motivated.26 It is natural therefore that what is described from Hermes' and Athena's privileged perspective as part of Apollo's plan will be seen from the characters' limited perspective as random, inscrutable and even morally ambiguous. It is Hermes who first refers to tyche (67), saying that Apollo is directing tyche, which seems to imply that from the present perspectives of Ion, Creusa and Xuthus the outcome Apollo has in mind is not foreseeable. Hermes' divine perspective here presents Apollo as shaping the events of the mortals' lives. It seems appropriate that Hermes should speak the prologue in a play rich in unexpected, seemingly chance events and tricks of fortune. Taking into account his functions as transporter of divine children to safe environments and as god of luck,27 we could see the powers of unexpected fortune and of divine providence that operate in the play as incorporated in him.28 Yet in Ion Euripides also seems determined to present divine weaknesses and lack of omniscience; Hermes, in all-too-mortal fashion, 25 For the description of Ion, Helen and Iphigenia in Tauris as tyche-plays, see Ztircher 1947: 181 and Kerscher 1969: 134-39 and 271; cf. also Lesky 1983: 324 ff. On Tyche, see LIMC VIII. 1. 115-25 and 2. 85-88. For general studies referring to tyche in Euripides, see Busch 1937: 45-54, reviewed by W. C. Greene, AJP 59 (1938) 364-67. On tyche, see also Herter 1975; Greene 1944; Jaeger 1945: 124 ff. and 255 ff.; Berry 1940; Spira 1960: 132 ff.; Leimbach 1971: 113-17 and 128-30; Whitman 1974: 109; and Dunn 1996: 133-57. For a philosophical point of view, see Nussbaum 1986 and B. Williams 1993: 148-51 and 163-65. For a cultural perspective on chance, see Hammer 1998. 26 What is the purpose of this demarcation? We encounter a similar technique in Hippolytus, where Aphrodite's words at 42 are misleading, though in that play they come true in the end. Misdirection is also a characteristic of the divine prologue in Bacchae (50-52). The possibility of a pitched battle mentioned there does not in fact eventuate, "though it is envisaged at 780 ff. It is perhaps mentioned to titillate the audience with the possibility of an unusual development . . ." (Kirk 1979: 30). In these Euripidean prologues gods give predictions that are misleading without exactly being false, "perhaps in order to preserve an element of surprise" (Seaford 1996a: 153). Yet the case of Ion is different from the other two. Athena in the end (1563-68) refers explicitly to the modification of the divine plan, and we therefore have sufficient reason to believe that in Ion Euripides aims at something more than an element of surprise. 27 Thus eppmov is an unexpected piece of luck coming from Hermes, a gift from Hermes; cf. the proverbial Koivoq 'Epufji; meaning "shares in your luck!" Consider also Hermes Tychon; see Usener 1895: 218 and 220. 28 The next step from Euripides' use of Hermes to deliver the prologue in a drama full of reversals and recognitions, both real and ironic, is Menander's use of the goddess Tyche in Aspis, where she appears after the prologue. Her divine status here corresponds to the importance to Menander's audience of the relationship between Tyche and the human world. See Webster 1960: 198-201 and Vogt-Spira 1992.</page><page sequence="7">Vasiliki Giannopoulou 263 hides in the laurel grove in order to learn fully how Ion's fortunes are to be accomplished.29 Moreover, events do not turn out precisely as Hermes predicts. Apollo, apparently inattentive to human feelings, does not see the need to anticipate the human reactions to his plan. Creusa's violent response to Apollo's giving a son to Xuthus but not to her sets in motion the intrigue against Ion, which eventually leads to the true recognition of mother and son. Furthermore, Athena's concluding intervention confirms that the father is Apollo, though he intended his paternity to remain secret until after Ion's arrival at Athens. This modification of the divine plan30 is exceptional for extant Greek tragedy, and it seems reasonable to suppose that this novel twist had a special purpose. Perhaps, by presenting emotional responses which create confused and chaotic situations and partly upset Apollo's scheme, Euripides is depicting the power of the unexpected and accidental to alter even divine plans.31 It follows therefore that the agency of tyche can operate on gods in the same way as on human beings. Normally gods are subject only to the agency of things that have a clear and palpable connection with natural conditions; Zeus in Iliad 14, for example, is overcome by Hypnos,32 and Aphrodite in the Hymn to Aphrodite (45) is subject to himeros. On the other hand, even though the divine scheme does not develop exactly as planned, the divine is given a prominent role, especially in the interruption of Creusa's attempt at poisoning Ion and in the entrances of the Pythia and Athena. Due to this double perspective of the unexpected and the accidental on the one hand and divine providence on the other,33 the characters sometimes stress tyche and at other times give priority to divine agency. Of course, Athena in the end, like Hermes at the beginning, treats all the important dramatic events as coming to fulfilment through Apollo's providential plan, but we should neither overemphasise the deus ex machina nor underemphasise the apparently accidental events in the course of the play.34 We should not take the half for the whole. If we are to weigh the 29 This might be a hint that, although there is a fixed divine plan giving a direction to the events, the way things actually come to happen is uncertain and pregnant with alternative possibilities. 30 Easterling 1993: 85 comments: "Perhaps Athena's hasty arrival (on the mechane?) is the next best thing to revelation at Athens." Lesky 1956: 188, commenting on Ion 1563 ff., says: "Also auch die GQtter mUssen mit der Tyche rechnen. Es ist deutlich, wie die alte Vorstellung von einem Schicksal, das iiber personlichen GOtterwillen steht, in diesen andersgearteten Bereich hineinwirkt." 31 See Lesky 1978: 186-87. The original text reads: "Apollon ist wie die Menschen selbst bei aller Fursorge einer Macht ausgesetzt, die sein Konzept arg gefahrdet." 32 Here deity and abstract concept or natural phenomenon (i.e. iSnvoi;) seem to coexist and interact. 33 Euripides seems to suggest that things are differently appreciated from different points of view. As Ion says at 585-86, "it is clear that things have a different appearance when seen close up and when seen at a distance." 34 Ludwig 1961: 54 says: "Die hier zugrundeliegende Auffassung ist, daB die Gottheit durch ihr Wirken dem Geschehen eine bestimmte Richtung gibt, gewisse Moglichkeiten Offnet. Das menschliche Handeln kann ihnen entsprechen, kann sie aber auch, da es den gottlichen Plan</page><page sequence="8">264 Illinois Classical Studies 24-25 (1999-2000) god's grand scheme against Creusa's traumatic experience, we should also weigh the same divine plan against the earlier, seemingly accidental, events. In Thucydides we can distinguish between the author's use of tyche and its use by speakers, but this is impossible in tragedy, a narratorless genre where the author's "I" does not appear. Since we cannot identify where Euripides uses the word tyche in his own voice, we have to approach the plays in a holistic way. An example of the different expressions the characters use to describe what they experience is the way Ion and Xuthus speak of their meeting in the false recognition scene. Verses 539 and 661 present their encounter after the oracle given to Xuthus as a tyche, a turn of events or a turn of chance. At 554 Xuthus claims that fate has discovered the truth, while at 569-70 it is a god who has rightly accomplished his finding of Ion: Geoq / opGwq eKpave. The first response to a sudden, seemingly unexpected event may be to ascribe it to the power of chance, to destiny, or to a god— according to the point of view of the character in each case. Xuthus refers to the divine in order to show Ion that their meeting has divine approval, perhaps because he is about to ask Ion to leave Apollo's shrine and come with him to Athens. Their encounter is presented as a curious combination of divine predestination and chance. The poet appears to make full use of the ambiguity of the oracle and the seeming fortuitousness of their meeting in order to introduce Creusa's intrigue together with its unpredictable consequences. Besides, the responses of the characters to the false recognition the oracle has thrust upon them are different and reveal their personal characteristics. Xuthus' brash acceptance of his apparent good fortune matches the simplicity of his character and contrasts with Ion's scepticism and Creusa's sensitiveness. It is important that these references to tyche are accompanied by striking stage action. At the beginning of the second episode (510 ff.) the entries of Ion and Xuthus almost coincide; as the first enters from the parodos, the second is about to come out of the skene.35 Wilamowitz has observed the coincidental character ("die Zufalligkeit") of this scene;36 their almost simultaneous entrances may suggest the accidental nature as well as the surprising and wondrous character of their first meeting. The audience, of course, knows that Apollo intends to give Ion, his own son, to Xuthus. nicht erkennt und falschen Zielen zutreibt, durchkreuzen. Bei der Gottheit steht es, ob sie durch erneute Eingriffe das Geschehen wieder in die richtige Richtung lenkt. Solche Eingriffe wirken liberraschend, oft wie ein Zufall; es sind die Momente, in denen es sich entscheidet, ob das Geschehen in dieser oder jener Richtung weitergeht, wobei gleichgtlltig ist, welcher Mittel der Gott sich dabei bedient." This is a fair description of the interaction of divine purpose, human will and tyche in Ion, but it is important to stress that only post evenlum are the critical crossroads of the action connected with the divine. In the actual narrating (i.e. Ion's rescue) or staging (i.e. the Pythia intervening and preventing Ion from killing Creusa) of these critical moments the impression is created that things happen suddenly and by chance. 35 On the other hand, such a staging is outlined by the oracle (531-36). Furthermore, the childless Xuthus inevitably consults Delphi as, for example, Laius and Aegeus do. 36 Wilamowitz 1926: 110.</page><page sequence="9">Vasiliki Giannopoulou 265 Yet the scene in question shows how a divine purpose can appear fortuitous and coincidental at the moment of its realisation. The first-met theme occurs frequently in oracular responses.37 Euripides here seems to exploit a familiar oracular pattern and to develop it in the direction of mere or, paradoxically, premeditated chance. The tension between the apparently fortuitous and the actually providential is characteristic of the play, with all the references to to^ti under the influence of this polarity. After the false recognition scene, what separates Xuthus from Creusa is that he has found a son. Creusa understands the oracle as implying that she is never going to have a child. What most rankles in her heart is that she no longer shares a common fortune with Xuthus as far as childlessness is concerned.38 These ironic references may hint at the idea that purposeful divine action is perceived by mortals as random, ill-fated experience:39 naturally enough, since human knowledge and perception are trying to come to terms with the unfathomable divine and the fickle behaviour of gods. There is no reference to tyche in the servant's account of Creusa's murderous plan and its frustration. He says that Apollo exposed the murderer because he did not want to be polluted (1117). Yet the servant does not know the full story. At the actual moment of Ion's rescue there is no explicit intervention by Apollo, but the god seems to exploit Ion's own piety and virtue (1182 ff.).40 The actual scene of Ion's rescue may be seen as miraculous; in fact, prevention of a poisoning in extremis by just fortune is a widespread mythical motif41 often used by Euripides 42 It is impossible to discern what in the rescue of Ion is miraculous, what is accidental43 and what is Ion's just deserts. In effect, Euripides here seems to exploit the ambiguities caused by the overlapping of the divine miracle and the fortuitous. In the highly emotional scene of recognition between Creusa and Ion both characters refer to tyche. Actually, in all the anagnorisis and mechanema plays the recognition is consistently expressed in terms of 37 See for example Hdt. 6. 34; also the oracle given to Cadmus in Ov. Met. 3. 10 ff. and to Cephalus, on which see Fontenrose 1978: 386. Ion foresees at 608 ff. that this might be the case (cf. Lee 1997: ad loc.). This is also one reason why Xuthus decides to keep secret from Creusa that Ion was given to him as his son (657-58). The Chorus (704, 1101) and the Old Man (818) refer to this in connection with Xuthus' ingratitude. Finally, Creusa in her monody touchingly emphasises her anguish and pain caused by both human and divine violence (876-80). 39 Cf. 359 and 368. 40 Ion's connection to Apollo is emphasised by the servant at 1141-66, 1209, 1218 and 1224. It is notable that, though we know it and Creusa knows it, still Euripides tells us. 41 See Huys 1995: 55. 42 Earlier, in his Aegeus and Cresphontes, a lucky escape from violent death is also followed by recognition. 43 On this, see Owen's comment on 1514 (1939: 174). It was the rationalist critics— especially at the end of the last century—who could not accept the role of both the divine and supernatural chance in the play. See Owen 1939: xxxii-xxxvi and Michelini 1987: 11-19.</page><page sequence="10">266 Illinois Classical Studies 24-25 (1999-2000) tyche.44 The familiar tyche-techne antithesis45 seems to have been transformed by Euripides into a complementary relation: Here, tyche is the good luck of anagnorisis and techne the intrigue, which requires practical resourcefulness and cleverness, and aims at securing this good luck. Significantly, the elation inspired by the good luck of anagnorisis is followed by a successful mechanema (in Iphigenia in Tauris and Helen) or is preceded by a foiled mechanema (in Ion). In this moment of exultation, the crimes Creusa and Ion almost committed in their former blindness appear to them even more horrible. In this light they tend to emphasise the turn of events, and to attribute the interruption of their attempts upon one another to sheer chance (1502, 1514).46 Placing the intrigue before the recognition enables Euripides to show in a memorable way that tyche is not only what the characters experience as good fortune at the moment of recognition but also chance, which the characters see as effecting extreme reversals in their lives. So at 1512 ff. Ion goes so far as to address a powerful and apparently independent Chance, whom he deems responsible for having brought him to the critical point of being killed by and killing his mother, then for having saved him from both. This is a naturalistic and rhetorical description of the situation mother and son are in at this moment: naturalistic because Ion talks of Tyche as a purposeless, non-teleological agent that is not directed by some divine will; rhetorical because the personification of Tyche throws into relief what the characters have suffered so far. At 1374-75 Ion seems to hold Apollo and an unspecified 5ai|icov responsible for the good and the bad things in his life respectively. What for a god is xptiatov is experienced by mortals as papti, as xa xot 8a(jiovoq (explained by the following yap-clause) denote both baby Ion's and Creusa's hard lot. Furthermore, at 1388 he expresses his belief in what is destined to happen (toc rcejipconeva). Thus Tyche, this indefinite power that contains the element of sudden reversal47 here seems to indicate what Ion experiences at this particular moment. When presenting his characters' hindsight Euripides seems to emphasise the changeability of fortune and of human life in general. Compare the Sophoclean Electra's reflection on the curious way in which opposite experiences—utter ruin and the greatest joy, yet also love 44 Euripides, apparently following Sophocles' use of the optative expressing wish (e.g. El. 1226), makes his characters use tyche when they wish that their good luck of anagnorisis should last. See Ion 1456, IT 841 and Hel. 698. In this light, Cropp's proposal (1997: 34-35) for the substitution of xvxa for yoxa at Eur. IT 838 fits well with the emphasis on tyche after the recognition as well as the theme of the characters' "dependence on unpredictable strokes of fortune (n&gt;xai)." 45 See Agathon frr. 6 and 8 N; also Eur. Ale. 786 and IT 89. 46 Burnett 1970: 152 points out that "only in the recognition scene do the characters seem to forget the working connection between divinity and 'chance'." 47 Compare Soph. Ant. 1158. See EUendt's comment on this: "Haec sententia proxime abest a deae Fortunae mentione" (1965: 748). Diller 1971: 385 talks of "das blinde Ungefdhr" which brings ill-luck to Iphigeneia in IA 1402 ff., but raises Ion and Creusa to the heights of good fortune and happiness at 1512 ff.</page><page sequence="11">Vasiliki Giannopoulou 267 and hatred—have been mingled for her in the day's events (1357 ff.). Euripides seems to go one step further when he makes Ion ascribe the extreme change of his life to nexapaXotoa Tv%t|. Ion's invocation of Tyche is a rather transient expression of his belief in the power of Chance. Rather than a "weak personification" I would call this an Augenblickspersonifikation48 (momentary, fleeting personification). Tyche is meant to be taken as a supernatural, indefinite power. This can be shown by the parallel uses of tyche and daimon-,49 their common elements become apparent in descriptions of the misfortunes of the past and abrupt changes of fortune.50 Ion's apostrophe to Tyche can be seen as a response to the widest range of possibility and to the abruptness of change from one extreme to the other. Calling Tyche what Athena will in the end ascribe to Apollo's plan is not just a substitution of another rational force, but the rejection of rational explanation in favour of asserting the irrational, the paradoxical.51 Is tyche to be taken here as a factum (event/state) or as an agens (agent)? I think this is left deliberately unclear (hence the debate whether tyche should be capitalised). Euripides, intent on creating an exciting and suspenseful play, counts heavily on the imprecisely defined interaction of divine agency, free will and chance. At 1512—15 the change of subject from "Tyche" to "we" makes it ambiguous who is after all the real agent (but it appears that the point of the change of subject is indeed the imprecisely defined interaction). Tyche is the subject of the active participle HeraPatamaa, the agent of an action, "changing the life of thousands of men from misfortune to happiness." A demonic power could be held responsible for changes of fortune or for any unexpected, unwelcome event.52 It is in fact an important feature of Greek thought that what is felt to be numinous can readily be personified or deified;53 Euripides is 48 Borrowing Usener's (1895: 279-301) Augenblicksgbtter. Webster 1954: 13 ff. distinguishes among "deification," "strong personification," "weak personification" and "technical terms." However, determining the degree of vividness of a given personification in a particular context remains uncertain and to a great extent subjective. 49 See note 19 above; also Eur. Her. 884 and fr. 1073 N; Trag. fr. adesp. 353 N and Eur. fr. 974 N. Gods deal with important matters and condescend to leave to other daimones or tyche smaller, less significant issues. Compare Schlesier 1983: 277. 50 See Ion 359, 1374-79, 1456-57 and 1501 ff. Note how the reference to personal responsibility at 1497 shifts to the indefinite tuxcu (1501) and nveunaxa (1506). This seems to suggest that there is something superhuman in the constant change of human fortune and so to prefigure the personification of Tyche at 1514. See Erbse 1986: 10 ff., who argues that the personal aspect of an abstract concept often becomes palpable only in specific contexts, where, for example, the events described suggest that something is being perceived as superhuman. On the personification of Tyche, see Shapiro 1993: 227-28 and 1986: 10-14 and Hamdorf 1964: 37-39,97-100. 51 As Stahl 1977: 161 aptly puts it, "'Plumb-line' and 'chance' in a single statement: clearly, the concrete experience of life can only be expressed by a paradox." 52 See Eur. fr. 1073 N and Soph. El. 1269, where a reunion beyond thought and hope (1262 63) is seen by Orestes as a result of divine impulsion (1264) and by Electra as the action of a daimonion. 53 Hes. Op. 763, Aesch. Cho. 60.</page><page sequence="12">268 Illinois Classical Studies 24-25 (1999-2000) prominent among the tragedians for this form of expression, which is often combined with an apostrophe.54 Presenting Tyche as an agent seems to suit his interest in creating doubt and uncertainty about the outcome of an event; certainly Ion here expresses surprise and his enduring uncertainty about his paternity (1516 ff.). Burnett's characterisation of Ion's apostrophe to Fortune as "a momentary expression of error and faithlessness" seems off the mark.55 Ion is unaware of Apollo's plan, and no explicit divine intervention has yet taken place. Ion is not mistaken about the power of Chance, as Jocasta is in Oedipus Tyrannus when she says (977 ff.) that xa xtixtiq Kpaxei and there is no reliable foreknowledge. Jocasta's speech has an immediate disastrous consequence, whereas Ion's apparent belief in nexaPaXouoa Tt&gt;XTl is in a way vindicated by the modification of Apollo's plan. Trying to make sense of what has happened to him, Ion turns to rationalising and views what Creusa told him about his divine paternity with a critical eye (1523-27, 1532-33). He is so bewildered by his sudden change of fortune that he cannot help asking whether Apollo tells the truth or not (1537-38). Criticism of divine justice had been a recurrent theme earlier, in the first episode; in their effort to reach understanding Euripidean characters frequently venture to impugn the wisdom of the gods themselves.56 It would be wrong on this basis to jump to the conclusion that to Euripides gods have lost their power and it is Tyche that rules. The tension between divine agency and tyche is meant to remain unresolved in order to highlight human limitations and divine power but also to assert the power of the unexpected, forces that are beyond human and sometimes divine control and comprehension. Given the recurrent criticism of divine justice in Euripides, rejecting an understanding of the complex phenomena of life entirely in terms of a limited anthropomorphic deity seems to have been among his purposes. Euripides seems to take advantage of the traditional interaction between tyche and the divine. Though personifying Tyche may be seen as conferring on her the capability of independent and autonomous action, the effect is rather more subtle and ambiguous. We may not have here any explicit association between tyche and a divinity (as at Hipp. 371 72 or Her. 1393), but tyche is often associated with divine agency. The ambiguous and elusive trade-off between agency (divine or human) and contingency receives prominent expression in Ion, Iphigenia in Tauris and Helen, where a divine frame establishes a goal and direction for the human action. As the plot of Ion unfolds, however, this goal and direction are at 54 See Or. 213, 398 ff.; Hel. 560; Hr. 556 ff.; Phoen. 506, 782; Bacch. 370, 414. This is the point of the joke against Euripides in Frogs 893 ff., where he is presented as praying to his "private" gods, who possess no great influence in comparison to the Olympian authorities. 55 Byrnett 1970: 52. 56 See Her. 339-47, 1087 ff.; Hipp. 117-20; Bacch. 1348; Phoen. 86; Tro. 65-68, 469-71, 884, 1280-81; note esp.

Apollo's plan is fundamental, but its realisation is conditioned and its outcome significantly modified by human responses and tyche, which in the end are what the play is all about. The idea of metabole, often connected with tyche, is emphasised by Euripides both verbally57 and dramatically. His liking for clear, sharp contrasts between episodes,58 often initiating unpredictable new lines of action, is very much at home with the idea of metabole, of unexpected reversal. Accordingly, his recognition of the role of tyche is reflected in his taste for exciting, unpredictable plots and virtuoso effects. Consider the sudden turns at the beginnings of episodes in Ion. They break up the action into many situations that come to nothing:59 Xuthus believes he has found a son, but Ion is not his son; Creusa's plan to kill Ion fails; Ion's revenge against Creusa is stopped short. Everything so far has been pointless. Only the last 300 lines, beginning with the startling appearance of the Pythia,60 present a successful event,61 the true recognition. In the experience of the play itself, human ignorance, misinterpretation and violent passions predominate, and in the end, despite Athena's explanation62 of human deception and foiled action as results of Apollo's providential plan, even it has been affected by an uncontrolled and unforeseen element of chance. The clash of the limited human perception with the unforeseeable and the divine, "the abolition of the rules of this world by the heavenly 'Player',"63 is the fundamental principle of such different dramas as Ion and Sophocles' Oedipus Tyrannus. In the latter this clash leads to a tragic end, but in Ion to a by-and-large happy end. It is rewarding briefly to compare the two plays from this point of view. There are striking resemblances as well as differences between these, the only extant foundling plays. The similarities derive mainly from the fact that both involve the exposed hero tale-pattern.64 Both Oedipus and Ion are 57 See Ion 969-70, 1501-18; IT 1117 ff.; Her. 480, 508 ff„ 1291-93; Hel. 711 ff., 1136 ff.; Hipp. 1102-10; Hec. 488 ff. All these references to metabole and tyche are comments on completed action and are placed before important turning points of the plot. "A similar technique occurs in IT. Pylades states the principle (721-2); enter Iphigenia (725) and the beginning of the upswing" (Gibert 1995: 196-97 n. 84). While in Sophocles we have contrasts between scenes of the same episode, and a main reversal, peripeteia. 59 See A61ion 1983; 75 ff. 60 Although the suddenness of her intervention makes us think of it as something accidental, this is not at all the case. As expected, the Pythia's involvement in Ion's case has always been a result of Apollo's influence on and command to her (47-48,1343-47 and 1357-62). 61 Lloyd 1986b; 44 argues that the end the mortals achieve is far more satisfactory than what Apollo has planned for them. 62 See Lloyd 1986b; 45 and n. 65. 63 W. H. Friedrich 1953; 21. 64 Huys 1995; 65 and passim; also Edmunds 1985. On the role of tyche in OT, see the analysis of Pucci 1992.</page><page sequence="14">270 Illinois Classical Studies 24-25 (1999-2000) foundlings and, though in different ways, both plays deal with the theme of unknown personal identity. Exposed hero means exposed fortune. The concept of tyche seems to pervade both these plays, especially if we take into account the importance of its verbal occurrences. But where dramatic structure is concerned, the two dramatists differ. Sophocles has not dramatised the most extraordinary coincidences of Oedipus' life, which are narrated by Oedipus himself (771-833), by the Corinthian messenger (1020 ff.), and by the servant of Laius (1178-81), nor has he stressed their coincidental nature. Moreover, he draws no special attention to the most startling coincidences of all, the double roles of the witness to Laius' murder, who was also the one sent to expose Oedipus, and the Corinthian messenger, who was also the one who received him. It looks as if these coincidences are there only to demonstrate the poet's control of his plot and the god's or fate's control of the world. Besides, the audience was familiar with the myth and had a privileged perspective. As a result, several important references to tyche (especially at 949, 977 and 1080) are ironically undermined by the fact that the audience knows more than the characters, and by the immediately following events. One gets the impression that the dramatic events are working their way inexorably towards the revelation of a divine pattern already established by the gods in advance. Unlike the excitingly unpredictable plot of Ion, that of 07'is more tightly controlled. Correspondingly, Sophocles allows chance only a very limited role in his play, where it is difficult to separate the power of fate from the elaborate mechanism of the plot.65 By contrast, the story of Ion seems to be largely of Euripides' invention. Hermes' prologue provides the audience valuable information the characters lack, but it is only a bare outline, so that at bottom the audience remains in the dark about what is going to transpire. Moreover, the sequence of dramatic events turns out to have an unexpected and seemingly coincidental character. This is enhanced by the fact that Apollo's intervention always remains implicit, and the characters as well as the audience have to wait until the very end in order to learn from Athena the full details of his beneficent purpose. It is significant that, in their respective speeches in response to the revelation of the divine plan, Ion addresses Tyche as responsible for the vicissitudes in a man's life (1512 ff.), whereas Oedipus sees Apollo as the accomplisher of his cruel sufferings (1329-30). At 1080—81 Oedipus' over optimistic assertion that he is the child of good Fortune is tragically wrong, unlike Ion's acknowledgement of the unpredictable operation of Tyche. Of course the two characters are not equally cognizant of the agency of Apollo. Although Ion until the very end of the play is wholly unaware of the god's providential plan, Oedipus is condemned to a different kind of ignorance: 65 I am indebted to Michael Lloyd for this observation.</page><page sequence="15">Vasiliki Giannopoulou 271 He knows the oracle, but is completely in the dark about when and under what circumstances it is going to be fulfilled. At the end of Ion Athena, from her Olympian perspective, places all the turns of event earlier viewed as fortuitous within the framework of Apollo's plan. Yet Euripides, by repeatedly presenting as chance what the deus ex machina will ultimately confirm to be a divine plan, tends to juxtapose chance and divine agency and mark them out in bolder lines. These two powers can seem to be two sides of the same coin. The idea that what at a particular moment seems to be due to chance at another moment turns out to be part of a divine plan is very much at home with the characteristic double perspective of the play (585-86).66 There is room for what at the time appear random happenings in the complex and inscrutable world-order, which in a sense extends beyond the power of the anthropomorphic gods. If this last idea is right, Euripides presents it in a very indirect and ambiguous way. Although Apollo, the god of prophecy, might be expected to predict the future accurately, his failure to do so is not explicitly criticised in the play. By dramatising a modification of a divine plan necessitated by human action the poet seems to subvert the Homeric pattern in which it is the gods who frustrate human plans and intentions; this hardly constitutes a commitment to the overmastering power of chance as opposed to successful divine agency. Rather, the Homeric idea that even the gods may be subject to fate seems to be restated: Even the gods may be subject to mutable and unpredictable tyche. It emerges eventually that gods still direct the action, but they do so within constraints and are no longer uninterruptedly effective. In the world of Ion in particular, the divine plan finding its way to fulfillment must not only negotiate but adapt to unforeseen human responses. Even the actions of the gods can be affected by tyche. This is a striking extension of tyche's power and range, and suggests that what is mortal and contingent both complements and subverts the divine.67 Somerville College, Oxford 66 The play's double character can be seen in the interaction between light irony and serious tragedy. According to Matthiessen 1989-90, the play is partly ironical, in the presentation of the relationship between Xuthus and Ion, partly serious, in the presentation of the relationships between Creusa and Apollo and between Creusa and Ion, and partly also wavering between seriousness and irony, where the relationship of Ion with his divine father is concerned. See also Zacharia 1995 and 1997. 67 My discussion of the relation between divine agency and tyche is not by any means meant to underestimate the human factor in the play. For the interaction between divine and human action, see Lloyd 1986b. I would like here to thank my audience for their useful comments in the discussion session at the Euripides conference in Banff. I am also very grateful to William Allan, Christopher Collard, Martin Cropp, Jasper Griffin, Abraham Kawa, Michael Lloyd, Scott Scullion and Christian Wildberg for reading and commenting on my paper at various stages.</page></plain_text>
