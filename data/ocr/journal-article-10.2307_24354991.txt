<plain_text><page sequence="1">Embodying Technoscience Evan Selinger It is a pleasure to comment briefly on Don Ihde's latest book, not only because I have worked closely with Don over the last four years, but also because he is one of the rare philosophers to bring phenomenological and hermeneutic concerns to bear on the topic of embodiment in a technoscientific context. I shall deal with this, then go on to discuss epistemology engines. Today the issue of embodiment, as it pertains to science and technology, is mostly analysed by interdisciplinary investigators in the field of Science and Technology Stud ies (STS). They use methods from anthropology, ethnography, history, and sociology to study scientific practice, including the body as it is situated in a material culture. Sometimes they thematise the body in such a way that from a phenomenological perspective one might say that STS investigators completely lose it. This happens when: (1) the body is externalised and distributed into networks, and (2) when its significance is reduced to the social structures that influence how bodily action is interpreted. According to Peter Dear, the reason why many STS practitioners do not follow a phenomenological trajectory is that they construe scientific experience as sense-data mediated and augmented by countless arrays of socio-cognitive conven tions. They emphasise these conventions and their historical conditions of possibility in order to show that empirical observations made by scientists are ultimately intersubject ively justified by mechanisms that are typically associated with appeals to political or religious authority. Despite the strong emphasis on social practices, there are still many instances in STS research in which something like the trace of a phenomenological body exists. Within STS there are numerous (explicit and implicit) references to Michael Polanyi's concept of tacit knowledge [1]. Tacit knowledge is found in cognitive processes and © Society for Applied Philosophy, 2003</page><page sequence="2">102 Evan Selinger behaviours that are steered by features, such as intuition, that are inaccessible to con sciousness and propositional articulation. Put in traditional philosophical terms, tacit knowledge corresponds to what Gilbert Ryle calls 'knowing how' and typically is distinguished from 'knowing that', which is explicit theoretical knowledge [2], The reason why STS theorists rely on a notion of tacit knowledge is that many of their analyses centre on the coordination of expert skill. As Hubert Dreyfus argues, experts depend on tacit knowledge to perform skilfully [3]. Their fluid bodily movements are not guided by deliberation or focused attention, but rather through the training of affect and the experiential acquisition of contextual sensitivity, their actions becoming immediate and intuitive situational responses. 'Knowing-that,' by contrast, involves consciously accessible knowledge that can be articulated. It is not characteristic of the expert, but rather, the person's learning a skill through explicit instruction and recitation of rules. It applies to someone who pays conscious attention to the economy of his or her movements. For example, Harry Collins recently sought to expand Polanyi's classification of tacit knowledge by broadening its range of application beyond skills to the production of scientific results in empirically verifiable cases [4]. On the basis of field work in the United States and observations of experimental work in Glasgow University, Collins claims that the problem of tacit knowledge accounts for why twenty-year-old Russian measurements of the quality factor (Q) of sapphire have only just been repeated in the U.S. Collins' focus on tacit knowledge allows him to stress the epistemological importance of personal contact and trust between scientists. It also allows him to suggest that phenomenological information that is not currently contained in experi mental reports should be added to increase the likelihood of accurately reproducing scientific findings. Ihde recognises that STS investigations are problematic because they presuppose and rely on an account of the tacitly performative body but they lack a robust account of embodiment. In other words, they lack a structural understanding of the tactile and kinaesthetic features of the body that make tacit knowledge possible. While they detail some concrete instances of bodily praxis, they do not inquire into the embodied conditions of actional possibility. From Ihde's perspective, this oversight is not surpris ing. STS investigations correspond to what Heidegger calls 'ontic analysis' and as such they lack ontological insight into what the body essentially is [5]. To discover this primordial sense, one needs to turn to phenomenology, moving from Husserl and Merleau-Ponty [6] to contemporary investigators such as Shaun Gallagher and Jonathan Cole (who work on body image and body schema) [7], and Maxine Sheets-Johnstone (who works on inter-corporeality and intelligence in motion) [8]. Although Ihde is well versed in all of this literature, and, as do other phenomenologists, believes that bodily action is the focal and necessary basis for human intelligence, I would characterise some of his most recent goals as compementary but not akin to theirs. To be sure, again like many phenomenologists, he distinguishes the phenomenolo gical body, which he calls 'body one' (i.e. the body that corresponds to our motile, perceptual, and emotive being in the world) from the social and cultural body, which he calls 'body two'. Ihde also repeatedly emphasises that perception is always whole body-perception, which is to say, perception is structured not only by vision, but by all the senses, and is experienced as a plenary gestalt in relation to an environment. Yet his recent work, as exemplified by Bodies and Technology, adds historical, material, and © Society for Applied Philosophy, 2003</page><page sequence="3">Book Symposium: Embodying Technoscience 103 social dimensions that are not often found, or at least not as explicitly developed, in other phenomenological literature. That Ihde's interests differ from other phenomenologists' can be seen in his recent work on epistemology engines. 'Epistemology engine' is a phrase that Ihde uses to desig nate an interactive link between bodies and technologies. Here 'episteme' is used in Foucault's sense of the term. It refers to a historical period in which certain ideas about knowledge are dominant even though an explicit understanding about the guiding motifs that influence how this knowledge is configured may be lacking. The word 'engine,' which in everyday language refers to a machine that converts energy into mechanical force or motion, is used by Ihde to designate how practical involvement with technologies can put certain ideas into motion. This specific sense of engine is best captured by a phrase often used by historians of technology: "Science owes more to the steam engine than the stream engine owes to science." This phrase suggests a radical inversion between the traditional priority of theory over practice. Traditionally, just as engineering is depicted as applied physics, technological innovation is char acterised as scientific spin-off. But in the case of the steam engine, technological innovation inaugurated revolutionary changes in theoretical understanding. In particu lar, it paved the way for advances in calorific theory that in turn led to the development of thermodynamics. Put in philosophical terms, Ihde draws from the phenomenological insight that practical coping precedes theoretical reflection. This is why he inquires into how technologically mediated practical action can subsequently inform how theories, even theories about the body, are configured. The main idea here is that the environment in which one is immersed exerts a strong metaphorical influence over how most, if not all, things that enter into that environment are interpreted. His recent work shows how material practices can function as a pre-cons'cious springboard that shapes what theorists imagine the body to be and how they imagine it to function. Thus, instead of viewing the so-called history of philosophy principally as an intellectual history of ideas, Ihde places it on a continuum with lifeworld activity. He provocatively suggests that philosophical ideas can be generated from technologically meditated lifeworld praxes. Although he may not be comfortable admitting it, Ihde's outlook on the genesis of ideas bears more than a superficial resemblance to materialist views of history found in the Marxist tradition. In Bodies in Technology Ihde investigates two epistemology engines: the camera obscura and virtual reality technologies. In the first case, Ihde shows how the practical use of the camera obscura (the phrase literally means 'dark room', and essentially describes a pinhole camera that inverts images of light) as an object of amusement during the Renaissance led to changes in how the body was theorised. Not only does Leonardo da Vinci create a camera-eye analogue, and not only does Galileo use a variation to discover sunspots, but as a guiding image it influences early modem epistemology in both its rationalist and empiricist variants. As comments in La Dioptrique suggest, Descartes' model of the relation between mental substance and the external world are modelled on the camera obscura. Ihde writes: [The] modern subject is the homunculus inside the camera obscura. What comes from the outside are the impressions from the res extensa that are cast inside the box or body upon its receptor, the eye (retina) analogue where © Society for Applied Philosophy, 2003</page><page sequence="4">104 Evan Selinger images form that represent the external world. So here, at a stroke, we have invented early modern epistemology with its (a) individualized subject (b) enclosed in an object-body, (c) thus creating a body/mind dualism (d) with no direct knowledge of the external world, but a representational one by way of images [9]. A similar process of epistemological modelling is found in Locke. His image of the mind as tabula rasa, the white screen upon which are cast the representations of things in the external world, displays features of the subject as a self inside the camera who can only be aware directly of representations of the external world cast upon the screen. By establishing a connection between the camera obscura and early modern epistemology, Ihde not only tries to explain how technological use shapes an under standing of the body, but also how this understanding led to the modern mind-body problem and the initial philosophical solution of positing a non-perspectival God who served as the guarantor of an objective correspondence theory of truth. From Ihde's perspective, virtual reality technologies are the present-day variant of the camera obscura and they can be said to influence the postmodern epistemological positions endorsed by STS theorists who propose an ontological symmetry between humans and non-humans. What exactly is this ontological symmetry? According to Ihde, there are a number of ways in which STS theorists answer this question and they can be placed on a continuum exhibiting strong and weak varieties. The prin cipal concern that STS researchers have with regard to non-humans is the view that they traditionally have been misunderstood; their voices have been filtered through the mediation of subject, which is to say human-centred analysis. Consequently, some STS theorists try to deconstruct the privileging of a subject-centred analysis by allowing non-humans to express themselves, treating them as 'actants' who, like humans, affect the world through expressions of agency. Put in Merleau-Pontyian terms, they try to allow the non-humans to 'sing' the world. But according to Ihde, this STS strategy fails because it is bounded by the logic of anthropomorphic projection. Within the continuum of symmetry-oriented thinkers, Ihde notes the following rhe torical commonality that undergirds various descriptions: 'Its voice is the well-known anonymous voice of technical writing that (a) employs rigorous avoidance of all anthropomorphisms, (b) is usually cast in terms of formal or abstract or, even better, mathematical formulations, and (c) reduces all entities to variables within its system' [10]. He finds this strategy extant in the cases of theorists pushing for strong symmetry. For example, in his study of scallops, Michel Callon describes these mollusks as needing to be 'enrolled' in order to 'co-operate' with fishermen [11]. Likewise, in Bruno Latour's study of Louis Pasteur, he discusses Pasteur's need to form alliances with microbes [12]. Ihde also find this strategy extant in cases where theorists push for a weaker symmetry. For example, Andrew Pickering refers to the non-humans through the idioms of 'resistance', 'accommodation', and the performative 'dance of agency' [13], and Donna Haraway frequently employs a strategy of grouping heterogeneous terms under the unified figure of 'cyborg' [14]. Although these thinkers view them selves either as post-modern or as amodern, Ihde characterises them as caught in a Cartesian framework. This is because: '(a) the perspective from which the symmetry is Society for Applied Philosophy, 2003</page><page sequence="5">Book Symposium: Embodying Technoscience 105 drawn is unknown, (b) the absence or transcendence of the narrator again creates a god-trick of nonsituatedness, and (c) the question of for whom the system operates also hides the politics of semiotic systems' [15]. According to Ihde, the failure of these STS theorists runs parallel to the failure of virtual reality to live up to the fantasies surrounding it. Ihde concedes that computer games do in fact open up an lalterity relation in which the machinic entity becomes a quasi-other or quasi-world with which the human actor relates' [16]. He also admits that the mediated structure of communication found in e-mail exchanges opens up a 'hermeneutic human-technology relation in that the machinic mediation presumably refers to a real other of a sort and becomes in this case a kind of language-analog mediation' [17]. But in neither instance is the phenomenological body left behind or the carnal and existential needs of the body supplanted, no matter how enthral ling these technologies may be. Humans can only use virtual reality technologies (or any technology for that matter), because the human-technology relation is funda mentally parasitic upon bodily norms. In short, despite the hype surrounding virtual reality, the lived body never totally fuses with the computerised one, which is to say that ontological symmetry between the human and the non-human is never fully established. Finally, two minor criticisms. The first pertains to Ihde's philosophy of embodiment. I want to suggest that: (1) it is not nearly as descriptive as it could and perhaps ought to be, and that (2) his own analysis of technology suggests as much. Merleau-Ponty's conception of the lived body came to be criticised by a number of theorists ranging from Iris Marion Young [18] to Ihde himself for not being gendered and for being too constrained by fantasies of active sportsmanship. In other words, his single version of the lived body did not accord with many first-person experiences and as a result did not accord with the primary standard of phenomenological justification. Although he displays hermeneutic sensitivity and does not fall into Merleau-Ponty's trap, Ihde still leaves the reader with an all too undifferentiated, one might even say, generic sense of the body. In the future I would like to see him expand his account so that he pays closer attention to how the different types of apprenticeship that different bodies go through influence prevailing attitudes towards technology. Prima facie, some people find it easier to adapt to technological mediation than others. Some people are willing to be seduced by Utopian and dystopian technolo gical pronouncements. Some people are even willing to incorporate a strong cyborg existence into their everyday routines. One might wonder, as I do, what separates the former from the latter kinds of people. Perhaps it is simply a matter of individual choice. Perhaps the issue is psychological and pertains to the rigidity and flexibility of personality types. Perhaps sociologists and systems-theorists are the best people to consult on this question since they can explain how desires and aversions are manu factured. But if the lifeworld is as important as Ihde claims, then there ought to be a discernible connection between it and the choices that embodied agents gravitate towards. Because Ihde eschews the broad social and normative analyses of technology, it is conspicuous that he refrains from discussing why the lived body averts or is pulled to some technological trajectories but not others. For example, many senior citizens retired before computers were common in the workplace. They are frequently depicted as scornful of the Information Age and © Society for Applied Philosophy, 2003</page><page sequence="6">106 Evan Selinger too disdainful of change to adapt to computers. Yet, in some instances it is essential for them to become computer-sawy in order remain connected with other people, special interests, financial changes, and world events. Perhaps Ihde could analyse this situation from an embodied perspective and show how what appears to be fear and stubbornness is at bottom an embodied response to an environment that is unfriendly to them qua embodied aged beings. For example, whereas the ability to see an icon or the cursor being dragged can be taken for granted when teaching computer use to children, it cannot be presupposed with many senior citizens whose visual realm may be severely restricted. It would thus be interesting to see Ihde apply phenomenological variation to different relations between bodily ease and views about technology. My second criticism is one that Ihde has received for years and pertains to normativity. Rather than rehashing the traditional complaints about how phenomenological invest igation is so descriptive that it leads to a lack of normative concern, I want to be specific and return to the issue of ontological symmetry in the post-modern STS accounts. Discussions of ontological symmetry suggest that a profound shift in perception about the relation between humans and non-humans is in order. What Ihde does not discuss is the degree to which this 'agentic shift' (to borrow a phrase from Stanley Milgram [19]) is part of a metaphorical line of thinking whereby humans transfer responsibility for an outcome from themselves to a more abstract agent. In classical Marxist analysis, the concern over symmetry is expressed with regard to the alienation that ensued when workers are treated like machines. Today, one might be inclined to say that the problems associated with symmetry between machines and humans affect members of all classes. An example from Neil Postman will concretize this point: Through a curious form of grammatical alchemy, the sentence 'We use the computer to calculate' comes to mean 'The computer calculates.' If a com puter calculates, then it may decide to miscalculate or not calculate at all. That is what bank tellers mean when they tell you that they cannot say how much money is in your checking account because 'the computers are down.' The implication, of course, is that no person at the bank is responsible. Computers make mistakes or get tired or become ill. Why blame people? [20] I would like Ihde to comment more in future on the ideological nature of symmetrical thinking and address how it impacts not only on epistemological but also on moral models. I suspect that this line of inquiry will move Ihde away from the issue of symmetry entirely. It seems to me that we are in the midst of a historical shift in which trust in human experts is becoming redistributed to trust in machine experts. Changes in a number of areas that interest Ihde, from computer-modelled war simulators to medical imaging, suggest that human decision-making is increasingly being depicted as unreliable and too subjective, whereas standardised technologies are taken to eliminate doubt, complexity, and ambiguity. Certainly this is an area in which phenomenologists such as Dreyfus are interested. But for all of Dreyfus's virtues, he is far too phenomenological and not sufficiently hermeneutically sensitive. This makes the issue of technological expertise even more pressing for Ihde to explore as new territory that is continuous with his past work.
