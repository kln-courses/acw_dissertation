<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA 1984-1990 'Archaeology in Albania 1973-83' (AR 1983-84, 102-119) provided a survey of archaeological research carried out in Albania between those dates, and in like manner this article summarizes the work of 1984-1990. This continued to con- centrate on three main fields: prehistory, Illyrian antiquity, and late antiquity to the middle ages. It draws upon articles published in Iliria between 1984-1990, but in cases where there has been fuller publication, the respective literature has also been noted. (For further information on publications on Albanian archaeology, see AR 1983-84 102-04.) The centres at which research has been carried out are grouped according to regions from N to S (Fig. 1) and the division within each region is chronological. Drawings are by Elena Nikolla and Ilir Zaloshnja and photographs by Adnan Hyka. SHKODER DISTRICT Shtoj (excavation by A. Koka, 1984, 1986, 1988, 1990; see also AR 1983-84 104). Work continued on the Illyrian tumulus cemetery in the plain of Shtoj, comprising around 160 tumuli. Continuing excavation begun in 1980, six tumuli were opened. These were constructed of stone and earth and were usually defined by a ring of stones at their bases (Fig. 2). An uncom- mon case is that of tumulus No. 10, which is surrounded by three rings of stone (Fig. 3). Among the tumuli, No. 6 is distinguished for its construction, evidence of burial rituals and rich grave goods (Iliria 1 (1990), 17-23). It was ascertained that some tumuli were built at the beginning of the BA and re- used during the IA, while others were new constructions of the latter period. Shkrel (excavation by B. Jubani, 1990; see also AR 1983- 84, 104). Continuing excavation begun in 1983 in the tumulus cemetery of Shkrel, two entire tumuli were opened, while a third was only partially investigated. The excavation supplied new information on the structure of the tumuli of this cem- etery, which are of types not previously known, with cupolas of stone not mixed with earth. It also became clear that this necropolis contained no tumuli with surface graves. In the graves and outside them were found many remains of plates, tools, flint chippings, bones of animals and birds, pieces of charcoal etc. The pottery was of the initial phase of the Dinaric culture. Zagore (excavation by Zh. Andrea, 1987). Excavation in the unfortified Illyrian settlement in the village of Zagore, in the region of Mbishkodra (Fig. 4), uncovered in situ parts of clay floors covered by a platform of beams, as well as parts of a hearth set upon on a bed of stones. The cultural stratum of this settlement is LBA, but within this period two closely linked phases are evident. The pottery of the earlier phase is characterized by cups with cut-off rims and by vessels with horseshoe-shaped handles, etc., typically decorated with horizontal bands, horseshoe-shapes and conical darts. The association of this pottery with bronze objects places this phase as the earlier, no later than the final stage of EBA. The material culture of the Zagore settlement resembles that of settlements in W Albania (Gajtan, Belaj), as well as those of the Illyrian regions of the NW Balkans. Belaj (excavation by F. Prendi, 1987). The unfortified settlement near the village of Belaj, on the banks of the Bune, extends over two stepped terraces, one above the other. Excavation showed clearly that in the lower terrace the cultural stratum is narrower and has a mixture of antique and prehis- toric material, while the deposits of the upper terrace are of two strata, one prehistoric and the other antique. In the antique layer pottery of the 4th-2nd Cts BC predominates, but there were also fragments typologically earlier than the end of the 4th Ct BC, notably the rims of Corinthian type-A amphoras. The prehistoric stratum is distinguished by rich and various pottery: cups with broad rims and deep interiors, dishes with pronounced biconical profiles, with horseshoe-shaped handles, or handles rising above the rim, etc. Ornament is modelled or incised, with geometric motifs. The oldest settlement at Belaj was established during the period of transition from BA to IA, and has links with Zagor, Gajtan and Baltoje. The pottery also has features in common with that of the EBA of the Illyrian regions of the central Adriatic. Beltoje (excavation by B. Lahi, 1987). The ancient town of Beltoje is situated to the S of the fortress of Shkoder. Two principle periods of settlement were identified, the first BA, the second spanning the 3rd-lst Cts BC. Traces of two walls were found: the first, of primitive construction, was a S wall built of unworked stones of medium size, the spaces between them on the exterior face filled by smaller stones. This was the oldest circuit wall of the small town, built towards the end of the BA (Fig. 5). All that remained of the second wall, which had a width of 3.5m, was the exterior face, with stones worked on their horizontal edges. This belonged to the end-3rd Ct/beginning-2nd Ct BC. The excavation yielded rich archaeological material: among the prehistoric pottery (LBA), cups of various types were most common, biconical cups, dishes with axe-shaped feet, etc. In the urban pottery of the 3rd-Ist Cts BC, the chief place was occupied by amphoras of greco-italian type, cups, etc. Ganjolle (excavation by B. Lahi, 1988). In the small town of Ganjolle excavation of the fortification system was begun in order to clarify the stratigraphy of the settlement. A single cultural stratum was identified, dating to the 2nd-lsts Cts BC. In a mixed context were found also fragments going back to the EBA. Parts of walls which belonged to two fortification systems were found, apparently of different periods. In the absence of small finds there is difficulty in precise dating of the oldest fortification, which is of primitive construction, but the second bears typological resemblance to that of Beltoje II, and is datable to the beginning of the 2nd Ct BC. The town was also inhabited in the 1st Ct BC. Bushat (excavation B. Lahi, 1990). The aim of excavation here was to determine the plan, chronological context and function of a monument the outline of which had been established earlier. Present opinion is that it may be a public fountain of the end-2nd/beginning-1 st Ct BC. Lohe (excavation by Z. Tafilica, 1987,89). Excavation over two years was undertaken in the upper village of Lohe, with the object of clarifying the plan of a three-aisled basilica. It seems that this was an ECh church of the 4th-5th Cts AD which must have had its origin as a smaller church with three aisles, and was later enlarged by the addition of a narthex. The excavation yielded capitals, frescoes, fragments of pottery and seven bronze coins. Shkoder (see also AR 1983-84, 104). In the town of Shkoder, one of the oldest in Albania, work concentrated on the fortress and the lower town. Excavation inside the circuit walls of the fortress (by B. Lahi and G. Hoxha, 1986-87) revealed thick deposits of the following cultural strata: mixed urban and proto-urban; late antiquity; early Med; 14th-15th Cts; and 16th-19th Cts. Traces of a circuit wall of the 12th- 14th Cts came to light, as well as the outlines of walls of Med construction and the ruins of a 5th-Ct building of trapezoidal plan with five rooms and a sump with plastered entrance below</page><page sequence="2">72 Zh.

The fortification system of the town, with two circuit walls, has been identified. The first wall, which encloses 2.5 ha, is defended by two fortresses of horseshoe '... .. "':...''form. The second wall encloses .2 ha, and has three towers of :!~!~s~~~~~~~~ !!?!i!-!~::i;?: ':irregular plan and four gates. In the surrounding area below the town is the residence of the feudal Zaharias family. This was all built around 1400, and is made up of three parts. In the highest, central, area were found the residence of the lord, VW ~d~. accommodation for guests and guards, a furnace, storage for wheat, ovens, the main entrance complex of the residence and FIG. 2-1\00.1I, enthe cister. To the W were found the sites of dwellings with an entrance communicating with the central area. The archae- ological material dates to the 14-15th Cts. Within the town limits was found the extension of a Med residential area, and on the interior of the circuit wall the principle entrance to the town; it was established that the fortification towers of this wall belong to its second phase of construction. The earliest FIG. 2 entrance to the town was found below the foundations of the church of St. Mark. The ground plans of the church of St. Mark and the church of St. Mary, Vau i Dejds, were deter- mined by means of sondage. FIG. 3 FIG. 4 one of them (Fig. 6). Outside the Med fortification system were discovered two fragments of wall resembling Illyrian construction of the pre-urban period. Lower town (excavation by B. Lahi and G. Hoxha, 1988- 1990). In a terrace alongside the Drin, to the SE of the fortress, parts of the S circuit walls of late antiquity were found, traces of two fortresses of horseshoe shape, and the - ruins of dwellings of several historical periods (2nd Ct BC to 12th Ct AD). Notable among the finds was a deposit of amphoras of the Dressel type, one bearing a seal of Diodorus, and also a treasure of 303 bronze coins of the 4th Ct AD. At another site in this part of town (excavated by S. Anamali and H. Spahiu, 1984), further study was undertaken of the area with mosaic floor that was discovered during work in 1978-79 (AR 1983-84, 104). The excavation yielded new architectural elements and demonstrated that the late antique stratum had been followed by the Med one without interruption (Fig. 7). Vau i Dejis (excavation by Gj. Saraci, 1984-89). Research undertaken in the 'Mountain of Dejd', where the ruins of the Med town of Danje are located (Fig. 8) is of particular interest for study of the urban construction and architecture of the Med FIG. 5 </page><page sequence="4">74 Zh. ANDREA FIG. 6 FIG. 7 FIG. 8</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA 1984-90 75 TROPOJE DISTRICT Bujan (excavation by Zh. Andrea, 1984, 1986). In the Illyrian cemetery of the village of Bujan nine small tumuli of three different types were opened: (1) tumuli built entirely of stone (Fig. 9); neither graves nor traces of skeletons were encoun- tered here, but only fragments of pottery distributed on the surface and inside. (2) tumuli of earth with a central wall of stones, below the surface of which were found scattered pottery fragments; no graves were found, and it would appear that these tumuli were cenotaphs; (3) tumuli built with stone and earth; among these the most complete structure appeared in the sixth tumulus, covering six graves outlined by stones and floored with mosaic of white stones, with the burial or inciner- ated remains placed outside the grave. The tumuli are of BA and IA construction. PUKE DISTRICT Koman (excavation by H. Spahiu, 1984; see also AR 1983-84, 104-5). Further work following that of 1982-93 in the cem- etery of the fortress of Dalmace (Fig. 10) is of particular interest to research into the Arber culture of Koman and the Illyrio-Albanian culture. Deeper excavation was undertaken at the W and S limits of the cemetery and 50 tombs were opened. These were rectangular cists made of slabs of pummice and limestone, with the corpse laid on its back. Finds included objects of types already known, as well as some encountered for the first time; two pendants, resembling Illyrian examples of the IA, are of particular interest. KUKES DISTRICT Dajc (excavation by M. Bela, 1985-87). In the settlement of DajG four cultural strata were distinguished. The oldest was Eneolithic and is represented by black pottery with grooved decoration, which links this culture with the contemporary Nezir II in the N region, also with that of Maliq II in the S. The second level is EBA, of which crude pottery with plastic decoration is typical, as is pseudo-barbotine pottery resembling that of Nezir IIIa and Maliq IIIa. The third level belongs to the end-BA/beginning-IA. Finds of later date consisted of early Med pottery, resembling that of Bushat and Symize. Pus i Thate (excavation by M. Bela, 1989). Excavation was undertaken in a settlement area of the EBA. Pottery of technique, forms, and decoration in relief (notably embossed bands) resembling that of Nezir IIIb and Maliq IIIb places the settlement at the end of the EBA, as does the absence of pseudo-barbotine pottery. Myc-Has (excavation by M. Bela, 1988). Following work to uncover the Illyrian culture in the Has region, six tumuli were opened below the village of Myg-Has. All were small, built of stones above a central grave, or simply of stones. The tumuli covered 37 graves with pits or stone enclosures, used from the end of the BA to the beginning of the IA. The material culture of the tomb is consistent with the diffusion of the Mat-Glasinac culture. Krume (excavation by M. Bela, 1989). Two small tumuli hewn in the hills of Krume were constructed chiefly of stone with a little earth and a covering of stones. The graves were surrounded with stones but lacked covers and had the form of long cists covered with slabs. The tumuli were used during the LBA and the 4th-5th Cts BC, a period to which the greater number of the graves belong. Mujaj (excavated by M. Bela, 1987). Three small tumuli, constructed mainly with stones and a little earth, were opened FIG. 9 and found to contain 18 graves, with inhumations in all but two cases where there were cremated remains. Small finds in the graves date the tumuli to the 4th-5th Ct BC. Pece (excavation by L. Perzhita 1986-89). Excavation was carried out for four consecutive years in the Illyro-Albanian fortress of Pece, in the basin of the White Drin (Drin i Bardhe), during which the plan was established and the system of fortification studied (Fig. 11). The fortress had an irregular form and its walls were built of bonded ashlar. The form of the fortress is consistent with a date in the 3rd-4th Cts AD. The following cultural strata were established: the oldest was 6th-5th Cts BC, represented principally by pottery contempor- ary with that discovered in NE Albania at Kosova; the next was 3rd-2nd Cts BC, as shown by local pottery and imports from Greece, and also by stumps of walls of construction typical of that period, evidence of the existence of an urban habitation site; the next period, of the 3rd-6th Cts AD, was the densest layer, and included a series of architectural elements, such as the circuit walls, a single-naved basilica with hemicycle apse, naos and narthex, main entrance and another on the W side; a gate-tower, the area before the courtyard, stairs connecting this with the basilica, and some houses situated facing the complex. A date between the 4th and 6th FIG. 10</page><page sequence="6">76 Zh. ANDREA FIG. 11 Cts AD is given by the pottery, and by some reconstruction in the basilica. The last period of occupation was Med, probably 9th-1 ith Ct AD, and is represented by pottery resembling that of Shurdhah and Symize. Bardhoc (excavation by L. Perzhita, 1989-90; see also AR 1983-84, 105). Excavation in Gradishte, the Bardhoc of late antiquity, uncovered the entire circuit walls and the oval ground plan, as well as a rectangular fortress similar to those of Pogradec and Ulmetum in Bulgaria, dating to the 6th Ct AD. Also discovered were the gate, a simple unfortified entrance, and some rectangular houses. The stratigraphy exhibited two strata, the oldest of the end-BA/beginning-IA, to which belonged traces of a wall which had later served as the foundation for the walls of late antiquity. The second stratum was late antique, of the 4th-6th Cts AD. The last occupation period at Gradishte was 9th- 11th Cts. DIBER DISTRICT Topojan (excavation by A. Bunguri, 1987-89). In the Neo- lithic settlement of Topojan two cultural layers have been determined. In the older, MN layer, the finds were chiefly of pottery with grey drawn on black, an important feature which attaches this culture chronologically to those of Cetush II, Kolsh II, Blaz III and Cakran-Dunavec, also to the MN of the Adriatic region. The second layer belongs to the beginning of LN. Some dish forms and ornaments resemble those of Blaz III, Kolsh II, Kamni I and Barc II and, outside Albania, of Danilo III-IV and Hvar-Lisisic. MIRDITE DISTRICT Prosek (excavation by N. Doda, 1985-86). Following test excavations of 1985 in the early Med cemetery of Prosek, work concentrated in two sectors (A and B), and particularly on two small adjacent hills. In all, 42 graves were found-cist graves of pummice and limestone, and simple pits of a type seen for the first time in the cemeteries of this period in Albania. The burial custom prescribed the placing of the remains on the back, directly on the ground. In the cemeteries of sector A, the orientation was N-S, and the finds rich in objects typical of the Koman culture, known also at Lezhe, Shurdhah, Bukli and Kruja and dating to the 6th-8th Cts AD. In sector B the orientation was E-W, and the inventory relatively poor. It is thought that the two sectors excavated represent two successive phases of utilization of the cemetery, with the graves of sector B extending beyond the 8th Ct AD. Bone finds at Prosek (A. Dhima, 1985-86). Rich bone material was recovered from the cemetery of Prosek, compris- ing 28 skulls and 90 bones of individuals from the region of Comblik. This series of skeletons forms an important source of information for the anthropology of the Med Arbers. As a whole, it falls within the anthropotypological context character- istic of EMed. Preliminary examination of the bones suggests double utilization of the cemetery, without interruption, but in successive phases by the same population, which had lived and been buried here over a long period. Koder-Rreshen (excavation by N. Doda, 1990). Following work carried out to uncover EMed tombs, excavation was undertaken in a small natural mound to the NE of the town of Rreshen. Nine cist-graves were discovered, with floors of limestone and pummice, or, rarely, of river pebbles. The custom was of extended burial, on the back. Finds from the tombs showed that this cemetery was contemporary with that of Prosek. DURRES DISTRICT Durres (excavation by L. Miraj, 1987-90). In the old city of Durres (Epidamnus, Dyrrachium), the important work of clearing the amphitheatre was continued. Excavation concen- trated on certain areas: in the NE zone three galleries were uncovered and it was found that here, unlike in other areas, they were two-storeyed. After the abandonment of the monument, one of the galleries had been modified for use as a chapel with walls decorated in fresco, with preliminary dating to the 10th Ct. There were three successive layers of fresco, belonging to different periods. The painting of the third layer was 12th-13th Cts (M. Zeqo, 1987). In the SW part of the amphitheatre trials were made in three more galleries, and in two of them tombs of the 7th Ct were found. It was also established that the structures of the amphitheatre were in evidence until the 16th Ct, even though in-filling had begun in the 7th Ct or even earlier, after the abandonment of the monument. Further work uncovered the principal N gallery of the amphitheatre, and investigated its connection with the arena. Of the latter the stone foundation was discovered, about 2m below the side of the podium. Upon opening a small chamber, the colombarium, which was found in the first elliptical gallery of the amphitheatre, to the right of the chapel, 40 skeletons were discovered, with finds of the 10th Ct. This series of skeletons is the most complete available for the EMed period in the maritime zones and establishes links between the anthropological finds of the two great ethnocultural zones of Albania (H. Bllaca, 1987). Baths (excavated by L. Miraj, 1990). Components of the 2nd Ct AD public baths of Dyrrachium, discovered in 1960, were identified: the apodyterium, frigidarium with pool, tepidarium, caldarium, and sudatorium and praefurnium. Also found was a small well where the waters of the pool had been chanelled, and on either side a chanel beneath the pavement of the street, covered with bricks in the form of a pitched roof. It was also clear that the baths of Dyrrachium had been reused during late antiquity (5th-6th Cts), while in the 7th-8th Cts the monument had been transformed into a cemetery (I. Kabashi, 1989). Arapaj (excavation by S. Hidri 1984, 1987-88; see also AR 1983-84, 108). Following earlier excavation of the ECh basilica of Arapaj, work concentrated on complete uncovering</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA 1984-90 77 FIG. 12 of the atrium. In the S region of the basilica, excavation below the mosaic floor revealed a monumental tomb of the 6th Ct. Excavation in the outer areas of the basilica sought to elucidate certain anomalies posed by geophysical study of the founda- tions of walls, and to clarify their function and their connec- tions with the monument. At the same time test excavations were carried out in the foundations of the altar floor, where three tombs were found, and in the S porch, where there was a tomb apparently of a later period, post- 11th Ct. Fortress (excavation by A. Hoti 1985-86). During excava- tion to expose structural elements of the circuit wall, one of the principal entrances was discovered in the SE part of the fortress, in wall I. The entrance was horseshoe shaped, its arched upper part made of brick bonded with limestone mortar. The stratigraphy showed four cultural layers: 1st Ct AD; 5th- 6th Cts; 9th-1 lth Cts and 12th-15th Cts In the N part of the city (excavated by A. Sila, 1990) part of a defensive wall of the Sth-6th Cts was discovered, with four fortified corers. It would appear that this was part of the second ring of circuit walls. Durres City. In recent years intense work in and around the city of Durres was undertaken in trial digs which have brought to light a series of monuments. A mosaic floor discovered accidentally in 1947 was investigated (excavation by M. Zeqo, 1988-90). The floor, of black and white opus tessellatum, has of four scenes with zoomorphic motifs of maritime mythology (Fig. 12). The monochrome mosaic is an example of Roman art and dates to the end of the 1st Ct AD. Remains of walls, discovered above the level of the mosaic and built with bricks bonded with mortar, are of the 2nd Ct AD. According to a Latin inscription they are the work of an at6lier of the 2nd Ct AD which no longer functioned in the 4th Ct. Two fragments of 3rd-4th Ct mosaic with geometric and floral motifs were found in another part of the city. Of great interest is the discovery of a polychrome mosaic, using stones of white, red, green, black and orange, etc., and worked in opus tessellatum of the 4th-5th Cts AD. The bucolic subject shows a landscape with a man among animals and plants. The mosaic is earlier both in conception and technique than the mosaic of the basilica of Arapaj and those of the late antique basilicas discovered in Byllis. Notable among the monuments discovered in Durres is a structure of circular plan (excavation by A. Hoti 1986-88) (Fig. 13). Vestiges of a colonnade were clearly evident, consisting of two complete columns and two fragmented ones, two capitals, a decorated impost of white marble and part of a floor covered with stone slabs. A podium was found at the centre, with three treads of a stair, and beside it a well, of opus mixtum technique. The courtyard was discovered, with the main entrance to the monument in its E side, in the form of a</page><page sequence="8">78 Zh. ANDREA FIG. 13 vestibule and a group of ancilliary areas. The monument was constructed in the late 5th/early 6th Ct AD, and between the beginning of the 7th Ct and the 8th Ct it was destroyed and converted into a cemetery, as is shown by graves discovered both inside and out. 2 0 5CM FIG. 14 During trial excavation at another point in the city (excava- tions of F. Tartari and H. Myrto, 1988), traces of a city dwelling of the 2th-3rd Cts AD were found, forming part of an insula built on two sides of a main road, following an orthogo- nal system. Pottery finds were characteristic of the 2-3th Cts (Fig. 14). Excavation in another part of the city (excavation of H. Hidri, F. Tartari, 1989) revealed traces of buildings of various periods: lst-3rd Cts AD; 5th-6th Cts AD; and post-6th Ct AD. This last period is attested also in the archaeological material gathered nearby, particularly by pottery with forms and ornament typical of Durres in the 6th-7th Ct AD (Fig. 15). Kenete (excavation by H. Myrto, 1984-86). A monument thought to be a sanctuary has been completely uncovered (Fig. 16). The vertical stratigraphy shows two levels and two phases of construction. The oldest level pertains to a sacrificial altar and is represented by finds of the 7th-5th Cts BC. The later level belongs with another structure, dated to the 4th-3rd Cts BC on the basis of archaeological material and a coin of Durres, of the Herakles type. Gjuri{aj (excavation by H. Myrto, 1986-90). In the village of Gjurigaj, near the fortress of Ishem, investigation concen- trated on uncovering a three-aisled basilical church, with apses at the E end and a narthex and atrium to the W. Part of the walls of this monument are preserved in good condition, as are  X /A k \\\\j y^;;;~ -I</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA 1984-90 79 the floors and some architectonic marble, such as Theodosian and foliage capitals, columns, imposts, and panels of the chancel screen; there were also fragments of mosaic of several colours, glass, fragments of fresco, etc. The entire atrium was uncovered and found to be square in form, with two entrances; inside it were found the pilasters of a square porch and Med tombs. The church dates to the 2nd quarter of the 6th Ct AD and was destroyed by a strong earthquake. Spitalle (excavation by H. Hidri 1989-90). Work concen- trated on uncovering the remains of an aqueduct which furnished water to the hilly area of the town, also upon plotting its route. Hamallaj (excavation by P. Nure, 1989). Remains were discovered of a 3rd-2nd Ct BC building of square plan with four rooms. A tomb built of bricks, but lacking contents, was found below the floor of one of the rooms. TIRANA DISTRICT Brar (A. Dhima, 1987). Excavation in the church of St. Mary in the village of Brar revealed the entire monumental tomb of Michael Skuraj, a chief (sebastos) of the clan of the same name. The tomb, which bears the date 1201, had been opened and the skeletons of members of the family mentioned in an inscription on the main tablet were no longer present. Sixteen other skeletons were found below the tomb, arranged in six layers reaching down to the primary rock surface, which dates to the 1 th-12th Cts. To this period also belong nine tombs in the narthex of the church, where there were 45 adult skeletons, belonging to the local village population during the pre-Turkish middle ages. This series of skeletons is the first of its kind from the EMed period and from it an anthropological profile of the Albanian population of this region may be determined. I \ / 3 "\ 2 I / 10 0 5 CM 12 FIG. 15 ELBASAN DISTRICT Lleshan (excavation by R. Hasa, 1987-89). The prehistoric settlement of Lleshan grew up on one of the mountainous flanks of Shpat, to the E of the village of the same name, and to the S of the town of Elbasan. The highest part of the settlement is enclosed by a wall, thus forming an acropolis of sorts. The rest forms a terrace path, enclosed within another circuit wall. Excavation in the acropolis and in the area of the trough revealed two layers, of which the first belongs to the urban period. This level yielded local pottery and imports from Dyrrachium and Apollonia, as well as several coins of Dyrra- chium, Apollonia, Oricum, Epiros and Corcyra. Of particular interest is the discovery of a treasure of 2,823 coins, placed in two bronze dishes; 13 of the coins were drachmas in which the two mints of Dyrrachium predominate. During excavation to clear the ancient wall, a pit containing 800 more coins was found. The prehistoric level is of the LBA and EIA. The pottery resembled that found in the N regions of the country, but was not without connections with the Devollian culture of S Albania. Elbasan (excavation by Y. Cerova 1987-88). Archaeologi- cal excavation begun in the fortress of Elbasan was continued in the SW part. A clear stratigraphy was determined at the settlement site, as well as remains of structures. Layer (1) of the end-3rd Ct AD, marks the beginning of life in this settle- ment. Layer (2), 5-6th Cts AD, has pottery which is poorer both in quantity and quality. Layer (3), 1 lth-15th Ct, is repre- sented by abundant archaeological material on the whole surface of the excavated area. Layer (4) belongs to the period of Ottoman domination. On the surface of the area investigated were discovered the ruins of an ECh monument, in association with a coin of Arcadius (395-408). Treasure of Shales (Sh. Gjongecaj, 1986). A treasure containing 51 bronze coins of the 4th Ct BC, placed in a clay receptacle, was found accidentally in the village of Shales, in Cerrik. Forty-six of the coins were from Dyrrachium, of the FIG. 16 </page><page sequence="10">80 Zh. ANDREA I: I I j ir 5 r ;" i-7: j 8 12 l,4,6,7,11,12 o . CM 2,3,5,8-10 ° - - 5CM FIG. 17 armed Herakles type, one coin of Apollonia, of the Apollo- obelisk type, one coin of the Macedonian king Casander (Herakles/lion's head), and two coins of Corcyra, of the ship/cantharus type. The greater number belonged to mints of Dyrrachium and were the oldest bronze coins put into circula- tion in this town. The coin of the Macedonian king, dated 316-306 BC, indicated that the treasure was buried at the time of the domination of Casander. The year 312 BC, when the inhabitants of Apollonia and of Dyrrachium rose up and expelled the forces of Casander from their towns may indicate the period of concealment. LIBRAZHD DISTRICT Rrashtan (excavation by I. Gjipali, 1984). In the cultural stratum of the EN settlement of Rrashtan, two habitation horizons were distinguished, but belonging to the same period. The archaeological material consisted principally of barbotine pottery and to a lesser degree of stamped ware, monochrome and red, and with white painting on a red ground. Also found were terracottas, altar tables and fragments of rhytons. The culture of this settlement is linked to the EN of Podgori- Vashteemi-Kolsh I, but the presence of certain later elements show it to be a late phase in the development of N culture in Albania. Rajce (excavation by I. Gjipali, 1987-88). Excavation in the prehistoric settlement of Rajce aimed to verify the strati- graphy of this settlement, which was placed at the beginning of EN by sondage in 1977. Pottery predominated among the finds, including barbotine, monochrome and red, painted ware with coffee-colour and white on a red ground and stamped ware. Of particular note were decorated rectangular altar tables resembling those of Rrashtan in Kosova and Porodin in Macedonia, as well as some fragments of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic terracottas (Fig. 17). The material discovered places this settlement at the end of the EN and not its begin- ning, as had previously been thought. LUSHNHJE DISTRICT Babunje (excavation by P. Cuko, 1989-90). Archaeological work in the small town of Babunje had as its primary aim the clarification of the fortification system and the ruins of antique houses. Traces of two walls were uncovered, the first con- structed of worked pummice and belonging to the 4th-3rd Ct BC fortification of the town. The second was built of smaller, unworked stones, and had advanced details of plan, with angles, which place it in the pre-urban period, as confirmed by the pottery. Also excavated were a 4th-3rd Ct BC dwelling of four rooms and the ruins of a further antique dwelling of the 3rd-2nd Ct BC. The excavations have shown that life in the town of Babunje began in the IA and continued until the 1st Ct BC, but the highest point of its development was reached during the 4th-3rd Cts BC. GRAMSH DISTRICT Tervol (excavation by A. Papajani, 1988-89). The ruins of the Med castle of Tervol are situated on a rock formation about 600m above sea level. The excavation explored the extension of part of the perimeter wall of the castle, which encloses an area of .29 ha. The double-door entrance was discovered, built of limestone bonded with mortar, also a square tower nearby; a water reservoir was completely cleared out. In the area of the castle trials were made in some partly destroyed houses, one of which had a more or less hemispherical plan. The pottery found was of the 12-14th Ct. FIER DISTRICT Cakran (excavated by M. Korkuti, 1984). Trial excavations in the known MN settlement at Cakran in Fier aimed to verify the statigraphy established during the investigations of 1969-70. On the basis of pottery discovered at three points, the oldest phase at this settlement was found to correspond to Dunavec phase I. Apollonia. In the city of Apollonia, one of the largest of the Adriatic region and the best known among the 30 towns of this name in antiquity, archaeological investigations of five years continued on the circuit walls and in the necropolis. Circuit walls (excavation by L. Koci, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990; see also AR 1983-84, 110). The main aim was to follow the circuit walls on the E side of the city (Fig. 18). Here was discovered a gate protected by a small rectangular tower which linked the city to the E zone. During work on the S circuit wall, the entire plan and system of fortification of the S gate was revealed. It was defended by a round tower, and on its E side was a small entrance that communicated with the interior of the town. In the ancient necropolis (excavated by V. Dimo, 1988; see also AR 1983-84, 110), excavation was completed of tumulus 3, constructed of earth. This covered 30 graves, of which eight </page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA 1984-90 81 FIG. 19 FIG. 18 belonged to the period of foundation of the tumulus (end-8th Ct BC to beginning-6th Ct BC). The other graves had been introduced into the tumulus at the end-4th/beginning-3rd Ct BC. They were cists, made of bricks and roofed. There were also three monumental communal graves with cremations, of the beginning of the 3rd Ct BC. The campaign of 1990 (excavation by V. Dimo) followed up the discovery of a courtyard dwelling with pluvium, enclosed by a corridor covered in mosaic, and of the principal street of the city. Byllis Agora (excavation by N. Ceka, 1984, 1986-87, 1990; see also AR 1983-84, 109). In the Illyrian town of Byllis investigation of the urban period concentrated on the agora. The main objective was the discovery of the promenade (Stoa I) (Fig. 19). This promenade delimited the NE angle of the agora. Its plan was L-shaped with the long side to the N, divided into two by a colonnade. It had two floors, with the lateral elements closed, to make alcoves and staircase wells. The lower storey was treated like a Doric colonnade, with octagonal columns, and similar columns were found in the dividing colonnade. Few architectonic elements were dis- covered and, except for the columns of the first storey, they showed an understanding of Ionian forms, with three conjoint parts and a pilaster capital, which suggested a treatment of the second floor following the models of Apollonia. Similarly, in the second arm the extremities were closed and the colonnade invisible except for its central part. The promenade was built in the 3rd-2nd Cts BC. In the 3rd Ct AD it was destroyed and during the 5th-6th Cts AD was used to build houses. It has similarities with the promenades of Apollonia, Klos and Epiros, in the closed treatment of lateral areas and the division into two distinct parts, and while conserving the scheme, it represents an effort to develop this type of architecture still further. Houses. As a result of excavation to clarify the urban system and the typology of the houses of Byllis, some public buildings in the area of the agora were also investigated. On the terrace between the stoa and the theatre were traces of a public amenity building, perhaps a prytaneion, of which the SE side was preserved. The monument is dated by a 3rd Ct BC coin of Apollonia of the Apollo-obelisk type, even though a cultural stratum of the 2nd Ct AD was deposited on its floor in the course of re-use of the W part. A series of walls of dwellings belonged to the 3rd Ct BC layer, whereas a group of complete houses are of the 5th-6th Ct AD. On the right side of the entrance to the agora excavation was undertaken of another public amenity building, of the mid-3rd Ct BC, rebuilt with modifications in the the 1st Ct AD. On one of the terraces to the W of the agora a peristyle house, No. 2, was discovered. Its construction began in the 2nd half of the 3rd Ct BC and it underwent modification, with the destruction of the peristyle, during the 3rd Ct AD, while in late antiquity it takes the form of an entirely new dwelling. To the W of this house there were traces of another public building, built in the 1st Ct AD and later re-used; in the 6th Ct it was abandoned, as attested by its use as a cemetery. Necropolis. Investigation of the E necropolis of the city revealed more graves of the 2nd half of the 4th Ct and some of the 3rd and 2nd Cts BC, while the graves discovered on the NW side of the town belong to late antiquity. In all, eight inscriptions were discovered, among which were found a new group of Latin or Latinized names. Circuit walls (excavation by S. Muca, 1989). In the W side of the circuit wall, four construction techniques were evident: (1) square blocks set without mortar (4th Ct BC, Byllis I); (2) blocks bonded by mortar (end-4th Ct AD, Byllis II); (3) stone bonded with abundant mortar (mid-4th Ct AD, Byllis III); and (4) re-used blocks bonded with clay (Byllis IV). During reconstruction of the wall of the second phase, a new</page><page sequence="12">82 Zh. ANDREA FIG. 20 gate of 'tangential' type was built (Fig. 20). Further excavation in ancient Byllis, was concerned with uncovering three ECh basilicas (B,C.D) (excavation by S. Muca, 1984-1990). Basilica B consisted of three aisles, an apse, narthex, exonarthex and atrium, and three structures on the S side, one of which was the baptistry, furnished with a central font in the form of a cross. Among mosaic floors that of the exonarthex was notable for its naturalistic rendering of two scenes of fishermen and shepherds, the latter similar to the mosaic in the basilica of Arapaj of the 5th-6th Ct AD. On the walls of the nave, transept and baptistry were traces of frescoes with geometric motifs and plants. A large number of architec- tonic elements were discovered, such as bases, cornices, columns, and capitals carved with plant and animal motifs. At the same time six Greek inscriptions were discovered, as well as 255 bronze coins of the 5th-6th Ct AD, mainly of the emperor Justinian, but also a number of other coins, mainly pentanoumn2ia, from Leo I to Justinian. Basilica C is three-aisled, consisting of nave, presbytery, narthex, exonarthex, two niches on the two parts of the narthex-one to the S of the exonarthex and the other on the SE of the S aisle. Of the mosaic floors, that of the narthex is best preserved and has a Greek inscription at its centre. Basilica D is also three-aisled and consists of nave, presbytery, narthex with two niches to N and S, an atrium with four porticoes and a simple propyleum. Of the mosaics the most complete is that of the narthex and its N niche, where the motifs are either decorative or with Christian content; there is very little ornamental sculpture. The basilica must have been constructed during the period of Justinian, for it had been abandoned as a church and used as a dwelling during the period 548-550 AD. BERAT DISTRICT Katundas Cave (excavation by M. Korkuti, 1986). An occupation layer with a surface area of 40m2, and a greatest thickness of 3.60m. was discovered in the part of the cave of Katundas most adapted for dwelling (Fig. 21). Three cultural periods were identified: (1) Neolithic: the last phase of EN was represented by 'impresso' pottery, barbotine and, to a lesser degree, by pottery painted with white on a red ground. The MN was characterized by black ware and grey and black ware with incised geometric motifs, of the Dunavec-Cakran type, and by some evidence of ritual. Typical of LN was painted ware with coffee-colour on a plain ground, of the Maliq- Kamnik type. (2) The whole of the Copper Age was repre- sented. The rich and various pottery, as well as having some local features, preserved on the whole the Eneolithique features of Maliq IIa &amp; IIb. (3) The BA was attested by finds of EBA and LBA. The cave was also inhabited in the IA, as shown by Devollian painted pottery and by late importations of Corin- thian and Ionian wares of the 4th-3rd Ct BC. It appears that in the 2nd-3rd Ct AD the dwelling site had a revival, although signs of life after this period are lacking. Katundas cemetery (excavated by K. Braka, 1986). In the level cemetery of Katundas. located on a hill about 375m above sea level, 12 graves of different types were uncovered, consisting of simple pits, graves surrounded by dry-stone walls, and cist graves. The burial custom was to place the remains on the back. Finds of clay dishes, ornaments, and iron knives dated the cemetery to the IA, between the 12-6th Cts BC. ('Une necropole de l'age du Fer dans le village de Katundas, district de Berat', 1liia 17, 2 (1987) 37-47.) Berat (excavation by K. Braka, 1987). Excavation in the fortress of Berat concentrated on the acropolis, with the aim of clarifying its period of construction. A paving block that belonged to the great cistern was discovered to the S of the acropolis, with a house on the faice of the circuit wall, and the wall of a dwelling (Fig. 22). No-clear statigraphy was established because construction had caused the mixing of levels; nevertheless, it seems that the fortress belongs to the 15th-16th Ct AD period of the Turkish occupation. It was found that the church in the cave of Sinje (between Berat and Ballsh) was dedicated to the Dormition of the Virgin, from the remains of painting found on the rock next to the altar. The paintings of the cave belong to three phases of different periods, of which the first two are Byzantine. An inscription gives the date 1292 for the second layer (Fig. 23) and constitutes important data for the study of the painting and the history of the surrounding area. SKRAPAR DISTRICT Vlushe (excavation by L. Ylli, 1980). Excavation in the settlement area of Vlushe was undertaken to verify the stratigraphy of 1980, concentrating on Armenin and Vidhez, areas already known. Finds in the cultural layer of Armenin included fragments of rather primitive pottery and flint tools, such as geometric microliths with finely retouched blades which belong to a tradition older than the late mesolithic. The stratigraphical position of the finds in this EN layer was more clearly established, representing the oldest N period in Albania. In the cultural deposits of Vidhez were found only flint tools, such as scrapers and knife-blades etc., with fine retouch- ing. The absence of pottery in this zone makes it possible to place at Vidhez a mesolithic cultural horizon which must be the first in Albania.</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA 1984-90 83 FIG. 21 Selan (excavation by L. Ylli, 1987). Following earlier surface sondage, systematic excavation was undertaken in the prehistoric area of Selan to determine stratigraphy and chrono- logy. The remains of a floor were found, covered with fired clay and, in parts, with pummice. Notable among the finds was the large number of working tools of various materials, including flint arrowheads, pummice stones with fine retouch- ing, stone axes and hammers, bone scrapers, gravers and polishers. The pottery had the same features at all depths of the cultural stratum and in form and technique much resembled that of the oldest phases of the LBA of Maliq (Maliq IIId). On the basis of these analogies the settlement of Selan may be placed in the same period. Kug (excavation by L. Ylli, 1989). A rescue excavation concentrated on an Illyrian cemetery of the 3rd Ct BC. Sixteen graves were opened, some simple pits, others cist-graves built of stones bonded with clay or stone slabs; rarely bonded stone and slabs were used at the same time. All the graves had contents, including vessels of bronze and clay, among them amphoras, dishes, cups, storage vessels, bowls, spoons etc. Attention is drawn by certain new forms of clay vessels, produced by the Illyrian peasant population of this area. The cemetery of Kuc was in use until the 5th-6th Ct AD. Skrapar (excavated by N. Cuni, 1987-1990). The fortress of Skrapar is built on a hill 721m above sea level. The aim of excavations over four years here was to explore the fortifica- tion system and its spread, and at the same time to clarify the stratigraphy of the settlement. A considerable part of the circuit wall of the fortress was uncovered; it was built of stone and thick mortar, mixed with small stones. Also found were the entrance to the fortress and the cistern. Typical elements of the fortification system were the towers, which were of different dimensions. Four similar ones were brought to light, FIG. 22</page><page sequence="14">84 Zh. ANDREA TlaPi- Jcf HePorloIlohN C? e G ,K' ,I cG@E aIYf/cG -o 7r}X (/ c4 I". ^ly ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~0- of comparison with the LN pottery of Barc and Maliq I- Kamnik, the culture of Dersnik is placed in the earliest phase of LN in the Korce basin. The pottery of this settlement also included several elements typical of MN, such as ritual ryhtons, barbotine decoration, vessels with raised feet, etc, which testify to the indigenous genesis of the LN in SE Albania. Maliq (excavation by F. Prendi, Zh. Andrea and P. Lera, 1988-1990; see also AR 1983-84, 114). After an interruption of 14 years, investigation was restarted in the prehistoric settlement of Maliq (Fig. 24). Priority was given to investiga- tion of the late BA culture, to verify the chronology and stratigraphy of Devollian painted pottery. The excavation yielded a stratigraphy in which three linked cultural strata were distinguished. The oldest is MBA, known as Maliq IIIc, while the other two are LBA (Maliq IIId, and IIId2), among which the latter is characterized by painted pottery of Devollian type (Fig. 25). Earlier opinion on the date of the painted pottery has been revised and it now seems difficult to place it before the end-13th/beginning-12th Ct BC, a period which marks the first appearance of painted Devollian 9 FIG. 23 permitting determination of the whole plan, which was trapezoidal, with towers 2 and 3 and some dwellings within the circuit wall. Particular atention was given to stratigraphy, in which four cultural strata were distinguished: Illyrian antiquity (5th-6th Ct BC); late antiquity (to which the construction of the fortress belongs); later Med (12th-14th Cts); Med after the 15th Ct. Sondage was undertaken to locate tombs alongside the fortress; a cist-grave was found, made of stone slabs and containing objects of the 3rd-2nd Ct BC. KORCE DISTRICT Dersnik (excavation by P. Lera, 1984). In the LN settlement of Dersnik, to the SE of the plain of Korqe, the cultural layer comprises two habitation horizons, belonging to the same period. Two groups of pottery were found, principally ware of light colours, decorated with painting, and also pottery with a black surface, with incised and applied decoration. On the basis FIG. 24 FIG. 25</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA 1984-90 85 ware in SE Albania. These excavations also produced new stratigraphical findings, namely the identification for the first time in this settlement of a cultural stratum of the beginning of the IA, with pottery of Maliq IIId type. Thus the latter belongs to the beginning of the IA and not the end of the EBA, as had previously been thought. The finds indicate that this settlement was inhabited during the whole IA. Sovjan (excavation by P. Lera, 1988, 1990). Sondage undertaken in 1988 in the prehistoric area of Sovjan were followed up in 1990 by systematic excavation. This began by determining the topographical spread of the settlement, which occupied an area of 2.5ha. The excavations revealed an occupation layer 2.40m thick, in which four habitation horizons were present. The three oldest belonged to a settlement built on piles, while the fourth was built directly on the earth. Rich archaeological material was present, including fragments of pottery, terracottas, beams, animal bones and, to a lesser degree, working tools. The pottery was that of the EBA of Maliq, known as Maliq IIId, but in the development of this culture two phases were distinguished. Painted Devollian pottery was lacking in the earliest phase, which, on the basis of Mycenaean imports, is dated no later than the 14th Ct BC. In the second phase most pottery was decorated with painting in the Devollian style, in brown, red and unstable vermillion. The phase is attributed, again on the basis of Mycenaean imports, to the 13th Ct BC. Drenove (excavation by P. Lera 1987). In the open settlement of Drenove, at the foot of Mt. St. Constantine, an cultural layer 1.1-1.6m thick was discovered, in which two habitation horizons were determined. The archaeological material gathered consisted chiefly of local hand-built pottery, of good and average quality, with unglazed painting, in the Devollian style. On the basis of imported pottery of the late geometric period worked with a hammer, the occupation level of Drenove dates to the end of the 8th Ct BC. Mixed with this pottery were fragments typologically consistent with the end- BA/beginning-IA. This mixing must have been caused by the great depth of terrain at this settlement site. Shuec (excavation by Zh. Andrea, 1990). The tumulus of Shuec, at the edge of little Prespa, was built of earth and covered by a layer of broken stones. Also found were traces of a stone-paved road, which links the first tumulus to the second. During excavation 66 graves were discovered, either with pits or enclosed by stones, with the remains of burials. On the basis of finds of pottery, weapons and ornaments, the tumulus belongs to the IA, especially to the 6th-5th Ct BC. Ensuing excavation clarified the architecture and the period of construction of the tumulus. Zaradishte (excavated by P. Damko, 1986-89). Four years of excavation in the fortress of Zaradishte, to the W of the town of Korce have demonstrated that this settlement had two phases of habitation. The first was in the 3rd-4th Cts AD, when the settlement was unfortified, and the second in the 5th- 6th Ct AD, when it was enclosed by walls and the main construction undertaken. The walls are built of unworked stone and limestone mortar mixed with slabs; they had a perimeter of about lkm, and enclosed an area of 3.5ha. Work concentrated on the complete uncovering of a 5th-6th Ct ECh basilica of three aisles. The baptistry, with font, and the narthex were found in two flanking areas (Fig. 26). Also found were fragments of capitals, impost-capitals, column- drums, pottery and two coins of Justin I. Work was also done to uncover the aqueduct, built in two tiers of walls and covered in stone slabs. Close to the wall was found a dwelling of the 5-6th Ct AD. FIG. 26 Kakag (excavation by P. Damko, 1990). At the fortress of Kakac, to the NE of the town of Korce, the circuit wall was cleaned for a length of 300m and width of 1.80m; the wall enclosed an area of .7 ha, of approximately oval shape and was built of stones bonded by a weak limestone mortar, mixed with pebbles. At the same time two square towers were found, one of them outside the circuit wall, the other inside the area of the fortress. The fortress of Kakac was probably built in the 6th Ct AD, but life there continued into the first centuries of the EMed period. Boboshtice (excavation by Dh. Dhamo, 1989). The churches of St. Demetrius and St. John, near the village of Boboshtice in Korce were investigated. These are very simple, each with a single nave and an entrance on the W side, covered by a pitched roof. Study of wall painting made it clear that the church of St. Demetrius was the older and must have been built towards the end of the 14th Ct. The oldest paintings were Byz, the later ones post-Byz. The church of St. John retained only traces of old painting, while the rest was of the first post-Byz period (16th-17th Cts). VLORE DISTRICT Phoinike (excavation by Dh. Condi, 1989-1990). After an interruption of several years, excavation was started again in the ancient city of Phoinike (Finiq, Phoenice, the capital of Epiros and Chaonia; see also AR 1983-84, 118). Excavation was directed principally to the clarification of the plan of the first circuit wall, which enclosed the upper part of the hill of Finiq and which must have been built at the beginning of the 3rd Ct BC. It was followed for 100m and the front entrance of the fortification system was discovered. Inside this system was a dwelling that had two phases of construction: the first, of 3rd-2nd Cts BC, was a peristyle house, with two central courts, where columns of both cylindrical and octagonal form were discovered in situ. This dwelling abutted a terrace wall in which its entrance was found. Of particular interest among the finds were eight bronze coins put into circulation by the Epirote League and dating from 234-167 BC. In the course of the 2nd phase (lst-2nd Cts AD) the house underwent trans- formations of its architectural scheme rather than of its function, and by the 3rd-4th Ct AD it seems that it no longer existed. During the excavation an altar of the 4th-3rd Ct was discovered and also three tombs of the 3rd Ct BC.</page><page sequence="16">86 Zh. ANDREA Amantia (excavation by V. Bereti, 1988-89). In the ancient town of Amantia, the object of two years' investigation was the necropolis of the W side, which spread over the flanks of three hills. During the campaign of 1988 on the site known as the mountain pass, 39 graves were discovered, two of them simple pits, the others surrounded by monumental coverings of angular or ellipsoid plans. They were without grave goods and may have been part of the EMed necropolis. To their SE a monu- mental tomb was found, partly damaged and consisting of three chambers and two antechambers covered by a circle of stones, and dating to the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC. Nearby there were 16 cist graves, five of which had apparently been opened at an earlier time. All belonged, according to their inventory, to the 4th-3rd Cts BC. In 1990 work in a new area of the W necropolis opened 26 graves built and covered with ellipsoidal slabs of pummice, containing inhumations or cremations either inside or outside the grave, of the 4th-beginning 3rd Ct BC. Triport (excavation by V. Bereti, 1984-86; see also AR 1983-84, 116). Work in the Illyrian fortified settlement of Triport traced the continuation of the circuit wall of the pre- urban phase, alongside which were discovered settlement areas of the end-7th to 4th Cts BC, as well as the second circuit wall. Traces were revealed of a monumental tomb that had been re-used as a water tank in the 1st Ct AD. Study of a section of the wall found in the sea identified two towers, and thus clarified its function as part of the circuit wall of the developed urban site, as well as the location of the centre of the settlement at the edge of the sea. Stratigraphy showed three cultural layers in the settlement: the first from the end-7th to beginning-5th Ct BC; the second 5th Ct-beginning 4th Ct BC and the third after the 3rd Ct AD. Orik (excavation by L. Kumi, 1989). Sondage undertaken in the antique necropolis of Oricum, to the SW of the town itself, revealed three Hellenistic brick tombs of two types, roofed or chest-type. Objects found belonged to the 3rd-2nd Ct BC. Among terracottas of Aphrodite and Athena, apparent- ly of local production, that in Tomb 2 was of interest since the drapery and head covering of the figure were very similar to garments worn by the present-day inhabitants of this region. Olympia (excavation by B. Dautaj, 1990). Rescue excava- tion was undertaken in the necropolis of the town of Olympia, situated in the fortress of Mavrove in the district of Vlore. Twenty-two tombs were found, built and filled with monolithic limestone stelae, in cist form, covered with layers of pummice. The burial rite was inhumation. Among finds were hydras and rf pelikes, terracottas, bronze ornaments and some 3rd Ct BC bronze coins of Macedonia, Epiros, Corcyra and Apollonia. The rf pottery has points of resemblance with that of Magna Graecia, belonging to the last phase of Apulian and Campanian rf pottery of the end of the 4th Ct BC. Rexhepaj (excavated by I. Cano, 1984). In the village of Rexhepaj, to the E of Vlore, in a site where antique remains have been known for a long time, the rectangular plan of a bath was found. The passage across it turns to the left, where were found the apodyterium, firigidarium and tepidarium, the last having two sections, where the walls of a bath were preserved. Another important area was that of the furnace and the square cistern, to the W the bath. The discovery of this public amenity building in a region crossed by the route from Byllis to Amantia perhaps indicates that the site was an ancient stopping-place. Vlore (excavation by D. Komata, 1986-1989). The point of departure for four years of excavation in the town of Vlore was the sondage of 1985, undertaken in the centre of the town, FIG. 27 where the ruins of a wall were discovered. During the last phase of work it was ascertained that the circuit walls, of the castrum type, equipped with towers and entrances, enclosed an area of irregular plan of ca 9.5ha. The excavation established that life in this settlement began at the end of the 3rd Ct BC and continued during late antiquity and the middle ages. The circuit wall, built in the 4th Ct AD, and re-fortified and strengthened in the same period, had been in use throughout the existence of the settlement. Inside the circuit walls were discovered traces of the walls of houses, and also a well. The excavation yielded rich archaeological material, including pottery and architectonic elements such as columns, window fittings, column bases and fragments of columns, etc. (Fig. 27). PERMET DISTRICT Rapcke and Grabove (excavated by N. Bodinaku, 1984). Sondage in the region of the villages of Rapcke and Grabove aimed at establishing the extent of the Med cemetery and extending knowledge of the Med cultures discovered between 1978-79 in the tumuli of this area. Excavation of a limited area of the level cemetery of Rapcke permitted the discovery of six cist graves with W-E orientation and burials in the extended position. Finds included rings and circlets of bronze wire. Sondage done at Grabove brought to light a Med. cemetery where 38 graves were opened, their contents includ- ing circlets of ear-rings in glass and bronze, rings, beads of coloured glass, ear-rings in the form of grapes, etc. Anthropo- logical study distinguished two periods of burial, the first in the 9th Ct and the second in the 9th-1 lth Cts AD. KOLONJE DISTRICT Luaras (excavation by S. Aliu, 1988-89). Among the 15 tumuli located in the hill village of Luaras, the one chosen for excavation was that closest to the prehistoric settlement of the same name, excavated 1981-82, in order to elucidate connec- tions with the culture represented there. Construction of the tumulus began in the late BA, above a single tomb, surrounded and covered by a wall of stones in the form of an ellipse, and finished at the beginning of the IA, when the surface was covered by a layer of limestone (Fig. 28). Graves of the 8th-7th Ct and the 6th-5th Cts BC testify that the site had also been used as a settlement later on. The</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA 1984-90 87 tumulus had a height of 3.20m and diameter of 30m, covering 203 graves in simple groups, or partly surrounded and covered by stones; inhumations and occasional cremations were also partly surrounded and covered by stones. The graves yielded rich finds, including 130 clay vessels and many fragments of pottery, 350 ornaments of various sorts and weapons of bronze and iron. The tumulus belonged to the Illyrian culture of the BA and IA of the Korce basin, albeit incorporating local peculiarities. GJIROKASTER DISTRICT Antigonea (excavation by Dh. Budina, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1989; see also AR 1983-84, 118). Continuing excavation in ancient Antigonea, an important town of Chaonia, in Epiros, gave particular attention to the urban system, which is more evident here than in the other towns of Epiros. Excavations concentrated on the complex of structures at the centre of the town (Fig. 29), where were discovered an entire workshop for the minting of coins (3rd-2nd Cts BC) as well as a peristyle house of the same period (Fig. 30). This was of rectangular plan with three alcoves and a passage. In the N part of the town another peristyle house was found, with a central court embellished by 12 columns and floors covered in mosaic of white limestone, resembling the mosaic of Cassope, dating to the 3rd Ct BC. Around the courtyard was a roofed ambulatory while on the E side of the house there was a paved interior area with roofed shelter. The 3rd-2nd Ct BC promenade of the town was also found, with parallel stone walls decorated with Doric columns. Two main roads with flanking pavements were also found, covered, like the whole route, in paving stones. These discoveries indicated that Antigonea had a regular orthogonal plan, with rectangular insulae, some of which comprised three storeys of houses, as at Cassope, Ammotopos and Ambracia. Also discovered was a Med single-naved church, with nave and pronaos, as well as the cemetery around it, containing 13 graves with inventories similar to those of the 9th-Il th Ct AD cemtetery of Piskove. Pepel (excavation by V. Qirjaqi, 1989). The fortress of Pepel is located in the Dropull region near to the village of the same name. Excavation determined the complete plan, in the form of an ellipse, with walls of unworked stone, enclosing an area of c. 31ha, two towers and an entrance, all of poor construction. This constitutes one of the oldest fortifications of the Drino valley, belonging to the end of the 7th Ct BC. The absence of a cultural layer inside the fortification suggests that it was inhabited on a temporary basis. Labove (excavation by V. Qirjaqi, 1990). The fortress of Labove, on Mt. Buretos, occupies an area of 0.78ha and is enclosed by walls on N and E sides, divided by an entrance, while the W and S sides are not fortified. Sondage was undertaken to complete the plan of the fortress and gather in- formation on the date of the circuit walls, given that this is a point of controversy. The construction technique of the walls and analysis of finds suggests that the fortress had two phases of construction. The first, to which the E wall belongs, is tentatively assigned to the end of the pre-urban period, while the second is of the 3rd-2nd Cts BC (Fig. 31). SARANDE DISTRICT Konispol (excavated by M. Korkuti and H. Shabani, 1989-90). The cave of Konispol (Fig. 32) is on Mt Sarakinoros, at a height of c. 400m above sea level, in the southernmost region of Albania, the archaeology of which is little known. Excava- tion over two years revealed a relatively broad cultural layer, varying in thickness from 2.8m to 3.6m. On the basis of stratigraphy and finds, the principal periods distinguised were: MN, LN, Eneolithic, BA, IA, urban and Med, showing that the FIG. 30 FIG. 28 FIG. 29</page><page sequence="18">88 Zh. ANDREA FIG. 31 cave has served as a settlement for a very long period. Borsh (excavation by J. Koci, 1986, 1990; see also AR 1983-84, 118). Work on the antique fortress of Borsh, used from the end of the BA to the Med period, continued that of 1976 and 1980. Inside the fortress was found the whole of a square-plan antique house on two floors, of the 3rd-lst Ct BC. Here were found also coins of Epiros and Phoenice, struck in the 3rd-2nd Cts BC. Stratigraphical work established the following periods of habitation: LBA; 5th-4th Cts BC; lst-3rd Cts AD and 14th-15th Cts AD. Understanding of the architecture and general appearance of the open settlement areas near the antique town of Borsh was helped by excavation undertaken in 1990 on the plain of Borsh, where a rectangular-plan fortified dwelling of the 3rd Ct BC was discovered. Beside it was another building of which only the plan was determined. Dober (excavated by Dh. (Condi, 1986). Near the village of Dober a fortified dwelling of villa type was excavated. Three periods of construction were evident: (1) in the 3rd Ct BC, the villa had a courtyard and a square enclosing wall; pottery and coins of the 3rd-2nd Cts BC were found. (2) between the 1st Ct BC and the 2nd Ct AD the villa was consolidated with new walls, and enlarged by the building of new rooms which modified the plan; associated pottery belonged to a period from the 1st Ct BC to the 2nd Ct AD. A few finds of late antiquity attested the habitation of the town during during this period also. (3) In the 7th-10th Ct AD the villa lost its former importance and function and a church of rectangular plan was built on the SE side of the court. Butrint (see also AR 1983-84, 117-18). Excavation in the ancient town of Butrint (Buthrotum) is of particular interest because occupation here continued without interruption from antiquity until the middle ages. Work concentrated on the acropolis, the gymnasium, the S part of the town and a roman building. The acropolis (excavated by A. Nanaj, 1986). Inside the circuit wall occupation periods in the 7th, 6th and 5th Cts BC were established. In the 7th Ct BC layer the pottery was rich, consisting of plates of local production and Corinthian imports. In the 2nd half of the 6th Ct BC, Butrint was a typical pre-urban dwelling site. In this layer, alongside the local pottery there was also imported ware such as Ionian cups of type B2, Attic cups imitating the kotylai of Corinth. Among them was a cup inscribed APMANONAA and the lip of another inscribed AAXMA. In the 2nd half of the 6th Ct BC Ionian and Corinthian imports diminished notably, their place taken by products from Attica. FIG. 32 FIG. 33 Gymnasium (excavation by Dh. (ondi, 1989). Work concentrated on the NW area of the gymnasium. Three rooms came to light, built with walls of opus mixtum, one of which was covered with mosaic, just like that of the part of the road which passes near it (Fig. 33). During the 1 st-3rd Cts AD, the three rooms served for the physical preparations in the gym- nasium. In the 4th-6th Ct they constituted a separate complex, while in the 9th-14th Cts the complex of rooms was aban- doned; the road went out of use at the same time. The roman house (excavated by Dh. Condi, 1990). Following excavation carried out in 1982, a house built in the 1st Ct AD was uncovered, with three rooms, one of which had a niche for installing a sculpture. This house was still inhabited in late antiquity but abandoned during the middle ages. South side of the town (excavation by K. Lako, 1990). A complex of large buildings was discovered which had at its centre a triconch with three apses, as well as other areas. A long period of use was evident, from the 5th/6th Ct until 10/11Ct AD.
