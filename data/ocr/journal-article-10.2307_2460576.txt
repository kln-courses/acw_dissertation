<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vol. 117, No. 6 The American Naturalist June 1981 NOTES AND COMMENTS THE CYBERNETIC NATURE OF ECOSYSTEMS In a recent paper Engelberg and Boyarsky (1979) argued that ecosystems are not cybernetic systems. The principal logical element of their argument was an analogy between physiological feedback mechanisms and proposed feedback mechanisms at the ecosystem level. Specifically, they argued that ecosystems must have information networks resembling neural pathways or hormonal sys- tems if they are truly cybernetic. As is often the case when scientists extend arguments from their own field of specialization into broad generalizations about another, this argument fails to see the trees for the forest. This can be a construc- tive process because it highlights issues and forces us, however reluctantly, to reexamine our thinking. We begin with a brief background of cybernetics, and a clarification of terms. We then describe one example of an information network of low energy causes and high energy effects and, for the sake of brevity, refer readers to an abundant literature replete with evidence that such signals are major organizers of ecosys- tems. Finally, we address some of the deeper-seated issues involved in the argument that ecosystems are cybernetic, and point out the serious implications to man and the biosphere of the misconception that ecosystems are noncybernetic. We reiterate the definition of cybernetic originally given by Wiener (1948) as the "science of control and communication." A flow of information is inherent in any control process. Cybernetics assumes that the laws governing control are generally applicable to both man and machine, organic and inorganic. More generally, cybernetics is a paradigm for coordination, relation, regulation, com- munication, and control in any organized system. In addition, the validity of cybernetic generalizations is not conditional on their being derived from some other branch of science (Ashby 1956). For completeness, we must include here the well-established definition of an ecosystem. An ecosystem consists of living organisms in some abiotic environ- ment. What makes it a system is the fact that there exist specific dynamic relationships between these constituents. What makes it cybernetic is the exis- tence of coordination, regulation, communication, and control in these relation- ships. The system we employ for example involves the Western pine beetle (Den- droctonus brevicomis) and its host, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), a tree abundant in ecosystems occupying thousands of square kilometers in western Am.

A description of the information mapping follows (Silverstein et al. 1968; Wood and Silverstein 1970; Wood 1973): (1) Ponderosa bark contains oleoresin from which terpenes, low-energy signals, are volatilized. (2) Female bark beetles are attracted by these terpenes and begin to feed. This is the beginning of a high-energy output of the type Engelberg and Boyarsky characterized as a brute exchange of matter and energy. They specifically referred to this type of effect as informationally nonspecific, therefore noncybernetic, in ecosystems. (3) Once established, the females secrete a pheromone containing three compounds that functions as a male attractant. One component, myrcene, is sequestered from the food supply and two others, frontalin and exobrevicomin, are synthesized de novo. (4) Sex ratio of the growing beetle population is controlled by the proportion of frontalin secreted by the females. (5) When beetle population density becomes very high, females secrete a male repellent, verbenone, formed from one of the major bark terpenes, ae-pinene, by a two-step oxidation. This type of nonsignal! signal transduction, unmentioned by Engelberg and Boyarsky, is a common way for cybernetic systems to turn into meaning what would be merely noise from one part of the system to another. Further, (6) this network is characterized by another common attribute of information flow in cybernetic systems they overlooked, synergism, or using other terminology, amplification. Addition of the dietary component from the bark, myrcene, doubles the effectiveness of the male attrac- tant. Finally, (7) signal specificity, another important property of cybernetic systems unmentioned by Engelberg and Boyarsky, is demonstrated since linonene, structurally very similar to myrcene, is ineffective. This example is typical, not unusual, and such patterns are integral components of ecosystems. Apart from the ecosystem, they have no cybernetic meaning. At several levels, this is a sequence of cause and effect that closes upon itself, and hence constitutes a feedback loop. In addition there is a high energy output of global importance in the ecosystem, since beetle-induced mortality of trees damps the flow of matter and energy through the tree-beetle system, sometimes over hundreds of square kilometers. So, it now seems that this is a self-destructive rather than a self-regulating system. Not at all-total system integrity may be dependent upon just such feedback systems (Mattson and Addy 1975). Moreover, these feedbacks maintain ecosystem integrity by moving matter that is abundant in one location, the trees, into another location where it is in short supply, the soil, an attribute of cybernetic systems that Engelberg and Boyarsky said had never been described in ecosystems. This has nothing to do with ecosystems as superor- ganisms; they are, rather, truly cybernetic. It is impossible, in the context of this comment, to map the global nature of this single system. But note that it includes not just beetle and tree but also atmosphere, soil, beetle predators, tree compet- itors, and many other elements contributing to flows of information, energy, and matter. The beetles, chemicals, and trees are not cybernetic in and of themselves. Only the ecosystem of which they are a part is. Have we merely selected an isolated example for rhetorical purposes? The tremendous, high-energy consequences of such trophic level interactions have been documented in the fossil record dating back to the Precambrian (Garrett 1970; Awramik 1971), and the role of low-energy signals as modulators is an</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND COMMENTS 987 ecological commonplace involving organisms as different as protozoa and their prey and insects and their host plants (Sondheimer and Simeone 1970; Levin 1976; Harborne 1977). Engelberg and Boyarsky seem to imply that because the low resolution diagrams of food webs and chemical cycles in introductory ecology textbooks include only flows of brute matter and energy, that this is all that flows in ecosystems. But practicing ecologists explicitly recognize that every such flow of brute matter and energy is regulated and controlled by numerous detailed mechanisms. Ecosystems are permeated by information flows and these flows are of primary importance to flows of matter and energy, since these are simply a manifestation of the information flows. In cybernetic systems, matter and energy may pass freely into and out of the system, as long as information pathways and control mechanisms remain within the system. Cybernetic systems are closed to informa- tion, but are open to matter and energy (Ashby 1956). Single organisms or populations are not closed to information. Animals communicate through every sensory channel we are aware of, and possibly more. They see, hear, smell, taste, and feel one another and their environment. Plants do not perceive through sensory channels as do animals, yet in quite mechanistic ways a plant is aware of its biotic and abiotic environment. Every manner of ecological interaction, competition, mutualism, parasitism, pre- dation, commensalism, involves information. Ordered relationships such as these can only be maintained through regulation and control, and control implies infor- mation. If information is involved in any pair-wise ecological interaction, then the whole ecosystem is cybernetic. Engelberg and Boyarsky admit that predator-prey in- teractions are cybernetic. If that is so, then any food web is a cybernetic system, simply because any two species in the web may be linked via one or more cybernetic relationships. All organisms are inevitably linked to one another through the decomposition process. If organisms do not recycle the resources they have borrowed, the system will run down-a negative feedback which links all life processes. A single organism is not a cybernetic system as Engelberg and Boyarsky maintained. The cells and organs act together for a common goal, mediated by a common information network. However, the goal of an organism is not merely to coordinate the activities of its cells and organs, but to preserve (proximally) and perpetuate (ultimately) itself. This goal makes sense only in the context of the environment. The organism and its subsystems are only an adaptation to the envi- ronment. Since information must flow between the environment and the orga- nism, the organism is not closed to information, and hence it is not a true cybernetic system. The organism is but a part of a truly cybernetic organism- environment system, an ecosystem. The central argument of Engelberg and Boyarsky is that ecosystems are a collection of cybernetic systems, but not an ensemble of such systems and, therefore, cybernetic themselves. Cybernetic systems have three essential properties (Wiener 1948; Ashby 1956). First, they are open to energy and, often, matter, but are closed to information and control. Second, information consists of</page><page sequence="4">988 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST facts that are communicated and received, but the facts take on meaning only in a certain context. Thus, third, the basic building block of a cybernetic system is a feedback loop that regulates the transformation of matter or energy because the regulator has access to information concerning the state of the system. A bacterial population whose density in a chemostat is regulated by a turbidometer is cybernetic only between the time someone sets the turbidometer and the time that someone decides the supply vessel must be replenished. Organisms, industrial organizations, and human societies are not cybernetic, but they form components of ecosystems that are cybernetic. We are not embarrassed to acknowledge that ecologists have not yet mapped the global information network for a single natural ecosystem. However, we know of no cell, single organism, industrial plant, or human society for which such a map has been completed. Cancer, bankruptcy, and uncontrollable social disorder are all manifestations of the incomplete under- standing of information networks within systems that Engelberg and Boyarsky unaccountably characterized as cybernetic. We are understandably anthropomorphic when we think of information. We use the analogies of nerve impulses and hormone flows because we can relate to them. Information, however, can be transmitted through quite simple physical relation- ships. For example, when you remove the crankshaft from an engine, it fails to function as a cybernetic system. The rest of the engine gathers information from the crankshaft, or the lack of a crankshaft, quite noncognitively. An example was given by Engelberg and Boyarsky of a boy and a steam engine. The boy carries the information which coordinates the parts of the engine. Today we have engines that have no boys. The mechanical replacement in fact requires less energy than the boy, yet it performs the same task. That mechanism has no neural network, yet it conveys (the same) information. The information arises out of the ordered rela- tions between the parts. A concept that is relevant here is the idea of signature (Quastler 1964). Every process involves some form of interaction between entities, in fact a transmission of information. Only a fraction of the features of an entity takes part in the interaction, that which Quastler calls the signature. A symbol, he notes, is but a signature of the information in a real event, by virtue of some code. A signature, therefore, implies the direct presence of the entity. This concept is an effective model for the transmission of information between parts of an ecosystem by overt physical interactions. All that is necessary is an ordered pattern that can be recognized upon its conveyance to the recipient of the information. Margalef (1961, 1968) has been an articulate advocate of the cybernetic nature of ecosystems. He points out that it is the present state of the system which sets limits or patterns for future states, and hence the present state is in fact a bearer of information. A fundamental idea in system theory is that it is only the present state of the system which conveys information, and for this reason the system state is a summary of the entire history of the system (Forrester 1961, 1968). Engelberg and Boyarsky characterized industrial organizations, economic sys- tems, and automated industrial plants as cybernetic, but classified ecosystems and the biopshere as noncybernetic. They went beyond that in proposing that ecosys- tems can be made cybernetic only with the imposition of human organization. This</page><page sequence="5">NOTES AND COMMENTS 989 is a serious flaw of perception and logic that is potentially devastating to human beings, indeed all life, if it were ever to become a common belief. Ecosystems and the biosphere are much more clearly cybernetic than any human organization. Ecosystems are relational systems with many feedback loops that are living history of the previous state of the ecosystem by virtue of their self-propagation and evolution over eons of time. They are testimony not only to the existence of controlled organization, but to a degree of organization humans are presently incapable of designing. Ecologists yet perceive the goals and feedback loops dimly, but perhaps more clearly than many business managers, economists, and engineers. Ampere coined the word, cybernetics, from kubernetes, Greek for governor or steersman, derived in turn from kuberman, to guide, steer, or govern. Wiener concentrated on information flows because such flows are essential to maintaining or modifying system course. We make no claim that ecologists yet understand either the network of information flows in ecosystems or the course that such flows, shaped by evolution, impose on those ecosystems. However, we can think of no ecosystem that has self-destructed, while the pages of daily newspapers as well as history books are strewn with examples of industrial organizations, economic systems, and industrial processes that are failing and have failed to function according to their explicit or implicit designs. No, ecosys- tems are not organisms or computers, but they are more clearly cybernetic than any human-designed system; rather like the automated steam engine, they surely do not require the boy to operate properly.
