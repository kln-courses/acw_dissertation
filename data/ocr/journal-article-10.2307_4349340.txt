GOLDBERG INTRODUCTION There is so much that is taken for granted in philological and linguistic tradition, so many formulae afloat that need mooring or sinking that even the novice can render acceptable service. B. L. Gildersleeve, A JP 29 (1908) 113 The following survey begins with a guide to Terence that emphasizes the scholarship since 1959, though it also includes teaching commentaries, English translations, and certain earlier works commanding special attention. Well- known handbooks such as George Duckworth's invaluable The Nature of Ro- man Comedy (Princeton 1952) are not evaluated, nor are such recent works for the general reader as E. Lef6vre's beautifully illustrated article "Die romische Kom6die" in M. Fuhrmann (ed.), Neues Handbuch der Literaturwissenschaft, v. 3 (Frankfurt 1974) 33-62. It will become clear in the course of this survey that the study of Terence is now at a crisis. Symptoms of this crisis are the lack of any reliable book on Ter- ence in English and the fact that the writing on individual plays is often predict- able, aimless, or inaccurate. The roots, the assumptions, and the goals of mod- ern scholarship must be identified and evaluated in the light of modern aesthetic sensibilities, increased technical knowledge, and the rediscovery of a substantial body of original Greek New Comedy. The traditional reliance on the Terentian commentary of Aelius Donatus also needs examination. Many ideas and prob- lems in contemporary scholarship on Terence have their roots in this commen- tary, and recent challenges to the accepted text and to the accepted understand- ing of that text require consideration of its contribution to our knowledge. The problem of evaluating Terence, however, is really only part of a larger problem involving the aims, methods, and artistry of drama in Republican Rome. To understand what Terence was doing we must look not only at his Greek predecessors, but also at his Roman colleagues. A survey of Plautus has already appeared in CW 74 (1981) 353-433. New editions and new studies of the lesser known writers of palliatae now appear with some frequency and are begin- ning to alter our view of Roman comedy as a literary form. The fabula togata has also been the subject of recent work and is of interest not only for its own sake, but for the light it sheds on the parameters of Roman creativity. Beyond the intrinsic appeal of Roman comedy itself lies the larger question of its im- mense influence on later Western drama. To facilitate the research and teaching of Latin texts must be the primary aim of this survey, but to arouse and encour- age interest in this greater issue is its ulterior motive.

MARTI (3) is an exemplary Lustrum article, thorough in its bibliography and astute in its judgments. Skillful organ- ization brings order to a vast array of material and provides the reader not only with ready access to the textual and literary scholarship on each play, but pro- vides succinct and reliable guides to such thorny issues as contaminatio and chronology. The contribution of GAISER (2) goes beyond bibliography, especially for American scholars. Controversy over the techniques and values of the German analytic method once raged so hotly that we do well to remember that its practitioners continue to make important contributions. Gaiser reviews the issues and the results of German scholarship on Plautus and Terence. He is sensible and fair in his judgments. He makes only passing reference to work in other languages-not out of ignorance, but because it rarely addresses quite the scholarly problem that he sees. His own critical assumptions are worth pointing out, for they are widespread and influential. First is an implicit emphasis on Plautus. The problem of originality as Gaiser sets it up is a Plautine problem that demands discussion of metrical variation, the expansion of scenes, the handling of Greek and Roman allusions, and the like. The organization of the biblio- graphy reflects this critical perspective, and because Terence does not always fit these categories, his individuality is obscured. Second, as the subtitle indicates, Gaiser believes that we cannot discuss the originality of Plautus and Terence without first distinguishing as best we can between what they have taken directly from their models and what they have altered. They must be discussed in terms of their originals. Where this assumption has led and whether it must still be our guide are questions we shall later want to address. ARNOTT (I) presents brief but thorough summaries of the scholarly problems and results of work on his three authors. The discussion is descriptive rather than critical, treating each au- thor separately with accurate, clear, and authoritative essays. There is a basic se- lective bibliography that emphasizes work in English without slighting the con- tribution of work in other languages. Because Arnott does not impose the same detailed organization on both Plautus and Terence, he perhaps serves Terence a little better than Gaiser does. II. COMMENTARIES AND TRANSLATIONS 4. Ashmore, S.

ASHMORE (4) remains the only compact guide to the Terentian corpus. The introduction is dated but still helpful, and the commentary emphasizes the gram- matical needs of students. Though currently out of print, it is worth seeking out for small classes. The Andria of SHIPP (5) provides a good grammatical guide but slights the dramatic side of Terence. The introduction contains useful infor- mation on Roman production techniques; the recent discoveries on papyrus make the long section on New Comedy obsolete. The edition of Phormio by MART1N (6) is workmanlike and reliable. CARNEY (7) is a student guide to Hecyra that includes a commentary on the Suetonian Vita. The introduction is sometimes misleading and faith in the traditional biography is perhaps too strong, but the notes bear the stamp of practical classroom experience. The text,</page><page sequence="4">80 SANDER M. GOLDBERG however, is that of Marouzeau, which is not widely accepted. The Adelphoe of MARTIN (8) demands the attention of both students and scholars. His new text and apparatus supersede the popular OCT, and he handles the many problems ot this play with knowledge, sense, and tact. Translating Terence has never been easy. Of the three complete editions listed here BOVIE (9) is probably the best. Bovie himself has done Andria and Heautontimorumenos; Constance Carrier translates Hecyra and Adelphoe; Eunuchus and Phormio appear in versions by Douglass S. Parker. Though Bovie is a graceful and accurate translator, Carrier perhaps comes closest to capturing the essence of Terentian subtlety. Some may think Parker's Terence sounds a little too much like his Aristophanes, but his critical introduction to Eunuchus may well be the finest essay on this play in English and deserves to be better known.

The modern text of Terence is based upon the ancient Codex Bembinus and the medieval manuscripts, some with illustrations, that comprise the so-called Calliopian class. PRETE (21) provides photographs and an important discussion of the Bembinus, JACHMANN (17) a facsimile of the most important illus- trated manuscript, and JONES and MOREY (18) furnish excellent plates and discussion of all the important illustrated texts. The major problem in the text history of Terence lies in the confused, contaminated, and considerable array of Calliopian manuscripts. They present a complex stemmatic problem, and we know little about the early history of the tradition they represent. GRANT (14) brings new order to the mixed manuscripts by stressing the importance of verse divisions for building the stemma; his study of the illustrated manuscripts (15) suggests an origin for them considerably earlier than the date of 400 A.D. advo- cated by Jachmann.1 Grant is working toward a re-evaluation of the medieval manuscripts that promises a real advance in the text pistory of Terence. Several new sources have been reported. ALLEN (12) calls attention to an un- noticed manuscript available on microfilm; KOSTER (19) collates a new frag- ment containing, with scholia, Hecyra 784-798, 799-813 and Phormio 63-84 and I Jachmann, G. Die Geschichfe des Terenztextes im Altertum (Basel 1924).</page><page sequence="5">TERENCE AND THE FRAGMENTS OF ROMAN COMEDY 8 1 84-105. MAURACH (20) reports a tenth-century manuscript containing 123 lines of Phormio with scholia. In 1958 Otto Skutsch augmented the critical apparatus of the Oxford text by Kauer and Lindsay with the readings of a fragmentary palimpsest and two papyri. The most important of these additions is P. Oxy. 2401, two leaves from a codex of the fourth or fifth century that contain Andria 602-668 and 924- 979a. The papyrus text seems to be independent of the manuscript tradition. None of these additions has affected the printed text seriously, however, and recent chal- lenges to the Oxford Terence have been neither numerous nor crucial. I single out a few that raise interesting questions. ROSIVACH (22) prefers to read illi tu for vestitu at Adelphoe 63. SEWART (23) advocates quem ipsa neglexit for ipse at Hecyra 670. Ipsa was preferred by Donatus and has some manuscript support. There is no such support for Rosivach's illi tu. The impetus for each emendation, however, is not strictly textual. Sewart's reading removes an aside that Laches must otherwise partially overhear. Rosivach seeks to restore what he sees to be a sequence of thought in Micio's speech. These are actually matters of literary interpretation cast as textual problems. They stand or fall on dramatic, not tex- tual grounds. BADER (13) makes an interesting contrast. He wants to take Eunuchus 50 away from Parmeno, arguing that Phaedria opens the play with the kind of self-apostrophe we now see at Dis Exapaton 18-30 and Dyskolos 214- 217. The use of recently discovered Greek texts on papyrus adds an important new dimension to analysis of Latin dramaturgy, and the fact that Bader is also supported by the distribution of parts in the Bembinus is significant, in its own right and as possible evidence for the authority of that ancient manuscript. Even if we do not agree with Bader, we must recognize the importance of the kind of evidence he employs. WILLE (24) uses the distribution of parts in the Bembinus to determine the minimum number of actors necessary to stage each of the plays. GRANT (16) and ZETZEL (25) use textual problems to raise important ques- tions about the very transmission of classical texts. Grant examines Adelphoe 952-958, 348-350, 821-827 to show how corruption can be due to previously un- suspected interpolations and confusion in the assigning of parts. In championing the reading cave ne te tristem sentiat found in Nonius Marcellus (and not re- ported in the Oxford apparatus), Zetzel shows how Servius apparently rejected the correct reading for the wrong reasons. Examination of a minor textual variant becomes a suggestive inquiry into the aims, methods, and the credibility of ancient scholars. IV. EVALUATIONS 26. Bianco, 0.

Winckel- mann in the eighteenth century dealt the reputation of Terence a blow from which it has yet to recover fully. When August Wilhelm Schlegel, writing in the shadow of Winckelmann, came to study ancient drama at the beginning of the next century, he could see in a poet long admired for his style and often imitated by Renaissance dramatists only a poverty of imagination and a regrettable lack of Dichtergeist. Schlegel used Plautus and Terence simply as source material for his study of lost Greek comedy, and this approach, though sometimes modified and sometimes inverted, remains with us. Many modern scholars believe that Terence's artistic achievement can only be measured by comparison with his originals. The fact that these originals no longer exist inevitably affects the crit- ical methods of these scholars and colors the results of their work. Eduard Fraenkel had predicated his study of the Plautine in Plautus upon the assumption that Greek and Latin elements can be distinguished by philological methods. By concentrating on language and the construction of speeches and scenes, Fraenkel made a lasting contribution. He dealt with the Latin text itself, bringing knowledge and skill to bear on explicating it. He did not have to recon- struct Plautus' Greek originals to do so, and when he did try to answer larger questions of plot structure, he went awry.2 When JACHMANN (30) claimed that Terence was essentially a translator of Menandrean comedy, however, he was moving from the firm ground of his friend Fraenkel's textual explication to this more speculative realm of plot structure. Jachmann considered Terence to be a dramatist handicapped by his own lack of genius and by the rudeness of his audience, a writer who showed originality only in the "contamination" of his models. Jachmann made the question of sources the central problem of Teren- tian studies. Though the aesthetic question underlying the contaminatio problem is the why of Terence's interpolations, Jachmann and his successors have con- centrated instead on the more technical question of what he interpolated. LUDWIG (33), whose position is a little closer to Jachmann's than he cares to admit, observes that Terence chose psychologically complex plays for his models and added scenes of broad action from additional sources. Ludwig sees no pur- pose in these interpolations other than an attempt to make the subtleties of Menandrean comedy more appealing to Roman audiences through the addition of richer visual elements, livelier plots, and heightened suspense. Though he credits Terence with being the first to introduce humanitas to Latin literature, he does not think that a play of Terence is "an essentially new creation." Like Jach- mann, he damns Terence with faint praise, assuming a refinement of sentiment and structure in Menander that the Latin imitator could not equal. Recent dis- coveries on papyrus, however, make it increasingly difficult to accept this view of Menander without scrutiny, and the resulting picture of Terence as a scissors- and-paste adapter will have to be reconsidered. LEO (32) took a different tack. His seminal work on Plautus had indeed used Latin texts to learn about lost Greek ones, but he saw Terence as the beginning, not the end of a literary process.3 Leo accepted Terence on his own terms as an 2 As in his theory of Plautine "contamination", which he was to amend in Elementi plauuini in Plaulo (Florence 1960) 431-33. Jachmann's Plautinisches und Attisches (Berlin 1931) carried the reconstruction of Plautine originals much further, but with no more suc- cess. See the pointed and telling attack of G. Duckworth, "The Structure of the Miles Gloriosus," CP 30 (1935) 228-46. 3 The brilliant synthesis of Greek fragments and the plays of Plautus in the second edi- tion of Leo's Plautinische Forschungen (Berlin 1912) defined many problems still central to Plautine scholarship. Its many insights into ancient comedy make the work still worth read- ing.</page><page sequence="7">TERENCE AND THE FRAGMENTS OF ROMAN COMEDY 85 artist in his own right, and he showed how, though the prologues appeal to the authority of Plautus and Caecilius, Terence was actually struggling against the old style they represented. The Terence of this brilliant essay is not an amateur bullied by his audiences and overshadowed by his predecessors, but the creator of a new Latin art that set the tone for centuries of development. This emphasis on style was continued in a famous article by HAFFTER (29), now reprinted as a monograph and also available in an Italian edition with an excellent biblio- graphic supplement by Dante Nardo. Haffter points out that to judge Terence by his models is to equate newness of content with artistic merit. He concentrates in- stead on those traits that are Terence's own: new uses of dialogue, the double plot, the urbane diction. Terence, says Haffter, takes man out from under the power of Tyche, putting the solution of his problems in his own hands. This in- novation not only constitutes what we call Terentian humanitas but marks the change from fantastic to realistic comedy that determined the course of subse- quent western drama. Haffter brings to the study of Terence both the philo- logist's skill and the literary critic's aesthetic sense. BUCHNER (27) is a landmark work. This massive book, which includes a general essay, scene-by-scene analysis of each play, a detailed summation, and a catalogue of Latin verses that have extant Greek versions, is a major contribu- tion to Terentian studies. As used by Jachmann and Ludwig, the German analytic method is a destructive tool focusing on the "faults" of a text. Terence is invariably diminished by such study. Buchner shares the belief that Terence must be measured against his models and is equally skilled at finding the seams in a Latin text, but his work demonstrates the positive power of close analysis. Sensitivity to Terence's strengths as a dramatist leads Buchner to a solid series of insights into both the technique of each play and the artistic design behind that technique. The work is invaluable, but two caveats are in order. First, though Buchner writes of Terence with authority, he has less command of the new texts of Greek comedy, a weak spot that blunts the force of certain arguments. A long section claiming that Terence's originals lacked expository prologues themselves, for example, fails to convince not only because the new finds all seem to have had prologues, but because the function of these prologues is more complex and more essential to the plays' meanings than Buchner envisions. Second, discus- sion of the plays by act and scene breaks the dramatic action into completely artificial segments. The plays were written to be performed continuously, and Buchner's analysis sometimes obscures Terence's own concept of the play's de- sign. A patient reader will nevertheless learn much from Buchner's careful dis- cussion. CROCE (28) quite rightly saw that to call Terence simply a translator does not do him justice, and his spirited rebuttal of Jachmann makes many sensitive and astute observations, especially on Eunuchus and Adelphoe. Eulogy, however, is not criticism. Croce's essay fails to restore Terence's reputation largely because it assumes virtue without defining or identifying it. Jachmann could also be sub- jective and arbitrary in his judgments, but he laid his foundations with care. One need not share his aesthetic values to benefit from his insights. Though Croce's aesthetic values may well be more appropriate for judging Terence's art, they are of limited use without the discipline necessary to apply them to the text. Lack of such discipline, frustrating in an essay of Croce's acumen, seriously mars the books of PERELLI (35) and TALADOIRE (38). Perelli wants to see in Terence a moralist attacking traditional social values and conventions, but he specifies neither the norms he thinks attacked nor the techniques by which Terence ex- poses them. Taladoire's beliefs that Terence's refined taste educated the Roman public and that his apparent interest in the theme of love reflects the interests of his own youth are similarly lacking in specific argument or documentation from other ancient texts or from such important modern scholars as Haffter. Impres- sions are less useful than reasons, and the value of these two books suffers ac- cordingly. POSANI (36) inquires into the nature of Terentian humor, asking why he uses the broad jokes, stock types, and comic extravagance of Plautus so sparingly. Terence, she suggests, continues the serious form of comedy that</page><page sequence="8">86 SANDER M. GOLDBERG Menander derived from Theophrastos. Though the recent discovery of broad comedy in Menander may lead us to reconsider her generalizations, this essay re- mains useful for its discussion of particular comic effects in Terence. BIANCO (26) rightly sees that an inquiry into Terentian originality must com- bine the skills of Jachmann and the sensitivity of Croce. His introductory sec- tion, deeply indebted to Haffter, includes a sensible appraisal of past scholarship and approaches some traditional problems with real insight. Bianco recognizes, for example, that Terence's contaminatio alters the tone and emphasis as well as the structure of the Greek original, a vital change that strict analysis does not re- veal. The skills an analytic scholar brings to the text are not primarily aesthetic ones, and his results do not equip him to make aesthetic judgments. This is why Jachmann's view of Terence is so inadequate and why Ludwig's answers to ques- tions of artistry are so unsatisfying. Bianco's own use of philology to answer aesthetic questions, however, is not a success. An attempt to trace the polemic prologue back to the parabasis of Old Comedy pales beside the researches of Leo and Fraenkel, and scene-by-scene analysis of each play obscures the very artistic design Bianco is seeking. As Ludwig says in his harsh but perceptive review, Bianco misuses Jachmann's tools in his effort to answer Croce's questions. Stu- dents of Terence are better served by Haffter and Bflchner. NORWOOD (34) remains the only book-length study of Terence in English. Like Norwood's other work on Roman comedy, it combines brilliant insights, keen sensitivity to dramatic art, and a critical willfulness capable of obscuring the brilliance and giving sensitivity a bad name. The refusal to see merit in other Roman dramatists, an unbridled and unfounded contempt for the Roman aud- ience, and a groundless insistence on a late date for Hecyra distort both Ter- ence's own artistic principles and his place in the history of drama. A careful and critical reader will nevertheless find much of value, especially on Hecyra and Adelphoe and on the dimidiatus Menander epigram ascribed to Caesar. Even where Norwood is thoroughly, horribly wrong, as in his assessments of Phormio and Eunuchus, his refusal to see the truth may well point more sympathetic readers of these plays in the right direction. SANDBACH (37) will never be thought willful. His basically sound summary of current attitudes toward Ter- ence stresses the alteration of his models and thus focuses on Eunuchus and Adelphoe. Because the essay seeks to reflect a scholarly consensus, it lacks a spirit of its own. Sandbach does not have any particular opinion of Terence; thus, while he will not mislead readers, he will not lead them to any real under- standing of the dramatist either. JUHNKE (31) surveys the general field of Terentian studies, including other Roman comic poets and the logata. There are sections on the ancient vita, chronology, and the prologues; brief discussions of each play; and longer descriptions of modern research on such subjects as style, dramatic technique, characters, conventions, etc. The bibliography is good, though it ignores such important recent work in English as Martin's edition of Adelphoe and Wright's study of thepalliata tradition. The central contribution of WRIGHT (39) to our understanding of the Roman comic tradition will be discussed later. His perception that, in a crucial sense, Terence stands outside that tradition makes his Terence chapter of special impor- tance in the present context. Astute discussion of parallel scenes in Plautus and Terence reveals how Terence rejected the accepted conventions of palliata com- edy. Wright does not offer a full appraisal of Terence as a dramatist; that was not his aim. More than any other work in this section, however, this essay offers fresh insights and suggests a new perspective for evaluating the objectives and the achievements of this very difficult author. Wright, like Buchner, is required reading. V. TOPICAL STUDIES A. Contaminatio 40. Beare, W. "Contaminatio." CR 9 (1959) 7-1 1.</page><page sequence="9">TERENCE AND THE FRAGMENTS OF ROMAN COMEDY 87 41. . The Roman Stage. 3rd ed. (London 1964) 310-13. 42. Duckworth, G. The Nature of Roman Comedy (Princeton 1952) 202-08. 43. Kujore, 0. "A Note on Contaminatio in Terence." CP69 (1974) 39-42. The old controversy, judiciously surveyed by DUCKWORTH (42) and MAR- TI (3), over what either Terence or his rivals meant by contaminari has cooled considerably. The argument of BEARE (40, 41) that the verb means simply "to spoil" has won acceptance; such definitions as "to mix" or even "to spoil by mixing" are now seen as a kind of special pleading. KUJORE (43) points that the same kind of interpolation denoted by contaminari in the Andria and Heautontimorumenos prologues is called simply furtum in Eunuchus and Adel- phoe. This change of vocabulary tells against any technical meaning for the verb, and only in Plautine studies does a more specialized meaning continue to be sought.4 Beare, however, has not resolved all the issues. The joins resulting from Terence's interpolations, at least as the prologues and the commentary of Dona- tus identify them, have helped analytic scholars in their reconstructions of the Greek originals, but this is not their only value. Since we can identify deliberate interpolations, literary scholars may want to ask why Terence added this mate- rial. What dramatic effects was he seeking? No really satisfying answers to this question have been suggested. Similarly, students of Terentian language might wonder about the verb's rhetorical value. Contaminari non decere fabulas sounds like a slogan. Was this Terence's intent? How was he hoping to influence public opinion? The old interest in Terence's alterations of his models was not misplaced, but it might profitably be turned to a new set of questions. B. Chronology 44. Earl, D. C. "Terence and Roman Politics."

Since antiquity, Terence's claim to the patronage of certain homines nobiles has led critics to associate him with the young men of the Scipionic circle (cf. Cic, ad Att. 7.3.10; Suet., Vita; Don., ad Ad. 15). There are two problems with this association. The first is a problem of chronology. Adelphoe was produced at the funeral games of L. Aemilius Paullus in 161 B.C. Scipio Aemilianus was then twenty-four. He can hardly be the distinguished man of Terence's reference and, especially if we accept the traditional identification of Adelphoe as Terence's last play, he was certainly too young to have influenced Terence's earlier work. MATTINGLY (46) attacks the authority of the didascaliae and looks to the pro- logues for independent evidence for a relative chronology. He argues that Phor- mio, Eunuchus, and all three productions of Hecyra followed Adelphoe. A sub- sequent article (45) puts Terence's career into the 150's. Although Mattingly's actual dating has not won acceptance, his attack on the authority of the didasca- liae cannot be ignored. One need not accept either his relative order for the plays nor his dates to recognize that the traditional chronology is insecure. A still greater problem involves the role of the Scipionic circle. Review of the evidence had led STRASBURGER (47) to question the very existence of such a literary sa- lon. ZETZEL (48) argues that what we call the Scipionic circle is really only a dramatic fiction of Cicero's dialogues. EARL (44) had previously pointed out that Terence showed little awareness of the political si2nificance in words like 4 Most recently by L. Schaaf, Der Miles Gloriosus des Plautus und sein griechisches Original (Munich 1977). See in particular Schaaf's long note on the verb contaminare, pp. 381-83.</page><page sequence="10">88 SANDER M. GOLDBERG gloria and virtus, and it is now increasingly difficult to establish him in any po- litical context. Neither his dates nor his relationship with any literary group can be regarded as certain. Scholars wishing to attach political or historical signifi- cance to the plot or language of any play by Terence will have to come to grips with these larger issues. C.

Interesting work has been done on the language of Terence; some studies focus on the nuances of particular words, while others have wider interests. All such work is facilitated by the excellent lexicon of MCGLYNN (56), which replaces the old single volume Index verborum Terentianus of E. B. Jenkins (Chapel Hill 1932). Of the particular studies, CARNEY (49) shows that sodes is used by su- periors to inferiors and quaeso between equals, while SALAT (57) isolates miser as a favorite word of the grotesques in Plautus and of the young men in Terence. CORBETT (50) provides a catalogue of verbs with figurative meanings in Plau- tus and Terence; WATT (59) lists the various uses of heus in Plautus, Terence, Cicero, and later authors. The task of LUCK (54) was more complex. A master- ful analysis of the relevant passages distinguishes convincingly among the inter- jections em, hem, and ehem. A second article (53) links Terence's nasal interjec- tion hem (cf. French hein?) with een in Menander. THESLEFF (58) also pro- vides something more than a catalogue. His study of the linguistic patterns of confirmation and denial in early Latin makes an important contribution to the study of Latin syntax and deserves to be better known. FANTHAM (51) studies the imagery of Plautus, Terence and Cicero, aiming to distinguish the metaphors common in cultured Latin from those which entered the language from Greek. Perceptive discussion of the available data and excellent indices make this an in- dispensable aid to further work on Terentian language. FLURY (52) takes a dif- ferent tack. He first distinguishes among the abstract, divine Eros of Menander, the anthropomorphic Amor of Plautus, and the generalized Love of Terence, a drive springing from the animus that is no different from any other human drive. Hence the acutely divided loyalties of Terence's young men. From this follow perceptive and sensitive discussions of the representation of mental states and the use of metaphor in the three authors. Flury's comparative approach and his refusal to be drawn into the question of Greek influences on Terence yield a study modest in its aims and useful in its results. MALTBY (55) represents a new development that owes an explicit debt to re- cent work on Menander. A brilliant article in Entretiens Hardt XVI by F. H.</page><page sequence="11">TERENCE AND THE FRAGMENTS OF ROMAN COMEDY 91 Sandbach, followed by further insights in his Oxford commentary, demon- strated how Menander gave certain mannerisms of speech-interjections, pet words, syntactical oddities, etc.-to certain characters to enrich their character- ization. Maltby attempts something similar with Terence's old men. He discusses apparent archaisms, long-winded expressions, words linked to dramatic roles, and pet expressions that he believes unique to certain old men. The language of Terence's day was in such flux, however, that archaisms as perceived by Ter- ence's own audiences are difficult for us to identify convincingly, and one may doubt whether two instances of a word in a play are really sufficient to constitute a mannerism. Syntactical patterns are not discussed. Maltby's results are there- fore more suggestive than conclusive, but this is obviously an approach to the study of Terence that is worth pursuing further. D.

Excellent work has been done in the general area of dramatic technique. BRU- DER (60) points out that metrical changes may have external causes (e.g., changes of scene or characters) and internal causes (e.g., changes of tempo and mood). He discusses metrical variation in Terence in its dramatic context, seek- ing to identify its dramatic effects. DENZLER (61) defines a monologue as the speech of a character that allows uninhibited expression. He is particularly inter- esting on Andria and Hecyra, showing how monologues can be used either for exposition or to reveal character. Because Denzler does not distinguish between long, set speeches and brief entrance lines or asides, his statistical analysis can be misleading, but he is surely right to claim greater originality for Terence's use of monologue than many often do. The study of exposition by LEFEVRE (67) is also quite useful, though its underlying assumptions may give one pause. Metic- ulous analysis of each play reveals how even without an expository prologue the audience is given all the information it needs before that information is i juired. The old claim that Terence eliminated the expository prologue simply to create suspense cannot stand. Lef6vre is less convincing when he reconstructs the ex- position as it must have stood in the Greek originals. The very assumption that those originals had true expository prologues is dubious, and this leads to prob- lems with his results. One need only contrast Lefevre's chapter on Hecyra with SEWART (85) to realize how little is certain about the expository techniques of New Comedy. Lefbvre treats the plays as if Terence's prime goal is to tell a story, and while this is certainly possible, other factors may equally well have influ- enced Terence's expository technique. A different kind of analysis is offered by GORLER (66). Close reading of two parallel scenes of a superior berating a ser- vant reveals strong similarities in diction and construction. This is hardly a case</page><page sequence="12">92 SANDER M. GOLDBERG of conscious imitation, though Terence's original is also Menandrean. GorIer has defined a type scene and identified a tangible piece of what we call a drama- tic tradition. GILULA (64) observes that not all exits are announced by obvious exit lines and that the omission of such lines is not necessarily a mark of faulty technique. The critic need only envision the stage action to realize how well exits can be effected without such verbal signals. Work on the prologues has not been quite as interesting. MATTINGLY (46) had used them as witnesses for Terence's career; POSANI (69) centers discussion on Heautontimorumenos, Adelphoe, and Eunuchus to examine Terence's pur- ported struggle with Luscius Lanuvinus. Friedrich Leo's Analecta Plautina II (Gottingen 1898) = Ausgewahite kleine Schriften (Rome 1960) 135-49 remains the best discussion of Terence's language in the prologues. The rhetorical quality Leo examined in terms of style is now analyzed by GELHAUS (63) in terms of structure. He argues that each prologue has an exordium, narratio, argumenta- tio and conclusio as prescribed in the rhetorical manuals of Cicero, Quintilian, and the ad Herennium. The case is strong for Andria, rather contrived for some of the others. FOCARDI (62) studies specific words in the prologues that have legal overtones, and her approach raises some interesting questions worth ex- ploring further. Fraenkel demonstrated that the persistent legalism of Plautus was his own innovation, a device for winning his audience. The legalism of Ter- ence, probably also aimed at winning an audience, is concentrated in the pro- logues. Not even in Phormio, with a plot based on the workings of the law, is le- gal language used extensively in dramatic contexts. Why does Terence cast his polemics in the form of legal arguments? PRIMMER (70) provides the closest and most sophisticated reading of any Terentian prologue and perceives the un- derlying issues. He reveals how deeply rhetorical the speech is, taking duplex to be ironic and perceiving the slogan behind the use of contaminare. LEVIN (68) seeks to show that Terence's double plots combine a "marriage- plot" resolved by a recognition with a "liaison-plot" featuring an intrigue. This offers the use of a variety of dramatic devices and the opportunity to contrast different types of lovers and different types of love. This schema, however, is too simplistic, and GORLER (65) makes an important correction. He shows how the elements of intrigue and recognition are too tightly interwoven in Phormio to fit Levin's model, and he goes on to show that, although intrigue and anagnori- sis are the traditional ways to build a plot, Terence uses them differently in each play. HAFFTER (29) and LUDWIG (33) both remarked that Terence seeks to enrich the action. Gorler asks what we mean by "enriched action," and his essay is among the most penetrating discussion of Terence's dramaturgy yet produced. VI.

A traditional scholarly concern has been to identify the extent of that interpolation and-if this is indeed the same ques- tion-to explain Terence's introduction of Charinus and Byrria, who Donatus says were not in the Greek Andria. MARTIN (76) argues for the play's coher- ence, denying the structural weaknesses supposed by analytic critics. His attack on Kontaminationsforschung as a method for identifying the limits of Terence's creativity has not been influential. LEFfIVRE (74) attributes the inconsistencies and contradictions he sees in Andria to Terence's elimination of the Greek prologue. STEIDLE (77) discusses a wide range of structural and motivational problems in his attempt to identify the underlying play by Menander. CAIRNS (71) and FOSTER (72) discuss the interpretation of two lines. Cairns suggested that si veniat, quod di prohibeant, discessio translates a formula of Greek marriage contracts attested in papyri of the third century A.D. Foster ac- cepts this identification but points out that huc redit of 567 is a Terentian idiom and therefore cannot refer to Simo himself. There are two examples of literary criticism. For MCGARRITY (75) the play dramatizes the officium patris as exemplified both by Simo and Pamphilus in his obligations to Glycerium. The presence of Charinus reinforces the theme of re- sponsibility and duty. This discussion is valuable, though some may take excep- tion to the term pater to describe Pamphilus' obligations to the girl he has made pregnant, and the study tends to ignore the fact that Pamphilus, as Terence has written the part, is not much of a dramatic presence. GOLDBERG (73) sees in both the novel by Thornton Wilder and in Our Town a reworking of Terence's study in family relationships. Wilder's attempt failed as a novel but succeeded when he returned to the dramatic form in which Terence had envisioned it. B. Heautontimorumenos: See also PRIMMER (70) and FANTHAM (101). 78.

Difficulty in labeling Chremes as either humanus or curio- sus and Bacchis as either bona or mala leads him to suspect that Terence has al- tered Menander's play to include not just the intrigue against Menedemus but also the second intrigue against Chremes. Lef6vre then adduces structural argu- ments to support the view that Terence himself has doubled the action and changed the characters of Chremes and Bacchis accordingly. Menander's com- edy of character is thus made into a complex play of intrigue along Plautine lines. This analysis challenges the traditional view that Terence sought refine- ment through fidelity to Menander, and STEIDLE (82) therefore thinks it "with- out probability". His own long analysis makes clear that we remain far from a scholarly consensus on what Terence's original was like. The study of the sapiens by NARDO (81) focuses on this play to show how the man who seems wise in Terence often does not really understand the situation and thus actually lacks true knowledge. Two studies probe the philosophical underpinnings of the play. JOCELYN (79) claims that Chremes' famous line is intended not to be noble but to awaken the native Roman suspicion of philosophy. GRIMAL (78), building on the some- what tenuous thesis of Adelmo Barigazzi's IIformazionespirituale di Menandro</page><page sequence="14">94 SANDER M. GOLDBERG (Turin 1965) that Menandrean comedy dramatizes Aristotelian poetic and ethi- cal theory, sees in Terence's play a philosophical comedy showing the truth of Aristotle's view of human character and behavior. Dramatic action, says Gri- mal, is subordinated to the representation of character along Aristotelian lines. Grimal in effect offers an alternative explanation ot the "inconsistencies" Lefevre sees in these characters, and it is unfortunate that Grimal does not take into account the arguments of either Lef6vre or Steidle. Such an attempt would be of interest. C. Hecyra: See also SEWART (23) and MARTIN (I 15). 83. Posani, M. R. "OriginalitA artistica dell'Hecyra di Terenzio." A&amp;R 8 (1940) 225-46. 84.

The structural problems of Hecyra were defined by SCHADEWALDT (84), who saw difficulty not only in what the audience is told of the action, but what the characters themselves know. Schadewaldt assumed, and he is followed in this by Lef6vre (67) and BUchner (27), that the lack of an expository prologue neces- sitated extensive revision in the structure of the Greek original to incorporate the required exposition in the body of the play. There has been no consensus, how- ever, on how this was done, and SEWART (85) now challenges the very problem that German scholarship has defined. Sewart shows that Terence's play makes adequate sense without an expository prologue, though the focus was perhaps al- tered by its omission. If Apollodorus cast the slave Parmeno as the victim of his own self-importance, the irony made possible by a delayed prologue was lost in the play as Terence wrote it, but the structure need not have been seriously al- tered. The prologue intended to shape attitudes toward characters rather than simply to facilitate exposition is now a well documented technique of Greek New Comedy, and Sewart's argument draws support from Greek parallels as well as from its own internal logic and admirable simplicity. POSANI (83) offers a sym- pathetic study of the meretrix Bacchis, comparing her to Habrotonon of Menan- der's Epitrepontes and discussing the special air of "sadness and mystery" that Terence has created.

Eunuchus has been a major battleground of the contawitinatio controversy, since Terence says in his prologue that he has added to Menander's Eunouchos the soldier and parasite of Menander's Kolax. Analytic criticism, represented here by LUDWIG (88) and STEIDLE (77), examines the effect of this interpola- tion on the play's structure and debates the source of the play's conclusion,</page><page sequence="15">TERENCE AND THE FRAGMENTS OF ROMAN COMEDY 95 where Phaedria agrees to share Thais with the soldier Thraso. Was Phaedria's ri- val also a soldier in the Greek original? Is Antipho's entry at 539 a Terentian al- teration? Is the finale taken from Kolax? Ludwig reconstructs a Menandrean original about a bona meretrix: Terence has altered Menander's design and sub- stituted the end of the "coarser" Kolax, thus blurring the character of Thais. Steidle judges the ending compatible with Menander's Eunouchos. LLOYD- JONES (108) thinks Ludwig has unduly romanticized Thais. He and PEPE (89) see in the ending a cynical realism as appropriate to Terence's play as it presum- ably was to the Greek original. BROTHERS (86), following the approach of Lefevre (67), thinks that only lines 203-206 are incorporated from the suppressed Greek prologue. RONCALI (90) has edited notes from a seminar conducted by Eduard Fraenkel at Bari in 1969. There are textual, grammatical, and literary comments in Donatan fashion on the didascalia and lines 1-206, 292-390, 454- 506, 539-614, 668-726, and 910-970. As always, Fraenkel can be read with profit. Literary critics have taken a different approach. GILMARTIN (87), pointing out that Terence's prologue deliberately directs attention to Thraso and Gnatho, thinks Thraso is intended to contrast with Chaerea. The play deals with "the bas- ic need to belong." The full and perceptive analysis of SAYLOR (91) contrasts the planned affair of Phaedria with the unplanned romance of Chaerea. The dis- tinction Saylor makes between success and failure, the unplanned as opposed to the planned, is perhaps overdrawn, but his article reveals a unity of design in the play that analytic criticism has obscured. Unfortunately, Saylor says little about Thraso and Gnatho, and an argument that the victory of "planlessness" paro- dies the plot conventions of New Comedy is not convincing. Literary critics would do well to consider the point made by Parker (9) that each character in the play seeks to become subservient. The thematic unity Parker suggests for the play manages to incorporate all of its dramatic components. E. Phormio 92. Arnott, W. G. "Phormio parasitus.

Phormio is a play of intrigue generally thought to be little altered from the Greek original of Apollodorus. LEFEVRE (94) now challenges that assumption. Analysis of Antipho's wedding and the double marriage of Chremes leads Lef&amp;vre to the conclusion that Terence has altered the timing of the former and introduced the latter. Lef&amp;vre then reconstructs a rather different play for Apol- lodorus and, in an interesting and provocative conclusion, suggests reasons for Terence's alterations that involve the changed attitudes toward chance and morality in the Roman world. Combination of analytic acumen with the humanistic interest pioneered by Haffter (29) creates a monograph of real sig- nificance not just for study of Phormio, but of Terence as a Roman dramatist. Two works deal with dramatic effect. QUINN (95) examines how Terence sets out to tell a story, but readers who approach this section for insights into the na- ture of dramatic narrative and plot construction will be disappointed. STEIDLE (97) is interested in how the play would appear to an audience. He talks us through the action of Phormio. In an important study of Terence's use of language, ARNOTT (92) shows how Phormio's character is enriched and his dramatic presence enhanced by skillful manipulation of "verbal fireworks." Geta and Phormio alternate between colorless and extravagant language as the dramatic context requires. BOHM (93)</page><page sequence="16">96 SANDER M. GOLDBERG emphasizes the prominence of money, present or lacking, prized or ignored, in the play, an emphasis introduced by Davus' repayment of a loan in the first scene. SEGAL and MOULTON (96) point out that Phormio is a rare example of a comedy built upon working within the law. Their discussion of legal joking and manipulation makes many interesting points but involves problems of scholarly method that we shall need to discuss presently. F.

Rieth saw two basic problems of in- terpretation in Adelphoe: the scene added from Diphilus at 155 ff. and Micio's reaction to the suggestion that he marry at 924 ff. Terence says in his prologue that the scene of bullying a pimp comes from Diphilus, and Donatus reports apud Menandrum senex de nuptiis non gravatur (ad 938). Though both these facts arise from information outside the text, they have been at the center of scholarly debate since at least the time of Diderot and Lessing. Sorting out the original Menandrean structure, the material added from Diphilus, and Terence's original adjustments leads Rieth to the conclusion that the Micio of Menander's play was the hero. By trying to find a middle ground between Micio and Demea, Terence has altered their relationship and blurred the characters as Menander had delineated them. "The basic distinction between Menander and Terence," Rieth concludes, "lies not in their differing estimations of human character, but in their differing visions. Terence is not capable of comprehending a figure as a character (Gestalt) and deriving all his speeches and actions from a kernel of reality (Wesenkern)." Gaiser's afterword adds a detailed comparison of Adelphoe and a reconstructed Menandrean original. Many fine observations about dramatic technique result from such close study. The difficulty, as Arnott remarks with insight in his review, is that it may all be wrong. Aesthetic conclu-</page><page sequence="17">TERENCE AND THE FRAGMENTS OF ROMAN COMEDY 99 sions based on this kind of analysis are only as secure as the structural arguments that generate them, and Rieth's arguments have not silenced debate. DOREY (100), like Rieth, had denied that the ending was Menandrean and was promptly answered by ARNOTT (98). GRANT (104) attacks Rieth directly, showing Terence's closeness to Menander and defending the "dramatic sense" of the end- ing. FANTHAM (101), concerned primarily with the thematic similarities of Adelphoe and Heautontimorumenos, also includes a point-by-point critique of Rieth's structural arguments. LORD (109) attacks Rieth on other grounds. Rieth, followed by Gaiser, saw in Micio the ideal father of Aristotle's ethical theory, and he used this link to argue for the perfection of Micio in Menander's play. (Menander is said to have been a pupil of Theophrastus.) Lord shows not only that Micio does not adhere closely to Aristotelian principles, but that Aristotelian virtues can also be found in Demea. An Aristotelian influence on Menander may well have left traces in Terence, but Lord shows that they are not as easily schematized as Rieth and Gaiser wish. The relative virtues of Micio and Demea have also been debated independently of their Menandrean roots. Opinions of the play's ending depend in large part on whether Micio's final humiliation, if it is indeed a humiliation, is deserved. FANTHAM (101) believes that Micio's behavior in the last act contradicts all we have learned about him. CARRUBBA (99), LLOYD-JONES (108), and especially TRANKLE (112) claim real sympathy for Demea. Micio's downfall is thus appropriate and inevitable, an interpretation developed with great skill by JOHNSON (107), who details Micio's self-importance and arrogance toward his brother. NORWOOD (34) said something similar forty years before. Yet there is still no consensus. The astute and sensitive study of POSCHL (110) again sees the greater merit in Micio, who undergoes not real humiliation but only the teas- ing that comic heroes often endure. He has, after all, converted Demea to his way of thinking. A different aspect of the problem involving Greek originals is explored by FANTHAM (102). Of the interpolation from Diphilus, Terence says in his pro- logue, "verbum de verbo expressum extulit". Fantham therefore takes the scene from 155-196 "as clear evidence of Diphilus' narrative and characterisation", and she argues that the Aeschinus of this scene is inconsistent with the young man we see in the rest of the play. She believes that Menander kept the abduction entirely off the stage and that the audience learned from an introductory pro- logue that Aeschinus was acting for Ctesipho. "Was Menander prepared to let his public think Micio a fool, and Aeschinus a cad, even for one act?" Excluding the prologue, Terence's "first act" amounts to 129 lines. In Aspis Menander was prepared to let the audience think Kleostratos was dead for 96 lines. A delayed prologue then told them otherwise. The effect was perhaps closer to the surprise of Adelphoe than Fantham allows. She goes on to say some excellent things about the theme of vis in the scene and its contribution to the plot, but as with Rieth, conclusions based upon structural inconsistencies are only as strong as our belief in the error of those inconsistencies, and assumptions about what New Comedy could and could not do must always be retested against our new Greek texts. FOREHAND (103) and GRANT (105) examine Terence's use of minor char- acters. Forehand claims that Syrus' role as intermediary between Demea and Ctesipho highlights the crucial lack of communication between them. Grant likens the function of the nurse Canthara to that of Sosia in Andria, a character used to enrich the stage action. The latest contribution to this continual debate is GREENBERG (106), a thoughtful reading of the text built upon judicious use of past scholarship. Greenberg thinks the play "an uncomfortable amalgam of the serious and the comic," by which he means primarily the representation of Micio's views and the farcical finale. Because the inherent goodness of Aeschinus confirms the rightness of Micio's position, the play's ending must be a kind of joke that takes justification simply from its punchline. If the finale is indeed such a joke, the</page><page sequence="18">100 SANDER M. GOLDBERG play's beginning need not be taken seriously, "or rather," says Greenberg in a deft inversion, "one need not conclude that Micio's theories are seriously at- tacked." This is an interesting way around an old problem and makes for an im- portant article. Like many other scholars, however, Greenberg tends to ignore the stage action. Neither Aeschinus' scene with Sannio nor Demea's implementa- tion of Micio's principles receives attention; yet an audience that sees Aeschinus as a cowardly bully and witnesses the failure of Micio's principles when put to the test might well doubt the inherent goodness or rightness of the father and son. The tacit assumption by so many writers on Adelphoe that the action exists for the sake of the characters, or, as here, that it can be independent of the characters, creates as many critical problems as it solves. Rieth set this pattern of inquiry by finding roots for the play in Aristotle's ethical works. Critics might now do well to think instead of the Poetics and ask what happens in the play and why Terence has it happen. G. Summary: Problems of Aims and Methods Because no reconstruction of a lost Greek play from its Latin adaptation has proven definitive, the evaluation of Terence by comparison with his models has not appreciably advanced our understanding of Terence's art. Readers who ap- proach the work of analytic scholars to seek help with such basic questions as what kind of play Terence wrote, what comic effects he sought, and how success- fully he achieved them may well be frustrated by the apparent diversion from Latin they can read to Greek texts known only by conjecture. Some may even come to believe with LUDWIG (33) that a play of Terence is "not an essentially new creation", simply because nobody has argued the contrary with equal force. The literary approach has provided little more help with the basic questions. Ap- peals to "The Laws of Comedy" and parallels with modern drama are rarely more valuable than a conjecture about Apollodorus of Carystus. Why are we no closer to an appreciation of Terence's art now than Leo was at the beginning of the century? We need to examine the current approaches to Terence, asking what contemporary criticism hopes to do and how it goes about doing it. The great strength of the analytic method is its close reading of the text. Even the objections to its results, often arising from the weight given points of detail, the interpretation of apparent inconsistencies, or assumptions about what a dramatist can and cannot do, go straight to central problems of dramaturgy. Thus Lefevre's early study of Terentian exposition (67) leads directly to the im- portant question of how the dramatist gets expository information to his charac- ters and audience. We need not share Lef&amp;vre's belief that the Greek exposition was centered in a prologue or agree with the content he reconstructs for it to learn much about what Terence himself has done. In more recent work, such as his studies of Heautontimorumenos (80) and Phormio (94), Lef6vre has extended his range but overtaxed his method. His interesting comments on Terence's con- cepts of character and motivation are based on increasingly strained discussions of the Greek originals and Terence's changes in them. The analytic method re- quires an intellectual discipline and attention to detail that often yields critical in- sights into the text, but it may also tempt its practitioners to mistake the possible for the probable and to weave webs of conjecture that are highly vulnerable to the application of Occam's razor. Analytic scholars of course are not the only ones who read texts closely. JOHNSON (107) and POSCHL (110), for example, offer readings of Adelphoe deeply rooted in what the characters do and say. They work from the context Terence provides without extended recourse to the structure he may have found in Menander. Their kind of criticism has a different value, and the fact that Johnson and Poschl disagree in their appraisals of Micio is indicative of its strength. Like any good play, Adelphoe is rich in characterization. The twists and turns that analytic scholars call inconsistencies are, for literary critics, the complexities that make a play interesting and even great. Johnson and P6schl gives us readings,suggested methods of performance. They do not try to tell us</page><page sequence="19">TERENCE AND THE FRAGMENTS OF ROMAN COMEDY 101 how it was done in Terence's day; that is a historical question on the order of how Richard Burbage played Hamlet and how Mrs. Patrick Campbell played Eliza Doolittle. In showing the richness of the text, Johnson and Poschl not only deepen our understanding of Adelphoe; they increase our respect for Terence as a dramatist. This kind of criticism goes beyond technique, getting closer to Terence's achievement as an artist. Literary criticism, however, is not without pitfalls of its own. Rigorous disci- pline is both the analyst's strength and limitation. Aesthetic judgments may come more easily to the literary critic, but there is sometimes difficulty finding the right support for them in the text. One source of this difficulty is the need to read between the lines of a dramatic text, to see the play as a work intended for stage performance. It makes excellent sense, for example, for BOHM (93) to see thematic significance in the exchange of money between Davus and Geta at the beginning of Phormio. Davus' debt does not figure in the plot, but the exchange requires enough stage time to command attention. Bohm's idea is supported not only by the text, but by the dramatic action the text requires. The same need to envision stage action causes problems for MCGARRITY (75), whose analysis of Andria makes much of Pamphilus, though Simo is the character who dominates the action. There are words in the text to support McGarrity's reading, but not the actions necessary to make the reading stageable. A related problem lies in the use of language to support discussions of theme and characterization. SAYLOR (91) may be justified in seeing "a peculiar dramatic focus" on the word consilium in Eunuchus, though it appears more often in Andria, a play 113 lines shorter. MALTBY (55) is surely right to identify adeo as a mannerism of Laches in Hecyra, who uses it seven times in sixty lines between 201 and 261, but what of propterea quod, used twice by Simo of Andria, and ut tempus est diei, twice by Chremes of Heautontimorumenos? Is this enough to suggest verbosity, as Malt- by thinks? In his great work on Plautus, Fraenkel made an important advance by finding significance in complexes of words such as military expressions and the language of Roman contracts. To draw conclusions from a single word or phase is less secure a practice. The discipline that the literary critic must impose on himself and his evidence becomes an important issue in a recent discussion of Phormio. SEGAL and MOULTON (96) sidestep the problem of Terentian originality with the practical argument that since everything in the play reflects Terence's decision to put it there, the text is essentially his own. They go on to make some fine observations, but there are also problems. Of the scene beginning at 348, for example, where Demipho enters with three friends to confront Phormio and Geta, they observe that "the stage teems with lawyers" and continue: "Indeed the advocati are farcical figures, lawyers gloriosi, traditional comic foolish 'professors,' like the dottori in the commedia dell'arte." The friends do advise Demipho on a point of law, but this glib progression from Roman advocati to the Bolognese Doctors of Law obscures an important fact. There are no lawyers, gloriosi or otherwise, in ancient comedy because neither the Greeks nor Romans had either the word or the concept. There are indeed quacks and charlatans like the oracle monger of Aristophanes' Birds and the sham physician of Menander's Aspis, but Roman advocati are not lawyers and therefore do not represent this comic type. The par- allel of the commedia dell'arte is false and misleading. Its introduction reflects a serious problem of method. Segal and Moulton are not taking Terence on his own terms. They, like some analytic scholars, are imposing an idea of comedy upon him, and the realities of the Roman comic tradition-philological and otherwise-go by the board. Their wish to see in the legal play of Phormio "a kind of Scipionic inside joke" is also weakened by ignoring historical realities. If, as some scholars now think, there was no "Scipionic circle", or if Terence was not part of it, their point is untenable. It must at least be argued with refer- ence to the current debate (see above, Section V. B.). The problem here is one of discipline, not knowledge. An excellent point underlies the discussion of Demipho's advisers, and Terence's legal joking may well have been topical. Real critical acumen runs throughout this article, but until literary critics come to</page><page sequence="20">102 SANDER M. GOLDBERG grips with the the ancient evidence itself and the fruits of modern classical philology, their insights will be of little use to others. VII. DONATUS Students of Terence cannot escape the influence of Aelius Donatus, whose commentary, abridged and corrupted over the centuries, is now cited from the Teubner edition of P. Wessner, Aeli Donati quodfertur Commentum Terenti, 2 vol. (Leipzig 1902, 1905). Donatus' references to Terence's Greek originals are crucial to the work of analytic scholars. His grammatical notes reappear in modern commentaries, and literary critics can find much of interest in his re- marks on stage action and character. Though full discussion of Donatus is be- yond the scope of this survey, the following works are of special relevance to the study of Terence. 113. Fraenkel, E. "Zur r6mischen Kom6die, I1."

Der Terenzkommentar des Donat im Codex Chigianus H VIl240. Berlin 1970. Three basic questions concern us: How accurate is our present text of Dona- tus? How secure is our interpretation of that text? How valuable is Donatus for understanding Terence? Establishing the text is complicated by the fact that between its composition in the fourth century and the copying of our earliest manuscript in the eleventh, the original commentary was abridged, excerpted, glossed, and recompiled. ZET- ZEL (119) demonstrates that several independent versions of Donatus' commen- tary circulated during this period. Textual criticism thus seeks the best possible version of a much-altered text; it cannot hope to restore the work as Donatus wrote it. Wessner's edition was a milestone, but it is not definitive. ZWIERLEIN (120), using only one manuscript, could suggest many improvements, and the wider researches of REEVE (116, 117) are laying foundations for a new edition. Reeve's work reveals both new evidence for the relative value of the manuscripts and serious errors in Wessner's reporting of their readings. The kind of difficulty editors face is illustrated in a small way by MARTIN (115), who must use the text of Terence to deduce what Donatus probably wrote. GRANT (114) and SANDBACH (118) seek answers in Donatus to old pro- blems of Adelphoe. Grant finds support for his belief that Terence has not ap- preciably altered Menander's ending, suggests an error in the note on line 275, and proposes an emendation for 323. Sandbach examines the possibility that Donatus wrote Terentius rather than simply poeta when he meant specifically that the Roman dramatist departed from his original. The distinction unfor- tunately does not stand, but Sandbach provides a useful compilation of all the passages in Donatus that bear on the problem and also a helpful bibliography. The testimony of Donatus, who sometimes compares Terence with his models, is invaluable for analytic scholars seeking to pinpoint that relationship. Pro- blems with the text and context of Donatus' remarks are frequent but can be dealt with, as GRANT (114) demonstrates. FRAENKEL (113) reveals a hidden difficulty where the text is sound. The appearance of Antipho at Eunchus 539 is</page><page sequence="21">TERENCE AND THE FRAGMENTS OF ROMAN COMEDY 103 widely assumed to be an alteration by Terence because of Donatus' remark, bene inventa persona est, cui narret Chaerea, ne usus diu loquatur, ut apud Menan- drum (ad 539). Fraenkel argues with his characteristic knowledge and skill not only that the ensuing dialogue between Chaerea and Antipho follows a Greek pattern, but that Donatus' Latin must mean, "It is well done to prevent one character from speaking too long, as well done as Menander." Fraenkel pro- vides ample parallels of Donatan usage to support this interpretation. If Fraen- kel is correct, an important piece of evidence for Terence's treatment of his origi- nal is reversed. Fraenkel has certainly demonstrated that Donatus' meaning is sometimes hardly more certain than his text. What is Donatus' value for modern readers of Terence? His grammatical com- ments have already been absorbed into our modern editions of the plays. His tes- timony for the Greek originals is limited, and further research may well limit it further. Zetzel's work on Latin scholia is beginning to challenge many en- trenched stereotypes. The implicit assumption that Donatus read Terence with full texts of Menander and Apollodorus before him is difficult to maintain. Donatus may well have known Greek comedy largely from abridgements and plot summaries. His comments on Menander's Phasma at Eunuchus 9, for ex- ample, may simply be an explanation of this unusual title, not the complete plot summary it is sometimes taken to be. Few of his comments require direct know- ledge of a continuous Greek text. This is a possibility worth investigating, and until such an investigation is undertaken, Donatus' knowledge of Greek New Comedy should probably not be overestimated. His commentary neverjheless re- pays reading. Donatus had a lively sense of theatre, and his comments on stage action and character rarely find their way into modern discussions. They are worth seeking out. On Gnatho's entrance at Eunuchus 232, for example, he ob- serves, "in hac scaena non stans sed quasi ambulans persona inducitur; constitit tamen aliquantum intuens spectatores, dum secum loquitur," a useful insight in- to the dramatic power, and thus the dramatic importance of this scene. He can also be good on character. Beneath a somewhat pedantic discussion of four types of stultitia at Eunuchus 446 is a shrewd evaluation of how harmless and even pitiful Thraso is, a crucial point for understanding the finale. Analysis of Gnatho's language at 1072 reveals a sensitivity to nuance unsurpassed in discus- sions of Terence's use of language. Similar comments can be found on the other plays. Donatus was a fine scholar who can still teach us much. VIII. SURVIVAL 121. Blansdorf, J. "Das Bild der Kom6die in der spaten Republik." In Musa Iocosa, U. Reinhardt and K. Sallmann edd.

Volcacius Sedigitus may well have rated Caecilius first and Terence sixth in his canon of comic poets on the basis of their relative stage appeal, but to Cicero some fifty years later Terence had gained new stature. In defending his own use of the phrase in Piraeea in a letter to Atticus, for example, Cicero offers an ex- cuse and an appeal to precedent: secutusque sum non dico Caecilium, "mane ut ex portu in Piraeum, " (malus enim auctor Latinitatis est), sed Terentium (cuius fabellae propter elegantiam sermonis putabantur a C. Laelio scribi), "heri ali- quot adulescentuli coiimus in Piraeum. . .'" (ad Att. 7.3.10). The passage is a useful reminder that Terence's appeal to later generations was primarily stylistic. Cicero's own fairly frequent references to Terence suggest the school room more</page><page sequence="22">104 SANDER M. GOLDBERG than the theatre. BLANSDORF (121) presents the evidence for dramatic produc- tions in Cicero's time; DUMONT (122) examines the rhetorical effect of his the- atrical references in the speeches. A more extensive survey by MARTI (124) re- views the evidence for Terence's popularity down to the time of Augustus, show- ing how Terence became a model for correct Latinity. The article ends with a helpful list of the testimonia for Terence's authority as a stylist. The more gener- al account of RONCONI (125) carries the history into later antiquity, including discussion of Fronto and the appeal of the pseudo-Plautine Querolus. The col- lection of material is useful; the discussion of Terence's attitude toward Plautus and toward his own contemporaries must be used with caution. JOCELYN (123) suggests that Priscian cited Republican drama from an alphabetically arranged edition of plays compiled by a late grammarian, though not necessarily by Pris- cian himself. This is a good reminder that our knowledge of ancient scholarly methods is incomplete. The way Terence was read in antiquity, and the expecta- tions, tastes, and interests of his readers were clearly not our own. Their evidence can be of great value for our own understanding of him, but we must neither for- get the differences between us nor let their opinions of Terence influence our own for the wrong reasons.

Because the earliest fragments of Roman comedy are among our earliest speci- mens of literary Latin, they figure prominently in studies of the origin of Roman literature, a subject with a considerable bibliography of its own. For such ques- tions as the dates and background of Livius Andronicus, the sources of Latin metrical practices, and the origin of dramatic cantica, see WASZINK (134), a full and sensible guide to a complex and controversial field. A less technical dis- cussion is BLANSDORF (127), which deals with such matters as the origins of drama, the various forms of dramatic entertainment, and the organization of the theatre at Rome. Literary questions will concern us here, in particular one basic question: What were the artistic capabilities of thepalliata tradition? The history of the Roman theatre provided by GRIMAL (130) makes clear the richness of the dramatic tradition, comic and tragic, at Rome, and the sophisti-</page><page sequence="23">TERENCE AND THE FRAGMENTS OF ROMAN COMEDY 107 cation of both poets and audiences by the time of Plautus. Grimal's earlier book, Le sicle des Scipions (Paris 1953) examined with great sensitivity the impact of Greek culture on the Romans and the synthesis of native and foreign material that produced their new literature. This approach to early Latin literature through cultural history is continued by WASZINK (133), who describes the struggle between the equation of "serious" literature with Greek traditions and the natural desire to Romanize. The resulting tension, manifest in the plays of Plautus and Terence, can also be read into the other Roman dramatists. ABEL (126) traces the Romans' developing concept of personality and ascribes the tur- moil of Terence's career in part to his audiences' difficulty in understanding his new concept of dramatic character. Increased knowledge of Greek New Comedy now makes a second approach feasible. HANDLEY (131) adds new and valuable support for a growing appreciation of the sophistication of the Roman audience. He shows how the conventions and topoi of Greek comedy found Latin equiva- lents in the plays of Plautus. Detailed discussion of Menander, Plautus, and Ter- ence enables FANTHAM (129) to illustrate the range of effects produced on the Roman stage, documenting her claim that Roman comedy "evolved as a new species, differing in almost every aspect of its art from the primary Greek come- dies." This welcome and increasingly common acceptance of Roman comedy on its own terms is beginning to yield a keener appreciation both of its divergence from the Greek tradition and of its own merits. The typology of Roman comedy is again receiving attention. Before the publi- cation of Dyskolos in 1959, the study of New Comedy dealt primarily with Latin plays. Fritz Wehrli's very fine Motivstudien zur griechischen Kom6die (Zurich 1936) examined such recurring elements as father-son rivalries, deceptions and recognitions, and inquired into basic questions of literary history, especially the origin of love plots and the influence of tragedy. Manfred Neumann, Die poetische Gerechtigkeit in der neuen Komodie (Speyer 1958), a Mainz disserta- tion written under Thierfelder, approached the theme of poetic justice through the pattern of rewards and punishments that come to the major character types. Both Wehrli and Neumann dealt more with themes than plots, and contributed to our understanding of the tastes and interests of the Roman dramatists. DEL- LA CORTE (128) now examines links between the new Greek material and the Latin plays. Other scholars have discussed the physical description of characters in dramatic texts and have attempted to identify the characters in Menander's plays with the forty-four masks described by Pollux, Onomasticon 4.143-154.5 Della Corte discusses this list and then uses the clues in the Latin texts to match Pollux' masks with the characters of Plautus, Terence, and the Latin fragments. He concludes with discussion of the philosophical theory that physical traits are an indication of character. The results are then summarized in tabular form. The broader work of LEFIVRE (132) seeks the essentially Roman qualities of both tragic and comic drama in Latin. He centers on questions of outlook (Weltbild) and structure. The scope of this inquiry lends the study a handbook-like quality, but Lefevre's willingness to deal with tragedy and comedy as a single unit com- mands special attention. His remarks on tragedy are particularly valuable and should stimulate further study of the concept of dramatic action as developed at Rome. The most important contribution of recent years to our understanding of the palliata is WRIGHT (39), previously cited for its chapter on Terence. Wright's chapters on the fragmentary playwrights are excellent, but the value of this book actually exceeds the sum of its parts. Wright argues that, with the exception of Terence, the writers of palliata comedies worked in a Latin tradition that deter- mined not only their choice of plots and characters from their Greek models, but s E.g., S. Magistrini, Le descrizioni fisiche dei personaggi in Menandro, Plauto, e Terenzio," Dioniso 44 (1970) 79-114 and W. T. MacCary, "Menander's Characters: Their Names, Roles, and Masks," TAPA 101 (1970) 277-90. For the difficulty in applying Pol- lux' evidence to the texts of New Comedy, see A. W. Pickard-Cambridge, The Dramatic Festivals of Athens, 2nd ed. (Oxford 1968) 177-80.</page><page sequence="24">108 SANDER M. GOLDBERG their diction, meters, and the form of their humor. The chapter on Caecilius is decisive. Scholars since Ritschl have seen in Caecilius an intermediary between the Italian boisterousness of Plautus and the Hellenistic subtlety of Terence. Wright demonstrates that Caecilius was actually a playwright squarely in the tra- dition of Plautus, while a later chapter showing the stylistic affinities of Turpili- us, the last writer of palliatae, with the Latin mainstream confirms the isolation of Terence. The importance of all this for our understanding of comedy at Rome can hardly be overestimated. Wright sheds new light on the question of Roman originality by showing how the Roman dramatists drew inspiration not only from Greek poets of the past but from their own continuous, living comic tradi- tion. To identify a tradition as Wright has done is not to condemn its practition- ers as unimaginative. The "stylistic unity" he identifies does not deprive the Ro- man writers of art. The chains of tradition, to borrow the image Wright borrows from Nietzsche, linked each dramatist with both his predecessors and his audi- ence. They formed a bond that it was in nobody's interest to sever, and Wright's study of that bond-already foreshadowed in the work of Leo, Fraenkel, and Duckworth-creates a new basis for the appraisal of the Roman comic achieve- ment.

One area where Wright may exceed the limits of his evidence is in his identifi- cation of the Collegium poetarum as an official body responsible for both the at- tacks on Terence and the strength of the palliata tradition itself. A great deal re- mains unknown about the Collegium in Republican times, though some recent work may provide evidence for Wright's suggestions. JORY (137) reviews the evidence for professional associations from the time of Livius Andronicus to the empire; HORSFALL (136) concentrates on the later period. Important basic re- search has also been done on the details of theatre organization. JORY (138) de- molishes the notion that dominus gregis was a technical term for an actor- man- ager and the inference that actors were generally slaves. Two appendices in GARTON (135) list with full citations the names of actors known from Republi- can and Augustan times; a chapter on Roscius includes useful information on conditions of stage performance, at least in the time of Cicero. Fusion of Wright's insights into the literary material with the growing body of technical in- formation would be desirable. C. Authors 139. von Albrecht, M. "Zur Tarentilla des Naevius."

Warmington, Remains of Old Latin in the Loeb series provide ready access to the comic fragments of Ennius and Caecilius, Livius Andronicus and Naevius. This is a good edition of the text with a helpful translation and notes. Caecilius and Turpilius are now available in new editions. GUARDI's Caecilius (143) includes an introduction, Latin text with contextual and critical notes, and a final section with Italian translation and commentary. There are also indices of meters and words, and a concordance to the third edi- tion of 0. Ribbeck, Scaenicae Romanorum poesisfragmenta (Leipzig 1897-98), still the text of reference. The admirable Teubner edition of Turpilius by RY- CHLEWSKA (145) opens with an excellent discussion of both the dramatist and his text that includes a bibliography of modern scholarship. The fragments themselves, given in the order of Ribbeck's third edition, are provided with criti- cal apparatus, information on sources, and appropriate parallels from other au- thors. An index verborum completes an excellent volume. WRIGHT (39) now provides the standard discussion in English of the frag- mentary writers of palliatae. There are chapters on Livius Andronicus, Naevius, Caecilius, Turpilius, and Minor Comic Poets. Bibliography is thorough to about 1971. Four chapters in GARTON (135) deal with Luscius Lanuvinus, including sound information and a great deal of speculation about Terence's antagonist. GRIMAL (142) suggests that the controversy between Terence and his rivals concerned style more than content. Terence consistently avoided the broad ges- tures and song of his contemporaries and thus presented a quieter kind of com- edy. ROCCA (144) examines the canon of Volcacius Sedigitus as preserved by Aulus Gellius (15.24), raising anew the possibility that the verse Caecilio palmam Statio do comico should read either mimico or mimicam. TRAINA (147) is actually a collection of articles, all but one (on Accius) pre- viously published, that deal with aspects of "translation" in early Latin litera- ture. Three chapters concern us: one associating Naevius 106 R 3 with Philemon fr. 133K, one discussing Caecilius' manner of adaptation as revealed in the parallel texts of Plocium preserved by Aulus Gellius, and one on Terence as a translator. Traina unfortunately takes no account of the fragment of Menan- der's Dis Exapaton, the original of Bacchides 494-562, published by Eric Hand- ley in 1968 except in footnotes acknowledging its existence. The volume lacks a coherent view of what "translation" meant to Roman dramatists, and one can- not escape the suspicion that it is not really an appropriate term to describe what they were doing.6 The discussion of parallel Greek and Latin passages tends to be subjective, and the collection as a whole fails to make a real contribution to a subject badly in need of elucidation. Much periodical literature concerns Naevius, whose apparent controversy with the Metelli has long attracted scholarly interest. WRIGHT (148) discusses the lack of support for reading this feud into the comic fragments, showing how verses from Tarentilla often thought to contain a reference to Q. Caecilius Me- tellus are more likely to preserve simply a piece of traditional, non-political com- ic boasting by a clever slave. SCHAAF (146) deals with another biographical problem, arguing that the traditional date of Naevius' death was based less on firm information than on a desire to keep Naevius and Plautus a generation apart in the history of Roman comedy. Two articles deal with the interpretation of fragments. VON ALBRECHT (139) takes patres of Tarentilla fr. 12 as a vo- cative, and believes that only line 76 of Ribbeck's fragment 2 should actually be ascribed to Naevius. BADER (140) sees in Naevius' Acontizomenos a dramatic situation parallel to the supposed deaths of characters in Menander's Aspis and Misoumenos and, using the evidence of known titles and plots of New Comedy, suggests that Tarentilla is more likely not to have been set at Tarentum. He also offers an internretation of Corollaria 37. 6 Cf. S. Brock, "Aspects of Translation Technique in Antiquity," ORBS 20 (1979) 69- 87.</page><page sequence="26">110 SANDER M. GOLDBERG GRATWICK (141) discusses a fragment from the Boeotia ascribed to Aquilius (1-9 R 3) in the light of Alciphron, Ep. 3.1. Both Varro and Gellius, who has pre- served the comic passage at NA 3.3.3, thought the play Plautine, and Gratwick uses the long-forgotten parallel from Alciphron's parasite-letter to demonstrate with a high degree of probability that Menander's Boeotia was its Greek origi- nal. Further discussion of sundials at Rome reveals that modern scholars have judged the fragment to be post-Plautine for insufficient reasons. Gratwick un- covers an interesting chain of scholarly ignorance and error that has obscured the relationship between Alciphron's own Greek source and the Latin Boeotia. X. THE FABULA TOGArA The comedies performed in Roman dress that are associated with the names Titinius, Afranius, and Atta have recently aroused new interest. We know this kind of comedy only from fragments and titles in literary sources and can infer a little more from a substantial body of ancient testimonia. The nature of the evi- dence has suggested two lines of inquiry: the definition and place of the genre in the history of Latin literature; and the literary study, usually comparative, of the fragments themselves.

RecPhL 2 (1968) 63-92. TABACCO (150) surveys work on the togata from 1833 to 1972. By discussing both the scholarship itself and the ancient evidence upon which it is based, he provides a guide useful for scholars working on the history of the togata and for general readers requiring an introduction to it. A serious problem for historians of Latin literature has been definition of the genre. An old article reprinted as Appendix B of BEARE (149) pointed out that the terms togata and palliata gained currency, though not uniform application, only in later antiquity. The grammarian Diomedes (or his source) could trace them no further back than Varro: togatae fabulae dicuntur quae scriptae sunt secundum ritus et habitum togatorum. . .sicut Graecas fabulas ab habitu aeque palliatas Varro ait nominari. (GLK 1.448. 16-18). This lack of widespread, consistent usage, a point now developed at greater length by USSANI (151), affects both our estimation of the grammarians' evidence and our view of the creative process in the early Republic. Thus for Seneca, as USSANI (152) shows, togatae were simply native Latin plays, tragic as well as comic (cf. Sen., Ep. 8.8, 89.7). Even if we restrict the term to the Republican cQmedies that portrayed the domestic affairs of Italian families, we do not know how free the dramatic form was from the con- ventions already established by the writers of Palliatae. VEREECKE (153) makes a strong case for dating Titinius, the traditional founder of the genre, to the time of Plautus, and suggests that palliata and togata flourished side by side for the better part of a century. This chronology raises the possibility of genuine artistic interchange, of a shared comic tradition, and has important implications we must now examine. B. Literary Study 154. Cacciaglia, M.

The most convenient English introduction to the literary problems of the togata remains Chapter 15 of BEARE (149), but there has been significant new work. CACCIAGLIA (154) reviews the biographical information on each au- thor and then turns to the dramatic motifs discernible in the fragments. Love and marriage seem to predominate, although no plots can be reconstructed. DENES (155) probes the popular appeal of the genre. He observes that the characteristic fantasy of the palliata gave it a universal quality, while the Italian settings and costumes fixed the fabula togata in a time and place. In addition, easier communication between the sexes and the different family structure of Roman society made the plot mechanisms of New Comedy unnecessary. Never- theless, POCINA PItREZ (156) claims that the Romanization of the togata was only superficial, and important evidence supports him. The growing belief that Titinius was roughly contemporary with Plautus in- evitably affects the relationship scholars perceive between togata and palliata. As POCISA P1EREZ (157) states, these were not alternative forms of comedy, the one arising to compensate for the decadence or increasing erudition of the other, but parallel forms that shared an audience and a style. Pocifia may well be right to see in the comedy pioneered by Titinius a new variant on a popular, established comic formula. LEO (32) had long ago suggested stylistic affinities between togata and palliata, and VEREECKE (158) now details the similarities in vocabulary and syntax between the fragments and the plays of Plautus. Afranius a Latin Menander (Fin. 1.7; Ep. 2.1.57). Cicero and Horace are prob- model and had admired Terence (25-29 R3). Both Cicero and Horace called Afranius a Latin Menander (Fin. 1.7; Ep. 2.1.57). Cicero and Horace are prob- ably both thinking primarily of style, but something can be said about dramatic technique as well. Afranius' Compitalia seems to have had a polemic prologue of the Terentian type. A fragment of his Incendium suggests an intrigue plot. . . .servus est mihi Nicasio, sceleratus curiosus, is cum filio coiecerat nescio quid de ratiuncula. (189-91 R3) This sounds like the expository speech of a senex, and its content as well as its vocabulary is easily paralleled in the palliata. Donatus' well-known remark that in the togata slaves could not be more clever than their masters probably means not that togata plays did not have intriguing slaves, but only that their masters were more clever than they. Other comic fragments suggest the street scenes, eavesdropping, creaking doors, self-important slaves, and family quarrels that were the stock in trade of Roman comedy. The readiness to incorporate these de- vices into new plays testifies both to the versatility of the palliata conventions and to the shared values of Roman dramatists and audiences. CONCLUSION 159.

At the Northwestern University Summer Drama Festival two years ago a pro- duction of Terence's Eunuchus, which unwisely tuirned Thais into Mae West and Phaedria into Cary Grant, prompted a reviewer to remark, "Unless the Romans were extremely hard up for entertainment, I can't understand why they thought the play was funny." Injudicious productions are always regrettable, but where could this director have gone for guidance? Precious little in the scholarship sur- veyed here would contribute to wiser decisions or answer the reviewer's implied question. Terence wrote plays for production, not courtroom speeches or who- dunits, but our scholarship too often ignores his medium and his genre. As a re- sult Terence is often praised and blamed for the wrong reasons. This is doubly unfortunate. First, it deprives outsiders of the critical insights that can only come from those studying Roman drama in Latin. Not only directors of summer drama festivals, but scholars in related fields have been misled by stereotyped views of Roman comedy, views classicists have done little to dispel.7 Second, we ourselves denigrate Roman drama because it was popular entertainment, and thus pay insufficient attention to a vital link between Roman culture and our own. We forget that the significance of Plautus and Terence in the history of Western drama outweighs whatever literary merit we assign them. FOREHAND (160), who speaks with the voice of experience, offers practical advice for incorporating Roman comedy into general courses in translation. He observes that Plautus and Terence are paradigmatic for the way Roman writers of all times used Greek models, and he recommends such plays as Amphitruo, Aulularia, and Adelphoe for introducing students to Roman intellectual move- ments, social issues, and literary techniques. This is good advice, though the cul- tural lessons cannot be severed from the literary form. Both CALLIER (159) and SERBAT (161) suffer from taking the raw material of social history out of its context. Callier examines the significance of such words as vis, contumelia, rex, and iniuria in the scene Terence interpolated from Diphilus without testing his conclusions against the possible distortions of dramatic necessity. His approach to this scene makes an interesting contrast with FANTHAM (102). Serbat's more general discussion of Terence's relation to the life of his time admits that the mir- ror he holds to life is highly selective. The image of life a play presents comes in code, and the key to the cipher lies in the techniques of drama.8 Though scholars sometimes fail to perceive this, students succeed with remarkable ease. Forehand reports their inability to respond to the question "Why is this funny?", but that is because the question has forbidding metaphysical overtones. "What about this is funny?" or "Why is this scene here?" work much better because they focus at- tention on technical, answerable questions concerning the components and re- quirements of play-making. Similarly, students approach the question of Ter- ence's relationship to his models with real intelligence when they have read Menaechmi and The Comedy of Errors and have seen for themselves what one dramatist can do with the work of another. Comedy is a convenient bridge between Roman culture and our own. So much ancient literature is strange to us, so much requires a carefully cultivated re- sponse, that we should welcome an ancient literary form with close modern parallels, one whose techniques and devices are so familiar that even the novice can appreciate the skill with which they are employed. Much work needs to be 7 T. W. Baldwin, Shakespere's Five-Act Structure (Urbana 1947); D. Radcliff-Umstead, The Birth of Modern Comedy in Renaissance Italy (Chicago 1969); and L. Salingar, Shakespeare and the Traditions of Comedy (Cambridge 1974) would all have been strength- ened by a better understanding of Roman comedy. 8 For the operation of this cipher see S. M. Goldberg, The Making of Menander's Comedy (Berkeley and London 1980) 114-20.</page><page sequence="29">TERENCE AND THE FRAGMENTS OF ROMAN COMEDY 113 done. Both the bridge and its approaches need exploring, and the job is worth doing. Roman comedy is neither the most intellectual nor the most refined form of ancient literature, but it is among the most alive. Our idea of theatre is a Ro- man idea, and study of the latter can tell us much about the former. ADDENDA III. TEXT CRITICISM 162. Rosivach, V. J. "Terence, Heautontimorumenos 205."

He argues that qui of 205 is ablative, homo = "the man we've been talking about" (in this case, Menedemus). This interpretation refines ideas of Scaliger which in turn go back to Eugraphius, and Rosivach sees a lesson in this for modern interpreters and emendators of the text of Terence. V.

"Plautus, Cist. 231-49: Dialogue-Scene Substituted by Plau- tus for New Comedy Monologue?" CJ76 (1981)312-17. Study of Terence's iambic octonarii leads RAFFAELLI (165) to see a metrical evolution from Plautus to Terence. SIMON (166) studies Terence's use of the terms contaminari and furtum in an important article that prefigures Kujore (43). Some very fine new work examines aspects of Terence's dramatic technique. GILULA (163) begins with a penetrating and succinct survey of the social role of hetaerae and concludes that Donatus, writing centuries after the fact, has mis- led us with his phrase bona meretrix. The only kind of meretrix found in Ro- man Comedy is actually the mala. Gilula then examines each meretrix in Ter- ence, with particularly provocative discussions of Thais in Eunuchus and Bac- chis in Hecyra. Her conclusions will startle many, but must command the respect of all. In an earlier article (64), Gilula had demonstrated her ability to read a dra- matic text closely. Now (164) her acumen brings into question Lindsay's interjec- tion in the Oxford text of a saltatio convivarum after HT 170. Lindsay, follow- ing a suggestion of F. Skutsch, saw a vacant stage at this point largely because he was looking for signs of the choral act break in Terence's Greek model. Gilula argues that there is no need to assume an empty stage here and thus no reason to import a band of revelers. ZAGAGI (167) sees a Menandrean monologue behind Plautus' dialogue at Cistellaria 231 ff. Typical of the new trend in technical studies is Zagagi's willingness to address the implications of such a demonstra- tion, in this case the long-held belief that the substitution of dialogue for monologue is a hallmark of Terentian originality.</page><page sequence="30">114 SANDER M.

Reality in Terence's Hecyra." CJ 76 (1980-81) 149-56. BROTHERS (168) begins with discussion of HT 4-6, in which Terence seems to claim his play, ex integra Graeca, has nevertheless made a simple plot into a complex one. Brothers reviews the old textual argument over these lines, then searches for signs of contaminatio to explain Terence's meaning. He has inter- esting things to say about the roles of Bacchis and Antiphila. Nowhere in this long, copiously annotated article, however, is reference made to such recent work on this play as Lefevre (80) and Steidle (82), and Brothers' contribution to our overall understanding is thus substantially less than it might have been. CALBOLI (169) contrasts the two midwife scenes of Andria 228-230 and 481- 488 to launch a new analysis of the contamination issue in this play. Careful, precise reasoning and excellent notes support his view that Terence reworked his original to concentrate dramatic attention on Simo. GRANT (170) deals with the roles of Syrus, Ctesipho, and Sannio and the prologue of Adelphoe to recon- struct a Menandrean first act more careful in its use of offstage action and its presentation of Vorgeschichte than what we find in Terence's play. Two articles deal with Hecyra. KONSTAN (171) is concerned with why audiences and later critics have not usually liked the play. He focuses on Pamphilus, showing that in the conflict between amor andfides, amor does not come out well, and remarks that "when the resolution of the play arrives, we are not altogether certain, per- haps, that it is deserved, or that we really want it." MCGARRITY (172) believes the introductory scene between the two meretrices establishes the theme of repu- tation versus reality and the danger of judging by reputation. The reputation of Bacchis is quickly shown to be false; Pamphilus' true character emerges slowly. McGarrity's view of Bacchis must now be weighed against Gilula's (163). IX-X.

BROWN (173) notes that the soldier Thrasonides' vigil in the cold that opens Misoumenos has a parallel in Afranius, Epistula fr. 1. DAVIAULT (174) adds his voice to the growing number of scholars who are beginning to claim little sub- stantive difference between togata and palliata comedies. He observes that the term fabula togata was used with considerable looseness by the ancient writers on comedy. This apparent looseness is supported by the work of LOPEZ (177), who compares Diomedes' definition of the togata (GLK 1.488-89) to the general uses of the adjective, which could apply to all types and social classes of Italians except soldiers.</page><page sequence="31">TERENCE AND THE FRAGMENTS OF ROMAN COMEDY 115 GENTILI (175) is a translation of Lo spettacolo nel mondo antico: teatro el- lenistico e teatro romano arcaico (Rome and Bari 1977), a lively little work that deserves wide circulation in this English version.
