<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology in Iraq KHALED NASHEF A regular feature of AJA is Machteld Mellink's "Archaeology in Anatolia" newsletter, but a newsletter covering archaeological activities in Iraq is not only a novelty for AJA, but also for any American archaeo- logical journal. This necessitates some introductory remarks. There has been little interest in Iraq among Amer- ican archaeologists in the last decade or two, perhaps because of the scarcity of information available. Now, however, after a difficult war-time experience, Iraq is putting all its efforts into pursuing several pivotal projects aimed at reactivating and achieving its devel- opment goals. Among the current cultural projects are the restoration activities at Babylon and NimrUd, to mention just two. Work at the latter site has already led to the sensational discovery of what is probably the tomb of the wife of Sargon II and her sister, containing an extraordinary hoard of gold jewelry (see infra). One of the purposes of this newsletter, which will now also become an annual feature of AJA, is to draw the attention of American archaeolo- gists to a country extremely rich in archaeological remains that are, in a broad sense, part of the com- mon cultural heritage of mankind. Another practical purpose is, of course, to give the readers of AJA an overall view of recent archaeological activities in the country. The scope of the reports compiled in this first newsletter is from the Prehistoric to the Islamic period and I treat the cultural heritage of Iraq as a unity in time and space. In subsequent newsletters I hope to include, as I have done elsewhere,' reports also on TURKEY Hamad Agoa a 4 ,,a Al, H IWO-&amp; / Yirim Tepe Hb;i H.; aI-Mawqd i Nimrad Irbl Aiiu~ { SYRIA lt SUI-RA IRAN *.K o. , - ?'?-..,.-. .01,,Nippur ARABIA \ Basra 0 50  SKM -""/ , . *.? ..o.-? o .. / -."-. _._ I Cf. one of my earlier newsletters on activities in Jordan: AfO 33 (1986) 148-308.

A remark concerning the transliteration of modern site names, mostly Arabic, is necessary. No agreement has been reached among archaeologists concerning the problem of transliterating Iraqi place names. I have adopted here a compromise solution. When used by the archaeologists themselves in their reports, I have left the name forms as they have been transmit- ted to the excavators by local inhabitants. On the other hand, in the headings of each section of the newsletter, I have employed the "correct" form, that is, the form as it would be in Classical Arabic, and I omit the word "Tell" (=artificial hill) that occurs in some cases. Finally I wish to express my thanks to all the exca- vators for providing the reports published here, as well as to K. Westney (Tiibingen) who corrected some parts of the English text of this newsletter, to C. Forrest (Riyadh) who patiently read and corrected the manuscript, and to E. Porada and the editors of AJA for reviewing and editing the final manuscript before publication. Abui Duwiri. Elizabeth C. Stone reports: "Survey and Excavations at Tell Abu Duwari, 1987- 1989. Tell Abu Duwari is a large, low mound located some 30 km due north of Nippur (fig. 1). It has minor occupations of the Akkadian, Ur III, and Parthian periods and probably also of the Uruk period, but was a major urban center only during the Isin-Larsa and early Old Babylonian periods. Textual material recovered from the site proves its identification with ancient Mashkan-shapir, second capital in the king- dom of Larsa, major trading entrepot located on a link between the Tigris and Euphrates systems, and city of sufficient stature to be mentioned in the pro- logue to the Code of Hammurabi.

"Work at Abu Duwari has concentrated on recov- ering as much as possible of the urban plan through contour mapping, surface survey, and analysis of both kite photographs and a SPOT (Le Systeme Pour L'Ob- servation de la Terre) image of the area. Some surface clearance has been undertaken and soundings dug to investigate the ability of surface traces to predict be- low-ground features. "This program of research has succeeded in iden- tifying the probable location of the four canals that divided the city into five sectors, and that of the two harbors that were located where the east and west canals joined the main, northern, channel. These ca- nals divided the city into five major sectors and seem to have represented significant boundaries within the city (fig. 2). "The southern sector has been identified as the religious quarter based on the mud-brick and baked brick platforms found there, and on an associated group of terracotta statuary, similar to that found at Isin, but in this instance consisting of humans, lions, and horse. Across the south canal was the cemetery, characterized by many surface traces of burial jars and a high frequency of objects normally found in graves, such as jewelry, weapons, stone bowls, and cylinder seals. "Separated once again from both temple precinct and cemetery by canals was the palace, located in the southern portion of the west mound.

Plan included the storage, living, and manufacturing areas that are typical of other second-millennium Mesopo- tamian palaces. The most common surface finds from this area were fragments of terracotta chariot models. "The rest of the area surveyed to date-incorpo- rating most of the northern portion of the west sector and most of the central area-appears to have been residential in character, consisting of scattered wall fragments associated with household objects such as clay plaques and tools of all kinds. Another charac- teristic of these presumed residential areas is the pres- ence of evidence for scattered manufacturing in the form of concentrations of cuprous slag and kiln wasters. These two residential districts-in the west and central sectors-were joined by a pair of quays or a bridge. In addition to the concentrations of burials noted in the area designated "the cemetery," more evidence of burial was found in these areas, but here brick tombs rather than burial jars are the norm. "A city wall has been traced around the north, south, and east sides of the site, and three gates iden- tified. Associated with the south gate were found nearly 150 fragments of Sin-iddinam's barrel cylin- ders commemorating the construction of the wall of Mashkan-shapir. That identification had already been partly confirmed by the analysis of the satellite image, which showed that the city had been watered by a large channel which, some 12 km north of the site, arose from the confluence of two watercourses, one bringing Tigris water, and the other being the eastern- most branch of the Euphrates.

Abu Habba. A summary of the paper delivered by Walid al-Jadir at the XXXVIe Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale, 10-14 July 1989 at Ghent, is printed here with the permission of the author. "Recent Excavations at Sippar. The Iraqi expedition at Sippar under the direction of the Department of Archaeology (College of Arts, University of Baghdad) uncovered at the site an extended temple dated to the Neo-Babylonian period (fig. 3). Some parts of the temple were excavated during the eighth season (1985-1986). As a result of the present campaign (1988-1989) it was possible to reveal a complete groundplan of the temple complex. As has already been described elsewhere,2 a library consisting of 56 shelves containing cuneiform tablets was found in Room 355. The expedition uncovered numerous units of the building in addition to the outer wall measuring 2.50 m wide. Whereas libn was used as building material for the latter, bricks were used for another adjacent wall measuring 1.70 m wide at one part and 1.40 m at another. "The temple, dating to the Neo-Babylonian period, exhibits three construction phases, the earlier and the main one dating to the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II. 2 On this extremely important discovery (the first library found in situ in ancient Iraq), see W. al-Jadir, "Eine neuba- bylonische Tontafelbibliothek in Sippar," in K.

An Achaemenid Residence of the Fourth Century B.C. (10 km to the NNE of Sippar).3 Following a first campaign, in 1986, devoted to a supplementary excavation at the defensive wall built by Nebuchadnezzar to the north of Sippar (.Habl a*-Sahr in fig. 4), the Swiss Archaeological Mission in Iraq (MASI)4 has set itself the mid-term goal of at- tempting to refine the stratigraphic sequence of the Achaemenid and Neo-Babylonian periods in this area of the alluvial plain. It was to this purpose that Sector F was opened in the western part of AbU Qubur South, where surface finds indicated, among other things, an Achaemenid occupation.5 "It soon became clear that the rows of walls visible on the surface belonged to a roughly square structure with a groundplan of approximately 46 m2 (fig. 5). The building forms an insula, as no other wall abuts against its outer face.6 It follows fairly exact north/ south and east/west axes. Since all structures emerge 3 A preliminary report of this campaign will appear in Northern Akkad Project Reports 3 (1990), published by the University of Ghent, St. Pietersplein 6, B-9000 Ghent, hence- forth abbreviated as NAPR. 4 The MASI was created in 1986; it is entirely financed by the Fonds National Suisse de la Recherche Scientifique. The results of this new excavation are published in NAPR 2 (1989) 23-70. See also NAPR 1 (1987) 3-46 and Iraq 46 (1984) 125-29 for the results obtained during earlier work on this site by a Belgian-British expedition. 5 A sounding was carried out in 1985 in the northern sector of Abfi Qubfir by the Belgian Mission of Tell ed-Dir (see Akkadika 47 [1986] 6-23). The uncovered remains be- long to the Old Akkadian period (Sounding A), perhaps also to Ur III (Sounding C) and to the early second millennium B.C. (Soundings C, D [?], and E). With the exception of Sounding A, all remains lie in and/or are covered by thick alluvial sediment. For the complex deposits found in Sound- ing B, see M. Gibson, Akkadika 47 (1986) 15 and 20. In the course of surveying the site in this region, R.M. Adams, in M. Gibson, The City and Area of Kish (1972) 192 had already noticed important structures in the western sector of Abfi Qubfir South. 6 The northern corner of a much later building, probably from the beginning of our era, slightly intrudes into the southern sector of the Achaemenid residence; these walls have a completely different orientation. A part of this struc- ture can be seen in the upper part of fig. 5.</page><page sequence="7">1990] ARCHAEOLOGY IN IRAQ 265 on the surface of the tell, it was possible to determine the entire groundplan after simply removing the up- per layer of soil from the top of the hill. "The entrance lies to the north. After crossing an L-shaped room (no. 1 in fig. 5), one gained access to a small court (2) which was in turn connected to the large central court (4) by Room 3. The central court gave access to all parts of the structure; it also displays an interesting feature: it is flanked both to the north (6) and to the south (5) by a reception hall, the larger of which (5) has a width of over 6.50 m. Each con- tained four pillars, symmetrically arranged in pairs at the long ends of the rooms, thus leading to a tripar- tition of the halls into a large central space--over 100 m2 for Room 57-and a small rectangular recess at each end. "This architectural design appears for the first time in Early Elamite houses of the first half of the second millennium B.C. at Susa;8 it is not attested at any other site during this period. It is furthermore not known in the Middle Elamite period, not even in Susa, where the remains of this epoch are admittedly rare. It does, however, reappear in Assyria in the seventh century B.C., although it had previously not been known in this area.9 Somewhat later, the design was again taken up in the Achaemenid palace structures of Susa, Persepolis, and Lachish. In Babylon, the four pillars-just as in Susa-serve to partition this type of reception hall, which always lies to the south of the western court in the South, North, and Summer Pal- aces, dated by R. Koldewey to the Neo-Babylonian period. The findings of Abu Qubur will allow us to reexamine the history of this architectural element while reconsidering the attribution of certain palace sectors in Babylon to the Chaldeans. "However that may be, the construction of a four- pillared hall both to the north and to the south of the central court in the residence of AbU Qubur is an innovation. It might even constitute an intermediary stage of development between the older design-- where the hall in question is found only on one side of the court'--and the more recent one, where there is an iwan (?) on several if not on all sides of the court. "The excavation of the residence of Abu Qub-ur has brought to light a number of clues that seem to suggest that this structure was never used, at least not continuously, by those who commissioned its con- struction. Indeed, most of the occupation levels in the rooms consist of deposits and include fixtures that speak strongly in favor of open-air spaces. Consider- ing the finds, it even seems probable that we are dealing with a structure occupied by one or more groups of craftsmen. This situation perhaps illus- trates, in its own way, the socioeconomic conditions under which the Persian occupation of Babylonia ended, before the conquest by another foreigner: Alexander of Macedon. "Chronologically speaking, the following clues may be considered: the deposits dating later than the last occupation of the structure contained nine identical tetradrachms of Mazaios and one drachma of Alex- ander. All these coins are silver, show little trace of wear, and were struck between 328 and 311 B.C. The occupation of the structure might thus theoretically have extended down to about 330 B.C. The oldest possible date for the building of the structure is fur- nished by a fragment of a clay tablet-found just between the foundation pit and the underlying de- posits-written in the year 14 of Darius I. We thus arrive at a time-frame of approximately 500 to 330 B.C. in which the structure was built and occupied, regardless of what type of occupation this might have been. The finds, however, allow us to place one or more occupations in the fourth rather than the fifth century B.C. The pottery, obviously found in large quantities, belongs still to an Achaemenid tradition while already displaying so-called Seleucid character- istics. It is now possible to maintain that a fair number of the small stamped decorations, generally consid- ered to be typically Seleucid, were already in common usage well before the end of the Achaemenid period. An intact stamp, with one of the most common pat- terns mounted on each end, unfortunately came from an unexamined stratigraphic context. "The location of the site in the vicinity of ancient Sippar-Annunitu, its occupation in Persian and Neo- Babylonian times, as well as the very strong imprint of a typically Susian form of architecture in the Achae- menid residence weigh rather in favor of the identi- fication of Abu Qubur with the Alu-Sa-?u"Ane from the time of Cyrus, a suggestion put forward by G. Giovinazzo."''" 7 The walls of Room 5 were partially destroyed by pits dug after the abandonment of the residence, but the four pillars were definitely identified during the excavation cam- paign of 1988. 8 See IrAnt 5:2 (1965) 93-102.

L. de Meyer provides this report: "Tell ed-Dir 1987-1988. Since 1985 the efforts of the Belgian Archaeological Mission in Iraq have been devoted to the uncovering of Middle Babylonian re- mains at Tell ed-DUr, the stratigraphical sequence of this period still being largely unknown. A rapid sur- vey, already carried out in the early 70s, showed that the architectural remains of this period generally lie above the elevation mark of 38 m asl.'2 Several sound- ings were carried out in different sectors and all re- vealed large disturbances due to Achaemenid and more recent tombs, late Middle Babylonian pits, and even illicit digging activities. "The 1987 Excavation Campaign. Sector E3 was finally singled out for an attempt to gain the desired information. The small sounding begun in 1985 was enlarged in 1986 and attained approximately 500 m2 by the end of the 1987 campaign. Here as well, un- fortunately, the above-mentioned disturbances con- siderably slowed down the pace of work. Dozens of tombs-some of which, especially those of the third and fourth centuries B.C., are not lacking in interest- and several large pits filled with late Middle Babylon- ian pottery have led to the disappearance of much of the remains still lying in situ. The careful excavation of the latter nevertheless enabled us to distinguish two superimposed phases of Middle Babylonian pri- vate dwellings that should probably be attributed to the 14th century B.C.'3 Underneath the remains of this period appears a deposit of a complex nature representing the time of abandonment and reaching back to the 17th century B.C., to which the underlying structures belong. These were probably destroyed by fire, as was the House of Ur-Utu, galm-ihu of the temple of Annunitum.14 "The 1988 Excavation Campaign. The continua- tion of the Middle Babylonian program proved to be extremely costly. The efforts of the 1988 campaign focused on a project that we had wished to carry out for a number of years, but which depended on a relatively good knowledge of the stratigraphic se- quence of the site. It entailed, as opposed to a deep 12 The contour line of 38 m on the topographic plan recently published in Akkadica 47 (1986) and in Mesopota- mian History and Environment, Memoirs 1 (University of Ghent 1989) plan 6 gives a good impression of the relatively small importance of the site at this time. A certain amount of erosion, the extent of which cannot as yet be evaluated, should however be taken into account. 13 A preliminary report on the remains and finds of this sector is currently under preparation and will appear in NAPR 4. 14 Cf.

The chosen sector lies on the western slope of the hill, at approximately 100 m to the south of Sector A.15 "A surface area of roughly 1500 m2 was marked out for this first undertaking in Sector F (fig. 6). The removal of the upper layer of soil soon made it pos- sible to recognize structures that-on the basis of comparisons with the material found in the House of Ur-Utu (destroyed by fire in the year 17+b of Am- misaduqa) and in the upper levels of Sounding A (the occupation of which dates to around 1700 B.C.)- may be attributed to the first half of the 17th century B.C. In some rooms, the occupation levels had been preserved by erosion; it is the material found on these that has enabled us to put forward the proposed chronological frame. "The results obtained in the course of this first clearing of the site's surface may be considered very satisfactory. Although this type of excavation does not always make it possible to explain fully certain archi- tectural details, it is nevertheless clear that the future enlargement of this sector will quickly furnish us with a concrete picture of an urban quarter in Tell ed-Der during the 17th century B.C., a time that still remains quite obscure in many respects. This period appears to have witnessed great building activity in the north of the alluvial plain, although the country's economy was in a disastrous state. Could this building activity be due to the northward flight of the inhabitants of the south whose lands were progressively lost by Bab- ylon after the 10-12th year of Samsuiluna?"'16 (ramdat Nagr. R.J. Matthews reports: "Excavations atJemdet Nasr, 1988. A new series of excavations at Jemdet Nasr, about 100 km south of Baghdad, commenced with a season from October to December 1988. Work was directed by R.J. Matthews for the British Archaeological Expedition to Iraq. The aims were twofold: first, to locate and investigate areas of the two mounds previously explored in the 1920s- and never satisfactorily published-and second, to explore previously untouched areas of the mounds. "Surface clearance on Mound B revealed an exten- sive complex of walls within recent silt deposits, clearly filled-in trenches from the work of Langdon and Watelin in 1926-1928 (fig. 7).

Future work will include the excavation of intact areas of this building. "Adjacent to this area we located extensive Early Dynastic I deposits, including a large burnt rubbish dump lying against a solid brick mass which is likely to have been the platform upon which the adminis- trative building stood. From this dump a good collec- tion of Early Dynastic I pottery and clay sealings was excavated. These artifacts date from the very begin- ning of the Early Dynastic period in central Mesopo- tamia, forming a distinct break from the material culture-in particular, the pottery-of the immedi- ately preceding period of the large administrative building. "Other work included the clearance and investiga- tion of a baked-brick building on the summit of Mound A, of Neo-Babylonian or later date (fig. 9). Underlying this structure, intact Middle Uruk depos- its are in evidence. "Work on Mound B in 1989 was intended to inves- tigate the transition from the Late Uruk to the Early Dynastic I periods, in an attempt to determine whether or not a specific material-culture assemblage can be assigned to a transitional "Jemdet Nasr" pe- riod."

Sketch plan of the site "The site of Tall Hamad Aga as-Sagir is located in the northern Sinjar plan ca. 40 km due north of the city of Tall Afar. It is, after the sites of Tall Hawa and Tall Hamad Aga al-Kabir, one of the largest sites in the North Sinjar plain. It measures 225 m from east to west and ca. 250 m from north to south. The southern and western sections of the mound are ap- proximately 18 m above the present level of the plain. A citadel is located in the northeastern corner of the site. It is roughly 80 m in diameter and rises to a height of 27 m (fig. 10). "After making a survey of the area in 1985 we decided to ask permission to excavate Tall Hamad Aga as-Sagir since its surface was covered with painted Ijabur ware pottery and since no evidence was found dating to a period after the occurrence of this ware in North Mesopotamia. Furthermore one could ob- serve on the surface of the southern slope of the citadel the remains of a large stone fortification wall.'8 During the second campaign in 1988 our main efforts were concentrated on an investigation of the citadel. Our objectives were twofold: first, to open up a large horizontal section in order to reveal the settlement pattern; and second, to excavate a vertical section by means of a step-trench in order to establish the strat- igraphical sequence of the site. "In the middle of the southern slope of the citadel we opened up a section covering 175 m2. In this section we encountered four levels reaching to a depth of 2.50 m. All four levels contained architectural re- mains; however, only the buildings in the third and fourth levels were well preserved. In the lowest, fourth level we came upon a large architectural con- struction consisting of three units that were built onto one another. The main feature of each unit is a large elongated rectangular room measuring 6-8 by 3-4 m. At the end of one of these rooms a square hearth made of burnt clay was located in the middle of the floor. In the corner of another room we uncovered the stone foundations of a couch-like structure and 18 p. Spanos (supra n. 17) fig. 15.</page><page sequence="12">270 KHALED NASHEF [AJA 94 Fig. 11. Hamad Aga as-$agir. Clay nail next to the door of this room we observed in the mud brick wall the remains of two columns. The mudbrick walls of all three units were coated with a white plaster and the floor of the third unit was covered with a layer of white lime. "The pottery from all four levels is UIabur ware. In addition to the usual small finds, clay figurines, metal pins, etc., we also found an example of a clay nail (sikkatu) of unusual shape (fig. 11). "Directly behind the section of the stone fortifica- tion wall which we excavated in 1986 we opened up a step-trench extending from the stone wall to the center of the citadel. The trench was 3.50 m wide and had a length of 22.50 m. In all we observed 15 levels in this step-trench and there were architectural re- mains in each level (fig. 12). From the first level to the ninth level only UIabur ware was present. According to our observations, the pottery in the upper levels was decorated with simple painted bands and, in the lower levels, circles, triangles, and other motifs were more abundant. In regard to the shapes of the vessel, the pottery tended to become more fine in the lower levels and in Levels 6 to 9 the very fine walled shoul- der-vessel was predominant. UJabur ware was also found in Levels 10 to 12. In these levels, however, we also found sherds, and a few vessels which were made out of a very fine-tempered, green-colored clay. The shapes of this pottery are characterized by small ves- sels with beaded rims. This pottery was first observed in Tall Taya and our results in Tall Hamad Aga as- Sagir confirm the pottery sequence observed there by J. Reade.19 (It should be noted, however, that we found a few sherds of the "Tall Taya" ware decorated with a cream-colored paint.) After Level 12 there were only a few sherds of the IUabur ware and the pottery was not characterized by painted designs. In the low- est levels reached to date there appeared a fine tem- pered "Stone ware." The shapes of these vessels resemble those of the "Tall Taya" ware; bowls, how- ever, are more frequent. This pottery is made of a clay varying in color from red to light brown to light green. It differs from the clay of the "Tall Taya" ware in that a very fine sand was used for tempering. Owing to the means of production, the various colors of the clay appear separated on the surface and produce a banded-like decoration. This pottery is not provided with a slip. "Among the small finds from the step-trench a clay figurine in the shape of a bear deserves mention (fig. 13). It is decorated with red painted stripes and was found on the floor of Level 6. "We continued to excavate the stone fortification wall encircling the citadel and were able to follow it northward along the eastern slope. A tower was lo- cated on the outer face of the wall at its junction with the north. "In the Fall of 1989 we planned to conduct a study campaign at Tall Hamad Aga as-Sagir and will carry out a third campaign in 1990." Hamida. Paul Zimansky reports: "Excavations at Tell Hamida, 1987. Tell Hamida is a 23-hectare site (fig. 14) at which the most significant period of occupation was the third quarter of the second millennium B.C. It is located in Iraq's North Jazira, between the towns of Uwainat and Rabiyah, 1 km south of the road and railroad that connect them. In 1987, irrigation projects in the area threatened the site and prompted the author and Elizabeth Stone to initiate a program of surface survey and excavation there from 15 June to 11 August. Labor and logistical support were provided by the Iraq Department of Antiquities, to whom we are most grateful. "The tell is distinguished by three eminences, the largest of which is a nearly conical mound rising 7 m above plain level. Two hundred meters northeast of this there is a smaller and lower rise separated from the large mound by a shallow saddle. North of both there is another rise with gentle contours forming an east-west ridge that covers an area of slightly more than four hectares. "The first phase of research consisted of a mapping and ceramic surface survey. A grid of 50 x 50 meter squares was laid out along a magnetic north-south/ east-west axis passing through a concrete bench mark at the top of the high tell. There was little significant variation in the density of the sherd cover over the entire site, except that it was low in the area between the northern and southern tells and unexpectedly 19 J.

It is not clear whether these densities have any correlation with what is to be found under the ground, or merely reflect factors of erosion and movement across the surface through repeated plowing. On the southern Fig. 13. Hamad Aga as-$agir: Clay figurine of a bear eminence, however, there was significant clustering of the squares showing the highest percentage of painted wares. All of the diagnostic painted sherds we found at the site belonged to various categories of Ijabur ware. "Groups of 5 x 5 m excavation units were opened in two locations: nine squares on the south tell ("Op- eration 1") and four on the smaller hillock northeast of it ("Operation 2"). In the latter area the foundations of an early Parthian or late Hellenistic building were found quite near the surface, below which were early first millennium remains. In Operation I none of this later material was found and the sherds from the plow zone to the lowest points we reached this year were consistently in the mid-second-millennium tra- dition. Although architecture was poorly preserved, we were able to distinguish five relative sequential phases. "Pottery from Operation 1 generally fell into the category that David Oates has called "late Khabur/ early Nuzi" dating roughly to 1650-1550 B.C. Shoul- der vessels with thin bands of paint on their rims and upper bodies were common, as were cups, chalices, and pedestal bases.

Contour plan of Tell Hamida reddish brown, sometimes deepening to a dark pur- ple. Simple bands of monochrome paint were by far the most common form of decoration. If "Nuzi" ware is broadly defined as sherds with white painted dec- oration on a dark painted background, then there was Nuzi ware in all phases of Operation 1. Much of this, however, was simply dark red bands with white spots painted on them, and the occasional "Union Jack" pattern of the white lines on a black background. The really ornate Nuzi ware of floral patterns, rolling spirals, etc. did not appear in Operation 1, although one such piece was found out of context in Operation 2. Also relatively rare were representations of birds, which numbered only three. "What was most surprising about Tell Hamida was the general ubiquity of animal figurines among the small finds. In all, we discovered 49 figurines and figurine fragments in excavation survey (e.g., figs. 15- 16), of which only four were anthropomorphic. The association of these with the main southern mound was also pronounced; of the 13 animal figurines found on survey, 12 came from that mound and one from the north mound. The correlation between these and the primary concentrations of the late Ha- bur/Nuzi ware pottery is thus highly suggestive even without the additional testimony of excavation. An- other interesting aspect of these animal figurines is the predominance of zebu cattle. Among the animals that can be identified, zebus outnumber all other species put together two to one. This is hardly what one would expect in an area where zebus are not found today." al-Hawa. Warwick Ball furnishes this account: "The Tell al-Hawa Project.

The second opera- tion is the excavation of Tell al-Hawa. This is an immense site, dominating the plains for miles around (figs. 18, 19). Work so far has been primarily con- cerned with tracing the evolution of the site and sur- rounding area, from its origins in the Late Neolithic period and its eventual growth into one of the first cities in the north in the earlier Uruk period in the fourth millennium. Tell al-Hawa reached its greatest height, however, in the Akkadian and "Habur" period in the late third millennium and the centuries follow- ing, when it became a major urban center. After this, Tell al-Hawa probably became the Assyrian provincial capital of Tillule, a position it maintained until its final collapse at the fall of the Assyrian Empire in 612 B.C. The site then remained abandoned apart from occa- sional minor Hellenistic and Islamic occupation. "Excavations so far have uncovered parts of a zig- gurat and other monumental buildings of the second and first millennia on the Acropolis, but an intensive survey of the surface (carried out by David Tucker) and series of soundings and area excavations have produced important information on parts of the ear- lier residential areas in the Lower Town as well. Most of the excavations, however, have been concentrated at the high southern end of the Acropolis, Area A26. This area seemed an obvious choice: it was tentatively identified in the 1986/1987 survey as a possible Neo- Assyrian citadel, and it was here that most of the Late Assyrian pottery was found, as well as many inscribed wall cone fragments and most of the Mitannian pot- tery. Altogether, it seemed the most promising area to yield monumental architecture and worthwhile re- sults in a short time. This "promise" was dramatically fulfilled on the very first day of excavation in the second season with the discovery of an inscribed wall- cone fragment bearing the name Shalmaneser (III), confirming a date in the ninth century B.C. Subse- quent excavations have revealed parts of the temple- ziggurat complex, probably dedicated to Adad ac- cording to textual evidence. A large number of high- quality Late Assyrian stone, ceramic, shell, and metal objects have been found in this complex, including quantities of fine "Palace Ware," several stone mace heads, part of a ceramic rhyton, a serpentine lid with a lion carved on it in high relief, and many more cuneiform texts, mainly in the form of inscribed dec- orative wall-cone fragments. The overall ceramic ev- idence, however, suggests that the complex was founded in the Middle Assyrian or Mitannian period in the mid-second millennium, and was substantially added to in the Late Assyrian period.</page><page sequence="17">1990] ARCHAEOLOGY IN IRAQ 275 Fig. 19. Tell al-Hawa from the west "The area surrounding Tell al-Hawa is the site of extensive new development work. Much of the Re- gional Program's activities, therefore, are concerned also with investigating areas that are threatened by large-scale construction, making a full record of the archaeological remains in the area before they are altered or even completely destroyed. During 1986 and 1987, a total area of 220 km2 of flat alluvial lowland was surveyed, with the following features being recorded: 1) 92 sites, ranging from small, one- period mounds to large multi-period centers, and ranging in date from the ceramic Neolithic period to Late Islamic; 2) Sherds spread as a low density "field scatter" across the terrain between sites, interpreted as resulting from the spreading of settlement-driven fertilizer of the nearby fields; and 3) "Hollow ways," representing ancient route systems worn down by the passage of men and animals. These are of all periods and from both local route systems radiating from individual mounds and inter-regional systems that cross the terrain, mainly from southeast to north- west. "In 1988 the Regional Program concentrated on specific issues by carrying out soundings at three sites: Tellul al-Biyadir, an ancient gypsum quarry; Tell Hilwa, a small Later Uruk and Ninevite V site; and Khirbet Khanjdan, a small but particularly rich Ubaid site." JI-Ii. Christine Kepinski reports: "Tell KhosilHuwaish Djebel Sinjar. Located in north- west Iraq, Djebel Sinjar consists of rows of very eroded hills, some of which display an abrupt relief and cul- minate at a height of more than 1250 m. All along the southern edge lies today an agricultural area, fertilized by waters running down the Djebel. Many archaeological sites are situated in that plain. "Sixty-eight sites, dating from the Neolithic to the Islamic periods, were plotted during a survey carried out in 1938 by Seton Lloyd on behalf of the Liverpool Institute of Archaeology. The aim of that survey was to establish relationships between the Habur area ex- plored in 1934 by Mallowan and by the Tigris zone. At Tell Khoshi, Lloyd gathered some sherds that he thought belonged to the third and second millennia B.C. In his opinion, Tell Khoshi and Tell Hadhail, another fortified site of the Sinjar, must have succes- sively or simultaneously had control over a state in- cluding other sites of southern Sinjar, whereas Tell Abu Mariya would have been the main city of a state represented by tells located between the Djebel and the Tigris.21 "In 1939, Lloyd came back to this area, carried out 21 S.

This building would have been destroyed during the third millennium B.C. "Since then, archaeological activities have not stopped, and have extended into Syria, in the Habur area. Few investigations took place in Iraq on histor- ical sites of southern Djebel Sinjar, apart from the very important excavations of Tell el Rimah and Tell Taya in the 1960s. Founded around 1800 B.C., Tell el-Rimah contains well represented Mitannian levels as well as remains of the Middle and Neo-Assyrian periods. Apart from that site, another British team worked at Tell Taya, southeast of Tell Afar, in 1967 on a citadel dating back to ca. 2300 B.C. Recently, the British Archaeological Expedition to Iraq (cf. the con- tribution of W. Ball, supra) started to work on a new site, Tell al-Hawa, in northern Sinjar. "The new excavations from the Lower Euphrates salvage program, and the investigations at Ebla, as well as those in the Habur area, illustrate the settle- ment expansion, the wealth of certain centers, and the construction of important fortified cities that marked the second half of the third millennium B.C. Most of these centers lasted, even after frequent de- struction, through part or all of the second millen- nium, and then disappeared. It was necessary to add to the work performed at Tell al-Hawa the results one could obtain from the excavations of another site in 22 S.

This is the reason why we decided to conduct the exploration of Tell Khoshi. "During May 1989, we carried out a survey of the site: a topographical map (fig. 20) as well as a surface collection of sherds were made. Located 14 km south of Beled Sinjar, Tell Khoshi is a fortified oval city, 1150 m long and 800 m wide, roughly oriented north- south. To the northwest, the citadel is comprised of two higher tells, about 20 m high. The lower town had its buildings preserved to a height of 6 to 12 m above the outer level. As for the city wall, it is pre- served to a height of 8 to 10 m. "Sherds from the main tells of the citadel provided us with very homogeneous data, from the Akkadian period to the mid-second millennium B.C., such as metallic wares, incised common and fine wares from the Akkadian period, Ur III wares ornamented in relief with figures, but also grey and painted Habur and Nuzi wares, with a large percentage of Habur wares. We did not recognize any older sherds (no Ninevite V, for example). This led us to reconsider Lloyd's dating: in fact, some of the sherds he thought to belong to the Ninevite V period are Akkadian incised ware (fig. 21).23 Some grey ware sherds that he dated to the end of the third millennium are actually Habur ware. "The lower town is relatively flat. To the north, two 15-m deep excavations were dug some years ago by local farmers: the first one, to exploit subterranean waters by means of a pump, the second one to reach the pump by a staircase. Today these two large pits are no longer in use and are completely impracticable. From the top, nevertheless, we could see very clearly the succession of three floors, each covered with 10 cm of sherds. Situated at 1.75 m below the surface, the more recent one does not seem to belong to the same construction level as the two others, respectively at 3.85 m and 4.75 m under the highest preserved level of the tell. By contrast, the two older floors display the same horizontal limits in the section, and would belong to the same building or at least to two levels constructed on the same plan. Five meters un- der the surface, nothing very clear appears, and the tunnel linking the two excavations is dug through virgin soil to date these different floors; we can only rely on surface ceramics, which include, once more, Akkadian, Habur, and Nuzi wares. "The south of the tell is slightly less high and one finds, on the slopes of the defensive wall, strong con- centrations of common, incised Akkadian ware. To the north and to the south, two large depressions used Fig. 21. Tell Khoshi. Akkadian wares by the modern track might correspond to city gates. "The site does not seem to be older than about 2500-2400 B.C. Nevertheless, a more ancient settle- ment would partly justify the height of the two tells to the northwest: the site would not, by then, have been larger than 5 ha and its further extension to 90 ha would date back to the mid-third millennium or shortly after. These conclusions, of course, are far from being definitive: they are directly affected by the limits of a surface survey. Moreover, our knowl- edge of the different wares is rather vague since they very often represent exceedingly long spans of time and can help us only partly to identify the collected ceramics. "The results obtained during this survey provide us with good clues for a first season of excavation, which we hope to be able to carry out in 1990. We know almost nothing about what may have been the status of Sinjar during the third millennium B.C., or of its relations with southern Mesopotamia and all of its closer neighbors. Neither do we know much of the role played in the first part of the second millennium B.C. by the realms of Upper Mesopotamia, Eshnunna, or Babylonia, and their relations with Hittite Anatolia, or later by the Mitannian empire, which must have controlled this area. "This new project should help us to understand the emergence, during the third millennium, of large walled cities. One should also be able to define what these small realms, which depended on large centers, were. Finally, the excavation of Tell Khoshi might be a key for explaining the specificity and organization of a stratified city, its material culture as well as its relations with neighboring cultures, and, by contrast, its eventual dependence on a larger state or empire." 23 Lloyd (supra n. 21) fig. 6, VIII.2, 12.</page><page sequence="20">278 KHALED NASHEF [AJA 94 60N 50 N _8o460 Sxxf up* soup *Go *m ..

Many bricks with the inscription "The Palace of Enlil-bani" gave some ad- ditional hints to expect a more important building. "Just below the surface some plans of houses could be discerned; unfortunately they had been heavily destroyed by later graves. Two different levels of building activity were observed. The doorways of the broader older walls had subsequently been filled with bricks and used as the foundation of another house. A long wall extending in Areas II and III which had been part of a huge building was partially destroyed by adjacent houses constructed later. In order to ob- tain proper measurements of the first large building, seven other areas were excavated. "The southern outer wall of the building extended to about 25 m in the neighboring areas. From that wall several small square rooms and two bigger ones-- each with a drain-were grouped around two court- yards. The excavation of this building was continued until the end of the campaign. Altogether it covered five areas, each eight meters square, with a total mea- surement of 18 m x 15 m. In the eastern part of this building, we found a rectangular room at one side with a small brick construction (possibly a tomb) con- taining Old Babylonian pottery and a bronze artifact representing human figures and caprids (fig. 23). Fi- nally, at the southwestern corner a staircase was dis- covered, which obviously was used to enter an upper part of the building. "To the north of this huge building we discovered a second one, which must have been an earlier con- struction, because its foundations reached a deeper level with a gap between them. At the eastern side a later pit around a drain contained Kassite pottery. In the western part of the large building, some houses were directly set against the wall, dating to an earlier and a later phase. On the floors of the houses several fragmentary bullae with sealings were found. In ad- dition, we excavated three more areas in order t6 expose the second large building. The complete area of this building, covering 22 m x 15 m, was excavated. The latter had basically the same structure as the first large one and was also surrounded by houses. "Altogether two well-preserved adjacent buildings were uncovered. These must have been of some im- portance because of their broad walls (ca. 1.50 m). They were not built at once, but tightly connected together. "Unfortunately just a few inscribed finds were found. They mention deliveries of a brewer and a scribe of the king Urdukuga, which, in addition to the cylinder seals and the pottery, point to a date in the earlier Old Babylonian period (First Dynasty of Isin). These buildings could well belong to the eco- nomic areas adjacent to the palace which should be located near the excavated areas. Among the other small finds worthy of mention are two cylinder seals and more than 10 terracottas with unusual motifs. "During this season the so-called "Castle" located in the western region was also investigated. It is of remarkable size (100 x 100 m) and it surrounding walls are still preserved to a high level. At the highest point a trench (25 x 2 m) was cut to get an idea of the function and the date of the building. This trench revealed a huge gate with a collapsed arch. The struc- ture was probably built in the early Islamic period using a vast amount of bricks from various places of ancient Isin (Urnammu-Nebuchadnezzar II)." Walter Sommerfeld appends this report: "The In- scribed Finds from the 1989 Campaign. Only a few cunieform texts were unearthed, all dating to the Old Babylonian period. In the excavated area the frag- ment of a cone of King Damiq-ililu was found, in addition to five mostly destroyed school tablets. Of more importance are some sealed bullae that were probably attached to some deliveries, mentioning a brewer and a "royal scribe" of King Urdukuga. "In the so-called "Castle," a building probably dat- ing from the early Islamic period, more than 70 bricks were found in the trench and on the surface. These Fig. 23.

With the excep- tion of Ur-Nammu, who was not attested at Isin be- fore, all the mentioned rulers are well known from recent excavations at Isin. "The author has conducted a survey of all brick inscriptions found at the surface in order to obtain a better understanding of the various building activities at the ancient site. The survey covered about 60,000 m2 in the east and north of the Gula temple and revealed bricks dating to the Ur III (Amar-Sin) and Old Babylonian (mostly Enlil-bani) periods." Nineveh. David Stronach provides the following report: "Excavations at Nineveh, 1989." Following a brief pilot campaign in 1987, the spring of 1989 saw a full-scale resumption of excavations at Nineveh. The work was sponsored by the University of California at Berkeley with further support coming from the National Geographic Society, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Foundation, Columbia University, and the Iraqi De- partment of Antiquities and Heritage. "On the southeast flank of Kuyunjik, the venerable core mound of Nineveh, a vertical-sided gully in Area KG provided more or less direct access to certain otherwise deeply buried deposits. Here a number of late third-millennium strata were found to be associ- ated with a double stone wall that may represent an early city wall, and, in one more limited exposure, our deepest probe to date reached at least two levels with Ninevite V incised wares. "Elsewhere on Kuyunjik, operation KS allowed us to reexplore the bit nakkapti, one of the last buildings erected by Sennacherib (705-681 B.C.), the ruler who elected to transfer the capital of the Assyrian empire from Khorsabad to Nineveh. Here we encountered the base of an inscribed lamassu and the wheel-rutted surface of an adjacent stone-paved gateway, together with parts of three hitherto unrecorded bas-reliefs. "In keeping with the aims of a project designed in part to explore the nature of early urban settlement in northern Mesopotamia, two intramural sectors of Nineveh's little tested Lower Town were also exam- ined. Operation NWM revealed the small-scale dwell- ings and industrial installations of a crowded artisans' quarter while a second locality, Area MG (which lies almost in the shadow of the north face of Kuyunjik), appears to be representative of a more elite quarter of the seventh century Assyrian city. "New soundings were also introduced at the Halzi Gate, the southernmost gate in Nineveh's long eastern wall. Excavations at this point revealed some of the largest and finest limestone masonry that can be as- sociated with the reign of Sennacherib. At the same time, however, the partial destruction of the whole central portion of Sennacherib's original stone facade, and its subsequent hurried repair, would seem to speak for a preliminary, unsuccessful Median attack on at least one of Nineveh's main gateways. A plau- sible date for such an attack would be the year 614 B.C.-a year that saw an invading Median force cap- ture A''ur and overrun all or part of Nimrud. "This last repair did not restore the gate to its original form. In the expectation of a further assault the Assyrians took care to narrow the width of the only external entrance from seven to two meters. Even this precaution, however, was not enough to resist the force of the final attack delivered two years later. "Inside the doorway, and beyond a hastily installed blocking stone, the few meters of the central passage that have been excavated so far have revealed the skeletons of some nine individuals who died a violent death, presumably as they struggled to either hold or take the gate. In all, more than a dozen bronze or iron arrowheads were found in the immediate vicinity of these overlapping skeletons, along with the remains of a dagger, a spearhead, and a pike. It now looks not unlikely, in short, that further work at the Halzi Gate-as well as at yet other gates-will in the end provide a quite detailed picture of the measures that were taken by both defenders and attackers during the last days of Nineveh." NimrUd. The following is a summary of an anon- ymous article, "A Unique Golden Hoard Jingles to Awaken the Second Assyrian Capital" (in Arabic), which appeared in al-Watan al-Arabi 16:116 (2 June 1989) and of L. Barkho, "The Latest Secrets of Nim- rud," The Baghdad Observer 6885 (25 May 1989).25 After 70 days of continuous work at Nimrfid (ancient Kalhu) in 1989, Iraqi archaeologists discovered an outstanding golden hoard (figs. 24-26). It was found inside a vaulted chamber tomb with an arched brick door,26 in which the 40-year-old Queen Yabaya and her sister Taliya were buried. Gold jewelry, as well as copper, ivory, and glass objects were spread all over the two bodies. Altogether, the gold weighs more than 25 kg.

Mr. Muzahem Mahmoud Husain, the field archaeologist at Nimrtid and discoverer of the grave, states that a similar grave of an Assyrian princess, located not far from the present one, had been uncovered in 1988. Dr. Abulillah Fadhil, an Assyriologist in the De- partment of Archaeology at the University of Bagh- dad, transcribed the inscription engraved on a marble stone that was deposited with the two bodies. The stone measures 26 x 20 x 0.5 cm and has 25 lines of cuneiform text. It reads: "In the name of ?amas and the Anunnaku, I, Yabaya, the woman of the palace of Sargon, King of Dir-Sarrukin, King of Assyria, have met my destiny, leaving the world along the paths of my fathers." The funerary inscription also contains several invocations to the gods of the Netherworld for vengeance on anyone disturbing the grave. The hoard itself consisted of 10,000 small pieces of jewelry,27 119 large items, as well as an abundant 27 Most of the pieces (about 20 kg of gold) seem to have been worn by Yabaya.

Gold jewelry from the Tomb of Yabaya (after al-Watan al-cArabi, 2 June 1989) assortment of bottles, goblets, pots, and toilet articles. Most outstanding among the objects is a golden crown in the shape of a fillet ornamented with golden flowers and a headband woven of gold mesh with attached medallions enclosing precious stones. The rear part of the headband is connected to a similar 50 cm-long band, which hung down the back while the headband was being worn. Among the many gold items worth mentioning are two anklet pairs on the feet of the ladies, both identical in form, but one smaller than the other. In addition, the hoard contained an orna- mented chain, which seems to have been newly man- ufactured. There were also necklaces with gold almond-shaped pendants. A gold bottle attached to a golden chain was found placed within the hands of the queen. Also discovered were a large number of small bottles and numerous earrings, some bell- shaped. One of two gold goblets bears an inscription stating the descent of the two ladies. Two cups of fine glass were also discovered, one bearing the phrase: "These two princesses are the Fig. 26. Nimroid. A necklace from the Tomb of Yabaya (after al-Watan al-cArabi, 2 June 1989) daughters of Sargon, King of Assyria." The tomb also contained dozens of small golden items, such as nee- dles, combs, buttons, almond-shaped pendants, jugs, flower-shaped ornament pieces, and a large number of marble bottles. Nippur. M. Gibson reports: "The Oriental Institute's Excavation at Nippur, 1988- 1989. The Oriental Institute's Nippur Expedition, with support from the National Geographic Society and the Smithsonian Institution, carried out two extremely productive operations in 1988-1989 focus-. ing on two critical transitions in Mesopotamian history, from Early Dynastic to Akkadian (ca. 2350 B.C.) and from pre-Islamic to Islamic times (ca. A.D. 600). "In the main operation ("WG"), Parthian, Sassan- ian, early Islamic and Abbasid strata were uncovered. Pottery bowls with inked incantations in Aramaic and Mandaic were found dating to the early Islamic pe- riod. In the upper levels, coins were found dating to the early Abbasid period. "In Area "WF," beneath Seleucid, Achaemenid, Neo-Babylonian, Kassite, Old Babylonian, and Isin- Larsa period levels, a house from the Ur III period was uncovered that demonstrates for the first time the use of plano-convex bricks in that period. "In the Akkadian levels, a house with a similar floorplan was exposed that contained large amounts of pottery and numerous copper and bronze objects,</page><page sequence="25">1990] ARCHAEOLOGY IN IRAQ 283 Nisibin Tell Leilan SYRIA *Tell PROJECT / al-Hawa AREA Tell Brak ai Tell Afar MoIsul Nineveh 0 50 Km S&gt;3000Ft.

North (;azira. T.J. Wilkinson supplies the following account: "The North Jazira Project: 1986-1988. The North Jazira plain in northwestern Iraq forms a triangular area of some 750 km2 between the Sinjar Hills to the south, the river Tigris to the northeast, and the Syrian border to the northwest (fig. 27). The area is currently being developed for a massive irrigation scheme that will eventually cover this area of extensive ancient occupation with a network of canals, pipelines, roads, new settlements, and related agricultural complexes. "Figure 28 shows the total settlement pattern of 90 sites recorded over an area of some 220 km2 during 1986 and 1987. The prime ancient settlement, Tell al-Hawa, which physically dominates the plain, had attained a maximum size of 30 m high extending over 70-90 ha by the later third millennium B.C. Excava- tions in 1987 and 1988, by Warwick Ball for the British Archaeological Expedition to Iraq, have begun to reveal traces of "Akkadian" and "Khabur" period buildings, as well as parts of a Middle and Late As- syrian religious complex.28 Excavations within the hin- terland of Tell al-Hawa, conducted by the author and David Tucker also for the British Archaeological Ex- pedition to Iraq, have investigated Late Uruk and Late Ubaid domestic settlements as well as a possible Islamic gypsum quarrying complex. "Two other types of evidence have been examined to complete the archaeological landscape: 1) Sparse, but consistent spreads of pottery ("field scatters") ex- tending over the entire plain surface at densities mainly between 20 and 60 sherds per 100 m2 (stippled 28 Ball, Tucker, and Wilkinson (supra. n. 20, Iraq 1989).</page><page sequence="26">284 KHALED NASHEF [AJA 94 30 P 2 .73 .. . ......

Modern road 0 1 2 3 4 5Km Fig. 28. The North Jazira Project: Archaeological sites, hollow ways, dry valleys (wadis), and field scatters mapped in 1986 and 1987 in fig. 28). The scatters have been mapped over some 100 km2 (360 sample squares) and are tentatively interpreted as resulting from the spreading of settle- ment waste, dung, "night soil," and kiln waste on fields surrounding the settlements.29 This was presumably to raise crop yields in this area of rain-fed cultivation (ca. 350 mm annual rainfall) during phases of high population density. 2) Straight, shallow valleys, ap- parently discordant to the original drainage network, radiate from or link sites, and in some cases form major alignments across the entire area (e.g. from Uwaynat to Tell al-Hawa, and beyond, fig. 28). Such "hollow ways" result from the prolonged passage of people and animals along roads and tracks. "The aceramic and early ceramic site of the Ginnik (site 21 in fig. 28), excavated by Stuart Campbell of Edinburgh University, has provided the first evidence of sedentary settlement on the plain. During the sub- sequent Hassuna period, at least nine small agricul- tural settlements were present within the area of figure 28. This rapid increase in settlement may have been assisted by the construction of wells and water- holes, of which one was excavated by Stuart Campbell at Late Hassuna/Samarran Gar Sur (Site 39 in fig. 28). "Dispersed rural settlement prevailed during the sixth and fifth millennia B.C., but by the fourth mil- lennium (Uruk period) the large urban settlement of Tell al-Hawa had developed. This appears to have attained its maximum size during the late third and early second millennia, after which, around the mid- second millennium, it appears to have diminished in size. During the third and early second millennia, the rural community appears to have occupied 10 to 12 small satellite settlements that attained their maxi- mum number during the Ninevite V (early third mil- lennium) and Khabur (early second millennium) periods and had virtually disappeared during. the intervening "Akkadian" period (later third millen- nium). At the time of maximum settlement during the third and early second millennia, small towns developed at Kharabeh Tibn (Site 43), and Abu Kula, some 10 km distant. These too had satellite rural settlements, but these were fewer in number than around Tell al-Hawa. Although there was a revival of 29 Wilkinson (supra n. 20,JFA 1989).</page><page sequence="27">1990] ARCHAEOLOGY IN IRAQ 285 settlement during the Late Assyrian period, when a large number of small rural settlements were occu- pied, the urban centers appear to have diminished in size. A similar, but fluctuating and progressively dwin- dling pattern of settlements prevailed during the later first millennium B.C. and the first millennium A.C. "A preliminary conclusion that can be drawn from the three field seasons is that the peak in development of the Early Bronze Age urban settlement system appears to have coincided with the maximum inten- sity of land use as inferred from the distribution of "field scatter" between sites." Qermez Dere. Trevor Watkins provides this report: "Rescue Excavations at Qermez Dere. Qermez Dere is a small settlement site in northern Iraq of the Final Epi-Palaeolithic and early Aceramic Neolithic periods. It has been under investigation since October 1986 by a multi-disciplinary team led by Dr. Trevor Watkins of the University of Edinburgh, Scotland. The site had been seriously damaged by a series of pipe and cable trenches and is now being swamped by the rapid expansion of the town of Tel Afar. It lies about 60 km west of Mosul in the southern foot-hills of the Jebel Sinjar range. The excavations were undertaken at the suggestion of the Iraq Department of Antiqui- ties and Heritage as an urgent salvage operation. After a short sounding season in October 1986 (su- pervised by Dr. Ellen McAdam),30 the first season of excavation took place in Spring 1987,13 and a second season in the Spring of 1989.32 "Since most of the site has been destroyed or irre- trievably damaged the excavation strategy has been to study small surviving areas with techniques of max- imum control and recovery. The part of the site that was used for domestic occupation is finely stratified and the accumulated deposit of about 1.5-m thickness has been described in terms of seven phases (plus superficial, unsealed deposits). Detailed analysis is in progress on a sample of chipped stone amounting to about 25,000 pieces (fig. 29), a large and excellently preserved faunal sample, and a small and hard-won botanical sample of carbonized plant remains. The preliminary indications are that the inhabitants of Qermez Dere harvested a range of cereals (einkorn and barley) and legumes (especially lentils and vetches), gathered pistacchio nuts and hunted a broad spectrum of animals (ranging from wild cattle and equids, through gazelle, sheep, and goat, to fox, fe- lines, and hare, plus many small mammals and a variety of species of birds). At present there is no evidence of cultivation of plants or of the domestica- tion of animals. "The site seems to divide into two distinct zones. At the center and on the east side there is no evidence of built structures, but, especially in the center of the site, considerable remains of communal plant-food processing.

Qermez Dere. The three subterranean houses with their plastered clay pillars (that in House RAB is restored) panoramic view along the flanks of the hills and over the plain, contains the remains of domestic structures and the debris of everyday occupation. "Most work has been concentrated in an area of the site near its southwest margin. There the lowest strata are Final Epi-Palaeolithic and transitional to Aceramic Neolithic. The lithic assemblage for the Epi-Palaeo- lithic and Aceramic Neolithic period shows extraor- dinarily close parallels with the industries from sites in the Levant, especially the very early phases at Tell Mureybet on the Euphrates in northern Syria. In the later phases of the occupation the accumulated de- posit of earlier centuries was used to accommodate a series of subterranean houses. These houses took the form of a single sub-rectangular or sub-circular cham- ber cut into the earlier strata. The sides and floors of the chambers were formed of a thin layer of clay faced with a fine white plaster. "The three houses so far excavated form a series of superimposed successive constructions (fig. 30). The chambers range between 18 and 24 m2 in floor area. Their plaster floors were swept clean, and there are few examples of large-scale domestic equipment such as mortars or quern-stones; hearths were small and were swept clean of ash. Each of the three houses was equipped with one or more non-structural plas- tered clay pillars or stelae. When a house was aban- doned its chamber was carefully filled with soil from elsewhere on the site before the next chamber was excavated on almost the same spot. In the final house of the series six human crania were deposited on the floor at the time of the house's abandonment and deliberate destruction, one of the earliest ex- amples in the Near East of the well-attested rever- ence for the human head and its association with burial in the abandoned home. An essay on the social implications of the architecture of the houses is in press."3 "A further season of excavation is planned for the Spring of 1990, together with a first reconnaissance in the area for further sites of the period and of the full Epi-Palaeolithic period. The excavation will con- centrate on locating further houses in the southern area of the site and on completing the sampling of the central food-processing area." Samarra'. Alastair Northedge reports: "Survey and Excavations at Samarra'. 1986 Season: Survey operations at Samarra' were resumed between November 1986 and January 1987, sponsored by the British School of Archaeology in Iraq. We are very grateful to Dr. Muayad Said, Director-General of An- tiquities and Heritage, for permission to work at Sa- marra'. Our aims for the 1986 season were 1) to undertake a survey of the surface pottery, principally in order to explore the non-Abbasid history of occu- pation in the region of Samarra'; and 2) to plan on the ground those areas for which we do not have any air photographs. 3 T.

Area plan of the ruin-field "The far south of the ruin-field on the left bank (figs. 31-32) was surveyed in detail, for this second reason, and it became evident that there are more remains here than were previously known, stretching 3.5 km more to the east. "The area is dominated by a canal, the Nahr al- Qa'im; the inlet lies below Tell al-Suwwan, and at its entrance stands the tower of al-Qa'im (fig. 32). There is a further inlet 8 km downstream, called by us the Nahr al-'Ibra, which runs straight to join the Nahr al- Rasasi near to Duluiyya. The Nahr al-Qa'im has an overflow channel joining the Nahr al-'Ibra some 3.5 km east of the Octagon. The two inlets and the over- flow enclose a strip of land some 10 km long and a maximum of 1.8 km wide. We have identified three main groups of remains within this strip: "1) Site NI (the Glassworks) is a multi-period tell on the bank of the Tigris, measuring 750 x 280 m, and with a maximum depth of deposit of about 4 m, and a small fortified citadel at the west end (fig. 32). Known in earlier times as al-Sanam, more recently as the "Glassworks," the site is divided by the depression of an ancient canal, called the Nahr al-Sanam, else- where eroded except for a stretch further northwest. Over the surface of the main mounds, lines of mud- brick and baked-brick walls from the latest period of occupation can easily be traced. There is the clear outline of a mosque on the North Mound.

Surface pottery indicated occupation from the Sasanian period up to about the 13th-14th centuries. "2) The Octagon of H.usn al-Qadisiyya is a regular walled octagonal enclosure, constructed of mud-brick, varying from 1476 m to 1508 m between the sides (fig. 33). The gates in the center of each side are flanked by buttresses with a quarter-circular plan, that is, the passageway has been built into a half-round tower. The north-south axis is oriented to 184.50, some 8.50 less than the qibla. From the north, east, south, and west gates four avenues lead to a central square 300 x 320 m, which has a rectangle of 104 x 156 m laid out within it, and another larger rectan- gular area, 320 x 420 m adjoining the square to the south. Only the fortification walls were built up, while the interior has only a few small buildings, and low mounds setting out the lines for the avenues and squares. "The rectangle inside the central square has the same dimensions as the sahn of the Abfi Dulaf mosque, and seems itself to have been intended for a mosque. The larger rectangle on the south side of the central square was probably for a palace; if this were so, then the arrangement would be close to the early Islamic practice of building the Caliph's or governor's palace on the qibla wall of the congregational mosque, as is found at Kfifa, Wasit, and the Round City of Baghdad. The Octagon can be seen to be a copy of the arrangements of Mansur's Round City of Bagh- dad. "The close approximation of the axis to the qibla is suggestive of an Islamic date; but the mud-brick con- struction is strikingly different from the techniques used at Samarra'. The "quarter-circle" buttresses of the gates are paralleled in a number of Umayyad and early Abbasid buildings, which span the second- eighth centuries, but not later. "3) Site P: Unfinished development east of the Oc- tagon (fig. 32). To the east of the Octagon there are three main groups of remains: a) an avenue and buildings adjacent to the Nahr al-Qa'im; b) a group of buildings on the Tigris; and c) a number of sepa- rated sites at the east end. All of these have Samarran Abbasid pottery. "Herzfeld thought that the Octagon was the begin- ning of the city constructed by al-Mutasim on the Qatul in 220/835, the year before the foundation of Samarra'. The differences in construction, however, have brought us to believe that the Octagon is prob- ably the city or palace begun by Harun al-Rashid and abandoned in 180/796, while the buildings to the east of the Octagon represent Mutasim's renewal of the site in 835. The Glassworks (Site N1) must be the small town of al-Qadisiyya described by Yaqut as hav- ing a glass industry in the 13th century. "Also as part of the 1986 season a survey of surface pottery was undertaken to determine the extent of occupation, both chronological and geographical, in a number of areas of the ruin field. In all 18 main areas were sherded, with small collections being taken from some new sites found during the course of the</page><page sequence="31">1990] ARCHAEOLOGY IN IRAQ 289 -/~~ ?0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 --I A7 1J1 / L-1 Ul 13 B UUUL W - &gt;4 IlI 0 200 400m ffTTY_ Fig. 33.

The main periods for which we have evidence are the third millennium B.C., Neo-Assyrian/Babylonian, Sasanian, Abbasid (Samarran), and Middle Islamic. "1989 Season: Between February and April 1989 an excavation season was conducted at Qadisiyya on the Glassworks tell, with the aim of investigating the Sasanian and earlier Islamic sequence for the region of Samarra'. The excavations confirmed our earlier information and revealed a fine series of prosperous Middle Islamic mud-brick houses standing up to 2 m high, and samples of the ceramic sequence back to the Umayyad period. "In addition, T.J. Wilkinson, working as our geo- morphologist, was able to make a start on disentan- gling the complex sequence of canals that offtake from the Tigris in the area of Qadisiyya. After the next season of fieldwork it is hoped that we will be able to present a new view of the development of the Tigris, and the irrigation systems between Samarra' and Baghdad."
