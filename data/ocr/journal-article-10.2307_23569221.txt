<plain_text><page sequence="1">English and American Modernism PART II. Modernism and Miracle. Summarium. — II. Modernismus et miraculum. Hic considerandum est quo fundamento nitatur modernistarum Anglicanorum scepticismus. Si non credunt in Christum Symbolorutn, ratio est quia persuasum habent miracula non evenire, immo, ut plurimi censent, nunquam posse evenire. Censent quaevis miracula nihil aliud esse nisi eventus mere naturales; nunquam Deus in tota universi historia potentiam suam demonstravit actu vere su pernaturali. De mundi origine vel silent, vel supponere videntur universnm aeter num esse neque unquam destruendum. At lex entropiae, fatetur Decanus Inge, demonstrat universum aequiparari posse horologio, in quo, nisi sae pius intendatur spira movens, brevi remittitur motus ac cessât. Quod si ita est, agnoscendus est Creator qui in universi horologio spiram statis tempo ribus tendat. Dum ergo Modernista ne unum quidem miraculum Evangelii vult agnoscere, quod tamen finem moralem dignum habebat et cernentibus spirituale beneficium ferebat, cogitur infinitam miraculorum seriem admittere eo solo fine ut in universi machina motus perseveret. — Inter exaggeratam immanentiam Pantheismi et exaggeratam quoque transcendentiam Dei Dei starum videntur modernistae oscillare potius quam fixi haerere in média et recta sententia quam profitentur catholici. Sic scribit quidam Cantabrigiensis theologiae Professor: «Ita necessariae sunt creaturae exsistentiae Dei ut Deus necessarius est earum exsistentiae ». Qui haec scribit, profert haeresim pantheisticam et negat primum Symboli articulum. Modernismus qui negat miracula, negat etiam miraculum creationis ex nihilo et tendit ad pan theismum. Exponendae nunc et examini subiciendae sunt rationes quas modernistae et rationalistae proférant ut negent, unquam manifestam fieri extraordina riam et miraculosam Dei in mundo actionem. Iam monuimus modernistae anglicanos solere a priori negare fieri posse miraculum. Decanus Inge agnoscit momentum quaestionis. In Oxoniensi con ventu a. 1924 dixit: «Nos qui ex Clericorum Unione (Churchmen's Union) sninus, adversamur Traditionalistis, praesertim in quaestione de miraculo et hic multis videtur esse sensus pugnae inter religionem et scientiam ». Nos catholici negamus ullam esse pugnam inter scientiam veram et veram reli</page><page sequence="2">184 F. WOODLOCK gionern. Viri scientiis dediti qui negant posse esse miraculum, extra fines scientiae egrediuntur ut philosophos agant. Sic autera maior pars contemptui se obiciunt. Recitemus hic bene nota verba a Renan scripta, quoniam prin cipium facta sunt modernistarum. « Dico Evangelia esse legendas, non quod sit mihi probatum Evangelia non mereri fidem perfectam sed quia miracula narrant ». « Quod ducit nos in viis difficilibus criticismi, est principium de quo non est disputandum : supernaturale esse impossihile ». Hoc si recte as sumiiur, sequitur nos philosopho Anglo Hume assentiri debere dicenti, nullo humano testimonio posse probari miraculum cum hoc sit impossibile. Verum Shairp sensus communis sententiam exprimit dicens : « Cum prorsus absque ullo fundamento affirmetur miraculum esse in se ipso impossibile, a solo hi storico testimonio solvi potest quaestio num hic et nunc occurrerit». Sed audiamus ratiories quas hodie modernistae quidam proférant ut osten dant recte negari miracula. Quidam dicunt miraculum supponere in Deo de fectum sapientiae vel omnipotentiae vel officere dignitati maiestatis divinae. Rev. C. F. Russell: * Admittere miraculum, ait, idem est ac dicere Divinam Sapientiam, quae expressa est in ordine naturae, non potuisse prospicere omnibus eventibus sed aliquando inopinato casu imparatam deprehendi. Mihi equidem Deus qui sic cogitur intervenire, minus laudandus et ado randus videtur quam Ille qui suam Mentem ab aeterno novit et cuius agendi modus in natura est, sicut est Ipse, « idem heri, hodie et in saecula ». Prof. Mahaffy (Trinity Collège, Dublin) : « Si Deus ut monarcha constitutio nalis concipitur qui sapientia sua optimas leges constituit quibus mundus oboedire debet, mutatio earum pro libidine, vel inductio legislationis parti cularis aut exceptionum propter spéciales rationes, adversari videtur per fectae sapientiae ». Mirum est quam pauci modernistae attendant fini divino qui videtur ratio esse cur Deus in physicarum legura actionem uniformem suam actio nem interserat. Bonum morale uni,us animae ita pluris est faciendum ut quaevis physici ordinis mutatio iam digna fiât sanctitate et caritate divina. At viri illi quasi quadam superstitione vincti sunt dum credunt physi carum legum immutabilitati. Quidam ex iis panico timoré videntur corripi cum cogitant de miraculo ; formidant ne mundus fiât chaos et actum sit de certitudine scientifica si aliquando miraculum evenisse admittatur. « Qui studet naturalibus processibus iam non poterit confidere ex eisdem causis bis eosdem effectus orituros » : sic orator quidam in Oxoniensi modernista rum conventu a. 1924. Sic quoque olim Tyndall: «Si supponis orationera posse in natura mutationes inducere, necessario sequitur leges naturae plus minusve pendere ab hominum voluntate » ; iam his legibus fides haberi non potest. Aliis verbis alii similia dicunt. Omnes autem vincit Decanus Inge cum ait: «miraculum certis mentibus placere, quia legem et ordinem aver sentur ». Verum oblitus est addere, solam Ecclesiam quae fideliter crédit in miracula, catholicam Ecclesiam, etiam solam esse in qua disciplina, lex et ordo maxime adesse cernuntur.</page><page sequence="3">ENGLISH AND AMERICAN MODERNISM 185 Solet dioi a modernistis, traditionalera fidem in miracula ortam esse et perstitisse quod ignorarentur leges naturae. Attamen S. Augustinus eas non ignorabat (v. textum infra pag. 194) ; verum addit, his legibus dominari Crea torem qui ex. gr. rerum creatarum viribus uti potest ad maiora quam quod solae possent, agenda, sicut homo calamo utens scribit, quod calamus non potest solus. Aliquando negare potest Deus suam cooperationem et impedire ne vires naturae suum effectum producant. In aliis miraculis manifestatur Dei potestas creatrix. His tribus inodis explicari posse videntur omnia mi racula. Obiectiones vero quas recitavimus, omnes pendent a falso supposito circa Dei naturam et eius agendi rationem in universo creato, et videntur ignorare quid Deus intendat cum patrat miraculum. Miracula continentur in ipso infinité sapienti decreto quod simul et naturae leges imponit et excep tiones constituit quas harum legum uniformitas in certis adiunctis praevisis patietur, quae exceptiones decretae sunt ob finem quemdam ab amore Dei volitum, dignum sane et moralem. Hoc ignoratur a fere omnibus moderni stis et haec est solutio plurium ex illis difficultatibus. Deus ergo non inopinato casu .imparatus deprehenditur; neque leges mutât pro lubitu, neque eius voluntas incerta ullo modo est. Cogitare, chaos fore si semel miraculum evenerit, ridiculum est ; miracula ita raro fiunt ut possit omitti hic eventus cum de futuris inquiritur. Neque naturae leges plus minusve pendent ab hominis volitione ; nam hominis volitio non est causa miraculi. Neque Dei iustitia déficit: nullam fecit iniuriam Deus flam mis fornacis cum très iuvenes ab igne illaesos servavit ; neque sunt omnes homines coram Deo aequales ita ut Deus non possit libéré quos vult, fa vore peculiari prosequi. Sed ecce nunc philosophicam quamdam difîicultatem quam proponit D. Le Roy: «Deus omnia potest praeter absurdum. Nonne miraculum est absur dum?». Si miraculum est in conceptu contradictorium, ut circulus quadra tus, sane id neque Deus efficere potest. Si ordo metapliysicus et ordo phy sicus ita identificantur ut naturae leges physicorum eiusdem sint intrinsecae necessitatis atque leges mathematicorum — quae confusio in mente multo rum modernistarum exsistit — tune miraculum est absurdum et inutile est examini subicere testimonia quibus probatum esse dicitur. Yerum physicae leges per inductivum ratiocinium expressae sunt ex experientia; haec au tem nunquam potest esse compléta ; non possunt ergo leges physicae immu tabiles esse et necessariae ut conclusiones mathematicae. Révéra earum né cessitas et uniformitas pendet a libéra voluntate Dei a qua propter finem moralem dignum aliquando potest suspendi. Factum autem suspensionis a testibus fide dignis probatum non potest infirmari experientia etiam centum milium aliorum testium qui legem naturae exsistere affirmant sed non vide runt miraculum. Ita vero in modernistarum mente tenax inhaesit persuasio, leges phy sicae non posse violari, ut post Huxley et Anatole France non dubitent as</page><page sequence="4">186 F. WOODLOCK severare : « Si corain Professoribus facultatis meclicinae leprosus verbo sa naretur, illi quaererent naturales causas sanationis, minime putarent se cogi ad agnoscendum in hoc digitum Dei ». Tali praeiudicio impeditos sane nulla probatio facti poterit eonvincere. At negamus hanc persuasionem viros de cere qui scientiae dediti sunt. Omnes leges biologicae nunc certae prorsus abiciendae sunt si exsistit processus quidam biologicus naturalis quo possit uno momento vel amputatum brachium restaurari, vel deformis leprosus sa nari, vel mortuus resurgere. Asseverare haec posse naturaliter fieri, in ore viri scientifici est suicidiura, quoniam haec posse fieri prorsus negant ipsae leges naturae a scientia constitutae et definitae. Neque licet ad vires ignotas naturae appellare. Certi enim sumus, quaedam a natura effici non posse, licet nesciamus omnia quae possit efficere. Qui ad futuros scientiae progressus appellant, falluntur dura non advertunt, nihil quod recens inventum sit, con tradixisse legibus certis, verum his legibus complementum addidisse. Vis gravitationis non periit, licet didicerimus ea uti ad volandum. Pasteur do cuit nociva germina cohibere, non mutavit leges notas, neque eifecit ut uno momento sanari possent organicae laesiones. Quid nunc de sanationibus a Christo patratis ? Olim facta negabant cri tici dicentes saeculo 2° scripta esse Evangelia. Nunc cum fere consentiant multi nobiscum de aetate qua scripta sunt Evangelia, modernistae Angli cani parati sunt concedere facta sed negant ea esse miracula. Americanus Kev. Percy Grant : « In miraculosis, ait, sanationibus multae ex legibus qui bus usus est Christus, hodie nobis notae sunt, ut est, v. gr., ' fides sanans ' ». Immo censet Americanus Dr. Leighton Parks, nos forsan posse sperare, fore ut aliquando homini naturale fiât etiam multiplicare panes et ambulare super aquas. Quid ratio censet? Quandocumque functio non impeditur morbo orga nico sed tantum causa nervosa vel mentali, «fides sanans», suggestio, po test révéra uno momento functionem restaurare ; corrupta autem caro num quam potest nisi paulatim refici. Christus vero sanavit non tantum morbos nervorum, neque tantum paulatim sanavit, neque instantaneae sanationes ab eo patratae aequiparari possunt sanationibus illis instantaneis quas tem pore belli peragere didicerant medici, cum eis quos explosio caecos, surdos vel paralyticos eifecerat, visum, auditum vel motum forti suggestione resti tuèrent. Studiis Charcot, Bernheim et Babinski ne unum quidem passum progressi sumus versus naturalem explicationem miraculorum Evangelii. Hic possumus adicere quid censeat modernistarum dux quidam in Ame rica, Dr. Kirsopp Lake (Harvard University), de oratione petitionis: « Quod religio proxime futurae aetatis oratione utatur, non dubito... [sedj non puto in illa religione locum ullum habituram esse orationem petitionis, non magis quam ullam aliam magiae formam ». Ergo non tantum Symbolum sed etiam Oratio Dominica abicienda est, nam continet petitiones. Nisi forsan novi psychologi similes orationes servandas esse censuerint ob valorem autosug gestivum, vel telepathicum, vel psychotherapeuticum.</page><page sequence="5">ENGLISH AND AMERICAN M0DERN1SM 187 Haec vero maximi momenti animadversio non est omittenda cum quis studet miraculis Evangelii : Christus certo persuasum habebat se uti potentia quae humanas vires superaret, cum patraret miracula ; ad sua « opéra » et « signa » appellat non haesitans ut probet Iudaeis se esse Messiam quem exspectant. Christum ignorasse naturam suae potentiae, ne concipi quidem potest. Modernistae autem non audent blasphemare eum accusando quod Iudaeis illuserit. Character Christi est ultimuin critérium suorum operum. Prof. Seely ante aliquot annos scripsit : ♦ Theoria quae miracula Christi di ceret exorta in imaginatione discipulorum vel hominum sequentis aetatis, Christum efficeret virum «mythicum», qualis est Hercules ». Révéra « per fecte humanus sine miraculis Christus » modernistarum est « mythicus » Christus. Non est ille Christus quem Deum esse credebant Apostoli, quem resurrexisse certi erant, cui gentes subicere gestiebant, pro quo mortui sunt martyres. Christus Symboli Nicaeni ipse est verus « Iesus historicus » ! Sym bolum catholicum rationi non refragatur, cum exprimit revelationem quam divina confîrmavit auctoritas: « Verbum caro factum est et habitavit in nobis ». We come now to consider the bed-rock foundation of Modernist scepticisru — its often unreasoning, and always unreasonable, rejec tion of miracles. The whole édifice of unbelief in the Christ of the Creeds rests on the supposition that miracles do not happen, never have happened, and, in the judgement of very many Modernists, never can happen. Obviously the non-miraculous Christianity of Modernism is a caricature, at best, of the Christianity of the Catholic Church. Though Modernism claims to keep the kernel of true Christianity, while discarding only the husk, yet in its déniai of the articles of the Creeds it is the very kernel of the Faith that is rejected. We saw that Modernism présents us with a ' perfectly human non-miraculous Christ If He is ' Son of God so are we ail 1 Sons of God ! ' His ' résurrection ' was but that survival of His Personality, which is involved in the immortality of the soul of every man. The déniai of the Godhead of Christ dissolves the doctrine of the Blessed Trinity. In Modernism the ' Supernatural ' is rejected entirely, though the word is retained « to describe the higher qualities of existence, such as life and mind ». Thus, to reduce the Modernist description of the Supernatural to its logical absurdity: a vegetable, in that it lives and grows, manifeste in some degree the ' Supernatural ' !</page><page sequence="6">188 F. WOODLOCK We are now devoting our attention to this fondamental matter of miracle, for, from the false suppositions about the nature of miracles, and false déductions from these suppositions, really spring the déniais which are set forth in the name and under the autho rity of scientific historical criticism. Etymologically, the word ' miracle ' means a 1 wonder ', an astonishing event : theologically, it includes more than the merely ' wonderful '. Ail miracles are ' wonderful ', but not ail wonderful or astonishing things are miracles. The element of ' wonder ' is closely connected with the astonishment which arises from the experience of something that is utterly unusual, that is opposed to the général sequence of events as they are found in the expe rience of him who beholds the wonder. Aéroplanes are causes of wondering amazement, perhaps even of worship to the savages who see them for the first time sailing through the sky. Modernists would consider ail miracles to be purely natural events to which the ignorance and credulity of unscientific âges gave a supernatural interprétation. They will not allow that God ever, in the whole history of the universe, has asserted His power by a genuine supernatural intervention. With regard to the origin of the universe, they usually main tain a significant silence. Obviously it falls outside the sphere of scientific observation and experience. Yet many seem to regard the material universe as being necessarily eternal and indestruc tible, thus escaping the miracle of création, of the production of the world « ex nihilo sui et subiecti ». Dean Inge, in his Presi dential address to the Oxford Modernist Congress of 1924, speaks of the physical world as being « perpétuai as God is Eternal : boundless as God is Infinité ». The Dean, however, states — and leaves unanswered — a difficulty which must be faced by any scien tist who believes the material universe to be of eternal duration viewed rétrospectively. He says: «A difficulty besets science in the law of ' entropy ', which demonstrates that the universe is running down like a clock. This alarming prospect really points to a Creator: for if the universe is running down, why did it not stop long ago? It must have been wound up at some particular</page><page sequence="7">ENGL1SH AND AMERICAN MODERNISM 189 date, and whatever wound it up once may presumably wind it up again ». (Conf. No. 1924, pag. 227). The Dean should logically conclude that God must have already ' wound up ' this eternal universe which ' runs down ' like a clock, not merely at a ' par ticular date but on an infinité number of ' particular dates Hence the scientific Modernist, who refuses to admit even a single Gospel miracle, worked for a worthy moral purpose before the eyes of those who are benefitted spiritually by seeing it occur, is obliged to admit an infinité number of miracles on a colossal scale, worked merely to wind up again a universe which, from its very construc tion, is constantly running down! The concept of spécial Divine interventions in the création of life and of the soul of man, which are so contemptuosly rejected by evolutionists as unwortby of the Creator, is surely less unreasonable than this. Moderniste, generally speaking, would déclaré that they reject the exaggerated Immanence of Pantheism, as well as the exagge rated Transcendence of the God of the Deists, but they seem to oscillate between these two extremes, rather than to hold fixedly to the sound middle position of Catholic philosophy and theology. One of the more prominent English Modernists, the Lady Margaret professer of Divinity at Cambridge, says : « The Creator is not se parated from His créatures : they do not exist apart from Him. They have their origin in the will and love of God». This is qnite correct so far. But he continues : « They are counterparts of that will and love, as necessary to the existence of God as He is to theirs. Neither is complété without the other. Language almost fails us, but God is always being actualised, fulfilled, expressed in man, and man only cornes to full consciousness — the fulness of his potentiality — in God. It is not only that ' In Him we live and move and have our being ', but also, however much bigger His Being may be, it is true that ' In us He lives and moves and has His Being ' ». To make the existence of the universe, of créa tures, « necessary to the existence of God », to say that God is not complété without créatures, is to utter the pantheistic heresy. If necessary to God — they are eternal as God is eternal, and the primeval miracle of création out of nothing must be set aside,</page><page sequence="8">190 F. WOODLOCK and the first article of the Creed denied. Obviously there is no place for miracle in a determinist pantheistic philosophy: and non-miraculous Modernism tends to Pantheism. It is not necessary for us to plunge into the intricacies of Kantian and Hegelian théories of knowledge, though these théo ries have possibly rnuch to do with the initial objection to mys tery and miracle. We shall rather state and examine the reasons which Modernists, and rationalists, have given for denying any manifestations of God's abnormal miraculous intervention in the affaire of the physical and moral world. We have already remarked on the ' a priori ' déniai of the possibility of miracle, which is characteristic of Modernist men tality. I)ean Inge admits the importance of the question. He said at the Oxford Conférence in 1924: « We of the Churchmen's Union corne into conflict with traditionalism chiefly on the question of miracle, and this for raany is the meaning of the conflict between religion and science ». We Catholics deny that there is any con flict between true science and true religion. Scientists who deny the possibility of miracle have gone beyond the boundaries of their science, and have entered the territory of philosophy. Ne sutor ultra crepidam\ Most scientists make as sorry an exhibition of themselves when they begin to talk philosophy, as a shoemaker would do who undertook to lay down the laws of political eco nomy ! I may quote here the well-known words of Renan, for they are an accepted modernist principle today : « It is évident that the Gospels are in part legendary, because they are interlarded with miracles and the supernatural » ; and again we have his frank admission of his principles as a critic, in the words: «I say that the Gospels are legends, not because it has been proved to me that the Gospels do not deserve an unqualified belief, but because they narrate miracles ». « That which guides us in the difficult paths of criticism is the principle for us indisputa ble, that the supernatural is impossible. We do not discuss the su pernatural, for it is impossible ». The English philosopher, Hnme, had already said: « We may establish as a maxim that no human testimony eau have force to prove a miracle, and make it a just</page><page sequence="9">ENGINSIJ AND AMERICAN MODERNISM 191 fonndation of any System of theology ». Elsewhere the same writer makes « absolute impossibility » and « miraculons nature » become synonymous expressions. If Renan and those Modernists wbo use similar language are rigbt, there is no use examining evidence for any alleged miracle. It is useless to examine alleged evidence for the existence of the intrinsically impossible, such as e. g. a square circle. John Stuart Mill took a sounder philosophie posi tion when he said : « We cannot conclude absolutely that the mi raculous theory mnst be at once rejected. Once admit a God, and the production of an effect by His direct volition must be reckoned with as a serious possibility » ; and the hard-headed Scotsman, Principal Shairp, sums up the common-sense view of the matter by saying : « The statement that miracles are in themselves im possible, being a wholly groundless assumption, the question of their actual occurrence becomes one of purely historical evidence». He here puts his finger on the fact that renders rationalistic cri ticism valueless — the fact admitted by Renan in the words: « The déniai of the miraculous, and of the inspiration of Scrip ture, is not with us the resuit of exegesis: these déniais précédé ail exegesis ». I may here quote the weighty authority of two learned An glican Bishops on this point. Dr Gore, lately retired from the see of Oxford, says : « These critics approach their task with a strong bias, having determined that there can oceur no real miracles, so that they are bound to reject any strictly miraculous incidents... A critic of the Gospels who refuses miracles is bound to be re volutionary ». And the late Bishop Creighton sums up the posi tion by saying: «The destructive criticism of the New Testament rests on the supposition that miracles do not happen. But let us turn to the actual reasons which some Modernists have put forth to justify their rejection of the miraculous. English Modernists in général follow today what older rationalists have laid down. Sabatier, Tyrrell, Loisy and others inferred that to admit miracle would be to dégradé the Creator to the level of a secondary cause. Voltaire had said, and Anatole France and others repeat, that miracles would imply either a lack ofwisdom or omni potence in God, or a condescension which would be incompatible</page><page sequence="10">192 F. WOOBLOCK with the Divine dignity and English Modernists express the same ideas. One and ail put forward a view of miracle which is quite other than that of Catholic philosophy and theology. Here is the way in which an English Modernist, Rev. C. F. Russell, at the Oxford Conférence of 1924 states his reason for rejecting the miraculous. Others express the same idea in similar language. « To admit miracle », he says, « amounts to saying that the Divine Wisdom, which is expressed in the order of Nature, was not capable of providing for ail emergencies, but is sometimes — to use an everyday phrase — ' taken by surprise To me, at least, the conception of a God Who so needs to intervene, is less lofty and worship-inspiring than that of One Who knows His own Mind from ail Eternity, and Whose Method in Nature is, like Himself, ' the same yesterday, today, and for ever Anatole France made out that miracles would connote an imper fection in God's work — which would seem to require continuai tiukering and readj ustments like a worn-out motor car — always needing the attention of the repair-shop. Professor Mahaffy of Trinity Collège, Dublin, once raised a curious difhculty — one quite unworthy of a man of his in telligence. He says : « If the Deity be recognised as a constitu tional monarch who, in his Wisdom, has laid down the best laws for the world to o'bey, the notion of caprice or spécial législation or exceptions for any particular reasons becomes more and more inconsistent with the perfection of Wisdom ». The Professor here is but repeating a difficulty reised by Voltaire, one which illu strâtes the extreme anthropomorphism of that unbeliever. It is curious how few Modernists pay any attention to the Divine purpose which is seen to be the justifying reason for in terférence with physical uniformity. The moral good of a single soul so far outweighs the physical discord produced by a miracle as to make it a worthy action on the part of a holy and loving God. This apotheosis of physical law — which would regard the miraculous cure of an incurable disease by Christ's mercy as a sort of physical blasphemy — is a strange superstition of scien tists. It is as ridiculous as the objection of Paul Sabatier. In his</page><page sequence="11">ENGLISH AND AMERICAN MODERNISM 193 «c Vie de S.François d'Assise », Sabatier actually affimis miracle to be «immoral», as violating the equality of ail men before God, which he déclarés to be a « postulate of religious expé rience ». Certain scientists seem driven into a panic at tbe thought of the mere possibility of miracle : they fear that the cosmos would become chaos and scientific certainty would be at an end if a single miracle be admitted to hâve happened at any time since the beginning. Thus a speaker at the Oxford Modernist Confé rence of 1924 said: «If this disturbing factor (miracle) be intro duced, the student of natural processes can no longer count upon like causes contributing twice in succession to like results. Nor can he enjoy any confidence that the causes to which he attri butes the behaviour of objects are the true causes. Thus the mi raculous or supernatural is équivalent for the man of science to an incalculable factor which renders accurate and systematic in vestigations impossible ». Here he is but echoing the materialistic objections of Tyndall. That Victorian physicist — he was no phi losopher — said: « Assuming the power of free prayer to pro duce changes in external nature, it necessarily follows that na tural laws are more or less at the mercy of man's volition and no conclusion founded on the assumed permanence of these laws would be worthy of confidence ». But what right has he to assume this to be a power of free prayer ? An American Modernist, Bishop Lawrence of Massachussets, introduces a novel objection, the force of which it is difficult to grasp. He says: «Modem Science has convinced us that a Just God would not and could not autocratically break through the laws of nature and work wonders ». And another American, Dr Leigh ton Parks, says that « belief in miracles dégradés religion from a suprême spiritual experience to an acceptance of belief in a non-rational Universe ». Duboc déclarés that « a miracle is law lessness and for this reason it means the abolition of ail science based on principles», and Dean Inge goes so far as to say that « the miraculous is welcome to some minds because they dislike law and order». He forgets to add that the one Church which "Grcgorianum,, - anno VIII (1927), vol. VIII.</page><page sequence="12">194 F. WOODLOCK clings faithfully to belief in miracle — the Catbolic Church — is the one in which discipline, law and order is most évident. It is commonly said by Modernists like Dean Inge that the traditional belief in miracles originated and endured through igno rance of the fact that there were such things as laws of nature. Loisy makes much of this. Yet, the following passage shows that even .in the days of S. Augustine the concept of 1 laws of nature 7 was not unknown. He says : « Omnis iste naturae usitatissimns cursus habet quas dam naturales leges suas... et elementa mundi huius corporei, habent definitam vim qualitatemque suam, quid unum quodque valeat vel non valeat, quid de quo fieri possit vel non possit... Super hune autem modum cursumque rerum naturalem potestas Creatoris habet apud se, posse facere de his aliud quam eorum quasi séminales rationes habent » {De Gen. ad litt., 1. 9, c. 17, n. 32 ; ML 34, 406). Thus St Augustine, long before the vaunted Yictorian âge of scientific discovery, most perfectly describes the relation of Créa tion to its Creator, and recognises that God has imposed on Na ture the laws it is to follow, these laws constituting the prin ciple from which Nature draws its uniformity of action. But St Augustine reminds his readers that above this natural course, the Creator has power to produce in créatures effects which are outside their intrinsic capacity. He can supplément the ordinary forces of nature by His Divine Power and Wisdom, as a human cause can pick up a pen, and using it as an instrument, perform with it what it is unable to perform by itself. Such supplemen tary interventions of Divine Power, going beyond the ordinary coopération of the Creator with the ordinary, natural activities of the créature, are seen in the case of some miracles. In other miracles, it is perhaps by withholding His coopéra tion, and so preventing natural forces from acting according to their nature to produce their effects, that God effects the super natural marvel. Others, again, manifest the creative power of God. These tbree explanaitions would seem to cover ail cases of miracles. Looking back on the objections which have been quoted so far, we see that they ail dépend on a false supposition about</page><page sequence="13">ENGLISH AND AMERICAΝ MODEBNISM 195 God's Nature and His Activity in création, and they forget the object which He has in view in working a miracle. Miracles are eternally planned in the same all-wise decree which imposes both the natural laws, and the occasional exceptions to the nniformity of these laws which are decreed for some worthy, loving, moral purpose. This is ignored by nearly ail Modernists, and it is the solution of many of these difficulties. Miracles, then, are not « divine after-thoughts » ; God is not « taken by surprise ». They are not necessary to remedy some unforeseen defect in His work. God is not a limited 1 constitu tional Monarch ', nor is there any element of ' capriciousness ' or of indécision. Nor, again, are ail men ' equal ' before God, in the sense that He is not free to select some individuals for exceptional favour. We remember the parable of the workmen, and the Mas ter's reply to those who complained at receiving only the agreed su m for the day's labour, while others received equal pay for an hour's work. « Friend », said the Master, « I do thee no wrong ! » The idea that chaos would resuit in the cosmos if there were a single miracle is ridiculous. Miracles are always so utterly excep tional that their occurrence can be practically set aside in calcu lating on the future. Catholic astronomers, who believe in the pos sibility of miracles, will go across the world to view an éclipsé of the sun with no anxiety as to its failing to appear punctually, though they know God could absolutely interfère by miracle. Na tural laws are not « more or less at the mercy of man's volition » — for man's volition is not the cause of miracle. Nor is God's Justice involved. He did no injustice to the fiâmes of the fiery furnace, when He prevented them burning the three youths, as recorded in the Old Testament! M. Le Roy says it is not the question of God's Power, but of the « conceivability » of miracle that must be examined. « Dieu peut tout sauf l'absurde. Le miracle n'est-il pas absurde? Voilà le problème». A few English speaking Modernists agree with him, and here we corne to a definite philosophieal considération. Is ' miracle ' a self-contradictory concept — like e. g. a ' square circle ' or a ' holy blasphemy'? If so, God's Omnipotence could not perform it, for it is intrinsically incapable of being actuali</page><page sequence="14">196 F. WOODLOCK sed. If it is unthinkable, i. e. untrue, it is impossible even foi Omnipotence. Only that which is true can be real. If the metaphysical and physical orders are so identified that the natural laws of physics have the same kind of intrinsic ne cessity as the laws of mathematics, if they resuit from the very essence of physical existences, then miracle would be unthinkable, absurd, self-contradictory, and it would be useless to examine évi dence for any alleged miracle. This confusion exists in the minds of many Modernists and is revealed in their utterances. Physical laws, which are formulated by inductive reasoning from expé rience — an experience which can never be complété — do not involve the same necessary, eternal uniformity which e. g. deduc tive reasoning gives us with regard to mathematical conclusions. Two plus two always and everywhere must equal four. The half of a quantity must always, everywhere be less than the whole. A 1 square-circle ' is essentially impossible. These truths dépend radically on the necessary Being and Truth of God. Butwhen we corne to physical laws and the uniformity of Nature, we are dea ling with necessities which dépend on the Free Will of God — necessities which are imposed by that Free Will on créatures as their normal, natural mode of existence and activity. The same Free Will which makes e„ g. material bodies attract one another with a force varying proportionally as the square of their distances from each other, may in a particular instance and for some worthy moral purpose, suspend the application of the law or even reverse it for a moment into a law of repulsion instead of attraction. There is nothing in the very concept of matter which essen tially demands that it attract rather than repel. But there is some thing in the concept of a square which essentially excludes the idea of a circle, and prevents the possibility of there being a square circle. The Rev. Percy Stickney Grant, a well-known New York Mo dernist, in a public letter to his bishop, in which he attempts to justify his disbelief in the miracles of the Creeds, says: « I cannot love God with my mind and at the same time be lieve that the laws of nature were ever violated: for the simple reason that God Himself has taught me, as He is teaching ail</page><page sequence="15">ENGLISH AND AMERICAN MODERNISM 197 our sons and daughters in every modem university of the Western World today, that those laws are immutahle throughout eternity ». In declaring the laws « immntable throughout eternity », a pro fessor passes from the sphere of physics to metaphysics, from science to philosophy, and at the same time he is falling into the elementary logical fallacy of arguing from non esse to non posse — from the fact that a thing does not exist, to the anté cédent impossibility of its existence. It is important, however, to remember that the existence of a miraculous exception does not annnl or destroy the existence of the law in physical matters, as it would do in the matheraa tical or metaphysical order. Rather is the continued existence of the law the very condition of the miraculous nature of the ex ceptional fact. Were there no laws of Nature there could be no miracles. S. Thomas *reminds us that « although God may produce an effect outside the opération of its natural cause, He in no way abolishes the regular relation of this cause to effect ». Miracles are thus conceived as leaving the physical laws still in existence while, as has been said, either by the withholding of His Di vine Concurrence, whieh is neeessary for the effective activity of secondary causes, or by some quasi-creative supplementary acti vity, God produces the miraculous effect. Thus Hume's argument loses its force when we properly understand miracle. He says: «A miracle is a violation of the laws of Nature; and as a firm and unalferable experience has established these laws, the proof against miracle, from the very nature of the fact, is as entire as any argument from experience can possibly be imagined ». Un fortunately for his argument, it is actually the experience of the witnesses which establishes the fact of the occurrence of the mi racle, while the général experience on which the law is based is merely « négative » with regard to the possibility of exceptions to its uniformity. You cannot annul the evidence of ten people who have seen a miracle, by opposing to it the déniai of ten millions who did not see it occur. There is no true opposition for the evidence in the case is not with reference to the same fact. In describing a miracle as « a thing which is performed outside the order of the whole created nature», S.Thomas draws atten</page><page sequence="16">198 F. WOODLOCK tion to the fact that a true miracle cannot find its whole expia nation in the ordinary action of secondary causes which operate in God's universe. He does not here deny that God may use créa tures as instruments through which His ' supernatural ' activity is exercised: but the principal Cause — in opposition to the in strumental — in such cases is God, not the Saint or thaumaturge acting by his human and natural powers. So strong is the objection of Modernists to this concept of God acting « outside » the natural order in the production of a mi racle, so tenaciously do they cling to the inviolability of physical law, that they déclaré every abnormal event must be only an instance of a seldom observed natural law. Thus, a Modernist writes : « If, in the presence of the professors of the faculty of medecine, a leper should be healed by a word, they would seek for natural causes of the cure, and would in no way see them selves compelled to perceive in this the Finger of God ». Huxley had said : « If a dead man did come to life, the fact would not be evidence that any law of nature had been violated, but that these laws, even when they express a very long and uniform ex périence, are necessarily based on incomplète knowledge, and are to be held only as grounds of more or less reasonable expeeta tion ». Anatole France, in an oft quoted passage, says that sup posing an amputated limb were instantly restored at some sacred shrine, «An observer of a really scientific mind... would not say : ' That is a miracle ! '. He would say : ' An observation, up to the présent unique, leads one to believe that in circumstances not yet clearly determined, the tissues of the human limbs have the power to grow again — like the claws of a erab... but much more rapidly ' ». This explanation would be accepted by English Modernists in preference to an interprétation by miracle. When confronted with such glaring and unreasonable bias as is revealed by these last three writers, we are tempted to admit that no evidence for miracle could compel their assent. But we deny that their attitude is really scientific. We sball consider now the matter of miracles of healing: and we may note at once that ail established laws of biology must be set aside if we are to admit that there is any biological process which can naturally account</page><page sequence="17">ENGLISH AND AMERICAN MODERNlSM 199 for the sudden restoration of an amputated limb, the cure of a deformed leper, or the raising of the dead. To say that these things ean happen ' naturally ' is suicidai on the lips of a scientist, pre cisely because natural laws, well established in science, are defi nitely opposed to their happening. Certain physical laws are known for certain : we know that no modem discovery can invalidate them. Nature would have to change before they would cease to be true. Thus, to appeal to unknown forces of Nature in such cases is futile. It is unscientific to say that because the progress of science has taught us how to fly and to hear by « wireless », etc., there fore perhaps it will one day teach us how to raise the dead or restore deformed lepers by a word. We can be sure of some things which Nature cannot do, though we may not be able to enume rate ail that it can do. The fallacy in this appeal from présent progress to future discoveries is in this, that no present-day disco very has contradicted the certain, known laws of science — it has but supplemented them. Apples still fall to the ground, kettles still boil, as they did in Newton's and Watt's days, and for the same reasons. Gra vitation still is a force — though we have learnt to use it to mount into the air as well as to fall to the ground by its acti vity. We can be absolutely certain e. g. that as long as the human body is what it is, of the same nature, sulphuric acid will never be a favourite refreshing drink for men in hot weather. As long as the laws of biology hold, large masses of diseased and destroyed cellular tissue will never be instantly restored by natural processes. Within limits, the speed and activity of the vis medicatrix na turae may be helped and hastened by suggestive treatment. Pas teur's wonderful discoveries have taught aseptic surgery to keep out harmful germs, but they have not changed the laws of biology or introduced new vital forces or made instantaneous cures of organic lésions possible — save by miracle. Of this we are sure because we know how grave lésions are gradually restored — by successive processes of cell-building. Such processes essentially need time. What then of Christ's cures of disease? The old Victorian ra tionalisée critics decided that ail the accounts of such cures must be carefully dissected out of the Gospel history — as a surgeon</page><page sequence="18">200 F. WOODT.OCK cuts ont cancerous tissue from the body. The cures were denied to be facts, for if they were admitted to be facts they were ne cessariiy miraculous facts and a miraculons fact was unthinkable to a rationalist critic, These critics, it will be remembered, thought that the dates of the Gospels must be put well into the second century, in order to allow plenty of time for the growth of what they regarded to be merely mythical legends. Step by step they hâve been driven back from this position, till today Harnack and most of the others are practically in agreement with tradition in the matter of the dates of composition of the Gospels. With regard to the facts recorded, Modernists are now prepared generally to admit the facts, but to deny them to be miracles. They seek to give a natural explanation to the facts. Thus the American Rev. Percy Grant says : « In the miracles of healing, many of the laws em ployed by Christ have today been made known to us, but we re cognise clearly that such works are not contrary to, but in accor dance with, law ». Lqng ago, even Strauss had said : « The power or Jésus to work miracles must be considered only as a higher kind of na tural force, a healing power which, even if not met with elsewhere, lies within the sphere of human nature». The Rev. J. M. Thompson — the author of a revolutionary work on « The Miracles of the New Testament » — which created a stir in England ten years ago, says of Christ's healing power: « There is probably not one of the cures (narrated in S. Mark) which is not explicable, or, if we knew the original facts, would not be explicable, as an instance of Faith Healing ». « La foi qui guérit » of Charcot lias been developped, till today it is put for ward as the final explanation of ail the Gospel cures. Personality strongly developed on Christ-like lines is said to be naturally ca pable of producing results such as Christ effected. Thus the Ame rican, Dr Leighton Parks, encourages us to hope that even in the case of miracles over inanimate matter, the natural powers of the human spirit may manifest complété mastery. He says : « It may be that the days will corne when it shall seem to be as natural to walk on the waters or multiply loaves and fishes, as it now seems to heal the sick in the way the Gospel déclarés that they</page><page sequence="19">ENGL1SH AND AMERICAN MODEREISM 201 were healed in the day of Jésus. But that will be to eliminate miracles, not by denying tbem, but by understanding them ». Such optimistic anticipations are without the slightest foundation in ob served facts. The cures narrated in the Gospels are différent in kind and not merely in degree, from the cures effeeted by psycho-the rapy. A ' faith-healer's ' cures by suggestion are only sudden in the cases where functions are restored that have been lost through some nervous or mental cause and where there is no organic dis ease présent as the cause of the functional disability. Psycho-the rapy can, at best, only help towards the graduai restoration of decayed organic tissue. Now, the cures wrought by Christ were not solely the cures of nervous complaints nor were then effeeted gradually. They are not paralleled by the cures of blindness, deaf ness or paralysis due to 1 shell-shock ' in the war, which doc tors have learnt to cure suddenly in some cases, by a strong suggestion, or more gradually by psycho-analysis. Nothing that we are learning in modem psycho-therapy is even approaching the quasi-creative cures, such as instant restoration of the lost tissues in a leper's flesh : nor is there any valid reason for thinking that we shall ever be able to work such wonders. Christ was not me rely a 1 Super-Coué ', nor have the progressive studies of Charcot, Bernheim, and Babinski really advanced us one step in the di rection of a naturalistic explanation of the Gospel miraculous cures. Still less have they any bearing on the miracles over inanimate nature, such as the stilling of the storm on the Lake, and the feeding of the five thousand in the desert. With regard to the latter, the most radical English critic, Bev. J. D. Major D. D. says that the fact of the feeding of the multitude is critically incon testable, and that ' at présent ' the critics find themselves unable to explain how it was done ! It is strange that they have not yet suggested that it was a case of collective hallucination — of Christ hypnotising the five thousand into the belief that they liad had a substantial meal! We may insert here the practical and logical conclusion drawn by Dr Kirsopp Lake, the leading American Modernist of Harvard University, with regard to the use of prayers of pétition addressed to God in the « Church of the Future ».</page><page sequence="20">202 F. WOODLOCK He says : « Thait the religion of tomorrow will have prayer, I do not doubt, unless tbe Churckes should be so foolish as to insist that prayer must include pétition... for I do not believe that tbe religion of tomorrow will have any more place for péti tion than it will have for any other form of Magic ». So the Lord's Prayer must be jettisoned along with the Creed — for it contains prayers of pétition — and hence, accordïng to Kirsopp Lake, involves an appeal to ' magie '. Unless, indeed, the new psychologists may vote to retain such prayers for their auto-sugges tive value, when we pray against temptation; or their télépathie value, when we pray for grâces for the conversion of sinners ; or for their psycho-therapeutic value when we pray for ourselves in sickness, or, by meaus of prayer, give ' absent treatment ' to suffe rers at a distance. Modem psychology would claim some utility for such prayers even though it may deny the existence of the God to whom they are addressed ! One most important considération must not be omitted in stud ying the subject of the Gospel miracles viz. what Christ Himself thought of His works. Christ clearly believed that He was exer cising powers which were more than human when He worked His miracles. He confidently appeals to His ' works ' and ' signs ' to prove to the Jews that He was their Messïah. I need not quote here the passages where this appeal is made. They are familiar to ail who read these pages. 1s it conceivable that Christ was ignorant of the true nature of the powers He was exercising? Modernists dare not blaspke mously accuse Him of ' bluffing ' the Jews. The character of Christ is the final criterion of His works. The facts, then, happened as recorded, and the facts are the resuit of the exercise of super-human, divine powers. The author of « Ecce Homo », Professor Seely, wrote years ago : « Miracles play so important a part in Christ's scheme, that any theory which would represent them as entirely due to the imagination of His followers or of a later âge destroys the credibility of the docu ments not partially, but wholly, and leaves Christ a personage as mythical as Hercules ». The « perfectly human-miraculous Christ » of Modernism is the real « mythical » Christ ! The « non-miracu</page><page sequence="21">ENGLISH AND AMERICAN MODERNISM 203 lous » Christ of Modernisai could never have been the Christ, be lief in Whose Godhead and certainty of Whose résurrection inspired the Apostles with courage to convert the pagan world and die a martyr's death. The Divine Pre-existing Son of God Who became Incarnate of the Virgin Mother, Who proved His claims by a gé miné exercise of the Divine Powers, Who died for us and Who rose gloriously from the dead leaving the tomb empty, Who ascended into Heaven — and Who remains ' Emmanuel ' with us on our Al tars, HE is the real ' Jésus of History ' ! The Catholic Creed is the reasonable expression of the divinely authenticated révélation that «the Word became Flesh and dwelt amongst us». Francis Woodlock S. i.</page></plain_text>
