<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tree to fall': Transgressive Intertextuality in Carl Shuker's The Lazy Boys Stephen Wenley An immersion in the mind and experience of a young man on a nightmarish descent towards complete moral disintegration, Carl Shuker's second novel, The La%y Boys (2006), x is a savage critique of youth culture and masculine expression in New Zealand. Into this grim satire Shuker has blended an intertextual dimension that traverses boundaries of high and low art, the canonical and the contemporary, the fictive and the factual, the local and the global, thus creating a postmodern synthesis of diverse cultural signifiers. The novel's epigrams place Paradise Lost alongside lyrics by punk legends The Clash and alt-rockers The Pixies, an incongruous juxtaposition that dares us to contemplate the tenuous similarities between literary epic and pop song; after all, the gist of Milton's tale of transgression and revolt, informed by the political instability of the Restoration period, is not so dissimilar to the rebellious anti-establishment ethos of 1970s punk rock and its development into the fiercely independent alternative rock scene of the 1980s. This is, of course, a reductive comparison; by playfully reworking his cultural and literary heritage, however, Shuker creates a curious layer of intertextuality in The La%y Boys that aims at more than just postmodern recycling. Instead, his deft manipulation of transgressive antecedents infuses the narrative with an aversive quality that amplifies the unsettling effects of engaging the taboo. Julia Kristeva coined the term 'intertextuality' in her essay Word, Dialogue, and Novel' (1966), in which she was among the 86</page><page sequence="2">Free to fall' first to introduce the ideas of Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin to Western readers.2 Interpreting Bakhtin, Kristeva presents the 'literary word' as 'an intersection of textual surfaces rather than a point (a fixed meaning)'.3 Hence, any given literary text, as a 'dialogue among several writings', is always an 'absorption and transformation of another'.4 Kristeva's colleague Roland Barthes developed this notion in his essay 'The Death of the Author' (1968), in which he describes the text as a 'multi-dimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash', and a 'tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture'.5 A text does not therefore contain a single message from an 'Author-God'; instead, its meaning is mediated through its participation in the discourses of other texts, a process in which the reader becomes an active participant. While its early theorists held that authorial intention was irrelevant to intertextuality, in its current form the term has come to signify what M. H. Abrams defines as 'the multiple ways in which any one literary text is made up of other texts', including 'open or covert citations or allusions', as well as its engagement with earlier texts and the 'common stock' of literary conventions.6 Intertextuality has become too ubiquitous for some critics, such as William Irving, who complains that because 'Every text is potentially the intertext of every other text [. ..] reading becomes an infinite process' in which the reader supplants the author with their own 'rather banal and idiosyncratic interpretations'.7 While this is a possibility, I wish to demonstrate that careful analysis of intertextual connections can hold the conflict between authorial intention and reader interpretation in balance to reveal meaning that derives from somewhere in between; for while reader response is always shaped to some extent by the limits the author has placed within the text, those limits are not fixed, and an author's control over his material is never omnipotent. The Lm^)i Boys is a particularly apt subject for intertextual analysis as it demonstrates a variety of 87</page><page sequence="3">Journal of New Zealand Uterature ways in which intertextuality can function in a single text, as well as revealing Shuker's capacity to subvert the conventions of literary assimilation. In addition to Paradise host, Shuker's novel draws from Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange (1962) and the early novels of Bret Easton Ellis as transgressive antecedents that explore the free will of the individual amidst larger forces which compel conformity. The thematic unity of these intertextual layers directs us to the nature of reader response to transgression and helps to explain why we seek the taboo in literature. Fluctuations of dissonance and reconciliation of meaning develop in the prologue to The La%y Boys, where Richey, the novel's anti-hero narrator, wakes up in his bedroom and remembers doing something terrible to a young woman the previous night while in a 'drunken rage' at a party (p. 8). He surveys his bedroom and notices an array of decaying cultural relics: a broken record by The Smiths; a ripped Speight's beer poster detailing 'How To Be a Southern Man'; a rewritten stanza of a poem by Sylvia Plath. Satirising New Zealand's masculine ideal - embodied by the Speight's poster with its didactic connotations of the stoic man of the south - is a central concern of The La%y Boys. As a sustained critique of the national stereotype of the laconic and emotionally impenetrable kiwi male, the novel undermines any vestiges of charm in the 'man alone' topos and questions the pervasiveness of this masculine ideal in New Zealand culture. This authorial intention underlies Richey's revision of the last stanza of Plath's 'Lady Lazarus': Out of the ash I rise with my red hair And I eat men like air.8 The narrator's revision is 'about me and other boys I know': Into the ash We fall with our dirty hair 88</page><page sequence="4">Free to fall' And we eat girls for air (p. 8). Throughout the novel the self-parody evident in Richey's masculine posturing frequently suggests an ironic tone that destabilises the narrative, and here we are left unsure quite how to react to this attempt at macho revisionism. The stanza's original context - a woman resurrecting herself after a suicide attempt and emerging stronger - is reversed so that the image of a single woman with 'red hair' is replaced by a group of men with 'dirty hair', indicating a change from individual vibrancy to grimy collectivity. Considered in relation to what we can guess of Richey's actions at the party, the line 'we eat girls for air' becomes worryingly appropriate. While Plath's poem serves as a warning to patriarchy - 'Herr God, Herr Lucifer / Beware / Beware' - here that defiance is inverted into a reassertion of male dominance. The movement of Plath's stanza is also reversed so that the upward, phoenix-like resurrection from the ash becomes a downward 'fall', introducing the connection between Satan's fall from heaven in Paradise "Lost and Richey, who ends the prologue by ominously indicating the direction of his story's trajectory: 'So the fall begins' (p. 8). Richey refers to his own fall throughout the novel,9 eventually associating it with an image of ash in order to suggest that his existence, like Satan's, is doomed to a passage through fire to ruin: 'I'm sinking into ash [. . .] a falling orange ember in a chasm of ash' (p. 248). Other than this loose metaphorical 'fall', Shuker avoids referencing Paradise host simply to create narrative parallels. Instead he uses allusion and thematic connections to add a degree of bathos to the modern social milieu he depicts by connecting the predicament of his decidedly unheroic protagonist to the largely absent framework of existential values embedded in the shadow text, an approach which recalls T. S. Eliot's comments on the 'mythical method' used in James Joyce's Ulysses as a way of 'giving a shape and a significance to the immense panorama of futility and anarchy which is 89</page><page sequence="5">Journal of New Zealand Uterature contemporary history'.10 Both Paradise Lost and The La%y Boys explore the idea of free will. Milton's characters, human and angelic, are created 'Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall' (III. 99), n signifying the importance of conscious choice in the disobedience of Adam and Eve, as well as that of Satan and his rebel angels. Richey becomes convinced he is not so sufficient, deeming his fall inevitable while further denying his free will by refusing to accept responsibility for himself. When Richey lays the blame for his actions on others (p. 47), the effect is similar to Satan's suggestion that God tempted a rebellion by concealing his true strength (I. 641-42); the logic might initially seem solid, but on closer examination it is revealed to be flawed and self- serving. Shuker has said that his book 'is not about solutions, but it does put some of the problems out there for people to see',12 and rather than trying to locate the blame or reason for Richey's 'fall' in any one cause, he presents a variety of possible contributing factors and multiple ways of interpreting them, such as Anna's philosophy of personal responsibility (p. 245), or the social science sex-murderer argument advanced by CA Book of Murder" (pp. 132-38; pp. 140-45; pp. 154-58), or Richey's own interpretation of his psyche with its emphasis on fate (p. 8). The allusions to Paradise Lost in The La%y Boys are intriguing for the questions they raise regarding the representation of Richey's conscious and subconscious thought patterns as they pervade the novel. Richey remembers reading the epic poem in school, but when he tries to recite a passage to his friend Matt as they sit by Dunedin's Leith River - an attempt to liken the effects of alcohol to the 'Lethe', hell's 'river of oblivion' (II. 583) - he becomes self-conscious and his quotation is halting and error-riddled (p. 101).13 In contrast are the surprisingly lucid voices he hears when intoxicated, which are seemingly hallucinations drawn from his subconscious. At a rugby after- match booze-up, Otago utility back Marc Ellis suddenly says to Richey: 'I'm the demon Belial and I am hate' (p. 208). This reference to Belial, a demon whose name means 'worthies sness' 90</page><page sequence="6">Free to fall* in Hebrew (I. n490), recalls Milton's lines 'when night / Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons / Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine' (I. 500-502) - appropriate given Ellis's haughty conduct and the drunken atmosphere of this late night scene. Milton's passage also associates the 'sons of Belial' with rape (I. 503-505), paralleling Ellis's 'story' of a sex act performed on a 'comatose' woman in a rugby clubroom (p. 204), and foreshadowing the rape of the young woman Richey witnesses the same night at a later after-party (pp. 219-20). As a well- known national sports celebrity, Marc Ellis's interaction with Richey within the narrative space of the novel disrupts the reader's expectations of fictive and factual boundaries, and, as an embodiment of New Zealand's fondly vaunted culture of laddish mischief, his complicity with sexual violence here further complicates the social satire of Shuker's critique of masculinity: the seemingly offhand allusion crafts a provocative parallel between the 'sons of Belial' described in Paradise Lost and the sons of rugby depicted in the novel. More of these hallucinatory allusions to Milton's epic occur when Richey is tripping on LSD at the novel's final party, where he hears a boy utter 'Repent Satan' to him, and a girl say 'Lust hard by hate, from Aroer to Nebo' (p. 277). 'Repent Satan' stresses the urgent need for Richey to check his behaviour in order to avoid tragedy. He contemplates doing so on arriving at the party, but instead opts to 'take this to its logical end' (p. 275), which suggests that Richey has reached a state akin to Satan's realisation in Book IV that repentance is no longer possible as 'all good to me is lost' (line 109). 'Lust hard by hate' - alluding to a passage in Paradise Lost which describes the heathen followers of the demons Moloch and Chemos via a phallic pun (I. 417) - disturbingly foreshadows that 'logical end': the violent, anger- fuelled rape of Ursula which concludes the novel. Richey later hears another stranger at the party tell him 'Self-destruction therefore sought implies not thy contempt but anguish and regret' (p. 279), a paraphrase of lines 1016-1018 from Book X of 91</page><page sequence="7">Journal of New Zealand Uterature Paradise Lost, which, in its original context, forms part of Adam's argument to Eve that they must not commit suicide and should instead accept responsibility for their fall. Hence, the allusion emphasises Richey's unwillingness - or inability - to accept responsibility for his behaviour and 'repent'. What these hallucinatory allusions mean in relation to Richey's mind is left open to interpretation. Conceivably, they indicate the presence of a psychotic mental disorder, and that perhaps Richey has absorbed Paradise Lost into his subconscious far more thoroughly than his conscious attempt to recite it reveals. This would help to suggest a source for his fixation on the idea of his own 'fall'. Consequently, Paradise Lost performs a curious intertextual function in The La^y Boys in that it is both an internal textual reference point - cited both consciously and subconsciously by the narrator - as well as an external reference, quoted as an epigram to establish an overarching thematic parallel. There is a peculiar postmodern tension implicit in this ambivalent intertextual position, which is both a conflict within Richey's mind and a struggle for control between narrator and author, for it is unclear who exactly is interpreting Milton's poem. At the end of the novel Richey acknowledges that there was an element of truth in Anna's understanding of him as a 'sweet' person, before he states that that person 'no longer exists' (pp. 246; p. 247). By this stage he is convinced of his own impending doom, and to justify this 'fallen' state he dismisses his earlier self as a 'naive fool, without experience, without volition, without knowledge' (p. 247), implying he has now obtained these qualities. This positive view of his condition echoes Satan's mitigating rhetoric to the fallen angels: 'Here at least / We shall be free; [...] Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heav'n' (I. 258- 9, 263) - a claim that it is better to be a disobedient rebel than a servant, just as Richey feels it is better to be fallen and 'capable' than 'sweet' and powerless (p. 247; p. 246). This can be read as an ironic inversion of the theological concept of the felix culpa or 92</page><page sequence="8">Tree to fall* fortunate fall; Richey is not referring to a desire for redemption from sin through Christ, but to his capacity to fall further and turn his thoughts of evil into actions. In concluding his study of an individual's destruction, Shuker briefly allows a wider focus when Richey refers to 'men like me in rooms like this all over the country, adamantine chains' (p. 293), expanding the satire to a national level encompassing 'thousands' of men imprisoned like Milton's fallen angels in the 'penal fire' of hell (I. 48). The result is tragic-comic: the allusion heightens the chaotic insignificance of the contemporary against the elevated grandeur of the epic. The blurb on the Penguin edition of The La^y Boys describes the book as 'anarchic and brutal - A Clockwork Orange for our times', and regarding this marketing decision Shuker has commented that 'eventually [the publisher] settled on selling it as a modern-day Clockwork Orange',14 suggesting the connection is perhaps more paratextual and commercial than literary. The two novels do engage with similar subject matter, however, particularly in their treatment of the idea of free will. Like Paradise host, A Clockwork Orange questions whether it is better for the individual to be forced to be good, or free to choose to do evil.15 Burgess's novel argues for the latter, as, in the words of the prison chaplain, once Alex is forced to be good he 'ceases to be a wrongdoer [but he] ceases also to be a creature capable of moral choice' (p. 94), and for Burgess, free will is essential to human identity. Similarly, Shuker's novel questions whether responsibility for an individual's actions rest with the individual, or within the society and environment that shapes the individual. Shuker's compelling depiction of both forces suggests that in Richey's case they work in tandem with destructive results. Shuker has described Richey as 'something of an imitator, in the way most adolescents are - absorbing and using the language and the expectations and the methods of the world he's accidentally been born into'.16 A similar argument can be detected in A Clockwork Orange, for example in the 'Violence makes violence' justification 93</page><page sequence="9">Journal of New Zealand Uterature used by the police when they beat up Alex (p. 53), or when Alex laughs approvingly at a newspaper article in which a priest blames youth violence on the devil, who WAS ABROAD and was like ferreting his way into like young innocent flesh', and on the 'adult world [...] with their wars and bombs and nonsense' (p. 32). In both books, the focus is not on laying the blame for the depravity of their respective anti-heroes, however, but on exploring the conflict between individual will and collective will, evident in Alex's dehumanisation at the hands of the Ludovico technique (which claims to impose the will of society), or in Richey's struggle with peer pressure and the dominance of the masculine ideal. In both novels individual free will is under threat from ingrained societal forces. Shuker's description of Richey as an 'imitator' who absorbs language is worth considering given the importance of slang to the literary construction of youth identity in both The La%y Boys and A Clockwork Orange. Perhaps the most distinctive element of A Clockwork Orange is our immersion in Alex's nadsat language, an apt imposition - in a book about challenges to the autonomy of the individual mind - of a form of brainwashing on the reader.17 The language also veils the action, and in passages of the novel describing explicit violence and rape this has the disquieting effect of leaving ample room for readerly interpretation. Also, because we experience the violence through Alex's perspective, we get to feel an element of his glee in inflicting it, further complicating our response to a character who exudes charm and humour, yet draws our condemnation for his self-indulgent delight in the suffering of others, all the while remaining sympathetic due to the fragments of youthful innocence and optimism he retains. In contrast to the reader's immersion in nadsat in A Clockwork Orange^ slang in The La%y Boys is confined to the brief conversations between the male characters. This stunted and debased vernacular stands out from the rest of the book, which is comprised of Richey's articulate internal dialogue, suggesting 94</page><page sequence="10">Free tofaW that the slang, like the masculine ideal, is a construct Richey adopts as an affectation, rather than an authentic expression of his self. However, as Richey's imitation of the sexually violent language of his peers deepens, for example his adoption of the phrase Til fucking rape you, you bitches' (p. 283), the distinction between affectation and personal identity begins to blur. As one reviewer observes, while Richey's 'language braces him against an indifferent world, it also hardens him against his own best impulses'.18 The tagline A Clockwork Orange for our times' is curious in that The La%y Boys is set in 1994.19 Hence, while Burgess's vision is prophetic, prompting readers to contemplate how the present might foster a dystopian future, Shuker's novel is a disturbing portrayal of the recent past, unsettling because of its familiarity to 'our times' in the present. As an intertextual layer within The La^y Boys, A Clockwork Orange is sufficiently dissimilar and historically distant to be explicitly referenced by Shuker's marketers without compromising the originality of his novel: an association with a cult classic ascribes cultural significance to the contemporary text while heightening the reader's expectations of its thematic content. Conversely, the influence of the satirist Bret Easton Ellis is rather more muted: Shuker's novel transposes and modifies the moral decay of Ellis 's advanced metropolitan worlds to provincial New Zealand. When Richey comes across a bookshop display on sex- murderers - a mixture of real titles and some that Shuker has invented - one of the many books he buys is Bret Easton Ellis' American Psycho (1991), 'Staff Pick and shrinkwrapped, 18+' (p. 50), creating a parallel between Richey and American Psycho's notorious narrator Patrick Bateman, who also has a hobby of reading true crime.20 The La%y Boys can be read as a meditation on how a sex-murderer might develop in New Zealand, just as Ellis's satire suggests how obsessive materialism in Wall Street yuppies might cause a man to view other people's lives and bodies as just another commodity to be possessed and 95</page><page sequence="11">Journal of New Zealand Uterature consumed. There are also a number of similarities in terms of both content and style between The La%y Boys and Ellis's 1985 debut novel Less Than Zero.21 Both give voice to young male protagonists who have just left high school and are tentatively trying to establish themselves in the wider world, struggling to think and behave as individuals within a milieu characterised by conformity, apathy, and apparent moral vacuum. Richey's identity crisis, and resulting existential angst and alienation, is akin to that of Less Than Zero's narrator Clay.22 The impending sense of doom felt by Clay and Richey springs from a perception that the world around them is corrupt, morally bankrupt, and meaningless. In both novels this perception is given its most disturbing manifestation in the depiction of rape. In Less Than Zero's climax Clay visits the apartment of an acquaintance who is keeping a drugged-up twelve year old girl captive as a sex slave. Clay offers a brief glimpse of moral indignation, saying eI don't think it's right' (p. 177), but, in keeping with Ellis's style throughout the novel, the reader confronts the obscene without the reassurance of any overt ethical guidance. In a parallel scene in The La%y Boys Richey attends a rugby after-match party and wakes the next day on the couch. Before leaving, he witnesses the hosts of the party, two reserves from the Otago rugby team, pack-raping a semiconscious girl in the bathroom. Having gazed admiringly on the athleticism of the male body in the rugby game the previous day, Richey now witnesses the abuse of that strength to dominate and violate a physically helpless victim: 'Naked next to her limp, pale body they are tanned and muscled and big' (p. 220). Amidst the devastating clarity of detail, what is notably absent is Richey's emotional response as a witness. In a general comment on this effect Shuker suggests that the writing 'seems cinematic because your narrator is in a state of shock and becomes almost entirely visual. The commentary or awareness of internal states is suspended in favour of a deliberately affectless spectation'.23 96</page><page sequence="12">Free to fair In comparing these two passages it seems Shuker could easily have adopted this technique from Less Than Zero' in both scenes a semi-comatose 'young' 'naked' 'girl' is 'tied' up and violently abused by multiple men, and in both accounts the narrator describes what he sees in a state of 'affectless spectation' where the visual details, such as the harm observed on the victim's body, convey the horror rather than any moral commentary.24 In 1999 Ellis commented that the last time he re-read Less than Zero he found the novel's climatic sequence 'way too melodramatic, way too over- the- top',25 and while many readers might feel the same way, the climax still retains its power to shock, acting as a focal point for the novel's wider concerns: how young bodies can become commodities, and the desensitisation of society to suffering. Richey's 'state of shock' suggests that his response is numbed by the awfulness of what he is witnessing, or possibly that his humanity has been anaesthetised amidst the institutionalised violence and misogyny he has become accustomed to, and expected to accept. As such, the melodrama Ellis detects in his own novel is absent from Shuker's depiction of similar content. Shuker's rape scene attains a heightened realism by its contrast to Marc Ellis's bawdy whitewashing of essentially the same act at the earlier after-match celebration (pp. 204-5), providing us with a precedent for what we are shown, but one which fails to terrify in the same way, signifying that the degree to which the reader can accept violence and abuse depends on the spin that is put on the act of telling. This idea is also implicit in the 'no shame' philosophy embraced by Richey and his peers - an unashamedly masculine construction intended to normalise any morally dubious behaviour within collective camaraderie (p. 6). Furthermore, in Ellis's novel Clay's whole narration takes place in a state of 'affectless spectation', whereas Shuker grants Richey far greater internal expression so that the occasions where interiority is suspended have a palpable impact. 97</page><page sequence="13">Journal of New Zealand Uterature The conclusions reached in Less Than Zero and The La%y Boys are significantly different in that while Clay decides he has to leave Los Angeles in order to escape - and survive - the self- destructive lifestyles of his friends, by the end of The La%y Boys Richey succumbs, at least on a textual level, to the internal and external pressures that have been mounting against his moral conscience. We know Richey is 'something of an imitator'; we could therefore read his rape and murder of Ursula as a manifestation of the behaviour he has been absorbing and fostering throughout the novel. However, on closer examination, the 'reality' of what actually occurs in this scene becomes problematic. The ambiguity about how literally to take the attack is a tension also prominent in Ellis 's third novel American Psycho. Richey thinks he has taken LSD just before arriving at the novel's final party, but he is not entirely sure, saying 'it was so small I couldn't even feel it in my mouth' (p. 274). Nonetheless, the brutal climatic monologue of The Lat^y Boys occurs when Richey is hallucinating, whether due to the LSD or some other psychological disturbance (pp. 293-5). Here, Shuker's use of parataxis and stream of consciousness creates a free-falling effect; the last pages of the novel disintegrate along with Richey's mind. In describing the violent rape, which occupies the first half of the monologue, the narrator adopts a detached, almost third person perspective, and instead of using 'here' and T, variations of 'there's me' occur seven times. This gives the impression of the narrator watching himself from a distance, and it is uncertain whether this indicates a drug-induced divide between mind and body, or conceivably that the rape is a fantasy which does not occur at all. In the second half of the monologue the prose regains its immediacy, but becomes increasingly sensual and overtly hallucinatory: Richey visualises Ursula's cries as red roses dropping petals that stain the carpet. When he moves outside the 'stars in a clear sky skewer [him] with splinters', an echo of William Blake's When the stars threw down their spears' - a line from 'The Tyger' that alludes to the war in heaven in Paradise 98</page><page sequence="14">Free to fair Lost and to the apocalyptic fall of the stars in the Book of Revelation.26 These intertextual layers thus register the tragedy of Richey's individual disintegration as a symbolic microcosm of western literature's great cataclysms, tantalising the reader with the distant spectre of divine judgement within a narrative hurtling to its conclusion without the comforting resolution of normative justice. The surreal, delirious quality of Shuker's writing here recalls those passages of American Psycho where Patrick Bateman is at the height of his insanity, such as the paranoid frenzy of 'A Glimpse of a Thursday Afternoon' (pp. 143-47), or the coked-up action movie pastiche in 'Chase, Manhattan' (pp. 333-39). Both these chapters use parataxis to evoke madness, and the latter lapses from first to third person perspective and back again, emphasising the deranged, fantastical unreliability of the narrator. Prior to his attack on Ursula, Richey opens up to her about his fragile emotional state, before realising 'I have confessed into a self-made void, called Ursula' (p. 290). This recalls Bateman's realisation that his 'confession has meant nothing (p. 362) after he confides in the reader during a moment of self-reflection. Richey also 'wants to say "I'm very sick'" to Ursula, but is unable to (p. 292), echoing Bateman's hilarious understatement when he admits 'I'm a pretty sick guy' (p. 338). For both characters, extensive reading in the true crime genre provides the precedent for what are potentially violent fantasies rather than actions. Given the subjectivity of the climax of The La%y Boys, compared to the ostensible realism of the majority of the narrative, the textual reality of what actually happens is withheld. In this respect it mirrors the 'story' section of the prologue (p. 3), which Richey acknowledges is subjective to the point of being deceptive, but while the opening 'story' was constructed to absolve his guilt, this final monologue serves to incriminate him. A parallel can be drawn here to Satan's self-aggrandizing speeches about the war in heaven in Book I of Paradise Lost, 99</page><page sequence="15">Journal of New Zealand Uterature which are shown to be unreliable when contrasted with Raphael's account of the same events in Book VI. Similarly, Julian Murphet's reading of American Psycho, which builds upon Elizabeth Young's seminal article on the novel, concludes that 'at the level of some putative diegetic "reality" outside the solipsistic chamber of Bateman's monologue, [the murders] probably do not happen'.21 In all of these textual evasions, the antiheroes' anxiety to conceal weakness is revealed. Ambiguities in the textual reality of a seemingly realist novel, particularly when employed in the depiction of deplorable violent crime as it is by Ellis and Shuker, force the reader to defer judgement and question the ascription of meaning, the mediating filter of hallucination functioning, in much the same way as Burgess's nadsat, to distance the reader from the action in order to destabilise their gut reactions and engage them on a philosophical level. The effect on the reader of this suspension and doubt is ultimately more intellectually complex and morally engaging than an automatic response to content that can immediately be gauged true or false, good or bad. The decision to allow freedom of expression to an antihero, while refraining from imposing condemnation on disturbing content, is described by Young as 'an act of authorial aggression in that the onus is on the reader to interject the moral values so conspicuously lacking in the text'.28 While her comments refer specifically to Ellis's American Psycho, they can be widened to the other texts discussed in this article; when reading Shuker and Burgess the reader is also 'forced to scrutinise his own values and beliefs, rather than those being provided for him within a Good- Evil fictive universe'.29 In a similar vein, the problems posed by the reader's attraction to Milton's compelling depiction of Satan have long been the subject of academic debate, from Blake's famous conclusion that Milton was 'a True poet and of the devil's party without knowing it',30 to Stanley Fish's thesis that Satan's charisma leads the reader to become an active participant in the narrative so that we too are seduced, we fall, and we share 100</page><page sequence="16">Free to fair the guilt of Adam and Eve.31 Comparable conflicts are at work when we read contemporary transgressive texts; we become vulnerable in our desire for cathartic engagement with the taboo, a risk which forces us to think and assert our moral autonomy. We are constantly asked - whether by authors, publishers, reviewers, or critics - to read texts in relation to other texts, forming intertextual layers that guide and manipulate readerly response. As a junction of various discourses and literary antecedents, The La%y Boys is transgressive in its source material, as well as in Shuker's willingness to experiment with the possibilities of intertextuality. Shuker intentionally evokes Satan as an archetypal transgressor and literary ancestor to his ogcharacter Richey, and yet by doing so he draws on the depictions of other infamous antiheroes in contemporary fiction. By transposing this tradition to provincial New Zealand, Shuker confronts his reader with a representation of moral squalor and sexual violence that uses vicious satire to illuminate a dark underside to his country's masculine identity. In the final moment of The La%y Boys Richey beholds his reflection and sees 'no devil just a pallid oval with no eyes and a gaping maw for a mouth' (p. 295), leaving the reader looking in the mirror not at a satanic evil, but one which is blind, insatiable, and anthropomorphic - a reminder that man was created both with the strength to stand and the freedom to fall.
