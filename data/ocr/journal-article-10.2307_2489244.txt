<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Influence of Involvement on Disaggregate Attribute Choice Models DENNIS H. GENSCH RAJSHEKHAR G. JAVALGI* The state of the art in applying the various disaggregate choice algorithms is to assume homogeneity of choice process within the population being analyzed. This article uses the involvement variable a priori to categorize the (sample) population into a high-involvement segment using a modej that, assumes a simultaneous or alternative processing approach and a low-involvement segment using a model that assumes a hierarchical or an attribute processing approach. Empirical results indicate increased predictive accuracy and diagnostic information that is more closely related to established consumer behavior theory. A n important aspect of understanding consumer A28, behavior is the study of the choice process. Mul- tiattribute choice models, in which the alternatives are viewed as a collection of attributes as opposed to enti- ties, are used to predict individual choices and the sa- lience of the attributes influencing the choice distri- bution. Individual level choice models, those developed for a specific individual, are rich in theory as to how and why particular choices evolve but have had limited practical application. Decision makers generally want information on how groups of individuals or popula- tions will respond when confronted with various choice alternatives. Disaggregate level choice models use the individual level judgments and ratings to estimate pa- rameters for the entire population involved. This article will focus on the disaggregate multiattri- bute choice models. The concept that people generally evaluate alternatives on the basis of the alternatives' attributes rather than "gestalt" or as single entities is supported in the literature of numerous disciplines, e.g., economics (Lancaster 197 1), psychology (Tversky 1972), artificial intelligence (Newell and Simon 1972), and marketing (Bettman 1979). The different multiat- tribute models that attempt to explain the choice process tend to postulate different relationships among attribute values in determining the chosen alternative. These models, which come with diverse structural forms, pur- poses, and assumptions, can be divided into two broad classes. The first type can be labeled as a simultaneous process and assumes that the values of all attributes of an alternative are simultaneously combined into one functional linear (or nonlinear) form. It is assumed that the individual selects the highest scoring alternative. Models of this class include regression, logit, probit, LINMAP, and conjoint analysis. Simultaneous models can be further dichotomized as to whether they use ob- servation data or require more controlled designs in the data gathering, as does conjoint. We will limit our dis- cussion to only those attribute choice models that allow the respondents to specify the attribute rating values they feel appropriate, i.e., the type of observational data common to survey questionnaires that ask respondents to rate the attributes of various alternatives. The second broad type of attribute model, labeled the hierarchical model, evaluates the attributes embod- ied in an alternative one at a time in a hierarchical (se- quential) manner. In this structure, a high score on one attribute will not compensate for the low score on a previously evaluated attribute. Elimination-by-aspect, maximum likelihood hierarchical, HIARC, PRETREE, nested logit, and lexicographic models fall under this class. The vast majority of all empirical applications for modeling multiple choice problems, where multiple al- ternatives are considered prior to selecting the chosen alternative, have utilized the simultaneous model (Cur- rim 1982; Doyle 1977; Flath and Leonard 1979; Gensch and Recker 1979; Green 1978; Malhotra 1984; Punj and Staelin 1978; Rao and Winter 1978). One reason for the extensive use of this structure is related to the early development of a number of efficient algorithms using a simultaneous structure that allowed the model builder to analyze data. Recently, the lexicographic or hierarchical approach is receiving increased attention as algorithms for disaggregate hierarchical models are being proposed in the literature (Gensch and Svestka 1979, 1984; McFadden 1978; Tversky and Sattath 1979). *Dennis H.

June 1987</page><page sequence="2">72 THE JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH The current state of the modeling approach for the various disaggregate attribute choice models is to gen- erally assume that all members of a given (sample) pop- ulation are homogeneous with respect to the particular type of choice model utilized.' While it has been sug- gested that different segments of the population may have significantly different parameter values (coeffi- cients) using the same choice model (Currim 1981; Gensch 1985), there has been no investigation of the possibility that different segments of the population should be represented by entirely different choice pro- cesses on the same decision-some using a simulta- neous compensatory process, others a hierarchical. This article suggests that instead of assuming and applying one type of choice model to the entire (sample) popu- lation, one can find variables by which a sample can be a priori partitioned into segments that are assumed to be using different decision processes. Disaggregate modeling can and should take this into account. Consumer behavior literature at both the theoretical and the empirical level suggests variables that influence the type of choice process an individual will use. At the theoretical level, Howard and Sheth (1969), Hansen (1972), and Howard (1977) all postulated that individ- uals differing on such variables as level of current in- formation, involvement, and past experience tend to use different decision structures (models) in making choice decisions. In empirical work using individual level models, Bettman and Park (1980), Newell and Si- mon (1972), Rothschild (1974), Rothschild and Hous- ton (1977), and Laurent and Kapfirer (1985) found that such variables as knowledge, involvement, perceived risk, and others influenced the type of decision process an individual would tend to use on a given choice sit- uation. In this article, the focus will be on the possibility that the variable involvement may be of use in a priori partitioning of a (sample) population into segments as- sumed to be using different choice processes. Since there are a number of review articles on disaggregate choice models that explain the various algorithms, provide empirical applications, and discuss the underlying the- ory of the particular models (Corstjens and Gautschi 1983; Gensch and Svestka 1984; Malhotra 1984; Shocker and Srinivasan 1979), we will not discuss the various disaggregate choice models in detail. Next, a brief discussion on the involvement construct is presented. The third section features the design of the study, which includes a data description. The fourth section provides empirical findings. Statistical tests on the predictive accuracy or goodness-of-fit indices are presented, and the differences in diagnostic information provided to managers are discussed. INVOLVEMENT CONSTRUCT Though the involvement concept has been researched extensively over the past three decades, substantial am- biguity as to its nature exists. The concept appears to be both multidimensional and multifaceted where the definition and method of operationalizing often varies from one application to another. Major areas of appli- cation include commitment (Assael 1981; Howard and Sheth 1969; Lastovicka and Gardner 1979; Robertson 1976), communication involvement (Krugman 1965, 1966), purchase importance (Engel and Blackwell 1982; Howard and Sheth 1969; Hupfer and Gardner 1971; Kassarjian 1978; Ray 1973), situational involvement (Houston and Rothschild 1977), and ego involvement (Sherif and Cantril 1947; Sherif, Sherif, and Nebergall 1965). Many authors have extensively reviewed this area of research and theory (Arora 1982; Engel and Blackwell 1982; Laurent and Kapfirer 1985; Ray 1973; Robertson 1976). The lack of agreement on what constitutes involve- ment is acknowledged throughout this literature. Las- tovicka and Gardner (1979, p. 48) state that there is "no clear statement or agreement on what this concept of involvement represents." Tyebjee (1979, p. 298) ob- served that "there is little agreement about the definition of involvement." Muncy and Hunt (1981) summarized the literature on involvement by noting that agreement on the nature of the involvement concept doesn't exist at present because involvement is defined differently depending on the situational context. A second major theme of this literature is that em- pirical work is desperately needed to test the various theories of involvement. However, the lack of agree- ment as to the definition of involvement places any re- searcher attempting to work empirically with this con- cept in a precarious position. No matter what definition is used, it is open to challenge and the accusation that any empirical work based upon that particular defini- tion is irrelevant. Rather than delay making empirical contributions related to involvement until there is more consensus, we have chosen to recognize the conceptual problem and proceed in the following manner. We will develop a multidimensional construct of involvement for the particular choice situation analyzed in this ar- ticle. Our operationalization of the involvement con- struct is based upon previous theoretical concepts pro- posed in the social psychology and consumer behavior literatures. The empirical test of our involvement con- struct strongly supports the theoretical structure pos- tulated in the literature. Thus, one must recognize that the empirical results and basic conclusions derived from these results are conditional upon our definition and operationalizing of the involvement concept. The basic operationalization of the concept of high versus low ego involvement, as suggested by Sherif and Cantril (1947) and Sherif et al. (1965), is that highly involved individuals seek information on numerous at- 'While we are not aware of any multiattribute modeling approach that suggests using different types of attribute models for different segments, it should be pointed out that the concept of using different models for different segments has been suggested by researchers (Blattberg and Sen 1974; Jones 1973) in relation to stochastic brand choice models.</page><page sequence="3">INFLUENCE OF INVOLVEMENT 73 tributes but greatly restrict the number of alternatives explored. Actual applications of this construct of in- volvement have been made in political choice by Rothschild and Houston (1977) and by Lastovicka and Gardner (1978) in consumer choice of automobiles. These authors note that involved decision makers, in addition to looking at fewer alternatives in more depth, like to get personally or physically involved with the issue or product. Involved individuals are more likely to become active in the political process and to test- drive various models in the car choice. Finally, we add the observation that individuals who are more involved have a tendency to seek more advanced information on the issue. In our data set, developed for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a questionnaire was mailed to Iowa farmers who were members of a panel run by a profes- sional research firm. Farmers were asked to identify and compare their favorite cooperative retail outlet and their favorite independent (noncooperative) retail outlet. The farmers rated each of these outlets on 24 attributes and provided a ranking of each attribute's importance in determining where they would make their major fer- tilizer purchase.2 Farmers also indicated from which outlet they actually made their major fertilizer purchase that year. Only farmers who indicated that they had at least four retail outlets to choose from were included. This was an attempt to eliminate "captive" customers who did not have the range of choices available to most Iowa farmers. A random sample of 500 farmers was selected from the approximately 850 respondents who met the above criteria. Based upon the literature, we have postulated three elements of an involved decision maker in choice sit- uations dealing with suppliers, products, or brands: 1. Involved individuals seek more information per al- ternative on fewer alternatives. 2. Involved individuals like to physically or personally participate with elements related to the choice situ- ation when possible. 3. Involved individuals seek advanced sophisticated training or education on issues they are involved in. Within the situational context of farmers choosing a retail outlet, we operationalize these three elements of involvement as follows: First, the farmers were asked to indicate how many retail outlets they seriously con- sidered and sought information from prior to deciding which one they would purchase their fertilizer from. Those who sought information from more than three retail outlets were postulated as low-involved decision makers. This widespread gathering of information seems to indicate that this group did not have strong prior preferences for a narrow range of sources (dealers). Second, farmers were asked if they applied the fertilizer themselves, using their own equipment or equipment provided by a supplier, or hired someone to apply the fertilizer. High ego-involved farmers were postulated as those who would apply their own fertilizer. Third, farmers were asked if they had ever taken any courses in fertilization or soil fertility at the college or vocational school level. Thus, the high-involved decision maker is defined as any farmer taking an advanced agricultural course re- lated to soil fertility, or farmers who sought information from less than four outlets and applied their own fer- tilizer. Farmers failing to meet these criteria were clas- sified as low involved. It should be noted that there was very high internal consistency among these three mea- sures. Of the 205 farmers who visited less than four retail outlets, 175 (85 percent) applied their own fertil- izer. Of the 295 who sought information from more than three outlets, 46 (15 percent) applied their own fertilizer. There were 94 farmers who had taken ad- vanced agricultural courses related to soil fertility. Only seven of these farmers were not in the group of 175 who applied their own fertilizer and sought information from less than four sources. This three-dimensional construct of involvement resulted in a high-involved segment of 182 (175 + 7) and a low-involved segment of the re- maining 318. Each farmer was asked to rate the importance of each of the 24 attributes in making a choice among retail outlets. A five-point scale ranging from one (extremely important) to five (not at all important) was used. Under our involvement construct, the number of attributes rated as extremely important should be higher for the high-involved than for the low-involved segment. The average number of attributes rated as extremely im- portant by the high involved was 9.52 compared to 6.01 for the low involved. The Z score measuring the sig- nificance of this mean difference is 8.56, which is sig- nificant at the 0.001 level. Similarly, the average number of attributes rated as a one or two (very important) by the high-involved group was 13.70 compared to 9.56 for the low involved. Again, this mean difference is sig- nificant at levels considerably smaller than 0.001. Thus, the empirical implementation of our construct of in- volvement has identified a high-involvement group that considers fewer alternatives but appears to take into account more attributes per alternative when making a choice than do members of the low-involvement group. Because our involvement criteria uses advanced ed- ucational courses and because of the range of suppliers that information was obtained from, we were concerned with the overlap between our involvement criteria and the concept of expertise or knowledgeability. In the questionnaire, farmers were asked to rate their knowl- edge of soil fertility and fertilizer practices on a ten- point self-perception scale (10 indicates nearly complete knowledge about the topic and 1 indicates very little 2The attribute ratings were restricted by the panel's research firm to two outlets per farmer as a practical information load limit.</page><page sequence="4">74 THE JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH knowledge).3 The average score on this knowledge scale is 6.18 and 6.29 for the low- and high-involved farmers, respectively. With variances close to 10.00 for both groups, the difference in knowledge is not significant at any meaningful level. Thus the concept of involvement, as we have defined it, appears to be different from the concept of knowledgeability. The influence of knowl- edge on the choice process is another variable that ap- pears useful in a priori dividing a (sample) population into segments that are better analyzed by multiple dis- aggregate models, assuming different choice processes, than by any single disaggregate model applied to the entire (sample) population (Gensch 1986). The relationship between level of involvement and type of choice process used is postulated by Rothschild (1974) when he states that low-involved individuals will use a hierarchical decision process (i.e., sequential) whereas high-involved individuals will use a large set of attributes combined in a simultaneous process. Sim- ilarly, Lussier and Olshavsky (1979) indicate that si- multaneous attribute evaluation models tend to be uti- lized under high-involvement conditions, when the number of alternatives is small and the number of at- tributes in the evaluating criteria is large, and by those with greater education. STUDY DESIGN The logic underlying this study is presented, and based upon this logic, formal hypotheses are proposed. The data set, in conjunction with the research design to be used in testing the hypotheses, is then described. Based upon the theoretical structure suggested by Rothschild (1974), one would hypothesize that a dis- aggregate attribute choice model that assumed a hier- archical (sequential) choice structure would be more appropriate for low-involved decision makers. Con- versely, a disaggregate choice model assuming a simul- taneous attribute choice structure is more appropriate4 for high-involved decision makers. If both of these statements are true and a reasonable method of di- chotomizing a population into segments of high- and low-involved decision makers is provided, it should fol- low that analysis of a given population, using multiple models that assume different basic decision processes, should outperform the current practice of assuming the entire population is homogeneous with respect to one choice model. The particular models we choose to represent the ba- sic choice processes are logit for simultaneous compen- satory and maximum likelihood hierarchical (MLH) for the hierarchical approach. The logit model popularized by McFadden (1974) has been applied extensively in the transportation and consumer behavior literature (see Horowitz 1980 and Malhotra 1984 for reviews of applications and discussions of the logit approach). In a number of actual applications, logit is clearly the state of the art for a disaggregate choice model that combines the attribute ratings in a simultaneous compensatory framework. The MLH model is a more recent algorithm (Gensch and Svestka 1984) that is a probabilistic dis- aggregate model that assumes a hierarchical choice structure. It is the only hierarchical model that we are currently aware of (see Gensch and Javalgi 1987) that uses intervally scaled attribute ratings and doesn't make the restrictive assumption that the entire population has the same sequence of conditional decisions. Thus, the MLH model uses the same data set of attribute rat- ings as the logit model uses. An appendix that describes the MLH model conceptually is provided for those readers who are not familiar with this model or its de- terministic prototype HIARC (Gensch and Svestka 1979). Our position is that logit and MLH are multiple models that fit the assumptions of our particular choice situation and are compatible in that they use the same attribute rating data as input. No claim is made that this is the only or best combination of multiple models by which to analyze a population. Based upon this dis- cussion, the specific hypotheses we wish to test are as follows: Hypotheses HI: The prediction rate achieved by the logit model is greater than or equal to the predic- tion rate achieved by the MLH model for low- involved decision makers. H2: The prediction rate achieved by the MLH model is greater than or equal to the predic- tion rate achieved by the logit model for high- involved decision makers. H3: The prediction rate achieved by the logit model (or MLH) for an entire sample is greater than or equal to the prediction rate achieved by segmenting the population so that high-involved members are assumed to use a simultaneous compensatory decision process (logit), and low-involved decision makers are assumed to use a hierarchical decision pro- cess (MLH). 3Researchers in both psychology and marketing have found self- rating scales, particularly on knowledge, to be quite reliable and useful (see Bettman and Park 1980; Lastovicka and Gardner 1979; Lich- tenstein and Fishhoff 1977; Park and Lessig 1981; and Raju and Reilly 1980). 4The term "appropriate" is examined in terms of both predictive accuracy and the underlying process implied by the diagnostic in- formation generated by a particular model. We recognize that statis- tically significant improvement in predictive accuracy does not by itself prove that a particular abstraction of reality (model) is necessarily better than another abstraction.</page><page sequence="5">INFLUENCE OF INVOLVEMENT 75 RESEARCH DESIGN As previously indicated, 182 of the 500 individuals were classified as high involved and 318 as low involved. The high- and low-involvement segments were ran- domly split into two samples. Each sample contained 250 individuals of which 91 were high involved and 159 low involved. The two samples allow us to use a research design in which we will calibrate models using one sample and then use the calibrated values to make predictions on an independent hold-out sample. By re- versing the calibrating and predictive samples, we gen- erate two sets of calibrations and predictions. To reduce the multicollinearity in the data set, the attribute ratings were factor analyzed. By observing the loadings on the independent factors and the average importance rankings of the attributes, nine relatively independent and important attributes were selected as the subset of independent variables for choice modeling (see Table 4 for a list of these attributes, and see Gensch 1983 for specifics on how the attribute space was re- duced and for a more detailed description of the data set). RESULTS In this section, empirical information is presented that allows us to test the three null hypotheses. The specific hypotheses on which empirical information is provided are all related to predictive accuracy and goodness-of-fit. Since a main purpose of any statistical model is to help the user to better understand the un- derlying behavioral process of the problem area being modeled, the various models should not be evaluated solely or principally in terms of goodness-of-fit or pre- dictive accuracy. Diagnostic information provides the insights and directions for managerial decisions. Thus, in the last part of this section, the diagnostic information provided by the various modeling approaches is dis- cussed. Analysis Related to Hypothesis 1 Hypothesis 1 states that low-involved decision mak- ers, as we have a priori defined them, will generally use a hierarchical process, thus implying that the MLH model is suited for this segment. The null hypothesis we then seek to reject is that the predictive accuracy of the logit model is greater than or equal to the predictive results of the MLH model. To test this empirically, we employ both the MLH and the logit model on the same sets of farmers in the low-involvement segments. First, the MLH model is calibrated on the low-involvement segment of Sample 1, containing 159 decision makers, and these coefficients are used to predict choices for the low-involvement seg- ment of Sample 2, comprised of 159 individuals. The process is then reversed, and the MLH model is cali- brated on the Sample 2 segment and predicts the choices of the Sample 1 low-involved individuals. We then use the same approach to predict the choice distributions of the low-involvement segments of both Sample 1 and Sample 2 using the logit model. Since both MLH and logit are probabilistic models, a correct prediction was defined as when the model estimated an individual's probability of selecting the actual chosen alternative as over 50 percent. The MLH model correctly predicted 131 of the 159 individuals (83.38 percent) in Sample 1 and 130 of the 159 individuals (81.76 percent) in Sam- ple 2. The logit model, on the other hand, correctly predicted 102 individuals (64.15 percent) for Sample 1 and 108 individuals (67.9 percent) for Sample 2. Based on predictive accuracy, the MLH model outperforms the logit model for the low-involved segments of both samples. A simple McNemar test indicates the statistical sig- nificance of differences in predictive accuracy between two models on the same data sets (Glass and Stanley 1970, p. 327). The Z statistics comparing the improved predictive accuracy'of the MLH model over the logit model are 4.14 and 4.04 for the low-involved segments of Samples 1 and 2, respectively. This allows us to reject the null hypothesis that logit predicts as well as MLH for low-involved decision makers, at the 0.001 level in both cases. Krishnan (1977) suggests that another important consideration in comparing predictions of probabilistic models is to compare the predictive strength with which each model predicts the chosen alternative. Let P* and Pt be the predicted choice probabilities of the MLH model for alternative 1 (A ) and alternative 2 (A2), and let 71 and flt denote the predicted probabilities of the logit model. If Al was the actual choice of the individual, one would expect that Pl aniJl ' would be close to 1. If A2 was the actual choice, then Pt and Il would be expected to be close to 1. In either case, the model for which the predicted probability is closer to 1 is a better predictor. For each individual in the sample, the decision rule for deemed superiority of logit versus MLH is shown in the following tabulation: Actual choice I I Al MLH is superior Logit is superior A2 Logit is superior MLH is superior Let F 1 if the MLH model is deemed superior X= for the i individual L 0 otherwise Also, let p = P (Xi = 1) for all i in the low-involvement segment.

We now wish to test the hy- pothesis that the logit model and the MLH model are equally good predictors of an individual's choice; that is, Ho: p &lt; 0.5, against the alternative hypothesis, HA: p &gt; 0.5. If n is large and p = 0.5, the distribution of R can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean n/2 and variance n/4. The criterion for rejecting or accepting the null hypothesis is: Accept the null hypothesis if Z &lt; Za; Reject the null hypothesis if Z&gt; Za R - n/2 where: Z= ( /2 and Zax is the upper a percentile of the standard normal distribution. Table 1 provides a comparison of the predictive strength of the MLH model versus the logit model on the chosen alternative for the two segments of low-involvement individuals. Using the decision rule shown in the earlier tabulation, the MLH model is superior to logit in 97 out of 157 cases (61.8 percent) for Sample 1 and 94 out of 156 cases (60.3 percent) for Sample 2. Both of these are significantly greater than 50 percent at the a = 0.01 level of significance. By rejecting the null hypothesis, we conclude that the MLH model outpredicts the logit model for the low-involvement segment. Thus, for the low-involvement segments in both samples a disaggregate model assuming a hierarchical decision process (MLH) outpredicts a disaggregate choice model assuming a simultaneous decision process (logit) in terms of both the rate of correct predictions (McNemar test) and the strength of correct predictions (Krishnan test) at statistically significant levels. Analysis Related to Hypothesis 2 Hypothesis 2 basically states that high-involved de- cision makers tend to use a simultaneous decision pro- cess. The empirical testing process is analogous to that described in testing Hypothesis 1. The logit model correctly predicted 73 out of 91 cases (80.22 percent) in Sample 1 and 68 out of 91 cases TABLE 2 COMPARISON OF MLH AND LOGIT MODELS FOR THE HIGH- INVOLVEMENT SEGMENT IN TERMS OF HIGHEST PREDICTED PROBABILITY ON ACTUAL CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE Sample Outlet MLH Logit Total Subsample size choice superior superior Tie choices 1 91 Al 11 21 2 34 A2 20 35 2 57 2 91 Al 13 23 2 38 A2 20 32 1 53 (74.73 percent) in Sample 2. The MLH model did not do as well on the high-involvement segments, with 50 (54.8 percent) correct in Sample 1 and 52 (57.2 percent) correct in Sample 2. The McNemar tests comparing the prediction rates of the logit and MLH models indicate Z scores of 3.22 on Sample 1 and 2.98 on Sample 2. This indicates that the null hypothesis, which states that the MLH model predicts equal to or better than the logit model for high-involved decision makers, can be rejected at the 0.001 level for both samples. The Krishnan Z-test results, which compare the strength with which different probabilistic models pre- dict the chosen alternative, are summarized in Table 2. Using the decision rule shown earlier in the tabulation, logit is superior to MLH in 56 out of 91 cases (61.53 percent) for Sample 1 and 55 out of 91 cases (60.43 percent) for Sample 2. The Z scores are 2.68 for Sample 1 and 2.35 for Sample 2. These scores enable one to reject the null hypothesis that both models have the same strength of prediction on the chosen alternative at the 0.01 level of significance. Thus both the McNemar test, which examines the proportion of correct predic- tions, and the Krishnan Z-test, which examines the strength of the correct prediction, indicate that the dis- aggregate logit model significantly outperforms the dis- aggregate MLH model when applied to segments of high-involvement decision makers. Analysis Related to Hypothesis 3 To strengthen our theory that segmenting the (sam- ple) population by appropriate decision processes more closely approximates reality and yields higher predic- tions, we compare our multiple model results to the standard approach that uses one model on the entire population. In other words, choice predictions are gen- erated by using the calibration and hold-out sample ap- proach and applying MLH and logit models to the two samples, which each contain 250 individuals. Table 3 presents predictive results using a single logit and single MLH approach on each of the two total samples. This is compared to the mixed model results, previously given, in which the logit model is used on the high- involvement segment and MLlI is used on the low-in- volvement segment of each sample.</page><page sequence="7">INFLUENCE OF INVOLVEMENT 77 TABLE 3 PREDICTIVE RESULTS OF THE LOGIT, MLH, AND MULTIPLE MODELS ON THE TOTAL AND SEGMENTED SPLIT SAMPLES Total sample: Correct predictions Segmented samples: Correct predictions Single Single Logit model MLH model Multiple models Logit segmentation MLH segmentation Sample 1 159 (63.6) 150 (60.0) 73 + 131 = 204 (81.6) 73 + 102 = 175 (70.0) 50 + 131 = 181 (72.4) (logit) (MLH) (logit) (logit) (MLH) (MLH) Sample 2b 161 (64.4) 161 (64.4) 68 + 130 = 198 (79.2) 68 + 108 = 176 (70.4) 52 + 130 = 182 (72.8) (logit) (MLH) (logit) (logit) (MLH) (MLH) an = 250. bfn = 250. NOTE: Numbers in parentheses are percentages. The McNemar Z scores comparing the predictive ac- curacy of the multiple model approach to the single model MLH for the total sample are 4.66 and 4.23 for Sample 1 and 2, respectively. These differences in pre- diction rates are both significant at the 0.001 level. Sim- ilarly, the McNemar Z values comparing the predictive accuracy of the multiple model approach to the single model logit approach for the total sample are 2.78 and 2.81 for Sample 1 and 2, respectively. Thus, the differ- ence in prediction rates between the multiple model approach and the single model logit approach are sig- nificant at the 0.001 level. The Krishnan Z scores comparing the strength of prediction for the chosen alternative for the multiple model approach as compared to the MLH approach are 2.25 and 2.03 for Sample 1 and 2, respectively. These values are significant at the 0.05 level. Similarly, the Krishnan Z scores comparing the multiple modeling approach to logit are 2.18 and 1.98 for Sample 1 and 2, respectively. These are significant at the 0.05 level. Clearly the improvement in predictive results of the multiple models over the single models is very impres- sive. However, before one accepts our hypothesis of multiple decision processes, one should consider the influence of segmentation alone. If the low- and high- involved segments simply have different value systems, running separate logit models on each segment should account for the predictive improvement. To test this, we combine the logit results for the low-involved seg- ments with the logit results for the high-involved seg- ments using the calibration and hold-out sampling ap- proach previously discussed. These values presented in the analysis of Hypotheses 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 3. Inspection of the segmentation results indicates segmentation to be an improvement over the single model approach. Yet the McNemar Z scores comparing the segmentation results with the mixed model results are all significant at the 0.05 level. Thus, while seg- mentation alone is an improvement on the single model approach, the use of mixed models assuming different information processing systems is still a significant im- provement over the segmentation approach. One can never prove a theory with empirical data. However, it is encouraging to see the regularity with which the em- pirical data tends to support the general thesis that multiple disaggregate models reflecting different deci- sion processes for high- and low-involved decision makers provide a better structure for modeling a pop- ulation than a single disaggregate choice model assum- ing homogeneity of the decision process. Diagnostic Information It is the diagnostic information that provides the in- sights upon which managerial decisions are determined. Thus, for most applied decision makers, differences in the patterns underlying the choice decision are often of greater relevance than differences in the predictive ac- curacy of the various models. The diagnostic information provided by the multiple modeling approach is considerably different from that provided by either of the single model approaches. Readers are encouraged to evaluate these differences and make their own judgments as to the value of the diagnostic information provided by the various mod- eling approaches. We believe that the diagnostic infor- mation generated by the multiple model provides better insights into the underlying choice process than the in- formation provided by either of the single model ap- proaches, because this information is more consistent with generally accepted marketing and consumer be- havior theory. Table 4 presents the t-values associated with the logit coefficients for the total samples (first column) and the high-involvement segments (second column) of the samples. There are two entries for each attribute. The top entry is the t-value for the coefficients generated by Sample 1; the bottom entry, in parentheses, is the t- value associated with the logit coefficients in Sample 2. The pattern of logit coefficients for the split samples are quite consistent.</page><page sequence="8">78 THE JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH TABLE 4 THE t-VALUES OF THE LOGIT COEFFICIENTS FOR THE TOTAL SPLIT SAMPLES AND HIGH-INVOLVEMENT SEGMENTSa Total High-involvement Attribute split samplesb segmentsc Honest, dependable 3.02d 1.95e management (3.71 )d (0.68) Miles from outlet to farm 0.71 -0.45 (0.75) (-2.61)d Blends fertilizer to needs 0.57 0.48 (0.64) (0.83) Relative size 2.92d -0.69 (3.07)d (-1.1 1) Provides good application (-0.15) 2.56d equipment (-0.11 ) (1.69)G Buys grain 1 94" 0.68 (0.76) (2.27)d Low prices 2.92d -0.64 (1.56) (-0.09) Makes deliveries on time 2.36d 1.78e (2.55)d (2.27)d Takes soil samples 0.73 0.87 (1.01) (1.73)e Log likelihood value -136.94 -48.138 (-136.40) (-35.884) a Unparenthesized numbers are for Sample 1: parenthesized numbers are for Sample 2. b n = 250; (n = 250). 0 n = 102; (n = 103). d Significant at .001 level.

The test statistic -2{L(6P)- [L(O') + L(02)]} (1) is the generally accepted statistic used in testing the hy- pothesis that the set of logit coefficients in Sample 1 (0t) is equal to the set of logit coefficients from Sample 2 (02). The likelihood functions L(O') and L(02) of the two samples are given in Table 4. L(OP) represents the log-likelihood function of the pooled sample of sub- samples 1 and 2. This test statistic is asymptotically distributed as chi square with k degrees of freedom, where k is the number of parameters in the model (see Chapman and Staelin 1982; Gensch 1985). Applying this to the total samples in Table 4, we get -2{(-275.95) - [(-136.94) + (-136.40)]} = 5.22 and -2{(-89.50) - [(-48.14) + (-35.88)]} = 10.96 for the high-involved segments. For nine degrees of freedom, the differences for total samples are not significant at a = 0.50. The value 10.96 is not significant for a = 0.10. Thus, one concludes that the patterns of logit coefficients are very consistent for total samples and reasonably consistent for the high-involvement samples. The three key attributes indicated by the logit models of the total sample are (1) honest, dependable manage- ment, (2) makes deliveries on time, and (3) relative size. Low price is very significant for Sample 1 and is close to the 0.05 level of significance in Sample 2. Remember, in the total sample the majority of the respondents are low-involved decision makers. The diagnostic infor- mation associated with the total sample indicates that general reputation and price are key variables. Honest, dependable management clearly is a reputation variable probably based upon past experiences. Relative size means that the retail outlet is larger (in terms of per- ceived dollar sales) than the other competing retail out- lets. Relative size may well be a surrogate for reputation, particularly for younger farmers without past experience upon which to determine reputations. Thus, based on the diagnostic information provided by logit on both total samples, a manager of a retail outlet in Iowa would conclude that outlets are selected on the basis of rep- utation, size, and low price. The key service attribute is the ability to deliver on time. The pattern for high-involved farmers indicates that the attributes of reputation, size, and low price are not particularly salient in their choice. Interestingly, the signs of the coefficients associated with relative size and low prices are negative in both high-involvement seg- ments. The high-involved farmers seem to pay most attention to service attributes such as: makes deliveries on time, takes soil samples, buys grain, and blends fer- tilizer to needs. Table 5 compares the diagnostic result of the MLH model on the total samples with the low-involvement segments. A hierarchical model such as MLH evaluates the alternatives one attribute at a time. The decision maker selects the attribute s/he feels most important in the decision process. S/he decides on a tolerance value for that attribute, and any alternative with an attribute value below the tolerance is eliminated from the choice set. If more than one alternative passes the first attribute tolerance, the decision maker proceeds to the second most important attribute with the alternatives still re- maining in the choice set and repeats the above process. This continues until one alternative remains or until all attributes have been evaluated. Attributes that have tight tolerances and are important tend to be more crit- ical in the choice process, as they will eliminate more alternatives than an attribute that occurs late in the choice process or has a wide tolerance. Table 5 indicates the percentage of the alternatives that were eliminated by each attribute in the entire hierarchical process. Col- umn one presents the total sample statistic; the top value is the percentage of alternatives eliminated by this at- tribute in Sample 1 and the value in parentheses is the percentage eliminated in Sample 2. The second column gives the same information for the low-involvement segments. Again, the diagnostic information associated with the low-involvement segments is considerably different from the information provided by the MLH model for the total sample.

While the attribute blends fertilizer to needs is very important for low-involved farmers, note the tremendous increase in the influence of reputation (honest, dependable management) and low prices in the choice process of the low involved. In summary, it is clear that the diagnostic information provided by the multiple modeling approach is quite different from the information generated by either single model approach. The information from the multiple model approach indicates that the low-involved deci- sion maker tends to choose a retail outlet based pri- marily on reputation and low price with some consid- eration given to whether the retail outlet will analyze soil fertility needs and provide a blended fertilizer. The high-involved decision maker trades off low price, and to a large degree, reputation, for service attributes such as makes deliveries on time, provides good application equipment, and buys grain. This pattern is not con- tained in either of the single model diagnostics. The output for the MLH model also indicates how many attributes have been sequentially considered in order to eliminate all but one alternative. For the low involved, over 40 percent made a final choice after con- sidering one attribute, 70 percent made their choice considering two or less attributes, and 85 percent con- sidered three or less attributes. This contrasts sharply with the high involved, in which only 15 percent reached a choice after one attribute and 53 percent made a final choice considering three or less attributes. Clearly the low involved make their choice using fewer attributes; for most of this group, it appears that reputation and low price decide the retail outlet. On the other hand, the high involved appear to use more attributes in mak- ing their decision. This finding is consistent with and supports the basic theory on ego involvement that high- involved decision makers, while considering fewer al- ternatives, use more attributes in making their decision. CONCLUSION This article questions the assumption that all mem- bers of a (sample) population are homogeneous with respect to the type (simultaneous or hierarchical) of de- cision process used. The authors are not aware of any published application of a disaggregate attribute choice model that does not make this assumption. The results of this research, based on actual agricul- tural choice data, indicated that for the low-involvement segment, the predictive power of the hierarchical model (MLH) was significantly better than the logit model. For the high-involvement segment, results tend to show high predictive accuracy for the simultaneous logit model as compared to the MLH model. The overall predictive results of the multiple modeling approach were significantly better than the predictive results of either single modeling approach. The diagnostic infor- mation generated by the multiple modeling approach implies very different patterns of choice behavior from the diagnostic information of the single model ap- proaches, and consequently, very different managerial actions by retail outlet dealers. One must be careful in generalizing from the results of this study. Other methods of defining or measuring involvement could lead to different a priori segments and thereby different results.5 Selecting other models than logit to represent the simultaneous process and MLH to represent the hierarchical decision process could change the empirical results reported in this study. Other variables, such as knowledge, risk, frequency of purchase, and so on may more accurately segment a population with respect to the basic choice process used by individuals. Thus, use of other a priori segmenting variables may substantially improve the predictive re- sults and understanding of the choice environment over what was presented in this article. 5In an attempt to provide some sensitivity testing on our definition of involvement, we computed the logit predictions for the 85 farmers who met all three elements of involvement and the 256 who met any one element. The predictive accuracy for the 85 was 80 percent, about what we obtained for our defined high-involvement segment (n = 182), and a significantly lower 62 percent for the expanded sample of 256.</page><page sequence="10">80 THE JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH We hope that the empirical results reported in this study will stimulate researchers to look closely at other variables related to the choice process and to question the currently accepted assumption of homogeneity of choice process. APPENDIX Researchers such as Newell and Simon (1972), Russ (1971), and Tversky (1972) indicate that for many problems choice behavior appears to be both hierar- chically structured and context dependent. Individuals seldom actually sum attribute values into a single score for each alternative with the highest score, as implied by the compensatory type models. According to Simon's view (1972), people would rather make ten one-dimen- sional decisions than one ten-dimensional decision. Consistent with this view, the Maximum Likelihood Hierarchical Model (MLH) was developed by Gensch and Svestka (1984). The MLH is a multiattribute model, in which the alternatives are viewed as a collection of attributes as opposed to entities. In MLH, the selection process in- volves the evaluation of the relative satisfaction of the alternatives attribute by attribute in lexicographic or- der-where this order is defined by the individuals' hi- erarchy of attributes as in the individual lexicographic model. Unlike the lexicographic model, the model builder does not have to know a priori cutpoints of each attribute of the individuals in the (sample) population. As in the lexicographic model, in the MLH model an individual evaluates the set of alternatives attribute by attribute, starting with the most important or first- ranked attribute. In rating the alternative on the most important attribute, say miles/gallon, the MLH assumes that people make relative rather than absolute judg- ments. For example, in the simultaneous compensatory logit model, which is based upon absolute judgments, it is assumed that a decision maker evaluates the desir- ability of 40 miles/gallon in absolute terms on a 1 through 10 scale (1 = not desirable, 10 = very desirable). The estimate, say 8, is absolute and will not change as other alternatives are added or deleted from the choice set. In the MLH hierarchical model, the desirability of perceived attribute level is a relative judgment; that is, individuals compare 40 miles/gallon on this alternative to the alternative in the choice set that yields the max- imum (best) satisfaction per gallon. MLH computes the tolerance (cutpoint) as the difference between the max- imum attribute score of the alternatives still in the choice set and the attribute score of the given alterna- tive. When an individual chooses an alternative which is k units (k = 20 miles/gallon) less than the maximum attribute score (say 60 miles/gallon), s/he indicates by actual choice behavior that s/he has a tolerance of at least 20 miles/gallon on this attribute. In the behavioral context, individual value scales may have different or- igins and scale factors. Thus, to aggregate, these toler- ances must be standardized. The MLH standardizes the differences by dividing them by the maxinium attribute score of the alternatives still in the feasible set. Thus, the standardized tolerances are in the interval from zero to one. The mathematical formulation of the MLH model uses the individual standardized tolerances to estimate aggregate tolerances (threshold values or cut- points) that apply to the entire population. Once the aggregate tolerances have been computed, the individual compares the tolerance s/he has on each alternative in the choice set to the aggregate tolerance on the attribute s/he considers most important in mak- ing the choice. All alternatives that do have an individ- ual tolerance greater than the aggregate tolerance are eliminated from the choice set. If more than one alter- native remains, the individual proceeds to the second most important attribute and repeats the process. Note that the individual tolerances are a function of only the alternatives remaining in the choice set and thus will shift relative to the changing set of alternatives still in the choice set. The above process proceeds until only one alternative remains or all attributes have been con- sidered. Readers interested in the mathematical for- mulation of this model, discussion of the assumptions, and application of the MLH to real-world data are re- ferred to Gensch and Svestka (1984).
