To better understand the connection between organiza- tional identity and how organizations relate to their stake- holders, this paper introduces the construct of identity orientation, previously applied at the individual-level of analysis, at the organizational-level of analysis and pro- poses that organizations have three distinct identity ori- entations: individualistic, relational, and collectivistic. In a field study using qualitative and quantitative methods and including 1,126 participants from 88 organizations in the legal services and non-alcoholic beverage industries, I assess the construct's viability, explore its properties, and analyze its predictors at multiple levels of analysis. Results reveal that organizations' relations with stake- holders constitute a prominent feature of organizational identity, that relations with external and internal stake- holders are perceived as tightly coupled, that both pure and hybrid identity orientation types are relatively com- mon, and that identity orientation varies widely among business organizations. Further, specific organizational variables bearing on organizations' stakeholder relations appear to be stronger predictors of identity orientation than general organizational-level or individual-level vari- ables. Implications for a range of literatures addressing organizations' external (stakeholder management, interorganizational relations) and internal relations (human resource management, psychological contracts) are discussed.* Identity processes are inextricably linked to individuals' and organizations' relations with others (Baumeister, 1998; Albert, Ashforth, and Dutton, 2000). Considerable research at the individual level has examined the identity-relations connection (see Baumeister, 1998; Fiske et al., 1998, for reviews). We know that individuals' identity is constituted largely of how they see themselves with respect to others (e.g., Baumeis- ter, 1998; Markus and Kitayama, 1991). Even traits meant to individuate the self from others such as "intelligent" or "cre- ative" are socially derived in that they are based on compar- isons with others (Sedikides and Brewer, 2001). Further, iden- tity makes interactions and relations with others possible. Our sense of self, for example, guides our sensemaking of those with whom we interact (e.g., Markus, Smith, and Moreland, 1985) and determines the messages that we send others (e.g., Swann, 1987). Recent work on identity orientation (e.g., Brewer and Gard- ner, 1996; Brickson, 2000a) provides an integrating conceptu- al framework for delineating the link between individuals' identity and their relations with others. This area of research suggests that individuals view themselves from three broad perspectives with respect to others: as separate and distinct from others, as dyadically connected to specific others, and as connected to others through a more impersonal relation- ship with a larger collective. Each of these three identity ori- entations has powerful implications for individuals' social motivations by cognitively focusing individuals on them- selves, their relationship partners, and their social groups, respectively (Brewer and Gardner, 1996; Brickson, 2000a). Ultimately, each shapes individuals' behaviors toward others and their emergent relationship patterns (Brickson, 2000b; 576/Administrative Science Quarterly, 50 (2005): 576-609</page><page sequence="2">Organizational Identity Orientation Brickson and Brewer, 2001; Flynn, 2005). Thus the identity orientation framework captures how one's relations with oth- ers are reflected in one's identity as well as how one's identi- ty guides social motivation and relationships with others. Yet our understanding of the link between identity and rela- tions with others remains largely undeveloped at the organi- zational level. We intuit a crucial link (Ashforth and Mael, 1996; Albert, Ashforth, and Dutton, 2000) but know little about how relationships are reflected in organizational identi- ty or how organizational identity influences these relation- ships. Though progress has been made in understanding how organizational identity is negotiated (Pratt and Rafaeli, 1997; Glynn, 2000), enacted (Golden-Biddle and Rao, 1997), and reacted to (Elsbach and Kramer, 1996; Dukerich, Golden, and Shortell, 2002; Foreman and Whetten, 2002), major empirical gaps remain despite the construct's 20-year history. There has been little attempt to systematically study the range of elements that actually constitute identity across organizations, much less to determine whether relations with others are an important subtext of these elements. And, though a few studies address how organizational identity shapes organizations' strategic responses to and interpreta- tions of their environments more generally (Dutton and Duk- erich, 1991; Gioia and Thomas, 1996; Glynn, 2000), none directly speak to how identity shapes organizations' relations with others. Applying the identity orientation construct to the organization- al level may provide insight into the link between organiza- tional identity and organizations' relations. While organization- al identity typically refers to those elements that members deem central, distinctive, and enduring about an organization (Albert and Whetten, 1985; Pratt and Foreman, 2000), identi- ty orientation refers to the nature of assumed relations between an organization and its stakeholders-are relations independent, dyadically interdependent, or derived from a common group membership? Identity orientation is reflected in the types of identity statements members make about their organizations. For example, the characterizations "the top performer in the industry" (individualistic), "accommodat- ing and loyal to partners" (relational), and "promoting the ecological sustainability of the earth" (collectivistic) all reveal a different assumed nature of relations with stakeholders. Each reflects a different interpretation of the organization's role vis-a-vis others. An organization's perceived role relative to others is arguably foundational in how it manages all of its relations, both external and internal (Brickson, 2007). For example, the organization understood by members as "the top performer in the industry" may readily switch suppliers and distributors to gain market share and provide members with high wages and prestige in return for long hours, while that conceived of as "accommodating and loyal to partners" may prioritize the duration and depth of external relationships and provide members with a nurturing professional environ- ment in return for loyalty. If we can understand how relations with others are reflected in organizational identity, we may be in a considerably stronger position to predict and to under- stand organizations' policies, practices, and behaviors toward 577/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="3">employees, customers, suppliers, competitors, alliance part- ners, and communities. We will also be better able to under- stand the effect that these self-views have for all stakehold- ers and for the organizations themselves. This paper explores the general properties of the organiza- tion-level construct of identity orientation and assesses its antecedents. The project stands to make several contribu- tions. First, it will enlighten us as to how and with what fre- quency relations with stakeholders are reflected in organiza- tional identity more broadly. Second, it reveals particulars about how organizations are oriented toward stakeholders. Specifically, it investigates the degree of consistency in orga- nizations' identity orientation toward external as compared with that toward internal stakeholders, the frequency and constellation of pure and hybrid identity-orientation types within and across two very different industries (legal services and non-alcoholic beverages), and the extent to which busi- ness organizations vary in identity orientation. Third, possible antecedents of identity orientation, with implications for iden- tity more generally, are addressed at multiple levels of analy- sis in a manner not possible with the smaller data sets typical of most organizational identity studies. Finally, if the frame- work holds at the organizational level, it would appear to offer a high-level framework for understanding organizations' relations with internal and external stakeholders. As such, it may advance and integrate a wide range of literatures aimed at understanding within- as well as between-organization rela- tions. It also offers a fresh perspective on these existing the- ories, many of which presuppose only two orientations. IDENTITY ORIENTATION At the individual-level of analysis, social psychological theo- ries of the self have traditionally depicted the self-concept as emphasizing distinctions from others. More recently, researchers have recognized that individuals can view them- selves both as independent entities separate from others and as interdependent entities closely tied to others (e.g., Markus and Kitayama, 1991; Triandis, 1989). Brewer and Gardner (1996) have challenged this underlying assumption of two self-views as still being overly simplistic. They pointed out that the self-representation as a relationship partner funda- mentally differs from that as a member of a larger collective, the first relating to a personalized dyadic relationship and the second relating to a more impersonal relationship to a larger whole. In this view, individuals conceive of themselves from three broad perspectives: as individuated by traits and char- acteristics that distinguish them from others (e.g., "I am a passionate researcher"), as dyadically connected to particular others through personalized bonds of attachment (e.g., "I am Kathleen's colleague"), and as members of a larger group or groups (e.g., "I am an Academy of Management member"). This three-part typology of self-representation has been empirically supported (e.g., Gabriel and Gardner, 1999; Kashima and Hardie, 2000; Kashima, Kashima, and Aldridge, 2001) and theoretically extended into an identity orientation framework that fleshes out the antecedents and conse- quences of each of the three self-views (Brickson, 2000a). This framework suggests that whether individuals employ a 578/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="4">Organizational Identity Orientation personal, relational, or collectivistic identity orientation has important motivational implications. A personal, or individual- istic, orientation is associated with concern for one's own welfare, a relational orientation is associated with an empha- sis on the well-being of particular relationship partners and on maintaining relationships, and a collectivistic orientation is associated with a concern for the welfare of the greater group as a whole (see also Brewer and Gardner, 1996). These different motivation states are reflected in individuals' subsequent relationships patterns. Until now, the conceptualization of organizational self-defini- tion vis-a-vis other entities has mirrored that previously held at the individual level. For much of its history, organizational theory has portrayed organizations as atomized actors (see Oliver, 1990), but more recently, researchers from an array of literatures have begun to view organizations also as intercon- nected with other entities (e.g., Freeman, 1984; Granovetter, 1985; Uzzi, 1997; Rao, Davis, and Ward, 2000). A dichotomy often results between organizations apparently defined as individual entities versus those defined as social entities, with no finer-grained differentiation between relational and collectivistic aspects of organizational social identity. For example, scholars in the organizational identity literature con- trast utilitarian identities emphasizing economic factors such as profit maximization (individualistic) and normative identities emphasizing ideological factors like advancing broader wel- fare (collectivistic) (Albert and Whetten, 1985; Gioia and Thomas, 1996; Glynn, 2000; Foreman and Whetten, 2002). Though not elaborated in the identity literature, early writings on normative organizations also hint at a relational compo- nent, whereby relationships are an end in themselves rather than serving a collective purpose (Etzioni, 1975: 11). In work on corporate social responsibility, scholars have contrasted organizations possessing a firm-centered orientation (individu- alistic) with those possessing an other-regarding, system-cen- tered orientation (e.g., Agle, Mitchell, and Sonnenfeld, 1999), with no distinction between other-regarding (relational) and system-centered (collectivistic) orientations. The human resource literature (e.g., Gooderham, Nordhaug, and Ringdal, 1999) distinguishes organizations that employ calculative poli- cies and procedures to ensure their own welfare from those that use more collaborative policies and practices, which combine relational (e.g., culture of partnership between the organization and the employee) and collectivistic (e.g., emphasis on common mission) components. Meanwhile, lit- erature on psychological contracts (e.g., Rousseau and McLean Parks, 1993) has long differentiated transactional contracts focused on independent goal maximization from relational contracts focused on a dyadic bond. Recently, the collectivistic notion of an ideological psychological contract has also emerged (Thompson and Bunderson, 2003), based on sharing a common overarching purpose with one's organi- zation. Therefore, though existing literature generally dichotomizes individualistic and socially focused orientations, it also intimates that relational and collectivistic orientations are meaningfully differentiable. If all three identity orienta- tions are in fact distinguishable at the organizational level, we need to revise our understanding of organizations' relations 579/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="5">to distinguish relational and collectivistic motivations and rela- tionship patterns. In the minds of members, organizations take on almost anthropomorphic identities separate from those of particular leaders or other individuals (Ashforth and Mael, 1996; Morri- son and Robinson, 1997). Organizational identity orientation refers to members' association between this notion of the organization as a whole and its stakeholders, either internal (members) or external (e.g., customers, suppliers, competi- tors, nonprofit organizations, etc.), defined as entities that affect and are affected by an organization (Freeman, 1984). It does not refer to the nature of association between top man- agement and other entities, nor to the sum of individuals' own identity orientations. In an organization with an individu- alistic identity orientation, members view the organization as an individual entity characterized by organizational traits that distinguish it from other entities (e.g., "Cha &amp; Laki is the most prestigious law firm"). The emphasis is on maximizing the organization's own welfare (e.g., status). In an organiza- tion with a relational identity orientation, members view the organization as an inter-entity partner and characterize it as having traits that connect it dyadically to particular stakehold- ers (e.g., "Lingo &amp; Jackson is a partner to its clients"). The emphasis is on enhancing the welfare of particular others (e.g., understanding clients' needs) and on maintaining these relationships. In an organization with a collectivistic identity orientation, members view the organization as part of a larger collective and as characterized by traits that connect it to a larger whole (e.g., "Falligant &amp; Johnson is closely tied to the Madison community"). The emphasis is on maximizing the welfare of the larger group (e.g., promoting the well-being of the Madison community). Like organizational identity, organizational identity orientation is distinct from organizational culture in that it is more purely cognitive in definition and involves the meaning of the social system as an entity, rather than meaning within a bounded social system (Ashforth and Mael, 1996). And, like organiza- tional identity, organizational identity orientation is culturally embedded (Hatch and Schultz, 1997; Fiol, Hatch, and Golden- Biddle, 1998) and negotiated with members (Ashforth and Mael, 1996; Scott and Lane, 2000). Of particular influence are profound cultural assumptions about the independent or interdependent nature of human relations, an especially influ- ential set of assumptions bearing on many others (Schein, 1992). Organizational identity orientation can be viewed in typologi- cal terms whereby ideal types are identified based on their combination of qualities across the three orientations (Doty and Glick, 1994). To the extent that organizations are more or less similar to these ideal types, they are likely subject to the same influences and outcomes. Unlike a taxonomy, however, this approach is not intended to classify organizations unam- biguously into mutually exclusive hierarchically nested groups (Rich, 1992; Doty and Glick, 1994; cf. Meyer, Tsui, and Hin- ings, 1993). 580/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="6">Organizational Identity Orientation Properties of Organizational Identity Orientation This study afforded the opportunity to address several impor- tant questions about the general properties of organizational identity orientation. First is the extent to which identity orien- tation is reflected in statements of organizational identity. Do organizations' perceived relations with stakeholders in fact constitute an important subtext of organizational identity, as individuals' relationships with others factor strongly into their identities? Second, what is the relative consistency in identity orientation across stakeholders? That is, do members per- ceive the organization as relating similarly to different stake- holders? Some have argued that an organization's identity can, and often should, change over time (Gioia and Thomas, 1996; Fiol, 2002) as well as perhaps across audiences. Gioia (1998) suggested that organizations, more than individuals, are given latitude for displaying "multiple personalities" because they are recognized as complex entities. As a result, they may be freer to display different identities to different audiences. It is thus useful to gauge the consistency in mem- bers' perceptions of how their organizations relate to external stakeholders, referred to as external identity orientation, and how their organizations relate to them as insiders, referred to as internal identity orientation. If organizational identity orien- tation were to differ between stakeholders, this particular comparison would be a likely place for discrepancy. Internal and external stakeholders are fundamentally different given their location in relation to organizational boundaries. There may be a sense, for example, that all organizational members are united (collectivistic internal identity orientation) against outsiders (individualistic external identity orientation). At the same time, forces also promote consistency in identity orien- tation across interactants. Organizational identity is socially constructed and negotiated with internal and external stake- holders (Czarniawska and Wolff, 1998; Gioia, 1998; Scott and Lane, 2000), both of whom seek consistency in organization- al identity. Insiders require consistency because of a psycho- logical need to make sense of their organizations (Ashforth and Mael, 1996), while outsiders need to know what the organization is before determining how to interact with it (see Albert and Whetten, 1985). In deciding whether and how to engage with an organization, stakeholders observe its interac- tions with others, with subsequent expectations locking the organization into behavioral patterns (Schilling, 2000). As a result of these processes, organizational identities tend to become generalized across situations and stakeholders (Scott and Lane, 2000). An additional question about organizations' orientations toward stakeholders is whether different identity orientations can co-occur within the same organizations. Case study evi- dence (e.g., Golden-Biddle and Rao, 1997; Pratt and Rafaeli, 1997; Glynn, 2000) suggests the existence of hybrid organi- zational identities, consisting of elements not expected to occur together. Yet it may be more problematic for members to view organizations as relating to stakeholders in complete- ly different ways (e.g., self-interested and other-oriented) than as having more specific divergent qualities (e.g., an urgent care and a rehabilitation facility). If hybrid organization- al identity orientation types do exist, what forms do they 581/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="7">take, how common are they, and what predicts them? We currently lack a systematic means of measuring whether organizations are in fact hybrids (Foreman and Whetten, 2002) and do not know how common they are relative to pure types. Further, though some preliminary antecedents of hybrids have been offered, little empirical work addresses them. Foreman and Whetten (2002) proposed that coopera- tives, by definition, have hybrid identities consisting of both normative and utilitarian components, given their simultane- ous ideological and financial focus. Size (Albert and Whetten, 1985; Ashforth and Mael, 1996) and age (Albert and Whet- ten, 1985) have also been proposed to foster complexity in organizational identity, but their effects have not been tested empirically. A final question about the nature of organizational identity ori- entation is the extent to which organizations vary in orienta- tion given a general organizational function. It has been pro- posed that business organizations generally have utilitarian identities (economic focus), while normative identities (ideo- logical focus) are found in organizations with cultural, educa- tional, or expressive functions (Albert and Whetten, 1985). This would suggest a preponderance of pure and hybrid indi- vidualistic organizations among business-focused organiza- tions. Such an assertion is consistent with Parsons' (1956) argument that organizations' values stem from their function, but this idea downplays the managerial discretion empha- sized in the identity literature (Albert and Whetten, 1985; Pratt and Foreman, 2000) as well as other literatures pertain- ing to organizations' relations with stakeholders (e.g., Baron, Hannan, and Burton, 1999). Leaders have considerable lati- tude in the values and actions they promote (Trice and Beyer, 1991; Schein, 1992), these based on their understanding of the organization's identity and its relations with others (Selznick, 1957: 26, 28; see also Gordon, 1991; Human and Provan, 2000). Predicting Organizational Identity Orientation In addition to uncovering central properties of organizational identity orientation, another goal of this study was to begin to identify its determinants. Theorists of various persuasions, including resource dependence (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978), organizational ecology (Carroll and Hannan, 1995), strategic decision making (Porter, 1980), contingency theory (Lawrence and Lorsch, 1967), and institutional theory (Meyer and Rowan, 1977; DiMaggio and Powell, 1983) underscore that an organization's location in its environment constrains its structure and behavior. Organizations' task environments (Dill, 1958) shape interrelationships and dependencies between actors, while their institutional environments dictate cognitive, normative, and regulatory structures (see Scott, 1998, for a review). Thus an organization's relationship with its environment molds its identity (e.g., Albert and Whetten, 1985; Carroll, Hannan, and P6los, 2000; Glynn and Abzug, 2002), affecting its very sense of "what we shall be" (Selznick, 1957; 65; italics in original). Organizations with sim- ilar relationships with their environment tend to share a sense of values and of obligations to others (e.g., Czarni- awska and Wolff, 1998; see Scott, 1998, for a review). In pre- 582/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="8">Organizational Identity Orientation dicting organizational identity orientation, it may therefore be necessary to consider variables characterizing organization- environment relations. Variables bearing on the structure of organizations' relations with stakeholders are apt to be partic- ularly influential in shaping organizations' perceived role and obligations toward others. I borrow the term "organizational form" from ecological theo- ry to broadly describe organizations that rely similarly on their material and social milieu (Carroll and Hannan, 1995). Organi- zational forms are hierarchically nested with increasingly specified subforms (Carroll, Hannan, and P6los, 2000). At a broad level, the material and social milieu confronting profes- sional service firms is markedly dissimilar from that con- fronting more classic production-based business firms, with likely implications for identity orientation. The unique nature of inputs and outputs among professional service firms engenders a different structure in firms' client and member relationships. Outputs of professional service firms are intan- gible and are not conducive to inventorying (Mills and Mar- gulies, 1980). They are tailored specifically to each client, aim expressly to improve the client's well-being, and are co-pro- duced through interaction with the client (Mills and Mar- gulies, 1980; Maister, 1982; Bowen and Jones, 1986). The output production process is primarily a relational one (Mills and Margulies, 1980). As a result, the dyadic relationships between the firm and its individual clients are much more central to professional service work than is typically the case with more classic production-based business firms, whose outputs can be physically created independently of users and inventoried for the ultimate purchase of relatively anonymous consumers (Mills and Margulies, 1980; Maister, 1982). There- fore, client relationships tend to be deep and long-term (Liedtka et al., 1997; Stumpf, Doh, and Clark, 2002), often lasting several decades. At the same time, the nature of professional service inputs promotes a unique relationship with internal members, partic- ularly professionals. Human capital inputs such as creden- tials, relationships with the firm's partners and clients, and reputation are more important than physical inputs in profes- sional service firms because of the intangible nature of out- puts and the importance of client ties to accomplishing and acquiring work (Malos and Campion, 1995). It takes far longer to gauge the extent of members' human capital potential than their physical potential. Further, the firm itself plays a crucial role in developing human capital among younger members by exposing them to clients and to more seasoned professionals. Therefore, professional service firms typically use a partnership structure to provide the firm with an oppor- tunity both to observe and to groom younger members before making a long-term commitment to them (Maister, 1982; Malos and Campion, 1995). By granting ownership sta- tus, a partnership structure also helps to mitigate against the serious danger of members leaving and taking valuable firm human capital with them (Malos and Campion, 1995). Profes- sional service firms' need to develop and maintain co-own- ers, rather than simply producers, means that the relationship between the firm and its members takes on a special signifi- 583/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="9">cance arguably best served through relational ties (Malos and Campion, 1995). Successful professional service firms are therefore adept at developing close relationships with both clients and members (Leidtka et al., 1997), while these rela- tionships are arguably generally less crucial in production- based industries. These differences will be reflected in differ- ent identity orientations: Hypothesis 1 (H1): Professional service firms tend to have a stronger relational organizational identity orientation than classic pro- duction-based firms. The nature of organizational subforms varies across indus- tries (Carroll and Hannan, 1995). Because client relationships are so important among professional service firms, a crucial distinction among them is likely the kind of clients served. Whether a professional service firm primarily serves corpora- tions, families and individuals, or nonprofit organizations, pub- lic agencies, and citizens' groups likely says something about its identity orientation. As Selznick (1957: 7) noted, when an organization develops a particular clientele, it gains stability but loses flexibility, with implications for its "very conception of itself." This would likely especially hold among profession- al service firms because client relationships are so central to their work. Clients' expectations would diverge sharply according to each of these client types, affecting firms' val- ues (see Gordon, 1991) and playing an important role in iden- tity negotiation (Albert and Whetten, 1985; Scott and Lane, 2000). Large corporations are apt to value a high status and more aggressive identity, common foci among individualistic firms. Families and individuals, generally less familiar and comfortable with the specialized domains for which they hire professional service providers than larger entities with more collective experience and knowledge to draw from, likely seek nurturing and concern in their representation. Finally, nonprofits, public agencies, and citizens' groups would arguably favor professional service providers who appreciate and, through their service, aim to advance the broad causes at stake, as opposed to focusing on firm profits or the rela- tionship itself. Professional service firms, too, are apt to drive the identity process (see Swann, 1987; Swann, Milton, and Polzer, 2000), catering to clients whose expectations are aligned with their preexisting identity. Further, engaging in certain activities over time would also cause firms to change their own self-conceptions (Ashforth and Mael, 1996; see also Bem, 1972), producing further alignment between client type and firm identity, which should be reflected in members' perceptions of identity orientation: Hypothesis 2 (H2): The type of clients served by professional ser- vice firms predicts differences in identity orientation. Specifically, firms serving corporate clients are more individualistic, those serv- ing individuals and families are more relational, and those serving nonprofits, public agencies, and citizens' groups are more collec- tivistic. Among production-based companies, subforms will be divid- ed along different lines than among professional service firms. One distinction relevant to several production-based industries (e.g., many of those in the agricultural, fishery, utili- 584/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="10">Organizational Identity Orientation 1 I discovered after inviting organizations to participate that two of the beverage com- panies were no longer privately held. One had recently gone public, while the other had recently been purchased by an over- seas public company, though it main- tained its own operations and the presi- dent claimed that it had a very separate identity. The nation's leading beverage consultant stated the opinion that the companies had "independent identities," so I allowed them to participate. Because there were no significant differences between these companiess and the others in terms of the composite score for any of the identity orientations, I retained their data in the sample. 2 Age data were not available for beverage companies not participating in the project. 3 For two law firms, I used data from a branch office rather than the main office because there were many more respons- es from the branch (10 and 8, respective- ly) than from the main office (1 and 4, respectively). ty, artisanal, construction, and industrial domains) and bearing heavily on production companies' stakeholder relations is whether the company is structured as a cooperative or not. Co-ops are created to benefit a particular collective, which may be the suppliers, customers, or workers (see Cronan, 2004). In any case, a particular group of stakeholders jointly owns the company. Beyond this structural difference in com- pany-stakeholder relations, the social milieu surrounding co- ops mandates their relating to both external and internal stakeholders based on collectivistic principles. For example, the International Co-operative Alliance, recognized globally by cooperators as the final authority for defining co-ops and for determining their underlying principles (Hoyt, 1996), recently adopted a "Statement of Co-operative Identity" explicitly asserting that, externally, co-ops are to educate the public and promote community welfare and that, internally, co-ops are to advance the principles of equity and democracy (Cro- nan, 2004). Hypothesis 3 (H3): Production-based companies structured as cooperatives have a more collectivistic identity orientation than those structured as non-cooperatives. METHODS Sample The study sample included 1,126 individuals surveyed from 88 organizations in the legal services and non-alcoholic bever- age industries. Legal services was an appropriate profession- al service context for the present study given the array of client types to which law firms cater, with considerable vari- ance between firms in this respect. Non-alcoholic beverages was a desirable production-based industry given that many companies specialize in agricultural products, some of these being organized as supplier-owned co-ops. The sample focused on privately held parent organizations, as they may have more autonomy over their identities than do publicly held organizations.1 Organizations with fewer than two respondents were excluded from the study, because single respondents are insufficient to measure shared constructs (see Kozlowski and Klein, 2000). By letter and then by telephone, I invited 201 U.S. beverage companies and 258 law firms to participate in the study. I col- laborated with both a beverage consultancy and a law firm consultancy to compile a list of organizations varying widely in product and practice type, size, and location. Thirty bever- age companies and sixteen law firms were ineligible to par- ticipate because they went out of business, went public, or had too few employees. Sixty-three of the possible 171 bev- erage companies (37 percent) and 83 of the possible 242 firms (34 percent) agreed to participate. Thirty-five of these beverage companies (20 percent) and 53 law firms (22 per- cent) successfully submitted at least two surveys. There were no statistical differences in size, age, region, or prod- uct/practice type between organizations that did and did not participate.2 A total of 361 individuals participated from the beverage industry, with 765 individuals participating from the legal services industry. Data from only the main law offices were analyzed here.3 585/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="11">4 The RIC and Organization-as-person ques- tions did not allow the differentiation of external and internal facets of responses. Because the RIC questions focused main- ly on external issues and because the Organization-as-person responses empha- sized the organization as a separate entity interacting with other distinct las opposed to embedded) entities, both were used to inform external identity orientation. A contact person at each organization was asked to identify a random sample of participants such that at least 10 would provide feedback. Respondents appear to reflect the existing diversity of positions and demographic features. I assured anonymity to both organizations and participants. In most cases, the contact person e-mailed an Internet URL to indi- viduals, asking them to complete the survey online. In some beverage companies, individuals filled out hard copies of sur- veys and sealed them in private envelopes, which were com- piled and returned to me. In both industries, the average within-organization response rate (11, excluding one law firm that submitted 209 surveys) was higher than that requested (10). Measures Organizational identity orientation. The survey included five identity orientation measures, four qualitative and one quantitative (see Appendix). The qualitative items were pro- jective and elicited general perceptions of the organization's identity, while the quantitative measure explicitly assessed identity orientation. The explicit measure followed the projec- tive measures so as not to activate specific cognitions. The Ten Statements Test (TST), derived from Kuhn and McPort- land's (1954) Twenty Statements Test, asked participants to complete the sentence stem, "My organization is _," ten times however they wished, elaborating each response on a second line. The remaining three qualitative measures were short essay questions. The first, the Troubling-event question (derived from Gabriel and Gardner, 1999), rests on the premise that organizational identities determine what aspects of issues are threatening (Dutton and Dukerich, 1991). Indi- viduals were asked to relay an actual or hypothetical event that had been or would be troubling to the organization. The Organization-as-person question is based on the principle that members tend to anthropomorphize organizations (Ashforth and Mael, 1996; Morrison and Robinson, 1997) and asked individuals to describe their organization as if it were a per- son. Finally, given that identity reflects "who we are as an organization" (Albert and Whetten, 1985), the Accurate-motto question solicited from individuals the motto they believed most accurately portrayed the organization. Qualitative mea- sures were coded for identity orientation, as outlined below. The quantitative measure consisted of three multiple choice questions derived from Kashima and Hardie's (2000) Relation- al, Individual, Collective Self-Aspects Scale (RIC). For each question, respondents selected either an individualistic, rela- tional, or collectivistic response to best describe their organi- zation. I calculated composite variables by summing codes across relevant measures for each external orientation (RIC, TST, Troubling event, Organization as person, Accurate motto) and internal orientation (TST, Troubling event, Accu- rate motto) such that each measure was given equal weight.4 Organizational identity orientation purity. To test antecedents of pure or hybrid identity orientation, I created a purity index in the individual-level data to represent the extent to which individuals viewed their organization as hav- ing a pure orientation of any type. I first created a purity 586/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="12">Organizational Identity Orientation score for each external and internal orientation using the fol- lowing formula: Purityioa = absolute value(100 - composite scoreioa) + absolute value(0 - compositeiob) + absolute value(0 - compositeioc). The composite percentage score calculation is described in the "Analysis" section. Possible values ranged from 0 (whereby the corresponding identity orienta- tion received the maximum possible composite percentage score, while the other two received the lowest possible score) to 300 (whereby the corresponding identity orientation received the lowest possible composite percentage score, while the other two received the maximum score), with lower values indicating greater purity on a given orientation. Purity z scores for each identity orientation were then calcu- lated, with the lowest of the three external z scores and the lowest of the three internal z scores taken as indices of external and internal purity. Predictor variables. At the organizational level, primary pre- dictor variables included industry (law or beverages), client type (law firms only), and cooperative structure (beverage companies only). The control variables were organizational size, organizational age, region, practice type (law firms only), and product type (beverage companies only). I obtained data through company information and collaborating consultan- cies. Individual-level predictor variables were also included in the study. Inductive case studies reveal that identity is some- times negotiated across distinct sets of individuals who appreciate and promote different aspects of the organiza- tion's identity as a function of their individual traits and char- acteristics. Given their potential importance, several individ- ual-level predictors-sex, age, tenure, functional area, and hierarchical level-were included in the study to ensure that organization-level effects were not clouded by or confounded with individual-level effects. Their inclusion also permitted an analysis of whether these variables are associated with con- sistent differences across organizations and industries in indi- viduals' perceptions of organizational identity orientation. Surveys provided measures of individual-level variables. Hier- archical level and functional area were based on responses to the question "What is your position?" Two independent coders from the legal profession and I jointly decided that seven hierarchical levels provided a sufficiently fine-grained portrayal of the law firm data, which included lawyers and non-lawyers. The two legal profession coders independently assigned levels to the various positions listed among law firms. Another coder and I did this for the beverage data, hav- ing agreed that seven levels also served the beverage data well. This coder and I also jointly agreed that eight functional classifications were appropriate across industries, which we independently assigned to all positions. These included mar- keting/sales, administration, information technology (IT), human resources (HR), operations, finance/accounting, gener- al management, and legal services. All pertained to each industry. Those in leadership positions in law firms were assigned to the general management function to distinguish them from other lawyers. Agreement for both hierarchy and 587/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="13">function was high, at kappa &gt; .8, and discrepancies were jointly resolved. Qualitative Data Coding There were a total of 3,668 qualitative responses from bever- age companies and 7,710 from law firms. I went through all the responses several times, one industry and one question at a time, to get a sense for the statements made. I coded whether the response referred to internal phenomena (how the organization relates to insiders and what it is like internal- ly), external phenomena (how the organization relates to out- siders and its nature as a whole), or both. Another coder and I then independently coded the identity orientation or orienta- tions reflected in a statement. Depending on its complexity, each response was ascribed either one, two, or, very occa- sionally, three internal/external codes, along with a corre- sponding number of identity orientation codes. Third codes were only ascribed when all three were of equal strength so as not to dilute the weight given to central themes. As an example of the coding process, I coded the statement, "My organization is cut-throat with competitors, but truly cares about me as a person" as possessing one external and one internal component. Later, a second coder and I independent- ly added an individualistic identity orientation code to the external code and a relational identity orientation code to the internal code. The second coder noted instances of disagree- ment with the number or type of internal or external codes I had given. We came to a joint decision on these cases. As I went through the data, I began to iteratively flesh out an identity orientation coding scheme for both external and internal responses within each question and industry, which the second coder and I later followed, and identified a total of seven identity orientation codes. Statements setting the organization apart from others or implying a focus on maxi- mizing organizational welfare were coded as individualistic (e.g., "aggressive," "ambitious," "profit-oriented," "status- conscious"). Statements connecting the organization dyadi- cally to particular stakeholders or emphasizing concern for the particular other's welfare were coded as relational (e.g., "caring," "accommodating," "considerate," "trustworthy"). Statements tying the organization to a larger whole or demonstrating a concern for the welfare of a larger collective were coded as collectivistic (e.g., "community-oriented," "promoting a cause," "politically active," "providing a public service"). Three other codes indicated the contradiction of each identity orientation (e.g., "not self-interested," "not car- ing," "not community oriented"). These were relatively rare and are not discussed here. Finally, a seventh code indicated that identity orientation was not implicated in the response (e.g., "old," "adaptable," "disorganized," "big"). I used several data analytic techniques in developing the cod- ing scheme. One was microscopic data examination (Strauss and Corbin, 1998). I often consulted a dictionary and the- saurus to discern subtle differences in meaning. Another technique was to identify all statements about a given theme by writing the theme name in one Excel column alongside corresponding responses (e.g., service to clients) to compare 588/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="14">Organizational Identity Orientation 5 Had the denominator consisted of codes rather than responses and not included identity codes equaling zero, the sum of percentage scores for individualism, rela- tionalism, and collectivism would equal 100 percent for each individual on a given measure. The chosen method has two advantages over this approach. First, it distinguishes firms with strong versus weak orientations by discounting scores as a function of identity orientation codes equaling zero. Second, the chosen method prevents measures from being strictly ipsative. Scores on multi-scale measures are ipsative when raw scale scores sum to a constant for every indi- vidual (Baron, 1996). Controversy has arisen (see Johnson, Wood, and Blinkhorn, 1988; Saville and Wilson, 1991; Baron, 1996) about creating scales with scores that are ipsative with one another. It may be questionable, for example, to correlate individualism on the TST with relationalism on the TST or to regress relationalism on collectivism. Such approaches are not taken here. Rather, the general data analytic approach is to regress each identity orientation on each predictor variable, which is a statistically sound strategy (see Greer and Dunlap, 1997). Analyses were also performed using pure frequency counts of codes for each orientation rather than percentage scores. The same pattern of results emerged across the two approaches. Data from the percentage approach are presented here because the frequency approach is weaker statistically due to high between-individual variance in the amount of qualitative data provided. Fur- ther, some have argued compellingly that, especially when motivations and values are involved, relative comparisons are more meaningful than absolute scores (Saville and Wilson, 1991; Meglino and Ravlin, 1998). them for differences in meaning (see Strauss and Corbin's 1998: 95, "close-in theoretical sampling") and increase cod- ing consistency. Depending on the theme's complexity, sub- theme columns were often added for further sorting (e.g., descriptions of clients-lucrative, poor, etc.). Eventually themes and subthemes were associated with identity orien- tations (e.g., "seeking lucrative and prestigious clients": indi- vidualistic; "caring deeply about clients": relational; "serving a needy population of clients": collectivistic). The second coder's data file did not include theme columns. Finally, in a few cases, in early iterations of the coding scheme, I drew on a very small subset of extreme quantitative scores to help inductively identify subtle underlying subthemes in qualitative responses. This is related to discriminate theoretical sampling (Strauss and Corbin, 1998), whereby elements are selected to maximize the opportunity for comparative analysis. For example, comparing a small subset of responses related to community service from organizations with high individualism versus high collectivism RIC scores revealed that the former alone referred to community service in terms of gaining visi- bility and competing with other firms. Using the coding scheme one question at a time, the second coder and I each coded a subset of data for identity orienta- tion and then discussed discrepancies and possible changes to the scheme. This continued three to five times until the scheme was considered complete. Then we coded respons- es independently, checking reliability once or twice. Reliability was strong, with kappa &gt; .7 on all questions in each industry. The second coder, blind to the organizational affiliation of responses, resolved all discrepancies to ensure objectivity. Table 1 provides sample responses on each qualitative mea- sure coded according to the three identity orientations. Analysis The general approach to data analysis was to calculate, at the individual and organizational levels, percentage scores for each of the three identity orientations for each measure by dividing the number of codes corresponding to a given identi- ty orientation on a particular measure by the number of total responses provided for that measure. When more than one identity orientation code was given for a response, each code was weighted equally. For example, an individual might have given three responses to the Ten Statements Test, all relating only to external identity orientation. Two responses pertained to two different identity orientations, resulting in one individu- alistic code, two relational codes, and one collectivistic code. The third response was given a zero for identity orientation. In this case, the individual would receive a 33 percent for external individualism (one individualistic code divided by three statements), a 66.67 percent on external relationalism (two relational codes divided by three responses), and a 33 percent on external collectivism (one collectivistic code divid- ed by three responses). Two things are important to note about this calculation. First, the denominator consists of responses rather than codes (and any response can have up to three different codes). Second, responses not coded for identity orientation are included in the denominator.5 589/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="15">Table 1 Examples of Qualitative Response from One Highly Individualistic, One Highly Relational, and One Highly Collectivistic Organization in Each Industry Highly Individualistic Highly Relational Highly Collectivistic Measure Beverage Co.

Many of the analyses consist of multilevel modeling using MLwiN (Centre for Multilevel Modeling, University of Lon- don) because this accounts for within-organization clustering by allowing both an individual- and an organizational-level esti- mate of variance. It offers several resulting advantages, including more accurate and generally more conservative standard errors and significance tests; stronger claims of causality due to controlling for any confounding individual- level clustering; and the opportunity to explore potentially revealing differences between such clusters (see Goldstein, 2003). Further, between-organization differences in sample size have little or no effect on results (Rasbash et al., 2004). Two multivariate across-industry models were run, one including the three external identity orientation composite percentage scores, and the other including the three internal composite percentage scores as dependent variables. I examined interaction effects between industry and other organization-level variables, retaining the only significant inter- action, between industry and organizational size for individual- ism and collectivism. I also included individual-level predictors with significance levels of p &lt; .10 (two tailed), through a process of backward selection, to promote parsimony in the results while controlling for, as well as exploring relevant indi- vidual-level factors. Between-organization R2s were estimat- ed for models with only organization-level variables as well as for models including relevant individual-level variables.6 Two additional industry-specific multilevel models, one for external and the other for internal identity orientation composite scores, were produced for each industry using the above pro- cedure. The variable "industry" was dropped, while practice type (control) and client type were added for the law firm models and product type (control) and cooperative structure were added for the beverage models. Finally, I ran across- industry and industry-specific univariate multilevel models as outlined above using either the external or internal identity orientation purity index as the dependent variable. Pure and hybrid types. To arrive at the various pure and hybrid types, I determined the relative position (e.g., bottom 25 percent, top 15 percent, etc.) of each organization's com- posite measure z scores for each of the three external and internal identity orientations. Using my grounding in the quali- tative data to inform boundary decisions, I identified five overall orientation types: strong pure, moderate pure, strong hybrid, moderate hybrid, and weak. The viability of identity orientation at the organizational level. Evidence of across-measure consistency as well as between-organization differences in the three identity orienta- tions support the viability of the identity orientation construct at the organizational level (Kenny and LaVoie, 1985). Tables 2 and 3 (see bold-faced numbers) reveal significant positive correlations across measures within each identity orientation for each industry. Median within-orientation correlations across measures were .62 for external identity orientation and .55 for internal identity orientation. To assess between- organization differences, a null two-level (organizations = level 2 and individuals = level 1) multilevel model was run for each identity orientation on each measure (Kreft and 591/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="17">Table 2 Organization-level Correlations within and across Measures for External Identity Orientation* Variable Sample Mean S.D. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1.

The quantitative between-organization differ- ences in table 4 are more vividly illustrated by the qualitative responses for each measure in table 1 (above) among one highly individualistic, one highly relational, and one highly col- lectivistic organization in each industry. RESULTS Before testing the hypotheses, I ran several analyses to ascertain the general properties of the identity orientation construct. To assess the extent to which organizational identi- ty orientation is reflected in general characterizations of orga- nizational identity, I divided the number of responses with at least one identity orientation code by the total number of responses. The majority of responses, 61 percent among beverage companies and 77 percent among law firms, reflected identity orientation. High correlations between external and internal identity orientation for each orientation within each industry demonstrate that members tended to view their organizations' relations with outsiders and with themselves as being similar. Correlations were r = .78 and r = .69 for individualism; r = .68 and r = .71 for relationalism; and r = .62 and r = .74 for collectivism among beverage com- panies and law firms, respectively, with all p values &lt; .001. Tables 5 and 6 outline the frequency and constellation of the various identity orientation types emerging in each industry. Nearly half of each sample is characterized as having a pure external orientation, with substantial representation across all three orientations in each industry. A sizable portion of orga- nizations in each industry is also characterized as having a hybrid identity orientation, again with considerable variance in identity type within each industry. A few notable between- industry differences emerge, however. Law firms, more than beverage companies, have hybrid identity orientations. They also provide exemplars of two hybrid types almost absent from the beverage industry data, those combining individual- istic and relational orientations and those combining all three orientations. Analyses provide little support for existing theo- ry on the antecedents of purity and hybridity. While all co-op- related results should be viewed with caution because there were only three in the sample, co-ops are actually purer in orientation than other beverage companies, this difference being significant in external identity orientation (S.E. = .19, 593/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="19">Table 5 Frequency of Pure Identity Orientation Organizations* Beverage Companies Law Firms External Internal External Internal Type Strong Moderate Strong Moderate Strong Moderate Strong Moderate Individualistic 6 2 3 1 5 1 10 3 Relational 4 0 6 0 8 1 3 1 Collectivistic 4 0 3 0 7 2 3 1 Total 14 2 12 1 20 4 16 5 % cases 40% 6% 34% 3% 38% 8% 30% 9% * N = 53 law firms, 35 beverage companies.

Organizations with strong hybrid identity orientations scored in the top 50% on more than one orientation, with at least one scoring in the top 25%. Organizations with moderate hybrid iden- tity orientations scored in the top 50% on more than one orientation, with at least one scoring in the top 1/3. The cri- terion of 25% was used because it was highly selective without falsely reducing the number of potentially qualifying firms. Had 15% been used, for example, the maximum number of qualifying firms would be 45% (maximum of 15% x 3 orientations). p = .05). Nor is there evidence that co-ops inherently balance individualistic and collectivistic identities. Two are strong pure collectivistic types, while the third is a strong relational/collec- tivistic hybrid. And although across-industry models reveal a significant relationship between size (log scale) and reduced external identity orientation purity (Beta = .08, S.E. = .03, p &lt; .01), controlling for within-industry variables reduces this effect to insignificance, while yielding the predicted relation- ship between age and decreased purity for external identity orientation among beverage companies (Beta = .04, S.E. = .01, p &lt; .01). The fact that all three orientations, not just individualism, are well represented in pure and hybrid types in the present for- profit sample suggests that a "business" function does not seriously constrain organizational identity orientation. 594/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="20">Organizational Identity Orientation Because these profiles are relative to other organizations in the sample, which all share a business-oriented function, I also analyzed raw composite percentage scores for all three orientations. No one orientation was particularly favored over the others, with average external and internal raw scores of 34 percent and 20 percent for individualism, 29 percent and 29 percent for relationalism, and 19 percent and 26 percent for collectivism. Predictors of Organizational Identity Orientation The two across-industry multilevel models tested the effect of industry on organizational identity orientation. Results are shown in table 7. In line with H1, professional service firms exhibited significantly higher relational identity orientation scores than did production-based firms. This was true for both external scores, which were 8 percent higher (S.E. = 2.6, p &lt; .01) and for internal scores, which were 9 percent higher (S.E. = 4.4, p &lt; .05). Also of note, professional service firms are significantly more individualistic externally and inter- nally than production-based firms. Consistent with H2, that the type of clients served by profes- sional service firms predicts differences in identity orienta- tion, law-firm-specific multilevel models show that client type significantly predicts all three organizational identity orienta- tions, both external and internal. Table 8 displays coefficients for each client type, with the corresponding p value showing significant omnibus differences between the various client types on each external and internal orientation. To test the specific predictions in H2, planned contrast analyses were performed using multilevel modeling with dichotomous pre- dictor variables for each contrast. These analyses demon- strated that firms focused on businesses were indeed more individualistic than others (Beta = 15.0, S.E. = 3.6, p &lt; .001) and that law firms serving nonprofits, public agencies, and citizens groups were more collectivistic than others (Beta = 27.7, S.E. = 6.4, p &lt; .001). Firms serving individuals and fami- lies also had higher, but not significantly higher, external rela- tional scores than other firms. With only two firms of that type, all corresponding results should be viewed with cau- tion. An unplanned contrast combining these firms with those serving multiple client types better fit the data (Beta = 12.9, S.E. = 3.2, p &lt; .001), suggesting that firms serving mul- tiple types of clients may also tend toward a relational orien- tation. Hypothesized relationships were found on internal identity orientation for firms serving business clients (Beta = 14.0, S.E. = 4.3, p &lt; .01) and for firms serving nonprofits, public agencies, and citizens groups (Beta = 13.1, S.E. = 4.8, p = .01). The relationship between client type and internal identity orientation was not borne out for firms serving indi- viduals and families, while firms serving multiple client types were again high on this dimension in an unplanned contrast between these and other firms (Beta = 13.4, S.E. = 3.6, p &lt; .001). Hypothesis 3 predicted that production-based companies structured as cooperatives would have a more collectivistic identity orientation than non-cooperatives.

This may be attributable to there being only three co-ops in the sample. DISCUSSION This study revealed some important findings about both the properties and predictors of organizational identity orienta- tion. In terms of properties, as with individual-level identity, relations with other entities are a prominent feature of identi- ty at the organizational level, weighing heavily in members' conceptions of what their organizations are as entities. Fur- ther, organizations' orientation toward external stakeholders (e.g., "we are the best," "we are nurturing to clients," "we advance the community's welfare") tends to parallel that toward their own members (e.g., "expects excellence," "cares for us as individuals," and "promotes teamwork," respectively). In addition, it is clear from the findings that, 598/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="24">Organizational Identity Orientation though pure types are common, organizations often simulta- neously maintain more than one identity orientation. This fits with Ashforth and Mael's (1996) suggestion that, given the complexity of organizational systems and goals, members may view their organization as having apparently contradicto- ry attitudes toward stakeholder groups. Finally, evidence here indicates that a business-oriented organizational function does not restrict organizational identity to an individualistic orientation. Rather, all three orientations were well represent- ed in the sample, indicating that businesses enact a range of orientations toward stakeholders. This study also made headway in identifying the antecedents of organizational identity orientation, with implications for organizational identity more generally. Organization-level vari- ables that influence organizations' stakeholder relations, such as industry, client type, and cooperative structure were important predictors. Law firms, given their client-based work and the structure of their internal labor market, tend to be more relational both externally and internally than beverage companies. It is perhaps not surprising that law firms are also high on individualism. Autonomy, creativity, and innovation, all engendering distinctiveness from others, as well as darker forms of individualism such as greed, are associated with professional service firms (Alvesson, 1993; Malos and Campi- on, 1995). Client type among professional service firms and cooperative structure among production-based companies also seem to play a significant role in organizational identity orientation. The relationship between these features and identity orientation was especially strong with respect to external identity orientation, which makes sense given the close association between these characteristics and relations with external stakeholders (clients and suppliers, respective- ly). Among law firms, client types likely diverge sharply in needs and expectations, with corporate clients eliciting an individualistic orientation and nonprofit organizations, public agencies, and citizens' groups facilitating a collectivistic orien- tation. Meanwhile, possessing multiple types of clients, which requires greater perspective taking on behalf of the law firm to move back and forth between clients, appears to promote a relational orientation. Among the beverage compa- nies, being a co-op owned by agricultural suppliers apparently fosters a concern for commonly shared principles such as community and the environment. In line with calls to improve our comprehension of the micro and macro forces promoting organizational identity (e.g., Hsu and Hannan, 2005), this study moves us closer to under- standing the extent to which identity orientation is influenced by forces at varying levels of analysis and generality. In addi- tion to industry, client type, and cooperative structure, this study also included broader organization-level predictor vari- ables relevant to all organizations, such as organizational age and size, as well as individual-level variables. According to existing theory, organizations should become more utilitarian and less ideological with increasing size and age due to a need to become more business-like in order to survive over time and to grow (Albert and Whetten, 1985). To the extent that individualism and collectivism capture these characteris- 599/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="25">tics, these predictions received little support here. Age results were not borne out at all and, while organizational size had the predicted associations among law firms, this was industry-specific and was driven by other variables such as the type of clients served. At the other end of the continu- um, the study also included individual-level predictor vari- ables. Case studies have revealed that people working differ- ent shifts (Pratt and Rafaeli, 1997), in different positions (Glynn, 2000), and at different hierarchical levels (Corley, 2004) may disagree about the content of organizational iden- tity. Though not tested empirically, it has also been suggest- ed (Albert and Whetten, 1985; Pratt and Foreman, 2000) that divisions in perceived organizational identity may also emerge along demographic lines (e.g., sex, age, and tenure) (see Tsui, Egan and O'Reilly, 1992; Nkomo and Cox, 1996) and functional background (see Gregory, 1983; Van Maanan and Barley, 1984; Sackmann, 1992). Some individual-level vari- ables, most notably sex and tenure, did predict certain per- ceptions of organizational identity orientation, particularly of internal identity orientation, but few consistent patterns emerged across industries, and these variables explain little in the way of between-organization differences above and beyond organization-level variables. Most of the explained between-organization variance is driven not by general organi- zational variables or by individual variables but by relatively specific organization-level factors bearing directly on the orga- nization's immediate environment, especially on the structure of its stakeholder relations. While structural variables, particularly those influencing an organization's stakeholder relations, do play an important role in predicting organizational identity orientation, it is also important to point out that these variables do not predeter- mine identity orientation. There was wide variance in orienta- tion type within each of the two industries and also a fair amount of identity variance within client types and (non)coop- erative structures. Further, to the extent that organizations choose their immediate environments and interaction part- ners, they even have some discretion over structural forces. The picture that is emerging, then, is one in which certain structural forces shape organizational identity orientation but in which organizations still retain considerable freedom to relate to their stakeholders in a wide variety of ways. This work also informs recent trends in the study of organiza- tional identity more generally. Organizational identity hybrids are a common focus in current research. One significant chal- lenge with this research has been the lack of a systematic means of identifying hybrids (Foreman and Whetten, 2002). The present study may advance our understanding of what does and does not constitute a hybrid, both by providing one approach to distinguishing hybrid and non-hybrid identity types and by differentiating internal and external identity components. At times, organizations are referred to as pos- sessing a hybrid identity when they may merely be balancing external and internal identity facets that are consistent with one another. For example, an organization viewed as both socially conscious (externally collectivistic) and as focused on employees as a family (internally collectivistic) may face chal- 600/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="26">Organizational Identity Orientation lenges in actualizing both identities. According to this study, however, these qualities would be likely to co-occur and there- fore do not suggest the existence of a hybrid identity. This study also provides what may be an initial test of some of the main theorized antecedents of organizational identity hybrids. That cooperative structure, size, and age did not compellingly predict identity hybridization suggests the need for more nuanced theory with respect to what produces hybrids. Other current trends in the literature involve reconceptualiza- tions of organizational identity. Martin (2002: 114) suggested that conceptions of organizational identity would be enriched by moving beyond a primarily integrationist perspective, assuming consensus and coherence among members about organizational qualities, to incorporate a differentiation perspec- tive, appreciating contested versions of reality between sub- groups, and a fragmentation perspective, appreciating inherent identity contradictions, tensions, and paradoxes. From a differ- entiation perspective, results show that divisions in percep- tions of organizational identity can arise as a function of individ- ual traits. That there were few consistent patterns among individual-level predictors and that these contributed little to between-organization differences, however, suggests that it may not be possible to predict patterns of perceived organiza- tional identity among subgroups a priori. It is also possible that because organizational identity orientation is relatively consis- tent across stakeholders, individuals generally experience the organization as relating to them similarly regardless of their characteristics. In this case, disagreements about identity ori- entation are likely fewer and less contested than are those about other elements of organizational identity. This study also furnished evidence for the utility of a fragmentation perspec- tive. The high level of both relationalism and individualism among law firms is reflected in a larger number of individualis- tic/relational hybrids than among beverage companies. This multiplicity of identities was often characterized as tension-rid- den, as in this law firm associate's description: My organization is struggling to define itself. This firm used to be a place where people mattered more than billable hours. More and more the firm has become focused on billing lots of hours and bringing in lots of fees. At the same time, the partners think they are maintaining this "we're a good place to work because we're not obsessed with money" type of atmosphere. It's not true. It has become a business, and that's that. Not to say the people who work here aren't great people-they are. It's just that-no matter how hard the partners try to convince us they think otherwise-the bot- tom line is now more important than the people. Meanwhile, organizational ecologists have also posed a reconceptualization of organizational identity, regarding it as a set of codes that audience members hold as an organization- al default that sets limits on organizations' expected features and actions (P6los, Hannan, and Carroll, 2002; Hsu and Han- nan, 2005). In this view, an organizational form consists of organizations sharing a common identity code. The current project may contribute to this perspective in two ways. First, it introduces one potentially strong aspect of identity code, identity orientation. A major criterion for determining the strength of a code dimension is its applicability to social and 601/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="27">moral expectations of appropriateness (Baron, 2004). The identity orientation ascribed to an organization (or organiza- tional form) outlines the fundamental basis for sanctioned organizational action toward its various audiences, or stake- holders. Only organizations behaving within the confines of what is expected of them, given the identity orientation that they have negotiated with stakeholders, will be seen as behaving appropriately. Second, this work may promote our understanding of which code violations are most consequen- tial. Though violations of various identity code dimensions may prompt penalties from audiences (Hsu and Hannan, 2005), breaches of identity orientation codes may be particu- larly problematic. Stakeholders tend strongly to resent and resist organizations treating them in ways that are inconsis- tent with the agreed-upon code of conduct (e.g., Baron, Han- nan, and Burton, 2001) outlined by the organization's identity orientation, viewing such behavior as a personal betrayal. In this regard, the notion of psychological contract violation (Morrison and Robinson, 1997) may be usefully extended beyond the employment relationship to that between organi- zations and their external stakeholders as well. Finally, this work has potentially profound implications for a wide range of work related broadly to organizations' relations with external and internal stakeholders. Because it deter- mines the basis for motivation and action vis-a-vis insiders and outsiders alike, an organization's identity orientation arguably determines how organizations structure and manage the employment relationship as well as relationships with customers, suppliers, nonprofits, and other stakeholders (Brickson, 2007). This would likely be reflected in different psychological contracts, human resource practices, and net- work patterns with outsiders. Gauging an organization's iden- tity orientation may enable us to better understand and pre- dict a wide array of organizational policies and behaviors, as well as their outcomes for organizations and their stakehold- ers. Further, the finding that external and internal identity ori- entation tend to parallel one another suggests that these internal and external patterns are apt to be relatively aligned, which is provocative for both theory and practice. Researchers have indicated that external and internal organi- zational life are related in the sense that employee empower- ment corresponds with service performance because it helps employees to serve clients (Schneider et al., 2000; Liao and Chuang, 2004). Here the external-internal link is far deeper. The suggestion is that, for example, organizations that nur- ture customers also nurture employees, and vice versa, because it is inherent in their identity. Limitations and Future Directions Much work remains ahead. One obvious limitation of this study is its correlational design. Some of the predictor vari- ables, such as client type, may result from as well as cause identity orientation. Longitudinal projects or case studies can help clarify how identity orientation develops. A further limita- tion is that, though the organizations here vary widely between and within industry, emerging identity orientation profiles are relative to one another and are therefore a func- tion of the present sample. Future studies should address 602/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="28">Organizational Identity Orientation whether, compared with the current privately held sample, publicly traded companies constrain the dispersion of orienta- tion types, given the externally imposed emphasis on share- holder wealth. Another important factor may be industry competitiveness. One significant finding is that even in highly competitive industries like beverages or law, increasingly dri- ven by industry giants, diverse identity orientations can sur- vive. But does competition reduce diversity by focusing orga- nizations narrowly on relative success? Might it increase diversity by fostering identity innovation? Yet another poten- tially influential antecedent is sector. This study shows that organizations with relational and collectivistic identity orienta- tions are not restricted to the nonprofit or governmental sec- tors, but how much between-sector difference is there in identity orientation? Are the other sectors similarly diverse? Finally, I have suggested that organizations do have discre- tion over identity orientation, but we need to know more about its origins and management. Does the founder play a particularly pivotal imprinting role (Schein, 1992; Baron, Han- nan, and Burton, 1999)? Is the founder's role exercised through choices about the organization's interaction partners, influence over basic underlying cultural assumptions, or some other mechanism? Can later managers or employees suc- cessfully renegotiate identity orientation through certain of these mechanisms? This study also highlights questions about consistency in identity orientations. These relate both to organizations that simultaneously balance different orientations toward all stakeholders as well as to those that have stakeholder-specif- ic orientations. The latter might be considered a special kind of hybrid, one with different faces as opposed to one with a multifaceted face. Are there special challenges and advan- tages to being one of these kinds of hybrids or another? Are some combinations of orientations more difficult to manage than others? Given the lack of individualism/relationalism hybrids among beverage companies and the recurring ten- sions noted in such law firm hybrids, these orientations might be especially problematic to maintain in tandem. With the obvious challenges, are there advantages, such as greater flexibility in relating to others? How do some organi- zations successfully balance different orientations, while oth- ers breach expectations and lose credibility with stakehold- ers? An Empirical Approach to Studying Organizational Identity The study raises some methodological considerations that may promote the empirical study of organizational identity. Although organizational identity has served as a productive metaphor (see Gioia, Schultz, and Corley, 2002), measuring it has proved challenging. To date, researchers have taken three main empirical approaches. One has been to impute organizational identity from related phenomena such as orga- nizational policies, procedures, norms, and marketing materi- als (e.g., Elsbach and Kramer, 1996). This approach is tractable and informative but arguably sidesteps the issue of measuring identity itself. A second approach is inductive case study analysis (e.g., Dutton and Dukerich, 1991; Golden-Bid- 603/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="29">die and Rao, 1997; Glynn, 2000; Corley and Gioia, 2004), which typically involves spending months with a particular organization. Researchers' vast experiences inform their understanding of the organization's identity. Unfortunately, the time-consuming nature of this method and an emphasis on organization-specific identity characteristics generally pre- clude comparison across a large number of organizations. A third method is quantitative and deductive (e.g., Gioia and Thomas, 1996, second study), whereby members rate on a scale the extent to which their organization typifies a particu- lar dimension. This approach enables comparisons across organizations and the identification of statistical relationships between identity and other variables. The risks associated with this approach, however, include forming an overly limit- ed picture of identity, falsely eliciting perceptions not central to the organization's identity through explicit questioning, and losing something in the translation by forcing participants to use researchers' terms. The general method presented here cannot replace the depth of understanding of a single organization gleaned from case studies nor the greater objectivity and time efficiency of pure- ly quantitative approaches, but it may strike a useful balance between these approaches. Unlike the quantitative deductive approach, the open-ended qualitative measures elicit individu- als' most salient perceptions of their organizations rather than requesting that they describe the world according to the researcher's terminology. Meanwhile, this approach requires less time investment per organization than case studies and enables comparisons across many organizations. The general methodology may serve both inductive and deductive researchers interested in other aspects of organizational iden- tity. Inductive researchers can use the rich and informative qualitative responses to produce multifaceted descriptions of organizational identity and to generate theory. Deductive researchers can quantify responses to test theory using their chosen theoretical lens. The present project has begun to forge the much-needed link between organizational identity and organizations' relations with stakeholders. It is clear that relations with stakeholders are integral to organizations' identities and that organizations' perceived relations vary widely between organizations. The study revealed substantial insights into how organizations are oriented toward stakeholders as well as the antecedents of organizational identity orientation, with implications for a wide-ranging set of literatures addressing both external and internal relationships. Evidence that all three identity orienta- tions exist at the organizational level suggests that, as at the individual level of analysis, we likely need to employ a finer- grained understanding of organizational identity, organization- al motivation, and organizational behavior than has been the case to date. This study provides further evidence that theo- ries portraying business organizations, or organizations more generally, as purely atomized or self-focused present an insufficient version of reality. Theories that dichotomize self- focused from socially focused organizations also appear incomplete and in need of revision.

Please complete the sentence, "My organization is _." ten times however you think is most appropriate. On the second line for each ques- tion, please explain your answer in more detail. Please try to think of ten items, but if you get stuck at the end, you may move on to the next page. When answering questions, think about your company in terms of those qualities that are most central (defining), distinctive (distinguishable from those of other companies) and enduring (long-term). Think about your com- pany as a whole, and not in terms of specific individuals or departments. Also, please answer in terms of how the company is rather than as how you would ideally like it to be. 1. My organization is (more detail) 608/ASQ, December 2005</page><page sequence="34">Organizational Identity Orientation 10. My organization is (more detail) Part 2 1) Please take a moment to write about EITHER an actual event that was troubling to your company as an organization or a hypothetical event that would be troubling to your company as an organization if it occurred. Why was or would this event be troubling to your organization? 2) If your company were a person, describe him or her. 3) What do you think is the most accurate motto of your organization? Part 3 Below are 3 multiple choice questions. Please select the ONE answer that seems to reflect what is most central, distinctive, and enduring about your organization and fill in the associated short answer. As before, please think about your organization as a whole and also about your organization as it is rather than how you might like for it to be. 1. My organization views itself primarily as: a) Distinct and standing apart from other organizations. What other organizations and why? b) A good partner to those with whom it interacts (e.g., employees, cus- tomers, nonprofit organizations). To whom is your organization a good partner and why? c) A good member to a larger community (all those with whom it interacts, as a common group; a group of organizations promoting a cause it cares about; local community; etc.). What type of community and why? 2. What is most important to my organization is: a) Working to improve the welfare of particular others with whom the organi- zation has significant and gratifying relationships (e.g., employees, cus- tomers, nonprofit organizations). Which others and why? b) Working to improve the welfare of a community it values and/or belongs to (e.g., all those with whom it interacts, as a common group; a group of organizations promoting a cause; local community; etc.) What type of community and why? c) Working to promote and maintain its own welfare (e.g., profitability, image, etc.). What type of welfare and why? 3. My organization is most concerned about: a) Its relationship with a greater community it values and/or belongs to (e.g., all those with whom it interacts, as a common group; a group of organiza- tions promoting a cause it cares about; local community; etc.). What community and why? b) Its distinctiveness from other organizations. What organizations and why? c) Its relationships with particular others whose welfare it values (e.g., employees, customers, a nonprofit organization). What others and why? * Researchers are encouraged to contact the author for advice on using these measures. t Pilot testing indicated that explanations for short responses, provided on the additional lines, were often essential to ascertain the deeper meaning intended and to differentiate between identity orienta- tions. Pilot testing also demonstrated that ten items were sufficient to assess between-organization differences in identity and were considerably less onerous for participants than twenty items. 609/ASQ, December 2005</page></plain_text>
