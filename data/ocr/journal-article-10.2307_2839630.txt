With Plate F. America, South: Archoeology. Hornell. The Archaic Sculptured Rocks and Stone Implements of Gorgona Island, South America. By James Hornell, F.R.A.I., F.L.S., Ethnologist 'EU to the " St. George " Expedition. During a visit (3rd to 12th July, 1924) of the " St. George " Expedition* to the island of Gorgona, 17 miles off the coast of Colombia, an important discovery of sculptured stones and neolithic implements was made by the writer. These were found on the shore of Watering Bay, on the east coast of the island. The sculptured rocks consist of (a) a large number of boulders whereon are deeply incised designs of archaic character-these lie well below what is now high tide level-and (b) a set of four bearing sculptures of comparatively recent origin, lying at a higher horizon, where they are uncovered by the tide for the greater part of the day. At the present time the sea is encroaching on the land in the locality where these stones were found. The butts of several old coconut trees are still to be seen in situ a considerable distance within tidal limits, and on the sand-spit itself several neolithic stone implements, little water-worn, v j. were picked up on the surface. Further, the majority of the older sculptures are on rocks close to the low tide level of spring tides, where it would be difficult under present conditions to execute them, as they are uncovered for a short time only each tide. i. The boulders bearing archaic sculptur-. ing formed two groups, a small series near the middle of the bay and a much more numerous one at the south end; the - former lay generally at about half tide level, the latter just above low water. In \- _ ; all cases the boulders chosen for sculpturing &amp; ' ' s - are of picrite, a dense, fine-grained, very '- ' ,;- dark igneous rock, of a rather greenish tint where weathered. FIG. 1.- THE MALE FIGURE ON THE "SUN The smaller series consisted of four GOD" STONE, PHOTOGRAPHED FROM AN OUTLINED RUBBING. rocks bearing sculptured designs, com- paratively well preserved, and a number of others whereon it was just possible to certify that designs had been incised. The four principal iocks of this series were by far the most important of those found, their designs being the most definite as well as the best preserved. They apparently had formed an ordered group centering round a huge roughly quadrangular boulder bearing on its upper surface the repre- sentation of a pair of rude ungainly human figures, male and female, each with a number of rays disposed around the head, forming a halo (P1. F, Fig. 1). These figures stand side by side, the man on the left, the woman on the right as one looks at the stone. They are graved upon a great conchoidal fracture which measures roughly 2 feet high by 2 feet 10 inches wide; it is almost entirely filled by the two figures. The male figure (Fig. 1) measures 1 foot 10 inches in height, inclusive of the head rays; the width is 1 foot 31 inches. The head is subtriangular, the features * Organised by the Scientific Expeditionary Research Association and under the direction of Commander D. Blair, .O.BE., R.N.R.

The lower part of the face passes into the trunk, through a slight constriction which may represent the neck. The body is short and stout, widening considerably in the abdominal region. From each lower corner of the wide trunk a straight short leg is given off, represented by a single broad, round bottomed channel, and terminated by a large out-turned shapeless foot. A straight penis of disproportionately large size hangs pendant midway between the legs. The arms are asymmetric and are the most peculiar feature of the figure. The right passes outwards from the shoulder, then curves downwards and, after making a whorl of two sinuous twists, turns upwards to the level of the shoulder, whence it curves in to the side of the head, to merge finally into the outermost ray on the right side thereof. The left arm follows a less involved course: after leaving the shoulder it forms a simple loop and then turns upwards to join the outer ray on the left of the head in the same way as its fellow on the right. The rays themselves are straight grooves radiating from the upper part of the head, ten in number, inclusive of those - - .~ ::\\j ~ into which the arms merge. \ l/g The female figure (Fig. 2) closely resembles ;/; /:. the male, except that the body is narrower, the lower limit of the abdomen not shown (possibly this signifies the use of a skirt or cloth wrapped around the body and legs), and the rays around the head, 13 in number, ;1 ;&gt; ;&gt; &lt;X&lt;t instead of 10. No mammo are shown. The puzzling sinuosities and also the striking differences between the right and the left arm );1 I .in the case of the male figure, are reproduced with exactitude, and leave no room to doubt that these were premeditated and had definite meaning for those who carved the figures. The outlines here, as is the case with all FIG. 2. THE FEMALE FIGURE ON THE the archaic sculptures yet to be described, "SUN-GOD " STONE, PHOTOGRAPHED FROM a AN OUTLINED RUBBING. are formed by broad, shallow, rounded grooves about 3 to 1 inch in width, the edges usually considerably degraded by weathering; depth about I inch or slightly more. Forty-eight feet S. 8 degrees W. of this central stone was another large one, sub-cuneate in shape, the largest and smoothest face inclined at an angle of about 40 degrees and oriented to the east. On this is rudely sculptured a stepped pyramid formed of four superimposed platforms, progressively decreasing in size upwards, The basal platform, or storey, is low, with a very wide step, the next is considerably higher, while the third and fourth are about equal in height to the basal one. The apical or fourth storey is very narrow, the height half again as great as the width. A bold gutter-shaped ray diverges from the outer angle of each platform and another from each of the inner angles of the two lower ones. Six circular depressions or cups occupy the face of the third storey and the upper half of the second. Below the straight groove which forms the base line of the pyramid and running into it, are two semi-circular gutters; the outer with a diameter equal to the width of the second storey. The ends of the inner one are continued inwards upon the face of the pyramid, the arm on the left passing within that of the right, giving the beginning of a coil. (P1. F, Fig. 2.) This stepped pyramid may possibly represent an early form of the pyramidal temples of Mayan and Aztec culture; this similarity and the presence of rays [ 82 1</page><page sequence="4">June, 1925.] MAN. [No. 48. suggests that the figure was intended to depict a temple of the Sun, such as that to Tonatiuh, at Teotihuacan in Mexico,while the six cups may represent astral divinities. If this interpretation be correct, then the two anthropomorphic figures on the central stone may well be those of Tonatiuh himself and of his wife (or sister) Metztli, the Moon. The curved grooves are more difficult to interpret; possibly the outer one was meant to represent the walled enclosure surrounding the temple pyramid, while that within, with its short coil, suggests the sacred snake, intimately associated with Sun worship. Similarly it furnishes evidence of Mexican culture having extended southward to the coast region of Colombia. This would be in agreement with the fact that the Indian tribes of the Pacific slope districts of Colombia (Antioquia, Cauca, etc.) preserve characteristics more akin to those of the Aztecs than to any other race.* The other two boulders of this group are both smaller and on each the sculptured design is that of a monkey. The first (P1. F, Fig. 3) lies 42 feet north of the central stone; the second (P1. F, Fig. 4), 15 feet east of it. The former is a stone three feet eight inches in length, roughly triangular in cross-section. As it lay on one face, it presented a ridge-like shape, the long axis north and south. On the sloping seaward face (1 foot 15 inches deep), oriented to the east, is the rudely outlined figure of a monkey, with a stiff upstanding tail arched over the back. The design is crude and even childish in conception, and without either vigour or artistic feeling, as will be seen on reference to P1. F, Fig. 3. The head in particular is weak in design. Two cup hollows, vertically disposed near the centre, are probably intended to represent the ear; the face looks downwards, the features represented by two deep " bays," one for the eye, the other for the mouth. The animal stands on all fours and it is difficult to be certain whether the artist intended to depict all four or two only. If, as I believe, four legs are present, then two toes only have been given to each. On the landward (west) side of the same stone, is a graving of a second monkey, executed in a similar attitude and design, but rather smaller (1 foot 4 inches in length). The second monkey stone, lying 15 feet east of the central " god " stone, is a large wedge-shaped boulder that lay on one of its two tabular faces; the other large face was exposed, with its inclination to the east. This surface measures roughly three feet in length by the same in width. On this is deeply and boldly graven the image of a large monkey (P1. F, Fig. 4), far more realistic in execution than the smaller ones on the other stone. It measures 1 foot 10 inches in length by an overall height, inclusive of the tail, of 2 feet 2 inches. The pose is one of alertness and very different from the downcast, lifeless attitude of the other two monkey figures; the head is held well up and the face in consequence looks forwards, instead of downwards. The tail, in place of being stiffly arched over the back, is bent down- wards at half length, almost forming a loop; at the point where the tip comes to rest upon the creature's back it passes into a terminal device that appears to be a bird's neck and head, the beak open so widely that the upper mandible forms a right angle with the lower. The former is strongly curved towards the distal end and, if we accept the device as representing a bird's head, it is probably intended for that of a flamingo. The absence of a tongue, apart from the form of the mandibles, rules out any idea that it is meant for the head of a snake. As in the other monkey figures the legs, of which all four are shown, are formed by a single deep groove. The legs of the right side (the animal faces to the right) are shown behind those of the left. Each of the former seems to be provided with three toes-they are somewhat indistinctly graved. The termination of each of the left legs is not shown, the distal part of the left fore leg running forwards and upwards * Encyclopedia. Britannica. Eleventh Edition, Article, " Colombia."

[June, 1925. to the margin of the stone, whilst the similar portion of the left hinder leg runs in a like manner as a deep wide groove upwards and forwards till it merges with the groove outlining the abdomen. The legs in all the three figures are flexed at right angles at the elbow and knee respectively. On the flank is a solitary shallow " cup " depression and another occurs towards the bottom left-hand corner of the stone. The graving is particularly bold, the grooves being from 14 to 1- inches wide, by fully I inch in depth. (To be continued.)</page></plain_text>
