(239 pages text, 439 photographs). Ernesto Veiga de Oliveira's work about musical instruments in Portuguese folk music is the result of many years of travel and research in remote regions of Portugal. With 439 photographs and 239 pages of text this gives a comprehensive and vivid image of Portuguese musical folklore in its present and historical forms. Although not concerned with Africa, it is most interesting to students of African music. The influence of Portuguese musical culture on Africa and the influence of African music on Portugal have often been the subject of cursory statements without very deep penetration into the matter. In Oliveira's work there are numerous photographs of instruments, particularly frame-drums, scrapers and flutes, which have their counterparts in West Africa. For instance in 1960, while in Nigeria, I noted the presence of Portuguese-type frame-drums among the Yoruba. Also some of the scrapers illustrated, particularly where anthropomorphic, seem to me very similar to some I have seen in Angola. Oliveira's book is a welcome source for students who would like to penetrate more thoroughly into the question of mutual influence between Portuguese and African musical culture. G.
