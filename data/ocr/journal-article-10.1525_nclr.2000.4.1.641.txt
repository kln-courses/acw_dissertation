CRIMINAL LIABILITY: BASIC TRENDS OF DEVELOPMENT Criminal liability of legal bodies has been an issue on the legal agenda since the mid-nineteenth century, when corporations began to play a role in social and economic life in the wake of the urbanization process and the Industrial Revolution.1  In the course of time, this liability turned from a narrow exception to the prevailing rule that prohibited the imposition of penal liability on corporations into a general doctrine, subjecting various kinds of legal bodies, almost without any limitation, to the authority of criminal law.2 In general, extending the scope of the criminal system to include corporations may be said to have developed along three lines, all of which are linked closely.  First, the doctrine of liability was expanded from offenses of omission to include offenses of active behavior.  At a later stage, the doctrine was broadened from absolute liability offenses to include offenses of criminal intent and, at the same time, it developed from a basis of vicarious liability to principles of direct liability.3  The result of this process is that, at present, corporations are routinely charged and convicted     1.

About a generation ago, struggles of varying intensity were still being waged in different legal systems against the imposition of criminal liability on corporations.  The leading legal opponent was the continental system, which had forcefully rejected, over many decades, the approach supporting the imposition of such general liability, maintaining that the appropriate point of departure on this issue is that of societas delinquene non-potest. Nevertheless, it should be noted that even in the continental system there were exceptions to this principle for certain groups of offenses, mostly those closely related to the area of public welfare.  Save for these exceptions, however, European countries preferred to focus on imposing liability on the management ranks acting on behalf or for the legal body, viewing this as a natural substitute for the imposition of liability on the legal body itself.4  In Anglo-American law, which had adopted the contrary doctrine acknowledging the possibility of rendering corporations liable, support was also voiced for a different approach.5  Also, in the Israeli Supreme Court, 4.

They made it clear that in their opinion, the issue at stake was “still under discussion . . . (and) the court is yet to reach the stage of generalizations, which usually evolves out of experience acquired through comparison and analysis.”6  A skeptical, dismissive tone is also evident in the statements of jurists who, in those years, defined the issue as “the less familiar and more esoteric area of the criminal liability law.”7 Times however have changed.  The last two decades have created a new socio-political-economic reality, characterized by a thriving common market in Europe, changes in the political regimes of Eastern Europe, intensive privatization processes in many countries that shifted many areas of activity to the non-governmental sector, and the creation of mega-multinational-corporations that are the result of acquisitions, mergers and takeovers. In a process that peaked in the second half of this century, legal bodies have actually assumed control of all forms of commerce and industry, to the extent that no economic endeavor is deemed possible without their involvement. This socio-economic reality has dictated, to a large extent, the change in the law’s approach to the imposition of penal liability on corporations.  Policy setters in various legislative and law enforcement bodies sensed that attaining effective, and mainly trouble-free, control of the economy through criminal law depends on a sweeping subordination of the legal bodies themselves, as far as possible, to criminal proceedings.  All this without restricting the scope of the personal criminal liability incumbent on management ranks or on those actually involved in breaking the law. Travel Group Inc. [1991] 3 S.C.R. 154 (Can.)

The socio-political-economic transformations affecting Europe with the establishment of the European Community also left an imprint on this issue. In 1988, the Council of Europe recommended to members of the Community that they should endorse an approach allowing the imposition of criminal liability on legal bodies.8  The Dutch courts had seemingly anticipated this recommendation and, in the mid-1970s, shifted course in this direction.9  France, on the other hand, changed its criminal law on this issue following the recommendation, and in the early 1990’s erased the prohibition against rendering corporations (personnes morales) criminally liable.10 In Anglo-American law, which had acknowledged the imposition of this liability, changes are perhaps less prominent but still very important and should be viewed as further corroboration of the prevailing approach, extending it to include distinctly non-economic offenses.  In the last decade, legal bodies in England have been charged with manslaughter, and some have even been convicted.11  At 8.

A further expansion of criminal liability in the United States also seems possible in another context, where permission was granted to press charges against a corporation after it had been dissolved.17 Notwithstanding these changes and developments, the theoretical underpinnings of the doctrine of criminal liability of legal bodies have remained its least developed element.  At first, the perception of this area as an esoteric notion, conceptually alien to the penal range, was responsible for the failure to encourage its theoretical development, turning it into a marginal concern for criminal jurists.18  The criminal domain was viewed as an instrument fundamentally designed to deal with human deviance, typically resulting from modes of thinking and patterns of behavior exclusive to human beings.  Thus, over forty years ago, an American jurist resorted to a picturesque metaphor and compared the growth of this topic in the criminal law arena to the growth of weeds, explaining that “nobody bred it, nobody cultivated it, Corporation: Is Ohio Prepared for Corporate Criminal Prosecutions for Workplace Fatalities, 45 Clev.

It just grew.”19  At a later stage, the perception of a practical contribution that could accrue from an approach imposing liability on corporations led to its expansion and development without making it contingent upon profound theoretical analysis or comprehensive empirical research.20  Distinctive pragmatic considerations were also at the forefront of the juridical development of this approach.  Thus, for example, it was explained that this doctrine “draws its vitality from a perception of legal policy,” stressing that the imposition of this liability “[promotes] the values that society wishes to protect.”21  Seeking to strengthen the doctrine’s foundations, other jurists stressed that the idea of rendering legal bodies liable is deeply entrenched in society, and its final formation is a result of the mutual relationships that exist between law and culture: It is not a legal fiction for the law to hold corporations responsible for their decisions; in all cultures it is common for citizens to do so.  When the law adopts these cultural notions of corporate responsibility, it does more than reflect the culture; it deepens and shapes the notions of corporate responsibility already present in the culture.  The law clarifies the content of what we expect corporations to be responsible for.  Thus, the law can require large chemical companies to be responsible for an inventory of all hazardous chemicals on their premises, a responsibility not imposed on individual householders.  More fundamentally, the law is not only presented with the cultural fact that a corporation can be blamed; the law, more than any other institution in the society, is constantly impacted to reproducing that cultural fact.  Thus, the Roman law tradition of treating corporate persons as fictions and the Germanic realist theory that law cannot create subjects (or that corporations are pre-existing sociological persons), both 19.

This paper is devoted to the examination, analysis, and evaluation of this new trend.  For this purpose, the basic parameters of the models developed for imposing liability on corporations will be analyzed while the following questions will be asked: To what extent do these models represent one evolving and continuous line of thought, drawing from one ideological approach?  And to what extent do they represent a change and a turning point in the basic conceptual approach? Generally, the importance of the independent development of the issue of criminal liability of corporations has grown as a function of the growth of its theoretical base.  This process is accompanied by a change from using ideas aimed at emphasizing the possible similarities between imposing criminal liability on individuals and the imposition of such responsibility on legal bodies, toward the formation of constructions underlining the unique structure of corporations. Consequently, the issue, in recent years, has moved away from the notion of adapting the imposition of criminal liability on a human being to its imposition on corporate bodies.  In essence, this is a process of imitation, moving toward the creation of new models of aggregation and self- identity, specifically designed for the unique structure and modes of operations of corporate entities. In Part B, the paper will present succinctly the conceptual weave of the two main methods for rendering legal bodies criminally liable.  These are the two methods now prevalent in Anglo-American law and in the legal systems that draw on them.  Their principles, therefore, 22.

The bulk of the study is devoted to an examination of newly emerging models related to this issue and their links to existing models.  In this context, a third method, the aggregation model recently proposed in American law, will be presented and analyzed in Part C. This model preserves its links with the basic ideas of existent models but at the same time, distances itself from them in an attempt to expand even further the criminal liability of legal bodies.  The misgivings concerning the scope of this development and its implications for the theory and basic concepts of criminal law will also be considered.  Finally, a fourth innovative approach, developed in the last few years mainly in American legal literature, will be assessed in Part D.  This fourth model, which is still evolving and is concerned with examining the separate identity of the corporation, removes itself even further from its predecessors and seeks to endorse different foundations and lines of thought.  This section of the paper will examine the advantages of the proposed model as well as some of its major limitations, its links with the prevalent methods, and the potential implications and concerns for penal law. B.  MODELS OF ADAPTATION AND IMITATION: THE FAMILIAR METHODS FOR  IMPOSING CORPORATE LIABILITY Anglo-American law developed two basic models for rendering corporations criminally liable: vicarious liability and direct liability.  Both models originated in the realm of torts.23  The basic legal structures were transferred from the civil sphere to the criminal arena, although a truly vital aspect, particularly in the direct model, was developed 23. For the general principles of the vicarious liability in the law of torts, see Patrick S. Atiyah, Vicarious Liability in the Law of Torts (1967).  For the origins of the theory of direct liability in the law of torts, see Laurence C.B. Gower, Gower’s Principles of Modern Company Law 193-98 (5th ed. 1992); Leigh, supra note 1, at 97-104. </page> <page sequence="11"> LEDERMANMACRO 1/10/01  4:26 PM 2000] MODELS FOR CORPORATE LIABILITY 651 within the penal realm. Despite the basic differences between the two models, in terms of their essence, structure, and to a large extent, scope, both models share a desire to adapt and imitate the imposition of criminal liability on human beings.  By relying on ideas of adaptation and imitation, the law attempted to ensure that “a legal norm that requires the existence of human characteristics might, in principle, apply to a corporation as well.”24  Basing corporate criminal liability on a formula resembling the attribution of criminal liability to human beings conceals a deviation from the basic principles that are entailed in the penal system as a whole.  The use of notions, such as adaptation and imitation, accentuates the intention to obscure these deviations, an act that is doubly significant within the framework of criminal law, which as noted, is wholly intended to influence human behavior.  These two models have common points of departure.  First, both point initially to human beings who, through their behavior, and, if necessary, through their mental situation, have created the foundations of the offense.  The two models then create auxiliary legal structures, through which they seek to transfer the liability or the behavior and the thinking patterns of this human being to the corporation, and thereby render it liable.25 1.  The Doctrine of Vicarious Liability The model of vicarious liability (which is the older as well as the more cautious and conservative of the two) is a 24. Modiem Constr., 35(4) P.D. at 380-81 (Hebrew) (Isr.). 25. The need to imitate the imposition of criminal liability on human beings does not exist when dealing with criminal omissions, where the duty to act is directly imposed on the corporate body.  See, e.g., Law Commission, Report No. 177, A Criminal Code for England and Wales, para. 30(1)(b) (1989).  It is only natural that the imposition of criminal responsibility on corporations started to grow from negligent omissions, which do not require, by definition, active commission or mens rea.  See, e.g., The Queen. v. Birmingham of Gloucester Ry. Co., [1842] 3 Q.B. 223 (Eng.) [Decision of the Queen’s Bench Division]; State v. Great Work Milling &amp; Mfg. Co., 20 Me. 41 (1841). </page> <page sequence="12"> LEDERMANMACRO 1/10/01  4:26 PM 652 BUFFALO CRIMINAL LAW REVIEW [Vol.  4:641 clear model of adaptation.  Originally, this model was copied to the realm of penal law in order to expand the boundaries of criminal liability and to enable its imposition, under defined conditions, on a principal or an employer for the deeds of an agent or employee.26  Faithful to the notion of adaptation, the doctrine of vicarious liability is based on the attribution of the deed to the principal or the employer, in a two-stage process.  First there is an examination of whether the elements of the offense were established in the conduct of the agent or the employee.  Once these elements are identified in the perpetrator’s conduct, they are copied and ascribed to the principal or the employer as well, based on the legal relationship that exists between them.27  This relationship, in and of itself, is a legal and flawless relationship of agency or employment.28 The law implements the doctrine of vicarious liability through the auxiliary structure of a legal fiction that states, for the purpose of imposing liability, that whatever a person does through an agent, he is deemed to have done himself.  In other words, the law views the act of the agent or the employee as an act perpetrated by the principal or the employer, and the knowledge of the agent or the employee is the knowledge of the principal or the employer. The law does not claim that the principal or the employer actually acted or actually knew.  The law knows that reality is different and that these are two separate and independent entities, only one of which the agent or employer is actually involved in the actions or thoughts at 26. For the principles and scope of the criminal vicarious liability doctrine in English law and traditional American law, see Leonard H. Leigh, Strict and Vicarious Liability: A Study in Administrative Criminal Law (1982); Francis B. Sayre, Criminal Responsibility for the Acts of Another, 43 Harv. L. Rev. 689 (1930). 27. For the operation of the doctrine, see, e.g., Vane v. Yiannopoullos, A.C. 486 [1965] (Eng.); Coupe v. Guyett, 2 All E.R. 1058 (Q.B. 1973) (Eng.). 28. If this relationship had a criminal tone, assuming that the employer had convinced the employee to commit the forbidden act, or if the two individuals had agreed to do so, the issue would fall within the scope of doctrines of criminal accomplices or criminal conspiracy. </page> <page sequence="13"> LEDERMANMACRO 1/10/01  4:26 PM 2000] MODELS FOR CORPORATE LIABILITY 653 stake.  Yet, due to considerations of proper legal policy anchored in the association and the relationship of subordination between them, a fiction is devised, whereby the behavior and the thoughts of one individual, following the orders of another, appear as the behavior and the thoughts of that other.  This fiction engendered the rule whereby the acts of one also bind the other. The courts broadened the scope of the vicarious liability doctrine and copied the technique that had been developed for imposing liability on a human principal or human employer for the acts of an agent or employee, extending it to cases where the employer or the principal is a legal body.29  The logic behind this expansion is best conveyed by a decision handed down at the turn of the twentieth century by the American Supreme Court.  The Court held that it entails taking this doctrine “only one step further . . . in the interest of public policy,” in order to supervise the behavior of the agent “by imputing his act to his employer and imposing penalties upon the corporation for which he is acting.”30 The doctrine of vicarious liability is of significant importance.  Without it, it is questionable whether infringements in areas such as consumer protection31 or environmental law32 could have been enforced effectively. However, because of the limited scope of this doctrine at the criminal level, and its frequent limitation to offenses of 29. See, e.g., Tesco Stores Ltd. v.

The Doctrine of Direct Liability (The Theory of Corporate Organs) The restrictions that affect the scope of the vicarious liability doctrine within traditional criminal law led to the creation of the direct liability doctrine.  This doctrine, which was specifically developed for the purpose of imposing liability on corporations, seeks, in fact, to imitate the imposition of criminal liability on human beings.41  The direct doctrine relies on the notion of personification of the legal body.  It identifies actions and thought patterns of certain individuals within the corporation—called corporate organs—who act within the scope of their authority and on behalf of the corporate body, as the behavior of the legal body itself.  Hence, the name of the doctrine: the theory of corporate organs or the “alter ego” doctrine referring to these individuals as the embodiment of the legal body.  The identification lays out a base for imitation.  In its wake, a corporation can be rendered criminally liable for the very perpetration of the offense, resembling the liability imposed on a human perpetrator, subject to the natural limitations that follow from the 38. See e.g., United States v. 7326 Highway 45 North, 965 F.2d 311, 316 (7th Cir. 1992); United States v. Cincotta, 689 F.2d 238, 241-42 (1st Cir. 1982). 39. State v.

First, the performance of the individual is considered; the identification process is then performed separately, to explore whether it is proper, under the circumstances, to regard that specific human being as a corporate organ.  Unlike the notion of attribution underlying the vicarious liability doctrine, however, the notions of identification and personification in the direct theory cloud the basis of the legal fiction and formulate a legal definition that, according to the theory’s supporters, is closer to reality.  In the absence of natural internal capabilities for taking action, the corporation must act, directly or indirectly, through human representatives.  A decision is required to state that the behavior and thoughts of certain individuals may be identified as the actions and thoughts of the legal body itself.  It seems natural to restrict these representatives to a relatively small group of individuals or corporate bodies (e.g., the Board of Directors) that determine corporate policy.  It appears to be a more accurate reflection of reality to perceive certain individuals, because of their status, their authority, and their behavior, as the corporation itself.  From this perspective, the direct theory does not create a fictitious legal reality ex nihilo, as does the vicarious liability model when formulating the sweeping rule that a person’s agent is regarded as the person. In the criminal context, the personification of the legal body implies that, at the time of the criminal behavior and 42.

In the words of section 47 of the Israel Companies Law, 1999: “[t]he actions and intentions of an organ are actions and intentions of the company.”43  Hence, it is the corporate organ, as an individual as well as the legal body, who committed all the elements of an offense, simultaneously, directly, and immediately, when the forbidden act and the intent of the individual are identified and perceived as the actual performance of the legal body. The theory of corporate organs was developed and adopted mainly by English law44 and by legal systems under its sphere of influence.  This theory, however, has also been accepted in some American states,45 which have adopted the Model Penal Code attitude on this issue.46 Identification and personification are entrenched in the doctrine to such an extent that a House of Lords judge stressed that, in these circumstances, presenting the human corporate organ as the corporation’s alter ego was misleading because “the person who speaks and acts as the company is not alter.  He is identified with the company.”47 The main issue in the doctrine of direct liability deals with the criteria for agreeing on the corporate organs. Given the vast range of corporations and the large freedom they enjoy in shaping their modes of operation, it is impossible to set precise rules on this issue.  Granting discretion in line with the circumstances of the event is 43. Isr. Companies Law, 1999, § 47 (3d ed. 1999) (English translation) [Israeli Companies Law]. 44.

Laws and bills from various countries that suggest criteria for defining corporate organs show great similarities.  One of the basic constructs for these bills is section 2.07(4) of the Model Penal Code, stating that the corporation’s agent is a “senior managerial agent” identified with the legal body, when granted “duties of such responsibility that his conduct may fairly be assumed to represent the policy of the association.”48  Similarly, section 23(a)(2) of the Israel Penal Code states that, concerning offenses requiring proof of guilt, an officer may bind a legal body: [I]f, under the circumstances of the case and in the light of the person’s position, authority and responsibility of the person in the management of the affairs of the body corporate—the act by which he committed the offense, his criminal intent or his negligence are deemed to be the act, the criminal intent or the negligence of the body corporate.49 Bills that also stress hierarchical elements in the structure of the corporation are, to some extent, different.  Thus, for instance, the bill of the 1989 English Law Commission defines the controlling officer, whose behavior and intent, when he acted within his capacity and in the presence of the required mental state, bind the corporation, as a person participating in “the control of the corporation in the capacity of a director, manager, secretary or other similar officer.”50  The hierarchical indicators in the definitions do not abolish judicial discretion concerning the identity of the officers whose behavior and intent bind the corporation. Nevertheless, these indicators may, to some extent, direct and even limit discretion concerning the level and scope of the liability required from an officer, as the English bill 48.

In this context, members of the English Commission declared that they do not suggest any deviation from the basic approach of the English law on this question,51 which views as corporate organs those who are “the very ego and center of the personality of the corporation . . . the directing mind and will of the corporation.”52  The corporate organs theory points to the people who exercise authority and control the power within the legal body.  Namely, to those who direct the legal body and are responsible for its moves, those who set the corporation’s policy, and who, in line with the metaphor, should be regarded as “[its] brain and nerve centre.”53  The question of “who is a corporate organ” is obviously more complex when applied to those ranks of the hierarchy not at the head of the organization, and who, as a rule, do not determine day-to-day policy.  Obviously, the general meeting of the shareholders, the Board of Directors, and the CEO are corporate organs, since it is they who determine the policy of the body by virtue of the authority vested in them by law and the charter of the corporation. The role of those at the slightly lower levels depends on the factual context on the one hand, and reflects legal policy on the other. Despite the hesitations, the doubts, and the different emphases, it seems that the more appropriate criterion for determining the corporate organs is based on a twofold standard: hierarchical and functional.  Based on this approach, the first step is to consider the structure and the organization of the legal body, while inquiring as to the relative rank of the human agent in question and his powers within the corporate hierarchy (the hierarchical consideration).  The inquiry is comprehensive and does not rely solely on the title and description of the specific 51. Id. at para 10.6. 52. Lennard’s Carrying Co. Ltd. v. Asiatic Petroleum Co.

To meet its demands and to facilitate the identification of a human agent as the “brain” of the legal body, a claim must be made that the person in question is a member of the corporation’s top management. One must also show that by virtue of the management’s authority, the said person participates in the determination and shaping of corporate policy, and not merely in its actual implementation. Furthermore, one needs to examine the criminal behavior of the person per se, in order to establish whether it should be viewed, functionally and under the circumstances of the case, as use of force by the corporation itself (the functional consideration).  For instance, the signing, in the name of the corporation, of a contract that includes acts of deceit.  This additional test is meant to exclude from the context of the discussion acts by persons, regardless of their hierarchical rank, that are not related to the corporation; for example, the corporate CEO’s  attack on a neighbor in the building where he lives.  It is also meant to exclude acts performed by people within the framework of their work and for the corporation, which under the circumstances cannot be viewed as acts of the legal body itself.  For example, an accident caused by the CEO on his way to a corporate business meeting. The functional inquiry will sometimes identify as acts of the corporation “job related activities” that had been performed by people who had exceeded the scope of their authority54 and, at times, even activities that were performed contrary to the explicit instructions of those in charge.55  In this context, it has been argued that “confining the responsibility of a corporation to those acts performed by its organ within the realm of its authority deals a death 54.

Increasingly, however, the tendency is to argue that an action of an individual, within the corporate framework, which is meant to harm the legal body (for instance, embezzlement),57 does not meet the functional requirement.  Since it cannot be defined as the action of a corporate organ, it consequently cannot be identified as an act of the legal body.58 C.  THE AGGREGATION MODEL: THE IDEA OF COLLECTIVE KNOWLEDGE 1.  The Origin and Substance of the Model Over the past decade, influenced by theories of sociology and management,59 a third and new approach has emerged for imposing criminal liability on legal bodies: the aggregation model.  This new model reflects interesting processes of change and expansion that have affected the doctrine of vicarious liability.  These processes are linked to needs and issues that result from the decentralized and complex structures characteristic of large modern corporations.60  The vicarious liability theory seems to lead to further development because, inter alia, it rests largely 56.

The freedom to formulate a normative definition that can create a reality, unfettered and unencumbered by the need to reflect fully the existing reality and its rules, which is essentially typical of fictions, was a convenient point of departure for developing an additional notion of corporate liability.  The new idea of aggregation is thus derived from the fiction of attribution that underlies vicarious liability but, taking it several steps further, it is even more far-fetched from the perspective of the fiction. The additional development, which was the work of several federal courts in the United States, is known as collective knowledge or aggregate knowledge. Conceptually, this development should be properly viewed as an interim model between the models of imitation discussed above, and the self-identity model of the legal body analyzed in the next chapter.  As for scope, this model, in its broad comprehensive form, stands along side its predecessors and seeks to add to them.  It does not compete with them, nor does it offer an alternative to their approach.  Collective knowledge, in its all-encompassing meaning, deals with situations that previous models had left unattended.  It seeks to expand the liability of legal bodies to include additional events, beyond the scope of previous doctrines.  In this sense, collective knowledge relates to previous doctrines of liability as the theory of direct liability relates to the vicarious liability doctrine. The aggregation model allows for the conviction of legal bodies within the broad-scoped vicarious doctrine of respondeat superior, which is dominant in American law, by linking the thoughts of different agents of the legal body and thus creating the required mental element.  The body of knowledge in possession of each of the various agents is attributed to the corporation separately, relying on the known rules of the vicarious liability doctrine.  The separate units are then aggregated into one criminal whole that, by virtue of the fiction of attribution, is already controlled by the corporation.  Following the same line of thought, other elements of criminal liability can also be </page> <page sequence="23"> LEDERMANMACRO 1/10/01  4:26 PM 2000] MODELS FOR CORPORATE LIABILITY 663 joined together.  The behavior of one agent can be joined to the knowledge of another, to create a criminal offense. Similarly, nothing precludes aggregating the behavior of different agents into one offense of negligence, although, as yet, there are no clear judicial precedents for this. The two-staged structure, whereby elements of liability are located in the behavior of agents and then ascribed to the agency, which is characteristic of the vicarious and identification models, is also preserved in the aggregation model.  Yet, the culling and joining of various elements into one offense and, as a result, the imposition of criminal liability on the corporation, in a pattern unique to the aggregation model, may actually turn innocent activities of agents or employees into corporate acts or omissions of a criminal character.  This might be the case even when circumstances clearly show that none of the agents or employees acted with the criminal intent required by the offense being charged. A prominent instance of this approach is the case of United States v. Bank of New England.61  The bank was convicted of willfully infringing the Currency Transaction Reporting Act as it relates to the reporting of cash transactions.  The Act compels banks to report to the Treasury any cash transaction with a client that exceeds ten thousand dollars.62  In this case, the client repeatedly made cash withdrawals from the account of a legal body, the sum of which was higher than the amount that required to be reported.  Each time, he used several checks, each for a sum lower than the required total.  Each group of checks was presented to a different teller at different times.  When the question of the bank’s knowledge and intent to commit the offense was raised, in light of its obligation to report a transaction that follows from the aggregation of several checks, the judge in the lower court referred to the subject of collective knowledge and instructed the jury as follows: 61. 821 F.2d 844, 856 (1st Cir. 1987). 62.

As such, its knowledge is the sum of all the knowledge of all its employees.  That is, the bank’s knowledge is the totality of what all of the employees knew within the scope of their employment.  So, if employee A knows of one facet of the currency reporting requirement, B knows another facet of it, and C a third facet of it, the banks know them all.  So, if you find that an employee within the scope of his employment knew that the [reports] had to be filed, even if multiple checks are used, the bank is deemed to know it.  The bank is also deemed to know it if each of the several employees knew a part of the requirement and the sum of what the separate employees knew amounted to the knowledge that such a requirement existed.63 The bank’s appeal, which focused on the validity of collective knowledge,64 was rejected by the Court of Appeals that stressed: Corporations compartmentalize knowledge, subdividing the elements of specific duties and operations into smaller components.  The aggregate of those components constitutes the corporation’s knowledge of a particular operation.  It is irrelevant whether employees administrating one component of an operation know of the specific activities of employees administrating another aspect of the operation.65 The Court summed up the issue in categorical terms: “Since the bank had the compartmentalized structure common to all large corporations, the court’s collective knowledge instruction was not only proper but necessary.”66 The roots of the aggregation model are relatively old. The idiom “collective knowledge” was coined already in the early 1950’s.67  The development of such terms as “collective memory” in sociology may have inspired this development.

First, in the two instances that considered the case, the courts’ rulings were uniquely powerful and unequivocal.  Second, the ruling in this case concerned a felony with criminal intent,69 whereas some of the precedents on this topic deal with lighter criminal offenses, misdemeanors, which, despite the demand of criminal intent, were perceived as regulatory offenses. Legal literature has dealt with the model in question several times, usually in the general sense discussed above. The articles stressed the possibility of imposing criminal liability on corporations by means of the aggregation technique even in offenses involving clear subjective blame, whenever none of the corporation’s agents could be held fully responsible.  Scholars found support for their approach in the clear-cut rhetoric of the legal precedents, and particularly in that of the Bank of New England case.70 68. See, e.g., People v. American Med.

The Boundaries of the Aggregation Model (a) Collective Knowledge and Collective Criminal Intent Besides rulings that deal with aggregation in the generalized sense noted above, we also find cautious decisions, where the wording is more focused.  These decisions seek to limit, at least to some extent, the possibility of corporations creating collective criminal intent.  There is no evidence that these variations point to different, competing approaches.  They may only reflect semantic differences, when supporters of more cautious and limiting formulations seek more precise wordings. Advocates of the use of more meticulous and exact phrasings, however, could also be cautiously examining some of the more generalized statements in the Bank of New England affair that deal with the issue of criminal intent. The more cautiously worded decisions clarify, very persuasively, that the definition of corporate collective knowledge is not necessarily synonymous with the definition of collective criminal intent.  A federal court sharpened the distinction between these two concepts at an early stage in the development of the collective knowledge concept.71  In this case, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the decision of a lower court to convict a corporation for an offense of criminal intent, following the aggregation and the attribution to the legal body of Corporate Criminal Investigations, 19 Pub. Cont. L.J. 648, 657 (1990); Kathleen F. Brickey, Conspiracy, Group Danger and the Corporate Defendant, 52 U. Cin. L. Rev. 431, 448 (1983). 71.

The decision of the court of appeals shows that the circumstances of the case, and the instructions given to the jury, established only the element of knowledge required for creating the mental element, but this did not necessarily mean the formation of intent to commit the said offense.  In other words, proving knowledge does not point to the presence of the mental element required for conviction on this offense.  This suggests that convicting the corporation merely by relying on the collective knowledge of its employees actually lowers the level of the offense in question from an offense of intent to an offense that does not require proof of will.72 Similarly, other federal courts also recognized corporate collective knowledge, distinguishing it from collective intent or collective recklessness.  Attributing mens rea of intent or recklessness to a legal body depends, according to these courts, on the full development of this culpable state of mind in one of the corporation’s employees.  Thus, one of the courts dealing with a civil case held that: While it is not disputed that a corporation may be charged with the collective knowledge of its employees, it does not follow that the corporation may be deemed to have a culpable mental state of mind when that state of mind is possessed by no single employee.  A corporation can be held to have a particular state of mind only when that state of mind is possessed by a single individual.73 In dealing with the liability of legal bodies, many federal courts easily made the transition from the demand that all relevant elements of knowledge must be established in one single individual, to the recognition that 72.

Some courts, however, found it justifiably hard to take the additional and more far-reaching step that is required in a considerable number of criminal offenses.  Thus, in the absence of proof that the element of emotional blame was developed in the mind of one single employee of the corporation, they do not ascribe to the corporation, by virtue of such a collective creation, full criminal intent of either willfulness or recklessness. The difficulty stems from an inherent conceptual problem that differentiates between the two elements composing the mental element of the offense: the element of awareness or knowledge, on the one hand, and the emotional element, which is concerned with the mental attitude toward this body of knowledge, on the other.74  It is relatively simple and more obvious to understand the possibility of splitting off the rational element in the mens rea and, when necessary, mounting it onto the whole.  It is hard, however, to envisage the possibility of splitting off the emotional element in criminal intent.  The reason is that the rational element is concerned with cognition, namely, with knowledge and understanding of facts. Information can be accumulated or disseminated.  Hence, it seems possible to gather into one whole the body of information known to several individuals, and perhaps even add to it information “available” to a legal body—for instance—documents found in the corporation’s books, in its archives or in its computer network.  In contrast, the emotional element is perceived as unique to human beings. It expresses aspirations, indifference or hope, which by definition are perceived as one whole.  Hence, it is hard to understand the possibility of dismantling this element, or assembling it from parts taken from the consciousness of different individuals.  This element is either present in the defendant’s consciousness or it is not, and cannot be 74. See, e.g., Model Penal Code § 2.02 (Proposed Official Draft 1962) (structuring the mental elements of offenses). </page> <page sequence="29"> LEDERMANMACRO 1/10/01  4:26 PM 2000] MODELS FOR CORPORATE LIABILITY 669 divided or accumulated.  In the corporate context, it is questionable whether we may conclude that the aggregation of “partial” mental states of various people created the mental state required by such an offense. The distinction between the “aggregability” of the knowledge element and the “non-aggregability” of the emotional element is logical and worthwhile and should be the point of departure for advocates of the aggregation model.  It relies on a clear behavioral basis.  While details of knowledge can be aggregated, desires and preferences cannot, since they may be transient and contradictory. Thus, for instance, if one corporate officer knows something and his colleague knows something else, we may hold that the corporation knows both things together.  However, if one officer wants something and his colleague wants something else, and their wishes are incompatible, we cannot conclude that the legal body wants both these things simultaneously.  It is still interesting, however, that not all the decisions have explicitly emphasized this distinction.  In the Bank of New England case, the way to prove the presence of an emotional element in the requirement of willfulness is not totally clear. Having endorsed this constraint, the scope of the aggregation model in American law remains quite restricted.  When elements of mens rea are divided between two or more corporate agents, the model may be considered as a base for corporate liability solely in the following two case groups: when the offense requires only proof of the rational element—awareness—in order to form the mental element required; and, in mens rea offenses of intent or recklessness, when one agent of the legal body has also developed, in addition to a share of the knowledge, the emotional element of desire or indifference that is required to fulfill the mens rea.  Clearly, cases falling under the second rubric, though theoretically possible, are rare.  In any event, support for this cautious and precise formulation of the model can also be found in the model’s designation in American legal literature and American judicial tradition: collective knowledge or aggregate </page> <page sequence="30"> LEDERMANMACRO 1/10/01  4:26 PM 670 BUFFALO CRIMINAL LAW REVIEW [Vol.  4:641 knowledge rather than aggregate criminal intent (whether of willfulness or recklessness). (b) Indeed Willful Blindness? The picture is even more complex.  The boundaries of the aggregated model, even in the more cautious and limited version outlined and analyzed above, are not clear- cut.  Some scholars have tried to narrow the model’s scope even further, holding that the legal literature on this issue developed a structure that lacks solid foundations, since it relies on a mistaken interpretation of judicial decisions. According to this approach—which is based on an examination of the factual background in the cases where the courts resorted to the idea of collective knowledge—the judicial rulings were not intended to create a general model that would allow the imposition of criminal liability on corporations by aggregating pieces of innocent knowledge possessed by various agents into one whole of criminal character.  The courts had only wanted to create a mechanism for imposing liability in circumstances that point to the clear guilt of an agent or of the legal body’s working methods.  Hence, a condition for implementing the model, according to these scholars, is that the person who possesses one element of knowledge be responsible for having been prevented from acquiring another part of knowledge that, in aggregate, would have been perfected into the criminal intent required for developing criminal liability.75  In other words, they claim that we are dealing with a kind of willful blindness.76 This critical approach raises difficulties on two counts. The first is its conceptual purity.  The approach seems to use the concept of willful blindness inaccurately.  The 75. See Thomas A.

That means limiting the scope of the doctrine to cases where the accused suspected the presence of the fact at stake but refrained from inquiring into it because ‘he did not wish to know,’ lest the fact be confirmed and he would then be unable to deny that he knew about it.77  The facts in the cases at stake do not fit this description.  We may assume that, in some of them, elements in the organization were negligent and failed to examine or match information.  We may also add that, had they done so, the full picture would have become clear to them.  It cannot be argued, however, that the agents of this body wanted or intended not to know, so as not to confirm a misgiving or a suspicion concerning the presence of specific circumstances or of a particular event.  It is also highly questionable whether, in these cases, the corporation knowingly erected a control or monitoring system characterized by compartmentalization and designed to prevent the flow of information between the organization’s agents, thereby consciously contributing to the creation of suitable conditions for unintended delinquency.78 The second count is the court’s rhetoric in analyzing the issue of collective knowledge in the Bank of New England case, which is clear-cut: using the aggregation model is not contingent on proof of guilt on the part of the legal body or its agents.79  It would be simplistic to dismiss this on the grounds that these statements are incidental, unnecessary, and therefore not binding.80 77. See, e.g., United States v. Lara-Velasquez, 919 F.2d 946, 951 (5th Cir. 1990); United States v. Jewell, 532 F.2d 697, 700 (9th Cir. 1976).

Whether no conditions or limitations, besides those considered in the previous section, should be added to the aggregation model, or whether the model should be limited to cases of culpable behavior on the part of an agent who knowingly contributed, recklessly or negligently, to the non-forming of the necessary knowledge, is a question of suitable legal policy. 3.  The Aggregation Model: Questions and Doubts The attitude of American law toward the scope of the aggregation model is apparently still evolving.  The scope of the model has not been finally decided, although federal courts’ decisions seem to support the broader view.  Ideas resembling the aggregation model have recently emerged in Dutch law, which also shows a trend to acknowledge, under certain circumstances, the possibility of aggregating the corporation’s guilt from parts found among two or more individuals.81 Other legal systems are more cautious and, as yet, have not explicitly adopted the idea of aggregating the required elements of knowledge from the states of mind of various individuals when considering corporate liability.82 27. 81. See Field &amp; JCrg, supra note 9, at 160. 82. See, e.g., Israeli Law of Companies § 69 cmts. (current § 47, enacted in 1999) stating that: [O]n this issue, there is no need for the action or the thought to be wholly the work of one organ.  A splitting of action and thought is possible, so that one organ will act (but will not think), and another organ will think (but will not act).  In such a case, the company has both acted and thought, though not simultaneously. 1996 Bills S.I. 2, 30 (Hebrew), Companies Law, 1999 (English Translation). Even if the mention of simultaneousness makes it clear that the bill did not intend the law to cover offenses of criminal intent, it obviously does not consider the aggregation model invalid.  It adopts the model while shifting it from </page> <page sequence="33"> LEDERMANMACRO 1/10/01  4:26 PM 2000] MODELS FOR CORPORATE LIABILITY 673 On this issue, however, several remarks are worthy of attention, since the basis of the aggregation model is not free of questions and uncertainties. Firstly, we must take into account that group decisions, which are based on the views of the group’s components, are logically different from the decisions of individuals.  In these circumstances, aggregation per se is not always the result of simple arithmetic and may, at times, assume a different meaning. Secondly, an additional argument could be raised against the basis of the aggregation model itself, arguing that the whole idea of collective knowledge derives from over-criminalization of the corporation, and suggesting that the personification metaphor is now controlling its creators. Supporters of the aggregation model, as noted, are ready to consider the knowledge of different agents as part of one consciousness.  Hence, they relate to the entire knowledge as one whole that reflects the knowledge of the legal body. This logic is never questioned when a living organism is at the vicarious liability framework, where it was created in the United States, to the boundaries of the direct liability theory, and is willing to implement it in appropriate areas, even though their scope is not precisely defined. Furthermore, in recent decisions of the Israeli Supreme Court we may even find slight hints to the possibility of adopting the aggregation model in the criminal framework.  In one decision the Court emphasized that “[t]he personal liability of the corporation is separate from the liability of those acting in its name,” after stating that “the corporation may be liable (in a civil, criminal or other case), even if the organ himself is not.  The liability of the corporation for the activities of the organ . . . is not contingent on the liability of the organ.” Modiem v. State of Israel, 35(4) P.D. at 379, 384 (Per CJ Aaron Barak) (Isr.). The full implications of these remarks are not discussed in the decision, neither are they required for the ruling itself.  They might only be intended to enable liability to be imposed on legal bodies, even in special cases, when a specific circumstantial element, which is required in the definition of the offense, is found only in the corporation and not in the perpetrating organ itself.  Thus, for instance, when the law infringement is directed at the “employer,” the “owner,” or the “license holder,” and in the circumstances of the event, the condition, the feature or the capacity can only be found in the legal body.  However, if the emphasis on the lack of dependence between the liability of the organ and the liability of the legal body implies acknowledging the possibility of creating collective knowledge, as part of the organs theory, in order to enable the imposition of liability on a legal body, even when no organ has reached the required mens rea, this issue requires further discussion. </page> <page sequence="34"> LEDERMANMACRO 1/10/01  4:26 PM 674 BUFFALO CRIMINAL LAW REVIEW [Vol.  4:641 stake, whose brain activates all its limbs and controls its behavior.  When human beings are involved, a flaw in the brain’s ability to control behavior is usually a ground for protection from imposing criminal liability (lack of volition, mental illness, and sometimes drunkenness).  Assuming an analogy between the situation of a living organism and that of legal bodies by resorting to metaphors is thus problematic.  It could be argued that, if a corporation has various organs, the information it possesses is held by several independent foci, and its behavior is embodied in the independent behavior of these organs.  However, applying the idea of identification and anthropomorphism, and claiming that all the information possessed by the various corporate organs is collected and concentrated in the “company’s brain” entails, according to this approach, an artificial form of over-personification.83  The result is that criminal liability is imposed on the corporation for a clear offense of criminal intent when, in fact, no one has the knowledge required by the definition of this offense.  In practice, this is equivalent to renouncing the demand of criminal intent in the circumstances of the case, and turning the offense in question into one of strict or even absolute liability.84 Thirdly, one could further argue against the aggregate model of collective knowledge by claiming that aggregating elements of one offense from the thinking of various corporate agents or organs is detrimental to the principle of simultaneity required between actus reus and mens rea.85 The demand for a substantial link between thought and action cannot be met under the circumstances of aggregation, given the artificial structure created by such 83.

When a corporate agent or an organ is unaware of the knowledge possessed by another agent or organ, it is not possible to claim that this information is what nurtured and engendered the forbidden behavior, or that this act or omission resulted from this knowledge. These and other reasons may have been the reason for the opposition of the English Criminal Code bill to the usage of the aggregate model in rendering corporations criminally liable.86  This opposition came in the wake of a similar refusal, by an English Law Commission, to acknowledge the possibility “of piecing together several minds among the controlling officers of a company to render the company liable,” which was followed by a proposition to bind a corporation on the basis of the theory of the corporate organs only when it is proven that “at least one of its controlling officers has the whole mental elements required for the offense.”87  This approach was also backed by the decision of an English court several years ago, which refused to accept the idea of aggregation. It dismissed the prosecution’s claim that all elements of guilt need not appear in one single person identified with the corporation in order to render the legal body liable, and that it is possible to join parts of culpability found among several individuals and ascribe them jointly to the corporation.88 Nevertheless, it is worth stressing again that theoretical developments concerning the criminal liability of legal bodies reflect the needs of legal policy, as defined by those who set this policy.  Those who developed the aggregation model wish to continue to promote a policy they consider worthy, while expanding the scope of corporate liability.  They understand that the line of 86.

Terms such as “over-personification” are alien to their approach.  These terms draw from a conceptual framework appropriate only to a human scale and, a priori, are not appropriate for use in a corporate framework.  It is thus highly questionable whether a logical analysis, such as the one presented above, that points to the excesses of the aggregation model in terms of the criminal liability imposed on human beings, constitutes a suitable answer to the designers of this model and to those preparing the ground for its expansion up to the boundaries of direct liability. It still appears that, in theoretical terms, the weak link of the aggregation model is its attempt to hold the stick at both ends.  On the one hand, the model tries to remain loyal to the traditional conceptual framework of penal law and resorts to a known and defined term such as knowledge, which implies an understanding of all the objective elements of the offense.  On the other hand, however, the model grants this concept a totally different meaning from the one customarily accepted in the human context, seeking to incorporate the idea of collective knowledge. An inevitable consequence, in these circumstances, is conceptual blurring.  The doctrine that adopts the restricted view of the aggregation model seeks to contend with this difficulty.  By demanding that an emotional element be present in the agent who also possesses part of the knowledge, this approach brings the conceptual terminology of the aggregation model closer to the traditional concept of culpability.  However, even this demand cannot altogether preclude conceptual blurring, since the restricted approach also allows the application of the aggregation model, using it to envision a mental state that does not include all the elements of knowledge as if it were actual knowledge. These understandable problems of the aggregation model may have engendered various trends.  They have </page> <page sequence="37"> LEDERMANMACRO 1/10/01  4:26 PM 2000] MODELS FOR CORPORATE LIABILITY 677 nurtured a view that supports a limited scope of the aggregation model, in a manner that alters the character of aggregation.  This restricted approach holds that the use of this model should only be allowed in offenses of negligence, forbidding its use in offenses of mens rea.89  The combination of elements of physical behavior to establish, through aggregation, a deviation from normative behavior in the measure required by a concrete offense of negligence, differs in its pattern and structure from the aggregation of elements of knowledge for the purpose of creating the required mental element.  Nevertheless, it is an interesting idea that should not be dismissed outright.  At the same time, it appears that these obvious difficulties have hastened the development of the idea that criminal liability of legal bodies should be examined from another perspective, relying on a conceptual framework different from the one used for dealing with human liability.90  This idea is developed most distinctly in the model of separate self-identity discussed below. D.  THE MODEL OF SEPARATE SELF-IDENTITY: BEGINNINGS American legal literature has recently offered proposals for a new, fourth model for considering the criminal liability of legal bodies.  These proposals do not necessarily submit a full, comprehensive, and detailed structure of the model.  This was not their intention and, therefore, these proposals should not be examined for 89. See Sir John Smith, Smith &amp; Hogan Criminal Law 185-86 (9th ed. 1999) (recognizing the value of the aggregation model in offenses of negligence, finding authority for the approach in the law of tort); see also Criminal Code Act, 1995 § 12.4(2) (Austl.)

The scholars that developed them ask to present an idea and a line of thought for discussion and analysis that, in their view, reflect the reality of the modern corporation.  For this purpose, they concentrate on tracing only the outline of a model rather than on the presentation of a full and all-inclusive scheme. The assumption that serves as the basis and common denominator for all the variations of this model is that legal bodies have a mechanism for expressing their substance and self-identity.  Based on this approach, a self- identity can be located and established, which is different and separate from the identity of the general meeting of the shareholders, the board, the management, the employees, or any other body or individual making up the corporation, even if they all play a role and contribute significantly to the development and shaping of that identity. 1.  The Model of Self-Identity and Previous Models In its structural approach, the doctrine of self-identity resembles the theory of corporate organs.  Its supporters claim that its underlying definition, used as the basis for establishing the corporation’s separate identity, relies on and reflects reality, just as supporters of the theory of corporate organs hold that the idea of identification reflects reality.91  Yet, these two models differ in the consequences of their examination of the reality.  Supporters of the identification model hold that reality shows that, in the absence of built-in capabilities of its own, the legal body acts through defined human representatives.  In contrast, the developers of the self-identity model hold that reality is more complicated and denotes that legal bodies act through intricate and varied systems, activated by human agencies and other processes. The relationship between the self-identity model and the other models is extremely complex.  One perspective 91. See infra notes 42-43 and accompanying text. </page> <page sequence="39"> LEDERMANMACRO 1/10/01  4:26 PM 2000] MODELS FOR CORPORATE LIABILITY 679 emphasizes the links between them, by turning our attention to the identity model as a continuation of previous models, and particularly as a far-reaching development of the aggregation idea.  From this perspective, all models for imposing criminal liability on legal bodies can be presented as variations moving along one single theoretical line of development.  The line begins with the ideas of adaptation and imitation, continues through the aggregation approach, and culminates in the self-identity model.  This progression hinges on the notion of a corporate personality.  It begins with an approach that denies any selfhood to the corporate personality and that stresses its total dependence on a specific, defined human agency.  It then continues through the idea of various factors, possibly linked into one unit, enfolding the cognitive aspect of the legal body’s personality, and finally to the construction of a special synthesis of human factors and organizational-structural mechanisms, which is specific to legal bodies and whose combination constitutes the corporate personality. In contrast, other perspectives emphasize the differences in basic perception and structure between that of the self-identity model and the others.  Thus, for instance, it is worth stressing that the new model focuses mainly on the primary liability of the corporation itself.  It thereby differs from the adaptation model of vicarious liability, with its fiction of attribution, or from the imitation and identification model of direct liability, where corporate liability is distinctly derivative, since it depends on the perpetration of an offense by a corporate agent or an organ.92  Supporters of the self-identity model also claim that the clearly derivative character of the previous models imprints them with a measure of artificiality, which does not contribute to the development of a comprehensive approach toward the essence of the modern corporation.93 92.

Speaking of corporate conduct or corporate fault is seen as a shorthand way of referring to the conduct and culpability of the individual members of the collectivity. The “corporation” is simply a name for the collectivity and the idea that the corporation itself can act and be blameworthy is a fiction.94 “Realist” theories, on the other hand, assert that corporations have an existence that is, to some extent, independent of their members.  Corporations can act and be at fault in ways that are different from the ways in which their members can act and be at fault . . . the responsibility of the corporation is primary.  It is not dependent on the responsibility of any individual.  Responsibility is analyzed within a realist framework by examining directly questions about what the corporation did or did not do, as an organization; what it knew or ought to have known about its conduct; and what it did or ought to have done to prevent harm from being caused.95 This disparity between the model of self-identity on the one hand, and the models of adaptation and identification on the other, could also be presented differently.  Both vicarious and direct liability share the same point of departure, namely, the existence of a human perpetrator, even though it may be difficult, in certain development of corporate theory). 94. Eric Colvin finds an explicit expression of this approach in the saying “[c]orporations don’t commit crimes; people do.” Colvin, supra note 92, at 5.  John C.

The question is whether, in the circumstances of the case, the behavior of that individual can either be attributed to, or identified as, the behavior of the legal body, even though the establishment of individual liability is not a pre- condition for imposing liability on the corporation.  The situation is different in the self-identity model, where the liability of the legal body is considered independently. Obviously, an offense must be perpetrated here as well, and in most cases it is the work of a human perpetrator. The inquiry into the question of liability, however, begins directly at the corporation, analyzing the link between the performance of corporate systems and the propriety of its processes on the one hand, and the commission of the offense in question on the other. In light of the analysis so far it is clear that, contrary to the models of adaptation and identification, when the self-identity model examines the liability of the legal body, the two-stage structure discussed earlier is blurred, at least to some extent.97  In this model the liability of the legal body is determined in the course of a direct examination of its functional mechanism, without it being contingent on the commission of the offense by a specific human agent. Naturally, there is no objection that, in the course of this inquiry, findings may still emerge to serve as a basis for considering the separate personal liability of specific individuals belonging to the corporation’s staff. The model of self-identity also offers an alternative to the other models with regard to its scope of application.  It can be implemented over the whole cumulative scope of the models of adaptation, identification and aggregation and, in this sense, it can serve to replace them.  From this perspective, the relationship that exists between the self- identity model and the previous models is totally unlike the 96.  See supra note 82. 97.

Each one of the three previous models was created to expand the scope of the previous one, when it had proven unsuitable for application in a defined set of offenses or in a particular set of situations.  None of them, however, was designed or built to replace its predecessor and act within the boundaries of its scope.  Thus, the theory of corporate organs was meant to contend with the limitations of the vicarious liability doctrine in offenses of criminal intent but not with absolute or strict liability offenses.98  The same is true of the aggregation model, which established the idea of collective knowledge.  This model was created to offer solutions to situations where no liability could be imposed on corporations by relying on the theory of corporate organs, because none of the agents had the full knowledge required for establishing mens rea. To use a metaphor, it could be argued that the model of self-identity completes the circle of theoretical development.  This circle carries us back to the basic initial principles of corporate theory, which stress the independent existence of the entity created by the law as separate from the corporation’s founders and operators.99 The models of adaptation and identification have largely blurred this principle.  The idea of adaptation, and even more so the idea of identification, obscure the distinctions between the personality of the employees, or the personality of the managers-organs, and the personality of the corporation.  In fact, for the purposes of imposing criminal liability, these models do, in a way, lift the veil of the corporate entity on the grounds of suitable legal policy, in order to discover the individual whose behavior can be attributed to, or identified with that of the corporation. Developing a model of self-identity leads to the corporate veil being dropped once again, stressing the separate 98. It seems that for this reason the development of the respondeat superior theory—which also allows the imposition of criminal vicarious liability in mens rea offenses—stopped and prevented the full growth of the direct liability theory in the United States.

This point of view indicates that the gap between the approach of civil law to legal bodies, which has long stressed that corporate entity is separate and different from that of its owners, and the traditional approach of criminal law, which links and even identifies the corporation with the human beings acting within it, is beginning to close. 2.  Developing the Self-Identity Model: Background The roots of the self-identity model of legal bodies can be found in three important social trends that have evolved in the last few decades and bear legal-economic implications.  These trends have exerted a decisive influence on the developers of the self-identity model, some of whom came from the fields of management and the social sciences. The first trend deals with the complexity of the corporate phenomenon.  The large typical corporation changed its characteristics and substance in the course of the twentieth century.  It is no longer a legal set-up with a clear, pyramid-like hierarchical structure of authority and power that culminates in a sharp, single focus.  In such corporations, for instance, the management is not necessarily a set framework with a clear hierarchy headed by a single manager who controls the entire organization. Many legal bodies are presently characterized by multiple power centers that exert influence and share in controlling the organization and setting its policy.  These centers are a product of the separation between owners, management, and workers that is now typical of many corporations.100 Naturally, each of these groups has interests, rights, and obligations that are not necessarily or always compatible. Within each one of these groups there are often various centers of power that pull in different directions.  At times, 100. The ownership in these legal bodies is often divided among a huge number of shareholders, each of which has no real control of the corporation’s policy. </page> <page sequence="44"> LEDERMANMACRO 1/10/01  4:26 PM 684 BUFFALO CRIMINAL LAW REVIEW [Vol.  4:641 the boundaries between these groups are hazy, and employees are also either owners or managers, and sometimes both.  It has also been argued that customers, suppliers, and creditors should be added as groups with an interest in the total equation.  In addition, the organization itself may sometimes adopt goals that are not only economical but also social in nature.101  In any event, this variegated system creates a new and complex reality, where the decisions and actions of the corporation are consequences and reflections of a balance of forces, interests, rights, and obligations that act upon and activate the corporate framework.102 This change, which was accompanied by the escalating economic growth of large legal bodies,103 established the sense of the corporation as an independent entity with a character of its own: “The idea of a group of individual members has given way to that of a permanent, self- perpetuating bureaucratic machine in which members are only secondary and can no longer be realistically identified with the organization.”104 The second trend that seems to have influenced the development of the self-identity doctrine is the rising dominance of collective theories together with, and as a continuation of, theories bearing the banner of individual rights.  These theories seek to identify units larger than the single individual as bearers of rights and obligations. New social and legal movements, which rose up mainly in the United States, led by CLS (Critical Legal Studies), feminism, minority movements, communitarianism, and 101. See generally Brent Fisse, Retribution, Fault, and Sanctions, 56 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1141, 1154-58 (1983). 102. See Meir Dan–Cohen, Rights, Persons and Organizations 19 (1986).  From a certain perspective, an analogy can be drawn between the compression of the legal body as a figure with a self-identity, capable of forming a separate mens rea from that of its managers and agents, and the examination of the legislative body, when enacting a law, as having a separate self-identity with a purpose and will that are different from those of its separate members.

In this context, some have detected an analogy between the self-identity of corporations and the responsibility of communities and cities that was prevalent in ancient Greece.106  The trend stressing the rights and obligations of the collective also strengthens the possibility of viewing a group or a community, under certain conditions, as victims of a harmful activity.  This would be the case when the harm inflicted on the single individual is small but becomes significant when considering its weight and implications at the level of the group that ties the single individuals together. The third trend is the growth of interdisciplinary research.  This trend widened the horizons of scholarship, while stressing contexts, feedback, and balances between various branches of science.  In the present context, the consideration and use of insights and tools from extra-legal disciplines for the purpose of legal analysis were expanded. At the same time, we also witness an increase in the use of legal instruments and legal structures for research purposes in other disciplines.  The intensification of mutual recognition has enriched all the branches involved, creating additional perspectives of analysis and understanding and new syntheses.107  New trends of research have thus 105.

The model of self-identity has been influenced, to a large extent, by all three trends.  Theories dealing with organization and community were first developed in the fields of sociology, economics, psychology, and management sciences.  Scholars in these disciplines sought to locate and understand the features and the modes of action and behavior within the community and the organization, and to understand the forces and the elements that affect them.108  Increasingly, the legal field has also resorted to this knowledge to analyze the essence and the character of the liability of legal bodies. 3. The Model of Self-Identity: Assumptions and Characteristics The chief assumption underlying the self-identity model of corporations is that a large organization is not only a collection of people who shape it and activate it, but also a set of attitudes and positions, which influence, constrain, and at times even define the modes of thinking and behavior of the people who populate it: “Organizations are systems . . . not just aggregations of individuals.  More crucially . . . organizations consist of a set of expectations about how different kinds of problems should be resolved.”109 This assumption identifies the organization as a highly dominant element in the discussion.  At the same time, it sociology, and political science see, e.g., Karen Griggs, A Legal Discourse Community: Text Centered and Interdisciplinary in Social and Political Context, 40 J. of Bus. &amp; Technical Comm. 251 (1996). 108.

This approach is more fully validated in the larger, older, and more stable corporations, characterized by the parameters and the complex structure noted above.110  On these grounds, some advocates of the self-identity model have stressed that identity is mainly evident in such bodies.111 The existence of many individuals in a large body contributes to the anonymity of corporate decisions on the one hand, while widening the gap between the interest of the individual and the interest of the organization on the other.  The structural complexity typical of legal bodies of this type also contributes to this separation.  The large number of units making up the organization and maintaining ongoing mutual contact thwarts attempts to trace the course of organizational decisions and their perception as derived from the actions and will of individuals.112  Some also hold that a process within the corporation, whereby the wills of individuals are blurred and an organizational identity emerges as a function of group dynamics, begins close to the creation of the corporation, when the original incorporators begin their activity: Usually, of course, the original incorporators will have organized to further their individual interests, and/or to meet goals which they shared.  But even in infancy the melding of disparate interests and purposes gives rise to a corporate long-range point of view that is distinct from the intents and the purposes of the incorporators viewed individually.113 According to this approach, the turnover of employees and managers at almost all levels, which usually evolves at 110.

These changes do not threaten organizational stability in such a corporation, because its recruitment and training procedures are effective and well regulated.114 New workers quickly learn what is expected from them. Since they wish to continue to belong to the organization, on which they are often economically dependent, they adapt to the framework’s prevailing working procedures, formal rules, and informal understandings.115 In other words, if the legal body, including its tradition and organizational culture, is the fixed and stable element, while people are the changing, dependent, and replaceable element, personnel changes will seldom lead to real changes in the organization’s behavior and work processes. The obvious conclusion is that people in various positions often undergo a socialization process, in the course of which it is they who adapt themselves to the commitments, the expectations, and the goals inherent in the positions they hold.  Placing constraints on the behavior and even on the modes of thinking of the people in these positions concerning the modes of fulfilling these roles is the result of this description, which is also largely valid for the managerial elite in these bodies.116  A sociologist described the process whereby people adapt to their roles as similar to the mode in which workers wear the clothes or the uniform required by their job.117 Unquestionably, this description does not fit all corporations.  Open and flexible working environments characterize many organizations.  These organizations welcome and encourage initiative and creativity, not only 114.

Many other organizations, however, preserve fixed constructs, or are characterized by an atmosphere that encourages adaptation to prevalent patterns.  This atmosphere is not necessarily the result of specific efforts or initiatives.  Often, it follows from the very existence of organizational patterns, which naturally tend toward self-preservation.  The existence of many corporations of this kind, characterized by a rigid organizational culture and procedures, and by inflexible, stable patterns of work and management, confirms the sense of the corporation itself as a true, independent player in the system, with powers and identity of its own.  We should therefore relate to it as such. The independent identity of the legal body has been compared in legal literature to a living cell, possessing an identity that is separate from the molecules that form it.118 Similarly, the corporation is presented as a separate entity that represents more than the sigma of its human components.  This idea is described by Quaid as follows: “In essence, the organization must be a conglomerate-type collectivity: that is, a collectivity which possesses an identity which exceeds that of the sum of its individual members.”119 Nevertheless, no consensus exists among supporters of the self-identity model concerning the essence and structure of the model.  There are gaps in their readiness to ascribe to the legal body an identity of its own, and particularly an ability to develop alternative thinking. There is also no consensus as to what method should be used to establish the identity of the legal entity or on how to examine it.  In this context, the variations of the model grant different weight and emphasis to such features as structure and hierarchy, size and complexity, policy and action, and particularly modes of management, decision making and monitoring processes in the corporation in 118.

Self Identity and Criminal Culpability (a) The Underlying Assumptions of the Model Advocates of the self-identity model add two mutually linked assumptions to the basic foundation, which postulates the existence of a mechanism that endows large organizations with a self-identity that possesses unique characteristics of its own.  These assumptions stress the close links between the perception of identity and the concepts of liability and culpability. The first assumption is that the self-identity of a corporation influences its observance of the law, both positively and negatively.  A corporation expresses its identity by establishing and implementing mechanisms of control and monitoring, as well as by creating a general ethos and work climate.  By means of these devices it can increase the level of compliance within the organization or, alternatively, encourage a tendency toward negligent behavior and even toward deliberate delinquency. The second assumption is that one can diagnose the corporation’s self-identity and predict its behavior, and that its general characteristics are dynamic and can be shaped and even modified.  Accordingly, self-identity can be linked to the concept of self-control and then to the idea of legal liability.  As in any other context of liability, there is no 120. There is ample similarity between these characteristics and the characteristics that, according to Dan-Cohen, are typical of a corporation and distinguish it from a human being.  See Dan-Cohen, supra note 102, at 31-38. These characteristics are: (1) structure; (2) permanence—corporations persist for decades; (3) decision making—the accumulation, use and dissemination of information; (4) size—the scale of a corporation’s operation; (5) formality—the responsibilities and expectations within the legal bodies; (6) complexity—the independence of sub-units within the structure; and (7) functionality and goal orientation—the way in which goals and objectives influence the way the legal bodies function.

Laufer, Corporate Bodies and Guilty Minds, 43 Emory L.J. 647, 649 n.9 (1994); Quaid, supra note 104, at 79-81. </page> <page sequence="51"> LEDERMANMACRO 1/10/01  4:26 PM 2000] MODELS FOR CORPORATE LIABILITY 691 logic in supporting the imposition of liability on a corporation if we do not assume that it can choose between alternative forms of behavior, namely, that it can change. The assumption concerning corporate self-identity and its tendency to preserve its continuity and stability, as discussed above, neither contradicts nor detracts from the accompanying assumption concerning the legal body’s ability to shape it or even change it.  Nevertheless, it is clear that the possibility of changing an identity is contingent on a deliberate effort.  Obviously, if the change being sought concerns inherent characteristics that entail crucial implications for the functioning of the legal body, the effort and the influence involved in directing the change will have to be led by the higher echelons of management, which have greater power and influence on the corporate hierarchy. The two assumptions together strengthen the link between the idea of self-identity and the concepts of liability and culpability.  In fact, a main usage of the self- identity model at the legal level is in the context of imposing criminal liability on corporations.  The characteristics and features that make up the corporation’s identity, or at least its quasi-identity, are also those that, according to the advocates of the self-identity model, enable us to define it as an offender, without having to personify it through the model of identification, or to point to the existence of a separate blame attached to its agent or organ.121  The discussion about the self-identity of the legal body thus becomes a legal discussion, intricately involved in the question of its criminal liability.  Moreover, those who formed the features of the self-identity model thereby deal with the question of when it is appropriate to determine that the corporation is criminally liable for a certain offense. 121. See, e.g., Fisse &amp; Braithwaite, supra note 22, at 25 (“Although it is often said that corporations cannot possess an intention, this is true only in the obvious sense that a corporate entity lacks the capacity to entertain a cerebral mental state.  Corporations exhibit their own special kind of intentionally, namely corporate policy.”). </page> <page sequence="52"> LEDERMANMACRO 1/10/01  4:26 PM 692 BUFFALO CRIMINAL LAW REVIEW [Vol.  4:641 The variations of the identity model attempt to construct the separate and independent character of legal bodies by using, configuring, and perfecting its parameters. The more meticulous variations, which ascribe characteristics to the legal body itself, offer a perceptual and conceptual solution that defines the required mental element differently, so that corporations can be found criminally culpable.  “Corporate criminal intent” becomes a different concept in their hands, even though conceptually and functionally it is parallel to the criminal intent known to us from human beings.  Nevertheless, proving the existence of this “corporate criminal intent” remains perceptually close, in most cases, to the conventional approach for proving mens rea in human subjects, and is also based on the examination and analysis of circumstantial evidence. There are those who emphasize that corporations lack sensations and feelings in the known human physical sense.  This deficiency accentuates the difference in the structure of mens rea in legal bodies, which finds an alternative for the conscious-logical element but renounces the known emotional element in the human criminal state of mind.  From a certain perspective, this approach strengthens the link between the perception of self-identity and the question of criminal liability.  Both concepts are based on the idea of a conscious choice between behavioral alternatives, and in the context of corporate liability, this choice is presented as a purely rational act (logical element): “Granted, corporations lack human feeling and emotions, but this hardly disqualifies them from possessing the quality of autonomy.  On the contrary, the lack of emotions and feelings promote rather than hinder considered rational choice and in this respect the corporation may indeed be a paradigm responsible actor.”122 As already noted, legal literature has yet to develop an agreed upon, orderly, and comprehensive model of self- identity.  It is also hard to trace the model’s development in 122. Id. at 30-31. </page> <page sequence="53"> LEDERMANMACRO 1/10/01  4:26 PM 2000] MODELS FOR CORPORATE LIABILITY 693 line with the scholars who support it.  Generally, the variations of the model differ in the complexity of the alternative or cumulative parameters which they propose to examine in order to determine the corporation’s identity and, as a result, to decide on the question of its liability. For example, one can specifically point to variations in the approach regarding the scope of the working environment that should be considered following the perpetration of an offense.  Another variable parameter mentioned in the literature is the time element.  Some propose, for the purpose of determining the identity and the ensuing liability, to examine the behavior of the corporation at the time prior to the perpetration of the offense (preventive model).  Others focus on the period that follows soon after the perpetration (reactive model).123  All the proposals together, however, are meant to disclose whether, in the circumstances of the case, there are symptomatic behavioral constructs that led to the transgression. A precise analysis of this model’s different variations and their components is beyond the scope of this work. Therefore, I will confine myself to a brief presentation of the main points that are typical of the mainstream approach to the model. (b) The Mainstream Approach of the Model: An Outline The mainstream course proposed by the self-identity model developed the idea of corporate ethos, corporate character, corporate policy, and corporate ethics,124 all of which are a mere series of concepts, sharing a common ideological nucleus and directed toward one basic 123.

Advocates of this approach claim that the corporate ethos or character can be derived from several characteristics.  These include, inter alia, an analysis of the organization’s structure, and an examination of the Board’s function as well as the effectiveness of the body’s monitoring systems.  The emphasis is on the examination of the corporation’s aims and policies, and on an analysis of the training and supervisory methods adopted to ensure discipline among its employees, and compliance with the ethical code, regulations, and laws.126  The corporation’s methods of employee remuneration and incentives to promote proper and legal behavior are also considered,127 as are the ways in which the corporation pursues the investigation of the offense committed and its reaction to previous criminal violations.128 The corporate ethos or corporate character is thus determined by the dynamics of several elements, formal and informal, integrated into the corporation’s activities and designed to promote its aims.  It is unnecessary to single out a specific individual or a particular 125. See Bucy, supra note 118, at 1121 n.98 (clarifing that she prefers to use the term ethos because terms like corporate character or corporate culture are too wrapped up in the psychological anthropological context). 126. See id. at 1124-25 (concentrating on the components of the corporate culture and suggesting examination in this context of, inter alia, the business environment of the legal body and its procedures and traditions); see also Ermann &amp; Lundman, supra note 115, at 7; Frank Seales, Jr. &amp; Margaret P. Spencer, Corporate Codes of Conduct, in Corporate Misconduct: The Legal, Societal, and Management Issues (Margaret P. Spencer &amp; Ronald R. Sims eds., 1995). 127. Another expression used in this context is organizational ethics, namely the development of ethical codes in corporations in order to adjust their modes of operations to the law requirements.

The emphasis shifts to a broader examination of the whole complex and its connections, including the background of the events.  The corporation is rendered liable only if the conclusion is that it encouraged, through its activity and its policy, either explicitly or implicitly, non-compliance with the law, so that the criminal act or omission cannot be viewed as an employee’s incidental or unexpected behavior.129  In other words, the ethos or character approach holds that liability is imposed on a corporation when, in addition to an offense perpetrated by individuals belonging to the organization or its agents, we also find organizational support, be it explicit or implicit.  Indeed, it is not always clear when such support is granted.  However, despite the doubts, supporters of the model tend to assume that these situations include at least the following categories of events: (1) The performance of illegal acts by employees or agents of the corporation, when it is plausible to expect that the policy or procedures of the corporation might lead to the perpetration of such offenses. (2) The actual performance of an illegal act by the corporation’s high managerial agents, or when the said level of management instructed, encouraged, or supported the perpetration of such acts. (3) The corporation’s ratification or explicit support ex post facto of illegal acts committed by its employees or agents.130 Each of these categories may include situations in which the performance of the illegal act is a result of the collective behavior of a group of individuals.  This kind of situation heightens the possibility of imposing liability on the legal body, in line with the aggregation model, where liability cannot be ascribed to any specific person acting within the 129. See id. at 1099. 130. See, e.g., Moore, supra note 42, at 768-770; Laufer, supra note 120, at 673- 74; Foerschler, supra note 73 at 1306-09. </page> <page sequence="56"> LEDERMANMACRO 1/10/01  4:26 PM 696 BUFFALO CRIMINAL LAW REVIEW [Vol.  4:641 corporation’s framework.131 It is worthwhile to note that the second group of cases seems to equate the activity of management with that of the legal body, as does the identification model in the theory of organs.132  This similarity emphasizes certain overlaps between the model of self-identity and the other models, which follow from the character of the identity- model, the scope of which is equal to the cumulative scope of all three previous models.133  A change in the circumstances may also suggest situations to which the model of self-identity would be applied, but that would also fit the vicarious liability theory in the adaptation model.  In contrast, it is questionable whether other models cover all the situations within the scope of the mentioned groups of cases. It would, thus, appear, for instance, that the deliberate performance of an illegal act by an employee or agent of the corporation, in circumstances when it might plausibly be expected that accepted work procedures might lead to the perpetration of such an offense (the first group of cases), does not necessarily indicate a deliberate perpetration of an offense by the corporation according to either the direct liability or the vicarious liability models in their usual articulation in English law.  Yet, even if the scope of the self-identity model is found to be broader than the cumulative scope of the three other models only in a relatively small number of cases, this model is still very important because of its very pursuit of a theoretical approach that is different from that of its predecessors. In this context, though not necessarily in direct relationship to standards of ethos or character, the proposal was to consider the means adopted by a corporation in order to avoid a law infringement of the type 131.

In the appropriate cases, when the precautionary measures taken appear to have been suitable and plausible, it was even suggested that the very adoption of such measures be considered a defense against the imposition of criminal liability for that breach.134  This suggestion also coincides with the idea of the ethos, since the very adoption of plausible precautionary measures points to a corporate policy involving efforts to comply with the instructions of the law.135 (c) The Model of Self-Identity and Legal Practice The theory of self-identity appears mostly in legal literature, but hints of the idea can also be found in legislation and judicial precedents.  Thus, in the Bank of New England affair discussed above,136 the court ruled that there are two ways to determine the presence of criminal intent required for the creation of the offense.137  One is the traditional way of examining the employees’ behavior and finding intention in one of them.  The second, and more innovative, focuses on an examination of the bank as an organization, and on its failure to prevent the perpetration 134.

And you will have to determine whether the bank as an organization consciously avoided learning about and observing CTR requirements.  The Government, to prove the bank guilty on this theory, has to show that its failure to file was the result of some flagrant organizational indifference.  In this connection, you should look at the evidence as to the bank’s effort, if any, to inform its employees of the law; its effort to check on their compliance; its response to various bits of information that it got . . . ; its policies, and how it carried out its stated policies.138 The approach of the judge, as well as the language and terminology he used, constitute a considerable move toward the model of self-identity.  As noted, this model also focuses on the corporation’s policy, its mode of operation, and its instructions to its employees, pointing them out as features showing the culpability of the legal body, namely, its inherent and independent criminal intent. The Australian Criminal Code, enacted in 1995, also shows a distinctive resemblance to the self-identity model.139  The law conditions the imposition of criminal liability on a corporation for offenses of criminal intent on proof that it had ordered or allowed the perpetration of the offense.  Furthermore, it states that this requirement must be met even if it is impossible to show culpability in any of the corporation’s agents, as long as “the corporate culture [that] existed within the body corporate . . . directed, encouraged, tolerated or led to non-compliance with the relevant provision.”140  It must also be met if it is demonstrated that “the body corporate failed to create and maintain a corporate culture that required compliance with 138.

It continues to recognize the ideas of adaptation, imitation and aggregation, found in the models of vicarious liability, direct liability, and aggregation,143 but goes a step further.  By using the concept of “corporate culture” and relating to the high managerial agents as its representatives, the Act amplifies the ideas of implied authorization and reliance on that culture as a basis for convicting the corporate body.  Thus, criminal liability will be imposed on a corporation, in a case where an agent or employee is involved in the performance of illegal behavior, if “authority to commit an offense of the same or a similar character had been given by a high managerial agent of the body corporate.”144  It will also be imposed if “the employee, agent or officer of the body corporate who committed the offense believed on reasonable grounds, or entertained a reasonable expectation, that a high managerial agent of the body corporate would have authorized or permitted the commission of the offense.”145 According to Australian legislation, toleration of past behavior, or even a plausible assumption by the lower ranks in the organization as to the spirit, the policy, and the character of the corporation—namely, its ethos— accompanied by criminal acts or omissions on the part of this employee or agent, may render the body liable for serious offenses of intent or recklessness.  Furthermore, the new law does not confine itself to these situations.  It views them as contexts relevant to the concept of “corporate 141. Id. § 12.3(2)(d). 142. Id. § 12.3(6). 143.

The Australian model also offers explicit definitions of intention, knowledge, recklessness, and negligence.  The act emphasizes evidential constructions that will meet the demand of corporate intent, but does not formulate a solid theory that provides clear standards that might enable a court to analyze the mental state of corporations conceptually.  In other words, it identifies cases where the situation meets the demand of corporate criminal intent without outlining a clear theoretical model of the mental state itself. 5. The Model of Self-Identity: Parameters for a Future Discussion The model of self-identity is still in its infancy in the realm of criminal law.  At this stage, as noted, it is more of an idea and general outline than a fully comprehensive approach.  Considerable effort is still be required from academics and practitioners before attaining a general and detailed structure.  Certain aspects link the self-identity model to previous models, tending to present it as part of a single array of approaches spread along one theoretical line of development.  In contrast, other perspectives emphasize the distinction between this model and others, concerning both its basic perception and its structure.147 The model of self-identity appears to enjoy two practical advantages.  First, a direct requirement, dictating to the organization how to behave within a given set of parameters while pointing to the organization’s role in preventing offenses and its commitment to this endeavor, is 146. Id. § 12.3(4). 147. See also supra Section D(1). </page> <page sequence="61"> LEDERMANMACRO 1/10/01  4:26 PM 2000] MODELS FOR CORPORATE LIABILITY 701 highly significant in and of itself.  It is plausible to assume that the application of standards, which relate directly and immediately to the way a corporation functions, will encourage its board to invest more efforts in educating their employees and agents toward careful compliance with the law.  The board’s natural sense of responsibility for, and identification with, the bodies they direct and to which they are responsible will contribute to this. Another practical advantage of the self-identity model is that it reduces the enforcement problems faced by authorities that use the older models when they attempt to contend with criminal intent offenses in large modern corporations.  These corporations, which are characterized by a complex structure, a tendency to grant autonomy to sub-units, and a decentralized process of decision-making, compel the police and the prosecution to invest vast resources in attempting to locate a specific perpetrator whose behavior and intent can be identified with those of the legal body.148  The development of the aggregation model largely alleviates this problem but does not eliminate it.  Often, there is a large gap between the ability to prove the occurrence of a criminal act or the infliction of harm, which is ostensibly obvious, and the finding of the perpetrators, particularly those whose mental state may be considered as the organization’s intent.  In these circumstances, it is feared that broad realms of economic activity involving large legal bodies will evade criminal responsibility.  This problem has intensified as a result of the significant growth in the number of criminal intent offenses on issues of control, which are typical of business corporations, such as offenses related to environment, product liability, commercial manners and procedures, standards and measures, work safety, etc.  The possibility of rendering a corporation liable while renouncing the need to prove personal culpability or locating a specific perpetrator and, instead, finding support in such concepts as ethos and policy that develop on the basis of general 148. See Weinstein &amp; Ball, supra note 70, at 67. </page> <page sequence="62"> LEDERMANMACRO 1/10/01  4:26 PM 702 BUFFALO CRIMINAL LAW REVIEW [Vol.  4:641 assumptions rather than on specific information available to the perpetrator, significantly broadens the maneuverability available to the enforcement authorities. It is questionable, however, whether these two reasons can tilt the scales in favor of the model.  Concerning the first topic, it does not grant an absolute advantage to the identity model.  The deterrence goal noted above can also be attained by turning directly to the high ranks and compelling them personally, as managers, to develop and implement plans for complying with the law within the organization.149  Developing the notion of personal liability in high managerial agents offers a more effective deterrent, since its imposition is more painful than the indirect harm to management resulting from imposing liability on the corporation they direct.  Concerning the capacity to deter management, then, an alternative solution is available, even more effective than using the model of self-identity.150 The power of the second argument, dealing with effective enforcement, is also limited.  Making it easier for the prosecution by facilitating criminal procedures against corporations is not an end in itself.  The weight and power 149. This may be compared with the opinion that the identification model may, from a certain perspective, discourage the high managerial agents from properly supervising their subordinate employees and agents, seemingly because of worry that it may entail claims of ratification of the agent’s misconduct and impose personal liability on the supervising echelon.  See Bucy, supra note 118, at 1100- 01. 150. But cf. Fisse &amp; Braithwaite, supra note 22, at 57-58.  These two scholars argue with regard to personal liability within corporate framework, that: Under the strategy of individualism, the response to the present problems of non-accountability for corporate crime is to abolish corporate criminal liability and thereby apply pressure on enforcement agencies to prosecute individual personnel.  This strategy is unconvincing because, at the most fundamental levels of inquiry, individualism persistently fails to capture the corporate significance of the corporate operations over which the law seeks to exercise control.  The philosophical platform of methodological individualism is as lop-sided as its opposite, methodological holism. . . . Individualism is also an enforcement strategy prone to threaten the very protections of individuals against injustice that liberal individualists most cherish.  It fails to recognize, much less to exploit, the internal disciplinary systems that have become an essential feature of modern corporate existence. Id. </page> <page sequence="63"> LEDERMANMACRO 1/10/01  4:26 PM 2000] MODELS FOR CORPORATE LIABILITY 703 of this mitigation is a function of the question of to what extent does it achieve a fair and appropriate result according to the principles and the basic approaches of criminal law?  On the one hand, this question is inextricably linked to ethical issues.  It also merges with the central claim of this model’s supporters, namely, that we are dealing with the correct and appropriate structure of the liability of legal bodies; a structure that fits the corporate construct and thus reflects reality more accurately than the model of identification, which is based on a legal fiction.151 We are still at the beginning of this discussion, which will probably continue to occupy those concerned with criminal law in the coming years.  In the course of the discussion, however, attention should be paid, inter alia, to the three topics outlined below. (1) To what extent is the self-identity model compatible with the principle of individualism, and with ideas of personal autonomy and personal responsibility that follow from it?152  Such compatibility is to be expected because individual autonomy, which is based on the principle of freedom of will and of choice (and, as a result, personal liability) are the cornerstones of criminal law.  Violating this notion undermines the central foundation of criminal law. The model of self-identity is deterministically biased concerning the behavior of individuals within the organization.  Reliance on the self-identity model to describe some legal bodies, and particularly older and larger corporations, as frameworks that dictate, to a large extent, the behavior of their employees,153 is meant to emphasize the unique contribution of the corporation and its liability for the behavior and the events unfolding within the corporate framework, and thus build its self 151.  See supra text accompanying notes 42, 92. 152. For presentation and analysis of these ideas and principles, see Steven Lukes, Individualism (1973); H.L.A. Hart, Punishment and Responsibility ch. 6 (1968); Joel Feinberg, Harm to Self chs. 17-19 (1986). 153. See supra Section D 3. </page> <page sequence="64"> LEDERMANMACRO 1/10/01  4:26 PM 704 BUFFALO CRIMINAL LAW REVIEW [Vol.  4:641 identity.  Yet, notions that support the molding of individual behavior and the limitation of individual freedom within corporate frameworks are also harmful to the principle of freedom of choice among these employees which, in turn, underlies the idea of individual autonomy.154 Without freedom of will and choice, there is no room for the perpetrator’s criminal liability. On the surface, it could be claimed that this violation of the foundation of criminal law is not specific to the model of self-identity.  Sociology shows that any social instrument or framework—including the family, schools, the community, literature, the media, and so on—“patterns,” at least to some extent, the behavior of the individuals.  Thus, it seeks to understand individual behavior within the socio- cultural network of contexts into which they were born, and within which they grow up, are educated, live, and act.155 However, no one claims that this sort of limitation of an individual’s freedom affects his personal liability.  At the theoretical level, however, the claim concerning the deterministic bias is stronger within the model of self- identity.  In fact, this is one of the central axes of the model, if not the central one.  Within the model of self- identity, the idea of “patterning” results from the acknowledgement of mere self-identity.  Hence, in the conceptual context, this line of thought and the principle of free will clash more strongly.  Consequently, supporters of the self-identity model are called upon to engage in a more cautious and detailed analysis. (2) The model of self-identity perceives the concept of the criminal state of mind differently from the conventional approach.156  In this model, the mens rea is not a subjective 154. See Field &amp; JCrg, supra note 9, at 160, 167. 155. See Raymond Williams, The Long Revolution ch. 3 (1965); Field &amp; JCrg, supra note 9, at 160. 156.

In other words, the subjective element in the offense is not a mixture of a fixed, rational- cognitive element, involving both understanding and perception, and a functional element, built from affective- emotional ways of relating to this body of knowledge. Instead, the model of identity emphasizes objective and constructive elements.  The corporation’s criminal intent is actually presented as the gap between the set of social expectations from the legal body and its actual modes of behavior.  Latent in the statement that the corporation has mens rea is a critique of its behavioral codes and its methods of management and control. It could indeed be held that the objectivization process often characterizes the determination of ordinary criminal mens rea.  Prominent examples are the use of factual presumptions that rely on life experience and conclude the presence of intent from the circumstances of the event, or above all, the presumption that “a person intents the natural consequences of his/her act.”  Another example is the inclusion of such objective elements as the type of social utility latent in risk taking, which is part of the definition of recklessness.157 Despite the similarities, however, the two should be separated, since the conceptual foundation in these two cases is different.  Regardless of the objective signs, traditional mens rea adheres to the subjective ethos and idea.  Resorting to objective presumptions is only an auxiliary tool for discovering the subjective essence, in the absence of an instrument capable of disclosing the secrets hidden in a person’s heart.  The subjective element in recklessness does not alter the principles of this basic approach.  The essence of recklessness remains subjective, although an objective element is added to the general subjective structure of this form of mens rea.  The perception of mens rea in the identity model is different. The consideration of the criminal mental state in terms of a 157. See Model Penal Code § 2.02(2)(c) (Proposed Official Draft 1962). </page> <page sequence="66"> LEDERMANMACRO 1/10/01  4:26 PM 706 BUFFALO CRIMINAL LAW REVIEW [Vol.  4:641 gap between the proper and existing mechanisms of decision-making and monitoring, namely, the examination of the existing mechanisms in the corporation as opposed to those desirable under similar circumstances, actually endorses the criteria of negligence.  Thus, the liability of legal bodies, even in distinctive offenses of mens rea, will be decided by examining whether mechanisms for decision- making and monitoring were negligent in the fulfillment of their roles.158 Adopting the model of self-identity could lead to the endorsement of a different basis for determining the criminal liability of corporations and of individuals with regard to the same offenses of mens rea.  Latent in this functional result is a fear of creating a winding and mainly slippery slope that, eventually, may also project on the structure and perception of the criminal mental states of individuals.  Such a prospect calls for extreme caution. (3) A third topic worthy of concern touches the seams between various branches of law and various types of liability.  Attention has recently been devoted to the vagueness and deleterious effects on efficiency that might ensue from the penetration of criminal law into areas that, traditionally, had been regulated by civil law, first among which are the law of torts and law of property.159  The model of self-identity sheds light on this issue from another angle, which is not based on an overlap of scope but on a 158.

There are significant similarities between the logic of imposing criminal liability on legal bodies while pointing to flaws in mechanisms of implementation, control, or monitoring, and the imposition of administrative liability at the public level.  In both cases, it is not necessarily claimed that the accused is the perpetrator of the illegal act or omission but, rather, that it is the entity that is responsible for creating the conditions and the environment that engendered the offense, and hence its liability.  Naturally, these conditions or this environment also deal with methods of implementation and control, and are another manifestation of the ethos idea involved in the self-identity model. Indeed, the noted similarity is only partial.  Thus, for instance, whereas the entity in question at the criminal level is a legal body, at the civil level we are usually concerned with an individual heading this public body. Furthermore, the principle of administrative responsibility is close to the concept of vicarious liability, whereas the model of self-identity deals with direct liability.  Yet, despite these distinctions, the shared conceptual characteristics remain. An interesting phenomenon, worthy of further consideration, emerges at this point.  Continental law has traditionally tended to consider the liability of legal bodies at the public level as part of administrative law rather than as part of criminal law.  Only the personal liability of managers was considered part of the criminal arena.160 European countries are now changing their approach and, due to considerations of legal policy, are distancing themselves from the administrative umbrella and shifting this concern to the domain of criminal law.  In other words, the continental approach endorses the basic Anglo- American point of view.161  A new model, however, is simultaneously beginning to develop within Anglo- American law that, from a certain perspective, moves in 160.

The model of self-identity is conceptually close, at least in part, to the basic ideas of administrative law, although it does not go as far as suggesting that this issue be shifted from the criminal to the administrative domain. The issue of borders impinges on more general and complex issues of law.  At its base is the question of whether to favor the approach that supports the unification of law, shifting the emphases, if necessary, from questions of classification still imbued with a formal character, toward a general dialogue about values that do not acknowledge unessential divisions. Serious and profound discussion of these and other issues should precede any decisions concerning the model of self-identity. </page> </plain_text>
