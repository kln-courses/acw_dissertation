<plain_text><page sequence="1">dmerica n SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW Volume 1 JUNE, 1936 Number 3 EARLY ENGLISH POSITIVISTS AND THE RELIGION OF HUMANITY GLADYS BRYSON Smith College INTRODUCTION.-It is, of course, a trite remark-and one made more frequently by sociologists than by their gibing critics- that sociology has not yet come to that development which commands from its adherents wholehearted agreement as to the objectives to be aimed at, the field to be limited, and the methods to be used. Not only is this lack of unanimity characteristic of the science as a whole, when viewed apart from national boundaries, but even within each country there is still to be found great diversity of opinion as to the major concepts and abstractions of this field of inquiry. England seems to offer the one exception. It is not that English sociologists have consciously developed an agreement and so are working as a unified group for the advancement of their science, for they seem to be less aware of disagreement and of the controversial aspects of the situation than most workers in the field. It is rather that there seems to be a fairly general acceptance of the idea that there is something called a sociological point of view which can be applied to economics, anthropology, religion, or what not, but that point of view is infinitely elastic and does not cry to be defined nor elaborated into a separate discipline. As examples of this position we may note the extremely valuable researches of the Webbs in socioeconomic history, of the Hammonds in the same field, and of the sociological implications of the work of the anthro- pologist Westermarck. It may be remarked, in passing, that Wester- 343</page><page sequence="2">344 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW marck held for many years in the University of London the chair known as the Martin White Professorship of Sociology. The twin chair of the same name was held by the philosopher Leonard Hob- house, who, while he wrote and taught metaphysics and logic among his subjects, was much interested in social processes and social rela- tionships-as any moral philosopher ought to be. Indeed, it might be said that Hobhouse was the last of the great moral philosophers. His work has the dimensions of the eighteenth-century formulations and many of the same objectives. In an informative paper written several years ago Harry Elmer Barnes described and analyzed the condition of sociology in Eng- land.' Thinking over that condition, that "fate" as Barnes calls it, I venture to suggest two reasons for it. The first I submit in the form of a question and with a light mind: Who could have followed Her- bert Spencer and felt that he had anything to say? Unless, of course, he were willing simply to fill in a few more concrete details for Spencer's elaborately-devised scheme of the social organism in evo- lution. The second suggestion, made quite seriously, is that, Spencer aside, sociology got off on the wrong foot in England by making too much, not of the scientific aspects of Comte the founder's work, but of his Religion of Humanity, and that the discredit attached to that position has never entirely been shaken off from the name and profession of sociology in England. It remains true that one of the most puzzling and irreconcilable rifts in any one system of thought is that which exists between Comte's Positive Philosophy and his Positive Polity. The first was written under the spell of his worship of science and his dream of what the use of the positive or scientific method could bring to light concerning human relationships and human history. The newest of the sciences, sociology, would be the channel through which this knowledge would be gained. The second work was written under the spell of his worship of Clothilde de Vaux and his memory of their year of love. In place of the calm detachment supposed to charac- terize a scientist there is all the zeal of a preaching monk who has, moreover, gone a bit fanatic about details as well as objectives. Religion, earlier scorned as the stumbling precursor of and obstruc- tion to science, had become for him the great social bond, the en- nobler of men and nations, the practical method by which sociology I Barnes, "The Fate of Sociology in England," in the Pub.

True, it is not a theologi- cal religion, nor a supernatural, but a Religion of Humanity. Its organization was to be uncannily like that of Roman Catholicism, however, with its hierarchy of sociologists in place of priests, its calendar of great men in place of saints, its feast and fast days, its pilgrimages to shrines of departed servants of humanity. Small wonder that Huxley could not resist his gibe and called it Catholi- cism minus Christianity. Now it was this aspect of the work of Auguste Comte which appealed to a group of young scholars in England in the middle of the last century. True, another Englishman, and he no less a one than John Stuart Mill, had spoken at some length and with praise of some leads on method enunciated in the Positive Philosophy. Throughout his Logic (I843) he had written of Comte enthusiasti- cally, and as late as his little book Juguste Comte and Positivism (i865) he was still in agreement with Comte's general conception of history, even while he felt that Comte had failed to create sociology. But the real impact of Comte in England was made not on the care- ful logician Mill, but on a group of young men at Wadham College, Oxford, who were students of history and very much interested in the religious situation of their day. Chief among them was Frederic Harrison, who afterward came to be one of England's most eminent literary critics and historians of literature. The Beginnings of Positivism at Oxford.-In the seventeenth century Wadham College had been the first home of the Royal Society, but in the nineteenth century it had come to emphasize philosophy and the classics2-as, indeed, most of the Oxford col- leges consistently did. In the 'fifties, about two-thirds of the students had come from Anglican parsonages, and about two-thirds were destined for holy orders. Nearly all the tutors were ordained; the Warden lectured on the "Articles of Religion" which all members of the University on their admission were still at that time required to sign; students were required to attend the service in chapel every day and twice on Sunday, and not only to hear the university ser- mon but to abstract and summarize it each week. In looking back on this state of affairs, and with reference especially to the university sermon, Harrison afterward wrote: Every Master of Arts in orders had his turn, and he naturally took the occasion to expound his cherished dogma. Sunday after Sunday, year after year, the official 2 F. S.

Priests who had all but "gone over with Newman" followed priests who had driven him forth with Protestant anathemas.3 Turning to the subject of the changes in his own religious thought while in college Harrison continues: Very slowly, gradually, and peaceably, under this continual ebb and flow of theological discussions, my school taste for ritualism and my calm acceptance of orthodox doctrine melted away into a sense of suspended judgment and anxious thirst for wider knowledge.... John Henry Newman led me on to his brother Francis.... I read Theodore Parker's American Discourses; and, if I was not con- verted to "Universal Salvation", certainly he and Maurice and Francis Newman relieved my youthful mind of any fear of an eternity of Hell.4 But what most disturbed young Harrison and some of his like- minded friends was not just the criticisms on the inspiration of the Scriptures and the credibility of the creeds but "the really dishonest practice of promoting within the Established Church and its endow- ments what was called 'Free-handling,' but what was really una- vowed repudiation of Christianity as a dogmatic religion." Com- menting later on this situation, Harrison says, "But what the Church has won in Liberty it has lost in Honesty. . . The Creed became a matter of open opinion." And he cites with evident approv- al Comte's reference to the English Church as Z'hypocrisie Angli- cane.5 Harrison's group of close friends at Wadham included Edward Spencer Beesly, afterward professor of history at University College, London, professor of Latin at Bedford College, and still later head of University College. He was the author of several historical treatises6 and editor, for many years after its founding, of the Posi- tivist Review. Another was John Henry Bridges, afterward a practic- ing physician in Yorkshire and Inspector under the Local Govern- ment Board. In the group was George Earlham Thorley, later ward- en of his own college, Wadham. In the course of their college years together they formed a little club for discussion of social, political and religious questions, which, known as the Confederacy of the Scholars of Wadham, gave in time a distinctive character to the I Frederic Harrison, The Creed of a Layman, Macmillan Co., I907, pp. I3-I4. 4 Ibid., p. i6.

But at the time of its formation this club was christened by some of its flippant student critics "Mumbo-Jumbo," in honor, supposedly, of the "fetish," the cold duck on which these four breakfasted each Sunday morning at the beginning of their hours and hours of discussion.7 Serious young fellows these were, with quite as deep an interest in history as in philosophy and theology. Indeed, history was to them one of the stumbling blocks in the way of achieving a satisfying philosophy or theology. For, until history could be seen as subject to law, what could philosophy and theology do with aberrant events? Their mentor throughout these years was one of their tutors, Richard Congreve (I8I8-I899), "the center of the most active spirits in the University."8 Congreve had been moulded at Rugby by Dr. Arnold, who had the greatest affection and esteem for him, and who had recalled Congreve to Rugby as a master after he had taken first-class honors at Oxford. He was, however, soon back at Wadham College as a tutor (i848-54), and though like most of the other tutors of the period he was in holy orders, his abiding interest was history and the possibility of finding its laws.9 As for the religion of this tutor, Harrison says that he had already ceased to be Chris- tian but he did not criticize the Christian faith. He did not mention Comte or even his writings in the course of his Oxford teaching and discussion, though one account has it that he met Comte in Paris in i848. It is a fact that Comte and Congreve corresponded over a period of five years (December 23, i852-August i2, I857), and for two of these years Congreve was still at Wadham.10 Considering the fact that his correspondence contains warm expressions of ap- preciation from Comte to his "excellent disciple," it seems very strange that Congreve should not have talked with his pupils about Comte. Instead, they were left to discover Comte, as in the case of I Harrison, Autobiographic Memoirs, as cited, Vol. I, 87, 96, IOO; Vol. II, 25I-253. 8 Ibid., Vol, 1, 28i. 9 His list of publications in history includes: The Roman Empire of the West (i855); Eliza- beth of England (i862); Historical Lectures (i9o2). In addition he published an annotated edi- tion of Aristotle's Politics (I 855; 2nd ed. i874); Essays, Political, Social and Religious (i874; 2nd series i892); translated from the French: Comte's Catechism of Positive Religion (i 858; 3rd ed. i89i). 10 Philip Thomas, Auguste Comte and Richard Congreve.

Among the letters cited in this discourse there is one signed "your spiritual father, Auguste Comte"; another addressed to "my eminent dis- ciple." In a late one Comte says: "You offer me the first important exception to the purely intellectual character of the support I have received in England," and goes on to speak of the sterility of Mill's position because he had failed to proceed from the philosophy to the polity and religion.

Brit. speaks of Congreve meeting Comte in I 848.</page><page sequence="6">348 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW Harrison, through Mill's Logic, through Littre's summary of the Positive Philosophy, and Harriet Martineau's abridged translation of the latter piece of work. As Harrison reminds us, Comte was still, in spite of Mill, almost unheard of in England, and the Polity did not appear until I854. But these boys, reading for themselves and listening to Congreve, discussed in Mumbo-Jumbo privacy whether Congreve's interpretation of history might not have been derived from Comte." Here was a situation which allowed the minds of a group of Oxford men to be responsive to Comte, Frenchman that he was and in a day when Englishmen were not keen to accept ideas from across the channel. Here was an intense interest in history and an eagerness to see it based on induction, as other sciences were coming to be, and synthesized so that laws might be enunciated. Here was disgust with the dishonesty of latitudinarian churchmen, but an unhappiness at the thought of facing the alternative of no religion. Let us note how this little group from Wadham continued in later life to express these same interests and thereby established for a time, though in a limited association, the sway of Comte in England. The Religion of Humanity in London.-Richard Congreve re- signed as Fellow and Tutor of Wadham in i854 and devoted himself to learning and practicing the Comtean philosophy and religion. Frederic Harrison's undergraduate days ended in I 853, and after one year as Librarian at the Oxford Union, in which he continued reading in history, philosophy, and theology, he became Congreve's successor as Fellow and Tutor of Wadham. But he felt the urge to have a less restricted life than an academic career promised, so at the end of a year he too left Oxford and began the study of law at Lincoln's Inn. But before beginning his studies he went to Paris and met Auguste Comte. Harrison introduced himself modestly as a pupil of Congreve, and confessed that his chief knowledge of Comte's philosophy had been gained through Harriet Martineau's transla- tion, and that of that he could follow only the historical portion. He confessed further that he still called himself a Christian. Harrison reports of this occasion: "Our interview lasted some hours and im- pressed me profoundly . . . He spoke entirely as a philosopher- much as J. S. Mill would speak-not at all as a priest ... no man 11 Harrison, Creed of a Layman, as cited, pp. i8-i9; autobiographic Memoirs, Vol. I, pp. 83-88; Vol. II, pp. 25I-252.</page><page sequence="7">EARLY ENGLISH POSITIVISTS 349 I have ever seen, unless it were Mazzini, was so impressive as a powerful personality and genius."'2 Harrison was only twenty-two at the time of this interview. One of the chief impressions it made upon him was the inadequacy of his Oxford education-almost no knowledge of science and mathemat- ics. Comte had said that those lacks were the cause of his mental condition! Oxford had, however, made him, as he says, "a confirmed disciple of the Philosophy of Experience and the Relativity of Knowledge, in the sense of Mill's Logic and Spencer's First Princi- ples."'3 On this basis, under the stimulus of Comte's goading remark, and on the realization that most of Comte's system would remain unintelligible to him otherwise, he put himself to a study of the physical sciences, along with his more formal study of law. His clos- est friends were doctors of medicine and professors of history, and among his acquaintances were writers such as George Eliot, George Henry Lewes, John Chapman, Francis Newman, Herbert Spencer. Looking back on his intellectual achievements by the time he had been seven years out of Oxford, he says of himself: ... I had become rooted in a conviction of the universal reign of Law, of the possibility of a real social science, and in Comte's Scheme of historical evolution. To this now was added a general knowledge of Comte's Positive Polity, completed in i855, and a thorough study of the Origin of Species and Herbert Spencer's Syn- thetic Philosophy. Harrison goes on to add that by now the whole scheme of the Hebrew-Christian story had become to him like a tradition, like the Hindu or Hellenic mythology-parts of it childish, parts shockingly immoral, parts rich in meaning for the human soul, but not to be taken for fact nor for moral standard.'4 Still, however, he continued to follow Christian worship in many forms, and church music and architecture helped to fill his spirit with a content which the doc- trines themselves could not provide.' Between i86o and I870 Harrison assimilated the whole system of Comte and continued his studies in science. He frequently visited Paris, and met the circle of Comteans. Comte himself had died in I857, but there were Pierre Laffitte, his pupil and successor, and Dr. Robinet, his physician and biographer, and other disciples to be 12 Harrison, Autobiographic Memoirs, Vol. I, pp. 98-99. 13 Harrison, The Creed of a Layman, p. 20. 14 Ibid., pp. 22-25. 1f Ibid., pp. 35-36.</page><page sequence="8">350 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW drawn out. Finally his religious convictions began to clarify and he reached that position which he maintained throughout his life, an apostle of the Positive Faith. His own words are interesting as to the way in which he came to the position: In the main it was a gradual fading away of the conception of Personality behind the mystery of the Universe and a clearer perception of the Human Providence that controls Man's destiny on earth ... As a further study of Astronomy, Physics, and Biology impressed on me all that is meant by the Infinite, the incalculable im- mensity of the Universe and all it holds, the infinitesimal littleness of man's earth- even of the solar system-relatively to this Universe, I came to see the arrogance of making man in any sense the measure of Eternity, Omnipotence, Infinitude. To apply our anthropomorphic fancies to the Providence that we think has created and rules the Universe, at last seemed to me to be impertinence, silliness, a profane dream. Again, the deepening sense of the persistence of human action in the sum ot civilization-the spiritual continuity of Humanity triumphing over the material death of the body-gradually drove out in my mind any yearning for celestial glory ... On the other hand, as I recognized the trivial fictions, the barbarous pettiness, of the obsolete theology, I fully realized the scientific reality and the in- finite resources of the Religion of Humanity. Its creed could never be doubtful, for it rests on accepted science. Its manifold sympathies enter into every pore of human life, and touch chords in every fibre of human nature. Its potential worship offers to the imagination magnificent fields for the cultivation of noble Art and the ideal embodiment of every manly and every womanly virtue. To my historic training and my aesthetic passion, it seemed that the worship of the Future was destined far to surpass the stunted worship of the Past, for it would combine and develop all the cults of all the religions-Egyptian, Judaic, Confucian, Buddhist, Hellenic, Roman, Byzantine, or Catholic.'6 But Harrison's interest in history was not lost. At the new Work- ing Men's College in Great Ormond Street he gave a series of lec- tures on history. He wanted to revise the course of instruction along the lines suggested by Comte to achieve a synthesis, but this sugges- tion did not please Frederic Maurice, founder of the College. Harri- son, therefore, betook himself to another platform, the Free-Thought Hall in Cleveland street, and gave the series which was published as The Meaning of History (I862).17 The Comtean elements are appar- ent from even a cursory review of the volume. Other members of the original Wadham group were following the road to Positivism, too. Bridges, by now established in his medical practice, had already translated Comte's General View of the Positive Philosophy. Beesly had since i859 been professor of history at Uni- versity College, London, and a bit later began collaboration with Harrison, Bridges, and Congreve in the translation of the Positive 16 Ibid., pp. 44-46. 17 Ibid., p. 46.</page><page sequence="9">EARLY ENGLISH POSITIVISTS 35I Polity. Congreve had translated and published Comte's Catechism. Congreve had become so committed to the Polity that he studied for and achieved the degree of Doctor of Medicine. His motive was not only the acquiring of the amount of scientific knowledge he would of necessity learn but the preparation of himself for the Positive Priest- hood. Comte had included medicine within the domain of the priest- hood, and Congreve's mind had from early in his discipleship begun to turn to the religious aspects of the Comtean system. Comte had in i8So established in Paris a Positivist Society, and in i867 Congreve decided to found a similar group in London. The nature of this society was not religious-it was a sort of forum for the discussion of social, economic, and political questions. The point of view to be maintained was that of international morality, na- tional independence, peace, order, progress. Congreve was president the first year, then Professor Beesly until i9oi, then another his- torian and positivist, Mr. Shapland Hugh Swinney. The preliminary meetings were held in Harrison's rooms, and he was always a mem- ber of the Society, though never an officer. He thought the organiza- tion at this time premature. This Society may be considered the nucleus from which all later developments of Positivism in England grew.18 But it did not satisfy Congreve's ambitions, and he began to plan for the opening of a Positivist School. Programs were completed and the School opened at i9 Chapel Street, in Holborn, London. In this he was not encouraged by Harrison, who felt that no permanent pro- gram should be entered upon until the group of sponsors was both larger and better instructed in the Comtean system. But Harrison could not bring himself to abandon his old friend and tutor, and as time went on found himself not only sharing in the expenses but at- tending lectures on history, politics, and philosophy, and even giving lectures in Congreve's absence, several times, on historical evolution. He even went so far as to have his sons "presented" by Dr. Congreve in the ritual prescribed by Comte for the recognition of infants by a group of Positivist adults.'9 Now the Positivist movement in France had found itself split after Comte's death. Comte had appointed Pierre Laffitte his literary executor, on the ground that Laffitte accepted the whole Comtean scheme including the Religion of Humanity. After Comte's death his 18 Harrison, Autobiographic Memoirs, Vol. II, p. 256; Creed of a Layman, p. 47. 1' Autobiographic Memoirs, Vol. II, pp. 258-259.</page><page sequence="10">352 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW disciples elected Laffitte as their Director of Positivism. The other claimant to the position of leadership was also a friend of Comte, but a friend who had departed from the position of his mentor much as Comte had departed from that of Saint-Simon. Maximilian Paul Emile Littre, distinguished lexicographer, philosopher, and member of the Acadimie Franfaise, could not accept the abracadabra of Comte's prescription for a sociocracy organized about religion.20 He was one of those who felt the irreconcilable inconsistencies between the earlier Philosophy, based as it was on a scientific and materialistic interpretation of phenomena, and the Polity. The latter retained the use of the word "positive," to be sure, but it broke with the ideas of continuity and the working out of a law of autonomous though rela- tive development which would give justification for the use of the adjective. Not that Comte in words repudiated his former major con- cepts, but the new emphasis on the organization of society around the worship of Humanity was not conceived of as an automatic proc- ess but one to be entered on by the conscious efforts of men and by use of high-powered organizational ability. The English group (always with the exception of Mill and Lewes) had not been concerned with these inconsistencies. Attracted at first by the Comtean interpretation of history, with its emphasis on con- tinuity and relativity, they had, however, responded most warmly to the appeal of the Comtean religion without trying to reconcile the two positions. There was no question for them, then, as to which of Comte's contending successors they were to ally themselves with. Laffitte was their man. But in both England and France there was some feeling that Laffitte, while accepting the Religion of Humanity as an integral part of the Comtean system, was nevertheless too in- tellectual in his leadership. Not much warmth and fervor animated his direction of the Positivist program. By the year 1877 there was an open movement of dissatisfaction. Chief among the aggressive dissatisfied ones was Richard Congreve, who agitated among English and French Positivists for secession from Laffitte.21 The discontent was registered most dramatically in England in the splitting-off of Congreve and his closest followers and their setting up in I 878 of 20 Comte definitely broke with Littre on another matter-the coup d'itat of Louis Napoleon, in i85I, which Comte approved. This is discussed by Comte in a letter to Congreve of De- cember 23, I852. See the Discourse by Philip Thomas on "Auguste Comte and Richard Con- greve," cited above. 21 Malcolm Quin, Memoirs of a Positivist, London, I924, pp. 8o-82. Quin writes as an ardent follower of Congreve and perhaps overestimates the amount of general dissatisfaction with Laffitte, though not of Congreve's.</page><page sequence="11">EARLY ENGLISH POSITIVISTS 353 The Church of Humanity. More and more Congreve's turn of thought and interest had been to the devotional and ritualistic prac- tice, the sonorous and prophetic phrase, and for himself he saw the priestly function just ahead. The fact that Comte had said that, among several others, Congreve was suitable for the priesthood in the new religion, had come to occupy his mind very completely. The Church of Humanity, which the School in Chapel Street now be- came, had Congreve and no other for its head, either in England or France. Frederic Harrison insists that "there was no single point of opin- ion, nor any question of practical policy, whereon we were at all divided. It began, and long remained, a purely personal question. The cause of division was that Richard Congreve insisted on making himself the sole head of a religious and philosophical society, with- out director or colleagues, having none to whom he could even be compared, or to whom he need look for advice."22 Harrison further indicates that Congreve's followers from this point on were not those of adequate philosophic and scientific training, and that this split was ruinous to the Positivist cause. How great a change had come over the former tutor of Wadham! What a wrench this break must have been to more than one of his former pupils! The process of his changing is outlined by Harrison in another context. Speaking of Congreve's absorption in his new studies in those years after he left Oxford, he has this to say: Gradually in his isolation from all competent colleagues, and the failure of his far too sanguine hopes, his strong nature and passionate convictions became hard- ened into a despotic arrogance in which the future of Humanity and his own domi- nant personality became identified in his own mind as the "Cause," to which everything like friendship, toleration, and common sense had to be sacrificed. He would brook no opposition or advice, nor even any difference of opinion. Those who did not accept hisfiat were his opponents. And at last I found myself in that list. I saw that his mode of presenting Positivism as a new Revelation vouchsafed to Auguste Comte-and ultimately to himself-would delay the acceptance of ra- tional Positivism for more than one generation.23 This bolt of Congreve's, oddly enough, put the larger part of the group-the Harrison, Beesly, Bridges contingent-out of posses- sion of the rooms in Chapel Street. For about two and a half years they planned and gave lectures in the usual manner but in different places, carrying on as the Positivist Committee of Seven, appointed for England by Pierre Laffitte. In May of i88i new headquarters 22 Harrison, Autobiographic Memoirs, Vol. II, pp. 258-259. 3 Ibid., Vol. I, pp. 350-35L.</page><page sequence="12">354 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW were obtained in a building owned by the Scottish Corporation in Fleur-de-lis Court, Fetter Lane. The place was entirely renovated, re-decorated chiefly with busts and pictures of great men of all ages, and named Newton Hall, in memory of Sir Isaac, who had purchased the ground for the erection of a building in which to house the treas- ures of the Royal Society. Here until I902, when the Scottish Cor- poration again needed the use of the building, was carried on the program of the second Positivist group. Pierre Laffitte came over from Paris for the opening of the hall and the usual activities were engaged in as before the break with Congreve. Bridges was made President of this group. It was not that these members of the new Positivist Society wanted to slight the religious sections of Comte's system. Indeed, while Laffitte was in London he administered two of the Positivist sacraments-the Presentation of an infant and the Admission of a young man.24 They would have agreed with Harrison that "Man without religion is a nutshell in the wind."25 For them, as for Comte, Positivism's ideal was "to enlarge the sphere of re- ligion, to make it broaden till every common act of existence is a religious act, and the rule of man's spiritual nature shall be acknowl- edged in industry, in art, in politics, in every social institution and habit. But, to do this religion must descend from the empyrean to dwell with men on earth, caring for the things of this life."26 Accord- ingly, their method was chiefly that of education-by lectures, by discussions, by classes. Twenty years earlier Harrison had written in his diary a warm comment to which his adherents assented heart- ily in their practice: Positivism as yet can be only Education. Educate men to it! Educate yourselves for it! Learn how you are henceforth to be able to organize a community when you have collected a sufficient body of men prepared to work together. After all, in the distant future the great end of Positivism will always be to found a moral, mental, and practical education. Address men through all channels. Ask them for little but to prepare their minds and hearts. A John the Baptist may be needed to prepare. We are not yet ready for a Christ.27 Newton Hall became, as Harrison had promised when he took over the presidency of the Society in i88i (Bridges had to be away from London so much that he felt he could not perform the duties 24 Lorenzo Rodd, "Newton Hall-and After," in Humanity, Vol. 32, I924, pp. 2II if. 25 Autobiographic Memoirs, Vol. I, p. 2I3. 26 Harrison, in the Pall Mall Gazette, November 29, 1883, "Centres of Spiritual Activity- No. II.

Let us look at the pro- gram of the Society. We have already seen not only that the inter- ests of these English Positivists lay in the interpretation of history so that its unity, its continuity, and the relativity of its phenomena to other phenomena might be better grasped, but also that they were zealous to make contemporary history ethical. That is to say, every public question was to them a moral question, to be viewed from the vantage point of a member of Humanity, and not simply from that of a nationalistic Frenchman or an imperialistic Englishman or a jingoistic American. This group of Englishmen, then, spoke out against England's policy in Ireland and India and South Africa. They were ardent reformers in city government. They engaged in city planning, Harrison himself designing the Kingsway in London. They urged the better organization and spread of trades unions. Harrison, again, urged the restoration of the Elgin Marbles to Greece, regretting the way in which they had come into the posses- sion of the British Museum and saying that the modern Greeks needed to keep in their own land these symbols of their ancient heroic religion. Discussion groups, lectures, pamphlets were used to inform people of the issues involved in these political and social questions. "Men are apt," wrote Harrison, "to think that that which is political ceases to be spiritual. On the contrary, to be deaf and dumb in the realm of political duty is to be lost to the profoundest sources of spiritual strength."28 On analyzing the activities, Lorenzo Rodd29 lists the many classes taught in the school and notes that most subjects were treated, fol- lowing Comte's method, from the historical point of view. The list of club activities reads somewhat like that of a Y.M.C.A. in a town too small to have a Y.W.C.A. There were men's clubs which met monthly, with Beesly as president. There was a social meeting once a month at which the ladies were hostesses. Among the guests would be occasionally Patrick Geddes, Kegan Paul, and George Gissing- who, by the way, was for a time tutor for Frederic Harrison's sons. There was a women's guild and a girls' guild, both started by Mrs. Harrison. The object of these guilds was "to help break down class distinctions and to ameliorate the lot of the working girls by showing 28 Autobiographic Memoirs, Vol. II, p. 262. 29 Rodd, "Newton Hall-and After," as cited, and 232, ff.

Around the edges of these guilds there were small informal classes planned as the need or desire arose-nothing so formal as a lecture series, per- haps as intimate a group as one organized to learn how to make hats becoming but inexpensive. Later, a young men's and lads' guild was started by S. H. Swinney. Now all of this educational and club program would have brought no criticism nor scepticism to bear on the Society. This was all well in line with the spread of mechanics' institutes, working men's col- leges, and settlements. The Society had its theory as to the underly- ing differences between their activities and those of sponsors of the above-named organizations,30 but from the point of view of an out- sider the activities were all of a piece with other nineteenth-century educational and humanitarian movements. What raised the eye- brows of outsiders was the prevailing rumor as to the kind of re- ligion practiced by the Positivists. We have noted Huxley's charac- terization of Comte's project for a religious society as "Catholicism minus Christianity." Huxley, again not long before his death, said to Harrison, "Why! I always thought you swung a censer on Sun- days before the altar at Chapel Street.""3 But never at Newton Hall was there any elaborate ritual, and there was no sacerdotalism. After a good many years there came to be a sort of exhortation read before the address of the day, an exhortation written by Harrison from the words on Comte's tomb. Later, too, there was a choir which came as a natural result of the singing classes, which had been a success and in i890 a hymnbook, compiled by Harrison and called "The Service of Man" was put in use. The Comtean "sacraments" were administered but there were no robes, no candles, no incense. It must have been as plain and unaesthetic and unsensuous in its appeal as a non-conformist but un-evangelical group anywhere could have wished. Certainly there was none of that quality known to the eight- eenth century as "enthusiasm." Comte had urged on his disciples that they celebrate the occasion when any individual member of their group entered upon a new phase of his life. Here again he was in line not only with Catholic practice but with primitive. Van Gennep's phrase rites du passage expresses Comte's thought fairly well, with the exception that the rites he advocated were very simple. He called them sacraments, the old '0 See Harrison's analysis, Autobiographic Memoirs, Vol. II, pp. 265-28i, 31 Harrison, ibid., p. 270.</page><page sequence="15">EARLY ENGLISH POSITIVISTS 357 Roman term meaning military oath, a term which the church had taken over from the Roman army. As used by the army it had meant simply a public pledge to fulfil a sacred duty. Brushing aside the church's use of the term to express the channel by which the grace of God became available to man, Comte saw fit to use it in his formu- lation of religious practices "to denote a religious ceremony which might give a public consecration to some critical epoch of life. There was nothing mystical or fanciful about this. The idea of Positivism is to connect each typical event in the life of the individual with the interests of society at large by a public profession of duty under some visible external sanction."32 Among these sacraments were Pres- entation of infants, corresponding somewhat, in Positivist princi- ples, to Christian baptism; Initiation, at the entrance on formal edu- cation, corresponding to confirmation; Admission, to signalize the coming to adult age; Destination, to mark publicly the adoption of a profession or a career; Maturity; Marriage; Burial; Commemoration of the dead.33 Earnest, quiet exhortations to duty they were for the most part, ended by a pledge of performance on the part of the per- sons concerned. "As a form of worship, Positivism is simply right living inspired by humane feeling. As a mode of religion, it means nothing but the religion of duty-duty as revealed by science and as idealized by the reverent soul."34 Certain days were festival days for the servants of Humanity. The first day of the year was the Day of Humanity, the last day of the year the Day of All the Dead; the fifth day of September was on the calendar as the Day of Comte's Death, and the last day of leap year was the Day of Good Women. It is well known, of course, that the Comtean year was to be a year of thirteen months, but even before the achievement of that reform the months and weeks were renamed by Positivists in honor of great men of the past. Among the Comtean ceremonies was the worship of the Dead, practiced frequently, but always certainly on the last day of each year which was called the Day of All the Dead. This worship con- sisted in expressing reverence for the great past of Humanity, in acknowledging the debt of the living to the dead. It allowed for prayers to the dead, not as to supernatural agents who may answer a request, but as to former human beings who had had to make the 32 Harrison, Autobiographic Memoirs, Vol. II, p. 279. 33 Ibid.

Insofar as they had lived nobly and for worthy social ends, those now living are advanced in the progress of the race. The Positivist theory on this point took pride to itself that it allowed no individual to be pre-occupied with his own death-a pre-occupation, they thought, which had been fastened upon Christianity by the Fathers. The object of contemplation for them was The Dead-a so- cial pre-occupation in every way. This worship, they felt, was no arbitrary creation of Auguste Comte's, but an institution rooted deeply in human nature, as witness its sway over primitive peoples and the hold of the Catholic worship of saints.35 These activities, then, made up the program of the Society in New- ton Hall. Similarity to the Chapel Street group's activities is appar- ent, but there is less intensity in the religion and less priestly leader- ship than Congreve offered his flock. In I 893 the Positive Committee or Newton Hall group began the publication of a monthly journal, The Positivist Review. Beesly was its first editor, and among the contributors to its first number were Victor Branford and Havelock Ellis, both, as a rule, somewhat criti- cal of Comte and all the activities of his followers. The journal ran under this name until I924, when it changed its title to Humanity. The old name then became a sub-title, but the same format was kept, as was also the Comtean motto, "Order and Progress." This monthly set out to be a forum of opinion as truly as any series of discussions planned at Newton Hall, devoting itself first of all to exposition of questions before Parliament. Its policy in general was to be the "con- servative evolutionist" policy of Positivism, based on a body of prin- ciples and not defending any one party program.36 Glancing through the issues one comes upon discussions of the incorporation of the proletariat into modern society, a Positivist conference on the politi- cal and economic situation in India, a report of a world conference on religion (held in Chicago, and judged a failure). Many discussions centered on the ethics involved in the Great War, many on the objec- tives and tactics of trades unions. Many articles reported new dis- coveries in science. Throughout is displayed earnest effort to see all round the issues facing the English people in their policies at home and abroad, but above all to set the problems so that the gains for 35 Beesly, "The Worship of the Dead.

The tone is consistently against British imperial- ism. Of course, much space is devoted to expositions of the Comtean position on this and that question, much to pointing out the influ- ence of Comte upon various writers as diverse as Froebel, Wells, and Goethe,37 much to accounts of Positivist groups in various towns of England, much to the hopes for America's becoming Positivist.38 One suggestion appears for the organization of Positivist Communities where the corporate life would facilitate the education of the children in Positivist principles.39 But after thirty-two years (in December, i925) the journal had to be discontinued, chiefly for lack of funds. The editors said, in mak- ing the announcement, "No note of regret is here sounded. All civili- zation is now touched by the supreme ideas embodied in such maxims of Auguste Comte's as 'Live for others'," etc., etc. And, gallantly, hopefully, in the same issue appeared this notice: "London Positivist Society. All those who wish to see life inspired by a human religion, guided by a philosophy founded on science, and directed to the service of Man, are cordially invited to enroll them- selves as Associates of the Society."40 Conclusion.-Why did this group, devoted to the Religion of Humanity, fail to make a greater impression in England? For it must be granted that they did fail, both in their dearest objective of re- forming religion into a Religion of Humanity and in their effort to make Comte and sociology widely known in England. The leaders were able men. Frederic Harrison was an outstanding literary critic of his long day, an acute commentator on his own times and the past, a man worthy to be called, as the Encyclopedia Britannica calls him, "the last survivor of the Great Victorians." They were recognized scholars in the field of history, men of the highest ethical judgments, and able at exposition-men of consequence, all of them. Around the fringes of the group, as friends of individual members, if not of the movement, were able men: John Morley, Patrick Geddes, Lord Houghton, Lord Arthur Russell, John Ingram, Havelock Ellis, J. A. Hobson, Benjamin Kidd. But, for this latter and more influential 37 One of the most enthusiastic later Positivists, a disciple of Congreve, Philip Thomas, wrote in a review of G. H. Lewes' Life of Goethe: "The stars in their courses are chanting Positivism at the present moment" (Positivist Rev., Vol. i6, p. I34). 38 For example, Positivist Rev., Vols. 30 and 32. 3' Ibid., Vol. 2, pp. 29 ff. 40 Positivist Rev., Vol. 33, p. 200.</page><page sequence="18">360 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW group, while they were willing enough to grant the suggestiveness of some of Comte's philosophy, his Religion of Humanity was just so much foolishness and a dead weight. Geddes put it well when he wrote in the columns of the Positivist Review; "Now with the utmost respect and gratitude for, and to the Positivist tradition, has it not too much remained traditional in the main? In becoming religious, did it not also become and remain conservative ?"41 George Henry Lewes and George Eliot, warm friends of Congreve and his wife, were both early intrigued with the philosophical and scientific as- pects of the Comtean literature, and embodied many of those ideas in their own writings. But though George Eliot could write her poem "O May I join the Choir Invisible" in the best spirit of the Comtean hope of subjective immortality, for the ideology of the Polity both she and Lewes had only criticism.42 George Eliot, however, did con- tribute to both the Congreve and Harrison groups.43 And so it went. It should be said, in fairness, that if the Religion seemed to most persons an unnecessary burden to assume for the sake of service to humanity, to some others it proved an inadequate and spiritually unsatisfying religion, one that was not religious enough. Several ad- herents found themselves communicants in the Roman Catholic Church before they died. Among these were Philip Thomas, who had been brought up in Welsh Methodism, become a Unitarian and then, through its strong ethical appeal, an adherent of the Religion of Humanity. But death found him a Catholic.44 Kegan Paul also retreated into the more aesthetically and spiritually satisfying an- cient forms.45 So, too, did Malcolm Quin. Quin had been consecrated to the Positivist priesthood by Congreve, and for many years was head of a Positivist Community at Newcastle-on-Tyne. But finally, not altogether happily, he became "a common lay worshipper in the Catholic Church." His lack of complete happiness was due to his wish that the Church could become more "positivized," but even so, it was more satisfying to be in than out of it.46 41 Geddes, in Vol. 32, PP. I45 ff., "A Current Criticism of the Positivist School." 41 Lewes' Biographical History of Philosophy and his Life of Goethe, George Eliot's Felix Holt and her Spanish Gypsy are the works which most mirror Comtean notions. A recent book by Prof. Anna Theresa Kitchell, George Lewes and George Eliot, N.Y., I933, makes their posi- tion very clear. See her index for references. And of course there is Cross's George Eliot's Life, especially Vol. III, which is full of interesting references.

(i) Their energies, he thought, were somewhat scattered and used to little effect in the London Babel. They lacked first-rate secre- tarial assistance behind the scenes. They had no Mrs. Sidney Webb! (2) The public was not ready for them, and (3) the idea was abroad that their entrance requirements were too much like the exami- nation rigmarole of the French schools. (4) Finally, there was no learned society behind the group, so that their lauding of science was not followed by scientific achievement.47 However intellectual its leaders, however prominent, a religion based on science in the way this religion hoped it was based, would have to offer more than eulogy of science. Almost no movement could have survived the trenchant criticism of Huxley and Mill. As Harrison says, Huxley "would fly at a Posi- tivist with even more zest than at a bishop."48 More quietly, but equally effectively, Mill would point out weakness after weakness in the Comtean system. It was certainly true that Mill "had contrib- uted more than any one else to make his speculations known in Eng- land"49 (meaning, of course, the Philosophy), but the Polity he could not accept. He called it "the completest system of spiritual and tem- poral despotism which ever yet emanated from a human brain, un- less possibly that of Ignatius Loyola."60 He regarded thefons errorum in Comte's later speculations to be his inordinate demand for unity and systematization, but, of course, fundamentally there was no sci- entific connection "between his (Comte's) theoretical explanation of the past progress of society and his proposals for future improve- ment. The proposals are not, as we might expect, recommended as that towards which society has been tending and working through the whole of history."'" The Polity, to Mill, exposed "the melancholy decadence of a great intellect."52 historic Christianity, is a natural pessimism with a supernatural hope. . .

Huxley was again in good standing in spite of his aggressive defense of the evolutionary doctrines of Dar- win, and Mill was never out of it so far as his logical acumen was concerned. So the criticisms won. In addition to the weaknesses pointed out by these two and by Geddes one other thing may be said. The Religion of Humanity was the wrong kind of religion for the period in which these devoted men tried to organize and express it. They could have remained conventional middle-of-the-road mem- bers of the Church of England-none would have cared. They could have gone Roman-after Newman, many did go and were granted a sort of grudging recognition of spiritual depth denied the common man. They could have declared themselves agnostic and been in the good and growing company of followers of Spencer and Huxley. But to worship no God, yet to worship; to deny pomp and mystery, yet to talk of sacraments; to place the claims of a vague Humanity above the claims of England-all this was to mouth a religion which was no religion. It was neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red herring. Thus the appeal was not great nor wide, and few adherents were won for the Religion of Humanity. But just enough of it was known for the criticism of it and its disciples to be extended to the science which Comte hoped he had founded and on which he hoped to build his Religion, and sociology, as a consequence, has not yet come in for its share of consideration in England to this day. The chances are, moreover, that it will not until the only reminder of Comte left in it will be just its name.53 13 Many books and pamphlets were drawn on in the preparation of this paper to which no specific reference has been made.
