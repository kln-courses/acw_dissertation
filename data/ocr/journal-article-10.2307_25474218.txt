<plain_text><page sequence="1">Poems as Objects: Invisible Images at the Heart of Lyric Celia Carlson Mt. Hood Community College Recent scholarship has approached poetry as a source of "sensuous knowl edge." Susan Stewart in Poetry and the Fate of the Senses places lyric poetry's affective power in deixis, its constant assertions of this-ness, here-ness, now ness. While this provides an important effort to connect poetry to current in terest in materialism and the body, it neglects the question of how to account for the role of form and of abstraction in poetry's emotional and cognitive power. How do poets use form to incorporate objects and "speak the body"? One answer is that poetry through form establishes a shared space between maker and other, and in that space affective engagements can be made and practiced. It is the abstraction of form that makes those affective engagements possible, and that is part of the ethics of art, in that art provides encounters in which one can experience emotions and achieve cognitions, then be released from the experience unharmed. Another more profound answer involves form as a central trope of mod ernism. Modernism conceives a split between subject and object ? indeed we may regard that as the existential modern condition ? and the ways in which it tries to heal that split are the places where we will find potential answers to the problem of form. Kantian Transcendental philosophy, a major taproot of modernity, posits the relation between a perceiving, experiencing self and its objects, both internal and external. The perceiver creates a kind of invisible internal image through a mode of abstraction in the process of symbolic think ing. As the schema for relations with an external world, form is the construc tion of this internal invisible image which in turn shapes cognitive and, I would add, affective connections with reality. Understanding poems as aesthetic ob jects provides a way of thinking about form without privileging either "for malist" or free-verse poetry. This is truly to "open the field" of imaginative possibility, to borrow language from Robert Duncan. Discussions of poetic form tend to take one of two directions. On one hand, they focus on varieties of traditional forms, plural, as recent books by Annie Finch and David Caplan attest. For them, sonnets, sestinas, villanelles, and so forth show the continuing vigor and relevance of older verse forms. They try to disengage these forms from the negative connotations that Timothy Steele has amply demonstrated to be associated with the term "verse." On the other hand, other writers refer to "formalism" often as if it were a solid bloaue, a 73</page><page sequence="2">74 Celia Carlson single conceptual entity. For them, "formalism" is usually an aspect of ideal ism and refers to an unreflective belief in some sort of poetic essence. These two approaches are in fact related, as is indicated by Willard Spiegelman's review of Caplan's book Questions of Possibility. Spiegelman re fers to the "so-called 'new formalists/ a self-appointed band of semi-reaction aries who have felt for several decades that only a return to metrical verse will signal a return to poetic essence" (598). I would not imagine that Finch or Steele could be dismissed with such words, but this remark reveals the an tagonism that the question of form can provoke. What is minimally at stake is finding a way to talk about form in poetry without veering either into the empirical accounting for specific forms or into the idealist affirmation (or deni gration) of "poetic essence." What is more largely at stake is finding a means of addressing poetic form as a concept at the heart of modernism and thereby defending the status of poetry as essential cultural work without at the same time mystifying poetry and calling it into disrepute as a debased sentimental ization of modernism. Our current struggles to conceptualize form are deeply rooted in modern ism as a theoretical construct. Form is of great concern to Kant in his account of aesthetic experience, the Critique of Judgment, his Third Critique, published in 1790. But as Rodolphe Gasche reminds us, Kanfs account of aesthetics de rives not from an interest in art, nor from an interest in pre-established forms, but from an interest in nature. Gasche argues very forcefully that at the heart of Kanfs aesthetics is his notion of "mere form." That is, Kant is concerned with the manner in which objects in nature, if they are to be considered beau tiful, present themselves to us as possessing the potentiality for form, for the pleasing unity of the sensory manifold. It is form which provides the univer sality of aesthetic experience. Many have objected to the universality that Kant posits in aesthetic experi ence. The post-Kantian tradition in aesthetics has as one major aim: to qualify ? or even reject ? the universalizing tendency of Kant's aesthetics. But Kant's aesthetics is part of his larger transcendental philosophy, which is concerned with the minimal conditions by which the mind is to make sense of the world at all. That is, Kant's is a metatheory, a philosophy about the very possibility of connections between the mind and the world. His theory of the universality of judgments of taste depends on abstraction in the production of form. Ab straction plays a constitutive role in at least two aspects of Kanfs aesthetic theory, and it underlies the possibility of connection with objects both internal and external. In terms of judgments of the beautiful, abstraction enables the shared feeling that establishes universality based on an ideal. In terms of judg ments of the sublime, abstraction enables the recognition of similarity amid</page><page sequence="3">Poems as Objects: Invisible Images at the Heart of Lyric 75 difference essential to symbolic thinking, and specifically the aesthetic ideas that the mind produces in response to wonder. Before I explain these concepts further, I should give a brief introduction to a couple of key terms in Kanf s theory of aesthetic experience. Central to Kanf s account of aesthetic experience is a process of thinking he calls "aesthetic re flection." For Kant there are two kinds of judgment: determinative and reflec tive. In determinative judgment, the mind encounters a particular and sub sumes it under a universal it has available. In reflective judgment, the mind encounters a particular but has no universal to place it under. It must cast about for a way to categorize this new particular. Aesthetic reflection involves this sort of thinking. When the subject encounters a new aesthetic object, that object cannot immediately be subsumed under available concepts. But it in spires sharable feeling in the case of the beautiful and in the case of the sub lime a respect for reason that nearly raises the imagination to an independent faculty. There are also two types of images ? or quasi-images ? in Kant's thought. These are not external images that we view but internal and integral to the mind's functioning. A representation (Vorstellung) is any mental image, of whatever sort. A presentation (Darstellung) is more foundational yet; it is an apprehension, the pre-cognitive act of synthesis of the manifold, an intuition that unifies the empirical flux and makes it available for a mental representa tion (Vorstellung). Since images are formed as part of the mind's own stance of availability to the world, there is an inherently circular relationship be tween subjects and their objects. Kant tells us in the Analytic of the Beautiful, section ?11: Thus it is the mere form of purposiveness in the representation [Vorstellung] by which an object is given to us, so far as we are conscious of it, wrhich con stitutes the satisfaction that we without a concept judge to be universally communicable; and, consequently, this is the determining ground of the judg ment of taste [of beauty]. (56) Kant stresses that the object is given to us, but since the representation is formed subjectively, it would be fair to say that we give it to ourselves as well, in that form. To return to the issue of abstraction, Kant bases the universality of judg ments of taste in shared feeling, the sensus communis. Tamar Japaridze has ar gued that Kant's Third Critique is foundational to the First and Second Cri tiques, though temporally posterior. In the Third Critique Kant establishes the necessity of aesthetic experience for both subjectivity and community by put ting shared feeling, the sensus communis, at the heart of aesthetic experience. In judgments of taste, according to Kant, one infers the universality of aesthetic</page><page sequence="4">76 Celia Carlson judgments by means of the "feeling of life" that aesthetic objects inspire, and such feeling, because non-utilitarian ? without "interesf' or goal ? charac terizes every human's reaction to the object. It is that disinterested quality of shared feeling that entails both its abstractedness and its sharability. For Japaridze this sensus communis is central in that it places otherness at the core of subjectivity. Her argument is that the self, the subject, is not consti tuted as such until in aesthetic experience it has encountered a form of com munity in the feeling of pleasure in response to an aesthetic object. For Japaridze, such heteronomy is at the heart of Kanfs theory and is an inspiring foundation for a modern art of the self. The abstraction in the sensus communis is not the content of feeling but the fact of a shared human corporeality in which emotions resonate across individual boundaries. As Kant himself says in the Analytic of the Beautiful, section ?22: "In all judgments by which we describe anything as beautiful, we allow no one to be of another opinion, with out, however, grounding our judgment on concepts, but only on our feeling, which we therefore place at its basis, not as a private, but as a common feel ing" (76). Kant goes on to insist that this feeling is not universal as an empiri cal experience but as an ideal It has "exemplary validity"; it is "subjectively universal" (76). As an ideal, this feeling, though rooted in the body, has an abstract quality that makes it sharable. The active role of the mind is both more obvious and more complex in Kanfs account of the sublime. Abstraction in the beautiful is more communal; it is a shared ideal at the level of representation (Vorstellung). In the sublime, abstraction takes place within the individual at the level of the invisible im age, the presentation (Darstellung), in the act of as-if, symbolic linking. In the Analytic of the Sublime, section ?26 on the Mathematically Sublime, Kant tells us: "true sublimity must be sought only in the mind of the [subject] judging, not in the natural object the judgment upon which occasions this state" (95, translator's editorial insertion). He goes on in a section called the "General Remark upon the Exposition of the Aesthetical Reflective Judgment" to define the sublime as follows: "it is an object (of nature) the representation [Vorstellung] of which determines the mind to think the unattainability of nature regarded as a pre sentation [Darstellung] of ideas" (108, Kanfs emphasis). That is, the mind at tempts to construct an impossible image: not only is a presentation the as-if linking at the base of an image, but the image the mind attempts to produce is of unattainability. Kant immediately follows this definition with the acknowledgement: "Literally taken and logically considered, ideas cannot be presented [dargestellt]" (108). Kant congratulates our human nature, though, for being forced, "subjectively, to think nature itself in its totality as a presenta tion of something supersensible, without being able objectwely to arrive at this presentation [Darstellung]" (108, Kanfs emphasis). That is, we cannot con</page><page sequence="5">Poems as Objects: Invisible Images at the Heart of Lyric 77 struct an image of the nature of nature, though it is our human glory to try to do so. That the impossible image Kant calls for in his account of the sublime is an abstraction is clear in the same section when Kant tells us: We need not fear that the feeling of the sublime will lose by so abstract a mode of presentation [Darstellung] ? which is quite negative in respect of what is sensible ? for the imagination, although it finds nothing beyond the sensible to which it can attach itself, yet feels itself unbounded by this re moval of its limitations; and thus that very abstraction is a presentation of the Infinite, which can be nothing but a mere negative presentation [Darstellung], but which yet expands the soul. (115) A "negative presentation" is an invisible image, yet one with great power. And that the impossible image is a form of symbolic, as-if thinking by anal ogy is clear in the final section of Kant's Critique of the Aesthetical Judgment, section ?59, in the Dialectic of the Aesthetical Judgment, where Kant discusses "hypotyposis," a term Gasche tells us Kant drew from the rhetorical tradition and applied to philosophy. Here Kant equates hypotyposis with presentation (Darstellung) as a "sensible illustration." It is with the concept of "symbolical hypotyposis or presentation" that Kant explains that symbolic intuitions con tain indirect presentations (Darstellung) of concepts, working by analogy (197). The judgment joins unalike objects by bringing the "mere rule of the reflec tion" to bear upon a second object, thereby creating of the first a symbol (198). Whereas Gasche derives his argument about the centrality of "mere form" to Kant's aesthetic theory from Kant's account of the beautiful, Kirk Pillow focuses on Kant's account of the sublime. What unites the two aspects of Kant's thought is Kant's emphasis on the indeterminate unity of aesthetic experi ence. For Pillow the sublime parallels metaphor in that it involves the con struction of a network of relations among dissimilar objects (114). Our plea sure, according to Pillow, comes from our recognition of the "affine relations of the manifold." This is an indeterminate unity, one which allows us to see previously unrecognized connections between disparate elements of phenom ena. Pillow argues that in Kant's discussion of aesthetic ideas Kant is really developing a nascent theory of metaphor (95). Like Japaridze, Pillow places the aesthetic before other aspects of Kant's theory in that he sees aesthetic judgments as logically prior to cognitive judgments (121). They carry truth value that others must assent to. Both Gasche and Pillow stress the indeterminacy that Kant insists inhabits aesthetic judgments. Such indeterminacy ensures the pre-cognitive nature of aesthetic experience. But it also underscores the element of abstraction at the heart of the concept of representation in modern thought. What is important,</page><page sequence="6">78 Celia Carlson besides the actual image that results, is the underlying invisible structural "image" comprising the mind's act of recognition of similarity in dissimilar elements. Gasche defines aesthetic form: "form, as an attribute of the object, is the subjective purposiveness of the form of the faculties in the representation of this object" (86). Form for Gasche is the orientation in the mind as it con structs an image (representation, Vorstellung). Form, as I am construing it, is the structural linking (or binding, to use Kanfs term) that takes place at the level of the internal invisible image (presentation, Darstellung). This symbolic thinking involves an active not passive mimesis, the mind's shaping of the world that it finds. Form is a verb not a noun. The point to be stressed here is that in Kanfs account of aesthetic reflection ? the aesthetic response to objects in the world, whether natural or artistic ? the mind's subjective approach to reality is by means of representations, or images, whose genesis is in invisible apprehensions or intuitions ? presenta tions ? underlying them. These invisible images, or presentations, arise through a formal process of symbolic or as-if thinking, thinking by analogy. The objects that become important to human subjects can be found within the mind as forms, not as a simple perceptual process that is ultimately empirical but as the generative shaping activity expressive of the mind's relationship with the world. In aesthetic experience form becomes a kind of internal object. Before turning to specific readings of poems, I would like to give some sense of what is at stake in a discussion of invisible images in modern lyric poetry. In his recent work Toy Medium, Daniel Tiffany declares the "constitu tive role of the image in lyric poetry" (6), agreeing with past theorists of lyric in his interest in the mutability of lyric. When he speaks of the "basic instabil ity of the lyric object" (70), he repeats Daniel Albright's claim that lyric is protean, characterized by metamorphosis. Yet he diverges from the usual view of lyric in his strenuous effort to make lyric useful, to make it purposive by writing it into the heart of materialist discourse, especially science, and by expressing his wish to promote "lyric poetry as a model for materialist criti cism in the humanities" (6). In this effort Tiffany shares Susan Stewart's desire to define poetry as a form of "sensuous knowledge." But by positioning his analysis so firmly within culture studies, with its requirement that he mini mize an aestheticist appreciation of the "purposive purposelessness" of po etry, Tiffany risks losing sight of the specific properties that make lyric a his torical genre. Marjorie Levinson has written very recently an overview of the divide between "new historicism" and "new formalism," between culture stud ies and aestheticism, of the need to avoid dogmatism in either direction, but more importantly of the need to find new ways to talk about form in order to reawake attention to the pleasures and particular knowledge of poetry. My more formalist approach here attempts, precisely by examining carefully the</page><page sequence="7">Poems as Objects: Invisible Images at the Heart of Lyric 79 role of form as invisible image in modern lyric poetry, to offer some insight into the ways in which what is not visible in poetry alerts us to what is very real in both poetry and in the world about us. I want now to provide readings of two poems that specifically address ob jects and to suggest how we might view these poems as objects, particularly how we might understand an invisible image to be at the heart of them. These two free-verse poems in the modernist tradition reveal as well how some tra ditional techniques of prosody can yield insight into the poems' formal qual ities. In the interest of space and given that I am using these readings to sup port a larger theoretical argument, I have dispensed with the usual necessity of placing these poems in their own larger body of scholarship. I will look first at "The Snow Man," by Wallace Stevens, a High Modernist poet, second at "The Fish," by Elizabeth Bishop, a member of the succeeding generation. The two poems seem almost polar opposites in their strategies for treating objects. But they both offer rich insight into the constitutive role of the invisible image in shaping readers' affective relations with the objects they present. Stevens' "The Snow Man" (1923) is simple enough to read but deceptively complex to decipher. Comprising five stanzas of three lines each, it establishes an austere and delicate music, like the wind blowing across the snow that it thematizes. The poem tends to work by an accentual rhythm, varying between two and four beats a line. The first line of the poem begins with four beats and a trochaic rhythm, though the first foot could be heard as either a trochee or a spondee: 6ne must I have a I mind 6f I winter!.] This aural pattern is the trochaic tetrameter of song meters, and it establishes the musicality of the poem from the start. The discursive and rhetorical authority of "one must," however, works against the musicality of the poem, setting music and discursive authority in tension with each other. The second line shifts down to three beats and rhythmically into variations on iambic rhythms (iambs and anapests): T6 tegard I the frdst I and thS boughs[.] In general Stevens plays rising rhythms against falling rhythms to establish variety. Here follows a suggested scansion of the poem, one that attempts to show shapes of sound patterns rather than identify the "real feet" that Stevens might or might not have intended. I use traditional scansion marks for the sake of convenience: One must I haVea I mind 6i I winter 16 rSgdrd I th? frost I and the" boughs Of th? pine-trees I crusted I with snow; And have been cold I 3 long time T6 behold I th? jun I IpSrs shagged I with ice, The spni I ces rough I in the dis I tant glitter</page><page sequence="8">80 Celia Carlson Of the Jan I uarysiin; I and not I td think Of anj I misery I in thS sound I 6f the wind, In thS sound I 6f a few leaves, Which is the sound I of the land Full 6f I th? same wind That is blow I ing in thS same I bare place F6r the lis I tenSr, whd lis I tSns in I the snow, And,n6t I hing himself, I beh61ds Nothing I that is not there I andthSnot I hing th?t is. (Collected Poems 9) Stevens' poem overtly thematizes the binary distinction between nothing and something. The poem tackles an abstraction. And yet it is filled with a delicate melancholy music. Stevens achieves this music by briefly invoking the English metrical tradition; by employing juxtaposed runs of rising and falling rhythms; and by using abstract language, which creates tension between musicality and the demand for conceptualization. In a lecture given at Harvard in 1936, called "The Irrational Element in Poetry," Stevens said: If it is true that the most abstract painters paint herrings and apples, it is no less true that the poets who most urgently search the world for the sanctions of life, for that which makes life so prodigiously worth living, may find their solutions in a duck in a pond or in the wind on a winter night. It is conceiv able that a poet may arise of such scope that he can set the abstraction on which so much depends to music. (Opus 228) It is Stevens' own emphasis on the lyric connection between abstraction and music that I want to call attention to here. We will notice the large number of unstressed syllables, somewhat as in Hopkins' sprung rhythms, with phrases like "mfsSry in th? sound 6f th? wind," "January sun," and "bl6wing in th? sdme bare pl3ce" ? even perhaps "listener, wh6 listens in the snow." These lengthy runs of unstressed syllables mimetically offer the sense of the desolate landscape with the thin cold wind blowing over the cold snow. Moreover, when Stevens addresses emotion, the "misery in the sound of the wind," the new few lines shift down to two "feet" per line, to allow the feeling of desolation to saturate the sounds. We are invited to connect the idea of the sound of wind to the feeling of misery. Stevens even repeats the word "sound" and rhymes it with land and wind, again to saturate the poem with sound and underscore its austere music. Though his language is musical, sensory, Stevens' language even more seeks authority through abstraction. Four of the fifteen lines of this poem end in some variation of a spondee: "a long time," "a few leaves," "the same wind," and most emphatically of all: "the same bare place." Stevens uses these spondees to indicate deixis, to draw our attention to concrete details in the</page><page sequence="9">Poems as Objects: Invisible Images at the Heart of Lyric 81 virtual "here and now" he is offering: "a few leaves." But he also uses the spondees to reinforce abstraction: "a long time" and "the same bare place." It is this, abstraction in the here and now, that Stevens is after. Notice the au thoritative statement Stevens opens with: "One must have," and the authori tative statement he closes with: "the nothing that is." Though Stevens invokes sound in this poem, his verbs are largely ones of sight: "to regard," "to be hold." And Stevens prefers infinitives to conjugated action verbs. The action of the wind "blowing" is belied by the stasis of the poem. There is another sense left to consider. Tiffany says that the snowman, as nothing, shows that "the real is composed of the unreal" (119) and that the weather for Stevens represents a "bestiary of elemental creatures" (120). No tice, though, that the paradox of is and is not, the synesthesia of a "listener" "beholding," points to a sense entirely elided in the poem: touch. "Behold" Stevens says twice. But a snowman has no hands. The absence made palpable in the poem's abstractions is an entirely human one. While the snowman can hear the assonance in the vowels shifting from boughs/snow, pine/time/ice, distant/ glitter, sound /land /wind, cold /snow /behold, and it can hear the delicate rhyming in mind /winter, bare/listener, and it can hear the sibilants and fricatives in "junipers shagged with ice" and "spruces rough in the dis tant glitter," it cannot touch another. This is a loss, however, that causes no pain. The final stanza opens with the word "for" and seems to pivot ? but then doesn't. "For" turns out to be a preposition. The poem remains one sentence long. But "for" at the beginning of the stanza, in such a strong position, promises to be a coordinating conjunc tion starting a new clause: for the listener... does what? changes? as in Rilke's "Archaic Torso of Apollo," which demands: "Du muB dein Leben andern" [you must change your life]. But Stevens' snowman remains without an ob ject, sans volition, remains ... nothing ... but himself the object of a preposi tion. So while the snowman is an object for us in the poem, an object inseparable from an image, the poem itself is an object that provides an experience that we can internalize and then relinquish, in which we experience what it is like to have no objects ? that is, to be utterly lonely. For the greatest loss is the loss of objects altogether. And while William Carlos Williams in "Danse Russe" might dance nakedly and grotesquely in front of his mirror thinking about the sleep ing servant girl and singing about how it's best that he remain lonely ? and be quite right about that ? Stevens is giving us the experience through this aesthetic object of what it is like to be a cold white man whose loneliness does not cause him suffering.</page><page sequence="10">82 Celia Carlson In contrast, Elizabeth Bishop's poem "The Fish" (1946) is very frank and observational about the object that fills it, the eponymous fish. Bishop's poem is narrative ? simple and sentimental. Bishop pushes hard against sentimen tality, however, by using very short lines ? two and three beats, even only one beat, as in "and infested" ? and by focusing on description of the fish. The poem is a simple narrative, essentially bifurcated: "I caught a tremendous fish" ... "and then I saw" ... "And I let the fish go." The two halves are filled with description of the fish. But though the poem seems entirely about an object, it is suffused with the poet's subjectivity, which works throughout to incorporate the fish into a human imaginative. Bishop anthropomorphizes the fish, calling it "he" throughout, even as she acknowledges its separateness from her: "I looked into his eyes / . . . They shifted a little, but not / to return my stare. / ? It was more like the tipping / of an object toward the light." Bishop tries to acknowledge its otherness by describing the barnacles, lime, and sea-lice on its skin, but she does not stop at its surface. She gazes deep into its body with authority, like an anatomist or chef, knowing just how to dissect or filet it: I thought of the coarse white flesh packed in like feathers, the big bones and the little bones, the dramatic reds and blacks of his shiny entrails, and the pink swim-bladder like a big peony. {Complete Poems 42) Her knowledge of the fish, extending deep into its interior, able to compare and assess through similes ? "like feathers," "like a big peony" ? goes be yond the knowledge the fish has of itself. And it is not itsfishness that attracts her. Rather, it is the human narrative of endurance that she is able to construct for it. It is human subjectivity to which Bishop responds. What she sees in the fish is an aging male warrior, worthy of honor. She describes the fish's ability to attract her sympathy in anthropomorphic ? and gendered ? terms: "I ad mired his sullen face, / the mechanism of his jaw"; "a five-haired beard of wisdom / trailing from his aching jaw[.]" The sense of sight dominates this poem: her physical sight of the fish externally, but also her sight into it and her insight that perceives its value. Her sympathy ? "the terrible oxygen" ? comes from this male objecf s capacity to be visually domesticated: "his brown skin hung in strips / like ancient wallpaper[.]" The poem is filled with adjectives based on human labor; the fish is "battered and venerable / and homely"; the fishing lines in the fish's lip are "grim, wet, and weaponlike"; the fish's irises are "backed and packed / with tarnished tinfoil[.]" The adjectives become</page><page sequence="11">Poems as Objects: Invisible Images at the Heart of Lyric 83 teleological, since the object is so utterly knowable in human terms. Bishop describes to us the lines hanging from the fish's mouth: "A green line, frayed at the end / where he broke it, two heavier lines, / and a fine black thread / still crimped from the strain and snap / when it broke and he got away." So confident is Bishop in her ability to capture and domesticate this object, and overcome its otherness, that the poem resolutely rejects musicality, em bracing prose. The object is far too seeable, knowable. From the fish Bishop turns her attention to human constructs: oil, an engine, a bailer, the gunwales, everything rusted by the air or cracked by the sun, but human. We get our invisible image when the fish disappears entirely. It is no longer needed, so thoroughly has it been incorporated into a human vision. This small still life of supremely confident human objects is washed with a final glaze of "rain bow, rainbow, rainbow." Bishop scarcely needs verbs. The poem's ecstatic moment uses the verb "be." The final line of the poem, "And I let the fish go," is the gesture of utter containment and control of the fish, which is no longer necessary to the poem or to the poet's sense of visual command of the world. The invisible image is precisely the poet's visual command of her ordinary world, expressed as repetition. Although Bishop's poem has been resolutely "unpoetic" so far, it ends on a note of sentimental victory: I stared and stared and victory filled up the little rented boat, from the pool of bilge where oil had spread a rainbow around the rusted engine to the bailer rusted orange, the sun-cracked thwarts, the oarlocks on their strings, the gunnels ? until everything was rainbow, rainbow, rainbow! And I let the fish go. {Complete Poems 42) This rainbow is not Marianne Moore's "blue-red-yellow band / of incandes cence" in "In the Days of Prismatic Colour," a thing of originary purity. Bishop's speaker stares at all the common, ordinary things, warped and cracked like human skin by time and the elements. She repeats: stared and stared; she re peats: rainbow, rainbow, rainbow. Though Stevens' is clearly the more sophisticated poem, Bishop employs repetition as a signifier and rhythmic conveyer of rapture to raise the prosaic world offered in her vision to a new level. The repetition indicates that the aural properties of the poem, even at the most rudimentary level, overtake the visual. Bishop begins to suggest rhyme: up/boat, engine/orange, strings/thing,</page><page sequence="12">84 Celia Carlson rainbow /go. And she ends on a spondaic rhythm: "the fish go." Insofar as repetition establishes rhythm in poetry, it appears that Bishop turns to the rudiments of "poetry" at the end to establish the value and victory of the en counter. Sight itself, and with it sentimentality, dissolves. The final line "And I let the fish go" is a commanding ending, because in the self-same gesture she lets the poem "The Fish" go as well. It is the fish's complete absence that un derwrites her complete authority ? over poetry and over the masculine world she imaginatively inhabits. Her creative object is now replete with her author ity. The poetry of both Stevens and Bishop indicates ways in which modernist poetry and poetry in the modernist lineage struggle to respond to things. Each of these poems presents a subjective experience rooted in a situation of thingness: a snowman, a fish. Each presents a different perspective on inter nalizing the object ? or not. In Stevens there is no object, and the point is he does not miss it; in Bishop the object disappears, but the point is its absence establishes her poetic control. The irony of modernism is that its objects dis appear even as it seeks to embed itself in them. If one wishes to accept the narrative that Bishop is part of a transition to postmodern poetry, then it ap pears that the wish of postmodernism to begin again ? a wish the modernists held before it ? entails grappling once more with the problem of form. The heritage of modernism is the paradoxical recognition that to begin again in things one must first construct them. The object is given breath by the invis ible image that shapes it at its very heart. Works Cited Albright, Daniel. Lyricality in English Literature. Lincoln, NE: U of Nebraska P, 1985.
