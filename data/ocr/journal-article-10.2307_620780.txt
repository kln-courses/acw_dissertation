<plain_text><page sequence="1">PAUL SANDER: Zwischen Charisma und Ratio.: Entwicklungen in der friihen imamitischen Theologie. (Islam- kundliche Untersuchungen, Bd. 183.) 229 pp. Berlin: Klaus Schwarz Verlag, 1994. This book, based on a Dissertation at the University of G6ttingen in 1992, is a study of Imami theology from the second half of the third/ninth century to the early fifth/eleventh. In it, Sander questions some of the findings and views of Western scholarship (mainly Watt, Madelung and McDermott) on the develop- ment of Imami theology and, in particular, the assimilation of Mu'tazili doctrines. Earlier studies have relied on non-Imami authors (e.g. Khayyatt and Ash'ari) whose portrayal of the theological schools and doctrines of the Imamiyya in their time does not always accord with the evidence found in the hadith collections of Barqi (d. 274 or 280 A.H.) and Kulini (d. 329 A.H.). Sander's central argument is that the widely accepted view that Imami theology underwent a radical change at the hands of Mufid (d. 415 A.H.) by his taking over of Mu'tazili doctrines is not tenable. Traditionalist Imami theology, as represented in the hadith collections of the earlier scholars Barqi and Kulini, is shown to have been already imbued with Mu'tazili concepts, and to have exerted a greater influence on the thought of Mufid than has hitherto been recognized. Moreover, in the primacy that it accorded to the Quran and haadith, Imami theology, including that of Mufid, is shown to have been closer to Sunni than to Mu'tazili theology. Where Mufid differed from his Imami predecessors, it is in his overt admission of qiyas and kalhm as valid methods of reasoning in defending Imami doctrines and in the critical evaluation of traditions. In that, he came close to the position of the Sunni Ash'ari, and remained opposed to the Mu'tazili view that reason is the main basis of theological know- ledge. Otherwise, most of the essential elements of Imami theology as elaborated by Mufid are already found in Barqi's collection. Sander argues that one cannot maintain that Imami theology developed from a predeterminist to an anti-predeterminist stance. He points to the contradictory statements on this subject in hadith and shows how Ibn Babuya and Mufid merely developed further those traditions which are close to Mu' tazili doctrine, and attempted to divest other traditions of their deterministic character. The work is divided into two main parts which deal with, respectively, the theological positions of the Sunna and the Mu'tazila, represented (mainly) by Ash'ari and 'Abd al-Jabbar, and those of the Imamiyya, repres- ented by Mufid, Ibn Babuiya, Barqi and Kulini. The constituent sections are organized accord- ing to the following theological themes: the Imamate, God and the Quran (i.e. the question of Divine Attributes), God's Justice and Goodness, men's acts and predestination, belief, and the means of theological knowledge. The findings are brought together in the conclusion where comparisons are made with the doctrines of the Sunna and the Mu'tazila, and the areas of continuity and development between Barqi and Mufid are discussed. Insofar as Sander's thesis is concerned with the development of Imami theology in the period outlined in his work, his arguments are broadly convincing and well thought out. His examination of the hadith collections, which he rightly regards as more reliable sources and as affording a clearer view of Imami thought in that period than the works of contemporary non-Imami heresiographers and polemicists, fills an important gap in our knowledge of the subject. It also shows that the incorporation of Mu'tazili concepts by early post-ghayba Imamism was not restricted to minority groups (such as the Banii Nawbakht) and did not necessarily encounter the kind of outright opposition by traditionalists suggested by Madelung. One minor criticism concerns Sander's atti- tude to the value of non-Imami sources for forming a picture of Imami theology prior to the composition of Barqi's work. (This is expressed in the introduction where he ques- tions the feasibility of coming to any definite conclusions about the nature of early Imami theology on the basis of biased sources.) In the absence of contemporary Imami sources, our knowledge of pre-ghayba Imami theology remains to a large extent dependent on works such as Ash'ari's and Khayyat's. The informa- tion given by these authors cannot always be dismissed as biased; Imami sources often cor- roborate that information (as, for example, in the case of the anthropomorphism of Hisham b. al-Hakam and Hisham b. Salim). Sander's own findings about the theology of the hadith collections would also tend to confirm some of the statements of Khayyat and Ash'ari about the theological doctrines of pre-ghayba Imamism. The existence of incon- sistencies and contradictory hadfths on a number of theological topics, which Sander points to and discusses in the relevant sections, may be viewed as confirming, rather than as disproving, the statements of the heresio- graphers about the existence of two oppos- ing trends and divergent opinions in early Imamism, although one might question</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 129 Khayyat's suggestion that the 'Mu'tazilite- inclined' trend in his time was represented by a minority, or that the introduction of Mu' tazila concepts was a new phenomenon in the second half of the third century. Sander's inclination, as far as I am able to make out, is to regard the contradictions as inherent in the theological systems of Barqi and Kulini, and not as engendered by a departure from, or a modifica- tion of, a previously more predestinarian theo- logy, or as a reflection of the divergences which our sources attribute to pre-ghayba Imami theologians. This point, however, does not affect the validity of Sander's main argument concerning the line of development from Barqi to Mufid, and should not detract from the overall importance of his study.
