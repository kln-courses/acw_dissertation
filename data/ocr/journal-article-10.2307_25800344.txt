Coates asserted that Smith's "new show has a special interest... in that it illustrates?with an at times almost painful clarity?the effect of the war on the artists of his genera tion. Smith, I think, was more affected by the war than most."2 The critic noted that the "frenzy" of "raw violence" and the "horror" of the war had found suitable material expression in some of the sculptures, notably War Spectre and False Peace Spectre. He also admitted that the result was "curiously disturbing to witness." Coates was not alone in registering the challenge of these sculptures. Harold Clurman, writing for the magazine Tomorrow, wasted no time in addressing the war: "This young American sculptor has put the nervousness, conflict, horror of our day into forms that seem to fly."3 Impressed as he was by the evidence of Smith s output and skiltrClurman ulti mately left the exhibition troubled by its expressive content. He found that those sculptures conceived to "convey painful ideas" were "very disturbing" because they had "real violence" that hit viewers like "a high-voltage shock." An investigation of the content and reception of the two Spectres specifically mentioned by Coates constitutes the focus of this essay, and serves as the mate rial evidence anchoring my argument: when considering Smith's antiwar art, we must remember that wedded to his well-known allegiance to radical politics was an equally strong interest in cultural regression that ultimately implicated all nations and all individuals, including himself, in a will to destruction.4 Previous scholarship on Smith's antiwar art, especially that of Paula Wisotzki and Rosalind Krauss, has emphasized primarily two things, respectively: his leftist politics as they developed in the 1930s, evident in his series of fifteen medallions The Medals for Dishonor (1938-40) or in such anti-imperialist statements as Perfidious Albion (1944-45), and his personal experience with and apparent attraction to violence that found outlet in his depictions of rape, including The Rape (1944-45) and War landscape (1944-45).s This study is indebted to both approaches, but differs in insisting that the antiwar art also needs to be situated within a broader visual and intellectual field. The two Spectres were conceived in an environment saturated in war propa ganda, advertising, and reportage. To understand Smith's sometimes flagrant imagery and grotesque stylization, it is necessary to turn to the actual years the United States was in the war. Evidence preserved in his sketchbooks indicates that he constantly surveyed mainstream and leftist media for ideas and informa tion while remaining open to inspiration from contemporaneous and historical works of art. His well-known interest in the material of steel, used in both sculp tures, was informed to some extent by radical criticism of Western imperialism, and his infatuation with regression?the idea that humanity devolves when civi lization fails to advance?was most likely shaped by Sigmund Freud's writings on instinct. Approaching War Spectre and False Peace Spectre through the media and visual culture of the war, leftist cultural criticism, and psychoanalytic theory helps to frame Smith not only as a modernist experimenting with materials and form and as a surrealist working out of his unconscious, but also?and just as This essay is part of a broader study documenting American artists' opposition to war beginning with the founding of the American Artists' Congress in 1935.

Cast in bronze and smaller than the other two, this work is less obviously tied to the war and instead seems to allude to the universal theme of perfidy, which Smith had already introduced in Medals for Dishonor: Propaganda for War. 5.

Finally, by framing this essay with the sculptures' critical reception, from 1946 and later, it will become evident that they provided several individuals with the opportunity to discuss the devastation of modern war, thus engaging and amplifying the public commentary com menced by the sculptor. The Sculptor as Moral Force Given that each sculpture was first exhibited in January of 1946, it is appropriate to begin with that moment, especially as Smith and his dealer Marian Willard were acutely conscious of his work's presentation and explication. In his essay for the exhibition catalogue, W R. Valentiner, the director of the Detroit Institute of the Arts, emphasized the challenge of opposing military violence while one's country was engaged in global conflict: "Why should not the artist, with his deep insight, stress human values, especially in times when political propaganda emphasizes the opposite? Only the artist who stands in the midst of life and participates in the struggle that concerns us all can become a moral force, as in former ages when sculpture was an important influence upon the development of ethics."6 Additionally, Valentiner drew attention to themes that revealed the sculptor's response to war. Some of the work suggested "human figures in the first stage of development out of earthy forms." Yet as much as Smith was look ing backward to explain the recent devastation, he was also responding to "the demands of [his] own epoch. ..." Of the two Spectres Valentiner noted the "expression of speed in a single direction."7 He described the former as "a spectre that haunts us yet?a headless monster composed of steel and weapons, rushing along with passionate fury," while the latter he categorized as "a strange creature, once beautiful, but now, with torn-out feathers, fallen to ugliness." Whether encountered via the photographs shot by Smith, one of which was reproduced in the catalogue, or in the environment of gallery or museum dis play, the two sculptures suggest rapid motion through space. One Spectre runs through the terrain; the other has taken flight. Produced in the studio at Bolton Landing, the Spectres captured on film appear against the natural landscape of upstate New York. Through much of his career this was Smith's common prac tice, the effect of which was to suggest that his sculptures were conceived, at least partially, in relation to nature. Though alluding to events overseas that Smith and most Americans knew indirectly though newspapers, magazines, and news reels, the presence in the United States of the Spectres was a means of picturing the fury of war inside the borders of his homeland. Thus the photographs served as a reminder that the conflict was embedded not only within Smith's experience and imagination, as Coates argued, but also within the nation's, especially its massively orchestrated efforts to rally popular support for the war. If the devasta tion of the conflict lay elsewhere, its spirit and intensity were disturbingly close. For instance, speed was a common theme in reporting and advertising. It commenced with the stunned reports of Nazi advances in Eastern Europe in the late summer of 1939, and remained a constant refrain as the Allies pushed toward Berlin and island-hopped through the Pacific on the way to Japan. Popular depictions of the war in magazines such as Life and Time often resorted to direc 6. W. R. Valentiner, "David Smith," in The Sculpture of David Smith, exh. cat.

Rubenstein have noted that images like that of Roosevelt in the advertisement were ubiquitous during the war: "Tacked up on bulletin boards, next to time clocks, on factory walls, and in break rooms, these posters served as a constant reminder of the war and the need to increase production."8 In a triumphant though exhortative mood, Life reported in 1943 that the United States was producing more steel than the rest of the world combined, nearly 2^9 million tons over the preceding three years. With justification, the magazine could boast that "anyone who travels across the U.S. these days cannot help but thrill to the mighty spectacle of American indus try at war."9 By early January 194s, the annual capacity was 95.$ million tons, a 33 percent increase since 1940.'? Some of this was earmarked for the production of tanks, which by war's end numbered almost ninety thousand; some went into the making of trains, vitally needed to speed weapons and other products to the nation's ports for shipment to the European and Pacific theaters of opera tion; some went into the approximately two hundred thousand pieces of artil lery; and some went into the nearly nine thousand naval vessels constructed during the war." 8.

He spent nearly two years (1942 to 1944) on the graveyard shift (11:30PM to 7:30AM) welding trains, tanks, and tank destroyers at the American Loco motive Company (ALCO) plant in Schenectady, New York. He did this, no doubt, within viewing distance of propaganda posters urging him and fellow work ers?in some of the popular slogans of the period?to be "production soldiers" and to "work to win."12 The M4, or Sherman, tanks he helped weld were designed for quick manufacture and featured in battles from 1942 through the spring of 194^.Though excused from service in 1943 due to a sinus condition, Smith was, like so many men and women of his generation, putting his ardent antifascist politics to work in an industry vital to the defeat of the Axis powers. It is important to recognize, however, that laboring within the war industry was not synonymous with making modern art; one necessitated speed and simplicity, the other contemplation and complexity. As much as the two Spectres communicate some sense of war's propulsion, they are also deeply critical of it. Unlike the various maps and images of the US advance, the sculptures hardly partake of propaganda's simplifications. Close analysis of the sculptures reveals their intentional ambiguity. Because they can be viewed from either side, their direction remains uncertain. They may be racing toward victory, or attempting to avoid defeat. Their clear lack of iconographic and symbolic specificity?note that neither bears an iron cross or swastika?may even intimate that in pursuing its stated goal of unconditional Axis surrender, the Allied powers were perhaps little different from the fascists they sought to vanquish. Further distancing War Spectre and False Peace Spectre from war propaganda is the absence of text. The running soldiers in the recruiting advertisement are framed with simple, declarative prose presented in bold type. "First-Class Fighting Man" introduces the theme. "U.S. Army Recruiting Service" anchors the entire message. Its delivery is quick and succinct. Muriel Rukeyser, the leftist poet and labor activist, noted in her review of war posters and advertising in The New Republic that image and text had to be united effectively in order for propaganda to communicate war aims clearly.13 A survey of major American magazines, including Life, reveals the pervasiveness of such advertising and provides a reminder that highly crafted visual and verbal information attempted to picture and foster national consensus about the war. Although Smith initially opposed US entry into the war, as did many others on the Left, he asserted that he was not a pacifist. His first wife, Dorothy Dehner, reiterated this point when she emphasized his support for the Loyalists in Spain, the revolutionaries in China, and the Allies in Europe. Of the latter conflict, she wrote that "he deplored it, blaming the imperialist powers for getting the world into period holocausts."14 Instead, it is important to note that Smith s antifascist and antiwar position was shared by many other artists who joined the American Artists' Congress (AAC) in 193^, and that their stance was reinforced by the activities and art of Pablo Picasso during the Spanish civil war (1936 to 1939). It is common knowledge that the Spaniard was an important frame of refer ence for the American. The etchings Dreams and Lies of Franco (1937), like the mural Guernica (1937), were known first hand in New York through AAC-sponsored exhibitions and Picasso: Forty Years of His Art (1939) at the Museum of Modern Art. Both prints and mural were reproduced in the catalogue; Guernica remained at the museum until 1981. Another work included in the 1939 exhibition and catalogue, 12. ALCO described its workers as production soldiers on the cover of the May 1943 issue of the corporation's newspaper, Attack. Smith retained a copy of this issue, now in the archives of the Estate of David Smith, New York. 13. Muriel Rukeyser, "Words and Images," New Republic 109 (August 2, 1943): 140-41. 14.

The creature's missing torso precedes the similar organization of War Spectre, as does the grotesquerie of a nonhuman head surmounting a pair of run ning legs. The irregular shape of the combined triangle-rectangle that serves as a foil for the outlined head of the Minotaur even seems to anticipate the similar shape of the gun sight atop the running Spectre. Each work clearly links humanity's two-legged gait, and its symbolic transcendence of animal locomotion, with the predatory combat of hunter and hunted in the natural world. The difference is that Smith transformed the Minotaur, the product of human and animal coupling, into a cyborg killing machine. A reviewer in Artnews aptly described War Spectre as "an armed figure in furi ous pursuit."15 Made up only of legs and arms, the figure lacks a torso, home of heart and emotion. Its head is replaced by the front sight and muzzle of a gun, the barrel in turn having the density and pointed end of a bayonet. Without the butt, stock, grip, trigger, and forearm of an assault weapon, however, the gun cannot be controlled or even fired. In this regard the sculpture actually functions as a spectre: a ghost or apparition that induces fear, terror, and dread. With one hand the Spectre holds a lance between its legs, the oblong form less a phallus and more a witch's broomstick. In the other hand it holds a cannon with vestigial limbs. In describing the sculpture for the exhibition's press release, Smith was terse: "Modern and Medieval mechanical forms."'6 The recurrent motif of the cannon actually bridges the medieval and mod ern worlds. Ostensibly an agent of destruction, the weapon is sometimes an object of aesthetic contemplation for Smith, if only in his sketchbook. Here the careful rendition of tube and carriage in profile view reveals an antiquarian interest in the shapes of the cannons, as though Smith were studying from a 15.

This level of historical curiosity would not be sustained in his subsequent drawings and sculptures. In Propaganda for War from the Medals for Dishonor, the cannon signifies male violence against women, who, in turn, sym bolize victimized civilization. With its phallic outline, the cannon is rendered disturbingly anthropomorphic. Its wrinkled surface suggests the folds of loose foreskin covering the glans of an uncircumcised penis, while the semierect pos ture intimates either a pre- or postcoital moment. Of course the cannon is not really a penis. Its size, physical posture, and legs indicate that it is a surrogate for men reduced to their hostile, instinctual selves. Although several of his drawings and sculptures from the years 1940 to 1945 took the cannon/phallus motif as the dominant form and idea, in War Spectre the canon is carried in one hand, much reduced in size and presence, as though Smith had come to realize two things: first, that like masculinity itself, phallic power was also phallic vulnerability due to the threat of castration; and, second, that the destructive fury of instinct only used the penis as one of its weapons, that the phallus itself was under the control of a much deeper drive. If the weaponry made War Spectre modern, so too did the choice of steel, because of its topical associations with United States power and with its success ful prosecution of the war. Clurman linked the material of steel with American industry, noting that its "lightness and power" were suitable for Smith's interests in "sharpness, explosiveness and harshness."17 In 19^1 Smith proclaimed: "Possibly steel is so beautiful because of all the movement associated with it, its strength and function. Yet it is also brutal, the rapist, the murderer, and death-dealing giants are also its offspring. ... In my Spectre series, I speak of these things. . . ."l8 His insistence that steel was both beautiful and ugly, a sign of civilization and an agent of its destruction, came in the aftermath of the world's most devastating war, one in which the metal played a decisive role. In its postwar summary of United States production, the International Business Machines Corporation argued that "no single product was put to more universal or diversified use in the war than steel, the basic product of the entire war effort."'9 Among those products were needles and bullets, ambulances and tanks, armor and battleships, some designed to protect and preserve human life, others to annihilate it. To perceive steel as emblematic of the United States and as resting precari ously on the cusp separating civilization and barbarism reveals Smith's debts to well-known arguments concerning technology in the 1930s. These were argu ments with which he was certainly familiar, as they were linked with the cultural activism of the Left. In the Epic of American Civilization (1932-34), his fresco cycle at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, the noted Mexican artist Jose Clemente Orozco articulated what would be a running theme in his murals for the next ten years, namely the constructive and destructive potential of technol ogy. In the contiguous scenes, Cortez and the Cross and The Machine, the dense thickets of machinery rendered in dull shades of gray made it clear that the conquest of the Americas was achieved with superior arms. In his notes published on the occasion of the mural's unveiling, Orozco was careful to stress the Americanness of the subject and visual form.20 To be sure, by this he indicated not only the United States, but also the entire land mass of the New World colonized by Europe. The theme of technology as a Pandora's box linked Orozco's mural with Lewis Mumford's polemical history Technics and Civilization (1934), a book that had 17. Clurman, 63. 18.

Through out, Mumford tracked the interconnections between ever more lethal weapons and the advance of a Western culture that needed war to guarantee colonial and capital expansion. "The machine itself," he asserted, "is a product of human ingenuity and effort: hence to understand the machine is ... a means toward understanding society and toward knowing ourselves."2' Tools of war and their materials were objects of highly developed craft, a reminder that "mining and refining and smithing invoke, by the nature of the material dealt with, the ruth lessness of modern warfare: they place a premium on brute force."22 Scathing in his indictment of war, Mumford also reasoned that advances in technology enabled humanity to return to precivilized patterns of behavior. "War . . . unleashes the brute forces of their [humans'] own nature," he insisted, "releases the nor mal restraints of social life, and sanctions a return to the primitive in thought and feeling. . . . Savagery, which we have associated with the not-yet-civilized, is equally a reversionary mode that arises with the mechanically over-civilized."23 Taken together, Orozco's mural and Mumford's study offered a troubled inter pretation of both the rise of American industrial civilization and its predilection, even need, for war. Though War Spectre betrays no overt visual debt to either example, it nonetheless takes its place within this larger intellectual terrain, as does the False Peace Spectre. Like War Spectre, False Peace Spectre is a bizarre combination of parts, some ani mate, others mechanical. It can be likened to an airplane, a bird of prey, and a phallus, interchangeable agents of destruction in Smith's antiwar lexicon. Across the body of the Spectre is evidence of distress. If a plane, its wings are warped and its fuselage tattered. If a bird, it has lost most of its feathers. And if a phallus, its foreskin has been ripped apart to trail its head like the ass's ears and bells of a jester's costume, the effect introducing a strong element of black humor to the sculpture. The legs are too muscular to be avian, and what should be talons resemble hoofs. This final detail would suggest a modern Pegasus. 21.

The pun had been given widespread commercial form in a series of advertisements for Mobilgas in Collier's, Life, and the Saturday Evening Post. In it, American fighters or bombers appear with Pegasus, the oil conglomerate's corporate logo. The intended implication was that national industry, regardless of its wartime profits, was a force of good contributing to the battle against evil. Such is not the case with False Peace Spectre. In its organization False Peace Spectre reveals different information from one side to the other. On its right side appears a small fetal figure resembling an embryonic bird, its presence suggesting the imminent arrival of a future genera tion of spectres. The head emerges from a pocket or pouch, intimating a womb, which would make the creature female. On its left side, the interior of the body is revealed through the steel mesh. Inside is a winged phallus that one critic described as an "aerial bomb."24 The mesh is organized in the form of a scrotal sack, the tiny phallus then presented as the seed of the rampant bird. Thus the Spectre is both male and female, the wedding of opposites underlining its status as a grotesque. Though apparently blind, False Peace Spectre extends an offering on a platter. A mandolin and a kneeling female nude ostensibly suggest the peaceful pursuits 24.

A musical instrument and a female nude also appear in Propaganda for War, but as Smith had indicated in his notes concerning that particular medal, the dulcet sounds of music might give way to "shrieks and emotional bombings," and the pleasure of sexual union might be a seduction into war hysteria because the nude "helps by what she is most able."25This seems to be the case five years later.The mandolin has wheels and legs attached to its underbelly, while its strings are in disarray, the effect most easily seen in a study at the Fogg Art Museum. When the sculpture is viewed from underneath, the instrument's shape is that of the cannon/phallus, and thus the structure is actually a weapon camouflaged in the trappings of cul ture. In turn, the female nude is herself a monster. Her head resembles the bent snout of a cannon, one arm ends in a club, and her breasts are withered. A hag, she is only seductive from a distance. Like the spectre carrying her and the man dolin/ cannon around which she has draped one arm, she too aggressively rends space. The figures offered on the tray are cast in bronze, a traditional material for sculpture, but their forms connote the ease with which peaceful pursuits can be turned to destruction. Because the work is weighted down with offerings and ordnance, it functions as an aerial Trojan horse for an age easily and disastrously fooled by the promises of fascism. Smith described False Peace Spectre succinctly: "a blue bastard with bronze music cannon and bronze female offering on a tray."26 Produced in the weeks after the surrender of Germany, the sculpture was informed by media accounts and personal stories about American GIs encoun tering German civilians.27 A clipping in Smith's sketchbook recounts the diffi culty confronting American soldiers trained to kill Nazis who suddenly find themselves welcomed as occupiers and peacekeepers in defeated Germany. One soldier who cannot so easily forget the recent past confesses, "I even want to shoot all the pregnant women because I know that what's in their bellies will someday be shooting at my children."28 In a letter to his friend Edgar Levy, Smith remarked: "I've talked to some pfharts who have returned from Germany. They are full of good German people stuff?it isn't their fault?they were led wrong . . . the German women treated us the best of anyplace?and all that bull?of course they are jerks but a false peace can be the result. In my show I have a false-peace spectre?and a war spectre also."29 These narratives, one excerpted from a lengthy essay in Life about a shattered Germany, the other based on conversations with returning veterans, shaped Smith's fear that fascism was not so easily defeated. Like War Spectre, False Peace Spectre works against an uncomplicated triumpha lism and stands in opposition to the simplifications of mass communication. Its wings are largely stripped of feathers, and thus evoke any number of World War II planes, Allied or Axis. Its blue color was identified with the air forces of Germany, England, and the United States, although mostly the latter in sources available to Smith, and thus disturbingly suggests a link among presumptive world powers. Underneath the wings, the blue color gives way to orange, the color often associated in Western thought with transcendence and heaven sup planted by that of conflagration. Finally, its overall form can be perceived as an avian predator, perhaps an eagle, symbolic of imperial aggression. Nearly a generation ago, the art historian Karen Wilkin asserted that the sculp ture was in fact targeting the United States, an assertion subsequently reiterated 25.

Furthermore, the eagle was hardly the sole property of the United States. As a symbol it had ancient roots. Contemporaneously, the Nazis often coupled the eagle with the swastika in their heraldry. Still, the equation of the war effort with the American eagle was com mon between 1939 and 1945. Visual culture kept the bird firmly in the publics sight. For instance, a poster designed by Tom Woodburn in 1939 for the US Army Air Corps linked planes with a screaming eagle, its talons extended like landing gear, its wings marked with the insignia of a red, white, and blue star. Surmounted by the text "wings over America," the poster's intended effect was to posit an elite formation of 30. Karen Wilkin, David Smith: The Formative Years, exh. cat.

The general configuration of an eagle with some material in its talons dated to the 1780s, as a photo essay in Life made clear in the summer of 1944.31 Typically the bird appeared in display mode with wings raised, a scroll with the text "E Pluribus Unum" (Out of Many, One) in its beak, an olive branch signifying peace in its right talon, arrows signifying war in its left talon, and a heraldic crest or shield with the colors and stars of the national flag before it. Although these examples cannot provide an exact source for the False Peace Spectre because Smith drew inspiration from a wide array of materials, they nonetheless suggest that his decision to use a bird with talons thrust forward was grounded in pictorial conventions topical at the time.32 Avian imagery was common in artists' allegorical responses to the war, and entirely understandable given the importance of aerial combat and bombard ment that dramatically distinguished World War II from earlier conflicts.

Theodore Roszak's Spectre of Kitty Hawk invoked the location of the Wright brothers' first powered flight in 1903 to establish a chronology leading toward the deployment of nuclear weapons in the summer of 194s, while Seymour Lipton's Prehistoric Birds #1 (1946) reached further back into history to depict violent conflict as an inescapable part of life. Several scholars have noted the surge of interest in apocalyptic and regres sive themes in American art of the mid- 1940s and convincingly linked this to the war.33 Yet caution must be exercised in drawing too easy a connection between the False Peace Spectre and these contemporary sculptures. In its overt allusion to technology and phallic violence, as well as in the choice of steel, the Spectre is resolutely grounded in the realm of industrial technology already identified as a potential source of what Mumford worried was a "return to the primitive."

The sculptor made his intellectual debts clear when he announced that "art cannot be divorced from time, place or science. . . . Darwin, the evolutionist, and his theory of natural selection?and the economist and philosopher Marx" were part of the world that produced Impressionism, while Einstein and Freud were likewise linked to the radical change in art during the twentieth century.34 Smith harped on the theme of progress as central to modern art. In 1947 he proclaimed that "art is always an expression of revolt and struggle. Progressive man?progressive art? is identified with struggle intellectually and anthropologically. That is our history as artists. That is man's history as a primate."3? Smith's argument that steel was both beautiful and ugly, a sign of civilization and an agent of destruction, echoed Freud's insight that progression could easily turn into and even facilitate its opposite. "Human creations are easily destroyed," Freud wrote, "and science and technology, which have built them up, can also be used for their annihila 34.

Central to the former reading is the concept of the totem, a concept informed, Rosalind Krauss noted, by Freud's essay Totem and Taboo (1913). For Freud, the totem allowed humans to project their instinctual drives, including sexualized violence, onto mostly animal surrogates as a means of distancing themselves from their animal origins. Or, via sublimation, art could be the container for constructively redirecting those drives.37 Krauss has estab lished the motif of the cannon, later turned vertical in Smith's Tanktotem series, as working within the logic of the totem in allowing Smith to externalize and con trol his tendencies toward violence.38 Other sculptures from the 1946 exhibition, such as Big Rooster (194s) and Jurassic Bird, seem to be of a similar cast. They use avian imagery to evoke phallic potency and fragility; one struts through the barnyard, master of its universe; the other is a skeletal remnant, its progeny ris ing from the muck. Clearly the Spectre series can be located within the concept of the totem, though perhaps not as easily as may be imagined. Whereas other sculptures, including Home of the Welder and Pillar of Sunday, conceived in 1944 and l945 respectively, more obviously focus on his private life, it seems that Smith intended War Spectre and False Peace Spectre to function as public statements because they so clearly reference visual representations of the war. Again, Freud provides a crucial foundation for linking the private with the public, the personal with the social. Although Smith did not serve in the armed forces, he could still appreciate the extent to which the military trained indi viduals to deploy violence in the service of the state. He could imaginatively extrapolate from personal experience and fantasy a broader point about war channeling innate aggression. In Civilization and Its Discontents (1930), Freud asserted that "in mental life nothing which has once been formed can perish?that everything is somehow preserved and that in suitable circumstances (when, for instance, regression goes back far enough) it can once more be brought to light."39 Regression led to aggression. "The existence of this inclination to aggression, which we can detect in ourselves and justly assume to be present in others, is the factor which disturbs our relations with our neighbor," Freud insisted, and thus "in consequence of this primary mutual hostility of human beings, civilized society is perpetually threatened with disintegration."40 With increasing frequency after the slaughter of World War I, Freud turned his attention to the plight of European civilization, formulating his theory of Eros and Thanatos. The two represented opposite poles of attraction between community and individual drives, progress and disintegration, life and death.41 "One has ... to reckon," Freud admitted, "with the fact that there are present in all men destructive, and therefore anti-social and anti-cultural, trends . . ,"42 In the last decade of his life, Freud often drew attention to war. In a memorable exchange with the physicist Albert Einstein sponsored by the League of Nations in 1933, the psychoanalyst asserted that violence was the means by which humans settled conflicts because they were no different from the rest of the animal kingdom.43 "A lust for aggression and destruction," led humans to "countless cruelties in history and in our everyday lives," he reasoned.44 Given industrial technology, Freud worried that further war might eradicate civiliza tion altogether. 36.

Freud, "Why War?" 210. 36 FALL 20I0</page><page sequence="18">Freud's theories enjoyed great popularity with artists in the 1930s and 1940s and were known and discussed within Smith s circle of friends.45 He declared in 1940 that "Freud . . . has been the greatest single influence on the theoretical side of art, providing an analytical system for establishing the reality of the unconscious, that region of the mind from which the artist derives his inspira tion, and proclaims the super reality which permits use of all manifest experi ence."46 In addition to accepting the unconscious as a source of inspiration for artists, Smith no doubt reflected on Freud's radical insight that ambivalence characterized so much in human behavior. Although the sculptor never claimed to be a pacifist, he must have been aware, and troubled too, that the war industry for which he labored from 1942 to 1944 implicated him directly in the manufac ture of weapons conceived to kill. As much as the two Spectres condemn fascist violence through their materials, form, and symbolism, they also stand as lam entations for the bitter struggle for existence. If unleashed instinct was a last recourse in the defense of civilization, then violence deployed against violence was a necessary evil on the path to peace. Promoting Peace in the Age of Anxiety While Smith's reputation as an important sculptor grew in the last years of the 1940s, his opportunities to exhibit and discuss his work likewise increased.47 This guaranteed that his antiwar art continued to garner attention and to elicit critical commentary. Its presence in American art was read in mutually reinforcing ways. First, it provided evidence of opposition to war in recent history. Second, it served as a potent reminder that Americans needed to endeavor to prevent another war, especially as the next one might be nuclear. Additionally, this sym pathetic criticism begins to reveal the audience Smith must have imagined for his art. It was an audience of educated, liberal?if not leftist?gallery and museum goers who, like Smith, both abhorred fascism and recognized, for those familiar with Freud's insights, the fundamental human propensity for regression. Smith's willingness to display his antiwar art in the cultural spaces of galleries and museums, colleges and universities, and public libraries thus suggested an ongoing cautionary tale?one as appropriate then as it would be in future moments of political dissent?that these spaces and their audiences were not so far removed from the fields of battle to be immune to wars attraction and justification. One group that understood this core element in his work and that consis tently wedded it to the concurrent struggle for global peace was the American Association of University Women (AAUW). Comprising over one hundred thou sand college graduates by the late 1940s, the AAUW was devoted to education from kindergarten through college. A few months after the exhibition at the Buchholz and Willard galleries closed, Lura Beam, Associate in Arts, wrote to Smith.48 In a lengthy letter, she shared her hope that she could organize an exhi bition of photographs of Smith's work with, perhaps, a couple of actual sculp tures.49 Like previous exhibitions devoted to Francisco Goya, Kathe Kollwitz, and Russian war posters, Smith's would travel across the United States for a nominal rental fee (no more than fifteen dollars). The most likely venues would be col leges and public libraries in small cities. The goal was to familiarize Americans 45.

For Smith, the immediate conduit for Freud's ideas was the Russian expatriate John Graham; see Dorothy Dehner, foreword to John Graham, System and Dialectics of Art, ed.

She assured Smith that she only contacted those artists to whose work she had "a strong emotional response," and in whom personally she felt "great confidence." The resulting exhibition, with thirty photographs and a rotating group of a few sculptures, toured for nearly six years.50 Of the photographs, six were of sculptures related to the war, including War Spectre and Mse Peace Spectre.5' The cata logue asserted that Smith s sculpture represented a "significant comment on contemporary life," and printed excerpts of already published criticism.52 Viewers were encouraged to think of the work in relation to paintings by Hieronymus Bosch, Goya, Salvador Dali, and Picasso, sculpture by Alberto Giacometti and Pablo Gargallo, and texts by James Joyce, Freud, and Karl Marx. Indeed, the cata logue provided a thorough introduction to a body of work known for its mod ernist ambition and dense symbolism. Program notes developed by the AAUW used the published criticism to demonstrate that reviews could serve as a spring board for guiding discussion before the photographs. In her memorandum to the local branches, Beam suggested deemphasizing art-world terminology to let audiences bring their own associations and ideas to the fore: "The two war specters . . . deal with material now so deep in both the conscious and uncon scious mind of everyone that they will be understood without any fine words like abstraction and sur-realism. It appears perfectly all right that this war figure running with the mediaeval pennant should have no head?or is the head some of the industrial devices for war?"53 Informed by the catalogue and criticism from early 1946, her reading encouraged reflection on civilization, progress, industry, and art. Smith was thrilled. In a thank-you note he wrote,: "Your pro grams are excellent, large and very impressive. Your introduction is excellent?in fact I think this is about the best thing that has happened to me and I feel that you have been responsible in conveying my work to the reception of many peo ple who would not have seen it otherwise. I will always be very grateful."*4 As the exhibition toured the United States, the AAUW continued to remind its members about the issues raised by Smith. The October 1946 letter from the director featured a black-and-white photograph of Mse Peace Spectre and a caption that linked it with newspaper cartoons, birds of nationhood, peace and ill omen, and those "gilded inconsequentials" carried on the tray that might easily distract Americans from the pursuit of peace.55 Kathryn McHale's engaged and sympa thetic comments indicated an important way that Smith's art was and would continue to be read by the AAUW, namely as an exhortation to promote open mindedness, inquisitiveness, discussion and, ultimately, peace. Nowhere was this commitment to dialogue and understanding more evi dent than in the spring 1950 issue of the AAUW's journal. With a cover given to Smith, the frontispiece reserved for False Peace Spectre, a section of biographical information and critical reviews excerpted from the traveling exhibition cata logue, and several editorials devoted to the United Nations, it was clear that the organization continued to see the sculptor as a fellow traveler. By reproducing Head (1938) on the cover and following it immediately with False Peace Spectre, the journal acknowledged and reinforced Smith's oft-stated assertion that his art was expressive of the tension between civilization and destruction, poetry and per fidy.56 Placing Head first privileged the constructive goal of art as an embodiment of civilization. Yet with a Spectre so close on its heels, it was equally clear that 50.

After the visual preface, readers turned to the lead editorial, "World Organization?the Next Step." The "AAUW has long supported the ideal of world organization," the brief text intoned, "for only an effective world organization can meet today's threats to international stability and peace."57 Invoking the increased tensions of the cold war, the Communist revolution in China, and the development of the hydrogen bomb, the text served as an introduction to lengthier arguments on the need to support the United Nations and give it greater power in adjudicating international con flicts before they descended into outright war. The essay was punctuated by Smith's drawing of a flayed soldier holding aloft in one hand a coin, and in the other a machine gun.58 Their point could not have been clearer: there was no acceptable alternative to world peace. Ironically, by the time the AAUW used Smith's art to complement its call for supporting the United Nations, the antiwar content had been largely, but not exclusively, subsumed in his art by his ongoing investigation of materials and techniques, as well as the themes of family, landscape, language, and totemism. Yet as much as the later sculptures seem to distance themselves from the earlier, overtly antiwar work, it is nonetheless difficult to perceive them as a total break. In a way, they were only possible in a world no longer at war, because the lack of global conflict freed Smith to concentrate on matters closer to home. But home, as he had asserted by photographing the two Spectres against the backdrop of Bolton Landing, was never far enough removed from the threat of war.
