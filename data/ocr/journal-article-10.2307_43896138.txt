<plain_text><page sequence="1">Picturing Mani's Cosmology: An Analysis of Doctrinal Iconography on a Manichaean Hanging Scroll from 13th/ 14th-Century Southern China* ZSUZSANNA GULÁCSI AND JASON BEDUHN NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY Mani saw the role of religion on a cosmic scale and the universe itself as an all-encompassing mechanism of salvation - a complex system that functions as a passage for divine light-souls from a state of captive mixture with evil back to their original home, the eternal Realm of Light. In Mani's teachings, God creates this universe in or- der to secure the light's liberation. Thus, cosmol- ogy (that is, teachings about the structure of the universe) is truly fundamental in Manichaeism, pertaining not only to individual salvation, but also to the entire "work of religion." Mani ex- plained the origin of the universe through a se- ries of mythic events that lead to its formation. Manichaean cosmogony (that is, teachings about the origin of the universe) consists of a series of dramatic narratives of move and counter-move between the forces of light and darkness, culmi- nating in a precarious order under divine man- agement that fulfills its salvational function, before being shut down and destroyed once it has served it purpose. These memorable narratives in and of themselves were handy didactic tools that helped Mani's followers to better understand the structure within which their own religious ca- reers took place. Artistic representations of that structure, such as the Chinese Manichaean Dia- gram of the Universe (fig. 1 and color pl. 4) that is the subject of this study, served an analogous function. The largest part (henceforth referred to as the "cosmology fragment ") of the hanging scroll under discussion was introduced to modern scholarship by Yutaka Yoshida at the Seventh Quadrennial Conference of Manichaean Studies, held in Dublin in 2009. 1 It was Professor Yoshi- da's unparalleled familiarity with Middle Iranian cosmogonie and cosmological texts that allowed him to identify the painting in the first place.2 His initial identification of it as a depiction of the Manichaean cosmos was achieved, therefore, by a method that started from descriptions found in Manichaean texts, and recognized the structure and details of such textual descriptions in the painting. Subsequent publications regarding the cosmology fragment, however, followed a differ- ent approach, namely, to take an individual por- tion or detail of the painting and search through Manichaean texts for something that seems to correspond to the image in an attempt to iden- tify and elucidate it. The latter approach has two weaknesses. First, by identifying elements of the painting piecemeal, this method fails to notice when key elements of the overall cosmology are missing. The most notable example of this problem is the apparent absence of the crucial realm of the New Aeon or New Paradise from the painting, when the top of the painting as currently preserved is taken to represent the distinct Realm of Light. There should be an intermediate heavenly realm in a depiction of the Manichaean cosmos, below the transcendental Realm of Light and above the celestial firmaments.3 While Yoshida had no dif- ficulty identifying the overall structure of the cosmos as described in Manichaean literature, 55</page><page sequence="2">GULÁcsi and beduhn: Picturing Mani's Cosmology a: Three matched fragments (ca. 155 x ca. 57 cm): cosmology (137.1 x 56.6 cm), large paradise (17.0 x 37.4 cm), small paradise (17.1 x 22.5 cm) b: Outline of reconstructed paintmg (ca. 158 cm x ca. 60 cm) Fig. 1.

This super-celestial structure possesses well-defined characteristics that clearly distinguish it from the Realm of Light. It is a kind of building or plat- form that serves as the place of assembly for all the cosmic deities, in which they rest from their labors, and from which they continue to carry out surveillance of the firmaments and earths below. The Realm of Light, by contrast, is described as a garden-like setting, filled with trees, mountains, and streams of water, along with five dwellings and twelve beings called the Aeons of Aeons. Yo- shida found the latter description well represented in two fragments (henceforth, the "paradise frag- ments' ') that he recognized to be two sections from an originally single representation of this subject.4 In subsequent publications, Yoshida and Gábor Kósa separately noted the strikingly dif- ferent iconography of what they took to be rep- resentations of the same subject - the Realm of Light - in both the paradise fragments and the uppermost part of the cosmology fragment, and the failure of the latter to include necessary iden- tifying details of the Realm of Light, while giving scant notice to the apparent absence of a clearly defined New Aeon in the cosmology fragment as they interpreted it.5 Second, the approach of scouring texts for some- thing that matches a detail of the painting runs the risk of neglecting the rampant parallelism that pervades Manichaean cosmology, with distinct beings and their entourages repeatedly reflecting each other's characteristics and numerology. For example, the Father of Greatness is surrounded by twelve "aeons/7 but the Third Messenger is ac- companied similarly by twelve "virgins/ " while Jesus the Splendor is associated with twelve "wis- doms." Consequently, without an established iconographie distinction, a figure with twelve companions could be any one of these three be- ings. When the cosmology fragment was first identified as Manichaean, it was perfectly logical and obvious to assume that the figure occupying the center of the heavenly realm at the top repre- sented the Manichaean supreme deity, the Father of Greatness, enthroned in his Realm of Light.6 Seated regally, flanked by twelve figures readily interpretable as the "twelve aeons" that surround the Father of Greatness in Manichaean texts, the figure appears to oversee the entire cosmos from his vantage point on a platform hovering above the firmaments. But this natural assumption, besides missing several art historical clues that something was amiss, fell prey to Manichaean theological and iconographie parallelism. Our study aims to offer a solution to these puzzles and problems through its systematic inter- disciplinary method, returning to the strengths of Yoshida's initial approach grounded in the overall cosmos described in Manichaean texts, combined with an art historical analysis of its iconographie repertoire and compositional characteristics. By introducing doctrinal evidence gained from Man- ichaean descriptions of the universe, we employ a textually based religious studies method in or- der to point out the contextual associations that connect the content depicted in the cosmology fragment and the two paradise fragments. By in- troducing a formal analysis to the study of these fragments, we rely on a visually based art histor- ical method to verify the stylistic, iconographie, and physical ties that bound together these three fragments as one work of art. This restoration of the full original Diagram of the Universe, then, allows us to provide a systematic interpretation of the painting in its overall structure, confirm- ing or correcting previous interpretations of indi- vidual elements, while identifying and explaining several features for the first time. Matching the Three Fragments of the Diagram of the Universe A preliminary work of matching already began in 2010 with the small paradise fragment (17.2 x 22.5 cm) and the large paradise fragment (17.0 x 37.4 cm) in the course of their Manichaean iden- tification and initial publication.7 At that time, these two were understood to belong together, but with the temple on the right and a partially surviving triangular pond on the left. A reverse ar- rangement (with the temple in the center and the two ponds at the two sides) was argued in 2011, suggesting that these fragments represented the upper section cut from a full depiction of the cos- mos used for teaching with images.8 In all sub- sequent discussions, they became regarded as a part of one painting (rearranged with the temple and the deity in its center), which was a now-lost depiction of the Manichaean cosmos. Numerous contextual and visual clues, however, require 57</page><page sequence="4">g u L Á c s i and beduhn: Picturing Mani's Cosmology us to go further and consider the two paradise fragments together with the cosmology fragment (137.1 cm X 56.6 cm), not only as thematically, but also physically matching parts of a fully preserved magnificent depiction of the Manichaean cosmos. Contextual Cohesion If one starts from a comprehensive model of the cosmos based on Manichaean texts, it becomes clear that the cosmology fragment and two para- dise fragments have a necessary complementarity and only together provide a complete representa- tion of the Manichaean universe. While the para- dise fragments have been correctly identified in previous publications, the heavenly realm occu- pying the top level of the cosmology fragment is not an alternative representation of the Realm of Light, but depicts the New Aeon. Five key obser- vations based in Manichaean cosmological litera- ture support this conclusion: 1 .) Manichaean texts state that, during the ex- istence of the cosmos, i.e., the middle period of ''mixture" within the history of the uni- verse, the Father of Greatness remains veiled in the Realm of Light,9 while the multiple cosmic deities he emanates come to dwell in the separate New Aeon (or New Paradise) built in an intermediate zone at the top of the cosmos and beneath the Realm of Light. This self-isolation, veiling, or "mourning" of the Father of Greatness had canonical status in Manichaean teaching, based on Manťs com- position, the Treasury of Life.10 Hence the figure depicted at the center of the highest celestial region preserved in the cosmology fragment, surrounded by groups of other de- ities and exercising surveillance on the cos- mos below, does not accord with Manichaean descriptions of the Father of Greatness. 2.) The New Aeon is the place of the "com- pany of the fathers of light."11 "A New Aeon will be built . . . that in it the powers of the light may reign."12 Kephalaion 39 refers to "the time when the fathers of light, who were victorious in their struggle, will sit on their thrones in the New Aeon and dwell on the new earth. And they reign in the New [Aeon] till the Father unveils his image above them."13 It is only at the latter, eschatologi- cal moment that "the Father will unveil over them his [image . . .] and he raises them up [. . .] and he receives them in to his hidden treasury."14 Hence the realm at the top of the cosmology fragment, heavily populated with deities, accords with the New Aeon, rather than the Realm of Light. 3.) The Realm of Light is described contain- ing five "shekinahs" (Syr. šekīnātā),15 a term referring to a tent or habitation. These five structures are shown as temples on clouds in the two paradise fragments, while the region depicted at the top of the cosmology fragment does not have the requisite five structures. In- stead, it contains only four structures, which can be explained in light of texts concerning the New Aeon. 4.) The Realm of Light is described as para- dise-like, full of natural features: "fragrant with sweet winds . . . trees, fountains, and plants;"16 "adorned, graceful hills wholly covered with flowers, grown to perfection,- green, fruit-bearing trees whose fruits never drop, never rot, and never have worms,- springs flowing with ambrosia that fill all of Paradise, its groves and plains,"17 "the moun- tains, trees, and springs, the wide, strong pal- aces and halls."18 The heavenly realm at the top of the cosmology fragment contains none of these elements of nature, but presents the fairly sterile environment of a building, ex- actly as the New Aeon is described, while the two paradise fragments display such natural- istic features as mountains, springs, trees, and pools. 5.) In contrast, the New Aeon is described as a built platform, constructed by the "Great Builder," "the builder of the New Aeon, he of the immortal works, the indestructible build- ings,"19 "the new luminous earth, which was set and built on top of this earth",-20 "upon the crown of the building he has constructed a throne for the Primal Man and all the fa- thers of light, they who engaged the struggle with the evil one and were victorious over them."21 From this platform, the gods can gaze down into the cosmos, as described in an eschatological passage from the Sãbuhragãn : 58</page><page sequence="5">GULÁcsi and beduhn: Picturing Manťs Cosmology "And the god Ohrmizd-bay from the north- ern region, and Roshnshahr[-yazd] from the east, and the New-World-[Creating] god from the south, and Mihr[-yazd from] the western region, their (respective) stations, together with their own (entourage) and [helpers], will stand on that structure of the New Para- dise, around that conflagration, and will look [into] the conflagration."22 Correspondingly, the striped platform at the top of the cosmol- ogy fragment projects to the left and right, creating a three-dimensional opening to the cosmos below. Thus, even if the cosmology fragment and the two paradise fragments were parts of two indepen- dent hanging scrolls, based on their complemen- tary content, they must be considered together for religious studies research. Visual Cohesion Yet, the artistic characteristics shared by these three fragments go beyond indicating merely a the- matic cohesion. Quite remarkably, they suggest that the cosmology fragment and the two paradise fragments derived from a single work of art. Vari- ous pictorial devices were built into the original composition in order to unify the large surface of the painting, relate its over 900 motifs (anthro- pomorphic beings, animals, buildings and gates, mountains, rivers, and other objects) to each other, and move the viewer's attention from one section to the other. They are retained throughout both paradise fragments and within the upper part of the cosmology fragment, in each case alluding to a realm below and above, that are no longer physi- cally part of the fragments in their current condi- tion. They are summarized in the following points: 1.) Repeated figures of Mani that were painted by one artist are shared by the three fragments (fig. 2 and color pl. 5.1: Mani figures).23 They are shown from full profile with the chin lifted observing something above. In these, the execution of numerous details - the face's silhouette against the green halo, the facial features, the shape of the ear, the black lines that indicate the folds of the garment, and the angles of the red border that hems the outer cloak - all attest to being painted by one hand. 2.) Sections from the originally continuous row of colorful tiles that framed the green floor of the Realm of Light are preserved in each fragment (fig. 2 and color pl. 5.1: row of colorful tiles).24 Along the outer sides of the paradise fragments, some tiles are still intact preserving their base colors, the surface of which was decorated with delicate designs in contrasting lines (red lines on the white tiles, gold lines on the green tiles, white lines on the blue tiles, and what appears to be orange lines on the red tiles and possibly red lines on the gold tiles). The upper edge of the cos- mology fragment contains an identical row of these tiles, halved along the cut edge. 3.) Associated with the Mani figure at the up- per part of the cosmology fragment, an im- plied line also connects the three fragments. In many parts of the painting, Mani is depicted witnessing the workings of the universe one component at a time. As to be expected, in the upper part of the cosmology fragment, Mani is shown standing next to something important to observe. At this location, however, Mani is not looking at the centrally positioned deity and its entourage. It seems that he has already finished viewing them and moved on to an- other task, which requires him to look up. The depiction of this other task puts Mani in the pictorial role of a transitory figure, used by the artist to link one section of the composi- tion to another. In this case, Manťs head is po- sitioned looking up. His gaze urges the viewer to follow this direction to a realm above him. 4.) The artist uses two actual lines for the same task. They are drawn as tapering cloud-trails, leading upward from two of the three clouds that hover in front of Mani. A divine messen- ger is seated on each. Their clouds are drawn with trails that indicate movement from above, conveying effectively that these two fig- ures have just descended from a realm further up. The cloud-trails, however, are abruptly cut at the current top edge of the fragment, sug- gesting that the realm to which they are sup- posed to lead the viewer is no longer part of the cosmology fragment. The continuation of each cloud-trail is visible in the paradise fragments as will be demonstrated in detail below (fig 4 and color pl. 6). 59</page><page sequence="6">GULÁcsi and beduhn: Picturing Mani 's Cosmology Fig. 2. Artistic unity seen in reoccurring motifs of "Mani as observer" and "Rows of colorful tiles" (details of fig. 1; also see color pl. 5). 5.) The overall pictorial character of these fragments further supports the above-noted clues of common origin. A uniform color repertoire is shared throughout, demonstrat- ing the dominance of mineral-based paints in green, white, red, dark blue, and red-brown hues. Gilding is frequent. The scales, propor- tions, and the style of execution of the an- thropomorphic beings (human, divine, and demonic), the architectural structures, as well as the occasional trees and landscape all compare favorably among the three frag- ments. Such shared features already demon- strate a common period and workshop style. Noticing these shared elements urges us from a vi- sual perspective to disregard the cuts that separate these fragments in their current condition and, in- stead, begin to see them as parts of one painting. Technical Steps of Matching Their state of preservation presents the greatest obstacle in recognizing that these three fragments physically match. On the one hand, each frag- ment has lost some its content through cropping by a different amount along each of its four sides, which makes it hard to see how they connect to one another. For example, the cosmology frag- ment no longer retains its uppermost subscene. It was also cropped vertically at its two sides. On the right, at the height of the tenth firmament of the sky, only half of a deity is retained seated on a lotus base atop a tall column that reached all the way down to the bottom of the painting. Full versions of deities in analogous roles and iconog- raphy can be seen on both sides of the fragment, at the two sides of the first firmament and the outer atmosphere, respectively. Due to a wider cropping along the left side, the deity on the left of the tenth firmament is no longer retained. On the other hand, certain portions of the fragments show signs of restoration.25 This is especially prominent on the two paradise fragments. Based on a study of the layers of paint in-person and through high-resolution digital images, it seems that prior to their restoration, areas of the origi- nal painting to which they belonged were highly damaged, and possibly already broken into sepa- 60 a: Details from large paradise fragment b: Details from small paradise fragment c: Details from cosmology fragment</page><page sequence="7">GULÁcsi and beduhn: Picturing Mani 's Cosmology Fig. 3. Aligning the vertical axis preserved on the large paradise fragment and the cosmology fragment (details of fig. 1; also see color pl. 5). rate pieces (perhaps due to folding). To save the surviving sections, a new silk support had to be introduced beneath the salvaged segments. This new silk was painted to fit the saved original con- tent in small sections, especially around the cut edges. While successfully securing the original content, this restoration also stretched the origi- nal spacing to the right of the group of figures centered on the vertical axis of the original by ca. 3 cm. This added extra width upsets the symme- try of the original composition and disguises the original relationship of the fragments. Digital imaging technology allows us to see beyond the physical impacts of decay and subse- quent restoration that, while essential in securing the preservation of these three fragments, today present a hardship in seeing how they originally belonged together. By following a step-by-step process of virtual matching, we are able to dem- onstrate on the computer screen (and in print) how the cosmology and two paradise fragments were part of a single painting. The vertical axis remains an uncompromised reference even in a painting that is cut into pieces. Thus, the first step is the aligning of the two fragments that retain the vertical axis from the original composition - the large paradise fragment and the cosmology fragment (fig. 3 and color pl. 5.2). When these two fragments are cor- rectly aligned, their implied line of symmetry can be observed from the upper edge of the large paradise fragment, starting from the middle of its temple and running straight down along the fron- tally projected body of the main deity (flanked by seven figures in three-quarter view on each side) to continue in the cosmology fragment through the likewise frontally projected body of another deity (surrounded by six figures in three-quarter view on each side). This axis proceeds vertically across the middle of the rest of the picture plane. Strong supporting evidence corroborating the above alignment comes from two cloud- trails that were drawn continuously across the lower edge of the large paradise fragment, the now missing 61</page><page sequence="8">g u L Á c s i and beduhn: Picturing Mani's Cosmology horizontal cut that separates the fragments today, and the upper edge of the cosmology fragment (flg. 4 and color pl. 6). In their widest extent, these trails culminate in the cosmology fragment, in the two upper clouds that hover with their tiny occupants in front of the white-clad figure of Mani. The trails of these clouds gradually taper as they meander upward, leading back to the pedes- tal of the central deity in the large paradise frag- ment. Both trails have been damaged. The trail of the upper cloud is better preserved, allowing us to observe that it was painted across the surface of the colorful row of tiles seen at the upper edge of the cosmology fragment in its current condition. Starting from the lower cloud, the second trail had flaked off and broken into pieces. A portion of it was re-adhered, but has since shifted from its original path (turned about 90° clockwise). An- other portion of this trail, however, is preserved across the row of colorful tiles. While both cloud- trails are still visible on what is left here from the row of colorful tiles, directly above them a horizontal cut was made across the entire width of the original painting while trimming the cur- rent edges of the fragments. Although the edge of the green floor in the large paradise fragment was repainted (as discussed below), the rest of the two cloud-trails are fully preserved. The fact that parts of these trails survive in both fragments prove they were painted continuously, starting from the two clouds in front of Mani, proceed- ing across the tiles and the green floor, and lead- ing back all the way to the pedestal of the Father of Greatness in the original painting. Thus, they confirm the alignment based on the vertical axis. The second step in the matching of these frag- ments is the reintroduction of the small paradise fragment to the already aligned portion of the painting (fig. 5 and color pl. 7). Leveling it with the large paradise fragment does not present a problem (flg. 5a). After turning it 1.12° clockwise the colorful row of tiles that frame the green floor line up with one another on both paradise frag- ments: next to the temple and on both sides in front of representations of mountains at the left and right margins. As to be expected, aligning the small paradise fragment in this way does not change what we know about the overall height of the original painting. Not so with the width. Finding the original distance of the small par- adise fragment from the vertical axis is a prob- lem - a threefold problem. (1) One aspect of this problem concerns the decorative pattern of the green floor and the row of colorful tiles. The thin gold diagonal lines painted across the entire sur- face of green floor do not continue harmoniously across the cut edge between the two fragments. Above the green floor, the row of colorful tiles at the back, where they meet the temple, is in- terrupted with a non-tiled area painted white and dark blue. This dark blue matches the color used for indicating the void of cosmic space at various parts of the original painting, including behind the temple. (2) The second aspect of this problem concerns the introduction of an unutilized area of the floor to the right of the figures surround- ing the central deity. In its current condition this part of the composition is less busy compared to its equivalent floor-space on the left side of the vertical axis, which is densely covered with fig- ures, clouds, and cloud-trails. Despite the cut that sliced through this space, no figures are lost from here. Instead, it seems that some extra floor-space was added. (3) The final aspect of the problem de- rives from the fact that the combined width of the two paradise fragments (37.4 cm + 22.5 cm = 59.9 cm) is wider (3.3 cm) than the current width of the cosmology fragment (56.6 cm). The correct alignment confirmed by the vertical axis, puts this extra width entirely onto the right side of the composition, which upsets the symmetry of the composition and thus creates significant prob- lems in matching the two paradise fragments in relation to the cosmology fragment. Aligning the small paradise fragment accord- ing to its original content and symmetry, analo- gous to what is preserved to the left of the central figures and temple in the large paradise fragment, causes an overlap (ca. 2.5 cm) between the two (fig. 5b). The resulting combined width of two paradise fragments approximates that of the cos- mology fragment. The top edge of the cosmology fragment is essential for understanding an im- portant visual link between the two upper frag- ments and how much is missing form the original painting, since this cut edge preserves the lower half from the row of colorful tiles that originally framed the front edge of the green floor of the Realm of Light, just as the paradise fragments do the side and back edges. The color sequence of these tiles shows a deliberate order used as visual emphasis for the deities shown immediately be- low them. This sequence is created by placing one large gold trapezoid tile (twice the width of the 62</page><page sequence="9">GULÁcsi and beduhn: Picturing Mani 's Cosmology Fig. 4.

In the cosmology fragment, a combination of three tiles (red, gold, red) is used above the most important motifs. These include the main deity in the center, the white-clad figure of Mani half way between the central deity and the left edge of the scene, and a group of four deities positioned symmetrically halfway between the central deity and the right edge, as well as over either pair of temples close to the current edges on both sides of the painting. At a green tile just beyond the last red-gold-red sequence (above the temples), this horizontal row of tiles joins in with two diagonal rows of four tiles (framing the ponds) in the par- adise fragments . The height of the missing half row of tiles amounts to a small cut between the two surviving sections (ca. 0.7 cm) of the original painting. Although not impossible, it is unlikely that more is missing, since no space seems to be lost from the green floor. If so, the two ponds in the Realm of Light were relatively small (framed by 3 X 4 tiles with one additional tile in each cor- ner, see fig. 8 and color pl. 9). It is unlikely that the ponds were not fully shown in the original painting. Thus, it seems that a minimum of 3 tiles is missing on the right, and a minimum of almost four tiles is missing on the left (the corner of the fourth is preserved). These estimates are in harmony with the amounts missing from the symmetrically arranged pairs of guardian deities atop vertical columns at the left and right edges of the firmaments subscene in the cosmology fragment, half missing on the right at the level of the tenth (top) firmament, and fully missing in the corresponding position on the left. All in all, these observations suggest that the approxi- mate dimensions of the Diagram of the Universe (recoverable in light of its three fragments) were about 158 cm in height and about 60 cm in width. The final step of the matching is the digital eras- ing of the extra space along the overlapping edges of the two paradise fragments. This extra space was introduced as repainted blue background and green floor were added in the area to the right side of the temple, on the surface of the new silk that today supports the surviving actual motifs of the painting (fig. 5c and color pl. 7). Digital technology can elim- inate on the computer screen the visibly added and repainted surface, while keeping all original figures intact. This process reveals a layout symmetrical to what is seen to the left of the temple, which was not impacted by decay and physical restora- tion (fig. 6a-c and color pl. 8.1). The result of this final step is a composition that is virtually restored to its original 13th/14th-century state - before the Diagram of the Universe became damaged, broken into pieces, and subsequently secured by being re- stored as three physically independent pieces. The thusly matched Diagram of the Universe fits well with the size and subject repertoire of the other Chinese Manichaean hanging scrolls known today (fig. 7 and color pl. 8.2). Although all of these paintings had been slightly trimmed along their edges, their measurements exhibit comparable widths within a less-than-10-cm difference (rang- ing between 57.5 cm and 67.3 cm) and a relatively close height-to-width ratio (ranging between 2.06: 1 and 2.67:1). Their subject repertoire includes di- dactic themes, such as the depiction of cosmologi- cal, soteriological, and prophetological teachings; in addition to primarily devotional themes, such as iconic images of Jesus and Mani.26 Unifying Themes of the Diagram of the Universe The Manichaean universe is defined as a highly structured space. Cosmological texts discuss lay- ers that have centers and peripheries, as well as cardinal directions. Such principles of spatial or- ganization are evident in the visual language of the Diagram of the Universe (see fig. 1 and color pl. 4). The composition of this painting not only is strictly layered, but also arranged in a symmet- rical frame, within which a centralized alignment of focal motifs is present along the vertical axis. This compositional harmony, however, is fur- ther enhanced by certain thematic elements that supplement the visual unity of this work of art. Just as Manichaean literature about the cosmos, so too its artistic representation includes the re- peated motif of Mani as a visionary witness, an overall anthropomorphic interpretation of the universe as an organism of salvation, and the mo- tif of three walls enclosing the world. Mani as a Visionary Witness Mani's authority as a "messenger of light" un- dergirds the description of the cosmos provided in Manichaean literature. Mani authenticates 65</page><page sequence="12">GULÁcsi and beduhn: Picturing Mani 's Cosmology a: Area left of temple shown as preserved b: Area right of temple shown as preserved with physical restoration c: Area right of temple with overlapping digitally removed Fig. 6. Digitally restored symmetry on matched paradise fragments (details of figs. 5a-c; also see color pl. 8). his teachings by his own visionary experiences, through which he has personally viewed "the land of light" and "hell." I, myself, whom you are looking at: I went to the land of light. Indeed, I have seen the land of light with my eyes, the way that it is. [Again], I have seen hell with my eyes, the way that it is. I have (been sent here) by God. I came,- 1 have revealed this place (i.e., the land of light) [in this] world.27 This programmatic statement is echoed in numer- ous other passages where Mani describes in detail individual divine beings and celestial objects, as we will have occasion to quote below. In light of this literary motif, a fragmentary book painting from 10th-century Kocho can be identified as a depiction of Mani witnessing some part of the di- vine order of the universe.28 Indeed, positioning Mani as a side figure in Uygur-era Manichaean art is analogous to one type of his depiction in the Diagram of the Universe made about 300- 400 years later in southern China. Such an icono- graphie precedence raises a variety of questions about the artistic antecedents of these paintings to be explored in future studies. In the Diagram of the Universe, Mani is por- trayed in the role of an observer fifteen times across the super-terranean regions of the universe, clad in white robe and cloak with red trim, stand- ing next to various gods and witnessing their deeds: (1) the Light Maiden and (2) the Judge in the Atmosphere, (3) an unidentified deity in the 1st Firmament and twice (4-5) the Great King of Honor in the 7th Firmament of the Sky; (6) Jesus speaking to the 12 wisdoms, (7) the deities of the Sun, (8) the deities the Moon, (9) the reunited five elements in the Perfect Man, and again (10) in a position practically looking over the shoulder of the latter in the Liberation of the Light; (11) the Third Messenger in the New Aeon, and (12-15) standing in front of four of the five gods that dwell in the shekinahs in the Realm of Light (see fig. 1 and color pl. 4).29 The recurring motif of Mani as 66</page><page sequence="13">GULÁcsi and beduhn: Picturing Mani's Cosmology Cosmology ca.l58 X 60 cm (H:W = 2.63:1) Soteriology 142.0 X 59.2 cm (H:W = 2.39:1) Prophetology 119.9x57.5 cm (H:W = 2.06:1) Jesus 153.3 X 58.7 cm (H:W = 2.61:1) Marti 180.3x67.3 cm (H:W = 2.67:1) Fig. 7.

Showing Manťs distinct visionary encounters authenticates the visually conveyed teaching. The Cosmos as a Macranthropos Manichaean literature describes a cosmic struc- ture consisting of eight earths, stacked one upon the other, of which our own earth is the topmost. The atmosphere separates the surface of our earth from the ten (or eleven or twelve)30 firmaments of the sky. Through and above these firmaments, the process of liberating light from the cosmos occurs, along the "Column of Glory/' nurtured by the actions of sun and moon, gradually form- ing the "Perfect Man" as a kind of reconstructed double of the "Primal Man" whose primordial sacrifice initiated the mixture of light and dark- ness which the cosmos operates to resolve. The New Aeon rests atop this operational cosmos, as we have seen, and is in turn surmounted by the Realm of Light. The cosmos described in Manichaean literature resembles in some respects the cosmology of other West and South Asian religious cultures. Apoca- lyptic, gnostic, and astrological texts from Helle- nistic, Jewish, and Christian contexts conceived of multiple firmaments: three, seven, ten, or twelve as the case may be. Buddhist and Jain cosmologies offer even more comprehensive parallels, with seven or eight layers of the underworld, and ten or twelve heavenly firmaments. Mani personally had contact with all of these surrounding cultures, and the similarity in cosmic structure is present in the earliest Manichaean literature. For this rea- son, even though the Diagram of the Universe is a millennium later than Mani, from a milieu deeply influenced by Buddhist ideology, its resemblance to Buddhist cosmology may stem from the time of Mani, rather than from the context of the painting's 67</page><page sequence="14">g u L Á c s i and beduhn: Picturing Mani 's Cosmology production. We need to posit later adaptation only for features of the painting not reflected in early Manichaean texts, or details not specified in them. One of the most striking structural parallels be- tween Manichaean and Jain cosmology is the ma- cranthropic design of the cosmos.31 Manichaean literature describes the cosmos as possessing an anthropomorphic shape, i.e., as a macranthropos or giant human form stretching from above the firmaments of the sky down to the foundations of the earth. Kephalaion 38 outlines this concept. The head of the universe is the beginning of the gar- ments.32 His neck is the nape of the garments. His stomach is the five unfolded ones, which are [. . .] of the garments. His ribs are all the firmaments. His navel is the sphere of the stars and the signs of the zodiac. And also the parts that come from his navel to his hip are [. . .] that come from the sphere to the corners of the four worlds. His loins are the three earths that are below [. . .] upon the head of the Porter. His [. . .] from the [. . .] to the earth upon which the Porter [stands] firm. His shins and his feet are [. . .] and the entire zone that belongs [. . .]. His heart is human beings. His liver is the four-footed animals. His lung is the race of birds that [fly in] the air. His spleen is the race of fish that swim in the waters. His kidneys are the world of reptiles that creep [up]on the earth. His outer skin is the wall that [. . .] surrounds the piercing and the great fire. His [. . .] the vessels of the great fire. His [. . .] of darkness. His gall is the [. . . His] great intestine is the breadth of the great [. . .] of the worlds. His veins [are] all the springs and wells.33 A complementary description appears in Kepha- laion 70: This whole cosmos, above and below, reflects the pat- tern of the human body, [as the] formation of this body of flesh accords to the pattern of the cosmos. Its head is like the first-fruits of the five garments. And from its neck down to the site of its heart, it resembles the pattern of the ten firmaments. And again, the heart ac- cords to the wheel of the rotating sphere. And from its heart down to its intestines is like this atmosphere that extends from the sphere down to the earth. The [male] part of the body corresponds to this great earth. And also, from its intestines down to its loins is like the three earths. And also its shin bones to the patterns of the space in which the Porter stands, its foot soles to the great earth upon which the Porter stands, and the four fastenings that are under his feet. Its liver to the vessel of fire. Its flesh to the vessel of darkness. Its blood to the vessel of water. Now this is how the small body corresponds to the macrocosmos in its fir- maments, in its orderings, in its mountains, its walls, and its vessels.34 Werner Sundermann, drawing on similar passages in Middle Iranian Manichaean texts, has observed that, "In Manichean cosmogony and anthropog- ony, the creation of the world by gods and the cre- ation of man by demons were recognized as mirror images of a sort. Man, as microcosm (MPers. nasa and šahr ì kõdag, Parth. zambudīg kasüdag ), was an imitation of the macrocosm (MPers. nasā ī wu- zurg, Parth. zambudīg wuzurg)."35 These anatom- ical correspondences invite artistic depictions of the cosmos that take the form of a human body. Such an artistic tradition exists in Jainism. Un- fortunately, the history of Jain literature is so un- certain that we cannot be sure that its strikingly similar macranthropic cosmology dates back as far as the time of Mani. Padmanabh Jaini suggests it to be an innovation only of the ninth century.36 Nonetheless, both religions produced painted representations of the cosmos that identified the same cosmic structures with identical anatomi- cal features of the macranthropos, while other traditions offer broader points of comparison to the basic concept. The correspondence between the structuré of the cosmos and human bodies is explained within Manichaeism by a story in which the forces of evil - themselves beastly and animalistic in form - copy a divine form in making human be- ings. Hence, the gods look like human beings. By implication, when the forces of good created the macranthropic cosmos, they similarly copied their own divine form. "Thus, the fleshly body with its poisonous and evil greed and lust be- comes an exact copy of the universe of heaven and earth, though somewhat smaller and more intricate. . . . Just as the form of a white elephant is copied by a goldsmith who engraves it into his ring, and it corresponds exactly to the body of the elephant itself, so, too, man is a copy of the universe."37 When we turn to the Diagram of the Universe with this basic structuring principle in mind, we immediately note the large human head centrally positioned just below the New Aeon (see fig. lb). Placed atop the converged rainbow streams of light that flare out as they descend to the right and left, the overall design suggests a head atop neck and shoulders. The texts help us to see how the ten curving firmaments have been imag- 68</page><page sequence="15">g u L Á c s i and beduhn: Picturing Mani's Cosmology ined with artistic stylization as the ten full ribs of the human body, and the crescent ships and treasuries of the Column of Glory as the spine. The circle of the zodiac is positioned as the navel beneath them. The texts go on to discuss the in- ternal organs and genitalia of the macranthropos occurring below the rib-cage of the firmaments, and correspondingly we observe the set of coil- ing snakes reminiscent of the intestines, below which appears the prominent erection, as it were, of Mt. Sumeru. None of this anatomical imagery is obvious from a strictly artistic perspective, but can be discerned under the guidance of the texts. No doubt such subtle themes woven into the de- piction of the cosmos would have been pointed out to an audience viewing the painting by an informed and authoritative figure within the late medieval Chinese Manichaean community. Enclosing Walls of the World The "walls" mentioned in Kephalaion 70 above are featured prominently along the two sides of the Di- agram of the Universe (see fig. lb and color pl. 4b). They are depicted as three pairs of columns of vary- ing colors and heights along the lower two-thirds of the painting, with divine figures sitting atop each on either side. The viewer is to understand these columns as cross-sections of three walls built next to one another in three layers that surround the world from three sides of the cardinal directions - the West, shown on the left; the South, implied be- hind the viewer's back; and the East, shown on the right. The unwalled side, the North, is depicted in the background of the painting. The iconography of these three walls is nu- anced. The outermost wall is symbolized by the tallest red pair of columns that only partially sur- vive today. In the original painting, starting from the bottom of the "first earth," the top of this wall reached above the tenth firmament of the sky, sup- porting a frontally projected pair of deities. These two deities seem to be shown in the roles of divine attendants flanking the entrance to the liberation of the light. The middle wall, symbolized by the middle pair of blue columns, is intact. It is shown reaching from the bottom of the "fourth earth" up to the start of the first firmament of the sky with a pair of attendant deities in three-quarter view. Symbolized by a green pair of columns, the inner wall is also fully preserved. It starts from the surface of the "fifth earth" and reaches up to the entrance level of the atmosphere with its at- tendant deities in three-quarter views. Together, these three walls anchor and frame within them the lower cosmos, where light and dark are still mixed. Thus, they convey a message of security within a well-ordered and well-guarded space sealed off against evil, which opens to the marvel- ous vistas of divine goodness that the Manichae- ans situated in the North. The Six Units of the Diagram of the Universe A solid understanding of Manichaean cosmol- ogy is required for decoding the iconography of this complex painting. Textual sources discuss- ing Mani's teachings on this subject are scat- tered across a vast array of primary and secondary sources, and no one source provides a complete account. Nevertheless, despite some terminolog- ical and even conceptual adaptations to local cul- tures, Mani's original concept of cosmic structure persisted throughout Manichaean history, and is constantly referenced and presupposed in literary discussions of cosmogony, eschatology, soteriol- oge and even ritual practice. We can apply this literature to an interpretive survey of the Dia- gram of the Universe , within which six main the- matic units or "subscenes" can be distinguished. They include the (1) The Realm of Light, (2) The New Aeon, (3) the Liberation of Light, (4) The Ten Firmaments of the Sky, (5) the Atmosphere, and finally (6) the Eight Layers of the Earth. Not everything in the painting recognizably relates to the cosmos described in the surviving literature, and at times the painting itself clarifies or ex- pands on what the texts provide. The Realm of Light Descriptions of the Realm of Light in Manichaean literature discuss an indeterminate number of inhabitants whom the Father of Greatness desires to preserve and protect in their transcendental state.38 They dwell among mountains and trees and bodies of water.39 In addition, there are twelve beings variously referred to as "the twelve great ones, his sons, twelve of the same kind,"40 "light- limbs" or "wisdoms,"41 and "the twelve great 69</page><page sequence="16">g u L Á c s i and beduhn: Picturing Manťs Cosmology powers, the immeasurable aeons ... in whom there is no waning or diminution, the garland of renown of the Father of the Lights/742 They are " gathered unto the Father/'43 "a garland about the Father/744 and " surrounding the Father.7745 Keph- alaion 4 speaks with greater specificity of the "Great Rich Gods of Greatness - the first evoca- tions that he evoked77 whom he "spread out to the four climes, three by three before his face.7746 The other key feature of the Realm of Light mentioned in Manichaean literature is the five shekinahs, "tents77 or " dwellings77 also called five light-limbs,47 or five pure thoughts.48 They repre- sent the highest form of the five noetic elements that recur at every level of reality, including the five children of Primal Man, and the five properties of the human soul. Their exact function in the Realm of Light is not altogether clear in the surviving lit- erature. But Kephalaion 25 identifies them as the sources from which five divine emanations come forth: the Messenger, Beloved of Lights, Mother of Life, the Beloved (?), and the Maiden of Light.49 In light of the above, the Realm of Light is read- ily recognizable as the uppermost unit of the Dia- gram of the Universe, reconstructed from the two paradise fragments (fig. 8 and color pl. 9). The core iconography of this subscene corresponds to what is discussed in the texts. (1) The environment of this realm is defined by motifs of trees (shown with light symbols), mountains, two pools of water, and a diamond floor, the latter of which is framed in a row of colorful tiles. (2) Each of the five shekinahs is shown on a hovering cloud as a temple with a divine occupant, in accord with the report of one of the Coptic Psalms of Thomas : "(God) established dwellings (Gr. tamion ) of life, and set up living images in them.7750 Four of them are witnessed by Mani, while the fifth is too damaged to make out completely. (3) The central motif of this subscene is the Father of Greatness and his assembly that in- cludes the twelve aeons and two additional atten- dants. The latter pair can be explained by episodes in Manichaean myth, in which emanations of the Father come into his presence to appeal to him for further action in the conflict with evil and support of the redemptive cosmos. Most likely, the two figures flanking God represent the Mother of Life and Living Spirit asking him specifically for the cosmos-creating emanations portrayed throughout the rest of the painting.51 Further motifs supplement this core iconog- raphy. A divine setting is introduced around the Father of Greatness. Painted above him, there is a canopy (now damaged) and a pair of figures, seated on the smallest clouds of this subscene, shown decorating the canopy. Behind him are two flowering trees and a temple. The gilded roof of this temple was originally one of the highest motifs in the picture plane (reaching somewhat higher than the upper shekinahs ) dramatically contrasting with the background.52 Flanking this divine assembly is a pair of small clouds with two divine messengers seated on each, painted against the blue background at the two sides of the temple. Their cloud-trails seem to emanate from the floor, in contrast to the cloud-trails of the shekinahs, which originate from the Father of Greatness. The same is true for the two addi- tional small clouds, with one messenger seated on each, that cross over from the Realm of Light leading the viewer's attention to the parts of the cosmos depicted below. The New Aeon The New Aeon, referred to in Iranian texts as the New Paradise, is described in Manichaean litera- ture in sharp contrast to the natural environment of the Realm of Light. Its space is defined as a "structure/7 erected by a deity called "Builder77 (Syr. Ban). It serves as a platform, from which the gods can look down into the cosmos.53 It is "a resting-place for the redeeming gods, who are banished from the Eternal Paradise during their struggle to recover the lost light.7754 These "battle- stirring gods77 are said to "settle there in the same way as nomads, who (going) from place to place with their tents, horses, and possessions, put up and pull down (their tents).7755 In other words, the entire pantheon of deities emanated from the Father of Greatness assemble, sooner or later, in the New Aeon.56 A few passages, however, refer to specific gods situated there, such as a passage from the Middle Persian Šābuhragān : "Ohrmizd (Primal Man) together with the Last Man, the Mother of the Righteous, the Friend of the Light, Narisaf-yazd (Third Messenger), Bam-yazd (Builder), the Living Spirit, Jesus the Splendor, the Maiden of Light, and the Great Nous - these light fathers together with their gods, apostles, and ae- ons.7757 In another, eschatological passage from the same text, four deities are described coming from the four cardinal directions and gazing down 70</page><page sequence="17">g u L Á c s i and beduhn: Picturing Mani 's Cosmology Fig. 8.

Some Manichaean texts identify the Primal Man as "king of the New Aeon/'59 or as "leader of his brothers in the New Aeon."60 On the other hand, the Third Messenger appears a number of times as, effectively, the god of this world, ruler of the entire cosmos outside the Realm of Light.61 As such, we might expect him to be enthroned as king of the New Aeon. Here we find a case where the Diagram of the Universe itself might provide clarification of an ambiguity in Manichaean literature. The New Aeon is depicted beneath the Realm of Light in the Diagram of the Universe (fig. 9 and color pl. 10). Corresponding to what is dis- cussed in the texts, this realm is shown as a built space resting atop the temporary cosmos. The art- ist captures it by showing a horizontally striped platform around a rectangular opening, through which the inhabitants of the New Aeon can ob- serve the struggle of light and darkness taking place in the firmaments and earths beneath them. To further affirm a built environment, a pair of two temples are introduced standing along each of the two sides of this platform, contrasting with the shekinahs, floating ethereally on clouds within the space of the Realm of Light. The platform is populated by thirty-two divine beings. Their iconography, however, is nonde- script. None of the gods in this subscene can be identified based on their appearance. It is their lo- cations and groupings in the painting that permits their identification once matched to descriptions of specific deities in the textual sources about the New Aeon. Thus, the iconography and composi- tional arrangement in this art are used only as a supplementary, visual support to a teacher-sup- plied identification of the figures. The painting only differentiates the figures by arranging them in a pictorial hierarchy that features the main god in the center and the rest clustered symmetrically along the two sides in specific, numerologically arranged groups. Accordingly, we can make tentative identi- fications of some of the occupants of the New Aeon. The highest-ranking deity in this subscene matches the description of the Third Messenger. He is shown enclosed in a mandorla (not only a halo) and accompanied by a retinue of twelve at- tendants, which deliberately echoes some of the attributes of the Father of Greatness above him in the Realm of Light. In harmony with Man- ichaean literature, we are to understand from the visual language of this painting that this main being of the New Aeon is the god of this world, the active ruler of the cosmos, just as the otiose Father reigns over the Realm of Light.62 The best- known dodecad outside of the Realm of Light, in the cosmos, are the Twelve Virgins of Light of the Third Messenger, and this is undoubtedly the group meant to be evoked by these figures.63 The second group of most important deities in this realm is the Four Gods of the Cardinal Direc- tions. Each is enthroned in its own temple. Their four temples are portrayed as separate structures near one another on the two sides of the platform, projected from side-views in isometric perspective (as opposed to the frontal- vie w of more prestigious temples, seen along the vertical axis and, in one case, on the right side of the Atmosphere). Once again, the painting does not differentiate these four gods, but the literature noted above verifies that they are the Primal Man, the Third Messen- ger, the Great Builder, and the Living Spirit. The third grouping of deities consists of parallel sets on either side of side of the New Aeon platform, as it extends forward along the ground plane towards to viewer, each showing a god seated on a lotus throne with five standing (and thus lesser-ranking) figures around him. From the main Manichaean pantheon, such sets likely correspond with Pri- mal Man with his five sons and the Living Spirit with his five sons. Yet, once again, the artist does not provide any iconographie detail to permit the viewer to distinguish which group is which. Nine additional beings are introduced presti- giously on the two sides of the central assembly. The five on the left include Mani, who is shown receiving a book from the Father of Greatness de- livered by the middle of the three divine messen- gers,64 each of which is painted on a small scale seated on three clouds, and an unidentified deity, who is shown on its own. The four on the right of the Third Messenger probably represent the Pri- mary Prophets.65 As an exception to the rule, their identification is deduced from the distinct ico- nography of Zoroaster and the Buddha, depicted here as the two inner figures (shown further away 72</page><page sequence="19">GULÁcsi and beduhn: Picturing Mani 's Cosmology Fig. 9.

These two represent the earlier prophets: Zoroaster, identifi- able in the figure at upper left by a green object he holds, resembling a cut branch, and probably intended to represent a barsom} and the historical Buddha, who is identifiable at upper right by the ushnisha bump atop his head.66 Although there are no obvious identifying marks for the other two figures (shown in the foreground), based on the distribution of the four figures in two Man- ichaean paintings from 10th-century Kocho, they would be the two more recent prophets: Jesus at the lower right and at the lower left Mani, who is shown in this assembly in his role as one of the Primary Prophets.67 The artist moves the viewer's attention away from this subscene to the next in a creative man- ner, by introducing implied lines in the mere ar- rangement of the figures displayed along the edges of the platform. In addition, he makes them look down toward the center of the painting, to the area of the dark-blue void of the cosmos (shown in the background), which is overlapped by the figures of the next subscene (shown in the fore- ground, see fig. 10 and color pl. 11). The Liberation of Light Turning to the cosmos that unfolds below the New Aeon, one crosses a crucial frontier in the Man- ichaean conception of the universe. The Realm of Light and New Aeon are transcendental regions separated from the conflict and liberating labor of what one Manichaean text refers to as "the outer aeons . . . the worlds of the damage/'68 The cosmos beneath the New Aeon is a dynamic realm of force and counter-force as light and darkness struggle for mastery. Yet Manichaean texts offer a funda- mentally optimistic picture of cosmic mastery by the forces of good, operating at every level and juncture to overpower and suppress evil. This is a cosmos designed and operating in the service of the liberation of light, despite oppositional forces present within it. Manichaean doctrine declares that liberated light, including the soul of the perfected, ascends along what Ephrem Syrus says the Manichaeans describe as "streams of refining/769 out of the world via the "Column of Glory" (also referred to as the "Perfect Man") from which it passes first to the moon, and then to the sun, before reaching the New Aeon. The Coptic Psalm-Book repeat- edly invokes these three divine objects as a set: "For you the ships (i.e., the sun and moon) are waiting on high that they may draw you up and take you to the light. Behold, the Perfect Man is stretched out [in the middle of] the world, that you may walk in him and receive [your] unfad- ing garlands."70 The liberated soul recounts: "I washed in the Pillar. I was perfected in the Per- fect Man. I was given my first mind in the living atmosphere. I rose up to the ship of living water, unto the father, the First Man. He gave me his image, his blessing, and his love. I rose up to the ship of living fire, unto the Third Messenger, the apostle of light, the good father. I was ferried up to the land of light, to the first righteous one and the Beloved of Lights."71 Based on the astronomical origin of the mul- tiple-firmaments model of the sky in West Asia, we would expect the sun and moon to be situ- ated within the firmaments,- but Manichaean literature does not place them there. Surpris- ingly, none of the key features of the liberation process - Column of Glory, moon, and sun - are described in relation to the ten firmaments, de- spite serving as celestial channels and/or way- stations for liberated light between the earth and the New Aeon. They constitute their own dis- tinct sub-set of cosmic features invoked in con- nection with the liberation process, rather than being placed in different firmaments as they are in other cosmologies. In addition to serving as a channel for liberated light, the Column of Glory also manifests the emerging reconstitution of the full Primal Man with his "Maiden" or "soul" and his five elemen- tal children, dismembered in the original battle of light and darkness. As liberated light gathers in the Column of Glory, it takes on the anthro- pomorphic form, mentioned earlier, intrinsic to the orderly cosmos. Kephalaion 31 refers to this reconstitution of an ideal human form, when it says, "the Primal Man, he is the head, for his sons are set on him, the limbs of his soul . . . his head is placed on the body of the Column of Glory in the height of the world."72 This "great" or "gi- ant" figure73 is identified in some Turkic and Chinese Manichaean texts with the similarly ma- cranthropic Lushena (= Vairocana), whose body constitutes the entire cosmos in some forms of the Buddhist tradition,- for example, the Chinese Hymnscroll, stanzas 364-67, captioned as "Praise 74</page><page sequence="21">GULÁcsi and beduhn: Picturing Mani's Cosmology Fig. 10.

In a passage from his Šābuhragān, Mani says, "Then the Caller-god ( mizdagtãz-yazd ) and the Respondent-god ( azdegar-yazd ), whom Mihr- yazd and the Female-formed (god) (srīgarkirb), the mother of the god Orhmizd, had . . . above his body . . . were placed there before the lord of the land (dahibed, i.e., Splendor-holder, see below), who stands above all firmaments and holds the heads of these gods."82 A similar assembly of be- ings in the place of light liberation is described in Kephalaion 38: "Furthermore, the Messenger re- fined there five mentalities of life. Also, the Caller and the Respondent were placed with them. . . . Furthermore, the Messenger placed with them the great mind, who is the Pillar of Glory, the Perfect Man. . . . And look, see that Splendor-holder is established in the great mind, in the camp above the prison of the bound ones."83 The Chinese Hymnscroll contains a "Penitence and confession prayer text for auditors" (stanzas 387-400), with a hymnie preface which provides a similar cata- logue of divine beings involved in the liberation of light; but in this case beginning at the very top, with the "true Father" with his "twelve kings of light" in the "land of nirvana," before continuing down to "the palaces of sun and moon, the two halls of light, each of the three compassionate fa- thers" in each of the two orbs, along with "Lush- ena, the great dignified and solemn column," then the "five bodies of wonderful forms," referring to the five elemental children of Primal Man liber- ated from mixture with darkness. Stanza 391 adds to this set two final beings given the Buddhist bo- dhisattva names Guanyin and Shizhi, as cultural translations of Caller and Respondent.84 Their close association with the five divine elements is due to the action of Jesus the Splendor, who "gave" them to them.85 Together with those five elemental children of Primal Man and the five cosmos-governing children of the Living Spirit, they constitute one of the dodecads of which Manichaean doctrine was fond.86 Yet another figure placed by Manichaean doc- trine atop the firmaments at the crucial point of light-liberation is the deity "Splendor-holder" (Syr. safath zīwā), first son of the Living Spirit. According to Theodore bar Konai, he "holds the five luminous deities by their loins, and below their loins the heavens are spread out." Although Theodore bar Konai speaks of Splendor-holder holding the "waist" or "loins" (Syr. hassã), Augus- tine says instead that he "holds the heads of the elements."87 In any case, this action occurs above the firmaments, "upon the tenth sky,"88 "in the first watch-station above, of which the Splendor- holder is master," from where he exercises "his authority over the three heavens," i.e., the three top firmaments above the seventh heaven, where commences the realm under the authority of the Great King of Honor.89 He is "set firm ... in the camp above the prison of the bound ones," i.e., the ten firmaments where some of the forces of darkness are imprisoned.90 This complex doctrine is effectively conceptu- alized in the Liberation of Light Subscene (fig. 10 and color pl. 11). Some elements of this teach- ing readily lend themselves for a symmetrical presentation. Others are best suited for a central- ized visual hierarchy that the artist can reflect in the location of the motifs, such as their height on the picture plane and proximity to the center. Accordingly, a centralized focus and a balanced pairing govern the overall organization of this 76</page><page sequence="23">GULÁcsi and beduhn: Picturing Mani's Cosmology subscene. Once again, the iconography of the fig- ures is coded - who they are and what roles they play in the liberation of light were originally sup- plied by a learned elect trained in sermonizing with images. Most prominent among the symmetrically ar- ranged motifs is a pair of large circles that symbol- ize the "light-vessels" - the "ship of the moon" and the "ship of the sun." Although they are not given the specific details of ships in this paint- ing, the colorful beams radiating from their round light-filled bodies (through the fourteen gates of the moon and the twelve gates of the sun) do give the impression of oars. On the left is the moon with a dominant white background encircled in red. Inside it, there are three deities, five light- gathering angels, and seven pilots, in addition to Mani (with his attendants) and two groups of di- vine messengers on small clouds. Mirroring the moon is the sun on the right, painted with a red background and a green outline. Inside the circle there are three deities, five light-gathering angels, and twelve pilots, in addition to Mani (with his attendants) and the divine messengers on clouds. The pilots (or "shipmasters"), referred to in sev- eral Manichaean texts,91 may indicate that the painter was aware of the tradition that identifies these vessels as ships. As is the case with the pilots (and most other figures), the iconography of the three main deities does not provide suffi- cient identifying markers, and so was not meant to signal their identity. It is their numbers in association with their location that can be con- nected to textual reference to the Light Maiden, Jesus, and the Primal Man in the moon,- and the Third Messenger, the Mother of Life, and the Liv- ing Spirit in the sun. Although the "five dwell- ings" and "five walls" are not depicted, there are walls around the temple of the three deities and what appears to be a tent-like cover over the roof. A textual reference to a "tent" occupied by the Primal Man in the moon92 seems to correspond with the canopy-like cover seen atop the temples of the three deities in both light-vessels, painted as a red cloth in the moon and a green cloth in the sun. A distinct cloth-like cover is seen in the center of a moon motif in one of the Uygur Man- ichaean book paintings,93 preserving an example of a long-lived iconography in the Diagram of the Universe. Fitting its centrality in Manichaean doctrine, the final stages of liberation are portrayed in the focal point along the vertical axis, between the moon and the sun. This busy central set of motifs emerges from five colorful bands of "splendor." They originate as two separate streams at the two lower sides of this subscene and get gradu- ally closer to one another assuming the shape of a pointed arch as they near the center. The five bands symbolize the five elements of light as they follow the route of liberation. To reinforce this connotation, small figures are painted ris- ing up atop the two "streams of refining": three on the left and two on the right. They represent the about-to-be-liberated souls, shown seated on small clouds as they travel towards the center. In the center, the paths of light merge as the first deity at the lowest point of the vertical axis, the Splendor-holder, hugs the light-beams with his right arm.94 This depiction opts to conceptualize Splendor-holder gripping the neck of the macran- thropos (the "nape of the garments" according to Kephalaion 38, which uses "garments" to refer to the light elements),95 with the two rainbow streams suggesting neck and shoulders, above the Ten Firmaments conceived of as a rib-cage (as it is in Kephalaion 38 and 70). Thus, the light becomes the body of the "Perfect Man." Where the light streams converge, three upturned moon crescents are superimposed over them, each of which carries two figures who come with two treasuries, one on each side of the crescent. Flanking the Perfect Man's "neck" are two divine figures who can be identified as the Caller and the Respondent.96 They hold a white scarf, on the surface of which the personifications of the five elements are seated, symbolizing the five sons of the Primal Man: Light, Wind, Water, Fire, and Air. The body of the Perfect Man culminates in a gi- ant head (that of the Primal Man) slightly above the level of the moon and the sun. An additional small figure appears to be looking on from a posi- tion just below the right ear of the giant head, as if witnessing the formation of this being from the ascending liberated light. His white cloak with red trim codes him as Mani, one of the few figures in this iconography that can be identified based on their depictions. The balanced arrangement of further motifs continues along the edges of this subscene. Flank- ing the head of the Perfect Man, Mani and his attendants are paired with an unidentified deity and attendants. Both groups stand on descending clouds facing toward the center, as if they have 77</page><page sequence="24">GULÁcsi and beduhn: Picturing Mani's Cosmology come to witness the liberation of the light. At about the same level, but further away from the center, a pair of divine messengers is shown on clouds as they travel across this realm. On the left side, there is a solo figure of an unidentified deity on a lotus throne. On the right, the meeting point of two cloud-trails is shown at the corresponding location, the upper of which leads to one of the divine messengers just mentioned. The lower of the trails descends to a cloud supporting yet an- other depiction of Mani with his two attendants, who at lower right encounter an enthroned deity with two attendants. A small cloud emerges from this deity's mouth, symbolizing divine speech; but instead of a single tiny figure personifying the speech, as typically shown, this speech-cloud holds twelve such figures. This distinctive sym- bolism evokes the famous "twelve wisdoms" or "twelve sovereignties" recitation performed in Manichaean ritual and associated with Jesus.97 Thus, this divine figure appears to represent Jesus the Splendor. This somewhat unexpected place- ment within the Liberation of Light Subscene and its significance requires further study. In the corre- sponding location at the lower left of the subscene is a cloud bearing a youth (possibly the salvation- seeking youth also shown on the four quarters of the earth, see below) and two divine escorts look- ing toward the liberation of the light.98 The Ten Firmaments of the Sky According to Theodore bar Konai, three sons of the Living Spirit kill and skin the archons, where- upon the Mother of Life stretches out the skins as 11 firmaments. Most primary texts refer to 10 firmaments. Kephalaion 47, for instance, speaks of "the ten firmaments that exist above the wheel (of the zodiac), and the ruling-power that is bound in them, as it is imprisoned within them in the heavens that are above."99 A well-known Sogdian fragment on cosmogony provides greater detail: Thereupon at once the Lord of the Seven Climes (i.e., Living Spirit) and the Mother of the Righteous Ones (i.e., Mother of Life) began to plan how to arrange this world. They began to fashion it. First they made five rugs, on which they seated the Keeper of Splendor. Under them they formed ten firmaments. . . . Fur- thermore, he evoked forty angels, who hold up the ten firmaments. In each firmament they fashioned twelve gates; they constructed another four gates in each of the four directions, there where those angels stand. . . . For each of the twelve gates in each of the firmaments they constructed six thresholds, to each threshold thirty bazaars, in each bazaar twelve rows [in each row two sides]. On one side they made 180 stalls, on the other side 180. In every stall they fettered and caged yakshas and demons, the males and the fe- males separately.100 Similarly, Kephalaion 16 states that, "All the rul- ers (archons), the powers of sin who had faulted and sinned against the sons of the First Man, he (Living Spirit) has judged them according to a righteous judgment. He has bound them in heaven and earth. He put each one in the place fit- ting for him. . . . While some of them he enclosed in [the prison], others he hung head down."101 Although it may surprise some readers, the idea that demons are imprisoned in the firmaments of heaven above appears frequently in Jewish apoca- lyptic literature.102 Beyond this function, surviv- ing Manichaean literature does not offer many details about what is distinct about each of the firmaments, with the exception of the seventh and the first. According to Manichaean literature, the 7th fir- mament is occupied by the enthroned Great King of Honor (Syr. malkā rabbā deīqarā). In Kepha- laion 29' s enumeration of the nine thrones in the "zone," it reports that "the seventh throne in the zone is established in the seventh firmament; the Great King of Honor sits upon it";103 and in Kephalaion 28, he "dwells and is established in the seventh firmament."104 In Ml 78.11, simi- larly, "they seated him on a throne in the sev- enth heaven and made him the lord and king over all the ten firmaments";105 while Kephalaion 70 speaks of "his own authority over the seven fir- maments beneath him."106 Augustine of Hippo refers to the fact that the King of Honor (Lat. rex honoris ) is "surrounded by soldierly angels" (Lat. angelorum exercitibus circumdatum ).107 This imagery goes back to biblical precedent in the di- vine epithet Sabaoth ("of armies") and references to God enthroned "with all the host of heaven standing around him on his right and his left" (1 Kings 22:19), and is carried forward in later Jewish visionary literature, which places Yahweh on a throne in the seventh heaven, with "all his soldiers standing ... to his right and to his left before him."108 Several texts associate the Great King of Honor with some sort of device through which he moni- 78</page><page sequence="25">GULÁcsi and beduhn: Picturing Manťs Cosmology tors the firmaments. Ml 78.11 calls this device a "magic twelve-faceted lens/'109 Kephalaion 36 is entirely dedicated to this instrument, which it characterizes as a "wheel . . . with twelve seals in it/7 situated "in front of the King of Honor/7 and "set right at all times opposite the Great King of Honor.77110 It says that if one of the evil "rul- ers77 should start to rebel in any of the firmaments where they are bound, the fact "will be apparent and known in that wheel/7 and more generally "the spheres and the stars and the leader of all the powers . . . can be known by it.77111 "If they should wish to escape, they shall be recognized and revealed by that wheel, as the wheel is like a great mirror, for the discrimination of all things . . .in it.77112 The first, or lowest firmament has significance in relation to the "sphere77 or "wheel of stars/7 with the twelve figures of the zodiac and seven planets. As noted above, Mani identified the zo- diac as the navel of the macranthropic form of the cosmos, below the rib-like ten firmaments.113 The Middle Iranian cosmogonical text Ml 78.11, states: "Then, below the firmaments, they fash- ioned a revolving wheel and zodiac. Within the zodiac they fettered those of the demons of dark- ness that were the most iniquitous, vicious, and rebellious. They made the twelve constellations and the seven planets rulers over the whole mixed world, and set them in opposition to each other. From all the demons that had been im- prisoned in the zodiac they weaved - warp and woof - the roots, veins, and links. In the lowest firmament they bored a hole and suspended the zodiac from it. Two sons of God were placed by them as watchers, so as to . . . the superior wheel continually.77114 Much of the above details are depicted in the Ten Firmaments of the Sky Subscene (figs. 1 1 and 12, and color pls. 12 and 13). Arguably, it is the most prominent unit of the painting. Its visual dominance comes from not only its large sur- face that claims the middle third of the hanging scroll, but also the fact that this subscene is the only among the six with a repetitive composi- tion (see fig. 1 and color pl. 4). Its layout is unified by a strict rhythm that introduces a symmetri- cal frame for displaying as many as twenty mini scenes arranged in two columns along the two sides of the vertical axis. Each firmament contains a series of motifs that are systematically repeated at the same location at each level. When viewed together across all the levels, these motifs give the impression of im- plied columns that unify the composition of this subscene. Firstly, each firmament is defined as a walled enclosure. With only the upper bodies of figures visible, the viewer is given the impression that they occupy a brilliantly lit courtyard behind a wall. The wall itself is either dark-blue or dark- green and contains twelve gates (six on each side of the vertical axis), through which light-beams radiate from within the firmament. The sums of these walled courtyards form the structure of the sky and together constitute a broad column arch- ing across the middle portion of the cosmos. Sec- ondly, a gatehouse and a pair of atlas figures close off each level, forming columns on their own at the two sides of the firmaments (starting below the first firmament and culminating below the tenth, totaling forty). The gatehouse has red beams and a gilded roof over two gates. This double-gate structure no doubt represents an abbreviation of originally two separate gates on each side, i.e., "four gates in each of the four directions, there where those angels stand.77115 Standing in front of each of the double gatehouses, two angelic atlases support the firmament above with one of their arms (the arm closer to the center). They wear robes of distinct color (green and, what appears to be a dark shade of brown on the left; and red- dish-white and red on the right). Appropriately to their marginal location, these motifs are depicted oriented toward the center (from the cardinal di- rections) - the buildings in isometric perspective and the figures in three-quarter view. Finally, a triple motif, consisting of a crescent-boat flanked by two treasuries, split each level into two halves. The crescent-boat is a moon crescent that func- tions as a boat with two passengers seated in it (their lower bodies are hidden from view).116 Fit- ting their central location, the crescent-boats are shown from a frontal view, while the surrounding two buildings are in isometric perspective giving the impression of a wider space at their front and a narrower space at their back. Across the ten levels, these triple motifs unite the sky as they form the central column. This is a quite literal depiction of the "Column of Glory/7 across which the liberated light ascends and forms the body of the Perfect Man. The iconography of the Column of Glory across the firmaments thus utilizes motifs fa- miliar from Manichaean literature.

It is conceived as a vessel that ferries the liberated light, including the light freed from the body of the righteous elect. Its two travelers perhaps symbolize the liberated soul and its light-pair. The treasury buildings symbolize the karmie merit that ascends with the righteous as a store- house of light. This iconography corresponds to a passage in a Coptic source that mentions a "treasure77 of meritorious deeds that accompa- nies a soul in its ascent from the world.118 "All his prior deeds,77 Mani says of the convert, "shall be freed from every place wherein they are bound and snared. They shall loosen their bond and as- cend from heaven and earth, from the trees and the fleshes. They are loosened from every place wherein they are and go to the heights.77119 In a psalm used in the funeral liturgy, the ascend- ing soul of the deceased is told that, "your wares that you produced, behold they are first before you: some following after you, some overtaking you."120 The treasuries and the crescents are not exactly paired: the treasury motif begins below the first firmament, and continues three more times above the tenth, totaling 14 pairs or 28 treasuries in all; while the light ships begin only in the second firmament and likewise appear three times above the tenth, thus occurring 12 times. Undoubtedly, these numerological values have doctrinal significance.121 In each firmament, the divine and demonic inhabitants of the "ten skies" are depicted in mini scenes along the two sides of the Col- umn of Glory (for their listing, see figs. 11 and 12). The mini scenes of two firmaments receive special pictorial attention, corresponding to the greater detail on two of the firmaments found in Manichaean literature. The artist paints the first and the seventh firmament with a taller height (approximately twice the height of the other fir- maments). The first firmament is dominated by a depiction of the zodiac wheel at its center. It is held by two figures, one dressed in armor and the other in robe and cloak, representing the male and female angels mentioned in Manichaean texts, who are responsible for turning the wheel. Its inner ring seems to show five figures repre- senting each of the five realms of darkness, the "demons of darkness that were the most iniqui- tous, vicious, and rebellious" fettered inside the zodiac.122 Its outer ring contains familiar repre- sentations for the twelve signs of the zodiac ac- cording to the Greek tradition; but only eleven signs can be made out, and appear disordered in places.123 From Manichaean literature, one might expect the zodiac to be below, and suspended from the first firmament, rather than positioned within it. The latter placement followed here introduces an interesting doublet of astrologi- cal imagery in the painting, on which more will be said in the section on the Atmosphere Sub- scene , below. The space to the right and left of the zodiac in the first firmament features groups of seven and twelve figures, respectively, clearly invoking the seven planets and twelve constel- lations of the zodiac repeatedly mentioned to- gether in Manichaean literature. The left side features, beside the personifications of the twelve constellations, an unidentified deity seated on a lotus throne observed by Mani, all oriented to- wards the center. On the right, the mini scene contains, in addition to the personifications of the seven planets, an unidentified deity seated on a lotus throne, likewise oriented towards the center, and a demon in prayer facing away from the center (see fig. 12 and color pl. 13). The cen- ter of the seventh firmament is occupied by the motifs of the "Column of Glory." To the left, the Great King of Honor sits on a throne with his legs resting on the floor and flanked by his soldiers, all facing toward the center, while Mani and his attendants face the deity. The right side contains the Great King of Honor seated cross-legged on a lotus throne and his magic lens, observed by Mani, who once again faces the deity. Due to the dearth of detail on the other firma- ments in surviving Manichaean literature, it is impossible to know if the figures shown in them here derive from specific textual or artistic an- tecedents, or are generic "type77 figures to fill in the space. The presence of demons in postures of submission or docility124 illustrates in perhaps a surprising way the literary theme of their im- prisonment in the firmaments,- they are entirely absent only from the Great King of Honoťs sev- enth firmament. In only one instance (on the left side of the sixth firmament) does the viewer see a caged demon, and in another (on the right side of the fifth firmament) one apparently hung up- side down. Some other groupings appear to have specific enough details to suggest an underlying subject or story, the significance of which we do not know. 82</page><page sequence="29">GULÁcsi and beduhn: Picturing Mani's Cosmology The Atmosphere Manichaean cosmology includes a distinct realm of the atmosphere, between the surface of the earth and the firmaments. In Kephalaion 29' s distribution of key divine figures through the cosmos, "the eighth throne is established in the atmosphere; the Judge of Truth sits upon it, he who judges all mankind - three paths shall be dis- tinguished before him: one to death, one to life, one to the mingling."125 He is also described as the "Great Judge, who gives judgment on all the souls of mankind, his dwelling being established in the atmosphere under [. . .] wheel [. . .] stars."126 The deceased pass before him, so that by his judgment, "the righteous and the sinners would be set apart and tested and separated from each other."127 Those judged righteous meet the "wise guide" (Ar. al-hakim al-hādī ) and three prize-bearing angels, along with "a virgin who resembles the soul," in that its degree of beauty corresponds with the in- dividual's goodness.128 This report of an-Nadim finds confirmation in a number of texts from across the Manichaean world; they show great va- riety in details, however, including the identity of the main figure who greets the righteous dead.129 In Kephalaion 7, it is the Light Maiden in the role of the "Light Form who shall appear to everyone who will go out from his body - corresponding to the pattern of the Hikon of the Apostle - and the three great glorious angels who come with her: one holds the prize in his hands; the second bears the light garment; the third is the one who pos- sesses the diadem and the wreath and the crown of light."130 Just such a judgment after death appears on the right side of the Atmosphere Subscene (fig. 13 and color pl. 14). The motif of the judge and his office (depicted as a pavilion with features characteris- tic of a temple) occupies the upper half of this mini composition. A divine judgment is about to conclude. Seated behind his desk, the judge is shown issuing the verdict (personified as a small figure on a cloud issuing from his mouth). The tools of his work are put away: a scroll and codex, already closed, held by the two attendants, and a large mirror set aside along the exterior right wall of his office, still bearing the vestigial images of animals, reflecting the plaintiff's past treatments of them. In the lower half (closer to the viewer), the motif of the Light Maiden and her attendants is balanced with the motif of the plaintiff and his demon guard. In-between them, directly in front of the judge and thus in the focus of the depic- tion, is the evidence summoned for the trial: five animals and five plants (in Manichaeism there are five kinds of each), the latter clearly marked as containing the divine light, as Manichaeism teaches, by the addition of tiny human heads. The degree of care the deceased has shown in handling plants and animals determines the outcome of the judgment.131 To the left of the depiction of post-mortem judgment, the center of the Atmosphere Subscene shows a large grouping of intertwined serpents. Previous discussion has referred to this element of the painting as a "snake- world" or "basket of snakes."132 But what is it meant to represent? Manichaean texts describe a complex set of chan- nels, arteries, or connections leading from the firmaments and the zodiac down to individual liv- ing things on earth, like puppet strings,133 but the intertwined snakes are not shown in this fashion or serving this function. In this case, our method- ological preference to follow the lead of the texts fails us, and the meaning of the iconography must be identified from the art itself, which then might be brought into relation to some set of concepts in the literature. The serpents are coiled into a fantastic enclo- sure by seven shiny gold figures of snake-wran- glers. Protruding from the edges of their domain, six snake heads signal what is going on here. Three heads are shown with jaws open ready for their task at the upper right (closer to the judg- ment episode). Two heads at the lower left are in the process of devouring human bodies. One head, at the upper left, has just spit a body out alive (close to the figures of laity interpreted below as a rebirth episode). Their action and arrangement in relation to the two additional mini composi- tions of this subscene clearly is deliberate. The serpents devouring human beings and spitting them out alive symbolize the transmigration of those souls who have not yet achieved liberation. That such a process would be depicted is note- worthy, since Kephalaion 92 specifically states that originally Mani did not attempt to portray that subject in his Picture-Book. A catechumen says that Mani has "depicted the righteous one, how he shall be released and brought before the Judge and attain the land of light. [You have] also shown the sinner, how he shall die. He shall be [. . .] set before the Judge and tried [. . .] the 83</page><page sequence="30">GULÁcsi and beduhn: Picturing Mani 's Cosmology Fig. 13.

And he is thrown into Ge- henna, where he shall wander for eternity. . . . But why did you not depict the catechumen, how he shall be released from his body, and how he shall be brought before the Judge and [. . .] reach the place ordained for him?" The catechumen stresses the value of seeing such a depiction to reinforce the teaching. Mani responds that it is not possible to depict the fate of the catechumen in a painting, "because he shall not be purified in a single place,- nor cleansed and washed there."134 The attempt to represent transmigration in the Diagram of the Universe , therefore, raises questions about the exact relation of this painting to its antecedents in Manťs Picture-Book possibly suggesting a later development in Manichaean art. Ophidic creatures only appear in this cosmolog- ical vicinity in one passage in Manťs Šābuhragān, where he writes that the Mother of Life and Liv- ing Spirit, in order to set up part of the world's astrological apparatus, "fixed the seven planets (to the firmament) and hung up the two dragons [dõ azdahãg) and bound them fast. And they hung them up on that lowest firmament, and in order to make them rotate unceasingly upon the Call, they appointed two angels, one male and one fe- male."135 This passage provides one of the alterna- tive descriptions of the creation the zodiac (alluded to above in the discussion of the first firmament), which create certain ambiguity in Manichaean lit- erature about its location, as well as its physical characteristics. Indeed, several signs of the zodiac appear among the coils of the serpents shown in this section of the painting.136 The arrangement of the serpents is schematic, subordinated to a sym- metrical interlace design, without a careful defi- nition of individual bodies from head to tail. So, while at first sight the painting appears to show six serpents, since there are six heads, only three tails (all red) can be discerned clearly, and only two colors (red and green) are employed for the bodies. These discrepancies may indicate that the prototype behind this depiction might have had only two dragons with three heads each, since the term azdahãg used in the text quoted above de- rives from the Avestan mythological creature Aži Dahāka, a three-headed dragon.137 Avestan litera- ture specifically distinguishes a red and a yellow- green aži, just as the painting does.138 As for the seven gold figures who wrangle the serpents into a limited space, they may derive from the astro- logical reference to the seven planets of the text quoted above. In another Sogdian cosmogonical text, the planets and the signs of the zodiac are said to be, on the one hand co-rulers of the "mixed world," but on the other "in opposition to each other."139 This depiction in the Atmosphere Sub- scene would thus duplicate with an alternative iconography the astrological figures shown in the lowest firmament in the Firmaments Subscene. It may have been appropriated from its original meaning to provide a set of figures to convey ef- fectively the concept of transmigration. What, then, should be made of the motif that consists of three enthroned and haloed figures and their attendants aligned horizontally in a row among the coils of the serpents (see fig. 13 and color pl. 14)? 140 The fact that there are three of them seems to point to a key concept within Manichaean salvation history. Mani saw his own religious community as succeeding that of his "brothers," the previous religion-founders Zoro- aster, Buddha, and Jesus. Its role as their successor connected directly to the idea of transmigration. In a famous list of ten ways Manťs religious com- munity is superior to that of his forebears, the third item involves simply its later place in time, and so in the transmigratory process,- it prom- ises that "those souls of former times who did not complete the work in their own religion will come to my religion, and for them it will truly become the door of salvation."141 The latter idea finds its expression in the third part of the Atmosphere Subscene, positioned at the left as the concluding episode of the re- incarnation theme (see fig. 13 and color pl. 14). This mini composition features four figures on a red cloud encountering and worshipping Mani. Based on their garments, the four figures show distinctly different members of society (a soldier dressed in gilded armor, scholar in a green robe, merchant in a delicate garment with gold belt, and farmer in a simple white garment). In this context, the group is best interpreted as a visual reference to valued rebirth in four classes of so- ciety.142 Their location (facing Mani) together with their body position (sitting on their heels and holding their hands in the gesture of wor- ship) communicate that they are paying homage. As the object of their worship, Mani is shown on a descending cloud, sitting with his legs crossed, flanked by two attendants. 85</page><page sequence="32">GULÁcsi and beduhn: Picturing Mani's Cosmology In light of the above textual and pictorial evi- dence it has become clear that the narrative that unfolds across the Atmosphere Subscene illus- trates the reincarnation of the laity. It is conveyed in a right-to-left sequence, beginning with the post-mortem judgment at the right, continuing to a symbolic representation of transmigration at center, and culminating on the left with the encounter of reborn humans with Mani, promis- ing completion of their journey over many lives to liberation. A subtler visual clue included in the depiction of this subject is the motif of the Primary Prophets conveyed by the earlier proph- ets (Zoroaster, the historical Buddha, and Jesus) across the midline of the transmigration episode, with Mani as the concluding motif at the left roughly at the same level. The prophets together illustrate transmigration through lifetimes in pre- vious ages within prior religions, finally reaching Mani as the goal of the rebirth teaching depicted in this subscene. Independent from the subject of reincarnation, one would also expect to be depicted in the at- mosphere the Light Maiden in her manifestation as the Goddess of Lightning, who flashes her beauty in thunderstorms, causing the dark beings in storm-clouds to release rain and thunderous groans:143 The cloud shall ascend from fire [to] the heavens to- wards the likeness of the Virgin of Light that she shall display to it. Its sign is the flashes [that] occur with lightning storms [. . .] its exchange [. . .] And they shall be purified by her towards [. . .] the light that she will reveal [. . .] the rulers shall be released by the lightning storms and they are freed and sent. ... In contrast, [the] cloud that shall be raised up from water, and comes above towards the Virgin of Light, its sign is the thun- derstorms and the booms that shall come in the atmo- sphere in various forms and are heard.144 In accordance with the above passage, this deity is shown as a majestic being, whose power requires an iconography with six arms. She is standing on, and her lower pair of arms point toward, the dark " cloud that shall be raised up from water, and comes above towards the Virgin of Light." Her middle pair of arms grasps symbols of light, which she succeeds in liberating from the dark storm-clouds. She grips them using a distinctive hand gesture that has been identified in another Manichaean painting as a symbol for the separa- tion of light from darkness.145 Her upper pair of arms holds a red ribbon that appears to represent "the flashes [that] occur with lightning storms." The artist has placed the Lightning Goddess at the boundary of two realms in a transitory role, cross- ing over from the invisible atmosphere where the supernatural liberation of light occurs, to the vis- ible atmosphere of atmospheric phenomena just above the surface of the earth. The Eight Layers of the Earth In Theodore bar Konai's account of Manichaean cosmogony, once the archons have been skinned to provide the firmaments, their skinned bod- ies are cast down to form the eight layers of the earth, one stacked atop the other. Manichaean lit- erature offers two different schemes for dividing these eight earths. One scheme divides them into four lower layers or "deposits" (Parth. nlrãmlsn ) and four upper layers.146 Another divides them according to the position of two sons of the Liv- ing Spirit in the fifth layer, so that five layers lie beneath them, and three rest above them.147 The eight layers of the earth are surrounded by enclos- ing walls: one erected on the fifth earth, a second atop the four lower earths, and finally an "outer- most wall" (MPers. parisp I bēdom ) mentioned in the Šābuhragān as delimiting the realm under the control of the "Porter," one of the Living Spirit's sons who governs the five lower layers.148 The world we know, inhabited by plants, animals, and humans, is the surface of the topmost, eighth earth. At each of its four corners, angels hold up the lowest firmament of the sky, just as they hold each firmament above.149 As portions of mixed light and darkness fall to the earth from the firma- ments, the zodiac, and the storm-clouds above, it partially separates, with light entering into liv- ing things and darkness being swept aside into "twelve hells" (MPers. dwãzdah dušox ), through which it is removed from the surface of the earth and carried off to the gradually forming lump of inert darkness.150 The essence of this complex structure is cap- tured in the Eight Layers of the Earth Subscene (figs. 14 and 15, and color pls. 15 and 16). The artist shows the eight earths by combining a bird's-eye view depiction of two strata (the eighth and the fifth layers) and a cross-section view of all eight. In other words, an expanded vista il- lustrates the surface inhabited by human beings 86</page><page sequence="33">GULÁcsi and beduhn: Picturing Mani's Cosmology (i.e., "the eighth earth"). Directly below it, the cross-section of the same layer is given followed by the cross-sections of layers seven and six. Be- neath them, the expanded view, in this case with a narrower vista, depicts the surface of the "fifth earth." This is followed by the cross-section of the "fifth earth" and the cross-sections of the re- maining four layers. The enclosing walls appear as vertical columns, representing the eastern and western sections of the walls, with the viewer looking from the south (where another section of wall would be) toward the unwalled north. Two walls arise in the painting from the surface of the fifth earth and bottom of the fourth earth, while an additional one (almost lost on the right and left edges of the painting) frames the entire lower half of the painting, arising from the bottom of the first earth. Divine figures sit atop each wall on either side. Manichaean literature describes the surface of the eighth earth in great detail. This space pos- sesses four lands or quarters,151 divided by four mountains,152 with a central mountain as a kind of axis mundi,153 and a great sea surrounding all.154 A text published by Werner Sundermann imagines humans and animals of very exotic forms (multiple heads, multiple arms, hybrids of different creatures) living in distant lands.155 The principal events that transpire on the surface of the earth include (1) the subduing of a monster in the north land by Adamas, the third son of the Living Spirit, (2) the formation of a giant sea monster, linked to the zodiac, and responsible for tides, (3) the fall of the "watchers" from the fir- maments onto the earth, and the production of plants and animals from them, (4) the creation of Adam and Eve, and their awakening by Jesus the Splendor, and (5) the appearance of a succession of "apostles of light" in different lands at differ- ent times: Zoroaster in Iran, the Buddha in "the east," Jesus in "the west," and finally Mani in "Babylon." Kephalaion 70 calls the earth's surface "the third watch" - that is, the third of five stations of the sons of the Living Spirit, below that of Splen- dor-holder above the firmaments and the Great King of Honor in the seventh firmament. Adamas guards this space, "from the firmament down be- low to the [earth]. [And he] invigorates, accord- ing to this authority, the sphere and the worlds of the atmosphere, and the other four worlds that are appointed on this earth."156 He goes into ac- tion against the rebellion of a monster "resem- bling the King of Darkness." Theodore bar Konai reports: "Adamas of Light was sent against her and he did battle with her and defeated her, and turned her over upon her back, and struck her with a spear in her heart, and thrust his shield over her mouth, and set one of his feet upon her thighs and the other upon her breast." A fragment of the Šābuhragān relates similarly, that Out of that portion that had fallen into the sea there rose up a hideous, thieving, and terrible monster (MPers. mazan)-, and it tottered out of the sea and be- gan sinning in the world . . . Then Mihr-yazd sent out from those five gods of his own evocation that one four-formed god, who stretched out this monster over the northern region from east to west across the whole northern area, thrust his foot (onto it), and threw it down and stood upon it, so that it could not sin in the world. And this god became Lord of the Village (MPers. wished) over the universe with all its earths and heav- ens, over the North and the East, the South and the West, so that he might protect the world.157 Another Middle Iranian texts adds further specif- ics: "And he laid it down, its head in the east, its feet in the west, between four mountains, its waist in the north, its face toward the south, like a lion in the pitfall. His left foot [he placed] on its breast and its neck, his right foot on [its thigh]."158 According to Kephalaion 45, he "smote it and threw it between mountains in the place made ready for it [. . .]; he stands firmly upon it till the end of the world."159 Kephalaion 44 describes the formation of what it calls the "Sea Giant," from the "sediment" washed from the zodiac down to earth and into the sea. Because of the source of its material, the Sea Giant possesses an intrinsic connection to the zodiac, and the two continually interact. The Sea Giant causes the movements of the sea, aligned with the turning of the zodiac, along with the tides by its inhalations and exhalations. Iranian Manichaean texts refer to this creature as the "Monster of the Sea" (MPers. mazan ī zarhīg).160 The tale of the fall of the "watchers" from heaven to earth derives from the Jewish Enoch literature. In that material, the fallen watchers corrupt al- ready created human beings. In Manťs reworking of the theme, the watchers antedate humanity, and in fact are instrumental in creating Adam and Eve. Nevertheless, key elements of the Enoch lit- erature (some of them quite incongruous) survive 87</page><page sequence="34">GULÁcsi and beduhn: Picturing Mani's Cosmology Fig. 14.

B. Hen- ning identified a fragment of a Sogdian version of the story, M7800.I, in which, however, thirty-two rather than thirty-six cities find mention. Hen- ning explained this variant as cultural adaptation to Indian ideas regarding Mt. Sumeru (standing here for Mt. Hermon in the Book of Enoch), on which thirty-two gods lived with Śakra/Indra as the thirty- third. 163 The earth is full of the still trapped divine light soul, permeating all living things, and at times characterized as "the Youth" (Copt, lilou), or oc- casionally "Jesus the Youth," in contrast to the free and fully empowered Jesus the Splendor. This figure serves as the personified embodiment of the yearning and striving for liberation throughout time.164 Human beings represent only the most consciously activated of this universal striving for liberation. Adam and Eve come into existence through an orchestrated propagation, involv- ing the devouring of the offspring of the various kinds of animals by two of the watchers, Saklas and Nebroel, who then give birth to human be- ings in the beautiful form of the Third Messenger, who has revealed himself from the sky. Adam and Eve slumber in ignorance until Jesus the Splendor appears and awakens them. Their descendants re- ceive periodic re-awakening from the arrival of apostles of light, who deliver full understanding and establish religious communities, and thus create the conditions in which the universal aspi- ration to liberation may be achieved. Quest for salvation across the "four quarters of the world" is specifically discussed in a Parthian language abecedarian hymn preserved in M42 in connection with Manťs teaching about the Pri- mary Prophets (Zarathustra, Shakyamuni, Jesus, and Mani) and the Light Mind (or Great Mind). This text is written as a dialogue between a divine speaker and a "youth" (Parth. kumãr) - i.e, the same "Youth" mentioned in Coptic Manichaean texts. This correspondence with 4th-century Coptic material, as well as its Parthian language, supports the early date of the ideas expressed in this text. It reads, in part: (Divine speaker): . . . Out of stupefaction the four quar- ters of the world were plunged into turmoil. But you, beloved one, endure (here in the world) for the sake of the souls, so that (their) salvation may be attained through you. (Salvation-seeking "Youth"): The love and the service that you, oh God, have always shown to me are fully manifest. But I suffered this one time, when you as- cended and left me behind like an orphan. (Divine speaker): Remember, o Youth, how the chief of the battle-seeking ones, the Father, the God Ohrmizd, left his sons behind in the depth when he ascended from the dark for the sake of great gain. (Salvation-seeking "Youth"): Hear my supplication, you most beloved of the beloved names! If you do not free me (from the world) this time, send many gods so that I may gain victory over the evildoers. (Divine speaker): I have instructed the Great Mind to send you messengers .... (Salvation-seeking "Youth"): Zarathustra descended into the realm of Persia . . . , Buddha Shakyamuni . . . opened the door of salvation for the fortunate souls among the Indians. Then Jesus had mercy for the sec- ond time.165 He sent the four pure winds to help me . . . they sent to me Mār Mani as the savior who leads me out of this servitude, in which I served the foes in fear against my will. (Divine speaker): I gave you freedom my comrade . . ,166 This dialogue contextualizes the work of the Light Mind behind the mission of the four proph- ets, who all taught the way to salvation. Without giving special preference to Mani, the teach- ing conveyed concerns the collective search for salvation by humankind as symbolized by the Salvation-seeking "Youth." The depiction of this teaching was part of Manichaean art at least during its Uygur era, as confirmed by a painted and gilded silk hanging scroll from 10th-century Kocho, which originally showed four such salva- tion-seeking youth figures, with the four Primary Prophets around the Light Mind, as the source of the prophets' inspiration.167 In light of the above literature, the wide vista depicted directly beneath the atmosphere can be 90</page><page sequence="37">GULÁcsi and beduhn: Picturing Mani 's Cosmology identified as the surface of the earth in the Eight Layers of the Earth Subscene (see fig. 14). Its space is defined in four quarters with an abstract image of Mt. Sumeru dominating its center outlined in gold.168 Unlike the natural mountains through- out the world, this mythical mountain is concep- tualized by the artist as a steep brownish-green cliff (painted much like a tree-trunk) that elevates a broad green plateau high above the landscape reaching all the way up to the edge of the atmo- sphere. The plateau contains an unidentified cen- tral figure, flanked by two attendants, enthroned in a golden structure, with four supplicants kneel- ing before him,169 amid thirty-two gates that symbolize the thirty-two cities constructed for the children of the fallen "watchers" as noted in the Sogdian version of the Manichaean story pre- served in M7800.I.170 At the right, an unidentified deity and two demons in prayer observe the pla- teau from floating clouds. They belong to a group- ing of figures (that also includes the Light Maiden ascending to the Judgment episode, and a demon falling into one of twelve fiery pits) clustered to the right of the mountain, which informally bal- ances the Lightning Goddess grouped with Mani on the left. The immense size of Sumeru dwarfs the objects painted around its cliff, including the white moon and the red sun (outlined in red and green, respectively, just as in the Liberation of the Light Subscene, see fig. 10 and color pl. 1 1), a pair of two-story palaces (perhaps intended to be the lowest pair of the treasury motif ascending in a vertical column in the center of the painting to the head of Primal Man), as well as the ring of foothills and moat-like sea encircling its base. As the land around the foot of Mt. Sumera firmly anchors the inner edges of the earth, the latteťs outer parameters are equally well defined. The earth is envisioned as a round space in this painting encircled by a moat-like ocean. As the only being inhabiting the water, what appears to be the "Sea Monster" of Kephalaion 44 is shown at the lower right. This figure is defined as a fanged monster with protruding tongue, whose lower body consists of a coiled serpent or dragon body,- but instead of a cable connecting it to the zodiac as we might expect from surviving Man- ichaean texts, it carries a deity atop it. The sig- nificance of the latter is conveyed by its frontal projection, preserved for only the most presti- gious deities in this art. Outside the ring of ocean, a mountainous landscape closes off the two edges of the composition. From among the mountain- tops depicted here, jaws of monster heads spurt fire. There are three jaws in each corner, except at the upper left, where four seems to be conveyed (as indicated by the four pairs of eyes in relation to the four rows of white teeth), making their to- tal thirteen and^ not twelve "hells," as expected in light of the Sãbuhragãn. Illustrating the dan- ger these pits symbolize, a demon appears above them at the upper right, in a gesture of distress, as if he were about to fall into one of the pits. The regions of the earth inhabited by human beings are organized into four units. Their four- foldness is emphasized through recurrent imag- ery. Firstly, these lands are shown as pieces of flat land separated from one another by moun- tain chains into four equal parts. The light colors of their four surfaces sharply contrast with their environment, especially the four fiery pits at the outer banks of their units of ocean. Secondly, all four lands are marked by the motif of the "salvation-seeking youth" familiar from M42, prominently featured in their focal points sym- metrically placed around Mt. Sumeru. Located at the lower end of each land, this motif consists of a child figure on a descending cloud accompa- nied by a pair of divine attendants shown meet- ing lay family members in gestures of reverence. In light of M42, the youths symbolize "the for- tunate souls," who seek salvation and are "led out of servitude," as embodied in the "youth" of the text.171 The uniqueness of each land is communicated by distinctive motifs. The land in the upper left, evidently representing north, introduces two mo- tifs: Adamas subduing a monster and a tree with light symbols. The depiction of Adamas and the monster follows the textual accounts of the event in exacting detail, including the positions of the two beings, but adds the otherwise unattested detail of Adamas' mirror-like shield, in which the monster's face is reflected. In the land in the upper right (east), along with another tree with light symbols, the two unique motifs are a demon trapped under a rock and a demon atop a moun- tain.172 Similarly to Mt. Sumeru, this mountain is depicted as a tall cliff with a plateau on its top, which may be the way to depict a false god in this painting. The land in the lower left (west) shows the exotic beings mentioned in the Man- ichaean texts collected by Sundermann: humans with multiple heads or arms, a human-bird hybrid 91</page><page sequence="38">GULÁcsi and beduhn: Picturing Mani's Cosmology as well as a human-headed quadruped. Balancing all this in the land at the lower right (south), is a river connecting the outer ocean with the sea around Mt. Sumeru as well as a two-headed snake next to a demon in worship. The artist has used the mountain range dividing the two lower quar- ters as the setting for an additional mini scene. A group of originally five soldiers, in golden armor, turn this way and that amid the mountains and puffs of steam or clouds,- on the highest peak, a haloed figure sits majestically. The scenario may reflect the story of "Chasro the Blessed" - King Khusraw of Shah-nama fame - told by Mani in the Chester Beatty Kephalaia, who disappears into "the land of light," leaving his generals lost amid mountains and storms.173 Otherwise, the painting does not appear to portray individual in- cidents - such as the formation or awakening of Adam and Eve, which is conspicuously absent - but ongoing conditions and arrangements during the "middle period" of cosmic existence. The presence of a portrayal of Adamas with the mon- ster, for instance, reflects the fact that he "sub- dues" rather than slays it,174 and maintains this posture atop it for the duration of the earth: "he stands firmly upon it till the end of the world,"175 at which time "that village-lord god who stands on this earth, and keeps that gigantic dragon cast down in the northern clime . . . proceeds to paradise."176 As with the ten firmaments of the sky, so with the eight layers of the earth, Manichaean litera- ture offers very few details specific to each level. The Šābuhragān identifies the four lower depos- its with four of the five elements of darkness: hot wind, darkness, fire, and bitter water.177 It goes on to discuss the creation of the fifth earth: "And he made one other great earth and placed it down upon the deposits, and made the Mānbēd (i.e., the Porter) commanding god over it."178 This fifth earth matches the fifth dark element: smoke. Each element of darkness is associated with a particu- lar kind of animal form: smoke with anthropoid demons, fire with quadruped carnivores, wind with birds, water with fish, and darkness with serpents.179 Regarding the three upper earths sup- ported by the Porter, the Šābuhragān mentions "twelve gates, which correspond to the gates of the firmaments" in the sixth earth, matched by "portals, all (kinds of) channels and subterranean canals, which serve to lift up great volumes of wind, water, and fire."180 Just as only two firmaments (the seventh and first) receive expanded treatment in Manichaean literature, so only two layers of the earth contain active figures discussed in any detail: the eighth, already discussed, and the fifth. Both the King of Glory and the Porter occupy the fifth earth, but they rule over different realms: the King of Glory governs the three layers above them, while the Porter controls the five layers beneath them.181 The King of Glory's principal function in the "fourth watch-post" is to regulate the operation of the three wheels of wind, water, and fire, which operate in the fifth earth as purifying devices of the respective elements.182 In the "fifth watch- post," the Porter "bends upon one of his knees and supports the earths."182 Some sort of "disk" rests upon his head,184 "seven square pillars" in his hands, and "two walls" on his shoulders.185 The Porter's work of supporting the upper layers of the earth is aided by an elaborate structure of col- umns and arches, as described in the Šābuhragān : "three columns and five arches, [the first running from the wall-head in] the west to the western column,- and the second from the western column to the southern column; and the third from the southern column to the eastern column,- and the fourth from the eastern column to the wall-head that is in the east; and the fifth, a great one, from the eastern to the western column."186 Once again, the above passages are essential for comprehending the iconography of the subter- ranean portion of the Eight Layers of the Earth Subscene (see fig. 15). From the fifth layer down, each cross-section is shown filled with animal forms corresponding to the five realms of dark- ness, in accordance with the teaching preserved in Kephalaion 27 : the motif of anthropoid de- mons is shown in the cross-section of layer 5 to indicate the presence of smoke; in layer 4, the motif of fish devouring one another symbolizes the water,- in layer 3, quadruped carnivores sym- bolizing fire,- in layer 2, snakes symbolize dark- ness itself; and finally, birds in layer 1 symbolize wind. The cross-sections of the upper three lay- ers (layers 6-8, shown above the vista of layer 5) display more bound anthropoid demons, perhaps representing the flayed bodies of archons cast down to make the earths. They lie at each level amid the "portals" channeling upward to the ad- jacent strata streams representing the wind, wa- ter, and fire purified by the three wheels operating below, "in order that they (i.e., the products of the 92</page><page sequence="39">GULÁcsi and beduhn: Picturing Mani's Cosmology wheels) might ascend over these archons that are subjugated (or confined) in the earths."187 In accord with the textual emphasis on the fifth earth, the Diagram of the Universe gives visual emphasis to this layer, the surface of which is the only underground vista. It is technically the "low- est earth" (MPers. ērdom zamīg )188 since the four layers below it are designated rather as "deposits" (MPers. nirāmišn ).189 The artist has made visual allusions to the structural columns and arches mentioned in literary descriptions of this realm, without offering an exact architectural rendering. The columns are coded as "living" by bearing a series of human faces (those on the left-most col- umn have largely flaked off); while the arches are rendered by thin curving gold lines between them. Three foci of action appear across this earth. (1) The middle, and thus the most prestigious part, fo- cuses on an atlas figure known as "the Porter" in Manichaean literature. This deity is shown with his hands raised in support of the entire cosmos above him, positioned in front of his temple, iconi- cally flanked by two of the columns. The lower part of the figure has an ambiguous appearance in its present condition. It could show the Porter in a kind of weight-lifter's squat; but the knee on the right (the Porter's left) is raised distinctly higher than the other, suggesting that the figure may ac- cord with textual references to him kneeling on one knee.190 (2) The right third of the composition shows the "King of Glory" holding a ring of inves- titure, seated on a throne with feet on the ground (i.e., in the same manner as the other divine king, the Great King of Honor) in front of a temple and an attendant. In front of the deity, three intricate wheels, each of a different color and embossed with a face, emit swirls of rainbow light, rising upward toward the portals that channel it above. (3) The left part of the composition features two unidentified deities encountering near the third column a figure in a loincloth, the exact signifi- cance of which is, at this point, uncertain.191 Conclusion This systematic analysis of the content exhib- ited in the Chinese Manichaean Diagram of the Universe has sought to interpret it in light of Manichaean literature that is mostly traceable to the earliest period of the religion, and often to Mani himself.192 Despite stylistic adaptation to a Chinese artistic milieu and a degree of cul- tural permutation of some of the concepts in- volved, this representation of the Manichaean cosmos shows remarkable fidelity to Mani's vi- sion of cosmic order. Whether this means that the painting was produced in close consultation with carefully transmitted literary sources, or that it faithfully reproduces direct artistic ante- cedents, we are not yet in a position to conclu- sively say, although key iconographie elements appear to derive from Central Asian and even West Asian traditions. The iconographie significance of the painting is to be found in the model it provides of the exist- ing cosmos within which Manichaean religious practice occurs. The practitioners to which this painting would have been shown implicitly stand within the scene, since one side (the south) of the enclosing walls of the lower cosmos rests outside the frame, behind the implied viewer. The paint- ing gives attention not to mythic or historical events, but to a persisting, optimistic permeation of the cosmos with divine beings amid a function- ing apparatus of salvation. The structures and be- ings it shows would be presented to practitioners as a support-system for their own labors. As such, it would have immediate relevance to their daily practice as members of the Manichaean commu- nity. This role no doubt explains why the partic- ular subject of cosmology was found important enough to lavish such extravagant and meticu- lous artistic effort upon it. In light of literary sources, the basic features of the Manichaean universe are readily comprehen- sible in the Diagram of the Universe. Without reference to such sources, however, the meaning of the painting would be far from self-evident. We should dispel from our minds any notion that an average Manichaean layperson could comprehend the painting unaided. As to be expected from a so- phisticated religious work of art, this hanging scroll was designed to be used under the guidance of a learned elect who, in the course of an illustrated sermon about the structure of the universe, referred to parts of the image to better explain essential ele- ments of the Manichaean doctrine. As indicated by the complex visual language of this painting in itself, this medieval Chinese Manichaean teaching practice was most likely similar to the tradition still utilized in about two dozen Pure Land Bud- dhist temples in Japan, such as at Saiko-ji in Na- gano Prefecture or Dojo-ji in Wakayama Prefecture 93</page><page sequence="40">GULÁcsi and beduhn: Picturing Manťs Cosmology a: Pointing to scenes of a hanging scroll.

Sections of the painting are pointed to as needed.193 The vertical format of a hanging scroll allows the viewers to see a large number of subscenes at the same time, the viewing order of which is given by the instructor. On the horizontal surface of the handscroll only a limited number of subscenes are displayed at a time, and the teacher has to forward the roll as the instruction proceeds.194 Teaching with the aid of images has a long his- tory among the Manichaeans going back in time all the way to Mani (active 240-274/277 c.e.) in a supremely multicultural part of the late ancient world in Sasanian southern Mesopotamia. A va- riety of primary and secondary textual sources not only document the fact that Mani commis- sioned (or himself painted) a canonical collection of images (often referred to in Manichaean studies as "Manťs Picture-Book"), but additionally pro- vide bits-and-pieces of information on how such paintings were used by Mani, his successors, and other leading members of his community during the early missions. The continued employment of images for teaching among the last Manichaeans in the coastal provinces of southern China is viv- idly documented by the small corpus of recently discovered Chinese Manichaean silk paintings, which depict not only cosmological, but also so- teriological and prophetological subjects (see fig. 7 and color pl. 8.2). Of course, Mani could not have possibly used silk hanging scrolls to illustrate his sermons; such a pictorial format did not exist in his cultural and historical milieu. The only por- table format accessible to him was the handscroll (or roll) - a format originally for books, made most likely of parchment in 3rd-century Mesopotamia. This format was adapted for painting in late an- tiquity by utilizing the horizontal scroll surface scene-by-scene, designing and using such a "picto- rial roll" in sections (ca. 2 feet) at a time. It is im- portant to acknowledge that a 1,000-year history and the vast cultural diversity of the entire Asian continent stand between Manťs canonical paint- ings and the Diagram of the Universe. Therefore, the fascinating question of how the Diagram of the Universe relates to Manťs collection of im- ages cannot be answered without a comparative art historical study.195 Further research will have to first bridge the gap between the Chinese Man- ichaean art of 13th/14th-century southern China and the Uygur Manichaean art of 10th-century East Central Asia, before one may begin to con- template the lost, Sasanian Manichaean art of 3rd- century Mesopotamia in light of textual sources.

Notes * The digital illustrations supplementing this study were prepared in collaboration with the IDEA Lab of the Bilby Research Center at Northern Arizona Uni- versity in Flagstaff, aided by the financial support of the Dean's Office of the College of Arts and Letters at NAU. We are most grateful to the anonymous owner, as well as Shoichi Furukawa (Yamato Bunkakan, Nara, Japan), and Yutaka Yoshida (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) for facilitating our access to and use of the three fragments of this Chinese Manichaean depiction of the universe reproduced here. 1. A. Donohashi of Kobe University had been shown the painting along with others by its anonymous owner some years earlier, and brought it to Yoshida's attention (via Furukawa) in 2008 because of its stylis- tic and iconographie similarities to a painting from the collection of the Yamato Art Museum, whose identi- fication as Manichaean by Yoshida had been widely reported in the Japanese press. Although publication of the proceedings of the Dublin conference has been delayed until early 2015, Yoshida's initial identification and analysis of the cosmology fragment was published in Japanese (Yoshida 2010: 3-34). Many of the identifi- cations discussed below were made already by Yoshida in this publication. 2. For a brief survey of the major Manichaean cosmogonie and cosmological texts, see Sundermann 2001a: 13-15. Yoshida cites in particular the Sogdian text Ml 78.11 and the Middle Persian fragments of Mani's Šābuhragān (as identified by Manfred Hütt er 1992), especially M98 and M 99. 3. The differentiation of the Endless Light in which the ultimate God is enthroned, and a secondary heav- enly realm, inhabited by emanated and subordinate deities, can be found in the Zoroas trian tradition (see Panaino 1995: 205-25). It also is a common motif in Jewish apocalyptic literature. 4. Yoshida 2010: 16a. 5. See Yoshida 2010: 15b-16a; Kósa 2010-2011: 24, • 2015: 183-84. 6. Yoshida 2010: 15a-b; Kósa 2013: 63-64. 7. The small paradise fragment ("Realm of Light B"), the large paradise fragment ("Realm of Light A"), and the cosmology fragment ("Cosmogony") were first discussed by Yoshida at the Seventh International Con- gress of Manichaean Studies (Dublin, 2009) and subse- quently published by him and Shoichi Furukawa (2010: color pls. 6, 5, and 1, respectively). It should be noted that, although Yoshida's English articles consistently refer to the painting as a "cosmogony," his original underlying Japanese expression is uchuuzu lit. 'cosmos illustration/ and therefore "cosmology" is al- ways (correctly) what is intended in his discussion. 8. "It might also turn out that these two Realm of Light fragments belonged to a painting that was similar to the C[osmology] P[ainting] (an idea put forward by Zs. Gulácsi in Nara, June 6, 201 1, private communication)" (Kósa 2010-201 1 : 26). The rearranging of two fragments, but not their joining to the larger cosmology fragment, was also suggested by Dr. Nakabe, a curator of the Ya- mato Art Museum (see Yoshida 2010: p. 31, n. 64). 9. On this subject, see Nils Arne Pedersen (2011: 229-34), who identifies the principal primary sources and explores Jewish antecedents of the idea. 10. Evodius of Uzala, De fide 13, cites it from the "first book of the Treasury ." Other references to it in surviving Manichaean texts include 1 Ke 60, 151.19- 22; 2 Ps 1.7-8 and 133.20-21; T. Kel. Copt. 1, al0-ll; and by implication several additional texts on the sub- ject of the unveiling of the Father of Greatness at the eschaton (see Pedersen 2011: p. 230, nn. 3, 4). 11. 1 Ke 26, 77.20-21 (trans. Gardner 1995: 78). 12. 2 Ps (Allberry 1938) 11.21-23. 13. 1 Ke 39, 103.2-7 (trans. Gardner 1995: 107). 14. 1 Ke 39, 103.10-13 (trans. Gardner 1995: 107). This account closely matches a preserved fragment of Manťs Šābuhragān : "And then the battle-stirring gods lead and guide their aeons and those homomor- phic (with them) that they had called into the great earth and placed (there), by divine proclamation, to the New Aeon, and settle there in the same way as nomads who, (going) from place to place with their tents, horses, and possessions, put up and pull down (their tents). . . . And when all the battle-stirrers have rested for a short while in the New Aeon, and when also that little bit of the Light-Earth and its mountains, wherefrom had been taken the means for building the New Aeon, has been restored, and when also the Last Man stands as the mightiest in stature, and when the warlike gods together with the five lights have been healed from (their) wounds, then all the jewels, the apostles, and the battle-stirring gods stand up and appear before the Sovereign of Paradise with imploring and prayer. . . .

This similar execution of the Mani figures on the three fragments was pointed out by Furukawa (2010: 40). See further Yoshida's extensive discussion proving the identity of these figures as Mani (Yoshida 2010: 8-9). 24. Kósa observes that, "the alternative Realm of Light depiction . . . features a basically green land bor- dered by lozenge-shaped tiles with unique motifs on them" (Kósa 2015: 181), and in a note on this observa- tion, comments that, "the remnants of a similar row of tiles can be discerned at the very top of the C[osmology] P[ainting]" (p. 194, n. 8); but he does not detect that the tiles are not just similar, but identical, and belong to the same hand and the same original painting. 25. On the basis of a close examination of the frag- ments, Furukawa drew the conclusion that they were restored and over-painted by later (possibly modern) hands (Furukawa 2010: 36a, 38b). 26. For an overview or these Chinese Manichaean hanging scrolls (except the Jesus image), see Yoshida 2009a: 3-15; 2009b: 697-714; 2010: pp. 1-34 and color pls. 1-9; 2012: 1-10; and 2015: 389-98.

Further studies on the interpretation of various detail of the cosmology fragment are forthcoming by Kósa. 27. 2 Ke 424, 7ff., quoted from Gardner 2014: 94. 28. MIK III 4964 recto (see Gulácsi 2001: 120-21). Manťs iconography in this intra-columnar book paint- ing fits his other depictions that show him with a forked beard and no headgear atop his long black hair, dressed in white robes and a cloak, which in this case has a gold and red hem (Ebert 2009: 43). The above in- terpretation of Mani in the role of a visionary witness is analogous to what is depicted throughout the Dia- gram of the Universe, as pointed out by Yoshida 2010: 9b- 10a, and subsequently Kósa 2015: 182-83. Despite his secondary role as the observer of the main topic of this fragmentary book painting (most likely a cosmo- logical theme - now lost), Manťs significance is clearly indicated by his gilded cloak and halo. 29. He appears to be shown three additional times in a more active role: ( 1 ) as one of the Primary Prophets in the New Aeon; (2) on the left side of the 8th firma- ment, face to face with a docile demon figure; and (3) in the atmosphere being reverenced by a group of four laypeople. 30.

Kósa notes a rectangular gold object, represent- ing "a book or a box,77 which he seems to interpret to be Manťs Picture-Book (the visual summary of Mani7s teachings). In support, he cites Homilies 47.7-10 that names the Father of Greatness as the ultimate source of Manťs wisdom (2015: pp. 182-83 and n. 35). There are two problems with reading the Book of Pictures into this context. Firstly, this book of Manťs is put forward as a gift from God only in post-Manichaean Islamic literature. In that tradition, this book is a false prophet-wonder of a false prophet (i.e., a work of art painted while hiding in a cave and deceitfully claimed to be God7s gift to Mani). But in a Manichaean context, the Book of Pictures is not singled out in this way, as the all-inclusive sign of Manťs wisdom, and it is un- likely that Manťs Islamic prophet-wonder story would inform the iconography of a Manichaean painting. Sec- ondly, the Homilies passage about God as the source of Manťs wisdom implies that all the knowledge trans- mitted in Manťs books has a divine origin. Therefore, this text better supports the argument that the book depicted here symbolizes Manťs doctrine, his books, and thus the Manichaean canon, in general. Manťs "picture-box77 known only from a Chagatai version of the polemical cave story, which caricatures Manťs de- ceitfulness by stating that his picture-book was a box made out to resemble a book (see Gulácsi 2005a, 149- 66), does not belong to this discussion. 65.

In the previously quoted passage of Kephalaion 38, wherein the Third Messenger positions the Caller and Respondent with the five light elements in the proximity of the Perfect Man, and before the passage goes on to similarly situate Splendor-holder, the text says, "Furthermore, there was placed with them Jesus the Youth, he who is the image of the living word of the Caller and Respondent" (1 Ke 38, 92.7-8; trans, in Gardner 1995: 97 differs). 99. 1 Ke 47, 118.20-23 (trans.

This lat- ter statement may explain the presence of treasuries among the entwined snakes below the first firmament, explained below as a representation of transmigration. 119. 1 Ke 90, 226.13-19 (trans.

In the painting, the lowest pair rests below the first, lowest firmament, and three pairs appear above the topmost firmament, thus totaling 14 pairs or 28. The numerical references to 12 and 28 appear to re- flect the number of lunar months (12) and the number of days in a lunar month (28). Similarly, Kósa suggests that the 28 "palaces" possibly refer to 14 days of light passing to moon, followed by 14 days passing from moon to sun, within each month (2013: 21). 122. See Yoshida 2010: 7a-8a. 123. No representation of Virgo appears, Sagittarius and Capricorn appear in inverted order, and Leo ap- pears between Aries and Taurus.

He (sic) took me to the Judge without any shame; for what he entrusted to me I have perfected." 131. Cf. the Turkic text published by Le Coq as T II D 178.R.2-6: "It says: the deeds he has committed will become visible. It says: the spirits of land and water will be distressed. It says: the spirits of grass and wa- ter will weep. It says: the spirits of shrubs and trees will howl" (Le Coq 1919: 12; trans, by Larry V. Clark, personal communication). The passage goes on to men- tion a mirror and scales. For more on the iconography of the judgment after death in Manichaean and Chi- nese Buddhist art, see Kósa forthcoming. 132. Yoshida identifies this structure with the so- called 1 1th heaven, and equates it with Middle Persian gyidysmyn and Chinese Hit 'karma-wheel/ Yoshida 2010: 7b-8a with n. 25; and Kósa 2010-2011: 21-22; 2013: 67. 133.

Including the soldier and omitting the iterant laborer might be a Central Asian trait that distinguishes this iconogra- phy from the depiction of valued rebirth symbolized by the four classes of Chinese society (merchants, artisans, farmer, and scholar-officials) as in the Man- ichaean hanging scroll held in the Yamato Bunkakan (see Gulácsi 2009a: p. 103 and color pl. 6). 143. In Uygur Manichaean texts she appears as yašin tärjri, "Lightning Goddess" (e.g., MIK III 200.I.R.13, Clark 2013: 194-97; and PC 3049[A].14, Clark 2013: 211-12), and in the Chinese Hymnscroll (stanzas 126 and 171) as dianguangfo, "Thunderbolt god," and dian - guang ming, "Thunderbolt light" (see Tongerloo 1997: 367-71).

Signifying the dualistic separation of light from darkness, this gesture is assumed by Jesus' right hand in the Manichaean hanging scroll housed in the collec- tion of Seiun-ji Zen temple (see Gulácsi 2009a: 141-43). 146. E.g., Kephalaion 47: "the eight earths that are below; the four that are composite and the four places of darkness . . . extend from this earth, upon which human- kind walks, towards the underside" (1 Ke 47, 1 18.24-27; trans. Gardner 1995: 125); M98.I.V.8-17 ( Šābuhragān ): the Living Spirit/Mihr-yazd "collected and deposited four layers over the earth of darkness to correspond with the firmaments above, of hot wind, darkness, fire, and water, one over the other. He constructed them in lay- ers" (Hutter 1992: 12-13; Jackson 1932: 32-33). 147. E.g., Kephalaion 70-, Chinese Tractate (Cha- vannes and Pelliot 1911: 559). 148.

Yet Sundermann 1973, text 6 refers to four walls. 149. "And in the four regions (MPers. kiswar ) he set up four angels that hold the lowest firmament corre- sponding and clad like the upper ones" (M99.I.V. 12-16; Hutter 1992: 16; cf. Jackson 1932: 36-37); cf. Sunder- mann 1973: text 7, lines 1114-24. 150. "And in order to sweep away the refuse of the darkness of the four regions, he constructed twelve hells by threes in each district (MPers. pãy gõ s )" (M99.I.V.16-19; Hutter 1992: 16-17; cf. Jackson 1932: 36-37). For further discussion on the concept, see Jack- son 1932: 65-66. The same sweeping operation is de- scribed in kephalaia 42, 43, and 45, but featuring only three pits, one each for water, darkness, and fire,- cf. Sundermann 1973, text 6, lines 1050-69. 151.

This "black mountain" is mentioned, e.g., in 2 Ps 210.1, 10, and 21. Cf. Mt. Harā (also called Haraiti and Hukairya, Yašt 10.13, 50, 88, 118; 12.25) in the Avestan tradition, and Mt. Sumeru in Vedic tradition. In both traditions, the imposition of the mountain between the sun rotating around it and the surface of the earth is related to the passing of day and night. Familiarity with this concept is evident in the description given in 1 Ke 43, 112.6-9: "this black mountain that exists in the surroundings of the sunrise. For when the sun would shine over the world no sunlight is visible there, because the dark- ness that gushes from it manifests above it" (trans. Gardner 1995: 117). The imagery of this passage was perhaps suggested by a pun in MPers. between tīrāg "peak" and tārīg "dark." In 1 Enoch 17, Enoch is taken to a mountain whose "summit was reaching into heaven." 154. 1 Ke 43, 112.3-5. 155. Sundermann 2001c: 181-99.

At the time of its discovery, this now-lost painting was already highly fragmentary and came be preserved only by a hand-drawn field copy and descrip- tion published in Le Coq 1923: 8, which was inter- preted with the aid of a digital diagram in 2009. This scene retains parts of eight figures from the central and right edges of the original composition: a Jesus figure with a cross, who was seated below another prophet (most likely the Historical Buddha) and to the lower right of a large central figure (the Light Mind); two from the originally four boys, seated around the lotus throne of the central figure,- and three from a row of lay figures at the bottom of the scene. Jesus is identified by his processional cross on a staff resting on his left shoulder - an accessory routinely used in early Chris- tian portrayals of Jesus. The two prophets on the left side (Zoroaster and Mani) did not survive. For an over- view, see Gulácsi 2009a: figs. 16d-f. 168. This central "black mountain" of Manichaean cosmology (Parth. smyr or smyrw) is depicted here with a distinctly Buddhist iconography of Mt. Sumeru, as first noted by Yoshida (2010: 10). 169. Given the close association of Enochic sources with this portion of the cosmology, one notes in 1 Enoch 24-25 the sage's tour of a "tall mountain . . . whose sum- mit resembles the throne of God ... on which the holy and great lord of glory, the eternal king (in its original context, clearly God himself), will sit when he descends to visit the earth with goodness" (1 Enoch 25.3). The lo- cation is also notable for the presence of a fragrant tree, whose "leaves, its flowers, and its wood would never wither forever,- its fruit is beautiful and resembles the clustered fruits of a palm tree" ( 1 Enoch 24.4). The Qum- ran fragments of the Enochic Book of Giants culminate with the subjugation of the offspring on the watchers by someone who "imprisoned us and has power over us" (see Reeves 1992: 66). In Aves tan literature, Mithra is enthroned atop Mt. Harā (Yašt 10.50). But another tradi- tion refers to the presence there of Hošang (Haošiiaqha), the first king of the world, who "offered a sacrifice on the peak of Harā ... on a golden throne, under golden beams and a golden canopy" (Yašt 15.7). He sacrificed to Aši, requesting: "Grant me this . . . that I may overcome all the daevas . . . that all the daevas may fear and bow in spite of themselves before me" (Yašt 17.25). These traditions may be relevant for the figure portrayed at the summit of the world mountain here. As another possi- bility, the figure may represent the "Great King," a reflex of Jesus, who reigns from his throne over the world in its final millennium before its destruction (Horn 21.33- 39.21); on some of the difficulties of this passage, see Pedersen 1996: 320-38. 170. See Yoshida 2010: 10b. 171. On the silk fragment from Turf an, their iconog- raphy evokes their status as novices: they are shown with the bodies of boys with characteristic juvenile haircuts of the region, dressed in what appears to be the garments of elects without any headgears, and positioned sitting on their heels with hands clasped in worship directed towards the Light Mind. Alter- natively, Yoshida suggested that the child figures and their lay worshipers in the cosmology fragment may represent a child who died young and its parents. In his opinion, the couple depicted four times in this way could be the donors of this painting (Yoshida 2010: 20b with n. 85). 172. In 1 Enoch 10.4-5, Azazel has "rugged and sharp rocks" thrown upon him by the angel Raphael, whereas AzazePs demonic partner, Shemihazah, remains free and active, and in the Midrash of Shemhazai and Azael he demonstrates his repentance by suspending himself between heaven and earth (Reeves 1992: pp. 86 and 144, n. 171). Yoshida interprets this figure as the demon de- prived of its skin and body, from which was fashioned the skies and earths (Yoshida 2010: 11 ); but the figure is too incidental to represent this primordial giant. 173. See BeDuhn 2014. Alternatively, Yoshida identi- fies these figures with the four archangels described in a Sogdian text as pursuing the giants in the region of Mt. Sumeru (see Yoshida forthcoming). 174. 2 Ps 138.41-42. 175. 1 Ke 45, 116.21-22 (trans. Gardner 1995: 122). 176. M472.I.V.6-1 1 (MacKenzie 1979: 512-13). 177. M98.I.V.8-17 (Hutter 1992: 12-13). 178.

Kósa 2013: 72-73, hypothe- sizes that this grouping may depict Primal Man, stripped of his elemental "armor/7 greeted by the Mother of Life and the Living Spirit. But the rescue of Primal Man oc- curs prior to the construction of the cosmos, and so is unlikely to be featured in the Diagram of the Universe, which depicts the cosmos as it exists following its for- mation, and does not portray episodes of the primordial conflict prior to that time. An alternative reference could be to the mission of Adamas to "assist" (Gr. boēthein ) the "Youth" in "the pit that is at the bottom of Hades" in the fourth Psalm of Thomas (2 Ps 209.11-210.16) by fettering the demons in a manner very close to how they are shown fettered here in the painting: fetters on feet, iron on hands, and collar on neck (2 Ps 209.29-210.1, 210.7-9). Note the diminutive size of the stripped figure, perhaps intending a youth. Yet, against this interpreta- tion, one notes that this youth faces not one, but two fig- ures, neither of which is depicted like the Adamas figure on the surface of the eighth earth. 192. Another valuable approach to interpreting this painting is offered by comparing it specifically to Chi- nese Manichaean texts, including the newly discovered corpus of "Xiapu manuscripts," which reflect local cul- tural adaptation directly relevant to that found in the painting. See forthcoming publications by Yoshida, Kósa, and Xiaohe Ma in the "Proceedings from the 8th International Congress of Manichaean Studies Sep- tember 22-24, 2013, London, England," ed. E. Hunter (Leiden: Brill, forthcoming). 193. Mair 1988: 1-16; and Kaminishi 2006: 103-8. 194. For a discussion of these two display formats in Manichaean art, see Gulácsi 2011: 240-62. 195. For studies focusing on this question, see Yo- shida 2010: 4a-5a; Kósa 2013: 49-84; Yoshida 2015: 389-98; as well as Yoshida forthcoming and Gulácsi forthcoming. Bibliography Allberry 1938 C. R. C.
