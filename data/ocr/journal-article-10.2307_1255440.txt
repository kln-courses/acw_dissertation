The Belief among the Aborig- ines of Australia, the Torres Straits Islands, New Guinea and Melanesia. (The Gifford Lectures, St. Andrews, 19II-2.) Macmillan &amp; Co., 1913. 8vo, pp. xxi+ 495. Ios. n. ALL Dr. Frazer's works are a source both of pleasure and profit to the reader; the present work is pleasant even to the reviewer. Unfatigued by his great work on the history and theory of tote- mism, Dr. Frazer has embarked on a still greater task, the exposi- tion of the beliefs and practices of the primitive and advanced races of the earth in regard to the dead. As a master in the method and art of collecting, selecting, and grouping the facts upon which the great world-inductions of anthropology might be based, he has no rivals; and he shows himself here, as he has in his former achievements, capable of carrying a project through which might appear t6-demand a syndicate of collaborateurs, and of conducting it single-handed better than any syndicate could. In this new field, which promises to yield an inestimable harvest to social anthropology, his prima vindemiatio is this first volume. It displays all the best qualities, both in respect of style and matter, that characterise his former works, together with a certain reserve and sobriety in theorising that is sometimes lacking in certain chapters of The Golden Bough. The first object of this new magnum opus is to present us with the facts, to fill a great gap in what we may call sociological history: and the first necessary step is the survey of the existing or the recently recorded primitive races of mankind. Dr. Frazer has here presented us with the</page><page sequence="2">Reviews. 387 relevant phenomena of Australia, the Torres Straits Islands, New Guinea, and Melanesia, a wide region full of varied and typical forms of savage life. What, perhaps, at first sight impresses us most is the remarkable monotony of the subject-matter, due to the close similarity in belief and funeral rites prevalent among so many societies far removed from each other. This monotony, which will probably be felt all the more strongly when the other volumes have come to light, is relieved by Dr. Frazer's clear and pleasant style, with its occasional humour and archness, and in any case would not repel the scientific reader. For it is a fact of high value for the general anthropologist that certain phenomena such as death, excite the same or similar feelings in the greater part of mankind, and that similarity of feeling suggests identical rites and customs. Also this prevailing monotony adds interest tot the occasional and not unimportant diversities, which attest free thought and possibilities of progress. It is not the object of this notice to question or to criticise the value or the authenticity of the sources from which Dr. Frazer draws. He himself is sufficiently careful in this matter, and the width of his reading fills us with wonder. Yet the investigator of a special field generally finds something to correct in the work of his predecessor. And our author might have dealt differently with the Fijian Kalou, a term which he interprets as "god" (p. 440), if he had read Mr. Hocart's excellent article in The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute for 1912. But the question of Quellen-Kritik will be most urgent when he comes to deal with the ancient advanced societies of the Mediterranean area. Here an easy-going and uncritical acceptance of all ancient authorities would be fatal. And this hint may not be untimely, in view of Dr. Frazer's statement on p. I59, "Every year the Pelo- ponnesian lads lashed themselves on the grave of Pelops at Olympia, till the blood ran down their backs as a libation in honour of the dead man "; a rite which he compares with funeral mutilation in Western Australia. The Australian record is true: the Greek is entirely bogus, being one of the latest and most ignorant of the generally admirable and ancient scholia on Pindar, the invention probably of a late Byzantine scholiast who could not understand the word a'laKovpla, but remembered the</page><page sequence="3">388 Reviews. Lycurgean flogging of the boys at Sparta, and may have thought that the ancient Peloponnese was a political whole. But the main object of the present notice is to estimate the value of the facts that Dr. Frazer has here set forth for general anthropology, and for the purposes of comparative religion. Much of his collection of data possesses undoubtedly a great intrinsic interest, whatever light it may throw on the development of some of the higher forms of faith and ritual. We are enabled to realise, for instance, how widespread is the fallacy that all sickness and death is an unnatural and abnormal event, due to the witchcraft of the enemy or the malevolence of the ghost. We may take such a belief as marking a line of cleavage between a civilised and an uncivilised people; yet it does not immediately vanish with the spread of civilisation; the Greek world had practically escaped from it by the dawn of the historical period, but the Babylonian remained susceptible to particular forms of the illusion. Its deadly social effects will be appreciated by Dr. Frazer's readers. Accord- ing to the logic of the belief, every death, however timely and natural, involves the retributive murder of someone else; and the superstition is a force that tends to race-suicide. Fortunately some savage tribes show a progressive spirit even in such a hope- less situation as this: they find a way to avenge the vindictive ghost without kindling a tribal vendetta. Dr. Frazer's account on pp. 280-282 of the methods whereby the Kai tribe in German New Guinea combine murder with bogus-tricks to deceive the ghost is one of the most humorous passages in anthropological literature. He also discovers the same motive, the desire to deceive the ghost, in that interesting custom of arranging a sham fight, in which blood is sometimes shed, but not dangerously, between two parties of the same tribe or of adjacent tribes, on the occasion of the death of an important personage. He quotes three examples from Australia, German New Guinea, and Southern Melanesia. He probably has noted and will quote in another volume an example of the same rite among the Bangala people of the Upper Congo.1 He suggests that this ritual, which is certainly not dramatic or commemorative of any story about the dead man, is a humane legal fiction, whereby the ghost is deluded into believing that his 1 The Journal of the Royal Anth/ropological Institute, vol. xl. (1910), p. 378.</page><page sequence="4">Reviews. 389 kinsfolk are avenging him very thoroughly, while they are merely amusing themselves with his supposed murderers. His suggestion of motive may be right in these cases; but it could not be naturally applied to two Hellenic parallels, of which he may be aware, though he has not mentioned them. In the Ilomeric hymn to Demeter the goddess promises in honour of her foster- ling Demiphon, that " over him at fixed seasons as the years roll round the sons of the Eleusinians shall always join in battle and the fell war-shout."2 I have pointed out what appears to be the only possible explanation of this mysterious blessing, that the Eleusinians are to institute a yearly ritual in honour of Demiphon, which is to include a sham-fight over his grave; and that another parallel is the Argive XWopoX[tc, where the people joined in two parties and threw stones at each other in honour of the dead maidens Damia and Auxesia. Now Demiphon is no warlike figure of Epic Saga, but probably a peaceful vegetation-hero, and the mysterious maidens, Damia and Auxesia, are revealed by their names as vegetation-goddesses.3 It is against all the evidence to explain these two ceremonies as dictated by the desire to avenge the vindictive ghost; they belong rather to the sphere of vegeta- tion-magic: blood shed over the grave of vegetation-heroes or heroines quickens their powers of fertility.4 The savage illusion about death, from which we ourselves have not yet wholly escaped, engenders the belief that mankind were originally not intended to die, but that their doom of mortality was due to some accident, some mistake, or some malevolent trick of an animal or a human being. In fact a few savage myths, among the many that Dr. Frazer quotes (pp. 58-86), resemble the Biblical story of Genesis still more closely, and attribute the mis- fortune to some human disobedience of a divine behest (p. 79, the Baganda of Central Africa), or to some sin of mankind (p. 70, the Arawaks of British Guiana), and in many of the aboriginal stories it is a woman who causes the trouble.

Cherokee Indians (p. 77) is interesting as showing the type to which the Hesiodic story of Pandora's box belongs. Only, it is well worth remarking that the Hesiodic version is different from these aboriginal stories that were floating round the world; Pan- dora's opened box let out a number of evils, but not death, which had always been in the world of men, even in Hesiod's sinless and happiest generation of the golden men, to whom death comes as a sleep. There is no recorded Greek myth that explains the origin of death or that reveals such an illusion in the mythopoeic mind of Hellas as that death was not part of the cosmic human plan but came in as an unintended accident. Greek folklore possessed, long before Euripides, a personal Thanatos, such a figure as plays a part in the stories of the Baganda, the Bantu tribe, and the Melanesians of Banks' Island; and it could imagine a clever man like Sisyphos bottling up Death for a few years, during which time nobody died; but it rose above the savage level in that it did not delude itself about the general lot of mortality. Nearly all the myths reflect the pathetic feeling that death is an evil. Only one, in vogue among the Melanesians of the Banks' Islands, rises in this respect to a higher point of view, and reflects the idea expressed by our most modern science, that death is a social-economic advantage to our species (p. 83). The greater number of the funeral ceremonies, which are generally quaint and elaborate and occasionally most repulsive, are attributed by Dr. Frazer to one ruling motive, the fear of the ghost. This is certainly a very widespread, perhaps the predominating, sentiment in the savage mind. But sometimes it seems quite inadequate to explain the ceremony which he supposes it to inspire; for instance, the strange custom of the women scourging the men at the funeral of the Fijian chief (p. 452). Also, the critical reader may feel that he attributes too much to it as the ruling fmotive, and too little to affection and real sorrow. The violent and morbid outbursts of lamentation accompanied with self- laceration need not be due to the hypocritical desire to persuade a formidable ghost that the relatives were really very sorry for him and loved him deeply in life, so that he may refrain from haunting them now: in view of the unstable emotional equilibrium of the savage, a simple feeling of sorrow may manifest itself in ritual 390</page><page sequence="6">Reviews. 39I forms of violent exaggeration, just as in a weak person laughter tends to hysterics. That the fear of the dead, while being a coarser emotion, is also more primeval than the emotion of sorrow or affection in regard to them is not clearly proved by this treatise; and the not uncommon custom in savage communities of burying within or near the house of the living points to affection rather than fear; the various rites that appear to aim at effecting a com- munion with the dead are not normally explicable as prompted by fear (e.g. pp. 205, 315). The sympathetic reader may also note at times a lacuna in Dr. Frazer's theoretic equipment, and may feel that the phenomena could be sometimes explained without the aid of any ghost-theory at all: for instance, the feeling of the impurity of death, the horror of bloodshed, which compel the relatives of the dead to be under a tabu, or the warriors returning from a victorious massacre to be purified, do not postulate the presence of the haunting ghost, but may arise from a preanimistic instinct of revulsion and may for long be sustained by it alone. But from most points of view the exposition is broad-minded and well-balanced. Dr. Frazer emphasises eloquently the grim and devastating results of ghost-faith and ghost-ritual; but he is fully sensible of its social advantages as a bond of family union and the preservative of family morality (e.g. pp. I34, 175). Even savage eschatology, uncouth and barren of morality as it usually is, has occasionally a moral value; on one of the Banks' Islands we meet with an ethical theory of rewards and punishments after death higher than that of the Homeric Greek (p. 354). According to some of the Kai in German New Guinea the ghosts must be purified from stain before they enter the happy land; and we have here the germ of the Orphic-Christian concept of Purgatory. The present volume already contributes much, either by way of positive or negative evidence, to certain current religious or anthro- pological controversies and problems. Dr. Frazer has collected sufficient evidence to show, (a), that the same people at the same period may practise such different modes of disposing of the dead as cremation and burial; therefore a certain ethnologic criterion much applied to the Mediterranean races loses its credit: (b), that the same people at the same period can hold entirely contradictory</page><page sequence="7">Reviews. ideas about the place and lot of the ghost, and that such self-contra- diction is a mark of the primitive mind: therefore Rohde's view in his Psyche that Homer's picture of Hades and the fate of the ghost is irreconcilable with ghost-cult is untrue to human nature; (c), that a powerful ghost of a once-living man may often incarnate itself in an animal and that this animal will be temporarily reverenced; therefore theriolatry and theriomorphism is not a stage of religion that necessarily preceded anthropomorphism; the god may have been a man first, a beast afterwards, and simultaneously man and beast. Finally, the theory of the origin of Tragedy from the mimetic representations at the funerals of great men can draw no single piece of valid evidence from Dr. Frazer's book. Our author has wisely kept in reserve his own larger inductions: but one can discern the theory in his mind that ghost-cult has generated much of the ritual and forms of higher religion. We must wait for his later volumes before we try to test this question. LEWIS R. FARNELL. NOTES AND QUERIES ON ANTHROPOLOGY. Fourth Edition. Edited by B. FREIRE-MARRECO and J. L. MYRES.

WHILE reading the above book my regret was great that I did not meet with it twenty years ago, when I first began to take notes on anthropology. It would have aided me considerably in any work I have done, and would undoubtedly have enhanced the value of that work by helping to a more scientific investigation of the subject. I cannot speak too highly of the suggestions it offers to the student for consideration, nor can I commend it too heartily to my colleagues in Africa, or to those who are living and working, in one capacity or another, among primitive peoples in any part of the world. It will suggest topics for study, will keep the enquirer on the right lines, and help the student to arrive at the heart of things.
