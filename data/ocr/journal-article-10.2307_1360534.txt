<plain_text><page sequence="1">Echoing Narcissus in Alberti's Della Pittura CRISTELLE L. BASKINS Leon Battista Alberti wrote two versions of his treatise on painting: the Latin Depictura of 1435 and the vernacular Della pittura of 1436.1 The treatise is organized, in each case, into three books treating in turn, geometry and perspective, the foundations of painting, and the elements of istoria or narrative painting. It is well established by now that the Della pittura is a work of Humanist rhetoric with literary, pedagogical and ethical aspirations rather than a painter's handbook in the tradition of Cennino Cennini's The Book of the Art of Painting?. The most outstanding feature distinguishing Alberti's text from artisanal guides is his reference to classical authors, especially to Quintillian, Cicero and to Pliny. Equally ambitious and unprecedented in Alberti's Della pittura is the ascription of the origins of painting to Narcissus, a figure derived ultimately from Ovid's Metamorphoses.3 Rather than linking his text on painting to practical artists' manuals, Alberti turns to a Latin poem celebrating the instability of the world in constant flux, where origins or founding acts are most often of a violent kind, including rape, incest, and murder. This turn to pagan mythology is not unique in Alberti's theoretical writing; H. Jan- son suggests, for example, that Alberti's account of the invention of sculpture from anthropomorphic tree trunks in the De statua reverses 'the well-known myth of Daphne turned into a laurel tree'.4 But: 'as a privileged mode of signifying, the recounting of a mythical tale within a literary text reveals concerns, whether conscious or unconscious, which are basic to that text'.5 Alberti creates a new genre when writing about painting in the Della pittura, calling attention to and gendering his self-conscious innova- tion by creating a new founding myth figuring Narcissus as the inventor of painting. The Della pittura locates itself in a humanist intertextual community, rewriting or subjecting classical sources to a textual appropriation in part to establish authority among professional and social rivals in republican Florence.6 Posed against the Utopian dream of literary men and painters working together to produce inventions in painting (i.e. istorie) are Alberti's allusions to a contentious public and its potential objections.7 His critics presumably were eager to limit painting to the status of craft, to oppose its elevation to a liberal art. The Della pittura constitutes itself then as an adversarial or potentially embattled text produced for friends; an inner circle of like-minded colleagues and disciplines defined in opposition to the detractors, critics, rivals and nemici. The 'autobiographical imagination' at work in the THE OXFORD ARTJOURNAL - 16:1 1993 treatise through the figure of Narcissus forms part of the defensive repertory of the Humanist author as much as it attests to Alberti's subjectivity or self.8 Mark Jarzonibek explains that: 'Alberti's autobio- graphical methodology stands nearer the medieval idea of exempla, of patterns that repeat themselves again and again, and thus aims beyond a designa- tion of individual reality ... Initially Alberti may have developed his autobiographical character in order to extrapolate an image of himself as writer, but almost from the beginning he homed in on the tension between author, text, and society.'9 Narciss- us, the exemplum of painting and apparently a figure of invention in the Della pittura, also exemplifies the tensions in Alberti's vision of the social position and function of the artist/author. In the opening lines of Book II, after noting that 'painting possesses a truly divine power... not only does it make the absent present ... but it also represents the dead to the living' and that painters 'feel themselves to be almost like the creator', Alberti turns to his aggressively innovative account of the creation of painting: Consequently I used to tell my friends that the inventor of painting, according to the poets, was Narcissus, who was turned into a flower; for, as painting is the flower of all the arts, so the tale of Narcissus fits our purpose perfectly. What is painting but the act of embracing by means of art the surface of the pool? Although Alberti refers to the 'tale' of Narcissus, his account in fact allegorizes rather than narrates the death of Ovid's tragic lover. Narcissus appears in the Della pittura as an exemplar of painting rather than the vainly self-obsessed protagonist of the Metamor- phoses.l In addition, Alberti conflates two aspects of Narcissus' transformation; the flower and the reflection in the pool both seem to signify the mimetic surface of painting. Alberti fails to articulate the relation between Narcissus' flowery remains and his ephemeral reflection; as tropes of vision, objects of the gaze, either the flower or the reflection can be considered Narcissus' invention. The flower consti- tutes a material or physical invention of the body, the invention of the Narcissus flower in Ovid's poem. The reflection, on the other hand, is caused by the body but is fleeting, disembodied, only visible in the pool as long as Narcissus gazes at himself.1' Narcissus transformed into a flower can only be the object of another viewer's attention while Narcissus' reflection is available only to his own gaze. The reflection then serves to delay or defer the narrative 25</page><page sequence="2">closure of the Metamorphoses, creating a dilatory space of desire unlike the metamorphosed Narcissus flower heralding the conclusion of the tale and the euhemeristic function of Ovid's mythology.12 Alberti's allegorical Narcissus derives its impact in contrast with Ovid's narrative. In the Metamorphoses Narcissus first rejects the all-too-willing nymph Echo and then speaks amorously to his own reflection before eventually recognizing its source. Ovid thus constructs the story around a conflict of gender and object choice: So thin the veil [of water] we almost touch each other,... come to me no matter who you are, O lovely boy, why do you glide from me, where do you vanish when I come to meet you? ... Even as I reach, your arms almost embrace me, and as I smile you smile again at me; weeping I've seen great tears flow down your face; I bend my head toward you, you nod at me, and I believe that from the movement of your lips (though nothing's heard) you seem to answer me. ...13 Ovid then concludes: 'so did Narcissus wear away with love, drained, fading ... his body vanished. They saw a flower of gold with white-brimmed petals.' The rejected nymph Echo also vanishes, as she is transformed into a disembodied voice. Now while the comparison of these two passages from Alberti and Ovid indicates just how selective and idiosyncratic the appearance of Narcissus as inven- tor in the Della pittura is, the intriguing fact is that Alberti's account of the invention of painting has passed largely unchallenged into the canonical texts of art history.14 What factors have encouraged the acceptance of Narcissus as the exemplar of pictorial mimesis? The canonical interpretation of the Narcissus trope in Alberti takes the reflection in the pool to be analogous to the imitation of surface appearance; stripped of narrative components and concentrating on the physical property of water to reflect an image in the real world, Narcissus' reflection apparently corroborates our understanding of the naturalistic, illusionistic goals of early Renaissance painting.15 Second, Alberti's euhemerist appeal to Narcissus accords with a historiographic notion of fifteenth- century Italy privileging Humanist scholarship and the reclamation of the textual tradition of Greece and Rome. In this formulation, Cennini's invocation in the Book of the Art of Painting to God the Father, Christ, the Virgin and saints represents a 'mediev- alism' at odds with the secularizing 'classicism' of Alberti's textual borrowing in the Della pittura.16 In its most optimistic formulation, Renaissance classicism promises freedom from constraints both personal and institutional; Leonard Barkan sum- marizes the idealizing position based on Burck- hardt: 'The orthodoxy involved in intellectual or creative activity of a purely Christian kind limits the imagination by requiring all sorts of right answers, whereas newly rediscovered classical materials, free of official sanctions, place no such limit on the 26 imagination.'7 If Alberti's idealized Narcissus represents free engagement with the past, we should also recall Anthony Grafton's suggestion that: '[t]he rediscovery of the classical tradition in the Renais- sance was as much an act of imagination as of criticism, as much an invention as a rediscovery'.18 Third, Alberti's classical concetto, the association of painting and Narcissus, provides a witty, inter- textual reference, a self-conscious marshalling of classical sources, which we have both come to expect as a corollary of Renaissance Humanism and to value as an indicator of authorial genius.19 These three factors - mimetic metaphor, Renaissance classicism, and the aggressive authorial stance of Humanism - have blunted the unexpected and radical nature of Alberti's ascription of the invention of painting to Narcissus. The location of the origins of painting in a mythological figure and in a narrative of frustrated desire, death and homosocial, perhaps homoerotic, themes has been overlooked in favour of a rationalized academic theory of mimetic, illusionistic painting.20 Several factors encourage a reassessment of the idiosyncratic and willful quality of Alberti's Narcis- sus. First, Alberti's forefathers, the authoritative texts of the early or proto-Humanists - Dante, Petrarca and Boccaccio - mitigate against Narcissus' pic- torial function. These writers insist that Narcissus figures worldly fame, materialism, loss and sterility rather than innovation or creativity.21 Here is Petrarca in the 'Secret': Hasn't the story of Narcissus frightened you? ... you content yourself with gazing only at the external aspect of the body without fixing the eyes of the mind on the corruption within ... It should have shown you plain as day the ceaseless passing of time which every day plucks another flower.22 Petrarca forcefully sums up the prevailing literary view of Narcissus before Alberti; all previous and subsequent accounts emphasize that Narcissus falls in love with a mere reflection, mistaking appearance for reality, and that he dies, transforming into a frail ephemeral flower. Only Alberti willfully, perhaps ironically, interprets that flower as a positive rem- nant, or trace, analogous to a picture. If Alberti's Narcissus shares little with his literary ancestors, visual sources for his appearance in the Della pittura are scarce. While fifteenth-century Florentine artists would paint some of the istoria subjects that Alberti discusses in Books II and III of the Della pittura, the 'Three Graces' and the 'Calumny of Apelles', for example, Narcissus only becomes a popular subject for painting in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and then he appears primarily as a tragic lover rather than as the inventor of painting.23 When Giorgio Vasari came to decorate his house in Florence between 1569 and 1573 with the origins of painting and its ancient paragons, he showed a male figure tracing the outline of a shadow and one of the most famous THE OXFORD ARTJOURNAL- 16:1 1993</page><page sequence="3">painters in antiquity, Apelles, rather than Narcis- sus.24 In a late sixteenth-century print by Antonio Tempesta, Narcissus' cast shadow is assumed to be continuous with the reflection on the water's surface which is hidden by the fountain.25 Alberti, of course, knew the 'shadow theory' illustrated in Vasari's fresco of the origin of painting and adapted by Tempesta's print; but after he introduces Narcissus as inventor, Alberti gives short shrift to the more traditional account found in Quintillian and in Pliny: 'Quintillian believed that the earliest painters used to draw around shadows made by the sun, and the art eventually grew by a process of additions.26 After a self-consciously innovative account of Narcissus' invention of paint- ing, Alberti then makes the following disclaimer, a statement all the more ironic since it is also made by Pliny: 'But it is of little concern to us to discover the first painters or the inventors of the art, since we are not writing a history of painting like Pliny, but treating of the art in an entirely new way.'27 Although Alberti downplays the 'shadow theory', he nevertheless champions outline or circumscrip- tion in the Della pittura and in his treatise on sculpture.28 Novelty rather than historiography is Alberti's stated aim; in the Della pittura the invention of painting is disassociated from the mechanical tracing of a shadow and reconceived as the chance effect of a failed 'homoerotic' encounter.29 The fortuitous or accidental production of Narcissus' reflection in the pool creates the maximum contrast to Alberti's deliberate, intellectualized, and systema- tic account of the fundamentals of painting grounded in optics, grammar, and rhetoric.30 By subsuming the 'shadow theory' into the reflective mimesis figured by Narcissus, Alberti rewrites antiquity and emphasizes his new rational pro- gramme, but his literary innovation, his intertextual turn to Ovid, also posits frustrated desire as the motivating force in the invention of painting. Alberti's brief reference to the 'shadow theory' acknowledges the overdetermined nature of accounts of the invention of painting in antiquity. In the Natural History, Pliny, like Quintillian, notes that painting 'began with tracing an outline around a man's shadow'; but later on in Book 35 he tells the story of Butades, a potter of Sicyon, and his daugh- ter.31 In a kind of artistic collaboration, Butades invents portrait sculpture by applying clay to the outline which his daughter had traced around her lover's shadow on the wall. Thus outline, circum- scription, and picturing give birth to sculpture. The daughter, who came to be known as Dibutades, traces the outline of her lover because he is about to depart.32 Like Narcissus then, Dibutades' imitation of form is grounded in erotic desire and imminent loss; unlike Narcissus, however, Dibutades and her invention of portraiture are 'fathered', framed by the conventions of heterosexual (pro)creation.33 Alberti's certain familiarity with Pliny's account of Dibutades argues a strategic turn to Narcissus in the THE OXFORD ART JOURNAL - 16:1 1993 Della pittura. Whereas Pliny overdetermines the invention of art, noting both the 'shadow theory' and the collaborative 'conception' of Butades and Dibutades, Alberti's text limits pictorial invention to male parthenogenesis.34 Since Echo does not appear in the Della pittura, Narcissus figures generativity or invention as an exclusively male prerogative for Alberti's audience of exclusively male patrons and students.35 Narcissus, the self-fashioning father of painting, usurps genealogy just as in the dialogue, De Iciarchia (1468), Alberti imagines that the teacher of virtue functions as the 'true and best father' or padre in contrast to the merely biological father, or babbo.36 In this gendered hierarchy of values mental invention and instruction create ex novo liberated from materia, the sexual body.37 Alberti's use of Narcissus is strategically idio- syncratic because it differs from other Humanist texts, because fifteenth-century painters do not depict Narcissus as the inventor of painting, and because Narcissus represents a parthenogenic, exclusively masculine creativity in contrast to the traditional metaphoric association of procreation and literary or artistic creation. But in yet another idiosyncratic move in the Della pittura Alberti imagines a scenario in which he can play out narcissistic self-speculation attended by fame and reputation in a projected future. At the conclusion of Book III, Alberti says that if his treatise is, 'of some use and convenience to painters, I would especially ask them as a reward for my labours to paint my portrait in their istorie, and thereby to proclaim to posterity that I was a student of this art and that they are mindful of and grateful for this favour'.38 Alberti appears not only as a kind of cameo portrait in the text but also as the recipient of the adulation of the painter pupils 'fathered' by him; their pictures will reflect his likeness but their pictorial means will also reflect the prescriptions of the treatise.39 Like Narcissus' pool in relation to the frustrated lover, the treatise becomes an 'acoustic mirror' of Humanist fame reflecting and publicizing its author. Like the Narcissus flower, the Della pittura is a material object which survives and aestheticizes its author's death. By imagining pictures which will contain his like- ness in the future, Alberti projects the possibility of his own narcissistic encounter. But in this scenario he also invokes and surpasses his source, the Meta- morphoses; whereas Ovid claims to grant eternal fame through his text, Alberti's text confers fame first upon its own author while it anticipates the fame conferred by the painters of the hypothetical future frescoes containing his portrait.40 In this paragone between word and image Alberti enjoys omnipot- ence both as the author of the treatise and as the primary, privileged viewer and subject of the future frescoes. The logic of Alberti's ascription of the origins of painting to Narcissus is guided then by his authorial identification with the mythological figure; similar in his isolation, alterity and solitary crea- tivity, Alberti finds himself momentarily mirrored in 27</page><page sequence="4">and transformed by Narcissus.41 Yet Alberti's 'auto- biographical imagination' proves to be restless, dissatisfied, no sooner constructing an alter-ego than dismantling it and exposing its faults through the filters of gender and sexuality. Echo as Palimpsest If Petrarca treats Narcissus' eventual transformation into a flower as an emblem of transience, Boccaccio moralizes Echo's transformation into a persevering repetition of the spoken word as good reputation in contrast to vainglory: For in Echo, who does not say anything except after something said before, I see reputation, which loves all mortals because it is through them that it is upheld. Many shrink from it and despise it and look into the water, that is worldly pleasures which are unstable like the water, where they can see themselves, that is their own glory, and are so ensnared by their pleasures that they pour contempt on reputation and die before long, as if they never existed.42 The anonymous figure ensnared by his own glory in Boccaccio's allegory can only be Narcissus while Echo enjoys the positive function of upholding good reputation. Against Boccaccio's reading of Ovid's myth, Narcissus' status as solitary inventor in the Della pittura requires the suppression of the female protagonist of the Ovidian tale. Not merely rejected by the haughty Narcissus as in the Metamorphoses, in the Della pittura Echo is effaced, under 'erasure', from her customary literary function as Fame or commemoration. Echo is not a common subject in fifteenth-century painting, but she does appear on a panel that once formed part of an anonymous fifteenth-century Florentine bride's chest or cassone (Fig. 1).43 The cassone panel pairs Echo and a female companion at the left, behind or looking over a rocky barrier, with Narcissus gazing into the stream at the right. She stares in profile toward him while he looks down- .. *, /. 4 .. b ' *'. / - ' i Fig. 1. Anonymous: 'Narcissus' formerly Dayton Art Institute, location now unknown. (Photo: Rollyn Puterbaugh.) THE OXFORD ART JOURNAL - 16:1 1993 28</page><page sequence="5">ward, shielding his face with his hand. Rather than depicting his moralized transformation as a flower, the anonymous cassone panel concentrates on the reciprocal or mutual gazing of Narcissus and his reflection, with a circuit of desire excluding Echo.44 Other versions of this scene appearing on cassoni leave Echo out altogether; in the Paris Master example (Fig. 2) and the anonymous panel once in the Lanckoronski collection (Fig. 3) Narcissus faces no distraction from Echo but rather concentrates solely on his own double, on the reflected image.45 Given the function of cassoni as dowry chests and family propaganda, as totems of patrilineal hopes for future offspring, how did fifteenth-century viewers understand such an image of male indifference to heterosexual union?46 Could such images function as admonitions to young husbands to turn from same-sex pleasures in order to avoid Narcissus' tragic fate, as in the moralizing literary tradition? James Saslow, commenting on the illustration of another similar homoerotic image illustrated on domestic furniture, hypothesizes that: 'whatever the precise intent of the cassone scheme, the presence of Ganymede on a bridal chest suggests that male homosexuality was somehow acknowledged as a potential factor in the relations between husband and wife'.47 Whether viewed as an apprenticeship for single men or as an ongoing sexual fact regardless of marriage, homoeroticism is veiled yet confirmed through mythological painting.48 But a further consideration of the function of Narcissus' reflection in relation to Echo in the anonymous cassone panel destabilizes any literal reading of homoeroticism (Fig. 1).49 Like Alberti, the French poet Jean Froissart (fl. 1338-1410) rewrote *.lf??~:; ' . e e 9'' ' s t ? :5* ,,.ZsS f'. ..

Anonymous: 'Narcissus' formerly Lanckoronski collection, Vienna, location now unknown. (Photo: author.) Ovid; his poem Le Joli Buisson de Jonece (On Youth) actually transposes Echo for the reflection that Narcissus sees when he looks into the pool.50 Froissart's strategic substitution enforces com- pulsory heterosexuality but it also registers, in its prioritization of substance over reflection, the logic of Renaissance gender hierarchy. Woman is to surface as man is to substance, D. K. Hedrick persuasively argues, in Alberti's gendered distinc- tion between ornament, surface, the supplementary and primary structure in architecture.51 Narcissus the inventor of painting is also a flower, an orna- ment, a surface reflection of substance and hence feminized. Whereas the mutual gazing initially posits male to male attraction, the feminine coding of the reflection qualifies the staging of homoerotic desire. A late fifteenth-century ceiling panel attributed to Girolamo Mocetto further testifies to what Judith Butler calls 'gender troubling', a performative and hence mobile gender identification (Fig. 4).52 Echo, a would-be 'woman on top', pursues Narcissus in the middleground but the foreground is occupied by the hypnotic self-regard of the youth at a river bank. In Mocetto's version of the story Narcissus' reflection appears not just before his gaze but between his spread legs as if to parody childbirth. In this case, the capacity for giving birth signalled by the emerging reflection feminizes Narcissus. That the reflection of Narcissus encodes the 'feminine', even if it is not literally transformed as in Froissart's poem, is borne out by Robert Baldwin's analysis of mirror imagery in Renaissance art. The mirror or reflection is a Petrarchan metaphor for sexualized vision in hetero- sexual terms, again based on a surface versus substance distinction: the lady's mirror arouses the envy of the poet/lover; as a tool of vision, the mirror 29 THE OXFORD ART JOURNAL - 16:1 1993</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 4 Girolamo Mocetto: 'Narcissus' Musee Jacquemart- Andre, Paris. (Photo: courtesy of Musee Jacquemart- Andre.) recalls the initiation of love through the eyes; and finally the lover's eyes, face or heart mirror a pure image of the beloved.53 The cassone pictures show that while Narcissus falls in love with himself as another man, that very act of homoerotic speculation occurs within the logic of heterosexual distinctions: bearer of the gaze and passive subject.4 The two potential love objects proposed by the anonymous panel (Fig. 1), Echo and the reflected image, correspond to the anti- thetical construction of the feminine in the Renais- sance.55 In contrast to Echo's open invitation, the reflection primly resists its pursuer; while Echo speaks without effect, the lips of the reflection move without making a sound. Echo appears as the unruly, sexually available, loquacious woman in contrast to the ideally silent, chaste, and unattain- able feminized object of desire reflected back at Narcissus. Narcissus' reflection resembles the ideal Renaissance woman, but in its distance and intract- ability it also references the destructive Medusa whose gaze freezes the lover into immobility and can unman or destroy him.56 Narcissus' reflection oscillates between masculine and feminine as we watch his mutual gazing in the cassone panel. John Brenkman has argued that stable gender categories are similarly undermined in the Metamorphoses since the eventual fate of the tragic youth Narcissus, his reduction to a flower or object of vision, 'feminizes' him while Echo retains the phallogocentric and hence superior - even if repetitive - attribute of speech.57 As John Hollan- der notes, Renaissance readers associated Echo not only with commemorative speech, as glossed by Boccaccio, but also with the written word: 'Ovid's nymph vanished into voice; the natural fact of disembodied voice vanishes ... into text'.58 Despite Echo's conspicuous absence in the Della pittura, her association with speech, fame and writing made her a frequent alter-ego for Renaissance female authors eager to establish literary authority with traditional male-authored texts.59 If the reflection of Narcissus can play the feminine part in cassoni pictures, the male-authored Della pittura becomes an Echo, a text produced as a lamentation over its lost object of desire, i.e. the author Alberti, as well as a bestowal of posthumous fame in the manner outlined by Boccaccio. The circulation and afterlife of Alberti's treatise allow him to appropriate Echo's voice at the same time that the imaginary fresco in Book III allows him to appear as Narcissus. Alberti has it both ways, indeed the Della pittura constructs a hermaphroditic authorial self-sufficiency.60 In contrast to Alberti's literary subterfuges in the play of his 'autobiographical imagination', Antonio Beccadelli, II Panormita, claimed overtly in his Hermaphroditus (1425) to represent both the fica and the cazzo. Dedicated to Cosimo de'Medici and circulated to the same audience as Alberti's treatise, the Hermaphroditus created a scandal resulting in the author's exile to Naples by 1436.61 Is the indirection of the Ovidian source of the Della pittura calculated to avoid the contemporaneous censure experienced by Beccadelli? Is Alberti's appropriation of the generativity of Echo and of Narcissus a hermaphro- ditic subsumption of the female, a precocious appeal to Neoplatonic androgyny, or a moralizing admoni- tion?62 According to Brenkman, Ovid stages the gender biases of patriarchal representation in the Narcissus episode in order to identify the seer Tiresias (whose metamorphoses cycle from man to woman to man) as the exemplar of the poet. Both punished for sexual transgression and rewarded with mystical foresight, only Tiresias can speak the truth of the narrative; he forecasts Narcissus' tragic end.63 Alberti's allegorical alter-ego Narcissus registers a dangerous aporia, an authorial mise-en-abyme in contrast to Ovid's staging of narrative and gender closure in Tiresias. Alberti's aggressively innovative appeal to Narcissus claims individuality in its idiosyncracy but it also risks the excess and over- determination generated by the accompanying intertextual resonances: 'In any representation identical to its model, in any convincing duplication, there is no room for a signature, for the name of the artist or father ... the subversive quality of this perfect imitation is its ability both to replace the model and to efface the maker'.64 The filiation of texts in the Della pittura, when read as an indi- viduating confrontation with the father figures Ovid and Pliny as well as with Petrarca, Boccaccio and late medieval tradition, appears initially to confirm Alberti's confidently innovative location of male invention and generativity in a homoerotically- charged Narcissus. When read as an androgynous or indeterminate figure - from the perspective of Tiresias - however, Narcissus seems ironically to undermine the very mimesis he invents. He reveals the unfixed and mobile boundaries of faulty and erroneous desire, whether conceived as heterosexual or homoerotic, rather than boundless masculine creativity. Alberti's reflected alter-egos, Echo and Narcissus, THE OXFORD ART JOURNAL - 16:1 1993 30</page><page sequence="7">each testify to his inexhaustible search for authori- tative identity as well as to his maintenance of an ironic stance foreclosing any thoroughly convincing or totalizing identification. The inclusion of Narcis- sus and the 'erasure' of Echo in the Della pittura bear out Jarzombek's assertion that, 'Alberti's quasi- autobiographical method is part of an active, ongoing internal debate rather than a list of conclusions or a proclamation of received truths'.65 The mythologized origins of painting in the Della pittura reveal not so much the coherence of the Humanist project to appropriate classical mythology and to make painting a liberal art, as the canonical tradition of art history would have it, but rather such an inquiry into origins reveals the strain and equi- vocation, the instability and mystification producing Renaissance Humanist culture.

Panofsky, for example, distances Alberti's Narcissus from the moralizing account in Plotinus, Enneads 1.6.8: 'Plotinus, then, referred to the myth to warn against 'losing oneself in mere visible beauty; Alberti (basing himself on Ovid ...) used it to show that painting originated from love of the beautiful, and he compared painting with embracing an image (not just a phantom!).

Alberti's fantasy also inverts the common Renaissance notion that a newborn child could resemble a picture, whether beautiful or monstrous, viewed by its mother; in the Della pittura, in contrast, the frescoes conceived by Alberti's pupils will resemble the adult author. See M. H. Huet, 'Living Images: Monstrosity and Representation', Representations, vol. 4, 1983, p. 73. 40. Barkan, Transuming Passion, p. 75, for Ariosto's confrontation with this Ovidian topos. 41.
