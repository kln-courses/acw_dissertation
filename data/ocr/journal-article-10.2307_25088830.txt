<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jarold Ramsey Crow: or the Trickster Transformed The chief (Jesus) sent Coyote from above to this land. He had sent crow first, he had him come to see how the people were, how they were then. When that crow arrived, he saw people lying about, dead. He went and ate their eyes, and then he went on, and went above again towards home, to the place of the chief (Jesus). He (Jesus) asked him, "How did it appear to you?" It seemed to him to be pretty good. But he said to him, "Why, no! You have been eating their eyes. Very evidently you have been doing ill. You are finished, that is as much work as you will obtain." Then he ceased right there, the chief (Jesus) let him go, he became a crow, he became a black crow. The chief (Jesus) above spoke, "I will take another one, and I will send him to go and see." Coyote said, "Let me go!" And Coyote came, he arrived there. He (Jesus) had told him, "That is how you are to be, exactly like myself .... ?Told by Lewy Costima to Melville Jacobs, Northwest Sahaptin Texts, Vol. II, Columbia University Contributions to Anthro pology, XIX (1934), 238-239. TN "crow," ted hughes writes as if the world's mythologies were - - open and available to his imagination. The title-figure strikes most readers as something new in our poetry, the real thing, an innovation, and so he is?and yet, as I hope to show, Hughes has skillfully fashioned Crow out of bits and pieces of some very ancient traditions from both the Old and the New Worlds. Here is contemporary mythopoesis with a vengeance. To be sure, T. S. Eliot long ago proclaimed in that famous and very self-conscious review of Ulysses that Joyce had brought into modern writing a new "mythic method," a way of "manipulating a continuous parallel between contemporaneity and antiquity" that could give shape and meaning to our history?but presumably neither Joyce nor Eliot seriously entertained the possibility of straying, as Hughes has strayed, 111</page><page sequence="2">The Massachusetts Review beyond the Indo-European traditions into the myths and tales of the Eskimos, the Japanese, various North American Indian tribes, and the Persians, and the lore of the Talmud and the Koran, and so on. Nor can it be said, really, that in his mythic method Hughes is manipulating parallels between the modern and the antique and/or primitive worlds: instead, he seems to be intent, with help from world folklore, on re writing portions of Creation itself so that the first story in our book of human predicaments is more consistent with the chapters in which we live. There is a historical perspective in these poems, as we will see, but much of the time it is subsumed in a controlling perspective that man ages to be at once mythic, and deeply personal. In this regard, it is fair to say that Hughes' introduction to the Selected Poems of the Yugoslavian poet Vasko Popa (Penguin, 1969) is to Crow (1970) what Eliot's review of Joyce was to The Waste Land?at least as self-revealing, especially in the careful distinction Hughes draws on behalf of Popa between "literary surrealism" with its ultimately impersonal surrender to the arbitrary imagery of the dream flow, "and the surrealism of folklore," which is "always urgently con nected with the business of trying to manage practical difficulties so great that they have forced the sufferer temporarily out of the dimension of coherent reality into that depth of imagination where understanding has its roots and stores its X-Rays" (pp. 14?15). To what extent Hughes himself is "the sufferer" in Crow is not at issue: what such a statement suggests to me about the book is that its author believes in the dream-work efficacy of myth, even today, and unlike Joyce and Eliot ultimately turns to it in Crow for its inherent imaginative sanity, and not just for its ironic bearing on modern history. For one recent commentator, on the contrary, Hughes' conceptions in Crow "fall a little too readily into the mean slots of nihilism. In truth he now knows his own mind too well. He needs to pray, like Frost, to have some dust thrown in his eyes." (Calvin Bedient, Eight Contempo rary Poetsy London, 1974, p. 116.) The "diagnosis," typical of this overwrought book, needs no comment, but it does boggle the mind a little to see the mythic adventuresomeness of these poems, the way Hughes' wit is playing on folklore in them, dismissed so airily as the easy nihilism of a self-imitator. What dust in whose eyes? II Speaking to Egbert FAAS after the publication of Crow about the emergence of certain writers (unnamed but presumably including 112</page><page sequence="3">Crow: or the Trickster Transformed Popa) who represent a "post-Christian view," Hughes notes that "In their world Christianity is just another provisional myth of man's rela tionship with the creator and the world of spirit." (London Magazine, Jan. 1971, p. 17.) The observation has been applied to Hughes him self, but erroneously, I think: the central impulse of the Crow poems is certainly an ingenious and unrelenting subversion of the Christian mythos, so as to reveal how it has got nearly everything wrong about Man's origins?but the violence of the subversion, the sense of overkill in fact, indicates that for the author Christianity is still much more immediate and formidable than "just another provisional myth." Better to say that in these poems, Hughes tries to fight his way free of a still prevailing Christian-humanistic frame of reference that in its omissions and distortions of human facts makes our inherendy bad lot a good deal worse. The impulse appears well before Crow in Wodwoy in such blas phemous redactions of scripture as "Logos," "Reveille," and "The ology"; and in Season Songsy Hughes' first full collection since Crowy there is at least one witty backward glance at an earlier obsession. In a "Cock Robin"-like poem about the funeral of the fallen leaves, this stanza appears? Who'll be their parson? ' ?Me,' says the crow, 'for it is well known I study the bible right down to the bone . . . .' Who or what is Crow? In exploring his roots in world folklore, I want to insist that first and last, Crow is Ted Hughes' own astonishing invention, for his own purposes: one might say, admiringly, that he is an addition to folk-literature, not merely something borrowed from it. With this proviso in mind, we can generally identify Crow as a Trick ster, a member in good standing of that fascinating company of beings which includes Anansi the Spider in African literature; Loki in Norse myths; Coyote, Raven, Crow, Blue jay, Manabozho, Nanabush, and others in North American native mythology (as in the epigraph to this essay) ; and somewhat more distantly, Hermes in the Greek and Iblis/ Satan in the Islamic and Hebraic traditions. To characterize the Trickster is to characterize the full range of possibilities in the human id and ego; indeed, one of his functions in oral literature is to create narrative possibility in the face of tribal re straints and norms of good citizenship. In Jung's view, he represents the primitive, utterly undifferentiated state of consciousness that societies transcend, perhaps, but individuals don't. (The Trickstery ed. Paul 113</page><page sequence="4">The Massachusetts Review Radin, New York, 1956, pp. 202-203.) A typical Trickster figure in western Indian mythologies is greedy, over-sexed, selfish, covetous, aggressively mischievous, capable of wiliness and cleverness but only on a short-term and over-reaching basis. In short, a creature that is, as we say, "all too human" in his imperfections; and whose incredible survival despite repeated fatal come-uppances points to the persistence in us of the unreconstructed id, and beyond that, perhaps, to the sheer avid persistence of the race itself. (Can it be that the two are related? ) Clearly the career of a Trickster-figure like Coyote allowed a tribal audience to have its ethics both ways?anticipating with official approval his eventual fall, while at the same time vicariously relishing his free dom from shame-culture morality, before the fall. More generally, as L?vi-Strauss and others have pointed out, the Trickster in his position and actions serves a complex mediative purpose?as between the moral ideals of a people's Way, and their naked instincts; as between two modes of survival, hunting, say, and gathering (most Tricksters are animals like Coyote and Crow who as carrion eaters partake of both modes) ; as between men and their gods. "Mediation" in this sense, of course, means something more than compromise or reconciliation or a Hegelian middle step: it means, if I understand L?vi-Strauss, a dynamic interposing between polar opposites as a permanent condition, allowing, as in myth and ritual, the mind to hold on to both opposites at once. (See Claude L?vi-Strauss, Structural Anthropologyy New York, 1967, pp. 220 ff.) Hence, from the point of view of function, the Trickster's unique protean diversity, his predictable unpredictability as a creature meta physically in the Middle (in all sorts of middles). But there is more to him yet. In many traditions, he has a major role in the primal creation of the world-as-it-now-is. More precisely, he serves as a Transformer: finding the world to be seriously incomplete, disordered, "crude," the handiwork of a sleeping or absconded Creator, he steps in, takes over, sets mythic precedents large and small, does the best he can to give some shape and order to the available material of the world, before the human race inherits it. L?vi-Strauss's term for the Trickster in his Transforming role is wittily accurate?"bricoleur," or handyman. It is important to recognize here that the typical Trickster-Trans former, say, Raven in the mythology of British Columbia Indians, does not invent copulation or arrange for food-supply or procure daylight in a rush of divine or at least promethean philanthropy. Instead, he gen erally performs his Transforming deeds in charactery from tricksterish 114</page><page sequence="5">Crow: or the Trickster Transformed motives of greed or spite or personal convenience: "the people to come" who know his stories gratefully inherit the world he pieced together, without having any illusions about his motives for doing so, or about a Grand Design in Creation, of which he was Omniscient Designer. Now we are coming close to Ted Hughes' own Trickster, not just in the lineaments of Crow, but in the ideological and eschatological oudook he seems to represent. The possible wisdom and sanity accruing from the mythic belief that the world was given its present format (which one takes for better and worse) by a humanly intelligible Trans former is never far, I think, from the poet's mind in these poems, as he follows his quarrel with the Biblical God. But the Judaeo-Christian account of Genesis with its overwhelming sense of divine teleology and original perfection is what we have inherited, and poor Crow, unlike his tribal counterparts, never really has a chance as a Transformer. His pranks point up some of the most glaring weaknesses in God's design, certainly, but unfortunately God is still around, still meddling in Crea tion Himself. Hughes has spoken frequently in interviews and readings ?not always very helpfully?about the imaginative matrix that gave birth to the Crow poems ("From the Life and Songs of the Crow" is the book's subtide), and according to these premises a malign force mocks God's Creation, especially Man, and when challenged to do better, sends Crow down to earth. But by the standards of primitive myth he is too late and too little as a Transformer. And, as will be seen, he becomes subject to transformation himself. Why did Hughes choose a crow as his Trickster-Transformer? In one sense the question is silly for anyone who has ever watched a real crow or raven for more than a few moments: if there had been no genus Corvusy Hughes or somebody would have had to invent it, as the saying goes, for its raucous intelligence, greediness, and blackness?an image of the human. But beyond the intrinsic appropriateness of the beast as a sort of totem, it is worthwhile noting the kind of crow-lore in world folk-literature that the poet may have assimilated when he was reading Anthropology and Folklore at Cambridge, or since. There are, of course, the crows and ravens in the Scots ballads, and Noah's Raven, which does not return to the Ark, according to some traditions, because it turns to eating carrion from the Flood. In the Talmud, a crow teaches Adam how to bury his dead, and as a result, crow hatchlings ever since have had white feathers. Another Jewish tradition has it that crows and all other black creatures were created by the Devil in competition with God. In the Alaska Eskimo Creation cycle, Raven finds the first man 115</page><page sequence="6">The Massachusetts Review newly hatched from a wild-pea pod (and behaving strikingly like the unoriented speaker in "Wodwo") : after helping him find shelter and food, Raven creates the first woman out of clay. In the Tsimshian and other North Coast analogues of these stories, Raven is a more ambiguous benefactor?finding the world in darkness, he gets himself born to the daughter of the chief who is hoarding the light, and after a series of tricks, carries it off in a box and releases it to men only when they insult him. In the syncretic Cowlitz Indian story given at the head of this essay, Jesus sends Crow down to look after the first people, but, finding them apparently dead, he pecks out the eyes, and is replaced by a more businesslike Transformer, Coyote! And so on, and on?as Hughes himself has remarked ( The Listenery 30 July 1970, p. 149), crows live nearly everywhere on earth, with a correspondingly rich folklore. Perhaps their traditional associations with human life, and Hughes' own peculiar totemism in these poems, is best summed up in a Hindu saying about the Other World: it is a place "where no man goes, and no crow flies." What Coleridge would call Hughes' "esemplastic" use of mythologies in Crow has distinctive formal and stylistic consequences for the poems: they mostly adhere to a sort of mythic decorum, in fact. The style it self is "rude" in several senses, colloquially primitive, casual in the manner of transcriptions of aboriginal narratives; and although one might argue against such a deliberate flattening of style on the grounds that real native texts are invariably much more artificial in their original languages, still, the effect here is wonderfully appropriate to the point of view: these are crow-songs. Such as it is, the rhetoric of the sequence reveals Hughes' commitment to folklore, too, Biblical and otherwise ?there are frequent enumerations, as in genealogies and inventories of things; there are formulaic openings ("Once upon a time," "There was a man") ; there are catechisms and magical examinations in the manner of Biblical pedagogy. .As for the action of the book: although David Lodge has plausibly characterized it in a fine essay (Critical Quarterly 13, 1971, pp. 37? 42) as deriving from Disney cartoons, in fact it follows very faithfully the typical incidents in a cycle of Trickster-narratives. The wild esca pades in series, causes leading to improbable effects that snowball in magnitude, maniacal pursuits, villainous transformations, the periodic Bang! that utterly destroys the protagonist, who then appears in the next scene intact, the wholesale inconsistencies between narratives?all this is standard fare in the Trickster story, as the following synopsis of 116</page><page sequence="7">Crow: or the Trickster Transformed the beginning of a Transformation cycle from the Tillamook Indians of Oregon will illustrate. The Trickster is named "South Wind"? He sees a canoe with three people, one a virgin; interested in the virgin, he transforms himself into a baby, lies on the rocks in the water, is picked up by the people, cries until the girl holds him, touches her vulva, exclaims that it is soft like an old woman's. At Bay City he transforms his penis into a clam digger, eats clams with a family, ordains that there shall be but one clam in each shell, and juice instead of oil. He induces the woman to stroke the clam digger and makes sarcastic remarks when she discovers that it is his penis. He avoids Stink Bug women who want to make him impotent, but he copulates with two girls who take him under the ocean with them. He escapes them, asks for rocks to shelter him as he sleeps in the sun, awakens enclosed by rocks, calls Woodpecker who breaks her bill trying to free him, calls Yellowhammer. When she has pecked a hole he reaches up and seizes her leg; she flies away insulted. He takes himself apart, throws body parts out of the hole; Sea Gull and Raven eat his eyes. He feels his way to Bald Eagle's house, pretends to be measuring the house, brags about his eyes, effects a trade with Bald Eagle, who then steals Snail's eyes and voice. South Wind goes on ... . ?Elizabeth and Melville Jacobs, Nehalem Tillamook Tales, Eugene, 1959, pp. 198-199. In fairness to David Lodge's essay, such antic adventures do sound like the Disney cartoons, excluding of course the overt sexuality, and unquestionably there is something genuinely mythic in the best cartoons and comic-strips; the Trickster survives amongst us, after a fashion, in the form of Coyote in the "Roadrunner" TV series, Bugs Bunny, Woody Woodpecker, "Mr. Natural" in the R. Crumb Comics. But the cartoons are only a useful analogue in our culture to Crow's story ?its true source, I hope it is now clear, is Hughes' meditations on aboriginal narratives. (Another contemporary poet who has made striking use of the forms as well as the content of myth narratives is W. S. Merwin. His un creation myth, "The Last One," with its snowballing ecological dis aster, is close kin in "oral" style and apocalyptic vision to many poems in Hughes' book.) The plan of Crow itself derives from anthropological sources. Hughes has always aimed at sequentiality in his books: he has noted, for example, that most of Lupercal is "one extended poem about one or two sensa tions. There are at least a dozen or fifteen poems in that book which belong organically to each other." (Quoted in British Poetry Since 117</page><page sequence="8">The Massachusetts Review 1945, ed. E. Lucie-Smith, Penguin, 1970, p. 390.) The foUowing book, Wodwo, is more of a collection per sey but in Crow y as even the most hostile reviewers have acknowledged, the poems constitute a co herent sequence, with something of a plot; the context accumulates meaning (it would be hard to do justice to the poetry of Crow in an anthology), and one has the sense that the whole book adds up to much more than the sum total of its individual parts. Contemporary poetry is in for the Sequence, clearly?Roethke, Lowell, Berryman, Merwin, Kinnell come to mind: what is special about Hughes' book, among other things, is that its loose sequentiality, centering on Crow, is sanc tioned by the conventions of Trickster cycles and other serial forms in oral literature. It is high time for a few of what Wallace Stevens called "pages of illustrations," but first, I want to outline what the sequentiality of Crow turns upon. It seems clear that Hughes' protagonist undergoes a radical transformation in the course of the book: beginning as an avowed med dler who has been created by an opponent of God to "show Him up" in His Creation, especially with regard to Man, Crow goes through a progress in which he becomes less and less an adversary of Man, and more and more a humanly vulnerable creature himself, sharing help lessly in the human predicament. There is a kind of formula to be seen in the chief mythic identities that Hughes forces upon Crow in the course of his career: beginning as something akin to the Devil, he be comes a Trickster-Transformer whose tricks are nasty for Man; later he is identified with Prometheus and other heroes; later yet he is linked, blasphemously of course, with Christ; ultimately he seems to be ap proaching "merely" human status. Crow's deviltry gives way very quickly after his incarnation to less confident actions and responses: he peers, mopes, weeps, feels helplessness, feels sympathy, is appalled, sings "trembling," and so on. Hughes' own remark on this question is gnomi cally definitive: "He's a man to correct man, but of course he's not a man, he's a crow: he never does quite become a man." (The Listenery 30 July 1970, p. 149.) But, we might add, he comes close, too close for Christian comfort. Ill Now to the text, with an eye to its ordonnance. The first seven pieces contrive in different ways to get Crow born into earthly life: it is a most reluctant and painful incarnation, as in the Manichean doctrine of the soul, and all expectations of what Mircea Eliade has 118</page><page sequence="9">Crow: or the Trickster Transformed called "the prestige of origins" in Western myth (see Myth and Re ality y New York, 1963, pp. 21 ff.) are subverted by a poem like "Line age," with its mockery of Biblical genealogies. God begets Nothing, who begets Never, who begets Crow. Here and in the following poem, "Examination at the Womb Door," with its mock-catechism emphasiz ing the primacy of death, Crow is nonetheless portrayed as somehow circumstantially superior to death? But who is stronger than death? Me, evidently. Pass, Crow. In his excellent pamphlet on Hughes for the British Council (Lon don, 1972), Keith Sagar1 interprets this passage as meaning that, as in the Buddhist view, life is illusion and that Man must strive to "acquire the discipline which, after death, will close the womb-door and avoid further incarnation in a world which belongs entirely to death." (p. 30.) I doubt this reading; the world in these poems does belong to Death, yet Crow, having been begotten by Never, lives?like other Tricksters, he carries on with a kind of brute avidity, much like the human race: "Carrion, Jack!" as Crow might say. Though there is no comfort in asserting mere survival, and indeed no meaning, "the evidence" supports Crow's assertion, and he passes the exam mysteri ously and is sent into life. The last poem in this "birth sequence," "The Door," seems to bring Crow into a closer relationship with the poet and his creating vision of things: in the solid wall of a body, there is a black doorway, "the eye's pupil," and through it Crow is born. In yet a further version of his birth, "Conjuring in Heaven," the gods put nothing inside nothing, and drop it from Heaven to Earth: "There lay Crow, cataleptic." With "A Childish Prank," Crow has fully arrived in life, and takes *I read Mr. Sagar's full-length study of the poet, The Art of Ted Hughes (Cambridge, 1975), after this essay was completed and in press. The chapter on Crow amplifies to good effect his commentary in the British Council book let, and adds new material on Crow's career as a Trickster that for the most part complements the present essay, (pp. 114 ff.) See also Sagar's discussion of "words" in Crow (pp. 123?125), and his remarks on Hughes' preoccupa tion in these poems and since with "the failure of English intelligence and sensibility in the modern world." (p. 143.) Although he refers once or twice to Crow as "a developing character," Sagar does not approach the book as a poetic sequence with a mythic shape. 119</page><page sequence="10">The Massachusetts Review up his career as Trickster and Transformer with gusto. Here and else where in the book, as Hughes undermines Christian myth, there is a kind of child's naughty delight in blasphemy, in saying forbidden things right under God's nose; the poem is, really, a paradigm of Hughes' sacrilegious use of mythic traditions. God is deus otiosus here because, following the Zohar and Manichean lore, he can't seem to get Man's and Woman's souls to enter their waiting bodies. The story in the Zohar is worth quoting at length (there are analogues in the Koran), to illustrate the poet's way with legend? When the Holy One, praised be He, was about to create the world, the universe was already present in His thought. He then formed the souls which were eventually to belong to man, and they appeared before Him in the very same form they were later to take in the human body. God examined them one by one, and found several which were destined to become corrupt in this world. When the time came, each of the souls was summoned before God, Who said: "Go to this or that part of the earth and animate such and such a body." The soul replied, "O Master of the Universe, I am happy in this world and do not want to leave it for another where I shall be exposed to contamination!" But God insisted, and "the soul sorrowfully took the earthly plan and descended among us." (Quoted in The Kabbalah, by Adolphe Franck, New York, 1967, p. 130.) Crow's solution lacks God's foresightedness and authority, but is per fecdy in character, for a bricoleur, working with the available materials ?he gets the first human bodies animated, and sex invented, along with the precedent for its pains and frustrations. Also in the Zohar, there is the Platonic notion that before incarnation all souls are bisexual; at in carnation they must divide, one per body: "at the time of marriage, the Holy One, blessed be He, unites them as before, and they become again a single body and a single soul." (Franck, p. 129.) Crow's perversion of such a doctrine in "A Childish Prank"?the consequences of which are more brutally mythified in the following poem "Crow's First Les son," and of course in the appalling "Song for a Phallus"?colors and controls all the "love poems" in the book. (One uses the label ad visedly!) Besides the ones mentioned, "Criminal Ballad," "Crow Tries the Media," "Crow's Undersong," "Fragment of an Ancient Tablet," "Notes for a Little Play," "Snake Hymn," "Love Song," "Love Pet"?this is fully a sixth of the whole book. To be a consciously sexed being, according to Crow's myth, is to suffer the most exquisite tor 120</page><page sequence="11">Crow: or the Trickster Transformed tures of division and frustration in the name of love: the true fate of that would-be amorous bird of prey in Marvell's poem. All this, and the view of Woman as Devouring Mother, is familiar enough in Hughes' poetry?what is odd, in a way, is that the poet does not allow Crow himself to get directly involved in sex, despite the Trick ster's tradition of rampant lechery (as in the Tillamook synopsis given above). In a limited edition of the book published in 1973, with twelve crow-drawings by Leonard Baskin, Hughes does include a poem en titled "Crow's Courtship," in which, following a Talmudic tradition about God's first botched attempt to create a wife for Adam out of raw material, Crow waits impatiently outside the lab as God labors to make him a Frankensteinian bride, and then ruins the work by breaking in at "the worst moment." But even here, Crow's sexuality is untested ?apparently Hughes wanted to keep his Trickster simple in this re spect, even childish, and thus perhaps a sharper perspective on a dimen sion of the human predicament that (I am guessing) the poet found to be the most terrible of all. After "A Childish Prank," in "Crow Alights" and "That Moment," Hughes commences on an intermittent run of poems that are explicitly prophetic and eschatological. Crow, with mounting horror at what he has gotten into, looks ahead to history, to us, from the Creation he is attending. In these two poems, all of God's teleology seems to lead eerily up to a single human face, a hand, a cigarette, which in "That Moment" are cancelled, apparently by suicide. Typically, Crow, "stronger than death," surviving at any rate, has "to start searching for something to eat." The implications of this detail are at once ma cabre and eminently practical?the essence of Crow. "Crow Hears Fate Knock on the Door" and "Crow Tyrannosau rus" together depict Man, through the distorting lens of Crow, in his predicament as conscious beast, human animal; their chief predecessor in Hughes' earlier poetry is "Wodwo." As in that unforgettable poem, so here, the view of man's condition is mythicy the opposite of existential: essence precedes existence, and our essence is hopelessly mixed. On the one hand, Crow?already losing his insouciance as Trickster?can not resist the Wodwo-like impulse to inspect and try to understand everything, and "the prophecy inside him, like a grimace" is essentially of Humanism, the concept of Man the Measurer and Measure?"i WILL MEASURE IT ALL AND OWN IT ALL / AND I WILL BE INSIDE IT / as inside my own laughter ..." but in fact the consequence of such an imperative, "like a steelspring / Slowly rending the vital fibres," will 121</page><page sequence="12">The Massachusetts Review be alienation from Nature and the peculiar ignorance that goes by the names of rational skepticism and scientific inquiry. "Crow's Account of the Batde," "The Black Beast" (which owes something, perhaps, to Keith Douglas's poem "B?te Noire"), "Crow's Account of St. George," "Crow on the Beach," "Revenge Fable," "Crow and the Sea"?all dramatize the terrible consequences of Crow's prophecy: we can't help being "scientific," it deadens us within, and now more than ever threatens to destroy us physically. In "The Black Beast," Crow the Scientist ransacks all of nature in a final phase of Wodwo's curi osity, but the beast he seeks remains a b?te noire indeed, hidden in his own self-ignorance. On the other hand, in "Crow Tyrannosaurus," Crow quails before the sheer bloody avidity of Creation and its food-chain hierarchy, and wonders if extreme Manicheeism is the answer: "Alas ought I / To stop eating / And try to become the light? " But in midst of such elevated human meditations, animal instinct and appetite break in?"Grubs grubs He stabbed he stabbed / Weeping." In action now like those "attent sleek thrushes on the lawn / More coiled steel than living" of an early Hughes poem, in consciousness Crow is still agonized, help lessly other, "all too human" in his mythic precedent-setting: Thus came the eye's roundness the ear's deafness. (Later in the sequence, in "Crow's Nerve Fails," this helpless guilt be comes a kind of Original Sin for Crow?"Clothed in his conviction, / Trying to remember his crime / Heavily he flies.") At this point, before proceeding with the general career of Crow, his ironic humanizing, we should glance at two related themes intro duced into the sequence by Hughes once he has gotten the hero estab lished in Creation, and beginning to suffer it. In "A Disaster," "The Battle of Osfrontalis," "Crow's Fall," "Crow Tries the Media," "Crow Goes Hunting," "Owl's Song," and "Bedtime Story," Crow comes up against the peculiarly human gift-and-curse of language. Significandy, in the logic of Crow's development, in the first two of these pieces he coolly withstands the ordeal by words: in "A Disaster," in fact, as some sort of demonic Logos runs amok and destroys whole cities (compare Merwin's "The Last One"), we are told that "he [eats] well"; and in the following "Battle of Osfrontalis," although 122</page><page sequence="13">Crow: or the Trickster Transformed words do turn directly against Crow (one thinks of Stevens' "The Plot Against the Giant"), he resists them with comical ease. But in "Crow's Fall," Hughes' contribution to the folklore of corvine black ness, when poor Crow returns "charred black" from his vainglorious attack on the sun, he must resort to a very human rationalization: " 'Up there,' he managed / 'Where white is black and black is white, I won.' " Now our hero is infected by language, like us, it seems. He "Tries the Media," in the form of a love song, but the available words besmear and corrupt his vision; when he "Goes Hunting" with words, reality in the form of a hare cunningly eludes them. The poem is a fine example of Hughes' witty adaptation of the logic of oral narratives (and, per haps, cartoons as well), a goofy chase scene in which the quarry shifts its shape more and more wildly as the hunters, although transforming themselves too, stay always one comic jump behind. The hare escapes: Crow is left empty-handed, "Speechless with admiration." This insuffi ciency Crow discovers in language, the way words fail us, always com ing ex post facto after experience and blurring it, is an implicit theme in "A Bedtime Story," in which an everyman, "out of it" as the saying goes, always comes too late to reality and with a sense of division and distraction. As so often here, one thinks of certain pieces in Merwin's The Moving Target and The Lice. (Perhaps poems like "Crow Tries the Media" anticipate Hughes' radical experiments with language in his collaboration with Peter Brook on Orghast.) Crow's trouble with words is, of course, only one part of the burden of human misery that Hughes is trying to name, and although the main imaginative line of the book features the adventures of Crow the Trick ster as a kind of mythic displacement of this burden, there is a loose series of poems in which Hughes seems to suggest in direct human terms an emotional stance for bearing it up. I am thinking in particular of "A Grin," "Criminal Ballad," "The Contender," "In Laughter," "The Smile," and "Crow Improvises." In these pieces there is some thing of Beckett's grim humor, something of Morgenstern's gallows wit, something of simple hysteria?a terrible comedy beyond tragedy, in which the true funnybone is the skull, and the only smile is its fixed grimace. In "The Contender," Prometheus on his rock wears a terrify ing grin; in "The Smile," at the moment of death a victim is rewarded by a visit from a disembodied smile, "for a moment / Mending every thing / Before it swept out and away across the earth." Here and in the following piece, "Crow Improvises," a sort of apocalypso song in which 123</page><page sequence="14">The Massachusetts Review various human antinomies are conjoined in a man's two hands until the coupling of opposites destroys him, much as Crow is being wracked by his role as Trickster/mediator, the Terrible Smile seems to be at best a provisional stance; if it helps, it comes late in suffering and leaves early, so to speak, belonging to no one alive. So Hughes follows "The Smile" with "Crow Frowns"?the frown coming from Crow's renewed helpless questioning (for us all) of his place and purpose in Creation? His footprints assail infinity With signatures. We are here, we are here. He is the long waiting for something To use him for some everything Having so carefully made him Of nothing. Who knows the myth, Hughes seems to ask in this haunting and sum mary poem, that would end such waiting-in-ignorance ? Returning now to the main lines of Crow's career as a prankish mediator in Creation: his drift into the human condition seems to grow more and more unmistakable. To be sure, he continues intermittendy to transform God's handiwork, as in "A Horrible Religious Error," in which it is Crow ("Chrow"?) who vanquishes the serpent that might have served Adam and Eve as a nature-deity; "Crow's Song of Him self," in which, under God's attempts to destroy it, Crow's body be comes, Whitman-like, the raw stuff of human life, even its Redeemer; and "Crow Blacker Than Ever." This last poem, in fact, is a kind of final summary of Crow's original mythic purpose on Earth: Creation is coming a cropper, God and Man have turned away from each other in mutual disgust, but Crow steps in and nails them together forever: "Then heaven and earth creaked at the joint / Which became gangre nous and stank? / A horror beyond redemption." And having carpen tered our impossible Judaeo-Christian union of divinity and earthly flesh, in his role as bricoleur, Crow exults, "This is my creation." But already in the sequence, in "Crow's Playmates," our hero has made his own futile anthropomorphic gesture towards divinity, creating the gods for playmates, out of mountains and rivers . . . but, as in the history of man's religions generally, the gods have floated away from their natural, native settings, "gone abstract," leaving poor Crow all the more forlorn in Nature, "his own leftover," in fact. And this forlornness in general characterizes the last glimpses we get 124</page><page sequence="15">Crow: or the Trickster Transformed of Crow; he has gotten involved in Man's estate, it seems, has become in his suffering part of the problem. There is something strangely mov ing about this (as there is in some authentic Trickster cycles, the Winne bago for example, when the Trickster finally puts aside his pranks and prepares to yield the world to the human race), a sense of wild vitality tamed, and opportunity lost. Reviewers have frequently objected that, as a book, Crow falls off in intensity towards the end; I agree that it does, somewhat, but I would wager that Hughes understood the risks and took them knowingly, in his commitment to a significant poetic sequentiality, a progress from origin myths to eschatological images. In "Truth Kills Everybody," Crow acts out Menelaus's wrestling match with Proteus, whose transformations become more and more awesome? Christ's hot pounding heart?he held it The earth, shrunk to the size of a hand-grenade And he held it he held it and held it and BANG! He was blasted to nothing. In context, we know that Crow will of course revive ; is he not stronger than death? And we know, from context, what Hughes thinks in gen eral of man's alienating, self-obscuring impulse to pursue the truth according to the canons of scientific humanism. But despite it all, despite earth's ultimate BANG!, there is something appealing, even heroic about Crow's sheer childlike persistence; and this note is carried on in the following piece, "Crow and Stone." It is another ultimate encoun ter, but while Crow looks to be a monster of unlimited human "domin ion," whose eyeblink holds the world in awe, "still he who never has been killed / Croaks helplessly / And is only just born." Can this latter figure be Crow the Trickster, the gleeful subverter of God's plan; can it be Crow in the next poem, "Glimpse," who sings, yearningly, "O leaves"? Yes: such is Hughes' refraction of the human image in the evolution of Crow. The book ends with four summary poems, "King of Carrion," "Two Eskimo Songs," and "Littleblood." The first of these, coming directly after "Glimpse," shifts focus dramatically and depicts, as if at a great distance, a kind of terrible final apotheosis of Crow?no longer human ized, a mediator with human impulses, but rather the absolute monarch of the desolation that men now have it in them to create on earth : truly, a place where no man would go, and no crow fly. The special shock of 125</page><page sequence="16">The Massachusetts Review this poem, as a kind of warning, lies in what becomes of Crow: once the image of something "livelier" than death, now he is death's very totem, immobile, silent. The two "Eskimo Songs" which follow are not, to my knowledge, based on extant Eskimo myths or songs: what Hughes seems to be aim ing at in the tide is an evocation of the quality of Eskimo life?its acceptance of what looks like impossibly minimal conditions of existence, its cultivation of the spirit in song (the Eskimo word for song, anerca, is also the word for spirit) and in religion (significandy, in the light of Hughes' treatment of Christianity, there is a popular belief that when Eskimos are Christianized, they die). The title of the first song, "Flee ing from Eternity," is pretty surely a serious take-off on the tide of Yeats' great mordant poem on the pains of this life in relation to the Christian promise of the next, "Running to Paradise." Here, man comes "running faceless over the earth": after several million years of ignorant pain, he cuts himself eyes and a mouth, and when he encoun ters a woman "singing out of her belly," he cuts these apertures for her, too, in exchange for her song. Knowing now that life is "the pain and the blood," the singing man still feels that "the song is worth it"? something of a Yeatsian conclusion, in fact, except that the woman (is she a Muse? something of a Great Goddess? something more per sonal to the poet?) feels cheated in the exchange. At any rate, the retrospective implications of the poem, back over this harrowing book if not over the poet's whole career, seem obvious. "How Water Began to Play" parallels the faceless man's quest for a viable life in the preceding poem, and indeed Crow's own forays and rebuffs?"Water wanted to live / It went to the sun it came weeping back"?but what is most crucial, here at the close of the sequence, is the way Water's quest ends. Earlier I spoke of a series of poems seem ing to try out a kind of death's-head humor as a provisional emotional stance in this world; here, what Water experiences after its very human torments is an absolute purgation of emotions?"It lay at the bottom of all things / Utterly worn out utterly clear." Again the poem has a retrospective effect: this clarity, though gained at such cost as the pre ceding poems reveal, is good. Will it, as in the title, lead on to "play"? In the final poem, "Litdeblood," having attained a measure of calm and even, perhaps, a simple expectancy, and having put aside his mediat ing Trickster, Crow, the poet turns to appeal to a new bird-totem. Litdeblood is one of the very minims of life, it seems: yet being alive it has (like Man himself) "grown so wise grown so terrible / Sucking 126</page><page sequence="17">Crow: or the Trickster Transformed death's mouldy tits." Like Crow, until his apotheosis, Littleblood rep resents something stronger than death, something older than pain, but the wistfulness and tenderness with which the poet appeals to it drama tizes powerfully that the primal agony and rage against the nature of things, through which Crow is so effective a guide, has run its course. "Sit on my finger, sing in my ear, O littleblood." Such, as i think, is the career of Ted Hughes' Trickster Crow. Whether Hughes himself returns at length to him (and I doubt that he will), in Crow he has forcibly brought back into our writing a figure from world folk-literature so compelling, so imaginatively rich and serviceable, so inexhaustible, that other writers, with or without Hughes' gifts, cannot help but pick him up. We have been needing a Trickster, maybe; it is not committing a primitivism to suppose that he may be one of the imaginative things our polarized age demands. 127</page></plain_text>
