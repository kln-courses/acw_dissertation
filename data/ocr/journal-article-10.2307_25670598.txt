Petrified Intelligence describes itself as a critical introduction to Hegel's meta physics and philosophy of nature. In fact, it is far more than an introduction, although it probably depicts itself as such to indicate that it is not going to be overly exegetical. In fact, the book provides a comprehensive reading of Hegel's philosophy of nature that not only gives the reader a clear sense of the entirety of Hegel's Philosophy of Nature, but also ties that work importantly to Hegel's more well-known major works such as the Logic, the other parts of the Encyclopedia, Journal of Speculative Philosophy, Vol. 20, No. 1, 2006.

Just to do this is an impressive accomplish ment, but Alison Stone does not stop here. She goes on to indicate ways in which Hegel's philosophy of nature can provide a significant critique of modern science in the service of environmental philosophy. This book is important, too, in that it takes on widely influential contempo rary readings of Hegel's philosophy of nature. Stone outlines the attempt among Hegel scholars of the late twentieth century to combat the traditional, negative image of the philosophy of nature as essentially a priori and thus excessively speculative. Among those commentators who would defend what Stone calls a "weak a priori" version of Hegel's philosophy of nature, perhaps the most prominent is Michael J. Petry, who attempted to show that Hegel's philosophy of nature was not intended to oppose the findings of science, but to reconstruct and reorganize them in light of his own philosophy. Such a reading, Stone counters, tends to reduce Hegel's philosophy of nature to a historical document, of inter est only to historians of the science of the nineteenth century. Stone also argues against a "nonmetaphysical" reading of Hegel's philosophy of nature that would contend that his philosophical system sets out to describe, not the world as it really is, but only?following Kant?the set of categories through which we nec essarily confer intelligibility upon our experience. Rather, Stone defends?very convincingly?the controversial strong a priori reading of Hegel's philosophy of nature, according to which the forms of thought that make up the Hegelian "idea," on which all other existents depend, are not merely subjective categories, but "primarily exist as objective structures embodied in both nature and mind" (24). At the same time Stone demonstrates that such a position does not entail either that Hegel must dismiss the empirical claims of the modern science of his time or that his philosophy cannot adapt itself to the transformations of new scientific discoveries. Hegel believes, Stone argues, that science should continue its activities, which are necessary in order to describe the contingent features of natural forms, but that philosophy should respond to the inevitable inadequacy of this description by "engaging] in ongoing reinterpretation of scientific findings in terms of rationalist metaphysics" (88-89). According to the strong a priori reading of Hegel's philosophy of nature that Stone defends, a full vision of nature, although constructed according to a theory that does not take into consideration empirical findings, nevertheless can only be fully fleshed out in its continuity with sensuous experience and scien tific discoveries. The first half of Petrified Intelligence outlines the contours of this strong a priori view that also embraces the findings of science, defending it against other interpretations of Hegel's philosophy of nature, while at the same time acknowledging the lack of clarity in Hegel's own statements of his posi tion that has allowed for so many conflicting readings of it. Stone reconstructs Hegel's theory of natural development in an extended comparison with the theory of consciousness outlined in the Philosophy of Mind in order to confirm not only that his theory of nature is a priori but also that nature, as Hegel conceptualizes</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 67 it, is imbued with, or inseparable from, rational thought considered in a specific way, that it is intrinsically rational. Finally, she also argues that there is reason to take seriously Hegel's claim that his metaphysical descriptions of nature should be taken to be more adequate than scientific descriptions. Hegel's conception of nature, which entails that natural forms contain in ternal contradictions (also knowable as inner loci of rationality) that give rise to self-transformation, can better explain the development and dynamism of nature than can the implicit metaphysical view that underpins empirical science, which conceives of natural entities as "bare things" whose behavior is intrinsically meaningless. Where empirical science explains change in nature by means of external laws (causes), Hegel will explain it through internal rational necessity. Stone argues that this contrast is a much more fundamental one than the traditional view that casts the contrast between Hegel's view and that of empirical science in the terms of teleology versus mechanism. Hegel used the term "petrified intel ligence" to refer to the inherent rationality peculiar to nature, which, as Stone shows against critics of the potential anthropomorphism of this claim, is not a consciously rational way of acting. The second half of the book examines and evaluates four Hegelian argu ments for his rationalist metaphysics of nature: the argument from explanatory power, the systematic derivation of his metaphysics of nature from his general metaphysical standpoint, what Stone calls Hegel's "phenomenological" argument, which states that his rationalist metaphysics articulates a view of nature that is in continuity with our basic sensible experience of nature, and, finally, Hegel's "ethical" argument. The book is compelling in its demonstration that an a priori theory of nature, and in particular that of Hegel, need not entail a rejection of empirical science nor an absolute split between theory and experience. Hegel's aim, as Stone shows, was not to divide the philosophy of nature from science, thereby cutting it off from sensation, but rather to "re-enchant" nature?that is, to reevaluate it in opposition to the abstractions of Enlightenment scientific ideals (xiv). Indeed, Hegel argues in the Philosophy of Nature that there is a structural connection between the senses and the natural elements?an argument that is at the basis of his phenomenological argument for the continuity of his rationalist metaphysics with our sensible experience of nature. Stone argues that Hegel's metaphysical project is not only philosophically cogent but also practically fecund in promis ing "a fresh approach to nature and a sustained and forceful critique of modern empirical science" (27). His approach "calls on us not to reject [the claims of modern science] but to engage with and reassess them, redescribing them in more metaphysically adequate terms" (27). This part of the project is, a bit disappointingly, ultimately deemed beyond the scope of the book. Although Stone continually points to the potential of the critique of modern science contained within Hegel's philosophy of nature, we do not get a sense of its sustained scope beyond the critique of the metaphysics of</page><page sequence="4">natural entities conceived of as bare things. The possibility of using Hegel's phi losophy in a new, metaphysically informed environmental ethics certainly is well defended, but it is unclear exactly how one would proceed with this project. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to get a sense of Hegel's philosophy of nature, in particular its relationship to Hegel's metaphysics. Although it may be untoward to suggest this book as a substitute for reading the Hegel's own text, it is certainly true that more readers balk at the task of sifting through the arcane language and ambiguous references to nineteenth century science that the latter entails. Petrified Intelligence is a very significant piece of research, on an impor tant and unjustly neglected topic. Though irreproachably scholarly, it is also an incredibly readable book, one that fits an amazing amount of acumen, knowledge, and interpretation into a relatively slim volume. I know that I will be referring to this book in years to come as I teach Hegel?and not just Hegel's philosophy of nature. Elaine P. Miller Department of Philosophy Miami University</page></plain_text>
