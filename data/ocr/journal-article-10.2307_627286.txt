<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gottesvorstellung und Lebensauffassung im Griechischen Hymnus. By KARL KEYSSNER. (Wiirzburger Studien zur Altertumswissenschaft, zweites Heft.) Pp. xvi + 172. Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 1932. This is a compilation of use to any who are studying Greek hymnology, including the begin- nings of Christian poetry of this kind and the use of hymns in magic, and also to any who engage in that fascinating game, the pursuit of a literary formula throughout its history. After a short introduction dealing with the hymn as a religious and literary form, the author groups the ideas found in his material, which ranges from pseudo-Homer to Synesios, under a succession of heads, divided into two parts, I, Die Gottesvorstellung and 2, Die Lebensauffassung. The former of these includes the formula AK At6s aPXCbpEaOa and others like it; the use of hyperbole; the acknowledgment of divine power, as by the emphasis laid on a8vapis (-rev, Zeo, 8wvaaiv -ris dv8pcpv OTrepPacoia KaT&amp;OXOi; Soph. Ant., 604; ao- [the Virgin Mary] sdi f -rai 8auvapEI Kal Too ox6rous 8uvoaa-nceaaaa, Ox. pap. 2074, 34, and many passages between these), on dprs-i and so forth; the declaration of man's dependence upon deity; expressions of the attitude of the gods towards men and their activities regarding them; anthropomorphism. The latter is divided into the following sections: Leben, Gliick und Freude ; Familie und Staat ; Ethisch-geistige Werte; Gottliches Dasein und menschliches Lebensideal. It is thus clear that the book forms a sort of subject-index (and, so far as the reviewer has tested it, an accurate one) to these hymns. It is therefore a work to be rather consulted than read through. The weak point is the somewhat unhandy arrangement of the whole. If the user of it wants to know all that ancient hymn- writers have to say, for instance, on the honour (-rII) due to and enjoyed by the gods, he will find it, scattered up and down some half-dozen passages to which the too short index will guide him, with some good exegesis, e.g. of the phrase -6v a'r6oipov Ev Oso~S OEv, Soph., O.T., 215 (p. 65); but his task might easily have been made less troublesome by various quite simple devices, as marginal catch-words, cross-refer- ences, more elaborate subdivision with corre- sponding headings, and so forth, which would not have greatly increased the cost of printing and would have made the book more manage- able. But at least the material is there, and for that the diligent author may be thanked. H. J. R.</page></plain_text>
