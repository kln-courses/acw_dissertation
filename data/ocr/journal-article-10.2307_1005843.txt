C.; and the Ethnographical Museum of Gothenburg, Sweden. It was published in Gothenburg in 1939. In 1953 I obtained a grant from the American Philosophical Society to go to Brazil and study and photograph important Tapajo pieces in museums and private collections, and to gather what information I could concerning when and by whom the material was found. This experience has contributed considerably to our knowledge of Tapajo ceramic art, as many of the specimens recovered in recent years are quite dif- ferent in subject and form from those in collections in the United States and Sweden. The present study includes the material previously published as well as the results of my research in Brazil. In the gathering of the South American material, I am indebted to several Brazilians for generous co- operation. In Belem, Dr. Armando Bordalo da Silva who, at the time of my visit, was Director of the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, received me cordially and granted me permission to study and photograph the important Tapajo collection in that museum; later, at my request, he sent me line drawings by Sr. Guilherme Paulo Leite of one of the museum's fine stone speci- mens. Dr. Peter Paul Hilbert, also of the Goeldi staff, was very generous with his time and assistance, and to him I am indebted for the line drawings of vitamor- phic whistles figured in this study. I wish to express my appreciation to Dr. and Snra. Frederico Barata for their gracious hospitality during the many hours I spent in their home photographing their large and im- portant archaeological collection, and to Dr. Barata for numerous photographs and much valuable information concerning their specimens. The Instituto Agron6mico do Norte, also of Belem, kindly provided me with transportation between Santarem and Belterra. In Santarem, I am indebted to the late Sr. Carlos Liebold and his wife for their courteous hospitality, and for permission to photograph the fine ceramic collection they had obtained from sites in the vicinity, and for photographs of pieces recovered after I returned to the United States. In Belterra, Mr. and Mrs. Charles H. T. Townsend, Jr., were my hosts. I wish to thank them for my pleasant stay and the opportunity to photograph their excellent collection from various sites in the valleys of both the Tapajos and the Trombetas Rivers, and Mr. Townsend for much helpful information both while I was in Brazil and after my return. In Recife, I wish to express my appreciation to Snra. Maria and D. Lygia Estevao de Oliveira for many pleasant hours in their home while I studied and photographed the muiraquitd collection of the late Dr. Carlos Estevao de Oliveira, formerly Director of the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, and for information requested after my return to Philadelphia. To Dr. Jose Maria Carneiro de Albuquerque e Melo, Director of the Museu do Estado, I extend thanks for his courtesy and for photographs of pieces in the Estevao Collection of that museum. My thanks also to Sr. M. Bandeira for his line drawings of one of the important muiraquitas from the Estevao Collection. In Rio de Janeiro, to my friend, D. Heloisa Alberto Torres, formerly Director of the Museu Nacional, my appreciation of her cordial cooperation in my study of the pottery of the valleys of the Tapajos and Trom- betas Rivers in that museum, and for photographs of the specimens I chose for publication, and for much important information. To Dr. Arquimedes Pereira Lima, Director of the Fundaqao Brasil Central, I am indebted for the opportunity to study and photograph the important Brown Collection in that institution. My thanks to my friend D. Maria de Lourdes Jovita of the Mapoteca, Palacio Itamaraty, for her gift of the double-page map of the Amazon Valley for which she did the research and supervised the drawing by Sr. Nemesio Bonates; I am also indebted to her for much geographical information sent to me after my return to the United States, and for generous assistance while I was in Rio de Janeiro. To Dr. Hilgard O'Reilly Sternberg of the Universidade do Brasil, my thanks for an important map, and to D. Christina Correa and Sr. Carlos Ribeiro for permission to include in this study fine stone specimens from their collections. In Sweden, I wish to express my thanks to Dr. K. G. Izikowitz, Director of the Ethnographical Museum of Gothenburg, for photographs of the more important specimens in that museum, and to Dr. Henry Wassen and Dr. Stig Ryden for line drawings and replies to my several requests for information. Mr. Robert C. Brown, presently of New York, supplied considerable information concerning Tapaj6 pieces which he and his late wife collected during their several years residence in Brazil; many of these speci- mens I studied in the Fundaqao Brasil Central. In Philadelphia, I am indebted to Miss Mildred Jantzen for the line drawings of the Tapaj6 sherds in the collection at the University Museum, and to Dr. 3</page><page sequence="5">PALMATARY: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE LOWER TAPAJOS [TRANS.

Re- cently the city has acquired a fine hospital and there are other modern structures, but old buildings are conspicuous. There is the fine twin-steepled Church of Nossa Senhora de Conceicao which, from its slight eminence, seems to dominate the town architecturally; on the principal street, there also still remains a row of Portuguese tile-covered houses, built closely together, the rich colors of their surface designs glowing beauti- fully under the tropical sun. There is a monastery, and the old hospital stands high and gray overlooking the Tapajos. Some residences with their little gardens are picturesque; many homes, however, are very simple. 5</page><page sequence="7">PALMATARY: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE LOWVER TAPAJOS [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. Soc. The broad beach of white sand serves as convenient laundry space, while, on the river, barcos, with sails red or blue, follow each other in more or less continuous procession. From an archaeological standpoint, the most im- portant part of the town is that known as the Aldeia, a word used by the early missionaries to designate their mission stations. This section stretches from the power- house along the river for one and a half miles; its width varies from one-half to three-quarters of a mile. Most of the homes in the Aldeia are of palm thatch. The population here is a mixture of Indian, Negro, and White. It is in this section of Santarem that the pottery and stone artifacts of the early Indian habitants may be found, and where enthusiastic Brazilian amateur archaeologists go treasure-hunting.' Because of its location at the mouth of a river which extends far south into the interior and which, at its northern extremity, enters the Amazon with its east- west traffic, Santarem is important commercially. No doubt in ancient times this area was equally important and for the same reason; possibly it was comparatively more important in the pre-European period than it is today, as its population then is reported to have been greater than the present one. Since the archaeology we shall study comes not only from Santarem and vicinity but from further up the Tapajos and from neighboring areas as well, some data on the character and extent of the Valley may serve to make the problem clearer. The Tapaj6s ranks sixth among the Amazon's tribu- taries, yet it is a considerable river.' It is formed by the union of the Juruena and the Arinos, the sources of which are in the State of Mato Grosso; the former rises in the Serra dos Parecis, the latter in the Serra de Arapore, higher elevations of the great Planalto Central of Brazil. The length of the Tapaj6s from its mouth to the source of the Arinos is 1,992 kilometers (1,235 miles) ; it is navigable by small steamers for 278 kilometers (172.4 miles), that is, as far as Sao Luiz, at the foot of the Cachoeira Maranhaozinho; this stretch is known as the Lower Tapajos. The Upper Tapajos is, to use the Brazilian expression, muito encachoeirada, and naviga- ble only by igarites, or other small craft, capable of being guided through the rapids by skilled boatmen, or light enough to be carried, or dragged over-land to circumvent the numerous waterfalls.3 The width of the Tapaj6s varies considerably. It is narrowest at its mouth, opposite Santarem, where its width is only 1,500 meters, or hardly a mile. It is widest only a few miles to the south at the mouth of the Arapiuns where its width is 12,000 meters, or about 1 Townsend, letter, April 20, 1955. 2 Bates, 1892: 216. 3 Le Cointe, 1945: 54. 7.5 miles. At the point of its bifurcation in the extreme south, its width is 2,000 meters or 1.25 miles.4 In the literature of the exploration of the Tapajos, references to its color are numerous, and there seems to be little agreement on the subject. Le Cointe describes it as "dark but transparent";5 Sioli states that its waters are a "clear dark green"; 6 to Smith, it was "black";7 Agassiz mentions the impressive effect pro- duced by the meeting, near Santarem, of the "black" waters of the Tapaj6s and the great yellow volume of the Amazon;8 Chandless refers to the "blackish tint" of the lower river.9 To Wallace, however, the Tapajos appeared blue.10 Observing the river at Santarem, my own eye seemed to be in agreement with Wallace; my camera film, also, registered the river a deep, greenish blue. Further up stream, glimpsed in the midday sun from between the rubber trees on the plateau at Belterra, the river still seemed blue, but blue under a silvery sheen. Thus, whatever the scientific classifica- tion of its color may be, the Tapaj6s interprets its beauty in various lights and to each one individually. I have visited Santarem twice. In 1941 I was there for three days, kindly accommodated by the Sister- nurses of the old hospital. In 1953 I stopped there to photograph the Liebold collection on my way up the Tapaj6s to Belterra. Unfortunately, my transporta- tion between Santarem and Belterra was at night both ways, and thus I did not actually see the river except at these terminal points. A great deal of enthusiastic descriptive matter has been written about the Tapajos by scientists who spent long periods in the Valley. I shall quote from some of these writers that we may have a better understanding of the physical features of the Valley-the background against which the Tapajo and other tribes lived, the landscape which met their eyes, their possibilities for trade, their means of sustenance. Bates describes his arrival at Santarem on his first visit as follows: . . . At 9 A. M. we passed the mouth of the Parana-mirim, called Mahica, and then found a sudden change in the color of the water and the aspect of the banks. Instead of the low and swampy water-frontage which had prevailed from the mouth of the Xingui, we saw before us a broad sloping beach of white sand. The forest, instead of being a tangled mass of irregular and rank vegetation as hitherto, presented a rounded outline, and created an impression of repose that was very pleasing .... 4 Other measurements recently estimated by the Comissao Brasileira Demarcadora de Limites of Belem are the following: width at Aveiros, 2,000 meters (1.25 miles); at the mouth of the Cupari, 4,500 meters (2.8 miles); at Fordlandia, 3,000 meters (1.9 miles); at Itaituba, 3,500 meters (2.2 miles); at Sao Luiz, 3,000 meters (1.9 miles).

Map of the mouth of the Tapaj6s and adjacent areas, reproduced from Brazil, the Amazons and the Coast, by H. H. Smith. Scribners, 1879. . . . It (Santarem) lies just within the mouth of the Tapajoz. . . . The situation of the town is very beautiful. The land, though but slightly elevated, does not form, strictly speaking, a portion of the alluvial river plains of the Amazon, but rather a prolongation of the Brazilian continental land. It is scantily wooded, and toward the interior consists of undulating campos, which are connected with a series of hills extending southward as far as the eye can reach. .. .11 Bates returned to Santarem in November, 1851, and made it his headquarters for three and a half years, during which period he made several journeys up the Tapajos and into surrounding areas.12 He states that: . .. To the west of the town there was a pleasant path along the beach to a little bay, called Mapiri, about five miles within the mouth of the Tapajoz. The road was prac- ticable only in the dry season. The river at Santarem rises on the average about thirty feet, varying in different years about ten feet; so that in the four months from April to July the water comes up to the marginal belt of wood. . . . About two miles on the road we come to a series of shallow pools, called Laguinhos, which are con- nected with the river in the wet season, but separated from it by a high bank of sand and topped with bushes at other times. . . . When the waters have risen to the level of the pools, this place is frequented by many kinds of wading birds. Snow-white egrets of two species stand about the margins of the water, and dusky-striped herons may be seen half-hidden under the shade of the bushes. The pools are covered with a small water-lily ....13 Beyond the Laguinhos there succeeds a tract of level beach, covered with trees, which form a beautiful grove. About the month of April, when the water rises to this level, the trees are covered with blossom, and a handsome orchid, an Epidendron with large white flowers, which clothe thickly the trunks, is profusely in bloom. Several kinds of kingfishers resort to this place .... 11 Bates, 1892: 119 ff. 12 Ibid., 180. 13 Ibid., 192 ff: Bates reports that in the Mahica woods, three miles east of Santarem, there is a generous supply of stiff white clay which supplied the pottery-makers of Santarem.'4 Journeying up the Tapajos, Smith reports: ... Every little point has its sonorous Tupi name. ... a toad-shaped rock gives its name to a point-Ponta de Cururu. . . . Rounding Ponta de Cururfi, we are fairly in the main north and south courses .... Now we see what a magnificent channel this is. The western shore is terra firma . . . but it appears only as a blue ridge eight or nine miles away: to the south there is a great open horizon. Northward, the great bay of Villa Nova gives another clear open horizon. This bay is prop- erly the mouth of the river Arapiuns, which has its origin in the hilly, densely wooded lands between the Tapajoz and the Maues. . . . Beyond lies the great lake of Villa Franca, celebrated for its pirarucfi fisheries. 15 A few miles to the south is Alter do Chao frequently referred to in missionary and other early records, and from the vicinity of which some important archaeo- logical specimens have been recovered. . . . This little settlement, Alter do Chao (Altar of the Ground, or Earth Altar), owes its singular name to the existence, at the entrance of the harbour, of one of those strange flat-topped hills which are so common in this part of the Amazons country, shaped like the high altar in Roman Catholic churches.... 16 Hartt gives the following description of the Alter, important as a source of tabatinga or fine potter's clay: The Serra Piroca, or Alter do Chao, is an isolated, very abrupt, narrow, and very short, wedge-shaped ridge, that rises right out of the bay, its height being 200 feet or less. . It forms a very prominent object and is visible for a 14Ibid., 198 if. 15 Smith, H. H., 1879: 229 ff. 16 Bates, 1892: 218. 7 VOL. 50, PT. 3, 1960]</page><page sequence="9">PALMATARY: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE LOWER TAPAJOS [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. long distance. . . . The ridge is only about 600 feet long. Its sides are very steep, destitute of trees and difficult to climb. The upper part is quite bare, whence the name pir6ca (Tupi, bald). The upper part of the hill is com- posed of a heavy bed of white tabatinga clay, baked very hard. . ... The Serra commands a magnificent view. . . 17 Referring to Alter do Chao, Smith states that the missionary village of Borary was situated there; some believed the proper name was Puerary (Puera, a bead; yg, water) because certain polished beads or ornaments, called muiraquitds, had been found in the lake in the vicinity. Continuing the voyage up the river he relates: . . . Rounding the point we lose sight of Alter do Chao. . . . We go into camp finally at a place called Aramanahy, a narrow sand beach with steep hillsides beyond. . . . The Tapajoz tobacco is considered the finest in the Amazons valley. It is cultivated on the rich black lands along the edge of these cliffs, where the Indians had their villages long ago. In the morning we climb the hill to inspect village sites, but find only a few fragments of pottery. In other places there is abundant harvest for the archeol- ogist. All along this side of the Tapajoz, from Alter do Chao to the lower rapids, the bluffs must have been lined with these villages, for the black land is almost continuous, and at many points pottery and stone implements cover the ground like shells on a surf-washed beach. This black land is near the river; back in the forest, so far as we know, there is only yellow loam and clay, without a trace of ancient occupation. (Footnote: On the other side there is also black land with pottery, but I know nothing of its extent.) The forest covers all this high land, a plateau, con- tinuous with the hills of Panema and Diamentina. All day we sailed by bluffs like those of Aramanahy, almost a straight line, perfectly flat on top, some three hundred feet above the river. . . . On the western side there is Boim, ancient mission village of Santo Ignacio .... The river is narrower now, hardly five miles wide, and, a little above, the channel is divided by low islands.... We have left the lake-like expanse of the lower Tapajoz, and are entering the region below the falls ... 18 Smith's next stop was at Aveiros which Bates de- scribes as a sort of headquarters for the fire ant: . . . The Tapajoz is nearly free of insect pests of other parts, mosquitoes, sand-flies, notucas, and piums; but the formiga de fogo is perhaps a greater plague than all the others put together. . . . Aveiros was deserted for a few years before my visit on account of this little tor- mentor. . . .19 The next village of any size in the ascent of the river is Itaituba. In Smith's time this was a settlement of some fifty houses arranged in a row along the edge of a bluff high above the Tapajos. The town contained about twenty white families, most of whom were en- gaged in trade, largely outside the village, their canoes making voyages far up among the rapids to barter for rubber and drugs with Mundurucu.20 In this area there 17Hartt, 1874: 34. 18 Smith, 1879: 237 if. 19 Bates, 1892: 227. 20 Smith, H. H., 1879: 246. is a proverb: "II n'y a pas d'enfer pour les cachoeristes, car ils ont assez fait leur purgatoire." 21 One cachoeira is named Misericordia because, "Emportes par un courant furieux, les malheureux qui n'ont pas pu maitriser l'impulsion de leur canot ne peuvent que crier 'Misericorde!' " 22 In illustration of the difficulty of passing some of these rapids, Smith translates Barbosa Rodrigues' thrilling account of the negotiation of one of them, and states that the Indians employed in this dangerous work were Mundurucu from villages near the rapids; sometimes, also, Maue were used.23 Not far above Itaituba, great cliffs of limestone flank the river and are conspicuous up and down for miles. The Brazilians call these cliffs Pared5o or Great Wall. Some twenty miles above the village- . . . the water is foaming over rocks at Maranhaozinho; above there are other and greater falls and rapids, a long series with intervals of still water, to the sources of the Tapajoz in the rivers Arinos and Juruena. . . .24 Chandless began his exploration in the Upper Tapajo6s and traveled northward. He writes: The various streams that run from the province of Matto Grosso northwards to the Amazons, or south to the River Plate, all take their rise in what, though commonly called a serra, has in reality nothing of a mountainous character. It is simply a high range of country, varying little in ele- vation, though deeply grooved by valleys and rivers .... The range . . . drops steeply and often precipitously to the lower country, the plain below appearing as a sea with deep bays and inlets. At the foot of the range, in one of these inlets stands the Villa do Diamantino. . . . Canoes have, now and then, been brought over the watershed; while I was in Diamantino, one of 15cwt. burden that had come from near Santarem crossed and went down the Paraguay to Villa Maria. . ...25 [See Map of the Rivers Arinos, Juruena and Tapajos.] Thus, it is possible, with a short portage, to travel from the Amazon system into that of La Plata. But the journey is a hazardous one. The literature of the exploration of the Upper Tapajos suggests fairly close proximity of some of its other tributaries to those of neighboring systems, but always with difficult passage from one to the other. Because of the nature of the country, the rivers of Amazonia are the principal highways. . . . For the populations of the interior, rivers and lakes substitute for roads, and (in addition) furnish the basic foods such as fish, tartarugas, aquatic birds.... The rivers are the very arteries of the life of the area. All trade is made by means of them, and on their banks unfolds the whole of the human story . . 26 The above was written of Amazonia today, when the airplane makes regular trips up and down the river, 21Coudreau, 1897: 13. 22 Ibid., 75. 23 Smith, 1879: 252. 24 Ibid., 250. 25Chandless, 1862: 269 ff. 26 Sioli, 1951: 4 ff. 8</page><page sequence="10">HISTORICAL NOTES sometimes coming to rest on its muddy waters, at a few points landing on its banks. In pre-European Amazonia, when watercraft was the only means of transportation, the rivers and lakes must have been even more important than they are at present. It seems natural, therefore, that the blacklands mark- ing the sites of ancient villages should be found along the bluffs of the Lower Tapajos. Here the climate was good, the land high above the waters, even in the season of flood. The lower river was easily navigable, and offered trade possibilities, not only with neighbor- ing villages but with the Amazon itself and its numerous tributaries. Some of these trade routes are revealed by the archaeology. The Tapaj6s furnished to those who dwelt on its banks not only sustenance from the river and fine woods and vegetable products from the surrounding area, but abundant clay for their pottery and a great variety of stone for their implements. The fauna of the valley supplied the inspiration for their art. Unfortunately, historically, the rivers and lakes served as highways for the invader and the slave-hunter as well as for the native himself. It was then that the regions of the falls and the rapids throughout Amazonia, areas too difficult for the prosperity of the white man, became to the Indian a refuge preventing, perhaps, his extinction.27 HISTORICAL NOTES Vicente Yafiez Pinzon, sailing from Spain in Novem- ber of 1499, attained the Pernambucan coast of Brazil in January, 1500.1 In February he was navigating near the equator and, having encountered fresh water forty leagues at sea, steered landward to determine the source. Thus, he discovered the mouth of the Amazon. The record says that he did not tarry long because "it appeared to him to be dangerous." He named this great estuary Mar Dulce or Fresh-Water Sea, a name it retained until about 1513.2 However, the real dis- covery of the Amazon did not take place until almost a half-century after Pinzon's adventure. It was born of necessity, and came from the west. For several years Spaniards living in Inca territory had been hearing of rich lands to the east-the provinces of El Dorado and La Canela, areas supposedly abound- ing in precious metals and cinnamon trees, where settlements were numerous. Gonzalo Pizarro, having received from his brother, Francisco, an appointment to the governorship of Quito and other towns in the north, began, upon his arrival there early in December of 1540, to investigate these rumors. Quite promptly he decided to undertake an expedition in search of this wealth, and immediately undertook the organization of men and supplies for this purpose. 7 Gourou, 1950: 192. 1 Capistrano de Abreu, n. d.: 21 ff. 2 Medina, 1934: 153 ff. By the end of February, 1541, preparations had been completed and the expedition departed from Quito. It consisted of some four thousand Indians who had been held in custody to serve as carriers, two hundred and twenty Spaniards, many of them men of promi- nence, and almost as many horses as Spaniards. Two friars went along, Gonzalo de Vera of the Order of Mercy, and Gaspar de Carvajal, a Dominican. Arque- buses, crossbows, and a large supply of munitions made up part of the baggage. Llamas served as beasts of burden. More than two thousand pigs were driven along to insure a food supply, while almost as many hunting dogs were included in the expedition, these for the dual purpose of aiding in the search for game and for warfare against the natives. Experienced Indian guides and a few Spaniards, who had some knowledge of the area to the east, were supposed to insure a happy arrival at the lands of plenty. In crossing the first Andean range more than one hundred Indians died of cold. Further on, forests had to be pierced, streams had to be crossed. Finally the expedition rested in the Valley of Zumaco. Here it was joined by Francisco de Orellana with some twenty followers he had organized as part of the Pizarro adventure. Pizarro immediately made Orellana his lieutenant-general. After months of exploration and the loss of prac- tically all the servants and the food animals, Pizarro decided to build a brigantine upon which the sick, the friars, and the remainder of the munitions and other supplies could be placed and carried forward. The records say that at first Orellana opposed this plan but, as soon as Pizarro's decision became final, he took over much of the responsibility for the construction of the craft. When ready, the brigantine was sent down river under the command of Juan de Alcantara. Pizarro, the remainder of the men and the horses followed along the bank. A series of reverses plagued the Pizarro expedition from the outset. It is reported that La Canela was found but that the spice trees were widely scattered; the terrain was extremely difficult, the streams swift and numerous; there were cold, famine, earthquake, and the hostilities of the natives. El Dorado was never located. For the purpose of this study the details of the expedition are not relevant; also the story varies from record to record. One fact, however, is estab- lished-at a certain point, possibly on the Coca above its juncture with the Cosanga, Orellana suggested to Pizarro that he be given the brigantine, some canoes and a number of soldiers, and that he would go ahead to a province which the Indians had assured him could supply food in abundance, and that he would return to the main body of the expedition within a limited number of days. Pizarro agreed. The story is that, after nine days of travel, Orellana found it impossible to return because of the exhaustion of his men and the swiftness of the current of the VOL. 50, PT. 3, 1960] 9</page><page sequence="11">PALMATARY: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE LOWER TAPAJOS [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. river down which he had come-the Napo. The state- ments of Pizarro and Carvajal differ considerably with regard to the original agreement between Pizarro and Orellana concerning the latter's return; be that as it may, Orellana decided to build another brigantine and to go ahead. Pizarro and the remainder of the ex- pedition were compelled to find their way back to Quito as best they could. Orellana entered the Marafion on Feburary 11, 1542; he and his weary followers reached the Atlantic coast on August 26 of the same year.3 We shall have occasion to return to this story of the first descent of the Amazon, but for the present purpose the question arises as to whether Orellana and his men touched land near the mouth of the Tapajos. Friar Gaspar de Carvajal became the chronicler of this eventful voyage to the sea. He describes several Indian settlements which Orellana and his followers saw and where they fought; he states that the Rio Negro was so named on this journey; he relates the Amazon story; tells of a settlement on the left bank where the Indians were stained black. The Province of the Black-stained Men appears on Medina's map just east of the mouth of the Trombetas. Carvajal continues his story, still referring to the left bank: We went on pursuing our course down river, and at the end of two days we came upon a small village where the Indians offered resistance to us, but we routed them and seized the food supplies and (then) continued on, and (we captured) another (village) that was close to it, a larger one; here the Indians put up a resistance and fought for the space of half an hour, so well and with so much bravery, that before we had a chance to leap out on land they killed on board the larger brigantine a companion whose name was Antonio Carranza, a native of Burgos. In this village the Indians were familiar with some kind of poisonous plant, for this became evident from the wound of the aforesaid man, because at the end of twenty-four hours he surrendered his soul to God. They captured this village, "collected all the maize the brigantine could hold," then crossed to the opposite bank of the Amazon. Carvajal continues: We forged ahead at great haste, steering away from inhabited country, and one day in the afternoon we went off to get some sleep in an oak grove which was at the mouth of a river that emptied, on the right, into the one down which we were navigating and was a league wide. The Captain gave orders to cross over in order to get our sleep where I have said, because it looked as if close to the shore of said river there was no inhabited district and we could sleep without worry, although the country farther inland appeared to be thickly populated; of this we were not afraid, and we stopped in the said oak grove, and here the Captain gave orders for putting up some railings on the brigantines in the manner of fortifications for protec- tion against arrows, and of no little use did they turn out to be for us. We had not been long in this stopping-place when there came a great quantity of canoes and pirogues, to keep watch on us, without, on the other hand, doing us 3 Ibid., chapters VI, VII; map, p. 48. any harm, and in this manner they did nothing but keep going up and down. We stayed in this place a day and a half .... Soon after that the Captain gave the order for us to depart from this spot, because it seemed to him that there were many people about and that in the night, as he thought, they had put everything in order for falling upon us; it was a night in which the Captain ordered us to pass tied to oars, because no place was found to sleep on the land, and this was a heavenly grant, for, if they (i.e, our men) had found (a place) at which to go ashore, few of us would have remained, or (rather) not one, who could have given any news of the voyage. . . . the Indians came in pursuit of us by land and by water . . . and in this situation we remained until day came, when the Cap- tain ordered us to begin to move on. Here we recognized that we were not very far from the sea, because the flowing of the tide extended to where we were, whereat we re- joiced not a little in the realization that we could not fail to reach the sea. As we started to move on . . . within a short time we discovered an arm of a river not very wide, out of which we saw coming forth two squadrons of pirogues with a very great clamor and outcry, and each one of these squad- rons headed for the brigantines and began to attack us and to fight like ravenous dogs; and, if it had not been for the railings that had been built farther back, we should have come out of this skirmish decidedly decimated . . . but after all we did not escape without damage, because they killed another companion of ours, Garcia de Soria, a native of Logrono; and in truth the arrow did not pene- trate half a finger, but, as it had poison on it, he did not linger twenty-four hours. . . . We went on fighting in this manner from the time the sun came up until it was some- what past ten o'clock, for they did not let us rest one moment; on the contrary, there were more and more war- riors every hour, indeed the river was all cluttered up with pirogues, and this (was) because we were in a land thickly inhabited and one belonging to an overlord whose name was Nurandaluguaburabara. [Note: In another manuscript, Ichipayo]. . . . When this was over, the Captain ordered us to cross over to the left side of the river to avoid the settled section of the country ....4 Neither "Tapajos" nor "Tapajo" appears in the Carvajal record, although Nimuendajufi suggests the possibility that "Tapaj6" might be related to "Chipayo," evidently the form of the chief's name in the text with which he was familiar.5 However, it seems that the Tapajos must have been the river, together with a neighboring stream, referred to by Carvajal. The reasons are the following: The Tapajos enters the Amazon from its right bank. It is east of the northern tributary where Orellana encountered the "Amazons." The tide reaches the Tapajos.6 Most of the archaeology is somewhat inland. The amount of the archaeology suggests that the area was thickly populated, and the Portuguese found it to be so many years later. The nations on the Tapajos and those on the op- 4 Ibid., 224 ff. 5 Nimuendajui, 1949: 93. 6Carvalho, 1942: 347. 10</page><page sequence="12">HISTORICAL NOTES posite bank of the Amazon were famous in the early colonial period for their poisoned arrows. Oviedo, who based his record of the Orellana ex- pedition on information he received in Santo Domingo directly from Orellana and his associates, includes in his Historia the following statement: They came upon and saw countless islands inhabited and completely occupied by people using various sorts of weapons, and (on) some, (men) who fight with sticks and "estoricas" and "macanas," and on others, with bows and arrows; but the arrow men have no (baneful) herb until (one gets down to) those who are two hundred leagues back from the sea, for from there down they shoot (arrows smeared) with it and employ it as a diabolical and most vicious poison.7 Three-quarters of a century later, the first Portuguese settlers found the situation as thus reported-the use of poisoned arrows extended from at least "two hundred leagues back from the sea" to Marajo Island at the mouth of the Amazon.8 The first definite information that we have con- cerning the Indians of the Tapajos Valley dates from the expedition of Pedro Teixeira to that Valley in 1626. Berredo sums up the story as follows: Manoel de Souza understood well the needs of the Capi- tania and, not doubting that the most important was res- gates 9 of Tapuya10 slaves for its service, entrusted this responsibility to Captain Pedro Teixeira. Thus the Cap- tain, accompanied by Padre Fr. Christovao de S. Joseph, a Capuchin of Santo Antonio, left Belem with twenty-six soldiers and a considerable number of Indians. However, when they arrived at the settlement of the Tapuyusus, they received the information that these Indians traded with a very populous tribe on the Tapajoz which took its name from this river. [The Portuguese] "1 soon leaving the Amazon on which they were traveling, entered that one [the Tapajos] for a dozen leagues until they reached a cove of crystalline waters against a back-drop of beauti- ful woodland, a charming locality.12 Here they found the new Tapuyas, already advised of their visit by their friends the Tapuyusus, who had been generously bribed by the Captain. However, Teixeira, disembarking close to the settlement and mindful of the inconstancy of fortune, forti- 7 Medina, 1934: 398. 8 Palmatary, 1950: 259. 9 Resgate can mean ransom, but in the Amazonia of this period, it usually referred to obtaining slaves by any conven- ient means. 10 Tapuya. The term Tapuya, capitalized or otherwise, and tapuio do not refer to any specific tribe, but are general terms for Indians or "other Indians." "Sr. Joao Francisco Lisboa states that the term tapuya, today tapuio, served to designate any or all Indians regardless of tribe" (Macedo, 1906: 248). Samuel Fritz, speaking of the Omagua living on the islands, stated that they referred to the mainland Indians as Tapuyas (Edmundson, ed., 1922: 49). Smith states: "The Indians of the Tupi nation used the word tapuya to designate the roving tribes of the interior. The name, modified in the Portuguese, has since been applied by the whites to all semi-civilized Indians including the Tupi themselves" (Smith, H. H., 1879: 146). 11 The insertions are my own. 12 Nimuendajfi suggests that the first meeting of the Tapajo and the Portuguese may have been in the vicinity of the present Alter do Chao (Nimuendajuf, 1949: 93). fied himself in true military fashion until he could be satis- fied of the trustworthiness of these Indians and that he could deal with them with confidence. He found them not very barbarous.... The Portuguese remained here for a few days; their relations with the Indians were friendly. Then, having gathered up some fine mats and other novelties, they returned to Paria, very pleased with their discovery but with few slaves, as the Tapaj6 set great store by their slaves and would not part with them.13 The next definite information we have regarding the tribes of the Tapajos is concerned with another his- toric descent of the Amazon. In 1635 the Franciscans of Quito decided to under- take the evangelization of certain tribes on the Aguarico. Eventually a small group established themselves a little above the junction of the Aguarico and the Napo among the Encabellados under the protection of Captain Juan de Palacios and ninety soldiers.14 The missionary effort was not very successful and terminated definitely when Palacios was killed by the Encabellados in revenge for punishment he had meted out to a member of the tribe. Most of the Spaniards returned to Quito; but six soldiers, among them Francisco Fernandez, a Portuguese who had been to Belem, and two priests, Frei Domingos de Brieba and Frei Andre de Toledo, decided to attempt to reach the Atlantic. In a fragile canoe, with two native oarsmen who deserted en route, the wayfarers began the descent of the Napo, October 17, 1636.15 The report is that when, on their long journey, they reached the territory of the "Rapajosos," they were robbed by the natives who also tore off their clothes."6 Another account states that they were treated well.17 In February of 1637 the travelers arrived at the first European settlement on the Amazon, the little fort of Gurupia; from here they continued their way to Belem and finally to Sao Luiz where the governor, Jacombe Raymundo de Noronha, heard their story with interest. After some consideration, Noronha decided to send an expedition back to Quito, and he chose Captain Pedro Teixeira to organize it and to lead it. The company was a large one consisting of seventy soldiers, more than a thousand native bowmen besides women and children. It left Cameta, October 26, 1637. Frei Domingos de Brieba and three of the soldiers who had descended the river accompanied Teixeira on the return trip. The journey up stream was a long one in both miles and time, but at last Teixeira and part of the expedition- ary force arrived at Quito where they were warmly welcomed. Shortly afterward, however, Teixeira re- ceived instructions from the Viceroy to return at once 13 Berredo, 1905: 1: 225 ff. 14 Markham, tr. and ed., 1859: xxii ff. 15 Reis, 1931: 32 ff. 16 Laureano de la Cruz, 1653: 53. 7 Rojas, 1889: 86.

At that period Portugal was part of the Spanish domain and, in the opinion of the Viceroy, the soldiers were needed on the coast. Thus another descent of the Amazon began February 10 (or 12), 1639. Several priests accompanied Teixeira on this return trip, but it is to a Jesuit, Padre Christovam de Acufia, that we owe a valuable record of the sights and events of this voyage. Teixeira and his companions arrived in Belem December 12, 1639.18 Acufia describes, in a general way, the weapons, food, social customs, and religious beliefs of the tribes the Teixeira expedition passed in the descent of the Ama- zon; but, when he comes to the Tapajos, he goes into detail concerning what, to him, was a situation for deepest concern and regret. He writes: Forty leagues from this narrow part, on the south side, is the mouth of the great and beautiful river of the Tapa- josos, taking the name from the tribe which lives on its banks, which are well peopled with savages, living in a good land full of abundant supplies. These Tapajosos are a brave race, and are much feared by the surrounding nations, because they use so strong a poison in their ar- rows, that if once blood is drawn, death is sure to follow. For this reason the Portuguese avoided any intercourse with them for some time, desiring to draw them into friendly relations. However, they received us very well, and lodged us together in one of their villages, containing more than five hundred families, where they never ceased all day from bartering fowls, ducks, hammocks, fish, flour, fruit, and other things with such confidence that women and children did not avoid us; offering, if we would leave our lands, and come and settle there, to receive us peacefully all their lives. The humble offers of these Tapajosos did not satisfy a set of people as are those of these conquests, who only undertake difficult enterprises from a covetous desire to obtain slaves for which the Tapajosos were placed in a convenient position. Suspecting that this nation had many slaves in their service, they treated them like rebels, and came to attack them. This was going on when we arrived at the fort of Desterro, where the people were assembled for this inhuman work and though, by the best means I could, I tried, as I could not stop them, at least to induce them to wait until they had received new orders from the King; and the Sargente Mayor and chief of all, who was Benito Maciel, son of the Governor, gave me his word that he would not proceed with his intended work, until he had heard from his father; yet I had hardly turned my back when, with as many troops as he could get, in a launch with a piece of artillery and other smaller vessels, he fell upon the Indians suddenly with harsh war, when they desired peace. They surrendered, however, with good will as they had always offered to do, and submitted to all the Portuguese desired. The latter ordered them to de- liver up all their poisoned arrows, which were the weapons they most dreaded. The unfortunate Indians obeyed at once; and when they were disarmed, the Portuguese col- lected them together like sheep, in a strong enclosure with a sufficient guard over them. They then let loose the friendly Indians, each one of them being an unchained devil for mischief and, in a short time they gutted the vil- 18 Rodrigues, 1684: 110 ff.; Markham tr. and ed., 1859: 55 ff.; Reis, 1931: 34 ff. lage without leaving a thing in it and, as I was told by an eye witness, cruelly abused the wives and daughters of the captives before their eyes. Such acts were committed that my informer, who is a veteran in these conquests, declared he would have left off buying slaves, and even given the value of those he possessed, not to have beheld them. The cruelty of the Portuguese, excited by the desire for these slaves, did not cease until they had obtained them. They threatened the captive Indians with fresh outrages if they did not produce their slaves, assuring them that if they obeyed, they should not only go free, but be treated with friendship, and supplied with tools and linen clothes, which they should receive in exchange. What could the unfortunates do ? Themselves prisoners, their arms taken, their homes pillaged, their wives and children ill-treated, but yield to everything their oppressors desired ? They offered to give up a thousand slaves whom, when they were attacked, they placed in concealment; and, not being able to find more than two hundred, they col- lected them and delivered them up, giving their word that the remainder should be found, and even offered their own children as slaves. All these were sent down to Marafion and Para, and I saw them myself .... Returning, however, to the subject of the Tapajosos, and to the famous river which bathes the shores of their country, I must relate that it is of such depth, to a distance of many leagues, that in times past an English ship of great burden ascended it, those people intending to make a settlement in this province, and to prepare harvests of tobacco. They offered the natives advantageous terms, but the latter suddenly attacked the English and would accept no other than the killing of all the strangers they could get into their hands, and the seizure of their arms which they have to this day. They forced them to depart quicker than they had come . . 19 Nimuendajui locates Desterro near the mouth of the Rio Paru ; he then continues: Later on, the Portuguese continued this policy, as ap- pears from the report of the Franciscan fathers Laureano de la Cruz and Juan de Quincoces of the year 1650. Either to avoid the outrages inflicted on them by the Portuguese, who demanded slaves, or hoping for some payment, the Tapaj6 named any hostile tribe of the neighborhood as their fugitive slaves, helping the Portuguese to attack and capture it (Laureano de la Cruz, 1900, p. 396; 1942, p. 58). Thus the Tapaj6, to avoid slavery for themselves, turned slavers.20 In early Amazonian records the province of the Tapajo is always referred to as populous; however the approximate number of its inhabitants is a matter for conjecture. Concerning this problem Nimuendajui makes the following statement: The tribe seems to have been numerous. Orellana was obliged by the density of the hostile population on the right bank of the Amazon to continue his voyage near the opposite side. Acufia speaks of a village of more than 500 families (Acufia, 1891: 182) a figure which corre- sponds to a total population of 2,500 souls, more or less. Heriarte (1874: 35) calls it the largest known village and says it could put 60,000 bowmen in the field. This last figure, however, represents either a misprint or an enor- mous exaggeration, for it would imply a population of 19 Markham, tr. and ed., 1859: 124 ff. 20 Rowe, tr. and ed., 1952: 3 ff. 12</page><page sequence="14">HISTORICAL NOTES some 240,000. The remains of the ancient settlement indi- cate an exceptionally numerous population.21 Heriarte further describes the Tapajo as "corpulent, tall and strong." 22 From the records, it seems they could be either friendly or warlike, whichever the situation at the moment seemed to indicate would be to their advantage. The real colonization of the Tapajos is considered to have begun with the effort of the Jesuits to catechize the tribes of that river. While other missionaries must have passed by in 1657 and 1658 on their way to the Rio Negro, the first one to have gone there for the express purpose of visiting these Indians was the famous Antonio Vieira in 1659. Two years later, in 1661, Vieira sent Padre Tome Ribeiro and Padre Gaspar Misch to the Tapajos where they found six different tribes. The missionaries were well received, the Indians offering to trade their manioc, maize, fowl, honey, fish, and dried meat for the usual knives, mirrors, axes, glass beads. During their stay the padres baptized a few natives and, amid a great commotion, erected a large cross. A month later, the missionary whose Chronica of the early Jesuit missions on the Amazon has been of such importance to students-Joao Felippe Betendorf -arrived.23 Betendorf brought with him to the Tapajos, Irmao Sebastiao Teixeira who supposedly knew the languages of the Indians of this river. Not only chieftains of five tribes of the area, but others as well with women and children, greeted the missionaries. These natives brought gifts which they called putabas. The next day more Indians from the interior arrived; these also brought gifts. The missionaries were conducted to a small palm-thatch dwelling, hardly more than a terrace, with two cubicles. A tiny cottage beside it was dedi- cated to the saying of the Mass.24 Mauricio de Heriarte, who passed up the Amazon a year after the establishment of the Aldeia of the Tapajo, reported four of its tribes to be: Tapajos, Marautus, Caguanas, Orurucozos, but he says that there were other tribes with which, at that time, the Portu- guese had had no communication.25 Irmao Sebastiao Teixeira soon proved to be an un- satisfactory assistant, claiming illness and unhappiness in his new appointment; finally Betendorf decided to take him down river. When Betendorf returned to the Tapajos he brought with him Alferes Joao Correa, son of the Capitao-Mor of Ceara, an officer familiar with the interior, a good linguist, and well known for his bleeding and other curative measures. The Indians of the Tapajos knew (or knew of) Joao Correa and welcomed him cordially, calling him their atoassana 21Ibid., 5 ff. 22Heriarte, 1874: 35. 23Leite, 1943: 3: 357 if. 24Betendorf, 1910: 161. 25Heriarte, 1874: 35 ff. "which means compadre," thus suggesting their friendliness. Immediately after their arrival, Betendorf, with the help of Joao Correa and certain Indian chieftains who were good linguists, translated the catechism from the lingua geral (Tupi) into the language of the Tapajo and of the Urucucus "which they commonly under- stood" and, with these, Betendorf carried on his mission.26 To the best of our present knowledge, these transla- tions no longer exist. We find that, once established among the populous Tapajo, Betendorf, with the help of Joao Correa and the Indians and their womenfolk, built an adobe church; its retable was decorated by the missionary himself. However, soon after, Betendorf found it necessary to return to Para.27 Nimuendajuf sums up the history of the Aldeia of the Tapajo as follows: When, thirty years after its foundation, P. Bettendorff [sic] again visited the mission, the settlement, formerly so populous, was completely ruined. On the hill, to the foot of which the village had been moved, Manoel de Mata Falcao had built a fort. The Indians had been made to serve as bearers and to work in other places. The church had disappeared and only some five or six huts, scattered and in disrepair, remained standing. Bettendorff had a thatched chapel built in which to say Mass. In 1698 the mission recovered somewhat again, thanks to the efforts of Jesuit P. Manoel Rebelo, who transferred to it fresh Indians brought from their own lands. But he was no more successful than his predecessor in protecting the Indians from the violence of the Portuguese garrison. Consequently he founded, further up the river on the left bank of the Tapajos, a mission of Arapiun (Arapiyu) Indians named Cumaru, now Vila Franca, and transferred to it the Tapajo tribe along with Comandys, Goanacuas Marxagoaras, Apuatias, Arapucuis, Andiragoaris, (-- Maue of the Andira?) and others (Moreira Pinto, 1894-1899: 1). With this transfer it appears that the Tapajo and Urucucfi ceased to exist as tribes. When P. Bettendorff (sic) finished his Chronica at the end of the seventeenth century (1698) the populous village at the mouth of the Tapajos and the numerous villages of the interior had been completely destroyed, to the great profit of the white settlers. The tribal names Tapajos and Urucuf appear for the last time in the list of native tribes of the Tapajos River given by Ricardo Franco de Almeida Serra in 1779 (Almeida Serra, 1869: 5). Martius found that the Tapajoc6s were completely extinct in 1820 (Mar- tius, 1867: 1: 382).28 Historical notes on the Tapajo seem sketchy and, at times, somewhat contradictory, but they suggest the confused and tragic conditions which developed among the native population as a result of the white man's efforts to conquer the area and to impose upon its civilizations a new and totally different set of stand- ards as well as slavery. The first mission station on the Tapajos was orig- 26Betendorf, 1910: 164 ff. 27Ibid., 169. 28Rowe, tr. and ed., 1952: 4 ff. VOL. 50, PT. 3, 1960] 13</page><page sequence="15">PALMATARY: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE LOWER TAPAJOS [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. inally named Residencia de Santo In'acio. By 1665 it had become of great importance because it was on the direct route of the Portuguese entradas into the Negro and the Solim6es. By 1678 the mission's name had been changed to that of Todos os Santos; it contained "quatro naojes principais das linguas 'Aretuses, Ara- piunses, e Tapiruenses ou Serranos.'" The Serranos, according to Heriarte, were the Indians from the Serras of Gurupatuba. Betendorf, having laid the foundation of the Tapajo mission, was succeeded there by Padres Manuel Pires, Joao Gorzoni and, in 1698, Manuel Rebelo. In 1730 the Aldeia of the Tapajo, proper, contained 793 Indians. In 1758 the site of the mission became the town of Santarem. In 1758, also, Vila Franca became a town, apparently the outgrowth of missions to the Arapiuns and other tribes.29 From even such a limited record of early mission activities on the Tapajos, it is evident that, originally, the lower river was not only thickly populated, but that tribes other than the Tapajo were established there before the coming of the Europeans. Also to be kept in mind is that, after the decimation of the original tribes, the missionaries brought in tribes from other areas and relocated them in the vicinity of the original Aldeia of the Tapajo. Such historical records make more understandable the variety of design and technique in the archaeology of the area, and also the fact that collections from Lago Grande de Vila Franca usually contain some Tapajo material, while those from San- tarem consist not only of Tapaj6 specimens but of ex- amples of Tapajo design combined with some other tradition, as well as decoration totally foreign to the Tapajo6 style. TAPAJO CIVILIZATION LANGUAGE Nimuendajui thinks that the name of the chief Chipayo, whom Carvajal mentions, may have also been the name of the tribe. He says that on the earliest maps the form of the tribal name is Topaio. Later, other spellings appear-Topayos (P. Samuel Fritz); Rapajosos, Trapajosos (P. Laureano); Estrapajoses, Tapajotos, and Tapajocos. Hartt writes it Tupaio because it was so pronounced by the habitants of the area. In Nimuendaju's opinion, neither of the two tribes at the mouth of the Tapajos for whom the catechism was translated (Tapajo and Urucucufi) spoke Tupi, or the lingua geral as it was called. In support of this view he points out that when Betendorf first visited the area in 1661, he talked to the natives through an in- terpreter, and, as he was the author of several books 29Leite, 1943: 3: 358 ff.; Braga, 1920: 523. in the lingua geral, this would not have been necessary had the tribes known the language. He states that the only three proper names in the Tapaj6 language which have come down to us are the name of the tribe, that of one of its chieftains-Orucur/a, and that of the Devil -Aura, after Heriarte. Nimuendajui also notes that while a great number of local Indian names of the Tapajos Valley belong to the lingua geral which, at the time of his writing, was not entirely extinct in the vicinity of Alter do Chao, others, without doubt, be- long to non-Tupi languages and that some of the place names are explainable in Carib. We get the name of a single tribal chieftain from the fact that, in 1686, the Tapajo and the "Aruryu- cuzes" under a chieftain named Orucura joined the Portuguese expeditionary force against the Aroaquizes and the Carapitenas.1 Barata takes considerable issue with Nimuendajui upon the problem of whether or not the Tapajo knew the lingua geral. Basing his comment upon the geographical limits of the Tapaj6 sites as I found them on a site map drawn by Mr. Nimuendajui (which he very generously sent to me when I was preparing my original Tapajo study,2 and which has been redrawn for this report), Barata notes that the area over which Nimuendajui found Tapajo pottery was vast; he therefore believes that, through ordinary commerce as well as through the slave trade, the Tapajo must have had relations with Tupi-speaking peoples. He also notes that, in addition to the common nouns putabas and atoassand, previously referred to (which he states are Tupi), there are five other Tupi words in the Betendorf record of the Tapajo. These are: Moacara, superior, chief. Monhangarypy, dried body of an ancestor. Payassu, great father. Porace, a dance. Xerimireco-ate, legitimate wife. Barata believes that, while the Tapajo had a specific language which was conserved by their chiefs and their elders, the lingua geral was also in common use among them.3 RELIGION With regard to the religion of the Tapajo, Betendorf describes an open and clean space in the jungle which he refers to as the Terreiro do Diabo, where the Indians danced and drank ceremonially. He further states: . . . Going there to drink and dance, they required their women to carry thither a great quantity of wine, and then to squat and place their hands over their eyes in order 1 Nimuendajui, 1949: 95 ff. 2 Palmatary, 1939. 3 Barata, 1949: A Provincia do Par!a, March 7; 1950: 2: 464 ff. 14</page><page sequence="16">TAPAJ6 CIVILIZATION not to see [the ceremony].4 Then some of the sorcerers in a loud and raucous voice would persuade those as- sembled that this was the voice of the Devil, who was putting into their heads all that they wished [to know].5 So affirmed the chieftain Roque. I went to see this ter- reiro, in order to prohibit [the ceremony], giving them permission to drink in their houses, inviting each other alternately. However, it happened one day that I saw a line of men and of women, the latter carrying their children or leading them by the hand and having large jars of wine on their heads. I asked Joao Correa why this procession of people, and he replied that they were going to dance and drink on the Terreiro do Diabo. I told him to instruct them from me to return to their homes, and if they did not obey, he should break their pots and spill the wine on the ground. At first Joao demurred for fear of the Indians, but he finally got up his courage and broke the jars with a club. The Indians did not molest him.6 Heriarte describes a tithing ceremony: . . . They have painted idols which they worship and to which they pay tithes of their cultivated fields in which they grow an abundance of maize; maize is their staple, for they do not use as much manioc for farina as the other nations. When the crops are ripe, each gives a tithe, and when it is all collected they put it in a house in which they keep their idols, saying it is a potaba (gift) for Aura, which is the name of the Devil in their language. Of this maize they make every week a quantity of wine, and on the fifth day of the week at night they take it in great jars to a threshing floor behind the town which they keep very neat and clean. There the whole nation gathers, and they begin to play trumpets and mournful and lugubrious drums for about an hour until there comes a great earthquake which seems about to cast down trees and hills; with it comes the Devil who enters an enclosure which the Indians had made for him. Then, at the arrival of the Devil, all begin to dance and sing in their language and to drink the wine until it is gone; the Devil keeps them deceived with this ceremony.7 There was another ceremonial area among the Tapajo; this one was within the settlement itself. The whites called it Mafoma. Here the "devils" thrived well as a result of the disorders which developed from continuous drinking and dancing.8 The Tapajo had a form of ancestor worship. Beten- dorf relates that when he was missionary to the Tapajos in 1661, he knew of a dried body which was suspended in a box under the roof of one of the houses 4 The caryatids are frequently little squatting female forms with their hands over their eyes. See pls. 36-f, 37-a, 72-f. 5 The brackets are mine. 6 Betendorf, 1910: 170. 7 Rowe, tr. and ed., 1952: 16 ff. 8 The actual spelling in Betendorf is Mofama (1910: 170). This probably represents a typographical error, as Nimuendajui records the form as in the above text (1949: 101). Dr. Manoel Cardoza tells me that "Mafoma is one of the several Portuguese ways of writing Mohammed" (letter, May 9, 1956). D. Maria de Lourdes Jovita sent me the further information that the early Portuguese used the word Mafoma to refer to non- Catholics, or others whom they considered impious (letter, October 12, 1956). and which had been there many years. The Tapajo called this their Monhangarypy or "first father," and worshipped it with gifts and dances. Betendorf wished to destroy this "ancestor" but had been afraid to do so because in its early days the Aldeia was populous, and also because he thought it unwise to attempt to change their beliefs too rapidly. Later, however, Padre Antonio Pereira, against the advice of the princess, Maria Moaqara, ordered the house burnt to the ground. The Indians felt the deprivation deeply but did not retaliate for fear of the whites.9 Important facts concerning the religion and social customs of the Indians of the Lower Tapajos are related by Padre Joao Daniel whose active mission work on the Amazon extended from 1751 to 1757. His Tesouro was written over a period of years while he was imprisoned in Portugal10 and this fact may account for his tendency to generalize on certain subjects, although he makes some specific statements concerning the Tapajos area. With regard to later documents, such as this one, the question arises as to how much of the material they contain is concerned with customs which were inherited from the Tapajo and other Indians who were native to the mouth of the river, and who, presumably, were the authors of much of its archaeology, and how many of the customs recorded developed as a result of the relocation there, by the missionaries, of tribes from other areas when the numbers of the original tribes, through death and slavery, had become greatly reduced. Nimuendajui sums up the Daniel report as follows: P. Joao Daniel relates, without citing the year or the name of the missionary, that there were seven mummies of ancestors kept in a secret house in the depth of the forest and known only to the elders. "On a certain day in the year the old people gather with great secrecy and go together to make a pilgrimage to it and dress them afresh with Brittany or some other cloth, which each one has." In the same house were found five "stones" which were likewise objects of veneration: "All the stones had their dedication and name, with some representation which indicated what they were good for. One was the one which presided over weddings. . . . another was prayed to for successful childbirth, and in this way the greater number had specialties, over which they presided, and special cults in the worship of those idolaters. . . . The missionary, discouraged at their little religion and much idolatry, ordered these idols or seven dried-up bodies of theirs to be burned openly in the public square, and the ashes, along with the stones, to be cast into the middle of the river. . . ." 11 The mummies referred to were sewed into their cloth coverings. About 1700 P. Manuel Rebello reported that the Tapajo had dried bodies which they regarded as idols 9 Betendorf, 1910: 154. 10 Leite, 1943: 4: 326.

SOC. and which they worshipped with proper invocation as gods of maize, mandioca, rain, sun, etc. As late as 1742, P. Luiz Alvares took from the Tapajo and the Caianas sixteen "dead bodies" which they assured him were those of the first people of the world.12 Daniel gives us, also, some interesting information concerning the religious beliefs of the Arapiuns, a tribe which had been on the Tapajos for "many" years. He states that these people worshipped the stars, the sun, and the moon, but mostly the sun and the moon. The appearance of the new moon was celebrated by a festival. Their name for the sun was Coara Cy, mother of the day. mother of the earth; their name for the moon was Ja Cy, mother of the fruits of the earth. These two heavenly bodies were regarded as divinities, creators. The missionary once saw an Indian come out of a large hut and shout that he saw the new moon. Im- mediately all the other occupants rushed out, stretched their bodies, arms, and hands upwards as if praying for health and strength. Other expressions of their adora- tion of the moon were jumping for joy, shouts of welcome and presenting to it their children."3 SOCIAL ORGANIZATION With regard to one phase of social organization among the Tapajo, Nimuendajfu writes as follows: According to Heriarte (1874, p. 39), the Tapajo were divided into "ranchos" of 20 or 30 families. Each had a chief, and there was a common chief over all, whose author- ity was obeyed. Bettendorff [sic] speaks of five chiefs of the various tribes who received him in 1661. Unfortu- nately, the term "ranchos" is not sufficiently precise to explain the social organization, for it may refer either to single communal houses or to local groups. Rojas speaks of a very large house of carved wood in which the Tapajo received the Franciscans in 1637.14 The Tapajo appear to have had a definitely noble class and also to have been matriarchal in organization. Betendorf speaks of a certain Maria Moa;ara (moa{ara meaning "very noble") who was the hereditary princess of the tribe. He states that it was the custom of the Tapajo, in addition to their chiefs, to choose a woman of high nobility whom they consulted as an oracle and whose advice they followed.15 From unpublished sources Leite tells us that Maria was first married to Chief Roque, and that after his death could have married an Indian of proper rank but, having become accustomed to Portuguese attire, did not wish to marry an Indian. She finally married Rafael Gongalves, a Brazilian who was three-fourths Portuguese and one-fourth Negro. She retained her 12 Leite, 1943: 4: 304 ff. 13Daniel, 1840: 2: 490. 14 Rowe, tr. and ed., 1952: 6. 15 Betendorf, 1910: 172. position as princess until her death when her title was supposed to pass to her nearest of kin in the female line.16 The mother of Maria Moacara was Anna who was a widow but who had a lover in the "cavalleiro" (ap- parently noble) class. When Betendorf upbraided Anna for this extra-marital relation, and offered to choose for her a husband from among the unattached chieftains or "cavalleiros," her reply was that there was no man in the tribe who was her equal in rank.17 Later, Sebastiao Teixeira, who had accompanied Betendorf on his founding mission among the Tapajo, and who was now no longer serving in the Jesuit Order, married an Indian girl who was the nearest relative to Maria Moacara and presumably her natural successor to title and position within the tribe. How- ever, this marriage angered the Tapajo who banished her and her husband from the settlement. Both died under rather mysterious circumstances, probably from poison.18 Apparently, the Tapajo had slavery before the com- ing of the Europeans. As previously reported, Pedro Teixeira's first ex- pedition to the Tapajos in 1626 was for the purpose of obtaining slaves. However, he came away with but few because the Tapajo set great store by their slaves and would not part with them.19 Acufia reported that the Tapajo hid their slaves when the Portuguese raided the area in 1639.20 Later, however, it seems that they traded their slaves to the Portuguese for implements.21 Then there is the pathetic story told by Betendorf. After having baptized a number of Tapajo children, he accidently found a small child dying on the bare ground in the corner of an empty rancho. When he upbraided the Tapajo for so treating this infant and for not bringing him with the other children to be baptized, their excuse was that he was a slave.22 Tapajo society was polygynous, and adulterous wives were tossed into the river.23 Seemingly, by the time Daniel visited the Tapajos, almost a century after the first mission to the tribes had been founded by Betendorf, the Tapajo had be- come inconspicuous. The tribe on the river which seems to have impressed Daniel most was the Arapiuns, and he leaves some interesting notes concerning them. He tells us that at the first sign of puberty a girl was suspended under the roof of the house, sometimes for twelve or fifteen days with a minimum of food and water; some died of starvation, thirst, and heat. Her 16 Leite, 1943: 3: 360. 17Betendorf, 1910: 172. 18 Ibid., 341 ff. 19 Berredo, 1905: 1: 226. 20Markham, tr. and ed., 1859: 124 ff. 21 Heriarte, 1874: 38. 22 Betendorf, 1910: 168. 23Ibid., 171. 16</page><page sequence="18">TAPAJO CIVILIZATION husband would be the first eligible youth she saw after her release, and after she had been scratched with cultia teeth from head to foot. The youth and his parents must agree to the match. The boys of the tribe had to prove their fitness for the responsibilities of marriage. This was accomplished during a ceremony in which the hands and arms of the youth were placed in a large gourd full of vicious, hungry ants (saubas) whose mandibles remained fastened in the flesh even after the head had been crushed. In the meantime, the elders danced and drank to the health of the tortured one. Daniels states that, while the Arapiuns appeared not to make a practice of cannibalism, they did not refuse to eat human flesh if the opportunity presented itself, and had been known to consume the bodies of tribal members who had died of disease.24 DISPOSAL OF THE DEAD As has been previously stated, some of the Tapajo dead were mummified and worshipped. According to Heriarte: When one of the Indians died, they laid him in a ham- mock and, at his feet, they placed all that he possessed in life; on his head they put a figure of the Devil wrought with a needle like a sock; they placed him in one of the houses, made for this purpose, until the flesh had dried and rotted, then the bones were ground and thrown into the wine which his relatives and friends drank.25 According to Daniel, the Arapiuns also powdered the bones of their dead, and the elders placed these in their wine for drinking on festive occasions.26 FOOD Articles offered in trade to various groups of Euro- peans who visited the area give a fairly good idea of the foods the Tapajo customarily used. As previously stated, the Teixeira expedition returning from Quito in 1639 stopped at the Tapajos; on this occasion the natives offered in trade fowl, ducks, fish, flour, and fruit. When the missionaries Ribeiro and Misch visited the river in 1661, maize, manioc, fowl, honey, fish, and dried meat are listed as the foods given in trade. Maize was used in their religious ceremonies. Heriarte suggests that the Tapajo used less manioc than maize.27 HANDICRAFTS The archaeology of the Lower Tapajos gives evi- dence that its native tribes were not only excellent potters but skilful workers in stone. Heriarte remarks that the Indians of both the Tapajos and the Trombetas 24 Daniel, 1841: 168 ff. 22 Heriarte, 1874: 36 ff. 26Daniel, 1841: 3: 168. 27 Heriarte, 1874: 38. made fine pottery which they carried into other areas for trade.28 He also repeats the legend of the bur- aquitas or "green stones" (a form of amulet) which were supposed to have been formed under water from the green clay of the river bed which hardened when brought to the surface; he says these, also, were in great demand. He reports too, though rather skepti- cally, that it was "commonly said" that the Tapajo made long, round beads, drinking cups, seats, birds, frogs, and other shapes, working under water.29 The large number of implements in Tapajo collec- tions, also pendants and small figurines, testify to the skill of these Indians as craftsmen in lithic materials. Texeira, returning from his first visit to the Tapajos in 1626, brought back "fine mats and other novelties." 30 Samuel Fritz, who visited the mouth of the Tapajos in 1691, reported that the Indians wove small, flat baskets from palm leaves dyed in several colors.31 The Tapajo slept in hammocks,32 placed their dead in them,33 and used them in trade.34 Teixeira stated that these hammocks were made of "palmito worked in different colors." 35 The archaeology suggests that the Tapaj o wove constrictive bands for their arms and legs,36 and also head bands,37 and contrived ornaments for their ears.38 WEAPONS The Tapajo used poisoned arrows, but we do not know which poison they employed, neither did the Europeans know any antidote for it.39 Daniel gives a considerable and interesting account of the poisons used by the Amazonian Indians in the middle of the eighteenth century, more than a hundred years after the Tapajo had been deprived of their deadly weap- ons; 40 it seems doubtful, however, from his descrip- tions, that any of these is the one the Tapajo used. Nimuendajui points out that if the blood ran from a Tapajo arrow wound, the victim was irremediably lost, and that Gaspar de Soria, of Orellana's party, died of an arrow wound in twenty-four hours. He states that these are not the symptoms of curare poisoning. He infers from Betendorf (1910: 173, 342) that the Tapajo also poisoned food. According to Teixeira the Tapajo kept the skulls of their enemies as trophies.4' 28 Ibid., 39. 29 Ibid., 37. 3o Berredo, 1905: 1: 226. 31 Edmundson, tr. and ed., 1922: 71. 32 Betendorf, 1910: 172. 33 Heriarte, 1874: 36 ff. 34 Markham, tr. and ed., 1859: 125. 35 Nimuendajui, 1949: 102. 36 Pls. 54, 65-a and c. 37 Pls. 58-a and b; 59-a; 63-a and b. 38 Pls. 49-e, 50, 54-a, 63-a, 64-f, 67-b. 39 Heriarte, 1874: 35. 40 Daniel, 1841: 3: 459 fif. 41 Nimuendajufi, 1949: 102.

With regard to the modern weapons of the area, Nimuendaju' says: The fishing arrows of the present day "civilized" de- scendants of the Tapajo are distinguished by radial feather- ings, well made and handsome. The feathers are short and trimmed; the binding of cotton thread on the side of the arrow butt gives the impression of being an ornament. The bow is flat on the side toward the string and promi- nently convex on the other side.42 ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES TERRAS PRETAS During the preparation of my first published report on the Tapajo.1 I had the advantage of considerable correspondence with Mr. Curt Nimuendajufi. To help me to understand the complicated geographical and archaeological problems of this area, he drew for me two maps 2-one on his excavations in the Lago Grande de Vila Franca area and another, of great im- portance, which covered his archaeological work on both banks of the Amazon in areas where traces of Tapajo trade or influence might logically be expected. He explained that these maps might not be absolutely accurate in every detail as he did not have all his notes at hand when he drew them, and therefore had been forced to fall back upon his memory in certain instances. His more important maps were sent to Gothenburg along with copious notes, and in the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, in Belem, there is a large and beautiful map recording his Amazonian field work. However, the maps included here are of great help in illustrat- ing general tribal distribution as recorded by the archaeology. In one of his letters, Mr. Nimuendajui made the following important statement: I always speak of "Tapajo pottery," but basically it is no more accurate than to say "Santarem pottery." The Tapajo were the principal producers of this type of ceram- ics but not the only one; while Santarem was the principal place where the Tapajo-style was made, however there were others also, though these were of less importance.3 Some of the Tapajo material found far afield in all probability represents trade pieces. However, there is the possibility that groups of the Tapajo may have migrated from the ancestral area and established them- selves elsewhere continuing, meanwhile, their native cultural pattern. Another consideration is that the pottery from Santarem and vicinity is by no means all Tapajo, though in the Aldeia (the Indian-mission section) the thickest terra preta produces only the Tapajo style.4 42Rowe, tr. and ed., 1952: 9. 1Tapajo Pottery, 1939, Gothenburg. 2 These maps (3 and 4) were redrawn for publication by Mr. A. E. Parkinson of the University Museum staff. 3 Nimuendajui, letter, November 24, 1937. 4 Idem, letter, 1 de Outubro, 1939. One of the wares least related to that of the Tapajo found in the Santarem area comes from the Paur/a-zone of the north bank of the Amazon (59"50' w. L.)5 This material was not described. Mr. Nimuendajufi stated also that the ceramic style from the Arapiuns, a river which enters the Tapajos northwest of Santarem, is entirely different from that of the Tapajo. Unfortunately he gave no descriptive details.6 He found another dissimilar style in the section of Santarem known as Montenegro, where a dairy was located. This site had been badly washed out by the high water of the Tapajos. The style of the pottery from this site was similar to that of the "Arauaki-Zone" of the Lago de Silves area of the Rio Urubu, a northern tributary of the Amazon west of the Tapajos. The contents of the Montenegro site were all of the same ware and extended to the surface of the terra preta. Mr. Nimuendajui believed that this culture was not older than that of the Tapajo.7 In his published report 8 Nimuendajfi summarizes his archaeological work on the Lower Tapajos as follows: In 1870-1871, Prof. C. F. Hartt studied the geology of the Tapajos River. Both he and his companion, H. H. Smith, who returned to the Tapajos in 1874, recognized the "black earths" on the rim of the plateau south of Santarem as ancient Indian setlements. It is very curious that neither the one nor the other found out about the biggest concentration of black earth in the whole region, that of the Santarem-Aldeia; for Smith expressly says: "A few antiquities have been found near Santarem, but there is no black land there, and no evidence of an exten- sive village" (Smith, 1879, p. 170). From Hartt's time dates the "Rhome Collection" now in the National Museum. This material is not sufficient for an accurate study of the Tapaj6 culture. Between 1923 and 1926 I located 65 ancient Indian set- tlements in Santarem, south of the city, in the region of Alter do Chao and Samahuma, on the Arapixuna, on the south shore of the Lago Grande de Vila Franca, and on the right bank of the Amazon, between the mouth of the lake and that of the Arapixuna, all belonging to the Tapaj6 culture. Nevertheless, I believe that this number does not represent even half of the sites of this culture to be found in this region. With the exception of the fishing places on the north shore of Lago Grande and on the Island of Tapereba, still covered with flood waters when I visited them, all these ancient settlements are found on high ground, safe from inundation, and the majority of them are even on hilltops or on the plateau. There are no black earth deposits or other traces of Indian occupation in the strip a league wide which extends between the bank of the Amazon and the foot of the bluff, south of Santarem. It is an arid region, sandy and cov- ered with brush. However, as soon as one reaches the plateau the black earth deposits begin along the rim. I checked this observation in five different places. On the south shore of Lago Grande there is scarcely a spur of hills which extends to the edge of the lake that 5 Idem, letter, 17 de Outubro, 1935. 6 Idem, letter, 15 de Outubro, 1937. 7 Idem, letter, 1 de Outubro, 1939. 8 Rowe, tr. and ed., 1952: 9 ff. 18</page><page sequence="20">0 I- 0 0 ?T?e STES OF 'SINGLE PIECEs Of rsilia Le0l A , &lt;OHr1 POTTERYC C ary POTTARYA APLIEN TO BOTH TAN V A ANTSD KOFDU .

Parkinson. does not have a deposit of black earth on it. There are many other deposits, which I did not visit for lack of time, on the shores of the deep bays which are a feature of the lake. The black earth deposits of the plateau are found far from any running water. The Indians repaired this defect by digging wells which, with few improvements, furnish water to this day to the Neo-Brazilian population. At the well of Maraja, located at the bottom of a hollow at the foot of the deposit of black earth, the ancient cylindrical excavation of the Indians can be clearly seen. It is two meters in diameter and about equally deep. Above it can be seen the square excavation of the present inhabitants. At the black earth deposit of Aquzal, the Indians, in dig- ging their well, struck the top of a sloping bed of extremely hard white clay, which they were probably unable to pene- trate with the tools available to them. They, therefore, dug to one side, following the down slope of the hard bed, until they secured the necessary depth. I saw five of these Indian wells myself, but their number is much greater. Another characteristic of the black earth deposits of the plateau is the ancient Indian roads which run almost in a straight line from one black earth deposit to another. They are from a meter to a meter and a half in width and about 30 cm. deep. Great and venerable trees now grow in the middle of them; nevertheless, they are still so notice- able that they strike the investigator's attention. Some- times they branch part way along the route, and near the black earth deposits they disappear. The surface of the black earth deposits is usually not flat, but composed of a number of mounds, each several meters in diameter, and each probably representing a house site. I know of only two black earth deposits which begin immediately at the high water mark on the river bank: the one at Alter do Chao and that of Santarem-Aldeia. This latter is incomparably the most important of the sites and it has yielded more archaeological material than all the rest put together. In some places it is almost a meter and a half thick. On it is built a good part of the modern city of Santarem, especially the district called Aldeia. that is, the Rua da Alegria and the streets which cross it. Especially in these cross streets, which drop off steeply on the side toward the Tapajos, the torrents of run-off water frequently open deep gulleys in which remains of old pot- tery are found throughout. Considering that, for more than two hundred years, pedestrians, animals, and vehicles have crushed the surface daily, it is remarkable that objects 20</page><page sequence="22">ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES are still found in such good condition. The richest site on the plateau is the black earth deposits of Lavras, where potsherds are so abundant that they interfere with the farming. The great majority of the sherds, however, are plain pieces, and the decorated ones, as everywhere else, occur in much smaller quantities. The black earth de- posits of Lago Grande are very shallow and hence yield scarcely anything but minute fragments rarely worth col- lecting. Archaeological remains are also remarkably scarce at Alter do Chao, an ancient Tapaj6 center. There appears to be a fairly rich site, however, at Aramanahy, a little above Samahuma. With his site map of Lago Grande de Vila Franca, Mr. Nimuendaju sent the following statement: . . The south shore of the lake consists of a hilly country. The north shore is low and flooded by the Amazon. It is quite possible that in the inlets along the south shore there may be old village sites.. . . Also, there may be fishing village sites along the lakes and canals of the flooded area. The fishing stations of Lago Grande lie upon a sambaqui where an olive-colored jade muiraquitd in the form of a frog was found.9 Concerning his further archaeological exploration, Mr. Nimuendajui wrote me as follows: My collections in Gothenburg contain material from the area extending from the mouth of the Rio Negro to below Monte Alegre. Besides the shores of the Amazon and the parands, I examined a great many sites in the Autaz district, on the Rio Madeira, to the Mataura, usually indi- cated on the maps as the Furo de Tupinambarana. Also I examined sites along the Tapajos to above Itaituba, along the Arapiuns and the Lower Curua. On the north bank of the Amazon, I made excavations on the Lower Urubu, the Lower Uatuma, in the delta of the Trombetas (not in the district of Alenquer), and some sites in the vicinity of Monte Alegre. In addition, I made scattered excavations around the Rio Negro, the Uaup6s, the Igana, the Lower Xingu and its tributary, the Iriri. There is a great deal of rich material on the islands in the mouth of the Amazon, in Brazilian Guiana, and on the Lower Tocantins. Con- cerning all of this I wrote a detailed account and made road maps.10 Thus, much important material on the archaeology of the Lower Amazon is, at this writing, still un- published. On the map which indicates the extent of Mr. Nimuendaju's excavations, his symbol for Tapaj6 material includes also specimens of Arapiuns and Monte Alegre wares, suggesting trade or close tribal as- sociation. I do not know which of the many non- Tapaj6 styles these may be. It is significant that pottery foreign to both that of the Tapajo and the Konduri was found in conjunction with burial urns-evidence of an entirely different cultural pattern. South of the Amazon, these urns appeared at Altamira on the Xingui, Brasil Legal on the Tapajos, and Conceicao on the Parana do Ramos. A few scattered Tapaj6 sites appear north of the Amazon west of Monte Alegre, but Mr. Nimuendaju 9 Nimuendajui, letter, Oktober 12, 1935. 0 Idem, letter, 15 de Outubro, 1937. wrote me that he had made no general exploratory studies in the vast area between Monte Alegre and Obidos.1l Thus, to date, the northern limits of the Tapajo culture are undetermined. Recently, however, Dr. Peter Paul Hilbert has published his report on his extensive archaeological work in the Konduri area along the Trombetas and from Oriximina west to the Nhamunda.l2 In one of his last letters, Mr. Nimuendaji mentioned having examined some old sites at Porto de Moz and Tapara on the Lower Xingui and having found evidence there of Tapajo influence on wares that were generally quite different from Tapaj6 in design.l3 It is evident from Nimuendaju's maps, the historical records, and the great quantity of archaeological ma- terial that has been recovered from Santarem and vicinity that, in the pre-European era, this region was a thickly populated one. The old records state that several tribes lived near the mouth of the Tapajos, and Nimuendaju has noted that other tribes besides the Tapajo produced the ceramics that we now designate by that tribal name. However, in large Tapajo collections, there is always material that is definitely non-Tapajo, and other ma- terial which, stylistically, seems to be a combination of the Tapaj6 with another decorative tradition, often Konduri. This suggests close tribal association or even a certain amount of integration. Sherds typically Konduri in design are also common in Tapaj6 collections. As the general site map indicates, the Konduri lived mostly along the Trombetas, a northern tributary of the Amazon, and west of the Tapaj6s on the south bank. Heriarte stated that their social customs were the same as those of the Tapajo,14 and Nimuendajui believed that their disposal of the dead was the same as that of the Tapajo since he had never found any burial urns in Konduri sites.15 Their pottery will be discussed under "Non-Tapajo Wares." Barata recounts a conversation he had with Curt Nimuendaju concerning the latter's first efforts at archaeological exploration in the vicinity of Santarem. In substance it is as follows: A friend of Nimuendajf's, a German priest in Santarem ... had frequently noticed children playing with fragments of Indian pottery which they had found in the town and which they called caretas (masks). He described the pottery as very unusual in design and different from any then known. As soon as possible Nimuendaju went to Santarem to investigate the situation and realized at once the importance of this ceramic material. ... . . He located a site in the Aldeia which was full of frag- ments, and commenced excavating.

SOC. day he found a Portuguese resident of the vicinity actively digging at the same spot, having completely ruined all of Nimuendaju's previous work. When queried as to his reasons for such action, he replied, "I am looking for treasure; if you are able to find it, I also should be able to do so." The hole he had dug was enormous and the pottery within it beyond redemption. Nimuendajf then remarked that this incident illustrated how difficult it was to preserve the archaeological riches of Brazil because the man of the interior lacked understanding of the problem and either feared the Indian relics and destroyed them, or he despised them.16 Barata supplies further information concerning the archaeological problems which the Santarem area presents. His principal points may be summarized as follows :17 a. Ferreira Penna, visiting the town in 1854, found it divided into two distinct parts: the city, which was close to the wall of the old fort, and the Aldeia, which ex- tended toward the west, and which was inhabited exclusively by the descendants of the Indians. b. By 1869, the Aldeia had begun to be invaded by "the city," and houses were being constructed quite superior to the huts which previously had constituted the dwellings of the area. c. The Indians who lived in the Aldeia were no longer the Tapajo-the last representative of that tribe had been exterminated by the allied Portuguese and Mundurucui, and so few escaped the massacre of 1835- 1836 that by 1852, when Bates visited the area, there was not an old or middle-aged man in the place. d. Today, Santarem extends all over the Aldeia, but its present habitants, even the old ones, have no knowledge of the ancient Indians. However, a con- stant reminder of their one-time presence is the caretas and parts of vessels which turn up in the terras pretas of their streets and quintais (backyards). e. Very rewarding sites in Santarem have been the quintais on Rua Galdino Veloz, on Rua 24 de Outubro, and on Av. Rui Barbosa. This material was found in what the Brazilians of the area call bolsoes (big pockets). These are small excavations which, in general, have an area not exceeding 2.5 to 4 square meters and a depth of from 30 to 80 cm. f. The bolsoes were the creations of the newcomers to the Aldeia area who found the ground covered with vessels and pottery fragments abandoned in other years by the Indians. Partly to clean up their living site but also, without doubt, because of a superstition that this pottery was concerned with a cult of the dead, they dug these small pits and swept the pottery into them, then covered it up with earth. The content of these bolsoes consists of Tapaj6 pottery, old pottery which is not Tapaj6, modern pottery, porcelain, and beer bottles. g. Stratigraphical studies in the vicinity of Santarem are useless. Outside the Aldeia, the terras pretas have 16Barata, 1950 (1): 18 ff. 17Idem, 1953: 3 ff. been ploughed up as especially suitable for agriculture. Nimuendaju suggested that rewarding areas for strati- graphical examination might be those where the popu- lation is not concentrated and where the terras pretas are covered with old trees, as on the planalto. The material in American museums designated as having come from "Lago Grande" presents something of a problem. In Lower Amazonia "Lago Grande" is usually accepted as an abbreviation of Lago Grande de Vila Franca (see Site Maps). This is a large lake. The only information at the Museum of the American Indian concerning their material from Lago Grande is that it was found thirty miles west of Santarem.'8 This would seem to refer to the Lago Grande de Vila Franca area. However, the material at the University Museum is recorded as having come from Lago Grande do Cumaruara, eighty miles northwest of Santarem. Mr. Nimuendajfu wrote me that he did not know this site. Recently I made inquiry at the Mapoteca, Rio de Janeiro, concerning this matter. Their reply stated that they had no record of a lake or village by that name.19 Thus it would seem that the spelling on the records at the University Museum is incorrect. Referring to the disturbed state of archaeological sites in the valleys of the Trombetas and the Nhamunda, northern tributaries of the Amazon, and areas which, in the pre-European era, apparently were culturally related to that of the Tapaj6s, Hilbert suggests certain causes for the present disordered and fragmentary con- dition of the ancient pottery within them. In his opinion, part of the destruction has been due to the superstitious fear of the settlers who established them- selves on the ancient terras pretas after the early Indian occupants had vanished and who apparently wished to obliterate, as far as possible, all evidence of this earlier culture, so different from their own. Then, too, an important factor has been the primitive agricultural procedure of the area with its burning and hoeing techniques, and its harvesting of the tuberous, long- rooted manioc which, when roughly removed from its bed, breaks the pottery and leaves great cavities in the earth, disturbing the stratification. Hilbert refers also to the fact that there is record that the early missionaries to Amazonia destroyed artifacts which they considered detrimental to the Christianization of their charges. In addition, in this area (north of the Amazon) is the possibility that pottery, in some instances, was destroyed ceremonially.20 Thus, in this section of Amazonia, both north and south of the river, little of the pottery that is removed from ancient sites is unbroken or entirely restorable. Considering the archaeological richness of the area, interest in the Tapaj6s sites developed slowly. Perhaps the oldest Tapajo collection is that which belonged to R. J. Rhome, previously referred to in the 18 Burnett, letter, March 31, 1956. 19Jovita, letter, October 10, 1956. 20Hilbert, 1955: 17. 24</page><page sequence="26">ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES VOL. 50, PT. 3, 1960] Nimuendajui report. Mr. Rhome was an American who lived at Taperhina, some thirty miles below San- tarem along the Amazon. His collection is now in the Museu Nacional, Rio de Janeiro. The Rhome collection interested C. F. Hartt who took time out from his geological investigation in 1870 to do a little digging. He mentions the vast expanses of rich, spongy black soil on both sides of the Tapajos as far south as Itaituba, and states that at Itaituba, Diamantina, Panema, Pa-Pixurra, as well as at Taper- hina, the terras pretas were full of pottery. Guided by A. R. Wallace, he went up to Pa-Pixurra where he dug two sites, finding pottery sherds, idols and stone tools. He also dug a sambaqui at Taperhina.21 He excavated what was apparently a Mundurucu burial area south of Itaituba.2 J. B. Steere, of the University of Michigan, some time between 1870 and 1873, visited Taperhina and dug a terra preta and a sambaqui in the vicinity.23 Joao Barbosa Rodrigues explored the Tapajos in 1872. He was primarily a naturalist but he was deeply interested in the antiquities of the Valley. He did a little digging during the course of his exploration and later wrote several short reports on the archaeology and the folklore of the Tapajos area. W. C. Farabee spent the years 1913 to 1916 in Amazonia. He traveled most of the length of the Tapajos which he considered the most beautiful of the Amazon's tributaries.24 He brought back to the Uni- versity Museum a few sherds, but he never displayed the archaeological interest in this area which he did in that of Marajo Island where he made extensive excavations. The first serious effort to explore the Lower Tapajos archaeologically was that of Curt Nimuendajui between 1923 and 1926. Much of the material that he re- covered is now in the Ethnographical Museum of Gothenburg. Some, also, is in the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi in Belem. As stated by Mr. Nimuendajui in his letter of October 15, 1937, previously quoted, the collection he sent to Gothenburg was accompanied by maps and detailed notes on his excavations. This record has not yet been published. Thus, at present, we have no informa- tion concerning the size of the various archaeological sites he uncovered on both banks of the Amazon or of the probable age of the pottery which they contained. The late Dr. Carlos Estevao de Oliveira was greatly interested in the archaeology of the Tapajos and had a small, but excellent, collection of pottery from that area. This is now in the Museu do Estado, Recife. His valuable assortment of muiraquitas, some from the Tapaj6s, some from other Brazilian areas is still, at this writing, in the possession of his family. 21 Hartt, 1885: 10 ff. 22Ibid., 14 ff. 23 Steere, 1927: 23 ff. 24Farabee, 1917: 126 ff. Rose and Robert C. Brown lived in Santarem inter- mittently between 1941 and 1945, and during their sojourns "garnered' from expeditions some 10,000 archaeological specimens, many of them very fine. A few of the most interesting pieces were obtained from an old Indian woman who lived in the Aldeia section of the town.25 Unfortunately, this collection has be- come widely scattered, although a substantial number of important pieces are at present housed in the Fundacao Brasil Central, Rio de Janeiro. For the past several years there has been a genuine interest in the archaeology of the Tapajos, and amateur enthusiasts have done considerable field work, often restoring very satisfactorily the remains they have recovered. As a result of such effort, Dr. Frederico Barata of Belem, Mr. Charles H. T. Townsend, Jr., of Belterra, and Sr. and Snra. Carlos Liebold of San- tarem have collections of unusual interest. We have no record of their work except the names of the sites where they found their material. There is an excellent collection from various sections of the Tapajos Valley in the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi in Belem. Smaller but important collections may be seen in the Museu Nacional, Rio de Janeiro, and the Museu Paulista, Sao Paulo. In the United States there are large collections at the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, New York, and at the University Museum, Philadelphia. With the exception of the Nimuendajiu Collection in Gothenburg and the Liebold Collection in Santarem, much of the Tapajo material in both museum and private collections consists of pieces which have been passed along from individual to individual, frequently having been originally obtained from an Indian or caboclo who had chanced upon them in the course of his agricultural pursuits. Thus, there are no field records concerning them and sometimes the area of their origin is uncertain. The large collection at the University Museum was gathered together by a priest and no field records came with it, merely the name of the general area of origin of the individual pieces, Lago Grande or Santarem. There is great need for scientific field work in the Tapajos Valley. SAMBA QUIS Sambaqui or sambaque, according to Frei Gaspar da Madre de Deus (1797), was a word used by the Tupi to designate a monturo of shell-that is, a pile of waste shells-thus suggesting the artificial origin of these mounds. Leonardas uses the term in this sense and states that sambaquis may be found along the entire Brazilian coast 26 and in some localities in Lower Amazonia.27 25 Brown, letter, April 6, 1956. 26Leonardas, 1938: 1. 27Ibid., 33. 25</page><page sequence="27">PALMATARY: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE LOWER TAPAJOS [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. Hartt, Steere, Agassiz, Smith, and other scientists displayed interest in the sambaqui at Taperhina, thirty miles east of Santarem, on the engenho owned jointly by the Baron of Santarem and Mr. Rhome, an Ameri- can. This sugar-mill estate was situated on the south- ern bank of the Amazon on the parana-mirim Aiaia, and was examined by Charles Frederick Hartt of the Museu Nacional of Rio de Janeiro in 1870 and, again, in 1871.28 Hartt's report of his work on this sambaqui is, in part, as follows:29 ... I found that this deposit consisted of an enormous heap of unknown thickness of river shells covering an area of many thousand square meters. It was situated at the foot of a steep declivity formed of tertiary rocks which constitute the southern limit of the valley, and distant about 200 meters from Aiaia. The deposit remained some meters above the level attained by the waters during the annual flood .... Since all the deposit was covered with a cap, more or less thick, of soil carried by the water from the neighboring hills, it was not possible for me to determine its area or its thickness. I found the shells so regularly deposited, so frequently united and closed and with so little admixture of extraneous material that, not having encountered any trace of pottery, carbonized wood, or other remains indicating human activ- ity, I rather lightly arrived at the conclusion that the deposit had been formed naturally. The opinion appeared to me more reasonable because I had seen near Aveiros great heaps of shells of the same species cast on the beaches by the waters of the Tapajoz.... On my expedition of 1871, I went again to Santarem . and encountered Mr. J. B. Steere of the University of Michigan who, interested by Mr. Rhome, had examined the deposit and had had the good fortune to find fragments of pottery and some bones, resolving the problem as to whether or not the sambaqui had been formed by the hand of man. ... I visited Taperhina again and examined the sambaqui with care. ... I excavated a depth of six meters, examining sufficient shells to fill several carts, taken from the vertical face of the excavation. Above the shells, I found half a meter of earth in which there were fragments of pottery for the most part the same as that of the terra preta of the planalto . . . mixed with modern pottery. The shells belong to the well-known species of Hyria, Castilia and Unio, which abound in the waters of the Amazon and its tributaries. From the top to a depth of six meters, I found very small fragments of coarse red pot- tery, but the entire amount recovered in the excavation would hardly fill a hat. Bones were extremely rare, and all I obtained were hardly more than a handful. Mr. Steere found the rib of a peixe-boi, and I collected fragments of human bones, part of the skeleton of a small fish, and some decomposed scales which seemed to be those of a jacare. The rarity of bones and the apparent absence of the ver- tebrae of the pirarucu surprised me considerably. Here and there I found a piece of carbonized wood but without definite strata of ashes, and even fewer firestones. There were no implements whatsoever in the deposits. The pottery is made of clay containing considerable coarse grit and without caripe (tree bark) and having a surface relatively smooth. The fragments indicate that 28 Ibid., 43. 29 Hartt, 1885: 1 ff. the vessels were, for the most part, a sort of cup with rounded bottom. The rim is very simple, beveled on the inside and somewhat rounded on the exterior. They are neither painted nor polished, and most are completely devoid of decoration. That these animals whose shells form the sambaqui were employed as food is beyond doubt . . . although today where they abound in the Lower Amazon, never, as far as I know, are they eaten. ... The enormous quantity of shells and the rarity of bones leads me to conclude that the people who made the sambaqui fed themselves exclusively on mollusks, at least part of the year. It appears very strange that being ac- customed to stone implements, none should be found, and that knowing how to hunt and fish, bones of vertebrates should not be found in abundance in the sambaqui. More- over, had this people known the use of mandioca, it is incredible that they should have been so poorly nourished. The fact that they knew how to make coarse pottery, shows that they had taken a major step toward civilization. ... Hartt believes that the present remoteness of the sambaqui from a possible supply of the fluvial mollusks referred to is due to a raising of the land in that area. THE ARCHAEOLOGY POTTERY MARAJO AND TAPAJO CERAMICS COMPARED To one who has studied both Marajo and Tapaj6 ceramics, the contrast between the art of these two Lower Amazon cultures is striking. To be sure, Marajo is probably much the older of the two and, with the exception of a few forms and techniques, there is little evidence of traditional relation between them. Yet each is superior in its own ceramic structural and decorative field. Basically, the Tapajo excelled in modelling, the Marajo Indians in surface decoration-painted, en- graved, champ-leve. Sometimes a superficial examina- tion of Tapajo sherds, even a large number of them, gives the impression that these wares were unpainted, only an occasional piece displaying a definite painted area. Fortunately, however, a few fine figurines and a larger number of vessels of moderate size have retained a considerable amount of paint, so that we are familiar with certain characteristics of Tapajo design. By contrast, the paint on Marajo vessels and sherds-not the cruder wares but those representing the more ad- vanced stages of Marajo artistic development-is usu- ally better, and at times we find a piece covered with two or three layers of paint of different colors, the engraving revealing the successive colors. The Tapajo paint may have lacked the adhesive quality of that of Marajo, or it may have been less skilfully applied, or the firing technique with regard to painted pieces may have differed from that of Marajo. Both areas are subject to heavy seasonal rainfall, so are equally dis- advantageous from the standpoint of preservation. In Maraj6 art there is little which approximates naturalistic reproduction; the genius of these islanders 26</page><page sequence="28">THE ARCHAEOLOGY was for complicated geometrical designs in several techniques. Their anthropomorphic and zoomorphic subjects were always stylized. In contrast, the Tapajo reveled in the natural world about them and reproduced its living forms realistically, using them in profusion for the decoration of certain vessels or reproducing them as individuals in figurine form or as containers of various sorts. We can learn little about the Marajo civilization from its art. This people (or peoples) buried their dead in urns-sometimes there was cremation before burial. Ceremonial pottery was placed around the urns. The women wore ceramic tangas, some of which were elaborately decorated, others were entirely plain, sug- gesting a possible difference in social status for the wearers. The jacare (crocodile) was regarded with great respect; it was possibly a totem animal. The beautiful bird life of Maraj6 was ignored artistically as were also the many other forms of animal life on the island. What the inner life of this people may have been is buried underneath the skill and formal beauty of their surface designs; it does not readily reveal itself today. Had there been no missionaries or Portuguese military to leave records of historical and ethnological value concerning the Tapaj6, we still could have learned much about this people from the archaeology of the area where they lived. The Tapajo seemed to have had a sense of humor and they liked to poke fun at the jacare. They loved the beautiful birds and the little wild dogs of their valley; they admired and feared the onca (jaguar); they were probably superstitious about the frog; they were on intimate terms with the monkey. They sensed the close relationship between man and other members of the animal kingdom and expressed it in certain dualistic figures. We know their hair styles, their tattoo designs, their ear ornaments, their leg and arm decorations. They recorded the deformities of their people, their diseases, and also their cruelties. They were a numerous people who traded actively with their neighbors. They smoked tobacco in pipes during at least the latter part of their tribal existence. There were no burials in the Tapaj6 area, so no great urns are found there. Very few vessels of more than moderate size have been recovered although, from the records, it seems there must have been uses for many. There are few sherds of large vessels in collections. It is interesting that the Amazon Valley, which the white man for more than three centuries has been struggling to conquer physically and to make habitable and healthful according to his standards, and where artistically and economically he has (until recently) prospered so little, should have been, in pre-Columbian times, the part of Brazil that was most creative, most substantial. We have a fair amount of information about the Marajo Islanders and the Indians of the Rio Tapaj6s, but records in clay and stone of other important peoples are gradually coming to light, ex- panding our view of civilization in ancient Amazonia. We have also the records of early travelers concerning tribes which they saw but which are as yet undiscovered archaeologically. Thus, to its native peoples, the Amazon Valley seems to have provided the inspiration and urge for great artistic expression and, in addition, the physical satisfactions and well-being which made such expression possible. CLAY AND TEMPERING MATERIALS The ancient Amazonian potters were well supplied with the basic materials with which to develop their craft. The fine clay known as tabatinga with which they surfaced their vessels is generously distributed over a vast area of the Valley extending from Para, in the east, to the Peruvian border, and constitutes the great marl bed on the Upper River known as Tabatinga. In the vicinity of Santarem, this clay appears in the lower part of the Mahica woods;2 also it forms the upper stratum of the great flat-topped hill known as Alter do Chao, a few miles south of Santarem, and is reported as constituting bluffs for five or six miles below Aveiros, much further up the Tapajos,3 and there are other references to "white clay" without specifying that it is tabatinga. Two tempering materials have been reported from the Tapajos area: the burnt bark of a tree known as caripe (Moquilea utilis) (Hooker, Fil), which contains a high percentage of silica, and a freshwater sponge called cauixi rich in siliceous spicules.4 With regard to the use of bark as an aplastic, Linne states: The area of distribution is coextensive with the Amazon basin, Rio Orinoco, and Guiana. Of the ceramics of this area, as far as can be judged from the finds that have so far been made, only to those of the Lower Amazon is ascribable great antiquity. . . . The clay in the banks of the Amazon River cannot be used in pottery making with- out siliceous substances being added to it. ... The bark mixture represents, in any case, a progressive step techni- cally, and resulted in products that are of considerable superiority to those made with potsherd admixture, and this fact is noticeable when one compares, as in G6teborg Museum, ceramics from Brazilian Guiana with the hard ceramics of Santarem, which give a ringing note when tapped.. . . 5 Marajo ceramics are, of course, much older than those of the Tapajo area, although how much older is a matter of debate. On Pacoval Island, in Maraj6's Lago Arari, Mordini found bark-tempered pottery only in the upper of two strata which had a negative zone of 48 cm. between them,6 while Nimuendajfu found 1 Tobatinga or tabatinga was the name applied by the Tupi to all clay which was pure and white. Sampaio, 1901: 57. 2 Bates, 1892: 198 ff. 3 Hartt, 1874: 34. 4 Idem, 1885: 71 ff. 5 Linne, 1925: 42 ff. 6 Mordini, 1934: 15 ff. 27 VOL. 50, PT. 3, 1960]</page><page sequence="29">PALMATARY: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE LOWER TAPAJOS [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. sherds containing siliceous material of vegetable origin on the top of the mound. In 1926 and 1928, when Mordini was excavating on Maraj6, the native people were using potsherds as tempering material; there was, however, a tradition among them that formerly "certain plants" were employed in the manufacture of pottery.7 Le Cointe lists two species of Amazonia sponges used as aplastics: Tubella reticulata and Parmula batesii.8 Linne, referring to information he received from Curt Nimuendaju, states that freshwater sponges grow in abundance along the so-called "black-water" tribu- taries of the Amazon and that frequently they attain the size of the human head. In the lingua geral their name is caa-ziichy (Uixy-Saecoglottis sp.) Nimuendajfu also referred to the terrible itching and subsequent injuries to the hands which resulted from working with clay which had been mixed with their spicules.9 Contrary to the custom of some present-day potters who calcine and pulverize these sponges before adding them to the clay, Linne states that microphotographs show that the Tapajo added the spicules intact. Con- cerning this ancient method he remarks: . . . disintegrated spicules cannot be of the same strongly reinforcing effect as intact ones. Apart from the ordinary effect of substances admixed, it is notable that these sponge spicules are bound to greatly strengthen the texture in pottery, a circumstance readily observable from the hard and durable ceramics of Santarem, by reason of their being evenly distributed in the mass which they intersperse in all directions, thereby forming, so to speak, a concrete reinforc- ing element. Quite naturally, therefore, the sponge adjunct is something more than a substitute for sand, and is also a step in advance of ash or burnt, siliceous tree-bark, thus forming the height of Indian clay-mixing technique.10 Linne further states that the use of sponges as a tempering agent was confined to an area much more limited than was that of bark, and that it was probably the later invention of the two. Of these two aplastics, the sponge was the better, although the more difficult to use. With regard to the origin of these inventions he remarks: . . .On ne saurait dire avec certitude ou a eu lieu la de- couverte de ces deux surrogats du sable, et si l'une a ete faite independamment de l'autre. Sur le cours inferieur de l'Amazone, les deux methodes etaient en usage a une epoque ancienne.... . . . . . . . . . . Cette decouverte a ete faite probablement, par les Ara- wak sur le cours infdrieur de I'Amazone, et la s'est re- pandue dans les autres regions: le bassin de l'Amazone et de ses affluents et la Guyane.11 7 Linne, 1932: 218 ff.; Palmatary, 1950: 287 ff. 8 Le Cointe, 1945: 178. 9 Linne, 1932: 205 ff. 10Idem, 1925: 51 ff. 11 Idemt, 1932: 222. PROVISION FOR FEATHER DECORATION OR SUSPENSION In explanation of the numerous small perforations in the upper sections of Tapajo idols and vessels, Barata expresses the following opinion: Father Ives d'Evreux, referring to the small idols in human form among the Tupinamba and describing the cus- toms of their witch doctors whom he calls feiticeiros, says that they decorated their idols with feathers. I am convinced that the Tapaj6 did the same with their ceremonial pottery and with mystical intent, ornamenting with feathers, perhaps on festive occasions, not only the idols but certain vessels as well. When examining Tapaj6 vessels and sherds, always my attention has been attracted to certain small holes placed more or less regularly in certain positions which, at first, seemed to have no justification. In spite of the fact that so many Tapaj6 idols and vessels have flat bases which give them perfect stability when placed on the ground or some other smooth surface, I think it probable that in some cases holes were made for suspension; delicate objects not suitable for placement on the soil or in general sur- roundings, where they would risk destruction by animals, might have been suspended in the huts for better protection. However, there are holes which could not have served this purpose, such as those which are symmetrically ar- ranged around the necks of vessels and which are, at times, as many as six-too many to hold cords of fibers of sus- pension. Similarly, those in the auricle of the ear seem not to have had this purpose, as also those in other posi- tions in various zoomorphic and anthropomorphic orna- ments appended to pieces which do not have the strength, when suspended, to sustain the weight of the whole. The explanation most plausible is that these were in- tended for the introduction of feather ornaments as Nimu- endajf states is customary among the Palikour.12 STYLISTIC ANALYSIS OUTLINE OF CLASSIFICATION When definitely known, the site is indicated following each description.

Decorated with a red geometric design on a gray background. The neck is a common form in Tapaj6 ceramics. (Santarem.) 3. P1. 7-a. A small undecorated jar of light yellow clay. Its neck is short, its diameter at the mouth and at its attachment to the shoulder is approximately the same; however, it broadens sharply at half its height, thus forming a definite angle in profile. At first glance this piece does not impress one as Tapaj6, but the fact that the neck is inserted in a depression above the shoulder, and also that the greatest diameter of the neck is at middle height suggests Tapaj6 influence. (Belterra.) 4. P1. 7-b. A small jar of light yellow clay darkened by fire. The rim is flat on top and decorated by two parallel engraved lines. Apparently not Tapajo. (Belterra.) 5. P1. 7-g. A small, unpainted jar of grayish white clay having a flaring neck. Its shoulder is decorated by a band consisting of a series of four engraved lines angularly opposed. Above the main design is a band in relief decorated with punctates, and another below the design decorated with incisions. Apparently not Tapajo. (Belterra.) B. Jars Having Anthropomorphic Characteristics 1. PI. 10-a, b. A jar with a face on the neck, and arms, breasts, navel and sex indication on the body. A band in relief decorated with short incisions divides the body at its greatest diameter; the arms are similarly decorated as are also a band encircling the neck of the jar above the face, and another short one below the face. The hair is represented by a long engraved roll down the back. On either side of the upper half of the body is a series of lizard-like figures in relief. The eye is of the Tapajo type, but the general style of the vessel is more Konduri than Tapajo. Traces of red paint. (Lago Grande.) C. Superimposed Forms Having Anthropomorphic Characteristics 1. P1. 13-b. This vessel illustrates the scalloped profile character- istic of superimposed forms. It is strikingly Tapajoan in general design, although the eye is a mere pierced button. The tongue protrudes as it frequently does on Amazonian jars. As usual, the ear contains an ornament. The painted design is indistinct, but seems to have consisted of two broad perpendicular stripes on either side, extending from the breasts to the ornamental band surrounding the vessel at its greatest diameter; the space between appears to have been decorated with concentric rectangles made up of narrow black lines. There are dark perpendicular stripes on the neck of the vessel above the head. Some red decoration would have been normal to this type of design, but it is not apparent at present. Closely related in general style to pl. 17-a. (Santarem, Aldeia.) D. Bowls a. Globular Bowls Having an Out-Turned Rim 1. P1. 8-a. A beautiful but unusual piece. It is decorated with three bat heads in relief, and between these heads are outspread wings. The bottom is missing, thus the classification is not absolute, although the lines of the lower body suggest that the bottom was rounded. No paint at present. (Santarem, Aldeia.) 30</page><page sequence="32">THE ARCHAEOLOGY b. Globular Bowls Having a Short Neck 1. P1. 5-c. Unusual because the design is entirely geometrical. The body is divided into ten sections by divisional units each composed of three vertical bands in relief. In the middle of each section is a knob, deeply indented. An indented ridge surrounds the bowl at the base of the neck. The neck is decorated with groups of engraved lines angularly opposed. The rim is indented. Light gray paste with traces of black paint. (Santarem, Aldeia.) 2. P1. 7-e. One of those interesting pieces which seem to be a combination of both Tapajo and Konduri traditions. The form is distinctly Tapaj6, the little face is also characteristically Tapajo, but the decorative technique is that of the Konduri. The Tapajo used the pit as a decorative device but always as a minor element in their ornamentation-such as scattered pits on the lower section of caryatid dishes, while on the Konduri wares, as far as we know them, pits are a major factor in the decoration. The Tapajo eye is normally a round-rimmed protuberant form without a central pit; the Konduri eye is fre- quently pitted. This bowl is decorated by a series of faces suggested by pitted semi-circular bands in relief depicting brows with eye forms below. Two little decorated pro- tuberances serve for a nose, others for two-lobed ears. No matter how the bowl is turned, a face is portrayed -for an ear can substitute for a nose, and two noses for ears. If the bowl is turned upside down, the de- sign still suggests a series of faces. This device of arranging a design so that it forms a face either right side up or upside down and of interchanging features is more characteristic of Marajo than of Tapajo wares. Probably a stylized frog design. Traces of black paint. (Av. Rui Barbosa, Santarem.) 3. P1. 7-d. The decoration on the body consists of stylized frog heads facing each other; between the heads is a simple geometrical design in low relief, behind them are stylized limbs, also in low relief. The neck is orna- mented by groups of vertical engraved lines, while the ledge at its base is decorated by a series of deep in- cisions and punctates. Traces of red paint. (Santarem, Aldeia.) 4. P1. 8-e. The decoration consists of a series of zoomorphic motifs around the shoulder of the vessel. This design is believed by Barata to be of coruja or screech-owl inspiration.13 Unpainted. (Santarem, Aldeia.) 13Barata, 1953: 200. c. Globular Vessels Having an Inset Neck The inset neck is a marked characteristic of Tapajo pottery design. It usually consists of a collar-like sec- tion decorated by engraving at the base of which is a notched ledge; this surmounts an undecorated section which is attached to the body of the vessel below the shoulder. 1. P1. 9-a. A bowl decorated by batrachian designs in relief. (Santarem.) 2. P1. 9-c. Portion of a bowl the body of which is decorated by two rows of a notched scroll design in relief. Unusual. (Santarem.) d. Lobed Bowls 1. P1. 8-b. A bowl of nine lobes with a face and two nodules representing feet on each. Probably a frog design. Between the lobes and extending above the shoulder are bird heads in relief, but the attached bodies are elongated suggesting reptilian forms. Scroll designs above the frog faces serve as brows. The neck is slightly inset and decorated with deeply engraved vertical and horizontal lines and a pitted band at its base. Unpainted. (Santarem, Aldeia.) 2. P1. 8-c. A bowl of seven lobes with a frog design on each and a geometrical divisional unit in relief between the lobes. The shoulder is decorated with a wavy design in relief. The neck is inset; the collar is decorated by an engraved geometrical design and a pitted ledge at its lower edge. Unpainted. (Santarem, Aldeia.) 3. P1. 8-d. A bowl of five lobes with a frog design in relief on each, and a divisional unit in relief between the lobes. Unusual in that the lobe formation, although in a modified form, extends into the neck. Unpainted. (Santarem.) e. Four-lobed Vessels Having a Small Mouth 1. P1. 45-b. An ornate piece decorated with a number of faces in relief. Traces of paint. (Tauajury.) f. Bowls in Zoomorphic Form 1. P1. 13-a. A small bowl in the form of a fish. Unpainted. (Santarem.) 2. P1. 18-a. A piece which illustrates the Tapaj6 sense of humor, a trait which is frequently apparent in their design. The vessel represents a jacare (crocodile) holding its snout aloft for a small bird to peck at, while a man 31 VOL. 50, PT. 3, 1960]</page><page sequence="33">PALMATARY: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE LOWER TAPAJOS [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. rides at ease on its tail. There is a hole in the tail, probably for feather decoration. No paint. (Santarem, Aldeia.) Type II. Vessels Having a Flat Bottom A. Bowls a. Wide-mouthed Bowls Having a Short Neck 1. PI. 3-a. An unusual piece of light brown clay. The body is decorated with strips of clay arranged vertically and rather irregularly incised with short gashes. An ef- fective technique. Not characteristic of this area but similar, if not identical, body decoration appears on a bowl from Venezuela figured by Requena, and actual reproduction of this decoration, also from Venezuela, is recorded by Kidder II.14 The neck and rim are un- decorated. Probably not Tapajo. (Santarem, Aldeia.) b. Wide-mouthed Bowls Having an In-turned Rim 1. P1. 4-a. A large bowl having an in-turned rim which is deco- rated with parallel engraved lines and pits. Four frog designs in low relief are equally spaced just below the rim. Traces of red paint. (Santarem.) B. Deep Dishes 1. P1. 5-a, b. An unusual piece in that the bottom surface is covered with an engraved design. Two concentric lines parallel the outer edge; the enclosed circular area is then divided into quarters by engraved straight lines crossing at right angles. These quarters are decorated with engraved wavy lines and circles. In three of the quarters there is a hole which pierces diagonally the outer ledge around the base. These holes were prob- ably intended for feather decoration and, no doubt, one originally appeared in the broken quarter also. The rim is hollow and scalloped along its outer edge; al- though three quarters of it are in good condition, it shows no sign of having been pierced. Unpainted. (Santarem, Aldeia.) C. Concentric Dishes 1. PI. 11-a. This dish and b on the same plate illustrate the close cultural relation-as far as ceramic style is concerned- between the Konduri and the Tapajo. Fundamentally, these dishes consist of a shallow bowl placed within another of greater diameter, the two being connected by four spanning handles. The difference between the two is in the decoration. This piece is typically Tapajoan. The bird heads have the round-rimmed protuberant eye characteristic of Tapaj6 design; the broad handles are decorated with a stylized frog motif which appears frequently on Tapajo pottery. Judging from the number of these 14 Requena, 1932: 85; Kidder II, 1944: pls. VII-11, VIII-29. handles which one sees in sherd collections, the con- centric dish must have been a rather common form among the Tapajo. The only decoration inside the dish consists of broad lines of black paint applied in a somewhat triangular design on the inner surface of the outside dish. The inner bowl is a little lower than the outer one. (Santarem.) 2. P1. 11-b. This piece differs from the preceding principally in that all the spanning handles are bird heads and that the doughnut eye is the principal decorative motif for both the handle ornamentation and that of the rim. The bird heads have a deep hole in the back of each, probably for feather ornamentation. Between the bird heads are groups of eye forms arranged in a fanlike order and tied together with an indented ribbon of clay which passes under the bird's head from one to the other. The inner and outer dishes are of the same height. Traces of red paint. For indications of Kon- duri influence, compare the decoration on this piece with that on pieces directly from the Rio Trombetas, pls. 87-a, 89. (Santarem.) 3. P1. 12-b. Fragment of a large concentric dish. The inside of the bowl had been painted red. Two of the spanning handles are bands decorated with frog designs; the other handle seems to have been a masculine figure, man or monkey, the head of which is missing. This body supports two winglike appendages each of which terminates in two feet. The wings are engraved on the back with diagonal lines. 4. P1. 12-c. A very unusual piece. The inside of the outer dish is decorated with a scroll design, and along its edge with groups of engraved lines diagonally opposed. Two of the spanning handles are decorated with scrolls, while the other two consist of what appears to be a body having both a bird and a human head. The actual handle emerges from the back of the figure and extends to the outer rim. The dish was painted red all over after it was engraved. Typically Tapajoan. (Santarem, Aldeia.) D. Superimposed Forms 1. PI. 13-d. This piece is broken at the base so the classification is not absolute. In general form this little jar suggests the superimposed type found commonly in both Maraj6 and Tapajo wares usually producing a scalloped pro- file. This form could be analyzed as a jar with a bulging neck resting in a larger vessel with a wide mouth. Decorated with two anthropomorphic heads in handle position; between these on either side are small strips of indented clay. Had been painted red. (Santarem.) 32</page><page sequence="34">THE ARCHAEOLOGY E. Crescent-based Vessels 1. P1. 62-f. A small pot in the form of a crescent-based figurine. The rim is missing, the face is represented on the neck. The arms are free-modeled as on most figurines in the crescent-based category. Yellow-brown clay showing traces of white paint. (Belterra.) Type III. Vessels Having a Conical Lower Section A. Large Bowls 1. P1. 4-b. An unusual form having a gently sloping conical base, vertical sides and an out-turned rim. Light yellow clay; traces of red paint. (Santarem.) Type IV. Vessels Having a Truncated Conoidal Lower Section A. Large Jars 1. P1. 3-b. Large vessels are scarce in Tapajo collections, so we do not know what may have been the usual forms in this category. This is the only one of such form in the collections studied. In general design it suggests the superimposed type common in both Marajo and Tapajo pottery. The line from the base to the shoulder is curved slightly inward; above the bulging shoulder the body slopes inward and upward to a neck form very characteristic of Tapajo wares. Shows traces of black, red, and buff paint. (Santarem.) B. Wide-mouthed Bowls 1. P1. 5-e. A large bowl the inside of which had been painted red. On the outside, the truncated conoidal section had been red, while the vertical section above it had been decorated with a black and red geometrical design on a white background. (Santarem.) Type V. Vessels Having a Ring Base A. Cylindrical Vessels 1. PI. 40-a. An unusual piece though distinctly Tapajoan. The body is made of dark paste and is decorated with con- centric rectangles in an incised design. Two pierced zoomorphic heads rest on the shoulder in handle position. The neck has been broken but was probably of the type illustrated on pls. 33, 34. Traces of black paint. (Santarem.) Type VI. Vessels Having a Flaring Ring Base A. Wide-mouthed Bowls 1. P1. 14-b. A vessel with an everted rim the decoration of which consists of a scalloped liplike protrusion on one side. Two small indented knobs apparently were the decora- tion at two other points, dividing the rim into thirds. Traces of red paint on the inside of the bowl. (Lago Grande.) 2. P1. 15-a, b. A design based upon fish motifs and consisting fundamentally of fish crossed at right angles forming a rather quadrangular mouth. On the upper surface of the rim there are three tails and one head, all per- forated with fin motifs in between; on the lower surface there are two heads and two tails. The base is a modification of the flaring-ring form, the lower section consisting of a series of rings of almost the same diam- eter but narrowing toward the bottom. Unpainted. (Santarem.) 3. P1. 23-b. Somewhat problematical, as the rim is missing. The face in relief seems almost anthropomorphic but the limbs are not. On either side of the head is an extended snake motif in relief. Above this is an incised ledge surrounding the body and another similar one below it. A projection on one side suggests a foot motif; the one on the opposite side is missing. The whole suggests a little figure swimming. Unpainted. (Santarem.) B. Deep Bowls Having an Engraved Collar The engraved collar with a pitted and extended lower edge must have been common in Tapajo design, judging from the number of collar-sherds in collections. 1. Pl. 11-c. A vessel with stylized cutia 15 heads in handle position. The front paws are upraised, the hind feet are in- dicated below them. A strip of clay, indented and engraved, extends between the animal representations. Divisional units of vertical engraved lines divide the collar into sections, each of which is decorated with a broken sigmoid scroll. Unpainted. (Santarem.) 2. P1. 17-b. Decoration on the neck consists of a series of rec- tangles created by short linear divisional units; each rectangle is cut diagonally into four triangles in which are small circles, probably reed impressions. The ledge at the base of the neck is decorated with short incisions. Engraved diagonal lines ornament the top of the shoulder. On the body are four identical zoomorphic designs, seemingly of coruja (screech owl)'1 inspiration, and between the sections are lizard forms in high relief serving as handles. Vertical bands of opposed engraved diagonal lines extend for the length of the handles and on either side of them. Unpainted. In excellent condition. 15 Dasyprocta aguti, Lin., Freire, n. d.: 18: 1683. 6 Barata, 1953(1) : 200.

Two parallel engraved lines surround the collar at top and bottom. The intervening space is divided into sections by groups of vertical en- graved lines; these sections are decorated by opposing scrolls, the free ends meeting to form a V; the back- ground is pitted. The shoulder is decorated with zoomorphic forms in relief-an avian form with out- spread wings and a beak extending to the lower edge of the wings. It has been suggested that these figures were intended to represent the tuituiu.17 Between the tuituius are upturned bird heads, and attached to each is a small body and a tail, while stylized wings to which bird feet are attached extend from either side of the body. A few traces of black paint. C. Bowls Having a Hollow Cylinder Surrounding the Shoulder 1. P1. 16-c. The only complete piece of this form in the collections studied, although a few sherds suggested that these may have belonged to similar vessels. The collar is definitely in the Tapajo tradition, although the decora- tion is in relief rather than in the usual engraved technique; the decorative motif on it is the interrupted sigmoid. The encircling cylinder is so incorporated into the body of the vessel that its presence would scarcely be suspected were the vessel in perfect condi- tion. This cylinder probably served as a device for holding pebbles and is perforated, possibly for feather decoration, upturned bird heads rest upon it in handle position. Of dark red clay and unpainted. (Santarem.) D. Superimposed Forms Superimposed forms suggesting that the design might have been based upon a vessel resting upon one or more other vessels are characteristic of both Tapajo and Maraj6 wares. The profile of such vessels usually creates a scalloped effect. a. Geometrical Forms 1. P1. 16-b. The rim of this vessel is inturned and decorated with groups of engraved vertical and horizontal parallel lines arranged alternately. The body has two sections deco- rated by scrolls in relief, one of which is an interrupted sigmoid. Traces of red paint. (Santarem.) 2. P1. 22-e. The rim is smooth and everted. The body consists of two sections, the lower slightly larger than the upper. Three bird heads with long beaks serve as handles and extend from the upper to the lower sections. Two vertical parallel bands in relief, lightly engraved, divide the spaces between the heads, while horizontal bands in relief with small knobs at their extremities extend on either side of the heads on both the upper and 17 Tantalus americanus, Freire, n. d., 53: 5069. lower sections. A hole in the top of each head sug- gests provision for feather decoration. Unpainted. (Santarem, Aldeia.) b. Zoomorphic Forms 1. P1. 24-a. Suggests a four-lobed onca (jaguar) jar with a bulbous neck resting upon a wide-mouthed bowl. The onca is characteristically depicted with an open mouth surrounded by a series of pointed projections, probably representing teeth. The tongue is indicated. The head and tail are on opposite lobes of the upper section of the vessel and the limbs are represented in relief be- tween them. The painted decoration of the vessel is in relatively good condition depicting the onfa pintada 18 in the customary manner- a brown background divided by black lines into small rectangles in the middle of each of which is a black spot. (Santarem.) 2. PI. 26-b. The design suggests a globular onca jar with a bulbous neck resting in a wide-mouthed bowl. The colored decoration is in fairly good condition. The background is cream color, divided into rectangles by black lines with a black spot in the center of each rectangle. The neck is red and there are red stripes around the base and also around the middle of the body. The piece may have been intended to illustrate some Indian legend or it may merely display a bit of dis- torted humor-one human form is supported by the onca's paws directly under its open jaws and protrud- ing tongue, while another little human creature rests complacently on its tail. (Santarem, Aldeia.) c. Anthropomorphic Forms 1. P1. 17-a. Definitely scalloped in profile. The face is on the neck, the eye is round-rimmed protuberant with a central pit. Arms are suggested by lizard-like forms in high relief serving as handles. The background is a deep cream above a ridge surrounding the greatest diameter of the jar; over this is diagonal line decora- tion in black and red. The lower section of the vessel and the base are painted red. One of the finest of the Tapajo pieces, it has a dainty quality that an illustration can hardly convey. Except for its base, it is similar in general design to pl. 13-b. E. Shallow Vessels 1. PI. 19-a, b. This vessel, though apparently Tapajo in its crafts- manship, is strikingly unusual because of the simplicity and beauty of its painted geometrical design, and be- cause modeling is such a minor element in its decora- tion. The background seems to have been white, the large triangle on the bottom of the inside surface is black, the other linear decoration on the inside is 18 Felis onza, Ihering, R., 1934: 43. 34</page><page sequence="36">THE ARCHAEOLOGY black and red. One notable motif is the cross which appears on the inside of the rim design. Two bat heads rest on the rim in handle position. The outside seems to have been painted white, and three black stripes extend from the back of the bat heads to the base. A very handsome piece. (Santarem, Aldeia.) 2. PI. 20-a, b. An interesting design based upon groups of three and four motifs. The rim is divided into thirds by three bat heads in relief between which are pairs of zoomor- phic figures which appear to be chasing each other. The interior surface is divided into four areas by concentric circles in relief, the second of which is lightly engraved. The innermost circle forms the circumference of the central motif, the other two, the upper and lower borders of the main design. The central circular area is divided into quarters by lightly engraved strips in relief. There is a small pit at the point of crossing. The main design is divided into quarters by divisional units consisting of three parallel vertical strips in relief; only the middle one is engraved. A snake design in relief fills each of the four sections of the decorative band. Traces of black paint. (Santarem.) 3. PI. 20-c. Decorated around the edge with geometric motifs in relief and the small zoomorphic figures customarily used on this type of vessel. Stylized snake and frog motifs in relief decorate the divisions of the broad band which surrounds the interior of the dish. There is a wavy-line design in relief between this and the outer edge. Unpainted and rather rough of surface. (San- tarem, Aldeia.) 4. P1. 21-a, c. A series of small zoomorphic figures in relief decorate the outer edge. The decorative band around the interior is made up of scroll motifs in relief with small zoomorphic heads in relief between the scroll units. Traces of red and black paint. 5. P1. 21-b. An unusual piece of fine workmanship. The center of the interior surface is decorated with an engraved five-pointed star having parallel engraved lines emanat- ing from between the points, possibly suggesting bril- liance. In the middle of the star are two concentric circles, probably a sun or moon motif. The missionary, Daniel, reported that the Arapiuns on the Tapajos worshipped the stars, the sun, and the moon.19 The broad decorative band between the star and the rim is divided into two parts by groups of three vertical strips in relief. In each of the two sections thus created, the motif resembles a long snake, the body of which is indicated by a series of scrolls in relief; there is a small head on one end, a curled tail on the other. Unpainted. (Santarem.) 19 Daniel, 1916: 2: 494. 6. P1. 21-d. The rim is decorated by stylized zoomorphic figures in relief. The broad band on the inner surface is di- vided into halves by groups of vertical lines in relief; each half is decorated by two serpentine designs in relief. Unpainted. (Santarem, Aldeia.) 7. P1. 21-e. The rim is decorated with bat heads and with a series of small animals in the intervening spaces. The broad band below the rim on the interior is decorated by scrolls in relief and small stylized heads. Painted a reddish brown. (Santarem.) F. Globular Jars Having a Bulbous Neck a. Geometrical Forms 1. P1. 14-a. Almost perfect in craftsmanship. The shoulder curves downward at its juncture with the neck, thus setting the neck in a slight depression. Inset necks are a Tapaj6 characteristic. The body has been decorated with alternate horizontal red and white stripes. The neck and base seem to have been red. (Santarem.) b. Vessels Having Anthropomorphic Characteristics 1. PI. 13-c. A jar similar in form to the preceding one but having anthropomorphic attributes. On one side only there is a face with bulging cheeks, while handles in the form of arms extend from the shoulders to the head. There are four fingers on the hands. The body decora- tion is concentric rectangles in black and red on a white background. The base is red. Painted decora- tion indicates sex, apparently female. The eyes are elongated indentations in what appear to be thin strips of clay. In mouth position there is a round-rimmed protuberant eye form, suggesting an open mouth with a slightly protruding tongue. One of the finest of the Tapajo pieces. (Santarem.) c. Vessels Having Zoomorphic Characteristics 1. P1. 7-f. The base is entirely gone. The neck is red and decorated with an engraved geometrical design. The background of the body is tan. There is a zoomorphic head on one side of the body and a tail on the opposite side, possibly representing a squirrel; on alternate sides is a stylized frog design. These animal rep- resentations are in low relief and painted red. Between the animal motifs are pairs of red stripes. (Santarem, Aldeia.) 2. P1. 22-c, d. The general background is tan; the neck is red and there is a red band around the lower ledge, also a red curvilinear design over the shoulders and a red band down two sides of the vessel. A squirrel head in relief with upraised paws and small protuberances suggesting VOL. 50, PT. 3, 1960] 35</page><page sequence="37">PALMATARY: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE LOWER TAPAJOS [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. feet decorate one side, while a tail in relief is indicated on the opposite side. All zoomorphic decoration is red. (Santarem, Aldeia.) d. Vessels Having Zoomorphic Decoration 1. P1. 49-d. An unusual piece of fine workmanship. The decora- tion surrounding the shoulder of the vessel suggests the skeleton of a monkey. The head and crossed upper limbs and the bent knees appear in the illustration. From the head a vertebra-like decoration, terminating in a tail, surrounds two-thirds of the vessel. The neck and the zoomorphic relief decoration are in red; the remainder of the vessel, in its present state, is un- painted. (Santarem, Aldeia.) G. Anthropomorphic Forms Having a Bulbous Neck 1. PI. 41-b, d. Only irregularly globular. This piece is important because no similar one appeared in the collections studied. It represents a seated female figure supported on a flaring ring base. The painted decoration is still in good condition, and consists of red and black con- centric geometrical figures on a light gray background. The head serves as the neck of the vessel. The ear lobe is distended and without ornament as it is frequently represented on Tapajo anthropomorphic figures. The eye is a little flattened button slit horizontally and sur- rounded by a series of "rays" which Barata thinks may be a sun motif; 20 at least it suggests that light is re- vealed through the instrument of the eye. A clearer example of this motif may be seen pl. 60-a. The hair is represented by long braided forms down the back. (Santarem.) 2. P1. 48-a. Depicts a supine female figure enjoying a nap; her arms are resting over her head, her knees are raised, her legs are crossed. Her only support, however, is at mid-length of her back, while the neck of the vessel, decorated by a human face, develops from the abdominal area. The design is hardly suggestive of ease, although the craftsmanship is excellent. The background of the vessel is white, the body is decorated with linear motifs in black and red; the base has a black stripe at top and at bottom, with a red scroll design between the two. (Santarem.) H. Globular Vessels Having an Angular Neck Frequently the Tapaj6 neck forms an angle, more or less acute, at about one-fourth its height. 1. P1. 24-b. This vessel has a squirrel-like head in relief on two opposite sides in handle position; the fore limbs and feet are also indicated. A tail in relief and engraved decoration fill each of the two intervening spaces. There 20 Barata, 1953: 193, figs. 69, 72. is an engraved curvilinear and short-incision decora- tion on the neck. The general background is tan colored, the neck and the zoomorphic decoration are painted red, and there is a red stripe around the outer edge of the base. (Santarem, Aldeia.) 2. P1. 42-a. Almost a lobed vessel, since at the shoulder there are four modified angles; below this, however, the body expands into a fairly globular form. There are two squirrel-like heads in handle position with stylized fore- limbs surrounding them; between them on either side are indented vertical strips. Below the heads is an engraved semicircular design. The background of the vessel is painted light brown; the engraved neck, the animal motifs, some of the engraved decoration and the lower section of the base from the upper band in relief to the bottom are red. (Santarem.) I. Onca Jars The onca pintada or jaguarete (Felis onza) is a large animal-85 cm. in height, 1.2 meters in length without the tail which measures 60 cm. It is a hand- some animal: its color is yellow, its body dotted over with black "rosettes" in the center of which is a spot of deeper black. Its tail is striped with black. It can climb trees, swim rivers, jump high and for a long distance. It is intelligent and a great hunter.21 The Tapajo knew it well and depicted it frequently, always with its mouth open and often with a victim in its claws or jaws. Sherd collections contain large num- bers of onca heads and onca tails, suggesting that this general type of vessel must have been rather common. 1. PI. 23-e. An oval jar of yellow unpainted clay. The eye is round-rimmed protuberant. There is a hole in the side of the tail. The onca holds its victim in its mouth. One of the simpler forms. (Santarem.) 2. PI. 24-c. The only double onca jar in the collections studied. It consists of a globular body with two heads, two tails but only one set of limbs. The eyes are round-rimmed protuberant; there are holes in the ears and in the back of tails, probably for feather decoration. The entire vessel is painted a reddish brown. (Santarem.) 3. P1. 25-a. A large jar with a straight neck. The body is painted white and divided into rectangles by straight black lines; in the rectangles are black spots. The neck and base are red, there is a band of red on the shoulder at the base of the neck, and another surrounding the body below its greatest diameter. The eye is round- rimmed protuberant and the mouth is characteristically open and edged with a series of pointed protuberances suggesting teeth. Excellent craftsmanship.

The neck, slightly constricted at central height, is a type found more or less frequently on Tapaj6 vessels. This piece shows the conventionally depicted onca head and tail in high relief, limbs in low relief. The entire vessel is painted red on the outside; the inside of the neck is painted white with red decoration. (Santarem.) 5. P1. 27-e. A globular vessel with a small flaring ring base. The head and tail are in high relief, the limbs are in low relief. The eye is round-rimmed protuberant; there is a hole in the top of the head and another underneath the tail at the point where it curls. The background is brown and is divided into rectangles by narrow black lines; black spots fill the centers of the rectangles. (Santarem.) 6. P1. 23-f. Although incomplete and therefore problematical in its present form, the design follows closely the usual type of onfa jar. A broad black band surrounds the vessel at its greatest diameter; above and below this band is a red one of approximately the same width. The white surface of the jar, above and below this central divisional unit, is divided into rectangles by black lines, the vertical ones in groups of three, the horizontal ones in pairs. There is a black spot in the center of each rectangle. The eye is round-rimmed protuberant, the mouth open, the tail curled. (San- tarem, Aldeia.) J. Vessels Having Multiple Mouths 1. P1. 23-d. A vessel with five openings-a conventional central neck and mouth, and also four cylindrical projections, three having a finished mouth; the fourth supposedly was similarly formed but its extremity is missing. Traces of red and brown paint. This is the only piece of such form in the collections studied. (Santarem.) K. Lobed Vessels a. Vessels Having a Bulbous Neck 1. P1. 22-f. A little jar with fourteen lobes, probably intended to represent one of the Brazilian nuts. Two stylized bird heads rest on the shoulder in handle position. Of light yellow clay. Unpainted. (Belterra.) 2. P1. 23-a. A slightly lobed vessel. The neck is painted red with one engraved line encircling it at the rim. There is a red stripe around the outer edge of the base. The shoulder is decorated with a zoomorphic head in relief and, on the opposite side, a tail in relief. Winglike projections, probably representing feet, decorate the lobes on either side of the tail. A similar form ex- tends from the lobe on one side of the head; the one on the other side is missing. The background of the vessel is tan, the zoomorphic decoration is in red. (Santarem, Aldeia.) b. Lobed Vessels Having an Angular Neck 1. P1. 22-a, b. Essentially a four-lobed jar, but one lobe is indented; a monkey face with round-rimmed protuberant eyes and two-lobed ears appears on the depressed surface. Brows in relief are depicted above the face on either side of the indentation. The ribbon handle is on the lobe opposite the indented one and its central motif suggests a tail. The neck and the handle are engraved and painted red. All four limbs are depicted in low, engraved relief. The face, brows, ears, hands and limbs are painted red, and the base apparently had been red. The background of the body is tan. This general type of vessel appears, from complete pieces and sherds, to have been fairly common among the Tapajo. (Santarem.) c. Lobed Vessels Having a Short Neck 1. PI. 18-b. Apparently had had six lobes, two of which are missing. There is a zoomorphic head in high relief on one lobe and, on the opposite larger one, two pairs of feet. On the lobe adjoining the head there is a large scroll in relief. Three of the remaining lobes are decorated with frog motifs. Parallel engraved lines surround the collar, the lower edge of which is deco- rated with short incisions. Unpainted. (Santarem, Aldeia.) 2. PI. 18-c.

In fact, the form of this vessel was similar to that on pl. 48-a. The low flaring-ring sup- port (at the right) was under the middle of the back of the animal, while the half-circle (more to the left of the same section) was an opening in the abdomen for the attachment of the neck of the vessel. Light brown background, red decoration on eyes, spinal column, tail, and support. Good craftsmanship, defi- nitely Tapajo. This piece and the other in anthro- pomorphic form apparently represent a definite vessel- form tradition, stylistically well balanced but not very acceptable artistically. (Santarem.) M. Bottles a. Globular Forms Having Necks Bulbous at the Base 1. P1. 28-b. The decoration is characteristic of this form of neck. This decoration consists of a series of semi- human features which form a face no matter which way the vessel is turned, two ears serving as either ears or noses, an eye from two different faces forming a pair. This decorative device appears frequently also on Maraj6 pottery. Two bird heads, pierced on the sides and with curving beaks, constitute the handles. A frog motif in low relief fills the space between the handles, while a snake-like motif, also in low relief, extends over the shoulder and curves up on the sides. The base is undecorated except for a band in relief above the lower edge. Unpainted. (Santarem, Aldeia.) b. Zoomorphic Forms, Having Necks Constricted at the Base 1. P1. 28-a. A fine piece depicting a turtle. The upper surface of the body is decorated by a broad band of engraved lines angularly opposed, above this two parallel en- graved lines, below it a pitted band in relief. The border decoration is similar to that of the broad band above. The underneath surface is plain. There is a turtle head and two feet in relief on one side, and a tail and two feet in relief on the opposite side. The neck is typical of one class of Tapajo bottles, consisting of a narrow mouth then widening gently downward for three-quarters of its length, then narrowing to become incorporated into a broad decorative ledge just above its base. The upper section of the neck is decorated with connected out-turning scrolls having short vertical lines between them-almost suggesting a face. The opposed scroll unit, including the small pit beneath its lowest point, also suggests a face. The device of using the same elements for more than one face is a Marajo as well as a Tapajo characteristic. (Av. Rui Barbosa, Santarem.) 2. P1. 29-b. Another turtle effigy vessel. I did not see this piece; the illustration is based upon a photograph of a painting by Sr. Manoel de Oliveira Pastana. c. Anthropomorphic Forms Having Necks Bulbous at the Base 1. P1. 31-a. Seemingly an unflattering representation of a squat- ting human figure wearing ear ornaments. The hair is depicted in long braids down the back of the figure. In this case the head may be considered the bulbous section of the neck. The ledge above the head is perforated, probably for feather decoration. Vestiges of red paint. (Santarem, Aldeia.) d. Zoomorphic Forms Having Necks Bulbous at the Base 1. P1. 44-b. The bulbous section is represented by the body of a crouching onga. The animal is characteristically depicted with round-rimmed protuberant eye and round mouth with projecting teeth. He is devouring what seems to be a jaboti (land turtle) tail first, the body of the bottle representing that of the turtle. Barata refers to the numerous legends in which these two animals are associated.23 Moraes states that the onga masters the terrible jacare (crocodile) by the same method.24 (Santarem, Aldeia.) e. Lobed Bottles Having Necks Constricted at the Base 1. P1. 30-a. A four-lobed vessel with what seems to be a monkey head with upraised hands on one lobe and a tail decorated with engraving on the opposite lobe. The two intervening lobes and also the one supporting the tail are decorated by a series of concentric engraved rings. The eyes are round-rimmed protuberant; the ears contain ornaments. The ledge on the neck of the vessel is perforated. Traces of red paint. (Santarem, Aldeia.) 2. P1. 30-b. A four-lobed vessel with a zoomorphic head on one lobe and a curled-up tail on the opposite lobe. The limbs are represented by thin engraved bands in relief with a foot-like projection on the end of each; these bands extend from the shoulder downward between the lobes. The eyes are round-rimmed protuberant. An engraved band in relief around the neck and another design in engraved relief over the head and brows add to the decorative effect. The ledge above the body is perforated. The upper section of the vessel's neck is ornamented with an engraved curvi- linear and punctate design. Traces of black paint. (Santarem, Aldeia.) 3.

The side lobes are decorated with human figures in relief. The eye is round-rimmed protuberant; the ears have ornaments. An engraved scroll design sur- rounds the upper section of the neck of the vessel, while scrolls in relief ornament the bulbous section of the neck and the base. The neck-ledge has four perforations. Unpainted. (Santarem, Aldeia.) N. Winged Bottles Few forms are more characteristic of Tapajo ceramics than winged bottles. Basically, these vessels consist of a long tapering neck, engraved near the mouth and decorated by one or more flanges; the neck finally expands into a globular form before it becomes merged with the body of the vessel. Occasionally the body is globular, but more often it is slightly lobed or distinctly so. The flaring- ring base is rarely plain; usually it is decorated, some- times with a scroll design but often with faces, or frog or bird motifs. The wings consist either of highly stylized crocodile heads or less exaggerated avian forms. A wide range of Amazonian fauna frolics on these wings-little dogs with curled-up tails, the same type one still sees playing in the streets or lying in the doorways in Santarem; also monkeys, birds, reptiles, rodents, half- human forms and other figures hardly classifiable. Almost always frogs appear on the shoulders of these vessels, often carrying tadpoles on their backs. Rep- tilian designs in low relief also frequently decorate the bodies. Glanced at superficially, these vessels give the impres- sion of being strikingly similar; actually, however, no two are alike. There is an element of humor in their decoration and the same spirit of gaiety and vivacity which characterizes much of Tapajo design typifies these forms as well. In all probability these vessels were painted orig- inally; today, however, only rarely traces of red or black coloring appear on their surfaces. Apparently, the wings were modeled separately and then attached to the body. Dr. Barata has a piece on which the roughened surface at the point of attachment is still discernible. What use was made of these bottles is a matter for conjecture; it would seem, however, that their func- tion must have been ceremonial. This type of vessel appears to have been common for, in addition to several complete or almost complete pieces in collections, sherds which seem to have belonged to them are numerous. a. Winged Bottles Having Globular Bodies 1. P1. 29-a. The collar and the base are decorated with incised scrolls; the little dogs are in their usual position on the jacare's snout; the familiar frog and tadpole rest upon the shoulder of the vessel. An unusual feature is that the tip-end of the jacare's jaw is folded under and upon itself, and terminates in a sort of bird head. The jacare's eyes are represented by perforations, probably for feather decoration. No paint at present. 2. P1. 32-c. One of the simpler pieces. The neck is missing, the base is plain. (Santarem.) 3. P1. 33-b. The neck has but one flange; the space above the flange is decorated with two sigmoid scrolls between which are divisional units consisting of three vertical engraved lines. The bulbous part of the neck is decorated with snake designs in low relief with eye- like motifs between them. Very realistic little dogs and bird heads decorate the crocodile heads. The base is ornamented with a series of opposing scrolls. No paint at present. (Santarem.) 4. P1. 36-a. Practically globular but the body is divided into four sections by perpendicular engraved lines. The wings are in the form of large bird heads. The neck above the flange is decorated with a curvilinear design. Frogs in high relief on the shoulder. Faces in relief on the base. Traces of red paint. (Santarem.) 5. P1. 36-b.

SOC. of the neck is ornamented with face designs, the elements of which produce a face no matter which way the vessel is turned. The crocodile heads are differently ornamented, one with what seems to be a stylized dog, the other with an equally stylized monkey. Frogs rest on the shoulders. A series of faces decorates the base. No paint at present. (Santarem, Aldeia.) 2. P1. 33-a. A six-lobed piece. The upper section of the neck is decorated with an engraved design based upon con- centric rectangles. There is a single flange. On the bulbous section of the neck there is a face in relief characterized by the typical Tapajo round-rimmed pro- tuberant eye. This face with the flange above it suggests an individual wearing a stove-pipe hat. There is an engraved linear design at the lower extremity of the face, and the lobes of the body extend somewhat into the face. One wing supports a dog and a bird, the other wing is broken. The usual frog ornament is present. The base is decorated with faces having the usual interchangeable features. Traces of dark paint. This piece is important as it gives some indication of the technique of construction employed by the Tapaj6. The outer tabatinga or fine clay coating is missing and the rough basic form is displayed. The general technique employed on similar pieces is illus- trated on pl. 26-c. (Av. Rui Barbosa, Santarem.) 3. P1. 33-c. A piece with two flanges on the neck. The section above the flange is decorated with a series of engraved concentric rectangles. The bulbous section below the flanges is ornamented with frog and tadpole motifs. The body has six slightly lobed sections with the usual frog decoration. The crocodile heads are beautifully engraved along the edge with a scroll design. These wings support some interesting figures-on the broken one are two monkeys one pulling the tail of the other; on the other crocodile head are two monkeys, one chewing a bone; at the tip is a figure partly human, partly birdlike. The base is decorated with frog motifs. (Av. Rui Barbosa, Santarem.) 4. P1. 34-a,b. Two views of the same vessel. These figures illus- trate what may be said not only of winged bottles but of Tapaj6 vessels in general: that no matter from what angle one views them, they are satisfying and well balanced in both form and decoration. This is no mean accomplishment in wares which are so ornate and which present so many problems in their construction. This piece is actually six-lobed, but viewed from above it appears almost four-sided with rounded corners. A sort of engraved quadrangular scroll, possibly based upon the markings on the back of the turtle, decorate the upper section of the neck; below this are two flanges. On the bulbous section there is a snake design, but the tails suggest eyes, and other protuberances a mouth and a nose. Little dogs with curled-up tails rest upon the jacare (crocodile) heads. The usual frog forms appear upon the shoulders. There is a zoomor- phic design in relief on the base. The jacare eyes are pierced, possibly for feather decoration. (Av. Rui Barbosa, Santarem.) 5. P1. 34-c, e. A six-lobed piece. The upper section of the neck is decorated by the modified quadrangular scroll so fre- quently employed around the mouth of these bottles, but it differs from most in that it is heavily pitted. There is a single flange. The bulbous section is decorated by a series of small snakes in relief which appear to be chas- ing each other, but between them on two sides is a frog form in relief. Reptilian forms decorate the body and there is the customary frog on the shoulder. Two face designs with round-rimmed protuberant eyes appear on the base. The wings on this piece are bird heads. Something of the aesthetic sense of the Tapaj6 potters is indicated by the fact that this small and usually beautiful animal supports only smaller figures of its kind; in contrast, the crocodile, big and ugly, supports an array of animals and often a bird beside. The Tapajo found in the jacare a useful ornamental motif, but they often seem to have made sport of him in their design. This piece was found on the northern bank of the Amazon east of Santarem. Other Tapajo pieces also have been found there. (Monte Alegre.) 6. P1. 34-d. A six-lobed vessel. The neck has the usual quadran- gular engraved decoration on its upper section. Two flanges. The bulbous section is decorated with a face in relief directly back of each frog on the shoulders. A little bird sits on the tip of the jacare's jaw; behind it is a little dog. The base is decorated by two bands at its lower margin ornamented with short diagonal lines and, above them, by four bird heads grouped in two pairs on opposite sides, and by four perforations- one between each two bird heads (not visible in the illustration), and one on either side of the base between the bird heads. (Santarem.) 7. P1. 35-a. A six-lobed piece with one flange. A curvilinear design covers the upper section of the neck, while the bulbous section is decorated with a scroll design in relief. The jacare heads with round-rimmed pro- tuberant eyes are engraved; below each eye is a per- foration, probably for feather decoration. The com- plete wing supports a bird head at the tip, and both wings are decorated with monkey-like figures. Face designs and engraving on the base. (Santarem.) 8. P1. 35-c. Interesting in that the neck has three flanges and that its upper section is decorated by a series of en- 40</page><page sequence="42">THE ARCHAEOLOGY circling engraved lines. There is a face with round- rimmed protuberant eyes on the bulbous section. The jacare head is highly stylized; so is the little dog it supports. The base is ornamented with zoomorphic heads in relief and a curvilinear engraved design. (Santarem.) O. Incomplete Pieces 1. P1. 5-d. A large bowl painted white on the outside and red on the inside. The outer surface is decorated with three sets of three engraved protuberances. The sup- port is missing but apparently was single in form, probably a flaring-ring type. (Santarem.) 2. P1. 9-b. Fragment of a large vessel having an inset neck. There is a cutia head in handle position on one side; the opposite one is missing. The body is decorated by batrachian figures in relief arranged between perpen- dicular serpentine motifs. The bottom is missing but the support was probably of the flaring-ring type and the vessel may have been similar in design to pl. 11-c. Excellent workmanship. 3. P1. 25-b. A fine piece which, from its general style, seems to have had a flaring-ring base. Its excellent craftsman- ship and overall design suggest that it is basically Tapajo although it comes from a considerable distance above Santarem on the Rio Tapaj6s. The surface is decorated with a red rectangular scroll on a white background; this design extends across the shoulder to the base of the neck. The neck, characteristically Tapaj6 in form, is set in a slight depression, another Tapaj6 trait; it is painted red on the outside, white on the inside. A ridge around the shoulder is decorated with pits and little pitted knobs. Two zoomorphic heads rest on the ridge in handle position. There is a pitted band around the base of the neck. (Itaituba.) 4. P1. 42-b. Fragment of a large vessel. The handles are of a common Tapaj6 type as is also the neck. The unusual element is design on the body. The general lines of the fragment suggest that it probably had a flaring-ring base. Red and white decoration. (Santarem.) 5. P1. 43-a. The body appears to have been in the form of a turtle, and the decoration on the upper section is that char- acteristically employed on turtle representations. The only problem concerning the vessel is the form of the neck; it was probably similar to the one-flange, per- forated style figured on other turtle pieces, pls. 28-a and 29-b. The base is decorated with a series of faces in relief on which the features serve for more than one face. This is a Marajo as well as a Tapaj6 trait. Traces of dark paint. Fine workmanship. (Av. Rui Barbosa, Santarem.) 6. P1. 45-a. In its complete form this piece was probably similar to pl. 30-a. (Santarem.) Type VII. Vessels Having a Medially Constricted Annular Base A. Winged Bottles The two pieces figured in this classification appear to be a transitional type featuring the medially constricted annular base, characteristic of the caryatid vessels, but supporting in these cases winged bottles, which custom- arily rest upon a flaring-ring base. 1. P1. 35-d. A highly stylized, slightly lobed piece, but decorated like most winged bottles, a dog on the jacare wing, a face on the bulbous section of the neck, a frog on the shoulder. The ornament on the base is a serpentine motif in relief; the supports of the bottle are small zoomorphic forms. (Santarem.) 2. P1. 36-c. A six-lobed vessel. The decoration of the jacare wings is especially playful in spirit and seems to rep- resent a bird feeding a dog (or other animal) with a serpentine form. The bulbous section of the neck is decorated with a scroll in relief. The supports of the bottle are rectangular pieces pierced in the center; a bird head and two feet rest on the upper edge of the base. The relief decoration on the body between the wings is missing. Engraved scroll design on the base. (Santarem.) B. Caryatid Vessels The caryatid dish is strikingly characteristic of Tapajo ceramic design and its artistry is often re- markable. The caryatids themselves are always little squatting human forms with sturdy bodies and broad heads designed for carrying a load. Sometimes these figures are quite naturalistic, sometimes definitely stylized. They are always three in number and, with one exception, all I have seen are either female or sexless. As far as my research has extended, this type of vessel always rests upon a medially constricted annular base; also, it adheres to a certain form-pattern and decorative tradition. The dish itself is a rather shallow bowl which turns in definitely, but for little distance, at the shoulder. This shoulder angle is covered with an appliqued decorated band which supports the adornos. This band is usually pierced at four equidistant points, possibly for feather decoration, possibly for suspension. The neck is broad and straight and inset, often ex- ceeding in height the actual depth of the bowl itself; its upper section is covered with an engraved collar, from the lower edge of which a narrow ledge extends. The adornos, also, conform to a more or less definite pattern, being either avian or a combination of avian 41 VOL. 50, PT. 3, 1960]</page><page sequence="43">PALMATARY: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE LOWER TAPAJOS [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. Soc. and quasi-human figures, or quasi-human and uni- dentified zoomorphic forms. The base and the neck are decorated with simple engraved designs which contrast effectively with ornateness of the shoulder decoration. In these caryatid vessels the Tapajo display their usual gaiety, enjoyment of the world about them, and add an occasional bit of humor. Like the elaborate winged bottles, the caryatid dishes are artistically satisfying; from whatever angle they are viewed both the form and the balance are good. Seen in a group and superficially observed, the first impression is that these vessels are closely similar; however, more careful examination reveals the individuality of each. No doubt, originally, the caryatid dishes were painted, but today it is only rarely that a trace of paint may be found upon them. Judging from the number of cary- atids and shoulder adornos in sherd collections, it would seem that these dishes must have been a common ceramic form among the Tapajo. 1. P1. 32-a. Very unusual in that the caryatid figures are mascu- line; they are depicted with one hand on the knee, the other raised to the face. The shoulder supports four avian figures and four double-headed figures, apparently zoomorphic. The base and neck are deco- rated with pits and engraving. No paint. 2. P1. 36-d. Bat figures not infrequently appear in Tapajo de- sign but most often on caryatid dishes. On this one the bat heads alternate with an avian form consisting of a bird head attached to a very small body from either side of which extends a rather batlike jointed appendage. This form is fairly common. The collar is characteristic of the bat dishes in that it is decorated with a simple design made up of groups of engraved parallel hori- zontal lines separated by divisional units made up of groups of engraved vertical lines. The base is deco- rated with engraved curvilinear lines and pits. In this case the caryatids appear to be a heterogeneous collection employed in the restoration and not neces- sarily those of the dish originally. No paint. (Santarem.) 3. P1. 36-e. This piece features two types of avian forms fre- quently found in sherd collections and here used alter- nately around the shoulder. The form seen in profile to the far left, and which appears almost in full-face a little to the right of the center, is of especial interest. This type has been discussed by Barata 25 who points out that in an upright position, as in the illustration, the figure has anthropomorphic characteristics, while if placed in a horizontal position it appears avian. See also fig. 5, a to f. It is to be noted that the avian heads 25Barata, 1950 (1): figs. 10, 11. are turned alternately inward and outward around the shoulder of the vessel, thus giving a nice balance to the design. The collar and base are decorated with engraving and pits. The caryatids are squatting figures with round-rimmed protuberant eyes, their hands on their knees. (Santarem.) 4. P1. 36-f. A piece which illustrates several features commonly found in caryatid dishes but not in the same combina- tion. First, superimposed opposing scrolls such as appear on the neck; also the divisional unit which separates them from the next pair and which consists of crossed engraved lines with pits in the four sections thus created. Next, the adornos are a half-human, half-avian combination, consisting of a somewhat human head surmounted by a sort of crown, but supported by a winged figure having a beaklike appendage extending from the chin to the lower part of the body, thus serving as a decorative handle. The combination of the human and the avian on caryatid vessels is common. Evidently, between these figures were the same type of human- bird form with clasped hands or raised wings which was described concerning figure e on the same plate. The caryatids, also, are of a common form-seated female figures with the hands covering the eyes; this type may have had its origin in the fact that Tapajo women were not permitted to witness certain tribal ceremonies. Finally, the decoration on the base appears frequently on caryatid bases-see pl. 38-b and c. Barata regards this type of curvilinear and punctate design to be of frog inspiration.26 Unpainted. (Santarem.) 5. P1. 37-a. As on the piece just discussed, the caryatids are squatting female figures with hands covering the eyes. The decorated band about the neck consists of a unit made up of connected opposing scrolls with a short line between them, a motif Barata believes to be of coruja or screech owl origin; 27 alternating with this unit is another made up of pitted triangular sections. The principal adornos consist of the crowned quasi- human head with the long appendage forming a handle, but unlike those on the vessel just described, the winglike extensions which support the head terminate in small zoomorphic representations. Alternate figures around the shoulder are of the reversible anthro- pomorphic-zoomorphic type previously discussed. No paint. (Santarem, Aldeia.) 6. P1. 38-a. All the adornos are avian forms and, apparently, the original number was six. The extension supporting these bird figures is pierced in four places for feathers or, possibly, for suspension. An unusual feature is an engraved band of opposed diagonal lines on the under surface of the bowl directly underneath the relief fig- 26 Barata 1950 (1) : 190 ff.; figs. 1, 1A, 1B, 46A. 27 Barata, 1953: 191, fig. 35. 42</page><page sequence="44">THE ARCHAEOLOGY ures; also on this area are traces of red and black paint. The caryatids are legless. The base is decorated with the usual curvilinear and pitted design. The ornament on the band around the neck is unusual for a caryatid dish; it consists of a sun or eye-like motif 28 flanked by parallel vertical engraved lines forming a sort of unit; these units are separated from each other by groups of parallel horizontal engraved lines. (San- tarem, Aldeia.) 7. P1. 38-b. Seemingly, the adornos originally consisted of three figures of the reversible human-avian type previously discussed, and three of another common type, that of a quasi-human crowned head supported by a winglike form the sides of which terminated in bird heads. The band supporting the adornos is perforated at four points. The neck is decorated with an engraved design consisting of vertical opposed scrolls suggesting a possible owl face, and a motif commonly employed in neck decoration-a rectangle divided diagonally by engraved lines, the sections filled with pits. The caryatids are squatting female figures, their hands on their kness. The eyes are of the coffee-bean type. The usual curvilinear and pit decoration appears on the base. Traces of dark red paint on the interior of the bowl. 8. P1. 38-c. On this piece the curvilinear and short-incision design commonly employed on the base is used, as well, on the band around the neck. The caryatids have one hand over an eye, the other on one knee. Their eyes are of the coffee-bean type. The adornos consist of the usual reversible human-avian form alternating with a two-headed figure resting upon an out-turning en- graved support; this figure consists of a human and a bird head, the human figure having a single arm raised to the face. All the adorno figures have round-rimmed protuberant eyes. No paint at present. (Santarem, Aldeia.) 9. P1. 38-d. The hands of the caryatids are clasped over their mouths. The adornos consist of the usual reversible human-avian form alternating with a two-headed figure consisting of one avian and one quasi-human form; in this case a single armlike element extends from the lower part of the common body to the mouth of the bird head, forming a kind of handle. The eyes on the caryatids as well as those on the adornos are of the round-rimmed protuberant type. The decoration on the base is a modification of the usual curvilinear and pitted design. The decoration around the neck con- sists of a series of connected opposing scrolls with an eye-like motif at the extremity of each; the intervening 28 Some authorities believe that this motif suggests light. Missionary Daniel reported sun, moon, and star worship by the Arapiuns on the Tapaj6s. Daniel, 1916: 2: 494. spaces are filled with pits and short lines. No paint at present. (Santarem.) 10. P1. 39-b. The neck decoration consists of alternate groups of parallel vertical and parallel horizontal engraved lines. On the shoulder, birdlike forms with crossed limbs rest between other avian figures with outstretched wings, while birds in more extreme relief extend in suggestion of handles. There are four perforations in the shoulder band. The caryatids have their hands on their knees. The eyes of both the adornos and the caryatids are round-rimmed protuberant. The base is decorated with the frequently used curvilinear and pitted design. No paint. (Santarem.) 11. PI. 40-b. The base decoration is somewhat unusual, consisting of alternate units of engraved concentric quadrangles and pitted angular sections. The neck ornament con- sists of face-like designs separated by vertical parallel lines. One hand of the caryatids is raised to the mouth, the other is placed on the knee. The adornos are two-headed avian and quasi-human forms alternat- ing with a birdlike figure. The eyes on both the caryatids and the adornos are round-rimmed pro- tuberant. Four perforations in the shoulder band. No paint. (Santarem.) 12. P1. 40-d. A very fine dish all the relief decoration of which is based upon bat motifs. The collar is similar to that of pl. 36-d, and the base has the usual engraved curvilinear and pit ornamentation. The caryatids are highly stylized, the lower limbs are practically elimi- nated, the hands are clasped in front of the body. No paint. (Santarem.) C. Incomplete Pieces 1. PI. 12-d. A piece in Gothenburg which has a deeply grooved rim with spanning handles. This and another vessel, also in Gothenburg and published by Nordenskiold,29 were believed by him to have been supported by caryatids, having had three marks of fractures on their under surface. I disagree with this theory for various reasons: first, in several thousand Tapajo specimens examined I have never encountered caryatids large enough to have been used in the support of such vessels, each of which is 33 cm. in diameter; caryatid forms are almost standard- ized in height, usually varying between 3.5 and 4 cm. Neither have I seen caryatid bases, either complete or incomplete, large enough to have been a proportionate part of such vessels; again, caryatid vessels never have grooved rims, but a specialized thin single form; finally, caryatid vessels do not have spanning handles for the reason that their rims are not double. 29 Nordenski6ld, 1930: pI. XXIX-b. VOL. 50, PT. 3, 1960] 43</page><page sequence="45">PALMATARY: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE LOWER TAPAJOS [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. Dr. Stig Ryden has restored these vessels as tripods, although both were found at Santarem where a tripod support is very unusual. His letter states that he made the decision on the basis of foot forms in the Nimuendajui collection in Gothenburg gathered from Santarem, Santo Antonio, Lago Maraja, and other Tapaj6 sites. He states ". . as feet are more fre- quent in the region west of the Tapajo ceramics and of the same shape in these regions, I think they are borrowed from there." 30 The piece figured suggests an interesting possibility. The grooved rim with spanning handles is Tapajo in design, but not Tapajo at its best. The other piece in Gothenburg, previously referred to, does not have a grooved rim, but four decorative handles which extend from a single rim to a narrow ledge on the outside of the vessel considerably below the rim. The decora- tion on this piece is definitely non-Tapajo, figuring the doughnut eye, so characteristic of wares from the Trombetas-Nhamunda area. In my opinion the piece figured illustrates a merging of the ceramic styles of two tribes which traded actively but whose structural and decorative traditions were quite different, combin- ing the tripod support common on the north bank of the Amazon, the four spanning handles common among the Tapajo, and the grooved rim which has been re- ported from both areas. The other piece (not illus- trated) displays only one Tapajo trait, four decorative handles, although four handles on single-rimmed vessels appear in Maraj6 and several cultures to the north. It is important, in this connection, to differentiate between vessels with grooved rims and concentric dishes. The concentric dish is shallow-pls. 11-a, b; 12-b, c. The inner rim is definitely the rim of the inner vessel, while the distance between this and the outer rim is considerable. Four handles span these rims. I have never seen fracture marks on the under surface of any of these vessels or sherds of them. In contrast, vessels with grooved rims, as far as we have any evidence concerning them, were deep; in addition to the two specimens discussed, Hilbert reports a frag- ment of one from Lago Sapucua in the Trombetas area which was 8 to 10 cm. in depth and to which a portion of a foot was attached, suggesting it may have had a tripod support.31 There is no suggestion of a double vessel in the structure of these pieces; the space between the inner and outer rim-edges is very narrow (fig. 7-e). 2. PI. 16-a. An unusual piece decorated around the shoulders with four zoomorphic figures with upraised paws. In the intervening spaces are smaller heads with a single engraved circle to represent the eye; between these heads are short perpendicular incisions. It seems that this must have been a caryatid vessel as there are 30 Ryden, letter, December 13, 1954. 31 Hilbert, 1954: 827 ff. three marks indicating supports on its under surface. (Santarem.) 3. P1. 35-b. Both in form and decoration this fragment appears to have belonged to the bowl of a caryatid vessel. (Santarem.) Type VIII. Vessels Having Three Supports True tripods, having three identical or similar equi- distant feet, did not appear in the collections studied. Nevertheless, the Tapajo sometimes stabilized their zoomorphic vessels by utilizing some anatomic feature as a tail, or combined two legs of a quadruped to form one, thus producing three supports. A. Zoomorphic Bottles 1. PI. 44-a. A bottle depicting a monkey chewing on an ear of corn. The stabilizing element is the tail. The eye is round-rimmed protuberant, the joints are indicated, the back humped, and there is a decorative extension at the back of the head. Traces of black paint. (San- tarem, Aldeia.) 2. P1. 44-d. A little bottle showing traces of red and black decoration on a white background. The eye is round- rimmed protuberant, the back is humped, and a wing- like ornament extends from the back of the head. The tail is the stabilizing element. (Santarem, Aldeia.) 3. PI. 44-c, e. A bird bottle. The wings are missing, though the tail is intact. When found, the rear support was missing, but as the scar of its attachment was clear, Mr. Townsend supplied a new foot. This piece, though found at Belterra, is distinctly in the Tapajo tradition, having the round-rimmed protuberant eye, and a neck with an engraved collar and perforated ledge. Traces of white paint. (Belterra.) B. Onca Jars 1. P1. 46-a, b. This piece displays a number of Tapaj6 traits: as usual, the onca has a victim; the surface has the customary decoration-black quadrangles on a light background with a dark spot in the center of each quadrangle, and also traces of red paint; the neck, placed in the center of the back, is similar to that on the reclining form, pl. 48-a; comparing the views of this neck in both a and b, another Amazonian trait is evident-an ear on one side becomes a nose on the other and the eyes serve for two faces; this trick of decoration is common on Marajo as well as Tapajo pottery. The unusual feature is the fusion of the two hind legs into one support. This was the only piece in the collections studied which showed this character- istic. (Santarem.) 44</page><page sequence="46">THE ARCHAEOLOGY Type IX. Vessels Having Four Supports A. Globular Bottles in Zoomorphic Form 1. P1. 47-a. A bottle representing an onca grasping a bone. The neck is decorated with concentric quadrangles, its ledge is perforated. The eye is round-rimmed protuberant and enclosed in an engraved area. The tail is decorated with engraved stripes which completely encircle it, while between the stripes are bands consisting of engraved lines diagonally opposed. A four-legged animal with curled tail climbs the side of the vessel. The stylistic representation of the onca's mouth, which is always depicted as open and surrounded with big teeth, and the fact that there is so often some object, animate or inanimate, in its claws, suggest the voracity of that large and handsome animal. (Santarem.) B. Lobed Bottles Having Zoomorphic Characteristics 1. PI. 12-a. A four-lobed vessel having a face on one lobe and a tail on the opposite lobe; the intervening lobes are decorated with concentric engraved lines. The ledge around the lower part of the neck of the bottle has four perforations. Supported by four zoomorphic feet. 2. PI. 37-b. A vessel having a zoomorphic face on two opposite lobes, concentric engraved circles on one of the inter- vening lobes, and no doubt originally also on the one which is now missing. On the base are marks of four small supports. No paint. (Santarem.) 3. P1. 43-b. A four-lobed vessel. The head is represented on one lobe, the tail on the opposite one. The two intervening lobes are decorated with engraved geometric motifs. The neck of the bottle is the same type as that which appears on the winged bottles, and its decoration is that which is frequently used on the bases of caryatid vessels. The general form of the body is similar to that of four-lobed bottles having a flaring-ring base. Thus, this piece represents a combination of several Tapajo characteristics, both of form and decoration. It is also typical of Tapajo design in that it suggests alertness and activity-Tapaj6 figures are always do- ing something; they are rarely completely static. The eye is the round-rimmed protuberant type; there is an ornament in the ear. The face is quite human but the animal has four legs and a tail. The sex is masculine. (Santarem, Aldeia.) C. Onca Jars 1. P1. 47-b. A unique piece. It represents a small onfa, its stance indicating strain, supporting a much larger on(a, its tail raised, its claws clutching a little human form. It is of interest that, above the supporting column, there is a complete vessel, neck to base, similar to the onca jars previously discussed and illus- trated on pls. 25, 26, 27. The decoration consists of black-outlined quadrangles on a white background with a black dot in the center of each, thus depicting the onca pintada or spotted jaguar; red parallel lines sur- round the body and neck. The vessel represents a combination of Tapajo tradition in form and decoration of the onga and an interesting departure from it in the employment of a zoomorphic support. A nicely balanced piece. (Santarem, Aldeia.) D. Winged Bottles Having a Zoomorphic Support 1. P1. 39-a. A bizarre specimen. The upper section is that of a winged bottle having the usual flanged neck bulbous at the base, crocodile wings supporting small zoomor- phic figures, frogs in high relief on the shoulders. The support is a turtle-like figure, its stance suggesting the great weight of its burden. (Santarem, Aldeia.) Type X. Vessels in Anthropomorphic Form A. Seated Figures 1. P1. 40-c. An interesting vessel. It depicts a seated hunchback having shriveled limbs and a deformed chest. From the number of examples in Tapajo collections of vessels and figurines depicting physical deformities and crip- pling disease, it would seem that the Tapajo were interested in these abnormalities, and perhaps believed that they had other than mere physical significance. Mr. C. H. T. Townsend, Jr., of Belterra tells me that today the caboclos or country folk along the Tapajos consider a hunched back to be good luck. On this figure the hair is carefully indicated by means of short incisions; the ears have been prepared for ornament; the eye is protuberant and rimmed, but oval in shape. A short neck extends from the top of the head, and a narrow ledge at the base gives a hatlike effect. Painted red. (Santarem, Aldeia.) 2. P1. 41-a, c. A vessel in the form of a seated male figure. His wrists are adorned with bracelets; he holds a rattle in his right hand; a bag, which seems to be made of a cutia hide, is slung over his left shoulder. His ears are without ornament but show the usual preparation for disks. The eye is protuberant and rimmed, but is oval in shape. The nose and mouth are well modeled. The spinal column is indicated. A scalloped ring around the crown of the head forms the base of the neck of the vessel. Painted red. (Santarem.) 3. P1. 48-b. An interesting piece. The position of the legs and that of the arms suggest relation to the crescent-based figurine, so characteristic of the Tapajo culture. The figure also raised the question of whether the legs were 45 VOL. 50, PT. 3, 1960]</page><page sequence="47">PALMATARY: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE LOWER TAPAJOS [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. so designed merely to form a substantial base for the vessel or whether the artist was aiming at recording an infirmity. The eye is round-rimmed protuberant. The decoration is red and black diagonal lines on a white background. The feet, eyes and mouth are red. (Alter do Chao.) 4. P1. 49-a, e. A jar in the form of a seated figure having bowed legs and a badly deformed body. Under his right arm he holds a gourd. A button-like ornament adorns his ear and there are bracelets on his wrists. On the back of the vessel the hair is represented by an engraved design which suggests triple braids. The body colors are red and tan, but there seems to have been a wide black constrictive band on the legs. (Santarem, Aldeia.) B. Standing Figures 1. P1. 50-a, b. A piece which is highly stylized and cleverly designed. A figure of this type is not easy to stabilize, but the artist has accomplished this by squatting the form, spreading the arms and attaching them to the knees, and by extending the heels a little. The proportions are interesting: the height of the head and neck about equals that of the remainder of the body, and the head is actually wider than the shoulders. In profile the back is slightly humped. The highly formalized face is not expressionless and the figure is not simply dead form but, like all Tapajo anthropomorphic and zoomor- phic representations, it is very much alive. The neck of the vessel protrudes from the top of the head and its form is like that of the Tapajo bottles; the eye is of the slit protuberant variety; the ear is lobed and contains an ornament; decorative bands adorn the arms; short hair is indicated by incisions on the back of the head. The decoration, suggesting tattooing, is black on a highly polished cream-colored surface. The mouth, the hands, the feet and the ears are red. Dr. Barata rightly keeps this piece under glass, but he reports that it is light in weight owing to the thinness of its clay structure.32 (Santarem.) Type XI. Miniature Vessels Miniature vessels and fragments of them are common in Tapaj6 collections. Sometimes these are roughly made suggesting that they may have been the work of children or of beginners in the pottery craft; however, these little pieces often display fine workmanship, sug- gesting that they may have been designed as gifts for the small folk of the tribe. It is possible, also, that the Tapajo may have had uses for these miniature vessels even as we, today, have uses for small containers. 32 Barata, 1953 (1) : 6 ff. A.

The engraving on the back could suggest either hair or feathers. The human feet form two supports, but the third is an engraved tail-like element. The eyes of both the bird and the human figure are round- rimmed protuberant. The ear is lobed and contains an ornament. The piece is highly satisfactory from which- ever side it is viewed. I did not see this piece; the photograph was the gift of Dr. Frederico Barata of Belem. 2. P1. 52-e.

The little bird figures which ornament its upper surface are common in Tapajo collections, but this is the only case, in those studied, in which the figures were attached. Lids are extremely rare in Tapaj6 pottery so there is little substantial background for speculation as to the type of vessel such a lid might cover, but Barata believes it to have been a broad-mouthed effigy vessel.33 The outside of the cover is painted cream-color throughout; the inside with its four small depressions and large central one also has a cream-colored background. Between the small depressions are quadrangles outlined in red and black; the complicated zoomorphic decora- tion within the quadrangles is black. (Rua 24 de Outubro, Santarem, Aldeia.) 2. P1. 78-b.

Figurines There are many figurines and fragments of figurines in Tapajo collections. Some of these are crude forms seemingly the work of beginners or, perhaps, hastily made pieces for the immediate pleasure of a child. Most, however, are the products of skilled potters. On the pieces that are definitely Tapajo, certain traditions are regularly observed-the ear is bilobed and usually contains an ornament or shows the effects of having been prepared for one. The eye is round- rimmed protuberant or coffee bean in form, or a modification of the latter, a sort of slit protuberant variety. Decorative headbands and incised designs representing the hair appear on most of the figurines, giving some idea of the customary headgear and hair- dressing styles of the tribe. Ornamental constrictive bands on the arms and legs appear in several instances. In a previous study based upon collections in the United States and Sweden,35 I discussed the crescent- based figurine from the Tapajo area and the distribu- tion of this form in other early American cultures. There are many more of this type in the newly studied Brazilian collections. Because of the definite stylization of some of these pieces and also of the fine craftsman- ship, it seems they must have been idols. Others seem a mere portrayal of some human type or individual. An element which did not appear in the previously studied collections is the large figurine. Only a few have been found, but they throw new light on the ceramic skill of the Tapajo, on their dress and customs, and perhaps also upon the diseases with which the tribe was plagued. The zoomorphic forms are mostly lively little monkey figures. The other conspicuous non-human type is the one-footed or pedestal figurine. 33Barata, 1953 (1) : 7 ff. 34Hartt, 1885: 14 ff. 5 Palmatary, 1939. 47 VOL. 50, PT. 3, 1960]</page><page sequence="49">PALMATARY: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE LOWER TAPAJOS [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. A. Anthropomorphic Forms 1. P1. 49-a, b, c. Figure a depicts Snra. Liebold with two of the pieces found and restored by her and her late husband. The smaller one is a vessel more clearly illustrated by e on the same plate. The height of the larger, a figurine, is 58 cm. It represents a seated, bow-legged, masculine figure, his torso bulkily disproportionate to the size of his limbs suggesting a physical condition similar to that portrayed by pl. 40-c. The object on the right leg may have represented a rattle. Figure c is the back view of the head of the figurine and illustrates with figure b, the back view of another figurine head, a type of hair dressing seemingly in vogue along the Tapaj6s. On both heads the ear lobe had been distended for ornament. (Santarem, Aldeia.) 2. P1. 54-a, b. Perhaps the finest figurine in the collections studied. It represents a small Tapajo girl squatting Indian- fashion and amusing hereself by sucking her toe. The background is a smooth, highly polished, cream-colored surface over which is decoration in red and black, some of which probably represents tatooing. Barata sug- gests that this decoration must have been added after the original firing as it peels off easily.36 The apparel of this Indian infant consists of constrictive bands above the ankle and below the knee and on the lower arm as well. The eye is of the coffe-bean type and the ear contains an ornament. The head is surmounted in front by a crownlike ornament; in the back the hair extends below the waist in carefully dressed braids. A hole in the crown of the head suggests provision for feather decoration. The little figure wears an engraved tanga, and a hole in the anal area shows the clay walls to be thick, making the piece heavy and giving it stability. Excellent in both design and craftmanship. (Santarem, Aldeia.) 3. P1. 55-a, b, c. A large but incomplete piece representing a woman holding a bowl. Her eye is of the coffee-bean type, her lower ear lobe is greatly distended, extending to her shoulder; it contains no ornament. The bowl, when intact, rested upon the unnatural enlargements of her legs caused by the constrictive bands. The arms seem not to have had such bands. This figure wears a sort of diadem which Barata believes to be of coati inspira- tion.37 A hole in the top of the head suggests provision for feather decoration. The background is cream- colored, the decoration on the legs is red and black, and there is a red and black over white ornamental band around the neck; traces of red and black appear on the outside of the bowl. This piece illustrates an important feature of Tapajo design-its figures are not mere traditional forms but, 36Barata, 1953 (1): 6. 7 Ibid., 7. instead, usually suggest activity. This woman is not simply sitting and holding a bowl; the back view shows that her muscles are tense, and her facial expression and jutting breasts suggest imminent activity. In respect to this dynamic quality, Tapajo art contrasts markedly with that of Marajo which is preeminently geometrical, formal, and rarely suggests alertness or motion. (Av. Rui Barbosa, Santarem, Aldeia.) 4. P1. 56-a. An unusually large figurine. Both arms are missing, but the fingers of one hand remain attached to the body. The eyes are round-rimmed protuberant, the ear lobes are greatly distended. These are Tapajo traits. The head is rather flat in the back and displays no special headdress. The figure had been painted white and it wears an engraved tanga. The representation of the lower limbs and feet is unusual for Tapaj6 design, and this is the only such departure in the collections studied. However, in Venezuela, similar lower-limb forms are common, and Requena calls attention to the disproportion between the size of the upper and lower limbs on such pieces.38 Although the arms on this one are missing, the size of the trunk and the one hand resting on it suggests that this figurine, like those in Venezuela, had arms of normal size. The heads on the Venezuelan pieces are broad and flat, and the eye is a long slit protuberant form. This piece is typically Tapajo down to mid- height, but the representation of the lower limbs sug- gests culture relations with northern South America and possibly a diseased condition common to both areas.39 5. P1. 57-b. A stooping figure supporting a smaller one on his back. The eyes of both are round-rimmed protuberant, the lobed ears contain ornaments. Each figure wears a crownlike headdress. Traces of red paint. (Santarem.) 6. P1. 59-g. A seated female figure, the form of which suggests the origin of the crescent-based figurines to be discussed presently. This piece is, however, quite realistically designed with legs widely spread, the feet well modeled, not only with toes and heels, but also with toenails clearly indicated. The eyes are similar to those usually used on crescent-based forms, and the arms are in normal position. A simple band decorates the head; the hair is not indicated. The ear is lobed and there is a perforation, apparently for ornament, in front of it. There is a hole in the bottom; the body seems to have been painted white. This piece appears to have been a borrowing from the Tapajo rather than an actual Tapaj6 product. (Belterra.) 38Requena, 1932: 117; also 57, 73, 133 (31). Kidder II, 1944: pl. VII, figs. 22, 23.

Crescent-based Forms In my original Tapajo study,40 I called attention to a type of figurine from Santarem and vicinity which was marked by a stylization of the legs into a crescentic form suggesting, perhaps, an individual kneeling with knees widely separated, the feet having been absorbed in the stylization. Such a form might have developed, also, from figures similar to that on pl. 59-g previously discussed since, in a few instances, incisions appear on the tips of the crescent, suggesting toes. Crescent-based figurines are either sexless or female, often they wear a tanga. There are comparatively few of these pieces in the American and Swedish collections, upon which my original study was based, but the Brazilian collections contain a considerable number of them. While similar forms, some of which have been interpreted as phalliform, appear in Marajo ceramics, the crescent-based figurine was much more character- istic of the Tapajo than of the more ancient peoples of Marajo. This type of figurine is not, however, peculiar to the Amazonian cultures but is found archaeologically over a vast area to the north, a problem which will be discussed later on in this study. 1.

This piece is speckled with bright shiny spots which, at first glance, appear to be varnish. However, tabatinga, the fine clay with which the Tapajo surfaced their pottery, is capable of taking a high polish, and the small shiny spots on this and many other fragments are merely the result of friction. (Lago Grande.) 9. P1. 60-c, e. Depicts an individual whose arms seem to have been amputated. Black vertical stripes extend from the top of the head to the waist on the front of the figurine and also on its back. There is a small protuberance on either side of the top of the head. The ears are normally formed and there is a hole in each. No headband. The lower section of the figure appears to have been dark. Base not perforated. A very unhappy figure, possibly a prisoner. (Santarem.) 10. P1. 60-d, f. The figure wears the usual headband, the hair is represented by deep incisions. One ear is missing, the other contains a button-like ornament. The nostrils are indicated by punctates. Holes in the back of the head. Probably solid; covered with fine tabatinga clay. 11. P1. 61-a, c. A typically Tapajoan piece having round-rimmed protuberant eyes and a double-lobed ear. There is a hole on either side of the back near the waistline, one at the base of the head, and one in the bottom. The head is flat in the back and surmounted by two small protuberances. A tanga is indicated. The figure is definitely a hunchback; hunchbacks are not uncommon in Tapajo ceramic design. Painted bright red. (Taperhina.) 12. P1. 61-b, d. Only slightly crescentic. Heavy. No hole in the base, but one in the top of the head. Pebbles inside. Slightly hunchbacked with part of the spinal column in relief. Only one arm, and apparently intended to represent an individual who had lost an arm. Pro- tuberances on the extremities of the base suggest possible amputation of the legs. The headband is extended over the top of the head from ear to ear. Not typically Tapajoan. (Santarem.) 13. P1. 62-a, c. Typically Tapajoan. Round-rimmed protuberant eyes, tanga, and decorative headband. The base is broken; traces of red and white paint. 14. P1. 63-a, b. A madonna type of crescent-based figurine. As in many of the crescent-based types, the head is dis- proportionately large. The eyes are slit-protuberant, the mouth broad, the face has actual expression. The figure is holding what appears to be the remnants of a representation of a small child. A tanga is indicated. The ears are highly stylized and there are holes behind them. The hair is carefully portrayed and the headband is characteristic of those on the best of the figurines. Covered with a coating of fine tabatinga clay. C. Pedestal Figurines These figurines consist of a human or quasi-human head supported by a pedestal or sort of leg to which a footlike appendage with an extended heel is attached to give the piece stability. Pedestal figurines are common in Tapajo collections; thus it seems that this type must have had some religious significance. Judg- ing from both complete and incomplete pieces, it appears that such figurines were always small, varying in height from six to ten centimeters. Of those which still retain some traces of paint the color is always white. 1. P1. 63-c. A rather crude specimen having the coffee-bean form of eye. (Santarem.) 2. PI. 64-a, c. One of the better pieces. The ear contains a large ornament; hair and headdress are indicated, and holes behind the ears may have been intended for feather ornamentation. The incisions on the foot suggest toes. (Santarem.) 3. P1. 64-e. The top of the head is missing. The eye is the slit protuberant type most commonly found on these fig- urines. The ear ornament is unusually large. (Lago Grande.) 4. P1. 64-g. One of the most interesting pieces. The head is not quite human as the ears are on top of it. On the level with the mouth there is a depression in the clay on either side of the face which gives the figure, viewed from the front, the effect of being three-faced. The toes are indicated. The eye is slit protuberant. Traces of white paint. (Santarem.) 5. P1. 66-d. A fine piece with a bilobed ear and a headband. Holes in the back of the head. Slit protuberant eye. Unpainted. (Belterra.) 6. PI. 66-b. This piece is definitely atypical. It actually seems to represent a little humpbacked figure seated on a pedestal. The ear is bilobed, pierced for ornament and, in addition, there is a deep hole in the ear proper. The eye is round-rimmed protuberant which is unusual for this type of figurine. The head is surmounted by a graduated circular headdress. The base is circular and in no way suggests a foot. The technique is definitely Tapaj6.

The problem it suggests is con- cerned with the vertical lines which cross the lips. The age of this piece is not known and I have read of no tradition of sewn lips among the Tapajo, but the early Mundurucu of the Upper Tapajos were widely known as coupeurs de tetes which they preserved; however, they seem not to have sewn the lips of these trophies.41 This piece in no way suggests a dried head but rather one which is much alive. This specimen and a feline head, to be discussed later, represent the only pieces depicting sewn lips in the Tapaj6 collections studied. At present the significance of this trait can only be conjectured. B. Zoomorphic Forms 1. P1. 51-w. A representation of an armadillo. Pitted band across the shoulder. (Belterra.) 2. P1. 79-b.

A similar small specimen also having sewn lips, but from Marajo Island, is figured by Torres.42 I have no specific in- formation concerning the origin of the piece illustrated, but my understanding is that it was found in the Tapajo area. Type XV. Whistles There are a goodly number of more or less complete whistles in the collections studied. With one exception all represented zoomorphic forms, the exception being one which represents a pedestal figurine. Another Tapajo whistle in anthropomorphic form was published by Nordenski6ld.43 On several of the whistles ex- amined the mouthpiece is broken, and on none is there more than one aperture besides the mouthpiece; very few show traces of paint.

Many adornos appear almost human in feature but display, also, non-human traits. Because it is not possible to classify such forms definitely, human and quasi-human heads have been grouped together. Studying such Tapajo fragments one cannot but be impressed with the contrast they present to human representations on Marajo pottery. These latter are always formal and meant to be suggestive rather than actual; they are expressions of a symbolic art for which the clues to interpretation are few. This quality does not, however, make Marajo art less interesting or less remarkable. Tapajo art, on the contrary, is intelligible to a considerable degree, expressing both the thought and the fancy of a lively, virile people. 1. P1. 62-e. A very unusual piece, certainly not Tapajo.

Tapajo sherd collections contain many examples of crocodile heads, but usually these served as "wings" on the winged bottles. See Type VI-N. Small croco- dile heads are not common. (Santarem.) D. Batrachian Representations In any large collection of Tapajo sherds batrachian forms are conspicuous. Sometimes these are quite realistically depicted with all four legs properly shaped and in natural position; in other cases the form has been modified either for stylistic purpose or to serve some definite function. Some clay batrachians are solid but many are hollow and a fair number contain pellets; almost all display some evidence of having been attached to another piece of pottery. Many of these detached pieces, because of their form, suggest that they had clung to the shoulders of winged bottles-pls. 32 to 36, 39. For this purpose the limbs have been modified to pose the piece in high relief and thus to bring into better balance the crocodile or long- beaked bird heads serving as "wings." In his important study of the frog motive in South American Indian art and the batrachian in American mythology generally, Wassen has suggested several reasons why the aboriginal should have regarded these little animals with interest and, seemingly, with awe: their great number in certain areas, the volume of their nocturnal croaking and sometimes its quality, croaking as a harbinger of rain, and through rain the promise of fertility for the land. Some batrachian species served as an important food, others provided an important venom. This author quotes Soares de Souza as stating that the Indians of the Bahian area referred to toads as cururus, adding that these animals ... do not bite and are harmless, but when dead they are dangerous, since their gall together with their liver and their hide make a terrible poison which the heathens use when they wish to kill somebody.45 Rodolpho von Ihering describes a sapo (toad), classified as Bufo marinus. He states that, of the Bufonideos, Bufo is the only genus in Brazil, and that, of it, marinus is the most common species there. This toad is twenty-two centimeters long, not includ- ing its legs. As an amphibian it is equally at home on land and in water. In the latter the female lays ropes of eggs as much as eight meters in length. Bufo marinus feeds on worms, insects, and larvae. This amphibian, however, produces a powerful venom which is secreted by numerous glands, and to this poison almost all animal life is sensitive. The sapo itself succumbs to a dose in the amount of one- three hundredth of what it produces. The toad is incapable of using its venom as a weapon for the reason that, under natural conditions, it is unable to eject it for any distance. However, if pressure is applied to its parotid glands, the venom is reported to squirt through the pores to a distance of half a meter. Ihering remarks, that while to the sapo this venom is a purely passive element of defense, no animal can attack it with impunity. This author further states that the poison of Bufo marinus is more deadly than that of the cobra, and that neither boiling nor direct contact with fire de- stroys it.46 The Europeans never learned the source of the Tapajo arrowpoison; it was known to be not curare because its fatal effects were different from those pro- duced by curare. Batrachians, and especially frogs, abound on the Tapaj6s.47 A few miles south of San- tarem a toad-shaped rock juts out into the river; it bears the name "Ponta de Cururu." 48 Leitao identifies the cururu as Bufo marinus.49 Could it have been the curur,u that supplied the Tapaj6 with their arrow- poison ? It seems that, from the Indian standpoint, such an animal as the cururui would have appeared a priceless treasure-a sizable sack of deadly poison fully prepared by an animal incapable of using it in its own defense. Thus native appreciation, or even adoration, would naturally have found expression in the arts of the area. 1. P1. 70-e. Possibly a stylized frog or toad head; had been painted red.

Bird Representations The Tapaj6 expressed their appreciation of the gorgeous bird life of their tropical homeland by the profusion of avian figures with which they decorated their pottery. Modeled in high relief, the very form of these ornaments has been responsible for their detach- ment and, while large numbers of bird representations appear in sherd collections, it is but rarely that one remains in its original position on a vessel. Only 56</page><page sequence="58">THE ARCHAEOLOGY occasionally are these birds naturalistically depicted; on the contrary they conform to a definite stylization which makes them easily recognizable in any collection. Such bird heads served as the "wings" on some of the winged bottles and probably also were attached in handle position on bowls or smaller vessels. 1. P1. 72-a. Probably intended to represent an owl.

The following pieces are bird representations from the Rio Trombetas, a northern tributary of the Amazon which enters it a little to the west of the Rio Tapaj6s. These pieces are all Tapaj6 and can be duplicated in all essentials many times in collections from Santarem. Such pieces present only part of the evidence that there was active trade between the Konduri who lived on the Trombetas and the Tapajo of the Lower Tapaj6s Valley. 12. PI. 75-a, b, d. Common forms in Santarem collections. The eye is round-rimmed protuberant. The relief and engraving no doubt are intended to suggest the brilliantly con- trasting colors which characterize Amazonian birds. (Santa Maria, Rio Trombetas.) 13. P1. 75-c. A less common form, but Tapajo in style. (Santa Maria, Rio Trombetas.) 14. PI. 75-e. It is not unusual for a little secondary bird head to rest on the tip of the beak of the larger one. The eyes are often double-rimmed. (Santa Maria, Rio Trombetas.) The following avian figures demonstrate a phase of dualism in Tapajo art, a characteristic which has been pointed out by Barata.50 By clever stylization, the designer of these little pieces has made it possible to seemingly convert them from bird to near-human rep- resentations simply by changing their position from the horizontal to the vertical, then by turning them slightly to display an adjoining face. Such specimens are fairly common in Tapajo collections. 15. Fig. 5-a, b. Two views of a bird; placed upright, the figure displays anthropomorphic characteristics, the wings suggesting arms; placed horizontally, it becomes avian. A little human face appears on the outer side of the wing. 16. Fig. 5-c, d.

Caryatids Caryatid vessels must have been common among the Tapajo, for separate caryatid forms in sherd collections are numerous. For the most part these detached pieces are well made and suggest definite traditional types. However, in the collection at the University Museum there are a few crude specimens from both Santarem and Lago Grande. It seems these could suggest an evolution in caryatid types, or they might be merely the products of inexperienced workmanship. I am in- clined to accept the latter theory as I have never seen bowls or bases which normally would have been attached to such simple supports; possibly in such instances the caryatid, by its more substantial form, outlived the more fragile constituents of the vessels which must have been equally crude in craftsmanship. With one exception, all the caryatids in the collec- tions examined were either female or sexless; the exception was the supporting figures on a dish in the Museu Paraense, Emilio Goeldi, the sex of which is definitely male. The cruder types of caryatids give a definite colum- nar effect; the more highly developed types depict a squatting figure. On all forms the head is dispropor- tionately large, often constituting half the height of the figure. The hands are variously arranged but are never employed to support the load-that is the function of the head (pls. 37-40). The umbilicus is usually prominent. Many caryatid forms are quite natural- istically depicted but some of the finer specimens are highly stylized, suggesting that the Tapaj6 had begun the formalization of the caryatid as they had the rep- resentations of the jacare, the toucan, and the on(a. These supporting figures are always anthropomor- phic. Their number is always three; they always stand alone. 58</page><page sequence="60">THE ARCHAEOLOGY A. Columnar Forms 1. P1. 71-a.

P1. 71-b. Another columnar form but more highly developed than the one just discussed. It features the coffee- bean eye; the lower limbs are suggested. Female. (Lago Grande.) 3. P1. 71-c. Crude, but ears, limbs and headdress are indicated. (Lago Grande.) 4. P1. 71-g. A columnar form on which the arms had been appliqued but are now missing; the eye is round- rimmed protuberant, indicating an advancement in type. Workmanship crude. Sex not indicated. (Santarem.) B. Naturalistic Forms 1. PI. 71-d. The workmanship is crude, but the figure is complete and squatting in posture, the eye is round-rimmed protuberant, hands raised to face, elements which place the form in the well-developed category. Sex not indicated. (Lago Grande.) 2. P1. 71-e. The eye is primitive, but the ear is bilobed and a squatting posture is suggested, thus placing the form higher in the developmental scale than those previously discussed. Sex not indicated. (Lago Grande.) 3. P1. 71-f. Somewhat rough in craftsmanship but conforms to the highly developed type except that the sex is not indicated. (Santarem.) 4. P1. 72-h. One of the cruder forms of complete caryatid in which the eye is punctate. Hands raised to the face. (Santarem.) 5. P1. 72-f. A common form. This type is supposed to have originated in the fact that Tapajo women, forbidden to observe certain ceremonies, were required, after carry- ing the beverages for the celebration, to retire to the periphery of the festal area and, squatting, to cover their eyes with their hands. (Santarem.) C. Stylized Forms 1. P1. 72-d. A common form. These highly stylized pieces sug- gest that, in Tapajo ceramic development, the caryatid passed through a series of modifications from simple and naturalistic forms to this armless type definitely designed for support and assuming something of a columnar effect. The coffee-bean eye is the form usually employed on this type of caryatid. (Santarem.) Type XVIII. Necks (Detached Pieces) A. Globular Forms 1. P1. 60-a. Neck of a small jar.

Handles Tapajo handles are usually ornamental rather than practical. Most of the pieces upon which they appear would normally be lifted in some other way; their use is primarily to balance the design of the vessel.

Another form in which the stylized cutia or bird head rests upon a looped handle. This type is of special interest because its appearance in other areas has helped us trace the trade routes of the Tapajo. Nordenskiold published a handle of this type found by Nimuendaju in Santarem and another found by Fewkes on Carriacou.52 In the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, there is another one of these handles (8125), in this case from St. Vincent; also two other cutia heads, seemingly Tapajo, from the same area, though not in handle form.53 The cutia is usually represented with its paws raised to its mouth; the loop suggests a modification of that motif. Nordenskiold refers to the form as a bird head; this may be, but some of the figures have prominent ears. (P1. 42-b, Santarem; 77-e, Piquiatuba.) G. Avian Forms 1. Pls. 16-c; 22-f.

Body Sherds In the Pennsylvania collection there are a number of undecorated or slightly decorated body sherds, parts apparently of fairly large vessels probably of the purely utilitarian type.

Hollow Rims Hollow rims are an outstanding feature of Amazonian ceramics since they are characteristic not only of Tapajo pottery design but of that of Maraj6 as well. It is pretty well established that the Maraj6 Indians had mastered the technique of firing these rims without an aperture, but the punctures which appear with fre- quency on Tapajo hollow rims led me to express the opinion that the knowledge of the technique of firing without apertures had not been passed on to the Tapajo.55 However, in the Townsend collection at Belterra there is a vessel (pl. 5-a, b) on which three- fourths of the hollow rim remains intact and there is no evidence of a puncture; it seems hardly likely that one or more apertures would be made only in that remaining quarter. Many of the perforations, not only in hollow rims but in other Tapaj6 vessel sections, may have been made primarily for feather ornamentation. In the Pennsylvania collection there are about an equal number of hollow rims from Santarem and Lago Grande, and all seem to be distinctly in the Tapajo tradition without discernible difference in style or technique between the two areas. With regard to the incidence and possible method of firing hollow rims, Linne makes the following statement: Vessels found in Venezuela (pottery fragments in the Ethnological Museum at Leipzig), on the Lower Amazon (G. M. 23, 10. 546), and in Tarupayu in Bolivia (G. M. 15. 2. 55), are occasionally provided with a hollow rim often altogether closed up. How through the firing-process it was possible to guard against air enclosed in the cavity bursting the surrounding walls during the heating, is an interesting question. To me, the most natural and simple explanation seems to be as follows. Mizque ceramics, for example, which are hard and give a ringing note on tapping, may be supposed to 55 Palmatary, 1950: 329. have been fired at a temperature of at least 800?. Ac- cording to the law of the expansion of gases, the air en- closed in the cavity must, when being heated, have expanded to about four times its volume. If it be supposed that the vessels were subjected to slow heating, the air should easily be able to diffuse at least up to 400?. Its increase in volume should during the remainder of the firing thus only amount to twice the original volume. Even then diffusion would take place, although on a lesser scale. The critical point in the firing therefore only occurs during its latter stage. The durable consistency of the paste leads one to suppose that it would be able to stand such pressure, provided the temperature be not too rapidly raised. Great caution would also have to be observed in the cooling, so as to allow the air to pass again through the walls.56 I. Rims Having a Smooth Surface a. Decorated only with Paint 1. P1. 83-d.

Wares Showing Basketry or Cloth Impressions In the collections examined, there are a considerable number of sherds from both Santarem and Lago Grande, and one from Belterra, which display basketry impressions on what must have been fragments of bases. However, I do not recall ever having seen a basketry or cloth impression on the base of any complete or even partially complete vessel in the true Tapaj6 tradition. Most, but not all, of the sherds showing these impressions are of a heavy coarse ware of a grayish white or light tan tone and of a rather chalky con- sistency, and the greater number of those from San- tarem and Lago Grande appear to have been parts of large vessels. Along with these base fragments in the Pennsylvania collection are a large number of rim and body sherds but not sufficiently related to each other for the reconstruction of a vessel. These sherds are thick, suggestion of paint is rare, but there is a considerable amount of line decoration, mostly straight, made by a broad, blunt instrument. These wares in no way suggest Tapaj6 origin. Hartt states that vessels found at Taperhina, east of Santarem, often display basketry impressions.57 1. P1. 23-c. The base of a rather small vessel. So far the only example from this area. (Belterra.) 2. PI. 85-g.

A Ware Having a Rough Surface and Geometrical Decoration In large collections from Santarem and vicinity there is usually a variety of wares, although that of 57 Hartt, 1885: 73. the Tapajo is always conspicuously predominant. A ware which is often quite prominent is one which is characterized by a rough surface and an engraved decoration which is formally, yet beautifully, geomet- rical, but which is entirely different in decorative spirit from engraved ornament on Tapajo pottery. Typical examples of this ware are figured on pl. 84. Some of these pieces came from Lago Grande, some from the vicinity of Santarem. This ware appears also on the Trombetas, a northern tributary of the Amazon which enters it at no great distance from the mouth of the Tapajos. Sometimes specimens of this ware display evidence of red or white paint; sometimes they are unpainted. At my request, Mr. A. Eric Parkinson, the chemist for the University Museum, very kindly made a com- parative microscopic study of a rim sherd which is typically Tapajo in both surfacing and decoration (pl. 78-h) and of the rim sherd (pl. 84-f) which is typical in both surfacing and decoration of the unknown ware. His report is as follows: The Tapaj6 specimen is smooth to the touch, the non- Tapaj6 rough. Even under the microscope the Tapaj6 ap- peared to be fairly uniform in texture and the surface fairly even. The texture of the non-Tapajo was also fairly uniform, but it contained many inclusions like worn sand grains and the surface seemed to be covered with linear indentations disposed haphazardly in all directions. On probing into the surface it was found that these were not indentations, but long, slightly curved, colorless crystals. Mr. Albert Jehle, whom I consulted because of his mineral- ogical experience, remarked, without knowing that fresh- water sponges were used for tempering among these Indian potters, that these crystals looked like sponge spicules, which often are almost pure silica. Under high power it was revealed that the Tapajo sherd also contained these "banana-shaped" crystals, but in the Tapaj6 they were smaller and much less numerous than in the non-Tapajo. Scrapings from the interior of the Tapaj6 showed a few "banana-shaped" crystals, while scrapings from the interior of the non-Tapaj6 ware were full of them, so much so that they formed a thick mat. Apparently, there was a much greater use of sponge and other siliceous material for tempering in the non- Tapajo than in the Tapajo. After the publication of my original Tapajo study, Mr. Nimuendaju wrote me that the rim adorno, pres- ently illustrated as fig. 6-a, appeared to him to have come from an area in Santarem known as Montenegro where a dairy was located. For purpose of comparison he referred me to pl. XXXVI-e, g of Nordenski6ld's Ars Americana, figuring pieces which actually came from that site. The style and surface appeared the same. This rim sherd is gray-white in tone and rough of surface; microscopic examination showed that it contained a high percentage of sponge spicules. With this sherd as a clue, it would appear that all this rough ware, because of both its design and composi- tion, might have been produced by the habitants of the Montenegro site. Mr. Nimuendajui further stated that pottery from the Montenegro site closely resembles 64</page><page sequence="66">THE ARCHAEOLOGY that of the Lago de Silves area of the Rio Urubuf,58 a northern tributary of the Amazon to the west. The Montenegro site was discussed in the section on sites. a. Rims, Solid Forms 1. P1. 84-b, d. Specimens decorated by curvilinear engraved lines. (Santarem.) 2. P1. 84-g.

That the makers of this unknown ware were familiar with Tapaj6 ceramic processes is clear from the fact that this sherd is hollow and the technique is excellent.

Wares Decorated in the Konduri Tradition The peoples Nimuendaju classified as Konduri lived on both shores of the Amazon. On the southern bank he found sites west of Santarem (see site map). On the northern shore their remains are found along the river banks, on the serras, but preponderantly along the borders of the lakes of the terra firma,59 in the Trombetas-Nhamunda area. So conspicuous are these lakeside sites that Frei Protfasio Frickel, O.F.M., who has done extensive research in this area, has designated the decorative tradition of these peoples as "style of the lakes." 60 However, material which seems to be of Konduri origin appears with considerable frequency in both Santarem and Lago Grande collections. Concerning the Trombetas peoples Heriarte gives us the following information: The Trombetas was peopled by several nations- Conduris, Bobuis, Aroases, Tabaos, Curiatos and "many others." Neither the men nor the women wore any clothing whatsoever. There were many kinds of fish in the area as well as a supply of tartaruga (marine turtle) and peixe-boi (manatee). More manioc was used on the Trombetas than on the Tapajos. Wild rice, also, was plentiful, and from this the natives brewed a wine which they traded to other tribes. The hunting was good. The weapons were bows and arrows. There is no reference to arrow poison. There was much fine clay in the area from which the tribes made beautiful pottery, esteemed by the Portuguese and used for trade with other tribes. The Rio Trombetas was so named by the Portuguese because of the great number of trumpets used by the natives in their ceremonies and drinking festivities. It was a land of very large lakes.61 Betendorf refers to the Trombetas only rarely and with little detail. He states that a missionary died there and that the natives accorded him appropriate burial.62 He mentions having stopped there to pay a visit to the natives, but the chief had gone away and the village was temporarily deserted. There was no church and he said Mass to a few Whites on the open river beach. He praised the beauty of the valley with its lakes and hills. His comment concerning the Konduri was that they were a "continuously diverted" people. The Whites gave him some beautiful birds called araras.63 59 In contrast to those of the flood plain. 60 Hilbert, 1955: 13, 19. 61 Heriarte, 1847: 38 ff. 62 Betendorf, 1910: 117 ff. 63 Ibid., 499. 65 VOL. 50, PT. 3, 1960]</page><page sequence="67">PALMATARY: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE LOWER TAPAJOS [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. The post-European story of the tribes in the Trombetas-Nhamunda area is quite similar to that of the Tapajos peoples. In both cases several tribes were apparently more or less closely associated with much the same customs. Then came the white man with his slave-hunting expeditions and his efforts to re-locate and re-educate the native peoples. The result was ultimate tribal destruction or, at least, disintegration- groups fleeing into the interior in their attempt to escape captivity or, greatly reduced in numbers, losing their identity by mingling with neighboring tribes.64 Our knowledge of Konduri form and decorative style is limited mostly to sherds; the number of known Konduri vessels from the Trombetas is very limited. Some Konduri-type sherds found in the Tapaj6s area seem to be smoother in texture than others and often the ornament seems to display some Tapajo influence. Konduri decoration is characterized by numerous pits, sometimes small, sometimes large, but usually proportionately deep. The eye is of the doughnut type, occasionally a little elongated, or of the simple or pitted bulge. Incised lines, straight and parallel or rectilinear and often quite deep, and also short parallel gashes are conspicuous in the design. Adornos are grotesque in the extreme. Hilbert emphasizes the large amount of cauixi (river sponge) which characterizes the composition of the Konduri pottery and states that in a small percent- age of cases sand was used as a tempering agent.65 A letter from Curt Nimuendaju' stated that Konduri sites which he had excavated usually contained many "finger-shaped" sherds, apparently vessel supports. He mentioned also that a characteristic of Konduri face representation is a protruding mouth. He emphasized that he had never found any burial urns in Konduri sites and therefore suspected that this tribe disposed of its dead in the same manner as did the Tapajo-ground up the bones and placed the powder in the beverages or, in rare cases, mummified the body.66 a. Rim and Body Sherds 1. PI. 85-j. Decorated with a series of close pits arranged in vertical rows and divided from similar series by plain horizontal bands. Smooth rim, having a band in relief below it. Unpainted. (Santarem.) 2. Pls. 86-c, 88-a. Both are decorated in Konduri tradition; the body sherd is from the Tapaj6s, the rim sherd from the Trombetas. An interesting point of similarity is the series of radiating incisions which surrounds the eye- like decoration on both.

Two views of an interesting piece from the Trom- betas. It seems to be almost a caricature of a seated anthropomorphic figure with hands partly clasped be- fore the mouth. The representation of the hair in the rear view suggests an elongated zoomorphic form, the head at the neck of the figure. However, Ladislau 67 Hilbert, 1955: 41, 43. 66</page><page sequence="68">THE ARCHAEOLOGY Netto figures the headdress of a Jivaro chieftain to which a shrunken head with long hair is appended in similar fashion.68 (Oriximina.) 9.

P1. 86-d. An interesting piece from the Konduri area north of the Amazon. The eye form and the pits are char- acteristic of Konduri decoration, but the handle sug- gests a stylization of the hands-to-face motif of the Tapajo. (Cocal.) 3. P1. 89-a. An unusual piece decorated by engraved parallel horizontal lines crossed by engraved parallel oblique lines. The upper edge is pitted. (Oriximina.) d. Supports 1. P1. 76-c, e. In the Lower Tapaj6s collection at the University Museum there are not more than six or seven pieces which could be interpreted as feet. The most highly developed specimens are the two figured. Such forms would be atypical for Tapajo design; any suggestion of the true tripod is rare in that culture. I think these may be fragments of Konduri trade vessels from areas west of Lago Grande on the south bank of the Amazon, where Konduri sites have been located, or from the Trombetas-Nhamunda area on the Amazon's northern shore. Hilbert shows several similar pieces from the latter region.69 No doubt these are related to the "finger-shaped" pieces found by Nimuendaju and previously discussed. (Lago Grande. ) e. Vessels 1. P1. 85-k. A miniature vessel, rather crudely constructed. Rows of pits vertically placed are divided into three sur- rounding bands by three simple horizontal incisions made with a dull instrument. Pitted around the mouth. Unpainted. (Santarem.) 2. P1. 86-f. The body is decorated by pitted triangular sections alternately placed, below which are two roughly incised bands in relief. Upper edge is similarly incised. The handles are crudely zoomorphic. Unpainted. (San- tarem.) 68 Netto, 1885: 323. 69 Hilbert, 1955: 45, figs. 13, 14, 15. 3. P1. 87-a. The general form is similar to that of many Tapaj6 pieces, but the band around the mouth is character- istically Konduri in design-diagonal engraved lines arranged at alternate angles, a grotesque face with a pitted surface and doughnut-form impressed eyes. (Oriximina.) 4. P1. 90-a, b, c. A fine piece. Probably a highly stylized turtle repre- sentation. Shows at best the Konduri pitted-scallop motif, and also figures groups of diagonally engraved lines alternately arranged. (Oriximina.) 5. P1. 11-b. This piece has been described previously under Tapajo wares, but it is of interest here because, while its form is characteristically Tapajo, its decoration is definitely Konduri, suggesting close cultural relations between the tribes. (Santarem.) Hilbert has made the following distinctions between Santarem and Konduri wares with regard to both composition and design: 70 1. S. A moderate amount of cauixi employed for tempering. K. An abundant amount of cauixi employed. 2. S. Pottery has hardness between 3 and 4. K. Pottery has hardness between 2 and 3. 3. S. Relatively few incisions in adornos and handles. K. Tendency to decorate adornos and handles with a profusion of punctates, incisions and gouges. 4. S. Adornos and handles are affixed by means of roughened furrows. K. Simple affixation without roughened areas. 5. S. Numerous caryatids. K. No caryatids. 6. S. Tripods rare. K. An abundance of tripod feet. 7. S. Hollow rims. K. No hollow rims. 8. S. No handles which extend over the mouth of the vessel. K. Handles which extend over the mouth of the vessel. 9. S. Elbow pipes with neo-Brazilian decoration. K. Pipes rare and evidently obtained by trade. 10. S. Both rectilinear and curvilinear decoration on walls of vessels. K. Rectilinear engraved design only. 11. S. Various colors well affixed. K. Color is rare and easily removable. Type XXV. Pipes To one-half of the world, tobacco and its uses date from Columbus but, no doubt, in the aboriginal Amer- icas, smoking, snuffing, chewing, pill-making, and other 70 Ibid., 73. VOL. 50, PT. 3, 1960] 67</page><page sequence="69">PALMATARY: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE LOWER TAPAJOS [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. forms of tobacco utilization were old customs when the white man arrived. With regard to smoking, West comments: The fact that the general ceremony of smoking is similar in points at a great distance apart seems to warrant the conclusion that the custom is one of great antiquity.71 Referring to North American pipes, this author points out that, in spite of the extended period over which tobacco has been in use, the tools for smoking it have shown no fundamental change in form that can be regarded as improvements-essentially the types are the tube, the bent tube, and the bowl pipe. The advancement displayed in archaeological specimens has been not in the form of the pipe but in its embellish- ment.72 Such a statement would be equally true were it referring to pipes found in South American sites. Authorities are not in complete agreement regarding the origin of the word "tobacco." McGuire states: "Tabaco," according to Oviedo, was a certain instrument of wood or cane made in the manner of a Greek Y, of which the Indians accommodate the two upper canes to the openings of the nose for the inhalation of smoke of a plant which they call cahiba or cajiba, which is also called today by the name of the instrument ....73 Mason tell us: In the West Indies tobacco was employed in the form of a cigar-dried leaves rolled in a larger leaf. This custom obtained through most of north-central South America. The native peoples of the Antilles are now extinct, al- though the cigar still remains the favorite smoke of that region, but in South America many tribes exist in their origional state of culture who take their tobacco in the form of cigars. This author further states that no smoking pipes were used by the ancient West Indians and that it was the cigars, and not the leaf of which they were constituted, that these peoples referred to as tabacos.74 The Brazilian name for tobacco was petun, a word of Tupi origin. The Portuguese called tobacco erba santa croce.75 As yet we known little of the tobacco habits of the ancient Indians of the Lower Amazon. In Marajo collections there is little suggestion of aboriginal pipe- smoking, although two very simple tubular pipes have been reported 75a from the Mangueiras Phase of the Is- land's culture. However, the peoples who made Mara- jo's remarkable pottery may have used cigars, or cigarettes, or cane pipes, or snuffing tubes which have disintegrated over the years. There is a fair amount of evidence, based upon pottery form and design, that in the pre-Columbian 71 West, 1934: 1: 91. 72 Ibid., 125. 73 McGuire, 1897: 401. 74 Mason, 1924: 3. 75West, 1934: 1: 32 ff. 75a Meggers and Evans, 1957: fig. 197. period some of the West Indies were culturally related to Marajo Island and to the Brazilian Guianan main- land to the north of it.7? It, therefore, seems possible that, before the coming of the Europeans, similar uses of tobacco may have extended from the West Indies to the eastern terminus of the Amazon. The Marajo potters had vanished long before the coming of the Portuguese. Barata remarks upon the fact that although Beten- dorf, shortly after the Conquest, makes mention of the "plantaojes de fumo" in the "Rios do Amazonas," no reference is made anywhere to the use of cigars or pipes by the primitive Indians anywhere in "the Valley." This is in contrast to the frequent mention of tobacco and its uses by the missionaries among the Tupinamba.77 Mason states: The "elbow pipes" of Mexico are . . . not typical of this region. This type is, however, the characteristic form of smoking implement in use in eastern and south-central South America, in eastern and southern Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Northern Argentina. Pottery pipes of pre- Columbian times are frequently found in these regions, though probably then, as at present, the usual type was made of wood .... While smoking was in pre-Columbian times, as at present, the favorite method of taking tobacco, yet chew- ing and snuffing tobacco and licking and drinking decoc- tions of it were also practiced, sometimes in place of smoking and sometimes in conjunction with it ... Both of these customs were, and are, in aboriginal America primarily associated with vegetable products other than tobacco. The tobacco-chewing area is in western South America near the Andes, and is doubtless related to the more characteristic coca-chewing of the Andean highlands. The snuffing habit is widespread over most of the Andean area and the West Indies. However, the snuff taken throughout this area is more frequently made from other plants than tobacco. In the western part of the Amazonian forests, near the foot of the Andes, smoking is unknown, but instead tobacco is licked or, at times, chewed.78 Since bowl pipes have not been found in any of the Amazonian pre-Cabralian cultures so far discovered by the archaeologist, the problem presents itself whether or not the Portuguese, who established themselves in the Amazon Valley rather late in Brazilian history and who were familiar with smoking customs before they arrived, were not, at least, the principal bearers of the bowl pipe into the Rio Tapajos and neighboring areas.79 It was Nimuendaju, during his excavations in 1923, who unearthed the first bowl pipes scattered among other pottery in the terras pretas of Santarem and Alter do Chao.80 However, the European invaders of Amazonia may have been familiar with pipe-smoking before their American adventure. The report is that Andre Thevet 76Palmatary, 1950: correlation chart. 77Barata, 1951: 183. 78Mason, 1924: 10 ff. 79Barata, 1951: 192. 80Linne, 1928: 83. 68</page><page sequence="70">THE ARCHAEOLOGY carried the Brazilian petun to Portugal in 1557 81 and that the French ambassador to the Portuguese Court, Jean Nicot, sent seeds of the plant to Catherine de Medici about 1559. According to Nadaillac the tobacco plant was introduced into Spain in 1518 and seemingly traffic in tobacco was carried on by both Spain and France at an early date. Sir John Hawkins, according to Edmund Howes, brought tobacco to England in 1565.82 West states: ..As to the date of the first manufacture of the Clay Pipes in England, Llewllynn Jewitt wrote: "In the neighborhood of Bath (England) pipes were apparently made in the beginning of the seventeenth century, and some of the examples bear a shield with a branch of the tobacco plant." Many early Clay Pipes have been found in and about England. Early Clay Pipes have been brought to light in various parts of London, often as much as a dozen feet below the surface and, owing to their extreme smallness, the opinion prevailed among the common people that they were pipes of fairies ....These pipes were plain or modeled to commemorate important events or to immortal- ize great men. Within a short time the French and the Dutch were competing with the English in the manufacture of Clay Pipes .... During the Seventeenth Century, the English, French and Dutch made large quantities of Clay Pipes which were used in trade with the Indians. These pipes differed in size and ornamentation. During the time of James I, pipes were made with a small bowl, probably due to restrictive laws, and the then popular belief in the great medical virtues of tobacco, causing it to command a fabu- lous price. Styles of trademarks, symbols and ornamenta- tion of Trade Pipes are too numerous to mention. ....83 All the Amazonian pipes I have seen are small in comparison with the size of the pipe-bowl in use today. The Dutch, the French, the British, as well as the Portuguese, were active on the eastern coast of Brazil during the period of its conquest and settlement. In some areas the evidence seems to be that, after the white man adopted the custom of pipe-smoking, he popularized it among native groups in which it had not previously been common. As an example, McGuire states that in the tens of thousands of acres covered by shell village sites on the Chesapeake Bay shores of Maryland and Virginia, he knows of only two primitive pipes having been found, while European trade pipes are not uncommon in the same area. . . . The writer inclines, therefore, to the belief that while smoking was probably indulged in, it was but to a limited extent until the whites, by the cultivation of tobacco, popularized its use.84 It would seem that in South, as well as North, America the Whites may have been an active factor in the introduction or increased use of the bowl pipe. 81 Spinden, 1950: 37. 82West, 1934: 1: 33 ff. 83Ibid., 1: 326 ff. 84 McGuire, 1897: 412 ff. However, concerning early smoking experiences among Europeans, Mason remarks: ... It must be remembered that the custom was a new one to the Spaniards and one for which a descriptive termin- ology had not yet become current. Thus the oldest ac- counts frequently employ such terms as "swallow" and "drink" in attempting to describe the new and unaccustomed practice.85 Curt Nimuendaju's finding of a few pipes at San- tarem in 1923 first called attention to the use of pipes in this area. Since then a large number of pipes, some very simple, some very ornate, have been re- covered from the Tapajos Valley and from neighboring Amazonian sites. Certain of these were possibly pre- Portuguese, or at least Indian; however, many were undoubtedly post-European and display a decorative tradition unlike that of the Amazonian native. Barata based his excellent study of the Cachimbos de Santarem upon one hundred and eighty-six speci- mens and many more have been recovered since he wrote. Most of the pipes he described came from the Aldeia section of Santarem. He remarks that the soil of this area has been turned over again and again by successive generations of both Indians and caboclos, and that therefore there is no way of estimating, on a stratigraphical basis, the age of anything recovered from it; and that scientific study is further obstructed by the fact that the complete history of a pipe is not always obtainable. Since seemingly the clay composition and the firing technique for the pipes was often the same as that for the Tapajo vessels, judgment with regard to whether the fabricant was Indian or White must be based upon design.86 A point to note is that many of the pipes from Santarem and vicinity display vegetable motifs featuring long undulating stems, curving tendrils and budlike forms. The Amazonian Indian, for some reason, was never inspired by the wonders and beauties of the vegetable world; his design was based upon geometrical and zoomorphic motifs. Thus, where floral forms are suggested, European influence becomes apparent. Barata believes that the missionaries, themselves, may have contributed to the pipe-making industry in the Santarem area, since among them were some "veritable artists," and that they may have had the assistance of "disciples." 87 However, a point to be taken into consideration in judging these pipes is that neither all the Indians nor all the Europeans who indulged in pipe-making were equally skilful as sculptors, and it is the design, rather than its execution, that suggests origin. The following classification is purposely a loose one, the information is too fragmentary and the specimens 85 Mason, 1924: 7. 86 Barata, 1951: 184 ff. 87 Ibid., 190 ff.

However, a few general types seem relatively clearly defined. A. Tubular Stone Pipes 1. P1. 93-d. The workmanship of this piece is excellent but the pipe is not Tapajo in either form or design. Although there is an abundance of stone in the Tapaj6s Valley, this is the only stone tubular pipe and, in fact, the only tubular pipe in the collections studied. It is not complete, the section nearest the mouth is missing, but it is of interest in that it suggests trade connection, direct or indirect, with an area where the stone tubular pipe was manufactured. The decoration represents a human form in relief. The shoulders and arms are represented by a scroll terminating in hands which hold something between them, possibly a handle. The upper section is separated from the face by a groove producing the effect of a headdress; from this, in the back, is appended what appears to be long cords. On the complete end the diameter of the pipe is 3.5 cm., that of the bore 2.3 cm.; at the broken end the overall diameter is 3.6 cm., that of the bore 1.7 cm.; greatest length 7.2 cm. (San- tarem.) The straight tube is considered the most primitive form of smoking pipe. In North America its dis- tribution covers the greater part of the United States and Canada. California is more prolific in aboriginal stone pipes than is any other area.88 In South America tubular pipes of cane or bamboo were the prototypes of those of stone and clay. . . . Erland von Nordenski6ld published in Globus in 1908, an article on smoking which emphasized the priority of the tubular pipe in South America. His evidence, especially strong for the region of the Putumayo River, in Paraguay and northern Argentina, is now supported in other parts of South America ... Archaeological investigations along the southern coast of Brazil revealed an early use of tubular clay pipes and a later post-European use of bowl pipes. Tubular pipes survive today among tribes of Central Brazil residing near the Araguaya River. There is good reason, then, to accept the hypothesis of diffusion in tobacco smoking in which the first apparatus was the straight tubular pipe, either a cane or an object of stone or pottery made in imitation of cane. Perhaps the diffusion went both ways from Central America, for tubular pipes have extended from Canada to Chile.89 Tubular pipes of both wood and clay have been re- ported from the State of Bahia.90 From his examination of the sambaqui Ponta do Jauari, Lago Grande do Curua, west of Alenquer, Frei Protasio Frickel obtained, in 1939 and 1941, five com- 88 West, 1934: 1: 131 ff. 89 Spinden, 1950: 20 ff. 90 Ott, 1944: fig. 36. plete tubular pipes and fragments of twenty-one others. Some of these specimens were without ornament but others were rather attractively decorated. Hilbert ex- presses some doubt as to whether these tubular forms were true pipes or whether they might have been used merely as cigar holders.91 Thus, as excavations con- tinue, we may have to modify our present conception regarding the uses of tobacco in ancient Amazonia. B. Clay Pipes Having a Double Bowl 1. P1. 91-b. Barata states that this pipe consists of two bowls linked to a single canal.92 This form must be rare. West figures a rather ornate wooden pipe with two distinct bowls, a product of the Chamacoco Indians of Paraguay,93 but a closer approximation is a double- bowl specimen of pottery from Wisconsin. The text states that this ... is a double-bowled rectangular pipe formerly owned by Black Hawk, a subordinate chief of the Sauk and Fox Indians and a leader in the Black Hawk War of 1832. One of his descendants explains that one of the pipe bowls was in honor of the Sauk and the other of the Fox Indians.94 It seems that the double bowl of the Brazilian pipe may also have had some peculiar significance. C. Clay Pipes Having a Single Bowl I did not personally examine all of the Brazilian pipes to be described, Dr. Frederico Barata having kindly supplied me with a number of photographs for this publication. I, therefore, have been dependent to a considerable extent upon his descriptions. He states that the greater part of the pipes found around Santarem are crudely constructed and probably of late date. A point that he emphasizes is the divisional unit between the two sides of many of the pipes and he suggests that such pipes were probably made in two halves and then joined, or that the halves might have been separated while the clay was still soft to facilitate the shaping of the inside of the bowl and the canal into the stem end. No molds have ever been found in Amazonia for pipes or any other ceramic form, and no two pipes have been found which are of exactly the same size or form. An indication that some of these pipes may be of late date is that clays of various colors have been employed in their manufacture, and that their com- position contains little or no evidence of sponge spicules or other tempering material.95 91 Hilbert, 1959: 8 ff. 92 Barata, 1951: fig. 39. 93West, 1934: 2: 955 and pl. 238, fig. 7. 94Ibid. 1: 295; 2: 920 and pl. 220, fig. 7. 95Barata, 1951: 194. 70</page><page sequence="72">THE ARCHAEOLOGY I.

The decoration on opposite sides is divided by a distinct ridge; on either side of the bowl is a little "rosette" consisting of six small nodules.96 (Santarem.) 2. P1. 92-c. A crude form, probably not of Indian origin, deco- rated by perpendicular bands in relief around the mouth and a "rosette" of six nodules on either side.97 Nodular decoration, such as appears on this piece and on e on the same plate, though not in "rosette" form, is a fairly common type of ornament on pipes found in the Southern Mounds of the United States.98 (Santarem.) 3.

The band in relief suggests European influence, but cross-hatching has been reported from the north bank of the Amazon. (Santarem.) 12. P1. 96-d. This piece displays a native touch. Viewed from the front, the decoration suggests a face; the central pro- trusion, a nose; the curved relief, observed from this profile view, the eyebrow; the button-like form beneath, the eye. The larger nodule on the side is in ear posi- tion. Both in Marajo and Tapajo ceramics motifs are frequently arranged to suggest faces.

In North America, over a vast area east of the Mississippi and extending from Wisconsin to Kentucky, handle-pipes of stone form a conspicuous part of the archaeology.102 In the Southwest, handle-pipes of clay have been found.103 The clay pipes of the Lower Mississippi sometimes have two stabilizing projections beneath the bowl.104 Many of the European trade pipes had small handles or stabilizing elements.105 102 West, 1934: 1: 216. 10 Ibid. 2: pl. 224, figs. 1, 4. 104 Ibid. 2: pl. 226, figs. 2, 3, 8. 105 Ibid. 2: pls. 154, 155, 156, 157; McGuire, 1897: figs. 72, 74, 75, 76.

In North America the handle was a highly developed feature, especially in the stone pipe; on the Amazon, however, the handles are sometimes quite rudimentary and, where they are in definitely serviceable form, often appear more European than Indian. In reality, in the cruder forms of the Amazonian pipes, the "handle," though functionally useful, is merely the pressed extension of the clay used in the joining of the two halves, or of the clay of the bowl itself. On the better forms the handle is a designed element carefully sculptured. 1. P1. 91-a. A form in which the handle is perforated.

Richly Decorated Pipes Many of the pipes which are found at Santarem and in neighboring areas are clearly not of Indian origin. Instead they display a distinctly foreign tradition sug- gesting frequently the rich ornament on or within European ecclesiastical buildings of the not-too-remote era when beauty, and not time, was still the determining factor in their decoration. The Jesuit missionary venture in Brazil was a highly organized one. It was prepared not merely to offer to the natives of this newly found land the message of Christianity, but to supply the skills necessary to build and to maintain its own religious establishments, as well as to teach the Indian the arts, crafts and technical know-how of the European of that period. Thus the Jesuit communities consisted not merely of adminis- trators and teachers of the Faith, but of Brothers who were cooks and tailors, shoemakers and agriculturists, stone-masons, iron-workers, carpenters, pharmacists. Also within the communities were wood-carvers and painters for the decoration of the churches which were slowly rising at widely scattered points over a vast area.108 To Barata many of these pipe designs suggest the Portuguese baroque, exhibiting as they do beautiful designs of vegetable origin-among them the rosette so common in Portuguese art of the colonial period and conspicuous in silver, furniture, and architectural de- signs. He believes that many of these pipes were made by the missionaries themselves, since among them were some veritable artists; no doubt, however, some may have been made by Indian "disciples" from European designs. Judging from appearances alone, the clay mixture and the firing process used for the pipes were the same as the Tapaj6 Indians employed in the manufacture of their vessels.109 1. P1. 96-f.

STONE THE STONE SUPPLY OF THE TAPAJOS VALLEY In examining archaeological collections from the Tapajos Valley, one is often impressed by the con- siderable number of lithic specimens they contain. These artifacts vary widely in form and material and the craftsmanship they represent is usually excellent. In contrast to Marajo Island which has no native stone suitable for durable objects, the Tapaj6s Valley con- tains a supply rich not only in quantity, but in quality and variety as well. In 1870 Charles Frederick Hartt explored the Tapajos Valley from the cachoeira of the Apuim, about twenty-five miles above Itaituba, to the Amazon. In a short report in which he summarizes the results of this expedition he emphasizes, as all other writers have done, the unusual beauty of the Valley and the stony ruggedness of its shores. He refers to "immense dykes" of porphyry and trap; "very fine-grained, com- 113 Ryden, 1955: 262. pact heavy rock . . . of a dark gray or chocolate color, full of minute green grains"; quartz and quartzite; red and white sandstone; shale, white, greenish, red, leaden blue and black in color; dark brown ferruginous dolomitic rock; ironstone; limestone of dark blue and other tints; white and greenish siliceous rocks. There are other references also.' Thus, Hartt gives us some idea of the lithic richness of the Tapajos Valley. Such wealth of stone no doubt encouraged, among the Tapajo and neighboring tribes, the manufacture of implements, amulets, and other artifacts, and the durability of stone made it possible to pass on these objects from generation to generation, adding to the cultural richness of the tribes of the area.

A. Spindle Whorls 1. P1. 104-a to d, f to h, 105-a to c. In contrast to the archaeology of Marajo Island which, so far, has produced only a very limited number of spindle whorls, there are numerous specimens of this implement in the archaeology of Santarem and vicinity. Most of these pieces are carefully fashioned, ranging in diameter from two to eight centimeters; many are engraved, occasionally with a design of some merit. The number of these whorls would suggest a rather active textile industry among the Tapajo. I have never seen a textile impression on any vessel from Marajo Island; however, from the Tapajos Valley sherds of the larger, coarser vessels frequently show basketry impressions; cloth impressions, nevertheless, are very rare. Judging from the numerous figurines from the Lower Tapaj6s, its native people wore little clothing. It is possible, however, that their tangas were woven; also, perhaps, were the decorative bands which they wore around their heads.

Muiraquitas In Brazil the term muiraquitd is used rather generally to refer to little ornaments of jade and other stone which have been found archaeologically and which are designed for suspension. If such pieces are of greenish tint, they are popularly known as pedras-verdes. In this report, however, I am accepting Barata's classifica- tion and limiting the term muiraquita to batrachian forms of either stone or clay that have peculiar back and side perforations for attachment to a cord. The legend of the muiraquita is one facet of the Amazon story as it developed from Carvajal's chronicle of the famous expedition of Orellana from the Andes to the Atlantic in 1542. According to the record, the Span- iards were attacked, somewhat west of the mouth of the Trombetas, by Indians under the leadership of warrior women. Orellana, without bothering to inquire the tribal name of these supposed female warriors, be- stowed upon them that of "Amazons." Thus the great east-west fluvial highway received its modern name.2 A century later, in 1639, there was another important descent from the Andes to the Atlantic coast. This time it was Pedro Teixeira returning from Quito to Para. His chronicler was Cristoval de Acufia. By this time the story of the warrior women was well known in the west, and Acufia collected additional lore as he journeyed down stream. His principal informants, however, were the natives of "the last village of the 2 Medina, 1934: 212 ff.

Tupinambas," some thirty-seven leagues from the mouth of the river upon which the Amazons were supposed to have lived. The name of the river was that "of the Cunuris" (probably Conduris),3 later named Nhamunda (Jamunda, Yamunda).4 The villages of the Amazons were, supposedly, among the high forested hills of this river. It was reported that no man lived permanently among the warrior women, but that men of a neighbor- ing tribe were received by them once each year. The female children born of this visit were retained by their mothers, the males supposedly were killed or returned to their fathers.5 While in Guiana, Sir Walter Raleigh heard of the Amazons and made diligent inquiry concerning them. He wrote: They are said to be very cruel and bloodthirsty, especially to such as offer to invade their territories. These Amazons have likewise plates of gold, which they recover by ex- change for a kind of green stones, which the Spaniards call Piedras hijadas and we use for spleen stones; and for diseases of the stone we also esteem them. Of these I saw divers in Guiana, and commonly every cacique hath one, which their wives for the most part wear, and they esteem them as great jewels. Raleigh states that these "green stones" together with plates of gold were used by the Indians to redeem an important captive from the Europeans and that, on one occasion, he and his Indian guide were presented with "spleen stones" and provisions by "the lords of the country." 6 In no instance does Raleigh describe the form of the green stones or refer to them by their Indian name.7 The legend of the women without husbands was known on Espafiola. In the Antillean version of the story these women lived on Matinino6, "the golden island beyond the Caribs." 8 Barata believes that the Indian name for this peculiar amulet, or perhaps insigne, is of Tupi origin and did not come into general use until the nineteenth century, its 3 For geographical details see Hilbert, 1955: 1 ff. 4 Rodrigues states that Jamunda was the name of a Uaboi Chieftain. 1875 (1): 22. 5Markham, trans. and ed., 1859: 121 ff. (Similar tales were told of the Amazons of Greek legend.) 6 Raleigh in Payne, ed. 1880: 346 ff.; Leonardas, 1938 (2), notes several references in early Brazilian literature to gold among tribes in northern Amazonia, especially in the Upper Rio Negro Valley. 7 Although jade, to us, is primarily associated with China and the Orient, yet it is from Mexico that the name "jade," now used alike in English, German, French, and Spanish, originally was adopted. Unfamiliar with the stone and informed of its supposed marvelous curative properties, the Spanish Conquistadores spoke of it as "piedra de ijada" or "colic stone" (ijada, "loin or flank"). The word has, of course, come through the French modification of ijada: jade. The same belief in the therapeutic value of jade is found in the name for one of its varieties, nephrite, from Greek, through Latin lapis nephriticus, "kidney stone." Mason, 1927: 50. 8 Loven, 1935: 43, 53. present form having been a gradual development from various spellings employed by the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century scientists and missionaries who, hearing the name of these ornaments from the natives, recorded it as it sounded to them individually. He continues: It is in the manuscript of Mauricio de Heriarte (1662) that we encounter the word for the first time, spelled in two forms: baraquitas and buraquitan. Later, in 1759, we see Padre Jose de Moraes write puuraquitan and, in 1762- 1763, the bishop Frei Joao de S. Josd de Queiroz, re- corded uuraquitan. . . . Previously none of the chroniclers had even mentioned pedras-verdes. ... The actual form muiraquita, slightly modified, made its first appearance, as far as we are able to verify, in 1873 in the book "Lembrangas e Curiosidades de Valle do Ama- zonas" by C6nego Francisco Bernardino de Souza, fre- quently repeated as mueraquitan. . ..9 The tale Bernardino de Souza tells is as follows: 10 The Indians say that near the headwaters of the famous Nhamunda (or Jamunda) there exists a beauti- ful lake called Yaci-uarua which means "Mirror of the Moon." This lake is sacred to the moon. At a certain season of the year and phase of the moon, the Icamiabas, or women without husbands (Amazons), celebrate a festival dedicated to the moon and to the Mother of the Mueraquitan who lives in the lake. After purifying themselves-for this is an expiatory ceremony-the Icamiabas plunge into Yaci-uarua when its waters are smooth and tranquil, reflecting the pale light of the moon. From the Mother of the Mueraquitan the Icamiabas then receive a stone fashioned in such form as they desire; when brought to the light of the sun, this stone becomes so hard that it is impossible to change it into any other form. To the men of the tribe favored by the Icamiabas these stones are distributed when they come to visit them at certain seasons of the year. To these stones is attributed great power over evil, and even today the Indians consider them precious talismans. There are several variations of this story in the literature. One is that the muiraquitas were alive and that it was necessary for the Amazons to wound them- selves and drop a little blood on the forms they desired. Then the muiraquitas ceased to move and were easily seized. Another is that the muiraquitas were formed under water of a soft clay found on the beds of streams, and that this clay became hard when exposed to the air."1 Rodrigues states that the tribal name Icamiaba is an abbreviation of Itacamiaba, a Tupi word, which can be translated "gift of stone from the woodland." He calls attention to the fact that, in 1542, when Orellana 9 Barata, 1954: 230 ff. 10 Bernardino de Souza, 1873: 99. 1 Rodrigues, 1875 (1): 35, 54. 76</page><page sequence="78">THE ARCHAEOLOGY descended the Amazon, the lingua geral was not spoken in that area. Thus the name which appears in the literature today was not the actual name of the supposed women warriors, but one which developed in the perpetuation of the Amazon legend.12 While the modern term muiraquitd seems, as Barata points out, to have first appeared in the published mythology of the Amazon in 1873, the belief in the magical powers of these artifacts was much older. Such belief still persists among certain elements of the present-day Brazilian population: ? . . the pedras-verdes of America have been used for the cure and prevention of various physical ills. . .for the bites of cobras, as well as for magical purposes. Even today, not only among the Indian population, but among the Brazilian people in general who know the artifact, there exists a belief in the magical powers of objects considered nmuiraquitds to bring happiness, love, health, and fulfillment of desires.13 Barata lists several interpretations of the word muiraquitd in the various forms in which it has been reported over a long period: knot of wood, stone of the chief, green stone of the river, money of the people. None appears to have real validity. He believes that the possession of muiraquitds could not have been limited to chiefs, since Heriarte stated that they were used to buy wives.14 In this connection Koehler- Asseburg remarks that, had the muiraquitd been used solely as a medium of exchange, the peculiar type of perforation which characterizes them would not have been necessary; he adds, however, that the fact that they were used to buy wives suggests that they represented considerable value.15 It should be noted that Heriarte's reference to the muiraquitd as one means of purchasing a wife was concerned not with the In- dians of the Tapajos-Trombetas area but with tribes in the east. He specifically states, however, that these pedras-verdes were sought in trade on the Tapaj6s along with other merchandise and that they were esteemed highly by "estrangeiros do norte"-probably Europeans on the northeast coast.16 Having made a detailed etymological and historical study of the word, Barata believes that itd means "toad" or "frog," a form presently used among the Tembe of Gurupi. Thus, although in Brazil today muiraquitd is a general term referring to pedras-verdes in various forms as well as to other stone ornaments, in his opinion, it should be applied only to batrachian forms. This author states: . . . muiraquitd (regardless of the spelling accorded it) relates to an epoch in which the lingua geral had become diffused throughout Amazonia. This should indicate that the name of the object did not emanate from its ancient fabricants, who were not Tupi, but from Indians who 12 Ibid., 33. 3 Koehler-Asseburg, 1951: 202. 4 Barata, 1954: 233. 5 Koehler-Asseburg, 1951: 211. 16 Heriarte, 1874: 19, 37. were possibly merely bearers of the tradition. All the chroniclers of the period making references to the muir- aquitds name the Tapaj6 as its possessors. It was among them who, beyond doubt, also spoke the lingua geral, that Heriarte, Jose de Moraes, and Fr. Joao de Sao Jose saw the pedras-verdes and heard, well or poorly, the name ap- plied to them in Tupi. Recent archaeological research demonstrates, however, that the Tapaj6 no longer used nephrite or jadeite in their stone work-not a single muiraquitd of this material was found in Santarem or the surrounding areas in circumstances that would prove local fabrication, as has occurred in the case of ornaments of other stone (popularly known as muiraquitds) which appeared here in quantity and, at times, incomplete and in different stages of manufacture.17 The inference that we draw from careful examination of historical documents, and by appropriately weighing the known facts, is that muiraquitd is a Tupi name given to these objects after the conquest of Amazonia, and that it is not in the least related to the ancient Indian conception of these specimens-which it may never be possible to deter- mine. We can assert, also, that the designation, today established, was at first employed only for artifacts of pedra-verde or nephrite, and only at the beginning of the nineteenth century was it generalized and made to include neck ornaments of other minerals and materials. . ..18 In this author's opinion the true muiraquitd dates from a remote pre-European period, and originally had a peculiar significance different from that of the Tapaj specimens which are being recovered today. These latter, nevertheless, by their form are reminiscent of this distant past. The Indian may have moved far from the source of the pedras-verdes or, over the years, he may have lost the technical skill to execute figures in the harder minerals. Thus the tradition endured in an attenuated form by the continuation of the batrachian design; however, clay was substituted for jade.19 Barbosa Rodrigues relates that, in Santarem, he heard from an old Tapajo woman known as "the last relic of her tribe," and to whom were attributed one hundred and twenty years, that when she was a child the "Tapuyas" (Tapajo) used to go each year to the Rio Nhamunda carrying products to trade for "these ornaments" which they regarded with religious super- stition. This old Indian was wearing a specimen suspended from her neck and could not be induced to part with it.20 This statement of the old Tapajo woman, together with other information concerning Tapajo trade to the north, reinforces the hypothesis that the Tapaj6 made only contas-ornaments having a single perforation and designed to be strung on a cord and worn as a necklace. These were not muiraquitds, although, at times, they might have had the same form. None of the chroniclers speaks of the fabrication of muiraquitds among the Tapajo; in fact Frei Joao de S. Jose de Queiroz (1762-63) stated that the Tapajo no longer knew the source of pedra-verde, supposedly a green 17 Barata, 1954: 235 ff. 18 Ibid., 241. 19 Ibid., 246. o0 Rodrigues, 1875 (1) : 53.

Barata believes that the contas were common and so attracted little attention, while the jade forms were a matter of interest because they were rare, held in much esteem, and associated with mystery and legend-thus the chroniclers noted them.21 Rodrigues, in his exploration of the Trombetas and Nhamunda Valleys, believed that he had located the ancient village sites of the legendary women warriors. These he found along the Amazon some eighteen miles above the mouth of the Trombetas which, historically, would be the general area in which Orellana is reported to have fought these women. He named the locality "Costa do Pariu" from a lake in the vicinity. He based his judgment for this discovery upon the fact that only here had he found the muiraquitd among pottery sherds, and here, too, were small chips of stone of which the muiraquitds apparently had been made. Rodrigues believed, also, that he had identified the sacred lake of the Mirror of the Moon (Yacy-uarua) in the Nhamunda Valley surrounded by forest-covered mountains. Here, also, the muiraquitd was found archaeologically. The other important site where, up to that time, the muiraquitd had been found archaeologically, though only rarely, was Lago Verde in Alter do Chao on the Tapajos.2 Several authors have expressed the belief that the "Amazons" whom Orellana fought were not all women but a tribe in which both men and women took part in battle. Rodrigues concurred in this opinion and further developed the theory that the Indians of the Rio Uaupes, at the period in which he was writing, might have been the descendants of the legendary women warriors. He based this supposition upon stories of their migrations, their mythology which included a sacred lake, their skill in fashioning stone ornaments similar to those found archaeologically on the Nha- munda,23 the fact that the men were rather feminine in appearance and wore their hair in braids held by combs, and also because the women accompanied the men in battle.24 Barbosa de Faria added a new element to the Amazon legend. During extensive archaeological investigation of the ancient Uaboi sites in the Lower Trombetas and Nhamunda Valleys, he heard in Faro the tradition that, before the "Amazons" left this area, they instructed the Uaboi in the fabrication of the muiraquiti. This tradition, this author remarked, failed to take into consideration the fact that no deposits of jade had yet been found in the Amazon Valley.25 21Barata, 1954: 242 ff. 22 Rodrigues, 1875 (1) : 7, 31 ff., 53. 23Ibid., 55 ff.; see also Coudreau, 1887: 205 ff. 24Idem, 1899: 88. 25 Faria, 1946: 37. The true muiraquitd, whether it be of jade or other material, has two distinguishing features: first, it is batrachian in form, although contas also may represent toads and frogs; second, it is characterized by a peculiar provision for suspension which insures that it will lie flat against the body with the design forward. This provision consists of two connected drillings, one lateral and one dorsal, on either side. No perforations are visible from the front. This arrangement for suspension suggests that the muiraquitd was intended to be worn singly as a pendant, not as part of a necklace. Contas, even those of jade, are not so perforated. Archaeologically, the muiraquitd has another char- acteristic. While groups of contas having single per- forations have been found in burial urns in certain Amazonian areas, thus demonstrating that they had originally been elements of a necklace, the batrachian form with double drillings, thus far, has been found only in isolation.26 A conta having a transverse bore is illustrated on pl. 110-a, b. In contrast, the perforations characteristic of the muiraquitd are demonstrated by pl. 110-d which is the side and back view (reduced in size) of e on the same plate; also by fig. 10 which illustrates the side and back views of pi. 108-e. Nimuendaju made the suggestion that the Amazonian muiraquitd might have been worn on the forehead.27 To this idea Barata offers several objections not the least of which is that some muiraquitds are very large, and he figures an incomplete one which weighs 300 grams and measures 105 mm. in length.28 The problem of how and by whom the tmutiraquitd was made is still an unsolved one. Barata explains the early records as follows: Because the Amazonian Indians neither utilized nor knew metals, the necessity arose to explain in some way, no matter how improbable, the fact that they possessed lithic artifacts of great hardness beautifully sculptured and polished; also that these were characterized by delicate perforations of as much as seven centimeters in length. To those first interested in the subject, uninformed as they were concerning the artistic and technical develop- ment of some of the Indian cultures of the Amazon, it appeared impossible that these artifacts should have been manufactured by simple manual processes by individuals lacking any instrument of iron. They therefore turned for explanation to fantastic popular beliefs.29 However, some South American Indians were still fashioning stone artifacts without metal tools in the mid-nineteenth century. When Wallace was exploring the extreme north- western Rio Negro Valley, he was impressed by the craftsmanship of the stone ornaments worn by the natives of the Rio Uaupes. These consisted of pendants in the form of cylinders of imperfectly crystallized quartz, four 26 Barata, 1954: 244 ff. 27Wassen, 1934: 341. 28 Barata, 1954: 250, pr. X, XI. 29 Ibid., 251. 78</page><page sequence="80">THE ARCHAEOLOGY to eight inches in length, about one inch in diameter, flattened on either end and pierced for suspension near one end. The chiefs wore even larger cylinders and these were bored full length to be worn transversely. The boring, Wallace was told, was accomplished by means of triturating "the pointed flexible leaf-shoot of the wild plantain in sand and a little water." To bore the chieftain's cylinder, he was informed, "sometimes required two lives." 30 When Barbosa Rodrigues was on the Uaupes, he saw the boring process in operation. The Indian placed the stone between his first two toes and twirled a shoot of Pacova Sororoca (Urania amazonica) between the palms of his hands in sand and water. Rodrigues re- marked that the process required skill, patience, and time. Polishing, he understood, was done with an animal tooth.31 Also from this area Nordenskiold figures a stone idol of gray trachyte, 1.1 meters in height. It is now in the Musee de l'Homme in Paris. It represents a squatting male figure with an elongated torso and hands pressed against the chest. The features are badly worn. The idol was discovered by Portuguese missionaries in the seventeenth century and, "apres aventures nom- breuses," was taken to France by Francis de Castelnau in 1847.32 There is reference in the missionary literature of the Amazon to string-sawing, the technique so effectively employed in fashioning the elaborate jades of Gualipes in northwestern Costa Rica. Barata quotes Fr. Joao de S. Jose as writing that although jade is very hard, "with a string of cotton or aloe and sand and water it is easily cut." 33 In discussing the Costa Rican jades, Lothrop states that "apart from the Gualipes region, cutting jade with a string is of great rarity but con- siderable antiquity." This author also states that "flat saws for slicing jade were of very hard wood" and that the final polishing was probably done by hard wood such as bamboo.34 Mason believes that string-sawing was used in the fashioning of Middle American jades as well as those in areas further south. He refers also to the use of the tubular drill. This implement could serve to drill holes for suspension and, turned at an angle, could form semicircles or arcs. In Mexico these drills were prob- ably of copper or bone which were worked in sand or other abrasive.35 There were no metals in ancient Amazonia; however, bone could have been used there, and it has been suggested that the Chinese may have achieved some of the fine effects in their decoration of jade by means of bamboo and sand.36 Certainly the eye forms on muiraquitas often suggest tubular drilling. 30 Wallace, 1889: 191 ff. 31 Rodrigues, 1875 (1) : 56. 32 Nordenski6ld, 1930: 63, pl. LVI. 33 Barata, 1954: 253. 34 Lothrop, 1955: 47 ff. 35 Mason, J. A., 1927: 53. 36 Hansford, 1950: 94. Foshag, writing of the techniques employed by the Middle American lapidary, states that the implements were chiefly of stone, wood, reed, bone, and rawhide. He believes that neither metal tools nor ultra-hard abrasives were employed; hard stone was fashioned by stone that was no harder, on the principle that "diamond cuts diamond." 37 Barata states that muiraquitds of nephrite or similar minerals have been recovered archaeologically in vari- ous parts of Brazil-Maranhao, Piaui, Alag6as, Per- nambuco, Bahia;38 however, seemingly, the principal radiation center was the Tapajos-Trombetas area. (This would include the Nhamunda.) After the Conquest a regular commerce in muiraquitds developed with Europe. This seems to have been due to the belief that, powdered for ingestion, these stone forms could cure certain diseases. Perhaps for the same reason the natives themselves were responsible for their wide distribution in Brazil. Dispersive forces are still active today and the muiraquitd, by purchase, passes from person to person and from place to place. Both Barata and Netto call attention to what appears to have been an active factor in this distribution and Barata remarks: ... It is that in this incessant movement of the muir- aquitd from place to place, there is always conspicuous a preference that is less for the artifact in itself than for its color-the strange love of the green stone, so widely dif- fused among the primitive peoples of America and of the world. The Tapajo, as we have noted, made objects of other minerals of various colors, which today are called muiraquitas but only those of pedra-verde or a similar mineral such as nephrite have been the center of interest and have become widely scattered. Thus it would appear that, more than the object itself, the pedra-verde was the real attraction.39 The green of the jade was appreciated in Middle America also: The brilliant green feathers (of the quetzal bird), the vivid green of jade were rare and therefore commanded a high price. The maize plant was green, the forest was green, and therefore the Maya considered green a sacred color ... 40 Rodrigues reports one exception to the preference for a green stone in Brazil. Native women with suckling children chose rather a paler, more yellow, muiraquitd, since such stones were believed to increase the milk supply.41 Koehler-Asseburg remarks: . the idea of the muiraquitd is closely associated with the mineral of which it is made, or, rather, with different minerals which display greens of various hues.

SOC. have been mentioned . . . by a great number of authors who usually did not specify the stone employed including possibly jadeite, nephrite, amazonstone, chloromelanite, saussurite, green feldspar, etc., under a single denomination difficult later to determine .. 42 With regard to the colors of the muiraquitds, these also vary: there are diverse hues of green from greenish white, yellowish green, olive colored, milky, to dark green almost black; and there are the colors of all the other minerals of which they are made which may vary from that of the grains of the palest "jade" or diorite to the darkest, at times black.43 Castlenau, voyaging down the Amazon in the mid- nineteenth century, reports jade from the Rio Negro as follows: On me donna aussi a la Barra des fragments de jade qui avaient dte trouves dans le sable du rio Negro: c'etaient de petits cylindres en forme de grains de chapelet et en tout semblables a ceux que l'on recontre souvent dans le tombes antiques du vieux monde. Les Indiens leur attribuent de grandes vertus medicinales. II nous a dte impossible de savoir de quelle localite venait ce mineral. Les Indiens disaient seulement qu'il n'etait pas du pays. Peut-etre fraudrait-il en rechercher l'origine dans les premieres emigrations de la race rouge. I1 est difficile de ne pas admettre qu'un peuple plus civilise que les Indiens actuels n'ait habitd autrefois cette region ... 44 Chroniclers in southern Brazil wrote freely concerning pedras-verdes and other hard stones fashioned by the natives into tembetas-lip ornaments. These seemed to be surrounded with no mystery. However, Padre Jose de Moraes, in writing of the Nhamunda, stated that . . it is certain that there are these pedras-verdes Mmong the Indians, and I had a large one, and yet it is not known the place where they are found, that is whence they were extracted.45 The missionaries Joao de Lery in Rio de Janeiro, Gabriel Soares in Bahia, and Ivo d'Evreux in Maranhao, all report the use of pedras-verdes among the Indians of these provinces. It is believed that Soares was referring to specimens of beryl which actually is found in Bahia. Ivo d'Evreux writes of the importance of pedras-verdes among the natives of the Mearim Valley, Maranhao, and states that these stones were supposed to have medicinal properties, that they were used as lip ornaments and could be traded to great advantage. Supposedly they were obtained from a mountain in the area. In the opinion of Netto this stone might have been nephrite from very thin and very rare veins since decomposed. Although several tribes in this area still used the tembeta at the time of his writing, a green stone among them was very rare.46 La Condamine visited Amazonia in the mid-eight- eenth century. He was much interested in the pedras- 42 Koehler-Asseburg, 1951: 205. 4 Ibid., 209. 44Castlenau, 1851: 5: 114 ff. 45Barata, 1954: 243. 46 Netto, 1885: 518. verdes which he called "pierres divines." He remarked that the fable regarding their fabrication was hardly worth refuting, but he marveled that native Americans could have contrived such forms with the implements they had anciently possessed. He said it was principally the Tapajo who were possessors of the muiraquita47 Referring to the search for the source of the pedras- verdes north of the Amazon, Rodrigues states that Humboldt, Hortsmann, Antonio dos Santos, and the Schomburgk brothers were variously informed con- cerning the origin of the jade stone, but none of them had succeeded in locating it and, for the most part, considered the origin traditions to be myths. Yet these lithic objects, delicately fashioned and held sacred by the Indians, continued to appear and only in fabricated form.48 Richard Schomburgk states that, during his travels in British Guiana, legends concerning the Amazons were most frequently related among the Arawak and the Macusi; however it was never the narrator but another individual, either dead or not present, who had had the good fortune to have seen these women. Regarding the green stones he remarks: It was through the Caribs along the Guiana coast that these stones were brought into Georgetown where they were known as macuaba or calicot stones. On the Orinoco they are called macagua, apparently the same term as the former. Formerly the Caribs brought them to the capital in considerable quantities, but very rarely nowadays .. .49 Apparently, thus far, jadeite in its natural state has never been found in Brazil; however, nephrite has been reported from Bahia;50 um grande bloco de pedra- verde malva suposta ser de nephrite (as yet unanalysed) which weighs 5 kilos 700 grams was brought to Manaus from the Serra of Roraima in 1928.51 In spite of the interest in the subject, especially in Brazil, our knowledge of the origin of the muiraquitd and the methods by which it was made seems to have scarcely advanced since Heger wrote in 1924: The area of origin of the material from which they [muiraquitds] were made is unknown today. However it is possible that it may be situated in the yet unexplored upper valleys of the Trombetas and Nhamunda Rivers which have their headwaters in the southern slopes of the Serra do Acarahy, which extends from the borders of British Guiana in the direction of Brazil. The significance of these artifacts is completely unknown as is also the identity of the tribes who made them.52 For a period it was argued that the unworked stone of the American jades must have come from Asia. Meyer disagreed with this theory 53 and Washington, writing later, offered even more definite objections. 47 La Condamine, 1778: 137 ff. 48 Rodrigues, 1899: 32 ff. 49 Roth, trans. and ed., 1923: 262 ff. 50 Ihering, H., 1904: 555; Koehler-Asseburg, 1951: 206. 51Barata, 1954: 253. 52 Quoted by Koehler-Asseburg, 1951: 212. 53Meyer, 1888: 231 ff. 80</page><page sequence="82">THE ARCHAEOLOGY He emphasizes that: a. The geology of Mexico and Central America is little known. b. Many of the decorated jade pieces indicate clearly that the original material was water-worn pebbles and, in some cases, portions of the original pebble are evident. c. The fact that jades were required as tribute over a period of years implies a fairly substantial source of supply. d. To have furnished the material for the large num- ber of jade objects already recovered, to say nothing of the probably numerous specimens still in the ground, would have required many fleets of large canoes on a long-continued transportation service from Asia. e. Almost all the jade called chalchihuitl by the Aztecs was jadeite, but the chemical and mineralogical evidence refutes the theory that American jadeite was brought from Asia. f. The colors of American jades differ, on the whole, from those of Asiatic jadeite jade; grays, which are common in America, are not found in Asia, while pure white jade, so common in Asia, is not found in America.54 It was the towns in the southern states of Mexico- Vera Cruz, Puebla, Guerrero, Oaxaca, and Chiapas- which paid tribute to Montezuma in chalchihuitl, and it is in this general area and along the Pacific coast from Guerrero to Costa Rica that jades are most frequently found archaeologically today.55 Some authorities believe that, in Middle and Central America, there may have been several sources from which the ancient craftsman received native jade with which to fashion the beautiful artifacts we read about historically and today find buried in the ruins of his ancient civilizations. This supposition is based upon Montezuma's tribute roll, but also upon the fact that specimens found archaeologically in these areas and analyzed have displayed both strong mineralogical differences and marked variation in color.56 The source of much of the jade in the pre-Columbian period was probably pebbles and boulders found in the beds of streams winding down from the high mountain ranges of southeastern Mexico and western Guatemala. Morley reports the excavation of an unworked jade boulder weighing several pounds from a tomb in Copan.57 During the excavations of the expedition of the Carnegie Institution of Washington at Kaminaljuyiu, Guatemala, in 1936, a jadeite boulder 40 cm. in diameter was found in the ramp of the adobe structure 6 of Mound A. This is the largest boulder yet discovered in the New World.58 54Washington, 1926: 94 ff. 5 Nuttall, 1901: 227 ff.; Mason, J. A., 1927: 49 ff. 56Kidder, Jennings, Shook, 1946: 105. 57 Morley, 1946: 428 ff. 58Kidder, Jennings, Shook, 1946: 19. The work of the late Dr. Wm. F. Foshag of the Smithsonian Institution of Washington and his as- sociates seems to have verified that the jade of Meso- american artifacts was native.59 Dr. Foshag states that jade artifacts have been found in pre-Classic sites in both Mexico and Guatemala; that the radiocarbon dating of one of these, Tlatilco in Mexico, attributes its age to 1500 B.C. Therefore, jade must have been in use in Mesoamerica for 3,000 years or more. This author continues: . . .Mineralogical studies (Foshag 1954) have shown that nephrite does not occur among Mesoamerican jades, but that all three forms of jadeite, pure, diopside-jadeite, and chloromelanite, are represented. During 1952 one of us (Robert Leslie) found a large, somewhat spherical boulder of jade measuring about 11 inches in diameter in a freshly ploughed field bordering on the north bank of the Montagua River (Guatemala). This field is part of the farm known as "Finca Trujillo," located between San Cristobal Acasaguastlan and the aldea of Cuijo . . Approximately 2 km. west of Finca Trujillo, near the aldea Manzanal, on a flat area well above the river level, is an archeological site. ... At this site more than 30 small chips of jade and quartz were picked up in the space of a few minutes .... Directly above the aldea of Manzanal is an outcropping of jadelike mineral. This occurrence can be found by following the main trail from Manzanal to the foothills of the nearby mountains in a northerly direction for about 1 km. The outcropping covers an area of approximately 400 square feet, is situated on the eastern side of the trail, and is plainly visible from it. ... The ground surrounding the outcrop is littered with fragments, and stone of a pleasing but not rich green can be found along the entire length of the trail from Manzanal to the outcrop. This author believes that: . . .The areas most favorable geologically for the occur- rence of jade are the Sierra de las Minas, the Sierra de Chuacas, and the western shore of Lake Yzabal, Guate- mala, where serpentine rocks abound. Raw jade and workshop jade materials from tombs about the Montagua River valley suggest this region as a possible center of a jade-working industry and for the dispersal of worked jade objects. Dr. Foshag includes in his report chemical analyses of jadeite from Manzanal, Kaminaljuyui, Mexico, and Burma. His conclusion is that the facts we have "should put at rest the last remaining hints that American jade is an importation from Asia." Barbour offers the further information that: By fortunate coincidence, the new Atlantic Highway from Guatemala City to Puerto Barrios on the Gulf of Honduras will pass within 200 yards of the source of Leslie's sample and open 2 other nearby outcrops, so that within 5 years that locality and other promising exposures in new road cuts will become readily accessible for more intensive study .. .60 59 Foshag, 1955: 81 ff. 60 Barbour, 1957: 411.

Jade stone was discovered in Alaska in 1883, and in British Columbia in 1887;61 it has been reported also from Filmore County, Wyoming.62 In discussing probable processes employed in fashion- ing Middle American jades, Morley remarks that, in order to make perforation easier, the stone was often bored from both ends, the openings meeting in the middle.63 Brazilian jades, also, are frequently characterized by borings from opposite sides, the size of the openings decreasing as the point of contact is approached. While Middle American jades are much more elabo- rate than those of the Amazon, and while their design does not, in the least, suggest the same ideology as that displayed by the muiraquitas and other lithic ornaments and amulets of northern Brazil, it would seem that much the same basic techniques and also similar imple- ments must have been employed in the manufacture of hard-stone artifacts in both areas. It seems well established that the natural jade stone from which the ancient Americans carved their arti- facts did not come from Asia.64 There are, however, certain bits of tradition regarding jade, expressed in the legends of Brazil and in the customs of Middle America, that suggest some ideological similarity be- tween the New and Old Worlds with regard to the origin and use of jade. It seems that these should be considered in that they suggest the problem whether these apparent parallelisms may be due to mere chance, or whether they may have reality based upon actual transportation from China of myths regarding jade, and of customs concerning its use there. Naturally, such legends and customs would be modified in the New World owing to time and environmental conditions. One tradition which is recorded in the literature of both Brazil and China associates jade with moonlight. In Brazil there was the legend of the sacred lake of the Mirror of the Moon, into which the Icamiabas plunged on moonlight nights to recover the jade muiraquita. Rodrigues quotes from Blondel, without giving definite reference, that anciently in Khotan "as soon as at night people saw a locality bathed in moonlight, they plunged into the river to search for fine stones." 65 Hansford, writing a few years ago, quotes from an old book on Chinese handicrafts which states that in Chinese Turkestan jade was sought when the moon was full, because jade was supposed to reflect moon- light, and that the women stripped and plunged into the rivers of Khotan to obtain it.66 61 Emmons, 1923: 12 ff. 62 Martin, 1946: 66 ff. 63 Morley, 1946: 430. 64 Rodrigues believed the actual muiraquitas were of Asiatic origin, 1889: 18, 41, 52, 59, 82. 65 Ibid., 31. 66 Hansford, 1950: 39. There are two other legends not, as far as I know, previously discussed, which suggest somewhat similar traditions in both Brazil and China. These are con- cerned with the strange idea that a stone as hard as jade should be soft in its natural state. In Amazonian literature there are many references to the ancient Indian belief that the muiraquitas, and pedras-verdes in general, were made of a green clay found in the beds of rivers and lakes; this clay was fashioned under water and, as soon as it was exposed to air, it suddenly became so hard that its form could not be changed. Hansford quotes the Chinese author as stating that jade, when embedded in the rocky structure of the mountain, is soft "like cotton fiber," but when exposed to the air it becomes hard.67 Other similarities between ancient Chinese and American Indian beliefs and customs regarding jade are the following: Referring to Aztec customs, Mason quotes Tor- quemada as stating that, upon the death of a chief, "They put in his mouth a fine stone resembling emerald which they call chalchihuitl and which they place as a heart." 68 Blom figures a skull found in the Uloa Valley, Honduras, in which a jadeite bead, over the centuries, had become attached to the inner surface of the teeth.69 Concerning Chinese mortuary customs Groot writes: The idea that death is merely a long protracted sleep and that corpses may come to life again . . . has prompted the people, since times immemorial, to stuff the mouth of the dead with things supposed to be imbued with vital energy derived from the great element Yang. ... Among these articles, a certain class of minerals called yuh, embracing sundry sorts of jade or jasper, nephrite and agate, have always obtained a first place.70 Of special importance in the Chinese mortuary ritual were the tongue-amulets of jade which princes sent as a final honor, when one of their equals died, to be placed in the mouth of the deceased. Tongue amulets were shaped like a cicada which was a symbol of resurrection. In Taoism the belief was highly developed that jade was food for the spirits and that eating it tended to insure immortality.71 Writing of the Maya in Honduras, Blom quotes from Landa as follows: When dead they shrouded the corpse and filled the mouth with ground corn (maize) which is their food and drink which they call koyem, and with it some stones of the kind which they use for money, so that in the next life they should not be without food. 67 Ibid., 39. 68 Mason, J. A., 1927: 48. 69Blom, 1933: 22. 70 Groot, 1892: 1: 269. 71 Laufer, 1912: 269 ff. pl. XXVI. 82</page><page sequence="84">THE ARCHAEOLOGY Blom adds: Thus from Landa we learn that green stone beads or cuscas were used for money by the Maya.72 Laufer states that in China jade was pounded and mixed with rice and administered to the corpse of an emperor before burial.73 As previously mentioned, Heriarte stated that muiraquitds were used to buy wives in eastern Brazil and for trade in the Trombetas-Tapaj6s area, and that the missionary Ivo d'Evreux referred to the trade and medicinal value of pedras-verdes in Maranhao, at the mouth of the Amazon. Landa, as just quoted, informs us that greenstone beads served as money among the Maya. Concerning the value of jade among the Aztecs, Vaillant writes: The testimony of one of the conquistadores, Bernal Diaz, is conclusive on the point of value. During the night when Cortes retreated from Mexico, the leader, after taking off his share of the treasure, turned the surplus over to his troops. Many, burdened down with gold, drowned ig- nominiously in the canals. Diaz, however, noted Indian usage and confined himself to four jades which he was able to exchange later and which, in his words, "served me well in healing my wounds and gathering me food." 74 In China jade served as money; in value it ranked above gold.75 As previously noted Barata refers to the belief in Brazil that jade ground up and ingested could cure certain diseases. Laufer reports that, in the days of the Chou dynasty, jade was taken internally as food. He mentions especially the ritualistic ingestion of jade by the emperor who "must take pure extract of jade; it is dissolved that he may eat it." 76 Groot quotes from Koh Hung, an alchemist author of the fourth century: He who swallows gold will exist as long as gold; he who swallows jade will exist as long as jade. . . . Bits of jade when swallowed or taken with water can, in both cases, render man immortal.77 Pedras-verdes, and especially muiraquitds, are not common, and the known specimens are widely scattered. Perhaps the largest single collection is that of the late Dr. Carlos Estevao de Oliveira, former Director of the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi in Belem. Presently it is in the keeping of his family in Recife. The Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi has a few beautiful pieces in its own collection, as also have Dr. Frederico Barata and Dr. Geraldo Correa of Belem, and Mr. Charles H. T. Townsend, Jr., of Belterra.

The figure indicates front, end, top, and back views in actual size. This piece is unique and of excellent workmanship. My first impression was that such a dainty specimen could not be a batrachian representa- tion; however, after a little research, I discovered a toad upon which it seems the design might have been based. It is a large specimen figured by Ihering; 82 it bears the popular name untanha and is known for the bull-like sound of its croak. In appearance it has ridges across its back and also lengthwise markings, its hind legs are striped transversely but, most striking feature of all, a horn protrudes above either eye. It seems that the front view of this muiraquitd could be a stylized representation of the upper surface of this toad with its hind legs extending to emphasize the joints and their markings. The two horns are clearly in- dicated as is the nose between them. This multi- colored animal is depicted in a pale green translucent stone mottled with light brown. In spite of its small proportions, the piece was clearly designed to be worn 80 Pough, letter, May 28, 1953. 81 Barata, 1954: pr.

Necklace Units (Contas) Some of these necklace units are so delightfully fashioned and of such beautiful stone that it would seem that they must have been designed to be worn alone as pendants or, perhaps, as one of several units attached to a cord with spacing between the units. In other cases the units appear to have been intended to be one of a series without spacing-beads would come into that category. The direction of the bore gives an indication of the probable adapation of the unit. Un- doubtedly some specimens were amulets. Both in the stone employed and in general design the necklace units seem to fall into two general groups. I think provenience is of little significance in this dif- ferentiation, as there is much archaeological evidence of active trade in ancient Brazil. I believe the dissimilarity between the two groups is due primarily to a time element-the older group displaying resemblance in style and in the stone employed to the muiraquitds, the later one characterized by more opaque and less rare varieties of stone and designs which, except for subject matter, do not seem related to Tapajo art. It would seem probable, also, that some of the beads are older than others, the nephrite specimens and the more trans- lucent ones possibly belonging to an earlier period. I personally examined the Estevao, Townsend, and Goeldi collections in Brazil, and those in the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation in New York, and of the University Museum in Philadelphia in the search for necklace units. Dr. Frederico Barata of Belem, generously gave me photographs of necklace units in his own collection and others that he had pub- lished. It is some of the pieces in the Barata Collec- tion, those in North America, and a few pieces in Sweden which seem to belong to a later period. In addition, within this apparently later group, there is also a differentiation in style. Tapaj6 art had a vital quality and, although clay and stone are very different media, this characteristic vitality is evident in some necklace units, while other specimens seem more static and formal in design and do not suggest Tapajo origin. I think probably the figures on pl. 112 may be Tapajo, also possibly pl. 113-d, e, g; pl. 116-c and f definitely figure a Tapajo piece. The others may be trade pieces from a distance or the products of other cultures on the Lower Tapaj6s. In my classification, I shall designate these groups as Older Style and Later Style. A.

These idols, like the muiraquitas and other specimens of fine stone craftsmanship, seem to have been associated primarily with the ancient cultures of the Trombetas and Tapajos Valleys. Nordenskiold figures three two-hole idols that were acquired by Nimuendajui for the Ethnographical Mu- seum of Gothenburg. One of these idols was found at Sucuruju on the left bank of the Trombetas. It appears to represent a squatting male figure in the grasp of a jaguar or similar beast. The two holes are formed on the back surface of the figure by purely functional connections between the animal's hind feet and its tail. Another specimen in Gothenburg was found at Boa Vista de Santa Anna on the banks of Lago Jacupa, also in the Trombetas Valley. This piece depicts a female figure seemingly precariously seated and holding on to a narrow support. Above her is a demon-like figure. Two parallel perforations, of approximately the same diameter, run transversely through the idol below the figure. The third specimen was found at Lago Sele on the right bank of the Amazon (probably the present Lago Sele west of the Tapaj6s). It depicts a squatting anthropomorphic figure with upraised hands having six digits each. Two parallel perforations of ap- proximately the same diameter pierce the lower section of the torso front to back. The head is surmounted by a monster-like figure.113 Rodrigues figures other two-hole idols of much the same type and offers the opinion that the design of each suggests the sphere of magic in which it functioned -protection against various types of dangers, success in fishing, hunting, etc.l14 Netto figures a two-hole idol in the form of the dreaded piranha. Both authors believe that the two holes were for the purpose of attaching the idols to the prows of montarias or other small craft."15 A. Two-Hole Idols 1. P1. 116-a, d.

Representation of a turtle made of rather soft pale green stone, measuring from head to tail 5.5 centimeters; across the trunk 4.5 centimeters; height 3.4 centimeters. The head (mouth indicated) and neck are extended; the tail is in high relief and folded sideways. The limbs, with claws indicated, are in high relief and folded along the sides of the trunk.

An oval hole measuring 2.4 centimeters by 1.5 centimeters extends 1.8 centimeters from the bottom into the trunk and is then subdivided into two holes measuring respectively 1.2 and 1.3 centimeters in diameter at points where they perforate the back. The distance between the two periph- eries is 3 millimeters. The idol was found along the shore of the Trombetas River near the Brazilian and the British (Guiana) frontier by an Indian medicine man.

This piece has been pur- chased by the University Museum. 117 Bordallo da Silva, letter, February 22, 1956. Drawing by Sr. Guilherme Leite. 3. P1. 107-a. This important piece is at present the property of Sr. Carlos Ribeiro of Rio de Janeiro. It first belonged to a priest who lived in Obidos. After his death it disappeared. Barbosa Rodrigues, who knew of the piece, began inquiries concerning its whereabouts and learned that the idol had fallen into the hands of some children who, believing it to be the Devil, had buried it in the late priest's back yard. Re- covered, Rodrigues obtained it and, by inquiry among the friends and relatives of its original owner, learned that it had been found in the area Rodrigues had named "Costa do Parui," discussed previously under Muiraquitds. According to Rodrigues, the Costa do Paru is some eighteen miles above the mouth of the Trombetas in the island-filled stretch of the Amazon between the Trombetas and the Nhamunda. D. Maria de Lourdes Jovita, after some research, sent me a map designating one of these islands as its possible site. Generally speaking, this was the area in which Orellana is reported to have been attacked by the warrior women and, in the opinion of Rodrigues, the idol may have belonged to them. The figure is carved from a single block of serpentine and depicts an onsa seated on a tartaruga, the jaguar's claws clutching a decorative device which extends over the head of the turtle and on either side of it, held in suspension by the jaguar's tongue. The tartaruga's neck is encircled by a decorative band. a 88 I</page><page sequence="90">STYLISTIC CHARACTERISTICS OF CERAMICS Rodrigues states that the Amazonian Indians believe in the "mother" of plants, animals, and physical ele- ments, without specific cults regarding them, and he suggests that this idol may represent the "Mother of the Onda" who would be a powerful aid in the hunt for the giant turtle whose meat, eggs, fat and shell were so important to the native economy. In the posterior surface of the tartaruga there are two holes which extend diagonally downward for 10 cm. piercing the base of the figure, thus serving as a means of attachment to a canoe or other object.l8 This piece in particular, but also the two-hole idols published by Nordenskiold, previously referred to, though very small in comparison, suggest in general stylization and in ideology, the great stone carvings of Nicaragua.119 Type S-VI.

STYLISTIC CHARACTERISTICS OF TAPAJO CERAMICS Marajo art is geometric, that of the Tapaj6 is vital. Maraj6 potters specialized in surface design-painting, engraving, champ-leve; relief was a minor element. On Tapajo pottery paint and engraving served as con- tributory factors to the general effect, but the genius of the Tapaj6 was for realistic modeling. On Maraj6 pottery zoomorphic design is usually highly conventionalized and very limited quantitatively; by contrast, Tapaj6 pottery is replete with zoomorphic expression, and the fauna is depicted with considerable realism, although the line between the zoomorphic and the anthropomorphic is sometimes thinly drawn. Among the Tapajo the fauna was portrayed in vessel, figurine, and adorno form. The Tapajo potter also frequently employed human subjects-the collections contain numerous figurines and vessels in anthropomorphic form; quasi-human figures appear as adornos. The caryatids are always anthropomorphic. There was probably a considerable chronological gap between the pottery-making era on Marajo and that 118 Rodrigues, 1875 (2): 4 ff.; Jovita, letter, March 12, 1957. 19 Bovallius, 1886: pls. 1, 2, 9, 11 to 14. of the Tapajo area. By 1616, the date of the founding of Belem, the potters of Maraj6 seem to have been extinct-at least the early missionary and other records do not report ceramics as one of the industries of the warlike tribes on the island at that period. In contrast, the Tapajo culture was apparently at its peak when the Portuguese first ventured into their area. Although different stylistically and seemingly also ideologically, these two outstanding Amazonian cultures both dis- play, in highly developed form, an unusual and dif- ficult technique-that of the hollow rims. This fact suggests the possibility that there may have been a culture of intermediate date which acted as carrier of this important ceramic form. As far as I know, no Marajo specimens have ever been encountered in the Tapajos Valley. Nimuendaju's report on his excava- tions in various Amazonian areas, at present in Gothen- burg and unpublished, might be of assistance in solving some chronological problems. Because Tapajo art is so native and because of certain peculiarities of stylization, the pottery is usually easy to identify. However, Tapajo design also presents features in common, not only with Marajo, but with cultures whose remains have been found far from the Amazon Valley. For the purpose of considering possible affiliation of the Tapajo with other areas, this study of stylistic characteristics has been divided into two sections: Non-correlating Factors, concerned with faunal rep- resentations which portray the native element in Tapajo design, and Correlating Factors, which refer to the more fundamental structural and decorative traits which Tapajo pottery presents in common with that of other important American archaeological areas. In large Tapajo collections zoomorphic forms usually greatly out-number those which are anthropomorphic in character. Almost always, in depicting their fauna, the Tapaj6 used the round-rimmed protuberant eye; however, this eye is strikingly characteristic of the culture as a whole. Some of the more conspicuous animal representations which appear in Tapajo ceramics and which serve as identifying factors are the following: NON-CORRELATING FACTORS THE CROCODILE The heads of the ugliest of the Amazonian animals, the crocodile, (jacare) were employed, stylized and to good effect, as "wings" on winged bottles. The snouts of these forbidding animals are depicted supporting little dogs, birds, and other small figures; the effect is bizarre but light and airy and the ugliness is lost. Sometimes the crocodile is represented in vessel form, a little man riding contentedly on its tail. Winged bottles with crocodile heads in wing position are peculiar to the Tapajo (pls. 18-a; 32-b, c; 33; 36-c). VOL. 50, PT. 3, 1960] 89</page><page sequence="91">PALMATARY: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE LOWER TAPAJOS [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. THE JAGUAR The jaguar (onca) was usually treated with respect, perhaps because both its strength and its beauty were appreciated. It appears frequently both in vessel form and as an adorno. As a vessel it is almost always the onca pintada which is depicted; the body surface is divided into quadrangles in the center of which is a large dark spot. The mouth on representations is always circular and wide open, and from it project disproportionately large teeth and a tongue. Tapaj6 experience with the jaguar is indicated by the fact that this animal, in vessel form, is frequently portrayed about to devour some creature, usually a child. Thus the Tapajo jaguar is easily recognizable (pls. 46, 47; fig. 2-e). THE MONKEY Amazonia has a large and varied monkey popula- tion. Today this little animal is frequently a household pet and often is quite devoted to members of the family. No doubt the same was true in the Tapajo era. In ceramics the monkey appears as adornos and in figurine and small vessel form (pls. 44-a, d; 63-d; 78-f). THE BIRD Amazonian birds are beautiful and the Tapajo dis- played full appreciation of that fact. In both clay and stone stylized bird forms are conspicuous. Bird heads with long beaks served as "wings" on winged bottles, the markings on their heads suggesting color zones. It is interesting that the bird was never caricatured as was the crocodile in the same position. As adornos the bird was common and always stylized (pls. 34-e; 36-a; 75; 76-d). THE CUTIA An animal which appears frequently in adorno form on Tapajo pottery is the cutia or aguti. This is a small rodent with a short tail; when it eats it sits up like a squirrel. Cutia heads are numerous in sherd collections and, on them, the paws are always raised to the mouth (fig. 2-d). These adornos, figurines, and vessels in representa- tion of the fauna of the Tapajo area are purely Tapaj6, important for purposes of culture identification and for tracing Tapajo trade routes; they do not suggest cultural heritage or correlations with other areas. Correlations must be based upon older and more fundamental traits such as structural characteristics, special techniques, and decorative elements that are common to the Tapajo and other areas where the fauna may be different or ignored in the ceramic decoration. Also significant for correlating purposes are certain anthropomorphic forms and methods of depicting anatomical elements on anthropomorphic and zoomorphic representations. CORRELATING FACTORS BATRACHIAN FORMS Wassen remarks that "conventionalizing a certain motif is usually followed by disintegration of the figure." 1 This fact is well illustrated by the study of the batrachian motif which gave rise to this comment. For that reason a quantitative estimate of the relative use of the batrachian form in decoration must depend upon individual interpretation of the design. I have, therefore, chosen more or less to ignore the disintegra- tive elements in the case of toad and frog representa- tions, and to adhere, for the purposes of correlation, to depictions of the complete, or almost complete, animal, in the hope that some uncertainties in judgment may be avoided. There is no doubt about the importance of the batrachian to the Tapaj6; the form was widely used as an ornament on pottery and also in both clay and stone as an amulet. However the batrachian appears not to have been employed by the Tapajo in a container capacity, a fact which may have been of some signifi- cance although we have no information on this phase of the subject. In legend, and also historically, the Lower Trom- betas and Nhamunda were the source of the famous pedras-verdes, many of which were in batrachian form. In this area, also, batrachians in adorno form have been found, many of which appear to have been trade pieces from Santarem. There is reason to believe, however, that there may have been Tapajo settlements on the northern bank of the Amazon (see map 3). It is interesting to note that batrachian forms do not appear in Marajo pottery either in vessel form or as decoration. The only vitamorphic figures the Marajo Indians used were the human being and the crocodile, and these only in highly stylized forms. One small batrachian figure adorns a vessel from the valley of the Cunani on the mainland north of Marajo,2 but toad and frog forms seem to have been incon- spicuous in the archaeology of the northeastern coast of Brazil, as far as we now know it. In the archaeology of Venezuela stone amulets in frog and toad form are common, and the batrachian appears also as vessel decoration, but more rarely.3 In Colombian archaeology batrachian forms in clay seem rare, although Loven refers to their occurrence on the rims of Chibcha vessels;4 also, they appear with frequency on rocks in the Chibcha area.5 In metal they seem fairly common.6 1Wassen, 1934: 324. 2 Goeldi, 1905: pi.

He further states that: ... It is presumed that the toad, rather than the frog, is represented, for the former is common in the region, grows to a large size and is venerated to some extent by the modern Arhuaco Indians of the high mountains. ... The toad, highly conventionalized, appears also in bell form.7 In Cocle ceramics batrachian forms are rare.8 In Chiriqui, however, the picture changes and frog or toads appear both as adornos on vessels and as small base metal figures plated with gold or entirely of gold.9 Lothrop states that, "Next to eagles frogs are most frequently represented in Veraguas metal" and he figures several pendants of excellent workmanship.10 From Las Mercedes, Costa Rica, Lothrop reports three gold froglike forms; 1 in this area the batrachian appears also in ceramics as an adorno.12 Hartman figures a series of jade amulets in batrachian form from Las Guacas, Costa Rica; some of these are stylized, some quite naturalistic in design.13 From Nicaragua, Squier reports a batrachian figure in a gray stone resembling "verde antique." 14 In Middle America definite batrachian forms seem more rare than further south. Among the Maya the ,inal glyph is accepted as a frog form,15 and from Coban, Guatemala, Joyce figures a vase which is a half batrachian effigy.16 Hewett refers to Monument 9 at Quirigua which has been variously identified as a toad, a frog, a tiger and an armadillo; he considers it a purely mythical representation.17 The Aztecs con- ceived of the Earth Goddess as a huge toad,18 and frog- like forms of gold, also of stone and rock crystal have been reported from ancient Mexico.19 The batrachian motif again becomes conspicuous in the archaeology of the Southern Mounds, it appears in collections from Arkansas,20 Mississippi,21 Alabama,22 and the Gulf Coast of Florida.23 Holmes figures a 7 Mason, J.

These vessels represent Tapaj6 ceramic design in one of its most highly developed forms. In addition to several complete or almost com- plete specimens in collections, caryatids in sherd form are numerous, indicating the prevalence of this type of vessel at both Santarem and Lago Grande. Architecturally speaking, the caryatid may be de- fined as a free-standing, or almost free-standing, female figure designed to support some superstructure.32 The classical example is that of the maidens who seem so effortlessly to bear the weight of the roof of the Erectheum in Athens. In the architecture of ancient America there is a beautiful, though male, example of a free-standing support in the figures of the Toltec warriors in the temple of Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli in Tula, Mexico.33 In this case, as in that of ancient Greece, the weight of the superstructure rests entirely upon the heads of the figures without the assistance of the hands. Atlantean and near-caryatid forms in stone were well-developed features in the architecture of some areas of ancient America. In Yucatan, they appear in the Temple of the Warriors,34 and in the Temple of the Tables,35 and among other temples in the area.36 24 Holmes, 1901: pl.

On Cozumel Island, near the present town of San Miguel, a little temple displays another form of an- thropomorphic support-a kneeling female figure con- stitutes the lower section of a monolith, the figure, the column and the capital having been carved from one piece of porous limestone.37 An unusual near-caryatid form. At Manabi, Ecuador, there were highly developed quadrupedal zoomorphic figures and also anthropomor- phic forms designed to support stone seats. These are near-caryatid forms. At first, Saville believed the seats at Manabi to be unique, but later related them to the whole stool-seat-metate complex in which support- ing figures in stone, wood, and clay were referred to by early explorers over a vast area beginning with Florida on the north and extending south through the West Indies, Central America, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Dutch Guiana, Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru.38 The kneeling stone figure of unknown origin (pl. 120-d) was believed by Fewkes to be Antillean, prob- ably from Haiti or Puerto Rico. He states that "the Antillean features of the image are so suggestive that the culture is well nigh proved by them," and he adds that in the opinion of Seler, Holmes, and Saville it is not Mexican. He suggests that it may have supported a surface for votive offerings.39 The small stools of stone and clay, so conspicuous in the archaeology of Chiriqui and Costa Rica, suggest by the variety in the type of their decorative supports a possible illustration of the caryatid in evolution. Mac- Curdy states that the first step in the manufacture of a stool or metate from a boulder is to hollow it out to reduce the weight; the next step may be to cut "windows" in the sides to lighten it still more.40 It would be reasonable to assume that the panels between the "windows" would gradually become decorated and finally might assume vitamorphic form. However, in these areas, the concept of the caryatid was by no means as clear as it was at Santarem. Among the Tapaj6 the caryatid is always of clay, always free-standing, always female or sexless except in the instance of those figured on pl. 32-a which are male. There were no Atlantean figures in the collections studied, in no case did the hands assist in the support of the bowl. Some Tapajo caryatids are crude (pl. 71-a, b, c, g); some are highly stylized (pl. 72-d). This latter form is without arms and usually figures the coffee-bean eye. On the better naturalistic forms, the Tapajo round- rimmed protuberant eye is the type usually employed, although there are a few exceptions (pl. 38-b). The number of caryatids is always three; they always rest upon a medially constricted annular base, and they 3 Holmes, 1895: 65. 38 Saville, 1907: 1: pls. 4 to 9; 2: 103. 39 Fewkes, 1909: 348 ff. 40MacCurdy, 1911: 27 ff. always support the same general type of bowl, although no two bowls are identical. In Marajo ceramics there is little evidence of the true caryatid. Sometimes, on funerary urns, an- thropomorphic figures are placed in handle position, but only rarely is there evidence of their support of the overhanging rim.41 Ring bases to which are attached cylindrical or flat uprights for the support of a bowl are common in Venezuela.42 Such simple support forms seem to have had no counterpart among the Tapajo. However, further north in Cocle and Costa Rica the medially constricted pottery rest was a well-developed ceramic type.43 Some of these forms closely approximate in structure the base upon which the Tapaj6 caryatid rests. Similar medially constricted forms have been reported from Arkansas (pl. 119-f). In the archaeology of Chiriqui and Costa Rica the small stool appears in both clay and stone; its supports are sometimes purely geometrical,44 sometimes un- organized vitamorphic forms,45 sometimes alternate geometric and Atlantean figures (pl. 119-a), and finally, very rarely, the true caryatid support. Such supports are illustrated by the five female figures on the stool from Gariche, Chiriqui (pl. 119-b). The only other instance in this area of the caryatid in mature form, in the authorities consulted, is a beautiful piece figured by Hartman from Chircot, Costa Rica. On this stool a series of identical birdlike figures having human attributes support its upper surface on their inclined heads.46 In the University Museum there is a caryatid vessel from the Mississippi Valley (pl. 120-g). This piece has a ring base, common on the stools of Panama and Costa Rica, but the number of the supporting figures is three, as it is on the Amazon; as on Tapaj6 vessels, the weight is borne by the head without as- sistance of the hands. It represents the caryatid in mature form. The caryatid dish of the Tapajo seems to be a development by them from elements borrowed from one or more cultures where medially constricted annular pottery rests were used and also where vitamorphic figures were employed as supports. However, the Tapajo went beyond merely combining two form-con- cepts. They stylized the caryatid and also its base so that they are easily recognizable in any collection, and they invented a distinct type of bowl to rest upon the caryatids which, although ornate, is beautifully balanced in its decorative scheme. Thus, while the caryatid dish 4 Palmatary, 1950: pl. 89-a. 42Kidder II, 1944: pls. XVI-1 to 7, 10, 15, 20, 22, 23 and others. 43Lothrop, 1926: 37 ff., pl.

COMPOSITE FORMS A Tapajo ornament which seems peculiar to that culture is the composite form (pl. 76-a and b, f and g). On these an anthropomorphic and a zoomorphic form, the latter usually that of a bird, emanate from the same body. Almost always on such pieces the eye on both of the figures is the round-rimmed protuberant form. In Venezuela and in other areas there is considerable bifurcated rim ornament, but usually the two sections are practically identical. This composite form having the round-rimmed protuberant eye may be identified as Tapajo. ENCLOSED EYE AREAS On Tapaj6 pottery the area around the eye is some- times delimited by an engraved or relief design sug- gesting a definite eye zone (pls. 17-b, 27-d, 46-a, 67-a, d). The trait is conspicuous in the delineation of bird heads (pl. 75-a, b, d). The delimitation of the eye area appears also on Maraj6 pottery.47 In Cunani ceramics an eye area is sometimes created by the elaboration of the eyebrow.48 The enclosed eye area is not a characteristic of Venezuelan or Colombian design, although it appears on a few of the stone figures at San Augustin.49 In painted technique the trait is common in Cocle.50 In the Greater Antilles the doughnut eye is the predominant type. This eye is usually represented as large in proportion to other facial features, producing a stylistic effect which sometimes obscures other ele- ments of design. In the pottery of the Dominican Republic many of the vitamorphic heads figure an enclosed eye area (pl. 121-a). Krieger, also, shows several examples of this trait 51 and one piece which is strongly suggestive of the Tapaj6 specimens, (pl. 67-a, d).52 The enclosed eye area appears also in Haitian archaeology.53 EYE FORMS After having made my initial study of the pottery from Santarem and Lago Grande, I began going through large Antillean collections in an effort to determine whether there were stylistic similarities between the West Indies and the Lower Amazon. At first I was impressed by what seemed to be dissimilarity, even when specimens from the two areas had much the same form. I finally realized that this difference in 47 Palmatary, 1950: pls. 30-a, 75-a, 83-b, 94-a. 48Goeldi, 1905: est. I-18a, 19; II-15a, 17. 49 Preuss, 1931: 2: pls. 42, 43, 53. 50 Lothrop, 1942: pl.

To be sure that this impression could be substantiated, I went through several thousand sherds in the University Museum's Tapajo collection and listed and counted the types of eyes on vitamorphic specimens. This study has been published 54 but I am including it here to emphasize the great preponderance of the round- rimmed protuberant eye on Tapajo pottery. I did not make further numerical record of the eye forms in collections I studied subsequently in Sweden and Brazil, but my judgment is that this type of eye greatly predominates in the specimens in all collections from the Lower Tapaj6s Valley. The analysis referred to is as follows: The figures in the following analysis refer to the number of instances, a single piece having been counted as unity regardless of the number of eye representations on it.

Many of the pieces probably represent mythological characters, or purely imaginative creations. This type of eye is used on practically all bird forms, and these constitute a conspicuous element in the decora- tion. It is also used, almost exclusively, on representa- tions of the aguti, the jaguar and the frog. There are some crude forms in which this eye has been attempted, but, in the main, the round-rimmed protuberant eye, or some variation of it, is found on the pieces which show the best workmanship.

The various forms of eye representation are also used extensively as body, rim, handle, and base decoration, sometimes more than one form being employed in the same design. The eye may constitute the sole element of the design or it may be combined with incised lines or pits, or geometrical forms in relief, or often the design is made up of conventionalized anatomical representations of which the eye is but one. 94</page><page sequence="96">STYLISTIC CHARACTERISTICS OF CERAMICS DOUGHNUT EYE The doughnut eye, Types A and B, is not a Tapajo deliniative trait. The missionary records refer to several tribes which lived in the Tapaj6s Valley, and sometimes the pottery from this area, though essentially Tapajo stylistically, displays other decorative tradi- tions as well. In Tapaj6 collections there are pieces which are definitely non-Tapajo but which figure the doughnut eye; examples are pls. 68-a from Lago Grande, 70-h from Santarem, and 86-d from Cocal in the Lago Grande area where there appears to have been a Konduri settlement. The doughnut eye was a characteristic of the pottery of the Lower Trombetas and Nhamunda Valleys, high- ways to the north (pls. 85-a and c, 87-a, b, and d, 88-d). In the early days of the European occupation this area seems to have been the principal habitat of the Konduri and allied tribes. Evidently there was considerable trade between the Tapajo and the Konduri because Tapajo sherds are found with fair frequency in Trom- betas sites (pls. 75, 88-c). Sometimes the doughnut eye is surrounded by a raylike decoration (pl. 88-a from the Trombetas, pl. 86-c from the Tapajos). Both Faria and Hilbert figure examples of the doughnut eye from the Trombetas Valley.55 In Maraj6 ceramics there was little eye stylization except for the half-closed type. Only a few examples may be classified as doughnut and these not definitely so.56 In Venezuela the doughnut eye was common but usually was crudely depicted,57 although a few fair examples have been reported from the northwestern area 58 where it was used also as a decorative motif.59 Requena shows a series of whistles which feature this eye form.60 In certain areas of Colombia the doughnut eye ap- pears to have been well developed, especially in Santa Marta61 and Momil.62 In the ceramics of the Greater Antilles the doughnut form of eye is used almost exclusively on vitamorphic figures. In this area it serves not merely as an anatomic representation but it is a dominating factor in pottery design (pl. 121-a).63 55 Faria, 1946: figs. 19, 21, 22, 27, 30; Hilbert, 1955: figs. 15-e, 23-b, 26, pp. 54, 59. 56 Palmatary, 1950: pls. 42-c, 79-c, 86-a, b. 57 Bennett, 1937: figs. 9, 10.

ROUND-RIMMED PROTUBERANT EYE The great preponderance of the round-rimmed pro- tuberant eye in the pottery of Santarem and Lago Grande marks this eye form as a definite ceramic trait among the Tapajo and suggests it as an important correlating factor with other areas. From the Rio Teffe, Upper Amazonia. Metraux figures a sherd which may well have belonged to a Tapajo trade piece, displaying, in good technique, a zoomorphic head with a round-rimmed eye and, beneath it, a large sigmoid scroll, another element character- istic of Tapajo decoration.64 Unfortunately, the ar- chaeology of the Teffe is little known. Marajo potters used the round-rimmed protuberant eye but rarely; 65 however, in northeastern South America this eye was reported from the "east coast of Demerara" by Im Thurn,66 and there are a few excellent examples of it from British Guiana in the Roth Collection in Gothenburg.67 In Venezuela the round-rimmed protuberant eye was fairly common, sometimes as a natural anatomical feature, sometimes as a decorative motif.68 The pitted type of round-rimmed protuberant eye, not common on the Amazon, seems to have been rather highly developed in Venezuela, although the deeper pits make the form approximate the doughnut type of eye. In the Dutch West Indies, off the coast of Venezuela, the round-rimmed protuberant eye is clearly indicated.69 In Colombia and other areas north of the Amazon the round-rimmed protuberant eye occurs sporadically without suggesting either definite local tradition or actual correlation with the Tapaj6. An exception might be a crescent-based figurine found by Hartman on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica; on this piece both the eye form and the headdress seemed almost Tapajoan.70 From Ecuador 7T and also from Peru a few round- rimmed protuberant eye forms appear on ceramic figures.72 FIGURINES THE CRESCENT-BASED FIGURINES A conspicuous anthropomorphic form in Tapaj6 ceramics is the crescent-based figurine (pls. 57-a, 58 to 61). As previously stated in this study (Type XIII- A), this type of figurine is not peculiar to the Tapaj6 area or even to the Amazon, but has a wide distribution as far north as the Mississippi Valley. However, there 64 Metraux, 1930: fig. 23. 65 Palmatary, 1939: pls. 4-c, 90-b, 100-h. 66 Im Thurn, 1884: pls. 16, 18. 67 Palmatary, 1939: figs. 36-a; 52-e, f. 68 Nomland, 1933: 734; 1935: figs. 4-q; 14-c, f, o; 15-a, b, n, o; Osgood and Howard, 1943: pl. 5-1; Kidder II, 1944: pl. 1II-9. 69Josselin de Jong, 1918: pls.

SOC. are more specimens of this form of figurine in Tapaj collections than in any other with which I am familiar. These figurines are always either female or sexless; their base is definitely crescentic. They seem to depict a kneeling or squatting figure, the knees representing the points of the crescent; the lower legs and feet are not indicated having been absorbed into the stylization of the base. On the Amazon, a fragment of a base reported by Metraux from the Rio Teffe appears to have been part of a crescent-based figurine.73 Little archaeological material has been reported from that area. In Marajo ceramics this general type of figurine is common, but the knees, instead of being pointed, are raised (pl. 117-a).74 The crescent-based figurine appears also in Venezuela and, in base form, is closely similar to that of the Tapajo (pl. 117-b). This particular specimen depicts a parturition, suggesting that the form may have been associated with fertility rites. Kidder figures a series of crescent-based figurines characterized by "quad- rilateral corded heads" from northwestern Venezuela. Requena reports a type having broad, rather flat, oval heads.75 In the Peabody Museum, Harvard University, there is a crescent-based headless form (55129), which might have been either a figurine or a vessel, from the Cauca Valley, Colombia.76 The piece is similar to the Maraj6 type in that the knees are raised. In contrast, from Tubara, in northern Atlantica, two crescent-based figurines have been reported on which the knees are pointed, relating them more closely to the Tapajo form.77 In the archaeology of Chiriqui crescent-based fig- urines are numerous, skilfully made, and are all of the alligator ware (pl. 117-c). . . .The neck is usually pierced to facilitate suspension, and the underside of the body-the sitting surface-is triply perforated or punched, if solid, as if for the purpose of fixing the figurine in an upright position on a movable support.78 Lothrop states that this Chiriqui type of figurine of alligator ware extends archaeologically as far north as Puerto Lim6n and the Gulf of Nicoya and that it is found also in highland Costa Rica.79 Plate 117-f illustrates a specimen from Nicaragua. Bovallius, also, figures painted crescent-based forms from this area.80 Only a few specimens of this type of figurine seem to have been recovered in Guatemala.81 73 Mtraux, 1930: fig. 9. 74 See also, Palmatary, 1950: pl. 47-b; 100-a, c, f; 101-d. 75 Kidder II, 1944: pi.

In Mexico the crescent-based figurine in definite form is rare, although a few specimens may be so classed.82 These do not include any of the archaic type.83 However, in the archaeology of the Mississippi Valley a form of little pot is common which figures a kneeling female form and which suggests the crescent- based figurine of the Tapajo (pl. 117-h). On some of the more primitive specimens strips of clay on the under surface suggest legs. Many of these pots are hunch- backs as are some of the Tapajo figurines (pl. 61-a, b).84 Certain pipe forms from the state of Mississippi and from Poteau, Oklahoma, near the Arkansas border, depict the seated human posture from which the crescent-based form may have been derived.85 In the archaeology of the Dominican Republic vessels are found which closely resemble those of the Mis- sissippi Valley. Some of these are hunchbacks (pl. 117-g). In this area the vertebrae are sometimes indicated, and conventionalized feet appear on the back of the vessels; in the vessels of the Dominican Republic the knees are raised, correlating them more closely with the Marajo than with the Tapaj6 type of crescent-based figurine.86 South of the Amazon the crescent-based form seems not to appear as a figurine, but Imbelloni reports a series of eleven "figurinas-vasos" having crescentic bases without indication of legs or feet; on these the hands and arms are placed similarly to those on the Tapajo figurines. Seven of these pieces came from Cerro del Zorro, Dept. de Cafayate (Salta); the provenience of the other four is not known. These little vessels lack sex indication.81 The Marajo Indians made a form of crescent-based vessel which did not appear in any of the Tapaj6 col- lection studied. This consists of the lower section of a crescent-based figurine (pl. 117-e)88 Strangely enough, the same form appears in the archaeology of the Puye of New Mexico (pl. 117-d). FIGURINES HAVING ENLARGED LOWER LIMBS One of the most interesting specimens in the Tapaj6 collections studied is the large figurine (pl. 56-a). As far as I know this piece is unique in Amazonian ceramics. It is typically Tapajoan in design except for the representation of the lower limbs. The Tapaj6 recorded the deformities of their people as well as certain adornments which caused deformity. How- ever, this particular specimen suggests the depiction of a diseased condition.89 82 Palmatary, 1939: fig. 44-a. 83 Spinden, 1928: fig. 13. 84Holmes, 1903: pls.

One which was originally published by Requena is illustrated on pl. 121-c. This piece correlates closely with the specimen from Santarem except in type of eye, which is highly characteristic of Venezuelan anthropomorphic forms. Requena reports several other figurines on which the trunk and arms appear normal but on which the lower section of the body is greatly enlarged.90 From Tocoron, Osgood figures five variations of this gen- eral type, all of which are distinctly Venezuelan in head and eye form.91 Kidder reports three specimens from northwestern Venezuela.92 All the Venezuelan forms, like the single specimen from the Tapajos, seem to have been female. A vessel representing a female figure having a normal upper body but enlarged lower limbs and feet is reported by Debenedetti from northwestern Argentina.93 PEDESTAL FIGURINES Only a few pedestal figurines appeared in the col- lections studied; these were, however, so well made and so true to type that it would seem that this form must have been of some special significance to the Tapajo. Of those illustrated, pl. 64-a, c, e and g are the most complete specimens. On these the columnar support is extended at the lower extremity into a footlike form upon which toes are indicated. The eye is of the slit protuberant type. This form seems to be limited to the Tapajos Valley. Another form, slightly different in design but more suggestive of the Tapajo ceramic tradition, is illustrated on pl. 66-b. It comes from Belterra, some thirty-five miles south of Santarem. This specimen features the round-rimmed protuberant eye so characteristic of Tapajo design; its base, however, is circular. This piece is the only one with a circular base which appeared in the Tapajo collections studied. Marajo ceramics are, of course, much older than those of the Tapajo. In this area the pedestal figurine appears to have been rare, only one specimen having been found in the several collections examined. On this piece the base is circular, similar to the one just described, but it is cut into points suggesting toes.94 Thus, in base form, this type has features in common with both of the Tapajo styles. From La Mata in Venezuela, Bennett figures two pedestal figurines which consist merely of a head and a columnar support which is not extended at the base. Bennett seems to consider these pieces complete.95 However, a much more highly developed type has been 90 Requena, 1932: 41, 65, 73, 115. 91Osgood, 1943: fig. 12; pls. 10-D, 11-A, B, D. 92 Kidder II, 1944: pI.

These specimens have an extended circular base similar to the Tapaj6 piece from Belterra, but figure the slit protuberant eye- the eye form on the footed type from Santarem.96 In Venezuela the columnar supports are nearer in form to the Marajo than to the Tapajo type. Thus, in Vene- zuela, the pedestal figurine displays characteristics of both the major Amazonian cultures. I have not examined the Venezuelan specimens, but those from the Tapajos are too small and too fragile to have served any utilitarian purpose. FLANGES DECORATIVE BELOW THE RIM Judging from Tapajo sherd collections, there was a fairly common type of vessel which featured a decora- tive flange below the rim (figs. 7-d, 8-g). Small vessels in vitamorphic form often display this characteristic (pls. 45, 50), and it was used also just below the neck of small vitamorphic bottles (pl. 44). The collar which is so characteristic of Tapajo pottery has a slight decorative flange as its base (pls. 9, 11-c). On Marajo pottery a decorative flange below the rim appears occasionally, but it is not a conspicuous trait.97 In the Roth Collection from British Guiana in the Ethnographical Museum of Gothenburg there are four sherds having definite decorative flanges below the rim.98 This type of flange has been reported from La Cabrera, Venezuela, and was described as unique for the area; 99 another flange below the rim has been re- ported from Torcoron without comment.100 Whether or not these flanges are decorated it is impossible to say, but the general type seems to have been rare in that area. From Trigana, Colombia, Linne figures one sherd having a decorative flange below the rim,101 and from the Pearl Islands a globular jar which clearly illustrates this principle.'02 Lothrop reports a bowl with a decora- tive flange from Cocle,103 and pl. 121-d figures an example from Nicaragua. In Middle America the flange is a common decorative device, but in most cases it is placed low on the body of the vessel; there are, however, a few exceptions in Guatemala and Spanish Honduras.'04 Other examples have been reported from Les Zapotes, Veracruz, Mexico.105 96Requena, 1932: 71, 119; Howard, 1943: pl. 6-d. 97 Palmatary, 1950: pI. 99-b, e, f; fig. 4-12, 14. 98 Idem, 1939: fig. 52-a to d. 99Kidder II, 1944: fig. 17(51). 100 Osgood, 1943: fig. 6-e. 0ol Linne, 1929: fig. 8-b. 102 Ibid., fig. 17-a. 103 Lothrop, 1942: fig. 472-a. 104Idem, 1936: fig. 32-a, b; Shook, 1944: 7-a; Longyear III, 1952: figs. 50-w, 70-q. 105 Drucker, 1943: figs. 35-c, 41-f, g; Weiant, 1943: figs. 32-8, 33-46 and 64. 97 VOL. 50, PT. 3, 1960]</page><page sequence="99">PALMATARY: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE LOWER TAPAJOS [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. The decorative flange below the rim is common in western Florida and the neighboring Gulf Coast.106 HANDLES MULTIPLE SPANNING HANDLES Tapaj6 concentric dishes (pls. 11-a, b; 12-c) and vessels having grooved rims (pl. 12-d) always have four spanning handles. From the number of complete and partially complete pieces in collections and sherds of other specimens, it would seem that four decorative spanning handles must have been a common trait in Tapaj6 design. In no other area, as far as I know, is there a counterpart of the four spanning handles of Santarem. MULTIPLE UPRIGHT HANDLES In Tapajo ceramics multiple upright handles are rare, the only two examples in the collections studied are those figured on pls. 17-b and 22-e. In both cases the handles are purely decorative. In Marajo ceramics multiple upright handles are very unusual,107 as they seem to have been also in Colombia 108 and Cocle.109 Globular jars having four upright strap handles were fairly common in Guatemala, two having been re- ported from Lake Atitlan,110 seven from Nebaj.111 In the Ohio Valley four upright handles are com- mon; 112 they are figured also, but only rarely, on vessels from Tennessee.113 Four, and sometimes eight, handles appear on the pottery of Alabama 114 (pl. 118- a) and Arkansas; 115 in some cases a decorative band suggestive of eight handles surrounds the collar of a vessel, producing an effect similar to that on the sherd shown in pl. 121-e. Some of this collar ornament suggests the hollow rim in embryonic form.116 HANDS-TO-FACE MOTIF Frequently, on Tapajo vitamorphic specimens, the hands or paws are raised to the face. Usually on human or quasi-human forms the representation is simple and naturalistic (fig. 1-c, d,; pl. 59-b) ; some- times on zoomorphic forms the design suggests an animal eating (pls. 26-a, 30-a, 69-e, 86-e). Often, however, on such specimens the paws and mouth are merged into a single decorative element (fig. 2-d, f; pl. 106 Moore, 1902: fig. 124; 1903: fig. 3; 1915: pl. XV; 1918: pl.

Occasionally, in this area, the paws become a handle (pls. 77-e, 86-d). In Marajo ceramics the hands-to-face motif is in- conspicuous and seems not to have been a tradition on this island, although it appears occasionally on an- thropomorphic forms; 117 in Venezuela, however, this decorative device is common. In this area it appears on superimposed forms, a human face decorating the smaller upper section of the vessel while arms are extended upward from the larger lower section.118 In Costa Rica the motif appears in both stone and ceramics, sometimes in anthropomorphic, sometimes in zoomor- phic form.119 In a very primitive form, the hands-to-face motif is reported from Jamaica.120 In the Dominican Republic and Haiti this motif is sometimes naturalistically rep- resented, as in the last figure on pl. 121-a,121 but often it is stylized into a legitimate handle, or supplies the decorative device for lugs in handle position.122 Similar stylization appears also in the archaeology of Cuba.123 In the Greater Antillean representations, the dough- nut eye is used practically exclusively in the hands- to- face motif. On the Amazon, this eye appears only on such non-Tapajo forms as fig. 1-c and pl. 86-d; the Tapajo specimens figure the native round-rimmed protuberant eye. A handle found in St. Vincent in the Lesser Antilles (pl. 120-a), displays the hands-to-face motif and figures the round-rimmed protuberant eye. Fewkes found a practically identical handle on the island of Carriacou.124 These handles can be almost duplicated in design by the piece from Piquiatuba, a few miles south of Santarem (pl. 77-e). The sherd representing an aguti with upraised paws (pl. 120-b), is also from St. Vincent; it may be duplicated by fig. 2-d from Santarem. Both of these forms are common in Tapajo collections and probably are sherds of Tapaj o trade pieces which made their way north into the Caribbean. In Venezuela, the hands-to-face motif appears to have remained simple and unstylized. The Tapajo may have borrowed the idea of merging the paws and the mouth into a handle from non-Tapajo peoples having a decorative tradition similar to that of the Greater Antilles; fig. 1-c and pl. 86-d are probably Konduri specimens. In Veracruz, Mexico, the hands-to-face motif char- acterizes certain whistles in vitamorphic form but it is not stylized in that area.125 117 Palmatary, 1950: pls. 27-a, 79-c. 118Requena, 1932: pls. 49, 61, 81, 85, 91, 99, 103. 119 Hartman, 1901: pls. 30-6, 42-6, 43-6, 43-9, 66-7, 72-4 and 6. 12o Booy, 1913: pl.

The only instance in the collections studied of this decorative element on an almost complete vessel is figured on pl. 16-c. This type of shoulder ornament seems to have been limited to the Tapajo. HUNCHBACKS In Tapajo collections there are several vessels and figurines which depict deformed individuals, both male and female. Among these are hunchbacks, figures with bowed legs, and three with withered arms and legs together with hunched backs and pigeon chests (pls. 40-c, 41, 48-b, 49-a, e, 61-a, b). Linne, in his excellent study, "Humpbacks in Ancient America," states Among the Indians it is customary to kill deformed children immediately upon birth. Of this, numerous in- stances are on record from South America among tribes of varying cultural levels, particularly from the region east of the Andes down to El Chaco .... ...................- From North America there are numerous records of new-born, deformed babies having been killed. Mooney sums up the infanticide question thus: "There are well authenticated instances of deformed children being put to death at birth. On the other hand children crippled by accident are treated by parents and companions with the greatest tenderness." Linne attributes the killing of deformed children to the fact that, under the conditions of primitive life, they would be burdensome to their people, and also to the belief in many cultures that children who, at birth, displayed symptoms of later malformation were those of a demon or otherwise unnatural father.126 This author describes the position of the hunchback in ancient Mexico as follows: In the many-headed court of Moctezuma were also found "some very ugly humpbacks, very small of stature and their bodies almost broken in half, who were their jesters." In his second report to the emperor, Cortes gives, inter alia, a detailed account of Moctezuma's royal household. . . . He, too, refers to humpbacks and other deformed persons, and adds that each group of deformed lived apart by themselves and had especially appointed people to wait upon them. These statements recur later on, more or less verbatim, in the chroniclers. Mexico's foremost ethnographer, Father Bernardino de Sahagun, also relates that humpbacks and other deformed individuals were kept for the pleasure of persons in authority .... Hernando Alvarado Tezozomoc, son of Cuitlahuac, the last ruler but one of the Aztecs, was born just before or im- mediately after his father's death in 1520. When he wrote the history of his people he was especially well qualified for obtaining reliable information. . . . According to this chronicle, Moctezuma associated on familiar terms with the humpbacks. They were his confidants in religious matters, 126 Linne, 1943: 162 ff. and took part in that overwrought potentate's attempts at getting in contact with the gods .... When Quetzalcoatl journeyed from Tula to the Atlantic coast, his companions were dwarfs and humpbacks . . . but we meet the humpback with more exalted company. The goddess of love, Xochiquetzal, for example, included humpbacks in her entourage. . . . the Aztecs purposely deformed children with a view to procuring for them employment at court . . .127 Linne also records that in Mexico hunchbacks were sacrificed at periods of solar eclipse; this custom con- tributed to their scarcity which, in turn, made necessary artificial deformation.128 Concerning Peru, Linne writes: Humpbacks appear in many of Pomo de Ayala's numer- ous illustrations. All of them represent women, and are dressed in the same fashion as other ladies of the court, to whose class they evidently belong. They are seen waiting upon both the emperor and his consort, and one of their number is engaged in spinning. .... From Father Molina who was born in Cuzco shortly after the arrival of the Spaniards, and whose mother was probably an Indian, Linne quotes concerning a feast which was celebrated annually in that city each August: "all strangers, all whose ears were broken, and all deformed persons were sent out of the city, it being said they should take no part in the ceremony, because they were in that state as a punishment for some fault. . . ." Finally Linne refers to the custom recorded by Polo Ondegardo by which an Indian seeking absolution for some supposed sin which had caused the death of his sons, first confessed, then performed certain rites. This was followed by the whipping, not of him, but of a hunchback.129 Concerning the incidence of the diseases that may have caused hunchbacks in ancient America, Linne comments: The presence of humpback representations in various regions indicates that tuberculosis, rachitis, or syphilis existed there in pre-Spanish times. That these diseases were of rare occurrence may be concluded by the general scarcity of such representations. Most of all this can be noticed on the Peruvian coast, where immense quantities of effigy vessels have been recovered. There are frequent images of persons with diseases and physical defects of the most varying kinds, but humpbacks are few.130 We do not know whether the Tapajo representa- tions of the hunchback are pre or post European; how- ever it is hard to believe that there was any great artistic production in that area after the advent of the white man. In such old literature as I have read I found no reference to hunchbacks, but there is great need for intensive study of the early records, both published and unpublished. My impression has been, 127Ibid., 169 ff. 12s Ibid., 171. 129 Ibid., 175. 130 Ibid., 178. 99 VOL. 50, PT. 3, 1960]</page><page sequence="101">PALMATARY: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE LOWER TAPAJOS [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. based especially upon the male representations, that while culture was intact, perhaps the hunchback was regarded with some esteem among the Tapajo. When I was in Belterra, Mr. Charles H. T. Town- send, Jr., told me that the present-day caboclo con- siders a hunchedback good luck. Linne quotes Lothrop as stating: . . . The hunched-back figure has been a Christian symbol of good luck since time immemorial and is worn with the approval of the church by the Indians of Central America today. Linne then makes the further comment: . . The mestizos of Peru and Bolivia consider hump- backs lucky; laying one's hand on the hump brings good luck. As this disagrees with the statements of the 16th century, this conception must date from a later period.131 In Marajo ceramics the hunchbacked form is rare.132 From the Lake Valencia area of Venezuela, Linne re- ports a slightly hunchbacked figure.133 In the archae- ology of Costa Rica hunchbacks are common; Linne refers to five published by Lothrop and figures five other specimens in the Ethnographical Museum of Sweden, Stockholm.134 Lothrop reports still others from Middle America, but predominantly from Mexico. Linne lists thirteen references to hunchbacked figures in museums or discussed in published archaeological studies; he also illustrates one piece from Mexico in the Ethnographical Museum of Sweden.135 Drucker reports two hunchbacked figures from Las Mesas, Veracruz.136 It is interesting to note that the Chiriqui figurines have straight backs. The small jar from the Dominican Republic (pl. 117-g), is a hunchback. Loven publishes a similar vessel and a monolithic celt in the form of a hunch- backed anthropomorphic figure from the same general area.137 Fewkes reports a stone figure which is a hunchback.'38 In the Lower Mississippi Valley the small vessel in the form of a hunchbacked anthropomorphic figure is common, the greatest number reported having been recovered in Arkansas.'39 Often on the west coast of South America anthro- pomorphic vessel-forms seem designed not so much as definite portraiture as an accommodation to func- 13Ibid., 181. 132 Netto, 1885: 324; Palmatary, 1950: pl. 47-a. 133 Linne, 1937: figs. 1, 2. 134 Idem, 1943: figs. 4 to 8. 135 Ibid., 166 ff., fig. 3 136 Drucker, 1943: pls. 23, 57. 137 Loven, 1935: pls.

There is a handle on either side between the faces. If the vessel is turned sideways the handle becomes a nose, and an eye from each of the back and front faces completes a third face.142 The Tapajo frequently used interchangeable facial features as decoration on the bulbous section of their long-necked bottles. In this study the frog adornos obscure this decoration, but it may be seen in part on pl. 34-d. NECKS BULBOUS WITH OUTWARD RECURVE This neck is common in Tapajo ceramics (pls. 13-c, 14-a, 24-a, c, 47-b; fig. 7-k). It does not appear in Marajo pottery, and in Cocle the recurve is not pro- nounced. However, in the Ouachita Valley of Louisiana the bulbous neck with outward recurve is as common as it is in Tapajo ceramics. On the Amazon these necks usually appear on supported globular vessels; in the Mounds they were used on unsupported vessels frequently globular in form.143 INSET NECK An unusual form, but one that is common on Tapajo pottery, is the inset neck. On vessels so fashioned the base of the neck is set within the shoulder of the vessel. Almost all the caryatid dishes are so designed as well as many of the better type of other supported and unsupported globular forms (pls. 9, 16-c, 18-b, c, 24-a, 27-e, 37-a, 38). The only other areas in which I have been able to find comparable forms, though much simpler in design, are the eastern United States and the Dominican Republic. One piece with inset neck has been reported from the Ohio Valley,144 another from eastern Mis- souri,145 one from Georgia; 146 a striking example was recovered from northwestern Florida,147 and a less well- defined form from the valley of the Black Warrior River, Alabama.148 One definite form has been re- ported from the Dominican Republic.149 140Lehmann, 1924: fig. 71. 141 Means, 1931: fig. 38; Tello, 1938: figs. 30, 55, 59; Estrada, 1957: fig. 123: Cossio del Pomar, n. d.: frontispiece, lam. 8. 142 Palmatary, 1950: pls. 49, 86-a. 143 Moore, 1909: figs. 10, 11, 15, 21, 25 and others. 44 Holmes, 1903: CLXI-b. 145 Evers and Potter, 1880: pl. 20-5. 146 Holmes, 1903: CXXI-a. 147 Moore, 1903: fig. 29. 148 Idem, 1905: fig. 128. 149 Krieger, 1931: pl. 46. 100</page><page sequence="102">STYLISTIC CHARACTERISTICS OF CERAMICS Superimposed forms of the Mound Area often con- sist of a long-necked bottle placed within the mouth of a globular bowl. On such forms the neck is usually inset (pl. 119-g). RIMS GROOVED The grooved rim is extremely rare except in Tapajo ceramics. Hilbert reports what appears to be a grooved rim from the Trombetas Valley 150 and a specimen which Lothrop found in Cocle, he referred to as "curious." 151 Two circular dishes with deeply grooved rims have been reported from Walls, Mississippi.152 Among the Tapajo, grooved rims had spanning handles (fig. 7-e, h), but the specimens from Cocle and Mississippi are without handles, while the one reported from the Trombetas is merely a sherd supply- ing no information concerning handles. HOLLOW The hollow rim is a marked characteristic of both Marajo and Tapajo ceramics; it has been described under the stylistic subdivision, Type XXI-C. Only a few cultures employed the hollow rim and, apparently, it was more highly developed on the Lower Amazon than anywhere else. Nordenskiold found a hollow rim at Tarupayu in Bolivia but, with the excep- tion of Amazonia, the area irt which this form of rim is most frequently found archaeologically is north- western Venezuela. Bennett reported one hollow rim from La Mata, Maracay,l53 and Dr. Cornelius Osgood wrote me that he found about six pottery bowls with hollow rims at Lake Valencia and added, concerning Trinidad, that "hollow-rimmed bowls were fairly typical of that is- land." 154 Hollow rims have appeared in the archae- ology of Tocoron 155 and in that of the Paraguana Peninsula which juts out into the Caribbean.156 However, from the standpoint of correlation with the Amazon, the most important collection is that re- ported by Nomland from the State of Falcon. Re- ferring to the red slipped ware of the El Mamon site, this author states that the "Inrolled hollow-rimmed vessels are all large, ranging from 16 to 50.2 cm. in diameter," and that "Other hollow-rimmed vessels are of the globose bowl types. They range in size from 12 to 49 cm. in diameter." 15T Hollow rims appeared also on bowls of the slipped and modeled gray-brown ware measuring 24 to 26.5 cm. in diameter.158 They were 150 Hilbert, 1954: 827 if. 151 Lothrop, 1942: fig. 472-b. 152 Brown, 1926: figs. 264, 265. 153 Bennett, 1937: 94. 154 Osgood; Letter, April 22, 1935. 155 Idem, 1943: 26. 156 Osgood and Howard, 1943: 65. 157 Nomland, 1935: 33 ff. 158 Ibid., 42. common on vessels of the black-on-white ware; con- cerning these, Nomland remarks, "The hollow-rimmed vessels are all large, the smallest mouth diameter being 22 cm. and the largest 60 cm. ... All the vessels are skilfully painted both inside and outside." 159 And there were several other references in Nomland's study to hollow rims on both large and small vessels. Thus, it would seem that the technique of the hollow rim must have been highly developed in this area. While none of the painted designs on the sherds illustrated by Nomland (fig. 15) display similarity to Tapajo painted design-what little we know of it-the modeled decoration is suggestive of close correlation with the Tapajo area, figuring, as it does, what Nom- land has described as the "shoe button eye" and what has been referred to in this study as the "round-rimmed protuberant eye." Hollow rims appeared at La Maravilla, and the "shoe button eye" was an element in the modeled ornament at this site as at El Mamon.'60 The northernmost area in which hollow rims have been found archaeologically in fully developed form seems to be the little Dutch island of Aruba north of the Paraguana Peninsula. Here the modeled decora- tion figured by Josselin de Jong is more suggestive of the Tapajo than of the Marajo design.161 In the Southern Mounds closely placed multiple handles sometimes suggest the hollow rim in embryonic form; an example is pl. 118-a from Moundville. Holmes reports similar specimens from the Mississippi Valley.162 Something nearer to the hollow rim idea is illustrated by pl. 121-e, a sherd from Moundville. Similar incipient stages in hollow rim development do not appear on the Amazon; there the concept seems to have been clear and the technique well mastered. SCROLLS SIMPLE SIGMOID The simple sigmoid was frequently used by the Tapajo to decorate the collars of their vessels and also the bulbous section of the necks of their winged bottles (pls. 9-c, 29-a, 35-d). It appears in both engraving and relief. This scroll is fairly common on Marajo pottery,'63 but in Venezuela it is rare.64 Cocle orna- ment abounds in scroll forms and the simple sigmoid is conspicuous in both positive and negative effects; 165 in Chiriqui it appears infrequently.166 Linne reports two examples of the simple sigmoid from highland Mexico, and Weiant figures an excellent example on a 159 Ibid., 49. 160 Ibid., 64 ff. 161 Josselin de Jong, 1916: figs. 23, 23a, 23b. 162 Holmes, 1898: pl.

The only other area in which this scroll form seems to have been used is Cocle where apparently it was employed almost as frequently as at Santarem.175 MacCurdy figures one example from Chiriqui.176 INTERLOCKING SIGMOID A sigmoid which apparently the Tapajo did not use but which was frequently employed in other areas having ceramic traits in common with the Tapajo is the interlocking or continuous sigmoid. In Marajo this scroll was used with fair frequency and always on the better wares (pl. 118-c).177 It appears also in Cocle.78 It has been reported, but rarely, from Vera- cruz, Mexico.179 In the Mounds the interlocking sigmoid was a com- mon form of decoration. Often, in this area, it was used to decorate four-lobed vessels, the design being carried unbroken from one lobe to the next; an 'xample from Louisiana is illustrated on pl. 119-e. Sometimes this decoration covered globular surfaces.

Only one instance of this motif occurred in the Maraj6 col- lections studied and that in champ-leve.188 Goeldi figures one example from the valley of the Cunani.189 In painted technique, Lothrop reports one interrupted sigmoid from Cocle.190 The motif appears occasionally in the archaeology of Argentina.191 SUPPORTS FLARING RING BASES Among the Tapaj o the flaring ring base was em- ployed as support on various types of vessels-simple undecorated forms (pl. 14), ornate pieces (pls. 16, 20-a), anthropomorphic representation (pls. 17-a, 41- b), zoomorphic forms (pl. 25-a), winged bottles (pl. 34), and others. It was used on the Trombetas (pl. 87-a), an area with which the Tapajo traded. Marajo vessels are, generally speaking, much larger and heavier than those of the Tapajo. In this culture the flaring ring base was used to support concentric dishes (pl. 119-c) and, occasionally, some of the other smaller types of vessels.'92 In Venezuela this support was not well developed; 193 however from the Santa Marta area of Colombia some well-defined examples have been reported.194 Others have appeared in the valley of the Rio Rancheria,195 while Haury figures a "copa tipica de la cultura chibcha" supported by a flaring ring base.196 In Cocle this form of base is sometimes exaggerated into a high stand,197 though the lower, normal form 183 Moore, 1899: fig. 68; Palmatary, 1950: pl. 111-f. 184 Idem, 1901: fig. 106; Palmatary, 1950: pl. 110-e. 185 Palmatary, 1950: pl. 112-e. 186 Arte Peruano, 1935: lam.

In Chiriqui this base appears occasionally,199 it is fairly common in Veraguas,200 but in Costa Rica and Nicaragua it is widely utilized in ceramic design.201 In the archaeology of Guatemala and Honduras a true flaring ring base is of fair occurrence,202 but in Mexico it is rather common, especially in the eastern state of Veracruz.203 In the Mounds of the Lower Mississippi Valley the flaring ring base is conspicuous. This base has been reported also as far north as Madisonville in the Ohio Valley where it supports a globular bowl having four handles.204 Examples of the same elements from the Tapajo area, but in much more ornate combination, are illustrated on pls. 17-b, 22-e. In the Lower Mississippi Valley the flaring ring base usually supports a bottle with a long neck.205 This is the basic form of the winged bottles of the Tapajo. In the north the neck is not flanged as it is on the Amazon, neither is its lower section bulbous, also a characteristic of all Tapajo winged bottles (pls. 33, 34). However, superimposed forms in the Mounds often consist of a long-necked bottle resting in the mouth of a bowl (pl. 119-g).206 Were this form placed upon a flaring ring base, the basic form of the winged bottles would be complete. There is something of a counterpart in the Mississippi Valley to the skilfully made but most unesthetic form (pl. 48-a). This northern piece also consists of a supine figure resting on a flaring ring base, the neck of the vessel emerging from the abdomen of the figure.207 In the southeastern states the flaring ring base is much less conspicuous than it is in the Mississippi Valley.208 In Ecuador the flaring ring base is common, here it sometimes supports a globular,209 sometimes a super- 198Ibid., figs. 163-g, 318-a, 472-b. 199MacCurdy, 1911: figs. 72, 74, 157, 158, 174; pl.

This attached form of support seems not to have its counter- part in other areas. However, medially constricted forms serving as pottery rests appear in Cocle213 archaeology and also in that of Costa Rica where fre- quently vessels were designed with a rounded bottom.214 One medially constricted specimen has been reported from Cerro Narrio, Ecuador.215 Pottery rests are fairly common in Marajo collections but their tops are almost flat and their sides slanting, displaying no relation to the medially constricted form.216 A form from the Lower Mississippi Valley, similar to the Tapajo type of support, probably designed as a stand, is illustrated on pl. 119-f. THE TRIPOD The true tripod form appears to have been rare among the Tapajo. Three supports are not unusual on zoomorphic forms-two feet and a tail having been utilized to insure stability of a piece (pl. 44-a, c, d, e); also, but only rarely, the two hind legs of an animal were merged to form a third support (pl. 46). In the combined collection from Santarem and Lago Grande at the University Museum there are very few sherds, and all from Lago Grande, which definitely suggest that they might have been supports on tripod vessels (pl. 76-c, e). In general design the two figured appear to be Tapajo. In Gothenburg there is a large dish (pl. 12-d) which originally bore the marks of three equidistant supports. It is distinctly Tapajo in design, having a grooved rim with multiple spanning handles. It is much larger than the caryatid dishes and, in form, is not related to them. This and a similar large vessel in Gothenburg were probably true tripods and have been restored as such. Hilbert figures what are probably tripod supports from the Trombetas.217 There is, as yet, no evidence that the Marajo Indians used the tripod form, neither does it appear in the archaeology of the Brazilian mainland north of Marajo, 210 Saville, 1907: 2: pls.

SOC. as far as we now know it; but it seems to have been common in Venezuela, especially in its northwestern section from which Kidder figures twenty-nine speci- mens.218 The tripod appears to have been rare in Colombia but it is much in evidence in Panama, especially in Chiriqui.219 In Costa Rica and Nicaragua the tripod was a common ceramic form; Lothrop reports it from various areas and in several wares.220 In these areas, as at Santarem, the supports on zoomorphic forms are not always identical and equidistant; instead the tail some- times serves as a stabilizing element.221 As at Santarem, there are a few instances in which the hind legs are merged to form the third foot of the vessel.222 Tripod vessels have been reported from several Guatemalan sites including Kaminaljuyu,223 Zacualpa,224 Zaculeu,225 Uaxactum,226 and also from British Hon- duras,227 Copan,228 and the Bay Islands of Spanish Honduras.229 The tripod was a very common form of support in Mexico,230 and it appears also with frequency in the archaeology of the Mississippi Valley.231 In this latter area it often supports a long-necked bottle. In the Mounds 232 as in Central America and also occasionally in Cocle233 and in eastern Mexico,234 the third support on zoomorphic forms is the tail of the animal. Rarely in the Mounds and Costa Rica the two hind legs of quadrupedal forms are merged to form a third support.235 Thus, although there is little evidence of true tripods in Santarem ceramics, certain other stabilizing devices used occasionally by the Tapajo were employed 218 Requena, 1932: 107; Kidder II, 1944: pls.

In the archaeology of Florida the tripod is rare,236 as it is also in Georgia.237 It would seem, therefore, that this form of support extended northward on the mainland from Venezuela to the Mississippi Valley, but was not utilized in the Mounds of the extreme south- eastern United States, the Antilles, Brazilian Guiana, Marajo, or Santarem. From the west coast of South America a fair number of tripods have been reported.238 Only rarely is a zoomorphic vessel-form supported by two legs and a tail.239 AN URN COVER The urn cover illustrated on pl. 119-d suggests an interesting problem. It comes from Rebordello on the island of Caviana just north of Marajo Island. The de- sign is definitely in the Tapajo tradition; the rim is hol- low and contains pellets, another Tapajo trait, although hollow rims were common on Marajo also. Norden- ski6old states that originally this cover seems to have had a central handle, he remarks that, compared with other ceramics from Rebordello, this piece appears foreign.240 We have no information concerning the probable age of this piece, but apparently the Tapajo decorative technique had been practiced at some period in north- eastern Brazil in an area where the mortuary customs were very different from those of the historic Tapajo. VESSEL FORMS SUPPORTED CONCENTRIC DISHES In Marajo the concentric dish was supported on a flaring-ring base (pl. 119-c). The form was fairly common in that area.241 From Veraguas, Panama, Lothrop reports a com- parable supported form which he refers to as "bowls with double rims." In this area the surface of the outer rim is sometimes unbroken 242 relating it closely to the Marajo form, but in other cases the design has avian characteristics and the outer rim is in- complete.243 I have never seen a Tapajo concentric dish which displayed any indication of having been supported. UNSUPPORTED CONCENTRIC DISHES The unsupported concentric dish with spanning handles must have been a common form of vessel among 236 Moore, 1903: fig. 151. 237Moorehead, 1932: fig. 33. 238 Saville, 1907: pl.

Complete specimens are figured on pls. 11-a, b, and 12-c, but collections contain a considerable number of sherds of these dishes, some quite large (pl. 12-b). A fragment of what seems to have been a vessel of similar form is reported by T. de Booy from the Virgin Islands: this he refers to as "a dish with a double rim." 244 However, from Cocle. Lothrop figures a true con- centric dish. He describes it as follows :245 . . . a curious combination of bowl and plate incorporated in a single vessel. As seen in cross section, this consists primarily of a drooping lip plate. In the center, however, there is a small bowl with flaring walls .... Dr. J. A. Mason tells me that he found a few specimens of similar concentric dishes in Cocle but that, generally speaking, the form is rare in that area. The Cocle vessels do not have spanning handles. This trait seems to have been peculiar to the Tapajo concentric dish. FISH EFFIGY VESSELS Fish effigy vessels are not common in Tapajo ceramics but the few in collections are well designed (pls. 13-a, 15-a, b). Similar vessels do not appear in Maraj6 pottery. From Cocle a few highly stylized fish effigy vessels have been reported,246 but they are very rare in Chiriqui ceramics.247 A specimen from the Ulua Valley, Honduras, is figured on pl. 121-d. Smith reports one from Guatemala.248 In the archaeology of Arkansas fish effigy vessels are common,249 and they appear with fair frequency in that of Tennessee.250 Moore figures two from Moundville,25 Brown two from Mississippi.252 FOUR-LOBED VESSELS Lobed vessels are common in Tapajo ceramics. Bowls sometimes have nine or seven lobes (pl. 8-b, c), the bodies of the winged bottles often have six lobes (pl. 32-b), but four-lobed pieces are a marked characteristic of the culture. These vessels often have zoomorphic attributes (pls. 22-a, b; 30, 43-b; 45), but occasionally a form is purely geometric (pl. 52-f). Lobed vessels are conspicuous also in Marajo pottery where both the large burial urns and small vessels are designed with definite shoulder or body sections (pl. 244 de Booy, 1919: 1: pl.

However, in this culture, the number of lobes seems always to have been four.253 In northern South America, Panama, Central and Middle America there is little evidence of intention to create a definitely lobed vessel although, in Chiriqui, globular jars are sometimes decorated with four hemis- pherical protuberances equally spaced at mid-height of the vessel.254 Four-lobed vessels appear in the pottery of the Dominican Republic although they were not common there (pl. 120-c). From the northern section of the island Krieger figures a jar having four distinct shoulders above which is a beautiful sigmoid scroll. Were it not for the two typical Antillean figures in handle position, this piece could be mistaken for Marajoan.255 There is a four-lobed dish from Trinidad in the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Founda- tion, New York (4-6149). Four-lobed vessels are a marked characteristic of the archaeology of the Lower Mississippi Valley,256 although the form appears with fair frequency in Missouri,257 and as far north as Michigan.258 Four-lobed Tapajo vessels, especially those having vitamorphic characteristics, are often decorated with concentric rings on the lobes (pls. 30-a, 37-b, 43-b, 45-a). Marajo four-lobed vessels are sometimes deco- rated with a scroll which covers the lobes (pl. 118-c).259 This type of lobe decoration is common on the four- lobed vessels of Arkansas and Mississippi,260 and appears on the beautiful piece from Louisiana figured on pl. 119-e. In reality, the four-lobed vessels of the Lower Mississippi correlate more closely with Marajo than with Tapajo design; in the later Tapajo culture the lobed vessel had lost its simplicity and only the fundamental form remained. The four-lobed vessel is common in the archaeology of northwestern Florida (pl. 120-e)261 and, in this area also, the form correlates more closely with Marajo than with Tapajo types. Wissler states that, to a large extent, four was a sacred number in the New World.262 SUPERIMPOSED FORMS When I was working on my original Tapajo study, I was intrigued by what I termed the scalloped profile of several of the Tapajo vessels. This group includes 253 Palmatary, 1950: pls. 14-c; 18-e, 19-b, d; 28-k; 45-a; 84-a; 89-a. 254 MacCurdy, 1911: pl.

PHIL. SOC. such specimens as shown on pls. 13-d, 16-b, 17-a, 22-e. My first assumption was that such designs were due to the Tapajo love of the ornate as expressed in the curved line. However, an illustration from a grave in Panama suggested a more likely origin; this figured a neckless urn supporting a smaller jar without a bottom.263 The combination created a "scalloped pro- file." Thus, the ancient potter may have received her inspiration for the superimposed form by observing the outline of a pile of household utensils. Such Tapajo forms as pls. 3-b, 24-a, 26-b might have owed their inspiration to superimposed pots. This structural trait is marked in certain Marajo vessels (pl. 118-f).264 It is also characteristic of the pottery of the Brazilian mainland north of Marajo as far as the French Guianan border (pl. 118-b, d, e) in- cluding certain specimens from the valley of the Cunani not here illustrated.265 The superimposed form is common in Venezuela. In this area it usually suggests a small globular bowl resting in the mouth of a larger vessel. Often there is a face on the smaller bowl and hands extend upward to it from the shoulder of the larger vessel.266 In the archaeology of Colombia the definitely super- imposed vessel is not conspicuous, usually because the elements contributing to such a form are well blended.267 One rather primitive type has been reported from Quimbaya; this consists of a globular jar supporting a shallow bowl having a mouth which is broader than the greatest diameter of the jar.268 Thus the upper scallop is only half complete. This form of vessel appears in Florida,269 also in Moundville, 270 and has been found archaeologically in northwestern Argen- tina.271 In Panama and in Costa Rica the superimposed form with scalloped profile appears sporadically 272 but does not seem to have been a definite stylistic tradition in these areas. Kidder reports an excellent example of the scalloped profile from El Cerrito, Guatemala,273 and Boggs a rather remarkable specimen from El Salvador; 274 however, such forms are oddities in these cultures while, in Mexico, the superimposed type of vessel seems to have been very rare.275 263 Linne, 1929: fig. 6. 264 Palmatary, 1050: pls. 11-d, e, 32-d, 45-a. 265 Goeldi, 1905: est. 1-3, 5, 6, 11-9, 10, 15. 266Requena, 1932: 81, 85, 91, 97, 103; Kidder II, 1944: pl.

In the Mounds the superimposed form with scalloped profile is a common ceramic type and the units of which it is composed are usually displayed with primitive directness. Such forms appear as far north as the Ohio Valley-Griffin figures a piece from Baum, its design clearly based upon one globular bowl supporting another having lugs in handle position; from Madison- ville, this author reports one specimen consisting of a bowl having four handles supporting another without handles, and still another on which each of the two units has four handles.276 Descending the Mississippi Valley the superimposed form becomes more conspicuous and slightly more sophisticated in design. In Missouri, the common type is a long-necked bottle resting in the mouth of a globular bowl.277 This type appears also in Alabama (pl. 119-g); though superimposed, it is not scalloped in profile. Holmes reports three "compound forms" from the Middle Mississippi Valley; 278 these are scalloped in profile. Superimposed globular forms have been recovered from the mounds of Louisiana,279 they are common also in the archaeology of Arkan- sas; 280 the little jar on pl. 120-h is from this area. The superimposed vessel with scalloped profile appears in the archaeology of Alabama; 281 it is common in that of Florida,282 and may be found as far north as Pennsylvania.283 Because Marajo vessel forms and those of the main- land north of Marajo are simpler than those of the Tapajo, the Mound superimposed types seem to cor- relate more closely with them than with the Tapaj o forms. In many respects the archaeology of the Dominican Republic suggests that this area might have served as a cultural link between southeastern United States and northeastern Brazil. Krieger figures two jars from Andres,284 superimposed in form but entirely native in decoration; these pieces appear similar to simple specimens in the Mounds and also seem related in form to pl. 118-b from the Oiapoque, and to pl. 118-f from Marajo. Superimposed forms combining various type of units appear in the archaeology of the west coast of South America. The profile is not always scalloped, but is usually so.285 276 Griffin, 1943: pls. 1-2, LXVI-1, LXIX-5. 277 Evers and Potter, 1880: pls. 1-23, 24, 3-19. 278 Holmes, 1903: pl.

In this area the units are often three in number, different in character, and decorated to emphasize their individ- uality.286 The profiles on these Argentinian pieces are sometimes irregular, and their design suggests no re- lation to the superimposed forms of the Tapajo. WHISTLES VITAMORPHIC A conspicuous element in Tapajo ceramics is the vitamorphic whistle. Naturally, a considerable pro- portion of them are modeled as bird representations, but there are aquatic forms and quadrupeds (figs. 3, 4) and a specimen depicting a pedestal figurine (pl. 68-e). Nordenski6ld records one anthropomorphic form.287 Holdridge reports having found small ocarinas in bird form on the Fazenda Laranjeiras on Marajo Island: these, he states, were capable of producing three or four notes.288 Musical instruments are not common in Marajo collections. In Venezuela vitamorphic whistle forms seem to have been less conspicuous than on the Lower Tapajos,289 but the number of whistles and ocarinas recovered at Santa Marta is considerable; these are modeled in both anthropomorphic and zoomorphic forms. Concerning them Mason states: 290 One of the outstanding characteristics of Santa Marta ceramics is the number, variety, and quality of pottery ocarinas and whistles. Numbers of complete or fragmen- tary specimens are found in almost every collection and 286 Ambrosetti, 1906: 2: figs. 46, 96, 98, 106; Debenedetti, 1910: figs. 77, 79, 81; Bruch, 1911: fig. 42; Bregante, 1926: figs. 9-6, 28, 32, 36, 50; Bennett, Bleiler, Sommer, 1946: fig. 12-b. 287 Nordenskiold, 1930: pl.

The ocarinas-whistles with finger-holes by which the sound is modulated and several tones produced-far outnumber the whistles of single note, and surpass the latter in size and beauty .... The archaeology of Chiriqui has produced a remark- able series of musical instruments including both whistles and ocarinas,291 but Lothrop remarks upon the fact that there are "no pottery whistles at all in Cocle." 292 In contrast, however, vitamorphic whistles are common in Veraguas. Lothrop describes them as follows: 293 Pottery whistles, a cultural element lacking in Cocle, are fairly common in Veraguas as well as in Chiriqui. In the lastnamed province, whistles are small effigies of many different shapes and, through the use of finger holes in the air chamber, they usually produce three notes. Veraguas whistles of this type . . . are comparatively rare. The holes in the solid necks of these specimens are for sus- pension rather than tone control. The common Veraguas whistle . . . is a double whistle which usually represents a bird. As it is not possible to tune them, each half usually gives a separate note. When there is a single hole in the mouthpiece, this discord cannot be controlled. When there are two openings, one can be closed with the tongue and either note may be blown. Both Lothrop and Hartman report vitamorphic whistle-forms from Costa Rica.294 While the number of whistles and whistle fragments in Tapajo collections is considerable, none that I have seen suggests the degree of instrumental development reported from Colombia, the Isthmus, and Costa Rica. Vitamorphic whistles have been reported from Uaxac- tun, Guatemala,295 and from the Bay Islands of British Honduras.296 Vitamorphic whistles and ocarinas have been recovered in Mexico,297 and Spinden, referring 291 MacCurdy, 1911: 169 ff., figs. 271, 272, 282 to 320. 292 Lothrop, 1937: 105. 293 Idem, 1950: 47, figs. 65-a to d, 66-a to f, 67-a to d. 294 Hartman, 1907: figs. 38, 39; Lothrop, 1926: pl.

The art of such peoples thus displays various traits, some of which may be old and basic to their culture, others may have evolved later, while still others may have been borrowed. However, over the period of growth and development divergent forms were modified and integrated into a specific pattern which became an expression of a way of life, a sense of beauty, and a mark of culture identity. In evaluating possible correlations between archae- ological areas, it is well to consider the selectivity of cultures. The fact that a people did not use a ceramic form is no indication that they were unfamiliar with it, they may have simply rejected it. The Tapajo seemingly did not make tripod vessels, although their neighbors on the north bank of the Amazon, with whom they traded, used the tripod. On the other hand, these tribes from the Trombetas-Nhamunda area accepted as structural units in their vessel design neither the caryatid nor the hollow rim, traits common in Tapajo pottery. The Tapajo seem to have adopted the hollow rim from the older and very different culture of Marajo Island; they even intensified the trait by inventing a hollow shoulder cylinder; this seems peculiar to their culture. Who were the bearers of the hollow rim technique from the older to the later civilization we do not yet know. A civilization located far from a major trade route has little opportunity to borrow; however, to a virile people, situated on a great highway, such opportunities are numerous. The Tapajo were established at the junction of the Tapajos, which penetrates twelve hundred miles to the south, and the Amazon which rises high in the Andes and makes its way across the continent to the Atlantic, receiving huge tributaries from the north and even greater ones from the south along its entire course. Tapajo pottery is easily identifiable on the bases of its form and decoration; yet certain types which are especially characteristic of the culture also suggest that their design represents a composite of the Tapajo decorative tradition and an ingenuity which incorpo- rated into the design elements from cultures by no means Amazonian. The Tapajo caryatid dish is unique in American archaeology; it has no counterpart any- where; yet it is composed of various cultural traditions. The support is medially constricted and annular, sug- gesting that it was derived from an area which used pottery stands to support round-bottomed vessels. The Tapajo did not make pottery stools and those of Marajo had flat tops and their sides were usually slanting. The caryatid was borrowed, seemingly in its fully developed form; Atlantean figures do not appear in Tapajo archaeology. The idea of three supporting figures was probably supplied by the tripod, which was not a Tapajo ceramic trait. The caryatid bowl with its shoulder decoration of Amazonian fauna having round-rimmed protuberant eyes is certainly the Tapajo's own contribution; however, the necks of these vessels are always inset in effect and often so constructed in actuality. As far as I have been able to ascertain, the only other area where the inset neck appears archaeologically is the southeastern United States. The superimposed form is certainly an old one; it was common in some areas, entirely lacking in others. In the southeastern United States the component parts of such vessels are clearly indicated as they often are also on Marajo Island; however, in Tapajo ceramics, sections are carefully interrelated, often merely sug- gesting a scalloped profile. The Tapajo shared the tradition of the four-lobed vessel with several civilizations to the north and the east of them, but they developed a distinctive form of it, usually zoomorphic, which could not be mistaken for that of any other culture. Throughout the Antilles, and in the adjacent regions of both continents, the sacred number was four.1 I first developed the idea that there might be some cultural relation between the southeastern United States and the Amazon from the little crescent-based female forms from the Mississippi Valley. As indicated on the correlation chart, the crescent-based figurines or small jars are conspicuous in some areas and entirely lacking in others. Each civilization where they appear presents them in its own stylistic ceramic tradition, but the basic form is common to all. Certain areas apparently did not accept the religious or other concept that these seated female figures represented, although it would seem that some, at least, must have been familiar with it. The figure from Arkansas illustrated on pl. 121-f is interesting in that it recalls Nordenski6old's reference to an idol worshipped by the Caribs of the Lower Oiapoque as reported by Harcourt. Nordenski6ld summarizes: Les recits de voyage de Robert Harcourt sont de plus haut interet pour les recherches archeologiques. II voyagea dans ces contrees en 1608. II rapporte, entre autres choses, ce qui lui fut conte par un indien Comarian: pres du rio Wiapoco superieur, habitait une tribu d'Indiens qui avaient de grandes oreilles. Ils possedaient une statue de pierre adoree comme un dieu. Ils l'avaient placee dans une maison construite en son honneur et entretenue avec beaucoup de soin. L'image de ce dieu avait la forme d'un homme assis sur les talons, avec les genoux ecartes, et les coudes appuyes sur eux. II avait les mains levees, les paumes en dehors. Le regard etait dirige en haut et la bouche largement ouverte.2 Within the historic period religious beliefs and the desire to find a "terre-sans-mal" have inspired long 1 Gower. 1927: 43. 2 Nordenskiold, 1930: 15.

Among others, Metraux recounts a journey across Amazonia: En 1549, les habitants de la ville de Chachapoyas au Perou firent prisonniers trois cents Indiens qui furent reconnus pour etre des Tupi de la c6te du Bresil. Pour autant que leur itineraire peut etre reconstitue d'apres les reseignements contradictoires de nos sources, ils auraient remonte l'Amazone depuis son embouchure jusqu'au Mara- n6n et ensuite, prenant le rio Huallaga, ils seraient arrives a Chachapoyas. Le rdcit qu'ils firent de leur aventure sus- cita un profond interet au Perou . . .3 Primitive man, like modern man, explored and traded in more than one direction; he also emigrated and established himself far from his place of origin; his sons may have ventured further still, lured by an ever-receding horizon. Thus new lands were dis- covered, traits carried, cultures merged. Map 6 figures the areas which seem to correlate archaeologically, with that of the Tapajo. It also suggests general routes by which culture may have passed between them and Santarem. More specific avenues may be traced on map 5 which indicates more in detail the network of water highways which char- acterizes the Amazon Valley and all of northern South America. In her discussion of the northern and southern affiliation of Antillean culture, Gower states: . . . The greatest distance between the islands in the Lesser Antilles lies between Trinidad and Grenada-about 78 miles. Otherwise the islands are never more than thirty miles apart, one often being visible from its neighbors. Between the larger islands to the north, distances are not great, though Jamaica is rather out of the way, a fact re- flected in the culture. The distance between Florida and the Bahamas is less considerable than that dividing the islands from the mainland to the south. Cuba's distance from Yucatan is large compared with the others, but . . . we have historical evidence to the effect that the Indian navigators accomplished even this distance for trading purposes.4 Definite correlation between Tapajo ceramics and those of areas to the west and to the south seems rare, although the Amazon's tributaries cut deeply into these regions. From the northwest the Magdalena and its long branches may have served as immigrant and trade routes to the south, while the Amazon's great north- western tributaries with their numerous affluents may have constituted a connecting, or almost-connecting, highway between the Magdalena and the Amazon proper. Santarem is far inland; however, it may be reached from the northeast coast by more than one continuous water route. The mighty Essequibo extends, like a long arm, southward through British Guiana and, like all large rivers in northeastern South America, its flow is interrupted at intervals by rapids and waterfalls; 3 M6traux, 1928: 213. 4 Gower, 1927: 7. its expanse is sometimes crowded by a confusing number of islands. At about half its length the Rupununi enters it from the west; this, too, is a con- siderable river, flowing during its lower course through a forested area, during its upper course, through broad grasslands. The Negro has an eastern tributary, the Branco; the Branco an eastern tributary, the Tacutuf; the Tacutui an eastern tributary, the Mau; the Mau has a small eastern tributary, the Pirara. The area between the Upper Rupununi and the Pirara, in the dry season, is a great savannah dotted over with a few round-topped mountains and broken by scattered depressions. This is the site of the legendary Lake Amuku or Parima, and of the golden city of El Dorado, Manoa. In 1878 Im Thurn walked across this grassy stretch, but when he returned, a few months later, the area was flooded, thus uniting the Essequibo system with that of the Amazon, and forming a con- tinuous highway between the mouths of the Essequibo and the Negro or even the Amazon itself.5 This route was first revealed to the Europeans by Hortsman in 1738; 6 however, it must have been long known to the Indian. The Taruma were reported on the Lower Rio Negro in 1657 7 and again in 1688, while in 1800 they made their appearance on the Essequibo.8 There is another direct river route from the Carib- bean to the Amazon, not scientifically confirmed to the Europeans until 1744,9 but probably well known to certain Indian tribes in northeastern South America in the pre-Columbian era. This course involves passage through the Cassiquiare, the great natural canal which connects the Upper Orinoco with the Upper Negro. It is believed that the Ursua expedition, setting out from Peru in 1560 in search of El Dorado and Omagua, and later commanded by the murderous Lope de Aguirre, followed this route, at least in part, to the Caribbean. This small army descended the Huallaga, entered the Marafion and traveled eastward, seemingly to the Japura which they ascended to an eastern tributary which connected with a western branch of the Negro; the few still alive then ascended the Negro; passed through the Cassiquiare to the Orinoco and thence to the coast.10 Rice states that the Cassiquiare, though a great highway, is sometimes too low even for canoe traffic.11 He also emphasized the difficulties and dangers of the Negro 12 but, in the season of high water, the route 5 Im Thurn, 1880: 465 ff.; Farabee, 1917: 6; Roth trans. and ed., 1922: 307. 6 Farabee, 1917: 8. 7Carvalho, 1952: 21. 8 Farabee, 1918: 135. 9 Rice, 1921: 323. 10 Bollaert, 1861: 1 ff.; 76, footnote.

Richard Schomburgk relates an interesting illustra- tion of the Indian disregard for distance. While he was at Pirara Landing, a group of Maiongkong Indians, who dwelt on the Upper Orinoco, arrived at his head- quarters. They were in need of axes and had heard that these important implements were available in Georgetown. Thereupon they ascended the Orinoco to the Cassiquiare, passed through that canal to the Rio Negro, descended the Rio Negro to the mouth of the Branco, traveled up the Branco and its tributaries to their most eastern extremity, crossed the grasslands, and were then preparing to enter the Rupununi to make their way to Georgetown by way of the Essequibo. The axes obtained, there was the long homeward journey to be negotiated. The correlation chart records patterns of cultural acceptance in the field of ceramics, as far as we are able to discern them from published material and from specimens in museum and private collections. Some traits indicated may be old in various areas, others 13 Dr. Aldridge Rodrigues Soares of the Comissao Brasileira Demarcadora de Limites, la Divisao, states that the length of the Cassiquiare Canal is 328 kilometers, its width at the Orinoco 80 meters, at the mouth of the Guainia, 1,100 meters. Jovita, letter, Sept. 11, 1958. may have developed later or been adopted. The picture, as we now have it, is only partial. We do not know who the Tapajo were or how long they had been on the Lower Amazon; of their language we have only a few words; most of the digging in the area has been done on an amateur basis. As previously stated, our best hope for reliable stratigraphical in- formation concerning the Tapajos Valley lies in the yet unpublished manuscript of Curt Nimuendajui, in the Ethnographical Museum of Gothenburg. The Tapajo culture must have been old enough to have had considerable ceramic experience, and it must have existed long enough to have developed a keen sense of cultural integrity, else it would not have expressed itself stylistically and ideologically so definitely and so independently. The Tapajo seemingly received several contributions from other cultures which they adapted to their own sense of beauty and utility; whether these were acquired through trade or through a series of migrations is, as yet, a problem. The story of the ancient cultures of northern Brazil will be slow in unfolding, and can never be more than partially known. For years, important archaeological specimens have been deliberately destroyed owing to superstition or to the lack of understanding of their scientific value; the Amazon has washed away sites which contained pottery of advanced technique, while the remains of civilizations of which we have historical record have not been located, although the jungle may yet yield some of them. The field is a great and tempting one and, as work progresses, correlation charts should be able to plot more accurately trade and migration routes and basic cultural affiliations.
