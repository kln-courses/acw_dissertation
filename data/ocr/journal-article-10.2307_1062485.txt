The list of this kind of work, which also includes essays written in Japanese, is especially impressive. Finally, Kitagawa has spent a great deal of time working on various committees, which in their own way serve scholar- ship. Especially important are the more than ten years during which he served as dean of the Divinity School of the University of Chicago. It makes a great deal of sense that such a festschrift as this was compiled not in honor of a birthday but at the end of Kitagawa's term as dean. To the congratulations of the volume's editors and contributors, I add my own heartfelt congratulations, and I wish Joseph Kitagawa many more years in which to continue the work that has been so important to us all. CARSTEN COLPE Free University of Berlin GOD IN ANCIENT EGYPT Conceptions of God in Ancient Egypt: The One and the Many. By ERIK HORNUNG. Translated by JOHN BAINES. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1982. Pp. 296. Erik Hornung's penetrating analysis of the Egyptian conception of god might even convince one that a polytheistic religion deserves to be called a great religion. Adopting a relativistic position, he avoids forcing Egyptian religion into a grand evolutionary scheme in the history of religion, and his study provides caveats to some of the generalists' models. Egyptian religion does not neatly fit some of the hypothesized developmental frameworks, such as the assumed gradual ascendancy of local gods via political processes and territorial accretion to the status of universal deities. Hornung presents some evidence for just the reverse process: the secondary localization of universal deities. One is also warned against making simple equations of cosmic gods with natural elements. While Hornung believes that it is impossible to assert the priority of fetishism over zoolatry, he does regard anthropomorphism as a later development, even though this assumes that the earliest Egyptians made a sharper generic distinction between animals and humans than is perhaps war- ranted and reflects Rudolf Otto's dated view of the numinous otherness of animals. With the exception of the Amarna period, Hornung denies the presence of monotheistic features in Egyptian religion and speaks rather in terms of henotheism, whereby a worshiper singles out some divinity on whom he focuses his attention and to whom he ascribes the highest attributes, without denying the existence of the pantheon. Only Akhenaten's short-lived religious reform, admirably treated by Hornung, witnessed a radical digression in which the multiplicity of deities was abandoned in favor of a sole deity, whose nature was articulated through the uniquely rational logic of the heretic pharaoh. 178</page><page sequence="2">History of Religions Reflecting Hornung's pioneering research into theological compositions from the royal tombs is his treatment of syncretism, which, after the manner of a chemical formula, produced such combinations of gods as Ptah-Sokar-Osiris without negating individual identities. Syncretism, ever increasing in popular- ity, in fact worked against any trend toward monotheism that henotheism might have aroused. True unity of two gods occurs only with the daily fusion of Re and Osiris in the underworld. This coalescing of the solar and chthonic is a principle of extreme importance for the understanding of Egyptian religion. Egyptian gods, according to Hornung, were finite, subject to birth and death. This even holds true for the creator, who arises from an undifferentiated pleroma. The very existence of the gods depends on diversification through the creative process. According to the Egyptians the world is surrounded spatially by an ever-threatening chaos. This negative chaos, symbolized by the arch- demon Apopis, also confines, according to Hornung, the existential order temporally, providing a beginning and end. Thus he regards Apopis as more immortal than the gods and states: "Evil is inherent in the nonexistent and hence is older than the gods and present in the world from the beginning" (p. 213). Here he is imparting greater negative value to precreation than is perhaps warranted. There are texts treating precreation more as a kind of positive monism, containing the potential energies involved in creation. In regard to man's sinfulness in the eyes of the creator, the famous Coffin Text passage cited on pages 198 and 213 should be translated more forcefully by, "I forbade them [mankind] to do wrong," rather than, "I did not ordain that they do wrong." While the eschaton might be viewed as a threat to created world order, it was not always totally negative, as, for example, in the final spell of the Book of Two Ways, where the end of all provides the means whereby the deceased, whose mummy lies literally on top of a diagram of the Two Ways, enters timelessness and his ba (roughly "soul") attains rebirth into the cycle of divine time. Here we might speak of paradigmatic eschatology, where the end of all serves as a model for the deceased's benefit. In fact, the earlier versions of creation, known from funerary contexts, are less explanations of origins than paradigms for the deceased's renewal. Although Hornung denies the existence of an absolute, transcendent god, he does use the term "transcendent" to describe the true nature of a god as distinct from his immanent form. While admitting that simple folk may have regarded the icon as true god, he assumes that theologians knew better: "No thinking Egyptian would have imagined that the true form of Amun was a man with a ram's head" (p. 124). Behind Hornung's thinking on the subject is his view that "careful differentiation is one of the most distinctive features of Egyptian thought" (p. 240), but this principle, which properly describes the creative process and the existential, seems misapplied here. The concept of comple- mentarity in Egyptian thought might be preferable in discussing this dichotomy. Hornung believes that in the Late period there may have been acceptance of the image as true god and states, "Now that primacy is given to the worship of visible images, the original ideas about the abode of the gods become greatly 179</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews simplified; that abode is now identical with the ordered world" (p. 230). But earlier texts also equate the microcosm of the temple with the macrocosm. Ramesses III's mortuary temple, for example, was not only celestial but also served as the dromos of gods of the underworld, providing a meeting place for the solar and chthonic. There is a serious question whether the priests in fact regarded the god's graven image as being less truly god as they carried out their primary responsi- bility of cultic tending of the images in the sanctuaries or as they participated in periodic public processions, when the god's image rendered oracles affecting the lives of the elite and the lowly. When Thutmose III describes his entrance into the roofed Holy of Holies at Karnak after his appointment to the throne by the oracle of Amun, his words do not suggest a clear differentiation of transcendent and immanent: [He (i.e., Amun) extended for] me the doors of heaven [i.e., the shrine]; He opened for me the portals of its horizon. It was as a divine falcon that I flew up to the sky. I beheld his image that is in the sky. In accounts of theophanies the deity may be described as an image, even made of precious materials. The daughters of Ramesses III in the High Gate at Medinet Habu speak of their father as being made of costly minerals, thereby exalting the king's divine status. The appearance of the divine image in procession is frequently likened to a celestial event, and the often-mentioned rejoicing by the populace on this occasion hardly supports Hornung's statement that "the believer ... lives in an unsatisfied longing to behold the 'perfection' (nfrw)-which often means the physical manifestation-of the god" (p. 135). Whereas Hornung concentrates on theological concepts, 1 would place greater emphasis on group reaction to the immanent presence of the divine in a temple setting, for here was the heaven on earth where gods and mortals, including kings, priests, officials, and humbler folk, interacted to the very end of the pagan religion. The basic communal nature of Egyptian religion, where the individual's beliefs were subordinated to those of the community, does raise some questions regarding Hornung's conception of the practice of religion in ancient Egypt. Were the supposedly sophisticated priests sanctioning a sham worship of graven images while really knowing that the icon was not true god? 1 do not wish to detract from the fundamental contributions made by Hornung in this study, but I believe that Egyptian religion may turn out to be an even greater religion in its avoidance of the dichotomy, transcendent versus immanent. With our low estimation of the concept of immanence of god, we moderns find it difficult to discern divine immanence, be it in sacrament, in nature, or even in our fellow man, something that the Egyptian was capable of doing when he stated, "I knew the god who is in people," a concept not fully explored by Hornung in his discussion on page 230. Conversely, of a god's human servitor who carries out certain prescribed instructions and recites from the Myth of the Heavenly Cow, we are informed, "It is said of him by people, 'He is like Re on the day when he is born,"' a passage reminiscent of Lucius's 180</page><page sequence="4">History of Religions public appearance in the likeness of the sun god after his initiation into the mysteries of Isis as described in The Golden Ass of Apuleius. It is not that "the material manifestation of God is necessarily grotesque" (p. 257, quoting Chris- tian Morgenstern) but that the nature of god remains a paradox, perhaps even more so than is implied in the book's subtitle. One has the suspicion that the remnants of Hegelian dialectics are to be found in Hornung's distinction between true god and his earthly manifestation. EDWARD F. WENTE University of Chicago Hsi-yu chi: THE JOURNEY COMPLETED The Journey to the West. Vols. 1-4. Translated and edited by ANTHONY C. Yu. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1977-83. The completion of Professor Anthony Yu's magnificent translation of the Hsi-yu chi is truly an occasion for celebration for all lovers of literature. It marks a supreme scholarly achievement and a milestone in the history of translations from Chinese literature.' Since the publication of volume 1 of The Journey to the West, critics and reviewers have been unanimous in their praise of Yu's conscientiousness as a translator in rendering all passages from the original-both prose and poetry, together with esoteric Buddhist and Taoist terminologies and references, some of which may prove too obscure even for contemporary Chinese readers.2 Their high expectations of the remaining volumes are now more than fulfilled: volumes 3 and 4, in particular, are meticulously done and shorn of the minor typographical errors which occa- sionally marred the first volume. The translation itself has not only maintained a steady lively flow from previous volumes but also attained a stylistic gran- deur as the narrative of the journey draws to a close. It should be pointed out for readers unfamiliar with the Chinese language that the Hsi-yu chi is not consistently written in the vernacular: while it is full of lively colloquial exchanges among the disciples, the narrative attains its epic quality and allegorical significance by a combination of vernacular and clas- sical styles. With its mixture of elite and folk motifs and much infusion of Buddhist and Taoist vocabularies, it is not an easy text to read, despite Hu Shih's somewhat irresponsible claim (in his introduction to Arthur Waley's much abridged translation of the novel Monkey) that the work's "good humor and profound nonsense" are intended primarily for the enjoyment of younger readers. The linguistic richness of the text presents a formidable challenge to the translator: I can well imagine Yu's own arduous journey as he struggled i The only comparable effort is David Hawkes's rendition of the first eighty chapters of the Hung-lou meng (The story of the stone), 3 vols. (Penguin Books and Indiana University Press). The remaining forty chapters are being translated by John Minton. 2See, for instance, C. T. Hsia's review in the New York Times (November 27, 1977). 181</page></plain_text>
