<plain_text><page sequence="1">ESSAY-REVIEWS SCIENCE Al TD METAPHYSICS Ili BIOLOGT. By J. H. Woodger, being a review of Logic and Law in Biology, by P. Chalmers Mitchell, C.B.E., D.Sc., F.R.S., etc. [Pp. 30.] (London : Macmillan &amp; Co., 1927. Price is. net.) In a survey of recent observations on anthropoid behaviour it is written : " Evidences of fatigue in the apes, especially in experimental situations which require novel adaptations of behaviour, have been noted by various observers. . . . Boutan states that mental work rapidly fatigues the gibbon and induces yawning and finally sleep, and Yerkes has made similar observations on the chimpanzee and other primates."1 Probably most people can confirm this observation so far as some " other primates " are concerned. Mr. Punch, in fact, would doubtless call it " another glimpse of the obvious," and the evolutionary biologist will have no difficulty in connecting it with the remark of Mr. Bertrand Russell to the effect that " Most people would rather die than think. In fact, they frequently do." In other words, fighting is more popular than thinking, because we have not yet got far enough from our simian ancestors. The celebrated saying of Samuel Johnson is still appropriate : " Were Socrates and Charles the Twelfth of Sweden both present in any company, and Socrates to say, ' Follow me, and hear a lecture in philosophy ' ; and Charles, laying his hand on his sword, to say, ' Follow me, and dethrone the Czar,' a man would be ashamed to follow Socrates. Sir, the impression is universal. . . ." Even in intellectual matters the fighting spirit in which emotion and rhetoric are given precedence over logic is preferred to disinterested think- ing. It is difficult to find any topic upon which men can unite. Everywhere is competition rather than co-operation. It is possible to take up an attitude of detachment, if that is one's preference, towards most questions, but there is one in regard to which this is not possible. Opinion, namely, is even divided about whether toleration is to be preferred to dogmatism. Some regard toleration as the height of enlightenment, and others as the height of feebleness and folly. But is it not one 1 R. M. Yerkes and M. S. Child, " Anthropoid Behaviour," Quart. Review of Biology, vol. ii, p. 44. 303</page><page sequence="2">304 SCIENCE PROGRESS of the glories of natural science that it confines itself to that realm of experience in which there is hope of finding common ground and agreement, and do we not feel that it should preserve an attitude of toleration rather than set up limits which will keep thought to one groove ? Huxley has said some- where that science commits suicide when it adopts a creed. Dr. Chalmers Mitchell, in the above Huxley Memorial Lecture, writes (p. 30) : " Philosophy, since she was judicially separated from science, although retaining the title ' lover of wisdom,' has made no positive addition to knowledge and has only been a spinner of vain words and barren ideas. How far the process will go I cannot guess. Personally, I doubt if the contained can ever comprehend the container, if the desire of man to comprehend the universe be more than a phase of anthropomorphic vanity. But hopefully we must pursue our hopeless task." Prof. A. N. Whitehead, on the other hand, writes : " To neglect philosophy when engaged in the re-formation of ideas is to assume the absolute correctness of the chance philosophic prejudices imbibed from a nurse or a schoolmaster or current modes of expression. It is to enact the part of those who thank Providence that they have been saved from the perplexities of religious inquiry by the happiness of birth in the true faith."1 Now if both these authors mean the same by the word " philosophy " they clearly contradict one another. If Dr. Mitchell is right Prof. Whitehead is mistaken in looking for help among the spinners of vain words and barren ideas. If Prof. Whitehead is correct Dr. Mitchell has been misled by chance prejudices imbibed from some untrustworthy source. Another possibility is that these two authors do not mean the same by the ambiguous word " philo- sophy." The interests covered by the term are so numerous and varied that it is possible that some may be of importance for the re-formation of scientific ideas and others not. One of the most depressing features of the modern learned world is the absence of intercommunication between its branches. If there are aspects of philosophy which are of importance to science then it would seem desirable that science should keep in touch with them, and judicial separation is a state to be deplored rather than one for congratulation. Isolation leads to ignorance, and ignorance is the best culture-medium for misunderstanding, distrust, and intolerance - indeed, for every virus which separates men and wastes our attempts to think. Dr. Mitchell's view illustrates one very common misunder- standing in regard to philosophy, the belief, namely, that philosophy is trying to do the same job as natural science and doing it badly by an inferior method. Also the notion that 1 The Principle of Relativity. Cambridge, 1922. P. 6.</page><page sequence="3">SCIENCE AND METAPHYSICS IN BIOLOGY 305 philosophy is occupied with " vain words and barren ideas " betrays a misunderstanding of the different functions of science and philosophy and their historical relations. Biological science has made us familiar with the notion of differentiation. We can legitimately extend it to political development and also to the evolution of thought. We might compare Greek thought with a fertilised ovum, with its " poten- cies," which has divided and differentiated to give us the highly complex texture of modern knowledge. But whereas in an organism differentiation and integration go hand in hand, this, unfortunately, is not the case with the development of thought, and here our analogy hopelessly breaks down. There is too much " self-differentiation " with no compensating " regulation." But it is just here that philosophy finds its niche. In one of its aspects it provides a critique of funda- mental ideas which is invaluable as a corrective to inco- ordinated differentiation along one line. Modern physics is undergoing a process which we might liken to " dedifferentia- tion " in so far as it involves a process of unpicking of the closed system of concepts which it has developed during the last three centuries, and an unsparing critical scrutiny of all its funda- mental notions. That system has been built upon the founda- tion of the common-sense ways of thinking of everyday life, a foundation which has been extraordinarily successful, but which is found to be inadequate in the spheres to which physics has now attained - so far are they removed from the conditions under which common-sense knowledge has been evolved. It is becoming recognised that common sense (in this meaning) is the greatest obstacle to clear thinking and it is here that philosophy comes into its own, because one of its tasks is to try to escape from the fetters placed upon thought by common sense and the egocentric predicament. This brings us back to that mental work which is so rapidly fatiguing to gibbons and other primates. Everything is against it; the marvel is that it ever happens at all. " Nothing is more congenial," wrote William James, " from babyhood to the end of life, than to be able to assimilate the new to the old, to meet each threatening violator or burster of our well-known series of concepts, as it comes in, see through its unwontedness and ticket it off as an old friend in disguise." Not only are there these individual or subjective factors against fresh think- ing, but also social ones - so-called " herd instincts," which keep thought in the wonted grooves. Is not the history of science filled with harrowing stories of the struggles of new ideas in the teeth of the opposition of tradition ? Another obstacle to change is success. The success of the simple notions of traditional mechanics is astounding. They have</page><page sequence="4">Ä¼o6 SCIENCE PROGRESS satisfied the requirements of physics for three centuries - no wonder they were regarded as keys to the very innermost secrets of nature - and so long as intellectual tools continue to receive fresh uses there is no stimulus to seek for new ones. Thus the four factors mentioned - natural laziness or simian reluctance, fondness of assimilating the new to the old, tradition and success - have contributed to keep our thought undeveloped. The periods of really intense intellectual ferment and tradition- shattering thinking have been extraordinarily few within the historical period. The thinking of Plato and Aristotle sufficed from Greek times to the Renaissance, and the thinking of Galileo and Descartes at the Renaissance has furnished natural science with a stock of fundamental notions that have needed little revision until recent times. Thus during most of the intervening times thinking has chiefly been a process of working out of the thoughts which issued from those two periods of successful overcoming of the limitations from which the primate intellect naturally suffers. One consequence of this has been that people have taken it for granted that the ways of thinking thus evolved are the only possible ones - witness Kant with his rigidly fixed number of a priori categories. Two primary modes of thought emerged from the Renaissance : that employed in physical and that employed in mental science. Between these two stools biology has fallen - now looking for aid in one direction, and now in another - instead of attempting to plough a furrow for itself. There appears to be little doubt that this accounts, in part at least, for the celebrated antithesis between mechanism and vitalism. It hardly seems to occur to anybody1 that there can be any other alternative, let alone several, and if any one ventures so much as to suggest such a thing he is invariably misunderstood and accused of harbouring secret prejudices in favour of one side or the other. Quite early in the last century it was discovered that, far from Euclid's geometry being the only possible one, it was possible for thought to rise above sen- suous intuition and devise others. It then became a problem to determine, if possible, which was the geometry of physical space, provided you know what you mean by the latter ex- pression - an embarrassing situation which had never presented itself before. The suggestion has been made that the same may be true of physics and that there may be more ways than one of interpreting physical facts if we had but the wit to discover them. Thus philosophy explores the realm of the possible, and natural science is a technique for determining which possibilities are actualised in the world of sense. The moral 1 Dr. J. S. Haldane seems to be an honourable exception, but the present writer does not profess to understand his view nor to represent it here.</page><page sequence="5">SCIENCE AND METAPHYSICS IN BIOLOGY 307 of all this should be fairly obvious for those who take a rather too naÃ¯ve view of biological theory, and were it not for that "differentiation without integration " above referred to, these modern tendencies would be better understood. Consider, therefore, the process of differentiation in a little more detail. Thought begins with data and ends with interpretation. But data are bewilderingly and intolerably varied and complex and furnish endlessly diverse possibilities of interpretation. We are compelled to simplify, and common sense is the mode of simplification devised by the genius of primitive man. Science and philosophy are both differentiated out of this. If you put the emphasis on sense data and on analytical modes of inter- pretation, in purposely circumscribed realms of fact, you have science. If the emphasis is on broader and synthetic inter- pretations - especially on those which attempt to embrace both sense data and introspective data - you have philosophy. But there is another possible line for thought, namely, the study of the interpretative process itself, a study which was begun by Locke although not clearly differentiated from psychology until much later. It is this line which has given us the flourishing modern science of epistemology, and it is this to which Prof. Whitehead refers in the passage quoted above, when he says that you cannot neglect philosophy when engaged on the re-formation of ideas. It is probably speculative philosophy to which Dr. Mitchell refers in such uncomplimentary terms, because this is the only kind of philosophy which is at all popular and is therefore the kind commonly understood by the term. Moreover, the latter kind is very frequently confused with science in its own speculative moods. It is here that differentiation is so important, and has progressed much further in some sciences than in others. Biology is still em- barrassed by the fact that biological thinkers have not yet clearly distinguished biological from related metaphysical problems. How is it possible to distinguish them ? It is extremely difficult because, as M. Meyerson says : " L'homme fait de la mÃ©taphysique comme il respire, sans le vouloir et surtout sans s'en douter la plupart du temps." 1 But we can try. In the first place the strong point of natural science has been its insistence upon verifiability. It is this demand which makes it possible for science to offer a body of doctrine upon which agreement is possible, so that it is a common possession resting upon brute fact. Here is a mark of difference, as well as an advantage, because metaphysical problems cannot be settled in this way. But if we confine scientific propositions to the verifiable we shall exclude from science all assertions about the remote past. Predictions are clearly in quite a different 1 E. Meyerson : De l'explication dans les sciences. Paris, 1921. P. 6.</page><page sequence="6">3o8 science progress position because if they are wrong there is a possibility of their being found to be so, but this is not possible in regard to past events. Assertions about the past can obviously only be based upon what we know at present, that is to say, they represent the present as the consequence of hypothetical past events conceived on the basis of present events known to have such consequences. This, of course, involves the assumption that such events did happen in the past and this is a reasonable assumption if it explains the present state of affairs. But this cannot be verified because you cannot, without circularity, appeal to the data that the theory is attempting to explain to verify the theory as well. Facts are very accommodating, but logic will not allow you to do that with them. We argue that fossils are the remains of extinct animals, because, coupled with geological data, we know that the bones of animals existing to-day are capable of being preserved for long periods. This is a more reasonable hypothesis than supposing that they were embedded in the rocks for the purpose of pulling the legs of geologists, be- cause at the present day such things are only done by school-boys at rare intervals, and there is no additional evidence that school- boys or equivalent malignant beings existed at the epochs in question. We give preference to the most probable hypothesis as judged from evidence available at the present day. Thus with suitable reservations it seems reasonable to admit such assertions to the rank of scientific hypotheses, more especially when there are positive empirical data to go upon. It is possible to make those reservations more precise from a con- sideration of the nature of inductive inference. Every obser- vation or experiment which is employed in an inductive inference is made under certain conditions which can be divided into three groups : (i) the essential conditions, those which cannot be absent if the event in question is to occur ; (2) the contingent conditions, which may be present or absent indiffer- ently ; and (3) those which have prevailed throughout the period during which human records have been kept and which are not under our control. Now it seems to follow from this that since we cannot tell whether instances of the third type of conditions are essential or contingent, no assertion about the past can be admitted as a scientific hypothesis if it involves the assumption of a departure, at a remote epoch, from condi- tions prevailing to-day, in order to make the hypothesis work. For the laws of nature as we know them to-day are valid only under the conditions prevailing to-day. No one knows what would happen if the laws of nature were different, and hence no scientific assertions can be made about hypothetical epochs in which they are supposed to have been different. Dr. Chalmers Mitchell devotes his lecture to an account of</page><page sequence="7">SCIENCE AND METAPHYSICS IN BIOLOGY 309 what he calls Huxley's " logical discipline " and to some of the consequences of the neglect of it by modern biologists. He summarises these principles as follows : " Accurate observa- tion, clear statement, a logical scrutiny of generalisations so that they should not imply and should not seem to imply an iota of necessity ; an open mind for new facts, but a cross- examination of the evidence for them the more ruthless in proportion to their apparent contradiction of widely based generalisations ; and, above all, a profession of ignorance in pre- ference to the propounding or acceptance of ' causal ' principles which could not be put to the test of experiment." If Huxley was more cautious than his contemporaries and so avoided making assertions which later investigations have contradicted it was because he was an epistemologist as well as a biologist and learnt his discipline from Locke and Hume. Dr. Mitchell gives four chief examples of " the evils in thought due to trans- gression of Huxley's canons " and to the extension of one gene- ralisation or another " beyond the sphere from which it was derived." First he describes what he regards as the illegitimate inferences made by the late William Bateson in his celebrated address at Melbourne. This is condemned as the result of a desire to press cytological and genetical generalisations beyond their scope " to a kind of miraculous preformation as definite as that discarded by Wolff." We shall return to this later. The second example is furnished by the attempt to employ the concept of hormones in the service of a Lamarckian inter- pretation of evolution - an attempt which seems to be nothing more than pangenesis in modern dress. It involves assump- tions which have not the remotest chance of verification at present, and is an example of the type of theory which has been far too common in biological speculation. The third example is " orthogenesis." Dr. Mitchell writes : " Osborn has spoken of orthogenesis as being due to an unknown law of hereditary predisposition, although he candidly admits that it may lead to extinction as well as to the elaboration of adaptive characters. It is a kind of biological Calvinism ; some stocks are vessels of wrath, predestined to damnation, others vessels of grace, pre- destined to such high achievements as, say, the alleged Nordic civilisation of the United States of North America. But it is not science." This seems to be a perfectly just criticism. An appeal to an " unknown law of hereditary predisposition " is perfectly useless for the purposes of science. It is a meta- physical not a scientific use of a concept. The last object of Dr. Mitchell's wrath is " emergent evolution," or at least the use made of it by Prof. Lloyd Morgan. Dr. Mitchell expresses the opinion that this concept is helpful " towards a materialistic interpretation of the phenomena of life in so far as it gives a</page><page sequence="8">3 io SCIENCE PROGRESS chemical and physical leg over difficult stiles." He accuses Prof. Lloyd Morgan of invoking it as "a justification of his view that the whole sweep of evolutionary advance may be attributed to Spiritual Agency." He even seems to suggest that Prof. Morgan is not sincere in his beliefs, when he speaks of " making due allowance for the troubles of a Gifford lecturer, anxious to keep in the open air of science and yet to temper its keen wind to the supposed theological opinions of my fellow- countrymen." Here Dr. Mitchell does not appear to have been so happy in his criticism. The Gifford Lectures were not founded for lecturers in natural science but, according to Lord Gifford 's will, for " Promoting, Advancing, Teaching and Diffusing the study of Natural Theology in the widest sense of that term," and they were to be delivered " without reference to or reliance upon any supposed special exceptional or so- called miraculous revelation." The first three of Dr. Mitchell's examples were scientific doctrines and could therefore be criticised from the standpoint of science, but the fourth does not profess to be a scientific doctrine but a metaphysical one. Consequently, in discussing it, we have definitely crossed the border between natural science and metaphysics, and it is beside the point to apply the same canons of criticism as we should if it offered itself as a contribution to biological theory. Dr. Mitchell evidently has a strong predilection for what he calls materialistic interpretations, and a strong dislike for theology, and consequently it is not surprising that he should feel little sympathy for Gifford lectures and the opinions of Prof. Lloyd Morgan, whose inclinations lie in another direction. We are here in a region remote from natural science because its demand for verification cannot be fulfilled and no discussion in the scientific sense is possible. But apart from this there seem to be directions in which Dr. Mitchell himself departs from the very principles he advo- cates, and falls into the same error which he wishes to expose in his first three examples. As a minor instance there is the statement on p. 27 : " Apart from all questions of theory, evolution, descent with modification, has been established as the mode in which plants, animals, and human beings have appeared on this earth." This is presumably a slip because " apart from all questions of theory " is hardly compatible with Huxley's demand that there should be no " iota of necessity." You cannot have your cake and eat it. Finally, Dr. Mitchell departs from his logical principles as much as the authors he quotes in giving scientific assent to the doctrine of an original abiogenesis. He admits that this is a depar- ture, but says : " The category of scientific faith must be reserved for speculations without a shadow of proof ; it is an</page><page sequence="9">SCIENCE AND METAPHYSICS IN BIOLOGY 311 honourable estate, and there is no merit in belief based on proof." Now it is difficult to harmonise this admission with Dr. Mitchell's strictures on Prof. Lloyd Morgan. Might not the latter also claim that his faith was an honourable estate ? Dr. Mitchell gives no explanation of how it is that faith is only honourable when it coincides with his own particular outlook. There must always be an element of faith in all empirical generalisations because proof in regard to them never means demonstrative certainty. What, then, are the criteria of merit in faith ? The pragmatisti test would be satisfied with a faith which could move mountains, but what can we do with Dr. Mitchell's belief? If it is urged that it furnishes an inspiration to bio- chemists to try to repeat the performance in their own labora- tories, then it would have so much pragmatic justification, but it is difficult to take seriously the suggestion that biochemists are such feeble-minded people that they have no other spur or interest in their work than is furnished by this. To say that such beliefs are necessary for the prosecution of research is to imply that no biochemist is capable of synthesising any com- pound unless he believes that it has synthesised itself in the past, which is manifestly absurd. Dr. Mitchell says that : "We are still far from having a causal explanation of the evolution of living matter from the inorganic." But he has insisted that Huxley's canons require " a profession of ignorance in preference to the propounding or acceptance of ' causal ' principles which could not be put to the test of experiment." What he means by saying that we have not yet got a causal explanation of the evolution of living matter from the inorganic is, presumably, that no one has yet succeeded in bringing about such a state of affairs that it will happen to-day, and that consequently we have no grounds at present for saying that, since it happens to-day under such and such conditions, and since there is reason to believe that such conditions were realised in the past, it is therefore reasonable to suppose that such was the mode of origin of living things. This is all that one can mean by a causal explanation of such an event. But it is just the absence of this information which distinguishes this theory from the other theories about the remote past which have already been referred to, and it is the absence of this information which places this theory in just the same position as the theories of orthogenesis and the hor- mone theory of evolution which Dr. Mitchell criticises. We are no longer arguing from the present to the past, but are con- demned to ask that the past shall have been sufficiently different from the present to allow us to assert of it what our present knowledge does not permit. But when once this licence is admitted anyone is free to suppose whatever he chooses, and</page><page sequence="10">312 SCIENCE PROGRESS there is no way of deciding between one opinion and another. We have left the realm of science and entered one which Dr. Mitchell condemns. He has himself said that where biology has departed from the principles he enunciated at the beginning " it has been barren of additions to knowledge, fertile only in vain words." If this is true of the hormone theory of evolution it is equally true of abiogenesis ; and if abiogenesis is excused on the ground that it encourages research the hormone theory can claim precisely the same defence. The first generalisation which this doctrine of abiogenesis contradicts is that which asserts that every living thing arises from some other living thing. If we try to project this back into the past we contradict the geological theories which require that the earth was once molten and at a high temperature. If we suppose that organisms existed at such temperatures we contradict another well-established biological generalisation. If we suppose organisms to have existed then which could survive high temperatures, then we can make no scientific assertions about them. We are driven then either to abio- genesis or to supposing that organisms came to our planet from elsewhere. For neither of these suppositions is there any support in our experience. But just as it is open to anyone to suppose that germs came to our planet from elsewhere and may still be doing so, it is also open to anyone to suppose that abiogenesis occurred once and is still going on undetected. The latter alternative was adopted by Prof. Shafer in his British Association Address in 191 2. All that can be said of this supposition is : If you assume that abiogenesis has been going on throughout the period of the earth's history during which it has been capable of supporting living things, then at once you make mincemeat of all our phylogenetic theories, and this is a consequence which naturally will not trouble a physiologist. This assumption, then, is one which may encourage its sup- porters with the hope of a future verification, but preserves its plausibility only at the cost of forgetting one half of biological science - a thing which is very easy for a biochemist to do. The only other alternative left is to postulate a unique occurrence under conditions when the laws of nature were sufficiently different from what they are now to allow that to happen which we want to suppose did happen and this, as Dr. Mitchell says of Osborn's orthogenesis, is not science. It is basing your scientific beliefs on metaphysical ones. Science discovers biogenesis ; metaphysics wants abiogenesis, therefore it is assumed that abiogenesis must have happened. What makes abiogenesis seem scientific is the fact, not that it is in harmony with what we know about organisms as such, but that human thought and skill have successfully combined</page><page sequence="11">SCIENCE AND METAPHYSICS IN BIOLOGY 313 to synthesise organic compounds not otherwise occurring in nature apart from living things, although what is thereby synthesised does not admit of the predicate " living." The next step is smoothed over in thought by the incautious use of the concepts " protoplasm " or " living matter." These, from the point of view of the problem in question, are question- begging terms. They are names for genuine abstractions, otherwise they would not have survived. But, nevertheless, what we find in nature are not bits of protoplasm but individual living things. We can, if it is useful to do so, abstract from all the diversity of things in a cell, and from all the diverse kinds of cells, and think of a common stuff from which they are all made. But we know there is no such stuff. There is every reason to believe that in a given cell there is enormous com- plexity of different stuffs organised in a hierarchy of formed bodies. If the usual interpretation of the chromosome theory of heredity is true, even a single chromosome will contain an enormous number of different and highly specific entities. And yet in spite of all this it is commonly stated that the " proto- plasm " of animals and plants is identical! The nearest approach we ever make to protoplasm is in the mixture ob- tained by grinding up cells with sand in a mortar, in which all organisation above the chemical level is destroyed. There does not appear to be any insuperable difficulty in the way of any- one some day concocting such a mixture, but it can hardly be expected to support the predicate " living " any more than the ground-up mass it imitates. In other words, whoever sets out to synthesise " life " (to use a popular expression) will have to give his mixture an organisation above the chemical level of integration. He will have to synthesise an organism, not protoplasm. Moreover, if he has to exercise thought to accomplish this, and if this is to explain an original abiogenesis, he will also, if he is to carry out the analogy fairly and con- sistently, have to postulate the intervention of thought in the original abiogenesis - a requirement with which Dr. Mitchell would probably decline to comply, since it could easily be pressed into the service of theology. But all these difficulties pale into significance if we look at the arguments used by those who attempt to carry out the speculation in detail. We find that they all involve, if they are to work at all, putting into the original hypothetical chemical compound all the properties of living things as we know them now. The obvious difficulty is to get your organism to start at all. When once this is done, and the thing has got the known properties of organisms, then you can appeal to any of the current theories of evolution, according to taste, to do the rest. But in order to do this, you either have to endow chemical</page><page sequence="12">314 SCIENCE PROGRESS compounds with all manner of mystical properties, which they are not known to possess, or you have to talk vaguely of such abstractions as protoplasm. All these difficulties appear to rest on the fact that such a process as evolution violates all our traditional ways of thinking, and calls loudly for a revision of our fundamental ideas. This can be most easily understood from the following considerations. Two ova from two different species develop in the same pond into quite different organisms. To " account for " this we telescope these differences back into the original starting point, i.e. into the undivided ovum, in the form of " potencies " conceived in one way or another. No difficulty arises about the origin of such things because we can always appeal to a previous generation from which they were derived. This is the recourse to which we are driven by the difficulties we experience in conceiving, with our present notions, how manifest complexity can arise from apparent simplicity. Now when we get back to such a beginning as is contemplated by the doctrine of abiogenesis this device is denied us, unless we are prepared to endow atoms and molecules with such potencies. This is the difficulty which Bateson presented in his Melbourne Address. Bateson was one of the most penetrating and critical thinkers biology has so far possessed, and a perusal of his books shows him always able to grasp the essentials of biological problems, to state them clearly, and leave them so rather than to obscure difficulties by camouflaging them in speculations which flatter what Dr. Mitchell calls our " anthropomorphic vanity," but which make " no positive addition to knowledge." We can therefore either accept Bateson's preformation and the premises on which it rests, or we can regard the Batesonian preformation as a reductio ad absurdum, of those premises, but we cannot keep the premises and reject the preformation. In just the same way we can regard Hume's scepticism as a refutation of the atomistic psychological assumptions upon which it all hangs, or we can accept those assumptions and with them the scepti- cism. But we cannot keep the assumptions and escape the scepticism. The above arguments are not offered as a refutation of abiogenesis. That theory may very well be true. But the considerations here brought forward, and many others not mentioned, do suggest that the implications of the doctrine have not been properly appreciated by biologists, and that a re-formation of our fundamental ideas is as much needed in biological as in physical science. Indeed, a mathematical physicist has already pointed this out to our shame, and has suggested directions in which we may look for light if we are prepared to put our biological pride in our pockets. Prof.</page><page sequence="13">SCIENCE AND METAPHYSICS IN BIOLOGY 315 Whitehead, speaking of the rise of evolutionary notions during the last century, writes : " By a blindness which is almost judicial as being a penalty affixed to hasty, superficial thinking, many religious thinkers opposed the new doctrine ; although, in truth, a thoroughgoing evolutionary philosophy is inconsistent with materialism. The aboriginal stuff, or material from which a materialistic philo- sophy starts, is incapable of evolution. This material is in itself the ultimate substance. Evolution, on the materialistic theory, is reduced to the rÃ´le of being another word for the description of the changes of the external relations between portions of matter. There is nothing to evolve, because one set of external relations is as good as any other set of external relations. There can merely be change, purposeless and unprogressive. But the whole point of the modern doctrine is the evolution of the complex organisms from antecedent states of less complex organisms. The doctrine thus cries aloud for a conception of organism as fundamental for nature."1 Thus the scientific thinkers who accepted evolution under- stood its implications as little as the religious thinkers who opposed it. They have persisted in trying to pour the new wine into the old bottles. Far from modern biology having any " conception of organism " its aim seems to be to try to get as far away from it as possible and to substitute such abstractions as protoplasm or ' ' living matter. ' ' Thought can only work with abstractions, but the question is : have we yet discovered what are the right kind of abstractions for biological thinking ? Speak- ing of the history of the natural sciences, Dr. Broad has said : " They flounder about in the dark till some man of genius sees what are the really fundamental factors and the really fundamental structures of the region of phenomena under investigation. In mechanics the keystone is the notion of acceleration ; in chemistry it is the theory of elements and compounds and the conservation of mass ; in economics, per- haps, it is the notion of marginal utility. Sciences where no such discovery has yet been made, such, e.g. as psychology and biology, are almost at a prescientific level ; their inductions carry no great conviction to anyone trained in the more ad- vanced sciences." * Is anything in the nature of a renaissance in biological thinking possible ? It would seem at first sight that Mr. J. 1 Science and the Modern World . Cambridge, 1927. P. 134. 1 C. D. Broad: "The Relation between Induction and Probability," Mind t vol. xxix, p. 45.</page><page sequence="14">316 SCIENCE PROGRESS Needham, in a recent article,1 was arguing that any change in scientific biology was impossible. But Mr. Needham appears to use the term " science " in a very restricted, and " philosophy " in a very wide, sense. By science he seems to mean simply the activity of investigation itself, and by philosophy the theoretical interpretations reached by thought reflection on the facts which are the outcome of investigation. But Mr. Needham is one of those thinkers who believe in thought-tight divisions, and he wishes to interpret the speculations of Prof. Lloyd Morgan and of Prof. Whitehead, in his later books,' in favour of an un- changing biological methodology but with a biological philo- sophy which would otherwise flatly contradict it. The thinking of the investigator, he seems to suggest, is eternally condemned to run in one unalterable groove. Only to the philosopher is it granted to dwell in another sphere and understand something of their subtle connection. In his former writings Mr. Needham was content fo exclude the organism from philosophy and to endure the absence of all connection between the latter and science. What he says in his recent article about the investigator is extremely good and profoundly true, but he has made the situation appear more simple than it is. He passes too lightly from the proposition that the traditional methodology is success- fully applicable to every sphere of natural science (which no one in his senses would deny) to the much more debatable suggestion that it is the only possible one. Many people have been puzzled by the apparent contradiction between Dr. J. S. Haldane's " methodological vitalism," as it has been called, and his actual practice. But they do not appear to have noticed that he has been guided by his theoretical views to approach the study of respiration in a way which led to discoveries which his pre- decessors had missed. This is clear from a passage at the close of chapter i, p. 14, of his Respiration. Instances could be given from other investigators who have been guided in a similar way although they have not so frankly faced the issue as Dr. Haldane has done. It cannot, therefore, be claimed that what we may shortly call an " organic " approach to biological problems, as opposed to a purely analytical one, is entirely without heuristic merit. Mr. Needham seems to suggest that the relation between science and philosophy is a purely " asym- metrical " one. Philosophy, in his sense, is to work with the data obtained by science, but the latter is to remain uninfluenced by what philosophy may do with them. It has certainly not been so in the past because the only philosophy which science 1 " Organicism in Biology," Journ. Philos . Studies , vol. iii, p. 37. 2 It should be noted that Profs. Whitehead and Lloyd Morgan diverge on many fundamental points, especially on theory of knowledge and the relation of mind to nature.</page><page sequence="15">SCIENCE AND METAPHYSICS IN BIOLOGY 317 has taken any heed of has been its own, namely, the traditional materialism, and this has naturally kept its methodology in one groove. But if that philosophy is now beginning to crack up, even in the eyes of physicists, it is not for speculative reasons but because it is beginning to fail methodologically. That this is so seems clear from the following passage in a book by Prof. P. W. Bridgman, which is written, be it noted, from a purely empirical standpoint. As a lesson in disinterested thinking and in the method of overcoming " chance philosophical prejudices " it is a book which every biologist would do well to read. "It is difficult to conceive anything more scientifically bigoted than to postulate that all possible experience conforms to the same type as that with which we are already familiar, and therefore to demand that explanation use only elements familiar in every-day experience. Such an attitude bespeaks an unimaginativeness, a mental obtuseness and obstinacy, which might be expected to have exhausted their pragmatic justification at a lower plane of mental activity. " Although it will probably be fairly easy to give intellectual assent to the strictures of the last paragraph, I believe many will discover in themselves a longing for mechanical explanation which has all the tenacity of original sin. The discovery of such a desire need not occasion any particular alarm, because it is easy to see how the demand for this sort of explanation has had its origin in the enormous preponderance of the mechanical in our physical experience. But nevertheless, just as the old monks struggled to subdue the flesh, so must the physicist struggle to subdue this sometimes nearly irresistible, but perfectly unjustifiable, desire."1 What superb intellectual detachment 1 What an inspira- tion for every biologist who claims to have any vestige of mental elasticity I ! But if Mr. Needham is correct Prof. Bridgman is doing no less than bidding every investigator in natural science to murder the goose that lays the golden eggs. But Mr. Needham appears to be bidding science to adopt a creed, and that, according to Huxley, is to commit suicide. Dean Inge also asserts that science musi be monistic. But we look in vain for any justification for the must in these authors' pages. Surely science, in the wide sense, is at liberty to be just as pluralistic as it suits its convenience to be. If Mr. Needham would approach the problem more from the epistemological and empirical standpoint, as Prof. Bridgman does, he would, perhaps, see it in a different light. The best attitude for science seems to be not to tie itself up with any one constructive or metaphysical scheme. The supposed necessity for monism in 1 The Logic of Modern Physics. New York, 1927. P. 46. 21</page><page sequence="16">318 SCIENCE PROGRESS science may rest on nothing more than a psychological kink, like our fondness for dyadic relations. And if by taking thought we can remove such limitations so much the better. We have noted the contradictions into which Dr. Mitchell has been led by his materialistic monism - denying, as he does, to others, speculations of the same logical type as those in which he indulges himself. Huxley's discipline is easy to prescribe but difficult to follow. What, then, are we to do in the midst of all these conflicts and inconsistencies ? This brings us back to our starting point - to our simian ancestry, our preference for fighting rather than thinking, for competition rather than co-operation, for dogmatism rather than tolerance. All these characteristics appear to rest on our persistent adherence to absolutism and mutually exclusive interpretations. Far from welcoming many alternative interpretations, we want this or that one to be the interpretation. Dr. Mitchell is not satisfied that materialism has furnished us with a fruitful methodology ; he wants to believe that the whole world consists of, and can be exhaustively interpreted as, a collection of little bits of stuff pushing each other about - a notion derived, as Prof. Bridgman says, from everyday experience. It is one to be used intelli- gently but not to be adhered to with all the tenacity of original sin. Every such notion has its " field," but there are many fields, even in what is called nature, and to suppose that we already possess one mode of thinking which covers them all, and to scorn all contrary opinions, seems to be the height of " anthropomorphic vanity." When we consider how brief has been the history of human thought, and how much briefer still the life of natural science ; when we remember that the latter is only one part of the whole field of intellectual inquiry ; when, further, we reflect that our experience has been limited to only one part of the vast scale of magnitudes, and only one part of the universe during a brief period of its existence ; when we recall, too, that during that period our thought has been dominated by but few fundamental notions derived, for the most part, from the still more limited field of daily life ; then, it seems to be the height of folly to suppose that any one of our constructive schemes, however comprehensive and carefully elaborated, or however well rooted in our experience, can be even approximately true and exhaustive of what we know, still less that it entitles us to suppose that there are no further surprises in store for us. The most hopeful suggestion seems to be, then, that there are many " fields," and that whilst we are indebted to a few men of genius for finding the right concepts for some of them, it would be better in biology not to persist in stretching our old ideas beyond their original fields until they become so thin as</page><page sequence="17">FUNDAMENTALS 319 barely to conceal the ignorance they cover. It is rarely a question : can a given concept be used in a particular field, but, are we justified in asserting it to be the only one that can be profitably used ? Thus if we change our attitude towards scientific concepts, we see that there is need, not for competition among them, but co-operation, room for mutual supplementa- tion but not for mutual exclusion. We shall be free then to demand " that reason should be used," as Whitehead says, and that the " ape and tiger " be allowed to die.</page></plain_text>
