<plain_text><page sequence="1">RIVER CLAIMING ITS DUE &amp; THE SOD OF DEATH PREDESTINED (ML 4050 &amp; MLSIT 4051) Two legends of fate in Irish tradition BARRY O'REILLY I This paper will deal with two legends whose central theme is a fatalistic concept of death. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines fate as: 'The principle, power, or agency by which events are unalterably predetermined from eternity'. In oral tradition, the concept is well summed up in the following statement (IFC 986:416), here translated from the Irish: 'If people heard at any time that somebody had died or anything like that, they would say: "Oh.! That's what was in store for the poor person - that's what was probably ahead of him. His time was up"' (Ba e sin fdd a bhdis; literally That was his sod of death'). We have in Ireland, a significant body of lore associated with fate and prophecy. This lore includes stories of the 'poor scholar' who can prophesy death, stories of children destined to die before they reach a certain age, and omens and supernatural beings whose appearance is said to presage death. Within the framework of this body of material belong our two legends, River Claiming its Due and The Sod of Death Predestined. Both these legend types have mainly been collected in Irish-speaking districts of the West. So far ten variants of River Claiming its Due and ten variants of The Sod of Death Predestined have been recorded (cf. O'Reilly 1985). The core of the two legends is the same: A person in a certain place hears a voice prophesy his death. Precautions are taken to prevent fulfilment of this prophecy, but to no avail.' 1 Only two variants (Sampson 1892, 23 and Macalister 1937, 147-9), both of the River Claiming its Due have a happy ending. 83</page><page sequence="2">84 BARRY O'REILLY II River Claiming its Due has been treated in its European context by Robert Wildhaber (1958) and is first known from Gervase of Tilbury's work Otia Imperialia written in the year 1211. It is possible that it spread from southern France to Britain and Ireland as Wildhaber has argued. The legend is rooted in two particular concepts, fatalism and the concept of rivers and lakes periodically 'claiming' a quota of victims. Commenting upon a statement by John Lubbock that 'The savage accounts for all movement by life ...', Mac Kinley (1896, 69) says: If movement could be explained by life, then what was more fitting than that the movement of a river was due to its life? ... Under the influence of a crude anthropomorphism, they thought of a river as a creature hungering, or rather thirsting, for their lives, and only waiting for a chance to secure a victim... The personification of the water spirit is evident throughout Europe. In Scottish lore, it is often called a 'kelpie'. In Ireland, the River Boyne is said to be the abode of a red man with a winding-sheet around his head who rises half out of the water when a man is going to drown (Mac Kinley 1896, 71 and Macalister 1937, 147). There are a number of rivers in Ireland and Scotland which are said to 'claim' a specified number of victims at particular times. The Blackwater at Fermoy claims three every year (IFC 42:134) as does the Boyne (IFC S 696:152). At the Comeragh Lakes in Co. Waterford a white horse is said to come up once every seven years, a short time before a drowning (IFC 259:483). Lough Rea, Co. Galway, is also said to claim a victim every seven years2; a mid-nineteenth century account speaks of the appearance of a large black coffin on the surface of this lake (O'Hanlon 1851, 676).

Limerick, is said to claim a victim every seven years,3 as does the Grand Canal at Ferbane, Co. Offaly.' It is clear that this latter claim cannot go farther back than the construction of the canal during the first half of the last century. The Barrow5 and the Bandon (Sargent 1921, 425) are each said to claim one victim a year. The most frequent death claim from Irish rivers and lakes is one victim every seventh year or three every year. Rhymes have occasionally been composed about some rivers and their craving for victims: Blood-thirsty Dee each year needs three; But bonny Don, she needs none (Mac Kinley 1896, 74-5). The River Blackwater's claim of three victims per year is said to have begun after Cromwell's soldiers '... came down on the abbey [in Fermoy] and drove all the monks into the river so that every one of them was drowned' (IFC 42:134). The Sullane River in the vicinity of Macroom, Co. Cork, has attracted a great deal of lore of this kind. It, too, is said to utter a rhyme: Mise an Sulacn, fuar fada fireann; anois an t-am, cac bhfuil an duine? ['I am the Sullane, cold, long and masculine; the time has come, where is the person?']6 The latter part of this rhyme, the formula 'the time has come, where is the person?' is the conventional expression of the river's desire for a victim. Christiansen in The Migratory Legends has assigned the Type Number 4050, River Claiming Its Due. 'The hour has come but not the man' to this legend and summarizes it as follows: 3 Information from Dr D?ith? ? h?g?in, DIF, 1985. 4 Information from James G. Delaney, DIF, 1985. 5 Information from Dr Kevin Whelan, UCD 1985. 6 It is important to note that very few Irish rivers are of masculine gender in the Irish language.</page><page sequence="4">86 BARRY O'REILLY At a certain place (Al), somebody (A2) heard from a river (A3a) or a lake (A3b) a shout: 'The hour has come but not the man' (A4). Soon afterwards a person arrived (Bi) in great haste, wanting to cross the river (B2). Steps were taken to prevent him by force (B3), on the advice of somebody present (B4). The man, however, expired (Cl) when touching water brought from the river (C2), or being unexpectedly drowned in a shallow part when attempting to cross (C3), or he died in the hands of those who had held him back (C4). In some versions, parts B and C are missing, and it is only said that soon afterwards a person was drowned at the very place (D). A translation of a representative example of the legend (IFC 366:310-1), recorded in Co. Donegal in the 1930s goes as follows: Once there was a man who came to know that he would drown when he reached a certain age: and when that day came, his wife said to him: 'Well,' said she, 'stay with me here,' said she. 'I need you here,' said she, 'bend down your head,' said she, 'so that I can comb your hair.' He laid his head on his wife's knee and the river started to shout: 'The time has come, but not the man. The time has come but not the man.' When the time had passed, she asked him to raise his head. He had drowned in his own sweat. Scandinavian variants of the legend are quite similar to this. The following is a translation (Lindow 1978, 64) of a variant recorded in southern Sweden about the same time as the Irish one just quoted: In Backsedasjon a cry was once heard. The hour is come, but not the man'. The people from Bratakra were there on the beach. A while later a man came by and asked the way to Drakulla. He wanted to cross the lake. People said, 'You mustn't go over the lake. Stay here tonight.'</page><page sequence="5">RIVER CLAIMING ITS DUE 87 'I can't,' he said. 'You mustn't go over the lake under any circumstances - if you do you'll drown.' They got him inside and he agreed to stay. They warmed a room specially for him and took up a stone tray with the wash basin on it at night. The next morning, when they came up, he lay face down on the tray and was dead. There was nothing to do about it. He was to drown in water no matter what. The hour had come. The main points of difference between the Irish and the Norwegian variants outlined by Christiansen are: 1 In the Irish variants the victim is often introduced before the fatal voice is heard and has prior knowledge of his fate; 2 In some Irish variants the voice is heard from the air rather than from the water; 3 In most Irish variants the man is coaxed into staying away from the dangerous spot while brute force is more often employed in the Scandinavian variants; 4 However, in none of the Irish accounts, strangely enough, is the victim drowned in the river or in water from the river. Instead the liquid in which the man drowns varies from holy water or a vat of milk to the victim's own sweat or vomit; 5 In about half of the Irish accounts the river's call is heard twice or three times, a trait to which I have found no correspondence in Norwegian material. Two variants of the legend, both recorded in the Shelta language in the early 1890s (see note 1 above) have an untypical ending - the man in danger does not die. In one of these, that recorded by Macalister, the rescuers receive a monetary reward.</page><page sequence="6">88 BARRY O'REILLY III The Sod of Death Predestined goes as follows in a Kerry variant recorded in the 1930s (IFC 126:178-9) and given here in translation: There was a man who was stretched out by the brink of the sea one fine sunny day. A voice spoke above him and said: 'This is the sod of your death.' He marked out its length and breadth and he took a spade and cut out the sod and threw it down into the sea. A good while after that, he was in a little house by the sea - a fair bit from the place where he had cut the sod before - sitting on a small bench made of sticks covered with a sod, when the voice spoke again: 'That is the sod of your death.' He asked the man of the house where he got that sod that he had put on the bench. 'I got it down on the shore, thrown in by the tide and when I had dried it, I took it with me and put it in this bench.' 'Oh, there is no escape for me,' says the man who heard the voice as he laid down and died as God ordained, glory be to Him. The basic plot of The Sod of Death Predestined and River Claiming its Due is remarkably similar. At a certain place (river or sod), somebody hears a voice calling out a fatal message: 'The hour has come but not the man' or 'That is the sod of your death'. Attempts are made to neutralize this portent (by confining the intended victim in a place of apparent safety or disposing of the sod in the sea). Nevertheless, the man dies (on his coming into contact with some form of liquid or with the sod of death). The two narratives differ, however, on a couple of points: 1 The origin of the mysterious voice in The Sod of Death Predestined is more varied than in River Claiming its Due - sometimes spoken by the sod itself, sometimes by a voice above the man, sometimes by a strange-looking man, a bird, or a sprig of heather;</page><page sequence="7">RIVER CLAIMING ITS DUE 89 2 In The Sod of Death Predestined, the victim is cast in a less passive role than in River Claiming its Due, and feels that he can avert the danger, though, of course, he only succeeds in postponing his inexorable fate. When the sod of death reappears, the victim resigns himself to this fate and calmly awaits the moment of death. The element of anguish and struggle characterising River Claiming its Due is absent. The concept of f6d bais ['sod of death'] has been examined by Carney (1957) and by Holtsmark (1962). Both recognised the relationship between the Irish expression and its Old Norse and Swedish correspondences. In Dinneen's and 0 Donaill's Irish-English dictionaries the phrase is given as meaning'the place where one is fated to die'. Carney pointed out that the word doatuva in a Swedish account of River Claiming its Due discussed by Dag Stromback (1929), carries exactly the same connotation as f6d bdis does in the Irish material. Carney also listed a number of occurrences of the phrase in Irish mediaeval literature - in the single combat scene between Cu Chulainn and Fer Diad and in religious poems from the seventh to tenth centuries, and it is also found in a religious poem from about the year 1600. Furthermore, Manus O'Donnell's fifteenth-century life of St. Colmcille includes a narrative which bears a likeness to River Claiming its Due. It translates as follows (O'Kelleher and Schoepperle 1918, 103): 'Lo the youth runneth towards the sod of his death,' saith Colmcille, 'and do you seize him and suffer him not to reach that sod.' Forthwith, the household of Colmcille laid hold on the youth and suffered him not to proceed. Anon they beheld the sod running toward them; and it came under the feet of the youth; and no sooner came it thereunder than he died. A Scottish account of the sod of death shows strong similarities to the Colmcille episode. It concerns a man called Macantompanich whose three sons fought in a great battle.</page><page sequence="8">90 BARRY O'REILLY They survived, but had to hide at night amongst the dead, in order to escape from a 'creature'. The creature found them and prophesied where each son would die. One was to meet his end in Rome, a second in France and a third in Ireland. The first two died as prophesied. However, the third would on no account travel to Ireland. Eventually, a cattle boat came from Ireland. During off-loading, sods of earth were thrown off the vessel. This was in the same port as the third son found himself. He felt the pangs of death coming upon him and said: 'I did not reach the sod, but the sod reached me.' He stretched himself upon the sods and yielded his last breath, dying on Irish ground, as prophesied (Bede 1965,134-5). IV As far as our present knowledge goes, it would seem that The Sod of Death Predestined is a legend with old roots in Irish tradition, while its occurrence elsewhere (except for Scotland) has not been noted. On the other hand, River Claiminig its Due, a legend which enjoys a wide European distribution, cannot on available evidence be shown to be of equally long standing in Irish tradition. The Irish variants would seem to support the thesis put forward by Brednich (1964, 105) that the type River Claiming its Due is distinct from the story termed by him AT 934A*, Tod durch Ertrinken. However, it would also on the whole appear that the concept of fatalism is what is to the fore in Irish variants of River Claiming its Due rather than the idea of sacrifice to a water being, the Irish tradition thus lending support to Velure's arguments (1972, 65-6) in favour of River Claiming its Due being originally a legend of fate.</page></plain_text>
