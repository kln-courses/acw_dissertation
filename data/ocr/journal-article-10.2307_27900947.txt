<plain_text><page sequence="1">A CRITICISM OF THE PSYCHOANALYSTS' THEORY OF THE LIBIDO APPARENTLY we have not yet reached that degree Lof development in the mental and social sciences which has been attained by the workers in the physical and bio logical sciences and which enables them to utilize their well-established principles and laws for the projection or prevision of phenomena and to invent systems of social organization and control in the same way and with the same facility with which those versed in the older sciences design elaborate machines, construct synthetic compounds or breed selectively new vegetable varieties. Such attempts in the social and mental sciences are not wanting and they have been attended with a fair degree of success. The devotees of the newer sciences have two difficulties to con tend with which are not present to the same degree in the older and more concrete sciences. The mass of data which they have to handle is so great and their subject matter is so variable that they find it difficult to establish definite and dependable quantitative generalizations which can be used successfully for constructive or inventive purposes. Also the complexity of the resulting invention is itself so great that it has as yet proved an almost insuperable task to organize in the mind all of the details of a complex social invention constructed by the aid of the laws of the social and mental sciences. Consequently, most of the inventions in the field of abstract organization of the mental and social</page><page sequence="2">THE PSYCHOANALYSTS' THEORY OF THE LIBIDO 24I life have so far arisen as discoveries rather than as the re sult of conscious prevision and scientific construction. Some process or technique or institution has grown up or has sprung into existence at a critical time and has been selected for survival because of its utility or because of some acci dental social attachment to it. In this respect present-day psycho-social inventions are very similar to the earlier empirical physical inventions or discoveries, made before the physicist learned to make use of his mathematical fornir ulae for the construction of machines largely de novo. Psychoanalysis is no exception to this general principle. Like Christian Science it was discovered rather than in vented, in the sense of being first constructed in abstract theory out of scientific formulae and then reduced to a technique of practice or a physical structure. Its develop ment has, in fact, been in just the reverse order. Begin ning as a practical technique it has gradually been sub jected to a systematic, theoretical interpretation in an attempt to render it scientific.1 The almost inevitable result of this line of development has been that the theory of psychoanalysis carries an immense deadweight of un sound speculation and metaphysical theory. Developed for the most part by practical men trained in the old metaphysi cal mental science rather than in the newer behavioristic and neurological psychology, in so far as they were trained psychologically at all, its sponsors brought more specu lative ingenuity than sound scientific knowledge to the the oretical explanation of their technique or practice. This has been especially true of Freud who has so largely dominated the development of psychoanalytic theory. It is the pur pose of this paper to discuss one of the more striking meta 1 For a brief account of the origin of the psychoanalytic technique and theory, see W. A.

The implication of the term libido is itself metaphysical in content since it presupposes a conscious attitude of desire, when as a matter of fact most of our impulses or conations come into consciousness but imper fectly, if at all. The use of the term with this implication represents a sort of intellectu^lization and rationalization which was the general rule among the philosophers of the nineteenth century and was particularly characteristic of those who had a leaning toward the Utilitarian or the hed onistic interpretation ; and traces of such a correlation can be found in psychoanalytic theory, as when Freud speaks of "pleasure-striving" and the "libido" as synonomous5. It seems strange that psychoanalysis, which originated in close connection with hypnotic therapy and was at its in ception closely related to the various schools dealing with the unconscious and the subconscious, should have adopted a terminology which implied an unwarranted intellectuali zation of causative factors and a close balancing of feeling motives. Freud makes of the "libido" a sex term, thinking of it as equivalent to sex urge or desire. In this respect he takes issue with Jung-,6 who identifies "libido" with enerev or 2 For other papers by the writer on metaphysical concepts of the psycho analysts, see "Instinct and the Psychoanalysts" in The Journal of Abnormal Psychology and Social Psychology and "The Psychoanalysts' Theory of the Conflict-Neurosis," in American Journal of Psychology. 3 Andre Tridon (op. cit.) substitutes the term urge for libido, apparently meaning much the same as is meant by Jung and his followers by the term "libido." 4 See his "Psychological Understanding," Jour.

Freud says, "Obviously we should gain slight profit if, following the example of Jung, we were to emphasize the original unity of all the instincts, and were to call the energy expressed in all of them 'libido/ Since the sexual function cannot be eliminated from psychic life by any device, we are forced to speak of sexual and asexual libido. As in the past, we rightly retain the name libido for the instincts of sexual life."7 Also, "Until now we worked with the impulse that we can distinguish the ego and the sexual instincts from one another by their manifestations. . . . We called the accumulation of energy which the ego directed towards the object of its sexual striving libido and all others, which proceeded from the instincts of self-preservation, interest."8 Freud even goes to the extent of regarding nursing?the primitive form of food-getting and also an example of a self-preservative instinct at work?as an example of the striving of the sex libido, since nursing gives pleasure and all pleasure is, according to Freud, sexual.9 This is, of course, an excel lent example of reasoning in a circle, the conclusion being justified by the arbitrary assumption that all pleasure is sexual. This assumption is based upon the superficial anal ogy between the sex act and nursing, including the simil arity of the mechanics of the two processes, the expres sions of pleasure in the acts and the relaxation and con tentment following the acts.10 Such reasoning is, of course, childish and metaphysical. Its author does not offer any neurological or other scientific evidence in support of it, but assumes it on the basis of crude analogies. Freud traces the evolution of the expression of the "libido" from nursing to onanism as follows : "The suck 7 Op. cit., 357. *Ibid., 358. ? Ibid., 116, 309. 10 Ibid., 270-1.

The mother's breast is the first object for the sexual instinct ; I can scarcely bring home to you how significant this object is for centering on the sexual object in later life, what profound influence it exerts upon the most remote domains of psychic life through evolution and substitution. The suckling, however, soon relinquishes it and fills its place by a part of his own body. The child sucks his thumb or his own tongue. Thereby he renders himself independ ent of the consent of the outer world in obtaining his sens ual satisfactions, and moreover increases the excitement by including a second zone of his body . . . " 11 This, he says, gradually leads over to onanism itself. Here we have an exposition in brief of the current assumption of an inher ent or neurological correlation between finger sucking and autoeroticism, when, as a matter of fact, the only sim ilarity is a superficial analogy unless, indeed, we adopt the definition of autoeroticism used by Jellifife. He makes it identical with any self-given pleasure.12 This definition, however, does not serve to connect finger sucking with a sex act, such as masturbation, any where except in the im agination of the psychoanalytic theorist. Another glaring example of metaphysical assumption is to be observed in the characteristization of nursine as ? Ibid., 271-2. 12 Jelliffe says, "In the infantile period, the pleasure principle seeks the continuance of the satisfaction. The term, erotic satisfaction, is used by Freud to signify this in the general sense, by which is meant the gratification of the pleasure sense of the area involved (sic). Thus, there can be respiratory, lip, stomach, urethral, anal, skin, retinal, cochlear, vestibular, muscular, gustatory, and olfactory eroticism. To assume that only one area of the body is capable of receiving sense gratification, and hence that the word, auto-eroticism, has reference only to one area, i. e., the genital area, is unutterably stupid, and yet this is the usual implication given to the word by critics. There is ample jus tification for applying the term, auto-erotic, to each receptor group already indicated, since it has been seen how the interest (libido) may be transferred from one area to another that becomes the center of striving."?The Technique of Psychoanalysis, 42.

Such a teleological statement is not justifiable, since at this age there can be no prevision of future sexual expe riences. Neither is there any question of ideals or aims in volved here. Also, to speak of the lips and hands as erogen ous zones at this stage of development of the child is to substitute effect for cause. Among many primitive peoples, lovers do not kiss, either during courtship or during the consummation of the sex act. Girls and boys d? not generally enjoy kissing, except for extrinsic reasons such as when playing games involving the perform ance, or when under the influence of external suggestion, until the conditional reflex has been established in connec tion with the expression of sex passion. Kissing appar ently arises as a practice from the tendency of the young child to make its earliest contacts with the outside world by means of the lips, which in turn springs from the fact that its first definite localizations are with its lips, because it learns to localize the source of its food?the mother's breast or the nursing bottle?before it acquires correlated movements with its hands and other parts of its body. When the mother fondles her baby it offers the mouth as its most effective contact mechanism and she responds in a similar way. Thus kissing is established as a habit long before sex feeling is experienced. Kissing and fondling come to be associated with sex feelings and expression by induction and their physiological mechanisms become, by conditioning and association or induction, erogenous zones. By the law of conditional reflexes, kissing and fondling in themselves acquire in time the power of arous ing sex desire and become secondary forms of sex expres sion. We must not, however, fall into the error of sup posing that, because the mother (who has gone through the process of courtship and sex expression) may have sex feeling in kissing and fondling her child, the child has</page><page sequence="7">246 THE MONIST the same experience or feeling, unless it be simultaneously stimulated in primary sex zones. And even then the feel ing must be acquired as a conditional reflex. As indicated above, Jung developed a somewhat differ ent conception of the term "libido." At first a follower of Freud,13 he was forced to expand the concept of the "libido" to include all phases of desire and energy expenditure.14 He even compares the concept to that of physical energy ;15 and elsewhere he regards it as psychic energy.16 The "libido" is at first nutritional in character. "The first manifestation of this energy in the suckling is the instinct of nutrition. From this stage the libido slowly develops through manifold varieties of the act of sucking into the sexual function."17 "With the development of the bod^ there are successively opened new spheres of application of the libido."18 In other words, the libido evolves from the nutritional to the sexual, and "in the territory of sexual ity, the libido wins that formation, the enormous impor tance of which has justified us in the use of the term l?bido in general."19 He finds the clearest distinction between the two forms of the "libido" among those animals in whom the stage of nutrition is separated from the sexual stage by a "chrysalis stage." 20 This growth from the nutritional to ? Psychology of the Unconscious, XXVI, XXXIII, 139-140, ff. 14 Ibid., 135, 151. He says {Analytical Psychology, 347-8), "In the classi cal use of the word, libido never had an exclusively sexual connotation as it has in medicine. The word interest, as Clapar?de once suggested to me, could be used in this special sense, if this expression had today a less extensive appli cation. Bergson's concept, ?lan vital, would also serve if this expression were less biological and more psychological. Libido is intended to be an energizing expression for psychological values. The psychological value is something active and determining; hence, it can be regarded from the energie standpoint without any pretense of exact measurement." Compare Ibid., 231. 15 "It can be said that the conception of libido as developed in the new work of Freud and of his school has functionally the same significance in the biological territory as has the conception of energy since the time of Robert Mayer in the physical realm."?Psychology of the Unconscious, 138. 16 "As you know, by libido I understand very much what Antiquity meant by the Cosmogenic-Principle of Eros; in modern terminology simply 'psychic energy.'

Ibid.</page><page sequence="8">THE PSYCHOANALYSTS' THEORY OF THE LIBIDO 247 the sexual libido is not immediate and direct, but is by degrees and from stage to stage.21 "Two periods are to be distinguished in this state of transition, so far as I can judge?the epoch of the suckling and the epoch of the dis placed rhythmic activity. Suckling still belongs to the function of nutrition, but passes beyond it, however, in that it is no longer the function of nutrition, but rhythmic activity, with pleasure and satisfaction as the goal, with out the taking of nourishment. Here the hand enters as an auxiliary organ. In the period of the displaced rhyth mic activity the hand appears still more clearly as an auxil iary organ ; the gaining of pleasure leaves the mouth zone and turns to other regions. The possibilities are now many. As a rule, other openings of the body become the objects of the libido interest; then the skin, and special portions of that. The activity expressed in these parts, which can appear as rubbing, boring, picking, and so on, follows a certain rhythm and serves to produce pleasure. After longer or shorter tarryings of the libido at these stations, it passes onward until it reaches the sexual zone, and there, for the first time, can be occasion for the beginning of onanistic attempts."22 21 Ibid., 160. 22 Ibid., 160-1. I believe the above to be the most nearly correct interpreta tion of Jung's theory of the "libido." However, another interpretation, closer to the Freudian view, may be justified from the text. In this version, Jung attributes much more importance to the role of sex : "It can be a surprise only to those to whom the history of evolution is unknown to find how few things there really are in human life which cannot be reduced in the last analysis to the instinct of procreation. It includes very nearly everything, I think, which is beloved and dear to us."?(Psychology of the Unconscious, 145.) Also he appears to identify the "libido" with the sex "instinct," setting the "libido" over against hunger in the same way that he sets the "instinct" for the preservation of the species (sex "instinct") over against the "instinct" of self-preservation (Ibid.). He states that from the descriptive standpoint in psychology he rec ognizes a multiplicity of instincts, of which sex is one. He also recognizes certain affluxes of the "libido" to non-sexual instincts. This seems to imply that the non-sexual "instincts" or dispositions are derived from the "libido," which is sexual in character. He continues, "Quite otherwise is the genetic standpoint. It regards the multiplicity of instincts as issuing from a relative unity, the primal libido; it recognizes that definite amounts of the primal libido are split off, as it were, associated with the newly formed functions and finally merged in them."?Ibid., 150.</page><page sequence="9">248 THE MONIST Unlike Freud, he does not consider the act of sucking as a sexual act.23 He explains the connection otherwise : "In its migration the libido takes more than a little of the func tion of nutrition with it into the sexual zone, which readily accounts for the numerous and innate correlations between the functions of nutrition and sexuality/'24 His reason ing on this point appears to be sound when he says, "The pleasure in sucking can certainly not be considered as sex ual pleasure, but as pleasure in nutrition, for it is nowhere proved that pleasure is sexual in itself."25 In fact, Jung is rather insistent upon the view that Freud has vastly over stated the importance of sex in the subconscious.26 He does not deny that sex imagery and activities appear very frequently in dreams and in neuroses, but he explains this on the ground that sex, being so much repressed in our society, forms the chief constituent of the subconscious, or unconscious, as he calls it. When the censorship is applied to any unconventional, or otherwise unacceptable idea there is an overflow of the dammed-up "libido" into substitute channels of expression, that is, largely into the subcon scious, and consequently becomes assimilated to the domi nant content there. In this way the libido and its substi tute expressions tend to take on a sex coloring when, as a matter of fact, the object of the repressed or displaced "libido" may be originally anything but sexual.27 He spe cifically states that symbols may have more than one mean ing and that they are not all sexual.28 The content and meaning of the symbol are relative to the situation and causes giving rise to it. Patients often invent some story of the sexual origin of a neurosis, probably because of the 28 Analytical Psychology, 231. 24 Psychology of the Unconscious, 161. 28 Analytical Psychology, 231. While the hypothesis of the identity of sexual feeling and pleasantness has not been proven, it has been adopted by a number of psychologists, especially continental psycho-metaphysicians, and it may be that Freud has been influenced by this erroneous view. *?

This diversion of the sexual libido from the sexual territory into associated functions is still tak ing place," either by sublimation or by repression.31 One of the main functions of religion, especially of the Chris tion religion, has been to offer a means to sublimation or an instrument of repression of the cruder and more primi tive forms of the "libido," thus giving to the "libido" a spiritual rather than a mere physical expression.32 Chris tianity "was accepted in order to escape at last from the brutality of antiquity. As soon as we discard it, licentious ness returns, as impressively exemplified by life in our large modern cities.33 . . . The religious myth meets us here as one of the greatest and most significant human institutions which, despite misleading symbols, nevertheless gives man assurance and strength, so that he may not be overwhelmed by the monsters of the universe. The sym bol, considered from the standpoint of actual truth, is mis leading, indeed, but it is psychologically true, because it was and is the bridge to all the greatest achievements of humanity."34 As valuable as has been this sublimation 20 Ibid., 227. 80 Psychology of the Unconscious, 146, 149. si Ibid., ISO. 82/&amp;id., 258, 262-3, 453-5, 474, 479. **Ibid., 258. ??

New and more efficient intellectual symbols must be "sub stituted for those that are antiquated and outworn, such as have lost their efficacy through the progress of intellec tual analysis and understanding."35 With this conscious recognition and understanding we can take possession of the "libido," "so that we no longer need the stage of reli gious symbolism for this end. It is thinkable that instead of doing good to our fellowmen, for 'the love of Christ/ we do it from the knowledge that humanity, even as our selves, could not exist if, among the herd, the one could not sacrifice himself for the other. This would be the course of moral autonomy, of perfect freedom, when man could without compulsion wish that which he must do, and this from knowledge, without delusion through belief in the reli gious symbols."36 It is in this way that the "libido" becomes socialized through knowledge and the pressures of the social environ ment. This nice bit of social philosophy setting forth the necessity of the irradiation of conduct by science instead of belief and tradition is by no means new, but it can never be too much insisted upon. It is doubtful, however, if its exposition is in any way rendered more effective by over shadowing it by the clumsy theory of the "libido" and in fantile regression. Although Jung speaks of the differen tiation and desexualization of the "libido," which is really a process of socialization by means of making our interests comprehend and function in the wider social environment, he does not, like some of the writers,37 marshall a long list of special or partial derivative "libidos."

Accord ing to Jung it is-through the religious interest that man escaped from the sexual. To be wholly consistent with the development of his theory as set forth above he should also have included a rational or intellectual "libido," although this might be regarded as a contradiction in terms, especially since the "libido" is essentially and origi nally instinctive.46 White approaches fairly closely the position of Jung. He says, "To my mind there ought to be no serious diffi culty here.48 In the physical sciences we have the concept of energy and also the concept of the transfer of one kind of energy into another, as heat into electricity, electricity into light, etc., so here if we think of the libido only as energy we will be on safe ground. Now the question is, to what use is the energy put? As we have seen that all libido trends may be classified into one of two groups, the nutritional and the sexual, the question becomes more specifically, is the libido being used for self-preservation (nutritional) or race perpetuation (sexual) ends?"47 White also introduces a metaphysical and analogical as sumption into his discussion of the "libido" when he says, "All love has as its fundamental object race perpetuation and is therefore sexual, it matters not how far removed its 38 Psychology of the Unconscious, 160. ??

The discussion here is as to whether the "libido" is interchangeable between sex and nutrition. Jung holds that it is. Freud appears to hold to the contrary.

We must, therefore, be prepared to find, and it has been so found that the attachment of the child to those about it is fundamentally a sex attachment, a fact which is at once brought out by the fact that, in gen eral, the child is more strongly attached to the parent of the opposite sex.48 Herein lies the basis of the problem of incest, a problem that has vexed all peoples throughout time and has been the occasion of some of the most impor tant and powerful social institutions." 49 White is not one of those who accept a maternal or parental instinct,00 hence he cannot be accused of contradicting himself on this score or of confusing the parental with the sex instinct, a pro cedure which Freud might readily justify. The error of the assumption that all love is fundamentally sexual in character is of a piece with the dogma that all pleasure is sexual, earlier mentioned as an element of the psychoana lytic metaphysics. Love is the affective attachment of one individual for another arising in response to an actual or anticipated beneficial association. It is given in response 48 This is not necessarily true. When it is true the fact is probably due rather to the greater responsiveness of the parent of the opposite sex to the child, induced by the overflow of that parent's love for the spouse fixing itself upon the child of the same sex as a symbol of that parent, especially as a sex symbol. Thus the mother loves her young son because his maleness symbolizes the sex attractiveness of his father ; and the same may be said of the father's greater affection for his little daughter. It is to be expected that the child would respond to the greater affection of the parent so influenced, but this does not justify the assertion that the child's response is sexual, even in the symboli cal sense in which the parent's love may be so characterized. There may be an added incentive for the small son to love his mother more than the father because of the closer and more sympathetic contacts which he enjoys with her. In many cases, also, the young daughter prefers the mother for the same rea sons. The writer once asked a girl of five which she liked better, her father or mother. The response favored her mother. "Why?" "Because mother cooks for me." This answer was doubtless in some degree a rationalization; or shall we say, rather a symbolical simplification? This tendency to prefer the parent with whom there are closest and most frequent contacts may be counteracted in greater or less degree by the attractiveness of novelty and the background of mystery regarding the activities of the other parent, especially the father. Op. cit., 153. 60 He does not mention such instincts in the treatise on psychoanalysis, which is here cited. However, he does accept these so-called instincts in two other later volumes: Thoughts of a Psychiatrist on the War and After and The Mental Hygiene of Childhood.</page><page sequence="14">THE PSYCHOANALYSTS' THEORY OF THE LIBIDO 253 for some service or favor, or contact, material or spiritual, which arouses an affective or pleasurable response in the one who loves. Any service, such as the giving of food, assistance in a task, consolation, etc., when gratefully re ceived and when offered by a personality with which we can establish sympathetic relationships, tends to inspire love of some sort. Sex favors are among those most appre ciated by most people in certain age periods and their ex pression tends to establish a highly sympathetic relation ship between the parties concerned. Hence sex love is one of the most intense types of love. But it is probably not more powerful than maternal love, which may be wholly devoid of directly or indirectly expressed sex elements, especially if the relationship between mother and child is particularly close and sympathetic and if the mother is called upon to render much service to the dependent child. The confusion in the minds of the psychonanalysts is a very commonplace one in logic. White also uses the term libido in a rather general and distributive sense. While he asserts that "the libido has two main tendencies, the self-preservative or nutritional libido and the race-preservative or sexual libido,"51 he also speaks of various special or partial "libidos." In connec tion with his discussion of Adler's theory of organ inferior ity he says of a theory of the cure of errors of refraction without glasses,52 "To translate this into terms of libido we should say that defective vision was a defective use of eye libido."53 Likewise he raises the question of a similar interpretation of other diseases." Can a carcinoma of the stomach be understood in terms of nutritional libido? A rectal tabetic crisis in terms of anal erotic (libido)? A 51 Op. cit., 196. It may be worth while to note that he here speaks of the "libido" as originally a unit fact, apparently following the conception of Jung. 52 See Bates, W.

And so on throughout the whole category ?"54 It may be remarked that this inter pretation makes room for at least as many "libidos" as there are separate pathological organic conditions. It must also be obvious that the assimilation of these various organic "libidos" to the more general nutritional and sex "libidos," including them under one or the other of these, can be nothing but a metaphysical device of classification, based not upon organic functional or structural kinship, but upon an anthropomorphic interpretation of similarity. Such similarity or identity exists only in the abstracting and synthetizing processes of the human mind which can perceive ends abstractly. It is the mind which imposes the conception of similarity or unity upon these various "libidos." Physiology and biology know nothing of it. Hence, to speak of it as a naturalistic fact, rather than as a logical hypothesis, is metaphysical rather than scientific. Furthermore, such a teleological and intellectualistic classi fication must face the embarrassing fact of the interchange ability of the constituent or secondary "libidos," which may at one time be classified under the nutritional and at another under the sex category, according as they are con ceived by the interpreting mind as serving the one end or the other. The following passages, bearing on the same subject, also illustrate well the intellectualistic, anthropomorphic and metaphysically teleological character of psychoanalytic theory with reference to the concept of the "libido." In speaking more at length of one of the special "libidos," White says, "In the striving for power the respiratory libido has, so to speak, been selfish, wrapped up in its own selfish ends, and has not been able to serve the individual as a whole. It is again the old story of self-preservation m Ibid., 266-7.

The same way of thinking may be applied to other diseases?gastric car cinoma, nephritis, arterio-sclerosis, etc. Is cerebral arterio sclerosis, for instance, a setting of the tissues which makes further development impossible, or is it a tissue response to stoppage of development, a chrystallization of the ways of thinking?"55 The last clause is highly suggestive of the language of Christian Science. Possibly both psycho analysis and Christian Science have, at this point, some thing in common in the metaphysics of their theories, if not in their therapeutic technique. It may be worth while to consider the views regarding the "libido" set forth by two minor writers56 in order to secure a better perspective of the theory. Jelliffe follows Jung in defining libido in terms of interest,57 energy,58 or striving.5* Although he recognizes, along with Jung and Freud, two original dominant tendencies, or "principles" in the organism?self-preservation and race preservation60 ?he does not, as they, consider the "libido" to be origi nally a unity. The child's activities or strivings are not at first integrated into an economic harmony.

These various "libidos" originate in the archaic stage and evolve through the autoerotic and narcissistic stages to the social.66 In the initial or archaic phases "each libido area is egoistic, self-seeking to the exclusion of all others; the child stops breathing in the early attempts at feeding: all other forms of libido energy wait in abeyance until that one demanding the moment satisfaction is appeased."66 This anarchistic competition of the "libidos" is overcome under pressure of environmental limitations to the satis faction of the various "libidos" separately. Mutual conces sions are made and each is disciplined into co-operation with the rest.67 Socialization comes through repression, which "consists in the subordination of certain libido values at lower levels in order that a utilization of identically the same energy may take place at higher levels in the process termed sublimation68 . . . this process of repression is going on all the time below the levels of consciousness in the developing child. . . . By the age of five . . . the work of repression, so far as these primitive ego strivings are concerned, has resulted in creating a social animal."69 In this way unity of "libido" striving arises out of origi nal disunity, the reverse of the process described by Jung, who speaks of "the multiplicity of instincts . . . issuing from a relative unity, the primal libido."70 Jellifife holds ?3 Ibid., 40. ?4 Ibid., 40-48, 62, 133, 135. ?

He identifies, the reproductive or sexual as contact with a member of either sex for the purpose of mutually productive creation.73 This is of course a purely mystical and arbitrary definition of sexual, nor does it throw much light on the manner in which the reproductive becomes integrated out of the conflicting "libidos." The co-operative aspect may, however, lead us to suppose that it also is properly the result of the coerced organization of the "libidos" under the compulsion of the social environ ment. It would thus appear to be an even more socialized integration than the self-preservative "principle," since it involves co-operation between personalities while the latter involves only the co-operative functioning of the "libidos" within the personality. Thus reproduction in the psycho analytic mystical or metaphysical sense presupposes the integration of the personality for self-preservative pur poses. It might even be said to be the second or more social stage in the development of the personality, in which mere self-preservation of the person expands into social self preservation or social creation and perpetuation. This in terpretation would appear to be compatible with Jung's account of the evolution of the "libido" from the nutritive 71 Technique of Psychoan,alysis, 48. 7* Ibid., 46, 66. 73 "It is to this broad reproductive instinct, in all its conscious and uncon scious manifestations, that Freud has applied the term sexual. In this present volume on the Technique of Psychoanalysis, sexual means any human contact actual or symbolic by means of any sensory area with the object of the same or of the opposite sex, which has productive creation for its purpose, be it con cretely in the form of a child, or symbolically as an invention, artistic produc tion, or other type of mutually creative product. It does not apply to those contacts which have purely nutritive or self-preservative instinct behind them. And it does not apply solely to genital contacts."?Loc. cit., 52.

This assumption of similarity would also seem to be borne out, in part at least, by the following passage: "If then con crete immortality is the goal of the libido striving, which is reached either directly and foremostly through the birth of children and secondarily through building up of social structures and all that goes to make life worth living, then it is extremely simple to comprehend that the symbol of power to bring this about should be expressed, for the adult, in terms of the primacy of the genital zones. Potency becomes the guiding ideal. The direct opposite of personal immortality is death. Desire as a constructive forward push of the libido is therefore symbolized as potency. Fear becomes the opposing symbol of impotency and is likened to death." 75 The conclusions here drawn do not appear as obvious to me as they do to the author, but nevertheless the statement may serve to indicate his conception of the nature and origin of the two phases of the integrated "libido." Another American writer on psychoanalysis, A. A. Brill, utilizes essentially the same general concept of the "libido" as that set forth above, but he retains the Freudian termi nology regarding sex. Brill is closer to Freud than to any of the rest of the older and more authoritative figures in psychonanalysis ; he may be spoken of as the interpreter of Freudian theory in the United States. To him the "libido" is always sexual in content, but one soon discovers that all desire or aflfective attitude is, according to his usage, sexual.70 According to Brill, there are two funda mental instincts :77 hunger and love, and these are the origi nal bases of the libido. But since civilization has mitigated or largely removed the hunger conflict or struggle for food 74 Jung, Psychology of the Unconscious, 146-161. 75 Jelliffe, The Technique of Psychoanalysis, 67. 76 Brill, Fundamental Conceptions of Psychoanalysis, 22. 77 Op. cit., 32.</page><page sequence="20">THE PSYCHOANALYSTS' THEORY OF THE LIBIDO 259 while it has repressed sex expression, we are concerned with the sex "libido" only, from a pathological standpoint.78 Dreams,79 lies,80 fairy stories,81 art82 of any sort, voca tions,83 all represent more or less indirect methods of satis fying desire or the "libido," frequently or primarily through sublimation. He distinguishes three stages of the devel opment of the "libido" or "love-life." In this also he fol lows Freud. The three phases of the sex life are ( ) the auto-erotic, or egocentric attachments, (2) the narcissistic and (3) the object love.84 This classification reminds one of Jelliffe's diagrams, illustrating the growth of the libido toward integration and socialization, except that Jelliffe includes an initial stage which he terms the archaic.85 In Brill's classification the object love or "libido" is the one which is least egocentric and most socialized. The dream is always egocentric,86 and modern art is distinctly auto erotic,87 having many characteristics in common with the artistic expression of the "libido" of insane people.88 How ever, the growing understanding of vocation as a process of sublimation and normal outlet for the repressed "libido" is working constantly in the direction of socialization. The problem here is to find a vocational adjustment which exer cises the "libido" in a complete or normal manner,89 since vocation has come largely to exercise only part of the "libido" on account of the high degree of specialization of labor.90 Andre Tridon, although his work is of a popular char acter, deserves mention in this connection, because he drops the term libido and substitutes the term vital urge, which 78 Ibid.

Tridon mentions four of these vital urges, three of which are native and one apparently the result of experi ence or the product of adjustment on the basis of the other three. "Man must be fed and hence impelled by a certain urge to seek sufficient food. He must be impelled by some urge to perpetuate his species. He must avoid encounters with harmful stimuli. We may then speak of a nutrition urge, of a sex urge and of a safety urge."92 The last appears to be the same as the fear "instinct" of other writ ers and scarcely fits into the conventional category of "libido" of the general run of writers on psychoanalysis, for the "libido" is to them practically synonymous with love or striving after some object, rather than to escape from it. The acquired element in the urges as they actu ally manifest themselves is large. "The three urges have been greatly developed by civilization and partake of its complexity. Desire for food awakened in man a desire to extend his domination over a certain territory from which he derived his food supply and to drive away from it other individuals when he ^ould not extend his domina tion over them. The will to power was born. That will to-power, gratified or ungratified, became a source of ego tism. The ego, weak in the animals, became extraordi narily powerful in man."93 Thus arises the fourth urge, the ego urge. "The ego urge permeates every relation of life, even the purely sexual relations."94 It "constitutes the main difference between man and the animals."95 It does not arise in the animals, because they are static and do not build up adjustment complexes with relation to their envi 01 Psychoanalysis, Its History, Theory and Practice, 23. ?2 Ibid. 03 Ibid., 23, 26-7. 94 Ibid., 27. ? /frid., 26.</page><page sequence="22">THE PSYCHOANALYSTS' THEORY OF THE LIBIDO 2?I ronment. Man does and his ego is the result.98 However, it is not the most important urge from the standpoint of survival. "The sex urge and the ego urge are far from being as necessary for the individual's survival as the self protection and the nutrition urge."97 It may be inferred that these latter are the more primitive. The urges are closely related to and interact with one another.98 Appar ently there is no attempt here to reduce the "libido" to a strictly sexual content. Tansley, who has attempted to systematize into a scien tific and critically constructive treatment the psychology of psychoanalysis, takes up his position more especially with the school of Jung. He says, in defining the "libido," "The term libido may conveniently be applied to the psychic energy inherent in the great natural complexes, or becom ing attached to any individual complex, and discharging itself along the appropriate conative channels."99 In this definition he makes it possible for the energy which consti tutes the "libido" to be discharged through either inherited or acquired pathways or neural mechanisms. However, the discharge of energy or "libido" occurs most easily through inherited or instinctive channels. He says, "Human actions are certainly determined in the first place by the inherited mechanisms corresponding with the great primary instincts, and secondarily by mechanisms built up in the mind on the foundation of these instincts.100 These 9* Ibid., 24-28. "Ibid., 25. 98 "Sucking the mother's nipple which in the infant is primarily an activity meant to secure food, develops into a semi-sexual activity totally unrelated to nutrition and from which kissing originates. The physical pleasure a Don Juan derives from a new conquest increases his egotism and his sense of power ; and reciprocally Don Juan's newly acquired sense of power and increased egot ism, revealed by certain attitudes, postures, buoyancy, mental and physical, may increase his sexual pleasures by vouchsafing him new conquests, etc. A great egotist may be so filled with a sense of his importance that he will desire an increase in protection commensurate with the growth of his real or imagi nary power, etc."?Ibid., 28. 99 A.

See also p. 77.</page><page sequence="23">2?2 THE MONIST great primary instincts which dominate the outflow of the "libido" are the self or ego, the herd and the sex instincts.101 Around these "great dominant instincts" are built great habit complexes which adapt the utilization of the "libido" to the needs of the organism in its adjustment to the envi ronment.102 Besides the complexes built around the "three great dominant instincts," which "are universal factors in the human mind," there are other secondary complexes which arise out of the variety of experience. These sec ondary complexes "are of the most various kinds and com plexions according to temperament, culture, civilization, and special surroundings."103 The chief outflow of "libido" or psychic energy is through the sex complex, built around the sex instinct, "whose energy charge is the largest and the most intense of any of the great universal complexes." But "the combative instinct, at least in fighting races, fur nishes another example of a specially intense energy charge" and consequent ready channel for the discharge of "libido." 104 Altogether Tansley accepts twelve "sim ple instincts," which, presumably are organized within the "three great dominant instincts," as channels for the out flow or expression of the "libido."105 In recognition of the fact that the "libido" may be discharged through a great variety of acquired or adapted channels, Tansley says, "In the normal civilized man, who is living comfortably above the margin of subsistence, there is a greater or less amount of free psychic energy available which can be turned into 101 Ibid., 177 passim. 102 The author's definition of a complex is as follows : "A complex is a well-defined system of ideas and emotions, created in the mind by the play of experience upon the primary forces of the mind?the instincts," p. 178. ios Ibid., 178. 104 Ibid., 63. 105 See p. 180. In selecting these so-called instincts, he follows McDougall in detail (see McDougall, Introduction to Social Psychology, Ch. 3.) The twelve "simple instincts" adopted by Tansley are: flight, pugnacity, repulsion, curiosity, self-assertion, self-abasement, parental, reproduction (sex), feed ing, gregariousness, acquisition, construction. For criticism of this usage of instinct see Bernard, "The Misuse of Instinct in the Social Sciences," Psy. Rm., March, 1921, and "Instinct and the Psychoanalysts," cited above.</page><page sequence="24">THE PSYCHOANALYSTS' THEORY OF THE LIBIDO 263 any suitable conative channel in which he is able to take an interest?his daily work, sport, a hobby, money-making, politics, religion, social activities of various kinds, and so on."106 In other words the channel of the outflow of psy chic energy or "libido" is as broad as life itself and is lim ited by neither "the three great dominant instincts" nor the twelve "simple instincts." It occurs wherever there is material for human activity or interest. Thus Tansley's interpretation of the "libido," like that of Jung, seems to be much less artificial and narrow than the interpretation of Freud and the true Freudians.107 His tendency is to regard the "libido" as merely psychic energy which may be discharged through any avenue of activity whatever. However, at times he seems almost to fall into the two-fold classification of the "libido" expression which was observed in the writings of Freud and White. Speak ing of the evolution of the dominant complexes he says, "During the first year of post-natal life and for some time longer the psychic energy is principally devoted to satisfy ing hunger?the nutrition libido."108 The sex libido soon begins to develop alongside of the nutrition libido : "Dur ing the next few years of life, long before puberty, the sex complex begins to develop, at first in a very undifferenti ated but still quite unmistakable form."109 The growth of the sex complex is modified and largely directed "by the development of the manifold relations of the growing child to its environment (particularly the relation to society) which form the foundations of other complexes and the channels for the increasing stock of psychic energy. Mean while the ego complex, at first expressed mainly in the nutrition libido, develops and differentiates, employing 106 Op. cit., 63. See also p. 85. 107 He says, "The Freudian School hold that all the primitive psychic energy of a child is sex energv in a wide sense, but there is no more warrant for this belief than in the case of primitive man."

The similarity of all this to Jung is evident.</page><page sequence="25">264 THE MONIST more and more available energy."110 These two dominat ing complexes appear, from his treatment, to be based upon primitive instincts which clash with the artificial and civil ized environment. In this the environment is apparently the aggressor. "At the same time the environment estab lishes a chronic mental conflict between the purely egoistic impulses and sex, on the one hand, and herd instinct, which checks and thwarts these impulses, on the other."111 Appar ently environment is more or less identified with the herd complex, since the latter so obviously arises from the for mer. Sex urge and hunger (sex and nutritional "libido") arise from within, but the herd attitudes and viewpoint are developed within us as a result of the necessity of making adaptations to the psycho-social environment. This is not Tansley's expressed view of the origin of the herd complex, and he might logically assume it to be developed from the "gregarious instinct." But, nevertheless, this interpreta tion squares with the facts. It furthermore has the effect of making the herd complex depend primarily on educa tion, which Tansley urges as a means of offsetting the too great strength of the sex and ego complexes. If we accept this view7 of the origin of the herd complex it barely saves the author from commitment to the twofold expression of the "libido" accepted by White by introducing another "libido," which Tansley does not name, but which we might perhaps by analogy term the "social libido," or "herd libido" or "herd-protective libido." A further indication that Tansley, at least subconsciously if not by design, places the herd complex in a different cate gory from the self and sex complexes is to be found in the fact that he discusses the "nutritional libido" and the sex complex together and follows with a discussion of methods of modifying and sublimating these strong inherent tend encies bv means of education. He brings in his discussion 110 Ibid., 84. ?i/W*., 85.</page><page sequence="26">THE PSYCHOANALYSTS' THEORY OF THE LIBIDO 265 of the herd complex subsequent to this discussion of sub limation and modification, as if it were really a part of the sublimation process.112 Of this process he says, "Educa tion, in the wide sense, is the most important factor in deter mining the actual particular complexes to which the psychic energy is attached. The healthy child has a large surplus of free energy which can be directed into almost any chan nel not too inconsistent with the hereditary make-up of its mind. In the years before puberty, as is well known, almost any direction can be impressed upon the developing mind by appropriate and sufficiently severe training. . . . Much of its inherent energy may be converted into forms not directly connected with physical sex, and of these art and religion are the most conspicuous, though there are many others. This is sublimation of psychic energy in the strict sense, diversion of energy recognizably belonging to a prim itive complex to a 'higher/ i. e., a less primitive one."113 He states a warning, however, with regard to the limit to which modification of the primitive channels of "libido" expression may take place : "Energy cannot, however, be wholly diverted from primitive instincts ; the sex complex, for instance, though it can be considerably modified in the most various ways cannot be made unrecognizable."114 Then, after speaking of the way in which the herd instinct operates to "check and thwart" the primitive egoistic and sex impulses, he adds: "The attempt to divert the whole available energy from the primitive outlets leads at the best to a one-sided development of mind and character and often to overt disaster in later life, for the primitive in stincts, though they may be starved, cannot be destroyed. A certain amount of their inherent energy may be sub limated with safety and advantage, but the effect cannot be wisely pressed beyond the point at which desperate re 112 Op. cit., 84-5. 113 Ibid. "*Ibid.t 84.</page><page sequence="27">266 THE MONIST sistance is encountered. . . . The function of education, in its widest sense, is precisely to secure that the complexes formed, varying, of course, with the hereditary disposition, are such as to secure a fairly balanced allocation of the psychic energy available."115 All this appears to support the view that the social or herd complex is predominantly an acquired thing, the result of environmental pressures, the values implanted through education in the larger sense. It also serves as evidence to strengthen the argument that the "libido" can have an acquired as well as an instinctive basis, even in one of its major forms. We may conclude this discussion of the psychoanalysts' theory of the "libido" with a summary and criticism of their arguments and preconceptions. In the first place, the "libido" is not a thing of mystery but is merely a meta physical and anthropomorphic term to cover the more impersonal one of energy, or psychic energy, as Jung and Tansley interpret it. Psychoanalysis is not immune from the general metaphysical tendency to personify the abstract processes which take place in nature and human nature. Tansley recognizes this when he says, "It is difficult, and sometimes impossible, in dealing with a conception like that of the libido, to avoid using it as if the libido were itself a living thing with independent activities of its own, rather than mere energy flowing along defined channels.116 Jung seems to be least metaphysical in his employment of the term, regarding it as "the equivalent in the psychical sphere of the concept of energy in the physical sphere."117 Tansley, however, limits the concept to "psychic energy attached to a complex and discharging through a conati ve channel, as distinct from the conception of psychic energy at large, which is not necessarily attached to a complex."118 Either of these views is much less personal and metaphysical than ?

Ibid., 63. 118 Ibid., 63, note.</page><page sequence="28">THE PSYCHOANALYSTS' THEORY OF THE LIBIDO 267 the views of Freud, White,119 and their various followers. In order that all mystery and anthropomorphism should be removed from the concepts of psychoanalysis it would be much better to drop the term "libido," with its sex con notation, altogether and substitute for it the simple expres sions desire, energy, reaction, response, process and the like, as occasion requires. In the second place, the "libido" is not specialized to any one or more mechanisms of discharge or action pat terns, inherited or acquired. It is the energy expression of the organism's metabolism and drains off through any channels which are open to it. It is natural that, other things being equal, those complexes which are built around the more active and deeply rooted instincts, especially around those of sex, should offer more opportunity for the draining off of this energy or "libido" than the complexes built around the weaker or surface instincts and habits. But any action plattern, inherited or acquired, may serve for the purposes of draining off the energy of the organ ism. Nature has provided for some of this expression, in adaptation to the survival needs of the organism, through the instincts. But in the human organism or nervous sys tem these instinctive pathways are decidedly inadequate for the drainage of the large amount of energy available for action. As Tansley says, there is a great deal of sur plus energy which must go off in other channels.120 Freud is perhaps the most insistent in this identification of the "libido" with a single channel of expression.121 But even Tansley holds to it in large degree. He says, "The most probable hypothesis is that the great instincts are each endowed with a certain quantity of energy, which prob 119 White says, "I am conscious of the objection to this term but it seems to be too well grounded in use to discard. Then, too, the important thing is the concept and not the name." Op. cit., 73. In his Outlines of Psychiatry (pp. 10-12), he uses the term "libido" as essentially equivalent to interest. ?o Op. cit., 63, 84, 85. 121 See General Introduction to Psychoanalysis, 356-8 ; also his Selected Papers on Hysteria and Other Psychoneuroses, 191-3.</page><page sequence="29">268 THE MONIST ably varies with the individual."122 However, he recog nizes that this relationship is not a fixed one, for he adds, "A surplus (of energy) is normally available for use through any channel which the circumstances of life favors, and ... of the energy normally attached to any instinct, a certain portion, but not all, can, under stress, be diverted to another. We can pretty safely add that under the con ditions of civilized life a large part of the energy of sex is so diverted. . . . But sex energy can be far more easily diverted into certain non-sexual channels than into others."123 This assumption of a fixed quantitative corre lation between inherited action patterns and energy dis charge seems to me to be unwarranted. The control of the energy discharge of the organism is, at least in early life, extremely mobile and is markedly susceptible to the valua tion imposed by the environmental organization. This fact is partly recognized in the theory of sublimation set forth by the psychoanalysts themselves; although the orthodox Freudians make much less allowance for the sublimation process than do the newer school to which Tansley may be said to belong. In the third place, it may be pointed out that the food and other vegetative instincts, and complexes, such as those connected with respiration, digestion, assimilation, circula tion and excretion, have been largely neglected by the psy choanalysts in their treatment of the "libido," or they have been lumped under the general and indefinite heading of the ego complex or instinct (nutritional or self-preserva tive "libido"). White and Adler have perhaps given more recognition to these organic functions than have the other psychoanalysts.124 The cause of this neglect probably lies in the fact that in modern civilized society there are rela 122 Op. cit., 232. 123 Ibid., 232-3. 124 See especially White, Mechanisms of Character Formation, Ch. 11, and Adler, The Neurotic Constitution.</page><page sequence="30">THE PSYCHOANALYSTS' THEORY OF THE LIBIDO 269 tively few inhibitions upon a normal satisfaction of these organic demands. While, on the other hand, our society regulates by means of many conventions the exercise of sex functions and it at the same time permits the commer cialized and personal overstimulation of the sex impulses through amusements, literature, dress, and the like. Con sequently the margin between sex desire and sex satisfac tion is so much greater than it is between desire and satis faction of the other organic functions that sex is much in our attention. Also the attempts to secure modified or substitute sex satisfactions which are not prohibited by convention or detected by authority are so numerous and frequent that we readily take cognizance of this field of organic action and the discharge of energy through it, although the actual discharge of energy may be less in vol ume here than elsewhere. Finally, the psychoanalysts are in need of a shift of emphasis, in part at least, from the instinctive over to the habitual or acquired bases of the "libido" or action-energy discharge controls. As was pointed out earlier in this paper, their instincts are not instincts, but are abstractions. They are habit valuations and abstract mental correlations of activity processes which do not exist as such in overt reality. There is no such thing as a general ego or self instinct, nor is there any unit organization of habit which corresponds to this general social valuation which corre sponds to self-centered or egoistic action. But there are a multitude of activity processes, instinctive and acquired, which function with reference to the promotion of self interest or satisfaction and, therefore, we may properly correlate them abstractly (but not concretely and objec tively) because of the similarity of their values for the individual and society. The same may be said with equal, or even with greater, propriety regarding the herd "in</page><page sequence="31">2J0 THE MONIST stinct" or complex.125 Both are abstract valuations rather than concrete action processes when viewed as units or wholes. In considerable degree the sex instinct of the psy choanalysts is subject to the same criticism. However, the sex complex, considered as an abstraction, has more con crete and objective reality, because dominant in it there are certain actual instincts which function in sex activity. It is because of the existence of these sex instincts in the sex complex, giving objective reality and vigor to it, that it is so generally recognized as the strongest of the com plexes in most people. The other complexes are much more the result of habit adaptation. They are built up in social situations. In fact, it is quite evident that the ego and the herd complexes of the psychoanalysts are the two poles of the reciprocally developed consciousness of self and society of which Professor Cooley has made so much in his books.126 These supposed instincts of the self and the herd are complexes constituting the dominant experiences of the individual as he is inducted into a realization of the race experience by means of a more or less constructive adaptation to the psycho-social environment.127 Therefore, since the "three great dominant instincts" of Tansley,128 or the twTo of White or the one of Freud, which serve as "libido" patterns are but complexes, consisting mainly of acquired elements, it would be desirable for the psychoanalysts to recognize this fact and to build their theory accordingly. By doing so they could do much to elevate their theory of the "libido" from a metaphysical postulation to a scientific explanation. Only by studying the organization and permutations of the environment 125 See author's article on "Instinct and the Psychoanalysts," in Journal of Abnormal Psychology and Social Psychology. 12?

This fact does not deny that the instinctive patterns are effective or that the instincts influence the nature of the complexes super imposed upon them. But the fact remains that the psycho social environment, in the stage of civilization at which we have arrived, has more to do with shaping the great complexes and determining resulting conflicts in the ex pression of the "libido" than have the native or instinctive tendencies. Hence, it is in a sociology and a social psy chology, even more than a psychology and a biology, that the psychoanalysts must in the future search for their most important data. L. L. Bernard.
