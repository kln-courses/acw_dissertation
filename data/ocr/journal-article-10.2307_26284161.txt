<plain_text><page sequence="1">rrfir BLACK EARTH, WHITE MYTH: COETZEE'S MICHAEL K Ideas about earth and the land have been enduring preoccupations in white South African literature, usually in the form of expropriative ter ritorial mythologies or mystiques which automatically exclude the non Afrikaner. The Afrikaner writer, notes Breyton Breytenbach, has a tendency to mythologize landscape through "passionate and mystical descriptions of flatland and hillock" whereas for his black African counter part the land is simply there and is taken much for granted (208). In the long first part of J. M. Coetzee's Life &amp; Times of Michael K (1983) there is a curious passage in which the white South African writer is discovered trying to imagine what the South African black himself imagines to be the Afrikaner heritage, a heritage presented here in terms of land scape and silence: Modern Fiction Studies, Volume 38, Number 2, Summer 1992.

NOTES AND DISCUSSION 435</page><page sequence="2">He filled his beret with more of the feed, thinking: At last I am living off the land. Sometimes the only sound he could hear was that of his trouser-legs whipping together. From horizon to horizon the landscape was empty. He climbed a hill and lay on his back listening to the silence. ... I could live here forever, he thought, or till I die. Nothing would happen, every day would be the same as the day before, there would be nothing to say. ... He could understand that people should have retreated here and fenced themselves in with miles and miles of silence; he could understand that they should have wanted to bequeath the privilege of so much silence to their children and grandchildren in perpetuity (though by what right he was not sure). (63-64) Momentarily, Michael achieves the Afrikaner's dubiously authorized pastoral ideal of "living off the land" and (almost perversely, since he is one of its dispossessed victims) sympathizes with his pursuit of silence. The difference is that he has none of the Afrikaner's need to affirm his puny presence in this landscape: for him, the topography lends itself to no myths, offers no mystical bond or blood-intimacy, and altogether lacks humanizing dimensions, being not merely silent but empty—a place where nothing happens. Coetzee's Cape gardener, faced with the harsh, inhospitable earthscapes of the Karoo, finds himself perfectly at home with their refusal of human meanings, their preverbal nothingness, and feels himself assuming the character of the bare mineral scrubland: "I am becoming smaller and harder and drier every day" (93). But the ecstasies afforded at the extremity of this "arid landscape that tilted and threatened to tip him over its edge" (78) are ecstasies of vacancy and negation, in which faint echoes of Wordsworth's anthropomorphic scenery are quickly dispersed into the brooding nullity: Even on the stillest of days no sound reached him save the scurrying of insects across the ground, and the buzz of the flies that had not forgotten him, and the pulse of blood in his ears. . . . There was nothing to look forward to but the sight, every morning, of the shadow of the rim of the mountain chasing faster and faster toward him till all of a sudden he was bathed in sunlight. He would sit or lie in a stupor at the mouth of the cave, too tired to move or perhaps too lackadaisical ... he sometimes locked his fingers behind his head, closed his eyes, and emptied his mind, wanting nothing, looking forward to nothing. (91, 93, 94) Language exists at a tangent both to this minimalist landscape and to its occupant: K's pursuit of silence, paradoxically rendered into rhetoric by his white-Afrikaner author, is a nonverbal one. Almost inarticulate as a result of his harelip, he lives in terror of a life spent with people and in language, and at one point envisages himself as an earth-hole into which words disappear: "Always, when he tried to explain himself to himself, there remained a gap, a hole, a darkness before which his understanding baulked, into which it was useless to pour words. The words were eaten up, the gap remained" (150-151). And yet, in this first attempt by Coetzee at a non-white perspective, the ruling metaphysic and mythology are still of earth. Throughout his 436 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="3">Strange nomadic peregrinations and internments, Michael "barely knows there is a war on" (179) because he is busy existing on his own terms, unresponsive to historical events, and the camp doctor whose narrative takes up the second part of the book sees Michael not as part of the substantial historical world that he himself believes in but as "untouched by history" (207) and "scuffled together" from "a handful of dust" into "the shape of a rudimentary man" (220) He is: a genuine little man of earth . . . with fingers ready hooked and back ready bent for a life of burrowing, a creature that spends its waking life stooped over the soil, that when at last its time comes digs its own grave and slips quietly in and draws the heavy earth over its head like a blanket and cracks a last smile and turns over and descends into sleep, home at last, while unnoticed as ever somewhere far away the grinding of the wheels of history continues. (220) Of course, the conditions for and terms of the mythology constructed around K are set by South Africa's historical situation, from which Coetzee extrapolates, and projects onto a civil war footing, the options for blacks: a life lived in camps—educational, rehabilitative, or penal—or life as a survivalist, out in the open with only the earth for protection. The unspoken wish of thè white authorities in the novel is for the blacks to vanish from the face of the earth and, preferably, into it, and K's frighten ing image of blacks being forced to dig their own mass-graves (129-130), anticipates the doctor's later fantasy of K as earth-man pulling down the lid after himself. Disenfranchised from a human existence on the earth's surface, they are directed toward a choice of underground existences (K's mother lives in a cave-like understairs cupboard in her white employer's flat) and, in K's case, back to the earth itself: ". . .a man must be ready to live like a beast. A man who wants to live cannot live in a house with lights in the windows. He must live in a hole and hide by day. A man must live so that he leaves no trace of his living" (135). But Coetzee has erected around Michael K a special chthonic mythology,1 with its own ahistorical order, into which the "wheels of history" have been rerouted. K goes literally underground, burrowing without trace, like the animals, insects, and grubs which he eats and likens himself to, or is ploughed back into the earth like a fallen seed, to be resurrected from three dungeon like incarcerations. Earth has become his element and is a constant touchstone and referent for his existence, so that he feels "like an ant that does not know where its hole is" when removed from it to the camp (114). He grubs, plants, and hides in it, he carries his mother's ashes to the part of it from whence she came, and he will take back as food only what he has put into it: his seedling-children, growing into a family 'The chthonic features of the novel are dealt with at greater length in my article, "Chthonic Man: Landscape, History and Myth in Coetzee's Life &amp; Times of Michael K." NOTES AND DISCUSSION 437</page><page sequence="4">of sister-melons and brother-pumpkins, the fruit of his real mother, to whom he is connected by an invisible "cord of tenderness." "My father was Huis Norenius," K remembers of his childhood. "My father was the list of rules on the door of the dormitory" (143). When Anna K falls sick her son rejects everything represented by the father in South African culture, encompassing the military establishment, special institutions and penal system, and the war fought to defend and preserve them ("War is the father of all," runs the epigraph); and he decides at that moment that "he had been brought into the world to look after his mother" (9). It is part of his quest in the novel, however, to discover who his true mother is. From the beginning of the book, K's two mothers are closely associated. On the first page his harelip forces his natural mother to feed him with a teaspoon and on the last page he is "fed" water, in an identical manner, by the earth, whose hills are elsewhere represented as "two plump breasts" (137). He transports his mother across the Cape in a converted wheelbarrow, used in his work as a gardener for the transportation of earth; he crawls under it for sleep and protection as he will later crawl under the earth's surface; and at the end of the novel, when he is bound again for earth, he sets off to recover the same abandoned barrow (K moves circularly, in fact, like the seasonal movements of the earth). What is most revealing, however, is that, after first burying her ashes in a hole in the ground, he then has misgivings and decides instead to plant them like seeds in individual spaces, distributing "the fine grey flakes over the earth, afterwards turn ing the earth over spadeful by spadeful. This was the beginning of his life as a cultivator" (80-81). Thus out of the burial of his natural, biological mother is conceived the tending of his greater, cosmic one, and K can reply ambiguously to the doctor's enquiries about her whereabouts: "She makes the plants grow" (178). Michael's progress, as Karin van Lierop has noticed (47), is a kind of reverse-initiation rite, returning from city to primitive, unspoiled earth and from adulthood to mothered child. Indeed, in his imagination, he travels all the way back to his origins, tracking his descent "from a line of children without end" and conjuring up the images of an original, amorphous Earth-Mother and a prehistoric earth moving in geological time: He tried to imagine a figure standing alone at the head of the line, a woman in a shapeless grey dress who came from no mother; but when he had to think of the silence, in which she lived, the silence of time before the beginning, his mind baulked. ... He also dreamed of his mother. He was walking with her in the mountains. . . . The green lines of river-courses stood out against the fawn of the earth; there were no roads or houses anywhere; the air was still. ... He was learning to love idleness ... as a yielding up of himself to time, to a time flowing slowly like oil from horizon to horizon over the face of the world. . . . (158, 160-161, 163). 438 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="5">Yet, although K insists that "What grows is for all of us" and "We are all the children of the earth" (190), this earth barely keeps him alive and seems rather to adumbrate his grave, for his desire to grow food is in versely proportional to his need to consume it: "As he tended the seeds and watched and waited for the earth to bear food, his own need for food grew slighter and slighter. . . . When food comes out of this earth, he told himself, I will recover my appetite, for it will have savour" (139). He plants to keep the earth, not himself, alive—by giving it seed to grow, work to do—and it is done, if for anyone, not for the present but for posterity. His papers give him the designation opgaarder, a storage man, and what he stores up on his allotment, it seems, are hopes for the earth's future. K has "no desire to father": he offers to the war-ravaged present not his own surviving seed but the message of survival itself and of the earth's spirit of survival. Wary of prodigality, he frugally adjusts his energy intake to the earth's capacities, thinking "only of growing enough for the seed not to die out" and pumping from the borehole only as much water as his garden needs for "the earth to be restored" (82, 154). Desiring only what is best for the earth, he builds his lairs and hovels out of biodegradable material blending with and returning to the earth (143), and concludes at the end of the book, "I am more like an earthworm": like a worm, K passes harmlessly "through the bowels of the state un digested" and "through the intestines of the war" (185, 221, 248). Coetzee seems concerned in this novel to found a new myth of the land: the myth of earth minus man, or at least of Western Technological Man (white), as distinct from Vegetarian, Macrobiotic Man (here, black), who eats only what nature supplies and is not damaged by. And since Michael K is, in fact, less a man than a spirit of ecological endurance, a Gaian ideograph, it remains to ask wherein lies his relevance, whether to the contemporary political situation of South Africa or to the ecological one of the African continent at large. The African earth is here opposed not to industrial overdevelopment but to colonialism and war specific to the South African context. It is not poisoned by industrial waste but destroyed by colonial agriculture (the Visagie farm is a wasteful "adven ture") and by rival armies (the rebel soldiers allow their donkeys to trample K's crops while the government forces mine his allotment). It is not in dustrial plants but jails and camps like Jakkalsdrif that cause "earth [to be] stamped so tight" and "baked so hard . . . that nothing would ever grow there again" (148). Sowing is the earth's alternative to history as war: "The pineapples don't know there is a war on," K tells his mother and argues that "there must be men to stay behind [from the war] and keep gardening alive, or at least the idea of gardening; because once that cord was broken, the earth would grow hard and forget her children" (150). Nevertheless, there are, inevitably, planetary reverberations in this constant insistence upon earth's exhaustibility, upon resources which are not infinitely renewable, and upon the human "cord of tenderness" that NOTES AND DISCUSSION 439</page><page sequence="6">can be cut "only so many times before it would not grow again" (90). The range of reference and implication is naturally extended beyond African ecosystems to the more troubled ones of the developed world, and if the book's mother/Mother Earth association is taken to its logical conclusion, then the recurring image of Anna K's cremation, and K's nightmares of a "mother with flaming hair," "the very embodiment of great Mother Death" (194, 205), translate into the consumed, burned-up earth at a general ecological apocalypse which has nothing specifically to do with South Africa. It is possible to "Africanize" Coetzee's earth myth, as Kelly Hewson has done, by seeing in K's withdrawal from history a sort of mystical radicalism, remaking history on his own marginal terms through notions of mutual survival and a strength-giving interdependency with the earth (66-69). Hewson only gives this kind of radicalism an African application, however, by emphasizing K's supposed interdepen dency with others (particularly the imaginary companion of the last page) rather than with the earth. Alternatively, the earth-myth can be given a localized political construction, as in Robert Post's reading, by allegoriz ing the references to "the bread of freedom" and underground seeds growing in the dark into black land claims and deferred political resurgence (75). But the mythological drift of the novel—although it is problematic for a white writer to use a black figure to say it—is that the land is to be returned not to the blacks but to itself. These two things could, con ceivably, be the same, though there is no indication in the book that they will be, earth-care and ecological awareness not being synonymous with or concomitants of Africanity or blackness. The myth is primarily ecological, not political. This is not the place to debate how much or how little Africa's human populations are to blame for ecological damage, relative to those of the industrialized world, but what Coetzee seems to have constructed—if only half-seriously—in the figure of Michael K is a hero for the white ecological Eighties. In this white-authored text a white liberal spokesman, the camp "doctor" (he is really a pharmacist), inter prets a black character to promulgate what is essentially a "white" myth (insofar as it expresses the anxieties and preoccupations of Western in dustrialized cultures, whether Euro-American or white South African). The medical officer's first instinct, in the role of colonial physician and psychologist, is to demythologize and demystify K—he is simply "a person of feeble mind" and a case of "chronic malnutrition," no natural Earth Spirit but a "city mouse" who "did not know how to live off the land and began to grow very hungry indeed" (179, 187, 200)—but it is not long before he supplies the object of his strange fascination with its chthonic mythology ("a genuine little man of earth. . . ."). The saving factor in the doctor's narrative is that this myth-making is but a part of his own (and, implicitly, his author's) baffled and frustrated effort at understand ing. To this man K is a space that he craves to fill with meaning, "a privileged site where meaning erupted into the world" (227), and thus an index to his own inadequacies. 440 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="7">Michaels means something, and the meaning he has is not private to me. If it were, if the origin of this meaning were no more than a lack in myself, a lack, say, of something to believe in, since we all know how difficult it is to satisfy a hunger for belief with the vision of times to come that the war, to say nothing of the camps, presents us with, if it were a mere craving for meaning that sent me to Michaels and his story, if Michaels himself were no more than what he seems to be (what you seem to be), a skin-and-bones man with a crumpled lip, . . . then I would have every justification for retiring to the toilets behind the jockeys' changing-rooms and locking myself into the last cubicle and putting a bullet through my head. (226) It is the white official who, out of his chronic need for meaning, transforms K into a new myth, and it is part of the book's self-subverting aesthetic that at its close this white quest for meaning is put by K into its proper political context and is seen to amount to no more than a mixture of philanthropic sentiment and guilt preying upon black suffering, consuming it as entertainment: They want me to open my heart and tell them the story of a life lived in cages. . . . And if I had learned story-telling at Huis Norenius instead of potato-peeling and sums ... I might have known how to please them. I would have told the story of a life passed in prisons. . . . When my story was finished, people would have shaken their heads and been sorry and angry and plied me with food and drink; women would have taken me into their beds and mothered me in the dark. Whereas the truth is that I have been a gardener, first for the Council, later for myself, and gardeners spend their time with their noses to the ground. (247) The "story of a life lived in cages" is, perhaps, what Coetzee's novel ostensibly sets out to be, but Coetzee and his doctor are not Michael K and Michael K, by virtue of his deprivation as a South African black, is no story-teller, so the story cannot be written, only distantly imagined by the white writer in the novel's convoluted and reflexive form. Michael K—the "real" Michael K—simply works in the garden: the rest is the doctor's/novelist's myth. The author gesturally remythologizes K in the short last section, where he recovers some of the precious seeds stolen by Cape down-and-outs, is shamed by the prostitute's wasteful spilling of his own seed onto driftsand, and finally sets out for his pumpkin-patch with half a packet of seeds in his pocket. But by this stage the epistemologically bleak conclusion has become inescapable. The Earth Man makes his own kind of history, exclusive of war and colonialism, but the reader is warned that he is his own meaning and that this is not ponderable in the philosophical terms of the oppressor. Coetzee frames the narrative not to distance or dissociate himself from his doctor pharmacist's interpretation but, self-implicatingly, to declare all such readings of the racial or colonial "Other" (including, retroactively, his own narrative presentation of K) as invalid because unavailable to the white interpreter, whether the latter be author, character, or reader. NOTES AND DISCUSSION 441</page><page sequence="8">A principal source of critical discontent with the novel has been Coetzee's failure to provide his protagonist with a surname that would particularize him as a Cape Colored or Black. Neither the author nor his white representative respond to K in the obvious racial terms but choose instead to surround him with earth myths and with Kafkaesque trappings from the European literary tradition (for example, authority derived from "the Castle" and unspecified guilt over an unnamed crime). Of course, K's circumstances and experiences leave the reader in no doubt about his non-white racial status. What is at issue here is the different reasons which character and author have, apart from the obvious one of not want ing to repeat the dehumanizing labellings of apartheid, for avoiding classification. On the one hand, Coetzee has allowed his doctor to pursue his earth-mythology, whether he himself believes it or not, and in the scheme of this K appears to represent something so elemental and ir reducible that it is beyond formulation in any of the existing historical codes: he is "a human soul above and beneath classification . . . the last of his kind, a creature left over from an earlier age" (207), outside of language and history, as inarticulate as the seeds and humus of the earth cycle into which he is locked. On the other hand, the author is anxious not to equate or confuse K's historical condition with this attributed mythological status, and is aware of the tendency of the latter to obscure K's material position as an African black, locked out of history by white colonialism. In both cases K is, by definition, outside the range of understanding encompassed by the articulate, historically conscious white interpreter but, while the medical officer has a mystical-philosophical alibi for his non-classification of K, Coetzee has a more straight forward and obvious political-colonial one. Attention is drawn on the first page of the novel to the harelip that allows K only a minimal articulacy (instead of to his color), but this is done precisely because he is black; because func tional inarticulacy, in the South African context, is a readymade mark of racial identification. The racial division in the book is also, crucially, a language division and language has problematic value in the present aesthetic context. The medical officer, for whom life is lived and history made in language, pleads with K: Listen to me, listen how easily I fill this room with words. . . . Give yourself some substance, man, otherwise you are going to slide through life absolutely unnoticed. . . . You don't want to be simply one of the perished, do you? You want to live, don't you? Well then, talk, make your voice heard, tell your story! . . . no one is going to remember you but I, unless you yield and at last open your mouth. (192, 208) But K refuses, and what becomes increasingly transparent in these later passages is the "faking," from the enemy camp, of a non-white perspec tive by a white author who cannot presume to speak for the black but whose self-conscious fictions the black, because he is voiceless in his own 442 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="9">country, is deemed to depend upon for his artistic existence. Thus the reader is made ever more aware that the black protagonist is being turned into some kind of alternative earth-deity or unlikely ecological savior (im pervious though this landscape is to myth), by an Afrikaner author who is himself steeped in his people's ancestral mythology and traditional religious view of the land (there are echoes of this in the references to "God's earth" and "miracles" in Michael's narrative and in his wonder ing "if he were living in what was known as bliss," [93]). Coetzee has said in an interview that during the composition of Michael K he began to feel dissatisfaction with the limitations of traditional form, and if the novel is, finally, an unsatisfying work, it is perhaps partly because the self-implicating reflexiveness that would enable the author to make clear his degree of commitment to his white liberal's position is not available to conventional realism. In his next novel, where K's place is taken by Friday in a revision of the Robinson Crusoe fable, the dilemma Coetzee found himself in in the second half of Michael K is resolved by keeping the black character mute for the whole novel. Only in the surreal last scene of Foe (1986) is the black slave's mouth pried open and from it issues "a slow stream, without breath, without inter ruption ... it runs northward and southward to the ends of the earth" (157). We do not hear what Friday says because Coetzee, who does not and cannot know what he would say, is not prepared to speak for him. In Michael K, however, the black protagonist's thoughts, in the fashion of realistic fiction, are laid open to us as if of their own accord, although in fact by the white author who then has to resort to internal strategems within the novel's realistic frame, such as making the white doctor unable to prize open K's mouth and make him say anything that he can unders tand. The reflexive metafiction of Foe is the logical next stage on from this, totally abandoning the token psychological realism of Michael K and, with it, the attempt to write from a non-white perspective. In Foe the devices of Postmodern fiction render the novel capable of subverting its own ethnocentricity, a freedom that is denied conventional historical realism. Michael K marks the end of a phase in Coetzee's writing: realism has also gone to ground, the imperial text to earth. DEREK WRIGHT WORKS CITED Breytenbach, Breyton. End Papers. London: Faber, 1986.
