Our argu- ment is reducible to the following propositions. (i) On the basis of their own presuppositions, the point of departure for black theology must be the question: Is God a white racist? (2) Ac- cordingly, a viable theodicy, one which refutes the charge of divine racism, mus~t be the foundation for the edifice of black theology. (3) The theodicies of the above theologians leave the issue of God's racism essentially unresolved. Consequently, the remainder of the theological system lacks adequate support. I The argument of Richard Rubenstein' provides the initial framework for our analysis. The oppression and slaughter of the Jews in World War II led him to conclude that two key elements of his theological tradition must be scraped: God as active in and sovereign over history, i.e., the politics of God, and the Jews as God's chosen people. Though he does not use the following lan- guage, his argument raises the question: Is God an anti-Semite? And to raise the latter question is, as Moltmann correctly sug- gests,2 to revive the theodicy question. The implications for black theology are clear. In the light of black suffering - a suffering which may exceed that of the 'After Auschwitz (Bobbs-Merrill Co., 1966). 2 "Since we experience reality as history and no longer as cosmos, the fundamental theodicy question is still with us and is more pressing than before. For us it has no longer only its old naturalistic form, as in the earthquake of Lisbon in 1755. It appears today in a political form, as in the question of Auschwitz. . .. We ask the question: An Deus sit? ('Whether God is?') on grounds of history and its crimes. . . ."

Once raised, the methodological consequences are equally clear; a viable the- odicy must be the first order of business before construction of the rest of the theological system can begin. This is not to say that a theodicy must, numerically, be the first chapter. We sug- gest, rather, that the theodicy question must control the theological enterprise. Christological and eschatological options, for instance, must be weighed in terms of their value to the theodicy problem. Black theology, we purport to show, must be an extended theodicy. One should not conclude that Rubenstein's argument makes the theodicy question central for black theologians. To be exact, the methodological position they adopt, in part, forces the issue to center stage. If black suffering is in any way crucial for the black theologian, if reflection upon black suffering is the starting point for his theology, then the theodicy question must precede all others. For each of the figures in our study, black suffering, ex- plicitly or implicitly, is central. Explicitly: "The point of departure for black theology," ac- cording to Cone, "is the question: How do we dare speak of God in a suffering world . . . in which blacks are humiliated because they are black? This question . . . occupies the central place in our theological perspective." 4 Implicitly: if black liberation is the goal of black theology, black suffering, in the final analysis, is its starting point. To regard liberation as the summum bonum necessitates that its opposite, suffering as oppression, is an aspect of the summum malum. The pre-condition for black liberation as the objective for black theology is the prior affirmation of black suffering as oppressive. Because of the nature of suffering in general and black suffering in particular, the question of divine racism cannot be avoided. Suffering is multi-evidential; it can express a relation of favor or disfavor between man and ultimate reality. Consequently, in the face of suffering, whatever its character, one must at least enter- tain the possibility that the relation of disfavor obtains. The peculiar character of black suffering points to the same I BASIL DAVIDSON estimates that slavery, "before and after embarkation," cost Africa fifty million blacks.

There is, first, its maldistribution. It is suffering confined to a specific ethnic group; it is not spread, more or less impartially, upon mankind as a whole. Black suffering, then, mani- fests the scandal of particularity to the degree that it is balanced by white non-suffering instead of white suffering. There is, second, its enormity. If we accept the statistics of Davidson, the issue is more acute for blacks than for Jews. Finally, black suffering is not catastrophic but extends over long periods of history. One is tempted, accordingly, to interpret its causal nexus in terms of purpose and thereby person - not the operation of some indif- ferent natural law. Actually, the same observation could be made for each characteristic of black suffering. We contend that the peculiar nature of black suffering raises the question of divine racism; we do not conclude that it answers the question. We do insist that black theology, precisely because of the fact of black suffering, cannot proceed as if the goodness of God for all mankind were a theological axiom. The black religion- ist must press the issue at the outset, and, most important, he must demonstrate - not assume - its falsity. Our argument is strengthened when we show that there are determining factors besides suffering that oblige black theologians to ponder the issue of transcendent racism. We purport to show that black theology is committed to a de novo approach, and in the latter context divine racism is a genuine option. The implica- tions of the concept of black consciousness for theological method establish our point. Black religionists, today, identify black consciousness with a specific theological method. Because it recognizes the Negro's inauthentic attraction and commitment to white theology - a theology of racism and oppression - black consciousness fosters the development of a counter theology, a black theology, a theology of liberation. Black consciousness requires, in short, a theological movement not simply beyond white theology, but in conscious opposition to it. This means in general methodological terms that the black ex- perience must control the theological enterprise. More specifically, it means (i) that black theology must adopt a method of correla- tion. The starting point for theological reflection must be the</page><page sequence="4">544 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW issues and questions that emerge from the black experience, and the answers, i.e., the black theology, must be consistent with that experience. (2) The black experience must function as the the- ological singular. As the theological Supreme Court, it passes final judgment upon the functional or dysfunctional quality of each part of the theological tradition. (3) A theological concept is functional if and only if it advances the cause of black liberation. (4) As a consequence of the foregoing - and here we come to the significant point for our analysis - black theology is methodolog- ically obliged to conduct a radical and comprehensive appraisal of classical theological concepts to determine if each possesses sufficient "soul" to be included in the emerging black theology. The appraisal must be total - not even God or Jesus Christ can a priori be regarded sacrosanct; they, too, must be jettisoned if they flunk the test. Because black theology suspects that the norms of the Christian tradition are racist, it must proceed, as it were, de novo. The entire tradition must be placed under a strict theological ban until each part demonstrates its orthodoxy, the enhancement of black liberation. And since from a de novo per- spective, the claims, God is a racist and God is a "soul" brother, are on equal footing, can consideration of the former claim, we ask, be avoided? Indeed, our previous discussion permits us to say that black theology methodologically contradicts itself if it both adopts a de novo approach and emphasizes black suffering, but fails to ask the troublesome question of divine racism. Once the issue is broached, the mandatory next step for black theology is to refute the charge, i.e., formulate a viable theodicy.' That a viable theodicy is crucial to the methodological consis- tency of black theology can be supported on other grounds, and again, in terms of the black theologians' presuppositions. Central to each is the doctrine of the politics of God; man must discover where God is at work in human history and join His effort of 6 It is not our intent to establish deductive requirements for a viable theodicy. We contend that the issue of divine racism emerges from the events and crimes of history. The answer, likewise, must appeal to historical data and not a mere rational or theoretical formulation unsubstantiated by the actual history of blacks. It will become clear that the presuppositions of the black theologians - the politics of God, the priority of the black experience, etc. --dictate that the actual black experience, past, present, or future, must be the arena for debate, and not abstract possibilities.</page><page sequence="5">THEODICY AND METHODOLOGY 545 human liberation. But the politics of God, in the context of black theology, presupposes that God is, in fact, for the liberation of blacks. He is not, in other words, a racist. It is obvious, however, that a politics of God approach presupposes a prior demonstration that God is not a racist or else it begs the question. Is it possible to construct a black theology with the politics of God as the second story without a foundational theodicy which refutes the charge of divine racism? And what has just been argued for relative to the politics of God holds as well for another crucial category in black theology: blacks as God's chosen people. This is partic- ularly the case if one makes vicarious suffering, as Washington does, defining for the elect. Finally, if black theology defines itself as a theology of libera- tion or revolution, the theodicy question is again controlling. For if the impulse to liberation is to obtain, the suffering implicit in the present situation of blacks must be interpreted as oppressive. Clearly, not every theodicy provides the requisite interpretation. Indeed, certain ones, e.g., a theodicy which entails quietism, must be labeled counter-revolutionary. Our point is this: a theology of liberation must formulate not just a theodicy, but one with a specific character. Moreover, to clear the field for itself, it must spell out the deficiencies of alternative theodicies. Our summary can be brief: the foundation the black theologian constructs for his system must be a theodicy which refutes the claim, God is a white racist. Whether Washington, Cone, and Cleage supply the indispensable rebuttal must now be determined by critically analyzing their respective answers to the theodicy question. II Washington's theodicy is an elaboration of the suffering servant theme. God is engaged in human history for a purpose which will not be frustrated. He fulfills his plan, totally or in part, through the vicarious suffering of an elect group. Black suffering, which must be the suffering of the entire group, is the means by which God's plan is realized. Washington moves between two different but related soterio- logical roles for blacks. There is, on the one hand, a universal</page><page sequence="6">546 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW mission to the total human family which parallels the saving role of another chosen people, the Jews. Their task is "to witness to the one God," while the mission of blacks "is to witness to the one humanity of the one God." 6 The realization of the universal mission of blacks both begins with and hinges upon the successful completion of a more particular assignment: the concrete salvation of the white oppressor in America from the shackles of his own racism and white folk religion, i.e., irreligion. Blacks should not seek to evade the suffering inherent in their roles; actually, they could not, even if they hoped for release. Since one's status as suffering servant-chosen people is rooted in God's choice, a choice consequently that cannot be nullified, one cannot choose not to be the suffering servant-chosen people. One can choose not to be obedient to the demands of one's mission - but only at the peril of rebelling against God himself. Washington is willing to affirm that, ultimately, the only hope for the success of black liberation is to follow the path he describes - through the valley and shadow of vicarious suffering. For it is this path alone which God demands and therefore nurtures. The deficiencies of Washington's theodicy, in our view, are severe, if not fatal. Before describing them, it is necessary to isolate the structure of his argument and thus provide a framework for our criticism. The argument appears to have the following structure: (a) If blacks are the suffering servant-chosen people, then the charge of divine racism is refuted. (b) Blacks are the suffering servant- chosen people. (c) Therefore, the charge of divine racism is refuted. To round out the argument it is necessary to show that the category of the suffering servant-chosen people, the corner- stone of his theodicy, carries two meanings for Washington, and each constitutes a refutation of divine racism. To be chosen means that one has found favor in God's sight. Chosenness is also essentially related to one's salvation. Clearly the validity of his argument is contingent upon his establishing (b). We question whether the label of suffering servant-chosen people is justified on the basis of Washington's evidence. 6 The Politics of God (Beacon, 1969), 158.</page><page sequence="7">THEODICY AND METHODOLOGY 547 An analysis of Isaiah 53: 5-12, the section Washington cites as support for his classification, is our point of departure. Our reading concludes that two conditions are required to index an individual or group in the category of suffering-servant. (i) There is the fact of suffering, but suffering as a necessary condi- tion. (2) There is a radical shift in the status of the suffering individual or group which we will name the liberation event or factor. The shift comprises something similar to the principle of "from last to first." If we call (i) the situation of humiliation, then (2) would designate exaltation or reward. The references, "I will divide him a portion with the great" and "He shall divide the spoil with the strong," supply the general sense of (2) that is intended. Even where the liberation event is interpreted escha- tologically, i.e., the change in status is yet to come, it is on the basis of the eschatological event that the present suffering, for instance, is alleged to be unjustified. Two rhetorical questions summarize our point. Can we speak of Jesus as Lord if we speak only of the cross and omit the resurrection? Can we speak of blacks as suffering servant-chosen people if the only evidence given is their suffering? The point can be put in another way. Without the liberation event how can we differentiate between two mutually exclusive alternatives, vicarious suffering and suffering as deserved punish- ment? Is it not premature to classify someone as suffering ser- vant-chosen people prior to the occurrence of the liberation event? 7 Is it not incumbent upon Washington, from the method- ological standpoint, to designate the liberation event(s) for blacks which justifies the label, chosen people-suffering servant? One might argue that the eschatological option is available for black theology; the liberation event is yet to come. This option, from our vantage point, is a theological dead end, for, in the final analysis, it leaves the issue of God's racism unresolved until the eschaton. Prior to the actual eschatological event, and in the face 7 Though the category of deserved punishment stands in essential contradiction to WASIRINGTON'S position, he gives it only scant attention. The following seems to be his only "refutation" of the alternative of deserved punishment. "Historically, the systematic victimization of the African and the American Negro has been accepted as the punishment of the will of God. But this very belief sparks the reality so opposite, the truth of hope; these victims bear the marks of those blessed of God to do his work of love . .. .," 176.</page><page sequence="8">548 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW of black suffering, God's favor and disfavor relative to blacks remain equally probable. Moreover, it would appear that Washington further undercuts the strength of his theodicy when he acknowledges that the reason for God's choice of blacks as suffering servant-chosen people "is no more fathomable than His choice of Israel to be His 'suffering servant.' "s Does not the uncertainty regarding the reason for the election make problematical Washington's stipulation of a specific purpose for the selection? Washington's theodicy is even more questionable when we con- sider that it appears to entail a consequence which is clearly consistent with the concept of a racist God: the perpetuity of black suffering. He appears to establish an either/or situation in which both alternatives involve suffering. There is, on the one hand, the inevitable suffering associated with blacks as suffering servant; on the other, blacks suffer because "Negroes will always be black and objectionable to whites." " The former cannot be evaded because it expresses the will of ultimate reality, the latter because blacks are powerless in a racist society. Consequently, the Negro has the choice either "to be what he is, 'suffering servant,' the source of power, or fatalistically acquiesce in suffering. ... ." 10 Black suffering will be terminated, according to Washington, only when their soteriological mission is complete, and this may not occur until the eschaton. In a similar vein he concludes: "The continuing chastisement of the Jews may be to the end of time." 11 If I understand Washington correctly, he is affirming that blacks will not be liberated until their assignment is successfully con- cluded. "The Negro will receive no reward until all are healed." 12 In reading Washington, we have the nagging suspicion that black suffering is intended as much for white liberation as for black freedom. In fact, one could argue that the position is weighted in favor of white freedom since black reward is contingent upon the success of their soteriological assignment. The suspicion grows even stronger when we note that slavery, for Washington, is a s WASHINGTON, 173. 9 WASHINGTON, 173. 10 WASHINGTON, 166. 11 WASHINGTON, 158. 12 WASHINGTON, 160.</page><page sequence="9">THEODICY AND METHODOLOGY 549 necessary part of God's purpose and, moreover, less "bruising" than the present mission."3 If this were not sufficient to make one distrust the God he represents, Washington further asserts that though God's purpose demanded the exodus of the Jews from bondage in Egypt, the will of God for the Negro does not include a similar exodus. We do not think it unfair to suggest that blacks should at least ponder over God's purpose and motive if it involves the type of suffering Washington describes - particularly without a corresponding suffering for whites. Washington's theodicy, we submit, does not disprove the charge of divine racism, rather it has the net effect of reaffirming the charge. III It is to Cone's merit that he avoids a theodicy which implies the perpetuity of black suffering. Indeed, the opposite impulse informs his approach. The elect are not chosen to suffer for the other, not even indirectly; their election entails, instead, their release from suffering and bondage. Yet his theodicy, in our view, is also a failure since it does not falsify the assertion, God is a white racist. The logical structure of Cone's argument parallels that of Wash- ington. Three steps can be indicated. (i) A class is posited that involves a special and favored relation to deity. For Washington, as we saw, this class was the suffering servant-chosen people; for Cone, the oppressed. (2) It is argued that blacks are members of the class in question. (3) The conclusion follows: God is not a racist. The major support for Cone's argument boils down to an ex- egetical demonstration that the liberation of the oppressed is the core of the biblical Heilsgeschichte. This, in turn, is the ground for the other pillar of his theodicy: "The liberation of the op- pressed is a part of the innermost nature of God." " Making liberation the essence of God serves a dual purpose. It links 1 "Slavery was but the means for inextricably binding the Negro and the Caucasian. Without this binding the immeasurably more bruising work of releasing whites from their blasphemous bondage to whiteness and racial superiority cannot be done," I57. 14CONE, 121.</page><page sequence="10">550 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW blacks to the biblical acts of liberation, and, consequently, it answers, at the same time, the question of divine racism. If "liberation is . . . the essence of divine activity," " racism, by definition, is not possible. Thus, God's acts of liberation in the past, which are the clue to his character, purpose, and motive, are sufficient grounds for blacks to rest assured that he has made their liberation his concern and is in their midst as they struggle towards freedom. Cone is willing to conclude that if God is not "identified totally" with the goals of blacks, he is a murderer, i.e., a racist, and the only appropriate response for blacks is deicide."l One other feature of Cone's theodicy deserves special attention. His approach does not explain the "why" of black suffering; nor does he seek to harmonize it with God's will or purpose. He is content to see white racism as the cause. The weight of his argu- ment falls upon what God has done for the oppressed in the past and, thus by implication, what he is now doing about black oppression. Black suffering does not imply divine racism, because God is presently participating in the black struggle for freedom. If our analysis is correct,'7 Cone's position is vulnerable at crucial points. The first crucial issue is whether the first step of his argument begs the question; the same question can also be put to Washington. To posit a class that presupposes a favored rela- tion to God - and the term oppressed carries this stipulative meaning for Cone - is to exclude the alternative of God's disfavor by definition. Of equal importance is whether Cone has substantiated the claim that the liberation of blacks is essential to God's being. We wish to show that, on his own terms, the claim can be corroborated only by pointing to concrete acts of God in behalf of black liberation - not acts for some other group. That is, once the issue of God's racism is raised, the fact of his liberating activity for non-blacks, e.g., the Israelites, is irrelevant to the charge, God is a white racist. The exodus may refute the accusation of anti- Semitism but not racism. Our criticism gains clarity when we consider Albert Cleage's 15 CONE, 121. 1" CONE, 59--60. 17 We have not included CONE's treatment of theodicy in Black Theology and Black Power on the assumption that his later work presents his definitive position.</page><page sequence="11">THEODICY AND METHODOLOGY 551 response to the same issue. That God is liberating blacks is estab- lished by Cleage at the outset in terms of his concepts of the blackness of God, Jesus, and the Jews. The physical blackness of God and Jesus - not their symbolic blackness - partially con- firms their status as "soul" brother and assures their active par- ticipation in the struggle for black freedom. By regarding the Jews as black, he guarantees, again at the outset, the fact of God's liberating effort in behalf of the particular group at issue. In summary, the scandal of particularity, which is raised by virtue of the nature of black suffering, can only be answered by reference to the particularity of God's liberating activity, e.g., an exodus for blacks. Let us consider some decisive statements from Cone himself to show that they support our interpretation. "There is no revelation of God without a condition of oppression which develops into a situation of liberation." 8 What can this statement mean except that revelation presupposes the two conditions we detailed in the previous section: suffering and the liberation event? Must we not conclude that in the absence of the latter, there is no revelation, and consequently, no knowledge of God's nature? In the absence of the liberation event for blacks, is it possible to speak of the liberation of blacks as implicit in God's innermost nature? Other statements yield the same conclusion. He rejects the suggestion that knowledge of God "as he is in himself" is possible and also the view that we can know God "independently of his liberating work." 9 When we combine these with another claim, our criticism is justified. "Black theology," he claims, "cannot accept a view of God which does not represent him as being for blacks and thus against whites . . . We must know where God is and what he is doing in the revolution. There is no use for a God who loves whites the same as blacks." 20 Does not Cone's position here push him to the conclusion that blacks can know God as for them, as liberator, only if there are concrete acts of black liberation where the hand of God is detected? To conclude that God is on the side of blacks because he has participated in the liberation of non-blacks is to assign a character to God which, in 18 CONE, gI. Emphasis supplied. 19 CONE, 133. 2o CONE, 131-32.</page><page sequence="12">552 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Cone's own terms, has not been established. It is to speak of God "independently of his liberating acts." Is it not comparable to arguing that since Huey Long was on the side of the oppressed, i.e., Southern whites, he was also on the side of blacks? Finally, can we fail to give full weight to this point? The con- ditions Cone cites as the basis for saying blacks are oppressed and thereby the beneficiary of God's liberating work - "blacks are humiliated because they are black"- are, in fact, the same con- ditions one would expect if God were a racist. We submit that Cone has not substantiated the one fact which his own position asserts must be shown if God is not a murderer, namely, that black liberation is a part of his innermost nature. If this is the case, the remainder of the system is without a sturdy foundation. Obviously, the equation between black theology and the Gospel he advocates becomes suspect. Further, the black factor of his theology would lose its support. It is on the basis of God's identification with the oppressed, i.e., blacks, and his as- sumption of their condition that he is able to speak of a black Christ. But if the issue of God's relation to blacks remains unresolved, there is no basis for speaking of a black Christ. What options are available to Cone to authenticate the libera- tion event for blacks? He can adopt Cleage's approach which makes the exodus, for instance, an act of black liberation since the Jews, in Cleage's system, are black. Another possibility is to isolate the liberation factor or progress of events through a survey of black history, but his own position makes this option unattrac- tive. His claim, previously considered, that God must be for blacks and against whites has this methodological consequence: he can prove that God is on the side of blacks only if he also marshals empirical warrant for God's opposition to whites. It is embarrassing even to mention that whites have been on top for centuries. Moreover, he could not legitimately speak of a pro- gressive improvement for blacks if their status relative to whites did not measurably improve. An appeal to white racism as the cause of black suffering would simply shift the issue to another level. The central question would then be to account for white racism in the context of God's sovereignty and his alleged op- position to whites.</page><page sequence="13">THEODICY AND METHODOLOGY 553 The option of eschatological confirmation, the liberation event(s) is yet to come, also appears to be closed by Cone's own position, though his thought may be inconsistent here. It should be clear that an eschatological verification would not fit with his argument that blacks must know here and now whose side God is on, for, as we have already argued, the actual effect of escha- tological confirmation is to leave the issue of divine racism un- resolved until the eschaton. Moreover, Cone rejects the concept of eschatological compen- sation for this-worldly suffering, but curiously, he introduces something strikingly similar in content and intent. He finds it necessary to postulate "the future reality of life after death" 21 for various reasons: to substantiate that God is on the side of blacks, to insure that fear of death will not lead to defeatism and thus diminish one's total commitment to the struggle, to assure that the death of the black freedom fighter is not meaningless, etc. One wonders, however, what the real difference is between the eschatological perspective he accepts and the one he rejects. The slave eschatology promised compensation for those who suffer patiently here; while Cone's eschatology guarantees reward and meaning for those who die valiantly here. Though the difference reflects a much needed corrective for black ethics, is it an improve- ment on black theodicy? I raise this question because the follow- ing possibility sticks in my mind. Consider: the promise of a future reality after death motivates blacks to make the ultimate sacrifice for their liberation, and this is the means by which a racist God beckons blacks to suicidal efforts and thus accom- plishes black genocide. IV The core of Cleage's position seems to be a complex of cate- gories which he does not explicitly relate to the theodicy issue. As we suggested above, the concepts of the blackness of God, Jesus, and the Jews, along with the view of the particularity of the divine action for liberation, constitute an answer to the ques- tion of divine racism. Since these categories also form the core 21 CONE, 247.</page><page sequence="14">554 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW of Cleage's total system, their description and criticism would require another article. Our admittedly incomplete analysis must, accordingly, be an outline of the argument we would present if space and time permitted. Cleage's refutation of God's racism is reducible to two points. (i) To be on the side of blacks requires that one be like them, i.e., physically black; thus the necessity of a black God and a black Jesus. (2) Since not everyone who is black is also a "soul" broth- er, there must be concrete evidence of God's activity in their behalf. Here the major evidential materials are the exodus and the revolutionary ministry of Jesus, the black messiah, to the black nation, Israel. The same point is affirmed when blacks are considered as the chosen people, which means that God is working for their emancipation. It is important, for purposes of criticism, to recognize the logi- cal connection between (i) and (2). In the final analysis (2) is dependent upon the demonstration of (i). It is only on the basis of the blackness of God, Jesus, and the Jews that the exodus, for instance, becomes an event of black liberation. Thus, it becomes necessary to consider how he defends the particularity of God's saving activity based on an identity of pigmentation with the specific group in question. The concept of the imago dei is the ground for claiming that God is black. Specifically, according to Cleage, we must describe God as some "combination" of the actual characteristics of the human family considered in terms of their numerical representa- tion. Since an empirical analysis indicates that there are black men, red men, yellow men, and "a few, a mighty few, white men," it can be concluded that God must be some combination of red, yellow, and black, "with just a little touch of white, and (hence) we must think of God as a black God." 22 To reach the latter conclusion Cleage emphasizes the American view that one drop of black blood makes one black. Though Cleage's argument refutes the charge of divine racism, it must be noted that he depends upon an interpretation of the imago dei concept which leads to very dubious consequences, and these undercut the value of his refutation. It is obvious that the 22 The Black Messiah (Sheed and Ward, 1969), 42-43.</page><page sequence="15">THEODICY AND METHODOLOGY 555 "combination" interpretation of the imago dei can be applied to other features of the divine nature as well. If we conclude that God is a combination of the various hues represented in the human family, must we not also apply the combination interpretation to the category of weight, size, sex, intelligence, etc. The logical consequence, it appears, would be total anthropomorphism. More- over, since Cleage utilizes the combination interpretation in an exclusive way - "Certainly thou must understand that as black people, it would be impossible for us to kneel before thee, be- lieving thee to be a white God - " 23 would not a plurality of gods, each with a different color, be necessary to accommodate the human family of worshippers? Special note, moreover, should be made of the fact that Cleage does not establish that God is black but only non-white. Accor- dingly, it is also appropriate to speak of a yellow messiah or a red messiah. We turn now to Cleage's explicit treatment of black suffering, and here he utilizes the category of deserved punishment. This interpretive framework, at first glance, seems odd, for it would appear to entail quietism. If the suffering is deserved, then evasion is inappropriate. Further, if it is the result of God's dis- favor, then it is futile, as Father Paneloux observers in The Plague, to try to escape the full brunt of the punishment. Cleage avoids the albatross of quietism by making quietism itself the sin which is being punished. Blacks are being punished because of their failure to affirm their manhood by challenging every dehumanizing act of the oppressor. To round out this side of the theodicy other features must be described. God's nature, i.e., the morality of the universe, requires an atoning act for each sin. The atonement must be man's work, and the act of atonement must be the antithesis of the sin under question. "For every moment of cowardice, there must be a moment of courage." 24 In sum, our suffering will continue until we have made total restitution for our past sins, and it is pre- supposed that the sins of the father are visited upon the son. We would question whether the category of deserved punish- CLEAGE, 46-47. 4 CLEAGE, 27I.</page><page sequence="16">556 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW ment can carry the weight Cleage places upon it. We find it difficult to describe the nature of the sin which requires the degree of suffering blacks have experienced since coming to America. Is the sin to be traced to an African past? It would seem that the character of black suffering in Cleage's analysis raises the issue of the commensurability of sin and punishment. To make our point another way. We argued that the crucial issue for Washington and Cone was the identification of the liberating event for blacks; for Cleage, it is the identification of the sin for which black suffering is the restitution. What we are suggesting, indirectly, is that Cleage's position carries within it a hint of the perpetuity of black suffering. His argument that every sin must be matched by an antithetical act is open-ended to the extent that one can never know when full satisfaction has been made. And one wonders why God insists upon parity between sin and suffering when it is allowed that God was willing to "break the very laws of the universe" 25 for his chosen people. Nor is it apparent that his position can accommodate white non-suffering. In the light of continued black suffering and white non-suffering, what are we to conclude about whites, particularly when we invoke the rigid principle of equal satisfaction for each sin? Has another people replaced blacks as God's chosen? Must we conclude that God has broken the rules of the universe in their favor by nullifying the necessity of punishment for their crime of white racism? In general terms, Cleage must explain how it is that blacks are God's chosen people in light of the fact that whites were allowed to get on top and stay there. Cleage's framework would allow him to conclude that black suffering is due to black sin, therefore the issue of the status of whites is irrelevant. We admit this, but such a line of argumentation would also sever, it appears, any causal connection between white racism and black suffering. In sum, we find Cleage's theodicy to be an unsure answer to the question of divine racism. ' CLEAGE, 242.</page><page sequence="17">THEODICY AND METHODOLOGY 557 V A description of our positions falls beyond the scope of this article, but we must emphasize that it does not enlist the position of divine racism. We would see black suffering in particular and suffering in general as simply a matter of powerlessness. We would also find the framework of humanistic existentialism to be a more viable framework for black theology than the scaffolding we find in Washington, Cone, and Cleage. We hope to have more to say on these themes in the near future.26 2 Cf. my forthcoming work, Is God a White Racist? Prolegomenon to Black Theology.</page></plain_text>
