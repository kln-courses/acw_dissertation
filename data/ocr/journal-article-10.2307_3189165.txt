<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Weight/lessness of Sin: Donne's "Thou hast made me" and the Psychostatic Tradition FRANCES M. MALPEZZI Arkansas State University Through the tropological level of allegory, seventeenth-century devo- tional writers present paradigmatic journeys to what historian of reli- gion Mircea Eliade calls sacred time, recreating for and within the reader the crucial events of Christian mythology.' Transcending the realm of the secular and mundane, the poet encapsules the spiritual history of humankind in the word and can return the reader to the Creation, through the discovery of the paradise within; to the Incarnation, as each soul becomes the virginal womb fructified with the Man-God; to the Nativity, as the soul gives birth to joy; to the Circumcision and the cutting of the fleshly heart; to the Crucifixion, as the old Adam dies to sin; and to the Resurrection, as the new Adam emerges from the sepulchre, the heart's virgin tomb. Yet the pilgrimage through sacred time is a journey not only to the spiritual past of humanity, but to the future as well. In a sermon on Psalm 38.3, Donne argues that the faculty of memory enables the Christian to move both backward and forward through sacred time. Asserting that the individual who hears no ser- mons and reads no scriptures still has the Bible, Donne articulates the way in which the major events of Christianity are contained within the memory and pattern one's daily existence: He hath a Genesis in his memory; he cannot forget his Creation; he hath an Exodus in his memory; he cannot forget that God hath delivered him, from some kind of Egypt, from some oppression; He hath a Leviticus in his memory; hee cannot forget, that God hath proposed to him some Law, some rules to be observed. He hath all in his memory, even to the Revelation; God hath revealed to him, even at midnight alone, what shall be his portion, in the next world; And if he dare but remember that nights communication between God and him, he is well-near learned enough.2 As it encompasses all of Christian time, past and future, memory reveals God to man, taking him back to his origins and forward to the</page><page sequence="2">70 South Central Review Roger van der Weyden: Christ the Judge and St. Michael, Central Panel of the Last Judgment Altarpiece.

It is just such a hierophantic progress, the memory's movement toward the apocalyptic revelation, which Donne's "Thou hast made me" embodies in the speaker's im- aginative rush toward death and judgment. Donne translates his reader from the profane to the sacred, providing in his speaker a model for the internalization of the Christian Psychostasis, the weighing of the souls of the dead. A reading of Donne's poem is, therefore, enhanced when we approach it with an awareness of its visual and literary prototypes from the psychostatic tradition. The psychostasis as a representation of divine judgment has its roots in the religion, art, and literature of pre-Christian civilizations.3 As both Louis Reau and Mary Phillips Perry have demonstrated, the theme can be traced to ancient Egypt.4 In The Book of the Dead (1400 B.C.) and its visual depictions Anubis weighs the soul of the deceased, and later Egyptian theology portrays this same weighing as done by one of "the highest daimons, the chief guardian angel."5 The imagery also exists in the Old Testament, most notably in Job 31.6 ("Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity") and Daniel 5.27 ("Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting"). Psycho- stasis also occurs in the Koran, where those whose balances are heavy shall be happy and those with light balances shall lose their souls.6 In classical literature the temporal destiny of the individual is determined by a supernatural being by means of the scales. The most significant examples of this occur in Books 8 and 22 of The Iliad and in Book 14 of The Aeneid.7 Perry also notes the depictions of psychostasis in Hellenistic art, where most frequently Hermes presides over the scales.8 Psychostasis also has a long and rich history in the Christian tradition, known representations dating back as early as 923 AD.9 The weighing usually occurs in connection with the Last Judgment, though at times the particular judgment is portrayed. In Christian art, the archangel Michael generally assumes the role of psychopomp, the conductor of souls to the afterworld. Clad in angelic garb or in armor, Michael presides over the scales. The relative merit of the individual, the sum total of good and evil, is determined in the scale pan. If evil outweighs good or if the good is so insubstantial that the individual weighed in the balance is "found wanting," he is damned. The scale pans may contain personifications of the virtues and vices of the individual or, variously, "non-anthropomorphic symbols of redeeming grace-the Lamb, the Chalice or the Gospel book--... [which are] opposed to equally non- anthropomorphic symbols of evil such as reptiles, millstones or devil's masks."1' One psychostatic motif includes Satanic intervention at the time of the weighing-a demonic figure will try to cheat the scales, sometimes using a hook to pull the sinner down, sometimes climbing into the scale to add to the sinful burden. This intervention also has a heavenly counterpart as Mary, for example, because of some past</page><page sequence="4">Frances M. Malpezzi 73 devotion on the individual's part, intervenes to save the sinner by adding the weight of a rosary or her hand to the scale pan weighing his merits."1 Some of these basic components of the psychostatic tradition can be isolated and identified in Donne's "Thou hast made me." In Donne's sonnet we are tropologically projected into the sacred time of psychostasis as the speaker, flanked by death and despair, the spiritual death that inevitably accompanies sin, ponders his condition. Addressing his Creator, he laments his decay and prays for restoration. Like the ruin depicted symbolically in so many Annunciation and Nativity paintings, his physical condition elucidates the need for God's redemptive grace. Echoing the languishing psalmist who finds no health in his bones, whose eye wastes away as he grows weak, who feels the heavy burden of his iniquities (in Psalms 6 and 38, for example), Donne's persona complains of his "dimme eyes" (1. 5) and his "febled flesh," flesh wasted by sin that also weighs it toward hell (11. 7- 8). Sin and its correlative despair are by nature corruptive, blinding the sinner and transforming him to airy thinness, to the very negation which sin is. Donne's comments in a sermon on Psalm 38.3 are applica- ble to the afflicted condition of the speaker in this sonnet: "In this sinner, despaire shall have suck'd out all the marrow of these Bones, and so there shall bee no soundnesse in his flesh" (Sermons, II, 85). The physical condition of Donne's speaker and the psalmist emblematically portrays the spiritual condition, and the weakened body becomes the symbol of the soul, whose very essence has been depleted. In another sermon on Psalm 38.3, Donne writes: "Every sin leaves us worse, then it found us, and we rise poorer, ignobler, weaker, for every nights sin, then we lay down" (Sermons, II, 100-01). Just as lust was believed to shorten the lifespan, so all sins-like the mole of death in Herbert's "Grace"-eat at the heart, "gnaw upon us, to eat out this Image" of God that is the life of the soul (Sermons, X, 46). Paradoxically, while sin, the absence of good, consumes life and negates the sinner, it also adds a tremendous burden to the individual's being, a millstone round the neck. This is the "wofull riddle" of which Donne writes: "sin is but a privation, and yet there is not such another positive possession: sin is nothing, and yet there is nothing else" (Sermons, II, 88). In "Thou hast made me," we are overwhelmed by the speaker's sense of urgency as well as by the desperation of his plea as his end "doth haste" (1. 2). All too aware of the transience of life and its ephemeral pleasures, he finds himself running toward death, and we can almost hear the fateful horseman galloping to meet him. Yet in the midst of this desperate haste, this flight through life, there is stasis also, as he feels frozen, paralyzed: "I dare not move my dimme eyes any way, / Despaire behind, and death before doth cast / Such terrour" (11. 5-7). Not unlike the speaker in "Goodfriday," who is "almost...glad" he cannot see the "spectacle" of Christ's crucifixion, who is afraid to look at the dreadful</page><page sequence="5">74 South Central Review consequences of his sins, the speaker in Donne's sonnet is so rigidified by guilt that he cannot turn his eyes to God. Roger Rollin, who finds the Holy Sonnets unified through a persona suffering from religious melan- choly, notes in this sonnet the typical clinical conditions of "psychomo- tor agitation," as the speaker runs toward death (1. 3), and of "psychomotor retardation" (evident in 11. 5-7), which renders the speaker "all but catatonic."12 As the dynamic forces of apocalyptic fear and consuming guilt play upon the speaker, they transform his memory into the archangelic psychopomp that conveys the soul to its eschatolog- ical ponderation. While flesh and life are all too quickly eclipsed by sin and death, the speaker weighs himself in the balance and finds himself wanting. The cumulation of evil (perhaps those very "pleasures" that are now "like yesterday" [1. 4]) is more substantial than the good in his life. The sinister scale pan that measures his iniquity sinks under its burden and "t'wards hell doth weigh" (1. 8). In the first part of the poem, then, as the decaying speaker envisions his death, he is-thrust forward to the sacred time of Judgment. The memory, which Donne sees as containing the past and future events of Christian mythology, functions as psychopomp, leading the soul through an enactment of its final judgment. The process the persona undergoes is one Donne elsewhere describes as the end result of belief in and meditation on the coming judgment: For, this is one great benefit from the present contemplation of the future judgement, that whosoever does truly, and advisedly believe, that ever he shall come to that judgement, is at it now; He that believes that God will judge him, is Gods Commissioner, Gods Delegate, and, in his name, judges himself now. (Sermons, VIII, 343) We have, furthermore, not only the presence of the psychopomp and the experience of weighing in the poem, but also other motifs of the psychostasis as well, most notably references to divine and demonic intervention. As the sinner is plummeted toward hell, the Creator answers the plea of his creature. The speaker's prayer for renewal, for recreation, is granted in the reparation of his vision. Despair, a type of spiritual blindness, is, for the time, remedied, and he now looks with hope to the Lord. As his eyes lift to the Creator "above," so he ascends spiritually, the burden of his sins now lightened. In his sermons, Donne notes that the weight of sin is eased when we consider not merely the justice of God, but his mercy as well: Till I come to hear that voice, Come unto me all you that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you, till I come to consider my sin in the mercy of God, and not onely in his justice, in his punishments, my sins will be too heavy for me. (Sermons, II, 125)</page><page sequence="6">Frances M. Malpezzi 75 Donne further asserts that the Christian must bury his sins in the wounds of the Savior-then "they cannot be too heavy for me, for they are not upon me at all" (Sermons, II, 125). In Donne's poem, of course, we do not have the interposition of a rosary or other blessing on the dexter scale; rather we have the removal of the weight of sin from the sinister scale, the subsuming of the speaker's sins by the God above (his Creator and Recreator) and the magnetizing force of divine love, which draws even the "iron heart" to it. This psychostasis thus reflects not only God's justice, but his mercy, much as Eugene Cunnar has shown the image of God's golden scales to operate in Paradise Lost.13 Yet because this is not the last great day, but a temporal foreshadow- ing of it (and thus still governed by the laws of postlapsarian nature), the speaker knows he will fall again through the subterfuges of the devil: "But our old subtle foe so tempteth me, / That not one houre I can my selfe, sustaine" (11. 11-12). Dependent, he realizes that his eternal destiny hangs in the balance throughout his temporal existence. Like the speaker in Herbert's "The Flower," he repeatedly experiences dam- nation and salvation: These are thy wonders, Lord of power, Killing and quickning, bringing down to hell And up to heaven in an houre.14 By hook or by crook, Donne's speaker knows, Satan will try to drag him to damnation, while the mercies of God would sustain him. Created by God, unmade by sin, restored by his maker, Donne's speaker exem- plifies the repeated creation/fall/recreation pattern of Christian history and of each Christian's earthly existence. Within the speaker we see the microcosmic conflict between the forces of Good and Evil. Though clad in the armor of God, the memory as psychopomp does not have the archangelic strength to battle and defeat Leviathan. Throughout the poem the weakness, the unworthiness, and the vulnerability of the speaker are stressed. It is only through the power and goodness of God that he is made and remade. The conclu- sion of the poem makes this emphatic: "Thy Grace may wing me to prevent his art / And thou like Adamant draw mine iron heart" (11. 13- 14). Although the persona alone cannot plunge his sword into the dragon who would drag him down, when he is instilled with divine grace, he can rise to salvation, can overcome the burden of his ini- quities, can triumph over the forces of evil-not on his own merit, but through the mercies of his savior. As Donne asserts, it is only through the application of the grace of the crucified Christ that the individual can find salvation: I can doe whatsoever hee hath done, by applying his sufferings to my soule for all; my sins are his, and all his merit is mine: And all my sins</page><page sequence="7">76 South Central Review shall no more hinder my ascending into heaven, nor my sitting at the right hand of God, in mine own person, then they hindered him, who bore them all in his person, mine onely Lord and Saviour Christ Jesus, blessed for ever. (Sermons, II, 143) And Love is the magnetizing force that attracts, overcoming the sinner's disadvantage-the weight of his sin-hardened, iron-flinty heart that would sink into the abysmal depths were it not for the Creator, who draws his creation to himself. In his Occasional Meditations, Joseph Hall comments on the spiritual significance of two magnetic forces, lodestone (which draws iron) and jet (which attracts dust): Methinks I see in these two a mere emblem of the hearts of men and their spiritual attractives. The grace of God's spirit, like the true lodestone or adamant, draws up the iron heart of man to it and holds it in a constant fixedness of holy purposes and good actions. The world, like the jet, draws up the sensual hearts of light and vain men and holds them fast in the pleasures of sin. I am Thine iron, oh Lord, be Thou my lodestone. Draw Thou me and I shall run after Thee; knit my heart unto Thee that I may fear Thy name [I Chron. 12: 17].1s The desire of the persona in "Thou hast made me" is in accord with this meditant's. Recognizing the power of divine love, Donne's speaker would be drawn to God rather than to those ephemeral worldly plea- sures of yesterday, which have spiritually deadened him and weighed him down. In Donne's "Thou hast made me," the speaker paradigmatically ponders his soul in his tropological experience of the Christian psycho- stasis. As Rollin argues, we see in this, as in the other Holy Sonnets, "an archetypal human crisis" as the speaker struggles "to establish some kind of efficacious relationship with God."16 The process leaves the persona with a greater knowledge of himself and his relationship to his maker, thus preparing him for the ultimate revelation of Judgment Day. And, through the dramatic and fictional example of the speaker, Donne, the poet, publicly ministers to all those who must wake from "sinnes sleep, and deaths" to "Salute the last, and everlasting day."</page><page sequence="8">Frances M.
