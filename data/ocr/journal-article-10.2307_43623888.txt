<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gardening with Jacky Ray Alexander Ray Alexander was Jacky 's first live-in gardener. He currently works in Texas, USA. A scene lingers in my mind that strikes me as being typical of Jacky and of the garden at Sparoza. It is high summer and she is pausing before a dry, sunbaked portion of the hill which had been captured by one of Zouganellis' stone walls but not tamed. There she conjures for a summer visitor the magnificent picture of a mandrake-to-be hiding in dormancy beneath the red earth, adding as relish the tale of its extrac- tion from Delian soil and its especial historical precedence in Ekistics 314/315, Sept. /Oct. - Nov. /Dec. 1985 513</page><page sequence="2">being the original reintroduction of the species to Attica. Finally, before moving on, she gives the anthropomorphic root a word or two of praise and encouragement. On down the path, a small, barer portion of the border might give rise to rich images of autumn crocuses; and over there a winter iris might be brought to life before its season. This invisible garden added immeasurably to one's overall enjoyment and appreciation of the scene. One might forget what was actual- ly seen at the time, but one would always recall the unseen mandrake and the bright enthusiasm of its protectress. She was especially fond of these buried treasures, these Wildlings that tied the villa garden to the ancient hillside and to Nature. And for those of us lucky enough to experience the Attic hillside coming to life with the autumn rains - the bee orchids, the saffron crocus, the cyclamen and ane- mones, the wild gladiola, the autumn lilies and the greening of the mountain thyme - it was easy to understand and to share her enthusiasm for this magical and delicate fluores- cence of the harsh and seemingly inhospitable rock. The garden more outwardly visible to the summer visitor might be called the English Garden. Here the luxurious drifts of perennials and annuals were crowded into their specially terraced beds. It was a garden with links to student days with Miss Willmott. There were mounds of pelargoniums; great clumps of felicias and marguerites; tall strapping rows of hol- lyhocks (until Clara the goat, took a craving for them), a cha- momile path, walls lined with wallflowers, a magnificent Ital- ian anchusa, right in the path, all the more loved for being a volunteer. Here were the grand experiments and the rare seedlings from the world over, choice herbs and vegetables for table. Under a pomegranate tree a weathered Sussex trug full of well used tools lay unaware of its own geographi- cal incongruity. A delight to look upon from the house or a neighboring hillside, this was the garden of her own creation and she took much pride and joy in the accomplishment. A third garden and perhaps the most beloved of all, was the garden of Sparoza she envisioned extending into perpe- tuity; her sharing of this happy place with future generations. Though deprived as they are of the joy of knowing her and feeling the added dimensions her presence gave to the place, they who will pass unknowingly the sleeping man- drake root, they will nevertheless, thanks to her vision, thoughtfulness and love, be able to walk through those time- less fields of asphodel, and enjoy the peace and beauty that she brought to the Hill of Sparrows. Fig. 1 : With Ray Alexander, Angharad Pimpaneau (her niece) and Sally. Lesley Cunningham Lesley Cunningham was the second of Jacky's "lady gardeners." She worked at Sparoza in 1979-1980. One of my first impressions was of the openness of Sparoza to people. Visitors had no doorbells or locked doors to con- tend with, although the dogs would usually announce arriv- als. If the house was to be left with no one there, Jacky would nearly always leave the key under an upturned flower pot by the door, much to my surprise to begin with but no- thing untoward ever happened. Visitors were very much part of the life at Sparoza, whether just stopping by for a few hours or for a few days' holiday or coming for the special occasions such as Jacky's Kathara Defiera (Clean Monday) parties. One special occa- sion during my year there was a small gathering to watch the opening of a Moon Flower in the evening light. Jacky created an easy casual atmosphere at Sparoza, people came to wander round the garden or the hillside and they came to talk. While I was at Sparoza, Jacky was still working on compil- ing and refining information on the plants growing wild on the hillside and those cultivated in the garden. Jacky kept a sharp eye on her plants. Every week she would take a "head count" of the plants on the hill, noting their progress with brief descriptions, taking photographs. Every day she recorded the rainfall and the temperature, all information which would go towards building up a picture of Sparoza. Days at Sparoza had a pattern to them of garden work interspersed with the collection of the daily necessities of life such as the papers from the per√≠ptero (kiosk) and the mail from Box 14, always very important. Visits to the Friday mar- ket at Aghia Paraskevi were always enjoyed by both of us, and with the addition of a visit to the supermarket on the way home the car would be weighed down with provisions for a month. For me and I'm sure for all the others who were Jacky's "gardeners" it was a marvellous experience of Greece, which I know Jacky wanted it to be. I'm sure that Jacky had as much pleasure in showing us "her Greece" as we did in being introduced to this country - from the trips to Mycenae and Tiryns, Olympia, Delphi, to the theater at Epidavros, where we slept out under the stars, to the Easter celebra- tions and processions, and finally, earning our keep the hard way by joining in the grape harvest for the retsina we drank. 514 Ekistics 314/315, SeptJOct. - NovJDec. 1985</page><page sequence="3">Stephen Grigg Stephen Grigg, Jacky's last gardener, stayed on at Sparoza for a year and a half after her death, and is now working in Saudi Arabia. Jacky was always active in her garden at Sparoza, no matter what the weather was like. In the warm late September and early October days, she would spend hours in the garden, especially weeding. Jacky would take her small wooden stool and sit for hours weeding, usually doing the most laborious jobs and the most difficult weeds. Every second week we used to have a walk around the garden together. Jacky would carry her clip-board and pencil and note down the jobs which needed doing, in order, as she had numbers for all the areas in the garden, so it was easy to discuss an area by the number. Next to each job she would write either J.T. or S.G. depending on who was going to do the job. Whenever a plant came into flower, she would be out into the garden to see it, and then would tell me about the plant: where she collected it from, who gave it to her, how long she had had it, and if it was flowering as well or better than usual. Jacky would also go on day trips to different places in Greece, to enjoy the scenery, but always armed with a col- lection of plastic bags and a small garden fork to collect any plants which there were an abundance of. She always knew the botanical names of the plants and often she would en- counter plants which she had tried in the garden previously and tell me whether the particular species would grow in Sparoza or not. This is how, along with seeds and cuttings, she built up her collection of native flora. Seeds of other European flora were sent from botanical gardens around Europe and South Africa. Also, Jacky would go to the Athens Botanical Garden in Daphni to exchange seeds and plants with the horticulturist there. Jacky was always concerned about the health of the plants in the garden. In the unusually cold winter of 1982/83, we went around the garden covering the tender plants to protect them from the cold. One day in early January 1983, after a heavy overnight snowfall, we went out into the garden. It was very cold, and Jacky had a stick with which she would tap lightly at the branches of the trees and shrubs, to knock the snow off, so that its weight didn't break the branches. The Garden Book was an important part of her life and that winter she would spend most of the day either sorting out the slides or checking the text and the botanical names. Although I only knew Jacky for six months, I grew very close to her. Her enthusiasm and stimulation are greatly missed in her garden at Sparoza.</page></plain_text>
