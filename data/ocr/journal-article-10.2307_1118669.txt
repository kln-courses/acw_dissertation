The judiciary cannot, as the legislature may, avoid a measure, be- cause it approaches the confines of the constitution. We cannot pass it by because it is doubtful. With whatever doubts, with whatever difficulties, a case may be attended, we must decide it if it be brought before us. We have no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdic- tion which is given, than to usurp that which is not given. The one or the other would be treason to the constitution. Questions may oc- cur which we would gladly avoid, but we cannot avoid them.1 1. P. 213. 1. Marshall, C.J., in Cohens v.

Unfortunately, however, the former remedy is too gross to be meaningful, and the latter too frequently places the supplicant in a revolving-door that has an entrance but no exit. Thus the Justice's philosophy has found formidable opposition from those members of the Court who apparently appreciate that while the integrity of an institution is, indeed, threatened by trifling regard for its purposes and limits, excessive deference to institutional mechanics smacks of anthropomorphism and inverts the proper relationship of the institution as the servant of the mass of individuals who comprise society. And so while the Justice "is forever disposing of issues by assigning their disposition to some other sphere of competence"4 and defining as his special preserve ques- tions of jurisdiction, of which he has said "no type of controversy is more peculiarly fit for judicial determination,"5 another member of our highest tribunal has proceeded from the assumption that "No higher duty, no more solemn responsibility, rests upon this Court, than that of translating into living law and maintaining this constitutional shield deliberately planned and in- scribed for the benefit of every human being subject to our Constitution-of whatever race, creed or persuasion."6 The Justice would frequently withhold the benefit of the Court's deter- mination on the merits either because the controversy is not ripe for adjudica- 2.

Were my purely personal attitude relevant I should wholeheartedly associate myself with the general libertarian views in the Court's opinion, representing as they do the thought and action of a lifetime. But as judges we are neither Jew nor Gentile, neither Catholic nor agnostic. We owe equal attachment to the Constitution and are equally bound by our judicial obligations whether we derive our citizenship from the earliest or the latest immigrants to these shores. As a member of this Court I am not justified in writing my private notions of policy into the Constitution, no matter how deeply I may cherish them or how mischievous I may deem their disregard." 4.

The penchant of the Justice for a fastidious division of labor and, as a magisterial dispatcher, the assignment of controversies to other forums, may appear to be based upon the desire to rationalize and lessen the tremendous work-load of the Court. Yet he is characterized as "the leading exponent"8 of the rule that "the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment expresses a demand for civilized standards which are not defined by the specifically enumerated guarantees of the Bill of Rights"9-a rule which is of such vague scope and content that it has been the subject of an enormous volume of petitions for certiorari.10 Nor is the Justice's meticulous solicitude for the sovereignty of other jurisdictions-frequently posed in terms of self-restraint from inter- jecting personal views through the medium of the power of judicial review over those jurisdictions-without exception, for where his notion of "funda- mental" liberty or rights is violated by action of a state court11 or legisla- ture,12 or a federal agency,13 he would assert the power to strike down such action. Whatever other rationale may be attributed to the Justice's predilec- tion for jurisdictional niceties and amenities, in two significant instances involv- ing congressional action challenged as violative of constitutional prohibitions safeguarding individual civil liberties he was preoccupied with jurisdictional questions rather than the constitutionality of the legislation.14 To those liti- gants and lawyers who look to the Supreme Court to exercise its indigenous and unique power to formulate and enunciate the constitutional ethic of hu- man rights,15 Mr. Justice Frankfurter quotes, " 'it must be remembered that legislatures are ultimate guardians of the liberties and welfare of the people 7.

The proclivity of the Justice to exhibit his individual slant on issues made the editor's task difficult; but he has performed it well, although he did yield to the temptation to juxtapose opinions of the Justice which, superficially at least, appeared to contain conflicting ideas. But the question presents itself: why has the editor chosen at this time to collect the opinions of Mr. Justice Frankfurter in a printed volume? An article would permit an author to cover a larger area of the Justice's judicial thinking with greater insight and in less space.18 True, an article would lack the opulent style of the Justice's opin- ions; but an article is the more appropriate vehicle for a milestone along a road which has a future as well as a past, while a volume seems to suggest a certain finality. Indeed, the editor must have been confident that his volume 16. United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303, 319 (1946). 17. The Justice has most recently stated his approach to state legislation affecting First Amendment rights in his concurring opinion in American Federation of Labor v. American Sash and Door Company, 335 U.S. 538, 555-56 (1949) (reprinted in KONEF- SKY, op. cit. supra note 2, at 67): "In the day-to-day working of our democracy it is vital that the power of the lnon-democratic organ of our Government be exercised with rigorous self-restraint. Because the powers exercised by this Court are inherently oli- garchic, Jefferson all of his life thought of the Court as 'an irresponsible body' and 'independent of the nation itself.' The Court is not saved from being oligarchic because it professes to act in the service of humane ends. As history amply proves, the judiciary is prone to misconceive the public good by confounding private notions with constitu- tional requirements, and such misconceptions are not subject to legitimate displacement by the will of the people except at too slow a pace. Judges appointed for life whose decisions run counter to prevailing opinion cannot be voted out of office and supplanted by men of views more consonant with it. They are even farther removed from demo- cratic pressures by the fact that their deliberations are in secret and remain beyond disclosure either by periodic reports or by such a modern device for securing responsibility to the electorate as the 'press conference.' But a democracy need not rely on the courts to save it from its own unwisdom. If it is alert-and without alertness by the people there can be no enduring democracy-unwise or unfair legislation can readily be removed from the statute books. It is by such vigilance over its representatives that democracy proves itself." See also, COM MAGER, MAJORITY RULE AND MINORITY RIGHTS CC. 1, 3 (1946). The argument of exclusive reliance upon an alert electorate to cure legislation abridging First Amendment rights is reminiscent of the contention that social legisla- tion would make the individual dependent upon the state rather than his own resources and thus impair his moral fibre. It is difficult to appreciate how the democratic proc- esses are prejudiced by determinations-whether judicial, legislative or otherwise- which strike down restrictions upon the right to vote or freedom of expression. Nor does the assignment of the preservation of democratic rights to an oligarchic institution present a paradox-the memorialization of those rights in a written constitution was for protection against encroachments by popularly elected bodies and it is therefore appro- priate to insure that protection by an institution less vulnerable to the passions and prejudices against minority groups that, at times, sweep the legislatures. Indeed, it would be paradoxical to relegate the protection of First Amendment rights to the ex- clusive jurisdiction of the legislatures when it was the fear of legislative excesses that motivated the adoption of that Amendment. 18.

A member of the Court certainly requires a constitutional philosophy of rea- sonable stability to expedite his consideration of the numerous, difficult cases presented to the Court, but quaere whether it is a source of joy for a Justice to know that his judicial philosophy has assumed the status of a "world" or "universe."19 MURRAY A.
