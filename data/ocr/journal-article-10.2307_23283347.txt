<plain_text><page sequence="1">[RA 57-1963] 21 NECKLACES, BANDS AND BELTS ON MESOPOTAMIAN FIGURINES by George F. DALES Clay figurines and plaques provide one of the potentially richest material sources for the study of ancient Near Eastern dress and bodily ornamentation. The study of such détails has been severely limited in the past because of the lack of a secure chronological and typological framework within which to place the various types and styles of figurines. Recently excavated evidence from stratified contexts is, fortunately, beginning to provide such a framework. It is a study of this new evidence1 that has provided the basis for the present article. Of the various icono graphie détails seen on the figurines, necklaces, chest-bands, and hip-belts or girdles are the most common and are the subject of this study. NECKLACES The earliest représentations of necklaces in Mesopotamia are painted on seated female figurines of the Halaf period, possibly as early as 5000 B. C. (fig. I)2. A necklace, along with chest-bands and a girdle, is also painted on a typical northern Obeid period figurine from Tepe Gawra (fig. 2)3. Southern Obeid period figurines, such as those from Ur4 and Eridu do not display necklaces, but contemporaneous figures from Tall-i-Bakun A in southwestern Iran do5. Female figurines from the Protoliterate period are as yet unknown from Mesopotamia, with the possible exception 1. For a Ph.

The same région provides the only figurines from the Early Dynastie I period2, but they too lack necklaces. The unique painted gypsum plaster relief-plaque from Ashur (fig. 3)3, dated to the Early Dynastie period by the excavator and to the « Jemdet Nasr » period by other scholars on the basis of style4, does depict an elaborate « dog-collar » necklace. Unfortunately, the date of the plaque must remain tenuous as long as the object is Fig. 1 Fig. 2 r Fig. 3 Fig. 4 unique. Strictly on the basis of the technique of manufacture used, I prefer to date it to the Neo-Sumerian period, if not later. It is not until the Early Dynastie III period that we again get clay femâle représentations, and these are in the form of the so-called « goddess » jar-handles from southern Mesopotamia (fig. 4)5. Some of these display elaborate multi-strand necklaces such as those of the same period actually found in the Ur cemetery. Beginning with the Old Akkadian (Sargonid) period, hand-modeled female figurines become more abundant, reaching their height of popularity during the Ur III and Old Babylonian periods. During these periods, necklaces are depicted either by means of incised lines or by applied clay strips. Several of the more dis tinctive types will be discussed here. COLLIER A CONTREPOIDS A spécial, and apparently very sigmficant, type of necklace was identified by Mlle Agnès Spycket in RA several years ago6. She concluded, on evidence from 1.

The necklace continued to be shown on a few Kassite seals, but was more frequent on the Syro-Cappadocian glyptic, especially from Nuzi. From the evidence available at the time, Mlle Spycket noted that this spécial necklace is worn either by high-ranking goddesses — but only in the attitude of intercession and prayer, unless they are holding vases with flowing water — or by mortal women, always with their hands clasped. The question of the original significance of this necklace — whether it was merely a fashionable item of female adornment or whether it had some symbolic or religious value — was left open because of the lack of conclusive evidence. Since Mlle Spycket's pioneering study, a sizable amount of new representational evidence for the collier à contrepoids has come to light. Especially important are the new figurines from Nippur because they provide the longest stratified sequence of such objects from any site in Mesopotamia. With the exception of a few fragmentary Obeid period examples, the earliest female figurines from Nippur come from Old Akkadian period levels. These figurines are unique in style, characterized by their overall simplicity of form and lack of détail1, but especially by their uniform gesture — one hand at the chest, the other held straight down along the side of the body. The collier à contrepoids is clearly indicated on several of these figurines. Fig. 52 is the best preserved example. The beads of the necklace are indicated by two irregular rows of circular marks — made by impressing the end of a hollow tube into the soft clay — and the counterweight as a double line scratched down the backside of the figure. There is one bit of evidence from another site suggesting that this type of necklace was known in Mesopotamia before the Old Akkadian period. A few fragmentary figures from Khafaje, in the Diyala région of Iraq, were reportedly found in a private house level of the Early Dynastie III period. Fig. 63 is the best of these examples. The necklace is represented by an applied strip of clay decorated with vertical incised lines. The counterweight is indicated by single incised lines 1. Previously unrecognized as belonging to this period. Mrs. Van Buren : Clay Figurines of Babylonia and Assyria [1930], n° 55, fig. 19-20, dates them to the 4th millennium B. C. on stylistic grounds.

DALES [RA 57 Fig. 5 Fig. 6 descending from the ends of the applied necklace strip. These Khafaje figurines display exactly the same gesture that is so characteristic of the Nippur Old Akkadian examples. Together with the unique anthropomorphic jar handle from the « Royal » cemetery at Ur1, they may represent the prototypes for the Old Akkadian style représentations. But final judgement must await the discovery of further examples of Early Dynastie III figurines. The Third Dynasty of Ur and Old Babylonian private house levels at Nippur, plus several locations in and near Ur, have produced great numbers of female figurines2, on some are to be seen the collier à contrepoids. The counterweights are indicated, as earlier, by simple incised lines (fig. 7)3. Quantitatively, the figurines that display the counterweight attached to the necklace are much less numerous than those that merely show the necklace alone. There is no appréciable différence between the stylistic détails of those figurines that do and those that do not show the counterweight. In both cases, the necklace appears to be the only item of bodily adornment with the exception often times of a hip-belt (see below). There are several variant examples of basically the same type of figurine from 1. C. L. Woolley : Ur Excavations. Vol. II : The Royal Cemetery [1934], pl. 187, pp. 161-162, 388. 2. The Nippur figurines from these periods are practically indistinguishable on stylistic grounds. The Ur figures, on the other hand, tend to get flatter, broader, and more ornate in the Isin-Larsa and Old Babylonian periods. This same trend is seen in the Diyala figurines, cf. H.

The enormous necklace consists of incised strips of clay applied to the front of the figure, whereas the counterweight is more simply represented by three incised lines. This figurine is also decorated with bands crossing the chest (see below). Another figurine (fig. 9)2 from Diqdiqqeh, near Ur, is probably from the Ur III Fig. 9 Fig. 10 period. The counterweight is scratched into the back of the figure rather carelessly, considering the care with which the rest of the object was made.

DALES [RA 57 other respect they are identical with the common figurines of the period cited above from Nippur and Ur, but instead of holding both hands at their breasts they hold a disk-shaped object in front of their chest. These disks have been described variously as tambourines, drums, rattles, cakes, platters for receiving ofïerings, or as offerings themselves. Comparative study confirms, however, that the Ur III figurines of this type are the earliest examples of a type of female représentation that becomes popular throughout most of the Near East — especially in Mesopotamia, Palestine, and Egypt — and survives into Glassical times in the Aegean and in the Eastern colonies. There can no longer be serious doubt that these represent either secular entertainers or devotees participating in some sort of a cuit ritual in which the tambourine plays an important part. Just as with the Ur Ill-Old Babylonian figurines cited above, there is no visual différence between those tambourine player figurines that show the collier à contrepoids and those that do not. Three low-relief plaques — one of stone, two of clay — show a suppliant goddess in profile wearing the collier à contrepoids1. The gypsum stone relief from Mari — mistakenly called a « goddess smelling a flower » — has appeared frequently in publications2. The goddesses on the two clay plaques are identical to the one on the Mari stone plaque except they face to the right instead of to the left (and they show no traces of a « flower »). The one clay plaque in the British Muséum, published by Wiseman3, shows only the goddess. The second one, also from Ur and in the University Muséum (fig. Il)4 shows the same goddess standing behind the so-called « god with mace » — a common scene on Old Babylonian cylinder seals5. A unique hand-modeled clay figurine in the Oriental Institute (Chicago) (fig. 12)6, reportedly from Ishchali in the Diyala région of Iraq, also shows our spécial necklace. The date of the object is unknown. Formai excavations at this site never penetrated below the end of the Ur III levels, although earlier material has been found at the site. The necklace on this figure is indicated by three rows of incised dots. The incised lines representing the counterweight meet the ends of the lowest row of the necklace, conforming with the distinctive design of the necklace as reconstructed by Mlle Spycket. 1.

The closest stylistic connections are with figurines found throughout an east-west band running from the Mediterranean across northern Syria, southern Anatolia, northern Iran, Turkmé nistan (fig. 14)1, and into northern Pakistan and India (fig. 152 and fig. 16)3.

The most recent and unexpected appearances of the collier à contrepoids are on a magnifîcant gold vessel from the recent excavations of the University Muséum, Philadelphia, at Hasanlu in northwestern Iran1. It was found in the ruins of the 9th century B. C. Mannaean citadel destroyed either by invading Urartian or Assyrian Fig. 17 Fig. 18 soldiers. Miss Porada suggests a date of between 1100 and 900 B. C. for the manufacturing of the vessel. This is based on a comparison of the hammered relief figures and décorations on the vessel with similar représentations in other média from sites in Iran, Iraq, and North Syria. The sources for the iconographie détails on the vessel are numerous and varied, including elements from the Mesopotamian Old Akkadian period and especially from North Syrian art of the late second and early first millennia B. G. The collier à contrepoids is seen twice on the Hasanlu gold vessel. In both instances, the représentations are unique in comparison with the other known occurrences of the necklace. In the first instance (fig. 17) a « goddess » is shown standing on two rams, holding open her chevron-patterned mantle to expose her nudity in a manner well known from Syrian cylinder seals of the second millennium B. G. She wears a necklace with three pendent crescents and a long counterweight. Little détail is shown but the counterweight defmitely terminâtes in a large knob.

DALES [RA 57 kneeling or squatting female who is presenting a nude child to a seated maie figure. Although the necklace itself is not shown, the counterweight is clearly depicted. The significance of this scene is not clear, but it is tempting to consider Miss Porada's suggestion that it is a graphie représentation of an important scene from the Hurro Hittite Kummarbi myth1. Kumarbi, « the Father of the Gods » conceives of a plan to displace Teshub as King of Heaven. He begets a strange son, the stone monster Ullikummi for this purpose. After the birth of the child, « the Fate-goddesses and Mother — goddesses lifted the child and placed him on Kumarbi's knees ». If the scene on the vessel does represent, this mythological episode, the female ofïering the child is a goddess. Indeed, she is identical in appearance — except for the necklace — to another female figure on the gold vessel — that of a goddess seated on a lion and holding a round mirror in one hand2. The Hasanlu gold vessel furnishes the latest known occurrences of this spécial necklace. The Iranian artisans may have been merely copying Mesopotamian art motifs that they no longer understood3. But, the fact that the necklace appears twice on the vessel suggests that at the time and place where the Hasanlu object was made the collier à contrepoids still retained some of its original significance. In spite of the abundant new representational evidence for this spécial necklace, we are no further along in explaining its purpose and significance than was Mlle Spycket in her original study. Its occurrences are strangely inconsistent. Why otherwise identical figurines and statuettes sometimes wear the counterweight and sometimes not is certainly not merely because of an oversight on the part of the artisan. The spécial purpose for which goddesses and mortal women wore this ornament must have been of great importance. The new evidence enhances its importance by expanding the time and geographical area in which it was known and used in the ancient Near East. It can only be hoped that new textual evidence will be fortheo ming that will explain the function of this spécial necklace. As a start in this direction, it would be especially valuable to know the ancient name for this necklace. Numerous types of necklaces are mentioned in Sumerian and Akkadian texts, especially in the inventory lists. Because of the utter lack of descriptive détail, it is difficult — if not impossible — to connect any of these 1. For translations see A. Goetze in Ancient Near Eastern Texls [1950], pp. 120 ff. ; H. Guterbock in Mytho logies of the Ancient World (ed. by S. N. Kramer, New York, 1961), pp. 155 fT. 2. She is closely related to the type of Western Asiatic goddess represented by Kubaba, the protective goddess of Carchemish who is depicted in similar fashion. See e. g. M. Vieyra : Hittite Art [1955], pl. 51 and 65. 3.

However, a few suggestions can be proposed. Akkadian guhassu (variants guhassu, guhalsu) written ideographically gû.has, suggesting a Sumerian interprétation « necklace »x, occurs in various contexts from Old Babylonian times onward. Guhassu is found as a braided wire or torque for suspending jewelry, as a wire cable used in connection with drawing water from wells, as a spécial type of garment2, as a kind of colored thread or braid, or as part of a chariot. These contexts ail suggest the idea of a cord, chain, or cable which fits quite well the description of the necklace counterweight. Text YOS 6, 53 : 6 lists gold for the manufacture of pi-in-gu mes ù gu-hal-si sa taskis hurâsi, « knobs and wires for the pendants (?) of gold ». YOS 6, 216 : 11 gives this description of a necklace : 118 kursû hurâsi ina 2 pingû ina gu-hal-sa hurâsi sabil ; « 118 links of gold held by two knobs (and) a wire of gold ». The two passages are especially important because they associate the words guhassu and pinglqu. Bottéro3 suggests that this second word refers to the clasp (of pierced stone) that forms the top of the long counterweight. 4 (aban) kunukki uqnêm sa pi-in-qi-im sa wa-ar-ka-lim ; « 4 cylindres en lazulite d'un « fermoir » de derrière ». E. Reiner4 discusses a text containing panâqu (panâgu), for which the Sumerian version gives [...].tag, meaning « to provide with a knob (pingu) ». Guhassu is also associated with another word ganandu (ganaddu) — probably Kassite — of uncertain meaning. 1 guhassu hurâsi ga-na-ad-du na4.za.gîn, « one necklace of gold with a ganaddu of lapis lazuli ». This could possibly refer to the weight at the bottom end of the long counterweight cord. OTHER NECKLACES AND PENDENTS Numerous other types of necklaces and ornaments are known from textual references, but as stated above, the descriptions are never detailed enough to enable a positive identification of the names with actual représentations of such items on figurines, statuary, etc. Consider, for example, the story of Ishtar's (Inanna's) 1. For référencés see Chicago Assyrian Dictionary (abbreviated CAD), G-Volume ; also W. F. Leemans : Ishlar of Lagaba and Her Dress (Leiden, 1952), 10-11.

In the Semitic version1, the na4m'mmâ/jmeS sa kisâdi-sd was removed from the goddess as she passed through the third gâte. Speiser and Heidel translate this « the chains round her neck ». This does not, however, fall within the range of the définitions for this word obtained from other sources2. There are several lexicographical variants, but the basic correspondence between Akkadian erimmatu and Sumerian na4NUNUZ is well established. The words designate either egg-shaped beads or a necklace made of such bead. The translation « chains » is better reserved for such words as ad-tab (see below). There is a divergence between the Sumerian and Akkadian versions of this myth as to the spécifié items removed from the body of the goddess as she passed through each gâte. In the Sumerian version3, it is at the fourth gâte that the « twin NUNUZ-stones of her breast » were removed. These egg-shaped stones could have been suspended by a necklace or cord to form one of the various types of necklaces seen especially on the figurines. Both versions of the Inanna/Ishtar Descent to the Netherworld list the d/tudittu as one of the items removed from the goddess. This word has a long history4, appearing first in the Old Akkadian period. It was some sort of ornament worn on the breast of females, both goddesses and mortal women. It was one of the essential pieces of jewelry given to the bride at her wedding. It could be made of silver (in one instance plated with gold), gold, bronze, copper, ivory, or semi-precious stones (e. g. lapis lazuli or serpentine). A late ritual text (Seleucid) from Warka5 lists gifts given to Ishtar by various craftsmen. One of these gifts is a tù-di-it-ti from the nangâru « carpenter ». An ornament of wood is thus implied. In fact, a variant text has s®du-di-it-tu. The weights of d/tudittus are often given in the texts. Indications are that they were usually very light in weight. That the dltudittu had some talismanic powers for warding ofî danger and evil is suggested by several passages6 : e. g. « her (Lamastu's) tudittu is broken, her breast exposed » ; « the curse for rending a (woman's) cloak, breaking (her) ludittu and snipping 1.

They are first seen on female clay figurines of the Obeid period in northern Mesopotamia (fig. 2)2. They are not seen again until the Early Dynastie III period Fig. 21 Fig. 22 Fig. 23 Fig. 24 in southera Mesopotamia on the so-called « Goddess » jar handles (fîg. 21®, 224). Figurines with chest-bands from approximately the same period are also seen in Anatolia (fig. 235, 24)6. The elaborate figurine from Tell Tayinat in northern Syria, discussed above in connection with the collier à contrepoids (fig. 13), also has bands painted on its front and back sides. Chest-bands are represented on Mesopotamian Ur Ill-Old Babylonian period figurines by means of applied clay strips (fig. 8, fig. 257, fig. 26)8, or with paint (fig. 27)9. Similar bands, indicated by rouletted lines, constitute 1. For references see du Mesnil do Buisson : Le sautoir d'Atargatis et la chaîne d'amulettes (Leiden, 1947).

G. (fîg. 28)1. Late Cypriote I (cir. 1500 B. C.) figurines, that can be shown to be late variants of the North Syrian figurines, sometimes show the bands by means of single incised lines (fig. 29)2. To return to Mesopotamia, the next appearance of the chest-bands appears to be on an unpublished « pillar » figurine from the Late Assyrian Level I (cir. 800 600 B. C.) at Tell Billa in northern Iraq3. The most detailed représentations of the bands are seen on the Neo-Babylonian molded figurine plaques from Susa (fig. 30)4 where they often have the appearance of braided cords or wires. Before discussing the wider distribution of this originally Mesopotamian type of feminine adornment, is it possible to identify it by its ancient name ? The problems are the same as those encountered above when dealing with the various types of necklaces, namely, the lack of détail in the textual references. The one term that cornes the closest to the idea of the chest-bands as seen on the figurines is Sumerian 1. C. L. Woolley : Alalakh, p. 248, pl. LIV, g.

DALES [RA 57 Fig. 28 Fig. 29 Fig. 30 ad-tab1. Either with or without the garment determinative tûg, the term often refers to « bridles » made of goat hair2. Leeman's objection to the translation « bridle » when ad-tab is not preceded by the determinitive, is not valid if we consider the word to refer to such chest-bands as seen on the figurines. They could very well have been made of braided gold wire and inlaid with semi-precious stones (ad tab guskin na4GUG za-gîn sè-ga), or made of lapis lazuli beads ("^ad-tab za-gIn). Another occurrence, gû-za ad-tab, does not necessarily have to refer to a necklace as such. The bands or « bridle » as seen on the figurines pass over the shoulders at the base of the neck, which could account for this form of the word. Unfortunately, there is no direct Akkadian équivalent for Sumerian ad-tab, nor are any of the Akkadian terms for female ornaments or garments spécifié enough to enable their identification with the bands on the figurines. The ancient importance of these bands — although incompréhensible to us now — is suggested by their popularity not only in the length of time they were used but in their wide geographical distribution. To the west, there is evidence of their use on Roman statues and paintings3. To the east, the occurrences are far more numerous and of possibly greater significance. It is possible that the Near Eastern chest-bands provided the prototype for an important item of Hindu iconography, the so-called channavïra-garment, seen for example on early Yakshï sculptures of 1.

Links between these two areas may be provided partly by the clay figurines of northern West Pakistan (fig. 15 and 16)2, and by the exquisite blue schist figurine of the Scytho-Parthian period from Sirkap (Taxila) (fig. 31 )3. The probability of the spread of this type of garment from the Near East to South Asia is enhanced by the presence in both areas of another garment, closely associated with the chest-bands, namely, the hip-belt (see below). HIP-BELTS AND GIRDLES The earliest appearance of girdles and hip-belts in Mesopotamia is on female figurines of the northern Obeid period (fig. 2). The garment is supported by straps crossing the chest and backside of the figure. The unique stone relief plaque from thé Ishtar Temple at Ashur (fig. 3) clearly shows a similar garment around the hips. But it is with the appearance of the Neo-Sumerian period that the hip-belt is seen so frequently on clay figurines (fig. 32)4. On the Nippur and Ur figures, these belts pig 3-2 b ig 33 Fig m i Fig. 31 Fig. 32 Fig. 33 1 Fig. 34 are depicted by incised lines. Just as was ihe case with the necklaces where the counterweight was not consistently shown, so with the hip-belts. They may or may not be represented on figurines that are otherwise identical.

DALES [RA 57 figurines from Tell Asmar in the Diyala région (fig. 33)1 also depict hip-belts with simple incised lines. The elaborate Larsa period figure from the same site (fig. 34)2 also seems to show the hip-belt. They appear regularly — depicted by rouletted lines — on the North Syrian figures discussed above in connection with chest-bands (fig- 28). Closely related to these North Syrian figurines are the contemporaneous Egvptian Middle Kingdom figurines found in Egypt and Cyprus (fig. 35)3. Especially © ©, V iOO/ J Fig. 35 Fig. 36 significani is the presence of the hip-belts and the « dimples » above each buttocks4 on the figurines from both areas. It is especially interesting to note that the hip belt was apparently unknown in Egypt before the Middle Kingdom. The evidence suggests that the belt was introduced into Egypt as a resuit of contacts with Mesopo tamia (in the broadest sense) during the Middle Kingdom. It then continued in popular use by female entertainers and attendants at least through the New Kingdom5. As for the ancient name of these hip-belts, two suggestions may be ofïered. In Ishtar's Descent, the fifth garment removed from the goddess is the aban alâdi 1. H. Frankfort : The Gimilsin Temple, p. 207, fig. 109, b. Now Oriental Institute, A 8342. 2.

There does not appear to be a direct équivalent for this in the Sumerian version. Even more probable, however, is Akkadian dïdù1. It is worn by female démons, goddesses, and mortal women alike. Removal of this particular garment apparently unclothed the female body completely. That the dïdû was sometimes fastened around the body by tying is suggested by its association with the verb ramû, « to untie, loosen, unbind ». A figurine of uncertain date from Qatna, Syria (fig. 36)2 shows clearly a band tied around the hips. More significant is the association of dïdû with the verb batâqu « to snip, eut ofï »3, that suggests a garment such as a cloth band or a string that could be easily eut through. The fact that the word dïdû occurs only in the dual and plural forms may be explained as a resuit of the same Mesopotamian psychology that produced dual forms for the names of garments such as trousers and coats that were worn over dual parts of the body.

A visible link may be provided by the northern West Pakistan figurines (fig. 15 and 16) which clearly show such belts in connection with the channavïra-type chest-bands. Also, certain of the Indus Valley (Harappan) civilization figurines (cir. 2500-1500 B. C.) display the hip-belt (fig. 37)1. A somewhat later form of South Asian figurine (fig. 38)2 also displays the hip-belt, without chest-bands or necklaces. The blue schist figurine from Sirkap mentioned above (under chest-bands, fig. 31) shows a similar hip-belt but here it appears to encircle both thighs. One of the important types of hip-belts or girdles in Indian art is called the mekhala3. The Atharva Veda4 (6, 133) states that it was a long-life charm. It is frequently seen in connection with the channavïra to which it is sometimes attached5. It would be presumptuous to insist upon a Near Eastern genesis for elements of something as far removed as Hindu iconography, but at the same time, present evidence does place the earliest appearance of certain of these elements in the Near East — especially on the Mesopotamian clay figurines. 1.
