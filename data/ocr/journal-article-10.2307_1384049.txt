<plain_text><page sequence="1">THREE FACES OF THE TRUE BELIEVER Motivations for Attending a Fundamentalist Church* ROBERT R. MONAGHAN Department of Speech Ohio State University The minister and members of a conservative church were admin- istered Q-sorts consisting of 56 items assessing religious orientation. These items were derived from interviews with members of the con- gregation. Factor analysis provided three distinct orientations, or hypothetical types of persons. The authority-seeker wants the minister to "lay it on the line" and tell the congregation what it should and should not do. He wants bold and forcible criticism as well as strong guidance. The comfort-seeker is afraid of death and Hell, illness and old age, and the church helps him reduce his fears. It gives him peace of mind by its assurance of eternal life. The social participator enjoys the friendly social interaction and an opportunity to talk with others about matters of mutual interest. The church is a kind of social "home", where he can enjoy human companionship. WHY does a person attend church ? What are his needs or motives ? What aspirations and gratifications does he associate with church membership ? Are such functions the same for all persons, or are there characteristic differences among individuals or types of individuals ? This study proposes to answer some of these questions in relation to individ- uals within a theologically conservative church-an institution which might, by its very insistence on a clearcut, un- ambiguous, "fundamental" religion, be * Special appreciation is expressed for the help and criticism provided by Mr. Thomas Danbury of Foote, Cone and Belding in New- York, by Professor Malcolm MacLean, Jr., of the University of Iowa, and by Professor Iwao Ishino of the Sociology and Anthropology De- partment at Michigan State University. expected not only to elicit fairly well- defined attitudes, but also to satisfy relatively strong needs in its members. ORIENTATION Representatives of a regional council of churches were asked to identify a theologically conservative church in the area for the pur- poses of this study. The council officials de- scribed the selected church as being large, ac- tive, significant in the community, and as having strong fundamentalist or supernatural leanings. "Fundamentalism" was defined by two criteria: adherence to an anthropomorphic concept of God and to a literal interpretation of the Bible. All persons interviewed held both concepts. The minister of the church was born into a laboring class, fundamentalist home in Georgia forty years ago, and at eighteen married a local girl. He has a long history of church activities,</page><page sequence="2">THREE FACES OF THE TRUE BELIEVER 237 largely due to the influence of his mother. Neither he nor the church is formally affiliated with any denomination or convention, although an informal relationship exists with the South- ern Baptist Church. He has held his present position for fourteen years. The church is located at the outer edge of a midwestern industrial metropolis. The interior is spacious, light, and full of color, with stained windows and an enormous picture of Christ on the wall behind the altar. The basic design of the four-year-old building incorporates the traditional steeple style with the modern slanted roof architecture. The large sanctuary easily accommodates the 900 or more regular worshippers who meet each Sunday for the main service. The minister (perhaps cautiously) estimated that 45 to 50 per cent of his congregation was from small southern communities. Most of the persons interviewed considered them- selves Southerners, in some way identified with small community living below the Mason-Dixon line, or at least expressed favorable feelings toward the South. Apparently, there are no Negro members of the church. The church originated in 1934 when a small group of persons began worshipping together without a regular church edifice. Soon the small congregation arranged to meet in a local community hall, and still later, in one of the buildings of a nearby elementary school. The church is located approximately three city blocks from the community school, which was annexed to the city school system two years previous to this study at the time the community itself was annexed. One of the local elementary school teachers estimated that about half of her pupils were in some way affiliated with the church. The teachers report that parents still tend to consider the school as "their" school, rather than as part of the city. The surrounding community might be de- scribed as somewhat ethnocentric. An expe- rienced teacher from the local school, who had taught in other systems and other states, de- scribed the community as "tight-knit." Other teachers supported this observation. An in- formal estimate of socioeconomic status (based on education, estimated income, and observa- tion of general living conditions) might place the members of this church in the "lower-than- middle" class. None of the respondents had gone beyond high school. One-half were not high school graduates. Some had left school before high school. In the pulpit the minister has the capacity for great exhuberance, dynamism, and activ- ity, and there are frequent audible responses from the congregation during his sermons. Members punctuate his points in partial unison with "hallelujah," "amen," "yes, suh," etc. Members of the congregation sing in full and enthusiastic participation. There is an "altar call" or "invitation" fol- lowing each formal service, during which the minister remains on the platform, although he may step forward from the pulpit. A response to the "call" may be indicated with nothing more than a quickly raised hand while all per- sons are supposed to be in an attitude of prayer. During the early part of the regular Sunday morning service, the minister builds rapport with the congregation by calling for any visi- tor to stand-in the midst of the entire congre- gation-and identify himself. He welcomes each visitor individually with a friendly comment. There is also a five-minute hand-shaking cere- mony early in the service. The minister steps down from the platform for this ritual, while all members of the congregation shake hands and greet each other. The church buys time for a weekly Sunday morning radio broadcast on a local radio station. In addition to regular services, there are such individually planned events as concerts, evan- gelistic meetings, family suppers, and Sunday school class parties. There is activity in the large church building every evening of the week. Five trustees and five deacons constitute the official decision-making board of the church. The minister reports that "routine" matters, such as salaries (including his own), are deter- mined in the semi-private board meetings because " . . . the board members know what can and cannot be done." "Major" matters, such as the choice of color when painting the sanctuary, are presented to the congregation for vote, after being discussed by the board.</page><page sequence="3">238 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION When the board presents a matter to the con- gregation, it is likely to be, in the minister's words, "for their approval." Congregational voting is by acclamation, and it is necessary for a disapproving voter to rise before the entire congregation and state the reasons for his objection. Although the minister is an ex officio member of the board, he seems to have a vote in case of a tie, and has a great deal of personal influence generally. He decides, for example, who is qualified and who is not quali- fied to serve on the board. Although the church is not officially affiliated with other organizations, it does support some foreign missions. However, it is clearly a locally autonomous system. METHOD After the church was tentatively se- lected, the minister agreed to endorse the interviewer and to recommend him to members of his congregation. In an extended interview the minister sup- plied information about the organiza- tion of the church, details of the belief structure, and his perceptions of mem- bers' motives in attending. He also, in effect, became the first respondent, an- swering questions of attitude regarding the church, the minister, explanations of morality, free vs. limited interpreta- tions of the Bible, the church as a social change organization, definitions of God, self-concepts, feelings about authority, enjoyment during church services, leisure time use patterns, mass media use, reading habits, and other topics. All respondents were questioned according to a memorized interview guide. The usual demographic information was also obtained. Respondents were selected from church records by a stratified-quota system that provided equal proportions of males and females, of two age groups (20-39 and 40-65), and of three categories of participation (officers, regular attenders, and non-attenders). This provided 2 x 2 x 3 = 12 combinations. Focused interviews (Merton 1956) of at least one hour were conducted with one set of twelve respondents. From the tape recordings of these interviews statements were developed which pro- vided a fifty-six item Q-sort. These were administered to the minister and twenty- six other persons matching the sample design. Respondents were asked to sort the statements along an 11-point scale (with a fixed near-normal distri- bution), according to how well the items described their own feelings about the church. Comments about the items were then invited. These data were then analyzed by the Q-method. (Stephenson 1953). The rank scores for each respondent were correlated with the rankings of every other by the Pearson product-moment formula. The intercorrelation matrix' was then factored using a principal axis factor analytic program with varimax rotation. This procedure generates a number of multi- factor solutions. The solution containing the largest number of significant factors accounting for the greatest amount of variance constituted the selection cri- teria. For each factor the estimated fac- tor array was computed. That is, the responses for each subject were as- signed weights proportional to his corre- lation with the factor. The more closely a respondent's scores resembled the fac- tor, the more weight was given to his rank order in computing the array for that factor. The totals of all such weights for every person on a factor were then converted to standard Z-scores. The full rank-order of items emerging in this way, then, is called a factor array. Since an array represents a systematic com- posite, or "typical" order, from those subjects having responses which identified I This has been deposited with the American Documentation Institute.

RESULTS Three such factors emerged, as re- ported in Table I. Each factor repre- sents a specific and distinct array, re- presenting a hypothetical type of person who may be described by the items most weighted on that factor. The items suggest these labels for the three types: the authority-seeker, the comfort-seeker, and the social participator. The Authority-Seeker The first factor represents the kind of person who seeks to submit himself to authority. It does not imply a loss of self-direction simply by default, but rather, a strong and consistent desire for a submissive relation toward au- thority. This orientation is so basic that its implications are seen to touch the central belief system, the training of children, the interpretation of the Bible. The authority-seeker wants his authority boldly imposed, even to in- clude criticism. See the wording of the first item in Table I-a statement which distinguishes the authority-seeker most sharply from the other types, particularly from the comfort-seeker. The authority-seekers do not want the minister to be more outspoken. Appar- ently he is outspoken enough for them. This type of person likes the minister because he has authority. He prefers to depend upon the authority of the minister for an interpretation of the Bible, rather than interpret it for himself. He is not eager to open up religious ques- tions for discussion. (Some of these re- spondents were reluctant to set appoint- ments for an interview, and were very difficult to interview.) He prefers a one- way, direct line of communication from the pulpit. During the depth interviews each respondent was given a hypothetical and contrived case of conflict between his own personal interpretation of the Bible and the minister's, a kind of verbal forced-choice. Typically, as the author- ity-seeker was painted into a corner in this way, the most satisfactory solution for him seemed to be something like: Well, there is only one correct meaning of the Bible: God's Word. The minister is edu- cated, and of course he knows more about these things than I do. Frequent comments indicated that the minister provides meaning for church members where none existed before. Throughout all the interviews his au- thority regarding such matters was never questioned, except by the interviewer. As might be expected, a person whose predominant orientation toward the church is authority-based is also au- thoritarian in non-theological matters, such as his domestic and personal affairs, particularly the rearing of children. See the third item of Table I. Some au- thority-seekers related this statement to patriotism. Others accepted the state- ment because they wanted children to learn to get along socially through church training. The authority-seeker associates church attendance with harmony in the home. One young married person in this type said, "A family that goes to a Bible church, and lives like the first family- Adam and Eve-will not be split." An- other said that family church attendance helped family members to "think alike" and made them "more understanding." Some mentioned the slogan: "The family that prays together, stays together." One respondent said he could tell from working in a gas station that church- going families were happier. This type of church-goer also considers the church as the best possible place for a young person to meet friends, and specifically, to meet a future mate. He considers others in the church-the min- ister, the deacons, and other members- as friendly and gregarious, and feels</page><page sequence="5">240 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION these persons are genuinely interested in him. The church services provide him with an inner peace that contrasts with per- sonal troubles. He endorses the fol- lowing statement even slightly more than the comfort-seeker: I feel peaceful being in the church building during a service. Whatever troubles I might have, they seem to slip away while I am there. One woman commented that her hus- band had a terrible temper, and both he and the children were very demanding. The church service provided her with one hour during which she could escape them and the rest of her usual world. She said the church service " . . . helps me forget a lot of my troubles. I'm calmer. I don't worry too much. It's about the only time I get to relax." Nationalism is another recurring theme for the authority-seeker. Although it would be difficult to discern which cause serves which, there is little separation be- tween church and state in his context. Again, submission and obedience to authority seem to; characterize this type: This church helps mold persons into the kind of God-fearing people who are the backbone of our country. One woman who placed this item on the extremely favorable end of the distribu- tion explained, "The best people in the country have faith in God, and the church tells people to obey God." This type of person strongly rejects a statement emphasizing the reality and fear of Hell. The authority-seekers seem to somehow avoid this concern, while both of the other types, particularly the comfort-seeker, most clearly express wor- ry and fear. The authority-seeker is apparently non- chalant about death. While both of the other types clearly indicate that death and damnation are major concerns, the authority-seeker does not. This was further substantiated by the open-ended interviews. One said: I am not scared of death. If she happens tomorrow, or next week, or next year, or in the next five minutes, I don't care. I'm not scared of it. Too many people are, and that's the damn trouble. They're scared of it. The Comfort-Seeker In sharp contrast is the comfort-seeker, who expresses satisfaction that the church provides the way to eternal life, the at- tainment of which he believes is every- one's primary goal. He seeks peace of mind. His orientation appears consis- tent with the need for peace, identified as a strong factor by Webb (1965). Per- sons represented on this second factor were most inclined to assume that every- one is justifiably afraid of death, par- ticularly those who have no church- affiliation "insurance" against the fright- ening possibility of going to Hell. Reli- gion, which they see as being the simple and readily available way to Heaven, provides them with reassurance. The two highest factor items for the com- fort-seeker reflect this strong orientation. The second statement, suggesting fears of Hell, may help explain why the com- fort-seeker does not question the sincerity of those who respond to "altar call" at the end of the service. He is persuaded that other members really believe in the rules and practices of the church. He is fully convinced that persons who walk forward to "accept Christ" at the end of the service are sincere in their actions. This may be somewhat reminiscent of Allport's (1951) notion of the extrinsic- oriented member. If so, the notion has support here, in addition to the sup- porting evidence and elaboration provided by Brown (1964). The comfort-seeker apparently feels a strong need to protect his belief. He believes that his own particular church is on the right track and offers insurance</page><page sequence="6">THREE FACES OF THE TRUE BELIEVER 241 against the persuasions of any new be- lief to which he might be exposed. He strongly supports the concept that the church helps him know the Bible so he can protect himself from others who may try to persuade him toward some other belief. He wants those around him to hold the same beliefs he does. Thus while the two other types reject the idea of religious indoctrination as a prerequi- site to church membership the comfort- seeker believes that all persons should go through the same training and study of the Scriptures in order to become members. He also thinks that the church is a good place for young people to meet friends and begin courtship, although he expresses this view less strongly than the authority-seeker. Stronger than that of the other types is the comfort-seeker's expressed desire for intimate, personal relationships. He would prefer the church to be smaller, more intimate, so he could see more familiar faces. Although he does not consider the church hostile, neither does he find it as friendly as he would like. He does not endorse the statement that both the authority-seeker and the par- ticipator agree to: "The minister, the deacons, and just about everyone in this church is friendly to me . . . " Although the comfort-seeker's specific motivation to belong to the church is important to him, his interest in the church as a whole is more limited, less varied than that of the others. He em- braces the church less fully than they do. He is less inclined to feel that church attendance is important or beneficial to family relations than the other two types. He does not feel that his life would become dull or less interesting if he failed to participate in church activi- ties. He may feel that the church is letting him down. It is at least reasonable to infer that he seeks greater satisfaction from the church than he is now getting. While his major orientation seems to be characterized by a need for peace of mind he only mildly accepts the statement about feeling peaceful in the church building during a service. This further suggests that he is in search of long-range or permanent security rath- er than temporary reduction of anxiety. The church service itself does not appear to be highly important to him. He does not reject the notion that a person can be "saved" outside the church, while both of the other types clearly agree that church membership, or attendance, is essential for a person to "accept Christ." It is not surprising that a person ap- parently in search of tranquility is not as receptive to blunt and direct criticism as are those in the other two groups. The authority-seeker is most extreme in his receptiveness to criticism from the pulpit, and the participator very clearly approves of such criticism. This does not fit the pattern or scheme of things for the comfort-seeker, however, whose predominant desires are for peace. A strong and consistent preference for entertainment, particularly music, may be seen as compatible with this orientation. This type of person seeks his own kind of peace and tranquility in the church, and approves of the church services and activities as long as they provide for this need. In some areas he feels the church is failing, or at least is not essential. It is possible that some of the solace he seeks may be found elsewhere, outside the church. However, his strongest need- insurance against damnation- is still the specialty of the church, and is not readily available from any other source. Consequently, he has little choice. In order to get his first-class ticket to Heav- en, he must listen to criticism, and must tolerate the other features of the church which do not appeal to him. But this does not mean that he must then sup- port the church in general, or embrace the entire system. It is more likely that he takes what he needs and avoids the rest as best he can.</page><page sequence="7">242 THREE FACES OF THE TRUE BELIEVER The Social Participator This type of person likes the church for "its own sake," finding satisfaction in participation as an end in itself. The person in search of peace of mind finds his satisfaction in the comfort and efficacy of religious teachings which show him the way to Heaven. The person in search of authority finds his in the clarity and decisiveness with which the church lays down guidelines for his religious, social and political attitudes and actions. The participator, however, enjoys the church intrinsically. His experiences in the church rest upon a wider base than those of the other two types. Perhaps he is best portrayed by the breadth of his rela- tionships with the church. The participator feels at home in the church. There is something friendly and predictable about its people. He feels a strong personal rapport with the min- ister and has great trust in him. See, in Table I, his two highest ranking state- ments. The second statement suggests resistance to change as well as loyalty to the church. He likes conformity for others and he likes to conform himself. He does not feel, however, that new mem- bers should be required to undergo indoc- trination of any kind. This type of person enjoys the drama of the church. He likes a lively, dynamic sermon. He enjoys the minister because "His voice is powerful, his gestures are dramatic, and he delivers a fast-paced message." He particularly enjoys such special ceremonies as Baptism and The Lord's Supper. He considers these very impressive, moving and vivid. He pre- fers hearing the Bible interpreted orally to reading it himself. The participator sees himself as a leader, and feels that the church provides him with an opportunity to use his tal- ents through participation in Sunday School teaching, visitation, and other activities. He also feels it is his religious obligation to serve the church. One of his high ranking statements expresses the view that God wants him to serve in the church. Another asserts the honor of being an officer. He also sanctions the notion that an established member may lead others who have been Christians for a shorter time, those who may seek help. The participator likes a sense of in- volvement with others. He very strongly rejects the idea that one should keep his religious beliefs to himself, preferring instead discussion of religious issues with others. This may represent a desire for social, rather than strictly intellectual or theological, interaction, since the participator expresses a desire for activ- ities involving him in human relation- ships, but indicates that he does not want the minister to discuss religious matters more deeply. This is similar to Brown's (1966) religious belief factor which strongly relates to social variables within a religious context. The social participation factor suggests more "so- cial" than "religious" emphasis. Most of these participators have limited their social relationships entirely to per- sons within the church. In some cases they systematically and deliberately avoid social contacts outside the church. To the extent that this is the case, it is as- sumed that social contacts within the church would become all the more mean- ingful and important. One person highly represented on this factor works at his job in close, intimate contact with a small crew. All the others on the crew (non-members of his church) eat lunch together while he goes off by himself each day and eats alone "because they are not Christians." Social relations within the church are most important for the participator. More strongly than the other two types, he supports the statement: It does me good to get out of the house and participate in activities of this church. My life would be rather uninteresting and dull without it. Other statements suggest that this church member type would like to participate even more than he does.</page><page sequence="8">THREE FACES OF THE TRUE BELIEVER 243 TABLE I ITEMS MOST DISCRIMINATING THREE TYPES Z Scores Items most accepted and rejected by authority-seeker I like the minister because he is not afraid to criticize the congrega- 2.24 .05 1.21 tion. He is not afraid to lay it on the line and tell you what you should and should not do. I like the minister because he has a wonderful talent for interpreta- 1.98 0.57 1.02 ting the Bible. He can make the Bible much clearer for me, much bet- ter than I can by reading it alone. I like the training this church gives to children because they, more 1.69 .59 .17 than anyone, need to learn God's word. I feel peaceful being in the church building during a service. What- 1.57 .12 1.22 ever troubles I might have, they seem to slip away while I am there. This church helps mold persons into the kind of God-fearing people 1.32 1.22 .95 who are the backbone of our country. By attending Sunday school classes at this church, children gain the 1.25 .43 -.58 experience of playing and working in a group. The minister, the deacons, and just about everyone in this church is 1.23 .08 1.06 friendly to me. They smile, say hello, shake my hand, and show a genuine interest in me. I think a family is much more likely to live in peace if they attend 1.17 -.33 1.01 this church together. Young people who attend this church can meet friends. I think it is 1.10 .96 .74 the best place to take a date, and the best place to find your future mate. I like the minister because he has authority. When he takes over, .81 .26 .09 things will be done. I think this church is bound by rules and practices that nobody really -1.88 -1.64 -1.40 believes in. This church permits too many of its members to behave in a way -1.77 -1.13 -1.51 that dishonors God. I am in favor of asking these people to leave the church if they will not change. The minister needs to be more outspoken in his sermons. Too often -1.61 -1.22 -.65 he just straddles the fence when he should be scolding the congrega- tion. The church helps me to recognize those people who try to distract a -1.55 -.25 -.80 Christian from practicing God's word. Such people are sinful and should be punished.</page><page sequence="9">244 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION This church should be more friendly. There are too many cliques, and -1.44 -.12 -1.11 to many insincere people. I think the importance of this church is over-rated. I feel that some -1.19 -.35 -1.15 people can accept Christ without joining, or attending the church. They might be able to do as much for Him outside the church as in- side it. Items most accepted and rejected by comfort-seeker When a person is ill, or when he approaches the end of his life, I think .70 1.91 .86 he gets a lot of comfort from his religious beliefs and his friends at this church. To me Hell is real and its tortures are awaiting those who ignore God's -1.11 1.71 1.51 commandments. The church helps me avoid this fate. The only thing our church needs is the Bible. Its doctrines are simple -.33 1.63 .76 and definite and any person can understand them. I would prefer this church to be smaller, more intimate, so you could -.44 1.46 -.77 know everybody. Congregational singing is a wonderful part of the services. .30 1.45 -.38 This church helps me to know the Bible so that I can protect myself -.48 1.23 1.03 from anyone who tries to persuade me to accept their beliefs. I appreciate the special musical numbers at the services. .43 1.20 -.21 I like to sit quietly before each service and listen to the organ. .76 .96 -.38 If a man believes what most of the members of this church believe, he .42 .90 -.16 can not be far from wrong. I think some people in this church who walk forward to accept Christ -1.38 -2.20 -1.40 at the end of thc service are just showing off. The minister is often too emotional. I prefer a more calm and quiet -1.03 -1.92 -1.56 service. Sometimes I think this church has too much flashy entertainment at -1.28 -1.57 -1.03 its services. Many of my friends do not go to this church and I sometimes feel un- -.70 -1.57 -.03 comfortable with them. It is not that I am embarrassed at being a church-goer, but I somehow feel different. I am a Christian, and I want to do the right thing, but I sometimes -.58 -1.33 -1.12 think this church puts too many restriction on members. It does me good to get out of the house and participate in activities of -.27 -1.12 .29 this church. My life would be rather uninteresting and dull without it. By being close to other members during the worship service, I feel -.74 -1.00 -.34 much closer to God. By striving to be a good member of this church yourself, you are able .05 -.52 .24 to lead other people who have been Christians for a shorter time. They often turn to you for help. I know that God wants me to serve Him in this church. If I neglect- -.08 -.51 1.15 ed my duties, I could never feel comfortable. Items most accepted and rejected by social participator I feel free to talk to the minister in private and receive his guidance 1.37 -.41 1.65 at any time. It is nice to know there is someone with whom you can discuss confidential matters.</page><page sequence="10">THREE FACES OF THE TRUE BELIEVER 245 I feel very much at home in this church. It continues to serve God and .12 -.01 61.5 His people in the sure, unchanging way. In his sermons and Bible studies the pastor shares with us his won- 1.39 1.42 1.51 derful knowledge of the scriptures and theology. I really want to know more about these things. The minister does an excellent job of keeping my attention during the .58 .86 1.34 sermon. His voice is powerful, his gestures are dramatic, and he de- livers a fast-paced message. This church provides an opportunity to use whatever talents we might .51 .51 1.15 have for a good cause. There is usually a need for more people to par- ticipate in Sunday School teaching, visitation, or some other activity. I know that God wants me to serve Him in this church. If I neglect- -.08 -.51 1.15 ed my duties, I could never feel comfortable. I particularly enjoy the church's special services. The ceremony of .28 .34 1.08 Baptism, and the observance of the Lord's Supper, are very impres- sive, moving, and vivid. If I were to be an officer in this church, I would consider it one of the -.02 -.03 .79 highest honors I could receive. I prefer to keep my religious beliefs to myself rather than to discuss .05 -1.22 -1.75 them with others in this church. Discussion often ends up in argu- ments, and it is senseless. It seems to me the more you attend this church the more other mem- -.86 -.67 -1.46 bers try to put pressure on you. This church makes it difficult to have my own individual interpreta- -.92 -1.38 -1.39 tions of the Bible. After all, we all see things differently and no single interpretation is "true," so we should respect each other's beliefs. There is too much conformity in this church. I try to rely on my own -.66 - 84 -1.39 judgement, instead of being influenced by what others think. What might be wrong for me, might not be wrong for someone else. All the members of this church should go through the same training -.87 .80 -1.16 and study of the Scriptures in order to become members. Frankly, I sometimes wish our minister would discuss religious mat- -.58 -.51 -1.07 ters more deeply. I think the doctrines of this church are too simple to be meaningful.
