DOI: 10.101 7/S0075 4269 1 00005 83 Analyses of material culture have been central to the creation of Aegean Bronze Age narratives. However, until recently these have tended to focus on chronological typologies rather than on the use of material objects in the creation of social worlds. Amongst the most enigmatic class of Aegean Bronze Age material culture is the rhyton, or so-called libation vase. These vessels have a long history of use, first appearing in the Early Minoan II tombs of southern Crete (ca. 2500 BC) and surviving until the final phase of the Greek Bronze Age in Late Minoan/Helladic HIC (ca. 12th century BC); moreover their use extends through the ancient Aegean, spreading from Minoan Crete to the Greek mainland and the Cycladic islands in Late Helladic/Cycladic I, and even being exported to Egypt and the Near East during the Palatial period (ill. 1). These rhyta were most commonly manufactured from clay, but luxurious variants are known in precious metals (gold, silver, electrum), stone and ivory. Various forms were common: zoomorphic and rare anthropomorphic vessels occurring alongside piriform, conical vases and adapted cups, jugs and other forms. It is typically assumed that the rhyta were used to pour liquid libations in funerary and religious ceremonies; the word rhyton derives from pelv (to pour). Koehl's exhaustive study of the rhyta of the Aegean Bronze Age comprises four main sections: a typology, a catalogue, a discussion of their function and a detailed chronological discussion of their context and use. Koehl identifies four main types of rhyton base on the size of the secondary aperture: Type I with a narrow secondary opening and foot; Type II with narrow secondary opening and no foot; Type III with a wide opening and no foot; and Type IV with a wide opening and foot. These categories cut across the various types of form (anthropo- morphic, conical, etc). As Koehl notes, it is the function of the rhyton that is predicated on the size of the secondary aperture, and whether or not the vessel is freestanding; the form itself does not affect the physicality of use, although the choice of shape might embody certain symbolic connota- tions appropriate to use in specific contexts. The typology first presents material from the Aegean area (the Greek mainland, Crete and the Aegean islands); this is followed by a discussion of 'foreign imitations of Aegean rhyta' found in Egypt and western Asia, including Cyprus. These subdivisions relate to modern scholarship and divisions between Aegean prehistory and Near Eastern archaeology rather than Bronze Age cultural reality; indeed they presuppose a distinct Aegean identity subsuming Minoan, Cycladic and Mycenaean identities. The diverse cultural contexts and cultural realities of the Aegean Bronze Age are not questioned. The catalogue is organized according to the typology developed in chapter 1. There is a brief morphological description; decoration, dimen- sions and preservation are all discussed and usefully the author indicates whether he has personally handled the object. The catalogue also includes the 'foreign' rhyta and representations of rhyta in different media (frescoes, seals and sealings, pottery, Linear A and B texts). The presentation of the data in the typology and subse- quent catalogue is detailed, meticulous and well illustrated in the numerous figures and plates at the back of the volume; however the necessity of moving backwards and forwards between sections is sometimes time-consuming and rather clumsy.</page><page sequence="2">ART AND ARCHAEOLOGY 247 In chapter 3 Koehl presents the results of a comprehensive study assessing how the rhyta were used - how they were handled and filled/emptied. This analysis is based on his own personal observation of individual forms, their structure and morphology, alongside experimen- tation, using full-size replicas and five intact MM III rhyta from Kommos (259). Koehl also cites analogy as a possible third method of analysis - comparison with similar type vessels of known function from other cultures (260). However, he does not apply this approach systematically, beyond reference to presumed uses of Classical rhyta. Discussion is further supplemented, where possible, with reference to organic residues. In addition, representational evidence indicates how specific forms might have been held. Koehl suggests that for a rhyton to function correctly the secondary aperture could not be any greater than 0.5cm and, moreover, that only liquids could have been used, otherwise the opening would become obstructed (259). Perhaps the most interesting of Koehl's conclusions is that the conical rhyta (his Type III) were used in drinking ceremonies - specifically to mix and strain fermented beverages (270-71). The other forms he accepts as libation vessels. In Chapter 4 Koehl further explores how the rhyta were used in Aegean ritual practices, examining in detail the contexts in which these rhyta were found and perhaps used. Although ancient texts and representations are available, Koehl suggests that these are less useful for such a study than the contextual analysis (277). The discussion is presented chronologically, by region and site: habitation, funerary and other. The range of associated artefacts is also considered - subdivided into categories of eating/drinking, pouring/serving, storage, offering, domestic furnishing, preparation and the catch-all miscellaneous. Perhaps most helpful is the series of tables at the back of the volume, which present the archae- ological data very clearly. The presentation of the material is certainly meticulous, however, moving through the volume to the tables and figures is (as already noted) cumbersome. Moreover, the absence of plans detracts significantly from this section. Rather disappointingly, the presentation of the material assumes prior knowledge of the sites and that the reader will have ready access to the excavation reports. The final section of chapter 4 would be better as a separate chapter. Here Koehl identifies a number of 'special topics' - the criteria for which are not clearly stated. These special topics consider rhyta from particular contexts: Minoan tholos tombs, peak sanctuaries (but not from other religious contexts), foundation deposits and extra-Aegean contexts. Also included in this section are a number of presumed uses: processions (based on depictions of rhyta), ritual and industry, priestly use of rhyta and the engendered use of rhyta. Although the archaeological discussion is impeccable, there is little theorization; this is particularly evident in the section on gender. The text does not attempt to relate the rhyta to the material and social worlds of the ancient inhabi- tants of the Aegean, and as such is out of kilter with many recent material studies from the region. Nevertheless, this is an interesting and stimulating book offering a valuable contribution to Aegean prehistory, in particular in its discussion of the mechanical functions of the rhyta.
