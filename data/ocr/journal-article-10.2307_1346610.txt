<plain_text><page sequence="1">THOREAU'S SYNTHESIZING METAPHOR: TWO FISHES WITH ONE HOOK JAMES A. HAMBY Although some studies have been done concerning Henry David Thoreau's craftsmanship, emphasis is not generally placed on the relationship between Walden's art and Walden's philosophy. Despite its practical application to such diverse contemporary phenomena as nonviolent resistance and communal organization, Walden speaks to us not merely because it affirms the ultimate in man-and-the-land relationships but because its artistic unity also demon- strates how we truly can transcend lives of quiet desperation. This transcen- dence develops through Walden's internal organizing structure of metaphor, and is extended to the point that metaphor becomes philosophic system. Thus Thoreau doubly demonstrates that we can, within ourselves, overcome the perpetual struggle between self and society, that we can emerge from the particular and the finite to the universal and the infinite. Despite the apparently rambling nature of Thoreau's prose, Walden's in- troductory chapter, "Economy," demonstrates economy of expression. Thor- eau's first statement concerning his mode of life refutes the criticism that he is impertinent and states rather that his life-style is "very natural and perti- nent." His uniting the words natural and pertinent has far-reaching implica- tions. Natural suggests the innate, the instinctively moral, the free, the unin- hibited, while pertinent suggests the logical, the suitable, the reasonable. It seems to be a rather ambitious comment for one to claim that his life is both logical or reasonable and, at the same time, natural or free. Thoreau's fusion of two such generally antithetic terms anticipates the sweeping scope of his concerns. The pragmatic orientation of Thoreau's philosophy also asserts itself in the opening essay: "No way of thinking or doing, however ancient, can be trusted without proof." One of the primary purposes of the exposition in "Economy" is to prepare the reader for what is to follow, and Thoreau prepares the mass of men by pointing out that, pragmatically, they lead lives of "quiet despera- tion." Accordingly, he follows this famous moral castigation with pragmatic substantiation, indicating that it is not natural or reasonable that man commit himself to the inherent cyclical decay involved in trying to obtain superfluities beyond the "necessary." Rather, man should . . adventure on life now, his vacation from humbler toil having commenced. The soil, it appears, is suited to the seed, for it has sent its radicle downward, and it may now send its shoot upward also with confidence. Why has man rooted himself thus firmly in the earth, but that he may rise in the same proportion into the heavens above?-for the nobler plants are valued for the fruit they bear at last in the air and light, far from the ground. (pp. 24-25)1 1This and all subsequent page references are to Henry David Thoreau, Walden or Life in the Woods (New York: The Heritage Press, 1939). 17</page><page sequence="2">RMMLA BULLETIN In stating very explicitly his view of living, Thoreau also demonstrates his structural vehicle for Walden. The metaphor of growth, symbolized by a plant, constitutes the internal organizing principle; the self-improvement of man, a reasonable and potentially natural act, forms the thematic content. Consistent with the growth metaphor, Walden is structured as organic de- velopment. The evolution of an acorn into an oak tree and of a larva into a butterfly is one continuous process, yet differences are apparent at the various stages of growth. Earlier sections of Walden mix metaphor and expository statement as Thoreau develops in his readers a sense of the metaphor; later sections are virtually pure metaphor, drenched with symbolic connotations and associations, much as Thoreau drenches himself in Walden Pond. Thus, metaphor eventually becomes philosophic construct. Thoreau builds on the premise that man's chief end in life is to aspire to his ultimate, to realize his full potential as an individual, and to avoid becoming bogged down in the quagmire of cultural conformity. Thoreau is thus firmly embedded in the anti-collectivism, pro-individualism tradition. This opti- mistic view of man's abilities evinces Thoreau's transcendentalism, which he effects through an alliance with nature. Such an inherently mystical way of life would seem to contradict Thoreau's pragmatic and practical criteria of existence. This apparent schism in attitudes is one of the ills which Walden seeks to cure, and the cure requires the synthesis provided by metaphorical expression. It is through this attempt to bridge the gap between rational and suprarational that metaphorical statement becomes philosophical system. Obviously, Thoreau does not suggest that man is a plant. Rather, he makes an analogy between chlorophyll and the spark of the divine that flames in man. According to this analogy, our best approach toward self-improvement involves transcending our degenerate state, a process not unlike photosynthesis. Since Thoreau considers unalloyed transcendentalism too mystical, and un- alloyed pantheism a misdirection of attention to earth worship, he is faced with the necessity of performing a synthesis between these two philosophies. At the same time, he is trying to lead man to a synthesis with nature. With these main goals in view, Thoreau relies heavily on metaphor to accomplish his tasks. The development of the synthesizing metaphor continues throughout each chapter of Walden. As seen in "Economy," the plant image presented both downward growth by its roots and upward growth by its stem and flower. Thus, it epitomizes the chapter's attempt to show that man should not devote himself to labor beyond necessity (his roots), but rather, cultivate his thoughts and appreciations (his stem and flower) once his roots are secured. In the second chapter, "Where I Lived and What I Lived For," Thoreau's final paragraph offers another metaphorical depiction of the desired synthesis: "Time is but a stream I go a-fishing in." He enhances this association by say- ing he would "fish in the sky, whose bottom is pebbly with stars." These 18 MARCH 1973</page><page sequence="3">THOREAU'S SYNTrHF.SrING METAPHOR metaphors suggest the natural world is a vehicle to a higher understanding; through a turning inward, mankind can go outward to a higher reality. Thoreau's metaphor thus combines the two possible errors of transcendental thought and redirects them. Man should not worship the earth nor should he turn away from it. Although the vehicles of Thoreau's metaphors run the gamut of possibilities offered by his natural surroundings, they refer always to the same tenor-the ethereal implications of these surroundings. In the chapter entitled "Sounds," birds rather than plants form the central image. The whip-poor-wills are described as "chanting their vespers," and the serenade of the hooting owl is described as being nature's means of making "permanent in her choir the dying moans of human beings," moans which he feels "represent the stark twilight and unsatisfied thoughts which all have." "Solitude," however, re- turns to the organic metaphor: What do we want to dwell near to? Not to many men surely . . ., but to the perennial source of our life, whence in all our experience we have found that to issue, as the willow stands near the water and sends out its roots in that direction. (pp. 138-139) As Thoreau progresses through Walden, his use of metaphor becomes more frequent and more abstract, but always his metaphors aim at synthesis, at combining the here and the there, the "thisness" of this world and the mysteriousness of the truer world. As Thoreau develops his theme, his metaphors become more complex. In the chapter entitled "The Bean-Field," he describes the nighthawk which circled over his head as being "like a mote in the eye, or in heaven's eye, falling from time to time with a swoop and a sound as if the heavens were rent...." The hawk is "aerial brother of the wave." In addition, hen-hawks circling high in the sky behave "as if they were the embodiment of my [Thoreau's] own thoughts." The hawk thus connects heaven to earth, and sky to water, while the hen-hawks are connections to Thoreau's soaring thoughts. Synthesis thus creates fusions among objects as well as between objects and the observer. Thoreau approaches abstract transcendental thought when, in "The Village," he discusses the method of conscious detachment as helpful in aspiring to truth or a higher reality: "Not till we are lost, in other words not till we have lost the world, do we begin to find ourselves, and realize where we are and the infinite extent of our relations." This somewhat ethereal concern with the infinite in relations is realized by the metaphor pre- sented in the central chapter, "The Ponds." In his description of Walden Pond, Thoreau makes explicit the full import of his synthesizing metaphor. While fishing, his contemplation leads him to realize, "It seemed as if I might next cast my line upward into the air, as well as downward into this element, which was scarcely more dense. Thus I caught 19</page><page sequence="4">RMMLA BULLETIN two fishes as it were with one hook." Thoreau links this metaphor to a descrip- tion of the pond itself. Walden Pond is subject to tide action, an indication that it is more closely tied to natural forces than an isolated pond; further- more, its tide action keeps the shore clear. Thoreau asserts, "'hese are the lips of the lake, on which no beard grows." He then extends the anthropomorphic description: A lake is the landscape's most beautiful and expressive feature. It is earth's eye; looking into which the beholder measures the depth of his own nature. The fluviatile trees next the shore are the slender eye-lashes which fringe it, and the wooded hills and cliffs around are its overhanging brows. (p. 193) Although personified, Walden Pond does not age. Close identification with the pond by its beholder thus immerses the beholder in the pond's qualities. Thoreau's readers similarly plumb such depths to reach new heights. In White Pond, a neighboring pond, and Walden, Thoreau presents his ultimate conception of his synthesis between nature and a higher reality and between nature and man. They are great crystals on the surface of the earth; they are "Lakes of Light." The lakes embody the light of truth and are the means, the vehicle, of reaching the truth. He next attempts a straightforward expository statement about what the realization of the higher reality means to him: Perhaps the facts most astounding and most real are never communicated by man to man. The true harvest of my daily life is somewhat as intangible and indescribable as the hints of morning or evening. It is a little star-dust caught, a segment of the rainbow which I have clutched. (p. 221) Following this abstract and romanticized effort to verbalize the experience, he returns, in "Brute Neighbors," to figurative language to reinforce his sym- bols. Thoreau describes the fall visit of the loons which moult and bathe in Walden Pond. The loons use the pond to cleanse themselves in the same manner that Thoreau uses the pool as a baptismal pond. He washes the karma from his soul before he makes his spiritual ascension. To carry forward the suggestion that loons seem to have some epistemological purpose for diving deep into water (and perhaps to show that his observation is not unique), Thoreau cites the instance of loons having "been caught in New York lakes at a depth of eighty feet, with hooks set for trout...." Quickly adding the comment that "Walden is deeper than that," he uses the loons' behavior to provide a further connection between sky and water. Thoreau has thus carried the reader, by means of his metaphor, to an under- standing of his attitude toward man's potential. He has shown that sincere communion with Walden Pond, his central symbol for all of nature, has the potential of enabling man to reach a higher reality. In following chapters, winter and spring represent stages of that achievement. During the winter season, the dormant time of the pond, Thoreau has a sense of anticipation 20 MARCH 1973</page><page sequence="5">THOREAU'S SYNTHESIZING METAPHOR and apprehension. He is eager for the rebirth, the ascension, the transcen- dence, which spring offers both in the traditional sense and in his special dimension. In the chapter, 'The Pond in Winter," Thoreau stands beside Walden's iced surface and contemplates the world underneath: I look down into the quiet parlor of the fishes, pervaded by a softened light as through a window of ground glass, with its bright sanded floor the same as in sum- mer; there a perennial waveless serenity reigns as in the amber twilight sky, cor- responding to the cool and even temperament of the inhabitants. Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads. (p. 286) Thoreau's use of the word corresponding is philosophical. He desires to cor- respond with a higher reality, and the pond assists in this correspondence. The image of the poet looking down into the pond and waiting is rapidly disspelled with the arrival of spring, the season of rebirth. In "Spring," Thoreau's metaphorical statements occur with an exuberance equal to his glorying in rebirth. The tender grass shoots arrive, and "so our human life but dies down to its roots, and still puts forth its green blade to eternity." Thoreau sees spring's arrival as "an influx of light [that] filled my house... ." He examines the previously ice-covered "eye of the earth" and discovers that "there lay the transparent pond already calm and full of hope as in a summer evening, reflecting a summer evening sky in its bosom, though none was visible overhead, as if it had intelligence with some remote hori- zon." Thoreau has thus realized the unity of nature with his higher reality; his synthesis is complete. In looking at the pond he sees the sky, but it is no longer a reflection. At this point, Thoreau states, 'The impression made on a wise man is that of universal innocence." The year has completed its cycle, and man has com- pleted his; cleansed, he has returned to a universal innocence. When Thoreau notes that "on the third or fourth of May I saw a loon in the pond, and during the first week of the month I heard the whip-poor-will," the reader realizes that Thoreau's symbols have also reached the completion of their cycle. Thus, Thoreau brings the reader back to the beginning, but improved through having self-improvement. The final chapter of Walden seems an anti-climax to the purging of the soul provided by "Spring." Completely ecstatic over his triumph, both in philosophy and literature, Thoreau expounds philosophical maxims from the security of his salvation: "Be a Columbus to whole new continents and worlds within you, opening new channels, not of trade, but of thought"; "Let everyone mind his own business, and endeavor to be what he has made"; "However mean your life is, meet it and live it"; "Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth." Thoreau closes with a metaphorical summation of his attitudes. He states, "If I were confined to a corer of a garret all my days, like a spider, the world would be just as large to me while I had my thoughts about me." Thus 21</page><page sequence="6">22 RMMLA BULLETIN MARCH 1973 he reminds us that it is in the mind, through metaphor, that self-improvement is actualized. His final major paragraph begins with another key metaphor: 'The life in us is like the water in the river." Through this view of the nature of man, Thoreau offers a hope for resurrection and a faith in immortality, since the river's water is unified and unending. Because Walden successfully conveys his message through metaphorical synthesis, the work becomes a triumph not only of philosophy but also of form. The philosophical construct is natural and logical, while the form of the work is associational and poetic. Thoreau realizes that man's rational ability has logical limits, and also that associational thought, or meta- morphosis, can take man beyond logical extensions of self. Man's transcen- dental potential is Thoreau's concern; thus metaphor, through its inherent syn- thesis, surpasses literary device and becomes a system of philosophy. Through Walden's unified style and statement, the reader emerges, just as the bug emerges from its years in the apple-wood table. The pond is the sky, and Walden Pond is Walden the text.</page></plain_text>
