<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME LIV, No. 11 MAY 23, 1957 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY INTRODUCTORY NOTE WI7 ITH this number the JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY is initiating a series of double numbers each devoted to translations of excerpts from philosophical works by contemporaries writing in a more or less foreign language. The selections have been made with a view to the interests of Americall readers, and the aim of the series is to make more available to American students of philosophy some of the publications in other languages, which, if written in English, would have many interested readers in the United States. Analo- gous German and Italian numbers are in preparation, and the plan is to publish also, if possible, numbers for Scandiinavian and Slavic languages. For the preparation of this French number the JOURNAL is in- debted to a French philosopher, a member of its editorial staff, Robert Champigny, Professor of French Literature in Indiana Uni- versity. He has provided notes as well as translations for the writings selected. Acknowledg,ment is made to the following publishers for per- mission to translate parts of their publications: to Presses Universitaires, for Gaston Bachelard's Le Materialisme rationtnel (1953), pp. 17-23, 32-35, and Raymond Ruyer's Neo-finalisnie (1952), pp. 242-245, 260- 263; to Gallimard for Jean-Paul Sartre's Saint Genet corne'dien et martyr (1952), pp. 29-41, 542-550. THE EDITORS 313</page><page sequence="2">314 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY TRANSLATIONS FROM THE WRITINGS OF CONTEMPORARY FRENCH PHILOSOPHERS By ROBERT CHAMPIGNY With Comments by the Translator SARTRE ON GOOD AND EVIL The main perspective in Sartre's philosophy is moral. This has become more and more obvious in the works which have followed L'Etre et le neant. L'Etre et le neant itself, in which the concept of freedom is indissolubty linked to that of responsibility, was intended to set the stage for an examination of moral questions. The term "being" itself, which serves as a terminological basis for the vocabulary of this work, is not without moral connotations. There is nothing new in this and it is not the first time that an author has conceived an ontology or a metaphysics as a preparation for a moral system. But while the term "being" traditionally emerges from the ontological or metaphysical parade as the authentic moral ideal, Sartre makes it represent a certain ideal, the ideal of an unauthentic brand of morals, of the instinctive morals of being. Actually, the unauthenticity of being as a moral ideal is not quite unmasked in L'Etre et le neant, a ruse which has thrown many early commentators off the track. They have labeled Sartre a pessimtistic philosopher, whereas Sartre is pessimistic only as far as the man who clings to the morals of being is concerned. They have mistaken the masked villain for Sartre 's mouthpiece. With his flair for the dramatic, Sartre postponed the coup de theatre. This coup de theatre occurs in the essay Saint Genet comedien et martyr (NRF, 1952). Being and non-Being sutddenly appear in a glaring moral light: Being is identified with the Good and non-Being wvith Evil. Of course these two theatrical monsters do not define Sartre's own brand of ethics. But he carries on the strategy which he had adopted in L 'Etre et le neant. He accepts the identification of Being with the Good as he finds it in the theo- logical tradition; he accepts the incoherence of the concept of the Good as he finds it in boturgeois morals: the Good as transcendent object, as moral ideal, as characteristic of certain ctstoms, of certain natural or man-nmade objects, of a certain set social order. And he takes advantage of this incoherence to criticize the morals of the</page><page sequence="3">CONTEMPORARY FRENCH PHILOSOPHERS 315 good as he had, less openty, sapped the fomtndations of the morals of being in L 'Etre et le neant. A more correct philosophical procedure might have consisted in pointing out, at the start, the incoherence of the concepts of Being and of the Good. From there one could proceed to define what is moral (for Sartre, an action aimed at a liberation) whether the term "good," duty amended, be kept as a synonym of "moral" or not- In favor of Sartre, however, it may be argited that this dr-amatic strategy is not necessarily unworthy of a philosopher. The ex- ample of Socrates may be invoked. Instead of pointing omt at the start the incoherence of the opponent's position, Socrates feigned to accept his position and let the opponent sink from incoherence into contradiction. Sartre adopts the same strategy in Saint Genet comediell et martyr. Though his bitter mood and pugnacious style are hardly reminiscent of a Platonic dialogue, his method is an example of Socratic irony. Sartre transposes into dramatic and philosophical terms the implicit dialogue which went on between the French bourgeois commrunity and Genet, an abandoned child who became a juvenile delinqtent, a homosexual, a thief, and a "scandalouts" writer. The child Genet has been caught in the act of stealing by the people to whont he had been entrusted. Sartre considers this event as decistve. It is at this point that he brings on the stage the allegorical monsters of Good and Evil. Every action modifies what is in the name of what is not yet. Since it cannot realize itself without breaking the former order, it is a permanent revolution. It destroys in order to build and, in order to assemble, disassembles; from morning till night we pile up ashes and scraps: Every construction implies as much de- struction. Now, our unstable societies are in fear of losing their balance: The negative moment of our activity is consequently ignored. We would have to love without hatred the enemies of what we love, affirm without denying the contrary of what we affirm, elect without rejecting those whom we did not elect, pro- duce without consuming. The dead are taken away in a hurry, the scraps are discreetly recuperated; every day, a "cleaning" operation is resumed, which is destined to mask what was destroyed the day before; the plunder of the planet is ignored. So great is the fear that the building might fall, that even the power of creat- ing is denied: Man is not supposed to invent, but to discover. The new is reduced to the old. To maintain, to conserve, to restore,</page><page sequence="4">316 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY to renew, such are the allowed actions; they all belong to the category of repetition. Everything is full, everything is in order, everything has always existed, the world is a museum and we are its curators. Yet the Spirit, in Hegel's words, is disquiet. But this disquiet repels us: What we must do is suppress it and stop the spirit by expelling the spring of negativity. As he cannot completely jugulate this malignant postulation, the righteous man castrates himself: From his freedom he cuts off the negative moment and throws the bloody mass away. Thus freedom is cut in two; the two halves wither away. One of the halves stays in us. It identifies forever the Good with Being, hence with what already is: Since Being is the criterion of perfection, an existing regime is always better than a regime which is not: We say that it has proved itself. If someone wants to introduce the slightest improvement (and it must be understood that "improvement" is a pious notion implying no destruction: It is a passage to a higher perfection which retains the former perfection), he is re- quired to prove himself and show oii all other points a deep attach- ment to Being, that is, to customs and traditions. For the man of the Good, it is one and the same thing to be alone and to be wrong. To isolate oneself is to retreat deliberately into one 's finitude, hence to will one's own nonentity. The dream of the righteous man is that history come to an end so that the time of happy repetition in the bosom of the big sleep may come at last. Of course, he is fallible, but it is through omission, ignorance, weak- ness, in a word, through this trace of nonentity which remains in him and with which he has to put up. He will compensate for this singularity by a strict obedience to the collective imperatives. Anyhow, to fail is literally nothing: Our faults are lacks of being and their only efficacity is due to the Being which supports them; the worst is not always certain. But the other half of his freedom, from which he has cut him- self off, refuses to let him alone. The poor man of the Good wanted to be concerned only with the positive, with being, to obey without failure, to realize for himself a small local end of history. But history does not stop, Being is caught, enveloped by non- Being; and above all, man, whether he be respectful or irreverent, insolent or slavish, cannot affirm without denying: If he draws a limit, it is in order to overstep it. For he cannot posit this limit without positing the unlimited at the same time. He may resolve to abide by a social taboo; but at that very moment his freedom proposes a violation since it is one and the same thing to give oneself laws and to create the possibility of disobeying them. The righteous man shuts himself up in a voluntary prison, locks the</page><page sequence="5">CONTEMPORARY FRENCH PHILOSOPHERS 317 doors, and his obstinate freedom makes him go out through the window. It is the law, said Saint Paul, which creates sin. The righteous man will make himself deaf, mute, paralyzed: He has eyes that he may not see and ears that he may not hear; he is by himself the most abstract negation: the negation of negation. He Will bind himself with traditions, with obedience, with the mecha- nisms of the Good and he will name temptation this teeming, in- distinct life which is still himself, but a wild, free self, outside the limits which he has drawn. His own negativity falls outside him, since he denies it with all his might. Reified, separated from all positive intenition, it becomes a pure negation which posits itself for itself, a pure fury of destruction revolving around itself: Evil. Evil is the unity of all his impulses to criticize, to judge, to reject, insofar as he refuses to recognize them, to see in them the normal exercise of his freedom, and insofar as he relates them to an ex- ternal cause. It is his fearful desire to follow his ideas to the end when decency or discipline order him to stop midway; it is his uneasiness, his fundamental disbelief or his singularity coming to him from the outside as Another himself, to tempt him. It is what he walnts but refuses to want, it is the object of a constant and constantly refused will which he considers as other than his "real" will, in short, it is the impact within him and outside him, of the will of the Other. Not the will of someone else, not even the will of all the others, but the will of what in each one is other than himself, other than all the others. Evil is the Other and it is him- self insofar as he is for himself Other than himself, it is the will to be other and that everything should be Other, it is what is always Other than what it is. This strange object is pure contradiction, which is not sur- prising in view of its origin: Since it is the destruction of every- thing, it destroys itself, it is at every moment its own contrary; if we tried to encompass it, we should get lost in the labyrinth of aporias and antinomies. It is and it is not, all at once: A pure negation, it reduces itself to pure non-being; but since it remains before our eyes as a temptation, since it possesses enough reality to stir up hatred, it has to be in some way. Of course, it can be said, in a Christian manner, that it borrows its being from being; but it must already be, in order to "borrow. " And, from a certain point of view, it must be admitted that Being is first: Since Evil is defined as that which is Other than Being, it seems that, logically at least, Being comes before its "Other"; and since the evil power is in essence a will to destroy, it must have something to attack and it cannot manifest itself before this something is given. But since, on the other hand, we have made its concept by dividing what</page><page sequence="6">318 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY was not divisible and by separatinig with one stroke of the axe the two indivisible moments of human freedom, we are compelled to admit that Good and Evil are contemporary, that is, in religious language, that they are both eternal principles: The righteous man is manichean. Evil is both the Being of Non-Being and the Non- Being of Being. The same reasons will entail the second antinomy: Since Evil is the other than Being, it is relative in essence; but as it is absolutely other, Evil must be an absolute in its own way. Absolute and relative at once, it is both an absolute principle and a singular will. Inasmuch as it is made the cause of every de- terioration and ruin, even those which are caused by natural agents, it is a pneumatic principle which pervades the world. There is an evil special to consciousness as to other things, a leprosy which may be called dullness, stupidity, darkness. But, in another perspective, in the same way that there is no Good except in a will which wills itself unconditionally good, there is no Evil except in an intention which wants to be expressly evil: Evil is then conscience itself at the peak of lucidity, for a bad conscience is all the more perverse as it knows and wills its damnation. It pursues both its triumph and its perdition; first because it will be wrecked by its victory at the same time as the Good, and then because its destructive fury must be infinite and, in the end, be turned against itself: "Diabolic laughter" and "diabolic pleasure" have been invented so that despair may be placed at the heart of the joy of doing evil. In the end, Evil of conscience, which is opacity, must be identified with conscience in Evil, which is transparency. As a matter of fact, in this absolute and personal freedom which affirms itself as singularity against the world and against God, in this free and radical project of de- struction which claims the responsibility of its actions in their consequences and to its own ruin, it is customary to perceive at the same time an absolute slavery. The righteous man has invented the myth of Evil by depriving human freedom of its positive power and by reducing it to its negativity. Thus negative in es- sence, the wicked man is a possessed soul whose destiny, whatever he does, will always be to do evil; he is free in order to do evil, for him the worst is always certain. For it is not enough that his conduct should entail baneful consequences for others, it is not enough that in the eyes of others his conduct should appear con- demnable: For Evil to be absolute, it must be hated by the very man who does evil. If the wicked man were in agreement with himself, this agreement would have the appearance of the Good and if his conduct appeared to him tolerable, he would sin through ignorance, not through wickedness. He must aim at the worst and</page><page sequence="7">CONTEMPORARY FRENCH PHILOSOPHERS 319 attain it through a sort of inverted grace, he must both fling him- self and resist, he must want to stop and go further, he must be one with his project to do evil while recognizing it as abominable. The wicked man approves of himself and hates himself, he hates himself for approving of himself, he approves of himself for hating himself: His conscience is complete darkness at the heart of translucidity. This secret dazed condition of conscience is alterity: to be oneself and other than oneself in the absolute identity of the self. Being and Non-Being, Absolute and Relative, Principle and Person, self-love and self-hatred, Evil is finally both Order and Disorder. Disorder by definition, since all its efforts are intended to destroy order: As Claudel says, it does not "compromise." And yet, in order to be efficacious, it must be empowered to de- stroy, it must have a sort of order, a technique, traditions. It is thus the di-sorder of all orders, the order of all disorders. A gnawing acid, a tempest, a bomb, it is a radical dispersion, it changes the most indissoluble unity into multiplicity; but since it brings discord, since it is the greatest common measure, it must be the secret, unattainable unity of every multiplicity. If such is Evil, the geometric locus of all contradictions, it is obvious that nobody would throw himself headlong into it: "Nobody does evil deliberately." Of course: What is there to gain? Evil is gratuitous; it is a superfluouis activity which re- quires leisure and brings no profit. "Crime does not pay. " Quite true: Evil, like Good, must be its own reward. If you steal, if you kill in order to live, it is because living is good: You have reduced stealing and murder to the level of a means. Evil is exhausting, it requires an unbearable vigilance. Schiller, who was obsessed by Kantian morals, questioned himself anxiously about every action: "Have I sufficiently probed into my conscience, has not an interested motive escaped my scrutiny?" Likewise the wicked man should ask himself anxiously: "Did I really do evil for the sake of evil? Did I seek no profit?" In order that the wicked action be an end in itself, it must contain and solve so many contradictions that it requires invention, inspiration, in short, genius. Genet likens it to a work of art, more particularly to poetry. Popular conscience clearly knows that evil is beyond our means: It has invented the myth of the man who sold his soul to the devil. This man is not strong enough, not pure enough to do evil for the sake of evil: He pursues his pleasure, he wants gold, women, power. It is Satan who, through him, pursues the damna- tion of souls, through sheer wickedness. A bright-eyed minister came up to me, one day, at the end of a lecture in which I had tried to unravel the views of some contemporary moralists, and</page><page sequence="8">320 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY told me: "It is so much easier to do one's duty." I must confess that he corrected himself almost at once: "And more difficult too, more difficult." But I had understood his first attitude: Yes, the Good as it is commonly understood is easier than Evil. It is easy and reassuring to "do one's duty": It is a matter of practice since everything is repetition. Who would, of his own free will, leave the herd and its comfortable precepts in order to join this mutilated freedom whose bloody limbs writhe in the dust? The necessary conclusion seems to be that there is no wicked man: The only man who makes Evil his constant concern is the righteous man, since Evil is first of all his own freedom, an ever- quickening enemy which he must crush down again and again. But let us not be too hasty: The wicked man exists, we meet him everywhere, all the time; he exists because the righteous man has invented him. .****..............****.***. ***.......... ............... The wicked man is the Other. Fleeting, clever, marginal, Evil can be seen only out of the corner of the eye and in someone else. This is never more obvious than in war-time: We know the enemy only through comparisons with ourselves; we imagine his inten- tions according to ours, we devise the traps into which we know we would fall and we avoid those which we would have laid. The enemy is our twin brother, our mirror-image. Yet the very con- duct that we judge good when it is ours seems to us horrible when it is his. He is the wicked man par excellence: Thus it is in war- time that the conscience of the righteous man is in perfect peace; it is in war-time that there are the fewest madmen. Unfortunately, one cannot always fight; from time to time, one has to make peace. For peacetime use, society has wisely created professional wicked men. These "men of evil" are as necessary to the men of the good as prostitutes to honest women: They are abscesses of fixation. One sadist brings peace, clarity, and tranquillity to many a con- science. This is why wicked men are carefully selected. They must be wicked by birth and without any hope of change. Pref- erence will be granted to people with whom the honest members of the community have no reciprocal relations, so that these wicked men may not repay us in kind and think of us what we think of them. As Evil is negation, separation, disintegration, its natural representative will be chosen among the outcasts and the separatists, among those who cannot be assimilated, among the undesirable. Among the candidates are the oppressed, foreign workers, na- tional and ethnic minorities. But these are not the best recruits: These persons may become organized, educated, they may become conscious of their race or of their class; through hatred they re-</page><page sequence="9">CONTEMPORARY FRENCH PHILOSOPHERS 321 cover the sense of reciprocity and the oppressor embodies Evil in their eyes in the same way they embody Evil in the oppressor's eyes. Fortunately there exist in our society products of disas- similation, scraps: abandoned children, "the poor," fallen bour- geois, "Lumpenproletariat," d eclasses of all kinds, in short all the wvretched. With these we can relax: They cannot join any group because nlobody wants them; and since solitude is their lot, we are sure that they will not associate with one another. That is why, generally speaking, they are given preference. Genet fills all the requirements: This abandoned child is an authentic scrap; he seems to be stricken with an uncanny bad luck which makes us safe against aln accidental return of reciprocity; while he was under observation, he evinced bad instincts and com- mitted reprehensible actiolns. That was enough: Through the glance which caught him, through the finger which was pointed at him, through the voice which named him a thief, the community dedicated him to evil.... In order to know ourselves, we can use two sources of informa- tion: our "inner eye" ("I am happy, unhappy; I feel attracted, repelled by this person; I feel like traveling, etc.") and the people around us. Sometimes the two categories of information add up; they can correct each other. For instance, I may realize that I am angry when my brother tells me I am losing my self-control. The people around me may even make me notice an irritation which I am trying to conceal from myself: "You are as white as a sheet, your hands are trembling, etc." Conversely, by telling them about my anger, I may help them interpret certain aspects of my conduct which remained mysterious to them: "So that's why you did not say hello to so-and-so, etc." To hesitate between two directions often means to turn one's head to the right, then to the left, to take two steps in one direction, then in the other. If I hesitate, there is probably nothing more in me than the awareness of these motions. But, conversely, the witness who sees me hesi- tating perceives nothing more in me than the same motions. So the external perception of the witness and my inner awareness are agreed on this point, and in this case there is no privileged ob- server. But in most cases and especially when sentiments, qualities, character traits, or complicated behaviors are involved, we cannot make our inner information correspond to the information obtained from external observers, because the two are different in kind. For I am not an object for myself-at least, not at first-and, if I become an object, this object is of a very special kind; it remains this "incomparable monster" of which Malraux speaks;</page><page sequence="10">322 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY whereas for someone else I am first of all an object. Thus the objective qualities which they see in me express less what I am by myself than what I am in relation to them. The quality in question represents a complex set of two terms: myself and my witness and the relation between these two terms. Moreover, most of the time, this quality has a practical truth; it is information concerning mainly the conduct to adopt in relation to me. Con- sequently I cannot interiorize this information and dissolve it in my subjectivity: It is not soluble in my consciousness. If I am told that I am intelligent and witty or on the contrary obtuse and crude, these pieces of information describe the effect which I pro- duce on someone else. For example, to be witty is to amuse a particular social milieu in accordance with certain rules. Conse- quently I cannot have the intuition that I am witty: This intuition is necessarily given to someone else; it is revealed to him through the pleasure that he experiences. Likewise I can know myself as thinking, but not as intelligent. The idea of irtelligence implies not only a certain grace or speed in intellectual processes witnessed from the outside, but also a certain subjective disposition in the witness who recognizes this quality in me: for example, admiration and an inclination to trust me more than himself when certain difficulties are to be solved: "You who are smart, see if you under- stand this. " Thus when everything is in order, we can distinguish our being for ourself from our being for the other. We know that our consciousness is infallible in a very restricted field and that its intuitions are evidently true; we also know that the information given by someone else is only probable (this man thinks I am intelligent but another man thinks I am stupid. Who will decide? Can a majority decision be considered valid in this domain?) and that it does not concern our inner depth but our external relation to other people. It is consequently true that these qualities which are bestowed on us escape our consciousness but it is not because they are hidden in the unconscious, it is because they are before us in the world and because they are originally a relation to the other. "To be witty" is of course a certain gift which I have if I have it-without realizing it. But it is evident that it is no more a structure of my unconscious than an immediate datum of my consciousness. It is a trait which defines me not insofar as I am I for myself, but insofar as I am someone else for someone else. But it sometimes happens that this information is communicated to us in such a way that we grant more reality to what someone else tells us than to what we could learn by ourselves. Out of submission or respect we take a piece of information, which can be only probable, for an unconditional certainty; what our con-</page><page sequence="11">CONTEMPORARY FRENCH PIHILOSOPHERS 323 sciousness tells us, on the colntrary, we are tempted to hold as doubtful or obscure. This means that we have granted a primacy to the object we are for the others over the subject we are for our- selves. This young woman, for instance, is not fully accepted by her in-laws; she feels her husband is escaping from her; to keep him, to fight off prejudices, she would need tact, patience, and a lot of experience. As she does not possess these qualities she has the impression of drowning, she struggles in vain, the difficulties are too great, she lives in a state of malaise. And as customary, her reaction is anger: For anger is a blind, magical attempt to simplify over-complex situations. If she watches herself with enough perseverance, her conscience is going to tell her all this. She will catch herself in the act, trying to do away with all con- straints by electing violence. She will understand that anger is not a hereditary curse nor a destiny but merely 'a clumsy reaction to an over-difficult problem: Let the problem change, the mood will change. Now, her husband tells her that she has a temper. And in a sense this is true: It is a correct indication of the behavior to be adopted by other people in relation to her. This practical notion merely indicates that, for other people, she has disconcerting and unforeseeable fits of anger and that, in consequence, she must be handled with kid gloves. But if, out of remorse, out of masochism, out of a deep feeling of inferiority, this young woman adopts the objective and social information as if it were her absolute truth, if she tells herself that anger is a part of her nzature, if she projects behind herself, into the darkness of the unconscious, a permanent tendency to anger from which every particular fit of temper emanates, then she sub- ordinates her reality as a conscious subject to the reality that she is for others; and she gives to the Other a superiority over herself, to what is probable a superiority over what is certain. On what had only a social significance, she confers a metaphysical sense anterior to all social relations. In short, I shall say that she loses herself for the sake of the object that she is for the others. This type of alienation is quite common. But most of the time, it is only a partial or temporary alienation. But when a child is subjected, from early childhood, to considerable social pressure, when his Being-for-Others is the object of a collective representa- tion accompanied by judgments of value and social taboos, the alienation may be total and final. This is the case of most pariahs in a caste society: They interiorize the objective external judg- ments of the community and they judge themselves in their sub- jective singularity on the basis of an "ethnic characteristic," of a "nature," of an "essence " which in fact represent only the con-</page><page sequence="12">324 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY tempt in which they are held. The Indian untouchable thinks that he is really untouchable. He interiorizes the taboo which bears on him and he makes it an inner principle which justifies and explains the conduct of the other Hindus toward him. For the small caste of untouchables that our societies have entrusted with embodying Evil and which becomes taboo under the name of criminal world, the situation is exactly the same. Indeed, they are criminals: This means, in good logic, that they have committed one or several crimes and that they are liable to sanctions defined by the law. But, thanks to the ambiguity of the term, they become persuaded that this objective definition also applies to their secret subjective being: The criminal that they were for others is now lurking in the depths of their souls like a monster; thus they let themselves be governed by someorne else, that is to say, by a being who is real only in the eyes of others; their faults and their mistakes are transformed into a permanent disposition, i.e., into a destiny. Such is the case of the child Genet. The community has en- trusted him with embodying Evil, i.e., the Other. Now, as we have seen, Evil is a concept for external use. Before being branded as a culprit, nobody will say: "I want Evil." Originally, evil comes from the fear which the honest man feels when he faces his freedom; it is a projection and a catharsis. Therefore, it is always an object. If we try to integrate it, the contradictory terms which compose it will repel each other violently and will fall away from each other. But it does not matter to us since precisely we encounter Evil in someone else. Yes, for us, Evil is impossible and we do not attempt to actualize it. But, since this other man wants Evil, let him take care of its contradiction. That it is possible to make everything hold together, with the help of an efficacious grace which must come from Hell, is proved by the fact that there are wicked men. There are wicked men, hence evil is possible. Such is our a posteriori demonstration. But then what becomes of the wretch into whom the righteous man has projected his impure desires, his sadism, his homicidal impulses, and his lustful dreams? How will he manage to make all these contradictory postulations hold together? Well, that's his problem. The righteous man does not give a damn. Now the respectful conscience of the child Genet has begun its work. For other people, Evil is outside, in other people. But for him, the poor deceived child, evil is within. For the others, his function is to assume their forbidden desires and reflect them; for himself, he must interiorize these desires, make them his. He is not asked to desire what is impure or to</page><page sequence="13">CONTEMPORARY FRENCH PHILOSOPHERS 325 want evil through deliberate intentions; he is only required to recognize that this perverse will inspires his daily desires and intentions. The child does as best he can: His candor, his trust, his respect make him an excellent auxiliary of the grown-ups. He has been told that he is wicked, he believes it; at the heart of his subjectivity he conscientiously looks for the impure desires and thoughts of the righteous people. He is sedulously wicked. But Evil is the Other. The Other than Being, the Other than the Good, the Other than oneself: This is the key to Genet. This is what must be uniderstood from the start. Genet is a child whom people have convinced that he is in his innermost another than himself. From now on his life will be but the history of his at- tempts to get hold of this Other within himself in order to look at him, that is to say, in order to have an immediate and subjective intuition of his wickedness, in order to feel himself wicked- or in order to flee from it. But this ghost, precisely because it is nothing, will thwart his efforts: When the child turns round to face it, it disappears; when Genet tries to flee from it, suddenly, like Carmen's bird, it appears. The most immediate result is that the child is faked. He holds the existence of the grown-ups as more certain than his own and their testimony as truer than the testimony of his consciousness. He affirms the priority of the object he is for them over the subject he is for himself; so, without clearly realizing this, he deems that appearance (what he is for them) is reality and that reality (what he is for himself) is but appearance. It is his intimate cer- tainty which he sacrifices to the principle of authority; he refuses to hear the voice of the cogito and he believes that even his self- consciousness deceives him: The internal evidence which concerns his own sentiments he considers to be lies, at best approximations; on the other hand, he holds as certain the hypotheses, which are in fact only probable, that others make about his conduct; he en- deavors to believe that his singular essence must be announced to him by others and that, by himself, he cannot reach it because it is hidden from him by definition: What is most intimately himself is what is most obscure in his eyes and most manifest in the eyes of others. An inverted Descartes, he applies his methodical doubt to the contents of the "I think," and it is knowledge by hearsay which will give him what he considers certain. An inverted ideal- ist, it is to himself that he applies the famous Esse est percipi anid he recognizes that he is only insofar as he is perceived. Our certainty of ourselves finds its truth in the Other when the latter recognizes us. For Genet, truth is separated from certainty; it will be the intimidating official thought of the adults, of the</page><page sequence="14">326 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY judges, of the cops, of the righteous people: He receives it without participating, it is communicated to him like a sentence. In the meantime, in solitude, contestation, and silence, his self-certainty grows like a weed in an abandoned garden. Of course, one cannot quite silence the cogito. Genet 's con- sciousness will not lose its transparency; it will continue to reveal to him indubitable evidences. But he will do his utmost to close the eyes of his soul, to question evidence itself, to doubt the in- dubitable. He is tossed between two contradictory systems of reference; he considers true what he cannot manage to believe and he considers doubtful that of which he is certain. His most manifest intentions become the most obscure; the transitory modes of his consciousness are pure reflections which flicker and vanish; as for his own existence, since he realizes it only through the mediation of others and confuses it with this substantial being: "the wicked man" or "the thief," he is no more certain of it than of the existence of Greenland or of the Iron Mask. In short, he learns how to think the unthinkable, how to uphold what cannot be upheld, and posit as true what he knows to be manifestly false. We shall see that on this basis he will build a whole sophistic system and that one day he will turn this system against the astonished righteous man. *P * * Thus Genet is built by Sartre into a Socrates. By playing and overplaying (when he becomes a writer) the role which the French bourgeois society has assigned to him, he becomes the tell- tale mirror of this society. By building for himself a system of evil exactly patterned after the official morals of the good, he discloses the contradictions inherent in the morals of the good. By living as a "comedian and martyr" of morals, he renders intolerable in our own eyes the incoherences of the "moral" code, which we ordinarily overlook or shrug away "philosophically." Obviously Sartre is not partial to this kind of "wisdom." Here are the concluding pages of his essay on Genet. *P * * Man, says Marx, is an object for man. This is true. But it is also true that I am a subject for myself, to the very extent that the other is an object in my eyes. And that is what separates us: He and I are not homnogeneous and we can be part of a whole only in the eyes of a third man who considers both of us as one object. If we could all be in a perfect simultaneity and reciprocity, both objects and subjects for one another and by one another, or if we</page><page sequence="15">CONTEMPORARY FRENCH PHILOSOPHERS 327 could be fused together into an objective totality, or if we always were, as in the Kantian City of the ends, subjects recognizing one another as subjects, the separations would disappear; but the limit cannot be reached in either direction: We cannot all be objects except for a transcendent subject, we cannot all be subjects unless we undertake first the impossible liquidation of all objectivity. As for absolute reciprocity, it is masked by historical conditions of class and race, by nationalities, by social hierarchy; the leader is never an object for his subordinate or he is finished; he is seldom a subject for his superiors. So we generally live in a sort of familiar and unthinking indistinction. We pass unnoticed. In our profession, in our family, in our party, we are neither a pure object nor a pure subject. The Other is this instrument which obeys my voice, which regulates and distributes; and it is also this warm and diffuse atmosphere which surrounds us. And that is what we also are for the others and consequently for ourselves. But this immediate indistinction contains the seeds of a dis- equilibrium: You are with all the others, you write for everybody, you call as a witness God or the human species, or history, or your next-door neighbor, you are the docile instrument of a family, of a milieu, of a profession, of a party, of a church, your thoughts come to you from the outside in the newspapers, on the radio, in lectures and speeches, and you redistribute them at once. You do not remain for one moment without speaking or listening; you always say or hear what anybody would have said or heard in your place; you are subjected from dawn until night to the tyranny of the human face, you have no secrets, no mystery and you do not want to have any-and yet in some way you are alone. And I do not place this solitude in our private life, which is but a sector of our public life, nor in our tastes which are social and common: I find it everywhere. Since it is a negation, it is the negative of our loves, of our actions, of our private or political life. It is neither subjectivity proper nor objectivity, but the relation be- tween the two when it is experienced as a failure. This solitude ap- pears at the heart of communication, as poetry appears at the heart of prose, because the most clearly expressed and best understood thoughts contain something which is not communicable: I can make them be conceived as I conceive them, but I cannot make them be lived as I live them. This solitude can be found in reciprocal love: when you cannot share with your wife the taste which you have in common with thousands of strangers, when you remain separated from her in pleasure. In these examples, subjectivity does not sueceed in dissolving objectivity. But we are also alone when we cannot reduce ourselves to pure objects: Surrounded, supported,</page><page sequence="16">328 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY fed, recreated by your party, you wish you were only a cell of this great body and yet you feel your solitude for the simple reason that it always remains possible for you to leave it and that your very fidelity is voluntary, or because you are afraid that one day you will be led to criticize the leaders and disobey them, in short be- cause you feel an anxiety when you face your freedom and to the extent that you are not the stick or the corpse which you try to imitate. The victor is alone because he cannot identify himself completely with the beautiful objeet which is carried in triumph: because of his secret defeat. This vague feeling of an inadequacy between the subjective and the objective would not matter too much, for we spend our time hiding it from ourselves; but our professional mistakes, our oversights, our blunders, and our mis- haps suddenly exasperate this feeling. The error, the failure, the misdemeanor, create a vacuum around us; suddenly, the others see us, we come out of the original indistinction, we appear as ob- jects; at the same time, we feel that we are looked at, we feel ourselves blushing and growing pale, we are subjects. In fine, our solitude is the way in which we experience our objectivity for the others in our subjectivity and in the case of a failure. The ex- treme case is that of the criminal and the madman who are pure objects and solitary subjects; their frenzied subjectivity reaches solipsism at the moment when they are reduced for others to the condition of a pure instrument, of a pure being-there without fu- ture, prisoners who are dressed and undressed and fed by hand. On one side, dream, autism, absence; on the other a concentration- ary universe. On the one hand, shame and the powerless hatred which is turned against itself and flings a pointless challenge at Heaven; on the other, the opaque being of the stone, human ma- terial. The man who becomes aware of this explosive contradiction knows true solitude, the solitude of the monster, an error of Nature and Society; he lives to the extreme, to the impossible, this latent solitude which is ours and which we try to ignore. You are not alone if you are right, because truth will out; you are not alone if you are wrong, because it will be enough to confess your errors for them to be erased. You are alone when you are right and wrong at the same time: when you consider that you are right as a subject-because you are conscious, because you live, and because you cannot and will not deny what you wanted-and when you consider that you are wrong as an object because you cannot refuse the objective condemnation which the whole com- munity pronounces. In order to descend toward the solitude of the unique there is only one way: that of error and failure, which goes through helplessness and despair. You will be alone if you</page><page sequence="17">CONTEMPORARY FRENCH PHILOSOPHERS 329 know that you are only a guilty object in the eyes of everyone, while your conscience, in spite of itself, continues to approve of itself; you will be alone if the community cancels you and you cannot cancel yourself: "The impossible nonentity" of Genet is solitude. But it is not enough to know it; it has to be lived, hence made. At this juncture, two attitudes are possible. Bukharin is a conspirator; this does not mean that he is op- posed as a sutbject to governmental policies: He does what the objective situation requires. Everything remains objective: Ob- jective deviations require an objective corrective, that is all. If he had seized in time the reins of power, the Revolution would have continued smoothly: Who in the U.S.S.R. would have dared to say a word about a change in the top-men? If he had won, Bukharin would have remained a stick, a corpse, an instrument governed by history; he would not have changed things, but things would have been changed through him; and since, as Merleau-Ponty says, "the paradox of history consists in the fact that a contingent future, once it has become present, appears real and even necessary," the manifest necessity of his victory would have completed his dissolu- tion in the historical process. But he fails; and the necessity of his defeat reveals to him that his attempt was doomed to failure, that it was rejected a priori by objective reality; it had only the reality of a shadow and it could arise only from a shadow, a nonentity: the Communist who turns against history. Bukharin learns what he is lnot, what he will not do: He is not the historical process, he will not make the prescribed correction. Now that history rejects him, he is defined in his own eyes only through non-being: He is the one who did not succeed, who could not succeed; he is an error, a lack of power. He may keep the hope that others will succeed one day; but they will be other men, with other means, in other circumstances. Their triumph will demonstrate that his attempt was useless and premature; it will make him even more guilty. Whatever happens, history can but condemn him: It had not chosen him, he had chosen himself. Wrong, error, presumption, failure, impotence: These negations reveal him in his own eyes as a subject. A subject by default and not by ex- cess: by all that he did not understand or do. A subject because of the nothingness that is in him: an impossible nonentity. He still thinks, probably, that his appraisal of the historical situation was right; but there was no time to correct these deviations, His- tory was choosing another way, a slower but safer way, the only one that was possible and necessary. It was not his role to medi- ate: He was wrong because he was right. And since his project was to result in failure, it was wrong at the start. "This is an</page><page sequence="18">330 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY austere concept of responsibility, which is concerned not with what men wanted, but with what they happen to have done in the light of the event." The opposition which seizes power can save a country in peril; the opposition which fails can but weaken it. "In the light of the event," Bukharin discovers his subjectivity in his treason and his treason in his subjectivity. Of course he did not want to be a traitor; but this was not enough: He should have wanted not to betray, hence keep quiet. Here again he is reproached with something that was not, that was absent in the intention. Thus a careless driver is condemned because he killed through imprudence, that is, because he did not think of slowing down, because of what was not in his thoughts, not because of what was there. Therefore Bukharin is a traitor; a traitor be- cause he took the risk of serving, if he failed, the purpose of the enemies of the Revolution; a traitor because he separated himself from objectivity, because he judged as a subject and accepted the possibility that his attempt should remain subjective, that is to say, should fail and threaten to harm the development of socialism; a traitor, not because he rejected revolutionary principles, but on the contrary because he still abides by them at the very moment when he endangers the Revolution. Since he cannot appeal to his former comrades who condemn him, nor to his former enemies whom he continues to hate, nor to posterity which will perhaps not uphold the accusation of treason but will at least place him among historical blunderers, he is alone. He finds in himself only nothingness and failure. And since he is nothing, he turns against this subjectivity which isolates him; his last gesture, which unfortunately is still subjective, aims at a self-annihilation; he refuses to listen to his own testimony and see himself as something else than an object; he reduces himself to the traitor that he is for everyone, still a stick but a broken stick: He confesses that he is a traitor. Such is the first attitude: The solitary escapes solitude through a moral suicide; he is rejected by men, so he makes him- self a stone among the stones. Here is the second attitude. For Genet is the Bukharin of a bourgeois society. The chosen victim of a homogeneous militant so- ciety, he has been thrown into the ditch while the community marches on; to Genet, too, failure and impotence have revealed soli- tude, he knows that bourgeois history will condemn him forever. He is alone because he continues to uphold the principles which condemn him in the same way that Bukharin, to the end, upholds the revo- lutionary principles in the name of which he will be executed. "Since the Marxist accused are . . . agreed with the prosecution on the principle of historical responsibility, they become their</page><page sequence="19">CONTEMPORARY FRENCH PHILOSOPHERS 331 own prosecutors; in order to discover their subjective integrity, we have to see through not only the indictment, but also their own statements." This sentence of Merleau-Ponty can be applied word for word to Genet: Since he is in agreement with the tribunal on the sacred value of private property, he becomes his own pros- ecutor in the name of the fundamental principle of the bourgeoisie which casts him out. In short, like Bukharin, he discovers his subjectivity by judging himself on the basis of the objective maxims of the society. Both of them confess: Once their confessions are signed, Bukharin will be forever a traitor and Genet forever a scoundrel. But Bukharin confesses to his treason in humility while Genet takes pride in his treason. Of course Bukharin cannot completely destroy this subjectivity which he discovers in failure and con- demns with his judges: "If he does not believe in personal honor, he upholds his revolutionary honor and rejects the accusation of espionage and sabotage." On the eve of his death, he is still busy contriving his defeat; this pure nothingness which cannot annihi- late itself attempts to the end to make the impossibility to live livable. But Genet has to deal with another society which has other myths and other customs. Since the bourgeois society grants the right to live to everyone, it is this right that he claims. The rotten member of a revolutionary community, Bukharin continues to say he is a revolutionist; the black sheep of a "liberal" society, Genet, in the name of liberalism, claims the right to live for the monster that he has become. This means that he persists in his failure, in his anomalies, exalts his exile and, since he is reduced to nothingness, makes himself the proud consciousness of being nothing. . . . He is put in the pillory and the Righteous spit in his face and enumerate his wrongs. But, unlike Bukharin, he proclaims for everyone to hear that he is right in being wrong. All by himself he approves of himself; he knows that his opinion is not enough and he maintains this opinion because of its in- sufficiency: He takes pride in being right in the impossible and in bearing witness, in the eyes of all, to the impossibility of every- thing. Now do you understand who Genet is? Remember this word of Merleau-Ponty about Bukharin which has shocked so many people: "Every opposition is treason, but every treason is but opposition." You who do not uphold the principles of the Soviet society, call Bukharin a vanquished opponent and you are in- dignant when they call him a traitor. In return, why don't you allow those who do not believe in your principles to call this horrible Genet a vanquished opponent of bourgeois society? I know that you feel a sincere disgust. But do you think that the</page><page sequence="20">332 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY faithful Communist and the Stakhanovist do not feel a sincere disgust for Bukharin? In any society, the culprit is alone and the man who is alone is guilty; there is no other way to assume solitude than to claim a fault and, consequently, to become an object of disgust. For solitude is the social bond itself when it is lived in despair, it is the negative relation between each one and all. The origin of Genet is a blunder-a contraceptive would have prevented Genet from ever existing-then refusal-someone re- jected the hated consequence of this blunder-then a failure-the child was not able to become integrated into the milieu which received him. A blunder, a refusal, a failure, all this makes up a No. The objective essence of the child was a No, and Genet gave himself a personality by giving himself the subjectivity of the No. He is the absolute opponent because he opposes Being and every integration. A taboo object for all, he makes himself a sacred subject for himself, and the subjectivity that he claims is the proud interiorization of a pure objective being-there-under-the- glance. A mere thing-which Bukharin will be only because of his confession and of the death that follows it-a thing which, be- cause it is a thing, cannot be assimilated by a society of subjects- objects, that is what Genet is originally and his subjectivity is but the interiorization of his "thingness" as separating inertness.... An inertness which is lived and acted out of bravado by the cul- prit, an extremely active and anxious consciousness which makes itself passive, such is the singular person of Genet. But this is also his universality: Robbery, homosexuality, treason, as con- tents of this singular essence, come afterwards: "The first thing is to be guilty," that is to say an object for all. In claiming abso- lute objectivity, Genet ceases to be a particular opponent in an historical society: He realizes for everyone the pure form of oppo- sition reduced to impotence. For everyone: for you and for me, for every reader. For we all are at the same time triumphant con- formists and vanquished opponents. At the bottom of our hearts we all conceal a scandalous break which, if it were known, would suddenly change us into an object of disapproval. When we are isolated, blamed for our failures, especially in trifling circum- stances, we all know the anxiety of being wrong and of not being able to consider ourselves wrong, of being right and of not being able to consider ourselves right. All of us oscillate between the temptation of preferring ourselves to everything else, because our consciousness is for us the center of the world, and the temp- tation to prefer everything to our conscience. We have all lost a discussion, we have built "whirligigs," forged sophisms in order to delay the moment of "objective defeat" when we already knew</page><page sequence="21">CONTEMPORARY FRENCH PHILOSOPHERS 333 in the secret of our heart that we were beaten, and in order to maintain a little longer our error, this nothingness, against the dazzling plenitude of evidence. Thus we have been kings of shadows and illusions; for it is extremely difficult for conscience, which is in essence self-approval, to conceive its errors and its death. In an article of La Table Ronde, Thierry Maulnier speaks about "one of the strangest, most abject inventions of our time, these Chinese accusation meetings in which the people of a town or of a village revel in the anguish, the remorse, the pallor, and the sweat of the accused and condemn them by a show of hands in anonymity, irresponsibility, and supreme cowardice, love to see the verdict manifest itself on the faces of the condemned, follow them to the place of execution and watch them die with shrieks of joy, of mockery and insult." This is, indeed, abject. But why "Chinese "? Or else, we are all Chinese, without knowing it, both Chinese victims and Chinese executioners, for I see in these meetings the image of our condition: We accuse with everybody and we are, at the same time, alone and accused by all. Since the social relation is ambiguous and always contains some failure, since we are at once the Chinese crowd who laugh and the terrified Chinese who is being led to his death, since every thought divides as much as it unites, since every word brings together because of what it expresses and isolates because of what it leaves out, since an unbridgeable g-ulf separates the subjective certainty which we have of our self and the objective truth that we are for the others, since we judge ourselves guilty even when we feel innocent, since the event transforms our best intentions into criminal intents not only in history but even in family life, since we are never sure of not becoming traitors in retrospect, since we unceasingly fail to com- municate, to love, to be loved, since every failure makes us experi- ence our solitude, since we sometimes dream of erasing our crim- inal singularity by humbly confessing it and sometimes of affirming it challengingly in the vain hope of assuming it whole, since we are conformists in daylight, vanquished and wicked in the secret of our souls, since the only resort for the culprit and his only dignity are stubbornness, sulkiness, bad faith, and resentment, since we cannot escape from the objectivity which crushes us nor reject this subjectivity which makes exiles out of us, since we cannot rise to being nor disappear in non-being, since we are anyhow impossible nonentities, we must listen to the voice of Genet, our neighbor, our brother. He carries to the extreme this latent soli- tude, this masked solitude of ours, he inflates our sophistry till it bursts, he magnifies our failures until they become catastrophic, he exaggerates our bad faith so as to make it intolerable,</page><page sequence="22">334 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY he brings our guilt into broad daylight. Of course, whatever society succeeds ours, his readers will always say he is wrong because he opposes every society; but that is precisely why we are his brothers; for our time has a bad conscience as it faces history. There have been more criminal times, but they did not care about posterity; and others made history with a peaceful conscience. Then, men did not feel cut off from the future, it seemed to them that they were creating it and that their children would agree with them; the sequence of generations was but one milieu in which they felt at ease. Today, revolutions are impos- sible, the most bloody and inept war threatens us, the privileged classes no longer believe in their rights, and the working class is in retreat. More than ever, we have a clear vision of injustice and we have neither the means nor the will to erase it. At the same time, the rapid progress of science bestows an obsessing pres- ence on the coming centuries; the future is here, more present than the present: Men will go to the moon, they will perhaps create life. These masked men who will come after us and who will have about everything a knowledge that we can hardly en- vision: we feel judged by them. For these future eyes whose glance obsesses us, our time will be an object. And a guilty ob- ject. They make us feel our failure and our guilt. Our time is already dead, already a thing, when we still have to live it; our time is alone in history and this historical solitude influences even our perceptions: What we see will disappear; people will laugh at our ignorance, they will be indignant at our faults. What resort is left to us? I see one which I shall present elsewhere; but the choice that is commonly made is to settle in this moment of history and to will it against everything with the stubbornness of the vanquished. We invent sophisms to maintain principles which we know are about to disappear and truths whch we know are going to become errors. That is why Genet the sophist is one of the heroes of our time. He is pilloried under the glance of the future; the Righteous will always condemn him and History will always condemn our time. We are Genet; that is why we should read him. Of course, he wants to accuse us of crimes which we never committed, which we have not even dreamed of committing. But does it matter? Just wait; if you are accused, the technique has been perfected, you will make a complete confession. Therefore, you will be guilty. There will be only one choice left to you: to be Bukharin or Genet. Bukharin or our will to be together carried to martyrdom; Genet or our solitude carried to Passion. If we keep the hope and the firm resolution to avoid this alter- native, if it is still time, through a last effort, to reconcile the object</page><page sequence="23">CONTEMPORARY FRENCH PHILOSOPHERS 335 and the subject, we must, be it only once and in imagination, realize this latent solitude which gnaws at our actions, at our thoughts. We spend our time fleeing away from the objective into the subjective and from the subjective into the objective. This game of hide and seek will end only when we have the courage to go to the limits of ourselves in both directions. I have tried to reveal the subject, the culprit, this wretched monster that we may become at any moment. Genet holds a mirror to us; let us look at ourselves. BACHELARD ON POETIC AND SCIENTIFIC MATERIALISM It is as a philosopher of science that Gaston Bachelard wishes to be recognized. Yet the field in which his influence is most con- spicuous at present is literary criticism, and his best-known works are those in which he deals with poetic imagination, or, as he calls it, material imagination. As he was engaged in research on the origins of the modern scientific spirit, Bachelard became interested in pre-scientific liter- ature, especially alchemy. His interest, at first, was purely nega- tive. In La Psychanalyse du feu, he shows that modern chemistry was born when fire, air, water ceased to be considered as basic elements of nature. Scientific experimentation then effected a clean break from concrete experience, and scientific rationality from philosophical "rationalism" or empiricism. Accordingly, Bache- lard presents the statements of prescientific literature as errors. The literature on fire does not tell us anything about the objective natural structure; it tells us something about the more or less un- conscious desires of the author. It contains imaginative projections and as such is of interest to the psychoanalyst, who alone can re- veal the "truth" inherent in these texts. It is rather odd that a man who is so keenly aware of the split between the scientific and the pre-scientific mind should be so uncritical of psychoanalysis. However, with the second book of the series, L 'Eau et les reves (Corti, 1942), Bachelard adopts a less trusting attitude toward Freudian dogma. But it is more im- portant to note that in this book and those which follow (on air and on earth), the over-all perspective has changed (this change was already announced at the end of La Psychanalyse du feu). Bachelard's interest in the literature of the material elements has become positive. What was considered scientific error is now considered as poetic expansion. The texts which Bachelard ex- amines are more often taken from literary works, especially poems,</page><page sequence="24">336 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY than from pre-scientific treatises. For Bachelard has recognized the importance of the fact that, if air, fire, and water have ceased to be, scientific objects, they have not ceased to be perceived and felt, nor have they ceased to serve as fundamental symbols for our imagination. As a matter of fact, the rise of Romanticism may be partly attributable to the advent of modern chemistry. The Ro- mantic, more particularly the poet, was implicitly entrusted with resurrecting in poetry what science had shattered: the world of earth, air, fire, and water; for this was the world in which lived, if not the man of knowledge, at least the man of perception, of sensibility and imagination, the world in which he could see and realize himself symbolically. The following paragraphs, taken from L 'Eau et les reves, illus- trate Bachelard's new approach. . . .two imaginations might be distinguished: an imagination which brings life to the formal cause and imagination which brings life to the material cause, or more briefly, formal imagination and material imagination. These two concepts seem to us indis- pensable for a comprehensive philosophical examination of poetic creation. When we started thinking about the notion of material beauty, we were struck by the fact that the material cause was ignored by esthetic philosophers. It seemed to us, in particular, that the in- dividualizing power of matter was underestimated. Why is the notion of the individual always attached to the notion of form? Is there not an individuality in depth corresponding to the fact that matter, in its smallest fragments, is always a totality? If it is considered in its depth, a matter is the principle which can remain unconcerned with forms. It is not the mere lack of formal activity. It remains itself in spite of deformations and divisions. Matter can be valorized in two directions: upward and downward. . . . In both cases, a material meditation educates an open imagina- tion. Generally speaking, we think that the psychology of esthetic emotions would profit by studying the zone of material reveries which precedes contemplation. Dream comes before contempla- tion. Before it is a conscious spectacle, every landscape is an oneiric experience. We feel an esthetic passion only for the land- scapes that we have already dreamed. And it is with reason that</page><page sequence="25">CONTEMPORARY FRENCH PHILOSOPHERS 337 Tieck has seen in human dreams the preamble to natural beauty. The unity of a landscape is offered as the fulfilment of an oft dreamt dream, "wie die Erfuillung eines oft getriiumten Traums" (L. Tieck, Werke, V, 10). But the oneiric landscape is not a frame to be filled with impressions, it is teeming matter. It is therefore understandable that to a material element like fire may be attached a type of reverie which conditions the beliefs, the passions, the ideal, and the philosophy of a whole life. It is not meaningless to speak of the esthetics of fire, of the psychology of fire, and even of the morals of fire. A poetics and a philosophy of fire condense all these lessons. Together they constitute this prodigious ambivalent learning which supports the convictions of the heart with the lessons of reality and which, in return, permits us to understand the life of the universe with the life of our heart. The other elements provide us with similar ambivalent cer- tainties. They suggest secret confidences and show dazzling images. Each of them has its faithful, or, more exactly, each of them is already, in its material depth, a system of poetic fidelity. After completing his series of studies on material imagination and poetic expression, Bachelard returned to the philosophy of sci- ence. In the first chapter of his latest work, Le Materialisme rationnel (P.U.F., 1953), extracts of which are translated below, he examines the dynamic union, in science, between rationalism and materialism. He takes advantage of this opportunity to criticize the traditional abstract "rationalism" of philosophers and its concept of "matter." Now he himself in his works on material imagination used the concept of matter in an unscientific way. But, unlike the traditional philosopher, he did not consider this concept as intellectually valid, as "true." He recognized the value of this concept in relation to symbolic self-realization, to the joyful health of our sensitive and imaginative being. Bachelard is thus led to speak of a "dual situation": experi- ence, imagination, poetry, on the one hand; experiment, intellect, science, on the other. Unlike some Romantic totalitarians, he will not allow poetic joy to pass for scientific truth. Unlike some positivistic totalitarians, he will not allow scientific knowledge to pass for all that should matter to us. The lesson to be drawn from Bachelard seems to be this: At a time when, in France at least, philosophy is almost cleanly split between the philosophers of literature and the philosophers of sci- ence, the essential mission of the philosopher may be to understand both the scientific and poetic activities in their positivity so as to</page><page sequence="26">338 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY keep in check obscurantism on the one hand, dehumanization on the other. I have just lived for twelve years all the circumstances of the division of materialism between imagination and experiment. This division, which is so obvious in the facts, has gradually appeared to me as a methodological principle. It led me to become conscious of a radical opposition between an imaginary materialism and an educated materialism. In other words, it is important, in my opinion, to classify the elements of human conviction under two headings: conviction through dreams and images, conviction through reason and experiment. Matter brings us quasi-immediate convictions which are associ- ated with invincible reveries deeply rooted in our unconscious. Precise experiments, well-established in an inter-material technique, in a technique which transforms material properties, are necessary to approach, in second position, the phenomenology of educated materialism. In Le Rationalisme appliqtue, we have devoted a whole chapter to the break of knowledge into common experience and scientific experiment. A similar, but more difficult, break must be effected in materialism in order to make clear how dis- cursive and progressive materialism pulls away from naive ma- terialism; in other words, we must show how ordered materialism, which started from realistic security, meets rationalistic certainties. Only the painstaking work of scientific thought and experiment can bring together realism and rationalism. We shall thus have to reopen the debate between the thesis of the continuity of knowledge and the thesis of the rectification of knowledge. The main thing, for the moment, is clearly to indicate that educated materialism is grounded in a dialectics which radically separates it from imagi- nary materialism. If we consider scientific culture, we can see a rather brutal material psychoanalysis in action, which must be distinguished from the existential psychoanalysis which Sartre proposes in the last pages of L'Etre et le neant. It is because the psychoanalysis which we are considering is brutal, surgical, it is because it cleanly sepa- rates unconscious convictions from rational convictions, that the scientist does not study it. For a man of science it is always obvious that you are not dreaming since you are working. A philosopher of culture cannot be so summary. And we must un- ceasingly perfect the division between a primitivistic materialism and a cultured materialism. The purity of a rationalistic ma- terialism depends on this.</page><page sequence="27">CONTEMPORARY FRENCH PHILOSOPHERS 339 On the other hand, as long as we remain in the domain of a systematically original experience, as Sartre does in accordance with the existentialist position, we can but try to psychoanalyze an original material preference which clogs existence, by proposing an- other type of reference, by orienting the existential commitment in another direction. We shall soften an arid being by suggesting to him the softness of water. We shall liberate a soul caught in the viscosity of its cosmos by suggesting kneading tasks (see La Terre et les r6veries de la volonte6, chapter IV). A material psycho- analysis can thus help us recover from our images, or at least help us curb the sway of our images. The goal of our systematic study of the imagination of the elements has been to make the imagination happy, in other words, to give a good conscience to imagination by granting it all its means of expression, all the material images which occur in natural dreams, in normal oneiric activity. To make the imagination happy, to grant it all its exuberance, is to give imagination its true function of psychological training. The problems of materialism will be posited all the more clearly as we more frankly establish a total separation between rational life and oneiric life, in accepting a double life, that of the nocturnal man and that of the diurnal man, the dual basis of a complete anthropology. Once the division between imagination and reason is established, there appears more clearly the problem of a dual situation of the human mind. We face the problem of a dual situation when, on the basis of numerous and precise examples, we study the relations between the realm of images and the realm of ideas. Of course this dual situation is never completely assumed, and it is seldom balanced in the inquiries of psychologists and episte- mologists. Oneirism and intellectualism are always rather un- stable poles in the examiner as well as in the examined. In the pursuit of our dual work, we have never managed to see the two situations in equally deep perspectives. All depends on whether the problem concerns the esthetics of language or the rationaliza- tion of experience. But, even in their proper domains, the oneiric and intellectual values remain in conflict. They often affirm them- selves in this very conflict. We perceive the institution of an order which is both real and rational when we consider the break of modern science with the old ideal of a "natural history" which still governed pedagogy in the eighteenth century, when the mineral kingdom was studied as a third kingdom in close correspondence with the animal and vege- table kingdoms. The numerous books then published under the</page><page sequence="28">340 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY name of Mattieres medicales correspond to a sort of homogeneity of nature. On the contrary, for a modern chemist, the mineral king- dom does not stretch before him, always open to a simple inquiry: The mineral world presents itself with a humtan depth. It is the object not only of a "natural" history, but of a "human" history. In order to study the mineral kingdom, it is now necessary to pro- fess artificiality. A hundred years ago, the great chemist Auguste Laurent already said: "Today chemistry has become the science of bodies which do not exist." The chemist must bring to life bodies which do not exist. As for those which exist, the chemist must somehow remake them in order to give them a sufficient purity, in order to put them on a par of artificiality with those which have been created by man. The chemist thinks and works on the basis of a re-invented world. We shall dwell at greater length on this essential artificiality, but right now we must confess that to say of a chemical phenomenon that it is a natttral phe- nomenon is an abuse of words. Artificial materialism, scientific chemistry, the rationalism of inter-material laws, have thrown on the mineral kingdom a net of relations which are not found in nature. Man has determined innumerable mineral crossings. If we rid it of its naive materialism, if we psychoanalyze it, we can say that the old concept of the alchemical marriage has sealed the union of innumerable elements. This creativity is a fundamental characteristic of educated materialism. It is the sign of what we call orderly materialism. Here, human activity increases the order of nature, creates order, erases natural disorder. Man is man because of his power of culture. His nature con- sists in being able to break away from nature through culture and give reality to artificiality within himself and without. The enormous mass of nature in disorder as against the small number of man-made phenomena cannot serve as an argument to prove the superiority of the natural over the cultural. On the contrary, con- temporary science which grows and creates on the basis of the huge natural chaos gives its full meaning to the power of ordering which is latent in the phenomena of life. Let us adopt the point of view of the chemist. The earth now is very poor in chemical phenomena. Of course we walk on sulphides and oxydes, we inhabit carbonates. But the minerals belong to history, to a distant history, they are the results of an inter-material activity which has stopped. In this respect, natural minerals are, if one may say so, the fossils of scientific thought. The inanimate world is almost destitute of inter-material</page><page sequence="29">CONTEMPORARY FRENCH PHILOSOPHERS 341 phenomena. It takes lightning to make ozone. It takes a volcano to prove that the laboratory of the earth is still active. But all this cosmic chemistry is irregular. When books speak of them so as to arouse an interest in science, such phenomena become the pretext of a grandiloquent chemistry without much cultural value. On the other hand, when contemporary science wants to learn about the phenomena of stellar chemistry, about cosmic rays, when it thus meets the laboratory of nature, it has first to go through a long preamble of technical studies made in the laboratories of the sci- entific city. In chemistry the natural phenomenon is no longer very instructive in a direct manner. It is the phenomena of life that have somehow re-introduced chemical phenomena on our planet, which is plunged in a material slumber and has become chemically inert. A plant is a distilling machine, a stomach is a retort. With living beings, it seems that nature tries its hand at artificiality. Life distills and filters. The green planet, forests and meadows, do photochemistry; they chemi- cally absorb the energy of the sun. But all these pre-human phe- nomena are left behind when man reaches the cultural stage. The real working principle of an active materialism is man himself, rationalistic man. Using for once an obsolete type of expression, we would say: When it wanted to do some real chemistry, Nature invented the chemist. In this perspective, life appears to go beyond natural chemical phenomena in that it institutes a first order of artificiality; it some- times realizes chemical phenomena which did not take place in pre- vital combinations. And then, a second order of artificiality ap- pears: the rationalistic activity of the chemist who does something else than life had done, who operates otherwise than nature in the order of the creation of substances. Those are but philosophical views. They are at least the views of a philosopher who does his job in his chosen domain, which is to designate as objectively as possible the hierarchy of cultural values. But the philosopher is not as isolated as one might think. The history of chemistry is not lacking in scientists who have de- fined their science as a science of the radical transformation of natural substances. A hundred years ago, a great chemist, Charles Gerhardt, did not hesitate to define chemical reality by this radical transformation. For him, chemical bodies are those which "are born from being dissimilar." Living bodies have a more monoto- nous destiny: They reprodtce themselves. They can give birth only to beings similar to them. They illustrate only a partial</page><page sequence="30">342 TUE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY chemistry, much less variational than the rationalistic chemistry of the contemporary chemist. It was necessary, in our introduction, to present this pro- ductivity as a fundamental characteristic of materialism. We shall constantly encounter the same philosophical paradox: It is through an increase in the number of substances that the material order can be instituted with increased rationality. The traditional philo- sophical bent would entice us to place the source of the coherence of the doctrines in the unity of matter. It lies in fact in an orderly complexity. Thus, if we follow the discursive work of science, we become aware of a teeming pluralism of material transformations; the various created matters are reasons to increase the basic pluralism, so that this basic pluralism grows with the pluralism which we find at the top.... It follows that the problem of the unity of matter with which philosophers have been so much concerned can no longer be con- sidered as a first problem. It is rather a last problem. Modern science shows the pointlessness of the philosophical solutions which have been proposed. It seems that the problem of the unity of matter presents itself in ever-renewed terms at the various stages of scientific progress. Each generation understands, in a recurring manner, that the problem of the unity of matter was incorrectly formulated by the previous generation. RUYER ON FINALITY Sartre 's existentialism is a philosophy of consciousness and conscience. Bachelard's dual materialism is concerned with poetic and scientific invention. Raymond Ruyer is a philosopher of life in the Bergsonian tradition. What links the three philosophers and what dominates French philosophy at present is an activistic bent. The emphasis on action has ousted the traditional emphasis on contemplation: social action with Sartre, poetic and scientific construction with Bachelard, activity in general with Ruyer. In reading Ruyer especially, one may come to the conclusion that if the goal of philosophy is understanding (as distinct from know- ing), then its proper material is activities as such. Does not under- standing, in the full sense of the word, consist in interpreting phenomena as elerments of an active pattern? The first chapter of Neo-finalisme (PUF, 1952) is devoted to the presentation of the "axiological cogito," which Ruyer consid-</page><page sequence="31">CONTEMPORARY FRENCH PHILOSOPHERS 343 ers as a logically more valid starting-point than the ontological cogito of Descartes. The problem of the "existence of God" together with the problem of the "attributes of God" is now outmoded. The form of this problem is vitiated by an unfortunate contamination of philosophy by religion, and by a religion which is still primitive. As happens with many religious or semi-religious notions, the spontaneous question today is no longer "Is it true?" but "What does it mean?" The substitution of a problem of meaning for a problem of existence is characteristic. In fact, authentic atheism is much less defined by a disbelief in a being named God than by a disbelief in a meaning of the universe. It is clearly a gain to state a problem of meaning rather than a problem of existence. Even those who are inclined to answer negatively have at least the impression that they know what they deny, whereas, in the case of the traditional questions, to quote Samuel Butler, the war between the theist and the atheist seems to be caused by the question of whether God should be called "God" or by another name. The parallelism between the problem of God and the problem of meaning can also be observed between the kinds of arguments. The a priori, or ontological, argument becomes, in the order of Meaning, the axiological " cogito. " As the ontological argument claims to prove that it is contra- dictory to deny the existence of God, so the axiological cogito at- tempts to show that it is contradictory to deny radically finality and meaning in general. But while the ontological argument, in many of its classical forms, appears a crude sophism, the axiologi- cal cogito is perfectly irrefutable. It is quite evident that at least one being in the universe " offers" a meaning: man. Not man in general, but each man, each "I", when he is the speaking or acting subject. Each of us may be inclined to think that the others are "absurd" and to lend a favorable ear to the numerous ingenious systems which consider men as puppets driven by pure causes. But only a few perverse speculative minds can pretend not to remove their "speaking person" from the reach of such systems. It is quite clear that to affirm in general that every action is a mere effect of causes and has neither end nor meaning is to talk nonsense, exactly like some lunatics who say: "I am dead," or: "I do not exist." For, the</page><page sequence="32">344 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY one who affirms something affirms it as true, thus confessing that he was looking for truth, which is fundamentally incompatible with the fact of being merely driven by causes. Let us give a few examples. (a) A strict dogmatic behaviorist, who does not think of be- haviorism as just a provisional method, maintains that the behavior of human beings, including himself, can always be described in terms of responses to stimuli, and that the connection between stimulus and response, however complicated it may be by inter- mediary mechanisms, always retains the character of a causal chain and proceeds step by step in strict conformity with a causality of a mechanical type. But if, according to the hypothesis, the words of the behaviorist are mere responses to stimuli, how and by what right does he think that he is correct rather than his adversaries, those who are still steeped in "magic and superstition'"? His responses, like the reddening litmus-paper, are real facts. But "fact" is not synonymous with "true proposition," and the re- sponses of his opponents are facts just as much as his own. Why should the value of truth be attached to the ones rather than to the others? Let us suppose that to a behaviorist defending his sys- tem, someone replies rudely: "What you are saying is meaning- less." The behaviorist will probably be offended. Yet his critic is only applying the very thesis of the man whom he criticizes. If, on the other hand, an admirer exclaims: "You are right, how true this is!" his approval is a refutation: A mere effect can be neither right nor wrong. Pure "causalistic" doctrines are refuted by approval as well as by criticism, whereas the doctrine of "mean- ing" is confirmed by denial as well as by approval. (b) Kohler pokes fun at the behavioristic thesis and at associa- tionism in general, and wishes ironically that it were true. For, he says, "I have promised a New York publisher to send him in a few months the manuscript of this work. I must write it in English and my mother-tongue is German. What a pity that I cannot let my responses to stimuli take their course." In fact he experiences an unpleasant feeling before the difficulties of his task, "an obscure pressure which tends to turn into the feeling of being trapped. " His thesis, the well-known thesis of Gestalt psychology, is that an action is of a dynamic, not mechanical, nature, that the psycho- logical tension of the task, of the end to be achieved, corresponds to a dynamic tension on the physiological plane. The order of the acts in time and space "is a faithful representation of a corre- sponding concrete order in the underlying dynamic context." The Gestaltist thesis sounds better than the behavioristic or</page><page sequence="33">CONTEMPORARY FRENCII PHILOSOPHERS 345 mechanistic theses. It seems to do fuller justice to the reality of the tension, of the oriented effort. But, philosophically, it is no better. If the writing of his manuscript really corresponds to the establishment of an equilibrium in his "underlying physiological context," I do not see why K6hler should be more concerned than if he just had to let responses to stimuli take their course. Once he has finished writing, the author would have merely reached a more pleasant state of relaxation, without the inner "obscure pressure." Of course, he would reply that this relaxation will be reached only if the task has not only been finished, but carried out successfully in his eyes. All right, but then it is clear that we are no longer dealing with mere dynamism and that, in the end, if the task is successful, there is a coincidence not with a state of equilibrium, but with an ideal, and that the preliminary activity had a mean- ing, not only like a vector in physics, but also as a conscious in- tention. (c) To cut matters short, let us introduce together several other supporters of the general thesis which claims to explain human activities by impulses a tergo and not by an effort to con- form to norms: a mechanistic biologist, an old-fashioned psychia- trist who recognizes only physiological troubles, a Freudian psycho- analyst, an Adlerian, a Marxist sociologist, and a disciple of Pareto. Let us suppose that they have all been listening to a man who was expressing with abnormal earnestness his political opinions to a friend. The psychiatrist: "This man is having a hypomaniacal fit." The Freudian: "This distrust of authority reveals an infantile hatred of the father." The Adlerian: "For what inferiority.is he trying to compen- sate ? " The disciple of Pareto: " What are the 'residues' under the verbal 'derivations ' ? " The Marxist: "What class interest is he expressing? He is a bourgeois intellectual going through his pseudo-democratic phase." The disciple of Rabaud: "This is merely caused by an upset metabolism, perhaps by a calcium deficiency." All of these interpretations are of some interest as long as they are only meant to define what perturbs a fundamentally autono- mous activity, an activity which tries to be faithful to an order of truth or of ideal validity. . . . If the learned interpretations claim to be self-sufficient and to do away with the simple question of knowing whether the speaker is right or not, whether the spoken words have a meaning or not, they become absurd. First of all, they contradict each other. The political opinions of X cannot be</page><page sequence="34">346 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY explained at the same time by his physiology, his infantile com- plexes, his libido, and his class interests. The learned diag- nosticians might of course reach a compromise and build a parallelogram of forces whose resultant would be the behavior of the subject. But the curious quarrels which occur, for example, be- tween psychoanalysts and Marxists show that such a compromise is hardly possible and that each one, by claiming to explain every- thing, contradicts all the others. If the materialist or the psycho- analyst searches for the real causes of human actions with a heroic concern for truth, these doctrines become at once valid, but they have to renounce their totalitarian pretensions. They are only conltributions to truth. Their supporters can then say with Max Weber: "Truth is the only thing that is true." The axiological form of the cogito, as is well known, has been discovered by Lequier in a different light, or at least in an apparently different light, that of freedom: "I am looking for a first truth, therefore I am free. Freedom is the first truth which I was looking for, because the search for knowledge implies freedom as the positive condition of the search." The structure of the argument is the same. At bottom, even the content is the same, because the freedom which is thus discovered is correlated to end and meaning. Freedom consists in working toward an end ac- cording to a norm (in this case, the rule of the search for truth). It is synonymous with "finalistic activity," not with "freewill," or pure " spontaneity," or " unforeseeability, " or " absolute ex- istential freedom. " It is not incompatible with any motivation but only with a causality a tergo. Renouvier has systematized the argument of Lequier by de- veloping a seiltence of the latter: "Two hypotheses: freedom or necessity. A choice to be made between olle and the other, with olne or the other," and by complicating it with the notion of a morally superior choice, in accordance with practical reason. We shall leave these complications aside and we shall borrow from Renouvier only the form of the double dilemnta. Renouvier says: " Lequier has shown that the choice required by the alternative 'necessity or freedom,' if it is considered in the determination of the philosopher 's consciousness, depends on the same alternative considered in re, or as concerns the external truth of the thing.' There are only four possible hypotheses: (1) Being determined, I affirm my determinism. (2) Being free, I affirm my determinism. (3) Being determined, I affirm my freedom. (4) Being free, I affirm my freedom.</page><page sequence="35">CONTEMPORARY FRENCH PHILOSOPHERS 347 Hypotheses 1 and 3 should be discarded as having no possible value of truth, since my affirmation has but the appearance of an assertion: It is the effect of a pure cause a tergo, by hypothesis. There remain 2 and 4. In both cases, my affirmation has a mean- ing and deserves to be taken into consideration. But, in the same way that the Cartesian doubt is identical with the certainty of existing, if I affirm my determinism as a truth, this affirmation amounts to saying that I have searched for the truth. And a quest has to be free. The affirmation and negation of freedom amount to the same; the negation of freedom, in words or in my philo- sophical consciousness, amounts to affirming it in re. It is obvious that the strength of the double dilemma is borrowed from Lequier's argument. The complexity of the Renouvierist form is not without danger. It may make an irrefutable argument look like a sophism. It is easy to caricature the argument. For example, let us try to prove my infallibility, instead of my freedom. The hypotheses become: (1) Being fallible (in fact), I affirm my fallibility. (2) Being infallible (in fact), I affirm my fallibility. (3) Being fallible (in fact), I affirm my infallibility. (4) Being infallible (in fact), I affirm my infallibility. (1) and (3) should be discarded: Since I am fallible in fact, what I say does not count. There remain (2) and (4). But (2) is contradictory. There remains (4): Q.E.D. This is of course just a caricature. Fallibility does not absolutely disqualify my assertions, as determinism does. The contradiction in (2) shows that the affirmation of infallibility implies a logical contradiction, and it is this contradiction that must be eliminated. What gives the double dilemma its sophistic aspect, even in its legitimate applications, is that the formulations of the alterna- tive in re, or, as Renouvier says, "as concerns the external truth of the thing," are already philosophical formulations, wvritten or spoken, which imply choices of hypotheses, not real facts that would be given. "The hypothesis that x is a fact" is not equivalent to "x (as given fact). " When I read, in the double dilemma: "Being determined, I affirm . . " or " Being free, I affirm . . the argument seems to say: "'Determined in fact " or "Free in fact." But, since we are dealing with an argument which I formulate, the would-be fact is itself dependent on a hypothesis, on an uncertain judgment. What proves it is that, in the end, I shall reject the would-be fact of determinism. The formulation of the hypothesis concerning the fact should thus</page><page sequence="36">348 T7HE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY explicitly appear in a first position, even more fundamental than the alternative in re: 1 2 3 I suppose that determined in fact I affirm determinism I suppose that free in fact I affirm determinism etc. Which shows that the would-be facts are lnot facts. The double dilemma places itself in the bad situation of the traditional ontologi- cal argument which supposes the idea of the perfect Being before noting that perfection implies existence. Therefore it also sup- poses existence and does not prove it, since it supposes the idea of perfection, which is supposed to contain existence in re: 1 2 3 I suppose the idea of perfection anid this idea implies the existence in re of perfection. The "fact," the truth in re, is found here in third position, whereas it is in second position in Renouvier's argument. But, in both cases, the "I suppose" prevents the fact from being takeln seriously in Renouvier 's argument as well as in the ontological argument. If the double dilemma of Renouvier is nonetheless valid, it is because the fundamental hypothesis itself (in first position), what- ever its contents, is already an express manifestation of freedom. To say "I suppose" is already to be free; it also shows that one is seeking for truth and that one already knows that there is a truth. So much complication can be reduced to the simple form of Lequier's argument. Every assertion, coming after a quest, what- ever its contents may be, implies the principle of truth, of "mean- ing," of existence as meaningful activity. Lequier's argument and the Cartesian cogito are identical arguments. They are valid only in their axiological bearing. Ruyer shows that the various formulations of the axiological cogito introduce notions which are linked by reciprocal impli- cations: existence (interpreted as the existence of an agent), freedom, activity, finality, value, meaning. Then he attempts to apply his activistic, or finalistic, scheme outside the domain of the human agent. He is of the opinion that the results of recent scientific research in physics and biology countenance this enter- prise, that only the use of finalistic patterns can make the known</page><page sequence="37">CONTEMPORARY FRENCH PIIILOSOPHERS 349 phenomena comprehensible. (It mray be argued that this was a foregone conclusion, if to make sense out of something, to under- stand somiiething, consists precisely in applying a finalistic pattern to the data, whatever they may be.) In the final chapter, extracts of which follow, Ruyer claims that it is legititmate to sutppose a certain unity between the various fields of finality, between the various agents. Thus we wottld re- tutrn to the Platonic notion of a cosmos. If, so far, Ruyer's Neo-finalisme has reminded us of Bergson's Evolution creatrice in scope, intent, and ingenuity, the final chapter, with its straight- forward introduction of a cosmological myth, reminds us of Plato's Timaeus. Ruyer's myth appears as a sort of Bergsonized Timaeus. It is a question whether Ruyer, in presenting his myth, does not confuse two things: on the one hand, existent patterns of activity, and on the other, the formal, abstract universality of the pattern. By way of a myth, Ruyer manages to avoid a choice between three notions which were distinct, nominally at least, in Plato: the divine, the God, and the gods. I was tempted to translate Dieu by the divine, which is the word which seems best to fit Ruyer's per- spective. But Dieu is God. So be it. The very situation of contemporary science invites us to turn from the problem of finality in the world to the problem of the finality of the world. Theories like psycho-Lamarekism, which recognize only an individual finality, do not satisfy us any more than theories which deny any finality. The finalistic activities are systematized. Every unified domain of action implies a meta- physical "transversal," but the multiple "transversals" of the various domains cannot be considered in isolation; they state the same general problem. Let us compare a few typical structures of unified domains: [I] endeavor to establish propositions in conformity with [truth]. [I] endeavor to recall a [mnemic theme1. [x] (an embryo) organizes itself actively according to its [specific type]. [x] (a living species) evolves actively toward a [harmonious type]. [x] (a molecule) actively maintains its [typical form]. The isomorphism between these various cases is hardly question- able. There is always [an agent] which endeavors to realize [an ideal]. On the basis of contemporary science, we have found</page><page sequence="38">350 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY that all the beings in the universe are domains of activity, of finalistic activity, in this general form. Only "collections," "crowds," are exceptions and degrade the finalistic activity into a mere evolution toward an extremal equilibrium: [A collectioln of x's] evolves passively toward a [Gestalt, or maximum entropy]. Science, because of its very nature, fully understands only this last case, a degraded one. As concerns the others, it studies, as much as possible exclusively, the various modes of work and activity in time and space, and systematically ignores the Agents as such and the Ideals as such. It tries to ignore internal con- nections and the meaning of the activities which it observes. Nonetheless, it teaches us direct lessons on the universality of finalistic action, on the variety of its modes and on their re- ciprocal implications. It also tells us something, indirectly, about the Agents and Ideals, for it cannot, in fact, separate physics from the metaphysical " transversal," as all the domains of activity are linked and unified only by their metaphysical component. Science calnnot understand the connections, yet it is compelled to take them into account. The task of metaphysics is dual: (a) It transforms scientific findings into a knowledge of the connections and of the meanings (but this metaphysics is partly made instinctively, and most often implicitly, by the scientists themselves, who cannot help being " realists") ; (b) As metaphysics proper, it studies the general status of what we have put between brackets and the relation between Agents and Ideals, or the relation between Agent and Ideal, since nothing permits us to affirm a priori the fundamental plurality of the one and of the other. This dual task must not be undertaken too soon, before scientific information, and with the pretension of directing this information. Many scientific errors occur because scientists resort too quickly to an implicit metaphysics (according to task a) and fall into a bad realism. Many metaphysical errors occur because the phi- losopher undertakes the second part of the task too early, thus prolonging the errors of the implicit metaphysics of science. We must and we can establish on the basis of scientific results that there is meaning and finality everywhere, before turning to the metaphysical problem of "I" or of "God," that is to say, of Meaning or of the Logos. The Cartesian system, as is well known, inverts the order. It begins with a metaphysics considered as preliminary to a physics. It ignores the axiological character of the cogito. It presents an ontology of the thinking substance on the</page><page sequence="39">CONTEMPORARY FRENCH PHILOSOPHERS 351 one hand, and of the Perfect, or of God, on the other, that is to say, of the two expressions which should have been put between brackets, since, unlike the "work of thought, " they do not represent im- mediate data. Of course, the "work of thought" is, in an immedi- ate way, not only here-now, but here-now-I. But the " I" of this threefold expression is not the ontological and essential "I" which Descartes thinks he discovers immediately; it is the Agent, or the Acting. With this correction, and after three centuries of immense sci- entific progress, we can turn to the metaphysical problem (task b), without, however, entertaining too great hopes. Every metaphysics in sense b, like every theology, is mythical. It is necessarily a "work of thought," which takes place in the actual, in what is not bracketed, while it pretends to place itself outside the total system which it tries to define. To build a metaphysics, whether it be dogmatic or critical, always consists in pretending to be God or the Witness of God, the absolute Totality deliberating with itself and confiding in us. In the Book of the Secrets of Enoch, a Jewish apocalypse of the Christian era, the patriarch is carried upwards by angels and in the seventh heaven sees God himself, who reveals to him the mysteries of Creation and deigns to tell him in detail how he operated during each of the six days. Every metaphysician, without recognizing it, uses the simple trick of the old Jewish author. This fiction is so unlikely that one might think the metaphysician should refrain from it and busy himself with other exercises. However, since the mystics have always believed in the identity of the "I" and the absolute, since pantheism supports a similar thesis, since Kantian criticism contains the seed of this idea, as is abundantly shown by its successors and heirs, since idealism, rationalism, in short, the most varied metaphysics postulate it; since, on the other hand, we do not know exactly what there is in the brackets on the left, hence what there is behind the "I" who speaks and deliberates, we cannot consider excluded a priori that the fiction contains some measure of truth and that, to this extent, metaphysics is possible. It is interesting that a physicist like Schr6dinger has been led to consider his "I" as "Atman." He does so in a questionable manner, and in order to remove a con- tradiction in which he trapped himself, but his example can serve at least as a justification for similar fictions. It is already some- thing not to be "naive" and to confess candidly at the start that these two propositions: "I believe in the possibility of a tran- scendent metaphysics " and "I believe that at bottom I am identical</page><page sequence="40">352 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY with God himself" cannot be dissociated and can be justified only together and to the same extent. *. *. ***.*. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . It is now time to come to the heart of the problem and to ac- count for the openly fictional character of our metaphysics. The internal arrangement of the universe is such that finalistic activity can be found everywhere: All beings are domains of activity, all "agents" aim at an ideal, or conform themselves to it in one way or another. Consequently, it matters little whether we conceive God after the model of the human agent, of the organic agent, or of the mineral agent. For, in any case, we would fall into a much more serious contradiction than any anthropomorphism. This contradiction is as follows. Let us suppose an external arrangement, by a transcendent God, of such a universe that there can be in it various modes of finalistic activity; is this arrangement itself a finalistic activity? If we answer "no, " it means that finality is not fundamental, that it is just a fact in the world and that there is no Logos, or Meaning, of the universe. If we answer "yes,"y we are reduced to an infinite regression. God is to the world in its entirety what any agent in the world is to his united domain and to his ideal. But what is the "ideal" of God? The fundamental unity of all the modes of finality makes the difficulty more obvious. If every finality implies agent, unified domain of work, ideal, the finality of the world, that is to say, the fact that it is arranged in such a way as to permit individual finalistic activities, must itself require agent, unified domain, ideal. God as the Meaning of meanings, or as End of the ends, is no more in- telligible than God as Cause of causes, or Being of beings. In both cases we are caught between an infinite regression and the negation of the concept which we wanted to carry to the second power-which seems to reduce the concept to a phantasm. Either the Meaning of meanings is devoid of meaning, or we have to find the meaning of the meaning of meanings, and so forth. N. Hartmann and the existentialists are wrong when they assert that human final- ity implies the non-finality of nature, its teleological neutrality; but, on the other hand, it seems unquestionable that the sum of the finalities which make up the totality of the world cannot be oriented toward an end-as if, after all, there were some measure of truth in the philosophy of the absurd. The solution of Whitehead-with whom we have so often been in accord-cannot be accepted. Whitehead divides God into an Ultimate which he calls "Creativity" and a "God" who is "its primordial, not temporal accident. " Either we are faced with the beginning of an infinite regression which a non-manichean</page><page sequence="41">CONTEMPORARY FRENCH PHILOSOPHERS 353 dualism tries to conceal, or, if the non-ultimate God of Whitehead is the equivalent of the "Ideal" of the acting world, as a lure, we are dealing with an incomplete solution. There is only one way of avoiding a contradiction. It is to identify God, not with a being or a meaning or an activity trans- cendent to the world, but with the two poles of all the finalistic activities whose sum makes up the world. God is thus supreme Agent as well as supreme Ideal; and "Creativity" cannot be distinct from a God who is indissolubly Agent and Ideal. As the world is made only of lines of activity, God is both the world and yet distinct from the world, for the multiplicity of activities plays, as we have seen, the role of a sort of opposition, the role of a matter, for each particular activity. It plays the role of a resist- ance to meaningful information, in the same way that a crowd is composed only of individuals and yet opposes each individual. The activity, the work which constitutes the whole "substance" of the world, according to contemporary science, cannot be dis- sociated from its two poles which are both immanent and tran- scendent. But can we speak of one Agent pole and of one Ideal pole, in spite of the myriads of centers of activities ? In other words, in all that is bracketed, is the Unattainable homogeneous too, and can we speak of it as one x? It seems so, for if we follow any line of activity in the "fibrous structure" of the universe, we find junctions with any other line. The unattainable x which is be- hind my "I", the Activity out of which my activity has sprung, is also the unattainable x of any other "I" or of any other living agent today. Reproduction by self-copying cannot be, as we have seen, analogous to a mechanical tracing; it implies an internal unity between two lines, at the moment when they fork out, in the same way that the fusion of two lines in fecundation produces one being who says"I" in spite of his two parents. The hypothesis of G. Lemaltre on the primordial atom can be true or false in the form which he gave it; but it shows at least that bifurcations in the life of the atom are not inconceivable. Even if this multiplication of micro-physical individuals were impossible in space-time, this would not mean that an unattaiinable unity of all the individuals, of all the "agents of matter," according to the expression of H. Weyl and Riezler, is impossible in the trans-spatial. Likewise, and symmetrically, though the demonstration is more difficult and can rest only on scientific likelihood, putting the word "Ideal" in the singular seems justified by the fundamental unity of all the Ideals. Mnemic themes are coo6rdinated in larger systems insofar as memory and invention are indiscernible. Similar ideas</page><page sequence="42">354 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY are numerically the same ideas. Millions of individuals can have the same ideal. In spite of the conflicts between values, the notion of a supreme Ideal is nonetheless less mythical than the image of a struggle between God and Satan, between Ormazd and Ahriman. The cosmological continuity of existences, like the comparative harmony of the ideals, can thus pass for the expression of some- thing deeper. If the x never begins to exist, if it cannot seize it- self as an object, it is because it is God. It is God who exists in each of us, as he subsists in each of the Ideals. We said that there was no free being, but there were only free activities. We can now modify this formula and say: There is only one free being, God in us, and we exist only through creating, that is to say, through working according to the order of the ideal, which is also God in the ideals. Thus God does not really create free beings or activities which would detach themselves from him: This was the mythical element, the cause of antinomies in our fiction, as in every crea- tionism. A free being cannot be created, it is "continued cre- ation,'" i.e., "continued God." The paradoxical existential de- pendence of the agent on his activity does not apply to God in us. Our soul makes itself by making our body and the tools which prolong our body. But the soul of our soul, to speak like the mystics, never has to make itself, because it is eternal and pro- duces time, like all the rest. As we survive the changes of the objects on which we work, as we can pass from one activity to an- other, though it is our activity which makes us exist, so God sur- vives the changes of bodies and souls. Our soul dies with our body, but the soul of our soul changes bodies and souls, as we can change the object of our activity. The metamorphoses of Zeus are the symbol of this truth: God takes us and leaves us as we can take and leave a work in progress, though we cannot really cease to act.</page></plain_text>
