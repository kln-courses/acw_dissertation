Much attention centred initially on Agamben's treatment of the ontology and politics of sovereignty in its intersection with a thinking of human 'life' within the metaphysical tradition. In other words, Agamben has largely been received as a thinker of the 'biopolitical'. The great strength of Catherine Mills's The Philosophy of Agamben is that it consistently sets this facet of Agamben's writing against the backdrop of his intellectual development and concerns over several decades. In this, however, she is not alone - even more recent studies such as Alex Murray's Giorgio Agamben and William Watkin's The Literary Agamben emphasize the extent to which understanding Agamben's philosophy of language is indispensable in approaching his work more broadly. Mills shows that central to Agamben's philosophical project is the desire to challenge and overcome the negative grounding of metaphysics. (Murray's book similarly begins with language and negativity as the starting point of Agamben's thought.) Accordingly, Agamben wants to think a new experience of language in excess of meaning and signification as a function of linguistic forms; that is to say, beyond a reduction of language to the sign, which itself presupposes Paragraph 34.1 (2011): 137-151 DOI: 10.3366/para.201 1.0010 Â© Edinburgh University Press www.eupjournals.com/para</page><page sequence="2">138 Paragraph originary loss (i.e., both the absence and transcendence of a signified). For Agamben, to reimagine the event of language otherwise is to rethink the metaphysical tradition at its origin. In Language and Death, via readings of Heidegger and Hegel in particular, Agamben therefore returns to the idea of man as a mortal, speaking being (one which, for him, leads to the very core of a metaphysics based on negativity, or in other words nihilism), so as to open thought to the possibility of another 'taking-place' of language. By way of following Benveniste, Agamben suggests that modern linguistics provides the opportunity to recast the philosophical project of explicating the 'I' as a living- speaking being. As Mills puts it: 'Pronouns such as "I" and "you" - along with adverbs and other adverbial locutions such as "here", "now" and "this" - do not indicate or refer to objects outside of themselves, but instead make evident the very taking place of language itself' (15). The event of speech when considered in this way puts in question the ontological condition of being as traditionally construed by metaphysics; that is, in terms of a structuring relation to negativity grounded on the scission of language (i.e., language interpreted in terms of the traditional conception of the sign). The simple 'fact' or 'having' of language which Agamben asks us to think thus seeks to move beyond a metaphysics of truth as unveiling, making possible a certain freedom from nihilism in the proper 'ethos' or dwelling- place of a humanity that is neither originarily called by death nor by the 'Voice' which, for Agamben, names the metaphysical construal of language in terms of the elemental scissions of the logos. In Infancy and History, this 'ethos' is understood by Agamben through a notion of infancy or infantile dwelling in language, as that which precedes the constitution of the speaking subject as such. (Murray and Watkin, like Mills, stress the importance of 'infancy' for Agamben's whole project.) This infancy is not, however, simply 'outside' of speech in the sense of referring to an earlier developmental phase prior to the 'proper' acquistion of language. Instead, infancy establishes the very conditions of possibility of speech. Its precedence is ontological rather than chronological: infancy is prior to language in this sense. As Mills writes, 'the concept of infancy indicates the possibility of a pure experience wholly based in language itself, which the human subject undergoes, and in doing so, returns to its proper dwelling place or ethos' (25). It is in this sense that we might be able to imagine 'the favourable opportunity that the nihilistic condition presents' (21), as Mills puts it. In speech we do not just part ways with a more infantile past, but unavoidably re-experience the 'wordless</page><page sequence="3">Agamben's Potential 139 condition of infancy' to which we are thus called by every possible moment of language that awaits us. Infancy is thus something like a non-present remnant that haunts language from the very beginning, a constituting condition or irreducible medium which makes the subject's very experience possible. Yet, thought of in this way, infancy is the surplus which grants the possibility or future of language, rather than constituting simply its pre-history or past. Infancy as the 'ethos' of the human does not therefore name a prehistorical state which might allow us to understand the authentic essence of the 'human', but instead establishes human being as fundamentally historical and historically oriented (oriented, indeed, on the basis of an infancy always still to come, beyond the 'subject' itself). Crucially, the complex temporality or historicity of infancy as 'prior' in a multiple sense (one not bounded by simple chronology) poses a profound challenge to any notion of subjectivity (self, consciousness, psychology, etc.) which assumes the secondariness of the 'taking-place' of language. Infancy insists that experience is never primarily the experience of the subject, but that it can only come to pass through the mute medium of an infantile dwelling in language (26-7). Mills links Agamben's thinking of infancy to his reading of Aristotle on potentiality. In 'On Potentiality', Agamben glosses this as follows: 'if a potential to not-be originally belongs to all potentiality, then there is truly potentiality only where the potentiality to not-be does not lag behind actuality but passes fully into it as such '-1 Potentiality to not-be, without which potentiality would not be worthy of its name, is therefore to be understood not as that which gets destroyed in the passage to actuality, but as that which makes actuality possible (indeed, actuality is itself always defined by its potential to not-be). Set against the metaphysical grandeur and nihilistic destiny of the Shakepearean question 'to be or not to be', Bardeby's infamous 'I would prefer not to' is figured in terms of a 'pure potentiality' which refuses to be exhausted either by actuality's coming to presence or indeed its passing away, sounding out the mute condition in speech which gives all language possibility while resisting every attempt at linguistic mastery. (It is worth noting here that perhaps the best chapter in Murray's book is one which concentrates on a range of what he calls 'exemplary inoperative figures' (115) in literature that preoccupy Agamben and help explain the connections in his work between language, literature, philosophy and politics.) As her book develops, Mills evaluates the implications of Agamben's reflections on infancy and potentiality for his thinking of an experience of language in poetry beyond the negative foundation of metaphysics.</page><page sequence="4">140 Paragraph (Murray, too, has a chapter on potentiality and the 'to come', which may be usefully read alongside Mills's development of the theme of potentiality for Agamben's notion of the coming community.) The pathway to this experience, she tells us, may He for Agamben in poetic metre 'in so far as its semantic value relies on the (non-coincidental) structural dimensions of both sound and signification' (40). If poetry survives on condition of the productive tensions between sound and sense, 'the most concentrated point of which is enjambment' (40), then the latter as a privileged marker of the very distinction between poetry and prose at the same time raises the question of precisely where the poem ends. Since the final line of the poem simply cannot compose itself in terms of the enjambment that awaits every other line in the poem, it fails the test of poetry in a certain way, and thereby risks falling into prose. Yet, as Agamben writes in The End of the Poem, the 'double intensity animating language' - i.e., that of sound and sense, or of the semiotic and the semantic - 'does not die away in a final comprehension; instead it collapses into silence, so to speak, in an endless falling. The poem thus reveals the goal of its proud strategy: to let language finally communicate itself, without remaining unsaid in what is said'.2 Thus, the very 'thing' of language, as Agamben suggests in his essay 'The Thing Itself',3 is just the medium of its sayability. (For Watkin, The End of the Poem offers a 'touchstone' for his whole, finely focused book, since it concerns 'the relationship between discursive prose and poetry: logo-poiesis' or poetic thinking (32). Watkins's theme, then, is the irreducible if complex relation of philosophy and language, poetry and thought; indeed, the idea of poetry as a mode of thought which, for Agamben, might recuperate language in precisely its irreparability, in the wake of the scissions of metaphysics.) Mills acknowledges the extent to which Agamben's philosophy of language is indebted to Benjamin's call for a pure language which, rather than serving as a means of communication based on the negative metaphysics of logos and sign, communicates only its own communicability as such. (The last part of the book also dwells on Benjamin in order to assess the role played by messianic time in Agamben, for which the key text is The Time That Remains, on Pauline messianism, where the fulfilment and abolition of Jewish law in terms of the potentiality which founds it ushers in the possibility of revolutionary - and thus, perhaps, properly historical - time, rather than simply religious salvation.) From Benjamin, too, is derived the task of criticism, arising at the threshold of philosophy and poetry,</page><page sequence="5">Agamben's Potential 141 each existing in a split relation to language (thus, under the sign of the logos). While poetry may possess its object while not knowing it, philosophy produces a knowledge of the object without possessing it, Agamben tells us. Meanwhile, criticism operates at the point at which these divisions may be overcome (criticism as that which 'neither represents or knows, but knows the representation', as he argues in Stanzas4). Criticisms destiny for Agamben is thereby to rediscover the ethos of language beyond the structuring divisions of metaphysics. In a marvellous chapter on aesthetics, language and the representation of the object, Mills therefore concludes that 'for Agamben, the destiny of art cannot be decided upon until the "secret" nihilistic essence that rules Western thought, which condemns humanity to negation and Nothingness, is brought to light' (55). Here, she clarifies the role played by Hegel, Marx, Freud, Arendt, Warburg and several others in the story of Agamben's intellectual development, as well as tracing connections between Agamben's reading of metaphysics, his philosophy of language and aesthetics, his understanding of nihilism, and the political stakes of his better known work on biopolitics and sovereignty. Through a variety of historical and critical readings, Agamben seeks to demonstrate the paradox that it is exception that gives rise to the law in all its force. Following Schmitt (but also developing his work in relation to Benjamin's critique: 'Benjamin provides Agamben with the theoretical resources to think beyond (...) [a] decisionistic account of sovereignty', as Mills puts it (60), one which Agamben associates with the nihilistic 'form of law' in modernity), Agamben argues that the power to produce exceptions to the law in fact defines sovereign power, which therefore realizes itself in the capacity both to exclude and to capture 'bare life' within the sovereign exception. The most obvious recent example of this is the detention without legal status of terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay, although importantly Agamben traces out a similar structure of what he terms 'biopolitical' power in the form of the Nazi concentration camp, which he sees less as the absolute outer limit of possibility of human endeavour and history, than as a more or less inevitable consequence of the West's specific political formation from the outset. Agamben therefore sees sovereignty - construed as the right to produce exceptions to the law - as far from waning (a perspective which questions the conception of sovereignty's epochal demise amid the modern reconfiguration of power in terms of governmentality, administration and discipline, often attributed to Foucault).</page><page sequence="6">142 Paragraph Sovereignty, as the innermost centre of the juridical order, yet also above or outside the law, thus constitutes itself through the ability to produce exception to the law as the law, and therefore to wield its power - in states of 'emergency' - against bare or 'sacred' life, a category Agamben derives from Roman criminal law, one which indicates the enigmatic figure of the sacred man, homo sacer, who can be killed but not sacrificed, a 'banished' individual who as such becomes the object of a purely profane violence that enacts itself to the exclusion of all categories or contexts of moral or ethical responsibility, and in total absence of legal rituals or rights. Sovereign power, that is, resides precisely in a ban-structure (the influence of Jean-Luc Nancy's work is important here), whereby it acquires its force paradoxically by abandoning Ufe to its barest condition; casting out or, in a certain sense, freeing biological existence from the politico-ideological reach of the law, in order to exercise power over 'life' all the more unremittingly, precisely in its excluded 'bareness'. (In her chapter on biopolitics, sovereignty and nihilism, Mills does a wonderful job of showing the connection between Agamben's notion sovereignty and his thinking of potentiality. In Homo Sacer, Agamben writes: 'the sovereign ban, which applies to the exception in no longer applying, corresponds to the structure of potentiality, which maintains itself in relation to actuality precisely through its ability not to be';5 accordingly, 'the particular force of the sovereign in relation to the exception', as Mills says, 'is that it maintains itself indefinitely in its own potentiality, that is, its own not passing into actuality through the structure of not applying' (75).) From the perspective of 'bare Ufe', then, Agamben casts a new and unsettUng Ught on debates concerning human rights, eugenics, euthanasia, medical intervention, organ donation, brain death, ethnic cleansing and the concentration camp, by insisting that the power derived from the sovereign exception is ultimately biopoUtical power, the 'fundamental activity' of which is none other than 'the production of bare life as originary political element', to quote Homo Sacer.6 Thus, Agamben detects a hidden compUcity between discourses and practices devoted to the preservation of bare Ufe (that is, those discourses which seek Uberation from ideological, poUtical or reUgious determination in order to assert the basic, inaUenable value of 'Ufe' itself), and the biopoUtical or thanatopoUtical death machines associated with the horrors of the last century. For Agamben, then, it is not the city but the camp that estabUshes the fundamental poUtical paradigm of the West. Sovereign power and bare Ufe thus dwell at the threshold of indistinction between law and violence, states of emergency and the</page><page sequence="7">Agamben 's Potential 143 permanent condition of rule, exclusion and inclusion, the human and the non-human (the latter categorial pair relating to one another from ancient times through the production of a zone of indistinction which Agamben analyses in The Open, but which constitutes the threshold of bare life in other writings). Since it can be found at the very origin of political and juridical formations, the state of exception - as precisely a threshold of indistinction - increasingly becomes the permanent structure or condition of the politico-juridical order, and is thereby destined to extend itself in planetary terms. Thus sovereignty as exception is exercised along a biopolitical horizon that includes the physician and scientist as much as the political leader; while the figure of the sacred man remains obscure to us today, Agamben insists, only inasmuch as we are all effectively homines sacri. As Benjamin Noys has put it, "'bare life" gains confirmation in the "humanitarian interventions" that confront us with the images of that "bare life" on our television screens and, at the same time, maintain that "bare life'" as the support for sovereign power'.7 In other words, in 'exceptional' circumstances or states of emergency, such examples of bare life in fact maintain the power of law beyond law. For Agamben, this calls for a new politics, unrecognizable in terms of the political models and thought of the West. As Mills shows, Agamben sets about this task with a reconception of the political in terms of potentiality (and impotentiality), one which aims to acknowledge rather than conceal the originary structure of the biopolitical, and hence negotiate it otherwise. Agamben's effort to reconceptualize the political emerges in texts such as The Coming Community, where he rethinks notions of the social and political relationship in terms of the ungraspable singularity of the 'whatever'. This is an unnameable, non-identical object beyond generalization, founding the possibility of a kind of belonging in language that moves beyond the scissions of particularity and universality, identity and commonality. The 'whatever' provokes Agamben to avow communal 'being' in all its contingency or historicity, while also showing that the value of this history is a certain irreparability: that which gives rise to an experience that can no longer by grasped by 'classical' politics, philosophy or metaphysics. Drawing again on his formidable resources in the philosophy of language, then, Agamben combines the themes of potentiality, the irreparable, and the singular non-place of 'whatever', tracing out the novelty of a coming politics at the limits of the State. (In Means Without End, a politics of gesture - of means without end - is worked out against the ruination and bankruptcy of the current</page><page sequence="8">144 Paragraph political field.) Meanwhile, by dwelling in Homo Sacer on the disputed reading of Kafka's tale 'Before the Law', Agamben takes up Benjamin's critique of Scholem's interpretation of the story as one of power 'being in force without significance'. Instead of endorsing an image of pure law beyond its own content as merely an apt expression of nihilism in Kafka's text, for Agamben the tale signifies a state of exception turned into the rule such that the nihilistic fulfilment of the law also renders law 'indistinguishable from the life over which it ought to rule',8 reducing at a stroke the law's claim to transcendence and indeed its very interpretability 'from the position of life', as Mills has it (64). Consequendy, as she later suggests, 'Agamben's case will be that while Schmitt harnesses the power of exception back to the juridical order, Benjamin releases that power into a new politics beyond law and beyond the state' (66). Mills is quick to argue that this Agambenesque 'new politics' must not be construed in terms of the kinds of political resistance which, for instance, one might associate with the Foucauldian argument, glossed by Mills, that there is an 'immanent potential for reversal within the relations of power' which stems from the production of 'biopolitical techniques' within 'the forces of the body itself (76). Rather, 'according to Agamben, the aporetic violence of modern democracy stymies any attempt to oppose biopolitical regimes from within the framework of bios and zoÄ. Such projects will tirelessly repeat the aporia of the exception' through what is effectively a continual re-politicization of 'natural life' (76). The 'coming politics' must therefore articulate itself 'outside the triad of bios, zoÄ and bare life' (76); that is, in terms of a 'form-of-life' or 'happy life' apart from the political capture/ exclusion of bare life. As part of the Homo Sacer project, Remnants of Auschwitz confronts us with the figure of the Muselmann - the inmate existing only in the barest form of life, indeed in a grey zone of indistinction between life and death, human and non-human, violence and law - who offers for Agamben a complex image not just of absolute sovereign domination but also of an intractable disjunction, worked out in Agamben's rethinking of a near impossible testimony which changes the very question of language, ethics and the political. Remnants of Auschwitz sees Agamben setting himself the task of thinking the legacy of the camps in terms of the impossible possibility of witness. Declining to use the term 'Holocaust' because of its sacrificial connotations, yet distancing himself from some of the implications found in notions of the 'unsayable' horror of Auschwitz, Agamben reflects upon the</page><page sequence="9">Agamben's Potential 145 Muselmann and the survivor, notably through the writing of Primo Levi. If the impossibility of bearing witness except by proxy verges dangerously upon the dilemma of establishing juridical 'proof - for the only true witnesses to the absolute horror of the camps do not survive to tell the real story or verify the facts - then Agamben draws once again upon the philosophy of language in order to undertake the effort of rethinking testimony at the limit of life and death, at the point of radical exchange between the human and inhuman ('the human is fundamentally conditioned by an indefinite potentiality for being non-human (...) and of enduring the non-human', as Mills puts it (89)). Auschwitz changes forever the chance of preserving decency and dignity in the very task of bearing witness: after Auschwitz, says Agamben, the tragic paradigm in ethics is no longer possible. Rather, a concept or thinking of shame allows for a new thought of testimony on the threshold between subjectification and desubjectification, which is also, as Mills says, the site of 'an infinite muteness that provides the very condition of communicability' (82). (Shame, as Mills notes, is not to be confused with a sense of the guilt or culpability of survivors, but begins from 'the ontological situation of being consigned to some- thing that one cannot assume' (90). Shame becomes an inextricable yet unassimilable remnant which makes of testimony's dwelling place the ceaseless ruin - not just the 'end' - of the subject, founding once more the possibility of a new experience of the 'having' of language.) While biopower aims not so much 'to make live or let die', as Foucault once put it, but to produce bare life as a form of survival which separates the human from the inhuman, testimony 'with its every word', as Agamben writes in Remnants of Auschwitz, 'refutes precisely this isolation of survival from life'.9 As Mills neatly concludes, testi- mony 'bears witness to the inhuman in the human' - or, again, the incapacity to speak as the ground of speech itself - 'and thus prevents their separation and collapse in the production of bare life' (90). For all her patience in tracing the various connections that structure Agamben's general project (and in this her account is ultimately more compelling than Murray's critical introduction), Mills is not uncritical of his work overall. For example, she suggests that Agamben's call for a profound rethinking of politics and philosophy prior to any form of political action - which without it would remain simply within the horizon of sovereignty, biopoli tics, and nihilism - risks looking like 'a peculiar and ill-founded belief in the power of philosophical thought to effect sociopolitical transformation' (84). Indeed, it demands the separation of philosophy from politics as a</page><page sequence="10">146 Paragraph necessary stage in a critical interpretation oriented toward human transformation, when Agamben's analysis itself asserts precisely the essentially 'philosophical' grounds of the 'political'. For Mills, then, the 'paradigmatic' approach of Agamben derives from a conceptual absolutism, the rejection of all 'regulative discourse' is too sweeping, and the evocation of historical 'completion' is, finally, excessively enigmatic in relation to the practical demands of political liberation. (As Mills notes, critique of all normative forms, institutions, or politics risks looking redundant and contradictory if one holds that all such forms are merely restrictive, negative, and thus, as it were, largely besides the point of authentic being.) More particularly, Mills suggests that 'it is not clear that an ethics of witnessing' - an ethics beyond ethics in any conventional sense - 'extends beyond an auto-affection, in which the subject acts solely in relation to its own passivity' (i.e., in the fall towards its own ruination, or in its self-relation on the threshold of subjectification and desubjectification). In contrast, Mills wishes to underscore that 'the taking place of enunciation can itself be seen as always a matter of "being-with" others', as Nancy might put it (104); others that, as Mills adds, are not exempt from complex differences, including those of gender, race, class, sexuality and social inequality. Thus, Agamben's work begins to look somewhat blind - perhaps borderline autistic - in relation to relationality itself. (Murray, in contrast, is more content to argue that 'Agamben approaches ethics as not the attempt to think through the relation to the other, but as an attempt to encounter the "homeland of humanity" by turning towards the glossolalie potentiality of human being' (131).) Calarco and DeCaroli's volume appears more narrowly focused, but still opens up numerous pathways for reading and debating Agamben's work. Here, Ernesto Laclau, like Mills, finds that Agamben's 'genealogy is not sensitive enough to structural diversity and, in the end, it risks ending in sheer teleology' (12): 'In some sense the origin has a secret determining priority over what follows from it' (11). Laclau mistrusts Agamben's distinction between zoÄ and bios as operating according to a rather unthinking re-abstraction of the former term. Moreover, the ban-structure as the original political situation which ties sovereignty to bare life is, for Laclau, articulated by Agamben in a way that does insufficient justice to 'the system of possibilities that such a structure opens' (14), including that of a 'collective identity' which may contrast with the effects of a mere 'naked individuality' exposed to its own, bare defencelessness; an identity that - in activating possible 'countertendencies' - may assume its own active, revolutionary resistance in the name of another</page><page sequence="11">Agamben's Potential 147 law. Indeed, it is this radical antagonism that, for Laclau, defines the political relation as such. In contrast, 'politics necessarily disappears' in Agamben; his description of the political in its most original form in fact amounts to 'an elimination of the political' in the interests of an essentialising and teleological theoretical 'unification', which indeed unwittingly encourages blockage of 'any possible exploration of the emancipatory possibilities opened by our modern heritage' (22). Interestingly, by way of conclusion, Laclau resorts to a notion of 'deconstructing', in order to assign a name to the opening of precisely such practices of and possibilities for 'struggle and resistance'. Paul Patton examines Agamben's understanding of biopolitical modernity, whereby the histories of totalitarianism, nationalism, state- building and liberal democracy remain tied to a global horizon defined by 'the convergence of biological and political life' (203). Far from understanding biopolitics as a recent phenomenon, of course, Agamben locates the 'biopolitical' as an abiding feature of the entire Western tradition. For Patton, then, Agamben presents his thesis as a 'correction' of Foucault's account of the emergence of modern biopolitics as a condition of post-Enlightenment techniques of government and state power. Yet Patton explores the troubled fortunes of the term 'biopolitics' in Foucault's work, suggesting that its 'further development' was impeded not by Foucault's early death, as Agamben assumes, but because of 'problems internal to the concept of biopolitics itself' (206). 'Foucault's analysis of classic sovereignty (...) already anticipates Agamben's thesis that the biological life of subjects (zoÄ as opposed to bios ) was always included in the scope of sovereign power', Patton notes, suggesting that Agamben's revision of Foucault is in this respect redundant and erroneous. Nevertheless, a paradoxical tension between political theory and practice presents the key challenge to Foucault's own approach to biopolitics: 'At the level of representation, classical sovereignty was already biopower. At the level of political technology, it only became biopower in the course of the nineteenth century' (214). (In another essay in the volume, Catherine Mills somewhat reduces this internal paradox in Foucault, while nonetheless bringing into relief once more some of the significant tensions between these two thinkers, by insisting on the fact 'that Foucault's methodological approach to the concept of biopower is genealogical and historical, while Agamben strives for an ontologization of the political' (180-1).) Through rereading Foucault, Patton questions (as indeed Derrida had done previously in Rogues10) the way Agamben treats the distinction between zoÄ and bios : homo sacer is not simply pure zoÄ but zoÄ caught up in a particular</page><page sequence="12">148 Paragraph "status"' (210). For Patton, it is the question of this historical and materialist 'status', caught between the two levels of Foucault's analysis, between the theory and technologies of the 'political', that appears most promising in envisaging future work on biopower. Dominick LaCapra, meanwhile, examines Agamben s Remnants of Auschwitz. LaCapra presents Agamben as seeking pole position in the theoretical field by advancing overly theoreticist insights that remain insufficiendy attentive to the 'mutually interrogative relation' (135) of theory and history. Thus, the Muselmann is approached 'as a theoretical cipher to disprove human dignity and to discredit all pre- existing (perhaps all presendy conceivable) forms of ethics' (150-1), as if Agamben 'theoretically' hollows out this figure of the Muselmann in a manner redolent of the very reduction to bare life practised as the biotechnology of Nazism. LaCapra sees in Agamben 'Auschwitz- now-everywhere hyperbole' (157), which, by theoretical unification of a highly problematic field, 'goes beyond any notion of specificity or distinctiveness' (135), both in the historical analysis of Auschwitz's particularity, and in the reduction of the victim-perpetrator relation as simply levelled out by the 'zone of indistinction' which joins them. Like Laclau, LaCapra finds Agamben guilty of a type of theoretical determinism which fails to account for the plurality and complexity of the historical legacy of the Holocaust (LaCapra sees Agamben's rejection of this term as too sweeping and removed from the politics of usage among diverse groups today), and which is too inhospitable to the future of a post-Holocaust politics not confined to Agamben's 'blank, Utopian, messianic, (post) apocalypticism' (161). Agamben is thus presented as too dismissive of any 'compromise formation' between a supposedly 'mystified view of full identity, rights, essence, and telos' and 'a vision of the human as pure potentiality related to the bankruptcy of the past and all pre-existing values' (161). As he himself hints, however, LaCapra's reading risks repeating a pattern of hyperbolic interpretation and rhetorical excess purportedly found in Agamben's work (in the notes to his essay, LaCapra himself loses much specificity at the point he groups as 'postapocalyptic' writers as diverse as Agamben, Bill Readings and Nicholas Royle). Matthew Calarco, meanwhile, is slower to dismiss Agamben's refusal to compromise with received ethical and political values. Calarco writes: 'For him there is litde point in pursuing a politics and ethics based on human rights, when the full impact of the critique of humanism has not been measured and been allowed to transform our ideas of community and being- with others' (166). Part of this 'critique of humanism' must entail rigorous re-examination of the</page><page sequence="13">Agamben's Potential 149 distinctions that separate the 'human' from the 'animal'. Moreover, for the purposes of Agamben's general project, the place of the 'animal' within biopolitics - indeed 'the functioning of the human-animal distinction within the logic of sovereignty' and bare Ufe - needs careful investigation (165). Calarco wants to determine the extent to which Agamben's thought unravels this very same distinction. At times, Agamben is applauded for offering a conception of a 'human form-of-life that does not divide zoÄ from bios - such would be the politics of the coming community' (169). But he is also charged by Calarco with a lack of vigilance regarding the 'reductionistic determination of animal life' (165), and is seen as sometimes guilty of an anthropomorphic treatment of the human-animal relation, with the questioning of its terms still undertaken from the perspective of 'man' (166). For Calarco, what hangs on this investigation of Agamben's own degree of 'anthropomorphism' is the very question of utopianism in thought, and its true effects. On the question of respect for 'animal life', 'neo-humanist arguments concerning the merits of the democratic tradition have little if any weight' (174), says Calarco. Indeed, it is wholly 'utopian' to imagine that such a tradition can somehow be transformed so as to 'do justice to the multiplicity of non-human Ufe' (175). This is something Jacques Derrida was at pains to point out, as the author recognizes. Finally, while Agamben's thought of 'life' offers a glimpse of a world freed from the 'human chauvinism' of the modern tradition, Calarco asserts that 'the critical and deconstructive gesture of jamming the anthropological machine is just as important as the positive project of articulating another non- binary and non-hierarchical concept of the human' (179) - a note that somewhat echoes Laclau. Jenny Edkins's approach to Agamben is also nuanced. Following Negri, she presents us with 'two Agambens': the one who wholly denounces the political conditions of today, and the other, not unrelated to the first, who grasps the 'internal antagonism' of the 'political', in order to think about consequent transformative possibilities. Like Calarco, Edkins focuses on Agamben's notion of a 'form-of-life' that is not just nakedly exposed to sovereignty in its ban- structure, but which - as it becomes wholly profane, unsaveable or irreparable - may achieve something like a 'step-backwards-beyond' (to borrow an early Agamben phrase) in regard to the politics of (human) sovereignty. Such a 'form-of-life' relates to Agamben's idea of 'whatever singularities' treated by Mills. Edkins suggests that, within Agamben's thought, bare life may be seen as undecidably both the nihilistic product of sovereignty and biopolitics, and 'a rogue</page><page sequence="14">150 Paragraph component that can bring to a halt the mechanism that produces it'. This pushes Agamben's work in a direction not acknowledged by his more strident critics. For it could thereby 'be taken as a call for a micro-politics of action and engagement' (86). While Edkins is measured in her understanding of the effects of a 'whatever politics' of the type that emerged both in Beijing and East Berlin in 1989, her essay resists reducing Agamben's political thought to the neccesity of a 'grand eschatological move' (87), and, by seeking out suggestive combinations with Nancy and Derrida, she looks for a (messy) messianism of the 'here-and-now'; one that, far from restoring full presence, happens, as Derrida would perhaps have put it, in the singular event of engagement. (Indeed, Murray begins his book in optimistic vein by stressing just such a potential for political 'tactics' arising from Agamben's work.) This volume makes a genuine contribution to thinking about the politics of sovereignty, exception and biopower, both in the work of Agamben and in those that he reads. Some essays provide excellent critical commentary on Agamben's work. Others usefully clarify key critical debates that define Agamben's reception in the English- speaking world. Bringing together writers in different degrees of sympathy with Agamben's thought, the collection helps us to think about the problems and limitations of his work, but also includes suggestive readings which, if they do not entirely answer Agamben's opponents, nevertheless push the interpretation of Agamben's thinking in directions not fully envisaged by his staunchest critics. While in Mills's chapter, the 'connection between the metaphysical problem of potentiality and the political problem of sovereignty' is explored (181), and while Bruno Gulli also approaches the ontology and politics of sovereignty and exception by re-examining Agamben's engagement with Aristotelian potentiality, the book falls a little short in tracing the indebtedness of Agamben's high-profile 'political' philosophy to the distinctive philosophy of language developed across his writings.

For Agamben, Derrida remains trapped within a metaphysics grounded in negativity, while he himself aims for a more original 'putting together' as a way to confront metaphysical divisions that, allegedly, deconstruction can only underscore as diffÃ©rantial or disseminal. For the Derrida of Rogues , meanwhile, Agamben s conceptual treatment of the terms zoÄ and bios is so badly flawed as to undermine his entire endeavour. While it is extremely important for contemporary 'theory' or continental philosophy to grasp and develop the critical stakes of the Agamben-Derrida dispute, I would also be tempted to approach Agamben's hostility in terms of what Derrida once called the 'Sec effect', whereby arguments and themes are taken from an author or text (in this case, of course, Derrida was referring to Searle s treatment of 'Signature Event Context'), only to be distorted and turned into objections to the very same author or text. Since Agamben can be read as working from a very rudimentary and misconceived reading of deconstruction (see for instance Jean-Luc Nancy, 'Philosophy as Chance', Critical Inquiry 33:2 (2007), 427-40), one which nonetheless establishes certain facets of his intellectual trajectory, Derrida's writing may provide the basis for a critical engagement with Agamben that is more rigorously or intrinsically 'philosophical' than some of the negative reactions to Agamben's 'polities'.</page></plain_text>
