Fifty years after Propp's work on the functions of the faery tale, narrative studies are now entering a new phase. Beside the ever-recurring studies on themes and values dear to the old school of Humanism and literary history and an Aristotelian criticism dealing with the relationship of specific narratives to specific genres or styles in terms of propriety and finality, there is today a structural criticism dealing with the linguistic and semiological aspects of the narrative in terms of systems and structures. The reasons for this development are clear enough. On the creative side, the radical transformation undergone during the first part of this century by the concept of literature in general and that of the novel in particular (Kafka, Proust, Joyce, Thomas Mann) has undermined the age old tradition of oral or written storytelling, complete with plot, characters and moral judgments. On the critical side, the demise of symbolism in Russia, the writer's involvement with his own narrative self and disenchantment with a traditional hero in the West, must be related, if only very loosely, to the overall development of a formalist criticism both in the East and the West (from Shklovsky to Lubbock). The New Critics and their disciples ap- proached narrative studies in the context of their relation to a tradition of representation (the dual structure-showing/telling-of mimesis) in Western culture: in this sense, Lubbock's Craft of Fiction (1921) and Booth's Rhetoric of Fiction (1960) both demonstrate a clear awareness of the rhetorical implications of story-telling for the narrator and his topic. The Russian Formalists, on the other hand, were generally concerned with the purely formal properties of the narrative, its plot sequence, its charac- ter system, its style periodization and input. More recently, continental studies of the narrative, more concerned with an abstract theory of narrative universals than with a definition of specific surface properties, have com- bined the heritage of the Russian Formalists and the teachings of Saussu- rean, structural and transformational linguistics, in order to isolate what would appear to be a basic narrative (linguistic) structure. However, be- cause there is no marked difference between a theory of human actions and a theory of narrative, and because narratives are, so to speak, everywhere, we have to recognize that there is no theory of human actions which is not first a theory of narrative, and vice-versa. Thus, the search for the basic unit cannot depend only on linguistic criteria of selection and pertinence: it must include pragmatic, logical, perhaps even anthropolog- ical criteria as well. It is no longer the business of the literary critic turned linguist, but that of the linguist turned semiologist, and interested in all the significant aspects of human behavior. 2 DIACRITICS/March 1977</page><page sequence="2">Yet this growing supremacy of semiology raises more than one theoretical ques- tion. First, the semiologist, influenced by the enormous development of transforma- tional and generative grammar, searches for matrixes, units whose basic pertinence is defined in linguistic terms. But this supposedly clear linguistic scheme requires so many qualifications and adjustments that it becomes either too naive (for lack of refinement) or too obscure (for its excessive complexity). For instance, as Br6mond shows in his review of Todorov's work [in Logique du Rdcit pp. 103-128], if the proper noun is just a symbol for the agent as subject and executor of the plot (whose tribulations will only be studied within the linguistic frame of a syntax of exchanges, attributions and reversals), and if the intrinsic properties of this symbol in no way modify the structural function of the agent, there can very well be two names (even perhaps two characters) for one agent. In order to maximize the applicability of the syntactic model, a semantic qualification must then be introduced, and a (basic) semantic distinction must be made between the concept of subject as Agent and that of subject as Patient. Furthermore since the concept of Patient usually implicates, albeit without including them, those agents, who, without directly affecting the out- come of the action, nonetheless influence it to some degree, and make it take a turn for the better or for worse, Bremond also suggests the adoption of the categories of Influencer and Improver/Degrader. We can take these suggestions even further, and hypothesize that a syntax of the narrative must be complemented with a semantics governed by the rules of logical coherence (principles of identity and non- contradiction), albeit without being subject to the rules of (1) finite state grammars (English, French, etc.), where sentences are derived from other sentences and where such statements as sincerity knows John are classified as problematic only because of special restrictions affecting the configuration of a particular sentence, or (2) a genera- tive grammar, where, although sentences are not derived from other sentences, translinguistic elements (for example, narrative kernels or sequences of plot) of the narrative would still be organized on the basis of a mere linguistic competence. Admitting that such a procedure for establishing a semantics exists, it would have to meet the following criteria: (1) it must be universal (2) it must be specific; and because narratives articulate specific qualifications of subjects (Agents/Patients) in relation to the selection and combination of specific action processes, it must be capable of yielding a classification of relations in the field of discourse (the level of the linguistic signans, or its narrative equivalent, the racontant, the telling) vs. story (the signatum or racont--to which Br6mond expressly limits himself). Br6mond believes that only a semantics broadly based on the articulation of logical processes can meet those criteria and solve the problem defined in his foreword: "is,it possible to describe the complete network of options logically allowed a narrator at any point in his narrative, to pursue the story in progress?" [p. 2] Whence the appropriate title of his book: Logique du Rdcit. Br6mond's book is divided in two parts. The first is a collection of articles offering a critique of some famous forerunners as well as controversial semiologists of the narrative (Propp, B1dier, Dundes, Greimas, Todorov), published from 1964 to 1971 in Communications, Podtique and Semiotica, including the now classic "Logique des possibles narratifs" published in Communications 8, 1966, and of which another (English) version has appeared in Semiotica (1970). The second part is a theoretical sketch (illustrated with a great abundance of folk and folk related material) of the "principal narrative roles." We should remember that the French r6le can be trans- lated by role, or part or type, depending on the amount of emphasis placed on the anthropomorphic aspect of narrative (role and part connoting a subjective and drama- tic process absent from type). This two-part division is helpful in that it allows for (1) a situating of Br~mond's work in the broad context of narratological studies and (2) a thorough treatment of the problem outlined in the foreword. Logique du rdcit is remarkable for the flexibility, if not the virtuosity, which the author displays in applying his method to a multiplicity of texts at various stages of the DIACRITICS/March 1977 3</page><page sequence="3">narrative process. In what constitutes a major improvement over Propp's chronologi- cal presentation of the narrative functions in the Russian folktale, Br6mond's book concentrates on the quasi-behavioral capacity of each function to generate its own subsystem and also to alter the very course of the narrative with eacbh turn of events. Believing that a sequence should be considered neither as an end in itself, nor as a chance occurrence in some drawn-out historical process, Br6mond cannot wholly subscribe to Propp's historical coding of sequences. This is not to say that he rejects the idea of cultural constraints: as a matter of fact, he does emphasize the necessity for a great variety of subcodes in the close examination of a specific semiotic substance, for example, film as opposed to literature. Yet, because he is reluctant to move from Propp's strict deductions to the sweeping reductions of Greimas or Todorov (accord- ing to whom all modifications can be translated into a system governed by the implications or contradictions between two subjective statements), he is not prepared to accept what grammarians of the narrative have to offer. His own system is based on the premise that a one-way plot complete with its established cluster of sequences does not exist. What underlies Bremond's whole system is a dual structure, which can be for- malized in the following manner: (1) a syntagmatic structure-every action can be defined in principle with reference to a three-stage process: (a) possibility or likeli- hood of action, (b) action in progress, (c) action accomplished and results achieved, with the specific indication that, at any of the stages, the action can indeed progress or be stopped; (2) a paradigmatic structure-every action can also be defined with reference to the fact that, at each stage of the process, it can take a turn for the better or the worse, thus working to the advantage or to the disadvantage of the Agent/ Patient and/or the people around him. In the section on the Patient, under the subsection entitled "the patient exposed to an impending modification which ulti- mately will not take place," Bremond gives the example of the Queen who is expected to give the King a son and who will suffer a miscarriage instead. The great advantage of such a descriptive system is, of course, that it will register elements of narrative, previously unregistered because of their virtuality, yet playing an effective part in shaping the expectations of the narratee and thus contributing to the dramatization of the narrative. To be sure, neither Propp nor any of the other Formalists, who believe that each function can only be defined by its results and achievements, will be able to register such alternatives. Since they are obsessed with chronology, not only can they not code virtuality vs. reality, but they must also dismiss all dual morphological functions and split them successively on the syntagmatic axis, in an analysis which fails to accredit the strength of the narrative. When Dundes, for instance, codes a narrative unit (what he calls a motifemic sequence) as Lack--Assignment of Task--Task Com- pleted--Lack Liquidated, he does miss, as Br6mond shows, the opportunity to order sequences according to the specific character of the mediations which ensure the liquidation or creation of the lack. The motifeme Lack Liquidated, logically implied in the motifeme Task Completed, is not given next to its correlate in the text, in the manner of an effect next to its cause, but perceived through it, as a genre is perceived through species. A bi-dimensional graphic expression becomes necessary, in order to transcribe these parallel series of motifemes, some of which simultaneously imply the rest. Instead of Propp's unilinear sequence, we shall have the following scheme: Lack to be liquidated Task to be performed Process of liquidation ' Performance process Lack liquidated Task performedi 1 Logique, p. 71. The sign , denotes an implication in a dual morphological function. 4 DIACRITICS/March 1977</page><page sequence="4">III Now, to understand the structure formalized above, we must define the mode of its utilization and the field of its application. 1. Brdmond's logical mode 1.1 By logic and logical mode, we might want to refer, first, to those constraints which any narrated series of events must obey in order to remain coherent, con- straints which are radically different from those by which a narrative is invested with specific cultural or moral values (consider, for instance, the Aristotelian rule of unity of plot and time, later expanded to include unity of space [Barthes 1966; A. J. Greimas &amp; F. Rastier 1970]).2 All such constraints entail a clause of non-contradiction and exclu- sion, so that the two statements "Peter was poor; he is not poor any longer" &amp; "Peter was not rich; he has become rich" cannot be said to be logically coherent: there is no necessary relation, no logical coherence between poor and not rich. As Br6mond shows in his discussion of Greimas, the relations of one statement to the other is purely -- C? i~&amp;W :"i;"' L~a~B~r~si~lgC8 i-i V ~l;~;pglss6~;~b~'~aPu~3k~;~~~,~-a~~- a matter of lexical and stylistic choice [p. 81ff.]. The adoption of Greimas' minimal constraints would not enable us to produce a model powerful enough to generate and articulate narrative structures. 1.2. If we wanted to select a more powerful model, we might try to define logical coherence in terms of causation. Thus, for an action to be coherent in relation to another one, it would suffice for it to be brought about by another one in direct sequence. But this would not be satisfactory either, as we have already seen that too much reliance on the concept of causation could only lead to an excessive syntagmati- zation of the narrative and also result in a serious loss of pertinent information. 1.3. There remains what Greimas himself refers to as Br6mond's logique dc- cisionnelle, where the terms and value of the concept of causation are to be redefined within the scope of that of implication. This is accomplished, first, by a return to an age old Aristotelian precept [Poetics, VIII], that is, that the function of the poet is not to describe, as a historian, things that did happen, but the kind of things that might have happened, or, to put it another way, "that which is possible as being probable or necessary". The precept, refined by two Chicago critics, C. S. Crane (1952) and Paul Goodman (1954), is not only that fiction must be distinguished from reality, but also that narratives are made to work by combiningprobable implications: confronted with a series of alternatives, the skillful author always manages to select, for each stage of the plot, the one that will contribute the most to unifying the whole plot. On the other hand, to be fully effective, a system of probabilities must also contribute to the dramatization of the plot. Barthes, commenting in Communications 8 on a systemic logic 2 For references indicated in this form, see the bibliography at the end of the article. DIACRITICS/March 1977 5</page><page sequence="5">of actions [1966: 14], indicates that this dramatization is the result of a tension between a logic a minimo (at each stage of the process, there is a possibility of meaning, which can be, or not be, actualized: thus, in a specific sequence of one of lan Fleming's novels, James Bond, wanting to light his cigarette, does not respond to the offer of a light, because he instinctively fears it may contain a trap) and a logic a maximo (closed upon itself, actualized or not, the sequence is always ready to function as the first subsequence of a broader system, to become, in Pike's or Dundes' terminology, linked to the motifeme through a particular feature or distributional mode, for exam- ple, in Fleming's books, a particular mode of initiating a new Bond mission). Now this kind of intention must truly be universal, because, however much we may want to reduce it to a pure meta-language for our own critical purposes, we have to admit that it speaks to us, readers or spectators, in a very forceful, albeit undefinable manner: it corresponds to the kind of interior knowledge the characters, and we through them, have about a certain finality of the text. At each stage of the action, there are pos- sibilities of meaning, which become, so to speak, available to us in their totality. These possibilities, in turn, we do project in our mind, in a series of paradigms, which we then constantly test and reduce to a simple syntagmatic line. That we understand this process as logical does not entail any contradiction with the fact that it is indeed fundamentally related to a structural view of language, based, since Saussure, Hjelmslev and Jakobson, on the dual principle of presence (identity) / absence (difference) // succession (syntagm) / substitution (paradigm), and to a generative or transformational syntax, whose parsing and stemming procedures might indeed be very helpful in determining the range of all implications. But logical it must remain, if we are to take full advantage of the notion of implication, and understand it in terms of its narrativization in the course of the story process, that is, in its relationship to the concept of role and its dramatic resources. 2.1. The question of human reference. In his critique of the Constitutional Model, Br6mond particularly objects to Greimas' concept of faire anthropomorphe as an unnecessary stage between the abstract level of deep syntax and the manifesta- tions of a surface grammar. In his review of Todorov's Grammaire du D~cambron, he again attacks the anthropomorphism latent in the categorization of the proper noun: (i) to posit a category of the proper noun without real grammatical properties is tantamount to assuming that the proper noun is itself nothing else but a cover for the substance of the person, and leads to the subsequent proposition that (ii) a narrative which does not deal with animate subjects or objects is not really a narrative, unless it specifically humanizes them, for example, a science book which tells the saga of the atom or the epic of electricity by treating physical elements as if they were human variables. Br6mond adds that the only correct criterion of coherence in the narrative is not that it is human, but that the subject of the actions remains identical and consistent through the sequence of episodes: such a narrative is the minimum narrative, which consists in a string of events arranged in a mere chronological sequence, and discus- sed from an outsider's point of view [p. 111-112]. This on-going critique of the question of human reference should not be dismissed as an academic debate of ethics and value judgments; indeed, its outcome is likely to affect our outlook on the narrative in a very fundamental way. While in his now classic 1966 Communications article, Br6mond had come out in favor of the vision an- thropomorphe, in the Logique, formalizing a trend that had long been obvious in articles published since then, he definitely rejects it. An anthropomorphic rule which would make the supremacy of the acting subject bound only by obstacles to his will or his desires as essential to narrativity as, say, the overall emphasis on the code of the message is to literariness (literaturnost) in Jakobson's poetic function, yet would provide no criteria to define the concept of humanness (which must thus remain as vague as that of literariness), cannot be of any help in the linguistic determination of an arbitrary set of (narrative) structures. With Br~mond, there is no need to invoke such a rule, since narrativity is not tied to modifications effected only by the acting subject or Agent (a thesis with which Structuralism unwittingly shows what is perhaps too much respect for the old humanistic tradition of the hero), but also depends on the 6 DIACRITICS/March 1977</page><page sequence="6">reactions of a Patient, variously affected by the progress of his or the other characters' actions, and even perhaps, on the manifestations of the other functions directly related to that of the Patient: the influencer and the Improver / Degrader. This means that even the minimum narrative is endowed with role potential. Because, irrespective of the number of characters in the story or of its complexity, its coherence is not defined by the mere succession and/or combination of sequences, but rather by the relation of these sequences to the various types or simulacra they constitute. Let us pause for a moment and ponder this concept of role. The 1964 Communica- tions article, devoted to a review of Propp's work, and later included in Logique, in the context of a critique of folk-narrative studies, does not, in any way, refer to a theory of roles. Br6mond is merely interested in making Propp's system more flexible by suggest- ing that one should, wherever possible, take advantage of the dual morphological function manifested by any text (each process can be or not be completed, in a way that is beneficial or detrimental to the Patient-Agent). In the 1966 article, however, Br6mond is edging toward a theory, when he suggests that the model of the dual morphological function be made more specific, by registering I) three modes of connection available between sequences: 1. the end-to-end connection Villainy to be commited Villainous act Villainy committed = Villainy to be punished judicial procedure Punishment administered 2. the enclave connection Task to be accomplished Means ofaccomplishment Procedure of accomplishment Putting the means into operation Task accomplished Success of the operation 3. the joining connection Damage to be inflicted = Villainy to be committed Damaging procedure Villainous act Damage inflicted Villainy committed II) three phases (included in the above) I//) and, finally, three perspectives, through which the concepts of separate dramatis personae, of one hero and/or one heroine, are absorbed into the larger concept of separate or concurrent roles: This singleness disappears, when the improvement, instead of being creditable to chance, is credited to the intervention of an agent, endowed with initiative and under- taking to achieve it on the grounds that it is indeed a part of a task to be performed. The process of improvement is then organized as behavior-which implies that it becomes structured into a network of goal-means that can be filledad infinitum. Furthermore, this transformation introduces two new roles: on the one hand, the agent, who undertakes the task for the benefit of a passive beneficiary, plays, in relation to him, the part of a means, no longer lifeless, but endowed with his own particular interest and initiative-he is thus an ally; on the other hand, the obstacle encountered by the agent can be incarnated in an agent, also endowed with his own initiative and interests-this other agent is an adversary. Thus, inasmuch as the text makes possible a pair of alternatives at each stage of its narrative process, and inasmuch as these alternatives are incorporated into the narra- tive to make it more tense, more interesting, the text literally produces roles which help the narrator establish a value system applicable to his story, and very soon give us the illusion that he or his characters have suddenly developed a point of view. Let us DIACRITICS/March 1977 7</page><page sequence="7">note in passing that alternatives are an integral part of the concept of a dual mor- phological function, where each feature mode, for instance, is usually defined as the result of a choice between two (alternate) possibilities: the term alternative makes this selection a function of both form and content, so that any (stylistic) choice which does not radically alter the content is simply not registered as alternate. We shall see later that this simple restriction is actually of such importance that it does reduce the effectiveness and the applicability of the whole model. For the moment, however, let us continue our presentation of the logical mode. 2.2 Roles and actants. In his 1964 article, Br6mond suggests that his analysis makes possible the building of an integral model for situations and behaviors of an indefinitely growing complexity which is able to produce "those simulacra of events and characters (dramatis personae, actants, roles, whatever one may wish to call them) required for a semiological analysis of narrative structures": they are semantic in- vestments of abstract concepts, whose combination is designed to illustrate, through the use of a binary scheme, the transformation of basic logical constraints inherent in any signatum (primary contradictory relations of the type white vs. non-white and adversary relations of the type white vs. black with derived secondary adversary relations of the type non-black vs. non-white) into basic discursive, narrative func- tions. By reducing Propp's sequence of thirty-one syntagmatic functions to six, and casting these six, first, into a primary couple of contradictives, Greimas establishes the basic couple actantiel: Subject/Object; then, by deriving two secondary adversary couples from the first one, he establishes the other two couples of actants: the Addressor/Addressee and the Ally/Adversary (or Traitor). These narrative functions are, again, no more than the superficial loci, the semantic topoi corresponding to logical constraints, where the specific actors (S1S2S3; A1A2A3, etc.) are located and from where they can move and can be moved through operations of disjunction and conjunction. For instance, the Fair Princess, who belongs in S and A (along with her father the King, the Court and the Kingdom), is disjoined into 0 and moved to T by a mischievous traitor cousin. The hero (S2) will attempt to retrieve her in turn and bring her back to her parents, thus effecting a conjunction. In the Russian folktale, as in most other narratives, it can therefore be stated that the narrative process is activated by a disjunctive conjunctive relation between the actants, which usually leads to an inver- sion of the semantic content, according to Greimas' dialectic algorithm X-1/Y-1 = X+1/Y+1, where X and Y represent two types of actions: positive and negative. Still, because the appreciation of the actants depends on the actualization of the semantic investment in a linguistic substance (proper noun, adjective, verb, etc...) and on its pertinence (relationship of each of the specific actors to the actants), their interrelation can only be traced satisfactorily when the analyst takes into account the level of a superficial or surface grammar, that of semantics and style in particular. This, in turn, would require a definition of the criteria of selection and pertinence applica- ble in surface analysis, which Greimas does not want to undertake. Br6mond, on the other hand, appears to have avoided the dilemma by opting for a semantic mean between structure and texture. Avoiding reductive abstractions as well as stylistic analyses, he provides an intermediate level, which he calls the precoding of the narrative (the coding taking place at the level of the literary text only), and which enables him to perceive the investment of a pragmatic and motivational context as directly constitutive of a set of narrative roles. The perception of the role, therefore, does not hinge, as is the case for the actant, on the relation of an investment to a deep-structure modification in what Bremond calls the Haven of Immanence [Logique, p. 4], because, as Bremond's own analysis shows, it is the investment which directly constitutes the role; then, and only then, can we resort to the models of formal logic and/or stylistics. 2.3. Phases of the model: an example. Along with each phase of the reconstituted process, and to emphasize the relative flexibility of his mode, Br~mond usually gives one or more examples of role phase, and, sometimes, even the summary precoding of a full-length tale episode. Yet, because the book makes, as we have seen, no distinc- tion between human roles and narrated roles, he rightly assumes that there is no need 8 DIACRITICS/March 1977</page><page sequence="8">for him to offer the reader a step by step analysis of an entire work, say, an epic like the Iliad, a play like Hamlet, or a novel like Madame Bovary: the closure of a literarywork is nothing more than the termination of the role process by elimination of all pos- sibilities available at a given moment. Logique du Recit only strives to provide a chart of all those possibilities, leaving for the end a table of relations (i) between roles, (ii) between the level of roles and the other levels in the narrative. In the ch.apter devoted to the Patient, for instance, Br6mond selects two levels of inquiry, corresponding to the two types of action discernible: (i) a subjective level, where the Patient reacts to the situation according to his knowledge of it; (ii) an objective level, where the Patient is the beneficiary of an evolutionary process or the victim of a counter-evolutionary process. Now, at each stage of the situation, provision is made for a set of alternatives, where the selection of one of the alternatives will help define the specific conditions to be fulfilled so that an action ceases to be a virtual alternative and becomes an actual fact. At the subjective level, the Patient can: 1. be exposed to an actual process of (positive or negative) modification, -- ....... !-,'.',. ? ? i-loW 3V:c .7. "P- without specification in the text as to whether the Patient is actually affected by this process in his mind, and whether he is reacting or not 2. be exposed to an actual process of (positive or negative) modification, with specification in the text as to the Patient being or not being affected: (a) (with specification that) the Patient has no knowledge of being affected: in which case the Patient is exposed to one of several information processes, leading him to the truth or, on the contrary, to a countertruth; (b) (with specification that) the Patient has know- ledge of being affected, but that this knowledge, which helps form an opinion in the matter, is going to be lost because of the initiation of certain counter-revolutionary processes (distraction; refutation; dubitation); (c) (with specification that) the Patient has knowledge of being affected, but that this knowledge may have been lost; that it can, nonetheless, be retrieved under certain conditions 3. derive satisfaction or dissatisfaction from the process 4. anticipate deriving satisfaction or dissatisfaction from the process [pp. 139-173]. Then, and only then, can we go on to the objective level, where the Patient is thought to be either the victim or the beneficiary of a particular process. If the process is completed, the Patient can be the beneficiary of a process of improvement or the victim of a process of degradation. However, if the process is interrupted, the im- provement takes the form of a protection, and the degradation, the form of a frustra- tion. In each case, the protector or the frustrator can be one or several persons. They can be the same as (or different from) the victim: there is a good example of the two being performed as subroles by a single Patient-victim in the case of the hero, say, Edgar or Gloucester in Act IV of King Lear, who, despondent at first, becomes moti- vated to act again and decides to better his lot. DIACRITICS/March 1977 9</page><page sequence="9">2.4 Pertinence of the model. Having abstracted his complete register of roles from the examination of specific narrative units, conversely, Brdmond now ends with an examination of how this register will, in turn, help define relative criteria for the constitution of narrative units in their pragmatic and motivational context ("le codage du Rscit"). He offers four relative criteria, which he enters into a table with the functions of Patient and Agent: 1. syntax (which formalizes implicatory relationships between processes) 2. process (process of improvement, degradation, information, etc...) 3. phase (mere possibility; in progress; completed) 4. voluntary or involuntary aspect. He then concentrates on what happens to the rest of the elements in the table, each time one or two criteria change. At the end, Br~mond gives us a separate table for the classification of all syntactic links used in the syntax column, claiming that only through this classification can one get the synthetic picture of the relations of the Patient and the Agent and also be ultimately guaranteed an equivalence between logical and linguistic structures [p. 321]. This last part of the book is perhaps the most interesting, as it justifies Brdmond's work on three grounds, by responding to a series of anticipated objections: 1. Is not the book really incomplete, since it studies only one element in the narrative (roles)? -No, because roles are the fundamental and constitutive element in the narrative. In this respect, the book offers a complete semiology of roles, and, perhaps, although BrSmond never actually suggests it, the only complete semiology of narrative available today. 2. Is not the book irrelevant, since it does not use a linguistic model? -No, because, in its process, it still considers modifications and transformations performed on the two linguistic universals of narrative, the subject and the predicate. 3. Is not the book based on the predication that a particular system of roles works better than another? -No, because there is, again, no difference between narrated roles and human roles in general: the apparent anthropomorphic quality of roles merely results from the humanization of processes performed by the narrative itself, and understandably maximized by the narrator. Brdmond thus goes so far as to suggest that the problems of point of view, and more generally, of a teleology of the narrative, which are usually considered to fall within the province of the theorists of the narrating (the racontant) are actually textual ized, one is tempted to say, somatized, at the level of the narrated (the racont6). IV To conclude this review, we now would like to discuss the pertinence of Br&amp;- mond's model, not in the restricted context of a semiology of the narrated, but rather, in the general context of a semiology of the total narrative. In the last part of his last chapter, Br~mond asks "do the criteria of plot analysis selected for our coding of roles yield an essential part of the signification of the narrative text?" [p. 324] And he answers: We do not believe that one can approach the meaning of a narrative without constantly refering oneself to a system of roles. He who chooses to do without it is condemned to the following alternative: either he applies to the text categories of analysis where the notion of role does not obtain-but what one can grasp by means of an analysis of this type has nothing to do with the narrative: it is an enclave in the midst of the narrative, or a message paralleling that of the narrative proper-or the seemingly non-predicative or achronic concepts which he applies to a structuring of the plot camouflage personal subjects and predicative processes, i.e., roles [p. 327]. He adds that these enclaves (the parts of the narrative not concerned with roles) have no bearing on the coding of the roles, which are already pre-set or pre-coded, so to 10 DIACRITICS/March 1977</page><page sequence="10">speak. In a total semiology of the narrative then, it is this pre-coding which should be studied first, as the sole determinant of a form, whose particular substance can be examined later. In the end, however, and as to the question whether such pre-coding does make the text genuinely more significant, or, on the contrary, whether it obscures other meanings, which must thus remain partially latent in the course of the interpretation, Brcmond finds himself hard pressed to answer. We in turn would like to offer a critique of Bremond's position on the following grounds (which we shall indicate in general form and then discuss in some detail): 1. By further distinguishing those processes that belong from those that do not belong in his study (e.g., the above discussion of the enclaves), Br6mond does indeed clarify his argument. Yet, by the same token, he also imposes great limitations on the scope of his study: by defending a primacy of the narrated over the narrating, without bothering to establish a relational model for their integration, on the one hand, he fails to assess, through a paradigmatic analysis, the semantic value attached to a particular alternative, and, on the other he isolates himself from the context of today's integra- tive semiology, from Barthes (1970) to van Dijk (1972). 2. In fact, the claim to establish narrative universals transcending genres or modes and aspects or voices (which commit the particular phon6 of a narrator to his text) in oral literature, where it is easy to reduce a work to a sequence of motifemes with a subsequence of allomotifs, may not prove successful in the context of more sophisticated processes, where the configuration of the narrating has an impact on the structuring of the narrated. 3. If one admits, as Br6mond does, that narrated roles and real life roles are one and the same, because, in any event, a role is always related to a narrative which describes it and articulates it, then we shall have serious problems every time we encounter a work where the behavior of the characters is revelatory of roles which are more fictitious than real, that is, which are supposed to put us in touch with reality precisely through the excessive fiction in them (Don Quixote and Madame Bovary, for instance). To begin with, even if we admit that there is no difference between a theory of actions and a theory of narrative, and if we allow for the constitution of a reductive model of roles, we still face the question of knowing what to do (i) with texts essentially produced by a series of enclaves, where the narrator's own slant is funda- mental to the proper understanding of the story developments, (ii) with texts that are essentially not narrative in the usual sense of the term, including highly stylized poetic genres. Again, what is at stake here is the pertinence of role analysis to a general semiology of narrative. In the first case, even if, as Br~mond suggests, we do keep in mind that a logic of roles still has to undergo further testing and evaluation, it is disturbing to us that a theory, which continually builds its model from the narrative of numerous folk-tales and folk-related works, offers almost no example from the novel narrative, nor from the very specific context of the folk-related novel: the novel of adventure, say, Jules Verne's Around the World in eighty days with its quest-type hero Phileas Fogg [Logique, p. 216]. Indeed, most of the quotes used relate to faery tales, epics, or, occasionally, drama, and since they are not arranged following an individual work, but according to a system of logical alternatives, we may find it difficult to extrapolate from them a whole model which could be applied to something as complicated and sensitive as a novel by Stendhal or Flaubert, or as deceptively simple as Camus' or Sartre's stories. There, a form of logical analysis would yield very little of interest. Which is to say, in so many words, that the novel is a specific genre, not in the classic sense of the term, because of aesthetic or psychological considerations, nor, in a more Proppian sense, because of a particular sequence of functions, but, in a very structural sense, because of a narrative structure which has become too sophisticated to be coded or pre-coded primarily as a role structure. Once this becomes clear, what had appeared before as a textural or cultural variable in a system (the novel genre complicating, yet accountable in terms of, roles) now seems to constitute a functional problem in its own right, and, concurrently, to raise fundamental questions about the DIACRITICS/March 1977 11</page><page sequence="11">effectivness of a semiology of narrated narrative in general, and of Br6mond's model in particular. To be sure, Bremond's tacit disqualification of the novel as genre has its prece- dent elsewhere in Structuralist criticism. In almost every case, the model functions at such a level of linguistic abstraction, and the field of applicability is so narrow, that the results are disappointing. Thus, the Decameron (studied by Todorov in his Grammaire du Decameron) is only a collection of micro-tales, and Laclos's Les Liaisons Dangereuses (also studied by Todorov in Litterature et Signification [1967]), only an epistolary novel, that is, in each case, the narrative instance affords sequences easily reducible to pragmatic criteria, while the patterns (parole) of the characters are but the dramatic variations of a single narrative language (langue). Other critics, following Todorov, have recently attempted a delineation of the concept of character. Philippe Hamon, in his "Pour un statut s6miologique du personnage" (1972), and Sorin Alexandrescu, in his Logique du Personnage (Riflexions sur I'univers faulkndrien) (1974), have both suggested criteria for a possible typology of characters. Ham- mon adopts a linguistic distinction between referential characters (historical charac- ters or characters related to a historical context), shifter characters (mouthpiece characters, messengers, author's representatives, etc.) and contact characters (characters with a purely anaphoric function). Alexandrescu, on his part, follows a purely logic configuration of character classes based on inclusion and exclusion. Yet, although both studies assuredly deserve full consideration on their own terms, they still fail to answer the basic question of how a specific character (a character substance) can be derived from a particular role (a semiological form orseme). Furthermore, and as far as logic is concerned, even assuming the process underlying an episode ends once the premisses have been carried out, and the identification and classification of the episode pose no serious problem, it does not automatically follow that this logical process truly corresponds to a distinct stage in the dramatic progression of the entire story. For instance, when Rodomont in Orlando Furioso [p. 188] discovers, too late (after he has beheaded Isabel) that her philter will not work, can we properly restrict our enquiry to the situation involving Isabel and Rodomont? And are we not over- simplifying the implications of the story by coding something like "Isabel afraid of being raped" with "Patient attempting to frustrate a possible Degrader"/"'Patient unable to frustrate his Degrader"? In the end, considering all these and Brdmond's studies together, we may just have to ask ourselves whether the implicit reduction of a class episode or narrative frame to that of role is really a productive one. So far, we have only mentioned genuine narrative texts. But what are we sup- posed to do about non-narrative, poetic, philosophical and/or dogmatic texts? What about Plato's Republic, where the account of the building of the city-state has more to do with the clarification of the concept of Justice than with the description of any particular class of people? What about the account of life in Atlantis in the Critias? What about the Waste Land or the Cantos? In any event, even if we were to dismiss this last group of texts, there would still remain another problem, which has been with us since the beginning: the basic ambiguity of linguistics and semiology inherent in any narrative study. On the one hand, the basic narrative structure is translinguistic, although one could conceivably account for one-sentence-narratives in strict linguis- tic terms, where the narrative statement would not be different from a linguistic statement; this, however, would be very simplistic. Yet, on the other hand, narrative studies, and Br~mond's in particular, do take for their basis the linguistic principle of difference between Langue and Parole, between the idiosyncrasies of a character and the general constraints of his role, and concentrate on the abstract Langue aspect of the text. All this means a constant interplay between an arbitrary set of rules and surfaces manifestations that can only be assessed empirically. On the one hand, consideration of surface content is pre-empted by the establishment of syntactic relations; on the other, an examination of that content is required to ensure a correspondence with those relations. This might explain why Br~mond, who manages some sort of mean by working on specific examples, while dismissing the thematic content in each narrative, cannot 12 DIACRITICS/March 1977</page><page sequence="12">finish his book (afterthought? awareness of a lack?) without paying at least lip service to a stylistic criticism, whose subtleties and distinctions on semantic investments he otherwise finds not pertinent to a study of roles. Taking the example of a character who signals to another by coughing, he asks himself whether the critic should not pay attention to the substance of the message (the semiotic relation of cough to speak) and its referential context (the semantic value of the signalling act). His answer is quite ambiguous: if, at the level of a general logic of actions, the semantic investment is irrelevant, it may be that, in the tradition and the context of a particular narrative, it is the key to our understanding [pp. 323-324]. Evidently, the answer could be made easier and clearer by suggesting a better case in point: something more substantial and more dramatic, involving a whole literary work, like the impressive account of physical postures and object locations in Robbe-Grillet's La Jalousie. The problem, however, is one of theory, and we would need more than practical answers. We shall argue that this and other problems above cannot actually be resolved without the help of a semiostylistic theory, whose specific purpose it is to study relations [see (2) above ] between the semiotic and the linguistic level. ................ We will not deny that any narrative can indeed be charged according to Br&amp;- mond's specifications. But we shall insist that a logical coding can only be elaborated in relation to a particular process obtaining in the text and regulating its message, e.g., making possible the translation of narrative units into narrative or dramatic roles, and authorizing their subsequent classification. Thus, whether two texts appear to have been structured by identical or different roles, those roles are actually secondary codings of a primary perceptual process which relates a linguistic substance to a semiotic form in the specific context of a stylistic analysis, and makes it possible for us to acknowledge identity or difference. A Logique du Rdcit can only be useful, if it is based on the discovery of those processes, which we call semiostyles, and whose theoretical background we have established elsewhere (1975; 1976). Let us now take an example given by Brdmond to illustrate identity and/or differ- ence in what he sees as an original pre-coding of roles. He likens a situation in the Odyssey, where Ulysses, having put wax into the ears of his sailors, chooses instead to have himself tied to the mast of the ship, to another in Eastern European folk literature, where the hero, however hard he may try, never manages to know fear [pp. 159-160]. Br6mond charts the two roles as: (i) "Patient exposed to an actual process of influence (seduction); being influenced; experiencing something (desire)" (ii) "Patient ex- posed to an actual process of influence (fear); remaining uninfluenced; not ex- periencing anything (no fear)." Yet, if the stories of Ulysses and the fearless hero are thematically the same (both yearning to go home and return as heroes, both yearning for that last experience which still eludes them), their situation cannot be compared: the approximation of desire and fear as two psychological motivations functioning identically is quite vague, and, any criticism of Propp's chronological sequence not- DIACRITICS/March 1977 13</page><page sequence="13">withstanding, too little attention has been paid to the lack of contextual correspond- ence between the two stories. Not only is Ulysses going home, while the other hero's quest has not even begun, but the Greek is conscious of his experience, while the Lithuanian must be asleep. Indeed, it is through a play, a trick on the theme of desire that both heroes appear as such: they both want to know that which would stop them from being what they are (a deathly desire, on the one hand; a crippling fear, on the other). Accordingly, it is the writing of the texts themselves which should be examined. They should both be seen as testing their own workability by making a trick, a subterfuge possible: Ulysses, who cannot surrender to the Sirens, lest he cease to be a hero, has himself tied to the mast of the ship, so that he may still hear their song, and the other one, who cannot be overcome by fear, lest he too cease to be a hero, must be surprised during his sleep. Eventually, one might be able to show that, if the two heroes' experience appears similar, if the agents give us the impression of having acted the same part and come out with different results, the reason is that the narrative itself is the product of a subterfuge: a common rhetorical figure known as the adunaton (triggered, in Greek, by a play on the verb &amp;xovzw, "to listen"): "he who ignorantly listens to the voice of the Sirens, no wife, no little children will welcome him on his return home [. . .] I put wax in their ears, so no one would listen [. ..] I, however, had decided to listen" [Odyssey, XII, 41-48]. Semiostylization of theaduna- ton makes it effective at both the linguistic level (relation between unmatchable subject and predicate) and the semiotic level (relation between (i) to know and to do and (ii) the different forms of knowledge). The difference in the end of each narrative is simply the result of a variation in the form of knowledge (awake vs. non-awake). The adunaton then is interesting, not because it enables two heroes to play identical roles with a slight modification in the end, but rather because it constitutes, prior to any consideration of Agent/Patient/lInfluencer, etc., and through a projected transforma- tion of the predicative content, but under the guise of a specific topos, the narrative kernel which is to be articulated with reference to various parties in various contexts. Now, one could object that (i) in this topos, roles are already constituted as such-yet this is not really the case, because the change in semantic value (to know is to die--to know is not to die) effected through the subterfuge is constant anyway; and (ii) in any event, a narrative only begins when a role structure has appeared, so that the actuali- zation of the topos depends on it-but this is not true either, as the roles are bound themselves by the built-in transformations of the topos. We can then conclude that a logic of roles is but a dramatization of basic con- straints already at work in any given corpus. As such, it is, no doubt, an extremely valuable attempt at exploring and formalizing the dramatic potential of narrative. It does not, however, permit us to consider texts where this dramatization is weak or complicated by the accumulation of textural devices. On the other hand, we could also extrapolate from the above examples, and claim that: (1) semiostylistics is an effective tool of investigation; (2) it offers more possibilities than a logic of roles through the establishment of a list of semiostylistic processes with reference (a) to a particular work, (b) to a group of works, which could then be identified assemiostylis- tically similar, (c) to an entire body of works, so as to constitute a new (semiostylistic) history of literature. It could be shown, for instance, that, in times of revolution, most artistic productions utilize the clichL&amp; as semiostyle [Blanchard, 1973]. This may read like an invitation to practice Russian Formalism all over again. Yet semiostylistics has one feature Russian Formalism does not have: it is mostly relational, and stresses correspondence between all levels of the texts. It is thus an ideal common ground for all structural studies of literature. To suggest what the full scope of a semiostylistics might be would take us beyond the limits of this paper. We shall, therefore, limit ourselves to the following remarks: 1. Semiostylistic structure vs. logical sequence. Let us consider the logical se- quence in the case of a particular phase of the Patient process illustrated by a La Fontaine fable, Phcdbus et Borde, where the Sun and the Wind compete with each other in trying to inconvenience a traveler: "The Wind wasted its time: The Fiercer it would rage, the firmer the other would stand." Bremond codes: "Possible patient of a 14 DIACRITICS/March 1977</page><page sequence="14">possible modification of his state; possible patient of an actual process liable to modify that state; patient maintained in his initial state, because of the non- completion of the process liable to modify that state" [p. 141]. Here the logical process delineated by Br~mond is actually inverted from the original one; the notation of failure precedes that of the modification process itself: "The wind wasted its time." We also note that a translation from story to discourse occurs where the use of the imperfect indicates an aspectual shift in the narrative (wasted---would rage). Now, we are suggesting that the perception of a non-modification of the original state depends on the perception of a stylistic opposition between an expected and a reversed order of imperfect and simple past, linked to a shift from story to discourse. It is mainly through the unusual collocation (the imperfect-French tourmentait &amp; tenait ferme- follows the simple past-French perdit--instead of the unusual sequence, where the simple past breaks the imperfect) that we can be convinced of the vanity of Borde's efforts and thus perceive the process of non-completion registered by Br6mond. In this case, actually, the selection of the process of non-completion is made absolutely necessary by the phrase il perdit son temps; the negative reverse (il ne perdit pas son temps), which could have conceivably determined the choice of the other alternative (completion) would idiomatically be inappropriate here, as the French ne pas perdre son temps is always used in another figurative and expletive fashion (English: to waste no time). Finally, the rest of the text confirms our interpretation. In the lines following the couplet hastily isolated by Br6mond, the use of the present indicative clearly underwrites, through a decisive shift, the subsequent choice of the other alternative, exposing the linear development of a role structure through the successive stages of noncompletion and completion of the initial modification process: As soon as he Boree had reached the end of the time Prescribed for the wager, The Sun dissipates the clouds, Recreates and then eventually penetrates the cavalier, Through his mantle makes him sweat, Compels him to divest himself of it. Now, all this particular detail takes on special significance, when one wants to understand why Br6mond's analysis never offers any logical criteria for selecting one or the other alternative: it is because there is nothing in his stemming that permits him to mandate this selection without relying on a surface procedure. According to his model, a Patient X in a state A and a potential Patient of a modification process X can either remain in A or be changed to xA. And this is precisely where semiostylistics is indeed useful, because it can help determine the writer's commitment to one or the other alternative as a matter of textual procedure, where a logical model could not be specific enough. It is thus the tool required to effect a translation from virtuality to actuality and guarantee that a logical model is truly operational. 2. Stylistics and semiostylistics/The styletic and stylemic aspects. The criteria for semiostylistic analysis are, first and foremost stylistic, aiming at defining a (macro- &amp; micro-) context, as proposed by Riffaterre (1971) and others. They are (together or separate): derivation-the contextual pattern is broken; convergence-there is a contextual relation between linguistically unrelated elements, e.g., expletives and non-grammatical statements can still make a sentence connoting surprise, etc., while, on the other hand, the rimes and the verbal structure of a sonnet can also concur in creating meaning; and anaphorical redundancy-the context is activated by an anaphorical system. This context, however, is not interesting in itself. It only serves to alert us to the possible activation of a semiostylistic process, through the application of the above criteria in the field of phonology, metrics, syntax and/or morphology, where appro- priate. The semiostylistic process thus contemplated has two main aspects: (a) On the one hand, it consists of a structure of reading, where meaning is assessed in terms of value, quality, intensity and time, for example, in the La Fontaine episode, the pair DIACRITICS/March 1977 15</page><page sequence="15">simple past/imperfect. This aspect we call the the styletic aspect. b) On the other hand, it also comprises a structure of semiotic coherence, by helping bring about the particular mode of a deep-structure implication related to a surface modification, that is, by making it manifest: in the Odyssey, for instance, every time Ulysses is about to enter a danger zone, the poet makes him, almost ritually, pull out his sharp sword alongside his thigh. This implication may belong in Br6mond system of alternatives, with a shift from Patient to Agent: Ulysses will not be changed into a pig by Circe's wand; on the contrary, he will use his sword and Hermes' plant to subdue her. Likewise, it may be specified in relation to any other semiological model: in Todorov's table of syntactic transformations, with an inversion of attributions (the object- Ulysses-becomes endowed with the attributes of the subject); in Greimas' model of semantic opposites (the subject[Ulysses], with the help of an ally Hermes, retrieves his lost strength and his disjoined companions). This aspect we call the stylemic aspect. This distinction, adapted from Pike (1955)-the behavioral context is restricted to the reader's perception of the text-has the advantage of stressing integration as well as distinction proper. For instance, a modification in the intensity of the styletic -i ~fii i8:B~i~ S ;*c~ aa: ~ p~ 4~'i~I B~ i~l~s Ilii--:-; ~~-~ s-~?--- ::::':~:~~:~:~~:;~~ rl~~ n i~"*r F~~:?"~"-""- ?s-Pi rrrw ?ci:;~w~~ M~ ~PP~~~ ~.-i ~a~i i_??- ':~-??_?-i-P~i I~ ?r~~ aspect, that is, a change in the stylistic register, would be in the direct relation to a modification in the logic of the stylemic aspect, that is, a choice between two alterna- tives. It has the other advantage of playing down the subjective factor involved in any stylistic analysis, and, accordingly, of eliminating some of the vague criteria proposed to regulate this subjectivity (Riffaterre's superreader), by allowing a constant check of the styletic against the stylemic and vice-versa. For example, if a particular stylistic feature checks against several modes of deep-structure modification, say, Br6mond's dual morphological function, Dundes' motifeme or Greimas' actant, it is more than likely that this feature is indeed one of the manifestations of asemiostylistic process. In conclusion, we can summarize the views presented here as follows: (a) Br6- mond's Logique du R~cit appears to offer valid criteria for the study of narrative at the level of the narrated and in the form of a general theory of roles and role-playing. (b) However, neither this theory nor any other theory of narrative should be considered apart from the stylistic processes, which it implies, and on which it eventually be- comes dependent for its elaboration and its application.
