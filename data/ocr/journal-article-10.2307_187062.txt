As far as I can tell, the only basis for this claim is that F is not a product of pure states of S and S'. But it is quite obscure why Lanz (or d'Espagnat, whose account Lanz follows) should think that the separability of S and S' in this sense (i.e. t = a ? B3') is in any way required by the above interpretation. William Demopoulos, The University of Western Ontario. FREDERICK GREGORY. Scientiftc Materialism in Nineteenth Century Germany. Studies in the History of Modern Science, Volume 1. Dordrecht, Holland and Boston: D. Reidel, 1977. xxii + 279 pp. $28.00 cloth, $13.50 paper. Gregory's book is a study of the school of scientific materialism which flourished in Germany after the failure of liberal revolution of 1848. The bulk of the work is concerned with the popular scientific writings, materialist propaganda and the political activities of the three principal exponents of scientific materialsim: Karl Vogt, Jacob Molleschott and Ludwig Buichner. The book is primarily a historical study of the interconnections between science, metaphysics, religion and politics in Germany in the period from 1840 to 1860. It does, however, raise some interesting questions concerning the sources and scope of German materialism in the nineteenth century, its relation to the science of the period and the legitimacy of appealing to scientific theories in order to support political and ethical value-judgments. The book is divided into three parts. The two chapters of Part One discuss the influence of Ludwig Feuerbach on German materialism and the reaction against the materialists in the 1850's. Part Two deals in detail with the turbulent careers of Vogt, Molleschott and Biichner and their prolific (and often prolix) writings. A novel feature of Gregory's account is his inclusion of the "irrefiihrender" materialist, Heinrich Czolbe. Part Three is devoted to "Issues." The character of this section is indicated by its chapter headings: "Of Philosophy and Science," "Controversies in Biology" and "Materialism and Society." In Part One Gregory argues that the father of German materialism was Ludwig Feuerbach. More than the writings of any other figure, it was Feuerbach's attack on Hegelian idealism and his expose of Christianity as the anthropomorphic projection of human needs and desires which inspired the anti-clerical, anti-theological, anti-idealist and anti-authoritarian spirit of the materialist movement. For the materialists, Feuerbach had shown the vacuity of using suprasensual, transcendent concepts instead of providing genuine explanations grounded on scientific facts and observable phenomena. My only reservation about this section is that there is perhaps too much emphasis on Feuerbach and too little on science. As Gregory himself admits, Vogt probably did not read Feuerbach until after his views had been formed. Also the influence of Feuerbach on the materialists was at least reciprocal. It was, for example, only in his 1850 review of Moleschott's Die Lehre der Nahrungsmittel that Feuerbach first unequivocally espoused scientific materialism and coined the notorious pun, "Der Mensch ist was er isst." The materialists touched a sensitive nerve in German culture. They were regarded as a potent threat to traditional religion, conservative morality and the political authority of the Prussian state. Clerics, both Protestant and Catholic denounced their atheism; Neo-Kantians such as Frauenstadt, Lange and Meyer criticized their dogmatic meta- physics and naive epistemology; Fischer, a right-wing Hegelian, defended free-will and morality against the assaults of determinism; Liebig, Wagner and Schleiden condemned the superficiality of the materialists' popularisations of science and the legitimacy of the inferences they drew from them concerning the non-existence of any immaterial soul in human beings, vital forces in living organisms or spiritual purpose in nature. All three members of the materialist triumvirate lost their jobs because of their views. Vogt, who at the time was Professor of Zoology at the University of Giessen, was expelled from Germany after the collapse of the Frankfurt National Assembly to which he had been an elected delegate; Moleschott was forced to resign</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS his post at the University of Heidelberg because of the controversy engendered by his Der Kreislauf des Lebens; Biichner was fired from the medical clinic at Tiibingen upon the publication of "the materialist Bible," Kraft und Stoff. The attraction of the materialists' position stemmed from their insistence that their iconoclastic naturalism was supported by recent developments in science, especially in physiology, chemistry, medicine and biology. Vogt, Molleschott and Buchner were the sons of doctors and had taken medical degrees. Both Biichner and Czolbe, a physician in the Prussian army, practiced medicine and Vogt and Molleschott had performed some original research in physiology, nutrition and geology. The materialists argued that advances in the biological sciences clearly indicated that all human activities, from digestion through to thought, would ultimately be explicable in terms of the same physical and chemical laws which governed the interactions of inanimate matter. Science would never discover a vital force unique to living matter nor an immaterial soul. Borrowing the favorite analogy of the French materialists of the eighteenth century, Vogt boldly proclaimed that "thoughts stand in the same relation to the brain as gall does to the liver or urine to the kidneys." Unfortunately, the materialists had no satisfactory reply to their philosophical critics who accused them of riding roughshod over the problem of consciousness. How were sensations and thoughts related to physical brain processes? Only Czolbe attempted to respond in any detailed manner to Lotze's challenge (later reiterated by DuBois Reymond) that there is an unbridgeable gap between a mechanical description of brain processes and one's experience of consciousness. This problem remains, of course, in modern debates over the mind-body problem. One should not, perhaps, condemn the superficiality of the materialists too harshly since, as Lange pointed out, the idealists were equally incapable of providing any coherent answer to this problem. It has been customary in studies of German materialism to distinguish between the so-called physiological reductionists-DuBois Reymond, Briicke, Helmholtz and Ludwig-and the scientific materialists-Vogt, Molleschott and Biichner-whom Merz described ungenerously as "intellects of a lower order." Gregory too accepts this distinction in order to exclude the Berlin physiologists from the main purview of his study. Certainly Hemholtz and company were scientists of much higher calibre than Vogt, Molleschott and Biichner, but wherein lies the difference between the two groups? The new program for physiology announced at Berlin in 1847 denounced described ungenerously described as "intellects of a lower order." Gregory too accepts this distinction in order to exclude the Berlin physiologists from the main purview of his study. Certainly Helmholtz and company were scientists of much higher calibre than Vogt, Molleschott and Biichner, but wherein lies the difference between the two groups? The new program for physiology announced at Berlin in 1847 denounced Naturphilosophie, speculative metaphysics and vitalism just as roundly as the scientific materialists. They too insisted that experimental investigation would reveal nothing in organic phenomena which could not be reduced to physics and chemistry and, ultimately, to the force, matter and motion of mechanics. Lange suggested that the physiological reductionists merely espoused materialism as a methodological maxim of research whereas the scientific materialists raised it to the status of an ontological dogma. This seems to amount to a difference in emphasis rather than in doctrine. Thus Gregory suggests that the difference between the two groups lay in the cautious agnosticism of the physiological reductionists about whether the spiritual and the mental could ever be completely reduced to the material. The scientific materialists confidently asserted what the physiologists merely assumed as a working hypothesis. The physiolo- gists were primarily interested in science, not in politics or social reform. Helmholtz and DuBois Reymond, for example, were political conservatives who easily accommo- dated themselves to the cause of Prussian nationalism and German unification. The major difference then between the scientific materialists and the reductive physiologists lay not in any metaphysical disagreement but in the ideological purposes to which materialism was put. Heinrich Czolbe was regarded as "misleading" by Vogt and Biichner because he attempted to derive a conservative political message from materialism. Czolbe supported 339</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS bourgeois capitalism though he changed his mind about the political system under which it could best be pursued. The case of Czolbe is instructive because it illustrates, if illustration is needed, that there is no necessary connection between materialism and liberal reforming zeal. As Gregory documents, there was no unanimity of political opinion even among the orthodox materialists. At various places in his book Gregory alludes to an alleged contradiction between the political activism of the materialists and their deterministic world-view. In his concluding remarks, he writes: In summarizing the significance of the scientific materialists it is important to note that "materialism" is hardly an appropriate label for the message they preached. Like everyone else, they were men driven by ideals. They were hardly determinists who believed that nothing could be done about the course of events. (p. 213) Gregory suggests that it was only the philosophical crudity and vagueness of men like Vogt which prevented them from realizing the inconsistency between espousing freedom of speech and liberal reform while adhering to a rigid determinism. In reply to Gregory's accusation of inconsistency, I should like to make the following remarks. Leaving aside the question of the psychological motivation to man (the barricades to which Gregory alludes on p. 61), Gregory's charge of inconsistency appears to rest on his identification of determinism with fatalism. Determinism, the doctrine that all events, including human choices, are caused by preceding events and grounded in physical causes, no more entails political apathy than does a belief in a causally unfettered free will. Whatever else the doctrine of free will might be thought to be, it is surely not the view that human actions are capricious and unpredictable, or that their character is independent of brain, environment and education. Concerted political action would seem to require, at the very least, acceptance of the view that changes in present conditions will alter the character of future institutions. The real problem with materialism and its associated doctrine of determinism, and one to which Czolbe, in contrast to Vogt and Biichner, was keenly sensitive, was the problem of deriving moral and political norms from a materialist ontology. But this difficulty has confronted all attempts to construct a system of ethical naturalism based on materialism from the time of Hobbes. The simplest response is to deny that the "is/ought" gap can be successfully bridged and to conclude that there is no possibility of "deriving" in a logical sense, political radicalism from materialism. Attempts to perform the "derivation" are just as likely to conclude with conservatism, as they did in the cases of Hobbes and Czolbe, as with liberalism, depending on one's prior convictions and sentiments. And this is indeed Gregory's conclusion in the opening paragraphs of Chapter IX. If there was a connection between materialism and the drive for liberal reform in the 1850's, it was of a contingent, historical character. The repressive Prussian state had so closely associated itself with the doctrines and the authority of the church that to attack the latter was inevitably, in the prevailing historical context, to attack the former. In the compass of a short review it is not possible to comment on all the themes broached in this rich historical study. Not the least of these is the dispute between Vogt and Marx which the author has explored elsewhere. (See F. Gregory, "Scientific versus Dialectical Materialism: A Clash of Ideologies in Nineteenth-Century German Radicalism," Isis 68 206-223.) Gregory has performed the unenviable task of reading and analyzing a large number of materialist publications which even the unprejudiced reader must acknowledge as philosophically crude and repetitive. The book furnishes a wealth of fascinating information about the materialists who have been largely ignored by English-speaking historians of science in the twentieth century. For this reason alone Gregory's study provides a valuable supplement to the unsympathetic treatment afforded the materialists in F. Lange, The History of Materialism and J. T. Merz, A History of European Thought in the Nineteenth Century and sheds light on a hitherto neglected area in the history of German science. Martin V. Curd, Purdue University 340</page></plain_text>
