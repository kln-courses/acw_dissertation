(As it turns out, inspired by the horde of life-sized terra-cotta warriors unearthed in Xi'an several years ago, in which the heads were individualized but the bodies were identical among members of the same rank, Chu had cast the bears' bodies from the same mold while giv ing each a different head.) They were quite freely painted (mostly in acrylic), each bearing some sort of emblematic sign on its chest, like comic strip superheroes. My fascination with these works came, I believe, from the fact that they seemed to pass so smoothly between the realms of ancient totemic symbols and that of Sunday morning TV, between animistic belief and pop suspension of disbelief. And yet the bemused, quizzical expressions that flitted across those animal features spoke of then all-too-human sense of displacement in whatever world they might find themselves. Along with these six figures, Chu showed six heads (three human, three bear), also in papier rnâché, and a remarkable watercolor "portrait" of a bear's head. With its sly humor of expression and the deeply prepared immediacy of its con struction, this was clearly something more than your typical "sculptor's drawing."

These pieces, dignified entertainers, I began to feel that the rather roughly carved out of separate blocks that marvelously varied expressions that play across Chu has glued together with no thought of hiding their faces are those of people wondering what in the seams, will, like the papier-mâché bears, be the world all these colors are doing to them, painted.
