Some of the French composers-Ravel, for instance, in his 'Jeux d'Eau'-are beginning to realise the uses to which the glassy timbres of the higher notes of the pianoforte might be put; but the composer for the pianoforte pure and simple will always be hampered by the limitations of the hands. It is only by a sort of orchestration of the pianoforte that its full resources will be revealed; and that orchestration can be realised only by composers who know how to write for the piano-player as a quite new and unique instrument. MUSICAL CRITICISM. BY COLIN MCALPIN. In a question of this sort, where there is so much ambiguity of thought and divergence of opinion, let it at once be admitted that we must make allowance for differences in temperament, all of which are worthy of a generous consideration. Tastes differ in art as in other human pursuits. Whilst a certain type of musician may get on very well with Strauss, Schonberg might conceivably 'get on his nerves.' One man's meat is another man's poison. And this is singularly true of art. Not being an exact science, art depends largely on the original endowment and natural predilection of the artist, critical or creative. Neither does this invalidate beauty, as an organon of truth, in any one of its many forms and aspects. It really only means that truth, in terms of the beautiful, is-as distinct from science or philosophy-an imaginative and eclectic affair. In art we differ because we differ in ourselves. It is the expression of the immortal soul and interior personality of man. Unlike science, which pays no heed to diversity in human nature, art is the necessary outcome of what we are in our inmost selves. Whilst the one seeks to establish truth from without, the other strives to express truth from within. Just, therefore, as characters differ, so, too, do the various schools of art. And just as differences in character make for the enrichment and diversity of life, so the varied types of beauty, musical or otherwise, make for the enhancement of all that is artistic. The world is but a gallery of men and women, in diverse postures, colours, and adornments; and to walk this glittering gallery of life's array is to be charmed and surprised by the infinite variety of humanity. So one composer may represent a certain kind of character in his music, and another may represent a character of a totally different kind; whilst both are fulfilling a very real function in the realm of aesthetic expression. This, moreover, need not blind us to the fact that there is some perfect type of humanity which gathers up, in one supreme focus, the best that is in each one of us. And the composer who could express in orderly complexity and unified diversity the many facets of the human soul would go a long way towards voicing perfection in man. Just, therefore, as there is a perfect character, so, too, is there some perfect type of musical beauty which makes it one with moral, spiritual truth,-a perfectly beautiful soul animated by a harmonius faculty, a tuneful talent dominated by a complete character. But myriad-minded man is, at best, but a finite, bounded creature; and it is given to no one concreted personality to give expression, musical or otherwise, to the absolute and infinite in beauty. Even the many-sided Shakespeare of consummate craft has failed to limn for us the portrait of the purely spiritual man. And the natural inference to be drawn from all this is that it is by no means a sign of musical superiority to belaud one type of music and belittle another; it is rather a sign of musical-mental limitation. To fail to appreciate what is good in others is to confess the lack of it in ourselves. Tyndall, in a presidential address of many years ago, has a finely-worded passage which, were we to substitute the names of some of the great composers, would read pertinently enough. He said: The world embraces not only a Newton but a Shakespeare, not only a Boyle but a Raphael, not only a Kant but a Beethoven, not only a Darwin but a Carlyle. Not in each of these, but in all, is human nature whole. They are not opposed, but supplementary; not mutually exclusive, but reconcilable. We must, then, respect the constitutional bias and temperamental tendency of the artist. Every man's art is imbued with his own individuality: every man's appreciation is tinctured with his own disposition. For art, which emanates from the free play of imagination, is mostly indebted for its functional origination to the affectional activities of soul. And its very freedom should put a curb upon the strictures of unbridled dogmatism. There are, for instance, not a few ingenuous souls who see in art the not too serious mission to enliven and exhilarate, rather than to edify and enthuse. Music, to such, is but a pleasing pastime; the sport of fancy and the play of thought. To such as these, the gay-if not frivolous, the pleasant-if not superficial, makes most appeal. Others, again, have natures more intense and deeply earnest. They are the prophetic souls who crave some intimation from the great 'Within'; who yearn for some unveiling of the great 'Unseen,' some revelation of the great 'Unknown.' To such, therefore, music must come as an inspiration, a divine assurance; some echo of the 'still, small voice' of the invisible Singer within the veil. To them-mostly unsophisticated souls, though mystically touched beyond the ordinary type of men- it is as some friendly hand outstretched from the curtained darkness of a vexed and tangled world. It is recorded of the big-souled Beethoven that, on hearing of the loss of some poor widow but recently bereaved, he led her gently to the pianoforte and played her one of his compositions-tones of tender sympathy which did more to alleviate her heart of sorrow than any discourse of the learned mind. His consolatory music wrought in her a change of heart: it found for her a heavenly peace and lasting calm of soul. Full of gratitude, her only word of thanks was a faltering-' now I understand.' But there are other tuneful souls who are natively fearful and timid of attributing to music the power of spiritual persuasion. They hear only its message of sensuous sound: they heed its ministry of sensorial pleasure alone. Even some meritorious musicians will smile at a moral interpretation of their art. They fall foul of a purely idealistic view of music, forgetful of the one supreme fact that all true art has dealings with the ideal alone. And this is peculiarly true of music, whose ethereal essence is so surely touched to finer issues of the beautiful. An unidealistic musician is an anomaly: a prosaic composer is a strange phenomenon. But let us regard our subject from a comparative point of view; it will help us greatly in our attempt at estimating the delicate office of musical criticism, as well as the many subtle difficulties it has to encounter. Now criticism is most at home when dealing with tangible ideas and definite statements. Hence, whilst we may either assent to, or dissent from, the findings of the intellect, we either approve, or disapprove, of works of the imagination. That is to 397</page><page sequence="2">THE MUSICAL TIMES.-SEPTEMBER I, 19I7. say: whereas truth exists to be apprehended, beauty with thoughts, not things ; whilst in the other we are exists to be appreciated. Science, therefore, which dealing not even with thoughts so much as with explains, deals with clear and precise conceptions, temperamental tendencies current in the mind. and so incites to accuracy of judgment: art, on the Though we speak of form in music, and of scansion in other hand, which expresses, arouses in us certain poetry, musical design and poetic metre bear no conditions of mind, and so excites our indefinable comparable resemblance to the mensurable, spatial enthusiasm.

We can either agree, or Length of line, again, in poetry is not the same as disagree, with a theory of science; but we either like length of line in drawing. Though we speak of 'feet' or dislike a work of art. We can prove a proposition, in metrical verse, they cannot be submitted to any but not a poem: we can prove a statement, but not a standard of lineal measurement. The fact is, neither symphony. It is the difference between proof and poetry nor music has anything to do with the metrical approval, the letter of dogma and the spirit of truth: properties of space. When we speak of rising to the it is the difference between intellect and character, heights of aesthetic enthusiasm, we do not exactly think logic and love.

Though we speak can be compared, by which they may be adjudged. of orchestration as the ' chemistry of sound,' we cannot We speak here, of course, comparatively ; since every put an overture into a crucible, or a symphony into a painter may adopt a colour-scheme of his own, every glass-retort. In other words, science is either correct sculptor is free to group his objects as he wills. or incorrect, whereas art may be either worthy or Further, a similar relation exists between the useful unworthy of our admiration. and fine arts, respectively, as that which exists Thus whilst science must be either right or wrong, between science and art as a whole. Thus you cannot art can be either good or bad, with innumerable speak of a piece of music, poem or picture, as being shadings off from the one to the other. Being so either good or bad, in the same way that you can a closely allied to character, art shares with it just such, piece of workmanship. For when we pass from finer moralistic graduations as make so difficult the craft to creativeness, from artifice to art, the same many ethical problems which the more exacting measurements no longer obtain : when we pass from casuist has to face. On the other hand, science, of comparative utility to pure beauty, our standards of its very nature, aims at an irreversible judgment, value undergo a change. The truth is, as we ascend a frank committal. Here there are no nuances of, into the rarer altitudes of the finer arts, we come up thought, no shades of meaning, as in poetry; no against just those subtle lights and shades, those melting moods, no transient phases, as in music.

This, moreover, at least, is the one desirable objective of the scientific is singularly true of music which says nothing we can mind. Hence art and science are not so much deny, and whose measuring-rod lies hidden in the soul. opposing as complementary opposites. They are Art, then, being so much a matter of character, we supplementary to one another. (It must not be so often mistake our personal predilections for the forgotten, however, that even in science our reading inexorable standards of taste. Indeed, much of what of nature is, in a sense, anthropomorphic.) we call artistic opinion is but thinly-veiled prejudice: But herein creeps the difficulty of musical criticism. much of what we call asthetic conviction is but For music is more an influence of which we either concentrated bias. This is because we apprise art approve or disapprove. It has for its aesthetic mission instinctively: we apprehend beauty intuitively. For the inward renewal of soul. It behoves us, therefore, our love of beauty is not the result of logic, our not only to be catholic in our tastes, but broad- appreciation of art in no way depends on argument; minded also in our judgment. No man can prove it results from an insight which moves amidst the a man's admiration for a certain kind of music to be finer discriminations of the soul. Unlike science either right or wrong ; no one can prove a certain which is objective, art is nothing if not essentially type of composition to be either good or bad, in the subjective. And music, which is the soul of art, is same sense that one can prove conclusively a esthetic subjectivity itself. Hence the uncertain mathematical comnutation. What we most need. deliverances of the musical critic. For we have but then, is a sort of 'higher criticism' which estimates, beyond all other things, the attitude of soul the music takes; nor pays too great a heed to the unessential accidents of art. Similarly, the more formal and definite a work of art, the more liable it is to decisive criticism. Roughly speaking, the relation which science bears to art is in a sense similar to the relation which plastic beauty bears to beauty which is shapeless. We can say of a picture, for instance, that it is out of drawing, and of a building that it is out of proportion; since here we have something externally defined-lines and lineaments, curves and contours, that are measurable in space. But this is scarcely so with the more delicate measures of poesy, or with the more subtle spirit of music. Since in the one case we are dealing to pass from the objective to the subjective, whether in the arts or sciences, when critical criteria become increasingly less determinate and sure. So we judge the artistic with a distinctive part of our being: we see the beautiful in and through the medium of our own human nature. That is to say, man to a very large extent admires art with his character-facultative ability, of course, being granted. In the realm of beauty, we like mostly what we are. Faculty, therefore, is not enough; there must be the inscrutable soul behind the faculty, else were it no art at all, only artifice. So the ideal critic must, first of all, be an uncompromising humanist; after which he may be as learned as he likes, as adequately versed as it is possible to be in all things apper- taining to the theory and technique of his art. 398</page><page sequence="3">THE MUSICAL TIMES.-SEPTEMBER I, I9I7. Hence all genuine art has a moral flavour about it which is denied the exactitude of science. In other words, the character of the man enters very largely into his critical calculations of the aesthetic: his likes and dislikes, which so often betray the inward condition of mind, play no inconsiderable part in his judgment of the artistic. Indeed, musical criticism depends greatly on the psychological condition of the critic. Even the same piece of music will appeal to the same auditor differently on different occasions. This, since artistic appreciation is intensive, and so liable to a scale of graduation. It relies so very much on the depth and extent of our feeling capacity for the kind and degree of impression a musical work will make. On the other hand, a geometrical truism-such as two sides of a triangle are greater than the third-will be agreed upon whether we are elated or depressed, deep or shallow. The one is an appeal to personal feeling, the other to impersonal knowledge. And where there is feeling, personal persuasion tempers our judgment, and opinion becomes debatable. This is why men of science differ less from one another than men of art, who differ so greatly among themselves. Art is moral in its power of expression : science is mental in its capacity for explanation. Nevertheless, let it be parenthetically stated that musical criticism, in this country at least, is mostly uniformly fair, disinterested, and enlightened. So we have the genial Haydn and the assertive Handel, the reticent Schubert and the lovable Schumann, the masterful Wagner and the pushful Strauss. Indeed, there is much unworthy nonsense talked about the 'artistic temperament,' as if it existed to the exclusion of every other type of character save its own. And what is true of the creative composer is true also of the critic. Some are architecturally inclined- they prefer the stately Handel to the poetic and romantic Chopin. Others are of the quasi-mystical order, and incline towards the sinuous windings of a Debussy rather than to the logistical artifice of a Bach. Some favour the dramatic-they appreciate Wagner, where the constructional classicism of Beethoven would make a lesser appeal. Others, again, prefer the pure, unadulterated milk of a Mozart to either the strong meat of a Reger or the intoxicating liquor of a Strauss. Yet all have their own peculiar merit. And why not? Surely a course of Brahms might well serve as an antidote to the bewildering mystification of much of our modern music; and a dose of Scriabin, wisely administered, might con- ceivably act as a corrective to much of the heavy- footed, leaden-hearted music of the past. So, too, is it with poetry. Some appreciate the simple stanzas of a Gray, whilst the recondite Browning fails to attract. Others, again, there are who take a pleasure in severer measures of poetic thought, finding a certain fascination in the pompous periods of a Pope; whereas Keats, the poet's poet, would seem to evanesce in an unsatisfying insubstantiality. What right, then, have we to dictate to a man what he shall say, and how exactly he shall say it? Surely we should try and see a beauty-truth from every man's own point of view, though this is rather a painter's than a musician's way of putting it. The fact is, the first principle of a just and genuine criticism is not to be found in the mind's attitude which stands aloof and views things from afar, nor yet in thrusting one's own individuality in between ourselves and that which we seek to criticise; it consists rather in entering sympathetically into the mental workings of the creative soul. This way, and this way alone, ensures a real, appreciative understanding of the work of others. Some poetasters of to-day affect, for instance, to scoff at the pellucid Tennyson. He is, for them, too anaemic, too invertebrate and effeminate. And the same has been said of Mendelssohn, his counterpart in music. Polite and polished-Yes ! but of serious account-No! Yet the virile Wagner admired Mendelssohn, though the admiration was unfortunately unrequited. On handling one of Wagner's scores for the first time, Mendelssohn, it is said, deliberately turned it upside down, and sarcastically inquired which was the right way to read it. Truly the path of criticism is a thorny one, for the high road thereof is strewn with many a shattered reputation. Time will respect no man's verdict unless it is based on the most comprehensive understanding of humanity. 'THE THEORY OF HARMONY.'* BY G. H. CLUTSAM. Since Rameau formulated his principles of harmonic inversion, there has been no attempt at anyindependent examination of the musical material offered in the discovery. The possibility of making ways and means of teaching music more in keeping with its psycho- logical rather than its physiological aspect has suffered a curious neglect despite the recognition of the part the psychological processes of the creative musician has played in the development of the art, or the fact that the old principles have failed utterly in establish- ing their influences on modern art. Music set out, in its earliest simplicity, subject to a certain allowance of fixed principles which, in their ultimate expansion, were determined in their fundamental truths as fluctuating and variable. The proper and logical sensing of harmonic sounds by instinctive musicians inevitably displaced the early mathematical considerations that hampered their art; but the theorist, in a natural but misplaced endeavour to keep his own particular significance to the fore, always managed to stumble across various tricks of applying his science to new discoveries in combinations, confusing issues and staying progress to a degree that is not yet thoroughly recognized or appreciated. He has certainly assisted many individualities to the title of musician who have never been intended by nature for anything of the sort, and he has certainly placed obstacles in the way of early promise and feeling that have only been surmounted by the irresistible call that urges selected personalities on an inwardly-defined career. It is an extraordinary fact that no musician of genius (as revealed by his music) has ever attempted to describe his method of work or lay down any theory that would apply to his own special technical resources or those of his brother working artist. To cite Schonberg's elaborate and stodgy text-book would require admission of his genius; but in any case, with the exception of a few pages at the end, his volume only goes over the old ground of his forerunners, with a thoroughly Teutonic exhaustiveness and verbosity thrown in, elucidating nothing, with an air of having achieved something stupendous in the practical. The real secret of musical creation has passed from chosen spirit to spirit down the ages in a wonderful and mysterious fashion. The gradual growth and expansion of material was scarcely ever defined, and bore no semblance to the ordered development of a system. Strange to say, nothing added to the vocabulary of music can claim an actual discoverer, * 'The Theory of Harmony: an Inquiry into the Natural Principles of Harmony, with an Examination of the Chief Systems of Harmony from Rameau to the Present Day.'
