<plain_text><page sequence="1">IDEALS OF SCIENCE AND FAITH. Essays by various authors. Edited by Rev. J. E. Hand. New York: Longmans, Green &amp; CO., I904. PP. xix, 333. This interesting volume is put forward as a proclamation of peace after the long warfare between science and faith. What led the editor to collect the- several papers that constitute it was the belief that there are many ideals common to scientist and theo-</page><page sequence="2">io6 International Journal of Ethics. logian, that these common ideals are precisely the ones which the nobler spirits in both camps care most about, and that a clearer definition of the aims and ideals of science and religion will help to restore harmony and substitute cooperation for conflict. The approach to a common ground is described by ten different writers, six of them speaking from the standpoint of science, four from that of faith. Sir Oliver Lodge describes "A Physicist's Approach"; Professor J. Arthur Thomson and Professor Patrick Geddes, "A Biological Approach"; Professor J. H. Muirhead, "A Psychological Approach"; Mr. Victor V. Branford, "A Socio- logical Approach"; Hon. Bertrand Russell, "An Ethical Ap- proach"; and Professor Patrick Geddes, "An Educational Approach." And, from the side of faith, the Rev. John Kelman describes "A Presbyterian Approach"; the Rev. Ronald Bayne, "A Church of England Approach"; Mr. Wilfred Ward, "A Church of Rome Approach," while the Rev. Philip Napier Waggett's contribution bears the somewhat misleading title: "The Church as Seen from the Outside." 1His contribution is, in fact, an exposi- tion of the inside view of the church, prefaced by the claim that one who views the church from the outside is not really viewing the church unless he takes the inside view. The essays were written independently of one another, and from as many points of view as there are writers; so it would be too much to expect any organic unity in the work, or any close agreement between the different writers as to the common ground. It is, however, a significant evidence not only of a growing tolera- tion on both sides but also of an earnest desire for some better mutual understanding, that such men can meet in friendliness between the covers of a single book, each undertaking to present the larger bearings of the problem in his special field. And yet the results reached by the several writers are not only different; they are, some of them, in irreconcilable conflict. It is, and should be, a war to the death between them. The editor's optimism seems hardly justified in the results; the proclamation of peace is at best a temporary, and perhaps not wholly wise, armistice. One cannot refrain from quoting in this connection the words of the Rev. Ronald Bayne (used by him in reference to differences among Christians): "But what is the moral value to us of our toleration? It may mean, it very largely does mean, merely that we think more of comfort and less of duty than our forefathers did. Cruelty is a detestable vice; but pain is not the worst evil;</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews. I07 and if we have left off burning each other only or mainly because it hurts, we are not therefore stronger or braver. Softness, not holiness, is our achievement" (p. 263). Sir Oliver Lodge, after noting the apparently irrepressible con- flict between science and faith, suggests that possibly philosophical idealism might solve the difficulty were it not for the unfortunate fact that philosophy is merely poetry. One thing, however, he holds to be certain: influences from the spiritual realm, if they act ever, act now. Telepathy and similar-phenomena seem to imply such action now. And all facts must be included in reality, the so-called spiritual, and the vital which refuse to be reduced to the physical, quite as legitimately as the physical. Science can- not, in the very nature of the case, negative the beliefs which are the foundation of religion. Men of religion are beyond the pale of science but inside the universe of fact, and "so long as this region is ignored dogmatic science should be silent" (p. 37). The view that he reaches, as faintly hinted by science, is a sort of anthropomorphic pantheism tolerant of faith rather than of the theologian. It is the saint and the prophet that humanity trusts rather than the theologian (p. 35). They and their experiences are facts, whatever be the fate of the theologian's logic, and, that being the case, "the region of religion and the region of a com- pleter science are one" (p. 48). The conclusions reached by Professors Thomson and Geddes in their most interesting paper on the "Biological Approach," may also be characterized as, in the main, a hopeful negative. The bulk of this paper is devoted to a consideration of "some biological problems the provisional solutions of which tend to be at variance with theological doctrines." Biological analysis, it is true, "works and must work in a direction the very opposite of that of theo- logical interpretation." Yet even if this analysis were complete it would not reduce all to the level of dead matter, but would rather indicate that there is no such thing as "dead matter" any- where (p. 53 if). The biological view of heredity does not, as is sometimes supposed, commit one to fatalism, for "each living creature is born a new creature-an individuality." "Some free- dom is born with it just because it is something new." And we must not overlook the fact that "there is variation as well as con- tinuity" (pp. 59, 6o). The evolution theory is not necessarily at variance with a religious interpretation of experience, for "the process reads like a story of growth, like the working out of a big</page><page sequence="4">io8 International Journal of Ethics. idea" (p. 64). The biological doctrine of man, making him simply "part and parcel with the rest of creation," is admitted to present grave difficulties. But if the theologian, instead of repeat- ing the phraseology of the past, will only restate his doctrine of man in the idiom of our own time, there is room for hope that harmony may be restored even here. And as for the ethical aspect of biological science, there is no such conflict as Huxley supposed to exist, for it is possible, within the limits of science, to view nature as a "materialized ethical process." The upshot of the matter is that the divergence is "needlessly exaggerated by forgetting essential differences in aims and methods, 'faith' and 'science' being expressions of quite distinct moods" (p. 73). Yet it is idle, the authors hold, to pretend that the biological doctrine of man squares with its theological ana- logue. And, moreover, the differences are partly due to a disa- greement in regard to the "facts of the case." "At present there are a number of conclusions on both sides which cannot be hur- riedly abandoned, which cannot, however, be mutually accepted. There is no use crying 'peace, peace,' when there is no peace" (p. 74). Something, however, the authors think may be done toward reaching the desired higher synthesis by recognizing "what is common in the ideals at least of the two outlooks": Intel- lectually, the biologist is striving to establish inductively the "Unity of Nature," and is thus "approaching one aspect of the theologian's idea of God." Etotionally, the general result and ideal of biology is to deepen our wonder in the world, our love of beauty, our joy in living," and thus we approach another aspect of the theologian's idea of God. Practically, biology reveals pos- sibilities of betterment, of saving, strengthening, and regenerating men, and thus approaches a third aspect of the theologian's idea of God (pp. 75 ff). The paper closes with the suggestion that the "development of the theologian, and of theology itself, may be recognized as the continual endeavor to express and symbolize, for the individual and for the race, the mystery, the process, the ecstasy, the agony, the progress, and the ideals of life." The end, after all, is action, life; and when the theologian, become again at once symbolist and thinker, can offer biology the interpretation of life, biology must again become the handmaid of religion (p. 8o). Professor Muirhead, in his discussion of the "Psychological Approach," contributes an admirably lucid and condensed state-</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews. lo9 ment of the present attitude of psychology with regard to the relation of mind and matter, and the limited application of me- chanical principles of interpretation. Modern developments of psychology show that the door is open to a more spiritual view of the world than, a generation ago, seemed possible, and removes "the difficulty that comes from the opposition of the physical and the mental, and from the apparent secondariness of the latter in the order of creation" (p. ioi). Mr. Bertrand Russell's discussion of the "Ethical Approach" presents the sharpest contrast with the somewhat facile optimism of the preceding papers. His view, put forth with exceptional brilliancy, is sombre and paradoxical. The universe, according to him, cares nothing for man's hopes and fears. "That man is the product of causes which had no prevision of the end they were achieving; that his origin, his growth, his hopes and fears, his loves and his beliefs, are but the outcome of accidental collo- cations of atoms; that no fire, no heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling, can preserve an individual life beyond the grave; that all the labors of the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday brightness of human genius, are destined to extinc- tion in the vast death of the solar system, and that the whole temple of man's achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins-all these things, if not quite beyond dispute, are yet so nearly certain, that no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand. Only within the scaffolding of these truths, only on the firm foundation of unyielding despair, can the soul's habitation henceforth be safely built" (pp. I58, I59). Our ideals of truth, beauty, and perfection do not meet with the approval of the unconscious universe. Fact and ideal are in hope- less opposition. Man's life is brief and powerless, a long march through the night, whereas, "blind to, good and evil, reckless of destruction, omnipotent matter rolls on its relentless way" (p. i69). Surely we had a right to expect from one who knows as well as Mr. Russell does how science is made something better than this outburst of dogmatic materialism in the name of science. How- ever, it is on this very platform of despair that religion, according to Mr. Russell, emerges with the "great renunciation." Submit to the power that is omnipotent, cast off the load of eager and fretful desires, yield up the self, and lo! the stoic freedom of the mind is yours, the forces of fate are conquered, and your brief day may be brightened while it lasts by the unconquerable vision of lofty</page><page sequence="6">HO International Journal of Ethics. thoughts. Mr. Russell's view is a sort of idealization of Nietsche. The Uebermensch is not a physical but an intellectual Titan who from the free and cold mountain tops of contemplation views the supreme tragedy that nature presents with calm enjoyment and doemonic aloofness. The god of such a religion is frankly a man-made god, and, moreover, it is a god fashioned rather in the epicurean than the stoic likeness,-considering its ineffectualness in this "petty planet on which our bodies impotently crawl," and in the material and unconscious universe generally. And, in truth, lacking the stoic's Logos, Mr. Russell's intellectual stoicism is left without any logical foundation, the mere illogical reaction of an individual temperament confronting a desperate situation. Professor Patrick Geddes' discussion of the "Educational Ap- proach" defends the thesis that technical education tends to develop the homely virtues that constitute the substance of the ethical code of all religions; and that, in the liberal education, if the advocates of the " new" and the "old," free school and church school, would each eliminate the "dry rot" in their teaching, the vital remnants might unite and form a better system of education in which the claims of science would be respected and those of religion would not be ignored. As to Mr. Branford's paper on the "Sociological Approach," the present reviewer must confess that he found it too diagram- matic to be clear; and he is unable to see how it can contribute to bring science and faith together except in a most formal and external manner. Coming to the theologians, the Rev. John Kelman, speaking for the Presbyterians, contents himself with showing that where Presbyterians in former days have been in collision with science the hostility has been due to a misunderstanding. The only war- fare is that between reason and superstition. For the rest, science, he holds, like religion, rests ultimately upon faith. The thought of the uniformity of nature which science demands finds its basis in the belief in the "absolute dependence of all things upon God both for their origin and in their endurance" (p. 224). Tracing in briefest outline the course of Presbyterianism from Calvin to the higher critics, he finds in "Presbyterian faith the basal principle of all true science-the demand for unity and order, and the assertion of the rights of intellect" (p. 245). One may, indeed, ask for further argument than this essay offers in support of these positions somewhat dogmatically af-</page><page sequence="7">Book Reviews. I l I firmed, and one could wish that the author had undertaken to show how the intellect reaches a rational theology of more posi- tive content than that which is contained in the above meagre statement of the common bond between science and faith; but we are still within the limits of the general discussion, as its pur- pose is defined by the editor in his preface. Theologian and scientist are endeavoring to get together. But in passing to the remaining three articles in this volume we enter an entirely dif- ferent atmosphere. These papers are characterized by a certain complacent deafness to the din of the battle. The writers simply take for granted all those religious beliefs which modern scientific deliverances make difficult of acceptance. They have "different data," a "richer experience," and seem to think that when ideals of faith are being considered the appearance of doubts and diffi- culties suggested by science is an irrelevant intrusion, as well as a tiresome nuisance (cf. pp. 273 ff) .1 In this respect the scien- tists make a better showing for candor than the theologians. It may be true that there are certain facts of religious experience which lie outside the pale of any and every science, and which compel a final religious interpretation of the world. We have found the scientists in this work admitting as much. But if this is true it would be more to the point, in such a symposium as this, to show that the ideals of faith grounded in these religious facts give a view of reality which is not in opposition to the actual results and valid ideals of science-though it may well enough be in hopeless opposition to certain current scientific dogmas, and to certain popular, but over-hasty generalizations of scientific conclusions. We should like to have these theologians describe the ideals of faith, having explicitly in view such troublesome and disturbing conclusions of modern science as, for example, those referred to in the present volume by Mr. Russell, and by Professors Thomson and Geddes. When, instead of this, such difficulties are lightly brushed aside by the treacherous doctrine of the in- commensurability of spiritual and natural truth, have we not, with thin disguise, merely a revival of the doctrine of "two truths" on which the medieval church went to shipwreck? The last three papers are written by, and for, those who are 'This position is most definitely stated in the paper contributed by the Rev. Mr. Waggett, but it is clearly implied in the discussion of the Rev. Mr. Bayne, and, though less fundamentally, in that of Mr. Ward.</page><page sequence="8">112 International Journal of Ethics. untroubled by the recent trend of science, whose belief in the reality of spirit is by nature bomb-proof, and who are, moreover, "in the particular condition of obedience, of conversion." And we cannot see how they justify the editor's hope that this volume will show that the ideals common to scientist and theologian are precisely the ideals which the nobler spirits in both camps care most about. These writers are rather concerned in showing that, and how, the Christian ideal involves Christian unity. All three agree that the Christian is ipso facto Churchman; that the church is not a mere piece of machinery in itself unessential, but is rather part of the essence of the gospel. It is needless to add that writers of such ability do not confuse "the Church" with any mere out- ward embodiment of form and ceremonial. They mean the spiritual organism, the kingdom of God, the "holy catholic Church." But they differ among themselves as to the relation of the Church of England and the Church of Rome to this spiritual kingdom. The Rev. Ronald Bayne especially deprecates the civil war of religions. The one fatal error of the non-conformist is his de- sertion of mother church, and his establishment of the so-called free churches. "When the spiritual tide of national life is low," he writes, "the national church will find her schools of thought and temperament inclined to fall apart, and to split into 'free' churches, each trying to isolate itself and refusing to add to its own stature by the hearty vitality of its union with the whole body." His paper is a plea for a national church, and for a return to the Elizabethan ideal where church and state are one, and where spiritual religion controls the forms of political life. Mr. Wilfred Ward regards the Roman Church as the appointed depositary and jealous guardian of the ideals of faith, and holds that it serves a beneficent purpose in being "a drag upon scientific advance"; it thus prevents over-great hastiness in the reconstruc- tion of one's views of the universe on the basis of a science with religion left out; while, at the same time, it gradually assimilates the assured results of science. But it is not conceivable that the ideal of religious unity in the bond of a genuine spiritual organism may be upheld in a broader and more truly catholic spirit than that in which these writers conceive their churchmanship? Underneath their efforts lies the ineradicable belief that complete rationalism is anti- religious. There is no hope of bringing into harmony the ideals</page><page sequence="9">Book Reviews. 113 of science and faith as long as miraculism is interposed as a barrier to create the doctrine of "two truths." What is needed is a fear- less return on the part of our religious teachers to the point of view that made the true theology one with the true philosophy. And then, in order to meet the modern situation and effect the genuine synthesis desired, there is further need of the master mind of another St. Thomas, who, without mistaking for facts of religious experience the reputed happenings of a particular re- ligious tradition, shall restate, and in the idiom of our day, the ideals of faith.
