Ulman Boston University and Massachusetts General Hospital GREIF, ESTHER BLANK, and ULMAN, KATHLEEN J. The Psychological Impact of Menarche on Early Adolescent Females: A Review of the Literature. CHILD DEVELOPMENT, 1982, 53, 1413- 1430. This paper reviews research on the psychological impact of onset of menstruation (menarche). Menarche is an important event for all girls, yet there is relatively little research on this topic, and the existing research contains a number of conceptual and methodological problems. In this paper, we review attitudes toward menarche and personality characteristics of pubertal girls. Then we look at memories of menarche from late adolescents and adult women. Finally, we examine studies of the impact of timing (early and late menarche). Overall, the studies indicate that menarche is a memorable and significant event for girls. Frequently the experience is perceived negatively, but there is also a positive, integrating result to menarche. Factors influencing the psychological impact of menarche include age at time of first period, social factors, amount of preparation, and cultural factors. The paper focuses on research prob- lems and provides suggestions for future research. Early adolescence is a period marked by rapid physical and psychological changes. While both pubertal boys and girls need to ad- just to new role expectations, they experience different physical changes. For girls, the onset of menstruation is a unique and concrete event which marks puberty. The term "menarche" re- fers to the first menstrual period in a girl's life. Whereas other pubertal changes occur grad- ually (e.g., breast development), menarche is unique in that it occurs suddenly and without warning, and it involves bleeding. As the most discrete event of female puberty, menarche is a signpost of physical maturity and fertility. De- spite the importance of menarche for girls, until recently there has been little research on this topic. In this paper, we review the research literature on the impact of menarche on psycho- logical and social functioning of females, and we examine conceptual and methodological issues related to research in this area. Theoretical Issues Psychoanalytic theorists were the first to pay attention to menarche as a major develop- mental milestone. Helene Deutsch (1944) be- lieved that the psychological reaction to men- strual blood is tied in part to the female castra- tion complex, but also reflects cultural attitudes. In her writings, she suggested that a menstrual taboo exists in the unconscious of Western cul- tures, and this taboo affects girls' reactions to menstruation. In support of this view, she points out that mothers conceal their own menstrua- tion from their daughters, and that girls often resist learning about menstruation fromn their mothers because they have experienced their mothers' menstruation as unclean and disgust- ing. Further, Deutsch described women's psy- chological reactions to menarche as having a common root of anxiety "in which the ap- proaching adulthood and sexuality are experi- enced as a threatening danger" (1944, p. 156).

At this time, conflict between reproductive functions and sexuality comes to the forefront. She explained the postmenarcheal depression that some girls experience as a disappointment that they are not magically changed by the event. In sum, Deutsch saw the experience of menarche as in- evitably traumatic, since it is influenced by primitive unconscious beliefs that menstruation is dangerous, unclean, and to be avoided, and by unconscious anxiety related to female sex- uality and reproductive ability. Clara Thompson (1942) also supported the psychoanalytic view of menarche as trau- matic. In discussing Freud's concept of penis envy, she pointed out that, at menarche, Vic- torian girls experienced a loss of freedom, power, and spontaneity and suggested it was this real loss which made them envy boys and their po- sition of freedom and control. She also thought that the cultural denial of menarche and men- struation led to a decrease in self-esteem in ado- lescent girls. Other psychoanalytically oriented theorists have described menarche as a potentially posi- tive event in a girl's development. Kestenberg (1964) suggested that prepubertal girls go through a stage of disorganization which is ended by menarche. Onset of menstruation serves as a reference point from which the young girl can organize her experiences. Unlike the premenarcheal girl, who has only fantasies, the postmenarcheal girl has both reality and fantasy which she can compare. "The sharpness of the experience, the regularity of it, the same- ness of the experience as compared with her own anticipation of it, and the experience of others-all these provide relief" (Kestenberg 1967, p. 34). Despite her emphasis on positive aspects, Kestenberg does admit that menarche can become traumatic if a girl is not adequately prepared. Other psychoanalysts (Blos 1962, 1971; Hart &amp; Sarnoff 1971) also consider menarche a positive organizing influence, which helps a girl to define boundaries. Blos stresses the value of a close relationship between a girl and her mother at this time, in order to help the girl deal with the changes in her life. Hart and Sarnoff distinguish between the premenarcheal confusion and the postmenarcheal period, which is characterized by clear organization of the ego, due to a well-defined body image. Anthropologists have emphasized the im- pact of menarche in various cultures, based on the meaning of the event in the culture (Bene- dict 1934, 1954; Mead 1928, 1949, 1952). Mead maintains that the psychological impact of menarche is in part determined by its mean- ing in a particular culture. Both Benedict and Mead suggest that the experience of menarche in our culture is stressful and potentially trau- matic because of the absence of well-defined rituals surrounding menarche and the "men- strual taboo" in general. Other writers of issues specific to adoles- cents have discussed the relevance of men- struation as an influence on self-image. Douvan (1970) maintained that the hormonal fluctu- ations related to the menstrual cycle cause fe- males to be confused by their bodies and their internal states, and instead they look to the ex- ternal world for information about themselves. As a result, menstruation can have a negative effect on self-esteem. Bardwick (1971) also discussed negative effects of menstruation and emphasized the lack of positive reactions to menarche in our society. Unlike other theories which focus primar- ily on one aspect of the impact of menarche, Petersen's (1980a) model of biopsychosocial development attempts to explain development of females at puberty by looking at the inter- actions of biological, social, and psychological influences. With this model, Petersen takes into account an individual's psychological history (e.g., self-esteem, gender identity) when look- ing at changes which seem to result from men- arche. By emphasizing physical changes as well as cultural and psychological factors, Petersen's model adds greater complexity to the concep- tualization of the impact of menarche. In sum, most of the theoretical approaches focus primarily on one aspect of the impact of menarche. The event is viewed as positive or negative, and as socially determined or mainly intrapsychically determined. Petersen's inter- active model takes into account cultural, psy- chological, and biological factors and as a re- sult introduces greater conceptual complexity to this research area. Research Overview Few empirical studies have been designed to test specific theoretical hypotheses. Instead, the research tends to focus on the relationship between menarche and one or two specific vari- ables. Empirical research has looked at the im- pact of menarche on the attitudes, behavior, and personality characteristics of pubertal girls</page><page sequence="3">Greif and Ulman 1415 and women. Our review of the research liter- ature is organized into five sections: attitudes of pubertal girls toward menarche, personality characteristics of pubertal girls, women's mem- ories of menarche, the impact of timing of men- arche (and puberty), and clinical reports. One major problem with research in this area is the lack of consensus about which variables are important to study. In addition, the research contains methodological shortcomings, includ- ing the confounding of age and menarcheal status. We will discuss conceptual and method- ological issues for this research area and will propose directions for future research. Attitudes toward menarche in pubertal girls.-To understand how menarche affects pubertal girls, researchers have compared the attitudes of pre- and postmenarcheal girls to- ward menstruation and their expectations or actual experiences related to menstruation. The comparability of girls in the pre- and post- groups has varied across studies (e.g., similarity of age, grade, etc.). Further, the measures used to assess the impact of menarche have differed across studies. Whisnant and Zegans (1975) used a semi- structured interview to look at attitudes of white, middle-class girls (10 pre- and 15 post- menarcheal). One of the investigators (Whis- nant) interviewed girls during summer camp about their knowledge of menstruation, how they reacted to and announced the first period, and what menarche meant to them. They found that all premenarcheal and most postmenar- cheal girls had received information about men- struation from their mothers, friends, and school personnel before menarche. Few of the girls discussed menarche with their fathers. Despite having some education about menstruation, most girls were not able to explain their in- ternal anatomy or why women menstruate. Moreover, the premenarcheal girls were con- cerned about not knowing what to do when they began to menstruate. The postmenarcheal girls reported being scared and upset at their first period, but could not explain why, since they thought it was "no big thing." One girl states, "'I was really scared-you know what was happening but it came as a surprise. You thought you [sic] know but you didn't"' (p. 812). Several postmenarcheal girls talked about changed relationships with their fathers, and more than 50% reported a change in relationship with their mothers. The authors concluded that, in our culture, menarche is treated as a hygienic crisis rather than a maturational milestone. As a result, the event is more traumatic than girls anticipate. Thus, Whisnant and Zegans support the anthropological view that the cultural de- nial of the importance of menarche results in a negative experience for girls. Their results also fit into the psychoanalytic framework of Deutsch and Thompson. While this study pro- vided a useful beginning to research on girls' experiences and attitudes, utility is limited by the small sample size, the absence of statistical analyses, and the homogeneity of the sample. Since the postmenarcheal group was older (X = 13-2 vs. X = 12-5 for the younger group), age and menarcheal status are confounded. Table 1 contains details of this study. With a similar design, Koff, Rierdan, and Jacobson (1981) gave a sentence-completion task to 34 middle- to upper-middle-class sev- enth- and eighth-grade girls (16 premenarcheal, 18 postmenarcheal). The subjects were given the sentence, "Ann just got her period for the first time" (p. 151), and were instructed to com- plete sentence stems designed to elicit responses to menstruation. The menstrual status of each subject was obtained by self-report. Despite the different measures used by Koff et al. and by Whisnant and Zegans, results were similar. While the premenarcheal girls expected both negative and positive feelings about menarche, the postmenarcheal girls expressed mostly neg- ative experiences and feelings. Both pre- and postmenarcheal girls saw menarche as imposing limitations. Koff et al. reported an increase in self-consciousness in the postmenarcheal girls. The authors concluded that, at least for white, middle-class girls, menarche is a significant ex- perience which can be traumatic. As in the previous study, results are limited by the sam- ple characteristics. Brooks-Gunn and Ruble (1980) and Clarke and Ruble (1978) looked at attitudes toward menstruation. Both studies used the Moos (1968) Menstrual Distress Questionnaire, a mood and behavior rating scale, questions re- garding sources of information about menstru- ation, and questions about attitudes toward menstruation. How menstrual status of subjects was determined was not explained. In the first study (Clarke &amp; Ruble 1978), 36 girls (X = 12-8) answered the Moos Menstrual Dis- tress Questionnaire three times, according to the intermenstrual phase, and (c) according to what they themselves experience or expect to experience in the menstrual phase. Boys of the same age completed the questionnaire twice, but their responses will not be discussed here. Clarke and Ruble found that mothers were the</page><page sequence="4">A .4 4) .4 0 ;- 4-) 4 cd 4-11r o 0 k E 0 O ~I a a e~ 4) P bl)b e 0 I=" 41 3 b0 b 0 0 4-) u bc 0 &gt; S cd c ( 14 Cd 004c d0 Z ;.4 0 Cd ( E ?d E0 C d uyl 0 o Eno E~~o n cd -4 0)cdin in, uP r "0n +j 'd W In ;. 4 0*jd O ~ q .,4 ^ bI D QL (n 0 bolo 4..)4 O% y 0 0--4 c w 0) Im.. - -, ?vl 9/2 cnc brd P-" 0 (nLn ' o 0 u % -, , 44.4 j i bID ? 4) 0 0 ci k~ 0 (n- -4 .. ) -4- I bo 4) Ei +j E o 3E B D 0 d Q) 0) &gt; (nf c 3t - 4$ g "j t C C *d . 4 +j 0 cd g.- v c rCI+j (n 4- bo C)~E 1 ~ , ,) Q) cd ~ o E ba~I200 - C) 0 4) 4-) o ~E00 500M) o00 00 E5u Zu .r.e W4 ' 00 0) 0 -4(n --4 0 bID tn ? c 0 E: 4) C : T-4 q4-4 4-4 U E 0 a cd Q C d 0 Cd Eo = (n d C o o Z.)

Both pre- and postmenarcheal girls were uncomfortable talking about menstruation. Post- menarcheal girls were significantly more neg- ative in their feelings; they believed that men- struation is disruptive of school performance and moods. Premenarcheal girls were not equally negative. There were no meaningful differences between the pre- and postmenar- cheal girls in their expectations of symptoms. Both groups expected more symptoms during the menstrual phase than the intermenstrual phase. In the second study (Brooks-Gunn &amp; Ruble 1980), 259 fifth through eighth graders com- pleted the Moos Questionnaire three times, once for each phase of the cycle (premenstrual, menstrual, and intermenstrual). Half answered according to their own experiences or antici- pated experiences, and half answered for girls in general. The authors found that both pre- and postmenarcheal girls expected other girls to experience more symptoms than they them- selves experienced or expected to experience during the menstrual and premenstrual phases; no differences were expected during the inter- menstrual phase. Girls' reports of symptoms were related to age rather than menstrual sta- tus. The fifth and sixth graders reported fewer differences among the three phases of the cycle than did the seventh and eighth graders. Fur- ther, junior high students disliked menstruation more than elementary school girls, but there were no differences based on menarcheal status. The authors suggest that age rather than men- archeal status affects expectations. However, the younger girls (fifth and sixth graders) were mostly premenarcheal (only nine of 71 had begun menstruating). Moreover, seventh and eighth graders were combined in reports of results. Since these girls could differ in age by as much as 2 years, combining data in this way may mask differences. The study was reported in a book chapter, and details of the analysis were not included. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the findings in detail. Both this study and the one discussed earlier (Clarke &amp; Ruble 1978) used the Moos Menstrual Distress Ques- tionnaire, which was developed for use with adult women. In each study, early adolescent subjects were asked to report physical symp- toms (for themselves or for other women) at different phases of the menstrual cycle. This task may be inappropriate for young girls be- cause of its complexity. The finding that youn- ger girls (fifth and sixth grade) respond differ- ently from seventh and eighth graders may re- flect developmental differences in their ability to complete the task correctly. Even with adult women, these reports of physical and psycho- logical symptoms are not always reliable (Par- lee 1974; Ruble 1977). As a result, the findings from these studies are limited because of the measures used. One major theme of the four studies re- viewed has been the reactions of girls to men- arche: Is the experience positive or negative? Despite differences in measures, three of the four studies found that postmenarcheal girls have more negative attitudes toward menstrua- tion than premenarcheal girls (the fourth study reported no difference), and that they experi- ence more negative emotions than premenar- cheal girls expect to experience. These differ- ences occur despite educational preparation. The studies also found that postmenarcheal girls turn to their mothers at the time of menarche. Together, these studies give us a beginning picture of what the experience of menarche is like for white, middle-class girls. However, we have no information about the experience of menarche among different social classes and ethnic groups. Moreover, the studies tend to dichotomize girls' experiences or expectations into positive or negative; a more complex model of mixed emotions is lacking. Girls may have both positive and negative experiences related to different aspects of menstruation. Measures and data analyses which take into account the range of girls' responses to menarche would give us a more accurate picture of the thoughts and feelings of early adolescent girls. Personality characteristics of pubertal girls. -A number of researchers have examined dif- ferences in personality characteristics or behav- iors of pre- and postmenarcheal girls to deter- mine the impact of menarche on personality functioning. Table 2 summarizes the methods and results of each study. In the 1930s, Stone and Barker compared pre- and postmenarcheal girls in two studies. Subjects completed several objective measures and were interviewed about menstrual status (also, anthropomorphic measures were taken). In the first study (Stone &amp; Barker 1937), mea- sures included the Otis Intelligence Test, the Pressey Interest Attitude Test, the Bernreuter Personality Inventory, and the Sullivan Scale for measuring developmental age in girls. Data analysis was based on responses of 175 pre- and 175 postmenarcheal girls matched for age and SES (X = 13-3) (420 other girls who completed the questionnaires were eliminated</page><page sequence="6">Uo q) .-4) cn cn bo + 4) 0 "-4 4n %).4 44 cn 0 W4, F1~cn w U) 0 d4- cd cn bo 4 o q)e 10. 4 'Cd U) 4)4.-1)~ 4 :~Q-) 4) 0 c~U)U 400 d 4 o cd r &gt; .w 4)4) En 0 4) 2 0 4) En 0 0 4-) ) - k4) 4-) 0 bo 0 w w U d w) Enn En00 ' En a4 4-) 0 cd o 0 4 P ..

Stone and Barker found that the postmenar- cheal girls gave mature responses more fre- quently than the premenarcheal girls on the Pressey and the Sullivan tests. The groups dif- fered in items measuring their responses to per- sonal appearance, heterosexual interests and at- titudes, avoidance of physical exertion, day- dreaming, and home conflicts. Because these same-aged girls who differed primarily on men- strual status also differed on the personality and interest measures, Stone and Barker concluded that the changes associated with physiological maturity are related to changes in attitudes and interests. This study was well controlled and carefully performed. While the measures used are not popular today, the results still are valid and demonstrate that menarche is associated with changes in aspects of personality. In the second study, Stone and Barker (1939) administered items, which differenti- ated between pre- and postmenarcheal girls, as well as questionnaires to 1,000 girls in grades 7, 8, and 9. Subjects were divided into five age groups and then comparisons were made based on menarcheal status. Overall, results were sim- ilar to those of the first study, with responses of postmenarcheal girls differing from those of premenarcheal girls, regardless of age. For ex- ample, the postmenarcheal girls showed more interest in self-adornment and heterosexual be- havior. Together, these studies provide valuable data about differences between pre- and post- menarcheal girls. The studies were done with large sample sizes and with careful attention to methodological details. Data about subjects' behaviors were based on self-reports and there is no way to measure the relationship between self-reports and actual behavior for these girls; as a result, we must be careful with our inter- pretations of the results as representative of actual behavior. Nearly 20 years elapsed before another empirical study examined the impact of men- arche. In 1956, Smith and Powell used the Blacky Picture Test (a projective measure de- signed to assess Freud's psychosexual stages) to measure development in 138 seventh- and eighth-grade girls. With age and SES held con- stant, girls were divided into groups based on menstrual status (determined in an interview with a hygiene teacher). Girls answered 19 questions from the Blacky Picture cards, in a multiple-choice format. Although the groups differed significantly in their responses to six of the 19 questions (e.g., the postmenarcheal girls showed more preference for same-sexed par- ents), the narrow psychoanalytic focus of the questions limits the relevance of the study. The major contribution of the study is that, based on a comparison of same-aged girls who dif- fered on menarcheal status, pre- and postmen- archeal girls do seem to differ. However, we cannot specify the differences based on the limited nature of the measure. Koff, Reirdan, and Silverstone (1978) used a short-term longitudinal design to look at the impact of menarche on human-figure drawings. The Draw-a-Person Test was administered and scored according to a sexual differentiation scale and on the basis of which sex was drawn first. Eighty-seven seventh graders were tested twice with a 6-month interval in between. Men- archeal status was based on girls' responses to a questionnaire. For analysis, girls were divided into three groups: girls who were premenarcheal both times (N = 34), girls who were postmen- archeal both times (N = 23), and girls who went from pre- to postmenarcheal during the study (N = 30). Overall, figure drawings of postmenarcheal girls were more sexually dif- ferentiated than drawings made by premenar- cheal girls. This difference was most apparent for the girls whose menstrual status had changed during the study: their original (premenar- cheal) drawings were significantly less differen- tiated on the basis of sexual characteristics than were the drawings they produced after reach- ing menarche. Further, postmenarcheal girls were more likely than premenarcheal girls to draw female figures first. Finally, there was a tendency for postmenarcheal girls to be more content with their female body features. In addition to providing data on differ- ences between pre- and postmenarcheal girls' body image, this study provides short-term longitudinal data about the impact of menarche. Comparing responses of the same girls before and after the onset of menarche is an excellent way to assess the impact of menarche. The find- ing that same-aged girls produced similar fig- ure drawings only if their menarcheal status was the same (pre- or postmenarche), and that a girls' drawings changed over a 6-month pe- riod only if her menstrual status changed is evidence for the significance of menarche. Whether differences between pre- and postmen- archeal girls exist in other aspects of psycho- logical functioning is a question for future research. Using a similar design and similar mea- sures, Rierdan and Koff (1980a, 1980b) fur- ther investigated the impact of menarche on</page><page sequence="9">Greif and Ulman 1421 body image and psychological functioning. In the first study (1980a), the authors used a cross-sectional design and administered the Draw-a-Person Test and a questionnaire re- garding developmental changes to 94 seventh and eighth graders. (See table 2 for details about the sample.) Results replicated the find- ings of Koff, Rierdan, and Silverstone (1978), with significant differences found for sex of first-drawn figure and degrees of sexual differ- entiation between pre- and postmenarcheal girls. The authors also scored the drawings for anxiety (aggression-hostility, insecurity-lability) to determine if girls' anxiety is different before and after menarche. No differences were found. Rierdan and Koff suggest that menarche is not a traumatic and disruptive experience. How- ever, inferences about anxiety from figure draw- ings are not always valid; therefore, additional research using more objective measures of anx- iety is needed to clarify whether there is a relationship between anxiety and menarche. Finally, Rierdan and Koff compared drawings of postmenarcheal seventh and eighth graders and found that the seventh graders showed greater awareness of sexual differentiation and identity (based on which sex was drawn first). They speculate that, while menarche has a sig- nificant impact, there are phases of the impact, and it peaks in the first 6 months postmenarche. If this finding is valid, then future research needs to be careful not to combine all post- menarcheal girls as if they were the same; rather, we need to take into account time since onset of menstruation. In their second study, Rierdan and Koff (1980b) examined the frequency with which breasts were drawn explicitly on female figures by pre- and postmenarcheal girls. A total of 153 girls participated. Rierdan and Koff found a trend for seventh-grade premenarcheal girls to draw more explicit breasts than postmenar- cheal girls. Also, younger girls produced more explicit drawings than older girls. The authors suggest that during the seventh grade, when the greatest percentage of girls change status from pre- to postmenarcheal, there is an in- creased focus on body changes. This would ac- count for the differences in drawings. Again, we see that the amount of time elapsed since onset of menstruation is an important variable in assessing the impact of menarche. Gardwood and Allen (1979) used the pre- and postmenarcheal design to investigate the impact of menarche on self-concept and inci- dence of problems with school and family. They gave 232 middle- and lower-class girls (122 premenarcheal, 110 postmenarcheal) the Moo- ney Problem Checklist and the Tennessee Self- Concept Scale. Since all lower-class girls were black and all middle-class girls were white, social class and race were confounded. Overall, Garwood and Allen found that postmenarcheal girls had significantly higher scores on the self- concept scale and were significantly better ad- justed. But these girls also listed significantly more problems in the areas of home and family; money, work, and the future; and boy-girl re- lations. There were no significant differences related to length of time since menarche. There were SES differences in certain categories of problems and on parts of the self-concept scale. The authors concluded that menarche has a positive effect on development. This study is of special interest because it included two vari- ables which are usually omitted: SES and length of time since menarche. Unfortunately, the data do not clarify the relationships between these variables and psychological reactions to men- arche. As a group, the studies reviewed in this section support the view that postmenarcheal girls have heightened awareness of and interest in their femininity, as defined by our culture. For example, they are interested in body adorn- ment and boy-girl relations. Further, they seem more mature in certain personality characteris- tics, regardless of chronological age. That is, postmenarcheal girls are more mature than pre- menarcheal girls of the same age, at least on measures used in these studies. In terms of de- sign, pre-post comparisons are useful for as- sessing the relationship between menarche and personality changes. However, since other body changes are occurring at the time of menstrua- tion, it is difficult to attribute differences to menarche alone. The finding that time elapsed since menarche is related to reactions is impor- tant for future research. We need to be careful to match subjects on as many factors as possi- ble, but especially on age and time since the onset of menstruation, to be more confident that menarcheal status is a major differentiat- ing factor. Memories of menarche.--Another source of data about reactions to menarche comes from retrospective accounts of individual experiences. Women, ranging in age from adolescence to 58 years, have been interviewed about their mem- ories of the menarcheal experience. As with all retrospective accounts, the data from these studies are affected by errors in memory and distortions of events (Achenbach 1978). Never- theless, these studies still provide valuable in-</page><page sequence="10">1422 Child Development formation about people's conceptions of pu- bertal events, even if the memories do not match the actual experiences from years earlier. Table 3 contains summaries of the studies de- scribed here. Shainess (1961) asked 103 women to com- plete questionnaires about their menarcheal ex- periences. No information is given about the characteristics of the sample. Shainess reported a relationship between lack of preparation and a sense that menarche was traumatic. She also found a relationship between premenstrual ten- sion and lack of adequate preparation at men- arche. While this study lacks methodological rigor, it provides interesting information about women's thinking about menarche. Whisnant and Zegans (1975) included 10 late adolescents, aged 17-21, in their study of attitudes of pubertal girls (see table 1 and the section on attitudes for details). A majority of the late adolescents (seven of 10) reported be- ing scared or upset when menstruation began. Unfortunately, most of the reported results in this study combine two postmenarcheal groups (aged 12-15 and 17-21). Weideger (1976) collected retrospective reports by questionnaire from 558 women be- tween the ages of 12 and 58, recruited through a magazine advertisement. Fifty-eight percent of the women were between ages 20 and 30. Despite the large sample, the utility of the study is limited because results are not pre- sented in a systematic way (they are mentioned throughout Weideger's book on menstruation) and because the focus is on women's actual re- sponses rather than quantitative summaries of the responses. Also, responses of all subjects are reported together, without regard for the wide age span of subjects. With these limita- tions in mind, it is interesting to note that wom- en's memories of menarche were mostly neg- ative. Moreover, many women recalled that adults were reluctant to discuss menstruation with them, and some women remembered feel- ing unprepared. In addition, a number of women reported feeling a sense of loss when menstruation began: 32% reported feeling they had lost status and self-esteem, and at the same time they had a sense that boys of the same age had increased in power. She also found that many women did not understand the biological function of menstruation. Overall, the responses of these women suggest that they were con- fused and scared when menstruation began-- they were confused about what was happening to their bodies and about others' reactions to these changes. These retrospective self-reports match the theoretical view that menarche is a traumatic experience. Koff, Rierdan, and Sheingold (Note 1) collected retrospective reports on the experience of menarche from college women with a mean age of 19-2 years. The authors were interested in the impact of being prepared for menarche and in the role of age of onset and initial feel- ings. In their sample of 97 women, nine girls who had no preparation at all described men- arche as a negative experience. Of the rest who had some preparation, 60% reported that men- arche was a negative experience. It is interest- ing to note that early maturers reported more negative feelings about menarche. The results suggest that preparation can reduce the neg- ative experiences but does not always eliminate them. Since not all women remembered menar- che negatively, further examination of differ- ences between women with positive and neg- ative memories might clarify factors which in- fluence the experience. A somewhat different sample was used by Logan (1980) in her study of reactions to first menstruation. Logan interviewed 95 foreign women who were in the United States to study English. These women were well educated and not necessarily representative of all members of their country. Nevertheless, the study pro- vides interesting information about menarcheal experiences. Each woman was interviewed in- dividually with questions adapted from Whis- nant and Zegans (1975) concerning prepara- tion for menarche, messages from others at the time of menarche, and emotional reactions to the first period. Overall, Logan found that mothers are a major source of information and are most frequently the only person a girl tells about onset of menstruation. Like the American samples, most girls do not tell friends or family. Most women in this cross-cultural sample re- ported that menarche was an unpleasant experi- ence. These results are similar to other studies. Thus, despite the limitations of this study as a comparison of cultures, the results do provide support for the general finding that women recall having mixed emotions when menstrua- tion begins, and that mothers play an important role at this time. From these retrospective studies, we learn that the memory of the first period is clear in the minds of most women; almost no subjects said they could not remember when they first menstruated or how they felt at the time. The findings of these studies parallel results from</page><page sequence="11">oo 4) cn c~0 0 0E 0 Cd ?r *C 41 bo bo..d j.4 P.4o~ 7 0 7 a cnEn X4 Cded 0 1.4 0~ ~Ld a4~4 u 4) 4) 4 (L) bjD .4 4O 0 4 C d 7 a nkoErd k cc d &gt;noc~ ~ En En d n u-eF En 01.9u n c c 0 0- . . ) 0 0 Q (L) W $ cd I., En 0 &gt; om4 .?. ?4-4 4 9-04o 4 7 &gt; 4 4j 1. d - E n 4. -j$4 d W 1 E Cd : 0 c 0 1.4 W 0 $.4 0 o cd 0 4-j 4-j Q E45() cE cd cd .J .,W o 14 E - Cd., cn 4 5 O d M Q) &gt;., d 0 En 0 W Q)Q o o O clT~d V-4OCC rl Cr00 OOl ?4 rr) z ~ c 0 c d ch bIo Cd -44-1s- 4) Q6 r. )W 1-4 cd ?l En Cd 0 ) 4) 1-.4 0 0- 04-,4(: Cl Orr O~ Scd Z 0 ZO ) 4- d C 'cd FIE &gt;., P z 01 z4 0 z .V-4 s-4 0 V-4 ?r d cd .14 43 0 * 4-j En r (n 4-4 En En En Ocd zZV 02 En CEn W C/) O~~ bO Z En En Zo -/) 0 00 L)) ed e If) \OC 'Q En r 0% 00 0 04-4 ox'-o o CC En .4 4-) 0 q bo V-4 cn c .~ cx30 V--4 ce 0 V) ~j 1 o0\o e ?~III NV)d W 'clQ) ~ ~ r?A</page><page sequence="12">1424 Child Development studies of pubertal girls. Adult women recall onset of menstruation in rather negative terms and think of it as an unpleasant experience. Further, they indicate that they lacked a sense of social support from their immediate environ- ment. Obviously these studies are limited by the potential distortions of memories and the absence of any objective data. Impact of timing: early and late matura- tion.-A girl's age at the time of menarche can be an important factor in determining her re- sponse. Both early and late maturers may be viewed as "out of step" with their peers. Of course, this could either be an advantage or disadvantage, depending on the values of the peer group. Faust (1960) examined the relationship be- tween age at menarche and prestige. She had 731 girls from grades 6 through 9 complete the Guess Who Test, which is a peer-nomination procedure with items like: Guess who is the class leader? Who has older friends? and so on. They also completed a prestige measure (this involved naming the classmate "whom everyone thinks a lot of, who influences the group ..."). A school nurse or physical education teacher interviewed each girl to acquire information about menar- cheal status. Girls were then classified into one of four groups: prepubertal, pubertal (menarche within 1 year), postpubertal (menarche be- tween 1 and 3 years), and late adolescent (menarche more than 3 years earlier). Overall, there were few significant differences among the four groups in terms of "guess who" traits or prestige scores. However, at all grade levels, the physically more mature girls received higher scores on two items: "seems grown-up" and "has older friends" (these differences were sig- nificant only in seventh and eighth grades). Faust reports that before junior high school, early maturing girls were accorded less pres- tige; however, during junior high school, they received more of the favorable reputation scores. Faust suggests that early menarche and maturation can be a disadvantage at the time, but later in adolescence it becomes an asset. This study is limited by the absence of multiple and specific measures. Prestige is a complex characteristic and this study only measures one aspect of it. Using a design similar to Faust's (1960), Harper and Collins (1972) studied more than 600 Australian girls ranging in age from 10 to 17. They used a peer-nomination technique to determine which girls were most desirable as friends (prestige). Then they compared differ- ences in prestige between pre- and postmen- archeal girls. No differences were found (see table 4). Next they compared early and late maturers in terms of prestige. Early maturers were defined as girls who reached menarche before 11-3 years; late as girls who reached menarche after 14-1 years. Again they found no differences. The authors concluded that ma- turational rate alone does not account for popu- larity; rather, it interacts with other variables which are perhaps more important for deter- mining a girl's status. For example, they sug- gested that for these Australian girls, prestige was influenced more by a girl's keeping up with current fashion than by her maturation rate. As we suggested earlier, variables like prestige are complex and therefore a finding that prestige is unrelated to menarcheal age does not inval- idate the importance of early or late matura- tion. Instead, it suggests that the differences may occur in specific aspects of personality and behavior. Other studies have looked at the impact of maturation alone. While these studies do not focus on menarche specifically, they provide useful information about ways in which matura- tion affects girls; since age at menarche is cor- related with maturation rate, the studies are included here. Jones and Mussen (1958) used data from a longitudinal study of growth. They identified early maturers (16 girls) and late maturers (18 girls), based on X-rays of wrists and hands. (Because of new information about possible harmful effects of X-rays, these meth- ods are no longer used to assess rate of matura- tion.) They then compared the girls' responses to 18 TAT pictures given when the girls were high school seniors, approximately 17 years old. Comparisons between early and late ma- turers showed that early maturers were better adjusted, while late maturers showed a greater need for recognition. Jones and Mussen con- cluded that the early maturer suffers at first because she is out of phase with her peers, but she recovers later in adolescence and ultimately surpasses the late maturer in social adjustment. These findings are different from the results with boys, where early maturation is a clear ad- vantage (Mussen &amp; Jones 1957). Since this study does not report data collected at or near the time of menarche, we have no data about the experiences of early and late maturers dur- ing early adolescence. Peskin (1973) used longitudinal data from the guidance study of the Institute of Human Development. He identified 11 early maturing and 10 late maturing girls, based on the top</page><page sequence="13">(U &gt;,4 4-J 4 J1U ) 1-4 ce (U (U 0 B' 0-, 0 00 ZU o - -40 ( 0 4.2 (U d 4 (U ?: 'o~cl?r En 1, (U ~ bo)bDa 1-4 Q (U ;; (u En (u Q) e (U s-4 c- Q)k d En 0I c- c4q4 m " S-4-4) 44)b 4)Uc s- U2 4) cu0 d H 0 4 u 0E .-o 4) 4) (U CU $-4 cd to O O C ro +j U2 P-4 4 ) 4.2'~ o cu 1 En4. 2 P-1 U2 W En ZV 0 -4u P P4 (u bo 0 cd ce -4 1- ..4U S-4 (U (U P-4 Z 0 (U 4-4 En 1-4 )Vr oq 2-4 -z 4.) 1-4 b)o ;. j %J ( - - cd 4) U2. -4 0 4 U -j cbc Uk &gt; 0 u ?o 4-j 1. - dl (U bo 0 Cd U2 EnWD 0 0 U 0 (U 00.0- 44) 0 U2)P.44) .0 cd0( 41. 0 , 0 U (I, u bu 0 ro " ( -P44- 144 n45)- 0 0,-4 21 w ?o 4-4 Q t d m Cd to cd ( CU U w cd U2 4 (U 'o P-4 &gt;, 0 bD F bI ) 4 a (U(U d o Zl o d ( w W CU -44 J 2 cd cu 0!5 0d c0 - 0 rll1-4 (C un cd 3 E - *P-4 4.0 (U Cdn 2c ) 0 *02'cu 0 . 0-4 0 oM 4-J -J44 (n cd Cd a. 4 4j &gt; c CU U4--. 4) w d -4 C! &gt; ed 4- j - 0 +j4J -J , P4 + En 0 0P-4 U2U2 d 21203 ce 0 CU 4-J o. 4 cu 4-J Ce 4? 0 0 k C?

He then compared ratings of behavior for the two groups at two times: during adoles- cence, and then again at age 30. During ado- lescence, the two groups differed on several dimensions. Early maturers were more stressed, as evidenced by temper tantrums and whining. They were more likely to withdraw from social contacts and to turn toward inner feelings (high scores on introversion, high dream recall, low irritability). Peskin interprets these results in the context of developmental stages. He ex- plains that latency comes to an abrupt end for the early maturers, and as a result these girls are forced to focus on their internal states. He argues that while the crisis is difficult, it is an important learning process, culminating in the ability to move from inner direction to external spheres of social action. Late maturers, on the other hand, may avoid any struggle related to maturation. Since Peskin believes that some crisis is importarnt in the long run, he predicts that problems will show up for these girls at a later developmental point. To test this, Peskin examined follow-up data on the early and late maturers when they were age 30. Analysis of Q-sort data revealed that early maturers were "more self-possessed and self-directed than the late maturers" (p. 281). Late maturers were described as giving up and withdrawing where possible "in the face of frustration and adversity" (p. 283). Peskin uses these results to support his view that late maturation can be psychologically detrimental. It is interesting that Peskin notes that late ma- turing girls grow more rapidly (e.g., breast development is complete in 2.7 years whereas it takps 3.6 years for early maturing girls). Thus, there are differences not only in timing but also in rate of development. Although Pes- kin's ideas about the impact of timing are thought-provoking, data from only 21 girls is not sufficient for making any generalizations. The findings can only be considered suggestive. A final study did not examine psycholog- ical characteristics of early and late maturers directly, but still provides useful information about the importance of timing. Wilen and Petersen (Note 2) looked at adolescents' self- descriptions of rate and reactions to the timing of puberty. Ninety-six seventh-grade girls were asked to describe changes in breast develop- ment, body hair, and growth and were asked if they had reached menarche. (Seventy-four boys also participated in the study; they will not be discussed here.) Overall, 13% of girls were early, 67% were on time, and 205% were late. Subjects were also asked to respond to questions about their perceptions of timing and their feelings about their rates of development. Wilen and Petersen found that not all girls per- ceived their development in the same way that their self-reports indicated. For example, some "on time" maturers perceived themselves as late maturers. There was no relationship between actual timing and girls' feelings. While the rela- tionship between perceived timing and feelings was not significant, there was an interesting pattern: girls who felt they were "off time" (early or late) were more likely to express neg- ative feelings about their development. The reverse was true of girls who perceived them- selves as being on time-they reported positive or neutral feelings. It seems that the impact of timing can come not only from physical changes, but from psychological perceptions of how a person fits in with her peers. These find- ings highlight the complexity of the timing issue; the psychological consequences of early and late maturation seem to come from several different sources. Unfortunately, this study was limited to seventh graders, none of whom is truly a "late maturer." Replication of this study with a wider age range would help clarify the importance of perceptions of timing. One general problem with studies of the effects of timing is that they all use different criteria to determine early and late maturation, and different measures for assessing the impact of timing. Further, relationships between per- sonality or behavioral variables and timing of menarche (or maturation) do not imply causal effects. Other factors may affect differences be- tween the groups, including the amount of preparation for menarche and maturation. Earlier we saw that girls who were completely unprepared for menstruation viewed onset of menstruation as most traumatic. These girls were also more likely to be young at the time of menarche, the early maturers. Thus, timing of menarche is an important issue which we need to clarify in future research. Clinical case studies.-Several psychoan- alysts have reported their impressions of the impact of menarche based on case studies. Kestenberg (1967) presented samples from analyses of several young girls who reached menarche while they were in analysis. She found that "Menarche initiated in these girls a personality change of which they were not aware and which did not become the focus of analysis because it constituted, in all cases, an improvement rather than a regressive develop- ment" (p. 20). She used these impressions to</page><page sequence="15">Greif and Ulman 1427 support her view (Kestenberg 1967) that men- arche is a positively integrating event. Hart and Sarnoff (1971) report the con- cerns of girls who are both premenstrual and those who are postmenstrual, based on case studies. They proposed a two-stage model, in which the first stage exemplified premenarcheal confusion and fantasy reorganization, and the second stage reflects postmenarcheal reorgani- zation and clarification of sex role. They report dreams and fantasies of two girls to represent the stages. These reports are limited by the small number of girls included and by the selec- tive nature of the girls who are in long-term therapeutic relationships. Nevertheless, these reports suggest that dreams and fantasies may be a useful source of information about the impact of menarche. Discussion of Methodological and Conceptual Issues In this paper we have reviewed a number of empirical studies of the impact of menarche on psychological development. As a group, these studies support the view that menarche is an important event for girls and one which should not be ignored. Yet the research to date has only begun to highlight the issues; to un- derstand more fully the particular ways in which menstruation can affect a developing girl, we need to pay more attention to research and conceptual issues. Both the variables studied and the mea- sures used have lacked consistency and an ex- plicit underlying rationale. Measures typically used to study the impact of menarche have ranged from projective to objective personality measures, and interview and questionnaire measures about attitudes and feelings. Empha- sis has been limited to specific variables, such as body image (Koff, Rierdan, &amp; Silverstone 1978; Rierdan &amp; Koff 1980a), positive or neg- ative reactions (Clarke &amp; Ruble 1978; Whis- nant &amp; Zegans 1975), interests (Stone &amp; Bark- er 1937, 1939), and self-concept (Garwood &amp; Allen 1979). Unfortunately, there has been little consistency in the use of these measures across studies so that it is difficult to compare results. Further, most studies focused only on one or two measures of the impact of men- arche; there are no multimethod or multimea- sure studies. Given the unreliability of self- reports and projective tests, use of multiple measures is particularly important. Although the research demonstrates that menarche is a significant event, the lack of comparability across studies and the absence of a wide range of measures makes it difficult at this point to be certain of the ways in which menarche affects pubertal girls. Some specific problems occur throughout the literature. Comparisons of pre- and post- nienarcheal girls are useful for determining changes. However, for these comparisons to be valid, the pre- and postgroups should be the same chronological age. Otherwise, results are confounded by other developmental changes which may be a function of age rather than menarcheal status. That is, results may reflect general differences between older and younger girls. One way to sort out the interaction be- tween age and menstrual status would be through longitudinal research. Despite the diffi- culty of gathering longitudinal data, informa- tion about the same girls before and after men- arche is important for our understanding of the significance of menarche. Obviously there are individual differences in this personal expe- rience. Girls with different personality char- acteristics or social skills may react to menarche in distinct ways. For example, shy, withdrawn girls may find menarche more traumatic than extroverted girls. Cross-sectional studies can only suggest factors which are important and can present us with group differences and reac- tions. To understand more fully the develop- ment of early adolescent girls and the psycho- logical impact of menarche, however, we need to look at the changes within the same indi- vidual. Comparisons of girls who have early and late menarche can provide useful information about the importance of timing. Results sug- gest that early maturing girls get no special treatment at first, and may, initially, even be set apart from the peer group. Ultimately, they do regain social status within the peer group (Peskin 1973). Although some of these studies focus on maturation rather than menarche, per se, they demonstrate the consequences of being deviant from one's peers. If, in a certain group, a significant number of girls all begin to men- struate at age 11 then, within that peer group, early menarche is not unique. As we mentioned earlier, girls who begin to menstruate while only ages 10 or 11 have had less chance to be prepared for the event, in terms of educational preparation. Since lack of preparation corre- lates with menarche being a negative expe- rience, early maturers may be at a disadvan- tage. Finally, age of subjects at the time of comparisons is important. The effects of early menarche may change over time.</page><page sequence="16">1428 Child Development Two other research issues are sample size and socioeconomic status. Because menarche is a personal experience subject to individual dif- ferences, studies with relatively large samples are needed to provide information about group trends. Another factor influencing results is socioeconomic status. Most of the studies re- viewed in this paper used middle-class, white females as subjects. We are left with gaps in our knowledge. For example, we do not know the extent to which lower-class girls, and girls from different ethnic groups, are prepared for menarche, nor do we know their reactions. Be- cause there are differences in some socialization practices across ethnic and economic groups (Henton 1961), it is necessary to look at the impact of menarche on girls from diverse back- grounds. Much research on menarche relies on self- reports of subjects for age of menarche and for reactions to menstruation. The reliability of the reports is unclear. Young girls may desire to be like their peers and, therefore, may pro- vide false information about their menstrual status. Perhaps use of additional self-reports of physical changes (Morris &amp; Udry 1980) and social desirability or lie scales would help elim- inate subjects who provide inaccurate informa- tion. Acquiring data from other sources (e.g., girls' mothers) would be another way to in- crease reliability. Data from adults, based on retrospective reports about their menarcheal experiences, are also problematic because of inaccurate memories (Achenbach 1978; Parlee 1974). While there are no simple ways to verify self-report data, we need to be aware of possible distortions. Virtually all research on the importance of menarche has used assessment measures; there are no observational studies (Peskin [1973] is an exception). While we have sug- gestive evidence that girls' behavior and in- terests change after menarche (e.g., Stone &amp; Barker 1937, 1939), the evidence is based on self-reports only. Observations of the girls themselves, or reports of their behavior from other independent sources, would add to our knowledge of how girls change during early adolescence. One untapped source of infor- mation is teachers. Their observations of girls' behavior in school, school performance, and even interpersonal styles can provide evidence for changes which may be related to menarche. Since teachers often do not know girls' men- archeal status, their reports should not be affected by expectations for changes, the way parental reports might be. Studies of the impact of menarche have focused exclusively on girls themselves. Girls report that their mothers are important to them, yet we have no information about mothers' reactions to their daughters' menarche, nor do we know how mothers perceive their daughters' reactions to menarche and maturation. Inclu- sion of mothers into research on the impact of menarche would give us a broader and more accurate picture of how menarche fits into a social context. Since puberty also affects father- daughter relationships, examination of family systems, through interviews and observations, would be valuable as well. Summary and Conclusions Both theoretical positions about the trau- matic, negative nature of menarche and the positive, integrating nature of menarche have been supported in this review of the research literature. Many girls have negative experiences and tend to keep secret the fact that they have begun menstruating. The experience depends on a number of factors, including a girl's age at the time, her knowledge and expectations, her family support system, and her own per- sonality characteristics. The studies reviewed suggest that several factors can reduce the neg- ative effect, and some can even make the expe- rience more positive. These include prepara- tion for both physical and psychological events, feeling that changes are a normal part of de- velopment. Timing is also important; knowing that one "fits in" with other girls can be com- forting to adolescent girls. The studies cited in this paper have con- tributed useful information to our understand- ing of this significant event in a girl's develop- ment, but a narrow range of variables combined with methodological problems limit the gen- eralizability of the research and leave a number of gaps in our knowledge. We are now ready to move beyond a simplistic dichotomy, which views menarche as a positive or negative expe- rience, to a model which acknowledges the complexity of reactions to menarche. The use of an interactionist perspective (Petersen 1980a, 1980b; Petersen, Note 3), with a focus on both the menarcheal girl and the environ- ment around her, will help to elucidate the role of specific factors related to menarche. Ulti- mately, we can use our understanding of the impact of menarche to increase the likelihood of it being a valuable growth experience for girls, and to enhance our knowledge of the processes of normal development.</page><page sequence="17">Greif and Ulman 1429 Reference Notes 1.
