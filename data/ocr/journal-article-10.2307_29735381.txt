<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Political Turn in Criticism DENIS DONOGHUE In the January-February 1953 issue of Partisan Beview, John Crowe Ransom reviewing KP. Blackmur's Language as Gesture took issue with him upon one consideration, that in appraising the social and political issues which inhabit Yeats's major poems Blackmur remarked only their function within the work, not the ideas as such, even though they might be 'ideas from which, at the very moment, out in the world of action, the issues of life and death are hung'. Blackmur, according to Ransom, was repudiating 'the ideas as ideas, and reckoning their usefulness for the poem'. Ransom had especially in view 'The Later Poetry of W.B. Yeats' (1936) in which Blackmur spoke of Yeats's 'Byzantium' as 'the poetry of an intense and condensed declaration; not emotion put into doctrine from outside, but doc? trine presented as emotion'. Blackmur spoke, too, of the companion-poem 'Sailing to Byzantium' as exhibiting 'the doctrine in action, the doctrine ac? tualized in a personal emotion resembling that of specific prayer'. Then he con? cluded the essay with a large consideration: When we call man a rational animal we mean that reason is his great myth. Reason is plastic and takes to any form provided. The rational imagination in poetry, as elsewhere, can absorb magic as a provisional method of evocative and heuristic thinking, but it cannot be based upon it. In poetry, and largely elsewhere, imagination is based upon the reality of words and the emotion of their joining. Yeats's magic, then, like every other feature of his exp?rience, is rational as it reaches words; otherwise it is his privation, and ours, because it was the rational defect of our society that drove him to it. (Form and Value in Modern Poetry, 1957, p. 58) I have adverted to this little episode between Ransom and Blackmur because it anticipates many of the issues I shall try to describe in my own terms, and partly because we might clarify the issues by requiring each of the disputants to be somewhat more forthcoming. We might ask Ransom what status he assigned to ideas as such, and how they acquired such privilege, and whether or not he thought the ideas so considered remained intact in that character during and after their involvement in the poem. Are they already a virtual poetry, or merely 56</page><page sequence="2">TbePolit?calTurn 57 as Blackmur seemed to imply, raw material for a possible poem? We might ask Blackmur whether he was really content to regard the production of ideas as a matter of ad libbing, of informal play before the commitment of the words is made. Was he content to give the poet every latitude till the play transpired in decisive words, and to judgp the degree of decisiveness by an unexplained cor? relation of emotion and rhythm, the emotion animating a rhythm till that moment merely virtual? When Blackmur says that Yeats's magic is rational as it reaches words, he seems to mean that the poetical character is wayward till it finds a proper syntax for its emotions, and that, so much found, nothing that has preceded the finding matters, every caprice is forgivable as merely auxiliary to the order arrived at. But we might have to ask Blackmur how he could be sure that the syntax found is the order of the rational imagination and not of some sinister force that has assumed the mask of reason and has had no difficulty in ap? pearing plausible. Blackmur's answer would probably involve the evidence of form; as in writing of Allen T?te he said that for T?te events do not become ex? perience till the imagination creates them in objective form, and further and more comprehensively that 'the act of experience, in the arts, transpires only in form5. What has not transpired in its particular form cannot be said to have been experienced. For the moment, however, we need only advert to the gist of the episode. For Blackmur, ideas in a poem have merely opportunistic or otherwise instrumental value. For Ransom, the question was: must they not also have constitutive value, and be judged by correspondingly strict criteria? II It is a commonplace that recent critical theory has taken a distinctly political turn. After twenty years in which theory was in a dependent relation to epistemology, linguistics, anthropology, and psychoanalysis, it now proceeds in a parasitic relation to politics, either of the Right or, more loudly, of the Left. The wind is now blowing from Germany, not from France: the main sources of authority are Marx and the neo-Marxist Frankfurt critics, especially Benjamin, Adorno, and Horkheimer, with selective acknowledgement to Lukacs. Debates between Habermas, Gadamer, and Ricoeur are best understood in that setting. For the time being, the Frankfurt way of being serious has displaced the Parisian way of being rueful. m I shall cite two examples of the political turn, the first from close to home. In Ireland, readers of Yeats, Joyce, and Synge are interrogating these writers in a far harsher spirit than any I recall. It is regularly suggested that Yeats, in particular,</page><page sequence="3">58 Donahue bears some responsibility for the violence and death-dealing in Northern Ireland since 1968. Seamus Deane, for instance, has argued in his Celtic Bevivals (1985) that Yeats turned a misreading of Irish history into an extraordinarily potent mythology which in some sense is being acted out by young people who have never perhaps read a word of his poetry. Yeats, that is, construed the Protestant Ascendancy as an aristocracy, so that he could endow it with the power and grace he ascribed to Italian Renaissance princes, while in fact the Ascendancy was 'a predominantly bourgeois social formation'. To fulfil the logic of his enter? prise, Yeats also conjured into existence the Irish peasant, so that the kinship of peasant and aristocrat, predicated on the working of land, would provide a paradigm of an Ireland heroic in its difference; most tellingly, in its difference from an England given over to science, positivism, empiricism, and in? dustrialization. It follows, according to Deane, that Yeats derived a politics from an aesthetic: he sought 'to obliterate or reduce the problems of class, economic development, bureaucratic organisation and the like, concentrating instead upon the essences of self, community, nationhood, racial theory, Zeitgeist'. To some extent, therefore, Yeats is responsible for the situation in the North, where ostensibly political actions are propelled in feet by ancestral images and powerfully deployed symbols. In this spirit, Deane refers to Yeats's 'Ancestral Houses'. The poem, he says, owes its force to the vitality with which it offers a version of Ascendancy history as true in itself. The truth of this historical reconstruction of the Ascendancy is not cancelled by our simply saying No, it was not like that. For its ultimate validity is not historical, but mythical. In this case, the mythical element is given prominence by the meditation on the fate of an originary energy when it becomes so effective that it transforms nature into civilisation and is then transformed itself by civilisation into decadence. This poem, then, appears to have a story to tell and, along with that, an interpretation of the story's meaning. It operates on the narrative and on the conceptual planes and at the intersection of these it emerges, for many readers, as a poem about the tragic nature of human existence itself. (Heroic Styles: The Tradition of an Idea,l984,p.6) Deane repudiates what he calls this humanist reading of the poem, on the grounds that it claims that a work of literature 'can arrive at a moment in which it takes leave of history or myth . . . and becomes meaningful only as an aspect of the human condition'. It endorses, he maintains, the humanist conviction that literature, in its highest forms, is free of ideology. I shall comment a little on Deane's position before citing my other example of the political turn. It strikes me that his invidious distinction between history and myth is itself ideological because he has not established it, he has merely</page><page sequence="4">ThePoliticalTurn 59 assumed it. Whether we approve or not, myth is as real as history; language of? fers hospitality to both, with little show of favour to one more than the other. Neither of them is given by nature or arises spontaneously. Nor has Deane established that a consideration of Ireland in terms of class, economic develop? ment, and the like is ideologically innocent by comparison with discriminations in terms of caste and race which are ideologically guilty. Deane is reading 'Ancestral Houses5 as if it were an editorial in a newspaper. Besides, there are indeed human experiences of which the appropriate acount is not historical but mythological. I am persuaded by Northrop Frye to distinguish between mythology and ideology in this respect. An ideology, he says, 'expresses secondary and derivative human concerns5: ideologies are der? ived from mythology, 'which expresses the primary desires of existence, along with the anxieties attached to their frustration5 (TXS, 17 January 1986). The ground of the distinction is biological, it is based upon one's bodily form and its relation to the earth; upon a metabiology rather than a metaphysic, to invoke a distinction by Kenneth Burke. Mythology, in Frye's sense, doesn't float free of history, it may be verified upon historically acceptable evidence at any moment. But it calls, too, for a description which recognises the primordial character of the experiences it expresses. 'Ancestral Houses5 posits a certain primordial mode of experience, which Yeats regards as analogous to an organic sequence ? birth, growth, maturity, decay, death ? which, he is hardly obliged to prove, may be verified by recourse to historical evidence. I can5t see that Yeats's rhetorical posi? tion in this poem is more vulnerable than Deane's or mine. IV My second witness is Fredric Jameson, a critic for whom a political passion pro? vides every incentive; literature, film, and architecture providing the occasions of acting upon it. In his essay on Ulysses, his study ofWyndham Lewis, and The Political Unconscious, Jameson has developed a theory of Modernism according to which many of the received works of modern literature constitute only a scan? dal. Briefly, he argues that Anglo-American modernism has been dominated by an impressionistic aesthetic: The most influential formal impulses of canonical modernism have been strategies of inwardness, which set out to reappropriate an alienated universe by transforming it into personal styles and private languages: such wills to style have seemed in retrospect to reconfirm the very privatization and fragmentation of social life against which they meant to protest. (Fables of Aggression, 1979, p. 2) The modernist strategy issues from Symbolism, which Jameson in his essay 'Ulysses in History' (W.J. McCormack and Alastair Stead, eds, James Joyce and</page><page sequence="5">60 Donahue Modern Literature, 1982) regards as featuring 'the illicit transformation of ex? isting things into so many visible or tangible meanings'. Illicit, because the transformation surreptitiously brings into a single act of perception the ex? perienced and the intelligible. Any work of literature, therefore, that is founded upon Symbolism is to be rejected, since it offers to turn a predicament into a privilege; it provides an otherwise alienated reader with an unquestionable recourse to his own privacy and subjectivity, and encourages him to feel that his truth is to be found and enjoyed there. In Ulysses, whatever Bloom encounters is mediated through his subjectivity, and the whole is 'unified by the stylistic tone in which all contradictions are ironically resolved as well as by the overall unity of Bloom's personality'. So 'the Joycean phantasmagoria, even in the Nighttown chapter, serves to reconfirm the unity of the psyche, and to reinvent that depth psychological perspective from which these private fantasies spring' (Fables of Aggression, p. 37). Joyce has played into the hands of the enemy; he has given his reader the consolation prize of a restored subjectivity. Jameson's reading of Ulysses, to go no further than that book, is disabled by his insistence that literature will serve a political cause: what the cause is, it makes no theoretical difference to specify. Jameson's immediate authority for his rejection of Symbolism, I would guess, is the passage in The Origin of German Tragic Drama where Benjamin juxtaposes the allegorical and the symbolic ways of see? ing, much to the moral advantage of allegory: Whereas in the symbol, destruction is idealized and the transfigured face of nature is fleetingly revealed in the light of redemption, in allegory the observer is confronted with the fades hippocratica of history as a petrified, primordial landscape. Everything about history that, from the very beginn? ing, has been untimely, sorrowful, unsuccessful, is expressed in a face ? or rather, in a death's head. And although such a thing lacks all 'symbolic' freedom of expression, all classical proportion, all humanity ? nevertheless, this is the form in which man's subjection to nature is most obvious and it significantly gives rise not only to the enigmatic question of the nature of human existence as such, but also of the biographical historicity of the in? dividual. (Tr. John Osborne, 1977, p. 166) (Hippocratica denotes the livid, shrunken image of the body, immediately before death; it is so named because Hippocrates was the first to describe it.) It follows from Benjamin's invidious meditation on allegory and symbol that the moral superiority of the allegorical vision consists in its refusal of comfort, redemption, and unity: according to Benjamin, the occasional felicities of man in nature are specious, anthropomorphic delusions, to be set aside by a relentless sense of history as death. Allegory testifies to a refusal to be appeased, it resents every token of unity, the seeming conjunction of existence and meaning.</page><page sequence="6">ThePoliticalTurn 61 Jameson contrasts Ulysses unfavourably with Wyndham Lewis's The Childer mass, because Lewis refuses to be comforted, seeks the dispersal rather than the unification of subjectivity, takes precaution against homogeneity of tone, 'com? poses by phrase, by larger word-units drawn from various sources which are never completely subdued and mastered by the overall form of the sentence itself (Hudson Review, July 1973) Jameson's comparison of Joyce and Lewis serves a political purpose. It doesn't matter that Lewis's own political attitudes were flagrantly Right-wing. What matters is that he devised a style which refuses to conspire with personality, sub? jectivity, homogeneity. The resentment which is the most evident feature of his common style can be dealt with later: for the moment, Jameson can produce him as the faci?s hippocratica of a modern literature otherwise rotten with inward? ness and its consolations. V My objection to such procedures as those I have recited from Deane and Jameson would be just as severe if they served another political cause: in any case, they compromise the literature they read by subjecting it to a test of good behaviour. They defeat the literature in advance. But the question now arises: what form would a serious engagement with literature take, if not a political form which turned it into propaganda? In approaching an answer, I disclaim any originality for it by alluding to its constituents, these being the work of other hands. I merely bring the pieces together to suggest a programme all the better for its slightness. I begin with a passage from Frye's 'Yeats and the Language of Symbolism', where he distinguishes between the natural man and poetic man: Once a poet finds his mask, and it becomes the outward form of his creative life, it loses all real connexion with his natural life. . . The poet, by presenting us with a vision of nobility and heroism, detaches that vision from our or? dinary lives. He thus works in a direction exactly opposite to that of the political leader who insists on trying to attach it, and so perverts its nature, as fascism perverted the Nietzschean gospel of heroic virtue into the most monstrous negation of it that the world has ever seen . . . The artist, of course, is always, like Narcissus, apt to become enamoured with the reflecting illusion of his own mask. Yeats himself did not possess every kind of high in? telligence, and some affectations resulting from a pedantic streak in his make? up led him into a certain amount of social and political dithering. But for all that we should not be too quick to plaster a fascist label on Yeats's myth mere? ly because a conspiracy of thugs happened to debase that myth instead of some other one. . . . Poetic symbolism is language and not truth, a means of</page><page sequence="7">62 Donahue expression and not a body of doctrine, not something to look at but something to look and speak through, a dramatic mask. "The poet", said Sir Philip Sidney, ' 'never affirmeth' ' ; when he does affirm, he not only ceases to be a poet, but is as likely to be wrong as anyone else. (Fables of Identity, 1963, p. 238) I assume that when a poet affirms, in Frye's sense or Sidney's, he voids the distinction which Hegel makes, in the Encyclopedia of Philosophical Sciences, be? tween Imagination and Reason: 'Imagination... is reason, but only a nominal reason, because the matter or theme it embodies is to imagination qua imagin? ation a matter of indifference; while reason qua reason also insists upon the truth of its content.' (Section 457) This implies ? and it leads me to the second constituent, a passage from Frank Kermode's The Sense of an Ending (1967) ? thatapoet does well to remain among his fictions, and to regard them as 'heuristic and dispensable'. A myth, in Ker? mode's sense but not in Frye's, is a fiction which has congealed because the poet has forgotten that it is a fiction and proposes to put it into practice as if it were true. King Lear is a fiction, anti-Semitism is a myth. Kermode aptly quotes Sar? tre's observation that 'the final aim of art is to reclaim the world by revealing it as it is, but as if it had its source in human liberty'. The 'as if is the grace note that prevents a poet's fictions from becoming myths. The third constituent is clearly compatible with Frye and Kermode; it is a composite factor, a motive common to Ernst Bloch's The Spirit of Utopia and Herbert Marcuse's The Aesthetic Dimension (1979). Bloch defends modern art and literature by saying that they represent the future of mankind by expressing mankind's desires, especially the desire for freedom. Bloch's work is a philosophy of hope, of futurity, of Utopia, a stirring of possibility. Marcuse is more specific. 'By virtue of its aesthetic form', he maintains, 'art is largely autonomous vis-?r-vis the given social relations'. Literature can be called revolu? tionary 'only with reference to itself, as content having become form'. Indeed, the political potential of art lies only in its own aesthetic dimension: its relation to praxisis inexorably indirect, mediated, and frustrating'. Marcuse goes further to say something which must be a scandal to such readers as Deane and Jameson, that 'when the subjectivity of individuals is dissolved into class consciousness, a major prerequisite of revolution is minimized, namely, the fact that the need for radical change must be rooted in the subjectivity of individuals themselves'. Marxist theory was mistaken, according to Marcuse, in interpreting subjectivity as a bourgeois notion: But even in bourgeois society, insistence on the truth and right of inwardness is not really a bourgeois value. With the affirmation of the inwardness of sub? jectivity, the individual steps out of the network of exchange relationships</page><page sequence="8">ThePoliticalTurn 63 and exchange values, withdraws from the reality of bourgeois society, and enters another dimension of existence. Liberating subjectivity constitutes itself in the inner history of the individuals ? their own history, which is not identical with their social existence. The scandal is not yet complete. Marcuse goes on to defend 'art for art's sake' in? asmuch as 'the aesthetic form reveals tabooed and repressed dimensions of reality: aspects of liberation'. The domain of art is the freedom of inwardness and subjectivity. This freedom is not, Marcuse says, illusory, it is just as real as the public reality it contradicts. 'Art breaks open a dimension inaccessible to other experience, a dimension in which human beings, nature, and things no longer stand under the law of the established reality principle. ' But this does not mean that the world according to art is a fantasy or an illusion; it is that of another 'reality principle', of estrangement 'and only as estrangement does art fulfil a cognitive function: it communicates truths not communicable in any other language; it contradicts'. When Marcuse encourages us to believe that 'a work of art is authentic or true not by virtue of its content (i.e. the "correct" representation of social con? ditions), nor by its "pure" form, but by the content having become form', one is impelled to say to a pofiticaUy-minded reader ? Deane, Jameson, ? that his reading is at best incomplete. Incomplete, unless it eventuates in an aesthetic judgment, a judgment of the particular work of art as 'content having become form'. The only remaining constituent I see as necessary is a certain capacity in the reader; imagination. It is a sufficient justification of art that it enables us to im? agine experiences which we have not had, and to participate in those experiences within the accepted limits of form. It offers us the possibility of complete knowledge of the work in question, by comparison with the partial knowledge which is the most we can practise in our ordinary lives. Is there a clear objection to this programme, apart from the obvious objection issuing from propagandists who lay violent hands upon the work of art on behalf of a political aim? The only one I have found is in Paul de Man's Introduction to Hans Robert Jauss's Toward an Aesthetics of Reception. As in his 'Hegel on the Sublime', de Man repudiated 'any valorization of aesthetic categories at the ex? pense of intellectual rigor or political action, or any claim for the autonomy of aesthetic experience as a self-enclosed, self-reflexive totality'. I am content with that; especially in a work of literature, where the saving commonness of language, the heterogeneity of every word, makes the dream of totality and self enclosure absurd. In the Introduction to Jauss, de Man argues against any 'con? catenation of the aesthetic with the meaning-producing powers of language'. The aesthetic, he says, is by definition a seductive notion 'that appeals to the</page><page sequence="9">64 Dontghue pleasure principle, a eudaemonic judgment that can displace and conceal values of truth and falsehood likely to be more resilient to desire than values of pleasure and pain'. It is strange to find de Man saying this, since according to his normal view, all such values are merely different functions of language, they have no in? dependent character. But in any case de Man brushes the aesthetic category aside; aesthetic reactions are interesting only as symptoms. 'Whenever the aesthetic is invoked as an appeal to clarity and control, whenever, in other words, a symptom is made into a remedy for the disorder that it signals, a great deal of caution is in order.' But de Man's idea of the aesthetic is specious. 'It is impossible to conceive of an aesthetic judgment that would not be dependent on imitation as a con? stitutive category', he claims. Why? Because the easiest notion of form is that of a visible object; and the easiest notion of cognition is the apprehension of such an object? De Man refers to 'Heg?l's massively misunderstood treatment of the aesthetic as a provisional (vorl?ufig, a word that also occurs in Benjamin) form of cognition' and says that it is 'entirely in the spirit of his continuators Kierkegaard and Nietzsche' (The Besistance to Theory, 1986, pp 64, 66). But it is not misunderstood if we relate it to the other activities I have invoked as constit? uents of an aesthetic stance: provisional cognition, nominal reason, the produc? tion of'consciously false' fictions, imagery of a future consonant with desire, and the antithetical cognitive function which Marcuse called estrangement or contradiction. I shall make a few remarks about 'Ancestral Houses', since Deane has given it a distinctly ideological reading. The first stanza invokes the femilar Romantic con? trast between organic and mechanic form. The distinction is most readily found in Coleridge, but its imagery comes from Shelley and Blake; from Shelley, to whom water was the great symbol of existence, according to Yeats's 'The Philosophy of Shelley's Poetry'; and from Blake, who says in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell that 'the cistern contains: the fountain overflows'. In 'The Philosophy of Shelley's Poetry', again, Yeats refers to Blake, 'who was always praising energy, and all exalted overflowing of oneself. It is decent of Yeats to ascribe to the rich man the powers to be admired: at least he doesn't suggest that anyone might have them merely by taking thought. The stanza is a reply to Yeats's 'Adam's Curse'; it makes no bones about the ex? hilarating conjunction of power, inherited property, and genius, as if it might stave off the inevitable decay of beauty and other proud forms of achievement. The second stanza begins with the most rueful concession ? 'Mere dreams . . .' ? but it sets it aside at once by invoking Homer, Yeats's type of another conjunction, that of genius and the natural or unchristened heart, the poet of life itself with nothing but its own conviction in its favour. This stanza contains the first crisis; the fountain of life becomes 'the abounding jet', but is then given</page><page sequence="10">ThePoliticalTurn 65 up, as if Homer were now defeated. The proper symbol, Yeats admits, is the 'marvellous empty sea-shell5. In The Island of Statues Colin addresses the shepherd boy: Who art thou? ? speak, As the sea5s furrows on a sea-tost shell, Sad histories are lettered on thy cheek. The sea-shell has been flung 'out of the obscure dark of the rich streams5, so it can speak with authority of everything it has been through, but now it can only recite its sad history, shadowing 'the inherited glory of the rich5. This stanza goes back not only to the worn shell of'Adam's Curse' but to every instance of greatness brought down. In the third stanza, Yeats celebrates the Renaissance princes and the artists and architects they employed, and here a major disjunction is recognised, between the artists, 'bitter and violent men', and the sweetness and gentleness of their creations. In 'Ego Dominus Tuus' and Per Arnica Silentia Lunae Yeats is fascinated by artists whose works are entirely different from themselves; by William Morris and by Landor, the latter a man of notable violence who 'topped us all in calm nobility when the pen was in his hand'. The fourth and fifth stan? zas brood upon the fear of decline adumbrated in the third: 'But when the master's buried mice can play'). These works of grace and beauty may domesticate our greatness as thoroughly as our violence and bitterness. The beauty Yeats celebrates is bound up with that of women, the gardens where they walk, their patron Juno: O what if gardens where the peacock strays With delicate feet upon old terraces, Or else all Juno from an urn displays Before the indifferent garden deities . . . It is a well-recognised mark of Yeats's rhetorical power that it can turn into terms of praise many words normally held for rebuke: violent, bitter, haughty, and Li many societies ' rich '. Much of this effect is achieved in 'Ancestral Homes' by setting up a concatenation of values which go together only when compelled to do so; the attachment of'life', the Blakeian imagery of flowing fountains, and the greatness commonly ascribed, in Pound as in Yeats, to Renaissance patrons of the arts who happened otherwise to be monsters. Yeats's word 'greatness' forces us to acknowledge this concatenation as a single force, even though we would ordinarily want to distinguish its constituents along an unYeatsian system of values. Andrew Marvell's 'Horatian Ode on Cromwell's Return from Ireland' makes it similarly difficult to dissent from the values he celebrates:</page><page sequence="11">66 Donahue active virtue ? another equivocation ? is ascribed to Cromwell, only aesthetic decorum to the defeated Charles. Deane's reading of'Ancestral Houses' errs in two respects: it maintains that the poem 'takes leave of history or myth', and that it becomes meaningful only as 'an aspect of the "human condition".' In feet, the poem doesn't even take leave of history; it refers vaguely but clearly enough to eighteenth-century ac? complishment ? 'a haughtier ag?' points in that direction, though there is no need to assume that Yeats meant Ascendancy Ireland, even though in 'Blood and the Moon' the haughty man praised is Burke. The theme is the alleg?d decline of culture between the Augustan age and our own: the anomaly which gives the poem whatever life it has is the feet that the images which please our passivity are those, now long domesticated, which we have inherited from great and violent men. More thoroughly than most other poets, Yeats knew that a vocabulary, a dic? tion, incorporates a totalizing ambition. When we bring together a few cognate words, they think their kinship so compelling that they preen themselves and set out to take over the world. So much so, that by apt choice and repetition of such words it is easy to convey a conviction that this way of construing the world is ordained by natural law. Yeats recited his high words so imperiously that his poems nearly prescribe a way of being in the world; like a cavalry officer, assured of rank, dignity, and power. The experience of reading any of these central poems is one of imagining a world other than one's own, and assenting to it at least provisionally, and holding back from it, and swaying while the reading lasts between assent and refusal. If Jameson retorts that such an experience merely gulls the reader into thinking that he is acting out his freedom in the presence of the poem, I would defend the reader's freedom precisely by not claiming that it is absolute. It is a conditional felicity, and I would reduce every extravagant claim made on its behalf and then speak up for the value as so reduced. As for the 'human condition': it is a reasonable merit to ask of a poem that it spill over from its local circumstances and speak of the universal fate of being human. We value Donne's poems, and Shakespeare's, and Hardy's because, whatever the local circumstances which provoked them, they transcend that origin and speak beyond their occasion. Besides, to read 'Ancestral Houses' uninvidiously, which on the present occasion means unideologically, it is only necessary to imagine what it would be like to be different, to feel differently, to have the experience of living by another system of values, according to which it would not be sufficient to deem Yeats's word 'greatness' to amount to nothing more than monstrous behaviours. Once we receive it as an imagined experience, we are free to discard every piece of merely local evidence in its favour: it is not necessary to remain infatuated with the greatness of a Renaissance prince. Deane's reading of the poem, like Jameson's reading of Ulysses, would ensure that these works are never read but censored in advance.</page><page sequence="12">ThePolitkalTurn 67 VI I revert to the dispute between Ransom and Blackmur, and remark that Ransom thought it serious enough to conclude it by saying that 'there are substantive as well as formal values' in a poem, j ust as in a novel where their existence is general? ly admitted. Ransom did not mention that in writing about T.S. Eliot's criticism (see The Lion and the Honeycomb, 1956), Blackmur had been more specific in defining the several relations between thought, experience, belief, feeling, and emotion, and his notion of 'doctrine presented as emotion' becomes clear. He gives working definitions of feeling and emotion. Feeling 'is the fundamental term: concrete, sensory, nuclear, somehow in experience, whether actual or imagined, always particular'. Emotion 'is feelings organized by a force whether within or without the psyche : emotion is feelings, organized, generalized, abstracted, built into a form, theoretic or not'. Ad libbing between the words, we can say that doctrine presented as emotion may be translated now to read: an apparently systematic body of ideas, presented so far as they are feel? ings, which in superior poems is far enough. The feelings in the case are suffi? ciently organized, the writing of the poem is the mode of organizing them within the constraints of language. Otherwise put in Blackmur's terms: emo? tion is the theoretic form of feelings which, lacking that form, are disordered and personal beyond communicative redemption. Blackmur says of the theoretic form, the emotion, that it is good only in that instance; which I take to mean that the defect of an idea is that it claims to be good in any and every instance. This is Deane's error, and Jameson's; that having arrived at an idea ? a political stance, a position which can only be reasserted since its history as an idea is already complete ? they insist on its being good in every instance. So the question to ask about 'Ancestral Houses' is not: do I find its political at? titude congenial? but rather: am I willing to read it, and to let it at least provi? sionally read me? If I am willing to read it in that spirit, I suspend for the time be? ing not my disbelief but my economy, the nearly automatic dispositions of at? titude I for the most part practise. It is vain to read a poem unless we are on every occasion willing to ask ourselves: what would it be like to be different? The best reader is not the one who murmurs to himself. 'T'have seen what I have seen, see what I see! ', but the one who says to the poem: 'Help me to feel what you have felt'.</page></plain_text>
