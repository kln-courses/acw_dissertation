<plain_text><page sequence="1">Review of Aegean Prehistory II: The Prepalatial Bronze Age of the Southern and Central Greek Mainland JEREMY B. RUTTER Dedicated to the memory of Klaus Kilian INTRODUCTION This review of a modest slice of mainland Greek prehistory is designed for twin audiences and has twin goals. On the one hand, it is targeted at archaeologists, ancient historians, Classicists, and others who, though they take an interest in Aegean prehistory and may even have some familiarity with it, hardly consider themselves specialists in this subdiscipline of Old World archaeology. For this audience, the purpose of what follows is to provide an outline, with helpful but by no means exhaustive references, to the principal discoveries made, questions addressed, and novel re- search strategies employed in the archaeology of roughly the first three-quarters of the Bronze Age on the southern and central Greek mainland. At the same time, this review is addressed to specialist Aegean prehistorians, not with the aim of making them aware of discoveries or intellectual currents about which they may be ignorant, but rather with the intent of encouraging them, through a consideration of the current state of our field, to take whatever future action they may feel is appropriate to improve upon the present state of our knowledge.' The publication of this review has been made possible in part by a generous subvention from the Institute for Aegean Prehistory. I am very grateful to Tracey Cullen and Fred Kleiner for the invitation extended to me to write it, and to Julia Pfaff for executing the drawings that accompany it. This summary, reflecting the priorities and choices of just one individual, is a highly personal one, with all the potential for sins of both commission and omission that single au- thorship of such a review entails. I apologize to all colleagues in advance for any and all unintentional offenses or slights that such errors on my part may occasion. Without the helpful response from numerous friends and colleagues to my appeals for information, offprints, and preliminary reports on their most recent research, the con- tent of this review would have been much poorer. I would like to thank Susan Alcock, Sebastiaan Bommelj&amp;, Shelby Brown, Hector Catling, William Cavanagh, Georgia Chatze- Speliopoulou, John Cherry, Elmar Christmann, John Cole- man, Michael Cosmopoulos, Joost Crouwel, Katie Demako- poulou, Oliver Dickinson, Soren Dietz, Angelika Dousougli- Zachos, Jeannette and Bj6rn Forsen, John Fossey, Mihalis Fotiadis, Elizabeth French, Noel Gale, Giampaolo Graziadio, Robin HAgg, Paul Halstead, Stefan Hiller, the late Klaus Kilian, to whose memory this review is dedicated, Imma Kilian-Dirlmeier, Georgios Korres, Cynthia Kosso, Sturt Manning, Josef Maran, Hartmut Matthius, Christopher Mee, Penelope Mountjoy, Sylvie Muiller, William Murray, Gull6g Nordquist, Thanasis Papadopoulos, Daniel Pullen, Jorg Rambach, James Roy, Curtis Runnels, Efi Sakellaraki, Zophia Stos-Gale, Gilles Touchais, Lucia Vagnetti, Karen Vitelli, Joanita Vroom, Gisela Walberg, Peter Warren, Hans- Joachim Weisshaar, Berit Wells, Martha Wiencke, David Wil- son, James Wright, Eberhard Zangger, and Carol Zerner. John Bennet, John Cherry, and Daniel Pullen were kind enough to read portions of the manuscript in draft form and suggested many improvements. I owe a special debt of gratitude to Jack Davis for helpful references on a wide range of topics, for encouragement and sympathy, for a helpfully critical reading, and above all for leading the way.

RUTTER [AJA 97 The spatial coverage undertaken for this review includes those portions of the Greek mainland south of a roughly east-west line connecting the mouth of the Spercheios River with the southeast corner of the Gulf of Arta (see below, fig. 3). Epirus, Thessaly, Macedonia, and Thrace are thus omitted from con- sideration, but Akarnania, Aetolia, the southern half of Eurytania, and the Ionian islands from Lefkas south are included. Also included, aside from the entire Peloponnese and the central Greek nomes of Attica, Boiotia, Phocis, Locris, and the southern half of Phthiotis, are the islands of the Saronic Gulf (most notably Aegina and Salamis), islands located just off the southeastern coast of the Argolid (such as Hydra and Spetses), and islands off the southwest coast of the Cape Malea peninsula (Elaphonisos and Kythera), but the large island of Euboea, since it was covered thoroughly in last year's review,2 is not considered here. The period of time surveyed encompasses the en- tire Early and Middle Bronze Ages (EBA and MBA, respectively), known throughout the area in question as the Early Helladic (EH) and Middle Helladic (MH) periods, as well as the earlier part of the Late Bronze Age (LBA), variously termed the Late Helladic (LH) or Mycenaean period. The terminal date for my chro- nological coverage is provided by the construction, at some point during the LH IIB or LH IIIAl periods in the 15th century B.C., of the first Mycenaean ar- chitectural complexes generally recognized by the term "palaces" as the administrative seats of central- ized kingdoms.3 Iconography R.

The only exception to the rule that the entire area under consideration here falls within the Helladic cultural orbit is the island of Kythera.

The last synthetic, comprehensive examination of the Greek mainland during the var- ious periods surveyed here, Hope Simpson's and Dickinson's Gazetteer of Aegean Civilisation in the Bronze Age 1: The Mainland and Islands (G6teborg 1979), provides a useful terminus post quem for the period of scholarly activity covered in the present review.5 GENERAL DEVELOPMENTS Despite the rich dividends paid over the past 15 years by investment in both continuing and freshly initiated excavation projects, another brand of field- work has come to the fore that promises to have an equivalently potent impact on the course of archaeo- logical research in this area-surface survey, particu- larly of the systematic and intensive variety.6 Table 1 lists the principal programs of intensive survey so far undertaken on the Greek mainland, along with a selection of extensive survey projects for comparison;7 figure 1 indicates the locations of the various survey areas and provides a convenient visual display of their relative sizes and distribution throughout the Pelo- ponnese and central Greece. Of the 16 projects iden- tified in table 1, only the University of Minnesota Messenia Expedition (UMME) had been undertaken rov B' Tortnxo"i ZvvE6Giov ApyoAtXdCv Z~rov&amp;bv (Athens 1989) 33-40; Catling, Some Problems in Aegean Prehistory c. 1450-1380 B.C.

Barber, "The Origins of the Mycenaean Palace," in J.M. Sanders ed., PIAOAAKQN: Lakonian Studies in Honour of Hector Cat- ling (London 1992) 11-23. For the dating in calendar years, my preference is for the higher chronology championed since 1987 chiefly by Betancourt and Manning (see table 2; P.P. Betancourt, "Dating the Late Bronze Age with Radio- carbon," Archaeometry 29 [1987] 45-49, esp. table 1; S.W. Manning, "The Bronze Age Eruption of Thera: Absolute Dating, Aegean Chronology and Mediterranean Cultural Interrelations,"JMA 1 [1988] 17-82; Manning, "The Thera Eruption: The Third Congress and the Problem of the Date," Archaeometry 32 [1990] 91-100) rather than for the dates roughly a century later upheld by Warren and Hankey in Chronology 145-48, 169 table 3.1 and more recently by P.M. Warren, "The Minoan Civilization of Crete and the Volcano of Thera," Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum 4 (1990-1991) 29-39. For a critical assessment of Chronology, which focuses on the periods of concern in the present review and with which I am largely in agreement, see the review by J. Maran in Acta Praehistorica et Archaeologica 22 (1990) 179-86. For the most recent overviews on absolute dating at either end of the Mycenaean era, see S.W. Man- ning, "Thera, Sulphur, and Climatic Anomalies," OJA 11 (1992) 245-53; S.W. Manning and B. Weninger, "A Light in the Dark: Archaeological Wiggle Matching and the Absolute Chronology of the Close of the Aegean Late Bronze Age," Antiquity 66 (1992) 636-63; Manning, "Santorini, Ice-cores and Tree-rings: Resolution of the 1645 or 1628 Debate?" Nestor 19 (1992) 2511-12. 4 For the authorship of these two annual bulletins, both of which have far wider spatial and chronological scopes than those encompassed in the present review and are there- fore precluded from being synthetic or analytical in their approach, see "RAP I" 700 n. 2. 5 As it did for J.L. Davis in his assessment of recent developments in the Aegean islands ("RAP I" 700). General surveys of Aegean prehistory contemporary with or more recent than the Gazetteer lack its mainland Greek focus and necessarily devote considerable attention to developments on Crete: S. Hood, The Arts in Prehistoric Greece (Harmonds- worth 1978); R. Treuil et al., Les civilisations igiennes du Neolithique et de l'Age du Bronze (Paris 1989); O.T.P.K. Dick- inson, The Aegean Bronze Age (Cambridge, forthcoming). For a recent survey of developments in Mycenaean archae- ology specifically, see the magisterial overview by the late K. Kilian, "Mycenaeans Up to Date: Trends and Changes in Recent Research," in Problems 115-52. The more recently published survey included in W.A. McDonald and C.G. Thomas, Progress into the Past: The Rediscovery of Mycenaean Civilization2 (Bloomington 1990) 353-472 is in several im- portant respects not as up to date. Now over a decade old, Dickinson's essay on the Bronze Age in the Peloponnese (infra n. 24), though it has somewhat different chronological and geographical foci, anticipates a number of themes in the present survey and is still very much worth reading. 6 For a brief but eloquent statement on the rise to prom- inence of surface survey as an alternative to excavation among the fieldwork options open to archaeologists working in Greece, see A. Snodgrass and J. Cherry, "On Not Digging Up the Past," The Cambridge Review 109 (1988) 9-13. 1 The inspiration for, and a good deal of the data in, table 1 were contributed by Cynthia Kosso, to whom I am exceptionally grateful for sharing with me the chapters deal- ing with archaeological survey from her recently completed Public Policy and Agricultural Practice: An Archaeological and Literary Study of Late Roman Greece (Diss. Univ. of Illinois at Chicago 1993). Note also the important role played by the analysis of recent survey data in S.E. Alcock, Graecia Capta: The Landscapes of Roman Greece (Cambridge 1993) 33-72.</page><page sequence="4">748 JEREMY B. RUTTER [AJA 97 Table 1.

Preliminary reports are only cited if they contain some mention of Bronze Age settlement patterns or if they are the only preliminary reports of any real consequence to have appeared involving a particular survey project. The figures cited under "Area Surveyed," in the cases of intensive surveys, refer not to the entire survey area but rather to the area covered by intensive fieldwalking. The percentage of the total survey area intensively explored varies considerably from project to project (e.g., ca. 20% for the Berbati-Limnes Survey and the Methana Survey vs. ca. 63% for the Nemea Valley Archaeological Project). The figure given for the total area of the Eastern Phocis Survey is no more than a rough approximation based upon the maps published in Fossey 1986 (infra n. 19); no comparable attempt has been made to measure his survey areas in Opountian Locris and the Perachora peninsula. The area surveyed by the Phocis-Doris Expedition has likewise not been estimated since its boundaries are not specified with any particular precision. Under the headings for the three major chronological subdivisions of the mainland Greek Bronze Age or Helladic era, ranges reflect the extent to which sites were certainly occupied (lower number) as op- posed to either possibly or probably occupied (upper number). Since the figures in these three columns refer to sites occu- pied during broad but nevertheless discrete intervals of time, the same site may be counted under two or even all three headings. The bracketed figures represent the numbers of sites for each period included in the Gazetteer. The figures under "LH Sites" include sites of all phases of the Mycenaean period, not merely LH I-II. Sites reported as "prehistoric" could not be more closely dated. The data from the Univer- sity of Minnesota Messenia Expedition (UMME), all of which were included in the Gazetteer, have been presented here for comparative purposes; neither the area covered by that proj- ect nor those of the more recently published regional over- views of settlement patterns cited in n. 20 infra are indicated on fig. 1. 9 B.

I am greatly indebted to Michael Cosmopoulos for a brief summary of the results of the third (1991) season of the Oropos Survey, thus far unpublished. The total number of new sites located by this survey (53) should be adjusted upward slightly to take cognizance of sites previously known within the survey area such as the Amphiaraion and the prehistoric site at Skala Oropou (Gazetteer 221 site A57). 16 I am very grateful to the director of the Pylos Regional Archaeological Project (PRAP), J.L. Davis, for supplying me with a copy of his preliminary report on the progress made during the first of what is projected to be three seasons of fieldwork (1992-1994) devoted to extensive survey in an area of some 250 km2 (the block indicated in fig. 1) in southwestern Messenia and intensive survey of ca. 50 km2, including the entirety of the Englianos ridge, in the imme- diate vicinity of the Mycenaean palace at Pylos. 17 The beginning of intensive surface survey in the south- ern Argolid actually dates back to a single season of work in 1972: M.H. Jameson, "The Southern Argolid: The Setting for Historical and Cultural Studies," in M. Dimen and E. Friedl eds., Regional Variations in Modern Greece and Cyprus: Toward a Perspective on the Ethnography of Greece (New York Academy of Sciences Annals 268, New York 1976) 74-91.

Locations of intensive and selected extensive survey projects listed in table 1 (except for UMME in Messenia) and published before the appearance of the Gazetteer, with the result that the site totals for Messenia were grossly inflated in that volume relative to those of other regions within southern Greece. Fieldwork on the first intensive surveys conducted on the southern Greek mainland began in 1979, the year of the Gaz- etteer's publication (Cambridge/Bradford Boeotian Expedition, Southern Argolid Exploration Project). Of all the intensive surveys listed in table 1, only the Pylos Regional Archaeological Project (PRAP), freshly launched in 1992, and the Oropos Survey are still ongoing projects in the field. Thus, as a phenomenon affecting our understanding of mainland Greek pre- history, the practice of systematic intensive survey made a sudden appearance at the end of the 1970s and flourished throughout the 1980s, but may turn out to be a less prominent strategy of field research in this particular region of Greece during the 1990s.20</page><page sequence="7">1993] PREPALATIAL BRONZE AGE OF THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL GREEK MAINLAND 751 Discussion of the implications of this new form of fieldwork for period- or region-specific problems, like the impact of recent discoveries generated by exca- vation, may be postponed for the sections of this essay devoted to particular periods and cultures. But some of what is new and exciting, as well as problematic, about the information derived from surveys applies to all times and regions and is therefore best sum- marized separately and in advance. To date, intensive survey on the southern Greek mainland2' may be viewed as having gone through two distinct stages of development and recently to have entered a third. The first stage, encompassing roughly the period be- tween 1978 and 1984, witnessed the beginning of about half of the projects listed in table 1. The prin- cipal concern of the practitioners of intensive survey in the field was to devise methodologies appropriate for their specific research goals and geographical re- gion, but in their publications they were above all concerned with demonstrating the superiority of their approach to survey over the extensive, typically non- systematic strategies that had flourished in Greece since the 19th century.22 The second stage, lasting from 1984 through 1992, revealed through the clear dominance of intensive over extensive surveys that the debate over the relative merits of the two strategies had been decisively settled, insofar as fieldwork on the Greek mainland was con- cerned, in favor of intensive survey.23 The repeated demonstration that intensive surveys were successful 20 At the time of writing, more intensive survey projects are in progress on both Crete and Cyprus than on the southern and central Greek mainland, but this is unlikely to remain the case for very long. It is more difficult to gener- alize in an equivalent way about extensive survey projects. The bulk of Fossey's fieldwork in eastern Phocis, Opountian Locris, and Boeotia took place in the later 1960s, contem- poraneously with the later stages of the surveying under- taken by McDonald and his colleagues on the UMME project in Messenia. Kase and his coworkers on the Phocis-Doris Project conducted their field research in the later 1970s. Fossey's work on the Perachora peninsula was concentrated in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Finally, S. Bommelj&amp;, P.K. Doorn, and J.A.C. Vroom, who began their work in Aetolia in the 1980s, have continued to pursue active fieldwork through to the present.

The Melos survey, for example, was both initiated and published well in advance of the first mainland equivalent (J.F. Cherry, "A Preliminary Study of Site Distribution" and "Appendix A: A Register of Archaeological Sites on Melos," in C. Ren- frew and M. Wagstaff eds., An Island Polity: The Archaeology of Exploitation in Melos [Cambridge 1982] 10-23 and 291- 309, respectively). The significant advances in survey theory and methodology achieved during the 1980s are reflected in the final publication of the Northern Keos survey, which has appeared before the first complete publication of any mainland survey (J.F. Cherry, J.L. Davis, and E. Mantzour- ani, Landscape Archaeology as Long-Term History: Northern Keos in the Cycladic Islands [Monumenta archaeologica 16, Los Angeles 1991]). Note also from an island the work of D.R. Keller, Archaeological Survey in Southern Euboea, Greece: A Reconstruction of Human Activity from Neolithic Times through the Byzantine Period (Diss. Indiana Univ. 1985; UMI 85-27015). 22 For the concern with appropriate intensive survey methodologies in an embryonic form, see many of the papers dealing with projects in Greece included in D.R. Keller and D.W. Rupp eds., Archaeological Survey in the Mediterranean Area (BAR-IS 155, Oxford 1983) 207-302. For the debate over intensive vs. extensive approaches to surface survey, see R. Hope Simpson, "The Limitations of Surface Surveys," and J.F. Cherry, "Frogs around the Pond: Perspectives on Current Archaeological Survey Projects in the Mediterra- nean Region," in Keller and Rupp (supra) 45-47 and 375- 416, esp. 390-94, respectively; R. Hope Simpson, "The Analysis of Data from Surface Surveys," and J.F. Cherry, "Common Sense in Mediterranean Survey?"JFA 11 (1984) 115-17 and 117-20, respectively. 23 Of the projects listed in table 1, the Aetolia Survey is unique in having employed from its inception in the mid- 1980s an extensive strategy. The rationale for doing so in this particular case is simple and compelling: the area being surveyed is enormous and, in relation to areas of the main- land to both south and east, very poorly documented ar- chaeologically. In addition, the terrain and ground cover across most of Aetolia make intensive strategies virtually counterproductive, except in a few zones that together con- stitute only a small percentage of the survey area's overall extent. Steep relief, dense ground cover, or simple inacces- sibility caused by the reluctance of landowners to permit survey on their property have made intensive survey impos- sible in some sections of virtually every project's study area, but in most regions of the Peloponnese and east-central Greece such obstacles to an intensive survey's success involve a far smaller component of the total landscape than in Aetolia.</page><page sequence="8">752 JEREMY B. RUTTER [AJA 97 in identifying a vastly larger total number of sites within a given area persuaded those interested in the study of diachronic change in settlement patterns that data generated by extensive strategies were simply not close enough to any ancient reality for interre- gional analyses of such data to inspire any confi- dence.24 This stage witnessed the first lengthy publications on individual mainland Greek intensive surveys, in the form of preliminary reports in which methodological issues were at least initially of primary concern.25 In more recent preliminary reports, there has been a somewhat greater emphasis on the pre- sentation of artifactual data, although there continues to be a substantial interest in questions of method.26 During this same period the first synthetic analyses of the data generated by one of the earliest of these mainland Greek intensive surveys, the Southern Ar- golid Exploration Project, appeared,27 as did some reminders that extensive programs of survey still have an impressive amount of new information to contrib- ute when conducted in areas and for periods of time that are still quite poorly known archaeologically, such as the Greek northwest in prehistory (fig. 2a-b).28 The third stage has begun only within the past year and is characterized by two highly significant devel- opments: first, the appearance of the final publica- tions of several of the intensive survey projects conducted during the 1980s,29 and second, the initial interregional comparisons of the available data from such projects, whether in preliminary or in final form.30 On the eve of the flood of interregional com- parative studies that is bound to result from the pub- lication of vast quantities of information of a fundamentally different character than has hitherto been available, it is worth taking the time to comment briefly on some of the problems raised in the prelim- inary reports on mainland Greek intensive surveys concerning their interpretation. Masses of new infor- mation from the intensive surveys listed in table 1 have been collected, whether by superior or inferior sampling strategies and field recording techniques. What should we keep in mind as we brace ourselves for the onslaught of these staggering quantities of fresh data and prepare to choose between a wide variety of interpretative approaches? The collection of these data has been conditioned by our desire to investigate patterns of settlement, that is, mankind's adaptations on a regional scale to particular natural environments. Our ultimate goal is to document and explain variety in such settlement patterns across space and through time. To this end we need to be particularly sensitive, in seeking to digest the new data and to assess the interpretations derived from those data, to three broad areas of concern: the nature of the environment in which ancient populations found themselves, the ways by 24 Studies of mainland Greek settlement patterns employ- ing the data from extensive surveys include C.

The nature of the ancient Greek landscape was no more constant through either time or space than was the pattern of human settlement within it. Thus, es- tablishing how and when this landscape underwent significant change must be considered an ingredient critical to the appropriate interpretation of intensive survey data.3 As important as the shape of the land- scape are the resources, whether faunal,32 botanical,33 31 See, e.g., J.C.

Archaeological time can be measured in both ab- solute and relative terms. In the context of the main- land Greek Bronze Age, relative dating is most effectively achieved through seriating ceramics from stratified excavation contexts, although objects of stone, metal, and bone or ivory from the same con- texts may also be useful for this purpose. In light of the range of artifactual materials as a rule recovered during intensive surface surveys, the overwhelming majority of Bronze Age occupational components identified at survey sites are recognized and dated with the aid of stone tools and pottery, for the most part highly fragmentary and heavily worn. Although a fair amount of progress has been made over the past decade on the chronology of Helladic stone and bone tools as well as stone vessels,35 potsherds still represent the "artifactual category of choice" for dat- ing episodes of Bronze Age activity wherever evidence of this is found.

Recognition of these problems involving the primary evidence for dating sites, along with explicit state- ments concerning what percentages of the finds ac- tually recovered are presented in the final report and how these items were selected, should be considered extremely important in a surface survey's final pub- lication. Relative dating is critical for the sequencing of dis- tinct patterns of settlement through time. Absolute dating, on the other hand, is significant for determin- ing the pace of change in such patterns (table 2). There is currently considerable disagreement among Aegean prehistorians concerning absolute dating, both with respect to the date of the volcanic explosion of Santorini at some point in the second quarter of the second millennium B.C. and with regard to the beginning of the Early Bronze Age sometime in the second half of the fourth.39 One result of this dis- 36 E.g., the fine gray-burnished class of pottery generally known as Gray Minyan is ordinarily considered to be a hallmark of the MH period, but it was in fact first produced across a large portion of the central and southern Greek mainland in the EH III period (J.B. Rutter, "Fine Gray- burnished Pottery of the Early Helladic III Period: The Ancestry of Gray Minyan," Hesperia 52 [1983] 327-55; G.C. Nordquist, "A Note on EH III Fine Gray-burnished Pottery from Asine," OpAth 18 [1990] 241-43) and survives in con- siderable quantities in some areas into the LH I period (J.L. Davis, "Late Helladic I Pottery from Korakou," Hesperia 48 [1979] 234-63; ATMA 199-204). As a class, it therefore cannot be used as a simple means of identifying MH occu- pation, although it has often enough been so employed in the past. 37 E.g., the lack of a well-established Neolithic through Early Iron Age ceramic sequence in west-central Greece accounts for the large numbers of sites located recently by the Aetolia Survey at which occupation can be no more closely dated than "prehistoric" (table 1, fig. 2a-b). 38 J.B.

Coarse wares may prove to be more helpful indicators of date than fine wares for a substantial percentage of the total sites located by intensive survey, even when detailed typologies of the vessels pro- duced in such wares have yet to be established: D.C.

Manning, The Absolute Chronology of the Aegean Early Bronze Age: Archaeology, Radiocarbon, and History (Monographs in Mediterranean Ar- chaeology 1, Sheffield 1993) who, in contrast to the positions adopted by Warren and Hankey in Chronology, advocates a high dating for the Theran eruption and a low date for the beginning of the EBA. I am very grateful to Sturt Manning for assisting me with the selection of absolute date ranges to include in table 2.

It is nevertheless true that displaying site densities diachronically in terms of the numbers of sites occupied per century is a far more satisfactory way to represent changes in such densities than the conventional bar graph that simply plots site numbers against archaeological pe- riods, regardless of the highly variable duration of such periods.40 The discriminating reader of the forthcoming final publications of intensive surveys executed during the 1980s will therefore have to pay as much attention to how issues of absolute chronol- ogy between 3500 and 1500 B.C. are treated as to how details of relative chronology are handled. Defining a "site"-that is, distinguishing a concen- tration of artifactual debris from the blanket of similar man-made litter often referred to as "background noise," which covers virtually the entire Greek land- scape-and establishing a site's limits, and hence size, have been central concerns of those practicing inten- sive survey on the Greek mainland from the begin- ning.41 Those most familiar with the problems of site definition-that is, intensive surveyors themselves-- candidly admit that site definition is as much an act of interpretation as of pure observation.42 Since the methodology of site recognition is likely to be as proj- ect-specific as the reconstruction of the environment through time and the criteria employed to measure that time in both relative and absolute terms, we should once again expect final publications of inten- sive surveys to be explicit on the questions of how sites are distinguished and their extents measured. We have a further right to expect that equally explicit criteria will be provided for the attribution of func- tions to sites and for the identification of site hierar- chies. Of critical importance for such interpretations are assessments not merely of the size and environ- mental setting of each site but also of the significance of the artifacts recovered at each. For every chrono- logically discrete component recognized at a site, what are the numbers and functional ranges of these items, what are the relative frequencies of imported as op- posed to local products, and are the imports likely to have come to the site as raw materials or as finished goods? The task of identifying imports should not be restricted to one or another artifactual class, although until recently such work has focused largely on frag- mentary ceramic containers and chipped stone tools of obsidian.43 However legitimate it may be to expect the final reports on the intensive survey projects of the 1980s to be explicit about their methodologies and criteria on all these fronts, it is already clear from the prelim- inary reports in print that the survey strategies adopted in the field have varied considerably. It is virtually certain that the approaches adopted toward environmental reconstruction, chronology, and site definition and interpretation will mirror to some de- gree those differences in field techniques and that they will therefore themselves be quite variable. To what extent this variability will hamper the attempts of synthesists to undertake interregional comparisons of settlement patterns can hardly be predicted as yet. Aside from stressing the basic inadequacy of extensive survey data for such efforts, I have sought in the preceding pages merely to draw attention to some of the problems posed by the richer data from systematic and intensive surveys. I suspect that a valid compari- 40 For the sensible suggestion that settlement density should be expressed in terms of sites occupied per unit time rather than per archaeological period, see Twilight 186. Even graphs such as van Andel et al. (supra n. 17) 125 fig. 15 or Runnels and van Andel (supra n. 17) 324 fig. 15, though they provide some estimate of each period's absolute dura- tion, overemphasize changes in settlement pattern from pe- riod to period by representing the site numbers for each period in the form of a single bar. 41 E.g., Cherry in Keller and Rupp (supra n. 22) 394-97; Bintliff and Snodgrass 1985 (supra n. 10) 127-37; Bintliff and Snodgrass 1988 (supra n. 10); Cherry et al.

A second area of intellectual inquiry in mainland Greek prehistory within which greatly increased ac- tivity may be expected in the near future is that of gender studies generally and the definition of wom- en's special role in the transmission of material culture through time and across space in particular. The rea- sons for an increased emphasis on what may be con- sidered by many to be simply contemporary feminism in archaeological garb are first, a significant rise in archaeological publications of all kinds devoted to exploring women's experiences in both the past and the present, and second, a growing interest within Aegean prehistory specifically in industries that are likely to have been in the hands of women throughout much of the mainland Greek Bronze Age, notably weaving and pottery production.44 To these may be added an enhanced emphasis of late on the roles played by women in prehistoric Aegean religion.45 THE EARLY BRONZE AGE (EARLY HELLADIC I- III, CA. 3100/3000-2050/2000 B.C.)

One of the more significant advances in recent years has been a greatly improved understanding of the EH period in the southern and western Peloponnese, that is, throughout a good part of the region covered by this review that lies outside the so-called "heart- land" of mainland Greek Bronze Age cultures,47 the modern nomes of the Argolid, Corinthia, Attica, Boeotia, and Euboea. This improved knowledge, re- sulting from the publication of excavations at the sites of Kouphovouno and Ayios Stephanos in Laconia,48 Voidhokoilia in Messenia,49 and Ayios Dhimitrios, Strephi, Olympia, and Elis in Elis,50 will soon be fur- ther enhanced by the final publication of the Laconia Survey and by preliminary reports on the Pylos Proj- ect.5' By contrast, the nomes of Arcadia in the center of the Peloponnese and Achaea in the north continue to be poorly documented, despite recent reports of important discoveries at the sites of Sphakovouni and Steno in Arcadia and Aigion in Achaea.52 North of the Isthmus of Corinth and outside of the "heart- land," recent fieldwork involving the EH period has focused more on the location of new sites than on their excavation. Among the more promising of these are Mitrou in Locris, Amphissa in Phocis, and the underwater site at Platygiali near Astakos in Aetolia.53 The principal discoveries affecting our understand- ing of EH material culture, however, have as before been made in the northeastern Peloponnese and east- central Greece. Deep soundings as well as the expo- sure of substantial horizontal expanses of EH settle- ments at the major sites of Tiryns in the Argolid, Kolonna on Aegina, and Thebes in Boeotia have pro- vided us with a series of settlement sequences that can be profitably compared with the heretofore paradig- matic stratification for the later EH and MH periods University of Heidelberg with a working title of Kulturwan- del auf dem griechischen Festland und den Kykladen im spditen dritten Jahrtausend v.

The recent success of Dousougli, Weisshaar, and Pullen in isolating a distinctive ceramic inventory characteristic of the later EH I phase in the Argolid and the Corinthia marks an important step toward bringing this transition into sharper focus. Defined through excavations at Kephalari Magoula and Tsoungiza and by large collections of surface mate- rials at Makrovouni and Talioti, this "Talioti" ceramic assemblage is important not only in chronological but also in spatial terms. Since it differs appreciably from the contemporary assemblage recovered at Eutresis, which has for so long defined the EH I phase for the entire Helladic mainland, it makes possible the rec- ognition of regional ceramic types for the first time in this earliest phase of the Bronze Age.60 By far the best-known subdivision of the mainland Greek Early Bronze Age is that termed EH II. The broad outlines of cultural change during this interval of some three to four centuries have recently been sketched by Wiencke, who discerns within it two prin- cipal stages of development.61 Peculiar to the latter is a building form, variously termed the "corridor house" or the House of Tiles type, which has been recognized over the past decade at some half-dozen or more sites from Thebes in Boeotia to Akovitika in Messenia (fig. 3).62 Such structures exhibit a charac- teristic ground plan and elevation: rectangular, free- standing, and composed of a linear series of square to rectangular halls, they are flanked on the long sides by corridors, which often serve as stairwells leading up to a second story. They also share a number of other features, such as relatively high and broad socles of fieldstones, rectangular rooftiles of terracotta and occasionally of schist, and aligned off-center door- ways. Unlike the later Minoan and Mycenaean tradi- tions of monumental architecture or that of contem- porary Troy, this newly recognized EH II tradition makes no use of cut stone masonry nor of half-tim- bered construction. Aside from rectangular corridor houses, it features fortifications (as at Lerna and Thebes, and possibly at Kolonna as well), a very large cylindrical building, the so-called Rundbau at Tiryns, which may have functioned as a communal granary, and a few large, circular tumuli whose function is at present uncertain.63 In contradistinction to the earli- est forms of monumental architecture in Minoan Crete, this early tradition of large-scale buildings on the Greek mainland seems to consist exclusively of structures for the living: monumental tombs are un- attested until the EH III phase, at which point the first of the burial tumuli appear; they go on to become quite common in the subsequent MH period.64 Or- dinary EH II domestic architecture has enough in 60 A.

Their typological anomalousness is likely to be a reflection of their location at the northwestern limits of the area sur- veyed here, as far away from any known corridor house as is possible within this region. There is no evidence that the newly discovered EH II tumulus within the Altis at Olympia served a funerary pur- pose (J. Rambach, pers. comm., August 1992; see also Kyr- ieleis, supra n. 50). Both the date and the function of the so-called Ampheion at Thebes, a plundered cist within a very large tumulus, continue to be disputed (Spyropoulos [supra n. 54]; I. and E. Loucas, "La tombe desjumeaux divins Amphion et Zethos et la fertilite de la terre beotienne," in Thanatos 95-106; Twilight 133-34, with extensive references to assessments of this monument in publications dating between 1976 and 1991). Thus this structure, however impressive, hardly con- stitutes convincing evidence for the existence of monumental funerary architecture in the EH II "heartland."

At the time of the Gazetteer's publication, analysis of this transition was typically focused on what were per- ceived as profound differences distinguishing EH III material culture from that of the preceding phase. The type site for this transition in the northeastern Peloponnese was Lerna, where, in addition to dra- matic changes in much of the artifactual assemblage, a burnt destruction horizon separated these two phases. J.L. Caskey, the excavator of Lerna, had in- voked an invasion of the Peloponnese by warlike new- comers to explain this sudden change in material culture.68 The discovery of a seemingly unrelated EBA assemblage in the mid-1960s in the basal levels of a deep sounding at Lefkandi on the south-central coast of Euboea initially had little impact on interpre- tations of the EH II-III transition. Even though he correctly identified the relative chronological position of this new assemblage (which he christened "Lef- kandi I") and recognized its western Anatolian affin- ities, Renfrew in his extremely influential survey and interpretation of the Aegean Early Bronze Age saw no significant formal connection between it and the assemblages that he considered to precede (EH II = "Korakou culture") and follow (EH III = "Tiryns culture") it.69 In spite of his predisposition to avoid using invasionist hypotheses to explain cultural change, Renfrew frankly admitted that the shift in material culture was so pronounced and abrupt in the case of the EH II-III transition that it stood out as "more marked than any other subsequently seen in Greek prehistory, or any previously documented since the development of farming life."'0 Thus, although by the later 1970s the practice of invoking invasions was generally frowned upon as an old-fashioned and oversimplified interpretative strategy, in this particu- lar instance that explanation still attracted a wide following.71 But scholarly opinion on this issue began to shift in the very year of the Gazetteer's publication. First, at- tention was directed toward some of the continuities in material culture between the EH II and III phases at Lerna, initially in terms of the pottery of the two periods and subsequently in terms of the chipped stone tools and terracotta anchor-shaped objects of uncertain use.72 Second, and far more importantly, stratified settlement sequences spanning the EH II- III transition were published from the major sites of Kolonna on Aegina, Thebes in Boeotia, and Tiryns in the Argolid, which revealed that the abrupt and pervasive changes in material culture combined with a violent destruction that characterized this transition at Lerna were anything but typical.73 At Tiryns, within sight of Lerna across the Gulf of Argos, the German excavations of the late 1970s and early 1980s dem- onstrated that even a site within the immediate vicinity 66 For the existence of a hierarchy of settlements during the EH II period, see Pullen (supra n. 46) 344-64; Runnels and van Andel (supra n. 17), esp. 311-14; Kilian (supra n. 20) 63; Twilight 189-90, 192. The number of steps in this hierarchy is disputed, two (Pullen) or three (Runnels and van Andel) being identified in the southern Argolid and as many as four in the main Argive plain (Kilian). For the notion that the presence of a corridor house at a site is in and by itself an indicator of a site's loftier position within a regional settlement hierarchy, see Pullen (supra n. 46) 359. 67 D.

Konsola, "Stages of Urban Transformation in the Early Helladic Period," in EHAU 9- 19. The hierarchy identified by Konsola, consisting of just two tiers, is limited to excavated sites of the EH II period. Pullen (supra n. 46) 355, on the other hand, argues on the basis of site size alone for the existence of a two-tiered hierarchy among sites explored by surface survey in the southern Argolid as early as EH I. Mee (pers. comm.) has suggested that a similar two-tiered settlement hierarchy ex- isted on Methana in the EH period, again on the basis of site size. 68 Caskey (supra n. 59) 299-302, reiterated with flourishes by Vermeule (supra n. 59) 29-31. 69 Renfrew, Emergence (supra n. 24) 103-105, for an as- sessment of the "Lefkandi I" assemblage based on the work of David French, who drew attention to its potential signifi- cance as early as 1968 (Twilight 204). 70 Renfrew, Emergence (supra n. 24) 116. 71 Gazetteer 373-74; S.

RUTTER [AJA 97 could produce contemporary, yet significantly differ- ent assemblages of pottery from those in use at Lerna, and this within a stratified sequence that also featured at least two destruction levels, one at and one shortly after the end of the EH II phase. At Kolonna, the Austrian excavators claimed that the EH II to III transition at their site was gradual rather than abrupt and featured a major destruction horizon not at or near the end of the EH II phase but rather toward the end of EH III (Kolonna V). Finally, at Thebes, excavations by the Greek Archaeological Service have revealed a culturally distinct horizon between levels characterized by typical EH II and EH III artifactual types. This intermediate horizon, in which EH II ceramic forms occur together with forms typical of the "Lefkandi I" assemblage, has been termed "group B" by Konsola to distinguish it from the canonical EH II pottery typical of "group A" deposits at Thebes.74 Although burnt destruction levels occur in both "group B" and subsequent EH III strata at Thebes, it has thus far been impossible to establish whether these destructions were site-wide or, instead, more localized events.75 Shortly after I was given the responsibility of pub- lishing the EH III pottery from Lerna and just before the results of these important new excavations at Ti- ryns, Kolonna, and Thebes began to be reported, I suggested that many of the new features that distin- guish the EH III pottery of Lerna IV from that of the preceding EH II settlement, or Lerna III, owed their existence to a process of fusion between the standard EH II ceramic repertoire and that of the "Lefkandi I" assemblage.76 One of the weaknesses of Caskey's invasion theory had been that much of the material culture of those whom he identified as invad- ers, namely the EH III inhabitants of Lerna IV, had no obvious antecedents either locally within the north- eastern Peloponnese or anywhere outside that area.77 In proposing that the EH III ceramic assemblage at Lerna was a hybrid product of originally distinct EH II and "Lefkandi I" ceramic traditions, I was in effect suggesting that Caskey's invaders could be traced back to central Greece.7' For there, not only at Thebes but at coastal sites in eastern Attica (Raphina) and on both Aegina (Kolonna) and Euboea (Lefkandi, Manika), as well as at other inland sites in Boeotia (Eutresis, Or- chomenos), the EH II and "Lefkandi I" ceramic tra- ditions have repeatedly been shown to have coexisted for some time before the appearance of an EH III ceramic assemblage identifiable as the merged prod- uct of these two. By contrast, nowhere in the Pelo- ponnese has the "Lefkandi I" ceramic assemblage been attested. Thus, if the "Lefkandi I" assemblage is admitted to be ancestral to the EH III ceramic types of both the Peloponnese (Argolid, Corinthia, Achaea, Arcadia, and Elis) and central Greece (Boeotia, Attica, Phocis, and Euboea), the fusion process must have taken place somewhere in central Greece. How long this process lasted, and what the resulting hybrid ceramic inventory of the EH III phase signifies in human terms, are questions for which answers must await the discovery and publication of a good deal 74 Konsola (supra n. 54) 119-23, 143-46. 75 Relatively few of the finds associated with these various destruction deposits have as yet been published. In addition, the locations at which these discoveries have been made are fairly small building lots scattered throughout the heart of modern Thebes, in the southern part of the ancient city's acropolis known as the Kadmeia (Twilight 131-33). 76 Rutter (supra ns. 36 and 72), summarized in Twilight 204-10.

For the time being, it seems clear from the multiple building levels represented by the "Lef- kandi I" strata at Lefkandi itself, as well as from the number of EBA levels in which "Lefkandi I" ceramic types occur at Pefkakia on the Thessalian coast just south of Volos, that the "Lefkandi I" and later EH II ceramic assemblages were in concurrent use for as much as a century or even longer.79 Whether or not the appearance of EH III pottery should be interpreted as the result of an invasion depends, among other things, upon the extent to which the new features of this ceramic assemblage can be shown to be associated with other artifactual novelties, signs of violence, indications from collec- tions of human bone for the introduction of a new population element, or evidence for a change in lan- guage.80 Fors6n has recently conducted a thorough- going review of Caskey's hypothesis that the Pel- oponnese was invaded at the end of the EH II phase by warlike newcomers and subsequently infiltrated at the transition to the MH period by smaller and less bellicose human groups.8' From a detailed examina- tion of the evidence from 89 excavated sites in the Peloponnese and east-central Greece, she concludes that destruction levels that may be closely dated and interpreted with some confidence as site-wide do not cluster either spatially or temporally. Rather, such destructions seem to occur haphazardly more or less throughout the EH II and EH III phases. Thus, Caskey's contention that the burning of the House of the Tiles at Lerna was just one of many in a wide- spread horizon of more or less contemporary destruc- tions does not stand up to close scrutiny. Much the same is true of the set of artifactual novelties that Caskey attributed to his warlike invaders, items such as apsidal buildings, terracotta "anchors," stone shaft- hole hammer-axes, and large non-funerary tumuli such as that raised over the House of the Tiles. Not only did these distinctive artifactual types appear at different times in different regions within the larger study area but they appear to have entered the area from several different directions. It is consequently difficult to associate them as a group with any single population movement. In showing that Caskey's criteria for an invasion of the northeastern Peloponnese, based on his discov- eries at Lerna, do not apply at other sites even within the Argolid, much less further afield, Fors6n's study should mark the starting point of a new generation of investigations into the significance of the EH II- III transition. Full publication of the relevant strata at Lerna, Tiryns, Thebes, and Lefkandi is clearly a prerequisite to further progress. The suggestion has been made, on the basis of the stratification observed at Tiryns, that Lerna may have been abandoned for a short but critical interval during this transition.82 The argument in favor of a brief hiatus in Lerna's occupation would have been far stronger had the Tirynthian evidence been supported by that from Asine and Berbati, as was originally claimed but as has since been disproved.83 In point of fact, there is probably no hiatus in settlement at either Lerna or Tiryns at any point during this transition. Instead, the significant differences in material culture between the two at various stages during the transition prob- ably reflect the differing circumstances in which the change in question occurred. And if these circum- stances could differ appreciably between two sites less than five hours' walk apart, they could presumably differ even more noticeably at sites further removed from each other. It is therefore a mistake to identify any particular site during this period of transition as 79 E.

Yet in the long term, the very differences between the transitional processes at a growing num- ber of sites should prove to be far more informative concerning the nature and pace of, and ultimately the reasons for, that transition than a greater degree of homogeneity in material culture would ever have been. We should therefore welcome the variety in the stratigraphic sequences spanning the EH II-III tran- sition that we have been finding rather than insist that they be uniform. At the same time, we should be doing our best to recover more in the way of non- artifactual data, which has all too often been ignored. For example, human skeletal remains of this period, with the exception of the bones from two or three cemeteries, have not been systematically collected.85 Yet they may provide us with the best evidence avail- able, particularly as early as the third millennium B.C., for the detection of intrusive population ele- ments. Greater attention paid to the recovery of faunal and botanical remains might also pay rich div- idends. We already have reason to believe that the domesticated horse first appeared in southern Greece in the EH III period. It is not unreasonable to expect that the introduction of this domesticate might have entailed changes in the ranges of plants and animals being exploited by the inhabitants of this area. Alter- natively, perhaps the appearance of the horse is more significant for the changes it accompanied than for the changes it may have caused.86 On another front, the dramatic differences between the EH II and EH III repertoires of cooking pottery suggest that a shift in the manner of food preparation, possibly signaling a change in diet as well, may have been a facet of this cultural transition.87 Finally, a good deal of evidence from the Argolid for a major episode of alluviation in the later Early Bronze Age indicates that important changes in the environment may have occurred, whether natural and the result of a climatological shift or anthropogenic and the consequences of a failure to make adequate provision against topsoil runoff through the construction and maintenance of terrace walls.88 EH tombs and burial customs, though occasionally the subject of synthetic analyses, have not attracted very much attention for the simple reason that EH tombs are not very numerous and rarely contain very much in the way of grave goods.89 The vast majority of known EH tombs date from the EH II phase; EH III tombs are rare, especially those of adults, and EH 84 The most useful variety of chronological chart should thus be of the sort published recently by Maran (supra n. 46) 370 fig. 25, in which the stratigraphic sequences at eight different sites are correlated without any single site being accorded greater significance.

In the EH III ceramic repertoire, baking dishes, stands, and ring bases have all disappeared; the common types are wide-mouthed jars with everted rims, either without handles or with a single vertical strap to the shoulder; also quite frequent are pedestal-footed cups with multiply perforated bodies, rim-handled wide- mouthed jars decorated with coarse incisions, and shoulder- handled cups which are essentially miniature versions of the shoulder-handled jars (Rutter [supra n. 76 and infra n. 110]).

When one considers how much of our appreciation of both Early Minoan (EM) and Early Cycladic (EC) material culture stems from discoveries made in the tombs and cemeteries of Crete and the central Aegean islands, one is com- pelled to wonder whether the Helladic mainland may not have been equally rich in terms of representa- tional art or artifacts produced from metal or exotic stones. The nature of EH II representational art has rarely been explored, probably because of a commonly held perception that not very much of it exists.90 But the corpus of EH II representational art has been suffi- ciently augmented over the past 15 years by finds of terracotta objects from settlement contexts that its general character and the ways in which it differs from contemporary art on Crete and in the Cyclades have become clearer. Perhaps the most numerous items within this enlarged corpus are figurines of quadrupeds, sheep and cattle.91 A cache of bull figu- rines found at Lithares, taken as evidence for a shrine in preliminary reports, is no longer so interpreted in the site's final publication. This change of opinion, reflecting an altogether appropriate degree of caution on the part of the excavator, draws attention to how little is known about EH II religion, a topic conspic- 5cm a scm Fig. 4.

Wiencke, "Art and the World of the Early Bronze Age," in Cadogan (supra n. 71) 69-92, and M.B. Cosmopoulos, "The Development of Iconography in the Early Bronze 2 Aegean," in Iconography 87-96 for such analyses, which, however, are not restricted to representa- tional art. For figurines and models as well as miniature containers, see now C. Marangou, EIAd2AIA: Figurines et miniatures du NMolithique recent et du Bronze ancien en Grece (BAR-IS 576, Oxford 1992). Whether or not EH II repre- sentational art flourished in media and forms (e.g., stone and metal vessels, jewelry, seals, and weapons) likely to be found only in tombs is a question that cannot yet be answered with any confidence in view of the relatively small number of EH II tombs that have been excavated and published, particularly in areas of the mainland exhibiting little contact with, and hence influence from, the Cyclades. Pullen's 1985 review of the evidence (supra n. 89) makes abundantly clear that the only site in the Peloponnese at which substantial numbers of EH tombs have been found is Pavlopetri in southeastern Laconia. These tombs have not been excavated, however, so their dating to the EH period rests entirely on their form and we are ignorant of their contents. By contrast, a number of fairly large EH II cemeteries in Attica (Aghios Kosmas, Tsepi), Boeotia (Lithares, Likeri, Paralimni), and Euboea (Manika) have been excavated. The finds from these central Greek tombs, when published, typically resemble those from contemporary Cycladic cist graves and occasion- ally contain anthropomorphic stone or bone figurines (e.g., "RAP I" figs. 10-11). 91 W.W. Phelps, "Prehistoric Figurines from Corinth," Hesperia 56 (1987) 233-53 and Cosmopoulos (supra n. 90) 90, in addition to the titles cited in ns. 92 and 94 below. Phelps considers several of these figurines to be images of slaughtered and gutted animals because of the slits in their bellies, but Pullen (supra n. 32) 50 n. 55 has drawn attention to the problems connected with such an interpretation and prefers to interpret the slashes in purely technological terms, as provisions made for the thorough firing of the artifacts in question.

In the case of a small stone vase found at Tiryns, such a protome even serves as a handle.95 Given the location of these protomes at the bases of handles on closed vases and their occasional function as handles when placed near the rim of either open or closed shapes,96 we may be justified in identifying as handles the spouts of sauceboats decorated with such protomes. That is, when ornamented with a protome in such a way as to block the end of its spout, a sauceboat may have functioned as a dipper, the "spout" playing the role of a handle.

For example, a row of scorpions added in a light- firing slip over a dark-slipped ground decorates the handle of an askos from Tiryns (fig. 9).97 A terracotta hearth rim from the same site is decorated in relief with a frieze of quadrupeds, one of which appears to be suckling its young (fig. 10).98 Four of the 70 seal devices that can be restored from sealings found in the House of the Tiles at Lerna bear representational motifs. Three feature single, centrally placed spiders, and the last a set of four narrow-necked jugs, which from their shape would be more at home in a "Lef- kandi I" than an ordinary EH II ceramic assemblage (fig. 11).99 A comprehensive listing and detailed anal- ysis of EH II representational art lie outside the scope of this essay.

Equally dis- tinctive are the range of artifactual types that serve as vehicles for such art and the selection of particular locations on these vessels for the display of represen- tational motifs. For example, animal protomes on terracotta vessels, although relatively rare, are more often intelligible as an adjunct or appendage to a handle than as an ornamental elaboration of a spout or mouth. In other words, such protomes function less often like the heads of zoomorphic rhyta, which are such a common feature of Aegean art of the Middle and Late Bronze Ages, than might have been expected. Peloponnesian pictorialism in this period is thus quite different, for example, from that which flourishes in the contemporary Cyclades with its em- phasis on three-dimensional human and zoomorphic forms in stone and incised two-dimensional represen- tations of ships and fish on dark-burnished frying pans. The topic of trade in the Early Bronze Age has been the focus of as much recent scholarly discussion and debate as any other aspect of human activity in the Aegean during the third millennium B.C.o00 Some of the goods being passed around, particularly vol- canic stones such as obsidian from Melos and andesite from several potential sources in the Saronic Gulf (Aegina, Methana, Poros), had been playing a role in mainland Greek exchange networks for centuries be- ' 0 5cm :' i i i Fig. 8.

As raw materials, obsidian, chert, andesite, and metallic ores were probably accessible to anyone who was willing and able to travel to the appropriate quarries or mines to help himself.'04 Blades of obsidian and chert, on the other hand, like querns or mortars of andesite, are more likely to have been distributed from centers of production located somewhere other than at the 0 5cm Fig. 10.

For example, in studying the chipped stone from EH and MH levels at Lerna, Runnels found relatively few formal differences be- tween the toolkits of Lerna III (EH II) and Lerna IV (EH III). The principal differences between the chipped stone assemblages of these two horizons are the results of economic rather than technological change: a higher frequency in Lerna III of locally produced obsidian pressure blades, in tandem with a substantial number of imported chert pressure blades, serves as evidence not only for specialized craftsmen but also for extensive exchanges of their products, evidently involving the stockpiling of these at local 105 For obsidian and chert blades, see Runnels (supra n. 72) 360; for andesite mortars, see Runnels 1988 (supra n. 35).

RUTTER [AJA 97 centers and their redistribution to lower-level sites in the regional site hierarchy. In other words, the prin- cipal difference between the chipped stone industries of these two periods lay in the exchange of tool blanks: such exchange existed during the later EH II horizon represented by Building BG and the House of the Tiles, but not during the subsequent EH III phase.o107 Attas's employment of neutron activation analysis (NAA) to study the traffic in pottery within the north- eastern Peloponnese succeeded, among other things, in establishing that ordinary vessel types were ex- changed between EH II communities, despite the fact that each produced the same shape decorated in the same fashion.108 These vessels were in some instances small open shapes, sauceboats and bowls, which could not have served as transport containers but rather must have been exchanged for their own sake. Pullen has noted that there is no spatial patterning in Attas's NAA data.'09 The lack of directionality in these EH II pottery exchanges suggests that pottery may have been exchanged less for economic than for social reasons during EH II, that is, chiefly to promote stylistic uniformity and hence a sense of societal cohe- sion.' 10 Hypotheses concerning the mechanics of specific exchange networks such as the two briefly outlined above require testing against other bodies of EH II lithic and ceramic data. At this point it seems to be impossible to generalize about the nature of EH II exchange mechanisms, but it does look as though trade during the EH III phase worked in a signifi- cantly different way, with respect to both ceramics and chipped stone. Systematic intensive surveys have had an enormous impact on our understanding of the shifting patterns of human settlement on the Greek mainland during the third millennium B.C. To begin with, most survey directors have reported locating approximately 10 times as many EH sites as had previously been docu- mented in their survey areas (table 1)."' But to pre- sent the figures for total sites occupied at one time or another over roughly a thousand years is, of course, to tell only a small part of the story. For example, several surveys (Berbati, Methana, Nemea, Southern Argolid) have reported a sharp decline in the number of sites from EH II to EH III,112 while at least two (Laconia, Skourta Plain) report finding no evidence whatsoever for EH III occupation."13 The two last surveys call for additional comment. In the area of the Skourta plain, the absence of EH III pottery, which can be very difficult to recognize when heavily worn and highly fragmentary, is pre- ceded by an even more striking absence of EH II sherd material, which is notoriously easy to identify even when small and worn. Although a sizable num- ber of sites dating from the very beginning of the Bronze Age have been located in this upland plain (table 1), they all appear to have been abandoned by the onset of the EH II phase. The fact that it was uninhabited for much of the EH period may explain why the Skourta plain exhibits no evidence for a major episode of erosion during the EH II phase, which has been documented in both the southern Argolid and the Argive plain and which has been attributed to overly aggressive clearing by farmers of the natural vegetation on hillslopes."4 107 Runnels (supra n. 72), esp. 388. The EH II situation with respect to the production by specialized craftsmen of obsidian and chert blades is paralleled in the earlier Neolithic (Perles [supra n. 100] 125-37, 148-50). 108 M.

"' Only the Boeotia survey, among intensive surveys for which more than a single season's results are available, re- ports a significantly smaller increase in the number of EH sites identified. Bintliff's theory of a "cumulative disappear- ance of sites" (also called "cumulative site-loss" or "progres- sive disappearance") to explain the relatively small numbers of prehistoric sites located in the Boeotia survey perhaps no longer needs to be invoked in the face of the more plentiful comparative data now available from other intensive surveys (table 1). If site density is expressed as the number of sites per unit area surveyed, the Bronze Age figures from Boeotia are not wildly out of line with those from other areas. What is different about the figures for the Boeotia survey is the larger number of prehistoric sites known in the area before survey began. Table 1 also shows that the increase in the number of EH sites is routinely far greater than that noted for MH sites (again, with the exceptions of the Boeotia and Pylos surveys) and is often comparable to (Berbati, Boeotia, Skourta Plain, Southern Argolid) or even in excess of (La- conia, Methana, Nemea, Oropos) that recorded for LH sites. 112 Wright et al.

But perhaps such a lacuna is illusory. Could it be that the relatively high numbers of EH sites identified in the Laconia Survey (table 1) reflect a longer-lived EH II culture in the southern than in the northern Peloponnese?"17 What can one say about those intensively surveyed areas that have yielded evidence for EH III occupa- tion? While it is true that the decline in site numbers from the EH II to the EH III phase is not as drastic when expressed as sites occupied per unit time instead of simple totals for each period,"8 the drop in site density is nevertheless pronounced. Since there is no evidence for an increase in average site size in EH III--if anything, most EH III sites appear to have been smaller than their EH II predecessors-there ought to have been a significant drop in population at or toward the end of the EH II phase. But there is no obvious indication of higher mortality at this time in the form of a rise in the number of burials"19 nor of emigration in the sudden appearance of Helladic cultural traits elsewhere. The problem may be simply that we have exaggerated the suddenness of the changes in settlement pattern between the EH II and EH III phases by neglecting to date periods of occu- pation at EH II sites as precisely as possible. That is, the decline in site numbers may have been a phenom- enon that began well before the end of EH II and culminated in EH III rather than beginning at that time. 120 There is evidence for the development of increas- ing social complexity at the level of the individual site during the course of the long EH II phase, which may prove to be connected with the emergence of a hier- archy of settlement at the regional level.'121 At the moment, however, not enough data have been pub- lished for an informed judgment to be made on such ponnese, see Zangger in Boardman and Bell (supra n. 31) 136, with support from pollen data published by Jahns (supra n. 33) and evidence for contemporary usage of the plow published by Pullen (supra n. 32); for the Skourta plain as a region exhibiting no evidence of a major erosional episode in the EBA or subsequently, see Zangger (supra) 136-38. In reviewing the evidence for such erosional epi- sodes in Greece, Zangger draws attention to how their dates vary (LN in Thessaly, EH II in the Argolid, and never in the case of the Skourta plain): "Thus there is no general pattern for environmental reconstruction. Each area must be ex- amined individually" (p. 138). The same emphasis on the variability of individual spatial units might equally well be applied to reconstructions of the transition from EH II to EH III culture or to reconstructions of the mechanics whereby raw materials or particular categories of finished goods were exchanged. 15 Rutter (supra n. 72) 15; Dickinson (supra n. 20) 110. 116 R.J.

Howell is aware of the parallels between this earliest "MH" deposit from Nichoria and EH III pottery from the Argolid, as is Dickinson (supra n. 20) 110. 17 For this suggestion, which Dickinson (supra n. 24) 133 has described as a "counsel of despair," see Rutter (supra n. 72) 15 and n. 38. 118s For such an approach to the comparison of site densities between periods, see supra n. 40.

But this continues to be a unique discovery insofar as the large number of indi- viduals comprising both sexes and several different age groups is concerned. For an estimate of a population decline in the southern Argolid from ca. 1900 during the EH II phase to 500 or less in EH III and the ensuing MH period, see Runnels and van Andel (supra n. 17) 325 n. 6. 120 For an interesting discussion of these and other issues (e.g., the problem of the relative "visibility" of EH II vs. EH III pottery), see Twilight 176-96. Note especially Forsen's comparison (195) of our understanding of EH patterns of settlement before and after the advent of systematic intensive survey. By focusing here on the EH II-III transition, I do not mean to give it any special significance. Many of the same kinds of issues and problems would arise in a consid- eration of the transition from FN to EH I or from EH III to the MH period. Unfortunately, the evidence available for the earlier of these two transitions is still too sparse for much to be said about it. The later transition from EH III to MH is surveyed by Forsen (supra) 176-96. 121 For the increasing complexity of EH II society with time, see Wiencke (supra n. 46); for settlement hierarchies during this phase, supra ns. 66-67 and Wiencke (supra) 499.</page><page sequence="30">774 JEREMY B. RUTTER [AJA 97 critical questions as when and where a distinct settle- ment hierarchy can first be discerned, of how many levels or tiers such hierarchies consisted (and was this number a constant from region to region and sub- phase to subphase), and what connections existed between the appearance of a hierarchy of settlement and the rise of monumental architecture in the form of corridor houses and fortification systems. The kinds of information recovered through intensive sur- face survey have opened up a number of new ways of investigating particular cultures or periods of time. Yet much of intensive survey's potential is dependent on the accurate identification and closest possible dat- ing of the heavily weathered artifacts recovered. The ability to assign increasingly more precise dates to these worn and fragmentary artifacts and to comment upon their function when they were whole can only come about through more finely tuned chronologies and significant contextual associations. These, in turn, are the products of excavation rather than survey. THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE (MIDDLE HELLADIC I-III, CA. 2050/2000-1680 B.C.) AND THE EARLY MYCENAEAN PERIOD (LATE HELLADIC I-IIB, CA. 1680-1445/1415 B.C.) Shortly before the Gazetteer's appearance, one of its authors published a thorough survey of the MH pe- riod and the first century or two of the subsequent Mycenaean era, which today remains the most com- prehensive synthesis of the half-millennium repre- sented by this segment of mainland Greek pre- history.'22 Yet enough new material has been found or published during the past 15 years to make Dick- inson's classic survey now more a point of departure than the last word on the subject. The terminology ordinarily employed to describe the mainland Greek Middle Bronze Age continues to be a bit awkward. At its beginning, the labels "EH III" and "MH" put far too much emphasis on changes that seem relatively minor: first, the switch by potters from iron-based to manganese-based slips as materials with which to decorate vases; and second, a significant increase in the exchange of certain categories of fin- ished goods between mainland coastal sites and the islands of the Cyclades and Crete.'23 The reason be- hind the first change has yet to be investigated in any detail; the second is usually considered to reflect Mi- noan and Cycladic enterprise, the mainlanders play- ing the passive role of disadvantaged natives being irradiated by their more progressive and outward- looking neighbors across the water to the east and south. At its other chronological terminus, MH cul- ture is distinguished from the earliest stage of Myce- naean culture by a more impressive array of changes: first, the appearance of enormous wealth, in the form of locally produced as well as imported goods, at a handful of sites in the southwestern and northeastern Peloponnese and perhaps one or two more in central Greece; and second, the aping of Minoan fashions in ceramics, certain categories of metalwork (chiefly weaponry, jewelry, and containers), and possibly also funerary architecture."24 This later set of changes, 122 O.T.P.K.

This term, encompassing sev- eral shorter-lived ceramic phases (MH III, LH I, early LH IIA), has until recently served to mask the precise sequence in which several critical changes occurred. Aside from refining a ceramic relative chronology in order to sequence these changes as a preliminary to explaining them, archaeologists need to address the question of why the pace of cultural change during the three to four centuries prior to the Shaft Grave era should have been so slow, particularly in compar- ison to contemporary developments on Crete and even in the Cyclades. In what follows, I will first survey advances affecting all phases of the MH period before moving on to topics that are peculiar to the period of cultural ferment that is the Shaft Grave era. Of special significance for the MH period as a whole, I would single out four recent contributions to the body of scholarly knowledge, which I list here in roughly their sequence of publication. First, Zerner has presented the evidence from Lerna for the EH III-MH transition and for the first stage of the full MH period.'25 In this groundbreaking study, she identified and carefully began the process of defining two groups of ceramic fabrics that were imported to Lerna in large quantities throughout the MH period and into the earliest Mycenaean phase, LH I. The first of these she termed "Gold Mica Fabric," after the biotite inclusions that make this fabric relatively easy to recognize.126 Earlier scholars had suggested that these were Aeginetan products on the grounds that several categories of painted vases containing the dis- tinctive biotite inclusions were particularly common on Aegina and that these same categories were widely distributed all around the Saronic Gulf, at the geo- graphical center of which the island of Aegina is located.'27 Zerner's contribution has been to extend this identification to three or four unpainted classes, including cooking pottery, and to arrange for the petrographic characterization of samples taken from all these decoratively distinct but petrographically linked classes.'" With these petrographic characteri- zations she has made an even stronger case for Aegina as the source of this pottery, while significantly ex- panding the functional and chronological ranges as well as the sheer quantity of pottery produced within this distinctive ceramic tradition. The actual centers of production, though presumably located in the vi- cinity of the island's principal prehistoric site at Ko- lonna on the northwest coast, have yet to be located. The second fabric category of imported pottery richly represented in the MH village of Lerna V has been termed "Lustrous Decorated" by Zerner. Like the Aeginetan material just described, "Lustrous Dec- orated" pottery includes fired fabrics of several dif- ferent grades of fineness, which are linked, in this case, not so much by distinctive inclusions as by the use of a lustrous iron-based paint that often serves as the ground for abstract motifs overpainted in matt white and purple."29 In their ranges of shapes and 113-21, 123-29, and 131-36, respectively.

Harland, D. French, S. Hiller, and R. Wiinsche as scholars who have played significant roles in the identification of painted Aeginetan ceramics during the MH and early My- cenaean periods. To these may now be added H. Siedentopf (infra n. 138). 128 Zerner's unpainted Aeginetan classes, or wares, are Plain, Dark-Burnished, and Coarse (or Kitchen Ware): see the list in S. Dietz, C. Zerner, and G. Nordquist, "Concerning the Classification of Late Middle Helladic Wares in the Ar- golid," Hydra 5 (1988) 15-16. For the chronological differ- entiation of Aeginetan shapes and decoration, see Zerner 1988 (supra n. 126). Maran (supra n. 126) 195-98 has since added a class of solidly painted Aeginetan pottery in which the paint's color varies from red to dark gray or black on a single vase and thus appears to signal an iron-based rather than manganese-based paint or slip. 129 Zerner 1986 (supra n. 126) 66-68, fig. 1; Zerner 1988 (supra n. 126), esp. 6-10, figs. 24-41.</page><page sequence="32">776 JEREMY B. RUTTER [AJA 97 patterns, the vases produced in this "Lustrous Deco- rated" category are Minoanizing but not purely Mi- noan. Their place of production is as yet unknown, but was in all probability a single site located on the coast of the southeastern Peloponnese or on the island of Kythera.o30 Both "Gold Mica" and "Lustrous Dec- orated" vessels often bear simple incised or impressed marks made before firing (so-called potters' marks), but the marking systems associated with the two fabric groups differ systematically insofar as the locations of the marks and their actual forms are concerned.'31 With her dissertation and subsequent publications charting the developments through time of the "Gold Mica" and "Lustrous Decorated" repertoires in terms of the stratification observed at MH-LH I Lerna, Zerner has provided an exceedingly useful relative chronology,'32 and at the same time has sketched the outlines of two remarkably widespread ceramic dis- tribution networks. From published sources alone,'33 a distribution map showing where vessels of the "Gold Mica" fabric group have so far been noted can be drawn (fig. 12). A similar map drawn for the "Lus- trous Decorated" group would not have as many sites indicated and would show a more southerly distribu- tion.134 Evidence for the economic and probably political preeminence of the inhabitants of Aegina during the MH period is by no means restricted to their exports of ceramic containers, which were probably accom- panied by andesite grinding stones (as ballast?) in the ships carrying this pottery to mainland coastal sites. During these centuries the site of Kolonna boasted the most impressive fortifications in the Aegean world after those of Troy. The careful disentanglement by Walter and Felten of several stages of EH III and MH defensive systems at the site, together with their pre- sentation of some of the ceramic evidence for dating them, has made abundantly clear how atypical Ko- lonna is for either a mainland Greek or a Cycladic site of the later third and early second millennia B.C.135 In addition to far-flung trade networks, monumental public architecture, and a system of marking ceramic vessels prior to firing that must be in some way con- nected with their surplus production of tablewares, storage vessels, and cooking pots for export, the Ae- ginetans at Kolonna can lay claim to the earliest known Aegean shaft grave, which furthermore may have held the earliest royal burial attested within the Hel- ladic cultural sphere.'36 The more we learn about Kolonna during the Middle Bronze Age, the more 130 Zerner 1986 (supra n. 126) 67; Dickinson (supra n. 20) 110-11; Zerner (supra n. 123). 131 Zerner 1986 (supra n. 126) 65, 67; Zerner 1988 (supra n. 126) figs. 2-3, 7-8, 12, 16-23 (Aeginetan "Gold Mica"), 31-32, 34, 36 ("Lustrous Decorated"). Examples of compa- rable marks on other imported "Gold Mica" vases are com- mon at numerous sites throughout the southern Aegean, especially at Ayia Irini on Keos (A.H. Bikaki, Keos IV: Ayia Irini: The Potters' Marks [Mainz 1984] passim), Tiryns (H. D6hl, "Bronzezeitliche Graffiti aus Tiryns I: Vor dem Brand eingeritzte Zeichen," Kadmos 17 [1978] 115-49), Kiapha Thiti (Maran [supra n. 126] 184, 187-88, 195 and n. 374), Korakou (Davis [supra n. 36] 246 nos. 106-13, 252 nos. 250- 52, 254, figs. 7, 8, 11), and, of course, Kolonna on Aegina (Walter and Felten [supra n. 54] 125-26, pls. 124-25). 132 The relative chronological subdivisions MH I, MH II, MH III, and LH I applied to the illustrations in Zerner 1988 (supra n. 126) make possible the cross-dating of strata con- taining such types elsewhere (e.g., Maran [supra n. 126] 180-99 passim, 206 n. 430). For a recent discussion of the various subdivisions of the MH period proposed since Blegen published his excavations at Korakou in 1921, see Lambropoulou (infra n. 147) 8-28, appendices B-C. 133 The approximately 30 publications consulted for the preparation of this map are too numerous to list here. Dietz cites many of them in presenting a map of findspots of the Aeginetan Polychrome painted class, produced for the most part in the form of two large open shapes, kraters and basins (ATMA 303-305, fig. 91). These are datable primarily to LH I, though a very few may be earlier and a fair number remained in use, or were perhaps even produced, as late as LH IIA (Maran [supra n. 126] 198-99). 134 Rutter and Zerner (supra n. 3) 77-80; Dickinson (supra n. 20) 110-11; Zerner (supra n. 123). 135 Walter and Felten (supra n. 54). Kolonna was, to be sure, recognized as atypical for a MH site well before this publication appeared (e.g., Dickinson [supra n. 122] 33), but the extent of its differences from any contemporary site in the western Aegean during the period ca. 2200-1700 B.C. has only become clear over the past 15 years. The EH III phases of the fortified town are numbered IV-VI, the MH phases VII-X. For the chronological placement of these relative to the sequences excavated at Lerna, Eutresis, and Lefkandi on the mainland, Ayia Irini and Phylakopi in the Cyclades, and Argissa and Pefkakia in Thessaly, in addition to the EM III-MM III ceramic sequence on Crete, see Maran (supra n. 46) 323-28, 370 fig. 25. The only other fortified town of the MBA in the western Aegean at all comparable is Ayia Irini on Keos, which is not resettled and fortified for the first time until halfway through the period: J.L. Davis, Keos V: Ayia Irini: Period V (Mainz 1986) 104-105; "RAP I" 709 n. 38. For the impact of Aeginetan commerce at an ordinary northeastern Peloponnesian coastal site, see Nord- quist 1987 (infra n. 142) 62-64. 136 For the shaft grave at Kolonna, which contained a bronze sword, gold diadem, and fine decorated pottery of both Minoan and Cycladic (Melian and possibly Kean) man- ufacture, see H.

Long known and often illustrated but only recently published in full, two of these are decorated with longboats and one with a human figure who seems to be standing on top of and 137 In citing the shaft grave at Kolonna as a model imitated by the earliest Mycenaean elite of the Argolid, Hiller (supra n. 124) suggests that this form of grave may have imitated still earlier prototypes in the Cyclades to the east.

RUTTER [AJA 97 contexts in which such ship representations were dis- played at least in part as symbols of status are uncer- tain.140 The ships from Kolonna, on the other hand, decorate large containers designed to hold surplus agricultural produce, presumably a dimension in terms of which status was measured on MH Aegina. In view of the rarity of representational art during this period, even on Aegina, its limited spatial distri- bution may not appear significant. Yet can it really be coincidental that all three examples of such art occur- ring on the large and constantly growing corpus of painted Aeginetan ceramics were found at Kolonna itself?'14 The spears indicated on the fragment illus- trated here as figure 14b suggest that these ships were at least in some cases conceived of as warships. Thus, these Aeginetan symbols alluded to raiding or warfare in addition to-perhaps even instead of-trade or the simple fetching of mineral raw materials (e.g., obsid- ian, metalliferous ores, etc.) from sources that were open to all. In terms of its iconography, then, as well as in its fortification and at least one exceptionally wealthy burial, Kolonna has emerged as a Middle Helladic site without peer on the Greek mainland. For a typical coastal site on the mainland during this same period with which to contrast Kolonna, we are no longer dependent on the well-stratified and continuously oc- cupied but only partially published site of Lerna. With Dietz's publication of a major extramural cemetery and Nordquist's marvelously thorough synthesis of the evidence for all aspects of MH life at the nearby site of Asine just across the Gulf of Argos, we now know considerably more about Asine than we do about any other MH site published.'42 Despite exten- sive excavation over the past 60 years, the site has produced no public architecture, no particularly wealthy tombs or households, and no compelling ev- idence for craft specialization or anything that might be properly called a local industry.,43 There are some possible indications of social ranking in residential structures of varying sizes and room numbers, as well as in burials accompanied by different classes and quantities of grave goods, which have been placed in tombs exhibiting different degrees of architectural complexity. The variability in burial practices, how- ever, may be as much due to differences in gender or age as to any other social variables.'44 Though by no means an impoverished site, at least to judge from a substantial number of securely identified imports and the range of external contacts for which these are evidence, MH Asine was probably not as well-to-do a community as nearby Lerna. Neither site, however, has anything to compare with the varied evidence for both economic and military power that contemporary Kolonna exhibits. At a still humbler level is a site like the late MH hamlet of Tsoungiza whose tiny popu- lation, recent resettlement, and inland location make it appear very poor and isolated in comparison with larger coastal sites to both the north and south.145 By the end of the MH period, then, there may be evi- 140 For the symbolic meaning of longboats, see Broodbank (supra n. 139) 335-37.

But for most of the period's duration, the vast majority of sites were probably comparable to Asine and Lerna, with no site on the mainland rivaling Kolonna on Aegina and few hamlets on the scale of Tsoungiza being founded. The resettlement of Tsoungiza late in the MH pe- riod, as recent intensive survey in addition to both old and new excavations have shown, is but one instance of a far more widespread episode of colonization of the interior. Such resettlements may have occurred not only in other valleys of the northeastern Pelo- ponnese (e.g., Zygouries in the Kleonai valley to the east of Ancient Nemea, Ayia Irini in the Phlius valley to the west) but perhaps also in valley systems as far away as Attica (e.g., Kiapha Thiti just inland of Vari, Panakton in the Skourta plain), Phocis (e.g., Kou- moula, just northeast of and above Delphi), and the southeastern Argolid at much the same time.146 In virtually all of the Peloponnesian cases, abandon- ments near or at the end of the EH III period are followed by resettlement several centuries later in the MH III phase. Whether this pattern of desertion and resettlement is the result of common factors, and to what extent the growth in the number of late MH sites in Attica and Phocis is part of this same resettle- ment phenomenon, must remain open questions pending the publication of more data from both sur- veys and excavations. Preliminary analysis of the data so far available from the Corinthia and the Argolid suggests that significant differences exist between the pattern of MH settlement in the northern, coastal Corinthia and that on the interior to the south, as well as between the latter and that in the southeastern Argolid.147 As Lambropoulou is careful to point out, the abandonment of sites in this region during or at the end of the EH III phase and their MH III reset- tlement are two separate events, which therefore merit individual explanations: although the MH III resettlement of sites in the interior of Attica may parallel events on the interior of the Corinthia, the preceding abandonments of the Skourta plain and Kiapha Thiti in Attica and of the Nemea valley in the Corinthia all took place at different times. The point worth stressing in all of this is that our understanding of MH relative chronology has become sufficiently refined, thanks to excavated and published sequences at sites such as Asine, Kolonna, and Lerna, that we are now able to detect discontinuities in occupation at individual sites through excavation as well as within whole valley systems through intensive surface survey. The intermittent periods of occupation and abandon- ment within the MH period should not come as such a surprise in view of what we have known for some time about fluctuations in settlement densities within both the EH and LH periods. The fact that they do 146 For the depopulation of the Nemea and neighboring valley systems during roughly the first three-quarters of the MH period, followed by the colonization of the interior of both the Argolid and the Corinthia, see Wright et al. 1990 (supra n. 14) 609, 640-42; Rutter (supra n. 145) 452-55.

The evidence from the southeastern Argolid is more tenuous in that it consists entirely of material collected during intensive surface survey: G.

To the sites in the Corinthian interior showing evidence of resettle- ment in the late MH period may probably be added, to judge from the finds on display in the Nemea Museum, the site of Ayia Irini in the Phliasian plain west of Tsoungiza (Gazetteer 67-68 site A71). Further south, Prosymna on the northern fringe of the Argive plain not far east of Mycenae shows a pattern of desertion after EH III and reoccupation in MH III identical to that at Tsoungiza (Lambropoulou 257-67). On the other hand, Berbati, just to the north in its own valley, was occupied throughout the MH period (Lambro- poulou 253-56), during which time, as in the EH III phase, it was the only site in that valley to be occupied (supra n. 9). As was true of the coastal plain in the Corinthia, most of the MH sites located in the Argive plain appear to have been continuously occupied throughout the period (Lambropou- lou 291), but the brief report by Dietz (ATMA 287) on the site of Profitis Elias near Ayios Adrianos excavated in 1981 by Kilian and Deilaki suggests that this site may have been initially settled only late in the MH period.

RUTTER [AJA 97 come as a surprise is eloquent testimony to how little interest, relatively speaking, the MH period has until recently attracted. A brief recapitulation of the four areas in which the most progress has been made toward a fuller understanding of Helladic culture during the Middle Bronze Age makes clear how fundamentally we should revise our previous conception of that period. Through a fuller understanding of the production capacities and distribution zones of the Aeginetan and "Lustrous Decorated" ceramic traditions, an en- hanced appreciation of the extraordinary site of Ko- lonna, a balanced and unusually detailed examination of a typical MH coastal site in the form of Asine, and finally a growing awareness of the changing nature of the pattern of settlement within the period, MH so- ciety is emerging as considerably more varied and complex than conventionally portrayed. A number of other developments have played a role in this trans- formation. For example, in the aftermath of a Work- shop on Middle Bronze Age Pottery held at the Swedish Institute in Athens in June, 1985, a new periodical by the name of Hydra was created "to serve as the vehicle for the exchange of information of scholars working on the Middle Bronze Age in the Aegean."'48 The publication of a stratified MH and early Mycenaean settlement sequence from the site of Nichoria in Messenia for the first time makes available ceramic, lithic, and faunal assemblages from a contin- uously occupied site in the southern Peloponnese.'49 These will soon be able to be compared with similar assemblages recovered from the sites of Ayios Ste- phanos and the Menelaion in Laconia150 where, how- ever, the sequences of MH and early Mycenaean occupation, especially the former, are not as fully documented as at Nichoria. Within the "heartland" of Helladic culture, two sites have emerged as partic- ularly large MH centers, which continue to be prom- inent in the early Mycenaean era. Unfortunately, the Bronze Age remains of Argos and Thebes lie buried under flourishing modern towns, with the result that they are accessible to archaeologists almost exclusively in the form of rescue excavations conducted in scat- tered and usually fairly small building plots. Several summary syntheses of the large number of such sal- vage operations provide a helpful overview of the extent and prosperity of these two settlements during the first half of the second millennium B.C.'55 Other 148 Hydra 1 (1985) 1.

RUTTER [AJA 97 senting some 100-150 years.165 This era has been the subject of an enormous amount of scholarly literature over the past 15 years. Rather than seeking to sum- marize this scholarship, I will instead indicate what appear to me to be some common foci of interest within it. A good deal of effort has been devoted to subdivid- ing the Shaft Grave period into shorter phases, each lasting on the order of a generation, or roughly 30 years. Studies of this kind differ appreciably one from the next depending on whether they are based on funerary assemblages or settlement deposits or both, whether they focus on discoveries at a single site or at several sites within a larger region, and whether the chronology proposed is a stepping stone to some other kind of analysis or an end in itself. For example, several intriguing studies have concentrated on estab- lishing the relative chronology of the burials in the two Shaft Grave circles at Mycenae with the aim of describing the nature of early Mycenaean social rank- ing and the process of its emergence.166 Those pub- lishing deposits of settlement pottery from such sites as Korakou, Tsoungiza, Asine, Nichoria, and Kiapha Thiti, on the other hand, have typically aimed at little more than definitions of local ceramic sequences, al- though there has also been a fair amount of interest in identifying the relative proportions of locally made and imported pottery in such deposits, as well as the sources of the imported pottery.167 Between these extremes are studies that are not restricted to either tomb finds or settlement assemblages but encompass both, either at the site or at the regional level, and again principally with the aim of defining chronolog- ical intervals in terms of ceramic types.168 Local ce- ramic sequences based on settlement rather than funerary types are, of course, highly desirable from the point of view of archaeologists conducting inten- sive surface survey.169 These increasingly refined pot- tery sequences should enable correlations of stages in the emergence of social stratification (as determined 165 For a relatively short Shaft Grave era lasting roughly a century, see Dickinson (supra n. 122) 18 fig. 1, 29-31, 50- 51; for a significantly longer Shaft Grave era, see ATMA 316-21, fig. 93. 166 I.

The reports of this kind that were composed, though not necessarily published, in the 1970s focused on the definition of temporal intervals. One result of the growing number of published sequences of settlement pottery has been an in- creasing emphasis on regional variation. With respect to the sources and quantities of imported pottery, which by itself constitutes a useful index of regional variation, various Ae- ginetan wares (e.g., matt-painted, solidly coated, and cooking pottery) have received the most attention. Other categories of imported pottery, whose centers of production have yet to be established with any precision, are largely of LH I date: Mainland Polychrome matt-painted (ATMA 217-23, 301- 303), Gray Minyan (ATMA 199-204), Light on Dark- slipped-and-Burnished (ATMA 212-13), and Fine Orange (ATMA 214-15). 168 At the site level, see Zerner (supra ns. 126 and 160) for Lerna, Dietz (supra n. 142; ATMA 37-105) and Nordquist 1987 (supra n. 142) for Asine.

Other survey projects have been able to rely upon local prehistoric sequences established by earlier ex- cavations at nearby sites (e.g., Berbati, Pylos).</page><page sequence="43">1993] PREPALATIAL BRONZE AGE OF THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL GREEK MAINLAND 787 from the analysis of funerary data) with changes in settlement patterns (as documented by surface sur- vey), both in the immediate vicinity of later palatial sites (e.g., Mycenae and Pylos, through the Nemea Valley, Berbati-Limnes, and Pylos Regional Surveys) and in areas far removed from such centers (e.g., the Skourta plain, the Oropos area, the Methana penin- sula, and the southern Argolid).170 One unfortunate development stemming from the intense recent interest in refining chronological pre- cision within the Shaft Grave era has been the rise of several different terminologies for the various sub- phases defined.Thus, for example, Kilian-Dirlmeier's phases 1-4 cover the same time span as Dietz's MH IIIA-B, LH IA-B, and LH IIA, while Graziadio em- ploys the terms Early Phase and Late Phases I and II to describe stages within the use of Grave Circle B alone. In some cases, the above authorities have com- mented in detail on how and why their own relative chronology differs from those employed by others, but due presumably to time constraints they have not always managed to provide as full a critique as desir- able of competing relative chronologies.171 For the time being, we must accept the fact that no universally accepted terminology exists, so that tables illustrating one's own point of view in comparison with those of other specialists are virtually mandatory.172 In the midst of so much evidence for disagreement, it is important to underscore one important point on which all authorities do agree: namely, that during the earliest phase of the Mycenaean era known as LH I, the amount of decorated Mycenaean pottery is very small in comparison to the quantities of matt-painted and fine unpainted (i.e., Minyan, whether Yellow, Black, or Red) pottery in use. It is for this reason that Dietz's typology of MH III and LH I shapes is so welcome, despite its strictly northeastern Peloponne- sian focus, for Furumark's original typology of My- cenaean pottery and Mountjoy's helpfully illustrated updating of it do not cover the vast majority of ce- ramic types in use during most of the Shaft Grave era.173 How the rise to dominance of the fine, lustrous- painted class of pottery that we call "Mycenaean" should be interpreted is still very much an open ques- tion, as is where the production center (or centers) of the earliest Mycenaean decorated pottery was (or were) located.174 Progress on answering these and other questions concerning the early stages of Myce- naean culture will be made as more is learned about regional variation during the Shaft Grave era.175 Pot- tery is certainly one sphere of material culture in which regional differences are already well docu- mented. Settlement architecture, on the other hand, 170 For the beginnings of investigations of this type, see Wright et al., forthcoming (supra n. 14), Davis (supra n. 14), and Wright (supra n. 147). 171 Laffineur (supra n. 166) provides a critique of Kilian- Dirlmeier (supra n. 166), as do Graziadio 1991 (supra n. 166) 414-15, 430-34, and Dietz (ATMA 264). Graziadio 407 n. 38 also supplies a brief comment on Laffineur. Dietz's critical assessment (ATMA 25-26) of Graziadio's 1988 schema does not permit a convenient yet comprehensive comparison of the rival chronologies espoused by these two scholars. 172 For such tables, see Graziadio 1988 (supra n. 166) 345 table 1 and Graziadio 1991 (supra n. 166) 433 table 4; Laffineur (supra n. 166) 234; ATMA 26 fig. 1. 173 A.

The northeastern Peloponne- sian focus of Dietz's typology may severely limit its use in other regional contexts. His classification scheme is also re- stricted to finds from tombs, with the result that, for exam- ple, Aeginetan matt-painted basins and kraters, very com- mon in Argive, Corinthian, and Attic settlement contexts of the Shaft Grave era, are not included as types (ATMA 224- 27), although Dietz describes their distribution in some detail in a separate section (303-305, fig. 91). For Messenia, two recent publications provide a welcome complement to Dietz's treatment of the Argive material: first, Lolos (supra n. 124) has provided an extremely valuable regional perspective with his publication of both settlement deposits (e.g., Malthi, Volimidia, Koukounara Katarrachaki, Peristeria, Voroulia, Pylos, and Nichoria) and tomb material (Malthi, Nichoria, Kaminia, Koukounara, Voidhokoilia, Tragana, Pylos, Vol- imidia, Routsi, Peristeria, Kakovatos, Klidhi, and Makrysia) from virtually all of this region's excavated early Mycenaean sites as far north as the Alpheios valley in Elis; second, Howell and Dickinson (supra n. 149) have recently published what appears to be a continuous MH III through LH II settlement sequence from Nichoria. 174 For the stylistic ingredients of Mycenaean decorated pottery of the LH I period, see O.T.P.K. Dickinson, "The Definition of Late Helladic I," BSA 69 (1974) 109-20; Mountjoy (supra n. 173) 9. For what appears to be a typical northeastern Peloponnesian ceramic assemblage of the LH I period, containing very little decorated Mycenaean pottery, see Davis (supra n. 167). 175 For an introduction to regionalism in Mycenaean ce- ramics of all phases, see P.A. Mountjoy, "Regional Myce- naean Pottery," BSA 85 (1990) 245-70.

In the Peloponnese, the excava- tions of tholoi at Klidhi in Elis, Psari and Routsi in Messenia, Kallithea in Achaea, Pellanes in Arcadia, and Kokla in the Argolid merit special mention; the last was found unrobbed in 1981 and thus furnished valuable evidence for funerary ritual in addition to a rich array of grave goods.'78 Large cemeteries of chamber tombs at Nauplion in the Argolid and Pa- laiokastro in Arcadia, the earliest of which date from the early Mycenaean era, have received preliminary publication, while many of the chamber tombs at Mycenae dug in the last century have at last received the full publication they deserve.179 A richly furnished cist grave of LH IIB date from Argos has also been fully published.180 North of the isthmus, preliminary reports of early Mycenaean chamber tombs at Kok- kinonyzes and Zeli in eastern Locris are welcome 176 A pair of LH I "megara" at Tsoungiza (Wright et al.

The excavation, beginning in 1979, of a cemetery of pre- viously plundered chamber tombs at Aidonia, in the south- western Corinthia not far west of modern Nemea, has not yet been the subject of a formal preliminary report, although three gold rings of LH II date from one of these tombs have been published (K.

These and other finds of the same date in precious materials, in addition to the LH II-IIIB pottery and bronzes from the tombs, have been on exhibit in the museum in Ancient Nemea since the mid-1980s. The goldwork from these tombs has allowed a group of stylisti- cally very similar Mycenaean jewelry, on exhibition in the Michael Ward Gallery in New York from April to June 1993 (R. Reif, "Rare Gold Baubles: Small, Ancient and Radiant," N.Y. Times [4 April 1993] H:39), to be identified as probably having come from the same tomb or tombs and hence to have been exported illegally from Greece (W.H.

In all likeli- hood, the Mycenaean tholos represents the merging of a mainland tradition of burial below ground sur- face in pits, cists, and small chambers set into a low tumulus, on the one hand, and on the other, a Minoan tradition of burial above ground in large circular tomb chambers with corbeled side walls, as long ago main- tained by Hood and more recently supported by Pe- lon.'83 As in the case of the Shaft Grave circles at Mycenae, some of the most recent and most stimulat- ing work on tholos tombs has taken the form of studies evaluating their social and political significance.'84 How Mycenaean tholoi were built has been the subject of a fairly heated debate, sometimes with important implications for how this form of burial architecture is likely to have been disseminated around the Ae- gean.s85 Chamber tombs, too, have been analyzed from a number of different perspectives. For exam- ple, how does their architecture vary from region to region? How can they be used to provide statistics for rises and falls in the populations of the settlements adjacent to them? And how might the design and siting of such tombs reflect Mycenaean funerary rit- ual, aesthetics, or social structure?'86 The wealth of the grave goods deposited in the shaft graves at Mycenae, in the contemporary tholoi of Messenia, and in tombs of both kinds in central Greece at sites such as Thebes and Thorikos is as astonishing today as ever, especially in view of how poorly MH graves were furnished over the preceding three centuries. This material wealth is accompanied by an abundance of pictorial art in numerous media that is no less striking, particularly because of the aniconic nature of virtually all MH art. The individual motifs, as well as the scenes and objects in and on which these appear, are in most cases derived from Minoan art.

RUTTER [AJA 97 in Minoan workshops, are questions to which answers have long been, and continue to be, elusive. The mechanisms of this transmission process are virtually certain to have been multiple rather than single, to have differed from region to region within the Pelo- ponnese and central Greece, and to have varied ac- cording to the material and function of the objects in question. The sheer range of these decorated objects in both material and functional terms is astounding, as are in some cases the quantities of a single class of object (e.g., bronze swords, amber beads) deposited with a single interment. It is probably correct to see in all of these variables-function of object, material, quantity, and nature of decoration--denominations in terms of which status came to be measured toward the end of the MH period within mainland Greek societies.187 The principal functional categories that can be dis- tinguished among the grave goods of the Shaft Grave era in the Argolid are drinking and pouring vessels, jewelry, weaponry, and containers of various shapes and sizes (boxes, small and large jars, etc.).'88 The first of these categories is traditional though by no means universal in MH graves. The remaining three, however, are all additions to the mainland Greek funerary assemblage from the MH III period onward. All are prefigured in the MH II shaft grave at Ko- lonna (see above p. 776) but not, to my knowledge, in any contemporary or somewhat earlier Minoan or Cycladic burial. Thus, perhaps not merely a tomb form but also the functional patterning of a new funerary assemblage was adopted by an emerging elite in the MH III Argolid after an Aeginetan model. Elements of this new package of grave goods-but, perhaps significantly, not the form of tomb nor the stele that marked its position'189-were adopted some- what later in regions such as Messenia and Attica by emerging local elites for essentially the same purpose, that is, to mark differences in status. Although the various regional ranking systems appear to have made use of many of the same artifact types as indices of status, the tomb forms employed to express differ- ences in rank appear to have varied significantly from one region to the next (e.g., shaft grave in the Argolid, tholos tomb in Messenia), to have changed with time within the same region (e.g., the shift from shaft grave to tholos in the Argolid during the LH IIA phase), and probably to have expressed differing levels of status even though the same in form (e.g., burial in Argive tholoi restricted to smaller groups of higher status than burial in Messenian tholoi).190 Important elements in the recognition of male rank during the Shaft Grave era, which are not attested earlier, are items of both offensive and defensive weaponry such as swords, daggers, and boar's tusk helmets. All three of these classes of object not only signified a certain degree of status if owned but could be elaborated to indicate higher rank, the first two by means of decoration with representational art and the last by increasing the number of tusks with which such helmets were embellished.'19 That is, not only may such objects have functioned more as indicators of 187 For analyses of ranking in the Shaft Grave burials at Mycenae in such terms, see above all (supra n. 166): Kilian- Dirlmeier, Laffineur 1989, and Graziadio 1991. 188 For encyclopedic publications of the metal vessels from the Shaft Graves at Mycenae and from contemporary tombs elsewhere on the Greek mainland, see H.

The manipulation of representational art in this fashion to express the rank of its owner is by no means limited to weaponry in this period. Laffi- neur has recently drawn attention to how the ico- nography of seals may have been similarly ex- ploited.192 One might add the chariot as an example of both an image and a physical object that appears to have been employed more for the rank it implied than for either its speed or its military effectiveness.193 There may be close to universal agreement that one of the chief functions of representational art during the Shaft Grave era was to enhance individual status, but there exists far less in the way of a consensus on the distinction between Mycenaean and Minoan art, especially by the beginning of the LH IIA phase.'94 One category of pictorial art that probably did not function to promote its owner's status and that is unambiguously Helladic rather than Minoan is that which appears on painted pottery, particularly on the class of LH I vessels decorated in the Mainland Polychrome matt-painted style.195 A recently found fragment of a large narrow-necked jar from Tsoun- giza of LH I date, handmade in a coarse fabric and decorated in a single color of dark brown matt paint (fig. 17), is to my knowledge unique in vase painting of the Shaft Grave period in its depiction of a human being.

Fragmentary LH I matt-painted jar decorated with human figure in belly zone, from Tsoungiza in Circle B at Mycenae.196 Like the birds and griffins that decorate Mainland Polychrome matt-painted jugs and jars, the antecedents of the stick figure on the Tsoungizan jar are probably Cycladic rather than Minoan.197 Such evidence for Cycladic influence of some kind on Helladic pictorial art is a salutary re- minder that the mainlanders were not dependent entirely on Crete for the stimuli that transformed MH into Mycenaean material culture. Other sources of external stimuli, as early as LH I and possibly from the very beginning of the Shaft Grave era, are a group of small islands located just north of eastern Sicily and another small island at the northwest end of the Bay of Naples.198 Two features 196 G.E.

Moreover, we ordinarily have no way of determining the reason an object identified as a Minoan product entered a Mycenaean depositional context.

RUTTER [AJA 97 we justified in inferring anything about Mycenaean religious behavior from the motifs or scene in ques- tion? The religious iconography on luxury objects such as gold rings or even on items made from less valuable materials such as stone seals can therefore rarely be convincingly argued to reflect Mycenaean religious ideology or ritual practice. Actual locations where cult was practiced in MH and early Mycenaean times-sanctuaries or shrines- appear to have been extremely rare. In fact, no MH cult locales whatsoever have been identified, to my knowledge.202 Only in the later sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas near Epidauros has the nature of the finds, in non-funerary contexts adjacent to an early Myce- naean settlement, suggested the existence of a con- temporary cult place.203 This site has been compared with Minoan peak sanctuaries on the basis of the Minoan character of some of the finds (seals, steatite rhyton fragment with figured decoration in relief, bronze double-axes), the locale of their discovery (just north and downslope from a hilltop settlement on Mt. Kynortion exhibiting three phases of Mycenaean oc- cupation on top of two EH phases), and their associ- ation with quantities of animal bones from strata containing much evidence for burning. The presence of numerous bronze weapons other than double-axes (e.g., swords and daggers with the pommels for both, spearheads) sets the Maleatas finds apart from those recovered at typical Minoan peak sanctuaries, but weapons are found in other Minoan cult places (e.g., the Arkalochori Cave204) and thus there is no need to see in the presence of this weaponry an aspect of Helladic rather than Minoan religious behavior. CONCLUSION One way to measure progress since the Gazetteer's publication in our understanding of the societies oc- cupying the southern and central Greek mainland during roughly the first three-quarters of the Bronze Age is to single out several major issues and assess how answers to them have recently changed.205 How and why, for example, has thinking about the transition from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age de- veloped? In this case, aside from some progress in describing settlement assemblages near the beginning of the EH period and developing a better sense of the changes in settlement patterns between the Final Neolithic (or Late Neolithic II) period and the EH I phase (see above pp. 760-61), not much else appears to have happened. The reason why this is so has to do with the lack of excavated FN and EH I settlements and the virtual non-existence of funerary remains on either side of what, in view of the terminology in use, should be a transition of major significance. At a number of locales in both the Peloponnese and central Greece, as in other areas of the Aegean, whether to the north in Thessaly (at Pefkakia and Sesklo) and Macedonia (at Sitagroi), to the south in Crete (at Knossos), or in the approximate center in the Cyclades (at Kephala on Keos and the Cave of Zas on Naxos), the production, or at least presence, of metal artifacts in Neolithic levels has been documented. There is therefore no real basis for the distinction between the end of the Neolithic and the beginning of the Early Bronze Age on the grounds that metallurgy made its initial appearance in the EH period.206 202 For the nonexistence of recognized MH cult locales, see Nordquist 1987 (supra n. 142) 111. 203 V. Lambrinoudakis, "Remains of the Mycenaean Period in the Sanctuary of Apollon Maleatas," in Higg and Mari- natos (supra n. 201) 59-65, with extensive references to earlier preliminary reports. The architecture associated with these finds consists of a terrace wall and a patch of the original floor of the terrace. Associated with these were copious animal bones and extensive evidence of burning, interpreted as the remains from repeated burnt offerings of sacrificial animals on an open-air altar located on the terrace. West of this "altar terrace" were found walls defining three rooms, one of them paved. All three are dated to the early Mycenaean period and assigned to a sacral building on the grounds that the LH I-II pottery associated with the rooms consists of the same types as that found in the area of the "altar terrace." The earliest pottery from this part of the Apollo Maleatas sanctuary is firmly assigned to the LH I period by Dietz (ATMA 287). 204 For the Arkalochori Cave, see H. Hazzidakis, "An Early Minoan Sacred Cave at Arkalochori in Crete," BSA 19 (1912) 35-47. For Minoan peak sanctuaries, see A.A.D.

My aim here has been to focus on episodes of major cultural change, which by chance are fairly evenly distributed throughout the time period being surveyed. 206 For a thorough review of the evidence, see McGeehan- Liritzis (supra n. 34); V.

On this front, there have been numerous developments (see above pp. 763-66). But the result has not been to provide a more definitive response to the questions of what happened and why. Rather, an old explanatory model (Caskey's theory of a double invasion at the transitions from EH II to III and from EH III to MH, based on his excavations at Lerna) has had to be scrapped with the realization that the transitions in question are manifested in quite different ways in the different regions that make up our study area. In this case, the question of what happened at the EH II-III transition has not really been altered but the response to it has been "pluralized" as we have come to appreciate that the process of cultural change in question was a long- lived rather than short-term one, which began earlier in the north of the study area than in the south. The stages in this cultural metamorphosis vary consider- ably from region to region, both in number and in nature.207 What caused a dramatic rise in material wealth toward the end of the MH period, initiating the Shaft Grave era (MH III-LH IIA ceramic phases)? In this period of three to four generations a social hierarchy was gradually articulated, at least in terms of the material correlates that make it visible to archaeolo- gists, by means of the goods deposited with individual burials. There is no evidence for a hierarchy marked in this way during the preceding three centuries (EH III-MH II ceramic phases). That is, the emergence of a distinct social group, or elite, which chose to employ this new wealth as a means of self-identifica- tion, appears to have been as new as the wealth itself. What, then, happened that could have led to the emergence of this elite first in the Argolid and Mes- senia, and caused it to distinguish itself with a partic- ular range of artifactual types? The answers that have been in vogue over the past 15 years identify, in the emerging elites, small Peloponnesian groups who somehow managed to gain control over the flow into the Aegean of a valuable raw material, either tin or gold. With control over this resource, the mainlanders were able to negotiate a "special relationship" with one or more Minoan palaces, giving them access to both artisans and other valuable raw materials, and resulting in the lavish and unusually diverse grave goods found in the Shaft Graves.208 As in the case of the EH II-III transition, we are now not so much in a position to answer the question as to approach it with more varied and potentially valuable information at our disposal. The emergence of Kolonna on Aegina as a potent center of production and probably as the principal agent responsible for the distribution of both its finished goods (pottery) and its raw materials (andesite)209 has introduced into the Middle Bronze Age a hitherto neglected candidate for the title of "the Aegean's first state."210 Whether or not the site of Kolonna was the home of an administrative structure to rival those of Protopalatial Crete, one must now consider the possibility that the emerging stratified societies on the Greek mainland, especially those in the Argolid, may have been aping Aeginetan rather than Minoan customs in their choices of how to bury their most prominent families. The recent recognition that major areas of the interior in some regions (e.g., the Corinthia and perhaps also Attica) appear to have been colonized at the time the Shaft Grave era began 207 Cf., e.g., the variability in ceramic assemblages attested during the EH III phase in Boeotia, Elis, and the Argolid: J.B. Rutter, "Early Helladic III Vasepainting, Ceramic Re- gionalism, and the Influence of Basketry," in Problems 73- 89. 208 For tin as the valuable raw material in question, see Dickinson (supra n. 122) 51-57. For gold, see E. Davis, "The Gold of the Shaft Graves: The Transylvanian Connection," TUAS 8 (1983) 32-38. If control over metal resources was of such importance, it is perhaps surprising that a site like Thorikos, in a district that had been a major source of lead, silver, and copper ores for centuries, did not become a greater center of power than it did. For Dickinson's critique of his own theory that the wealth of the Shaft Grave princes stemmed from their control of a metal that was in high demand, see Dickinson (supra n. 198) 274 and Dickinson 1989 (supra n. 124) 136, both with references to the critique of the same theory by Harding (supra n. 198) 280-81. 209 The andesite may well have been marketed in the form of millstones or other finished goods, such as the EH tripod mortars to which Runnels has drawn attention (1988 [supra n. 35]). 210 For a selection of recent literature on the emergence of the state in the Aegean, see P.

RUTTER [AJA 97 may also play a role in new suggestions about how the princes of Mycenae (and Messenia?) acquired their wealth. The discovery that exchanges with the central Mediterranean were fairly common and had begun by the dawn of the Mycenaean era has already had an impact on explanations of the Shaft Grave phe- nomenon.21' Finally, where, when, and why did the combination of administrative headquarters, manufacturing cen- ter, and royal residence that we call a Mycenaean palace first appear? At present, the leading contender is the earliest of several superimposed "mansions" at the Menelaion in Laconia, although Kilian has sug- gested that a partially excavated structure at Kako- vatos might be even earlier.212 In either case, the building in question cannot be dated before the be- ginning of the LH II period; indeed, it is quite pos- sible that Mycenaean palaces were not built until as late as the LH IIB phase. Thus, it continues to be the case that the palace form did not make its initial appearance on the mainland until long after the Shaft Grave era had begun and possibly not until it was actually over.213 In view of the probable date of its appearance, the Mycenaean palace is likely to have come into being as a result of the chain of LM IB disasters that overwhelmed all the Neopalatial centers of Crete except Knossos. Further progress on identi- fying and explaining the appearance of the earliest Mycenaean palaces must await the full publication of the LH II-IIIA1 "mansions" at the Menelaion, as well as of the LH IIIA1 palace built over impressive late MH and early Mycenaean structures on the summit of the citadel at Tiryns. Additional information con- cerning the date at which Mycenaean palatial admin- istrative and ceremonial complexes were instituted may also be forthcoming from the Pylos survey in the form of evidence for a significant shift in the settle- ment pattern in the environs of the palace. In the meantime, the refinement of regional ceramic chro- nologies during the potentially crucial LH IIB and LH IIIAl phases will have done much to make the eventual dating of the event much more precise than would have been possible 15 years ago.214 Not one of the preceding four questions about the causes of major changes in the cultural history of the mainland Greek Bronze Age has yet been satisfacto- rily answered. Does this signify that little or no recent progress has been made in the archaeology of this area and time period? Not at all. Impressive advances have been made in identifying regional variation215 and refining relative chronologies in all phases of the Bronze Age. One consequence of this has been that we are now willing to view the EH II-III transition less as an event and more as a process that took place over a far longer period of time than previously thought and in significantly different ways, with dif- ferent material correlates, depending on where the process is being tracked. Much the same could be said, and for the same reasons, about the MH-LH transi- tion. Thanks to the rise in intensive surface survey as a mode of fieldwork, such cultural transitions are now examined as much in terms of changes in settlement pattern as any other set of variables. This is good news indeed, for it is in terms of changing settlement pat- terns that the transitions from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age and from the prepalatial to the palatial stages of Mycenaean culture may prove to be most clearly identifiable. Once again, these last two transi- tions are likely to occur over time intervals and in sets of differential stages that vary considerably from re- 211 Dickinson 1989 (supra n. 124); Vagnetti 1992 (supra n. 198) 293-96. Long-distance trade with sites in the Tyrrhen- ian Sea to the west and by way of Troy with sites in the Black Sea to the northeast are considered by A. and S. Sherratt (supra n. 198) 370 to account for the wealth of, respectively, the early Messenian tholoi and the Shaft Graves at Mycenae. 212 For the Menelaion, see Catling, supra ns. 3 and 150. For Kilian's candidate at Kakovatos, see Kilian in L6vy (supra n. 3) 212, fig. 8; Kilian in Higg and Marinatos (supra n. 3) 33, fig. 9. 213 For the gap between the rich early Mycenaean burials in the tholoi of Messenia and the Shaft Graves of Mycenae, and the emergence of complex bureaucracies housed in the mainland's first true palaces, see Dickinson 1989 (supra n. 124) 131. Like Dickinson (see also ns. 2-3), I am not per- suaded by Kilian's reconstruction of an early Mycenaean palace at Pylos resembling a Minoan palace in its form. 214 For the relative chronology of the LH IIB and IIIA1 phases, see Dickinson (supra n. 167); Catling (supra n. 3); B. Santillo Frizell, An Early Mycenaean Settlement at Asine: The Late Helladic IIB-IIIA1 Pottery (G6teborg 1980); P.A. Mountjoy, Four Early Mycenaean Wells from the South Slope of the Acropolis at Athens (Miscellanea Graeca 4, Gent 1981); Lewis (supra n. 44); P.A.

Rutter, "Late Hel- ladic IIB Pottery Deposits from Tsoungiza," Hesperia (forth- coming). 215 Certain regions, however, especially in the west (Aetolia, Akarnania, and the Ionian islands), remain seriously under- explored, as should be apparent from the fact that they have scarcely been mentioned in this review.</page><page sequence="53">1993] PREPALATIAL BRONZE AGE OF THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL GREEK MAINLAND 797 gion to region. From what we already know of such major transitions (e.g., the EH II-III and MH-LH examples just discussed), they begin in different re- gions and take place at different rates. One kind of interesting investigation that still lies some years in the future will be the comparative analysis of these episodes of relatively rapid cultural change. But such analyses will only be possible when our understanding of spatial and temporal variation within each of these episodes has improved considerably. For the time being, there is plenty of basic fieldwork and pri- mary analysis of artifactual data still crying out to be done.
