Baker Environmental Activities Staff, General Motors Corp. VEHICLE RESTRAINT SYSTEMS have generally been evalu- ated solely with anthropomorphic dummies and defined meas- ures of injury criteria. With a restraint as different as the air cushion. General Motors (GM) has taken an additional step in an attempt to understand the interface between the occupant and restraint system. A program was established to test the driver air cushion system in direct frontal impacts on an impact sled using human volunteers. This program, conducted by Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas, under contract to General Motors Corporation, was similar to tests on the passenger side air cushion which were done at Hollo- man Air Force Base for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In both programs, the tests were conducted under the most safe and controlled conditions possible, and typify only what the air cushions might accomplish in direct, head-on impacts. The primary concern for both GM and Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) was to safeguard the rights and welfare of the human volunteers, The test program was designed to accomplish this. This paper describes the test procedures and presents obser- vations on the human kinematic and physical response to the impacts. Data is provided on the dummy (Hybrid II 50th percentile and 95th percentile) and human tests. APPROACH The general approach to this test program involved the step- ped-severity concept which was successfully utilized at Holloman Air Force Base on the passenger system tests. The human volunteers were exposed to increasingly severe im- pact environments beginning at a level approximately equiva- lent to a 13 mph (21 kph) barrier crash and culminated as planned at a 30 mph (48 kph) barrier crash condition. Tests were conducted at eight different impact severity levels, with each level used as a step toward the final 30 mph barrier equivalent. Each level contained four dummy tests (three 50th percentile and one 95th percentile) and five human tests. The 50th percentile dummy was a Hybrid II and the 95th percentile was a modified Sierra 292-895. The decision to proceed from one severity level to the next was based on the volunteer's comments and information obtained from the transducers and high-speed motion pictures. A physician was present to perform a short pre-test physical exam and a ABSTRACT Dynamic tests of the General Motors driver air cushion sys- tem using human volunteers were conducted at Southwest Research Institute. Forty human tests were conducted at eight different impact severities. Thirty-two anthropomor- phic dummy tests were made under similar conditions. The test work proceeded as planned through impacts equivalent to a 30 mph (48 kph) barrier crash of a full size vehicle. No significant injuries were experienced by the volunteers. The extent of trauma was generally limited to minor abrasions, ecchymosis, and erythema. In comparable tests, the anthro- pomorphic dummies' response to impact was more exag- gerated than the humans'. 2222</page><page sequence="2">post -test exam. As a part of these exams, he reviewed the recorded physiological data. The tests were conducted by a team comprised of GM and SwRI personnel. GM had basic responsibility for the test buck and hardware while SwRI was responsible for the humans and impact sled facility. All test protocol, from schedules to checklists, revolved around one basic creed - human volunteer safety is of the highest priority. Care was taken in the planning and design of the experiments. Empha- sis was placed on establishing test procedures, defining assign- ments, preparing and following checklists and reviewing emergency procedures. Impact simulation at SwRI was based on an average velocity profile and corresponding acceleration waveshape which was supplied by GM. These average traces were compiled from full size vehicle barrier tests conducted by GM. SwRI was asked to match these traces as closely as possible with emphasis placed on matching the velocity profile. The severity of the test from the volunteer's standpoint was considered more closely related to the vehicle velocity than the instantaneous vehicle acceleration. Extensive system testing preceded the first exposure of humans to an air cushion. Validation of the system (test buck, hardware and ACRS) was conducted at the GM Safety Research and Development Laboratory. Initial SwRI tests included sled correlation (dummy), animal (baboon) and harness indoctrination (human). GENERAL MOTORS DRIVER ACRS DESCRIPTION The restraint system evaluated in the test program was similar to production equipment installed in the 1000 Car GM Field Trial Program. The main elements of the driver air cushion system are an energy absorbing steering column, a steering wheel which houses a chemical gas generator and air cushion, and a knee restraint to absorb lower torso energy (Fig. 1). The steering column's energy absorption is accomplished by steel balls extruding a track between two telescoping jackets during column compression. The column has a duel stage energy absorber to obtain an improved energy absorption rate for the air cushion system. Initial low compression load is created by pre tracking the balls through the first inch of travel to reduce the initial inertia spike on the driver. The col- umns differed slightly from regular production air cushion equipment because they were installed without a shift lever, ignition lock, hazard warning switch, turn signal lever and were locked to prevent rotation. The steering wheel hub supports the air cushion module and the inflated cushion is supported by the spokes and wheel rim. The air cushion module is composed of a chemical gas generator, a neoprene coated nylon air cushion, an inner container and an outer vinyl cover. The knee restraint, mounted below the instrument panel, consists of a sheet metal retainer, flexible foam and vinyl skin. Its purpose is two-fold, to control the driver kinematics during a frontal impact by restraining the lower torso and directing the upper torso and head into the steering wheel air cushion, and to mitigate or prevent injury to the legs. A complete description of the system's overall operation may be found in SAW Paper No. 730605, "General Motors Driver Air Cushion Restraint System," by T. N. Louckes et al. TEST ENVIRONMENT The GM designed body buck (Fig. 2) resembled the buck used at Holloman and simulated the interior dimensions of a 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88. An Oldsmobile production cloth bench seat was employed along with a special head restraint which covered the entire width of the buck. The bench seat Fig. 1 - Main elements of GM driver air cushion system 2223</page><page sequence="3">2224 G. R. SMITH, ET AL. Fig. 2 - Primary restraint-driver air cushion system Fig. 3 - Secondary restraint -aircraft harness and lap belt could be adjusted fore and aft to accommodate different size volunteers. The simulated windshield was fabricated from styrofoam and shaped to the contours of the conventional windshield so the air cushion would interact against it in the same manner as it would in an automobile. The instrument panel above the knee restraint pad was a sheet metal mock-up covered by foam. A piece of Ensolite was inserted between the top of the knee restraint and the bottom of the instrument panel to prevent any volunteer hand or arm involvement with the bracketry. In addition to the air cushion, which was the primary re- straint, two backup restraint systems were provided as addi- tional safety precautions. The air cushion system activated as intended in every test and the two backup systems were never needed. However, they did provide additional confidence for the volunteers in the test program. The secondary restraint was a belt harness (Fig. 3) that effec- tively restrained in the shoulders, chest, lap, and legs. It was attached to a single bolt and separation nut assembly mounted behind the seat on the body buck. The system was controlled by proper inflation of the air cushion. As the cushion blossomed, it separated the two flaps</page><page sequence="4">HUMAN AND DUMMY TESTS OF GM AIR CUSHION SYSTEM 2225 on the inner cover of the module. Two interrupt wires were attached across these flaps. As the flaps separated, the inter- rupt wires were broken which caused an electric circuit to feed current to the separation nut and released the belt harness. This allowed the volunteer to interact freely with the air cushion restraint system. If the wires were not broken because the air cushion did not fire upon signal, the interrupt wires prevented any current flow to the release system and the belt harness then functioned as the primary restraint. The belt harness system was also used in low speed volunteer indoctrination tests. Each of the volunteers was subjected to a simulated crash roughly equivalent to a 10 mph (16 kph) barrier crash while restrained by the belt harness system (no air cushion deployed). The purpose of this phase of tests was to acquaint the volunteers with the test procedures and instrumentation as well as building confidence in the secon- dary restraint. Some volunteers expressed that they received slight discomfort from the belts due to their tightness and some soreness to the neck caused from flexion during impact. The tertiary restraint system involved the interior of the body buck (Fig. 4). The windshield and instrument panel were specially designed to distribute energy in the event of failure of both the air cushion and belt restraints. The steering col- umn's compression provides for energy absorption. Additional protection was offered, primarily against ejection by a clear plastic panel added across the left-hand body buck opening, and a special looping of the harness system around steel beams on the buck, which limits excessive excursion. Rebound pro- tection was provided by the slab foam head restraint, which extends across the entire width of the buck. The SwRI impact simulator is an "impact-with-rebound" type and is basically an MTS Model 858.05. The sled is ac- celerated up to the required speed by the use of natural-rubber bungee cords. The sled impacts on SwRI designed rebound deceleration programmer. The impact of the sled forces the programmer's piston back until the sled is brought to zero velocity. The piston then returns its stroke accelerating the sled in the opposite (rebound) direction. After the sled re- bounds from the programmer, it is slowed by stretching the bungee cords and is brought to a complete stop by the re- bound brakes. A 30 mph (48 kph) barrier crash pulse of a full size vehicle was simulated on the SwRI impact sled. The lower severity levels were scaled from this pulse. INSTRUMENTATION The data collected during the course of this experiment in- cluded both mechanical and physiological parameters. Dur- ing the test program, the data served two purposes, to assure continuous subject safety and to help evaluate the effective- ness of the driver ACRS. Head and thorax accelerations were measured on both the volunteers and anthropomorphic dummies. The mounting techniques for the external accelerometers were the same for both humans and dummies. The triaxial head accelerometer was mounted on the left side of an adjustable plastic head- band which was removed from the inside of a welder's helmet. The adjustment knob was removed from the back side of the headband and replaced by a strip of Velcro to provide in- finite adjustment for head size. The accelerometer was lo- cated on the skull over the left temperoparietal region 1.5-2.0 inches (3.8-5.0 centimeters) above the Frankfort Plane and superior to the tragus. An Ensolite cup was placed over the accelerometer for the subject's protection. The triaxial thorax accelerometer was mounted on a Fig. 4 - Tertiary restraint-energy absorbing interior</page><page sequence="5">2226 G. R. SMITH, ET AL. rubber-backed aluminum plate and covered by a 4 X 8 X 1 inch piece of Ensolite. The rubber backing was placed toward the subject and was centered over the left erector spinal muscle of the back at the level of T6 vertebra. It was posi- tioned off the mid sagittal plane to prevent injury to any pro- truding spinous process. A strip of 2-in wide Velcro was fastened tightly around the subject's thorax as he expelled air, rising the accelerometer to him. The chest strap portion of the belt harness was then tightened around the Velcro strap. Fig. 5 shows a volunteer in the body buck with the instrumentation attached. The output from the standard internal head, chest, and femur transducers in the anthropomorphic dummies were also recorded. The physiological data monitored included electrocardiogram, pulse rate, respirations, and blood pressure. VOLUNTEER PREPARATIONS Healthy young males were recruited as test subjects by SwRI. All were from the San Antonio area and had diversified back- grounds, from students to firemen. All subjects were required to take and pass a rigorous physical examination. The exam was administered at SwRI's medical facility with the individ- ual being sent to a radiology laboratory for X-ray studies. The physical investigation included an examination of the heart, lungs, ears, nose and throat, eyes, hearing, reflexes, muscle and joint motion, pulse rate and blood pressure. The individ- ual was also subjected to a "double masters" test to determine ECG and cardiac status during and immediately post exercise. Baseline enzyme studies including creative Phosphokinase (CPK), lactic dehydroginase (LDH) and serum glutamic transaminase (SGOT) were performed on the volunteers. All individuals accepted in the test program were required to have an X-ray evaluation of the entire spine and all major bones and joints by a series of 22 views to rule out significant arthritis with spurs or lipping, marked cortical thinning, joint abnormalities with calcification or foreign bodies, ununited or poorly united fractures. As a result of the intensive exami- nations, nine of the candidates who applied were disqualified for various reasons. In addition, certain liberal anthropometric size ranges were adhered to. The subjects selected were able to place their feet flat on the toe pan while harnessed in the number two seat position (one notch rear of full forward), their seated height measurement fell in the range of 34.2-37.5 inches (87-95 centimeters) and their weights did not exceed 220 pounds (100 kilograms). These requirements were established because they represent the range of the 50th and 95th percentile dummies' sizes which were utilized in the tests conducted for this program at the GM Safety Research and Development Laboratory. A complete set of anthropometric dimensions on each vol- unteer was also completed and is given in Table 1 . The dimen- sions included weight, stature, sitting height, acromion-radiale length, forearm grip distance, buttock -knee length, and sitting knee height. Thirty-two individuals qualified for the tests. Each of these underwent an indoctrination test with the harness restraint system (no air cushion) and a full complement of instrumen- tation. Twenty-six individuals participated in the air cushion tests. They ranged in age from 19 to 30 years. Their statures ranged from 67 to 74 inches (171 to 188 cm) and their weights from 138 to 208 pounds (62 to 94 kg). Immediately before the scheduled test, a short physical exam was performed on the volunteer by the physician in attendance. The subject was then instrumented for ECG (Ag/Ag CI electrodes) and blood pressure (sphygmomanom- eter cuff). Clothing consisted of tight fitting cotton long sleeve "ski pajama" tops and bottoms. A cotton "thermal" undershirt was worn beneath the pajama top. Rubber soled, low top gym shoes were worn in every test. Pliable plastic goggles, earplugs, mouthpiece, and a rubber bathing cap were worn by the volunteers.

All jewelry was removed for the test. Cold cream was applied to the volunteer's nose, chin, thumb and wrist area to minimize possible abrasions from the deploying air cushion. In all tests the volunteer was placed inside the body buck in a forward facing position and centered laterally behind the steering wheel. The seat was adjusted to allow the volun- teer to place his feet firmly on the toe pan. His hands were placed in the 9 and 3 o'clock positions on the steering wheel with the thumbs locked around the rim. His head was upright in a normal driving position. The belt harness was tightened to the point where it became painful to the volunteer. As described previously, the belt harness always released at the start of an air cushion deployment because the cushion de- ployed properly. Each volunteer was instructed to brace his whole body for an impact and to try and keep his hands on the steering wheel throughout the test. Following the impact the volunteer was asked to relax and remain seated until the investigators had discussed the ride with him. The physician assessed and recorded the trauma, if any existed. The volunteer was then removed from the body buck and asked to fill out several subjective reports. Many measures were taken to insure a safe ride for the vol- unteers and no significant trauma was experienced in any of the tests. However, as an added precaution, the physician provided certain emergency and resuscitative measures and devices for immediate employment in the impact laboratory. These included a cardiac defibrillator, tracheotomy set, tourniquet, splints, suture set, I.V. fluids, drugs for I.V. use and morphine. The SwRI physician involved in the test program is board certified in surgery with a specialty in the diagnosis, treatment and surgery of trauma. If a subject had been injured severely to require movement to a hospital for more definitive treatment than could be administered at SwRI, arrangements for rapid transport to a nearby hospital, as well as emergency care, had been made. Fortunately, none of the backup precautions were used. DYNAMIC TESTS The air cushion deployed as intended in all of the tests. The single point release system of the secondary restraint harness system also operated as intended during the course of the ex- periment and the dummies and humans were free to interact with the driver air cushion restraint system. The deploying cushion always began to blossom before the subject began to translate forward. During the deployment process, as the cushion mushroomed, it wiped across the face and forearms on the majority of subjects irregardless of test severity. The knees made contact with the knee restraint pad before the upper torso and head impacted the inflated air cushion. The toe pan and knee restraint loads decreased when the bag pressure began to increase from upper torso impact. After initial head contact, there was little additional rota- tion of the head into or over the cushion, minimizing the amount of neck flexion. If the volunteers' hand came off the wheel, it generally traveled forward striking the simulated instrument panel with the back of the wrist. The knee restraint effectively controlled the human kine- matics by absorbing some lower torso impact energy through deformation and by directing the upper torso and head into the steering wheel air cushion. Additional energy was absorbed through the lower legs into the toe pan. The steering column absorbed part of the upper torso ener- gy. At the higher velocities, this was accomplished in two stages. The first stage occurred when the column compressed due to the force exerted through the arms of the subject. The second stage of collapse occurred when the subject's upper torso and head loaded the steering column through the air cushion. The air cushion was effective in distributing the forces on the upper torso and head. There was, however, one case (Test 636 at the 27.5 mph level) in which the subject's upper abdomen contacted the steering wheel lower rim with sufficient force to permanently deform it 0.3 in. There was no apparent internal trauma to the subject. The volunteers traversed essentially in the same longitudinal plane of the vehicle on rebounding from the air cushion re- straint system as they did during impact. The head rebound velocities of the volunteers was considerably less than the dummies tested at SwRI. Only minor trauma was experienced by the volunteers during the test series. It would fit severity codes of 0 (no injury) and 1 (minor) of the abbreviated injury scale of the American Medical Association* , where scale limits range from 0 (no injury) to 6 (fatal). The trauma in these tests was limited to erythema, abrasions, and ecchymosis with ex- ception to three minor lacerations which were due to the construction method of the safety goggles used. A full listing of trauma, as compiled by the SwRI physician, may be found in Table 2. The areas where trauma was most frequently observed were the arms, face (mouth, nose, and chin), and the chest. Ob- served trauma to the legs occurred in only four tests. This minimal amount of trauma is particularly notable because no protective gear was worn on the legs, only cotton leotards. The majority of all trauma was apparently deployment in- duced. Patterns of trauma did not change over the range of impact severity levels. Superficial trauma was essentially the same at the 30 mph (48 kph) level as it was at 13 mph (21 kph). A listing of the symptoms recorded on the physical symptom survey sheet by each of the volunteers may be found in Table 3. No subjects recorded experiencing severe pain and only in two tests was moderate pain recorded. According to the SwRI physician, no pathologically sig- nificant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities could be * Developed by the American Medical Association Com- mittee on Medical Aspects of Automotive Safety, in cooper- ation with physicians representing medical specialties most involved in the diagnosis, care and treatment of crash injuries, and General Motors Corporation.</page><page sequence="9">2230 G.

He felt the most severe adverse findings encountered in the test program were two volunteers (Tests 577 and 658) who demonstrated hypoglycemic symptoms which were sec- ondary to the impact. Neither volunteer had eaten for approx- imately 1 8 h pretest due to misunderstanding of instructions in regard to food intake. Both, however, responded to inges- tion of a candy bar and soda pop without any sequellae. Almost all of the volunteers immediately agreed to addition- al tests at higher severity levels. Four of the five individuals in the 34 mph group stated they would proceed to higher level impacts. In describing the test experience, many volunteers expressed that they felt a "stinging" sensation on their face around the mouth. This was apparently caused by the wiping of bag across the face as it deployed. This same feeling was also felt on the hands and forearms. The volunteers could also feel the impact to the knee restraint, however, most did not re- cord experiencing any discomfort. There were two individu- als who recorded having moderate pain in their lower leg which quickly subsided (at 20 and 22 mph barrier equivalent, 32 and 35 kph). DUMMY AND HUMAN DATA Comparison of the dynamic response of dummies and hu- mans was not the main objective of this program. However, since the dummies and humans were run under identical conditions at SwRI, the photographic and transducer data obtained lends itself to some comparison. A general over- view of this test series reveals that the anthropomorphic dummies' dynamic response was conservative compared to the human response. Evidence of these points may be seen in Table 4, Driver Air Cushion Physical Test Data- Dummies and Humans. This chart is a conglomerate of data gathered from the trans- ducers. The Subject information was obtained from the physician. The 50D and 95D designate 50th percentile and 95th percentile dummies, respectively. The sled parameters are numbers calculated from Visicorder traces. Head, chest, and upper leg acceleration, force, and injury number data was tabulated from the information recorded on magnetic tape. Some variation exists in the test results produced by the different accelerometers. Obviously, with the humans the transducers were not rigidly attached to the different body segments. A great effort was made in designing the mounts to reduce the transient differences in the relative motion between the body segment and trans- ducer. The variation in the injury numbers for a single dummy test was due to the differences between the accelerations recorded on the internal and external transducers.

R. SMITH, ET AL. numbers was also due to changes in the true accelerations. Figs. 6 and 7 depict the mean injury numbers (head injury criteria and thorax severity index) obtained from the dummy internal and external, and human accelerometers. The mean numbers for dummies generally came from three 50th and one 95th percentile tests. The human sizes varied between these two limits. The figures show that at all but one severity level, the mean HIC and mean thorax SI for humans was less than that recorded by the dummies. This difference could in part be attributed to the difference in response of human and dummy skin surfaces. It is also due to the difference in dummy and human kinematics. A review of the high-speed movie film reveals that the dummy's response is usually more exaggerated than a human's. Again, muscle tone plays a key role in this difference. In addition to the variance in injury numbers, dummy inter- action with the air cushion system differed from humans. Steering wheel lower rim deformation was common in dum- my tests and appeared only once in the human tests (Test 636). The amount of column compression differed greatly from dummies to humans. Dummies compressed the column more, sometimes exceeding six inches, while the humans rarely ex- ceeded four inches. At the higher sled severities, the humans often compressed the column in two stages while in the dummy tests, once the column compression began, it continued without a pause. The difference can be accounted for in the strength of the humans' arms. Because the volunteers were in a braced posi- tion, their arms were fairly rigid and could transmit a force to the steering system. Even though this force was not axial down the column, the resultant was sufficient to begin the compression. The dummies, on the other hand, did not have any muscle tone in their arms (beyond the 1 g joint setting) and column compression did not begin until their upper torso impacted the inflated air cushion. The second stage of compression in the human tests occurred when their upper torsos contacted the inflated air cushion. The time of peak impact pressures in the inflated air cushion was later in hu- mans than the dummies (at 30 mph, peak impact pressure occurred between 75 and 100 ms after onset of sled decelera- tion in dummy tests and between 100 and 125 ms with humans). The humans were able to "hold themselves off' the air cushion longer. This was the reason humans did not experience severe impacts with the steering wheel lower rim. Along the same line, the dummies usually made contact with the inflated air cushion (or steering wheel) about the time they contacted the knee restraint, while the human 1000 r i r 400 - □ o n □ DUMMIES (INTERNAL) 0 O DUMMIES (EXTERNAL) 300 - □ © x HUMANS Thorax accelerations measured posteriorly MEAN THORAX © © SI □ x □ 200 - U x x © X X x 100 - □ © x Q ■ t.«i» I I 15.0 20.0 22.5 25.0 27.5 30.0 32.5 34.0 SLED VELOCITY- MPH Fig. 7 - Mean Thorax SI vs Impact Severity (sled velocity in a full size vehicle 30 mph barrier crash simulation is approximately 34 mph (48 kph)- dummies and humans</page><page sequence="18">HUMAN AND DUMMY TESTS OF GM AIR CUSHION SYSTEM 2239 o CO - Lu CSJ K I 1 8 § ür s ° ür Q- Uj Q ^ b I 1 5^9 Ü1 O £ £ § a- § O $ § p ^ &lt;* % 5 ^ í Š U.

R. SMITH, ET AL. knees hit before their upper torso. Again, arm and leg muscle tone was a key factor. A time comparison of events during four 30 mph (48 kph) barrier simulations is presented in Fig. 8. This graphically portrays the difference in the sequence in which the human and dummy respond to impact. In two of these tests, a 50th percentile Hybrid II dummy was used and in the other two, different volunteers. Certain anthropometrics of the dummy and volunteers are charted in Table 5 for comparison pur- poses. Volunteer Number 35 in Test 690 was very close in size and weight to the Hybrid II dummy. The volun- teer for Test 689 (Number 3 1) was close in size but greater in weight. The time comparison of events displays the fundamental differences between a dummy and human volunteer with muscle tone. The events graphed include column compression, knee contact, cushion loading, and toe pan loadings. For each event, time is the only variable. Column compression involves the periods of time during which the column compresses. Knee contact is the time from which initial knee contact is made until the loads applied to the knee restraint peaked. These forces were measured by uniaxial load cells mounted to the knee restraint attachment points. The cushion loading bar represents the time of the onset of cushion pressure increase due to loading from the subject's upper torso and head until peak pressure. The pressure was measured by a transducer attached to the back of the air cushion module. The toe pan loading bar depicts the time span of the onset of toe pan loads until the peak before which the loading decreases. Load cells were mounted beneath the toe pan plate to measure the forces. The sequence of these four events in the two dummy and two human tests is the same with the exception of column compression. In both dummies and humans the toe pan loads increased before the knees contacted the knee restraint. After knee contact, air cushion pressure began to increase. This, however, is where the similarity ends. The humans rode down the impacts longer with their legs than the dum- mies did. In the human tests, significant toe pan loading be- gan about 10 milliseconds after the sled deceleration began (All times quoted are in reference to the start of sled decel- eration, time zero). The dummies did not impart significant loads until about 30 ms. The humans continued applying loads for at least 70 ms before they began to drop off, while in the dummies, this time span was about 45 ms. In these four tests, the time of knee contact with the knee res- traint was about the same. The time at which air cushion pressure began to increase from upper torso loading was later in humans than the dummies. The humans alsd loaded the cushion for a longer period of time. The most noticeable difference occurs in the column com- pression. In the human tests the first stage of compression occurs before contact was made with the knee restraint. A second stage of compression occurs after the knee restraint loads have peaked. In the dummy tests, on the other hand, total column compression occurred during one period of time and it was after contact was made with the knee restraint. The volunteers completed the total event in a longer period of time as marked by the end of significant head accelera- Table 5 - Anthropomorphic Comparison of Hybrid II and Volunteers 31 and 35 Subject Height Weight Sitting Height Buttock Knee in.

They were able to dissipate kinetic energy over a longer time span thus reducing the overall severity. A review of the data obtained in this test program, includ- ing calculated injury criteria, motion pictures, and restraint system hardware indicates that the anthropomorphic dum- mies' response to the impact established them as a conserva- tive measure of the human volunteers. Injury numbers for the dummies were generally greater than those of the humans. Dummy femur loads approached and sometimes exceeded biomechanical estimates of human tolerance yet in corresponding human tests the volunteers did not even experience mild pain. The time duration of events was longer for the humans than the dummies. Steering wheel rim deformation was evident in many dummy tests while it only occurred in one volunteer test. Subjective response by the volunteers indicated that at times, the trauma experience enced was so minimal they did not know it existed. SUMMARY The dynamic impact tests at Southwest Research Institute for the first time exposed human volunteers to production- like driver air cushion system deployments at impact levels equivalent to a 30 mph barrier crash (48 kph). No significant injury was produced. At no time was it necessary for the secondary restraint systems to be utilized and the entire pro- gram schedule was carried out as planned. It must be noted, however, that all tests were conducted under the most safe and controlled conditions possible, and typify only what the air cushions might accomplish in direct, head-on impacts up to 30 mph (48 kph). In comparing the test results, the anthropomorphic dum- mies' response to impact was conservative compared to the human volunteers.</page></plain_text>
