Each imported into psychology abstractions like attraction and repulsion; force and resistance; energy and waste; structure, function, and field. And although each system has attempted to do intellectual justice to what is popularly called "the human equation," the overweening goal has been a scientific determinism which would make human acts predictable like the motions of stars. Today we can ask whether any such kind of determinism has much more to give to psychology. The question can be put another way. Traditionally, astronomy and physics have been the mainstay of science in European thought. Their certainties and predictabilities were impressive enough to oust religion as man's chief oracle and to establish the ideal for the rising behavioral sciences. With Ricardo and Marx, Darwin and Spencer, Wundt and Freud, the study of man made remarkable progress by treading the newtonian path. But today, even though this progress has continued into our present century, it must be granted that the harvest of these new human sciences has been extremely disappointing. Having, with Comte and La Place, raised the banner of universal lawfulness, the social and psychological sciences have fallen so short of their own goals that many out- standing thinkers have turned to consoling romantic and classical regressions. There is still no convincing answer to the question of whether or not the very ideal of "a science of man" is either attainable or sufficiently approachable to warrant the intellectual investment our society has made in it. Perhaps the question is unanswerable in its present form, for it assumes that in studying the ways of man we are simply studying the ways of "objects" - like stars, volcanoes, and fish. But this assumption can now be challenged, paradoxi- cally enough, by the very behavioral sciences which have been built upon it. To call something an "object" in our usual scientific discourse generally implies two * Assistant professor of language arts, San Francisco State College.

XV, NO. 3 things: first, that it is "independent" of the person who observes it; and sec- ondly, that its composition and motion express 'laws" which are both prior to and wider than the object itself. The first implication has been at least molested by the epistemology of modern physics and has been sharply denied in the new "sociology of knowledge" and by a whole range of studies in "transactional psychology," "cultural relativity," etc. And the second implication is also coming under a spreading shadow of doubt. In the recent words of A. H. Maslow, "Psychology should study the human being not just as passive clay, helpless and acted upon by outside forces, and determined by them alone. It should also study the ways in which he is (or should be) an active, autonomous self-governing mover, chooser and center of his own life." 1 If human "autonomy" is in some sense a significant concept, it means that humans are not explainable entirely in terms of non-human events. From stars these or atoms considerations or even cells it is as possible its model to suggest for the that study psychology of man, that stop it taking stop stars or atoms or even cells as its model for the study of man, that it stop regarding people as other things out there whose actions are simply noted, corre- lated, and predicted. To replace this classical perspective special search must be made for systems peculiar only to human individuals and groups and which are subject to understanding only in their own terms. Words like "autonomy" and "free will" have been too often used to denote purely episodic behavior - random and unpredictable acts - like the swerve of the Lucretian atoms or the erratic characters of Knut Hamsun. Such uses are entirely negative; they merely leave human behavior unexplainable, which is, of course, what many people desire. What is required instead is to make human behavior explainable in a different way. To meet this need we must find a pattern in human behavior which cannot be reduced to "objective" non-human phenomena and which is demonstrably unique to humans. The most obvious place to find this pattern is in the realm of language. In language we find systems which move by their own laws and which, though doubtless interacting with the laws of the physical universe, often operate in apparent independence of them. The way in which one sentence commonly calls for another sentence, producing all the laryngeal and gestural movements accom- panying its utterance, is a simple example of such a distinctively human sequence of events. In language we also find that one aspect of human behavior which has long been recognized as at least partly outside the pale of direct external deter- minants : this is the area of our rigorous deductive systems and our mathematical and logical games. No one would venture to solve a chess problem by psycho- analyzing chess players or to dispute the Pythagorean theorem by questioning the existence of perfect right-angle triangles. Yet less disciplined examples of human "reason" - the discourse of politics, religion, philosophy - have been constantly 1 A. H. Maslow, "Towards a Humanistic Psychology," ETC., XIV (Autumn, 1956), 21. 182</page><page sequence="3">SPRING 1958 TOWARD A PSYCHO-LOGICS OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR described as mere "rationalizations," as pure symptoms of dominant interests, feelings, fears, etc. The outcome, the final argument, of these vaguer systems of thought has coincided with the palpable "selfish" concerns of their authors so often as to elicit widespread cynicism, not only about the integrity of these par- ticular intellectual undertakings, but about the worth and validity of any kind of rational discourse. This cynicism, doubtless well-founded in part, has given the "rationalization theory" considerable potency in the modern evaluation of almost all philosophies, theologies, and ideologies. Thousands of western intel- lectuals have thus been easily enticed to ignore or explain away the obvious logical autonomies of mathematics or chess or bridge, while yielding to diagnostic or dialectical persuasions that "reason," as Hume said, is only "the slave of the passions." Thus instead of remaining as the ideal of the human intellect, as they were with the platonists and cartesians, the historic displays of polemical ele- gance, and even the famous rigorous deductive systems, have been commonly dismissed as mere "fronts" or "disguises" of animal-like motives, while the actual dynamics of both practical and theoretical behavior have been sought in blind panoramic laws of matter, cells, and history. Ironically enough, the rationalists themselves unwittingly aided this whole- sale exile of their doctrines from modern life. The classic proponents of "mind" and "reason" - Plato and Aristotle, Augustine and Aquinas, Descartes and Kant - all assumed some basic dualism of form and matter, mind and body, spirit and flesh, or reason and passion. In terms of such dualisms, cognition could only achieve supremacy through its distance from carnal, sensory, and emotional ex- perience. Modern naturalism, having recognized this distance to be illusory, con- cluded that man's cognitive supremacy is illusory too. Both the rationalists and the naturalists fought their battle on the common premise that any intimacy between mind and body puts body in command. It is this assumption, shared by both camps, which today we can question. Modern naturalism, with its holistic and psychosomatic hypotheses and their supporting evidence, indeed discredited the mind-body dichotomy. But instead of saying that the mind is irrational be- cause it belongs with the body, why can we not say that the body is rational be- cause it belongs with the mind? To definition justify of this "rationality." revolutionary Because assertion we we find must, in certain of course, formal achieve language a wider definition of "rationality." Because we find in certain formal language sys- tems the clearest examples of what we want to mean by "reason," we tend to confine the word "reason" to these examples and fail to ask whether other examples of human behavior - vulgar speech, poetry, politics, pantomime, art, schizophrenia, even physical exercise - might not, at least in part, fit the abstrac- tion of "rationality." To be sure, many things even the most intelligent people do, judged by the narrow definition, have been clearly "irrational" and have in fact been often made more comprehensible by pointing to crass "mechanical" 183</page><page sequence="4">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS vol. XV, NO. 3 laws. But now we can wonder whether this apparent "irrationality" of so much behavior is not due to our own limited, one-sided, even ethnocentric, criterion of "rationality"; whether we do not consider any system of reason which is foreign to us, which falls outside of our narrow definition, as "irrational," much as provincial Americans refer to the speech of Portuguese or Chinese as "gibberish." Does so much activity of the body-mind simply have no logic or language, or does it simply have a logic and language we have not bothered to learn or even to suspect? Modern developments in the psychology and sociology of interpersonal (and intrapersonal) communication suggest strongly that the second alternative is the case.2 A powerful argument can be made today that human behavior is com- municatively motivated and symbolically oriented, even in its most evidently "irrational" and "anti-social" manifestations. This writer has previously discussed some of the bases and far-reaching im- plications of this argument,3 yielding the proposal that human behavior, in its uniquely human aspects, is symbolic and "message-sending" and that the early "syntactical" patterns, both verbal and nonverbal, which we acquire as children become the nucleus of our personality in both its conscious and unconscious ex- pressions. The fundamental, life-long "message" which each person sends, if translated into words, takes the form "I am such-and-such a kind of person." The exact content of this "message," along with the "code" in which it is sent, may vary enormously depending on the person who sends it and on the audience who receives it. The fact that the message is rarely conscious, i.e. verbalizable by the individual who sends it, makes it deceptive and difficult to decipher ; but the statistical results of a person's life, judged by the consistent reactions he provokes from others, often makes the general nature of the message appallingly clear. The task facing psychology, according to this proposal, is not primarily to isolate the traditional variables and to discover, through successive refinements, more causal laws, but rather to master a whole set of behavioral foreign languages. To learn the "language" of a great mass of nonverbal and initially unintelligible behavior is doubtless as formidable a goal as finding a consistent "objective" 2 Contributing in many different, and sometimes contradicting, ways to this conclusion have been the "role-taking" theories of George H. Mead, the recent studies of the ''action theorists" (Talcott Parsons, Edward Shills, Robert Bales, etc.), the "phyloanalysis" of the late Trigant Burrow, the "kinesics" of R. J. Birdwhistell, the "physiognomic" psychology of Heinz Werner, the "field psychology" of the Lewinians, "psycho-drama" and "sociom- etry" of J. L. Moreno, the developments in "cybernetics" and "information theory" of Norbert Wiener, Claude Shannon, etc., the studies of "nonverbal communication" of Jürgen Ruesch and Gregory Bateson, the concept of the "self-fulfilling prophecy" of Robert Merton, and the "interpersonal psychology" of the late Harry Stack Sullivan with its current experi- mental formulation by the Kaiser Foundation psychologists headed by Timothy Leary. 3 Richard Dettering, "The Learning of Symbolic Behavior and Its Importance to Edu- cation," ETC., XIV (Autumn, 1956), 23-37. 184</page><page sequence="5">SPRING 1958 TOWARD A PSYCHO-LOGICS OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR determinism, but to say this does not minimize the importance or necessity of the ambition. IF radical psychology commitments is seriously which to I entertain would now this like new to approach suggest. it must make some radical commitments which I would now like to suggest. 1. It will be essential at the outset to ignore the conventional distinction between words and deeds. No one need be foolish enough to deny that there is a recognizable difference between what we call "talking" and 'acting," but we must stress that, for the purposes of this new psychology, attention to this difference will be dangerously misleading. We must try instead to join verbal and nonverbal behavior into one total, logically unified symbol-system. We must ask what each human act, whether it be verbal, gestural, postural, athletic, or gastronomic, is saying. We must try to relate each lift of the head, each stumble, each cough and sneeze, to some potentially verbal message which the person is sending to some audience. And we must equally perceive each verbal statement in its context of nonverbal behavior, never trusting its literal message as an isolated series of speech-sounds, but discerning what total behavioral message it is supporting. We do this all the time, of course, on the obvious level, in which a literally hostile remark is taken as a sign of affection if accompanied by a smile; and certainly psychiatrists become intuitively prone to this sort of non-literal interpretation. But to study verbal and nonverbal behavior consistently as parts of one integrated "role" or "message" system is something that psy- chology as a whole has not yet begun to do. 2. It must be recognized (or at least suspected) that stimuli which humans receive are immediately incorporated into some symbolic structure within their experience. Thus, instead of being regarded as mere causes of subsequent re- sponses, the afferent impulses moving from the sensory organs to the brain must be interpreted as the terminal code of a "message" which nature sends to the organism. This does not mean that nature is alive and filled with spirits trying to communicate with us; but it does mean that we respond to many of the impingements of our physical environment in much the same way that we react to words and sentences. Our response to physical impulses at the inception of life is no doubt physiologically determined, but with increasing socialization the reaction is less and less prescribed by the physical properties of these impulses and more and more prescribed by what these impulses mean in terms of some learned linguistic pattern. Intellectual sophistication is commonly supposed to kill the kind of animistic reactions which children and primitives have to inorganic nature, as the studies of Heinz Werner have emphasized. But what supersedes this animism is simply a different system of decoding and message-interpretation. The flash of lightning is no longer the warning of an angry God, but the "sign" of an atmospheric turmoil promising the subsequent "signs" of thunder, rain, flood, etc. The 183</page><page sequence="6">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS vol. XV, NO. 3 stimuli are no less "messages" because they lack a mentalistic message-sender; as modern cybernetic studies indicate, they are still agents of control which have a systematic and predictable effect on the behavior of the receiving apparatus. It is our ability to be controlled by nature in this way which is thus obtained by the "scientific/' as opposed to the "anthropomorphic," decoding system. Therefore the flash of lightning is experienced by us as an independent variable in the symbol system with which our "scientific" culture has "wired" us; but instead of sending us to prayer or human sacrifice to mollify a threatening spirit, it simply sends us to shelter to stay dry. With animals such "intelligent" re- sponses, when they occur, are either instinctual or conditioned. But with human beings such innate or trained reactions soon become fused into a network of social symbolism wherein they may be strengthened and frozen for life, modified and redirected, or even extinguished. The symbol pattern may be magical, religious, "common sense" or scientific, or any mixture thereof, but it still achieves a new integration or reintegration of the presymbolic response sets. But whether the new interpretative scheme be anthropomorphic or scientific, it works to unite the involuntary receptions of our experience with a kind of total (verbal and nonverbal) syntax, and thus bestows on them the meaning which influences our following behavior. 3. It is apparent, almost automatically, from this last commitment, that we must agree to regard the causal associations of stimuli as less important than their meaning. In fact, insofar as behaviorist psychology has found such prin- ciples as the laws of effect, contiguity, and frequency to be important deter- minants of adult human responses, it is only because humans have been trained in symbol-systems which have ratified and rationalized this kind of determinism. It is well known that humans, far more than any other animals, can be educated into or out of any particular interpretative code - regardless of whether it does or does not have a biological basis. "Superstition" and "science," for example, represent rival kinds of educational systems; and the superior predictability of the "scientific" system becomes a virtue only because of the arbitrary values which the symbols of our culture place upon accurate prediction - on making correct "maps" of future "territories." The causal relationships which "scientific" psychology seeks so single-mindedly are only worthy of interest to the degree that our previous symbolic conditioning endows them with worth. With the enculturated human, the psychological laws of the animal and the presymbolic child are gradually replaced by the rules of an adult symbol-system which may either reject or alter these laws or accept them into its own structure. Thus it is not so much a matter of what a given stimulus is, or how it is related to other stimuli and responses, as of what the stimulus means, and of how a particular human symbol-system happens to relate it. 4. These three preceding steps obviously make it necessary to reformulate and clarify the concept of "meaning." There has been a tendency in academic 186</page><page sequence="7">SPRING 1958 TOWARD A PSYCHO-LOGICS OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR psychology either to drop the concept altogether or to identify it loosely with the "response an organism makes to a stimulus." On the other hand, classical philosophy, due to its platonic legacy, found its "meaning of meaning" in what we would call syntactical relations, in the formal structure of "ideas." As empiricism developed, the concept of meaning veered more and more to the designative relations of symbols to sense-experience. And in more recent times, pragmatism and operationalism have fostered a use of "meaning" which refers to a function of human needs, purposes, and activities. Today, however, we find current "analytic" and "neo-positivist" philosophers to have made a strange return to the old platonic criterion - except that they have placed it on a linguistic instead of a mentalistic plane, speaking of the logical nexus of symbols rather than "ideas." In this partial return to platonism an important potential change has been made. The old dualistic assumption need no longer prevail. The "connectible" system of symbols, to use the valuable expression of Richard von Mises, may include not only the signs of formal language, but both our sense-data and our kinesthetic experiences and bodily operations. Thus the criterion needed for a new communicative psychology is that the meaning of any overt or covert symbol (which may include any stimulus received by the senses) lies only in the logical role which this symbol (or symbolic stimulus) plays in some given symbol- system. For which example, was almost in my unanimously own state acknowledged the inhabitants and recently which, felt in an earthquake, different which was almost unanimously acknowledged and which, in many different ways, changed the subsequent behavior of several million people. From the naive point of view this earthquake was a "fact" of nature, an event which simply was what it was ; the many different reactions to it were regarded as the "natural" consequences of this same "fact." But the difference between the effect of the earthquake on animals and on humans was interesting. The animals, on the whole, responded with certain standard forms of terror and panic - running under furniture or porches, going into semi-shock, screaming, etc. But the diversity of human response was far greater. Some primarily showed a radiating fear, much like the animals ; others a kind of practical concern, like a fisherman in a storm ; others, a curious scientific detachment; still others an anti-social cynicism, etc., etc. There were thousands of different kinds of reactions which could not, unlike those of the animals, have been predicted by knowledge of the earthquake alone. In other words, these more or less unique human reactions were only precipitated by the sensation of the earthquake. What determined them specifically was the role which this sensation (and its verbal corollary, the word "earthquake") happened to play in each person's special symbol-system. For most people the "objective" sensation was immediately taken over by a verbal expression of the form, "I feel an earthquake." The resultant behavior thus passed out of the 187</page><page sequence="8">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS vol. xv, no. 3 earthquake's hands, so to speak. It passed into the hands of the sentence which affirmed its occurrence. And this sentence began to put in motion whatever logical machinery was built into each particular person. To some people it no doubt stirred up sentences about vindictive, punishing gods ; to others it evoked assertions about personal danger or property damage; to still others it brought speculation on fault slips and geological probabilities, etc. The point is that the sensation per se meant nothing specifically; but it reaped thousands of different specific meanings through the thousands of different logical relationships it excited in thousands of different language systems. That the syntax of our verbal language carries such a heavy responsibility for our total behavior in such situations only confirms what Korzybski and the general semanticists have long been trying to emphasize. But this does not mean that only verbal language is responsible for the whole process. Verbal language composes only a small fraction of our total activity; the case of the general semanticist has been made more difficult by the already mentioned separation of words and deeds. It is hazardous to argue that such a little bit of language can affect so much that is not-language. This obstacle disappears, however, once we consider verbal and nonverbal behavior as logically related aspects of the same symbol-system. Then the effect of a single verbal statement on a mass of non- verbal behavior becomes no more mysterious than the effect of a single postulate on a vast mathematical system. Nor does this mean that our verbal symbols have automatic logical priority over our nonverbal symbols. In many areas of life, and in many individuals and cultures, nonverbal "statements" play the role of "postu- lates" and carry verbal behavior along with them. Where the major deter- minants lie would seem to depend on the logical machinery built into each par- ticular person. In one case, for instance, a verbal denial of the existence of God may drastically affect a person's stomach, while in another, the condition of his stomach may well determine whether or not he believes in God. IF mitting psychology itself to is a able new to metaphor, take the which four steps like those just suggested, of the traditional it will be systems, com- mitting itself to a new metaphor, which like those of the traditional systems, must be constantly applied and tested. It should be clear that this syntactical orientation does not necessarily dispute or refute the theories and findings of the other systems. To a considerable degree the reflexes, stimuli, responses, condi- tionings, cues, drives, and symptoms on which comparative and clinical research have placed causal and nosological emphasis would be embraced rather than excluded. But they would be interpreted as functions of a symbol-system instead of a physical system. Such a symbolic interpretation provides a new kind of search in answer to the question of how psychology can tell us better "What comes next?" The answer is that it can only tell us what comes next within each variant system of symbolic behavior. Once any symbolic game is mastered it is still a question as 188</page><page sequence="9">SPRING 1958 TOWARD A PSYCHO-LOGICS OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR to whether a given individual is playing that game or one that only partly re- sembles it. This is a challenge to decipher and decode; cryptoanalysis must precede psychoanalysis, as it always has, of course, in the intuitive work of the best practitioners. The game - the "language" - may be one previously unknown. Thus it would be impossible to master many of these "languages" in advance of studying the individuals who use them. With most people, however, conditioned as they are by certain common cultural logics, the task of discerning their "grammar" can partly rely on a backlog of previous social learning, in much the way that Latin may help us understand Spanish. The private behaviorial language within each person, except perhaps in the case of psychosis, has usually made itself "connectible" in the general behavioral language of his society; and in this respect, the sociological study of symbolic behavior becomes prior to any psychological study. From sense this of partisanship viewpoint the to psychologist some well-memorized must become notational a logician, scheme, not in but the usual sense of partisanship to some well-memorized notational scheme, but as an imaginative and creative discoverer of the subtle and abstract relations between the many symbolic facets of human behavior. Thus the word "psychologist" reverts to its etymological source as "psycho-logician," and "psychology" be- comes, as Korzybski insisted that it be called, "psycho-logics." That the logic of the psyche is peculiarly human has been recognized early in man's experience. That this logic, which is reflected most conventionally in formal language, is also distributed throughout man's soma and commands large ranges of his total be- havior, is the insight which now awaits attention and development from the powerful community of modern psychologists. 189</page></plain_text>
