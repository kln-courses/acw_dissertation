<plain_text><page sequence="1">EMPTINESS, OTHERNESS, AND IDENTITY A Feminist Perspective Paula M. Cooey Discussions of otherness in a favorable light are not particularly fashion able in feminist or liberal theological circles today, and for good reason. Particularly when it comes to the character of divine reality as other, neo orthodox theology, especially the early position of Karl Barth, echoes in the background. More importantly, in the arena of human interrelations and relations with extrahuman life, the other likely becomes the projection of a dominant community's racism, classism, sexism, or anthropocentrism. In addition, in the economy of individual identity, the other serves more often than not as the grounds for individual alienation rather than as the possibility for good will or intimacy. Whether the context is human-divine relations, humans in relation to nature, communal interaction, or the structuring of human consciousness, otherness is problematic. Such problems notwithstanding, the ascription of otherness, once it is demythologized and demystified, serves as a dynamic force for social and personal transformation. Transvalued, otherness, as it is associated with both central religious symbols and philosophical concepts, challenges static, com placent views of person and community. Otherness further serves as a necessary condition for differentiation in relation and is, therefore, as essen tial to intimacy as it is to oppression. As will shortly become clear, ascribing otherness plays a necessary role in structuring individual identity in relation to community as well. The question then becomes how to demythologize and demystify our concepts and images of the other. For me, coming to terms with the tension between the liberating qualities and the oppressing qualities of otherness in human life has required both feminist analysis and interreligious dialogue. On the one hand, feminist theory provides a devastating critique of the damaging role our views of the other can play in the lives of women. On the other hand, dialogue with Buddhists and engagement with Buddhist thought in light of a feminist critique has challenged me to imagine new alternatives growing out of the framework of my own religious heritage. Buddhist Christian dialogue has served as a special instance of the very interaction of self and other of which I speak here and has also enriched my awareness of the resources for change available in feminist and Christian traditions. Taken</page><page sequence="2">8 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion together, Buddhist and feminist views generate a new appreciation for the other ness that is within each human being and within which all humans live and move. 1 In this essay I trace the movement from the problematic nature of otherness to otherness as a powerful resource for transformation. However abstract and complex the language of self and other may be, I am addressing a profoundly practical question: How do people (more often than not women) who have been socialized to be heteronomous-who, in some cases, have been punished for not cooperating with socialization by being identified with evil-give up concerns with egos that are crippled by nagging self-doubt and a lack of self-worth? Through a comparative analysis of "emptiness" in the context of Buddhist traditions and the concept of "God as wholly other" in the context of Christian traditions, I suggest ways of rethinking identity in general and woman's identity as woman in particular. Part one of this essay sets out what is problematic about the interaction between the concepts "other" and "woman" with brief attention to how Christian symbolism has reinforced the problems as actual women seek a strong sense of identity in community. The second part compares the functional similarities and dif ferences between the role of emptiness in Buddhist life and thought and that of God as wholly other in Christian life and thought. I conclude with a section that suggests a transvaluation of the role of otherness in the formation of identity in a Christian context. I "Other," a somewhat empty concept for purposes of this discussion, refers simply to whatever is not the individual human self or ego. When attributed to the deity in the context of Western monotheism, as in the case of God as wholly other, the concept refers to transcendence. Its chief significance lies in the role it plays rather than in its substantive meaning, a point to which I shall return later. Note for the moment, however, that the 1 This interaction of feminist critique and interreligious dialogue reflects processes that, for all their limitations, Jacques Derrida and Jurgen Habermas, in very different ways, try to capture: Derrida through deconstruction and Habermas through his concept of "com municative action." See for examples, Derrida, Writing and Difference, trans. A. Bass (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978) and Habermas, The Theory of Commu nicative Action, trans. Thomas McCarthy (Beacon Press: Boston, Massachusetts, 1984). For a current example of theological appropriation of Derrida, see Mark C. Taylor, Erring: A Postmodern A/theology (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984).

By contrast, the concept "other" interacts with the concept "woman" in ways that generate enormous suffering and conflict in actual women's lives. This suffering manifests itself in at least two dis tinguishable but related ways. In the first place, within the context of patriarchy as a socioeconomic and political structure, woman-as-woman in relation to man is other-directed, her status, power, and authority derived by affiliation with her father or her husband and the children they produce together. In the second place, woman, considered as woman in herself, again in the context of patriarchy, is conceptually linked with what is other to man (as man is identified with culture, mind, and spirit), what is outside his control, namely, nature, embodiment, the material order. In short, woman becomes other in relation to man as self. In terms of power, woman culturally signifies man's self alienation, a screen upon which to project what he denies or devalues in relation to himself. In this situation psychological and social conflicts emerge as women strive for sexual equity, liberty, and justice as these involve a positive sense of identity in relation to community. These conflicts revolve around a false dualism of heteronomy and autonomy.2 Furthermore, reli gious symbolism and practice, and Christian traditions in particular, play no small role in supporting this situation. Understanding this conceptual inter action and the conflict it produces requires brief definition of terms such as patriarchy, heteronomy, and autonomy and the distinction between "woman as woman" and "actual women's lives." Patriarchy as I am using it here refers to the social organization of a culture into systems that are hierarchical and male-dominated in terms of power and value. Though slightly more fluid than the image of a pyramid suggests, patriarchy, nevertheless, resembles a pyramid in that an extremely small minority of people hold the greatest power over a remaining majority. The pyramid or system as a whole includes members ranked in power and value according to class, ethnic or racial identity, and creed, in terms of the interests and norms established and maintained by the minority in power. Both access to material goods and cultural capital depend in large part on 2 The issue of the relationship between biology and culture in the social construction of sexual difference is beyond the scope of this essay. The scholarship generated by this issue is extensive. For anyone unfamiliar with the discussion, Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex, trans. H. M. Parshley (New York: Knopf, 1953) provides an excellent starting point. See also Paula Cooey, "The Word Become Flesh: Woman's Body, Language, and Value," in Embodied Love: Sensuality and Relationship as Feminist Values, ed. Paula Cooey, Sharon Farmer, and Mary Ellen Ross (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1988). The interaction of "otherness" with class, race, and creed is an equally vast topic also beyond the scope of this essay; however, there are surely at least strong similarities involved in all cases due to the identification often made between "other" and whatever is different to the extent that difference is perceived to be strange, threatening, or in any way fascinating.</page><page sequence="4">10 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion particular rank and the extent to which ranking itself is fluid or rigid. (Cultural capital as used here refers to the power, status, and authority-if not money-one gains in return for intellectual or artistic achievement as determined by patriarchal canons of taste.) As the word patriarchy denotes, the fathers rule the system. Just as arche or "rule" assumes difference in rank; so pater or "father" presupposes sexual difference. The chief characteristic all ranks hold in common, irre spective of all other differences, is that within the designation of class, ethnicity, or creed a woman's status, power, and authority, indeed her identity as a woman, derive from affiliation with a man of the same rank according to whether he is her father or husband. The derivative character of woman's power, status, and authority as it influences identity usually means that whether her value is positive or negative it is secondary, subordinated to that of a man within the same rank, even though she may be ranked as superior or inferior relative to other ranks. The substance of her role in society will ordinarily be determined according to a division of labor broken down along the lines of sexual difference. The society or culture will seek to cultivate certain traits in each sex in order to fulfill the division of tasks. On the whole, regardless of culture or rank, the tasks allotted to men will likely be more highly valued and rewarded in terms of both economic and cultural capital than those allotted to women. In this sense patriarchy is charac teristically androcentric; that is, the norms and values center on male perceptions, interpretations, experience, needs, and interests. The complexity of patriarchy notwithstanding, the social expectations of cultures defined by sexually differentiated roles dramatically affect the lives of actual women and men who must either fulfill or challenge sociocultural expectations. In either case, tremendous psychological and social conflict may ensue. At least in Anglo-European culture (I won't presume to speak for other cultures) this is due in part to a bifurcation in sexually defined roles and the character traits associated with them along so-called feminine and mas culine lines, reflecting severe dualisms of feeling and reason, body and mind, matter and spirit, nature and culture, and other and self. The consequent social expectations tend to emphasize characteristics associated with hetero nomy such as receptivity, nurture, and self-sacrifice for women and traits congenial to autonomy such as assertiveness, independence, and self-control for men. Thus the concept "woman" entails the expectation of other-direc tedness. Speaking ideally, woman's identity as woman demands the cultiva tion of characteristics in actual women that encourage actual women to be heteronomous regardless of the roles they may fulfill that require asser tiveness, independence, and self-control. A woman's identity as woman reflects the working out of the relation between the concept "woman" and individual women's actual existence. Heteronomy as other-directedness does not alone sufficiently account</page><page sequence="5">Cooey: Emptiness, Otherness, and Identity-A Feminist Perspective 11 for the role played by otherness in the formation of the concept "woman" as it interacts with women's actual existence, however. Woman as woman is other defined as well. Other-directed, and identified largely in relation to another as daughter or wife, woman as woman in Anglo-European culture is also defined as other in relation to man as self. Women who for whatever reasons, whether of necessity or choice, reject the role of other-directedness chal lenge the patriarchal framework established to control them. Women (or anyone else) regarded as blatantly out of the control of patriarchy-for example, Jews in the context of anti-Semitism or blacks in the context of white racism-come to symbolize an evil that is actually a self-alienation of the dominant community. Defined as essentially other, woman comes to represent all that androcentric consciousness fears and denies within itself but at the same time cannot live without.3 This includes the qualities of finitude, physical suffering, and sexuality associated with embodiment, and by extrapolation the qualities of necessity, causality, inevitability, re petitiveness, and continuity associated with the natural order. Religious traditions play no small role in socializing women to accept male definition and other-directedness; indeed, other-directedness on the part of women presupposes male definition of woman as other in an absolute sense. In Christian traditions, for example, an overweening focus on sin as pride and self-sacrificing love as the chief manifestation of redemption exag gerates tendencies to other-directedness in women in the extreme.4 In addition, the misogynistic writings of many Christian male ascetics exemplify well the projection of woman as other, as her otherness is in turn identified with evil.5 The net effect in either case is to render women and men unable to love or to accept love unqualified by struggles to control or to escape control. Though both women and men within Christian traditions have begun to reform these traditions in ways that challenge the legitimacy of patriarchal structures at their roots, at best much remains to be done; at worst it is not at all clear that Christian traditions are reformable. II What follows is a necessarily sketchy comparative analysis of emptiness within a Buddhist context and God as wholly other in a Christian context. As an outsider to Buddhism, and a Christian theologian, I feel compelled to 3 One need not look far for examples in "real life." Merely mention Mary Daly's name in mixed company and observe how often responses are defensive or overtly hostile. 4 See Valerie Saiving's "The Human Situation: A Feminine View" in Womanspirit Rising, ed. Carol P. Christ and Judith Plaskow (New York: Harper and Row, 1979), and Judith Plaskow's Sex, Sin, and Grace (Lantham, Md.: University Press of America, 1980). 5 Rosemary Ruether and Mary Daly have argued this thesis in a variety of different works. For a more recent and particularly revolting set of examples see Daly, Pure Lust (Boston: Beacon Press, 1984), 36 ff.</page><page sequence="6">12 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion qualify this analysis in advance. Both traditions are preeminently practical in their central focus; hence, unless one keeps in mind the emphasis on practice in both traditions, it is somewhat misleading to submit either emptiness or God as wholly other as concepts to intellectual analysis. Emp tiness is to be existentially realized by the adherent, rather than merely understood. Such realization occurs, if at all, in the midst of a rigorous discipline that includes meditation, the cultivation of certain virtues or character traits, physical labor, and diet restrictions. Similarly, the concept of "God as other" is related to the injunction against graven images-an injunc tion prophetic in nature. In Christian thought God as other is also a presup position for an apophatic tradition, itself a manifestation of Christian mysticism. Like emptiness, God as other is a focus for meditation. In other words, both emptiness and divine otherness form, albeit in different con texts, part of what William James would call "a total reaction to life."6 In addition, God as wholly other and related terms I use here such as the otherness of God or divine otherness are not, strictly speaking, technical terms in a Christian or Western vocabulary-nor is it even clear that they should be.7 I use such terms to distinguish those attributes and roles of the deity in Western monotheism that differentiate God from human selves, usually by emphasizing human limitation, dependence, and relatedness to the rest of creaturely existence. It is difficult to use this language without its becoming reified and without implying some kind of dualism within the deity that I wish to avoid. Nevertheless, Christians as well as Jews and Muslims speak of God in terms of what God and humans hold in common and in terms of how God is other than human. It is with the latter aspect of God and its failures and strengths that I am concerned here. Emptiness Emptiness, as I understand it, qualifies, indeed constitutes and interre lates all existence.8 Emptiness has no positive existence; that is to say, it 6 William James, The Varieties of Religious Experience (London: Penguin, 1982), 35. 7 James Gustafson sees the movement from an experience of others and otherness to "the experience of the reality of an Other" as distinctive of monotheism. See Ethicsfrom a Theocentric Perspective, vol. 1, Theology and Ethics (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981), 135-38. Mary Daly in Pure Lust, especially 395-404, speaks of realizing otherness that is self in ways very similar to the Buddhist realization of emptiness, however. 8 What follows is my own interpretation as influenced by a variety of different readings, but most especially of Nagarjuna in translation. I am aware that there are many, some times, conflicting, views of emptiness within Buddhist philosophy. Other helpful re sources include the following: William Theodore de Bary, The Buddhist Tradition in India, China, and Japan (New York: Random House, 1972); John B. Cobb, "Buddhist Emptiness and the Christian God," Journal of the American Academy of Religion 45, no. 1 (1977);</page><page sequence="7">Cooey: Emptiness, Otherness, and Identity-A Feminist Perspective 13 cannot be abstracted from that which it qualifies as if it were an entity in its own right. Rather emptiness is a way of emphasizing "dependent origina tion" which refers to the interdependence or interconnectedness of whatever is with all that is. Furthermore, the realization of emptiness in the life of a Buddhist is an ongoing, progressive process of seeking enlightenment that places heavy emphasis on the cultivation of compassion toward all sentient being. One may say that realization of emptiness marks the beginning of wisdom which is itself, ideally speaking, inseparable from the cultivation of compassion.9 In Western philosophical language emptiness is perhaps better recogniz able in terms of its role than as a concept or symbol with substantive content. An emphasis on function or role may be misleading, however, unless one takes into account two major differences between Western thought, as influenced by Immanuel Kant, on the one hand, and Buddhist assumptions about the nature of reality, oh the other hand. For Buddhists emptiness constitutes a quality, albeit "negative," of reality; in this highly restricted sense, the concept describes how things are-for example, they are always changing. In addition, in spite of significant differences among Buddhist schools of thought, on the whole, Buddhists assume that the order of knowing synchronizes with the order of being for those directed toward enlightenment. Western thought as influenced heavily by Kant presupposes that the order of knowing is a reversal of the order of being in ways that make it difficult at best to speak any longer as if there were direct access to "the way things are," even in respect to constant change.0l This difference in assumptions has several implications for grasping the significance of emp tiness. Misunderstanding the differences in presuppositions can lead Western Edward Conze, Buddhism: Its Essence and Development (New York: Harper and Row, 1975); Edward Conze, Buddhist Meditation (Harper and Row: New York, 1975); Edward Conze, I. B. Horner, David Snellgrove, and Arthur Wally, eds., Buddhist Texts through the Ages (New York: Harper and Row, 1964); T. R. V. Murti, The Central Philosophy of Buddhism (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1960); Frederick J. Streng, Emptiness: A Study in Religious Meaning (Nashville, Tenn.: Abingdon Press, 1967); Osel Tendzin, Buddha in the Palm of Your Hand (Boston: Shambala, 1982). 9 It is important to recognize that Buddhist monastic orders devoted to the realization of emptiness, not unlike their male Christian counterparts, tend to defend celibacy by mentally degrading women. See Conze, Buddhism, 58, and Diana Y. Paul, Women in Buddhism (Berkeley, Calif.: Lancaster-Miller Pubs., 1980). As my friend Karen-Marie Yust has observed, it is important to be aware of misogyny wherever it occurs. 10 For the classic expression of the reversal see Immanuel Kant, The Critique of Pure Reason, trans. Norman Kemp Smith (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1929). For an alter native view in Western thought see Alfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality (New York: The Free Press, 1929), especially his distinction between "presentational imme diacy" and "causal efficacy" (195-212).</page><page sequence="8">14 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion ers to reify emptiness-to take it too literally as a negation of space. On the contrary, emptiness qualifies time as well as space and therefore events, experiences, and processes as well as things. Equally importantly, one of the primary effects of realizing emptiness is to deny independent, inherent existence to things, rather than to negate things; therefore emptiness should not be confused with nihilism. Whatever is, in relation to all that is, is always in the midst of or on the way to becoming something else, hence empty of inherent existence. The realization of emptiness, then, not only heightens an awareness of what is, but also emphasizes that whatever is, is radically open. Because the order of knowing synchronizes with the order of being in a Buddhist context, this awareness plays a major soteriological role in seeking enlightenment. Emptiness, existentially realized in the life of a practicing Buddhist, dramatizes to the adherent that her or his own individual ego or self has no independent or inherent existence. Whoever is, exists in full particularity in relation to all else, in the context of continual change. Profound recognition of this situation as a condition of and for one's identity is one way of experiencing loss of ego. Stated more abstractly, the ego or self has no substantively or temporally immutable content, no essence-al though identity as such is not negated. Emptiness, recognized as a quality of all life including one's own, alters one's orientation toward self and other by freeing one from the need either to defend or to attack that presupposes the independent and oppositional existence of self and other. Provided emptiness itself does not become reified-a possibility Buddhists take quite seriously-emptiness potentially can play an iconoclastic role in the social transformation of all sentient being toward peace with justice. In addition, one of the more distinctive and appealing characteristics of emptiness as a central concept or symbol (though not wholly without problems for someone steeped in Christian traditions) is its lack of personification. Emptiness as transpersonal or nonpersonal in character constitutes and relates persons to themselves, to one another, and to the rest of creaturely existence. Reflection on the significance of this absence of personification or anthropomorphism has allowed me to gain fresh insight into certain aspects of my own tradition. God as Wholly Other Christians as well as Jews and Muslims have attributed a quality of radical otherness to God, more or less emphatically throughout Western history. In many specifically Christian contexts, most especially Reformed Protestant theology, faith in God is itself a gift, its giver totally other in its fullest reality from the feeble concepts of human imagining. For many Christians within this tradition this quality of total otherness that transcends human imagination is overcome only at the divine initiative, an initiative</page><page sequence="9">Cooey: Emptiness, Otherness, and Identity-A Feminist Perspective 15 enacted in the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and ongoing in human life throughout history, both prior and subsequent to the Christ event. This enactment, understood as the redemption of human life, restores human-divine relationship as intended by divine creation, even surpassing the original divine intention, an intention subverted by human sin. The human role in this drama of creation and redemption is chiefly that of sinner, helpless in her or his strivings to attain salvation, responsible for sin and never free from this condition except by the grace of God. While this role as sinner is inescapable, nevertheless, the primary focus in this way of viewing God is on divine grace as salvific, liberating the human will from its bondage to sin. Radically other in relation to human imagination and control, God as author of existence and value, and therefore other than finite exis tence, is at the same time present in and intimately related to all reality through the exercise of creative and redeeming love. From John Calvin to Karl Barth and the Niebuhr family, Reformed Protestant theologians have insisted on human dependence on divine grace. However else they may have accounted for sin in light of creation and redemption, even theologians as different as Jonathan Edwards and Friedrich Schleiermacher hold in common the absoluteness of human dependence on a grace that is altogether other than and outside of human control. This grace, characterized by love, generates the faith that allows human beings themselves to participate in divine love.11 This love ideally centers Christian identity and directs itself beyond the deity, even the Christian community, toward all life. This view of the otherness of God stems from the biblical injunction against idolatry (Deuteronomy 4:15). In its biblical context its role is largely prophetic (see for example, Isaiah 58). It manifests itself philosophically in the via negativa, the way to God through negation. Ascribing otherness to God on these grounds performs the critical function of relativizing the finite and destabilizing religious and political hierarchies. For example, God as other is always more than whatever specific image, concept, or symbol we imagine, or even all such imaginings taken together. Thus attributing fa therhood or even trinity to the deity is in theory provisional; to grant absolute, central authority to such images, or for that matter, any image, violates the prohibition against graven images. In either case language is at best metaphorical and at worst a reification, meaning that the otherness of God destabilizes any attempt to absolutize any other reality as sovereign, as a presumption to speak from the divine perspective. In this respect, God as wholly other challenges not only language itself, but the power arrangements 11 See for example, Jonathan Edwards, The Nature of True Virtue (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1960) and Karl Barth, Epistle to the Romans, trans. Edwyn C. Hoskins (London: Oxford University Press, 1968).</page><page sequence="10">16 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion it shapes and reflects. At the same time, the relativizing of the finite ideally allows its genuine appreciation as divine artifact. Whereas God is nothing finite, whatever is, is what it is and is of value by virtue of its origin in divine creation. In short, ideally a Christian life centered by God is devoted to right relations with self and others, even nonhuman others, all of whom or which share the condition of creatureliness, except of course the Creator. Thus the otherness of God decentralizes not only the individual human ego, but political, ecclesiastical, and social authority, as well as the human species in relation to the rest of the created order, and it does so in ways intended to value positively the created order as a whole. Emptiness, Divine Otherness, and the Need for an Absolute In spite of substantive differences, there are striking and significant parallels between the roles played by emptiness in the formation of Buddhist identity, on the one hand, and by divine otherness in shaping Christian identity, on the other hand.12 Formally speaking, just as the realization of emptiness occurs in a wider context that relates it ideally to the cultivation of compassion, so divine otherness is inseparable from a divine love in which humans are invited through grace to participate by faith. Like emptiness, God as other qualifies all time and space, constituting whatever is in relation to all else in such a way that nothing within sentient reality has independent existence. In addition, divine otherness, like emptiness, ideally mitigates against reification in ways that can encourage, through loss of ego, an identity freed from the need to defend itself or attack others and freed for acknowl edging its relatedness with others. Furthermore, provided the otherness of God does not itself become reified, otherness plays an iconoclastic role in the social transformation of all creation toward peace with justice by challenging exploitative and exclusionary values and power structures. There are nevertheless serious differences between emptiness and God as other, two of which have direct bearing on the issue of how "other" and "woman" interact in ways problematic to actual women. The first pertains to the logical status of the otherness of God in relation to that which it qualifies. The second significant difference lies in the anthropomorphic (at best) and andromorphic (at worst) character of the deity as symbolized in Christian life and thought. The ultimacy of emptiness in relation to finite existence lies as far as I can tell in its logical priority. By this I mean that emptiness is empty-a 12 For a succinct delineation of important differences see John Cobb, "Buddhist Emp tiness and the Christian God," Journal of the American Academy of Religion 45, no. 1 (1977). Though I obviously disagree with his claim that synthesizing being and value necessarily proves unstable in Christian theology, I agree with his argument that faith in God may be compatible with the realization of emptiness.</page><page sequence="11">Cooey: Emptiness, Otherness, and Identity-A Feminist Perspective 17 distinction rather than an abstraction-a distinction or quality the realization of which allows one to transcend all dualism while remaining differentiated and related in the world. According to one scholar of Buddhist thought . . . the expression of'emptiness' is not the manifestation of Absolute Real ity, the revelation of the Divine, but the means for dissipating the desire for such an Absolute."13 By contrast, the ultimacy of God as totaliter aliter, wholly other, is more ambiguous, and Christian faith far more ambivalent, regarding the dissipa tion of a desire for absolutes. Faith in God as other, like realization of emptiness, discloses the relativity, contingency, and transience of whatever or whoever is; but God as totaliter aliter, in contrast to emptiness, is posited as absolute. Christian theologians and mystics may wrangle among them selves over whether existence can be properly attributed to God; neverthe less, part of the significance of divine otherness in Christian orthodoxy is that it permits assigning a reality to God not dependent upon the existence or reality of anything else. God may be Holy Nothingness; God may be the Being of being; God may be the Void; God may be infinite; or God may be finite in some meaningful sense. Christians may be theistic, pantheistic, panentheistic, agnostic, or atheistic. In any case, God-reconstructed, doubted, or denied-possesses a reality supreme in relation to all else, a supremacy in value, if not in power.14 To put it slightly differently, the otherness of God seems more often to locate rather than dissipate the "desire for an Absolute." Once located, otherness, the very quality that should have prevented reification, itself becomes reified. Additional qualities associated with divine otherness such as transcendence, boundlessness, and nothingness become the "somewhere else-ness," the "some-other-timeness," and the vacuity of the deity. Faith in God becomes an alienation, both personal and social, of human life just as Feuerbach, Marx, Engels, Nietzsche, and Freud have charged. God as wholly other becomes "the shadow of death-eternal death."15 Reification of God as wholly other is related in part to an thropomorphism and andromorphism-the second difference pertinent to my comparison. Emptiness may well be empty, but God is not exclusively other. 16 On the contrary, otherness notwithstanding, for Christian faith there 13 Frederick Streng, Emptiness, 162. 14 Philosophers and theologians from William James to the present, who have sought to conceive God as in some sense finite, have placed limits on divine power, but as far as I know, not on divine goodness. 15 See Mark C. Taylor, Erring, 23. Taylor's assessment of post-modern consciousness is highly persuasive, particularly with reference to an Anglo-European Protestant male tradition. 16 The emptiness of emptiness is no doubt as subject to reification as the otherness of God.</page><page sequence="12">18 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion is a symbolic morphological resemblance between God and human being that in turn distinguishes the human creature in value as well as kind from the rest of creaturely existence. In the language of Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, humans are created in or to the image of God. Whether we conceive God as like us by analogia entis (Aquinas), or we conceive ourselves as like God by analogia relationis (Barth), whether we focus primarily on creation or on redemption, some resemblance between the divine and the human is central to Christian epistemology and therefore to all subsequent claims of faith. This resemblance manifests itself in Christian doctrine in two related forms, the doctrine of the Trinity and the doctrine of the Incarnation. Within the context of patriarchy, this likeness predictably and inescapably takes a distinctively andromorphic turn. In the case of the Trinity, the Western church since Augustine has focused with few exceptions on the human mind as the primary model for the interrelatedness of God as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. This model has proven unsatisfactory for a variety of reasons, not the least of which include its individualism, maleness, and lack of explicit relatedness to sentience. If the Western church has erred on the side of unitariness, the Eastern church with its more social and familial models has tended toward tritheism; furthermore, models in both churches have empha sized maleness. Likewise the doctrine of the Incarnation, an attempt, among other things, to express the relation of the Godhead to the created order through the two-natured Christ, has fared no better in regard to an dromorphism. In either case, the identification of God with man, to the exclusion of woman, remains problematic to this day. An identification of God with man, however, is idolatrous from within the logic of a Christian framework (or for that matter, from within a Western monotheistic framework). Such idolatry only further testifies to the extent to which God as other becomes a reification that encourages rather than pre vents human alienation. It is as if "God" becomes the repository of all that patriarchal, androcentric consciousness seeks to be or to have, and cannot, in ways that simultaneously attract and repel, for example, all powerful, all knowing, and not bound by time and space. 17 The otherness of God, like the otherness of woman, becomes a demonic perversion, damaging to men and women alike. The otherness of God, seen in light of emptiness, involves mutually incompatible tendencies. All too often, faith in God becomes the ultimate act of idolatry that succeeds in negating what is and becomes an object sought for its own sake. This perversion of faith manifests itself most clearly in the 17 Rudolph Otto might call this mysterium tremendum et fascinans. See The Idea of the Holy, trans. John W. Harvey (New York: Oxford University Press, 1958). For this insight I am indebted to William O. Walker, Jr., professor of New Testament, Trinity University.</page><page sequence="13">Cooey: Emptiness, Otherness, and Identity-A Feminist Perspective 19 confusion of otherness with andromorphism that presently characterizes the symbol "God" and permeates the entire symbol system within Christian life and practice. Nevertheless, like the horizon, always in motion, giving human beings both a visual orientation in time and space and the secure and certain awareness that there is more than meets the eye, divine otherness, if construed differently, can direct one to the interrelatedness, superabun dance, and openendedness of what is. Faith centered by God in this context encourages an identity characterized by clarity of vision, trust, loyalty, good will, sober hope, wonder, humor, and a sense of one's own limitation in the midst of the grimness that dominates the age in which we live. Neither sentimental nor cynical, such an identity grows to lose not just egocentricity, but even the idolatrous desire for an Absolute. Having nothing to lose, especially not even an ego, can fuel an ongoing revolution in value aimed toward peace with justice in this world. For this energy to be soteriological rather than damaging, however, it must be anchored in an identity directed by and toward universal love. Furthermore, one who seeks to love inclusively must herself or himself be taken for granted as included as an object of love-in short, the lover must be beloved in continually regenerative ways. To put it bluntly, the ego, its worth, its pleasure, its pain, and even its loss must ultimately cease to be central concerns for those who seek a better world for all creaturely existence. In different cultural and historical contexts both the realization of emptiness and faith in God have decentralized the ego in ways that cultivate a sense of identity that is simultaneously personal and communal-one that potentially, even actually, allows a person to participate in such an ongoing revolution in value. III Divine otherness as it interacts with andromorphism nevertheless bears a striking formal resemblance to the interaction between the projection of women as other and the identification with man as self as well. Otherness becomes located and defined chiefly in terms of andromorphic imagery such that the symbol "God" becomes an exclusively androcentric means of but tressing patriarchy. Likewise otherness and the concept "woman" interact in relation to each other and in relation to "man" to render specious most concepts of humanity. The dualism of male-identified self and female-identi fied other that should have been a dialectic of self and other ongoing within each human identity and available to all human beings contaminates every theory of identity and every claim to universality including the claim to universal love. In other words, the ego-alter, or self-other, dialectic charac teristic of the development of human identity, and ostensibly constitutive of the divine imagined as triune, has been distorted by granting priority in both</page><page sequence="14">20 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion logic and value to the self, projected as male. Given the obvious priority of otherness, we would do well to begin any discussion of the development of identity with a focus on the role played by otherness in the construction of identity. 18 So long as discussions of identity begin with what it means to be a self or to become a self, instead of what it means to be brought into existence and sustained by forces outside one's immediate control-for example, milk, air, water, light, and the nurture, abuse, or indifference of others-a sexually differentiated dualism of self and other, theologically justified in terms of a distinctly male deity, will perpetuate itself.19 Relations of intimacy provide a case in point. While such relations are highly complex and manifest themselves in a variety of different ways and a multitude of different contexts, intimacy in general depends upon a dialectic of closeness or familiarity (knowing another) and distance or differentiation (knowing an other). It is beyond the confines of this discussion to analyze even this dialectic in all its fullness; one of its distinctive features, however, bears directly upon the emergence of identity from a matrix of self-other relations, namely the sense of humility that one feels in the midst of experi encing intimacy in conjunction with a sense of liberation. As I reflect upon those moments I identify in my life as most intimate, I have been struck again and again by the recurring awareness that in those events I own neither the other nor myself. Stated in positive terms, one enduring characteristic of intimacy for me has been the extent to which the other, myself, and the relation itself are gifts. Whether the other is a student I teach or the teacher who taught me, the child I bore or one of my own parents, an author I am reading who may be living or dead, a person to whom I am listening whom I have never met before or a friend, someone I may never see again or the lover and companion to whom I have commited my life, the other and I are not so much "one" as we are together. That is, the connection I experience is not one of fusion, but one of communion in which the other and I remain distinct. Yet this distinctiveness is not so much a decision, an exercise of human will, as it is a necessary quality of each of us that is not in the control of either of us. In short, the other is present to me present as distinctively other, a distinctiveness that in its humbling of any 18 Stanley Hauerwas defines the self's freedom in the presence of the other largely in terms of hospitality to the stranger. His brief discussion is very appealing. It does not address the issue of what it means to be conceived primarily as the stranger, however. See The Peaceable Kingdom (Notre Dame, Ind.: University of Notre Dame Press, 1983), 44 46. Scripture seems to call for some sense of identification with what it means to be the stranger, the guest, or the alien as well as the host. 19 Object relations theorists make an attempt to address this aspect of the development of identity; however, except for the work of Nancy Chodorow, object relations theory lacks at this point sufficient sociopolitical critique. See Chodorow, The Reproduction of Mother ing: Psychoanalysis and the Sociology of Gender (Berkeley, Calif.: University of California Press, 1978).</page><page sequence="15">Cooey: Emptiness, Otherness, and Identity-A Feminist Perspective 21 attempts on my part to project my own ego, ironically but positively grants me my own distinctiveness. The very distinctiveness of the other in its resistance to my projection frees me from the need to control and frees me simply to respond to the event of our intimacy as such. Apart from this responsivity, "I" am to some extent an afterthought borne of a "Thou." Exploring emptiness, especially the emptiness of emptiness, persuades me that otherness as such not only has logical priority but priority in value. Just as emptiness is not in parity with fullness in Buddhist life, so otherness is not in parity with self. Just as emptiness is not the negation of fullness but a reminder to Buddhists that fullness, however full, is never complete in a static sense, so otherness as it qualifies and relates all existence including one's own, does not negate the self, but serves to remind one in the context of Christian faith that differentiated identity is a gift. Emptiness and otherness are both ways of articulating change, its cen trality to all sentient existence, and its significance for human life and identity. From the outside looking in (no doubt a dangerous position, for it is difficult to avoid idealizing and romanticizing), the Buddhists have done a better job on the whole of addressing the human craving for absolutes than we have within Christian traditions. By subordinating the radical otherness of the deity to a triune model of highly masculinized selfhood, we have sabotaged the destabilizing power of the divine and have elevated human maleness. The projection of woman as other correlates well with the pro jection of God as other in this framework. Both concepts serve to locate the craving for absoluteness, though in opposing ways. "Woman" constitutes the denial that change, particularly bodily change, is relevant, never mind central, to human identity and life. "God," as eternal, interrelated, but disembodied self, represents the failed attempt to defeat change by project ing an unending ego. I suggest that Christian theology and Christian practice begin with the recognition and realization of the priority of the radical otherness of God, an otherness present throughout creaturely or sentient existence, what Sallie McFague proposes as a "worldly transcendence. "20 The otherness of which I speak refers to the contingency of all existence, its differentiation, its interde pendence, its sentience, and therefore its finitude. In this context the self is no longer its own project, measured in terms of fulfillment or failure, nor is it at the mercy of others. Rather the self emerges from a matrix of relations with others as a configuration of responses, an ever-changing agency. Virtually impossible to protect, defend, or externally control, such a self is neither subject nor object. Rather the self is a reflexive sensory and imagining unity, located as and identified by its sentience in relation to others. 20 See Models of God: Theology for an Ecological Nuclear Age (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1987), 184-87.</page><page sequence="16">22 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion Cultivating a steadfast awareness of otherness as fundamental, even central, to one's identity as Christian and a chief characteristic of one's faith needs to be distinguished not only from the idolatrous desire for the Abso lute, but, particularly if one is a woman, from being other-directed and other-defined. For example, centering identity exclusively on meeting the needs and desires of others, however motivated and whether conscious or unconscious, represents a failure to resist spiritual pride. It is a move to control others, regardless of how much it results from socialization and regardless of how covert the control. Moves to control others, overt or covert, presuppose the very self-other dualism I am here rejecting. To acknowledge otherness as a quality of one's own identity as well as that of other beings is to resist subtle as well as direct attempts to control. The issue is one of respect. Furthermore, consciously assuming the position of the other in some exclusive sense serves as the correlate of other-directedness.21 So long as this position is identified with being out of control, it is merely a reaction to control, not the transcendence of a power struggle. Given this context, one remains ultimately the negative support for a conventional dualism of good and evil. Meanwhile, the sociocultural system that fosters both other-direc tedness as the supreme virtue definitive of woman's identity as woman, and conventional dualisms of good and evil that require woman-out-of-control to set the standard for evil, grinds on with a dreadful weariness, exhausting the energies of us all. In short, all attempts to absolutize otherness as the Other, whether as woman or as God, whether by men or by women, require disruption, rejection. No one can control where sociocultural expectations will place her or him in relation to the community. No matter. We can assume responsibility for transforming values that destroy life. For women whose identity has been shaped by Christian traditions, whether we remain Christian or leave the tradition, this need not be just one more instance of excessive other-directed ness. Rather, cultivating a steadfast awareness of otherness as constitutive of 21 Some French feminists have used woman's position as other in extremely creative ways. Nevertheless, other feminist theorists, French and American alike, have pointed out serious limitations to this position.

A necessity, not a luxury, a disciplined awareness of otherness as central to identity provides, from my perspective, a first small step toward peace with justice on earth.</page></plain_text>
