Did he or did he not approve those policies which we think of as peculiarly Augustan? He lived, we know, and wrote all his major poems during the principate of Augustus. Yet he ended his life in exile on the outskirts of the Roman Empire as a result of displeasing the princeps not only by his actions but-so he tells us-by his poetry itself.' What we know of his career bears out the impression that he was an independent. Born an hereditary Equestrian, left well off financially, voluntarily relinquishing a political future, he was not obliged, like Horace, Virgil, Propertius and Tibullus, to depend upon a patron.2 This independence can be seen clearly in the Ars Amatoria: no 'friend' of Maecenas would have written such a poem. Yet in the end, even before the stern decree of Augustus, we find him writing a tribute in epic style to the victor of Actium and this tribute is the finale of Ovid's greatest work, the Meta- morphoses. Is this merely conventional panegyric or is it evidence of a new attitude toward Augustus and Augustanism in the author of the Art of Love? The general answer, so far as I can see, has been that Ovid in the Metamorphoses was primarily only a smooth narrative poet and that, so far as the ensemble is concerned, it is at best I There can be no doubt that the Ars Amatoria was a real cause (if not the principal cause) of Ovid's religatio. (Cf. S. G. Owen, P. Ovidi etc. Tristium Liber II [Oxford, Clarendon, 1924], 1-47.) It is difficult to believe that Ovid would have dwelt on the subject through practically all the 578 lines of Tristia ii, if it were not really a charge of importance. 2 Cf. A. L. Wheeler, "Topics from Ovid's Life," A.J.P. XLVI (1925), lf.</page><page sequence="2">Vol. lxix] Ovid and the Augustans 189 derived from an Alexandrine potpourri and at worst from a mythological handbook.3 To such a school of criticism the patriotic finale would be nothing more than convention de- manded,-to be taken no more seriously than, for example, Lucan's panegyric of Nero in the Pharsalia. To such critics Ovid is neither an Augustan nor a non-Augustan. He is at worst a good rhetorician, at best a good narrator who simply wrote what he pleased without reference to anything more than the demands of literary form.4 A slight variant of this view is that of the late Professor Martini.5 He holds Leo's old theory of the origin of Roman elegy 6 and conceives of all the Augustan elegists simply as Hellenistic Romans who are continuing the Alexandrinism of Catullus and the neoterici. Ovid alone had the literary facility and tenacity to go on from the shorter elegies and epyllia to the longer Alexandrine poems,-the potpourris of Callimachus and Nikander or, as Martini aptly calls them, the "Kollektivgedichte". In this respect Ovid has the dis- tinction of being in Martini's phrase "der Vollender der neoterischen Bestrebungen ". This interpretation is not so convincing if we reject Leo's theory of the origin of Roman 3 The considerable literature on this topic is for the most part cited in Schanz- Hosius, Geschichte der Romischen Literatur (Miinchen, Beck, 1935), ii.240-241. 4 Roughly speaking this is essentially the view of Martin Schanz, Geschichte der R6mischen Literatur (Muinchen, Beck, 1911), ii.348: "Es ist kein Zweifel Ovid is der genialste Erzahler der Romer, aber er ist auch der, welche die Rhetorik in die Poesie eingefilhrt, und diese dadurch auf einen bedauernswerten Abweg gebracht hat."

Martini believed he had new proof of Leo's theory,-particularly in regard to Euphorion. This is based on his interpretation of Virgil's tenth eclogue (vs. 50). Chalcidic verse (i.e. Euphorion's verse) must, Martini thinks, be subjective amatory elegy. All this hinges on the identity of the pastor Siculus (vs. 51). Is he Polyphemus or Theocritus? But even if he is Polyphemus, as Martini believed, I fail to see why the condita versu Chalcidico carmina must be Gallus' elegies to Lycoris. Gallus wrote other poems that might be referred to here.</page><page sequence="3">190 Brooks Otis [1938 elegy.7 As long as we assume that all the elements of Roman poetry which we cannot parallel in extant Hellenic or Hellen- istic texts must be found in lost Hellenic or Hellenistic texts, we can prove a great deal and possibly a great deal too much. Fortunately recent studies of Catullus and Roman elegy have, as we shall see, considerably altered our approach to this question.8 The only way of determining what Ovid or any other Roman poet did with Greek material is to compare the Roman treat- ment with the Greek original, not only in respect to subject matter and details of factual content, but also in respect to style, tone, language, and mood. While a series of studies has been devoted to certain myths of the Metamorphoses, they are mostly of the rather uninspired Quellenforschung variety.9 General works on the poem, such as those of Lafaye 1' and Castiglioni," are in the main derived from the axiom that Ovid is to be explained almost entirely in terms of Alexandrine sources. One knew what to look for and found it. The first really illuminating treatment of the problem was that of Richard Heinze in his epoch-making paper on Ovid's elegiac narrative.12 Hein-ze realized and showed that Ovid was not in any sense a blind imitator and that he frequently altered his sources to suit his literary purposes. More fundamentally, Heinze proved beyond any doubt the great divergence in narrative style between the Ovid of the Fasti and the Ovid of 7 Cf. infra p. 194f. 8 Cf. infra p. 195f. 9 Cf. Hosius, op. cit. (see note 3), 241 for a list of such works. 10 G. Lafaye, Les Metamorphoses d'Ovide et leurs mod'les grecs (Bibliotheque de la Facult6 des lettres de Paris xix, Paris, 1904). 11 L. Castiglioni, Studi intorno alle fonte e alla composizione della Metamorfosi (Pisa, 1906). Both Lafaye and Castiglioni admit some originality in Ovid but their method and results in effect belie the admission. The first serious attempt so far to demonstrate a real Ovidian 'epische Technik' is that of Rohde (see note 13), whose thesis appeared twenty-three years after Castiglioni's work cited above. This is no accident. 12 Richard Heinze, Ovids elegische Erzahlung (Berichte der Sachs. Akad., Phil. Hist. Klasse, 71, Heft 7, 1919).</page><page sequence="4">Vol. lxix] Ovid and the Augustans 191 the Metamorphoses. This he supposed to be due to the exist- ence of two types of narrative style-the epic and elegiac- each going back to Alexandrine or pre-Alexandrine times."3 The tests for elegiac and epic narrative,14 which Heinze laid down, have not proved adequate in all cases. -Rohde, for example, believes that the style of the Metamorphoses is not precisely uniform and is not, as Heinze supposed, Virgilian 15 or early Epylliac. Nor is it, as Heinze also supposed, devoted always to the 8etv0'v as opposed to the eXEELv6v; 16 there is Ovid's playfulness or 7ratyvX5Es, as Rohde calls it, which is by no means unapparent in the Metamorphoses. Nevertheless- while doubt must be cast on the strictly genre character of the distinction between the two styles-the essential distinc- tion between Ovid's elegiac narrative and that of the Meta- 13 Heinze supposed that the elegiac narrative had influenced the narrative of later epyllion. Ovid, according to him, followed in the Metamorphoses the earlier (i.e. Theocritus, Moschos) not the later (Catullus 64, Aristaeus episode in Fourth Georgic, etc.) style of epyllion. But cf. A. Rohde, De Ovidi Arte Epica (Berlin, Ebering, 1929), 29: neque vero eorum carminum genus narrandi Ovidius sequitur, quae viri docti huius aetatis dicere consueverunt epyllia. 14 According to Heinze, the marks of the genres are as follows: in the elegiac narrative, the Gods are seldom seriously treated; the element of &amp;Xeebov or sentimental pity is dominant; war is generally absent; the stories are asym- metrically related, i.e. the central point is always an emotional 'moment' and the events leading up to or coming after this moment are often asym- metrically curtailed; the writer often intrudes himself into the narrative; short dialogue is more frequent than long speeches; the style is less noble than that of epic. In epic, on the contrary, the Gods have their due solemnity; the prevailing tone is awe (Betv6); the narrative is symmetrical; the writer does not intrude; long speeches are more usual than short dialogue; and the style is ennobled with epithets, circumlocutions, etc. 15 Cf. Rohde, op. cit. (see note 13), 29: id autem quo excellit Vergilius in Aeneide, r4 i)os, paene totum deest [i.e. in Met.]. 16 In fact exception to most of HIeinze's criteria can be found. Cf. Rohde, op. cit. (see note 13), passim, and Martini, op. cit. (see note 5), 187, note 61. Martini notes that the postulated epic U4T,6rjs is not always maintained. He ascribes this in some cases to Ovid's model being in the elegiac or later epylliac manner. But it is precisely such non-epic passages that seem most 'Ovidian'. Surely Rohde's explanation is better here (op. cit., 29): narrandi genus est epicum, dicendi Ovidianum. haec ipsa sunt quae excitant admirationem, levitas et cum gratia delectatio atque iucunditas.</page><page sequence="5">192 Brooks Otis [1938 morphoses holds water. Furthermore recent studies-such as that of Renz "7-show that even the myths in the Ars Ammatoria are types of elegiac narrative as Heinze defined it. But the distinction between elegiac and epic narrative in Ovid is only a rather oblique aspect of an even more funda- mental distinction,-the distinction between his pre-occupa- tion as a writer of elegy and the vastly diverse notion of myth and life itself that appears in the Metamorphoses. The distinction between Fasti and Metamorphoses is itself less significant than the distinction between all Ovid's early elegies and the Metamorphoses."8 For essentially the Ovid of the Fasti is the Ovid of the Amores and Ars Amatoria.19 The patriotic subject-the Roman calendar-is almost ob- scured by the jocose and semi-humorous, semi-sentimental treatment. But the Metamorphoses is-as Heinze declares- epic in the main. It shows a seriousness which we are quite unprepared for by the elegies. Is all this a matter of change of genre? Or did Ovid really set out to write epic? Or if this is so, is he following a prior epic which is also an Alex- andrian 'Kollektivgedicht'?? I believe that we can in one sense answer this last question with a rather emphatic negative. The principles of Calli- machus forbade any repetition of Apollonius' effort even in the form of a loosely knit collection of myths. To be sure, the question of exactly how epic the early epyllion was is a vexed one. And if indeed we assume that Ovid was epic only 17 H. Renz, Mythologische Beispiele in Ovids erotischen Elegie (Diss. Ttibingen, Wurzburg, 1935). Renz takes three myths from the Ars Amatoria (Daedalus, Mars and Venus, Cephalus and Procris) and compares them with the same myths in the Metamorphoses, thus bringing out the differences between elegiac and epic narrative. His results confirm Heinze pretty well. 18 Of course for Martini it was very simple (cf. op. cit. [see note 51, 183). Ovid, as the fulfiller of the neoteric tradition, simply wanted to write both types, of 'Kollektivgedichte'-the elegiac (Fasti) and the epic (Metamorphoses). That, however, does not explain the differences between the Metamorphoses and the Hellenistic poems we know, such as the A-rLa, the Ornithogonia of Boios and Macer, etc. Cf. infra p. 219f. 19 Cf. infra, note 82.</page><page sequence="6">Vol. lxix] Ovid and the Augustans 193 in each separate episode, we might easily account for the epic mannerisms by tracing them back to so many epic epyllia. But the judgment of such an attempt must finally depend on our conclusion as to the unity of subject, mood and intent in the poem as a whole, that is to say on our decision as to whether it really is a collection or not. I may anticipate my argument here by saying that I do not believe it is simply a collection. But we must first examine Ovid's career as an elegist in order to see what he was before he wrote the Metamorphoses and so what he had in mind when he finally came to write it. Ovid after all was the contemporary not only of Tibullus and Propertius but of Virgil and Horace. The presumption that his development is at least partially explicable in terms of his relation to contemporary elegists and contemporary writers of epic (to say nothing of the policy and attitude of Augustus himself) is at least as probable on the face of it as the pre- sumption that he was a neoteric born out of his time or a characterless rhetorician entirely dependent on Alexandrian models. He himself in his long letter to Augustus from Tomis declares that the Metamorphoses was inspired by his emperor and speaks of the lines wherein he traces the sequence of events from chaos to Augustus' own time. Is this mere eye- wash for Augustus? Or is it true that the poet of the Ars had become an Augustan in the Metamorphoses? It is at least reasonable to assume that the official unpopularity of the Ars was no sudden event, originating only after Ovid's fatal " error ". The possibility then is that the Metamorphoses may be a deliberate attempt on the part of the poet to improve his standing with Augustus. But even if the Metamorphoses is then in a sense a patriotic epic, it is very certainly different in purpose and design from the Aeneid. Is there any clue in Ovid's elegy to this purpose and design? Only when we have answered this question can we determine the significance of the epic style of the Metamorphoses.</page><page sequence="7">194 Brooks Otis [1938 II If it is difficult to determine why Ovid turned from elegy to his own brand of epic, it is in one sense very easy to explain the sequence and raison d'etre of his elegiac poems. He was quite consciously in the elegiac tradition-the tradition of Gallus, Tibullus and Propertius. It is not difficult to see how the Ars Amatoria, Amores, Fasti, and Heroides all come from hints or promises in the corpus of his and his predecessors' amatory elegy.20 Ovid presumably was satisfied with elegy as long as he found it adequate to his purpose. The presumption of this article is that a change in purpose-and only a change in purpose- dictated the change in genre. It is necessary first, however, to determine what Ovid's original purpose was, that is to say what he did, in the main, with the elegiac tradition that he received. The elegiac tradition, as Ovid inherited it from Gallus, Tibullus and Propertius, was a curious concatenation of per- sonal feeling and conventional motif. It is not, therefore, remarkable that its origin has been the subject of immense scholarly dispute.21 The attempt to prove the existence of 20 The Ars Amatoria is only an expansion of the didacticism which is a definite component element of Roman Elegy. See p. 204 below. The Fasti were perhaps suggested by Propertius (himself beholden to Callimachus' ArTLa) who proposed something almost but not exactly similar: sacra diesque canam et cognomina prisca locorum ('v.1.69). Ovid himself had written in the Amores about a festival of Juno at Falerii (nio.13). The bare form of the Heroides may have been suggested by Propertius' Arethusa letter (iv.3). But see, for a comparison of this with Ovid, Erich Reitzenstein, "Wirklichkeitsbild und Gefiihlentwicklung bei Properz," Philologus, Supplementband XXIX, Heft 2 (1936). Actually, Ovid is not doing the same thing that Propertius did. When all is said and done, there is truth in his own boast: ignotum hoc aliis ille novavit opus (Ars. 3.346). 21 The bibliography of the question can be found in Hosius, op. cit. (see note 3), 167-8. For a most convenient summary of the matter up to 1913 see K. F. Smith, The Elegies of Tibullus (N. Y., Am. Book Co., 1913), 23, 24. The most important works on the subject are those of Leo (Plautinische Forschungen, Ed. 2, 1912, 143f), Jacoby ("Zur Enstehung der Romischen Elegie," Rhein. Mus. LX, 38-105), and R. Reitzenstein, Epigramm und Skolion. The view taken</page><page sequence="8">Vol. lxix] Ovid and the Augustans 195 actual Alexandrian elegies written for actual girls and de- scribing subjectively the course of an actual amour has not been successful.22 So far as we can tell the Alexandrine elegists, while familiar enough with the sermo amatorius and the stock episodes of amatory convention, did not employ the subjective tone and the emotional reference of a Catullus or Propertius.23 Yet a Catullus and Propertius were, neverthe- less, very greatly influenced by Alexandrine epigram and epyllion; so the theory that Roman elegy arose via Alexandrine epigram through the primary agency of Catullus and his circle seems to have much to recommend it.24 We can at least in crucial instances observe how Catullus transferred the rather cold and objective amatory epigrams of the Palatine Anthology into poems that are personal, subjective, and in- tense.25 The odi et amo is of course the classic instance here. Nor is it difficult to see how these epigrams can, under the right circumstances, become the larger and typical elegies. It is clear, however, that Propertius, Tibullus, and-inferen- tially-Gallus went considerably beyond the Catullan elegy and have, in fact, combined the subjective poem to one lady with the mass of traditional amatory r6oot which appear not only in epigram but in the New Comedy as well. It is this situation which, as we all know, led Leo to his hypothesis of a prior Alexandrine elegy that had already mixed amatory sub- here is essentially that of Wilamowitz (Hellenistische Dichtung) with some slight modifications suggested by 0. Weinreich (Die Distichen des Catull, 1926) and A. L. Wheeler ("Catullus as an Elegist," A.J.P. xxxvi [1915], 155f). See below p. 196. 22 Cf. note 21 above. 22 Cf. Wilamowitz, op. cit. (see note 21), i.232 and especially his conclusion: "Noch war irgendeiner der griechischen Poeten imstande, so uiber seine inneren Gefuihle zu reflektieren-oder zu reden, wie es die Romer tun, und ware es gewesen, so wuirde er es nicht gewollt haben." 24 Cf. Wilamowitz, op. cit. (see note 21), i.239-243 and R. Reitzenstein, op. cit. (see note 21), as well as Pauly-Wissowa-Kroll, R. E., "Epigramm," vi.71-111. For Catullus, see WVheeler, op. cit. (see note 21), and Weinreich, op. cit. (see note 21). 25 Especially important in this connection is Weinreich's discussion (see Weinreich, op. cit. [see note 211, especially 75f) of Catullus' odi et amo.</page><page sequence="9">196 Brooks Otis [1938 jectivism with the love machinery of the New Comedy.26 This hypothesis however was early countered by Wheeler 27 and others who assumed that Gallus and his successors could themselves have gone to the New Comedy. This, it seems to me, is not, as some suppose, an argument for Gallus' originality but rather for his lack of it. He wished to follow Catullus and write elegies about his love for Lycoris, but he could scarcely keep up the strain of personal emotion through- out a long series of elegies. As a result, he had recourse to conventional themes of epigram and of New Comedy, and founded in this limited sense a new genre. This genre, however, was anything but easy to perpetuate. There existed too great a discrepancy between the actually subjective and the conventionally imitative elements. In Catullus the fusion is perfect; in Tibullus and Propertius the gap is wide and obvious.28 It is for me very difficult to imagine that such an unnatural welding of actual and con- ventional love in one art form can have had or could have expected a long history. Even in Lucretius' time, the typical stage lover was 'funny'. But a lover writing about himself can of all people least afford to be 'funny'. Humor is not forbidden, but its r8le must be strictly limited. Tibullus and Propertius at any rate manage to maintain more or less successfully the balance between the conventional and the personal elements in amatory elegy. But with each new writer in the genre the problem would become progressively serious as the possible solutions of it were exhausted. There remained, of course, in this as in other genres the final solution: 26 Cf. Leo, op. cit. (see note 21), 143f. 27A. L. WVheeler, "Erotic Teaching in Roman Elegy and Greek Sources," C.P. v (1910), 440f, and VI (1911), 56f. 28 Typical is Tibullus I.2. It starts out as a conventional lover's plaint. The poet demands wine to put him to sleep so that he can forget his woes,-the closed door (there is a long address to the door), the Lady's timidity, the tattle- tale, the husband, etc. But all this eventually leads up to a characteristically Tibullan pastoral: the poet envisages himself with Delia in the country. The transition, in one sense, is well managed, but the gap between the traditional and the personal themes of Tibullus is very obvious.</page><page sequence="10">Vol. lxix] Ovid and the Augustans 197 namely reductio ad absurdum, the Don Quixote or the Vision of Judgment. Here, naturally, the very faults and discrepancies of the genre are only so many advantages to the author. But here, also, the success of the attempt depends upon the degree to which the genre is ripe for such treatment as well as upon the existence of a rather new kind of audience sufficiently different from the audience of the older writers in the genre to appreciate a travesty of it. The degree of outspokenness in the travesty will also correspond to the importance of these several factors. So in my opinion is to be explained the motivation of Ovid's amatory elegy. It is in essence a reductio ad absurdum of the genre as exhibited by Gallus, Tibullus and Propertius.2" But 29 The essence of this reductio ad absurdum is the jocose handling of the stock themes. Thus the door theme is ridiculed in Amores i.6 (cf. Propertius i.16) with the humorous introduction (11. 11-13) and the elaborate refrain. Note the comic exaggeration of the 'scratching' poem (i.7) as contrasted with the sober treatment of Tibullus (i.10) and Propertius (ii.5.25); the triumph (x.7.35f) in Ovid's poem is a capital instance of his humorous bombast. Similarly compare i.14 (Corinna's hair-dyeing) with Prop. ii.18.25. In Amores ii.19.37f, Ovid is clearly imitating Tibullus ii.6.15-39. But Tibullus is telling the husband on account of his jealous fear of another rival; Ovid, because his (the husband's) laxness spoils the fun. E. K. Rand, "Ovid and the Spirit of Metamorphosis," in Harvard Essays on Classical Subjects (Cambridge, Harvard Press, 1912), 217, supposes that Ovid took the hint for this sort of humor from Horace. But I find it difficult to trace Horace in Ovid's humor. To be sure Ovid probably imitated Horace's "Art of Inheriting Money" (Ser. II.5) in the Ars Amatoria (ii.178, 210, 231, 263, etc.). But this kind of parody and humor (cf. Tibullus i.4.35-52) is not a monopoly of Horace; Ovid's imitation was almost inevitably suggested by the similarity of theme. I would agree with Rand that both Horace and Ovid " laugh at the third person in the guise of the first" (Rand, op. cit., 217) but the emphasis on the "first person" in question and the quality of the laughter are very different. Ovid in the Amores is not himself but the stock amatorial 'ego' who is as much and as fictitious a part of the burlesque of the amatory machinery as Corinna herself. Horace, on the other hand, by 'ego' always means himself, even when he is laughing at his "own" absurdities. He mocks others who are equally absurd in action by showing that he does not-like them-take such actions seriously. Thus in the eleventh epode (which Rand cites in this connection) Horace declares roundly: Heu me, per urbem (nam pudet tanti mali) fabula quanta fui I The subject of fui here is very Horatian. In addition to such considerations, it is important to view the problem in the light of Qvid's entire reaction to Horace</page><page sequence="11">198 Brooks Otis [1938 it is not an absolutely barefaced travesty; there is enough indirection and misleading seriousness to deceive the imper- ceptive. Let us note briefly the means by which Ovid pro- duced this effect in the Amores. I. The Girl Obviously, if the attempt is to succeed, Ovid must have a girl to write about. It is hardly necessary to argue here at length that Ovid was not the man to have a 'grande passion '.30 But the pretense that he had his equivalent of a Lycoris, Delia, or Cynthia was essential to the genre. The pretense, however, is so skillfully mingled with the stock amatory machinery that the discerning reader can have no doubt but that Corinna is a comic fiction. All this appears clearly in the two introductory poems.3' Ovid's writing of elegy is due to a trick of Cupid who steals the last foot of the second line of what was to be an epic (like the Aeneid).32 The poor poet is then doomed to write of love; but he is not in love, as he remonstrates. Cupid then lets fly with the arrow and Corinna gets her lover! The second elegy 33 re-inforces this tone of the first: Ovid-in bed-wonders whether he's in love or not. He decides he is and gives up completely to Cupid, so as, he hopes, to escape with a lighter sentence. The whole tone of light irony and mock heroic is quite unmistakable. And the Corinna thus conveniently supplied is equally a part of the jest. Throughout the poems she is obviously a lay-figure and his work (cf. note 74). Rand's essay, however, is historically of crucial importance as one of the first to set forth clearly the real purpose of the Amores, a purpose greatly obscured by the Romantic criticism of the 19th Century. This criticism has unfortunately limited the interpretative value of such an otherwise excellent work as R. Neumann's Qua Ratione Ovidius in Amoribus Scribendis Properti elegiis usus sit (Gbttingen, 1909). Neumann fails to per- ceive the scope of Ovid's burlesque although he is aware of it in specific instances (Neumann, op. cit., 124). Reitzenstein (see note 35) has gone considerably beyond Neumann especially in the comparison of Propertius ii.1 and Ovid 1.1. 30 Cf. Tristia iv.10.65: molle Cupidineis nec inexpugnabile telis cor mihi. 31 Amores I.1 and I.2. 32 Cf. Amores i.1.1: Arma gravi numero violentaque bella parabam. 'Arma virumque cano' is suggested. 33Amores iI.2.</page><page sequence="12">Vol. lxix] Ovid and the Augustans 199 with no perceptible individuality whatsoever.34 That is as Ovid intended, for, only by selecting such a figure, could he achieve his desired effect. II. Ovid's Conception of Love Ovid's conception of love in the Amores is a development of that of his predecessors, but it is a development which alters the whole tone of the love episodes. To Tibullus and Proper- tius, love was, officially speaking, an inglorious affair-at worst desidia or nequitia-justified by the plea that there was no alternative to the yoke of the tyrant, love.35 In Tibullus there is at times a frank and explicit longing for peace and " inglorious ease" especially of the pastoral variety.36 Proper- 34Cf. Fasti iv.5: 'scis, dea,' respondi 'de volnere I' The jocose tone here is hardly consistent with a real volnus. 35 In this connection cf. especially, E. Reitzenstein, "Das neue Kunstwollen in den Amores Ovids," Rhein. Mus. LXXXIV (1935), 62f. Reitzenstein defines nequitia thus: "sich aus dem Gemeinschaftsbewusstsein loszulosen, ganz auf das eigene Ich zuruckzuziehen." Love, a form of this, is excused by- Tibullus and Propertius according to R., by the pretense that it is servitium to love, the tyrant. Ovid's Eros, on the contrary, is a sportive boy. (Cf. Amores i.1 and Propertius II.1.) In general the Amores, like Callimachus' elegies, reveal " menschlichrealistischen zulge" rather than a "feierliche Pathos". In this respect, says R., Ovid's Amores are like "eine leise Parodie auf den elegischen Stil seiner Vorganger." All this I would accept with some reservations only as to the seriousness of Propertius' servitium. These points are by no means original with Reitzenstein; cf. Rand, op. cit. (see note 29), and especially T. F. Higham, "Ovid: Some Aspects of His Character and Aims," C.R. xLviII (1934), 105f. Higham has-following Rand-quite justifiably protested against the usual (see note 4 above) interpretation of Ovid. While I find it difficult to assent completely to his notion of a literary "feud" between Horace and the elegists (cf. below note 74), his explanation of Ovid's 'bad boy' reaction (op. cit., 113) to the official disapproval of elegy (i.e. Ovid's glorification of nequitia) is very well done and quite in line with Reitzenstein. It is certainly a sign of the new trend in Ovidian criticism that two independently written criticisms such as those of Higham and Reitzenstein should appear in successive years. Nequitia does not actually occur in Tibullus; it occurs seven times in Propertius (i.15.38; iI.6.30; II.24.6; iii.10.24; iii.19.10; I.6.26; II.5.2). In five of these instances the sense is bad, i.e. equivalent to licentiousness. But in two instances (i.6.26; iii.10.24) he applies nequitia to his own love for Cynthia. But even here the attitude is definitely apologetic; he is far from glorying in nequitia as Ovid does. 36E.g. .I10.</page><page sequence="13">200 Brooks Otis [1938 tius, however, is quite aware that war or politics is a more noble activity than love, and that his "dura puella" is in this respect a hard " fatum" that condemns him to obscurity.37 Ovid, on the contrary, absolutely glories in his "nequitia": Ille ego nequitiae Naso poeta meae.38 The pretense that love is a hard tyrant dooming him to an amatory career he cannot escape is repeated with a jaunty nonchalance which really transforms the 'excuse' into an impudent statement of personal preference.39 Equally clear and equally impudent is Ovid's treatment of desidia, which to the patriotic Roman was pre- sumably descriptive of an amatory career.40 Ovid, in one 41 of his Amores, applies the typical military metaphor to love; we find the metaphor in Tibullus and Propertius,42 the lover as a soldier in the camp of Venus. But Ovid turns the metaphor into a shrewd hit at the Roman patriot. "Stop calling love desidia," he declares. It is rather the active use of one's ability and is in fact the antidote to desidia: Qui nolet fieri desidiosus amet.43 The fact here is plain: Ovid is blithely stripping the tatters from the conventional apologetic of Propertius and Tibullus. He refuses to keep up the continual pretense of deference to the writer of military epic or the patron of patriotic mind. Thus in Ii.1 he develops two lines of Tibullus 44 into a skillful 37See ii.1.78: Huic misero fatum dura puella fuit. The whole poem is an apology to Maecenas for not writing epic. Cf. infra p. 201. 38 Amores Ii.1.2. 39Amores ii.1.3: Hoc quoque iussit amor-and I.2.19-20: En ego confiteor: tua sum nova praeda, Cupido; Porrigimus victas ad tua iura manus. Nil opus est bello, etc. When Ovid once gives himself up to love he goes-with comical completeness-the whole way toward nequitia. Mens Bona and Pudor are led bound and captive in Love's triumph while Error, Furor, and Blanditiae are love's comites (i.2.3 If) . 40 Cf. especially Amores I.9, passim. 41 I.9. 42 Cf.

The Ovidian lines (ii.1.15) are:</page><page sequence="14">Vol. lxix] Ovid and the Augustans 201 piece of parody. But this is not all. It is at the same time a shrewd comment on a similar apology-for not writing patriotic epic-of Propertius to Maecenas (ii.1). Propertius had declared that, if he could write epic, it would not be any mythological tale-a gigantomachy for example-but the actual wars of Maecenas and Augustus.4" Ovid pictures him- self as actually writing a gigantomachy 46 when suddenly his mistress' door is banged in his face: Clausit amica fores: ego cum love fulmen amisi. (Incidentally I would hardly be inclined to call this passage evidence for a gigantomachy.47) Elsewhere in Ovid's accounts of his poetic career, the same lack of tenderness toward the conventional apologetic for amatory poetry is unmistakably evident. In one poem,48 In manibus nimbos et cum Iove fulmen habebam. Quod bene pro caelo mitteret ille suo; Clausit amica fores: ego cum Iove fulmen omisi. Excidit ingenio Iuppiter ipse meo. 45 Cf. I1. 17-2 6. 46 Amores ii.1.1l-18. 47 It seems to me obvious that this is (1) a reminiscence of the traditional 'apologetic' of elegists or non-epic poets for not writing epic and (2) a reminis- cence of Propertius ii.1 (as well as Tibullus II.6). Ovid-unlike Propertius- claims to be about to write a gigantomachy because the contrast between Jupiter and Corinna is the sort of comic incongruity he likes and because he obviously does not want to contrast Augustus and Corinna. Nor can I see any evidence in Tristia ii.61-76 and 331-338 that Ovid actually wrote a gigantomachy. If we believe Ovid to be serious here in Amores ii.1, why not believe Horace is serious in Carmina iii.25.4f, when he declares himself about to sing the glories ot Augustus? Owen (op. cit. [see note 1], 63) has collected together most of the evidence for the traditional view, but cf. on this point E. Reitzenstein, Das Neue Kunstwollen, etc. (see note 35), 87. 48 ii.18. This is in all probability later than most of the Amores and was written especially for the second (three book) edition after the publication both of the single epistles (Heroides I-xv) and the Ars, as that, in my opinion, is what 'artes Amoris' (1. 19) refers to. The order of Ovid's work assumed here (I hope later to publish a specific defense of it) is: Amores (five book edition); Heroides (except double epistles) and (almost exactly simultaneously) Medea; Ars Amatoria; Remedia; Double Epistles; Amores (three book edition). The element of direct parody probably increased with Ovid's literary develop- ment. This poem (ii.18) is considerably later than iii.1 (written when Ovid was much concerned with tragedy, but written after the first edition of the Amores). Needless to say the order of Ovid's work here indicated involves the rejection in toto of Pohlenz's suppositions in regard to the Metamorphoses (i.e.</page><page sequence="15">202 Brooks Otis [1938 Ovid excuses himself to his friend Macer-the writer of epic- for writing of love rather than of tragedy; and in another 49 he makes the Goddesses Tragedy and Elegy debate the matter for him. In the first, the poet urges Corinna to get out of his lap and she refuses. In the other, Elegy pleads 50 elo- quently with Tragedy to give the poet just a little more time. For all Tragedy's fine airs, Elegy claims she has accomplished more. Venus without Elegy would be a country wench. She, in short, is Venus' lena: Huic ego proveni lena comesque deae. This, it would seem, is the most startling admission of all- that elegy is a sort of a lena who teaches her girls how to meet city standards. Its origin is of course clear: the typical lena of New Comedy-already imported into elegy by Tibullus,5' Propertius,52 and Ovid.53 She is generally an old witch who takes the girl aside and (while the jealous and angry lover overhears) gives her a lecture on what we would call 'gold digging . Ovid's lena poem is clearly an imitation of Pro- pertius' but there are significant differences-not primarily due, I think, as some 55 have suggested, to Ovid's greater that its composition was contemporary with that of the Ars and Heroides 16-21). Cf. M. Pohlenz, "Die Abfassungszeit von Ovids Metamorphoses," Hermes xLviII (1913), If and De Ovidi Carminibus Amatoriis (Gottingen, 1913). Space does not permit me here to express more than disagreement with the views of R. S. Radford (see citations in Hosius, op. cit. [see note 3], 211). I am not con- vinced by the reasoning of F. W. Lenz (" Ceresfest, Eine Studie zu Amores Ill. 1O, " St. It. Fil. x [1932-3], 299) that Amores iii.6, 10, 13 are late poems introduced only in the second edition of the Amores. 49 A mores iiI. 1. 50 III.I. 51 Tibullus I.5. 62 Propertius iv.5. 53 Ovid i.8. 54 For the influence of New Comedy here see A.

Wheeler comes to the conclusion, in opposition to that of Leo and his school, that the Roman elegists themselves took this motif from the New Comedy. 56 R. Neumann, op. cit.

Neumann,</page><page sequence="16">Vol. lxix] Ovid and the Augustans 203 dependence on the New Comedy. The chief difference, in- deed, is that Ovid's poem is gay and humorous from end to end, whereas Propertius' is, at best, a somewhat frigid exer- cise.56 It is noteworthy that Propertius placed it among his later poems in the Fourth Book and that it apparently in no way involves Cynthia, whereas Ovid, in his poem, indicates clearly that it is he and his Corinna who are persons in the drama.57 But the chief point of interest here is the lena's advice; it is, in fact, the usual Ovidian amatory doctrine. "Once," declares the lena,58 "the dirty Sabine women didn't know how to make use of several lovers. But now Mars is waging his wars abroad while Venus reigns here in her own city of Rome. That is why pretty maids spend their time playing; for the Chaste are just those who don't get asked. As a matter of fact-if you're not too uncivilized, you'll do the asking yourself." All this is not in Propertius but it is Ovid to the life. It is indeed the doctrine of Ars Amatoria, Book III. Ovid, in fact, is the lena and the dramatic device is only a trick. Perhaps then we can see why he allows Elegy to call herself by that title. Love, to Ovid, is not a personal passion at all, but a self- confessed indulgence in nequitia according to the rules of this nequitia's mistress, the lena. The old elegiac convention of the girl who succumbs to the rich lover and cuts the poor poet because of insidious advice on 'gold digging', is subtly supplanted by the concept of the rustica or simple-minded 'country girl' who learns the ropes and thus attains cultus. however, does not consider sufficiently the reason why Ovid needed a more dramatic setting than Propertius: Ovid wanted to make the subject a part of his fictitious amour; Propertius merely treated the topic separately and without reference to his personal relations with Cynthia. It is not necessary to make too much of the influence of Most. I.3 here. 56 Compare, especially, the endings of the two poems. 57 Cf. supra note 55. 68 Amores i.8.39f: Forsitan inmundae Tatio regnante Sabinae Noluerint habiles pluribus esse viris; Nunc Mars externis animos exercet in armis, At Venus Aeneae regnat in urbe sui. Ludunt formosae: casta est, quam nemo rogavit; aut si rusticitas non vetat, ipsa rogat.</page><page sequence="17">204 Brooks Otis [1938 The transition from the Amores to the Ars Amatoria is thus inevitable: it is not only the transformation of the didacticism of the New Comedy lena into the didacticism of the poet him- self; it is equally a change in the nature of the didacticism it- self. Rusticitas, or simplicity to Tibullus or Propertius, is a virtue which-even if their girls do not possess it-is worthy of possession.59 For sophistication only makes a Delia or a Cynthia take up with some rich parvenu, an ex-soldier, or freedman. But Ovid, while paying lip service to this theme, is really interested in the sophisticate because she is sophis- ticated. This sophistication is far more than skill in the rules of love a la traditional elegy. The ulterior end is not simply possession of the girl or man, but rather the game itself. It is not the love of passion but rather l'amour de coquetterie.60 Thus Ovid, according to tradition, blames the husband for guarding his girl too well. It is not according to Hoyle; the husband only reveals his lack of finesse: rusticus est nimium quem laedit adultera coniunx (iii.4.37). But the lax husband 59 Rusticitas, rusticus and rustica are not used by Tibullus or Propertius in the Ovidian sense of 'unsophisticated' or 'simple'. But both seriously castigate their girls for deception and insincerity. Tibullus' ideal (cf. 1.1) is a life in the country with Delia; he would hardly use rustic in Ovid's bad sense. Cf. Propertius ii.5.25: rusticus haec aliquis tam turpia proelia quaerat cuius non hederae circuiere caput. Rusticus is here equivalent to 'boor'; it has no connotation of 'unskilled in the art of love'. 60 Cf. Andre Maurois, "Le Passe et l'Avenir de l'Amour," in Anthologie des Essayistes FranCais Contemporains (Editions Kra, Paris, 1929), 244f. Says Maurois (p. 250): "Dans une societe tres riche en loisirs et oft l'homme et la femme vivent beaucoup ensemble, se developpent un amour de coquetterie et une facilite de moeurs qui tuent l'amour chevaleresque." And again (p. 251): "Une des grandes causes de la legerete des moeurs c'est l'ennui, qui grandit presque toujours avec la prosperite. Ce fut ce qui arriva au XVIIIe siecle, en France et en Anglet6rre; a Rome au temps d'Ovide, de Juvenal, de Martial. Alors toute la beaute des sentiments de l'amour chevaleresque fait place aux petites ruses de l'amour physique. Elles sont les memes en tous les temps et en tous les pays. Lisez l'Art d'aimer d'Ovide; il est aussi vrai a Londres, a Paris en 1750 ou a New York en 1928." Viewed from this standpoint, Catullus stands for Z'amour-passion, Tibullus and Propertius for l'amour chevaleresque. But the parallel is by no means exact.</page><page sequence="18">Vol. lxix] Ovid and the Augustans 205 also spoils the fun by making the conquest too easy: Quid mihi cum facili, quid cum lenone marito? (ii.19.57). Similarly Ovid makes light of his lady's suspicion that he is carrying on with her maid, and then follows this up with a letter of amorous invitation-to the non-rustic maid in question.6' This, as he explains in the Ars,62 is allowable technique if one sees to it that the maid is kept silent. Unlike the piqued Pro- pertius' and Catullus' frenzied consolation with other girls, it is all a deliberate and jovial proceeding. This whole point of view is in fact a complete reversal of both the elegiac and the normal moral code. Rusticitas is here the great and sole evil.63 Ceres herself, for instance, is complimented in the Amores as non rustica and the point is proved by a recital of her affair with Iasius (iii.10). This is, of course, reduced to a system in the Ars Amatoria. The whole thing is much more of a deliberate parody. It is first of all a parody as to its title which is a reminiscence of the Ars Oratoria with its divisiones into inventio, etc.64 (The inventio is of course Book I, where one learns how to find not the subject of a speech but a mistress.) Of greater importance here, however, are two distinct new developments: (1) Ovid's greater insistence on the special Roman scene and his special audience 65 (the libertinae) and (2) a much more explicit defi- nition of his attitude toward the moral implications of his subject. And it is in these two respects, pre-eminently, that 61 II.8. 62 Ars Amatoria ii.383f. 63 Cf. Ars I.672; iii.127; Ii.566; and Heroides xvii.186, to mention only a few significant passages. 64 Cf. Th. Zielinski, " Marginalien," Philologus LXIV (1905), 16. 65 Cf. Ars i.31-34. These lines are repeated verbatim in Tristia 11.247-250 with, however, the significant change of 'nos Venerem tutam' (Ars I.33) to 'nil nisi legitimum'. This change, as Owen rightly says (op. cit. [see note 1], 162), is intentional. Tristia ii is obviously one long apologetic; the change here and the very fact that Ovid takes care to quote (with this change) the lines of the Ars shows that he is quite aware that the Ars had a wider public than that of the 'libertinae' and their lovers. Ovid, like Horace in Sermones i.2, realized that it was safer to deal with libertinae and especially safer to appear (in a book published under Augustus) to deal with them.</page><page sequence="19">206 Brooks Otis [1938 he distinguishes himself not only from his elegiac predecessors but from the other great Augustans-from Virgil and Horace most of all. First, the Ars Amatoria is far more than a mere recapitula- tion of traditional amatory motifs. In the Amores there is one poem that deals primarily with a Roman subject, the circus.66 In the Ars the Roman locale is always in evidence- not only the circus, but the naval games of Augustus, the porticoes and temples of the city, the forum and the sacrc via.6" But even this is not so important as the fact that the society itself is far less Alexandrian than Roman.68 While there are hints of such Romanization in the Amores, the social background of the Ars is even explicitly national. But the quality of this nationalism is very different from that of the more official Augustan poetry, that of the Georgics and Aeneid for example and of the patriotic odes of Horace. The note of this official poetry is familiar to all: the return to a great golden age in which the ancient Roman virtues, or rather the primitive Italian virtues-conceived primarily as rustic in origin and essence shall flourish once more under the Augustan pax Romana. From the Fourth Eclogue of Virgil and the Sixteenth Epode of Horace to the former's Georgics and the latter's great patriotic lyrics the movement 86 Amores iii.2, iii.13 (the Juno festival at Falerii) is not strictly speaking amatory elegy at all. 67 Cf. especially Ars i.67f, 135f; iii.387, 393, etc. 68 The general background of social intercourse is primarily Roman, cf. i.229f, 565f, 421f and ii.203-208, etc. P. Brandt, P. Ovidi, etc. De Arte Amatoria Libri III, Text und Kommentar (Leipzig, Dieterich, 1902), comments on these and other passages in his notes. In many cases, it is not certain whether the social behavior is specifically Roman or not; it must be remembered that the reader of the Ars is ostensibly dealing with libertinae whose social code would be different from that of the matron. But there can be no doubt what- soever that there was a wide gulf between Greek (Hellenic or Hellenistic) and Roman social convention in respect to woman and her appearance and behavior at various social functions (see L. Friedlander, Roman Life and Manners under the Early Empire, Magnus translation [London, Routledge, 1909] I.238f) and that Ovid's descriptions (with husbands and wives at banquets, etc.) most definitely imply a Roman locale.</page><page sequence="20">Vol. lxix] Ovid and the Augustans 207 deepens in scope and feeling under the impulse of Maecenas and Augustus. It finally reaches Tibullus and his senti- mental pastoral, and Propertius with his contemplated and even attempted Roman aarta. Whatever doubts we may have of the seriousness of Augustus' revival of forgotten rites and buried customs or of his moralistic legislation, there can be little question of the great literary effect of his general policy of patriotic antiquarianism. It is against such a spirit and such a literature that Ovid brings his plea not only for the age as it actually was but for that very aspect of it, the behavior of its women, which was most suspect. In this curious conflict of modernistic and antiquarian nationalisms, there can be little doubt that Ovid knew what he was doing. His attitude toward rusticitas and the love of simple country girls we have already seen. But even in the Amores this is combined with a thinly disguised disapproval of the traditional cant about the superiority of rustic ancestors or the golden age of pastoral simplicity by which this official rusticity was so often symbolized. In this respect the Eighth poem of the Third Book of Amores can bear much scrutiny along with the two similar poems 69 of Tibullus and Propertius that Ovid had in mind when he wrote it. While Ovid, following the elegiac tradition, sings the evil of feminine lust for money and contrasts it with the golden and simple age of Saturn, it is noteworthy that he ends with a dig at the tetricas Sabinas 70 and, most striking of all, ac- tually classes the deification of Caesar as one of those impious deeds of the iron age: it must even reach after heaven:- adfectas caelum quoque. (The reminiscence here of Horace's 69 Cf. Tibullus i.3.35f and especially Propertius ii.13. Tibullus, sick at Phaeacia, is disgusted with travel; this leads him to the golden age when nobody travelled: Quam bene Saturno vivebant rege, priusquam Tellus in longas est patefacta vias ! (35-6). Propertius' poem is a diatribe on girls who take gifts; this leads the poet to describe the purity of the old country life when nobody cared for money (Iii.13.25f). But Ovid-while closely echoing the Propertian theme (combined with that of Tibullus)-is comically resigned to the situation: et (satis est) aliquid pauperis esse sinant I 70 Iji.8.61.</page><page sequence="21">208 Brooks Otis [1938 caelum ipsum petimus is I think quite intentional.7") It is a hit at Augustus himself which is really astounding in its boldness. But in the Ars Ovid passes quite beyond such indirect attacks and declares himself without ambiguity: others may prefer the good old days; his own age suits him.72 More important than this well-known declaration of sentiment, how- ever, is the immediately ensuing qualification and explanation of it. He likes his own age not because of its luxuries and wasteful expenditures (its lust for gold, pearls, marble, and villas built into the sea) but for the cultus which has finally banished the ancestral rusticitas.73 Nor is this simply the casual sentiment of a handbook for girls; it is in substance repeated through the person of the god Janus, in the early part of the First Book of the Fcasti. Money-mad as the age is, he declares, we would not want to go back to our ancestors- despite all our moral talk: laudatmus veteres, sed nostris utimur annis.74 71 Horace Carmina v.3.38. There is much irony in Ovid's reference here (Qua licet, adfectas caelum quoque; templa Quirinus, Liber et Alcides et modo Caesar habent; Am, iii.8.51-2). The new building program of Augustus was doubtless in Ovid's mind; the Quirinus temple was completed in 16 B.c. 72 Ars iii.121-2: Prisca iuvent alios, ego me nunc denique natum Gratulor: haec aetas moribus apta meis. 73 Ibid. 123 ff.: 'non quia nunc terrae lentum subducitur aurum, lectaque diverso litore concha venit, Nec quia decrescunt effosso marmore montes, nec quia caeruleae mole fugantur aquae, sed quia cultus adest, nec nostros mansit in annos Rusticitas priscis illa superstes avis.' 74 Fasti i.191-225. Thus the true position of Ovid can, I think, be under- stood as one of twofold opposition: first, to his elegiac predecessors, Tibullus and Piopertius (as we have seen) and, second, to the 'elder poetic generation' (cf. E. Martini, Einleitung zu Ovid [Prague, Rohrer, 1933], If) of Horace and Virgil. Much of this is briefly stated by R. Heinze, Die Augusteische Kultur (Leipzig, Teubner, 1930), 122-123, i.e. that the "Liebeselegie steht mit ihrer ganz auf das eigene Ich, ganz auf pers6nlichstes Erleben beschrankten Dichtung gar weit ab von dem grossen Zuge der sonst die Zeit beherrscht, etc." but that Tibullus and Propertius 'repented' ("So konnten sie als reuige Sunder gelten") while Ovid not only fully developed his frivolity but systematized it (the Ars) in the work of his full maturity. Higham, op. cit. (see note 35), 11 If, believing Elegy to be offensive to the Romans in two ways ("The emperor . . ., repre-</page><page sequence="22">Vol. lxix] Ovid and the Augustans 209 Those are the words of a man who says what he thinks. The philosophy of cultus is finally opposed to the philosophy of Horatian and Virgilian antiquarianism. Ovid, however, goes further in the Ars than a mere state- ment of his preference for the contemporary scene and the contemporary morals. He perceives that his point of view has much more fundamental implications. In dealing with the hackneyed subject of lovers' vows and the tradition that Jove winks at the violation of them, he introduces his own notion of the function of the Gods and that function's relation to the traditional morality.75 " It is," he says, "expedient for Gods to exist and, as it is expedient, let us assume their existence. Let us continue to offer incense and wine before their ancient altars. For theirs is no retired life of somnolent ease. Therefore do not sin for a God is ever at hand! " Such a rationalistic and utilitarian theology meets us elsewhere in sented the prevailing masculine view . . . based on two assumptions,-first that deep attachment as between man and woman was the exception rather than the rule; and second that in any case private happiness must yield to the claims of public service"), supposes Ovid to be (in respect to the first, assump- tion) "really on the Emperor's side," i.e. his love in the Amores (like Horace's) is only a game and is not serious like the love of Tibullus and Propertius. In respect to assumption 2, Higham admits that Ovid is guilty, for Ovid felt obligated to defend the genre, elegy, against Horace and its other attackers (cf. note 35). But I greatly doubt the reality of this division of the emperor's view into two parts with one of which Ovid agrees while not with the other. Ovid is not at once more and less loyalist than his fellow elegists; Heinze rather is right in saying that Tibullus and Propertius 'repented' while Ovid did not, although Heinze did not fully perceive the difference between Ovid's attitude and that of the other elegists (i.e. Ovid is in effect burlesquing them). Higham, however, rightly brings out the opposition of Horace and Virgil to Ovid, even if he may be wrong in his view of Horace's contempt for elegy and in his inter- pretation of Horace's epistle to Tibullus (i.4). What Ovid really objected to in Horace and Virgil is, as I have said, their artificial and 'inspired' antiquarian- ism-doubtless also their rather lowly origin and rather clamorous patriotism. Higham's suggestion that the Medicamina Faciei Femineae is a parody of the Georgics ("Virgil teaches cultus of the fields, Ovid cultus of the person." Higham, op. cit. 113, note 4) is excellent and helps explain the didactic style of Ovid's poem. Cf. my remarks on cultus, above, p. 208. Is not the Ars Amatoria also more than a little reminiscent of Horace's Ars Poetica? 76 Ars i.637-642.</page><page sequence="23">210 Brooks Otis [1938 the age: it is prefigured by Varro.78 What, however, arrests us here is the strikingly flippant and off-hand manner of its expression. However much Horace and Virgil may have rationalized, after Varro or Poseidonius, their notion of the state divinities, they would without doubt have been horrified at such an expression of the rationalization. Yet Ovid blurts out what is in effect the fact behind the Augustan religiosity. We note, for example in Virgil, the transition from Epicurean- ism to a sense of the value of actual cult practises." For clearly the 'useless' gods of Epicurus-neither noticing man- kind nor needing notice-could not be combined with any active attitude toward the state religion. But in Virgil's own account of this transition, the real significance of the action is veiled in an explicit contrast between the scientific and the agricultural life.78 So it is very important to note that Ovid here in the Ars Amatoria has clearly in mind the famous 'autobiography' of Virgil (in the Second Georgic) to which I have just referred. Furthermore, both Ovid and Virgil here go back to the famous Lucretian description of the Gods.79 The conclusion to be drawn surely is that Ovid is not merely expressing some rationalistic theories of his own but is rather 76 Cf. Augustine De Civitate Dei vI.4: Quod prius exstiterint civitates, deinde ab eis res divinae institutae sint. We know that the Antiquities were written ad Caesarem pontificem (Aug. C.D. vII.35), a dedication which itself indicates the spirit of the work. 77 Georgics ii.475f. 78 Ibid. 483: sin has ne possim naturae accedere partis frigidus obstiterit circum praecordia sanguis, etc. Those lines are obviously not meant to be taken literally. But contrast the Lucretian: subiecit pedibus strepitumque Acherontis avari (492) with the ensuing line fortunatus et ille, deos qui novit agrestes. The following picture of rural simplicity is all in the Augustan program: the revival of the cults is part of the 'return' to the ancient morality. In other words Virgil is rejecting Epicureanism for the same reason that Ovid is. The difference is in the method of statement. 79 Cf. Ars i.639: Nec secura quies illos etc. with Georgics ii.467: at secura quies et nescia fallere vita. Both go back to the Lucretian description of the Gods: apparet divum numen sedesque quietae (De Rerum Natura iii.18f). The Virgilian passage echoes Lucretius here throughout: cf. nec (G. II.463) . . . nec (Ibid. 466) . . . at (467) with Lucretius' neque (iii.19) . . . neque (20) . . . at (25) as well as the rhythm and tone of the two passages.</page><page sequence="24">Vol. lxix] Ovid and the Augustans 211 pulling the screen from the utilitarian kernel of the traditional theology itself-while showing, at least by implication, that he is quite aware of the real attitude of a Virgil himself! The effect of such a piece of audacity is increased by being put in a poem about love in the demi-monde: "In actual fact the lover needn't be too careful of the Gods; still they have their purpose." That is in essence the effect of this passage in its context.80 One may be sure that such a context did not add to the official popularity of the sentiment expressed. Summarizing briefly then, Ovid's elegiac career through the Ars Amatoria is a startling exhibition of independence in an age of imperial patronage and official guidance of men of letters. Not only does he, in effect, travesty the amatory elegiac proper, but he explicitly upholds, against the literary practise of his great contemporaries, the excellence of a way of life that was flatly at variance with that officially encour- aged by Augustus and his ministers.8' It is in this respect, doubtless, that the Ars Amatoria was one of the reasons for Ovid's exile. III If this, then, was Ovid's original concept of elegy, what was there that caused him to change it? A great factor certainly was the official unpopularity of his poems and particularly of the Ars. Poets do not, however, alter their whole notion of poetry on demand. The easiest recourse for an elegiac poet who wanted to write something acceptable to Augustus, was probably just what Propertius proposed and Ovid himself partially -realized in the Fasti. But the Fasti do not seem to have been a subject particularly congenial to Ovid. More important, they do not mark any fundamental change in Ovid's attitude. While ostensibly devoted to the numerous and more or less obsolescent cults so dear to Augustus, they 80 Cf. Ars I.643: Ludite, si sapitis, solas inpune puellas. 81 If is not necessary to assume that Augustus, Maecenas or any other con- temporary of Ovid always practised what they preached. The objection to Ovid was that he preached what he and the Julias practised. Augustus could hardly overlook this in a man of Ovid's literary prominence.</page><page sequence="25">212 Brooks Otis [1938 reveal the same Ovidian horror of rusticitas and the same affection for the modern life of the city.82 Furthermore the literary technique of the Fasti is that of the other elegies- not that of the Metamorphoses.83 Ovid wrote-as his greatest work-an epic not a calendar, and the origins of the epic are to be found primarily in his whole earlier development, not in the abortive Fasti. We have seen that in the Amores and Ars (the same is true of the Remedia which space does not permit us to treat) Ovid wrote what was in essence comedy-whatever particular branch of comedy one prefers to call it. In so far as he dealt with the main lines of his genre, his effort was humorous, critical, and unimpassioned. There are, however, parts of the Amores and especially of the Ars which reveal quite another spirit: these are the occasional myths-the stories of Pasiphae, Daedalus and Icarus, Cephalus and Procris, Ariadne and 82 Ovid states his point of view right at the beginning of the Fasti (i.225): laudamus veteres sed nostris utimur annis. The same attitude toward rusticitas is maintained. Ariadne (Fasti iii.463) exclaims: Quid flebam rustica? and in general reasons like the non-rustic she is (cf. 493: ut puto, praeposita est fuscae mihi candida paelex, etc.). All this, however, is for obvious reasons not as prominent as in the Amores and Ars. In general the stories of the Fasti corre- spond to Heinze's criteria for elegiac narrative (cf. note 14). What is, however. of somewhat greater significance is that the Fasti-even in comparison with the Heroides and myths of the Ars-seem distinctly jocose in tone. Cf. the account of the rape of the Sabines (iii.171f), the later encounter of Dido and Aeneas (where Aeneas' pietas is cleverly mocked in iii.601, 629), and the erotic adven- ture of Pan (ii.305f). But the general mood is best illustrated at the beginning of Book IV, where Venus and the poet hold a free and easy conversation: 'Alma, fave,' dixi 'geminorum mater Amorum.' Ad vatem voltus rettulit illa suos; 'quid tibi' ait 'mecum? certe maiora canebas. Num vetus in molli pectore volnus habes? ' 'Scis, dea,' respondi 'de volnere !' Risit, et aether protinus ex illa parte serenus erat. Ovid's verve, however, seems lost in the Fasti; it is a success neither as a tribute to Augustus nor as a piece of 'Ovidian' elegy. The serious Roman episodes (e.g. the Lucretia story) are painful copies of Livy. 83 Heinze (op. cit. [see note 12]) makes this clear. He makes or implies, however, too great a distinction between elegiac narrative and elegy that is not narrative. With the very significant exceptions to be noted, Ovid's elegiac myths reflect the same spirit as the Amores proper and the Ars. Helen, for instance (in Heroides xvii), is simply the Ars in action as are Ariadne in the Fasti and Venus and Mars in the Ars. It is in the other myths noted just below that a differentiation from the usual mood of Ovid's elegiac poetry is to be seen.</page><page sequence="26">Vol. lxix] Ovid and the Augustans 213 Bacchus, Ceres and lasius, Ilia and the Anio. All these appear in Ovid's amatory elegy-like similar myths in Tibullus and Propertius-as exempla or 7rapaELeyuiaTa ostensibly illus- trating the story. They are an eminently Alexandrian device, occurring either in hurried succession as brief similes with a qualis or sic before them, or else, more rarely, singly and at much greater length.84 Ovid, in contrast to Tibullus and Propertius, is quite partial, at least in the Ars, to the second type, that is to say the developed myth-story generally related in a far fuller manner than the occasion of its mention de- mands. Ovid is plainly interested in the myth. More im- portant his .interest is essentially a serious one. But in these poems it is not so much the story itself that intrigues him but the culminating emotion or passion behind it. This I know is for some sufficiently accounted for by the considera- tion (first) that it is characteristic of elegiac narrative tech- nique 85 and (second) that it is characteristic of Alexandrian poetry in general.86 But without denying either of these two assumptions, we must at least admit that this interest of Ovid in particular master passions is carried beyond the point of mere literary imitation. In the Ars, Pasiphae and Procris are introduced as illus- trations of the feminine libido and feminine credulity re- spectively. Each is an instance of a special passion carried 84 Renz (op. cit. [see note 17]) calls these respectively "Einzelbeispielen" and " Beispielreihe". 85 Cf. note 14 supra. While elegiac narrative usually does not admit the most serious sort of treatment-above all nothing of epic dimensions or spirit- it can lend itself to a great variety of themes ranging from the facetious (most usual in Ovid) to the sentimental and tragic. Nor does Heinze's rule of asym- metry (see supra note 19) mean that the story must be concentrated on one emotion but only on one aspect (generally a humorous or sentimental aspect) of the story. In fact most of the Fasti-while keeping to the rule of asymmetry -is not in the least concerned with any especial 'master passion'. 86 The general emphasis on emotion and especially unusual or pathological emotion is Alexandrine and Hellenistic. This fact, however, does not 'explain' Ovid's interest in it any more than the fact that Jeffers lives in a Freudian age 'explains' his preoccupation with incest. So far as we can tell, Ovid owes this interest as much to Euripides as to anybody else. Cf. note 96 below.</page><page sequence="27">214 Brooks Otis [1938 to the point of disaster. To Ovid here, Procris and Pasiphae are prototypes of these passions; they are in fact psychopathic cases and as such interest him.87 That this is no momentary interest is-it seems to me-clearly proved by the Heroides. While a few of the Heroides are just good pupils of Magister Ovidius, professor of the Amatory Art,88 most of them are actually women in love.89 "When have I learned all this?" 87 Cf. Ars i.281f: Parcior in nobis nec tam furiosa libido: Legitimum finem flamma virilis habet. Byblida quid referam, vetito quae fratris amore Arsit et est laqueo fortiter ulta nefas? Myrrha patrem sed non qua filia debet amavit. Then follows the story of poor Pasiphae,-the most extreme instance of the feminine libido gone beyond all bounds. The importance of the passage I have quoted here can hardly be over-estimated because it reveals Ovid's preoccupation with the problem as well as his perception of the fact that its most perfect exemplifications are female. It is no accident that the Myrrha and Byblis stories form the 'climax' of the Metamorphoses. See p. 224 below. 88 E.g. Phaedra and Helen. Phaedra's line of reasoning is exactly that of Ovid in the Amores and Ars: ista vetus pietas, aevo moritura futuro, Rustica Saturno regna tenente fuit (Heroides Iv.131-2). She calls pietas rustic ! Again note her pun on rustica: si Venerem tollas, rustica silva tua est (Iv.102). The Paris and Helen letters are obviously the ars amatoria in a full-dress demonstra- tion. Paris has only to mention the word rustica (xvI.287) to rouse Helen's concern (xvIi.12, 13). Elsewhere only Penelope uses rustica (I.77) but only in a moment of apprehension. It is therefore noteworthy that none of the other heroines show this kind of special regard for the ars amatoria. 89 Cf. Medea referring to the wiles of Jason (xii.89-91): Haec animum (et quota pars haec sunt?) movere puellae Simplicis et dextrae dextera iuncta meae. Vidi etiam lacrimas (an et ars est fraudis in illis?). Sedlmayer's emendation here et ars is I believe quite right: Medea suspects all art; all she knows is her own passion. This whole epistle (xii) in fact is one of the most instructive for the student of Ovid's treatment of the love theme and master passion. Up to v. 128 he follows in the main the Argonautica of Apollonius (iii.275f); from 128 to 212, the Medea of Euripides, although naturally he avoided duplicating the events already treated in his own tragedy Medea. (I take the date of epistle xII to be slightly posterior to that of Ovid's play although only very slightly so; cf. note 48 above.) Ovid alters the character- izations of Apollonius and Euripides to produce a much more consistent and 'passion-mastered' Medea. He reduces Apollonius' varied and subtle psycho- logical description of the formation of love to the simple genetic pattern re- quired for his 'master-passion' theme. This pattern includes four things chiefly: (1) the passion's origin must be instantaneous (i.e. it must appear from the start to be a self sufficient motivating entity and not the result of a net-work of previous traits and accidents); (2) the passion must fight a swift and successful battle for mastery over all other alternative or prior passions</page><page sequence="28">Vol. lxixl Ovid and the Augustans 215 asks Oenone,90 and she answers briefly "Amo!" Their chief characteristic is absolute sacrifice of all other considerations to their master passion, love for one man. The Dido of Ovid has nothing of the queenly dignity of Virgil's Dido. She will be Aeneas' mistress if there is no other way of holding him.9' Canace, the best drawn of all, is the victim of a passion she does not attempt to understand or excuse; that she is Maca- reus' sister does not matter. Laodamia cares nothing for the military honor of Protesilaus: Bella gerant alii, Protesilaus amet.92 Sappho is so far gone that she asks not even the dignity of requited love but merely permission to go on loving him herself.93 and it is for this reason seldom 'natural' or normal and hence is seldom (even if it be love) shared by its object; (3) the-passion must immediately attain or strive to attain its most complete development or satisfaction (i.e. there is nothing gradual about the master passion); and (4) the final culmination of the master passion in action is generally unnatural or fatal or both. All these elements occur in Hellenistic poetry but in Ovid they are with relative con- sistency combined and used in one pattern. Thus in Apollonius, Medea's love is caused by Eros even before Jason appears; with which contrast Ovid's et vidi et perui (xii.35), itself a reminiscence of Virgil's Theocritean reminiscence (Eclogues 8.42). Again Ovid's Medea is dominant throughout the epistle, with Jason only a mercenary deceiver whereas Apollonius makes both Medea and Jason relatively geniune characters with genuine emotions. That this difference in Ovid is not simply a necessity of the epistolary situation is proved by its reappearing substantially in the Medea of the Metamorphoses. Thirdly, the Jason of Ovid comes immediately to the point-making matrimony a quid pro quo-and conquers by his artful tears, whereas in Apollonius his pro- posal is the natural consequence of his own love excited by sight of Medea's tears (Argonautica iii.1077-8). Such a development would quite spoil the rigidity of characterization required by the master-passion schema. Finally the unnatural love (with the fratricide involved) ends in the further unnatural slaughter implied by xii.212 (Nescio quid certe mens mea maius agit). Here also Medea cannot help herself; the passion masters her: Quo feret ira sequor. Facti fortasse pigebit. With which compare Met. vII.19f: sed trahit invitam nova vis. aliudque cupido, Mens aliud suadet; video meliora proboque, Deteriora sequor. These lines can only be understood in the light of the full theory of master passion as exhibited throughout Ovid's work. Needless to say, they are an echo of Euripides who is in this respect the predominant influence on Ovid. 90 v.129-130. 91 vii.167: si pudet uxoris, non nupta, sed hospita dicar. 92 xiiI.84. 93 xv.96: non ut ames, oro, verum ut amare sinas.</page><page sequence="29">216 Brooks Otis [1938 This kind of emphasis, mastery by one passion to the ex- clusion of others, is not very successful as a literary device. There is an indubitable monotony in the Heroides. But the reason for it is precisely this treatment of the love-emotion and not, as many have supposed, the rhetorical bias of the presentation. The Heroides are far, far more than suasoriae in verse.94 (Even Ovid's prose suasoriae and controversiae were by no means conventional.95) They reveal not only the in- terest in tragedy which engrossed Ovid at this period of his life but more particularly his interest in Euripides.96 Without doubt his tragedy Medea, like that of his model, is a portrait of a woman frenzied with jealousy to the point of ignoring even the most elementary maternal instincts. just as in his 94 The theory that the Heroides are simply suasoriae in verse is not so popular as it was. Cf. bibliography in Hosius, op. cit. (see note 3), 225. Heinze has rightly protested against this kind of interpretation (op. cit. [see note 12], 70-71). Of the recent material on this question, I might mention here K. F. Smith, Martial the Epigrammatist, and Other Essays (Baltimore, 1920), 72f, who not only explains the Heroides from suasoriae but most of the rest of Ovid (including the Tristia and Epistulae ex Ponto) as well. Very recently Karl Jax, "TOr0ot," W.St. LIV (1936), 43-51, has deduced a kind of " Motivgeometrie" of rhetorical TorOl from the Heroides; formerly Zielinski (see citation in Hosius, op. cit. above) had calculated the number of these TOr6o at just fourteen. The objec- tion to this kind of interpretation is not to its premise that Ovid was influenced by the writing and declaiming of suasoriae but to its relatively naive assumption that this influence is absolute and completely causative! For different and far more suggestive interpretations of the Heroides see E. K. Rand, Ovid and his Influence (Boston, Marshall Jones, 1925), 18f and Lucille Haley, "The Feminine Complex in the Heroides," C.J. xx (1924), 15f. 95 Seneca's statements: declamabat autem Naso raro controversias et non nisi ethicas: libentius dicebat suasorias: molesta erat illi omnis argumentatio (Sen. contr. 2.2.12) and: oratio eius iam tum nihil aliud poterat videri quam solutum carmen (2.2.8) would seem to indicate that Ovid's approach to the rhetorical schools was profoundly modified by his own temperament. This is clearly proved by the one extant controversia of his. Its whole contorted reasoning hinges on the right of the passion, love, to carry all before it: Quid ad patrem pertinet quod amantes iurant sibi credere? Nec ad deos pertinet (2.2.10). 96 Cf. A. Palmer, P. Ovidi etc. Heroides (Oxford, Clarendon, 1898), xv and xvi. Ovid actually used plays of Euripides as models for the Phaedra, Canace, Medea, and Laodamia letters, and elsewhere the tragedian's influence is quite discernible. Ovid records his indebtedness to Euripides in Tristia ii.381-406.</page><page sequence="30">Vol. lxixl Ovid and the Augustans 217 surviving prose controversia 97 he defends against paternal prudence the love that goes to extremes, so here he doubtless strove to paint a sympathetic portrait of the woman who can kill her own children for love. Such an extreme of feeling, the monomania that drives away every other human feeling and decency, is of course definitely psychopathic. Its inevitable terminus is catastrophe of some sort or other. There can be no doubt that Ovid was quite aware of this. While the phenomenon fascinated him, he shuddered at it as much as other people. But Ovid as an observer was something of a psychiatrist. He was inheriting here a predominantly Hellenistic tradition. As in art, so in literature the Hellenistic world turned from the 'normal' to the abnormal, from the mean to the extreme. But no Hellenistic writer shows any real awareness of the moral problem raised by monomania. What to an earlier generation would have been hybris-violation of the necessary sophrosyne-is to the Alexandrines simply a striking instance of 7raOos, requiring notice and not explanation. More funda- mentally, the very notion of an ability in the human mind to resist a great passion (of one sort or another) is replaced by an almost Freudian fatalism. Ovid, as we have seen, shows all these traits and shows them not as literary influences but as actual preoccupations. He reflects indeed the naturalism of the later Greek world. For him-passions and passions alone " spin the plot." His own prescription for such an essen- tially catastrophic world was to escape-to escape at all hazards the furiosa libido 98 of, for example, a Pasiphae. That is why the urbane amour de coquetterie is to be prized: it is not emotional; it is only a semi-serious game and its end is the satisfaction of simple corporeal desire. But as an observer of this world, Ovid saw and pondered the workings of all the pathological emotions. There can, I think, be little doubt that it was with such a 97 See note 95 above. 98 Ars i.281.</page><page sequence="31">218 Brooks Otis [1938 kind of interest that Ovid approached the myth. How, how- ever, was he to apply this interest to the actual realm of the inherited mythology? How, above all, could he adapt it to the marvelous and supernatural? In the Heroides he could delimit the subject to special heroines who do not, except adventitiously, involve the marvelous per se. (In the Fasti the calendar itself suggests the subject and much of the treat- ment: Ovid hardly felt obligated to go beyond a tasteful account of the different accepted versions of the mythical origins of festivals.) But if he contemplated a larger work of epic character, he would necessarily have to allow himself a much greater mythological scope and, above all, integrate it with some much more explicit purpose. One type of epic- the vogue since Virgil-was, loosely speaking, Homeric in character and followed some mythical hero or heroine through a course of various adventures. It might or it might not have a definite Roman significance. To Ovid such a genre would have been very uncongenial; not only was the pretense of rivalry with Virgil absurd but he had sense enough to see that one could not now revive the Homeric method unless one wanted to do what Virgil had done-that is to say couch the material in terms of Rome and Augustus.99 But the Aeneid is the most unnaturalistic of all epics; Aeneas is the symbol of patriotic devotion triumphant over every mastering passion. To a spiritual naturalist such as Ovid, this scheme or any similar scheme would be impossible. There remained a totally different genre. This was what Martini aptly calls the "Kollektivgedicht". 100 It is essen- tially an offspring of the famous Callimachean objection to long epic of the Apollonius type. One could not after the great quarrel be an Alexandrian and write Homeric epics, but one could-without violating the sacred principles of Calli- 99 The fate of these 'rivals' of Virgil has not been kind. Only the solicitude of the classical scholar preserves such names as Arbronius Silo, Macer, Came rinus, Domitius Marsus, Lupus, Largus, Jullus Antonius, Ponticus, Albinovanus Pedo, etc. 100 Cf. supra p. 189.</page><page sequence="32">Vol. lxix] Ovid and the Augustans 219 machus-write a loosely-knit collection of short pieces.'0' Indeed, Callimachus himself wrote such a collection. Such a collection might be tied together not only by loose narrative links (several members of a banquet each tell a story-for instance) 102 but by some common motif or subject (the aeti- ology of place names, the origin of birds, etc.), and, as every- body knows, Nikander wrote one such collection based on the principle of metamorphosis (change in shape) called the Crepobmueva. It was this genre that Ovid adopted; Nikander's poem prob- ably suggested the idea and something of the form of the Metamorphoses to him.'03 But it is reasonably clear that the spirit and method of Ovid's poem are far removed indeed from the spirit and method of Nikander's. The latter probably arranged his metamorphoses geographically and-while he may have linked them by a superficial narrative chain-he wrote what was probably a rather bald compilation. Other Kollektivgedichte of this and later periods seem to have been equally uninspired. For example, Boios' ornithogonia seems to have arranged all the birds simply on a taxonomic prin- ciple.'04 But Ovid adopted, instead, a broad historical frame- 101 Cf. Martini, op. cit. (see note 5), 165-170. 102 Cf. Pfeiffer, Kallimachosstudien (Miinchen, 1922), 38f. 103 Of the numerous studies of Nikander's relation to Ovid see especially Vollgraff, Nikander und Ovid (Groningen, 1909) and the recent article of W. Kroll, Pauly-Wissowa-Kroll, R.E., "Nikandros," xxxiii (1936), 254, 263. The direct influence of Nikander (aside from the idea of metamorphosis as a topic) can be reduced to a very limited number of myths. Even in these Ovid seems to have made many changes. 104 Cf. Lafaye, op. cit. (see note 10), chapter II. Parthenius of Nicea (the teacher of Gallus) and a certain Theodoros wrote Metamorphoses (with that title) in Greek. The extent to which Ovid used such sources has probably been greatly exaggerated. The real question, at any rate, is not so much what sources he used (although that is important) but what his technique of composi- tion and actual artistic purpose was. Wherever we have his sources (e.g. for Heroides XII; cf. note 89) we can, I think, observe significant modification of them to serve a special artistic aim. The single significant treatment of the Metamorphoses from this point of view is A. Rohde's De Ovidi Arte Epica (see note 13). In addition to this question of specific sources for each myth there is the further problem of the ensemble. Here again the acceptance or rejection</page><page sequence="33">220 Brooks Otis [1938 work for his myths; he wrote in the Hesiodic tradition, a carmen perpetuum,105 a poem that went right on from chaos to the present, or rather to one specific culmination in the immediate past: the transformation of Caesar into a star. While the myths are only loosely attached to each other (the narrative links are mostly superficial),106 there is a more essen- tial unity of tone and feeling: the particular balance of mood and the general transition from one historical epoch to another. This, however, is a large topic and quite beyond the scope of such a paper as this. I wish to direct attention here only to two major aspects of the Metamorphoses: the idea of meta- morphosis itself and the significance of the Roman parts of the poem. of the "mythological hand book" theory depends on one's judgment of Ovid's skill and purpose in the arrangement of the myths. The question is not primarily whether he did or did not consult such a book but how far he allowed its arrangement to determine that of the Metamorphoses. Here again the recent work of W. Klimmer, Die Anordnung des Stoffes in den ersten Vier Biichern von Ovids Metamorphosen (Erlangen, Boegl, 1932), provides a suggestive (if not entirely acceptable) correction of the work of Kienzle, Dietze, Zinzow, Laudien, etc. (see Hosius, op. cit. [see note 3], 241). It is my intention to discuss this whole question elsewhere. 105 See Met. i.2-3: primaque ab origine mundi ad mea perpetuum deducite tempora carmen. and the explanation of the Lactantian Argumenta (xv.52): Sequitur epilogus propositi et, ut pollicitus est, a principio mundi usque ad suam aetatem mirabiliter perpetuati: cuius fidem aeternitati vitam sibi per hoc perpetuam secure promittit. For Hesiod see Argumenta i.1: 'ut Hesiodus ndicat,' 'ut idem Hesiodus indicat.' For the value of the pseudo-Lactantius' ievidence cf. infra note 120. 106 See F. J. Miller, "Some Features of Ovid's Style III: Ovid's Method of Ordering and Transition in the Metamorphoses," C.J. xvi (1921), 464f and especially W. Klimmer's Die Anordnung etc. (see note 104). Ovid is not interested in continuity of narrative but of mood and subject. The simplicity of his narrative linkage is almost in inverse proportion to the significance of his groupings by theme and stimmung. Thus in Books I-IV the Daphne, Io, Phaethon, Callisto, Ocyrhoe, Aglauros group is definitely contrasted with the large Cadmus group that follows; in the one the relationship of mortal and god is on the whole casual and good natured, the god taking the initiative; in the other the relationship is one of transgression and vengeance and the mortal (like Pentheus or the Minyeides or the Tyrrhene sailors) takes the initiative. This group-contrast is far more significant than the random linkage of the stories to one another.</page><page sequence="34">Vol. lxix] Ovid and the Augustans 221 I. We have seen that Ovid was naturally led to adopt as the model of his epic the Alexandrian Kollektivgedicht rather than the Argonautica or the Aeneid. But why should he have chosen the subject metamorphosis (that he had a predecessor in Nikander is no sufficient reason) 107 and why the form that he calls carmen perpetuum? There is, I think, only one expla- nation which fits all the facts. He was interested in what we might call the pathology of the master passion. Each single instance of such passion-Medea, for example, or Canace, or Procris-might seem to invite nothing but disaster, yet col- lectively a world-composed of such libidines-goes on no whit abashed. For individuals there often seems no way out; for the universe, however, there always is. To a humanist, such as Sophocles, or a patriot, such as Virgil, the answer to this apparent contradiction is a moral one: it is the result of the effort of men who like Aeneas (in contrast with Turnus) or Augustus (in contrast with Antony) restrain their passions by some moral and patriotic code. But to a naturalist, such as Ovid, the solution could hardly be moral in this sense. The issue of the master passion is not destruction but instead something quite different-change. Destruction to one man seems to another only a salutary metamorphosis. Both nat- ural and human history is thus nothing but a working out of this principle. Such a principle gave Ovid the clue both to his treatment of myth and to his philosophic explanation of it. The Meta- morphoses are obviously no rigidly unified poem; they are infinitely various in subject, mood, and style. But their cen- tral topic is, it seems to me, clear: some mortal brought by a fatal master-passion to an impasse, the result of which is metamorphosis. To this rule there is one great exception: the Gods.108 Their passions have free rein and lead to no serious 107 Cf. supra, note 103. 108 Cf. Heinze's discussion (op. cit. [see note 12]). The matter was for Ovid not, according to Heinze, a "glaubens-, sondern ein Stilfrage". He attempts to prove (a) that Ovid in the Metamorphoses follows Virgil's treatment of the Gods, (b) that Ovid always stresses the Gods' 'erhabenheit', (c) that Ovid</page><page sequence="35">222 Brooks Otis [1938 consequences except to mortals, often innocently involved with them. In special cases metamorphosis is only one of the world's harsh accidents and Ovid-particularly in the Actaeon story 109-does not disguise the injustice of such a system. Essentially, however, his concern is with mortals among whom the rule usually holds true."10 But it would obviously be absurd to reduce every case of metamorphosis to this prin- ciple. Ovid in fact deals with a welter of myths-with most, indeed, to which any change of shape has been connected. He does not always omit a myth simply because it does not meet his formula. Nor does he hesitate to introduce a myth which may provide a salutary contrast, as is, for example, true of the Philemon-Baucis story. But all this in no way conceals his essential attitude toward metamorphosis. Cofisider some of the central episodes of the poem: Lycaon, Daphne, Phaethon, Pentheus, the Minyeides, the Pierides, Niobe, Tereus, Medea, Cephalus and Procris, Meleager and eliminates 'nequitia' from the Gods, and (d) that he invests them with religio or sublimitas in conspicuous contrast with the Fasti. This, with the important exceptions noted by Rohde (op. cit.), represents a relatively correct estimate of the 'new approach' of Ovid in the Metamorphoses. I do not think, however, that it is just a 'Stilfrage'. The Gods, by their nature, are exempt from meta- morphosis except as their inclinations lead them to adopt from time to time a temporary disguise. Hence it is impossible for metamorphosis in their case to have the same significance as with mortals. This, it seems to me, implies, as an obvious corollary, that they must-in any symbolic scheme of nature- represent a fundamentally serious element in nature since they constitute its constant element. But they are not by any means exempt from the failings of anthropomorphic divinities. The Jupiter of Met. i-iII is at once an irre- sponsible philanderer and the avenger of impietas (Met. i.162f). Yet it is nevertheless obvious that the Gods cannot-by virtue of their divinity-be subject to 'master-passion'. It is noteworthy that the more the Gods recede from the foreground of the poem,-the more they appear to exercise a moral and judicial role. Cf. note 106 above. 109 The Gods themselves are represented as disputing the justice of Diana: 'aliis violentior aequo Visa dea est, alii laudant dignamque severa Virginitate vocant' (Met. iii.253-255). I cannot agree with Pohlenz (cf. note 48) in sup- posing that this passage (in whole or part) was added after Ovid's religation to Tomis. 11O I.e. often enough to be a rule.

What is remarkable about this gallery, especially when compared with that of the Heroides, is the great diversity of it. In each case the passion- ate impulse of the character concerned is quite distinct. In Lycaon it is the sheer love of evil; in Daphne, an abnormal devotion to chastity; in Phaethon, curiosity; in Pentheus, stubborn incredulity; in Niobe, maternal pride; in Byblis, incestuous love; in Alcyone, uxorious affection. Then each transformation represents the resolution of this passion into a corresponding animal, plant, or 'mineral '-which, however, is now not only fixed in its set characteristics but becomes a permanent addition to nature."' The whole business is a kind of symbolic origin of species. Ovid is of course only taking the myths he finds, but, by his selection and treatment, he makes them serve a much more fundamental purpose than former treatment of them had indicated."2 1"I E.g. Lycaon, Arachne, the Minyeides, Pierides, etc. Even the existence of species is, however, subject to the law of transformation. Cf. Met. xv.252- 253. For a list of the separate metamorphoses by classes (mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, insects, plants, stones, metals, water, etc.) see W. Quirin, Die Kunst Ovids in der Darstellung des Verwandlungsaktes (Giessen, Broning, 1930), 120f. Quirin's dissertation is a useful summary of the various devices used by Ovid in his description of the metamorphosis-act. Quirin, however, takes a somewhat mechanical view of Ovid's technique of variatio; it is more than a desire simply to tell each transformation differently. It is also an attempt to indicate the significant correspondence or lack of correspondence between the human character and what it becomes. 112 I propose to treat this subject in a separate article, but cf. Heinze's remarks (op. cit. [see note 12], 12 note) on the Erysichthon story (Met. viII.738 ff.) and Ovid's use of Callimachus' Demeter Hymn; on Callisto (op. cit. 106); and again on the story of Latona and the farmers (vi.331) where Ovid's source was Nikander. Most significant of all perhaps is Ovid's divergence from Nikander in the Byblis story (Met. ix.443-665). Cf. especially for this J. Dietze, Komposition und Quellenbenutzung in Ovids Metamorphosen (Hamburg, Liitcke u. Wulff, 1905), 37-39. To Heinze, the matter was too much a " Stil- frage" to permit him to pay due attention to the topical significance of Ovid's manipulation of the Hellenistic sources. Greater awareness of this aspect of Ovid's work is shown by Hans Diller in his essay "Die dichterische Eigenart von Ovids Metamorphosen," Hum. Gymn. XLV (1934), 25-37. His contrast of Ovid with Callimachus (in the Erysichthon myth; see above) is full of insight but marks only a beginning in this important field of Ovidian criticism.</page><page sequence="37">224 Brooks Otis [1938 The sequence of historical development in the poem is, how- ever, only loosely indicated. We pass gradually from the exploits of Gods to those of heroes and then to the Trojan war, Aeneas and Rome. But there is only a very patchy inter- relation of events. Much more important is the gradual change in the tone and atmosphere. After the creation we are mainly concerned with the Gods-their casual love affairs with mortals (such as Daphne, Io, Callisto, Europa) or else their harsh vengeance on mortals (such as Lycaon, Aglauros, Actaeon, Semele, Pentheus). In the fourth, fifth, and sixth Books, the exploits of Gods and mortals are balanced through such impious detractors of divinity as the Minyeides, Pierides, and Arachne. In the seventh and eighth Books, mortals emerge into the foreground as victims of their own brutal passions (in the stories of Tereus, Medea, Scylla, Daedalus, Erysichthon). We then come in the next two books (with Byblis, Myrrha, etc.) to the most horrible of human passions, viz., incest. This is the real climax of the poem. With the tragic story of Alcyone (the wife who was too much a wife to live as a widow) we leave the realm of great legendary tragedy for the collective deeds of the protohistoric and his- toric figures, such as Achilles, Ajax, Aeneas, Romulus, Caesar. Here we feel-despite fine passages-a definite sense of anti- climax. Ovid knew he had to bring his poem down to Roman times, but he felt himself to be dealing with subjects with which he was not at his best and which strictly speaking did not really serve his main theme. The real climax, as I have indicated, comes in Books Nine, Ten, and Eleven, and preeminently in their three longest epi- sodes, the Byblis, Myrrha, and Alcyone stories. The patho- logical passions of the first two, the uxorious solicitude of the third provide Ovid not only with his most characteristic sub- ject, but reveal most clearly his naturalistic view of human life as well as his naturalistic solution of it.ii3 In all these cases the metamorphosis is not only a relief from unutterable 113 Cf. Ovid's comment on Byblis and Myrrha in Ars i.283-285.</page><page sequence="38">Vol. lxix] Ovid and the Augustans 225 pain and an impossible situation but also an inevitable finale. It is in no sense simply tacked on to the story. It is the alter- native to an otherwise inevitable catastrophe but an alterna- tive which both resolves the situation and contributes a new element to the continuing universe. But this general course of the poem's development which I have just traced does not stand by itself. It is included-like a great canvas-within two framing passages 114 (at the be- ginning and at the very end) which are not only written in a different style-that of philosophy-but which are essentially an attempt at philosophical explanation. The most eminent characteristic of both passages is that they speak what is essentially the language of neo-stoic philosophy."'5 It is not (in the first passage) the familiar gods of the poem proper who are the movers of creation. It is a deus et melior natura or an ille opifex rerum, mundi melioris origo."6 It is a better nature, a better beginning which develops the world out of chaos. To it, both the familiar gods and mortals are subject. And the whole account of creation is in accord with this philosophic deity; it is no myth: it is science or philosophy."17 How can this be reconciled with the long intervening mass of myths about capricious Olympians consorting with passion- bound mortals? The answer is appropriately stated in the last book where in the long soliloquy of Pythagoras what we might call the moral of the poem appears: 118 Omnia mutantur, nihil interit; errat et illinc Huc uenit, hinc illuc et quoslibet occupat artus Spiritus eque feris humana in corpora transit Inque feras noster nec tempore deperit ullo; Utque nouis facilis signatur cera figuris Nec manet ut fuerat nec formas seruat easdam, Sed tamen ipsa eadem est; animam sic semper eandem Esse, sed in uarias doceo migrare figuras. 114 i.1-88 and xv.75-478. "1 Cf. infra, note 120. 116 Met. i.21.79. Elsewhere the creator is referred to anonymously as quisquis fuit ille deorum (32). 117 Cf. infra, note 120. 118 xv.165-172.</page><page sequence="39">226 Brooks Otis [1938 The spirit is one; it only changes shape. Nothing perishes; there is the eternal law of conservation in the midst of meta- morphosis. Species, elements change; the rocks and lands and stars change. But the melior natura is always directing and informing the change. The tone here is as philosophic and, I might add, in language as Lucretian, as the tone at the beginning of the poem."19 The two passages obviously correspond and the doctrine, despite some apparent contradiction, is one; in all probability Ovid got it through Varro from Poseidonius.120 In contrast with the Silenus song of the Sixth Eclogue,'2' where the philo- sophic account of the beginning of the world has such little direct relation to the ensuing myths, the Metamorphoses relate the philosophic beginning to a real explanation of their intent. The melior natura works, as Pythagoras explains, through metamorphosis. The myths are in this respect simply sym- 119 Cf. xv.150f and throughout this passage. For the beginning of the poem (Met. i.1f) cf. 1. 4 with Lucretius v.548; 1. 9 with Lucretius i.59; i.176; i.501, etc. 120 Cf. Lafaye, op. cit. (see note 10), 221: "En definitive, le resultat de cette etude est, comme on voit, de rapporter a Varron toute ce qu'Ovide a connu de la science du portique et du neo-Pythagorisme." For Poseidonius cf. Moriz Haupt's notes to Met. i.1-75 (Die Metamorphosen, etc., Vol. I, erklart von M. Haupt nach den Bearbeitungen von 0. Korn und H. J. Muller. 8th Ed., Berlin, 1903). Despite many alternative suggestions (see Martini, op. cit. [see note 74], 38), the conclusions of A. Schmekel, De Ovidiana Pythagoreae Adumbratione Doctrinae (Greifswald, 1885) still hold in the main. That Varro (Antiquities) is Ovid's source seems confirmed beyond all doubts by the evi- dence of the pseudo-Lactantian Argumenta (especially i.1). I have tried to prove (" The Argumenta of the So-called Lactantius," Harvard Studies in Clas- sical Philology XLVII [1936], 131f) that such passages (e.g. the mention of authorities such as Varro, Nikander, etc.) go back at least to the fifth or sixth century and originally formed part of a commentary on the Metamorphoses probably written by a scholar of the period who must have had access to sources and traditions unknown to us. But here again the question of sources is not as fundamental as some have supposed. As is true of the Anchises speech in Aeneid vi, the real point of interest here is not the source of the doctrine but its meaning in its context in the poem. Both Virgil and Ovid found a philosophic explanation of myth in Varro and Poseidonius; the fundamental significance of both these writers is that they provided a rationalistic bridge from scepticism (and Epicureanism) to Augustan religiosity. 121 Cf. G. Jachmann, "Vergils Sechste Ekloge," Hermes LVIII (1923), 298f.</page><page sequence="40">Vol. lxix] Ovid and the Augustans 227 bolic.122 The Ovid who in the Ars so brusquely and crudely blurted out the Varronian conception of the utility of the Roman cults,-here in the Metamorphoses shows a very much deeper sense of the universal symbolism involved in myth. This symbolism is not explained in so many words; the bare collocation of mythological and scientific metamorphosis makes it clear.'23 II. But this Pythagoras episode is not merely a philosophic explanation of metamorphosis. Like the speech of Anchises to Aeneas in Aeneid vi, the Pythagoras soliloquy has a more fundamental purpose than that of revealing the ultimate meaning of the mythical 'action. Philosophy, rather, is used to bolster up and magnify myth so that this will seem an adequate vehicle for the introduction of a very august subject: the glory of Rome and its inseparable connection with the Julian gens and Augustus. Of the types of metamorphosis mentioned by Pythagoras,-the final and culminating variety is that of nations and cities: 124 Troy, Sparta, Thebes, Athens were once great and are now but names! The culmination of all these ups and downs, however, is the career of Rome.125 This leads to a prophecy (the Helenus prophecy recalled by Pythagoras) of Rome's former power and final dominance under Caesar and Augustus (xv.446-9): Hanc alii proceres per saecula longa potentem, Sed dominam rerum de sanguine natus luli Efficiet; quo cum tellus erit usa, fruentur Aetheriae sedes caelumque erit exitus illi. With this the Pythagoras episode and the book (XV) reaches 122 Cf. Met. i.2: nam vos mutastis et illas. Illas (the reading of the most important MSS.) refers obviously to formas (1. 1). The et here must mean that the Gods who created the world also superintended the metamorphoses described in the body of the poem. The inference seems clear that the two orders of events are symbolically one. Cf. also xv.252f. 123 Note the abrupt transition from i.75 to the familiar Gods. The 'quisquis fuit ille deorum' leaves the scene for Saturn, Jupiter, etc. 124 xv.421f. 125 xv.431f.</page><page sequence="41">228 Brooks Otis [1938 a climax 126 but the poem itself has to proceed chronologically to the last 127 and greatest metamorphosis: Julius Caesar's transformation into a star.128 (Augustus' own transformation would, of course, have been premature!) Obviously, Ovid preferred to put his climactic explanation of Rome and the Julians in the form of a prophecy rather than in the form of a bald statement of present fact at the end; in this respect he simply followed the wise precedent of Propertius and Virgil.'29 In this way, then, the Metamorphoses do achieve not only a patriotic finale but a fuller patriotic meaning as well. Au- gustus is somehow made the very symbol of a great and successful metamorphosis: 'IO Haec [Roma] igitur formam crescendo mutat et olim Immensi caput orbis erit. But this result is the effect of no pietas of an Aeneas and family, but of the melior natura which works on to its own end."3' And that the poem ends with Rome dominant and Augustus princeps does not prevent us from asking another 126 The lines 452-478 merely bring the passage back into its nominal context. The real conclusion of the passage proper is at 451. 127 Cf. Tristia ii.559-560 and above note 105. 128 xv.819f - 129 Cf. A. Schmekel, op. cit. (see note 120), 74: Iam pro sua quidem parte Ovidium spectavisse, quod Augustus maxime concupiscebat, Horatius nega- verat, Propertius libri quinti elegis et Vergilius Aeneide profecerant, satis inter omnes constat. Quam ob rem ut Cassandra Propertii et Vergilii Anchises secreta doctrina futuram imperii Romani magnitudinem Caesarisque apotheosin vaticinantur, ita etiam Ovidio vaticinium opus erat. 130 xv.434-435. 131 This of course is not to be taken literally. Rome is the net result of the natural (and historical-they are one and the same) process. In this sense the fomenting agent is neither god nor man but rather the Stoic melior oatura or ille opifex rerum through whom the whole process works: 'nam vos mutastis et illas'. The di of Met. i.2 are to be taken as corresponding to the melior natura or unnamed divinity of i.1-75 rather than as identical with the anthro- pomorphic gods of the body of the poem. The contrast of this neo-stoic theology with that of Ars i.637f is more apparent than real. One is a philo- sophic-symbolical, the other a worldly utilitarian statement of the same creed, which, as we have seen, is essentially Varronian. Cf. supra notes 76 and 122.</page><page sequence="42">Vol. lxix] Ovid and the Augustans 229 question. Is not Rome-like all cities, like all things- subject to the law of metamorphosis? Must not it also perish? But this logical question is not answered by Ovid; he has ended his poem, his carmen perpetuum, and therefore has-in his way -made of it what we may now call an Augustan epic. We have seen then two Ovids: the urbane and witty amatory elegist whose whole career was in essential opposition to his contemporary Augustans and to Augustus himself; and the sympathetic connoisseur of the master passion as it met him in the field of legend and myth. This second Ovid appears only occasionally in elegy; 132 he manifests himself completely in the Metamorphoses. The essential difference in style and feeling between the Metamorphoses and his early elegiac poetry is to be attributed to the essential difference in Ovid himself, and above all to that change of interest which allowed the second Ovid to emerge. While this change of interest was perhaps largely motivated by the political atmosphere, it is merely the development of a pre-occupation and a point of view that reaches back to the earliest stage of Ovid's literary career. The art, however, by which he made of the Metamorphoses something which may, in the sense we have indicated, be called an Augustan epic and by which he became himself for once an Augustan, is nothing less in its way than one of the seven wonders of literature. 132 I.e. in the myths of the Ars and the Heroides.</page></plain_text>
