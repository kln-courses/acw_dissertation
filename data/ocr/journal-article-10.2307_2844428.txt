<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sebanzi: The Iron Age Sequence at Lochinvar, and the Tonga BRIAN M. FAGAN &amp; D. W. PHILLIPSON LOCHINVAR RANCH lies on the southern edge of the Central Kafue Basin in the Southern Province of the Republic of Zambia, and has long been famous for the enormous herds of game which graze within its boundaries. Such a region is exceptionally favourable for settlement by cattle-owning peoples and agriculturalists, and the object of this paper is to describe the sequence of Iron Age cultures in this portion of the Central Kafue Basin which throws considerable light on the problem of Tonga origins. The Ranch extends over an area of i i o,ooo acres (Fig. i), and stretches in a nine mile strip from the Kafue in the north, eighteen and a half miles southwards (Lat. I3? 53' S., Long. 270 I4' E.). Much of the farm lies on the flat floodplain of the Kafue, which meanders across a vast, seasonally inundated plain covered with short grass. The floodplain is absolutely flat and consists of deep deposits of alluvium which are waterlogged for much of the year. When the Kafue comes down in flood at the end of the rains in March or April, the river overflows its banks and inundates most of the floodplain. Water fowl and other birds abound near the Flats and crocodile and hippopotamus infest the waters of the Kafue. As one moves southwards, the short grass and monotonous topography of the Flats give way to a low-lying plain studded with ant-hills and occasional shrubs of acacia. The grass is denser and taller, but the relief is still reduced. At times of flood, the water level may cover much of the plain, with tributaries fingering far into the areas near the Ranch House at the southern end of Lochinvar. Some three miles from the south boundary, the topography again changes, for the ancient basement rocks which form most of the Zambian plateau emerge from the extensive alluvial deposits, forming a plateau surface with several low hills. The ground level rises to the 3,250 ft. contour, with isolated hills higher than 3,500 ft. The topographical change coincides on Lochinvar itself with two complexes of hot springs, named Gwisho and Bwanda, which contain important Later Stone Age sites described elsewhere (Gabel I963; Fagan &amp; Van Noten, in preparation). On the higher ground the vegetation changes, passing into semi-woodland scrub and open woodland around the hot springs. Many species of trees grow along the spring line with open acacia woodland extending southwards from Gwisho. The Lochinvar region would thus have provided a varied environment, which not only abounded in game and fish, but would also have plentiful grazing grass for cattle and moderately fertile soils for cultivation. The trees of the woodland would have provided many fruit and seeds, which could be used to supplement the diet of the farmers. Climatically, Lochinvar is hot, with summer temperatures rising to as high as 253</page><page sequence="2">254 BRIAN M. FAGAN &amp; D. W.

The annual rainfall is in the region of 35 ins., although in excep- tional years it may be much higher. Save in very dry years, water supplies on the Flats are abundant throughout the year, which would have been an added attraction to Iron Age cattle owners. To-day, the Lochinvar region is inhabited by Plateau Tonga under Chiefs Chongo and Siamusonde. The Tonga, who are cattle people, are well known from Colson's classic studies (Colson I949; I95I; I962). They make use of the Kafue Flats for grazing, bringing their cattle down to the flood plain from the plateau during the dry season on a regular transhumance cycle. The Flats themselves are largely uninhabited, except for isolated communities of BaTwa tribesmen, living on elevated mound villages, which serve to protect them from floods during the rains. Predominantly fishermen, the BaTwa also keep cattle and grow a few crops. Their settlements consist of shelters of grass and sticks of a temporary nature. The BaTwa are thought by some authorities to be the remnants of a pre-Bantu occupation of the Kafue Basin; alternatively they may be outcasts of the Tonga and their neighbours, the Ila, isolated from the plateau com- munities by their environment and way of life. To-day, they have intermarried extensively with both Ila and Tonga, from whom they are now almost indistinguishable. Archaeological research at Lochinvar began in the early I950's when DrJ. Desmond Clark investigated a report that fossil bones were being found at Gwisho hot springs. He discovered Gwisho site 'A' and immediately recognized the potential importance of the area to archaeology. Not only was there a chance that organic materials would be preserved in the Stone Age site at the hot springs, but also that the edges of the Flats would have provided a favourable area for Iron Age settlement. As a result of Clark's discoveries, Dr Creighton Gabel, then of Northwestern University, U.S.A., investigated Gwisho 'A' in I960-I (Gabel I963). During his sojourn at Gwisho, Gabel discovered an Iron Age site on the summit of Sebanzi Hill, three-quarters of a mile to the west of the hot springs. One of us (B.M.F.) visited the springs in I 962 during the course of a routine visit to Lochinvar and discovered two further Wilton sites a quarter of a mile to the east of Gwisho 'A'. Sebanzi was also inspected, since surface collections had indicated that early Iron Age sherds were present. As a result of this visit it was decided to investigate the Iron Age sequence at Lochinvar and to carry out further investigations on the Wilton sites in amplification of Gabel's original work. We carried out excavations at Lochinvar in September I963 and in April and May I964; three Iron Age sites were examined and provide much of the evidence upon which the interpretation of the Lochinvar Iron Age sequence is based. No traces of Early and Middle Stone Age occupation have yet been found within the boundaries of Lochinvar, but there is abundant evidence for Later Stone Age activity in the region, both from isolated surface finds at Bwanda hot springs and from the Gwisho excavations (Gabel I963). Although there is no evidence at Lochinvar itself for an overlap between the Stone Age and the Iron Age, there are cases in the Zambezi valley and elsewhere where early Iron Age sherds have been found on Wilton sites, suggesting that hunters and farmers were contemporary. Undoubtedly, therefore, the Wilton people at Lochinvar were the immediate predecessors of the first Iron Age communities, and may have been living there when the latter first arrived.</page><page sequence="4">256 BRIAN M. FAGAN &amp; D. W. PHILLIPSON THE IRON AGE SEQUENCE I. GWISHO HOT SPRINGS It is generally agreed that the earliest Iron Age peoples to inhabit Zambia were the channel-decorated pottery people, who were related to the makers of the Dimple Based ware of East Africa. Isolated fragments of a channelled vessel were found in I963 in a drain on the western side of the Gwisho 'B' Wilton site and subsequently described in a note in MAN (Fagan &amp; Van Noten I964) . A second sherd came to light during the I964 season at Gwisho 'B' (Fig. 2). It was found on the surface of the deposits surrounding Gwisho 'B' to the south-west of the site, some fifteen yards south-west of the previous find. A search of the surrounding ground failed to yield traces of any further sherds, nor has a site of this period come to light elsewhere on Lochinvar. These two vessels can be taken to represent isolated pots left at the springs by Iron Age visitors to Gwisho. Iron Age peoples would have found it difficult to live there like their Stone Age predecessors, for the dry areas among the springs are insufficiently large to support an Iron Age village. The I 8 in. horizon at Gwisho 'B' has been dated to I 7IO ? 70 B.C. and the Iron Age sherds lay both on the surface of the spring deposits outside the Wilton occupation area, and in the drain beside the site. Channel-decorated pottery has been dated at Machili, on the borders of eastern Barotseland, to A.D. 96 ? 220 (C-829). We have no idea how long an interval, if any, there was between the abandonment of Gwisho by Wilton people, and the dropping of the channelled sherds, but since no pottery was found actually in the deposits, we can conclude that the Wilton occupants of Gwisho 'B' antedate the Iron Age sequence at Lochinvar. II. SEBANZI Sebanzi Hill is a rocky kopje, rising some 220 feet above the Kafue Flats, one mile W.S.W. of Lochinvar Ranch House (Lat. I5 59' 28" S., Long. 27? I4' i" E.). The Flats extend right up to the foot of the hill and although the present main channel of the Kafue River does not approach closer than nine miles, in years of high flood the waters of the Kafue extend to within 200 yards of Sebanzi. The summit, which stands at 3,425 ft. above mean sea level, is relatively flat and open, consisting of a clearing some one hundred and fifty yards by seventy-five yards, surrounded by the dense thorn-bush which covers the slopes of the Hill. This bush consists mainly of the trees Ficus sp., Commiphora sp. and Sclerocarya caffra with an undergrowth of Acacia spp., Boscia salicifolia and others. The vegetation of the clearing, the edges of which are clearly defined, comprises long coarse grass and a few stunted bushes and contrasts sharply with the dense woodland which surrounds it on all sides. The relief of the surface of the clearing consists of two low mounds, with summits sixty yards apart, separated by a saddle at a level three feet lower than the tops of the mounds. Examination of ant-bear scrapes which yielded quantities of potsherds and faunal remains demonstrated the presence of an archaeological deposit some feet in depth. In September I963, we accordingly re-visited Sebanzi with a view to carrying out excavations. The more westerly of the two mounds on the summit was found to be</page><page sequence="5">SEBANZI 257 considerably disturbed by ant-bear (Orycteropus afer); excavation was therefore restricted to the eastern mound and to the intervening saddle. A series of trenches twelve feet by six feet and separated by three-foot baulks was laid out (Fig. 3), four on the eastern mound and two in the saddle being excavated down to the undisturbed natural subsoil. This was encountered at an average depth of five feet six inches below the mound and of four feet six inches below the saddle, indicating that the original surface of the kopje's summit was somewhat flatter than the present contours would suggest. The deposit was found to display little variation or stratification, consisting of fine grey ashy material and daga (baked mud) fragments, with intermittent daga lenses, apparently the remains of hut floors and fallen walls. None of these lenses, however, covered an area of more than two orthree squarefeet and theywere so distorted bycompression that theycould not be used to form the basis of a stratigraphical sub-division of the deposit. The trenches were therefore dug in arbitrary horizontal spits and the finds have been grouped for study in six superimposed levels of approximately equal thickness. Bones, potsherds, and other finds occurred in quantity at all levels and were well preserved, with the exception of those of iron which were rare and in very poor condition. The nature of the deposit is completely in keeping with that of the Iron Age village mounds which are frequently encountered in the Southern Province of Zambia (Fagan I966). It was noted that the deposit encountered in the two trenches dug in the saddle was darker and more humic in appearance, and that the surface of much of the pottery, particularly that from the lower levels, was corroded. Furthermore, daga fragments were almost completely absent, indi- cating that huts, grain-bins, and other daga structures had been virtually restricted to the mounds. In fact the present increased elevation of these mounds, caused more by their greater thickness of deposit than by the contours of the subsoil, must reflect the pattern of settlement over a considerable period. Villages consisting of two groups, or an arc, of buildings with an open space between, are a common feature of Tonga areas to-day and their antiquity has already been demonstrated by one of us at Isamu Pati. The use of such an open space for the deposition of domestic refuse and animal dung would cause the accumulation of a humic, daga-less deposit such as that encountered in the saddle. That the open space in the centre of the Isamu Pati village had been used for such a purpose has been demonstrated by soil analysis (Sampson in Fagan I966). There can be no doubt, therefore, that Sebanzi was for several centuries the site of a village the layout of which was similar to that of many ancient and modern settlements in Southern Zambia. No significant variation in the quantities of daga encountered at different levels of the mound trenches was noted and the fragments themselves were not of a size to enable us to come to any conclusions about the type of structure represented. No changes in structural tradition could therefore be inferred. A charcoal sample from level five has been dated to A.D. I200? i 35 years (GXIo9) and another radio-carbon date, from the upper part of level three, is awaited. There is one foot of occupation material below the GXIo9 level and it seems reasonable to attribute the initial occupation of Sebanzi to some years before A.D. I200. Until the radio-carbon date from level three is available it would be dangerous to estimate the total duration of the occupation but this clearly must have lasted for several hundreds of years, perhaps even as late as the seventeenth or eighteenth centuries (Phillipson I 965).

PHILLIPSON Description of Finds Any evaluation of evolution and change among the inhabitants of Sebanzi must, in the absence of evidence for changes in structural tradition, be made on the basis of the faunal remains, and of the typology of the pottery and other 'small finds'. The Sebanzi Pottery A total of 32,855 potsherds was recovered during the excavations at Sebanzi. Since, however, considerable signs of disturbance were noted in the saddle trenches, analysis has been limited to the 23,I20 sherds from the eastern mound. All the vessels appear to have been round-based and the description which follows is therefore based on an analysis of the decorated and rim sherds from the four mound trenches. These may now be described in chronological order, starting with level six. Level six: Of II4 decorated and rim sherds found, over five-sixths are from small globular pots ranging from 3 ins. to 9 ins. in diameter at the rim and from 2- ins. to 6 ins. in height. Most have a simple, in-turned rim (Fig. 4, 3), although a substantial minority (27% of all vessels) have an up-turned rim (Fig. 4; I and 2), and a few have elongated, straight rims. The other vessel shapes represented are hemispherical bowls (Fig. 4, 4) up to I6 ins. in diameter (5 %) and shouldered pots (Fig. 4, 5) (io%). The ware is mainly hard and is tempered with fine grit: the fabric is generally rather thick and clumsy but the surface of the pots is nearly always carefully smoothed. All but 27% of the vessels are decorated and on the majority the decoration is symmetrical and carefully executed. Among the globular pots those decorated outside the rim predominate. This decoration is almost entirely produced by a comb-stamping technique and comprises simple banded designs, bands of diagonally applied stampings (Figs. 4, 3 and 5, 4) and of two or three parallel horizontals (Fig. 5; I and 2) being the most frequent. Incised decoration is rare, the bands of diagonal and criss-cross (Fig. 4; 4 and 7) hatching which form such an important part of the decorational motifs of later levels here each only represent 5% of the total. 6% are channel-decorated (Fig. 5, 5) but on all except one vessel this technique is used in conjunction with others (Fig. 4, 5). These channel-decorated sherds must be clearly differentiated from those of the earliest Iron Age; their relationship will be discussed later. One hemispherical bowl from level six in one of the saddle trenches has a horizontally perforated lug; apart from this one specimen handles and lugs are unknown in the Sebanzi assemblage. Level five: Here the proportion of vessels decorated remains virtually unchanged. Channel-decorated sherds continue in small numbers but there is a large increase in the proportion of incised decoration (up from I9% to 36%) at the expense of banded comb- stamping (down from 70% to 55%). Hemispherical bowls are twice as frequent and there is a slight decrease in the number of globular pots; otherwise there is little change in the vessel shapes and their relative proportions. Levelfour: At this level the winds of change begin to blow somewhat more strongly. Hemispherical bowls increase in number and are now represented by 78 of a total of 275 rim sherds, ranging in diameter from 5 to I3 ins.: all but 2 of them are undecorated (Fig. 6, I). There is a marked drop in the proportion of globular pots from 76% in level five to 2 I % in level four: these are now decorated by incision (Fig. 6, 3) and by banded</page><page sequence="7">SEBANZI 259 comb-stamping in equal proportions. Necked pots rise from I I % to 4I %; of these twenty-eight are undecorated and virtually all the rest are decorated with incision, criss-cross hatching (Fig. 6, 7) being the most common motif. A further type of decora- tion which here becomes frequent for the first time is a horizontal band of alternate triangles filled with differentiating hatching (Fig. 6, 2). Channel-decorated sherds continue to represent 4% of decorated vessels (Fig. 6; 9 and i i). Another pot type of considerable interest first makes its appearance in small numbers in this level. It differs markedly from all the other types of vessel found at Sebanzi; typical examples are illustrated (Fig. 7; i and 2). These vessels are shallow, carinated bowls, often with a slightly up-turned rim, of fine, dark ware, generally burnished on the outside and decorated with a wide band of shallow carefully applied parallel horizontal grooves, demarcated at top and bottom of the band by rows of tiny stampings. On some examples the grooves are interrupted by diamond-shaped panels (Fig. 7, i). For reasons which will be discussed later these vessels are thought not to have been made by the inhabitants of Sebanzi but to have been imported from some distance. A broken spout was found in level four of one of the saddle trenches. It is o09 inches in length, has a hole only o- i inches in diameter, and is unique in the Sebanzi collections. Level three: Decoration here becomes much less frequent, only I 76 out of 625 rim sherds being decorated. There are 264 undecorated hemispherical bowls (Fig. 7, I 2) of a shape which now accounts for 50% of all vessels recovered. Globular pots become even rarer and those with banded comb-stamping which were so common in the bottom two levels have now virtually disappeared. Comb-stamping and incision, which respectively accounted for 70?% and i % of the decoration from level six, now account for 2 % and 74%. Incised necked pots continue in slightly reduced numbers but there is an increase in the number of 'imported' carinated bowls which now represent 6% of the total: a few of the latter are now made from fine buff clay but those of very dark ware are far more common. The bowls of both wares are burnished as before. On some of these sherds (Fig. 7, i) the grooves and stamp-impressions are filled with a red slip and it is possible that this slip was applied to the other vessels of this type but has not been preserved. One miniature pot (Fig. 7, I3), probably a child's plaything, was also recovered. Level two: Only minor differences were noted in the pottery from levels three and two; 8I I rim sherds were recovered of which only 206 are decorated: 407 are of undecorated hemispherical bowls (Fig. 8; i and 2). Globular pots continue in negligible numbers and there is a drop in the proportion of necked pots (of which half are now undecorated and most of the remainder incised) from 36% in level three to 25% in level two. This drop is compensated for by a further increase in the number of 'imported' carinated bowls (Fig. 8; 6 and 8). Many of these vessels from level two are of inferior quality, unburnished, and of soft grey ware markedly different from the hard black ware of the level three bowls and of some of those from level two. It seems possible that it was becoming difficult to obtain these pots from their original source and that the inhabitants of Sebanzi were attempting to make similar bowls themselves (Fig. 8, 4). Traditional Sebanzi decoration motifs also occur on vessels reminiscent in shape of the 'imported' carinated bowls (Fig. 8, 3). One further development starts in level two but does not reach its peak until level</page><page sequence="8">260 BRIAN M. FAGAN &amp; D. W. PHILLIPSON one: this is the use of areal comb-stamping mainly in the form of interlocking triangles (Fig. 9; I I and I 2), which accounts for 4% of the decoration from level two. The pottery from these higher levels presents a somewhat rougher appearance than do the earlier vessels: the ware is coarser, the average size of the pots somewhat larger and their surfaces less carefully smoothed. Level one: The sherds from the top of the Sebanzi sequence are more fragmentary than those from the lower levels: consequently, although 747 decorated and rim sherds were recovered from the mound trenches, it was of only 496 that the vessel shape could be determined. Half of these were hemispherical bowls, the vast majority of them undecorated. In addition there were I96 necked pots which thus rise from 25% in level two to 40?% in level one: no other pot type represents more than 3 % of the total. One of these minority types is, however, of interest, being only found at this level: it is a variant form of the hemispherical bowl with a variety of elaborate rim forms (Fig. 9; 4, 6, 8 and 9) some of which are large and everted, even resembling some forms of Roman mortarium. Incision, although not so common as in levels five to two (23%), still forms an important part of the decoration (Fig. 9; 3 and 5). Banded comb-stamping is reduced to 5%, but the areal version of this technique, especially the interlocking triangle motif which first appeared in the previous level, now represents 65% (Fig. 9; 6, 9, I I and I 2) and is remarkably similar to the decoration found on modern Tonga pottery. On a few specimens the blocks of comb-stamping are outlined with lines of cuneiform impressions (Fig. 9, I o). Shallow, carinated bowls of 'imported' type continue but are less common than in level two: the majority are local copies of the earlier fine examples. THE SEBANZI 'SMALL FINDS Burnishing-pebbles: Three small water-rounded pebbles recovered during the excavation, two from level four and one from level three, show signs of repeated rubbing on one relatively flat face, and were probably used for burnishing pottery. At the levels at which they were found, burnished sherds, other than those of 'imported' ware, occur but are not common. Grinding- and rubbing-stones: These were the most common find encountered, other than potsherds and bones. In the absence of any grain impressions on the pottery and in view of the extreme rarity of carbonized seeds they are the main evidence for the importance of grain in the Sebanzi diet. The stones are indistinguishable from those used to-day. Whetstone: A fragment of coarse micaceous quartzite (Fig. IO, i), from level three, shows deep artificial grooves on both sides. It is considered that the grooves are too deep to have been caused by grinding shell beads and that the stone was more probably used for sharpening iron arrow-heads. Iron objects: Iron at Sebanzi is remarkable for its rarity. The three objects which were recovered are in an extremely poor state of preservation and far too corroded to be described with any accuracy. They are: from level three, remains of an arrow-head; from level four, an unidentifiable fragment; and from level five, remains of a hoe blade. The very poor condition of these iron objects might suggest that the scarcity of iron may be more apparent than real, other specimens having disappeared completely. However, the extreme scarcity of slag (only three pieces were found) confirms our view</page><page sequence="9">SEBANZI 26I that iron was but rarely used by the Sebanzi people. Copper, it should be noted, was completely absent. Pigment: Twelve lumps of white pigment were found in level one (4) and level two (8). Below this level pigment did not occur. Fishing weight (?): A rough, perforated, baked clay disc from level one is probably best interpreted as a fishing weight (Fig. I0, 2). It has a maximum diameter of I 05 inches and is o03 inches thick at the centre, tapering towards the edges. It is clearly not made from a potsherd as were the spindle whorls and the perforation is so narrow (o0o5 inches) that only a fibre, and certainly not a spindle could be passed through it. Spindle-whorls: No completed spindle-whorls occurred, but there are two rough-outs, both from level two. Neither has been perforated. One (Fig. I0, 3) is ivo inches in diameter, and has been carefully ground down round the edges and also on the flat faces to remove the curvature of the original pot. The second specimen is much rougher, I *5 to I -7 inches in diameter; it retains the curvature and the grinding down of the edges after the initial trimming has only just begun. These spindle-whorls are the first to be found on the Batoka Plateau, although specimens are known from the Ingombe Ilede and from Kalomo culture sites in the Gwembe valley. They suggest that the Sebanzi people, at least during the later phases of the occupation of the Hill, practised the spinning of thread. Whistles (?): Two almost identical objects of baked clay were found in level three and are probably to be interpreted as whistles. The more carefully executed of the two is illustrated in Fig. I 0, 4. It is I-I5 inches in length and made in a hard black clay. The hole in the mouthpiece is 0s2 inches in diameter and extends down into the whistle for a distance of o07 inches. At the level of the bottom of the hole a thick flange extends all round the exterior of the whistle; at the top it is pierced from side to side for suspension, on the underside it forms three non-functional bosses each with a shallow central hole. The other specimen is slightly smaller and less carefully made in a coarse grey clay. Smoking Pipes: Fragments of 4 baked clay smoking pipes were found and merit individual description. Fig. IO, 5 shows a complete bowl from level two with thin walls I -8 inches in length and with a female attachment for the stem. The only decoration is a ridge up the front of the bowl, which has a slightly everted rim. Another from level two (Fig. I0, 6), although represented only by a small fragment of the bottom of the bowl, is clearly a pipe of very different type. The walls of the bowl are thick and the space for tobacco/dagga must have been very small. The underside of the bowl is decorated with a cruciform arrangement of stampings made with a split bone fragment. Somewhat similar pipes have been recovered from the Behrens site near Kalomo (Fagan i963) which is considered to be of nineteenth-century date. Fig. I0, 7 shows a male stem attachment and part of the base of a bowl from level four. There is some indication that the walls of the bowl were thin. The slightly tapering stem attachment is only o035 inches in length and 0o3 inches in diameter at the end. Fig. io, 8, from level five, shows a fragment of another male stem attachment almost identical to that from level four, but retaining less of the base of the bowl. This pipe comes from the level dated to cir. A.D. I 200 and is thus of considerable interest in view of its early date. It is considered (Shaw I 960) that the introduction of tobacco-smoking into sub-Saharan Africa dates to after the arrival of the first Europeans. Dunhill (I 95 I) has, however, suggested that the</page><page sequence="10">262 BRIAN M. FAGAN &amp; D. W. PHILLIPSON use of pipes for smoking dagga is considerably earlier. The Sebanzi discoveries might be taken as supporting this view (Phillipson I 965) . Animal figurines: Remains of twenty-one small figurines of baked clay were recovered. All come from levels four to one, they were markedly absent from the lowest two levels. None are complete and all those that are sufficiently well preserved to be recognizable are of cattle. There are no definitely anthropomorphic figurines although it must be emphasized that the majority of the fragments are not diagnostic. The average length of a complete figurine was probably in the neighbourhood of 2-2 inches. They are crudely made of poor quality clay, often not smoothed off on the surfaces, and were made generally in sections, the legs and head being pressed on to the torso while the clay was still soft. The torsos are modelled with reasonable accuracy, but it is remarkable that on none of them, with the possible exception of one doubtful representation of a cow from level one, is there any indication of sex. Typical examples are illustrated in Fig. I O, 9-I I. Phallus: One baked clay model of a phallus, 2o05 inches in length and o07 inches in maximum diameter came from level three (Fig. IO, I2). For most of its length it is bound round with a spiral coil the significance of which is not clear. Clay bead: One large clay bead came from level one (Fig. IO, I3). It is I 2 inches long, o095 inches in greatest thickness and is longitudinally pierced. Its cross-section is the shape of a square with concave sides. Glass and shell beads: The glass beads may be classified as follows: Indian red canes, IO; wound green glass, I; they occur in all levels but the lowest. Chronologically they are of very little value. Wound green glass beads occur at the Isamu Pati Mound, Kalomo in an eleventh-century context (Fagan I966), and, together with Indian reds and other types, with the Ingombe Ilede burials, in the Middle Zambezi Valley. Twenty shell beads of typical Iron Age form were also found (Table I). The Sebanzi Economy Inevitably, the economic evidence from Sebanzi is one-sided, for conditions in the deposits are not conducive to the preservation of carbonized seeds or organic remains. There is good reason to believe, however, that the Sebanzi people made wide use of the food resources of their environment to satisfy their economic needs. Only a few unidentifiable fragments of carbonized seeds were found during our excavations, but numerous flat grindstones and rubbers testify to cereal cultivation, as does the iron hoe from level five. The soils of the Lochinvar woodland are suitable for the cultivation of both millet (eleusine sp.) and sorghum (sorghum cf. cairorum) and there is no reason to suppose that the Sebanzi people were not cultivating these crops as well as a range of vegetables and cucurbits. Many Zambian tribes rely on wild fruit, vegetables, and seeds to supplement their cereal crops and relishes (Richards I937; Scudder I962). There is every reason to believe that the Iron Age peoples of Lochinvar made intensive use of vegetable foods, as did their Stone Age predecessors. Although large collections of animal bones have been found on Iron Age sites elsewhere in the Southern Province of Zambia, only a comparatively small number, 6547 fragments, came from the Sebanzi excavations. As usual in Iron Age sites, the material is fragmentary, and difficult to identify.</page><page sequence="11">SEBANZI 263 The following species are represented: DOMESTIC ANIMALS No. of fragments Bos taurus (domestic ox) I82 Ovis or Capra sp.

They were in a fragmentary state, but the diameters at the roots of two of them were 59 and 48 mm. respectively. These measurements compare with those of 54 mm. for a horn from the Kalomo Culture site, Isamu Pati, 50-3 mm. for a nineteenth-century Tonga beast, and 6o mm. for a modern Ngoni ox (Fagan I965). It is likely, however, that the Sebanzi cattle were similar in breed to other, better known Southern Province herds. There are no means of distinguishing goats from sheep with the sample available; both are found on the Batoka plateau to-day. The dog is represented by a single toothless mandible. Dogs are known to have been common on the plateau during the first millennium A.D. (Fagan I 965) . A single humerus of a domestic fowl completes the collection of domestic animals. Fowls were common in Kalomo Culture villages (Fagan I965). All the bovidae whose remains are found in the Sebanzi collections occur in the area</page><page sequence="12">264 BRIAN M. FAGAN &amp; D. W. PHILLIPSON at the present time. As lechwe is now the most common antelope at Lochinvar, it is not surprising that this gregarious species was hunted by the Sebanzi people in considerable numbers. The occurrence of both woodland and swamp-loving antelope in the collec- tion is a reflection of the dependence of the hunters on the woodland and grassland environments within easy reach of their village. The small rodents are a more interesting collection. Dasymys incomtus, the shaggy rat, is common throughout Zambia, but both Rattus rattus and Otomys angoniensis are unknown in the Lochinvar area to-day. The former is found as far west as Mumbwa and southwards to Lusaka at the present time (Ansell I960), but specimens have been found in no less than four archaeological sites in the Southern Province dating to between goo and I800 A.D. (Davis &amp; Fagan I962), indicating that their distribution was wider during the Iron Age. Otomys angoniensis is unrecorded in the Southern or Central Provinces, except in the Machill valley on the borders of Barotseland, but Ansell (i 960) considers that it must occur throughout the plateau areas. Here again archaeology provides evidence of a former widespread distribution of this species. Birds were also trapped for the pot. Although the bones are unidentifiable, it is probable that most of them are from guinea fowl or various species of francolin, all easily snared. A variety of hunting methods have been in use on the Kafue Flats in recent times, and these techniques were probably employed by the Sebanzi people (Smith &amp; Dale I920). Lechwe, the most plentiful antelope in the collections, is hunted from light canoes, with dogs, or by game drives, while duiker are trapped in thickets or called with horn lures. Roan and eland are pursued with dogs, while warthogs are driven into their burrows and then smoked or dug out. The exceptional abundance of game at Lochinvar must have led to a considerable refinement of hunting methods. The proportions of domestic and wild animal bones can be calculated from the teeth, mandibles, maxillae, and horns as follows: Domestic Wild No. NO No. Total examined 185 75'5 6o 24-5 245 The identifiable fragments show clearly that domestic animals predominated in the meat supply at Sebanzi. A somewhat similar balance was achieved at Kangila, where cattle and small stock represented 74-2% of the bones (Fagan I966). The mandibles and maxillae were classified according to the system used on the Kalomo culture fauna (Fagan I966). Fourteen out of the sixteen ox mandibles which could be classified lie in the adolescent or adult category. All but two of the adolescent mandibles were at the stage when M3 or PM3 was erupting, and all of the adult jaws bore little sign of wear on the molars, as if they were young adults. The mortality curve obtained is similar to that from Isamu Pati and the nineteenth-century Behrens site near Kalomo (Fagan I966), where larger samples give every indication that the beasts making up the herd surplus were slaughtered for meat in their prime. The data for the game animals showed that all but three of the lechwe were young adults, while the overwhelming majority of the other animals was also fully mature.</page><page sequence="13">SEBANZI 265 There are no significant divergences from the data recorded from other Zambian Iron Age sites. A study of the frequency of body parts yielded useful data on the butchery techniques used by the Sebanzi people. The bones were analysed by White's method (White I953; I954; I956) worked out for sites on the North American plains. Owing to space restrictions it is not possible to quote the data in full but in many respects the distribution of body parts at Sebanzi is similar to that from Isamu Pati, Kangila, and Ingombe Ilede. The fore limb is more common than the hind limb, but the pelvis and the head of the femur are well represented, since those two parts are disarticulated together. There are, however, significant differences as well. At Sebanzi, the vertebrae represent only i6%, whereas at Isamu Pati they are as high as 42% on a sample of cattle bones, and at Kangila 33*4%. At the Ingombe Ilede in the Gwembe Valley, vertebrae represented Ig92%, a considerably lower proportion than on the Plateau. Another difference is in the cannon bones, represented by values of 28% and 22% for proximal and distal ends respectively, considerably lower than Isamu Pati (metacarpals 74% and 84%), Kangila (metacarpals 50% and 50%, but metatarsals 8.6% and 8.6%) and Ingombe Ilede (52'I% and 49-4%). At Sebanzi the values for both phalanges (i6%) and terminal phalanges (6%) are considerably lower than those for the other sites (Isamu Pati, 37-0, 26.4%; Kangila, 33.4%; Ingombe Ilede, 23-3, i6.4%). Undoubtedly these differences can be accounted for by the arduous ascent to the village, which would discourage the inhabitants from carrying the less productive parts of a carcass up the hill. We can suggest that only selected portions of a kill were carried to the village, and that a proportion of the domestic stock was slaughtered outside the village. Meat cannot have been in short supply in the Lochinvar environment, with the result that the hunters could afford to be careless about wastage. Some meat may also have been cooked and eaten at the site of the kill. Fish bones are abundant in the Sebanzi deposits, and the specimens recovered in the excavations were examined by Mr G. Bell-Cross of the Zambia Fisheries Department. Most of the bones are cranial fragments or vertebrae from the barbel (Clarias mossambicus or Clarias mellandi), but a number of not yet positively identified bones belong to the bream family (Cichlidae). The proponderance of barbel may suggest that they were caught in large numbers at times of mass breeding migrations, when the fish congregate in shallow water and can be clubbed, speared, or caught by hand. Large catches can also be taken from isolated drying pools in the dry season. Fish could either be eaten fresh or, as is often done to-day, dried in the sun for storage, in which case they may also have been traded. The staple diet of the Sebanzi people was probably a cereal porridge, made from sorghum, millet, or some other crop, to which wild produce, game, or beef was added as a relish. Fish must have been an important source of protein for the Sebanzi people, and have been a significant element in their diet, in contrast to the Iron Age inhabitants of the Batoka Plateau, who did not practise intensive fishing. The abundance of fish at Lochinvar must have been an important factor in the life of the people, for fishing under certain conditions provides an element of stability to both farming and food producing communities, and the abundance of bream, barbel, and other species in the Kafue may well have affected the pattern of permanent settlement in the region.</page><page sequence="14">266 BRIAN M. FAGAN &amp; D. W. PHILLIPSON TRADE The eleven glass beads are the only objects found at Sebanzi which must have been derived from the East Coast trade. A pot type completely foreign to the general style and characteristics of the Sebanzi pottery has been described and illustrated above (Fig. 7, I and 2). These shallow carinated bowls with fine horizontal grooving first appear in small numbers in level four, are common in levels three and two, and become rare again in level one. The vessel shape, the decoration, the fine quality of the workmanship, and the almost invariable burnishing all combine in differentiating these pots from the indigenous Sebanzi pottery and we have suggested that they were imported, perhaps from some distance. A marked deterioration in the standard of workmanship of these pots immediately precedes the reduction in their numbers in level one. It seems that this can best be explained by postulating a cutting off of the supply of imported pottery and an attempt by the Sebanzi people to rectify this by local imitation. An obvious but remote parallel which immediately springs to mind is the Samian ware of the north-western provinces of the Roman Empire which was extensively copied when supplies from the Gallic potteries ceased in the third century A.D. No other imported objects were found on the site, and trade appears to have been largely restricted to local bartering between neighbouring communities. CONCLUSIONS ON SEBANZI Sebanzi Hill can be shown to be the site of an Iron Age village occupied from cir. A.D. IIOO until comparatively recent times. The diversified economy was based on agriculture, husbandry, hunting, fishing and, to a very limited extent, trade. A well documented and fast-evolving pottery sequence has been described, by the end of which vessels similar to those of the modern Tonga were in use. The prime importance of the Sebanzi discoveries lies, however, in their affinities with other sites on the Batoka Plateau and beyond. These will be discussed later in this paper. III. BENSON S MOUND This site, named after one of our African assistants who rediscovered the site after one of us (B.M.F.) had lost it, is three miles N.W. of Sebanzi Hill. The site (Lat. I6? 57' 54' S., Long. 270 I5' I5" E.) lies on the crest of a low ridge in the acacia woodland, and consists of a small mound of occupation debris and sub-soil some fifty yds. long by thirty yds. across, lying about ten ft. above the level of the plain. Half a mile to the north, the woodland gives way to an open grassland plain, studded with low ant-hills. In years when the rainfall is exceptionally high, the waters of the Kafue may rise to within a few hundred yards of the edge of the woodland, bringing the animal life which flourishes at the edge of the water to within easy reach of Benson's Mound. Mr Austin Fuller drew our attention to this site. The surface collections from the mound showed that it was another Sebanzi site, and it was resolved to excavate it in ofder to establish its relationship with the larger settlement on the kopje. The surface of the mound is now extensively disturbed by ant-bear and great difficulty was experienced in finding an undisturbed area to excavate. For this reason our cuttings were confined to trial pits. Two trenches four feet square were excavated</page><page sequence="15">SEBANZI 267 in arbitrary six-inch spits on the flat top of the mound in the north-western sector of the site, the edge of the site sloping away immediately to the north of our cuttings. Unfortunately, the finds at Benson's Mound were confined to small collections of pottery and animal bones. The site was evidently not so intensively occupied as Sebanzi, although the activities of ant-bear obliged us to lay out trenches away from the richest areas. The stratigraphy revealed in both our cuttings was as follows: 0-7 ins.: Dark humic zone of occupation ash, moderately compacted. (Spits I-2.) 8-38 ins.: Light grey to brown ash occupation soil with an ashy texture and lenses of wood ash. This was the principal occupation zone. (Spits 2-7.) 38-42 ins.: Light grey to brown ash mingled with earth subsoil, where disturbance has mixed natural levels with the occupational horizons. (Spit 7.) No charcoal concentrations of significance were discovered, nor were there enough bones to obtain a radio-carbon date for Benson's Mound. Daga lumps were occasionally found, but there were no concentrations indicative of hut foundations or wall-rubble. There is every reason to believe that the deposits were accumulated within a comparatively short time. Because of this, and in view of the paucity of cultural material, the finds from Benson's Mound are considered as a whole and not by individual levels. DESCRIPTION OF FINDS Only I I8 decorated or rim sherds were found at Benson's Mound but these show such a marked similarity to those from level four at Sebanzi Hill that detailed description is superfluous. Necked pots represent 38%, globular pots 34% and hemispherical bowls 22%. Over half of the latter are undecorated. Nearly all the necked pots bear a band of criss-cross incision: this technique accounts for 8I % of the decoration. Banded comb- stamping represents only I I %. A discovery of particular interest is one sherd of the shallow carinated type of bowl thought to have been imported into Sebanzi. Benson's Mound is the only other site where such sherds have been found. Two fragments of the legs of baked clay figurines were recovered and are indistinguishable from those found on Sebanzi Hill from level four upwards. Fauna: The bones from Benson's Mound are fragmentary in the extreme, but the following species are represented: No. of fragments Bos taurus (domestic ox) 3 Cobus leche (lechwe) I Sylvicapra grimmii (duiker) I Genetta sp. (genet) 2 Testudo pardalis (tortoise) I All these animals are represented in the Sebanzi collections. CONCLUSIONS ON BENSON S MOUND The typology of the pottery is sufficient evidence for the contemporaneity of level four at Sebanzi and the Benson's Mound site. On the basis of the Sebanzi radio-carbon dates one can presumably attribute the occupation of Benson's Mound to the thirteenth or early fourteenth centuries. The site appears tohavebeenarelativelyshort-livedvillageinhabited by the Sebanzi people, practising an economy similar to that of their fellows on the Hill.</page><page sequence="16">268 BRIAN M. FAGAN &amp; D. W. PHILLIPSON IV. NABOMBE The site known as Nabombe lies a quarter of a mile to the east of the track from Lochinvar Ranch House to Chunga, four miles from the game camp at the latter (Lat. I6V 53' 24" S., Long. 270 I4' 30" E.). Nabombe is inconspicuous until one stands on its slopes, for the low mounds of ash which comprise the site are indistinguishable from ant-hills at a distance. Upon close examination it can be seen that there are three low, inter-connecting mounds of grey ash lying in a north-south direction with a length of about seventy yards and a maximum width of thirty yards. The topography of the mounds has been considerably altered by disturbance since the abandonment of the village which stood on them, but appears to have consisted of three eminences connected by saddles. A similar topography was observed by the authors at a modern fishing village on the north bank of the Kafue. The houses were built on the higher parts of the mound, while the lower portions were left bare and were frequented by cattle or used for drying fish and for other activities. Immediately to the east of the mound is a large pan, which retains water for much of the dry season. This would have provided a convenient supply of water for cattle who could have been grazed both on the Kafue Flats and, in the rains, by Nabombe itself. Nabombe was pointed out to us by Mr Fuller in I963, and at once recognized as being a comparatively modern settlement, for the pottery bore resemblances to modern Tonga collections from the Batoka Plateau. For this reason, two small trial trenches were excavated in horizontal six-inch spits on the two most prominent summits of the mound. The deposits consisted of a fine grey occupation deposit forty-two inches deep. Unlike the Sebanzi sites, there were no signs of daga in the deposits. The loosely compacted earth and the close resemblances between the Nabombe pottery and modern Tonga ware suggest that this site is not of any great antiquity. Typologically the Nabombe pottery is intermediate between that of level one at Sebanzi and that used in the Lochinvar area to-day. The presence of a ring-based sherd (Fig. I I, 4) in fact suggests that the occupation of Nabombe may date from the time of the European settlement of the area at the beginning of the twentieth century. No radio-carbon samples were obtained and, in any case, it is more than probable that the site is too recent for accurate dating by this method. DESCRIPTION OF FINDS Owing to ant-bear disturbances and the small number of finds, the Nabombe material has been considered as one unit and not level by level. Two hundred and eight decorated or rim sherds were recovered from the excavations at Nabombe. Many are too fragmentary to enable the original vessel shape to be ascertained, but of the diagnostic sherds the vast majority (89%) are of necked pots. Hemispherical bowls account for a further 8%, the majority having elaborate rims. One carinated bowl and two globular pots complete the assemblage. One quarter of all vessels are undecorated, one third of the necked pots falling into this category. Incision is extremely rare: 88% of the decoration consists of areal comb-stamping (Fig. I I; I, 2 and 8) often in interlocking triangles similar to that encountered in level one at Sebanzi Hill. A few sherds have the blocks of comb-stamping outlined by rows of cuneiform impressions (Fig. I I, 7) but in a larger group (unknown at Sebanzi) the</page><page sequence="17">SEB3ANZI 269 blocks are outlined by grooves or channels (Fig. I I, 2). This last motif represents 8% of the Nabombe decoration and is also characteristic of modern Tonga pottery. On a few specimens (Fig. I I, 8) there are traces of red slip filling the plain areas between the blocks of comb-stamping. Other forms of stamping, particularly bands of diagonally applied long impressions, perhaps of a rib, comprise 7% of the decoration and are thus twice as frequent as at any level of Sebanzi (Fig. I I, 3). A further type of decoration occurs which is unknown at Sebanzi: this consists of pairs of raised bosses perhaps representing breasts (Fig. I I, 6). One ring-based sherd (Fig. I I, 4) was also found. The head of a large, baked clay figurine, perhaps of a sheep or goat was found at Nabombe (Fig. IO, I4). The size of the complete figurine would appear to have been rather greater (about 31 inches) than was usual at Sebanzi. The representation of skin wrinkles on the neck is noteworthy. One dark flesh-coloured opaque cane glass bead was recovered and can be paralleled at the probably nineteenth-century Makoli Cemetery near Zimba and at a cave near Lusaka (Inskeep I962). There were also sixteen grinding and rubbing stones and one burnishing pebble. THE NABOMBE FAUNA A total of I,7I2 bone fragments was found in the trial pits on Nabombe Mound, and the following species can be identified in the collections: No. of fragments Bos taurus (domestic ox) 29 Cobus leche (lechwe) 5 Equus burchelli (zebra) 4 Pedetes capensis (hare) I The identifiable fragments give a total of twenty-nine domestic and ten wild bones, whilst such limb bones as can be tentatively identified comprise forty-seven domestic and thirty-five wild fragments. As at Sebanzi, hunting was evidently a significant part of the economy. Although the sample was small, analysis of the body parts showed a high value of vertebrae (70%) when compared with Sebanzi. Cannon bones represent 20-30% as opposed to 22-8%, and phalanges are between i6% and 20% at both sites. It is clear that a higher proportion of the animals killed by the inhabitants of Nabombe were cut up on the site, a view supported by the easy accessibility of Nabombe when compared with Sebanzi. Fish bones were found at all levels of Nabombe, and were examined by Mr G. Bell-Cross who found that all of them were of barbel. Careful examination of the bones showed that at least one specimen was over 20 lbs. in weight and another over I5 lbs. CONCLUSIONS ON NABOMBE The typology of the pottery and of the single glass bead recovered and the nature of the deposits combine in indicating a very recent date for Nabombe. Traces of recent occupation of Lochinvar by Tonga communities are more common than those of the earlier Iron Age. Small Tonga fishing villages are still to be found on the borders of the Ranch and on mounds by the north bank of the Kafue. On Lochinvar itself, there are a</page><page sequence="18">270 BRIAN M. FAGAN &amp; D. W. PHILLIPSON number of abandoned mounds near Melinde on the western boundaries of the farm, as well as signs of Tonga occupation in occasional surface finds of undecorated sherds in the woodland regions. Nabombe is, however, somewhat isolated from the other sites on or near the Kafue Flats. The absence of daga in the deposits suggests that the settlement and structures were of a temporary nature. Fish bones were common and Nabombe is probably best regarded as a settlement very similar to those still occupied to-day on the fringes of Lochinvar. The inhabitants grow small gardens of maize and millet, keep cattle and small stock, but rely for much of their diet on meat and especially on fresh and dried fish. Without a doubt, food gathering and hunting played an important part in the Nabombe economy, as they did at the beginning of the present century in Ila country (Smith &amp; Dale I920). V. KELLY S FARM This site came to our notice in I96I, when Mr D. B. Kelly of Mazabuka sent in a collection of potsherds collected near his farmhouse, some twenty miles S.E. of Mazabuka (Lat. I5? 57' S., Long. 270 54' E.). The site was investigated and found to be the remains of a Plateau Tonga village, probably occupied immediately before the establishment of the European farm in the I920's. A scatter of potsherds and daga occurs over about two acres around the homestead, and the outline of the village can be traced from grey midden soil. The sixty-one sherds collected from Kelly's Farm differ in only a few respects from modern Tonga pottery and would appear to be perhaps slightly later than those from Nabombe. In this small sample, necked vessels are in a strong majority and hemi- spherical bowls with plain rims are completely absent, those with elaborated rims forming 5% of the total (Fig. I i, 9). Incised decoration is rare; indeed, almost all the decoration falls into the 'areal comb-stamping' category. The use of grooving to outline the blocks of stamping is more frequent than at Nabombe but rarer than in modern Tonga ware (Fig. I i, Io). A few examples of modern Tonga pottery from Kaleya Railway Siding near Mazabuka are illustrated for comparison (Fig. I 2). GENERAL CONCLUSIONS I Our work on Lochinvar Ranch has yielded traces of Iron Age activity ranging in date from recent times back to the earliest phase of the Zambian Iron Age. The two sherds of channel-decorated pottery from Gwisho springs are closely comparable with those known from seven other sites widely distributed throughout Zambia (Fagan &amp; Van Noten I964, fig. i). One of these sites, Machili, has been dated to A.D. 96 ? 220 (C-829), whilst the pottery from another, Lusu, dates to slightly later than I 86 ? I 50 B.C. (C-839) . It is generally agreed that the inhabitants of channel-decorated pottery sites were related to the makers of the dimple-based wares of East Africa. As more sites are discovered it is becoming apparent that these immigrants from East Africa spread over much of Zambia</page><page sequence="19">SEBANZI 271 some two thousand years ago and were responsible for the introduction of pottery, metal and agriculture to Southern Africa. The excavations on Sebanzi Hill have disclosed a long sequence of Iron Age occupation lasting from cir. A.D. I IOO until comparatively recent times. In view of the paucity of the material culture a study of the internal development and external relationships of the Sebanzi people must be based almost entirely upon the typology of their pottery. Fortunately, this is most informative. A study of the pottery from each of the six levels into which the midden deposit was divided shows that Sebanzi ceramic fashions changed or evolved with considerable rapidity throughout the period of occupation of the Hill. The pottery from Benson's Mound is typologically almost identical to that from level four at Sebanzi and the two assemblages must be regarded as contemporary. Trends which are visible in the pottery from the upper two levels of Sebanzi appear to continue into the Nabombe collection and it would be reasonable to suppose that the occupation of the latter dates to a period somewhat later than the abandonment of Sebanzi. The pottery from the two sites is, however,, so similar that there can be only a small chronological break between them. Minor differences are visible between the Nabombe pottery and that used by the modern Tonga of the Batoka plateau but an intermediate stage is provided by the collection from Kelly's Farm near Mazabuka. There is thus evidence for continuous Iron Age occupation of Lochinvar over a period of some goo years, stretching from the initial occupation of Sebanzi to the present day. The pottery sequence has already been described in detail but may conveniently be summarized in tabular form: Table 2 shows the proportions of the various vessel forms at the sites considered, arranged in chronological order, and Table 3 demonstrates, in a similar manner, the proportions of the decoration techniques. For a finer analysis of the pottery and for details of individual motifs in the decoration, the reader is referred to the Appendix. The main features of this pottery sequence may be seen at a glance in Table 4 where the percentages of all 'dominant' pot types, namely those representing at least io% of the assemblage at any one level, are listed. It will be noted that the total of the 'dominant' percentages is inversely proportional to the age, indicating a gradually increasing standardization of the pottery in the later levels. The earliest pottery at Sebanzi is typified by globular pots with banded comb- stamped decoration on the rim. Comparative material is not easy to find; such sherds are unknown in the Kalomo culture, the later phases of which are contemporary with the start of the Sebanzi sequence (Fagan I965) . Comparable sherds have been found in the lower levels of the Ingombe Ilede, Lusitu, dated to the seventh and eighth centuries, but they are rare. The pottery from an as yet unexcavated site at Shakalonga in the Kafue National Park can also be compared to the earliest Sebanzi sherds. In addition pots of this type are present in undated surface collections from sites near the Zongwe River and the Chibulamenda stream in the Gwembe Valley. A few sherds reminiscent of the earliest Sebanzi specimens occur in the small and fragmentary channel-decorated pottery assemblages of the earliest Zambian Iron Age, for instance at Machili (Clark &amp; Fagan I965). A channelling technique is found in the lower levels at Sebanzi but it never represents more than 4% of the decoration. The channelling is, however, much finer than at Machili, the vessel shapes are not directly comparable, and the main</page><page sequence="20">272 BRIAN M. FAGAN &amp; D. W. PHILLIPSON similarity with Situmpa ware is in technique of decoration. The finds from Gwisho show that channel-decorated pottery makers were present at Lochinvar, and we can presume, although no dates are available, that they were living on the Ranch during the first millennium. Undoubtedly there was a considerable time lag between the earliest Iron Age occupation of the Ranch and the initial settlement of Sebanzi; furthermore, our present knowledge of channel-decorated and allied pottery is so exiguous that we feel that there is as yet insufficient evidence for any link between the two assemblages to be proposed. Both in the Northern Province of Zambia and in Southern Rhodesia there is evidence that the earliest Iron Age pottery tradition, based on a combination of channelled and stamped decoration and globular pots and bowls, survived well into the second millennium (Fagan I965). In the Southern Province of Zambia, however, the situation is more complicated. At Dambwa, about two miles north of Livingstone, a site of probable mid-first millennium date has been excavated and has produced pottery (Daniels I964) which has much in common with the Gokomere ware of Southern Rhodesia. In the Southern parts of the Province, the channelled ware tradition was superseded by the seventh century by that of the Kalomo culture, which is typified by fine bands of comb-stamping and simple vessel forms. Further work is needed on the earlier Iron Age cultures of the northern part of the Southern Province before we can come to any definite conclusion regarding the continuation of the Situmpa tradition beyond the early first millennium in that region. The most noticeable trend in the development of the pottery in the lower part of the Sebanzi sequence is the gradual reduction in the numbers of the globular pots with banded comb-stamping decoration, the affinities of which have been discussed above. At the same time there is a corresponding increase in the proportion of incised decoration. This rises from less than 20O in level six to over 8o% in level four. By far the largest group of incised sherds, particularly near the middle of the sequence, is from necked pots decorated below the rim with a horizontal band of diagonal or criss-cross hatching. A further highly characteristic decorational motif is a horizontal band of alternate triangles filled with differential hatching. Vessels of these types are of widespread occurrence in Southern Zambia, and have been regarded as characteristic of the Kangila people who are thought to have occupied the northern part of the Batoka Plateau and to have been largely contemporary with the Kalomo culture further to the south (Fagan I963). Very similar pottery is found in the lower levels (9-7) at the Ingombe Ilede. The complete absence from all parts of the Sebanzi sequence of sherds in any way characteristic of the Kalomo culture confirms the view that there were two separate pottery traditions on the Batoka Plateau during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The indigenous, non-imported, pottery from levels four to two at Sebanzi is almost entirely of 'Kangila' type as regards decoration. There is, however, a very large group of undecorated hemispherical bowls which are almost unknown at Kangila. These pots are present in small numbers in the lowest level of Sebanzi but rise to 6o% of the total pot assemblage in level two. The last major pot type recovered from the Sebanzi excavations is a large necked vessel of which a considerable area is covered with comb-stamping decoration arranged in wide zones and interlocking triangular blocks. Pots of this type appear in small</page><page sequence="21">SEBANZI 273 numbers in level two but rise rapidly through level one and Nabombe, reaching a total of 68% of the assemblage at Kelly's Farm. At the latter site and at Nabombe the blocks of stamping are in many cases outlined by grooves or incisions and are almost indistin- guishable from those on modern Tonga pottery, such as that from Kaleya railway siding, Mazabuka. In describing a complex and changing pottery sequence such as that from Lochinvar it is essential to break up the series and to discuss individual groups and characteristics. A glance at the sequence tables will, however, show that the Lochinvar sequence illustrates gradual but continuous evolution. There are several pot types which endure throughout, often in considerable numbers, as do the undecorated hemispherical bowls and the incised necked pots. Indeed, the major factor behind the development of the Lochinvar pottery, at least from the initial settlement of Sebanzi onwards, appears to have been changing fashion rather than ethnic migration or replacement. External influences may have been present, but there are the strongest reasons for believing that the population of the Lochinvar region has remained unchanged since about A.D. I I00 if not earlier. II The Sebanzi sequence enables us to trace the gradual appearance of pottery almost identical with that of the modern Plateau Tonga. This unequivocal archaeological evidence makes it impossible to escape the conclusion that the Tonga and their ancestors have been living in at least a part of their present homeland for the past nine centuries, if not for longer. We must now attempt to reconcile the new evidence with that from other sources. The Tonga, and the Ila to whom they are related on linguistic grounds, have little or no traditional history extending back further than the middle of the nineteenth century. Their loosely-knit social organization and the disruptive effects of Kololo, Lozi, and Nedebele raids in the last century have both contributed to this state of affairs. David Livingstone, who traversed the Batoka Plateau in I 855, recorded a tradition of a raid on the Tonga by a chief named Pingola who came from the north (Livingstone I857, 553). Since this event is said by the explorer to have taken place before Sebituane and the Kololo entered Tonga country in about I835, Pingola may have visited the Plateau in the previous decade. No earlier oral records of the Tonga have survived, but Smith &amp; Dale (1 920, p. I 8) suggested on linguistic grounds that the Ila-Tonga peoples came from the country around the south end of Lake Tanganyika. Clark (I952) argued that they arrived on the Plateau and in the Gwembe in about A.D. I500 by one of two routes, either down the Zambezi from its headwaters, or from the south end of Lake Tanganyika via the Nyasa tsetse-free corridor, but does not recount the detailed evidence in support of his suggestions. In a recent preliminary report on excavations of eighteenth-century Tonga villages in the Kalomo district, one of us (Fagan I963) suggested, on the basis of their simple political organization and unsophisticated iron working techniques, that the Tonga had been living on the Plateau for at least 500 years. Until Sebanzi was excavated, however, no concrete evidence for Tonga settlement earlier than the eighteenth century had been obtained, and one was obliged to resort to speculation. S R.A.T.J.</page><page sequence="22">274 BRIAN M. FAGAN &amp; D. W. PHILLIPSON There is thus nothing in the anthropological or historical sources to contradict the archaeological evidence from Lochinvar. There are indications from other sources that the Tonga have been living in Zambia for a very long time. Compared with that of the tribes of more recent Congo origin who inhabit most of Zambia to-day, their social organization is rudimentary and lacks the centralized control under a feudal chief characteristic of many Congo tribes. Ethno- historical evidence from the Upper Zambezi Valley has shown that the early Bantu- speaking tribes of that area had but a simple social organization which led to their easy defeat by their better organized successors (White I949); the Tonga were easy prey for nineteenth-century raiders for the same reason. Tonga material culture is simpler than that of their Congo neighbours, who had elaborate iron working techniques as well as skilled wood carvers in their villages. There is every reason to believe that the Tonga have much in common with the earlier rather than later Zambian tribes. The results of the physical anthropologists' studies both of Plateau and Gwembe Tonga living populations and of the skeletal remains recovered from recent excavations in Southern Zambia are as yet unpublished. In preliminary notes on isolated Gwembe Tonga populations, and on a BaTwa group from the Kafue, Tobias (I 958a) drew atten- tion to a number of pygmyresemblances and 'Bushmanoid' traits among the people in ad- dition to Negroid and Mediterranean features. Asiswell known, the earlyIronAge peoples of Southern Africa displayed many Bush features, resulting from intermarriage between Negro and indigenous populations. To-day, Negroid elements predominate everywhere, and the Bush features are not well marked. This reference to the racial characteristics of the Gwembe Tonga and BaTwa, who by their isolation may have preserved the physical traits of earlier Tonga generations, at least does not contradict the archaeological evidence, but must await confirmation when the final results of the Gwembe research are published. At the present stage of research we are unable to throw further light on the origins of the Tonga, but feel that they probably arrived as a result of an early Iron Age population movement from the north or west to the Batoka Plateau. Owing to a paucity of evidence from other sources, we must rely on archaeology to provide us with a date for the arrival of the Tonga. The scanty information from history, anthropology, and physical anthropology in no way invalidates our conclusion that the Tonga have been living in northern parts of the Batoka Plateau since at least A.D.
