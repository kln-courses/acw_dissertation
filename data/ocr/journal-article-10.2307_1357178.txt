ALLEN Egyptian Art Department The Metropolitan Museum of Art 5th Avenue at 82nd St. New York, NY 10028 The Dolphin Vase which was excavated from a Middle Kingdom Egyptian tomb at the capital city of Lisht, is so named because of its naturalistic depiction of dolphins. This pottery jug, dated ca. 1750-1700 B.c., epitomizes the network of international relations of a prosperous period: found in Egypt, the dolphins appear to be Minoan in style and yet the vessel shape and manufacture are of Levantine inspiration. Statistical evaluation of the chemical composition of its pottery ware by neutron activation analysis (NAA) makes it virtually certain that the Dolphin Vase originated in the Gaza region of southern Palestine. Trade relations between the latter region and Egypt, with consequent stylistic and technological exchange, intensified under the so-called "Hyksos, " a Semitic dynasty that controlled the eastern Nile Delta between ca. 1700 and 1550 B.c. ottery, as the most ubiquitous and well- preserved evidence of ancient cultures, has been a mainstay of archaeological interpreta- tion-whether of chronology, social structure, or economic activity such as foreign trade. Increas- ingly, traditional approaches based on stylistic features are being expanded to include scientific analyses. In addition to their importance in re- constructing ancient technologies, such analyses can often provide definitive evidence of when, where, and how a pottery vessel was made and used (e.g., McGovern 1989; Biers and McGovern 1990). This article illustrates the compelling force of one line of scientific evidence-the chemical composition of pottery wares-in establishing the origin (place of manufacture) of pottery. Whereas pottery shapes and decorations were readily trans- ferred between cultures and consciously imitated, ancient potters generally were limited to locally available clays and exercised less control over 31</page><page sequence="2">32 PATRICK E. MCGOVERN BASOR 296 their chemical makeup. Consequently, the chemi- cal composition of a pottery ware can be a very sensitive indicator of origin. The Dolphin Vase (fig. 1) was recovered by a Metropolitan Museum of Art expedition (Mace 1921) in 1921 from Tomb 879 of a Middle King- dom cemetery south of the northern pyramid at Lisht (fig. 2). The pottery vessel is a premier arti- fact of the museum's Egyptian Art Department. The Lisht pyramid and the capital city to its east, known as jt-t3wj in Egyptian ("seizer of the two lands"), were founded by the powerful pharaoh who inaugurated the Middle Kingdom (Dynasty 12), Amenemhet I (high 1979-1950 B.c.; low 1937-1908 B.c.).' Because of the close association of the pyramid precinct and the cemetery, the early excavators unequivocally assigned Tomb 879 to this king's reign. This exact dating, which has since been challenged (below), enabled far-flung chrono- logical synchronisms to be made with other Near Eastern and Mediterranean cultures. Under Amenemhet I and his successors, Egypt conquered territories as far south as the third cata- ract of the Nile in Nubia, and renewed contacts with the Levant. Preeminently at Byblos in Leba- non, the Semitic rulers were buried in full Egyp- tian regalia (Montet 1928-1929); these regalia evidently were gifts or payments in kind from two late Dynasty 12 pharaohs, Amenemhet III and IV (high 1859-1805 B.c.; low 1817-1763 B.C.), in ex- change for cedar and other goods.2 STYLE AND MANUFACTURE OF THE DOLPHIN VASE Reflecting Egypt's strong international position, the Dolphin Vase exhibits a high level of craftsman- ship and a multicultural style. The realistic portrayal of the three leaping dolphins in side profile (fig. 1) captured the imagination of scholars, who argued that dolphins illustrated on Minoan vase paintings and frescoes served as prototypes for those on the Dolphin Vase (Kantor 1965: 23-24, fig. 6; Kemp and Merrillees 1980: 220-25, pl. 31; Warren and Hankey 1989: 135-37). The Minoan and Dolphin Vase representations share idiosyncratic features that differ from those of the common dolphin (Del- phinus delphis), including horizontal wavy lines along the dolphins' lower bodies, perhaps to indicate color banding or the motion of waves; dorsal fins set too far forward relative to the pectoral flippers; and tails that are vertically positioned and fluked rather than horizontal and notched (as communicated in a lecture by L. Onyshkevych, March 1992, University of Pennsylvania). Because the Minoan comparanda have now been shown generally to postdate the Dol- phin Vase (Czernohaus 1988: 8-19, pl. 10: 2-14), however, any stylistic influence must now be seen to have gone in the opposite direction. Significantly, the birds on the vase have no par- allels on Crete. The ten birds, which are arranged in two groups of three and one group of four on the up- per half of the vessel (fig. 1), are variously sized and shown in three-quarter rear profile. Their long necks and tails, erect plump bodies, and fairly well-defined toes, one apparently projecting backwards, suggest a wading bird of the stork, crane, or heron family, al- though a goose cannot be ruled out (Houlihan 1988: 13-18, 22-26, 54-62, 83-88). The jug shape and details-a slightly piriform body; a high, tripartite loop-handle on the shoul- der; and a rim that has been folded outward to form a flat ledge-are clearly related to pottery types that were common in the Syro-Palestinian area towards the end of MB IIA and continuing into early MB IIB (Kantor 1965; Weinstein 1982: 159-60, n. 4), ca. 1750-1700 B.C.3 The base of the vessel, although now missing, was probably a flat disk or ring base, in accord with comparable jugs. Macroscopic and X-ray examination indicates that the vessel was thrown on a wheel from a single lump of clay, only the handle having been at- tached separately to the shoulder with clay wads as reinforcement. The Dolphin Vase evidently benefited from devel- opments in the potter's craft. Following a several- hundred-year "Dark Age" during MB I, urban communities (city-states) began to develop in Pales- tine at about the same time as the founding of Lisht. Unlike the handmade, generally poorly fired, and rather poorly shaped vessels of MB I, the intensive use of the potter's wheel in MB IIA (high 1900-1740 B.C.; low 1875-1730 B.c.) led to the development of a new repertoire of consistently contoured, thin- walled, and evenly fired forms. Decorative effects- including highly polished slips and painted geometric designs-became common. The Dolphin Vase's decoration combines several techniques, which were carried out sequentially as follows: (1) the dolphins' and birds' bodies were painted; (2) the animal bodies were outlined and de- tailed with grooves and lines of dots that punctured</page><page sequence="3">1994 DOLPHIN VASE 33 R5.

Groove-outlined punctate designs, filled with a white material (calcite or calcium sulfate [gypsum]), are best attested for a group of black-burnished jugs and juglets, and less commonly for bird-shaped, fish- shaped, and anthropomorphic forms, which occur at sites throughout the Eastern Mediterranean from middle MB IIA to MB IIC (ca. 1800-1550 B.c.) These vessels are collectively referred to as Tell el- Yahudiyeh pottery, after the site in the Nile Delta where the ware and decoration were described by Petrie (1906: 14-15, pls. 7:3-5, 11-13, 22-26, 35; 8:38-41, 48-50, 52; 8A: 59-66, 68-87). Unlike the "free-flowing" figural design of the Dolphin Vase, geometric motifs (triangles, rhom- boids, etc.) within horizontal and vertical registers predominate among the Tell el-Yahudiyeh types (Kaplan 1980; Bietak 1989). Furthermore, the over- all black coloration of the Tell el-Yahudiyeh vessels was achieved by firing the vessels in a reducing at- mosphere, whereas the purplish-black (Munsell 2.5YR 2.5/2)4 of the animal bodies on the Dolphin Vase is the result of applying a manganese-iron pig- mented paint (Noll 1975) and firing the jug in an ox- idizing atmosphere. The paint layer, which has flaked</page><page sequence="5">1994 DOLPHIN VASE 35 off in places, is clearly separate from the underlying ware, which fired to a reddish-yellow color (Munsell 5YR 6/6-8) under the oxidizing conditions. Another group of painted jugs and juglets, which lack the punctate decoration but are other- wise similar in form and artistic motives to the Dolphin Vase and Tell el-Yahudiyeh types, are also found at sites throughout the Eastern Mediter- ranean (Tubb 1983; Bagh 1988). Referred to ge- nerically as Levantine Painted Ware, this group appears earlier than the Tell el-Yahudiyeh types, dating primarily to MB IIA (high 1900-1740 B.c.; low 1875-1730 B.C). Monochrome paints, gener- ally an iron-based red, are most common; occa- sionally, bichrome red-and-black painted examples occur. Levantine Painted Ware was fired exclu- sively in an oxidizing atmosphere. From this brief review, the Dolphin Vase's com- posite stylistic and technological features are evi- dent. The Tell el-Yahudiyeh and Levantine Painted Ware types also overlap temporally during the transition from MB IIA to MB IIB (high 1740- 1720 B.c.; low 1730-1710 B.c.; see n. 2 above), precisely the time frame that general shape criteria would suggest for the Dolphin Vase. DATING OF TOMB 879 The dating of the archaeological context in which the vase was found poses several problems. Most critically, the tomb-shaft had been robbed in antiq- uity; and the excavators give no information on the precise location of the objects found nor of their re- lationship to one another. The tomb was originally intended for three individuals, since each of the three horizontal chambers, opening from the bottom of the shaft, is just large enough for a single burial and since fragments of at least two coffins and one funerary mask were recovered. The cemetery originally was established in the reign of Amenemhet I for burial of his family and officials close to him. Subsequently, houses for priests and other functionaries involved in his fu- nerary cult were built there. After a period of aban- donment, houses of artisans were built here in the later Middle Kingdom, perhaps as a suburb of the capital. Test soundings by a Metropolitan Museum expedition in 1991, to clarify the results of the ear- lier expedition, showed that the top of the shaft for Tomb 879 was intact under the walls of a later house. While this finding places the tomb within a stratigraphic sequence, it also opens up the possi- bility that the original burial groups were contami- nated by later materials when the tomb was robbed. Despite these uncertainties, the objects from the shaft constitute a homogeneous stylistic group, dat- ing from early to middle Dynasty 13 (high 1801- 1724 B.C.; low 1759-1682 B.c.), in accord with the date range for the Dolphin Vase based on Syro- Palestinian stylistic criteria (above). Gold foil frag- ments, which originally covered the coffins in Tomb 879, are inscribed with mutilated hieroglyphs that date from the end of Dynasty 12 through Dy- nasty 13 (Bourriau 1991: 13; J. Allen, personal communication, June 1993). Native Egyptian pot- tery-several storage jars and a hemispherical bowl with a characteristic maximum diameter to height ratio of 1.4-are typical of the first half of Dynasty 13 (Do. Arnold 1982; 1988). Four Tell el- Yahudiyeh juglets of the Piriform Ic type (Kemp and Merrillees 1980: 220-25, pl. 31) probably be- long to the transition period from late MB IIA into early MB IIB. CHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL ORIGIN OF THE DOLPHIN VASE The Dolphin Vase's unique combination of sty- listic and technological features obviates any une- quivocal determination of where it was made. Was it a local Egyptian product, made at or near Lisht as some argue (Kemp and Merrillees 1980: 220- 25; Merrillees 1978)? Or, was it an import and, if so, from where? Two of the authors (P.E.M. and G.H.) have been engaged in a neutron activation analysis (NAA) project of Middle Bronze Age pottery, including Tell el-Yahudiyeh, Levantine Painted Ware, and polished slip pottery types, as well as the maritime transport storage container par excellence, the "Canaanite Jar" (Grace 1956: 80-109). The physico- chemical method of NAA has been extensively employed in pottery provenience studies, because of its sensitivity and precision in measuring as many as 35 elements, including rare earths that often charac- terize a clay source, and because it requires very small samples (50-200 mg) that are nondestruc- tively analyzed.5</page><page sequence="6">36 PATRICK E.

Relating the chemical composition of a particular ancient pottery sample to a given clay source, there- by "fingerprinting" the pottery and its presumed place of manufacture, is based on what has become known as the Provenience Postulate (Weigand, Har- bottle, and Sayre 1977: 15-34). Briefly, the as- sumption is made that the chemical variation within a given clay source is less than that between differ- ent sources. A native clay, however, was often modified by the ancient potter. Inorganic aplastics (temper) or organic materials might be added to the clay body to improve its workability, drying and firing properties, and functionality (Rye 1981). If these inclusions are relatively "pure" (e.g., quartz, calcite, or straw), the diluent effect on the chemical composition of an ancient sample will be spread across the range of elements and correction fac- tors (e.g., least-means fitting) can be readily ap- plied. The addition of complex heavy minerals, which can unpredictably enhance or diminish cer- tain elemental concentrations, is less easily cor- rected for statistically. A range of univariate and multivariate algo- rithms-means and standard deviations, and correla- tional, clustering, and principal components analyses of a range of elements-is used to define local chem- ical groups of ancient pottery, with widely divergent samples (outliers) being excluded. Archaeological and geological criteria are important in refining and testing these groups, whether well-dated pottery types, clays from specific geochemical regimes, clay beds within a single deposit, or others. For example, cooking pots, walls, and kilns, made of mudbrick (sunbaked clay) are usually made of local clay and are not transported to another site. The NAA analy- ses of such samples should then confirm a hypothe- sized local group based on other pottery types. This approach is essential when an ancient clay source has been totally exploited or systematic clay sampling has not yet been carried out in a region.</page><page sequence="7">1994 DOLPHIN VASE 37 TABLE 1.

To date, an additional 760 pot- tery and clay samples from 55 coastal and inland sites of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel-including Ras Shamra/ancient Ugarit, Tell Kazel, Tell Mardikh/an- cient Ebla, Hama, Byblos, Sidon, Kamid el-Loz, Megiddo, Tel Aphek, Jaffa, Ashkelon, Tell el-CAjjul, Tell Beit Mirsim, Beth Shan, Pella, Jericho, Tell el- Fukhar, the Baqcah Valley of Transjordan, Bab edh- Dhrac, etc. (fig. 2)-have been analyzed. Another 119 pottery and clay samples have been tested from sites along the Middle and Upper Nile-Kahun and Dahshur near Lisht, el-Amarna, Abydos, etc. (fig. 2)-that range in date from the Old to the New King- dom (ca. 2700-1070 B.C.). Previous Brookhaven projects (e.g., Kaplan 1980: Brooks et al. 1974: 48- 80), accounting for 1208 pottery and clay samples from 79 more Levantine and Egyptian sites, complete the data bank for this region. The clays that have thus far been analyzed date from the Lower Cretaceous period to recent times and derive from deposits throughout the Levant and Egypt. The red loess clays of the southern Palestinian coastal region, the yellow limestone-derived clays of the Palestinian hill country, Transjordanian smectites and kaolin clays, Egyptian alluvial and marl clays, etc., are well represented in the data bank. The Old World data bank has excellent temporal and spatial coverage of other regions of the Near East and Mediterranean, including the Sudan, Greece, Iraq, Iran, and parts of Turkey. This wide areal coverage, coupled with large numbers of sam- ples for locally defined groups, enables us to apply powerful multivariate statistics in determining the archaeological origin of the Dolphin Vase. It is quite common for the elements in clays and minerals to covary with one another. For example, the high correlation (&gt; 0.99) of iron (Fe) and scan- dium (Sc), both trivalent ions of about equal size, in nature is well known. Univariate statistics can be very misleading if this relationship goes unrecog- nized. Two Palestinian clay sources of importance in our study-the red loess clay of the southern coast and the yellow hill country clay-have simi- lar univariate distributions, but have clearly distin- guishable Sc/Fe ratios (Brooks et al. 1974: 48-80). If the variance-covariance matrix for many ele- ments of a presumed local group is calculated, a new set of standardized orthogonal coordinates (eigen- vectors) can be defined in multidimensional Mahal- anobis space that takes advantage of elemental correlations (Harbottle 1991: 413-24). For the sta- tistical calculations, the oxide data (table 1) were converted to logarithms, since many chemical ele- ments appear to be lognormally distributed in na- ture, and are also standardized by this procedure (see n. 5 above). The Mahalanobis distance of a given sample from the origin or centroid of the group is di- rectly related to the probability of the group mem- bership of that sample, assuming a multivariate normal distribution (Sayre 1975). Using the oxides of 15 elements in the calculation, it has been esti- mated by comparisons of the large Brookhaven New</page><page sequence="8">38 PATRICK E.

The Mahalanobis distance probability calculations, here indicated by a 95% confidence ellipse for samples belonging to a group, were carried out on the neutron activation analysis data of a large group of Middle Bronze Age pottery imports (labeled P; multiple examples at the same coordinates denoted by +) from the "Gaza group of Middle Bronze Age sites" in southern Palestine, which were found at the Hyksos capital of Avaris (modern Tell el-Dabca) in the northeastern Nile Delta. This group is clearly distinguished from another large group of locally produced Middle Bronze Age pottery made of Egyptian Nile allulvial clay (labeled E) from the same site. The Dolphin Vase (labeled D) is on the periphery of the southern Palestinian group. World pottery data bank (about 10,000 samples) against the Old World data bank (about 5000 sam- ples) that the accidental assignment of a sample at a Mahalanobis probability of 1% is nil for these two archaeologically and geochemically distinct regions (Harbottle 1991). Within a more circumscribed re- gion, such as the Eastern Mediterranean, where the same or related geological processes have been at work, this unique chemical "fingerprinting" is not assured. But with high correlations between many elements, such as is characteristic of Levantine clays and pottery, it is possible to achieve extremely good results. A Mahalanobis probability above 5% for a sample tested against a group with a high sample number to variate ratio is a strong guarantee that it belongs to that group. Using the oxides of 15 elements (sodium [Na], po- tassium [K], cesium [Cs], rubidium [Rb], barium [Ba], scandium [Sc], europium [Eu], thorium [Th], hafnium [Hf], manganese [Mn], cobalt [Co], chro- mium [Cr], iron [Fe], samarium [Sm], and ytterbium [Yb]) and not correcting for dilution or concentration effects, the Dolphin Vase has a Mahalanobis distance probability of 5.6% of belonging to a tight chemical</page><page sequence="9">1994 DOLPHIN VASE 39 group of 268 pottery vessels that were recovered from Middle Bronze levels at Tell el-DabCa (see table 1). These vessels comprise 46% of the Tell el-DabCa corpus that has been tested by NAA, and include 201 Canaanite Jars as well as other Syro-Palestinian types (Tell el-Yahudiyeh, Levantine Painted Ware, and polished slip pottery). Correcting for calcite dilution, the Mahalanobis distance probability for the Dolphin Vase is 8.1%. Thirty-six Middle Bronze Age pottery samples from the so-called "Gaza group of Middle Bronze Age sites"-a number of relatively large city- states centered on Gaza, extending from Tell el- Farcah South to Ashkelon along the coastal plain, and including Tell el-CAjjul, Tell el-FarCah South, Tell Jemmeh, Tel Haror, and Tell Beit Mirsim, and Lachish farther inland (fig. 2)-also formed a tight chemical group with 14 red loess clays of the region (table 1). Using the mean concen- trations of the oxides of 15 elements, the Mahal- anobis distance probability that the Gaza group of pottery and clays belongs to the large, well-defined Dabca group is 98.8%. Remarkably, all other well- defined local groups in the Old World data bank had a 0% probability of belonging to the Dabca group. It is virtually certain therefore that the Dol- phin Vase and the 268 pottery vessels found at Tell el-DabCa were produced in southern Palestine and exported to Lisht and the northeastern Nile Delta, respectively. The Mahalanobis distance probabilities can be partly represented in two-dimensional space by plot- ting the vector scores on any pair of eigenvectors (or principal components) for a group. In fig. 3, for ex- ample, two eigenvectors (denoted 3 and 10), whose variance-covariance matrices are "highly loaded" for Eu/Th and Hf/Mn respectively, show good dis- crimination between the southern Palestinian and Nile alluvial clay groups at Tell el-DabCa. The Mahalanobis distance probability assignment of the Dolphin Vase to the Gaza region of southern Palestine is further borne out by searches for the closest chemical matches in mean Euclidean dis- tance (MED) space (defined as the square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of the differences be- tween the log elemental concentrations of any given pair of samples). Although correlational effects are excluded from this calculation, excellent results can be obtained with 15 elements, because the variance in the MED approaches zero as the inverse of the number of variables (Harbottle 1991). The closest "match" for the Dolphin Vase, with an MED of 0.079, belonged to the Dabca southern Palestinian group.

Dendrogram, based on a hierarchical aggregative clustering algorithm and the neutron activation analysis means of the oxides of 15 elements for each group (table 1). The mean Euclidean distance to each node in the den- drogram is listed along the ordinate. Note that the Dolphin Vase (DOLPHIN) forms a cluster with the red loess clay groups of pottery from the "Gaza group of Middle Bronze Age sites" (labeled GAZAGRP), and the imported southern Palestinian group at Tell el-Dabca (DABAPAL), and a Tell el-Yahudiyeh juglet showing fish or dolphins from Dabca (DABcA; see fig. 5a caption). Another cluster is comprised of two other pottery vessels of Syro-Palestinian types from the Lisht cemetery (LISHT1 and LISHT2; see fig. 5b, c captions) that are made of Egyptian marl clay (FAYMARL). For other selected Egyptian and Eastern Mediterranean groups, see the text, table 1 note, and fig. 2. cally determined to be indicative of group member- ship, especially in conjunction with a Mahalanobis distance probability greater than 5% (above). It would be of interest to know at which Middle Bronze site in the Gaza region the Dolphin Vase was manufactured. While Tell el-CAjjul pottery and red loess clays collected in Gaza yield very high Mahalanobis distance probabilities (exceeding an average of 50% for 23 samples) of belonging to the Dabca southern Palestinian group, the Dolphin Vase's probability was only in the 5 to 10% range. As a peripheral member of the southern Palestinian group (cf. fig. 3), the Dolphin Vase may originate from a site located some distance from CAjjul and Gaza. A definitive answer is elusive, because of the very similar chemical composition of red loess clay in the region. The MED calculations in multidimensional space can also be partly represented by two-dimensional graphical representations, such as the dendrogram in fig. 4 that was generated using an hierarchical aggregative clustering algorithm and the means of the 15 elements for each group (table 1). The den- drogram shows a close chemical relationship be- tween the Dolphin Vase and the Dabca southern Palestinian and Gaza groups. A Tell el-Yahudiyeh</page><page sequence="10">40 PATRICK E.

Other Egyp- tian and Syro-Palestinian groups are very far re- moved in MED hyperspace from the southern Palestinian grouping. RELATED POTTERY VESSELS Two other pottery vessels from the Lisht ceme- tery (fig. 5b, c) are closest chemically to an Egyp- tian marly clay deposit, which outcrops north of the Fayyum (fig. 2) as the Qasr el-Sagha formation of Pleistocene date, not far from Lisht (Tobia and Sayre 1974; also see Said 1962). The jug shoulder and neck fragment (fig. 5b), like the Dolphin Vase, was fired to a yellowish-red (Munsell 5YR 5/6-8) ware in an oxidizing atmosphere, and has a triple- stranded handle, outwardly folded rim, and white- filled grooves running around the shoulder. Only a small part of a geometric design on the body-a white calcite-filled punctate triangle below the han- dle-is preserved. Its production, as well as that of the more standard Tell el-Yahudiyeh bird-shaped rhyton fragment (fig. 5c) in a locally available Egyptian marl clay, using techniques similar to those for the Dolphin Vase, demonstrates that pot- ters with the requisite skills were resident in the Nile Valley by middle Dynasty 13 (high 1724 B.c.; low 1682 B.c.). Major changes in the native pottery industry at Lisht were already evident by the time of the second king of Dynasty 12, Senwosret I (high 1959-1914 B.c.; low 1917-1872 B.c.). Previous studies of the Dolphin Vase have stressed the uniqueness of its animal designs (Kantor 1965: 23-24, fig. 6; Kemp and Merrillees 1980: 220-25; Merrillees 1978), especially the fact that pottery vessels decorated with dolphins are yet to be found in the Eastern Mediterranean or Egypt. Yet, lines of "fish," possibly dolphins, appear on Tell el- Yahudiyeh juglets from Tell ed-Dabca (fig. 5a; above) and Dahshur (Do. Arnold 1977; pl. 4b). Tell</page><page sequence="11">1994 DOLPHIN VASE 41 el-Yahudiyeh bird-shaped (e.g., fig. 5c) and fish- shaped rhyta are also quite common throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and Egypt (Kaplan 1980). If the bird motif on the Dolphin Vase, as well as other stylistic and technological features, are not foreign to southern Palestine, parallels for the dol- phin motif may be expected in future excavations. An ancient potter in the Gaza region would have been familiar with the migrations of large wading birds and dolphins along the Mediterranean coast, which occur today, and might well have combined these motifs in a design during a time of innova- tive pottery production. CULTURAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS Beyond determining where a unique pottery vessel was made, this study contributes to the un- derstanding of cultural and technological develop- ments for a poorly known period in Egyptian history. The deposition of the Dolphin Vase in a tomb at Lisht, the capital of Middle Kingdom Egypt, probably preceded by a half century or less the rise to power of a Semitic population, the "Hyksos" (a term derived from Egyptian hk3w h3swt-"rulers of foreign lands"), at Avaris (mod- ern Tell el-DabCa) in the northeastern Nile Delta. Traditionally, the Hyksos were viewed as foreign barbarians, who stormed into Egypt and destroyed the major cities, including Lisht (see Josephus, AgAp, sect. 14). This NAA study, by determining that the Dolphin Vase belongs to the same chemi- cal compositional group as the vast majority of the imported pottery found at Tell el-DabCa, suggests that trade relations, presumably of a more peaceful nature, initially existed between the Hyksos, the native Egyptian dynasty, and the Gaza region, the nearest region to Egypt with substantive urban de- velopment. The popularity of southern Palestinian stylistic and technological models is reflected in the local production of the imported pottery types, using Egyptian marl clay, at Lisht. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This article, the first in a projected series of publica- tions dealing with Levantine pottery imports into Egypt during the Middle Bronze Age, is affectionately dedi- cated to the late Mrs. Joan Huntoon. Mrs. Huntoon began the large-scale neutron activation analysis project pottery of Tell el-DabCa and Eastern Mediterranean clays and pottery wares and processed most of the samples between 1984 and 1986 at Brookhaven National Laboratory, un- der contract DE-AC02-76CH-00016 with the U. S. De- partment of Energy. The samples from the Dolphin Vase and the two other vessels from the Lisht cemetery were analyzed at the Uni- versity of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR), under the direction of M. D. Glascock, with support from a National Science Foundation grant (BNS-8801707). Statistics, employing the battery of programs developed at Brookhaven, were carried out on the University Museum VAX computer, with the support of P. Chase. The Dol- phin Vase was kindly X-rayed and the paint and white filling analyzed using SEM-EDS (Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive Spectrometry) by A. Heywood and M. T. Wypyski of the Objects Conser- vation Department of The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The drawing of the Dolphin Vase was done by B. Girsh of The Metropolitan Museum. The map and other graphics were prepared by P. Zimmerman of MASCA us- ing CANVAS 4.0 on an Apple Macintosh computer. Ear- lier versions of this article were reviewed by Dorothea Arnold, J. Beaudoin, M. Bietak, S. J. Fleming, M. D. Glascock, and M. Tadmor. NOTES 'Egyptian dynastic dates are according to the cor- rected "high" and "low" options of K. A. Kitchen (1987: 43-44, 47, tables 1, 2; see also the supplement to the colloquium [Kitchen 1989: 152-53]). 2According to Lilyquist 1993: 41-44, artifacts nam- ing these pharaohs are associated with later MB II and even early Late Bronze Age material in some of the Byblos royal tombs. 3The archaeological dating in this article follows the so-called "middle chronology" of J.
