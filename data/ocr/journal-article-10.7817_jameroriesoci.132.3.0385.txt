<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Breaching the Boundaries of Being:   Metamorphoses in the Mesopotamian Literary Texts kaRen sonik univeRsity of CalifoRnia, los anGeles In the mythology of ancient Greece and Rome, the topos of physical transformation is perva- sive: the boundaries between gods, humans, monsters, and animals, and occasionally plants  and inanimate objects as well, are transgressed with ease in the service of seduction, punish- ment, escape, and reward. Zeus takes the form of a bull to seduce Europa, a swan to rape  Leda, and a shower of gold to impregnate Danae. Artemis punishes the hapless Aktaion  for his chance glimpse of her nudity by transforming him into a stag; the lovely Medusa is  turned into a petrifying gorgon by an offended Athena; and the tyrant Lykaon becomes a rav- ening wolf, making visible the natural depravity of his character. More sympathetically, the  sea goddess Thetis, a talented shape shifter, undergoes a brilliant if futile series of metamor- phoses in the attempt to escape the embrace of the mortal Peleus; 1 Artemis saves the terrified  nymph Daphne from Apollo’s lust by turning her into a laurel tree; and Pygmalion’s hope- less love for the statue he has carved from ivory is pitied by Aphrodite, who turns the frozen  form into living female flesh. By and large, those transformations deliberately imposed by  the gods on other entities, unlike instances of typically reversible divine self-metamorphosis,  represent permanent and absolute rather than transitory changes of state: 2 “a departure from  the norm often a transgression—is fixed forever by a change into a non-human state, fre- quently one (as with Lykaon) appropriate to the transgression or abnormality.” 3 The ability  An earlier version of this paper was presented at the American Oriental Society Meeting in 2009 and portions  of this work were presented also at the Capturing Metamorphosis workshop held at the Allard Pierson Museum in  Amsterdam in 2010.

Gods and other entities associated with or residing within the sea are especially closely associated with shape  shifting or monstrous forms not only in Greek mythology, as in the case of Proteus and Thetis, but also in numerous  other contexts, as mariners and adventurers claim the existence of strange creatures in the vast and turbulent depths.  See, for example, Beowulf (548–75), in which the hero alludes to his successful battling of sea-beasts (monsters?)  even prior to taking on the mere-dwelling Grendel: “My flesh was not for feasting on, / there would be no monsters  gnawing and gloating / over their banquet at the bottom of the sea. / Instead, in the morning, mangled and sleeping /  the sleep of the sword, they slopped and floated / like the ocean’s leavings,” Seamus Heaney, Beowulf: A New Verse  Translation (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2000), 36–39. 2. If temporary transformations are rare, they are not unknown: Circe, whose own status as minor goddess,  nymph, or other minor supernatural entity is unclear, uses a magic potion and spell to turn Odysseus’ men briefly  into swine in the Odyssey Book X, though these are restored at Odysseus’ request after he proves himself immune  (through a little help from Hermes) to Circe’s powers. The visual manifestation of this metamorphosis is distin- guished from comparable but irreversible transformations; see Annetta Alexandridis, “Shifting Species: Animal  and Human Bodies in Attic Vase Painting of the 6th and 5th Centuries b.C.,” in Bodies and Boundaries in Graeco- Roman Antiquity, ed. Thorsten Fögen and Mireille M. Lee (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2009), 270–74. Another  famous temporary transformation from Classical antiquity is recorded in Apuleius’ Golden Ass, or Metamorphoses,  in which is recorded the hero Lucius’ metamorphosis into a donkey and, through the intervention of the goddess Isis,  his ultimate restoration to human form. 3.

This suggests a  relative stability and immutability of the boundaries between different classes of being in  Mesopotamia that diverges sharply from the apparent permeability of such boundaries in the  ancient mythology of Greece and Rome. While at least some of the Mesopotamian gods are  described as transforming themselves for specific purposes, as Enlil in Enlil and Ninlil and  Enlil and Namzitara and also, perhaps, as Sîn in The Cow of Sîn, these transformations are  reversed once the goals for which they were undertaken have been achieved. 5 Of rather more  interest here are the instances of permanent metamorphosis, specifically physical transforma- tions of anthropomorphic figures into theriomorphic beings or inanimate objects, conferred  or imposed by the gods whether as punishment, in the course of rendering aid, or on some  private whim. This study considers three such externally imposed metamorphoses from the  surviving Sumerian and Akkadian literary texts. The turning of Dumuzid into a lizard or  gazelle in several texts from the Inana and Dumuzid Cycle; the turning of Bilulu into a water- skin in Inana and Bilulu; and the turning of Ištar’s shepherd lover into a wolf in the Standard  Babylonian Gilgameš Epic are explored in the attempt to define the nature of the boundaries  between different classes of being in Mesopotamia, the common elements involved in the  transgression of such boundaries, and the meaning of such transgressions in the context of  the Mesopotamian world view. 6 Polyxena and the Case of the Rhodian Criminal,” in The Strange World of Human Sacrifice, ed.

(Philadelphia: Univ. of Pennsylvania Press, 1972), 43. Enlil, having been banished  from Nippur for the “rape” of Ninlil, takes the forms of three different figures on his journey to the netherworld, that  of the city gatekeeper, that of the man of Id-kura (river of the netherworld), and that of the man of the ferryboat,  having intercourse with Ninlil and siring a child in each of these forms. The three new netherworld gods created in  this manner are presumably intended as ransom for Enlil himself, for Ninlil, and for the god Sîn (sired by Enlil in  his original form prior to his journey), allowing these three to depart the netherworld. In Enlil and Namzitara, Enlil  features again, this time taking the form of a raven and appearing to the gudu-priest Namzitara, while in The Cow of  Sîn, it is Enlil’s son Sîn who features as the bull that impregnates the cow Geme-Sîn; see, for considered discussions  of these texts, Jerrold S.

Various other types of metamorphosis, including the homologous transformation of Tiāmat’s corpse in  Enūma eliš Tablets IV and V, the various parts of which are used by Marduk to mold the familiar features of the  Mesopotamian landscape; the transformation of the divine Nergal into a bald god with a tic in Nergal and Ereškigal;  and the magical contest (involving a series of apparent transformations) between the witch and the sorcerer in  Enmerkar and Ensuḫgirana, are not treated here but are the subject of a forthcoming publication. A fine distinction  between homologous, aspectual, and radical metamorphoses, the lattermost being the type with which this paper is  concerned and applying specifically to “drastic changes in form and/or substance,” is explicated in William Hansen,  “Foam-Born Aphrodite and the Mythology of Transformation,” American Journal of Philology 121 (2000): 1–19.

This episode appears, with slight variations, in several  of the narratives from the Sumerian Inana and Dumuzid cycle, Inana’s Descent to the Neth- erworld (ID), Dumuzid and G̃eštinana (DG), and Dumuzid’s Dream (DD) among them. 7 Dumuzid, in each of these narratives (Table 1), appeals to the sun god Utu to endow him  with specific theriomorphic features that will allow him to escape his netherworld pursu- ers: the sun god, in each case, hears the appeal and grants the requested boon. The interac- tion between Dumuzid and Utu follows a generally consistent pattern: the hapless shepherd  begins his appeal by raising his hands, even if bound or fettered, to the heavens, a direct  physical appeal to the sky where Utu appears. This is followed by a three-part verbal peti- tion: 1) Dumuzid establishes his claim to aid from the sun god on kinship grounds, married  as he is to Utu’s sister Inana; 2) He bolsters this claim either by detailing the actions he has  taken to establish and maintain this kinship, such as the providing of food for Ningal or for  the E-ana and the bringing of wedding gifts to Uruk, or by appealing directly to Utu in the  sun god’s aspect as divine judge, presumably to recognize the injustice of his current plight  and to aid him in escaping it; 3) He outlines the nature of the aid that he seeks, namely, the  alteration of at least his hands and feet, plausibly read as shorthand for his whole person,  into those of a lizard or of a gazelle that he might gain the speed and agility of the animals  he references, 8 as well as, presumably, their forms as a disguise, and so escape his captors. The shepherd’s plea to the sun god is in each case heard and his tears accepted: Utu con- fers the desired transformation and Dumuzid escapes his captors. Once the purpose of his  transformation has been achieved, however, he returns to his original state so that when the  galla inevitably track him down again, the shepherd must repeat his appeal to Utu to regain  the theriomorphic form and qualities with which he was briefly endowed and attempt another  escape. This last point raises a final point of interest: why does Dumuzid fix on Utu specifi- cally when he seeks to be transformed? Dumuzid, after all, is arguably at least nominally  divine. The fact that he is forced to appeal to the sun god for aid in escaping his quandary  rather than extricating himself from it suggests one of two possibilities: either Dumuzid’s  Enūma eliš,” in In the Wake of Tikva Frymer-Kensky, ed.

Dumuzid is not the only character from the Mesopotamian literary compositions to seek—and gain—the  boon of extraordinary speed: Lugalbanda begs the gift of superhuman swiftness from the monster Anzud, ruler of  the highlands, after gaining the latter’s goodwill in the Return of Lugalbanda; see Claus Wilcke, Das Lugalbanda- epos (Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1969); H. L. J. Vanstiphout, Epics of Sumerian Kings: The Matter of Aratta  (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2003). While Lugalbanda neither names any animals in his request nor  undergoes any sort of visible physical metamorphosis, he is nonetheless transformed through his encounter with  the terrifying hybrid: the latter, notably, is a boundary-crosser both in form (composite) and function (as a monster  serving the cause of Enlil and of order), and so may be unusually well suited to help Lugalbanda transcend the limits  of his humanity. Lugalbanda is permanently altered, becoming something more than a man, if still less than a god,  through his interaction with the monster. </page> <page sequence="4"> 388 Journal of the American Oriental Society 132.3 (2012) request requires the intervention of a more powerful deity than he, and Utu happens to be  handy, or there is something about his appeal that requires the aid of the sun god specifically. The first possibility leads us to consider the nature of Dumuzid’s role in these narratives  in his capacity both as god and as substitute, focusing here on the sequence of events as it  is recounted specifically in Inana’s Descent. As the spouse of Inana, typically one of the  highest order of gods, we might expect Dumuzid to be of comparable rank and power and to  be capable of independently escaping his ultimate unhappy fate. His actual status, however,  is somewhat ambiguous as he straddles the boundary between mortal and divine. 9 Further,  even were he as powerful as his daring spouse, even Inana cannot independently escape  from the netherworld or from its wardens, the galla, forced as she is to fall back upon a ruse  devised by Enki for her resurrection and, ultimately, also upon the provision of a substitute  to take her place among the dead. Regardless of Dumuzid’s divinity or lack thereof, there is  a clear limit to both his power and to that of Inana. 10 This limit takes the form of a stricture,  well known from other Sumerian myths, that precludes any return from the netherworld:  only traditional boundary-crossers such as viziers, messengers, and demons, who necessarily  travel between realms in the course of their duties, are clearly exempted. 11 Gods, even those  of the first rank such as Enlil, appear generally powerless to override or to ignore this impera- tive and those who escape the netherworld once having entered it do so only by exploiting a  specific loophole whereby a substitute is handed over to take the place of the departing god.  In this respect, the substitution specifically described and effected in Inana’s Descent is not  so unusual, and is discussed above in the treatment of Enlil and Ninlil. What is remarkable  is that the substitute, here Dumuzid, attempts to elude his pronounced fate. The fact that he  focuses primarily on kinship as the basis of his claim to aid (ID 368–72), rather than on his  innocence of any wrongdoing (only in DG 28 does Dumuzid explicitly invoke Utu’s role as  judge), suggests that his substitution is a matter of divine convention and not easily protested  9. Alster discusses Dumuzid’s role as a boundary-crosser, a mediator between human and divine, life and  death, desert and sown, in Dumuzi’s Dream: Aspects of Oral Poetry in a Sumerian Myth, 14. 10. The peculiarly human aspect of Inana and Dumuzid in this cycle of narratives has been elsewhere noted,  as by Esther J. Hamori, (“When Gods Were Men”: The Embodied God in Biblical and Near Eastern Literature,  ed. John Barton et al. [Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2008], 129–30), who comments that “these deities are so human  that they engage in divination. Elsewhere in the Dumuzid myths, they also worship their tutelary gods. The larger  theme of a dying god is of course anthropomorphic; the details of this are more so, as Dumuzi’s spirit is apparently  separable from his body after death.” 11. Katz (Image of the Netherworld, 41) concluded that the path to the netherworld runs only in one direction:  “Except for a few divinities who managed to leave the netherworld in exchange for a substitute as ransom, only  evil spirits could leave the realm of the dead and move freely back and forth.” The case of Enkidu in the Sumer- ian composition Gilgameš, Enkidu, and the Netherworld may pose an explicit exception to this rule; see n. 14. In  the Akkadian literary texts, the situation is somewhat different: in Nergal and Ereškigal, for example, of which an  abbreviated Middle Babylonian copy is known, Anu sends his messenger Kakka to the netherworld to tell Ereškigal  of a divine banquet; Ereškigal sends her vizier/messenger Namtar (here apparently not functioning as the harmful  daimon Namtar) to the heavens to receive her portion of the banquet; and the god Nergal, sent to the netherworld  as punishment for slighting Ereškigal, tricks the netherworld’s gatekeeper into releasing him on the pretense that  he is acting as Ereškigal’s messenger. Viziers and messengers are here depicted as overtly capable of negotiating  otherwise firmly established boundaries. A fragmentary and problematic Old Babylonian account of Ningišzida’s(?)  descent to the netherworld appears to record the payment of a bribe as figuring in the god’s release; see W. G.  Lambert, “A New Babylonian Descent to the Netherworld,” in Lingering over Words: Studies in Ancient Near East- ern Literature in Honor of William L. Moran, ed. Tzvi Abusch, John Huehnergard, and Piotr Steinkeller (Atlanta:  Scholars Press, 1990), 289–300. </page> <page sequence="5"> sonik: Metamorphoses in the Mesopotamian Literary Texts 389 or overturned. That Utu does not behave as if he is bound by the same convention, actively  aiding as he does Dumuzid’s attempt at escape, is in such a context extraordinary. 12 An explanation for this apparent anomaly is suggested by the very specific details of the  request Dumuzid makes of Utu, involving the transgressing of boundaries, here specifically  physical ones. Overseeing both the civilized center and the wild peripheral zones, traversing  the heavens by day and the netherworld by night, Utu is a boundary-crosser extraordinaire,  uniquely capable both of negotiating the path between different states of being and of func- tioning effectively in multiple realms. In Gilgameš and Huwawa A (GH A), for example,  Utu acts both as heroic patron, assisting the civilized man of the city Gilgameš as the latter  embarks on a quest to the legendary cedar forest, and as sole custodian of Huwawa, lonely  and friendless monster of the mountain periphery and designated guardian of the cedars. 13 More telling is an episode from Gilgameš, Enkidu, and the Netherworld (GEN), in which  Gilgameš appeals to the god Enki for the restoration of his companion Enkidu. While Enki  accepts this prayer, it is Utu who actually creates the opening into the realm of the dead  that allows Enkidu’s return. 14 That it is specifically the sun god to whom Dumuzid appeals  for help in crossing the boundary between the anthropomorphic and the theriomorphic may  thus be less an accident of kinship than a deliberate choice necessitated by the specific terms  of Dumuzid’s request, which requires the intervention of a legitimate or established divine  boundary-crosser. 15 This hypothesis, while necessarily speculative, is supported by the other instances of con- ferred or imposed metamorphosis discussed here, specifically the transformation of the old  woman Bilulu into a waterskin and of Ištar’s shepherd lover into a wolf, both of which result  from the intervention of perhaps the best known of the divine boundary-crossers, the goddess  Inana/Ištar. inana and bilulu In the case of Bilulu, who is punished for her son’s theft of Dumuzid’s cattle and her pos- sible complicity in Dumuzid’s death, it is Inana who is responsible for killing the old woman  and for transforming her into a “waterskin for cold water” and a protective “goddess” of the  desert in a conferred, if involuntary, metamorphosis: 16 12. This is apparent elsewhere in narratives in which Utu appears as the patron of underdogs and hopeless cases,  and in GEN 238–41, in which Utu is instructed by Enki to bring up (at least) the shade of Enkidu: “Father Enki  helped him (Gilgameš) in this matter, / he spoke to Young Hero Utu, the son born of Ningal: / Now when you make  an opening in the Netherworld, / bring his servant up to him from the Netherworld!” translated in A.

The manner in which Enkidu emerges from the netherworld in GEN has been the subject of some debate:  while the companion of Gilgameš has generally been understood as returning as a ghost or a dream figment, a cogent  case for his return as a living being is suggested by Alhena Gadotti, “‘Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the Netherworld’ and  the Sumerian Gilgameš Cycle” (Ph.D. diss., Johns Hopkins University, 2005), chapter 5. 15. The transformation of the hero Lugalbanda from a simple mortal to a mediator between the human and  divine similarly appears to be a transformation conferred by a confirmed boundary-crosser (in physical form and in  status), the monster Anzud. 16. Noteworthy in this context is the waterskin (ḫalziqqu) referred to in the myth of Ištar’s descent to the  netherworld, which may well represent the corpse of the goddess; see Stephanie Dalley, Myths from Mesopotamia:  Creation, the Flood, Gilgamesh, and Others (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1989), 161 n. 14; see also A. Kilmer,  </page> <page sequence="6"> 390 Journal of the American Oriental Society 132.3 (2012) Holy Inana entered the alehouse, stepped unto a seat, determined fate: “Begone [to Bilulu]! I  have killed you; so it is verily, and with you I destroy (also) your name: May you become the  water skin for cold water that (men carry) in the desert!” 17 That Bilulu is killed and her name destroyed immediately prior to her transformation is sig- nificant, insinuating that not merely death but a wholesale eradication of identity is attendant  on such a radical change in form or state: nothing of the original Bilulu is to remain when  her metamorphosis is complete. This transformation is in striking contrast to those metamor- phoses familiar from Classical mythology, in which, “throughout the change of man to wolf,  woman to tree, youth to nightingale, something perdures, carried by the changing shape that  never completely loses physical or behavioral traces of what it was.” 18  That it is Inana, legendary for treading where she ought not and for traveling between  different realms and states of being, going down to and returning from the netherworld and  experiencing both death and resurrection, 19 who is responsible for Bilulu’s transformation  here is significant. Physical transformation appears best—or perhaps most effectively— mediated by an experienced boundary-crosser. 20 the standard babylonian gilgamEš EpiC The third and final account of imposed metamorphosis to be discussed here is one recorded  in Tablet VI of the Standard Babylonian Gilgameš Epic. Gilgameš, having caught the eye of  Ištar thanks to his great beauty, is made an offer of marriage by the goddess, with attendant  promises of great power and prosperity. Far from being impressed, the hero responds with a  caustic recounting of Ištar’s treatment of her former lovers, both anthropomorphic and the- riomorphic, who have been universally transformed to their detriment through their associa- tion with her (Table 2): Dumuzid has transitioned from the realm of the living to that of the  dead; the speckled allallu-bird is left with a broken wing; the lion and horse suffer physical  mortification and discomfiture; the shepherd is turned into a wolf to be continually driven  “How Was Queen Ereshkigal Tricked?” Ugarit-Forschungen 3 (1971): 299–309. If Ištar (or her corpse) actually  undergoes a physical transformation, it is one that is, clearly, reversible. 17.

Caroline Walker Bynum, Metamorphosis and Identity (New York: Zone Books, 2001), 32. Bynum, dis- cussing metamorphosis in the context of twelfth-century thought, notes an attempt by Gerard of Wales to deter- mine the varieties of mutatio, “inner and outer, nature or substance and appearance, illusion and transformation,  metamorphosis and hybrid,” distinguishing the lattermost two especially as breaching categorical boundaries in  fundamentally different ways, employing and expressing quite different rhetorical strategies and ontological visions  (pp. 18, 28–33). The distinction between transformations of nature/substance and those of physical form (appear- ance), though they may be expressed across a spectrum rather than as a polarity, are important considerations in the  treatment of the metamorphoses from the Mesopotamian literary texts. 19. Inana’s descent and death should not be equated: Inana is specifically killed in the netherworld and resur- rected there before she is allowed to return to the realm of the living. 20. Inana/Ištar is capable of navigating gender boundaries, among others; see Rivkah Harris, Gender and Aging  in Mesopotamia: The Gilgamesh Epic and Other Ancient Literature (Norman: Univ. of Oklahoma Press, 2000),  165–66. It has been suggested also that the gala-tura and the kurgarrû, capable of penetrating the netherworld  in search of Inana, similarly transcend gender boundaries (one of two impassible boundaries, the other being that  between the living and the dead), enabling them to “mediate between and the world of the divine or the dead”; see  Mary R.

In his caution, and his final derisive rejection of her atten- tions, the hero explicitly references Ištar’s peculiar association with metamorphosis and his  own determination not to be so altered: “And you would love me and [change me] as (you  did) them?” 23 Described by Bahrani as “the superlative sign of difference . . . Mesopotamian culture’s  figure of the chaotic and marginal and as such . . . a figure of alterity or otherness,” 24 Ištar  violates cultural boundaries, breaching especially gender codes and expectations as easily as  she defies the borders delimiting different cosmic realms. Associated with her own descent  to and return from the netherworld, she is peculiarly well positioned, as are Utu and Inana, to  mediate physical transformation and Gilgameš is right to fear any close association with her. conclusion The boundaries between different classes of being in the literary accounts of Mesopo- tamia, if less easily transgressed than in the mythology of Greece and of Rome, are not,  then, utterly immutable. While the surviving incidents of imposed physical metamorphosis  are both few in number and briefly developed, there are yet several elements common to  the episodes discussed here that point towards some preliminary conclusions. Perhaps the  most salient of these is the locating of metamorphosis and death on the same continuum in  the Gilgameš Epic, echoing not only the pairing of Bilulu’s death with her physical trans- formation in Inana and Bilulu, a pairing that results in her essential annihilation, but also  Dumuzid’s temporary metamorphosis prior to his death at the hands of the galla. This sug- gests that a permanent change in form, the shifting from one class or category of being to  another—as from human to animal or plant or inanimate object—and the transgressing of the  very firm borders delimiting each of these, is to be understood as the complete effacement  21. The transformation of the unnamed shepherd into a wolf recalls the cruel transformation of the hunter (or,  alternately, shepherd) Aktaion in Classical mythology: Aktaion stumbled upon the naked Artemis and was punished  for his visual transgression by being transformed into a stag to be torn apart by his own hounds. In Ovid’s Meta- morphoses (III 252–58), however, Aktaion’s mind is explicitly left intact even as his body is altered, rendering his  punishment all the more cruel: “But when he stopped and looked into a pool / at the reflection of his horns and  muzzle— / “Poor me!” he tried to say, but no words came . . . only his mind / was left unaltered by Diana’s wrath”;  translated in Charles Martin, Metamorphoses: A New Translation, Contexts, Criticism (New York: W. W. Norton,  2010), 71. It is not clear from the passage in the Gilgameš Epic that the shepherd retains a similar consciousness. 22. While the exact physical defect suffered by the gardener is not clear, George constructs a persuasive if  circumstantial case for it being a form of stunted growth or dwarfism; see The Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic, vol. 2,  835–36 n. 64 on Išullānu, 838 n. 76 on dallālu. This transformation, a disabling of the body, may be compared to the  disguise of Namtar as a bald (and lame?) god with a tic in Nergal and Ereškigal C 31’-32’; see Benjamin R. Foster,  Before the Muses: An Anthology of Akkadian Literature (Bethesda: CDL Press, 2005), 519, both cases representing  negative modifications of the body. 23.

Ištar’s threat to tear down the netherworld and allow the dead to devour the living, made sub- sequent to Gilgameš’ rejection of her in the epic, is strikingly convincing in this context: “I shall smash the under- world together with its dwelling-place, / I shall raze the nether regions to the ground. / I shall bring up the dead to  consume the living, / I shall make the dead outnumber the living,” Gilgameš Epic VI 97–100, translated in George,  The Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic, 624–25. </page> <page sequence="8"> 392 Journal of the American Oriental Society 132.3 (2012) of what had previously existed, so that nothing of the original remains in the new form. This  is a striking divergence from those transformations so familiar from Classical antiquity, in  which something of the original, whether of the form, the behavior, or even the whole of  the mind transported traumatically into a new and alien body, endures. This may explain,  too, why Dumuzid’s metamorphosis at the hands of Utu is in all instances a transient one,  accomplishing a temporary escape only: a permanent physical transformation, while it would  place Dumuzid forever beyond the reach of the galla, would likely be all too akin to the neth- erworld banishment, death, that he seeks so desperately to escape. Certainly it suggests the  need for intervention in the process of metamorphosis by a powerful divine boundary-crosser  who is, as are Utu, Inana, and Ištar, already well experienced in negotiating those treacherous  paths between different realms and states of being.
