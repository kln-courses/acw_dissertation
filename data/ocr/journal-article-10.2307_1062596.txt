The most significant such attempt was that of M. G. S. Hodgson, who recognized that the ghulat "alone in Islam at that time were dealing with problems that Sufis later took up, no doubt with greater success; certain questions about per- sonal religious experience-about revelation, morality and spirit."8 While Massignon, Corbin, and Widengren before him had dealt sym- pathetically with the ghulat, it was Hodgson who observed that in the ghulat speculations "we get a sense of large issues debated." Hodgson also contextualized that observation within an analysis of contemporary institutionalization, which he accomplished with sociological and psy- chological insight.9 These so-called extremists played a pivotal role in the interacting oppositions and counteroppositions that characterized Islam's second century. The fissiparous ghulat represented many political and theo- logical positions, but they were all loyal to the house of 'AlT. The partisans of the lineage of 'AlT ibn Abl Talib, cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, held that 'All had inherited the right to the leadership of the Muslim community. Toward the end of the last years of the Umayyad dynasty (661-750), the 'Alids were struggling to estab- lish their party (shTCa) as the legitimate Islamic authority. According to the later Sunni and ShT'! heresiographers, certain followers of the 'Alid leaders (imams: genealogical and charismatic successors of 'All) attempted to deify CAll, the Imams, and sometimes even themselves. This was rejected as "exaggeration" (ghuluww, "going too far, extrem- ism"; one who does this is a ghalT, pl. ghulat) by both Sunni and Shi'C traditions. 10 Hodgson's insights concerning the importance of these ghulat in the process of Islamic self-definition can be extended and developed by a closer study of the ghuluww of the "first Gnostic of Islam," Mughlra ibn Sa'ld (d. 119/736)." Though many sources on his heresy are 8 Hodgson, "How Did the Early Shi'a Become Sectarian?" p. 5. 9 Ibid., p. 8; and see his updated position in The Classical Age of Islam, p. 379. Massignon, p. 196, observed that the ghulat "tried to understand the visible universe by regarding it, in the light of their new faith, through the prism, 'the stained glass,' of their ancient myths"; and G. Widengren, in Muhammad the Apostle of God and His Ascension (Uppsala, 1955), p. 93, noted: "In the case of the Shl'ah leaders and pre- tenders we could be entitled to speak of a real 'prophetical' consciousness." 10 Hodgson, "How Did the Early Shi'a Become Sectarian," p. 5.

Tucker, "Rebels and Gnostics: Al-MughTra ibn Sa'Td and the MughTriyya," Arabica 22 3</page><page sequence="4">The Moving Finger Writes extant, they are of restricted usefulness in reconstructing his career. The salient facts, sufficient for the purposes at hand, are that he was the leader of a subdivision of the followers of the fifth Shi'C Imam, Muhammad al-Baqir, and that he subsequently led his group in alle- giance to another claimant to the Imamate, al-Nafs al-Zakiyya ("the Pure Soul"). A mawla ("freedman") who spoke ungrammatical Arabic, Mughira taught a doctrine that was barely Islamicized.'2 The content of those teachings was, by any Islamic standard, an exaggeration beyond the pale. On the one hand, he was a magician who described "his object of worship (ma'bibd)" in blasphemously graphic, anthropomorphic terms. On the other, he led an insurrection in which his followers eventually resorted to the terrorist tactics of strangling their opponents. A sorcerer, Gnostic, and revolutionary, MughTra ended his career proclaiming his own prophethood. He was imprisoned, crucified, and burned to death by the Umayyad governor of Iraq in 736. In the following section of this article I will look at MughTra's continu- ity with the beliefs and practices of his non-Islamic milieu. I would call his amalgamation of religions "syncretistic" in Van der Leeuw's sense of "transposition": "the variation of the significance of any phenom- enon, occurring in the dynamic of religions, while its form remains quite unaltered."13 MughTra's central teaching, for example, is an Islamicized revalorization of a quite nearly unaltered Gnostic cosmology-"a wholly Gnostic mythos," to use van Ess's phrase.14 MughTra emerged out of the Aramaic milieu of late antiquity, in which such Gnostic teachings and the syncretistic "transposition" of their forms were common features. Understanding MughTra's precise relation to that milieu is compli- cated by the "free borrowing of formulae" that was rife in the baptiz- (1975): 33-47, which constitutes a useful introduction to the primary and secondary literature. 12 On the deficient use of Arabic by MughTra, see ibid., pp. 33-34; on the deficient use of Arabic by mawalT, see J. H. A. Juynboll, "On the Origins of Arabic Prose: Reflections on Authenticity," in Studies on the First Century of Islamic Society (Car- bondale, Ill., 1982), pp. 161-77, p. 255, n. 9; on Mughira as a mawli, see Tucker, pp. 33-34. The best overview on the question of the mawali is now Daniel Pipes, "Mawlas: Freed Slaves and Converts in Early Islam," Slavery and Abolition 1 (1980): 132-77. 13 G. van der Leeuw, Religion in Essence and Manifestation (New York, 1963), 2: 610-11; and see K. Rudolph, "Synkretismus-von theologischen Scheltwort zum reli- gionswissenschaftlichen Begriff," in Humanitas Religiosa (Stockholm, 1979), pp. 194- 212, esp. pp. 206-10, where Rudolph provides a typology that might be usefully applied to the "taking up" of Gnosticism in early Islam. 14 J. van Ess, "Der Name Gottes im Islam," in Der Name Gottes, ed. H. von Stieten- cron (Disseldorf, 1975), pp. 156-76, p. 172. 4</page><page sequence="5">History of Religions ing communities of late antique and early Islamic Mesopotamia.ls These communities have recently been studied in depth and in their full context as a chapter of Michael Morony's monumental Iraq after the Muslim Conquest. Morony details the presence of Marcionites, Manicheans, Mandeans, and various gnosticized pagans in seventh- and eighth-century Iraq. He observes that it was particularly the Gnostic traditions associated with the town of Mada'in that were continued in groups such as MughTra's "with a vocabulary that was barely Islamic." 16 Morony is sensibly cautious in coming any closer to identifying the exact group from which MughTra emerged. Whether MughTra's ideas were originally cast in the mold of Christian-Aramaic (Syriac speakers), Jewish-Aramaic (speakers of the Aramaic of the Babylonian Talmud), or "Pagan"-Aramaic (Mandaic speakers) cannot certainly be discerned, in part because MughTra represents that folk interconfessionalism of magicians who, whatever their birth and up- bringing, self-consciously and facilely draw on all available traditions. Both as sorcerer and as Gnostic, Mughira was working in a line of Aramaic syncretists who drew from teachings near and far and who apparently considered anything from the arsenal of available numina as legitimate ammunition for their wonder-working and for their propaganda.17 15 See J. C. Greenfield, "Notes on Some Aramaic and Mandaic Magic Bowls," Journal of the Ancient Near Eastern Society of Columbia University 5 (1973): 149-56, 150: "It has become almost a dogma in this field of research... that the use of a particular script-Jewish, Mandaic, Syriac, etc.-indicated that the scribe and the person for whom the bowl was written adhered to a particular religion. The occurrence of certain formulae in a variety of script types was taken to indicate that there were certain shared syncretic magic beliefs common to all these religions and a free borrow- ing of formulae." MughTra explicitly professed such an interconfessional doctrine; see 'Izz Al-Din ibn al-Athir, al-Kamil fil-Ta'rikh (Beirut, 1965), 5:209: "He said the prophets did not differ in anything regarding the divinely revealed laws." 16 Michael Morony, Iraq after the Muslim Conquest (Princeton, N.J., 1984), p. 501; and see L. Massignon, "The Origins of the Transformation of Persian Iconography by Islamic Theology: The Shl'a School of Kufa and Its Manichean Connexions," in A Survey of Persian Art, ed. A. U. Pope and P. Ackerman (London, 1938), 5:1928-36, 1931-32: "The requisite conditions [for the Manicheization] of the Shl'a are to be found in Mesopotamia, for it was an Aramean country with a social structure that had already been subjected to strong Iranian influences"; cf. W. M. Watt, The Formative Period of Islamic Thought (Edinburgh, 1973), pp. 46-47. 17 C. Gordon, in a letter quoted in J. Neusner, A History of the Jews of Babylonia, 5 vols. (Leiden, 1970), 5:217, says, "There is no way of sharply distinguishing in detail Jewish from Christian from Mandaean magic. Magic is highly interconfessional." There is no question that the syncretistic tendencies of Gnosticism were extremely popular in late antiquity; see R. M. Wilson, The Gnostic Problem (London, 1958), p. 263: "In short, Gnosticism in the broader sense is a general tendency of the period which saw the birth of Christianity, and makes its presence felt in various ways in all the thought of the time"; cf. B. Pearson, ed., Religious Syncretism in Antiquity (Missoula, Mont., 1975). 5</page><page sequence="6">6 The Moving Finger Writes The most detailed evidence we possess for this mixed milieu of MughTra's are the Aramaic incantation bowls, which were found in Mesopotamia and are dated to the time just prior to the Islamic con- quests. Many of these bowls were found buried in the corners and thresholds of houses as prophylaxes against demons and against spells cast by other magicians, who are explicitly cursed for this purpose in the bowls.'8 Mughlra's own superstition about the spirits of houses should be seen in this light: "Abfi Mu'cwiya, on the authority of A'mash, said, 'Mughlra came to me. And when he came to the threshold of the door, he jumped into the house. So I said to him, "What's your problem?" to which he replied, "These walls of yours are harmful."'"19 The bowls may also have been used for hydromancy, which MughTra was also said to have practiced (tamwTh).20 MughTra's own complex relation to water suggests that he may have originated in a baptizing community, the surviving example of which would be the Mandeans. Like the Mandean demiurge, the Divine Man of MughTra's cosmogony creates both light waters and dark waters and creates mankind out of these waters.21 MughTra also professed what appear to be specifically baptismal cultic practices. Thus, the passage cited above from al-Dhahabi continues: "Then he said, 'Blessings on the one who drinks water of the Euphrates.' So I said, 'Do we have anything else to drink from?' He said, 'Not if menstrual blood and corpses are thrown into it.' I said to him, 'From where do you drink?' to which he replied, 'From a well.'... I asked him, 'Where do you get this doctrine?' He said, 'I met one of the people of the House [ahl al-bayt] and he slaked my thirst with a drink of water and there remained nothing but I knew.' 22 Less explicitly, a frequently repeated 18 See J. A. Montgomery, Aramaic Incantation Texts from Nippur (Philadelphia, 1913); C. D. Isbell, The Corpus of Aramaic Incantation Bowls (Missoula, Mont., 1975). Montgomery, p. 41, says that the bowls were "primarily a domestic phylactery, to be classed with the abundant forms of this species of magic, e.g., the Jewish Mezuzoth"; C. Gordon, in Adventures in the Nearest East (London, 1957), translates a bowl that guards "threshold, residence and house, threshold of this Farukdad" (p. 163), where it also guards against "Aramaean spells, Jewish spells, Arabic spells, Persian spells, Mandaean spells, Greek spells, spells of the Romans...." 19 Shams al-Din Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Dhahabi, Mizan al-l'tidalf Naqd al- Rijal (Cairo, 1963), 4:161. (All translations from non-English sources are mine.) 20 For the arguments that they were used for hydromancy, see E. Yamauchi, Mandaic Incantation Texts (New Haven, Conn., 1967), p. 55; and al-Dhababi, 4:161. 21 On baptizing communities, see now K. Rudolph's survey Antike Baptisten: Zu den Uberlieferungen uber friih-jidische und christliche Taufsekten (Leipzig, 1981).

Koenen, "From Baptism to the Gnosis of Manichaeism," in The Rediscovery of Gnosticism, II: Sethian Gnosticism, ed. B. Layton (Leiden, 1981), pp. 734-56, p. 748, points out that "in ancient Persia we find a combination of the use</page><page sequence="7">History of Religions tradition about Mughira reports that he "used to forbid water from the Euphrates or any river or spring or well into which pollution had fallen."23 Related to the apotropaic bowls and the purity beliefs concerning waters are other purity beliefs of Mughira's that are characteristic of the Aramaic milieu. One Abui Halal asks Jacfar al-Sadiq, "Do nosebleed, vomit, and armpit hair nullify ritual purity?" to which Ja'far replied, "Why are you meddling in such matters? This is the doctrine of Mughira, God curse him."24 He also allowed the women of the house of Muhammad to pray even when menstruating. Here again we find the mention of menstruation, which was a concern for ritual pollution in the Babylonian Talmud, among the Mandeans, and in the inscriptions on the bowls.25 With Mughira the ancient taboo is overridden by the superior purity of the house of Muhammad, an example of the old ways that Mughira transformed in his new version of Islam. Thus, Mughira asserted control over his followers through his pro- nouncements on cultic solidarity by way of extraordinary ablutions as well as by absolution from ordinary pollution. He also extended his influence through his theatrically deployed wizardry. al-Tabari recounts Mughira's attempt to lure an onlooker into participating in his mind- reading virtuosity: "A man from the people of Basra appeared among us looking for knowledge. He stayed with us, so I ordered my slave girl (one day) to buy me a fish for two dirhams. Then the Basran and I rushed off to Mughira. MughTra said to me, 'O Muhammad, would you like for me to tell you why your eyebrows are parted in the middle?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'Then would you like me to tell you why your household called you Muhammad?' I said, 'No.' He then said, 'Did you not send off your servant to buy you a fish for two dirhams?'"26 Another more cryptic report about him is that he "used of water for ritual purification with a prohibition of defiling the water"; for his sources, see pp. 745-54, with other useful materials on "The Living Waters and the Turbid Waters." 23 al-Tustari (n. 4 above), 9:81. 24 Ibid.; cf. The Apocryphon of John, trans. F. Wisse, in The Nag Hammadi Library, ed. J. M. Robinson (New York, 1981), p. 107, where the "right armpit" is created by "Abitrion." 25 For the Mandean concern with menstrual discharge, see W. Foerster, ed., Gnosis, 2 vols. (Oxford, 1972-74), 2:307; E. S. Drower, The Secret Adam (Oxford, 1960), p. 68; so too the Sabians, according to Ibn al-NadTm, were concerned with the impurity of menstruation (The Fihrist of al-Nadim, trans. B. Dodge [New York, 1970], 2:748); on the Talmudic discussion of menstruation, see tractate Niddah; in the Sefer Ha- Razim, trans. M. Morgan (Chico, Calif., 1983), p. 59, the "impurity" of the menstruat- ing woman nullifies the success of the Jewish magician. 26 Abui Ja'far Muhammad ibn JarTr al-Tabari, Ta'rTkh al-Rusul wal-Mulik (Cairo, 1960), 7:128-29. On the theatrical aspects of the wonder-working holy man, see 7</page><page sequence="8">The Moving Finger Writes to go out to graveyards and speak and was seen as something like a locust on the graves."27 His most frequently reported claim is, "Should I wish to revive 'Ad and Thamuid and QSarun and the generations between them, I could do so."28 He is variously accused of performing nTrinjat (feats of ledgerdemain), makhariq (feats of sleight of hand), sihr (sorcery), sha'badha (jugglery), and tamwTh (hydromancy).29 He is also accused of claiming to know and to be able to utilize the Greatest Name of God.30 All these motifs are well known from pre- Islamic and non-Islamic Aramaic traditions, and Mughira intention- ally drew on them, with their advantageously hoary numinousness, as appeals from antiquity. MughTra's claim was not only that he could reveal things unseen or that he could communicate with the dead, for example, but that he could even reanimate the dead. His self-proclaimed powers to raise the dead can be understood as a key to his theosophical system. Here I agree with Hodgson's observation about the closely related ghilT Abuil- Khattab: "But perhaps more interesting than these disputes about revelation and prophecy were the disputes recorded among several of Abiil-Khattab's followers over the nature of death- and so of the spirit."31 MughTra and some of his followers claimed not to die and elaborated the then-nascent ShT'ite theory of raj'a (the return of the Imam), that great conquest of time. He taught that the returned MahdT would resurrect a certain elite: "He will restore to life seventeen men and give each one of them one of the letters of God's Greatest Name and they will rout armies and possess the earth."32 As a professional P.

Muhammad ibn al-Nu'man al-Mufld, Irshad, trans. I. K. A. Howard (London, 1983), p. 544: "Before the one who will arise (al-qii'im) there will be red death and white death; there will be locusts at their usual time and at their unusual time like the colors of blood"; in Mishkat al-MasabTh, trans. J. Robson (Lahore, 1964), 3:1142, locusts will be the first of one thousand species to perish at the end of days. There may be a Jewish source for these traditions; see, e.g., IV Ezra, trans. B. Metzger in The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, ed. J. Charlesworth (Garden City, N.Y., 1983), 1:517-61, 530: "We pass from the world like locusts and life is like a mist." 28 See, e.g., al-Tabari, 7:128. 29 For nirinjat and makhariq, see al-Ash'ari, 1:72; for sihr, see al-TabarT, 7:129; for sha'badha and tamwTh, see al-Dhahabi, 4:161. 30 al-Ash'arT, 1:72; see also J. van Ess (n. 14 above). 31 Hodgson, "How Did the Early Shi'a Become Sectarian?"

Widengren (n. 9 above), p. 93 and n. 4, points out that MughTra alone of the ghulat leaders, whose many tortures and executions at the hands of the authorities are well recorded in the literature, renounced his claims. On his teachings on the raj'a, see al-BaghdadT, p. 54 8</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions magician, Mughira's self-proclaimed knowledge of and power over death was a kind of claim beyond history that was freely accessible-for a price, presumably-in the contemporary bazaar. His knowledge of ghaib (the unseen) and the ancient Name of God, therefore, provided him with a means not only to raise funds and to raise armies but even, so he said, to raise the dead. All these accounts highlight MughTra's strikingly ramified continuity with the magical and ritual beliefs of his non-Islamic milieu. This continuity can also be traced in MughTra's appropriation of a magicoreligious appellation found in numerous non-Islamic sources, which he applied to himself. This name, in its Islamic guise, constitutes a significant hint for establishing a meaningful explication of his crea- tion myth. Either MughTra himself was given or he gave to a follower the laqab ("nickname") "al-Abtar" ("the one with tail docked, the one cut off, the childless"). The sect descending from this al-Abtar, the Butrlya, was later classified as among the earliest ZaidTya.33 None of the con- flicting etymologies of the nickname, however, is convincing.34 None of these Arabic etymologies, naturally, refers to the most likely source of the name, which was in fact a widespread, variously employed religious appellative. It is in this context that we would understand the association of MughTra with the various forms of the name abtr. There is a British Museum incantation bowl that is meant to drive off, among others, Satan, "Abtur-Tura," and Lilith, while another Aramaic bowl against and also p. 55, where his follower claims not to die; see P. Kraus, Jdbir ibn Hayyan (Cairo, 1942), 2:199ff., on the number seventeen, and p. 222, esp. n. 9, on other sources; and see Henry Corbin, "La Science de la balance et les correspondances entre les mondes en gnose islamique," in Temple et contemplation (Paris, 1980), pp. 67-142, p. 119,n. 86. 33 MughTra bestows this nickname on his follower KathTr, a founder of the ButrTya (see Abu Sa'Td Nashwan al-Himyar?, Al-Hiur al'Ayn [Cairo, 1948], p. 156); in an account cited by al-TustarT (9:83), which al-TustarT attempts to discredit, Mughlra's laqab is "al-abtar." This group seems to have retained certain gnosticizing features (see Watt [n. 16 above], pp. 162-63 and 349, nn. 44-47). A later Butrite is condemned for his use of the terms nur ("light") and zulma ("dark") (see Massignon, The Passion of al-Hallaj [no. 4 above], 1:315). In his bureaucratic secretary's manual, MafatTh al- ' Ulum written ca. 977, al-Khwarizml lists the first of the ZaidTya as the "Abtariyya, stemming from Kuthayyir al-NiibT who had the name al-Mughira b. Sa'd and the laqab al-Abtar ("the childless")" (this translation is by C. E. Bosworth in his "Al- Hwarazmi on Theology and Sects: The Chapter on Kalam in the MafatTh al-'Ulim," Bulletin d'etudes orientales 29 [1977]: 85-95, 90). 34 See the traditions collected in FadTlah 'Abd al-'Amir al-ShamT, Ta'rTkh al-Firqah al-ZaydTyah bayna al-Qarnayn al- ThnT wal- Thalith lil-Hi/rah (Najaf, 1975), pp. 297- 302; al-ShamT agrees with the traditions deriving ButrTya from a laqab rather than from any apocryphal use of the root btr. 9</page><page sequence="10">The Moving Finger Writes Lilith from sixth-century Nippur lists fourteen names of Lilith, begin- ning "Lilith, Abitar, Abiqar...."35 In Thamudic, abtr was a divine epithet.36 But it was the Mandeans who apotheosized this sometimes demonic, sometimes divine potency. Friedlaender has recognized that the image of MughTra's Divine Man looking down into the dark waters to create is an echo of such Mandean imagery as: "When Life ... had thus spoken, Abatur rose and opened the gate. He looked into the Dark Water and at the same hour was formed his image in the Dark Water."37 In eighth-century Mesopotamia, the Audians, a sectarian family relation of the Mandeans, held a belief markedly similar to statements both of MughTra and of the Mandeans themselves, a relationship important for tracing the passage of the name abtr. According to Theodore Bar Khonai, the Audians quote the Apocryphon of John on the angelic creators of the body: "My Wisdom has made the hair; the Intelligence has made the skin; Elohim has made the bones; my Royalty has made the blood; Adonai has made the nerves; Zeal has made the flesh, and Thought has made the marrow."38 This is a synopsis of the passage in the Apocryphon of John that includes the creation of the "right underarm" by an angel called "Abitrion."39 The 35 E.

Puech, "Fragments retrouv6s de 1'Apocalypse d'Allogene," in En quete de la gnose, 2 vols. [Paris, 1978], 1:271-94). In an appendix to En quete de la gnose (1:295- 98), Puech conclusively demonstrates this connection with four new Nag Hammadi texts (see S.

Van den Broek, "The Creation of Adam's Psychic Body in the Apocryphon of John," in Studies in Gnosticism and Hellenistic Religions, ed. R. Van den Broek and M. J. Vermaseren [Leiden, 1981], pp. 38-58). 10</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions Mandeans are similarly graphically physiological: "The First Semen is thus glorified and a force more sublime than any of the forces which develop from it, for it is marrow, it is that which is formed before all other mysteries, and then seven [sic] others follow, the bone, flesh, sinews, veins, skin and hair."40 These may explain a statement of MughTra's: when asked by al-Sha'bT, "How does the love of 'AlT oper- ate?" MughTra answered, "In the bone and the nerve and the sinew."41 This allegorizing of the physical body, which can be traced back in this form at least to the second-century Apocryphon of John and which is developed by the Mandeans, can be seen as homologous with the cosmogonic potency of the Divine Man of Mughira, especially in regard to his phallic symbolism. Werblowsky has commented on its relation to Jewish mystical tradition and has observed that the phallic symbolism of Mandean gnosis is significantly not attached to the Primal Adam but to the "Abatur of the Scales."42 With the Mandean Abatur, as in the Apocryphon of John, and in Mughira's doctrine, the divine anthropomorphization's "cosmogonic potency" also carries with it eschatological implications. The Mandean Abatur, then, is associated both with the demiurge's dualistic creation of a good versus evil universe and with the judgment of the dead-"Abatur ... weighs and unites the soul with the spirit."43 The fullest mythological framework provided by Mughira for all these practices and claims was his notorious cosmology-with its crowned Man of Light creating mankind out of two waters and writing their future acts of belief and unbelief on his palm with his finger-all of which abounds with echoes of Mandean cosmological themes. The striking representation of his "Object of Worship" has drawn more attention from scholars than any other aspect of his doctrine. While it has been frequently cited, however, no scholar has utilized the full battery of available sources for a comprehensive analysis of this late survival of classic gnostica. When reconstructed, the full cosmology is 40 Drower (n. 25 above), p. 76. The symbolic homology of body and cosmos, in which the seven planets create seven parts of the body, was taught in Edessan Hermetic circles and by the Sabians of Harran (see H.

Goldziher already commented on it; see his Kitab ma'anT al-nafs (Berlin, 1907), pp. 26-27; and also L.

Levine's appendix "The Language of the Magical Bowls," in Neusner [n. 17 above], pp. 343-76, p. 345, n. 1); it should also be noted that Jewish Merkabah physiognomic texts "refer to certain letters of the alphabet the shape of which is believed to be inscribed in various parts of the human body" (I. Gruenwald, Apocalyptic and Merkabah Mysticism [Leiden, 1980], pp. 222-23). 47 A good overview of the instances of its usage is J.

In his scholia, Bar Khonai describes the doctrines of the Dosteans, of whom he states that "in Mesene they were called the 'Mandeans,"' using their own books as his sources for so doing.49 Their cosmology is a drama of creation starring the potencies Ptahil and Abatur, whom he specifically names. The eighth-century Syriac doctor begins his description this way: "They said that before the heaven and the earth were there were great powers resting on the waters. They had a son whom they would call Abitour."50 The coincidence of name, doctrine, place, and date would all support a possible connection with Mughlra.51 I am not arguing that the variants of the root cognomen abtr and the term "Great Power," found in different languages and religions over a period of several centuries, were all understood in the same way by each of these communities. But I would argue that the wide distribu- tion of these religious designations throughout the Aramaic milieu out of which MughTra emerged, a milieu that was notably syncretistic and that freely transmitted ideas and images through translations, would have been the likely source of his own use of these terms. MughTra's repertoire, then, was drawn from a baptizing, gnosticizing Aramaic community, closely resembling if not identical with the Mandeans, from whom he extracted useful materials for his ritual beliefs, his sorcery, his thanatosophy, his cosmology, and his very name.52 The kind of community from which he emerged has recently 49 Theodor Bar Khonai, Scholies, trans.

Quispel, "Demiurge in the Apocryphon of John," in Nag Hammadi and Gnosis, ed. R. M. Wilson (Leiden, 1978), pp. 1-34, p. 8 discusses the motif of "looking down into the dark water"; cf. Quispel's "Judaism, Judaic-Christianity and Gnosis," in The New Testament and Gnosis, ed. A. H. B. Logan and A. J. M. Wedderburn (Edinburgh, 1983), pp. 46-69, on this motif in relation to creation and to the creation of a mirror image or shadow. See also H. Jonas, p. 162: "The mythic idea of the substantiality of an image, reflection, or shadow as representing a real part of the original entity from which it became detached. We have to accept this symbolism as coming to those who used it for a crucial phase in the divine drama"-the looking into the waters and the creation of shadows are of course essential to MughTra's creation drama. 51 The passage from language to language did not seem to be an insurmountable problem for those in gnosticizing circles, who sometimes hypostatized what they mis- understood: Scholem has pointed out that, in the Hekhalot texts, "one of their more unexpected features is the recurrence of rudiments of certain Greek formulae and standing expressions, which the editors in Babylonia were no longer capable of under- standing and apparently regarded as magical names of the divinity" (Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism [New York, 1972], p. 53). 52 Friedlaender, "The Heterodoxies of the Shiites in the Presentation of ibn Hazm, Part 2" (n. 4 above), pp. 80-85; and Tucker (n. 11 above), pp. 39-43, collect a number of the more striking parallels. 13</page><page sequence="14">The Moving Finger Writes been studied in some detail. This work was stimulated by the discovery of the Cologne Mani Codex, written in such a community some four centuries before MughTra. One of the editors of this text, Albert Henrichs, has synthesized a typology of such a community. It is inter- esting to note that Mughira's background coincides with six of the eight points of agreement that Henrichs has elaborated between the Elkesaites, the Mesopotamian baptists, and the community evidenced in the Manichean Cologne Mani Codex.53 What, then, was Mughira's original religion? While Mandean elements predominate-and it was precisely in these years that the Mandean reformers were organizing their community-the coinci- dences with Henrichs's typology lead me to hesitate in too strongly identifying Mughira as Mandean. Other factors militate against such an identification. The most problematic of these factors are the Manichean, Jewish, and Gnostic material that can also be discerned in the doctrines and activities of Mughira. It is true that, like Mandeanism, which was achieving its definitive character in these years, Mughira's religion is an amalgam that com- prises demonstrable elements of Jewish, Gnostic, Manichean, and native Mesopotamian mythologies, in a baptist context. Mughlra's Islam is meaningless without understanding MughTra himself, not only as a Mesopotamian baptist, but also as a Mesopotamian prophet: like the Mesopotamian prophets Elkesai and Mani before him, MughTra brings a Gnostic message linked with, but ultimately lying outside, the established schools of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. MughTra's imaginal "syncretism," based on letter elementalism and cosmogony, derives from the Aramaicized multicultural matrix of late antique Mesopotamia, one of whose distinguishing features was this kind of transposition of forms. His overt continuation of such features resulted in the creation of his infamous cosmological myth. This aggressively Gnostic mythologizing, true to its own past, was revolutionary for Islam. The extent to which this gnosticizing was extensively propagated in the eighth century is only now coming to be fully appreciated. Students of early Islamic gnosis, indeed all historians of religions, therefore have reason to rejoice over the recent publication of Heinz Halm's Die islamische Gnosis.54 If one compares the many texts concerning the 53 Albert Henrichs, "Mani and the Babylonian Baptists: A Historical Confrontation," Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 73 (1973): 23-59, 47-56. There is at least some evidence of Mughira's coinciding with all but number two (Eucharist) and number four (Sabbath), both elements that were rejected by Islam. 54 Halm, Die islamische Gnosis (n. 5 above). 14</page><page sequence="15">History of Religions ghulat translated and annotated by Halm in that excellent work with the elaborate descriptions of the eighth century gnosticizers found in Bar Khonai and ibn al-NadTm, one cannot escape the impression of extensive Gnostic sectarian activity in the eighth century. MughTra, certainly, was far from alone in his efforts to gnosticize Islam. As one of the more powerful rebellions, however, his is a useful example of the ghulat's politicization of gnosis within the medium of Islam. The ghulat are the first-and, in significant ways, the least Islamic- of the Gnostics of Islam. As the full extent of their continuity with non-Islamic gnosticizing movements is coming to be appreciated, we are only now beginning to sort out these various currents as they were manifested in the ghulat. Morony, for example, details the intensive reformations taking place among such Gnostic groups as the Mandeans, the Manicheans, and the ghulat in eighth-century Iraq. Considered as a whole, these assertive reorganizing movements constitute a virtual failed takeover of Islam by what Hans Jonas calls the "Gnostic Reli- gion." I would be so bold as to suggest that the history of the "Gnostic Religion" should be reevaluated with this acute eighth-century politici- zation in mind. It is only with this gnosticizing background in mind that the Islamicizing of MughTra makes sense. In the following discussion I hope to explain how MughTra applied his non-Islamic mythos to Islam. The reception of his gnosticizing alloy resulted in a spectacular debacle: a closer examination of this near-total rejection should help us understand the failure of Islamic gnosis as a political force. MughTra's group, by definition, followed their mercurial leader's direction. He started out, so far as the evidence allows us to judge, as a proponent of the Imamate of al-Baqir. At some point after his rejec- tion by that Imam-which may have been precipitated by his declaring the Imam a god-he proclaimed the Imamate of al-Nafs al-Zakiyya and may even have declared him to be the Mahdi. I agree with Tucker that MughTra must also have declared himself to be a prophet of the MahdTal-Nafs al-Zakiyya. This means that MughTra probably claimed to be both the rightful Imam and a prophet: the Mughiriyya after his death were characterized, in part, by their recognition of his prophetic Imamate. The evidence, then, suggests that MughTra began as a fol- lower of the Imam al-Baqir, switched allegiance to the Imamate of al-Nafs al-Zakiyya, and ended his career claiming the Imamate for himself as a prophet of the MahdT al-Nafs al-Zakiyya. This brief outline of his allegiances is sufficient background for pro- ceeding, now, to show how Mughira interfused his myth with the political materials at hand. Though the full myth is tripartite, I will discuss here only the description of his "Object of Worship" with which 15</page><page sequence="16">The Moving Finger Writes it begins and the anthropogony with which it concludes. The former shows that, for Mughira, the very body of the creator, encoded with letters, was a symbol to be deciphered. He then applied a similarly radical symbology, by means of allegorically understood Qur'anic proof texts, in his anthropogony. Thereby, he wrote his sect into the origins of humankind. The centerpiece of MughTra's revelation is the figure of the creator. Here, reconstructed from several reports, is one description: "He is a man of light, with a crown of light on his head, He has the body and limbs of a man. His body has an inside, within which is a heart, whence wisdom flows. His limbs have the shape of the letters of the alphabet [abjad]. The mTm represents the head; the sTn the teeth; the sad and dad the two eyes; the 'ain and ghain the two ears; as for the ha, he said, You will see in it a Great Power, and he implied that it was in the place of the genitalia and that he had seen it; the alif was in the place of the foot. 55 It is beyond the purview of the present study to analyze fully the important associations that can be drawn between this representation and certain others.56 For the moment, I would only want to indicate 55 A full description of MughTra's demiurgic, crowned Man of Light must be re- constructed from scattered reports, esp. Mutahhar ibn Tahir al-Maqdisi, Al-Bad' wal- Ta'rTkh (Tehran, 1942), 5:140; al-Ash'ari, 1:72; and al-Baghdad? (n. 32 above), pp. 49-50. Ibn Hazm (see Friedlaender, "The Heterodoxies of the Shiites in the Presentation of ibn Hazm, Part 1" [n. 4 above], p. 59) and al-Athir ([n. 15 above], 5:208) shy away from even reporting the specific blasphemy. For a related Gnostic description of the divine figure, see Irenaeus's Adversus haereses (on Marcus the Magician), trans. in Foerster, ed. (n. 25 above), 1:205; and for a related Jewish example, produced roughly contemporary with MughTra, see M. S. Cohen, The Shi'ur Qomah: Liturgy and Theurgy in Pre-Kabbalistic Jewish Mysticism (Washington, D.C., 1983), passim, and p. 217, n. 6, for the genitalia; cf. The Apocryphon of John (n. 24 above), p. 108; and for an important discussion of the iconography of divine sexuality, see now L. Steinberg, "The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion," a complete issue of October (25 [Summer 1983]: 1-222). 56 To do this properly one would need to start by closely comparing this text with such related "visions" as that of Marcus's "Body of Truth" in Irenaeus, the Mandeans' Primal Adam, the several surviving "lettered man" gems, and the Jewish visionary materials, esp. the Shi'ur Qomah. MughTra's vision has several features in common with the Shi'ur Qomah: both visions begin from the feet and move upward (by contrast, Marcus's vision shows the Alpha on the head); the heart is the only internal organ mentioned; the genitals are specified. These important differences also should be noted: the Shi'ur Qomah's godhead is covered with names, not letters, and is not a demiurge, as is Mughira's. But Cohen's locating the Shi'ur Qomah in sixth- to seventh-century Babylonia at least places it in Mughira's milieu. Two other Jewish texts stand in some uncertain relation to these depictions of the divine body. In Sefer Yetzirah, some versions state that the organs of the body are assigned letters, as discussed in D. Cohn- Sherbok, "The Alphabet in Mandaean and Jewish Gnosticism," Religion 11 (1981): 227-34, 231. In Sefer ha-Bahir, para. 42, the letter he is linked with Prov. 10:25, which may be an adumbration of the later Sefirotic symbolism of yesod. It seems certain now that Heinrich Graetz ("Die mystische Literatur in der gaonischen Epoche," Parts 1, 2, 16</page><page sequence="17">History of Religions that Mughira's "Object of Worship" points-with his finger, as it were-to the alphabet mysteries of his sect. The body of the divine potency is a system of esoteric symbols. This apotheosis of the figura- tive powers of language has especially important implications, I believe, for the development of ta wTl, the allegorical interpretation of the Qur'n. Some of the earliest examples of this allegorical interpretation can be found in the last section of Mughira's myth. This section follows after a cosmogonic middle section that shows all the elements of the universe being created out of dark waters and light waters. The anthropogony proper then describes the creation of 'All, Muhammad, and the Caliphs Abu Bakr and 'Umar. These Caliphs are depicted as demons who rebel against God and plot to undermine the rightful glory of 'AlI.57 This full-blown Gnostic origins myth is indeed, in Corbin's phrase, the "prologue in heaven," but twice over, for the implicit rebellion of the sun and moon in the cosmogony is recapitulated in the explicit rebellion of the Caliphs Abi Bakr and cUmar in the anthropogony. Mughira thus manipulates traditional Gnostic cosmological motifs to form a new polemically tendentious drama. The three stages of this cosmology can in fact be seen as reflections of his real innovation: the migration from Gnostic preoccupation with origins so long prevalent in late antiquity to the momentous sectarian division underway in second-century Islam. He retains these traditional motifs-the King of Light and the creation of waters-usefully lit with an ahistorical numinosity, and redirects them in the interests of the hour, thereby shedding old light on the new struggle. His 'Alid allegory rests on his mystic vision of the primordial crea- tion of Muhammad and 'All. This vision mandates the divine authori- zation and empowerment of 'Al, whose shadow is created alongside that of the Prophet himself as the first of men. This divinizing of 'All-and thereby of his lineage-is balanced with a requisite demoniz- ing of the Caliphal opposition to cAll's line. Mughira was said to be the first to abuse the Caliphs 'Umar and Abu Bakr.58 Mughira, indeed, goes so far as to imagine, in his myth, that the anti-'Alid forces are 3, Monatschrift fur Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judenthums, o.s., 8 [1859]: 67- 78, 103-18, 140-53) was incorrect in assigning priority to the Muslim anthropomorphic texts.

Barb, "Three Elusive Amulets," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institute 27 (1964):1-9, 5-6. 57 Compare Tucker, p. 41, where he translates the cosmogony and anthropogony in al-Ash'ari's version. 58 al-Dhahabi (n. 19 above), 4:161. 17</page><page sequence="18">The Moving Finger Writes precisely the universal forces of evil: he concludes his myth with the "revelation" that the Caliph 'Umar is Satan. This reaching for extreme examples is typical of MughTra's symboliz- ing procedure. The same can be seen in his several allegorical readings of the Qur'an, some of the earliest surviving examples of allegorical exegesis in Islam. The report of the ninth-century Mu'tazilite al- Nashi' stresses that this allegorizing was a distinguishing feature of MughTra's innovations: "MughTra published [waCda'a] an interpreta- tion of the Qur'an that he called 'knowledge of the esoteric' and that diverged from what Muslims accept. He asserted that the Qur'an is entirely composed of symbols [amthali and cryptic hints [rumuz] and that mankind cannot learn anything of its mystical meanings but through him because of the power invested in him by the Imam."59 Mughlra's allegorizing, the ultimate "text" of which is the alphabetic Powers on the divine body, was applied to the Qur'an and to the political divisions of second-century Islam with equal impunity. As I have tried to show, MughTra's most complex interfusion of symbol techniques and political doctrines is found in his transforma- tion of non-Islamic cosmogonic materials into "Islamic" myth. The desire that can be read in that story-to extend the import of his message into the very origins of things, to "primordialize" his message- is a gauge of his marked inclination to resort to "ultimate" referents for his metaphors. His projecting of his immediate situation into the first cosmic kairos was seen to be an excessive extension of metaphor (al- ta wTl al-ghal).60 The heresiographers often point to a particularly blatant form of such a reading when they characterize the heresy of ghuluww. The distinguishing characteristic that they frequently specify is tafwLd ("entrusting, turning over to").61 Ghulat used this term to cast Muhammad and/or 'AlT as demiurges, who were "entrusted" with the creation of the world after the initial creation was begun by God. 'All was especially favored for this demiurgic role-and not only in the conception of the Sunni heresiographers, for whom the ghulat were 'Alid loyalists run amok. MughTra may have held such a doctrine.

Mashkur in Sa'd ibn 'Abd Allah al-QummT, Kitab al-Maqalat wa al-Firaq, ed. M. Mashkur (Tehran, 1963), pp. 238-39. In the ghulat revision of the Gnostic demiurge, one is reminded of the observation made by Jorge Luis Borges: "It may be that universal history is the history of the different intonations given a handful of metaphors" (Labyrinths [New York, 1962], p. 192); see, on this notion, the index of Halm's Die islamische Gnosis, s.v. "To1n," "Uqbar." 18</page><page sequence="19">History of Religions addition to the testimony of his myth, it is also reported that MughTra claimed to have ascended to heaven, where God anointed him on the head and said to him, "Go, my son, to earth, and tell its inhabitants that 'All is my right hand and my eye."62 This may be the absolute extreme to which MughTra went in order not only to Islamicize his gnosis but also to take the demiurge of gnosis and turn him into the First Imam.63 This was ledgerdemain that could not go undetected. Mughira's transmutation of the myths and techniques of his milieu was not mere spellbinding but a threatening revision of the funda- mental materials of earliest Islam. In the following section I will analyze the consequent rejection of this "transformation" by the Islamic leadership of his day. To do this I will first review the Imami reaction to MughTra as a "Satan" and as a false prophet and will then conclude with a discussion of the ways in which MughTra's schism came to be associated with that of the Islamic Antichrist, the "Dajjal." A few citations from the extensive and vehement refutations of MughTra in ImamT literature will suffice to show that MughTra was seen there as subversive of the true Imami tradition. One such report, related by the sixth Imam Ja'far, the son of Muhammad al-Baqir, describes the way MughTra tried to insinuate his teachings into those of the Imams. "MughTra used deliberately to lie against my father. He studied the books of the companions of my father. MughTra's followers, whose identities were concealed from my father's companions, studied my father's books and turned them over to Mughira. MughTra would then smuggle kufr [unbelief] into them as well as zandaqa [generally used for dualism, sometimes used specifically for Manicheanism], which he would attribute to my father. MughTra then turned these back over to his followers and ordered them to promulgate them to the Sh ia. "64 The ImamT reports are usually couched in terms of denunciation. There are many variants on the tradition that Ja'far said, "MughTra lied about my father: May God make Mughira feel the heat of iron."65 A frequently repeated curse of the Imamis answers the Qur'anic ques- tion (26:221-22), "Shall I tell you on whom the Satans come down?" 62 al-Maqdisi, 5:140. Cf. J. Texidor, The Pagan God (Princeton, N.J., 1977), p. 12, on the officers of the Persian emperor called "the eyes of the King." 63 There is an apparently demiurgic quotation from the followers of MughTra cited in al-QummT, p. 77: "They say 'We only call Him Creator [Khaliq] when He creates; Provider [Raziq] when He provides; and Knower ['clim] when He knows." One is reminded here of the Gnostic trinity of Father, Mother, and Son. (See A. Bohlig, "Triade und Trinitat in den Schriften von Nag Hammadi," in The Rediscovery of Gnosticism, ed. B. Layton [Leiden, 1981], 2:617-34.) 64 al-TustarT (n. 4 above), 9:79. 65 Ibid., pp. 77-78. 19</page><page sequence="20">The Moving Finger Writes with the names of seven of the ghulat, one of whom is Mughira.66 A similar recourse to the Qur'an as a proof text is the report that al- Baqir said, "Do you know to whom Mughira is akin?... He is like Balaam, 'to whom We gave Our signs, and he departed therefrom, and Satan followed him, and he was of those who were beguiled.'"67 It is instructive to note that these last two traditions are themselves examples of the allegorical exegesis of the Qur'an turned against MughTra. The Imams, in these reports, are particularly aggrieved over Mughira's corruption of their traditions. But this was only one aspect of his sin in their eyes. They were undoubtedly angry at him for at least two other reasons. The first is that he openly deified 'Ali and his descendants. In the midst of the delicate political situation of the Imams in the second Islamic century, this is a doctrine that they would naturally have discouraged. Indeed, they actively repressed any form of this "fanaticism." Mughlra's fellow ghalT Bayan ibn Sam'Cn, who rebelled alongside Mughlra, sent a message to Muhammad al-Baqir proclaim- ing himself a prophet: al-Baqir made the messenger eat the message.68 The other reason is related to the first. Mughlra, in promulgating his myth, must have revealed certain "secrets." The Imams' renunciation of Mughira may have been so vociferous because the schismatic published (wada'a) what was intended to remain "knowledge of the esoteric" ('ilm al-batin). This must have been the case with Mughira's use of allegory, the books containing the secrets of which were in the possession of the Imams. And these transgressions may be what lies behind the statement that "MughTra and his followers considered all the taboo [activities] permissible."69 It was particularly during the "crisis of Ja'far" that the Imams began to enforce secrecy: "No one is truly a Shi'ite of Ja'far but he who has sewn up his tongue [i.e., who observes the discipline of initiatic secrecy; the kitman]."70 66 Ibid., p. 81. The translation of the Qur'an is taken from A. J. Arberry, The Koran Interpreted (1955; reprint, New York, 1970), 2:75. It is perhaps not surprising that this demonizing condescension should have affected the tone of Orientalists. Thus the nineteenth-century Dutch scholar de Goeje is approvingly quoted by E. G. Browne concerning an extremist ShCi! agitator just subsequent to MughTra: "To attain [his ends] a conjunction of means was devised which may fairly be described as Satanic" (A Literary History of Persia [London, 1902], 1:394). 67 al-TustarT, 9:80. 68 W.

Several reports indicate that hisfirqa must have accumulated a substantial amount of wealth. One of the pretenders to the leadership, Bakr al-A'war al-Hijri Qatat, "lived on the wealth of the Mughiriyya, making fools of them."73 Perhaps the clearest indication of his "revealing hidden things" as a kind of fund-raising technique can be found in this report from al-Athir: "Mughlra went to Muhammad al-Baqir and said to him, 'Admit that you know hidden things [al-ghaib] so that I may raise taxes for you in Iraq.' He rebuffed him and drove him off. So Mughlra went to Baqir's son Ja'far and said the same to him, to which he replied, 'God forbid!'"74 The Imams were loathe to endorse Mughlra's "public works." For all these reasons, Mughlra's career shows how the Gnostics were violently rebuked in attempting to infiltrate Islam. I have demon- strated above that the ghulat were abominated by the Imams. I should also want to emphasize that, as a result of this, the powerful extremist revolts had the indirect effect of drawing the Imamis closer to the Sunnis. It is true that the Imams' utter repudiation (barai'a) of the first Caliphs (reflected in Mughlra's myth) was retained as ShT'T doctrine. And yet the Imams, in rejecting undesirables such as MughTra, implic- itly united with the Sunnis against a common enemy. Thus the ShTl's, to prove that they were not so "far out" as the Sunnis accused them of being, could quote the tradition that the Prophet said, "The religion of 71 al-TustarT, 9:79; Jewish magical traditions flourished in Mesopotamia, esp. in the sixth to the eighth centuries (see Ira Robinson, "Jacob al-Kirkisani on the Reality of Magic and the Nature of the Miraculous: A Study in Tenth-Century Karaite Rational- ism,": in Truth and Compassion, ed.

His execution came little more than a decade before the fall of the Umayyads, during the critical tenures of the fifth and sixth Imams. Other than in small enclaves, his creation of a new Islam was repudiated by all Muslim groups. Perhaps because his rejection comes at a turning point in Islamic history, Mughira is mirrored in much of the polemic and counterpolemic, myth and revisionary myth, that went along with the dynastic battlings. As the very image of one who rejects "the true religion"- variously defined-Mughira's fate can be traced through- out the valorizations and revalorizations of rejection. According to some of the most reliable early sources, MughTra himself is said to have coined the opprobrious term "rejectors" (rafi.da/rawafid).76 The sources clearly describe how the gulf widened between Ja'far and MughTra between 732 and 737.77 By the early 730s, the term "Rafida" was already being used derogatorily against the 'Alids. This term, as Kohlberg has brilliantly demonstrated, though indeed originally a nomen odiosium, was by the time of Ja'far also used by the Shl'is as an honorific meaning "those of the Shi'a who rejected evil."78 In later centuries, as Kohlberg shows, the Shl'Ts elaborated this revaluated use of the term by writing it into ancient history: the spiritual ancestors of the Shi'a, in these stories, had always rejected evil. This hierohistory, its older torsions so much like those of the moment, was created to revaluate already loaded terminology, as was commonly being done in many other connections in the eighth century. As MughTra did in his anthropogony, the Imams also revalorized and "primordialized" rafd. Another dimension of this revaluation and mythicization can be detected in certain reports concerning Mughlra and Ja'far. At the time of al-Baqir's death, "the party of Ja'far utterly repudiated the Mughiriyya from the Shl'a, and the party of Ja'far rejected [rafa.du] Mughira and cursed him: and so Mughira said that the party of Ja'far 75 Ghalib, ed., 4:249. 76 M. Mashkur, "An-NawbakhtT: Les Sectes Shi'ites," Revue de l'histoire des reli- gions 154 (1958): 67-95, 92-93, n. 8, gives sources. "Rafida" in Sunni usage was a pejorative epithet referring to the sin of rejecting Abu Bakr and 'Umar and came to be extended to refer to various ShiTC groups, particularly the ghulat, the ImamTs, and the Zaidis. For an overview of the Sunni use of the term, see W. M. Watt, "The Rafidites: A Preliminary Study," Oriens 16 (1963): 110-21. 77 al-QummT, p. 77. 78 E.

He, MughTra, was the first one to have called them by this name."79 The Shicis, then, not only inverted the meaning of this charged term in their hierohistory but also, and in yet another sense, ascribed its origin to their archenemy Mughira. A use of the term from the time of the schism of MughTra adds a final twist to its torsions, a third way that the Imams warded off this calumny. The Imams deflected this derogation toward the ghulat, thereby, again, implicitly locating themselves closer to the Sunnis. An example of this manipulation can be found in a ShTc' chronicle. Dis- cussing al-Baqir's relations to Mughlra, the author details al-Baqir's fury at MughTra's deification of him. Al-Baqir would have killed him, the author says, had he but the authority (sultan) to do so: "So al- Baqir cursed MughTra and his companions and dissociated himself from him and from his doctrine. He wrote to his supporters and to his party and ordered them to repudiate Mughlra's followers and to dis- sociate themselves from them, taking refuge in God [from them]. Al-Baqir went to great lengths in cursing them, and he called them the Mughiriyya al-Rafida because of their [the MughTriyya's] rejection [rafld] of him and because of their [the MughTriyya's] acceptance of what Mughlra said, and these were the real rafida [rafida bi-al-haqTqa]."80 The Imams were at pains to show that the ghulat, and not they, were the real rejectors of true Islam. But the ImamT demonizing of that rejection was not the only weapon used in the battles of the imaginal that accompanied those of the sword. Islamic self-definition was achieved in part in a war of metaphors, and both major parties at times inflated their opposition with cosmic dimensions. It should therefore not be surprising to find that, just as MughTra dared to identify 'Umar as the Devil, so did 'Umar's successors, the Sunnis, call MughTra and his ilk something worse than "Rafida." The Sunnis, in fact, evolved a mythic response that was more durable, and probably more effective, than straightforward opprobrium. I refer to the conceptual conflation of the ghulat with the image of the ultimate "rejector," the Dajjbl. The Dajjal is the Muslim counterpart of the Christian Antichrist and the Jewish Armilos.81 An "anti-Messiah" who emerges in the eschato- logical battles (fitan) that mark the coming of the MahdT, he resists 79 al-Qummi, p. 77; and Mashkur, "An-NawbakhtT," pp. 92-93 and, esp., 99, n. 8, for other sources. 80 Ghalib, ed., 4:248. 81 D.

Traditions about the Dajjal are included in all collections of hadith. These traditions contain elements-his wonder-working, pretense to divinity, and militarism-that reflect to some extent characteristics of movements contemporary with the collector/authors of these traditions. Images of rebels of the first Islamic centuries do survive in both Imaml and Sunni collections of fitan and malahim, in some cases rather unassimilated. Thus, some chiliastic hadith contain such details as "another ruler whose name is Jahjah, a man of the mawall, who will usurp the leadership at the end of days."82 The traditionist Muslim relates many traditions about those in Iraq not paying their taxes, because non-Arabs prompted them not to, as a sign of the last hour.83 Another standard feature is the aforementioned hadTth infitan that the Dajjal will be followed by seventy thousand Jews of Isfahan, wearing Persian shawls.84 The temporary supremacy of non-Arabs is empha- sized repeatedly in fitan hadTth as being characteristic of these last conflicts.85 All these concerns represent the fears of the eighth-century CAlid and Sunni hadith traditionists, as Goldziher demonstrated.86 Those em- ployed in building the then-emerging institutional consensus undoubt- edly rejected subversions such as MughTra's. It may be due, in part, to this reaction that there came to be incorporated in both Sunni and Shl'C traditions numerous reflections of the uprisings. Goldziher cites, as an example, a ShT'T rebel who said, "The Prophet did not fail to mention one single leader of rebellions, he named 300 chieftains who will appear up to the end of the world."87 These traditions, and many more like them, associate the last days with the dramatic increase in the number of militant enemies of Islam. The first place to look for the specific conflation of the imagery of the rebel MughTra with that of the "anti-Messiah," the Dajjal, is in the early, curious linkage of the Dajjal with the name "Abtar." A number of old traditions, beginning with one in the Qur'an itself, do make this association, and this may indicate that this ancient name already pos- sessed eschatological overtones in earliest Islam. Since the state of source-critical analysis of early Islamic texts does not yet allow preci- sion in terms of chronology, I can only hope to show that MughTra was 82 I.

The shortest sara in the Qur'an, al-Kauthar ("Abundance," a stream in paradise), comprises an allusion to a heavenly vision with eschatological overtones. In the recent translation of Mahmoud Ayoub it reads in its entirety: "We have surely given you abundance! / Pray, therefore, to your Lord and offer your sacrifice. / Surely he who hates you, he shall be cut off [hiwa al-abtar]."88 I would argue that this sara refers in fact to the confrontations recorded in hadTth between Muhammad and ibn Sayyad, a Jewish youth whom Muhammad accused of being the Dajjal, in which the Prophet attempts to defeat his adversary with questions about hidden things.89 Ibn Sayyad is acknowledged by the Prophet to be correct in describing "the Dust of Paradise" as "white flour, pure musk."90 Muhammad had seen this Kauthar on his mi'raj; ibn Sayyad had seen his vision also on a heav- enly ascent. That Sfurat al-Kauthar refers to these visions of paradise seems certain: that its Sitz im Leben is the Muhammad-ibn Sayyad encounter would seem to be confirmed if the last iya (verse) refers to ibn Sayyad. We know, though, that ibn Sayyad denied Muhammad's accusation that he, ibn Sayyad, was the Dajjal because, like the Dajjal, he was childless.9' It would appear, then, that the al-abtar as a hapax legomenon in the Qur'an is in fact an epithet indirectly referring to the Dajjal. Another eschatological use of "Abtar" is found in ibn KathTr's Nihiayt al-Bidiya wa al-Nihiya, which is rich in chiliastic traditions. "'AlT said, concerning the Dajjal, 'He is Safi ibn Sayyad who will emerge from the Yahiudya of Isfahan on an ass, Abtar.'"92 This report would seem to be an early conflation of, if not the Vorlage for, on the one hand, the association of Dajjal with ibn Sayyad and, on the other, 88 Mahmoud Ayoub, trans., The Great Tiding, Interpretation of Juz CAmma, the Last Part of the Qur'an (Tripoli, 1983), p. 146; for the eschatological context, see "The Pond and Its Intercession," in Mishkat al-MasabTh (n. 27 above), 3:1179-95; for some of the tajasrr on the meaning of al-abtar, see Isma'Cl ibn 'Umar ibn Kathir, TafsTr al-Qur'in al 'Azrm (Cairo, 1347 A.H.), 9:312-18; and Fakhr al-Din al-RazT, Al-TafsTr al-KabTr (Cairo, n.d.), 32:132-35. 89 See Halperin, pp. 216-17. 90 "The Pond and Its Intercession," p. 1179. 91 Halperin, p. 222. 92 Isma'l ibn 'Umar ibn Kathir, Nihayat al-Bidaya wal-Nihaya (Riyadh, 1968), 1:161; and cf. the encounter with the Dajjal ibn Sayyad in the SahTh Muslim, when he produced a "sound like a braying donkey" (Siddiqi, trans., 4:1515); that the tradition in ibn Kathir is weakly supported strengthens the case for its sectarian origins; another parallel with Mandean traditions in this hadith is the dark and the white mountains (see G. Widengren, "Iran and Israel in Parthian Times with Special Regard to the Ethiopic Book of Enoch," in Pearson, ed. [n. 17 above], pp. 85-131, p. 117, n. 4). 25</page><page sequence="26">The Moving Finger Writes the association of Dajjal with the Jews' quarter of Isfahan.93 In Shl'! collections 'All is frequently named as the transmitter of such tradi- tions, as he is of the tradition of the Dajjal on the ass "Abtar."94 Likewise, Isfahan may be specified as the location of the event in the ShTl' sources because, as al-Maqdisl suggests, it was the site of opposi- tion to CAll. An explicitly 'Alid association of abtr and the Dajjal can be found in a major Twelver Shl'i history of the Imams, the Irshad of al-Mufid. Here, there would seem to survive distant if still clear echoes of al-Baqir's rejection of Mughlra: "Al-Baqir said, 'When the Qa'im ("Resurrector") rises, he will go to Kufa and some 10,000 persons called the Batriyya (Butriyya) who will be bearing arms will come out (against him).'"95 In addition to these associations of abtr with the Dajjal, numerous other resemblances can be found between the stories about MughTra and those about the Dajjal. Thus, the Dajjal bears letters-k, f r, for Kafir (or Kufr)-on his forehead, a possible echo, with inverted valence, of Mughira's lettered Divine Man's figure.96 Mughlra describes eschatological battles, seventeen resurrected men empowered with the seventeen letters of the Greatest Name of God: MughTra claimed to be able to revivify the dead, as did the Dajjal, as a proof of his powers.97 MughTra also describes the MahdT's reappearance exactly as it is described in hadTth.98 One of MughTra's disciples is described as A'war, blind in one eye, as is the Dajjal.99 MughTra frequently is 93 Abu Nucaim, Dhikr Akhbar .sfahan, ed.

The writing of the name "Antichrist" on the forehead of the Antichrist is found in Christian apocalypses (see J.-M. Rosentiehl, "Le Portrait de l'Antichrist," in Pseudepigraphes de I'ancien testament et manuscrits de la mer morte, ed. M. Philonenko et al. [Paris, 1967], pp. 45-60). 97 al-Baghdadl (n. 23 above), p. 54; Mishkat al-MasabTh, 3:1148-49. Some Christian apocalypses deny that the Antichrist can raise the dead. See, e.g., "The Apocalypse of Elijah," trans. O. S. Wintermute, in Charlesworth, ed. (n. 27 above), 1:721-53, p. 745: "He will do the works which the Christ did, except for raising the dead alone. In this you will know that he is the son of lawlessness, because he is unable to give life." (I would like to thank Bernard McGinn for pointing out this reference.)

All this is not to say that Mughlra was alone the model for the Dajjal. The ibn Sayyad stories predate his rebellion. Nor is he the only rebel to provide a prototype for the Endtime antagonists-Abu 'Isa al-Isfahani, ibn Sayyad, ibn Jahjah, the Butriyya, and others do so as well. But the imagery of Mughlra is conflated with that of the Dajjal/ ibn Sayyad on so many levels that he must have been imagined as a consciously echoed "twin" of the Dajjal. The armed rebellion of a wonder-working half-blind liar, a forerunner of the final defeat at the hands of the MahdT, a manical rejector and extremist-all are features shared in the family resemblance between those two enemies of Islam. Thus, the ghulat, among the most militant factions of eighth-century Gnostic revolutionaries, were subsumed, half-disguised, into that great roman a clef in progress, the eschatological drama of the Dajjal. As such, the implicit identification of contemporary revolutionaries with Endtime factions has long been ensconced in the assumptions of Muslim theologians. Such assumptions lay behind the perceptions of the prosecutors of al-Hallaj, the tenth-century Sufi saint who was executed as a Dajjal.'02 A millennium later, a modern ShV'T historian of religions, writing a biobibliographical notice on MughTra, begins by saying that he was an "innovator-deceiver" (dajjal mubtadi').103 Mughira has survived as a kind of Dajjal, then, both implicitly, in myth, and explicitly, in the assumptions of the tradition. * * * Attempts to gnosticize Islam did not end with the mid-eighth- century defeats of MughTra and his fellow ghulat. Halm has studied the ramified survivals of Gnostic motifs in later Islamic groups such as the Ismca'ils and the Nusayris. The politically dominant traditions of Islam did unequivocally define Islamic gnosis out of their consensus. 100 al-TustarT (n. 4 above), vol. 9, passim; Halperin, p. 218; al-DhahabT (n. 19 above), 4:161. 0oi Halperin, pp. 219-20; and, e.g., al-AthTr (n. 15 above), 5:209. 102 Massignon, The Passion of al-Hallaj (n. 4 above). 103 al-QummT (n. 61 above), p. 184. 27</page><page sequence="28">The Moving Finger Writes This self-definition frequently made use of the powers of mythiciza- tion, portraying one's own group or one's opposition as acting at the beginning or end of history. However effective this device was, enclaves of Islamic Gnostics do remain a part of ongoing Islamic his- tory. Some Ismai'lTs of the upper Oxus still revere the Umm al-Kitdb (Mother of the book), a scripture containing markedly MughTrite teachings. 104 Ghulat such as Mughira are therefore particularly instructive cases to be studied for a better understanding of the conceptual and institu- tional dialectics through which Islam defined itself. Both in mythicized polemics-the institutionalization of ghulat as the archetypal nemesis of both the Shl'a and the sunna-and in polemical mythos-the pro- jections of the ghulat into the imagery of Satan and the Dajjal-the successfully dominant definers of Islam projected second-century struggles into the timeless categories of perpetual, inevitable, and ulti- mate opposition. It is precisely in this negative institutionalization, this mythologizing of the primal enemy, that the case of MughTra is espe- cially illuminating. MughTra, in his smuggled Gnostic traditions, him- self mythicizes a cosmogonical rebellion, his "prologue in heaven." Muslim traditionists, both Sunni and Shi'l, seem to have been aware of attempts of Mughira's, which they projected as an eschatological rebellion, as the "epilogue on earth," an ultimate confrontation of the faithful mythologically homologized with that of Satan and even the Dajjal himself. Mughira and the Islamic Gnostics took up a pre- Islamic mythos and attempted to Islamicize it: authoritative Muslim traditions, in effect, invert this failed attempt at Islamicization and mythicize it as the last, worst enemy of Islam itself. MughTra's Islamic gnosis was only revered in sectarian enclaves, while he himself came to be submerged in the general loathing reserved for the final rejector of the Divine Will in history. The Finger of Mughira's demiurge writes the actions of all future humankind on his palm: this act is overcome by superior history, the advancing, self- defining history of Islam. In the last act of its own millennarian myth, the victory of the MadhT over the Dajjal is foreseen and accomplished at once. MughTra and the Islamic Gnostics of the eighth century, por- trayed as extremists and rejectors, Satans and Antichrists, are defeated simultaneously in the timeless conflicts of the hadTth. That they should lose is foreordained, not subject to alteration, and it is established in perpetuity, in these ShTci and Sunni hadTth.
