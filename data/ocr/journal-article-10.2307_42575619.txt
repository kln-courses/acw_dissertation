<plain_text><page sequence="1">Donald F. Miller* METAPHOR , THINKING , AND THOUGHT Partii The continues problem to of tax the and relation divide the between minds language of men. What and thought follows continues to tax and divide the minds of men. What follows must be understood as merely a highly selective gathering of observations, congruent, in one way or other, with my preceding argument. In no way should it be read as an exegesis on the significant literature. At most it may begin a new argument; it will not settle any. The dominant Western tradition, once again the Aristotlean one, argues for the primacy of thought and its functional independence from language; the latter being merely its tool for communication. As Zeno Vendler (26) recently asserted without equivocation, "Lan- guage is the means of expressing thoughts, not of having them." If this were the case, the obligation to discuss language in this paper would be greatly reduced. However, this tradition has been radically challenged during the twentieth century. From different viewpoints, people like Wittgenstein (27) and Whorf, (28) and in their turn, socio-linguists, feminists, and certain Marxists have argued an alterna- tive: that in some way or other, language determines thought. To the degree that this is so, this section of the present paper is obligatory. Despite accusations of linguistic reductionism, a growing body of work delineates the ways both syntax and semantics shape and restrain how one may think, and indeed how one may, by this thinking, determine or re-inforce by this homologous mental system social reality itself. In one way or other, we inhabit a "prison house of language." (29) At the risk of homogenizing diverse thinkers, it seems that cognitive psychologists lean more to the second position, in so far as * Donald F. Miller teaches in the Department of Political Science at the Univer- sity of Melbourne in Australia. 242</page><page sequence="2">Metaphor, Thinking, and Thought 243 they tend to regard language as an instrument of conceptual analysis and synthesis, irrespective of the variety of explanations of how this instrumentality works. That is, without endorsing some Whorfian conception of relativity of thought, most students of cognitive development do not accept that language is merely a tool for expressing thoughts, but that some causal connection between speaking and thinking ought to be assumed. Vygotsky, who, along with Bruner and Piaget, appears to be so influential, presents a flexible yet distinctly dialectical position: The relation between thought and word is a living process; thought is born through words. A word devoid of thought is a dead thing, and a thought unembodied in words remains a shadow. The connection between them, however, is not a preformed and constant one. It emerges in the course of development, and itself evolves. (30) And he concludes his book in the following paragraph: Thought and language, which reflect reality in a way different from that of perception, are the key to the nature of human consciousness. Words play a central part not only in the development of thought but in the historical growth of consciousness as a whole. A word is a microcosm of human consciousness. (31) Where does a theory of thought based on a universal and innate structure or grammar of seven metaphoric modes fit in all this? What role does language play? To begin with, it must seem obvious that thought exists before the acquisition of language. Many concede this, no matter how they qualify the character of that thought. However, if I am correct that metaphoric thought is inherent, it follows that an infant should think accordingly - before language, without learning and independent of explanations of stimulus- response experiences (of which I would want to say, with Chomsky, (32) that the expressions lose any value they may have if used so broadly as to cover the present circumstances). So, let me suggest that the child within the first year demonstrates all the metaphoric processes (remembering, of course, that the structure, here às everywhere can only be inferred from content-laden manifes- tations). Illustrations could include: (1) metaphor (proper): food is pleasure; hunger is painful. (2) isomorphism: homologies of oral satisfaction, such as the dummy (or equivalent) is the breast of the absent mother. (3) translation: the sounds of laughter are the emotions of joy or excitement. (4) exchange: the giving or surrender- ing of the child's trust, dependence, and recognition of the mother in equivalent return for maternal love, protection, and care. (5) opposi- tion: self v. others; presence v. absence. (6) synecdoche: the breast is the mother; the mouth, hand, or arm is the bodily self.</page><page sequence="3">244 Et cetera • FALL 1982 (7) metonymy: physical warmth, emotional comfort, affective con- tentment are contiguously related; crying (in its varying manners) and maternal attention are sequentially or causally related. On the acceptance that thinking occurs somehow like this in infancy, two questions follow. Is thinking in mature, adult life different? And, in what way may language be relevant to this later thinking? Let me take two illustrations from science. Henri Poincaré in his Science and Method speaks of making combinations that "reveal to us unsuspected kinship between . . . facts, long known, but wrongly believed to be strangers to one another." (33) Not only is this a very explicit statement about metaphoric thinking (metaphor proper, synecdoche, or metonymy), it also describes a process little dependent on language. And we may refer to a recent discussion on Einstein's "discovery" of the general theory of relativity. On the basis of the scientist's own (quite emotional) description of the event, the author considers the creative insight was an example of " Janusian thinking" which "consists of actively conceiving two or more opposite or antithetical concepts , ideas , or images simultaneously, both as existing side by side and/or as equally operative or equally true." (34) (original emphasis). The author continues by insisting that "there was nothing primitive, childlike or regressive in the creative leap," that it was neither illogical, prelogicai, nor primary process thinking; rather it was "high-level, conscious, abstract thinking" belonging to the secondary process. (35) Once again, what is involved is clearly metaphoric thinking (of pairs of opposites) which seems to owe little or nothing to language. We are not saying that a child could think this; only that the form of thinking is the same that a child possesses and utilizes. As it is plausible to discount these illustrations as significant because they refer, generally and then specifically, to instances of creative thought, generally recognized to be redolent with metaphoric inspiration, we will now turn to descriptions of the later, mature stages of cognition as understood by development psychol- ogy. Vygotsky, for example, enumerates many sub-steps in the process from "complex" thinking to "concept" thinking, the final stage. All we can afford to do here is to repeat his briefest descriptions of several of these steps. Their translation into metaphor needs no elaboration. (36) "While the concept groups objects according to one attribute, the bonds relating the elements of a complex to the whole and to one another may be as diverse as the contacts and relationships of the elements are in reality." "Associa- tion by contrast, rather than by similarity, guides the child in compiling a collection . . . collections of complementary things often form a set or a whole." "After the collection stage of thinking in</page><page sequence="4">Metaphor, Thinking, and Thought 245 complexes, we must place the chain complex - a dynamic, consecu- tive joining of individual links into a single chain, with meaning carried over from one link to the next." "But the advanced concept presupposes more than unification (of complex thinking). To form such a concept it is also necessary to abstract , to single out elements, and to view the abstracted elements apart from the totality of the concrete experience in which they are embedded. In genuine concept formation, it is equally important to unite and to separate: synthesis must be combined with analysis." "A concept emerges only when the abstracted traits are synthesized anew and the resulting abstract synthesis becomes the main instrument of thought." "When the process of concept formation is seen in all its complexity, it appears as a movement of thought within the pyramid of concepts, constantly alternating between two directions, from the particular to the general, and from the general to the particular." (original emphases). Nothing explicated here falls outside one or other of the metaphoric modes. Indeed, apart from the transition from sensory to one-remove-from-sensory points of focus (which is not illustrated above), there seems little progression entailed in the "stages" of thinking. Abstraction, for example, implying singling out, separat- ing, dividing off, is an essential and inherent aspect of the simplest example of relating and classifying. In the most "primitive" form of grouping, one simultaneously unites and divides by a concern with some attribute, be it recognized or not. Nevertheless, let it be clear what is being argued. It is that the metaphoric modes of thinking underpin what is commonly understood as normal, conscious, rational conceptual thought; that, whether there are stages or not through which types of thought must proceed to its maturation, these are irrelevant to the essential constancy of the metaphoric operations. That an adult can think things no child appears able to is unquestionable; the reasons for this, however, lie elsewhere than in conventional explanations of processes of thinking, of rationality, of "abstraction." Whether language is a necessary ingredient for conceptualization is a more open question. Although Vygotsky, as most other writers, stresses its importance, none of the above quotations seems to portray a necessity of words for the process of thinking to occur. Mature thinking appears quite conceivable without words. Their presence, however, may well facilitate the process. I interpret one of Vygotsky's formulations of the relationship to say just that: This operation (of concept formulation) is guided by the use of words as the means of actively centering attention, of abstracting certain traits, synthesizing them, and symbolizing them by a sign, (my emphasis) (37)</page><page sequence="5">246 Et cetera • FALL 1982 The process can be expedited by the use of words, not made possible or created by them. Such an assertion, as we will see, is quite independent of any Whorfian notion of language-impregnated thought. The latter concerns the "what" of thought; the former the "how" of thinking within these constraints. One reason why language may play a lesser role in thinking is that the operation seems essentially laconic. I suspect it is this which is partially implied when people refer to intuition. It is a quick, a simple affair, no matter how profound the thought. An image, one or two words, a melange of the two is sufficient to do the trick. We have tended to exaggerate its complexity. Within this perspective, the ideas of Vygotsky on "inner speech" acquire greater significance. "Inner speech," he says, "must be regarded, not as speech minus sound, but as an entirely separate speech function. Its main distin- guishing trait is its peculiar syntax. Compared with external speech, inner speech appears disconnected and incomplete." (38) This "spe- cial speech function" of Vysgotsky I see rather as something approximating thinking. Thinking is a private affair; in contrast, language essentially is a public affair. The more one's language is utilized privately, the less it holds with linguistic structural require- ments; the more it mixes image and concept, the more it dispenses with extraneous, redundant, cautious repetition. It is direct; in this sense to the "in-sider" it is unequivocal, though to the "outsider" it may well be ambiguous. Of course, as psychoanalysis has shown more than anything else, the "self' may be both in the "inner" and the "outer." Vygotsky continues "Egocentric speech shows a ten- dency towards an altogether specific form of abbreviation: namely, omitting the subject of a sentence and all words connected with it, while preserving the predicate. "... When the thoughts of the speakers are the same the role of the speech is reduced to a minimum ..." A "mere hint," Tolstoy realized. "A simplified syntax, con- densation, and a greatly reduced number of words characterize the tendency to predication which appears in external speech when the partners know what is going on." (39) Poetry as a genre is close to thinking, thus its sparseness. It has usually been identified with "pure" language; perhaps it ought to be seen as proximating, in language, "pure" thought. It is not surprising, therefore, that the dream, so personal, is also so laconic. Economy here comes about, not only because of the motivation involved, that is, to compromise and disguise, by conden- sation, the otherwise disturbing thoughts, but also because, as it were, the metaphoric operations at work have no need to explain itself to any "other." Here, thinking can dispense with all rules of language, even all language itself; and, by its own "ingenuity,"</page><page sequence="6">Metaphor, Thinking, and Thought 247 "collapse" several thoughts into one. It sheds, perhaps entirely, the sequential linearity of language; its very compression, apart from its deception, aggravates its translation into linguistic thought. How unique this is will be considered soon. Language, on the other hand, is extended, repetitious, redundant. It is, in other words, complex. I am unable to discuss here its structural complexity; its rules such as those of transformation and recursiveness which give it that sense of consistency, predictability, and internal agreement. One can only recommend the several efforts of Marshall Edelson (40) to relate Chomskian ideas of deep linguistic structures with psychoanalytic understanding of the language of the unconscious. But its functional complexity can be noted. Authors vary in their enumerations. Karl Buhler, (41) in an influential work, argued for three: "Language is a symbol because of its relevancy to objects and relations (connotative function); it is a symptom because of its dependency on the speaker giving expression to his inner self (expressive function); it is a signal because of its appeal to the listener, whose internal or external behavior serves as a guide, as do other traffic signs (appeal function)." (original emphasis) Lain Entralgo (42) suggests there are an additional three functions, paralleling each of these for "the psychological intimacy of the speaker himself." The sodalic function: "Calling the fellow creature we not only invoke him. The caller achieves for himself the function of giving and receiving company . . . Each appeal has a qualitative (sic) different sodalic function." The " cathartic function" is the subjective correlation of the expressive function. "To say something to somebody is not only (outwards) notification, but to the intimacy of the notifier (inwards) is also a cause of affective levelling, for appeasement." The " clarifying function," symmetric with the con- notative: "Naming what can be nominated - direct, metaphoric or interpretative nomination - the man who does it clarifies his inner world." With these multiple functions in mind, and the proposed list is not definitive, it seems obvious that any definition of language as "the expression of thought" or "the means of (intentional) com- munication" are inadequate synecdochic nominations. Language, functionally, needs to be seen as translation, rather translations of multiple psychic phenomena. Vygotsky, apparently untouched by Freud, discloses the complexity of the language "problem": "To understand another's speech, it is not sufficient to understand his words - we must understand his thoughts. But even that is not enough - we must also understand its motivation." (my empha- sis) (43) Having hinted at the several strands involved, we must retreat immediately from any discussion of affect, drives, desire and pose,</page><page sequence="7">248 Et cetera • FALL 1982 very generally, a relationship of dialectic and struggle between thinking and language. Language may facilitate thinking by clarify- ing and pinpointing (e.g. by the brevity of conceptual language), by recording and retaining (e.g. by the memory implanted in words), by reinforcing (e.g. by the linguistic support of young ideas), by sharing (e.g. by the benefits of communication exchange), by satisfying (e.g. through the very accomplishment of translation). But language may also obstruct thinking. Any translation changes the original, as I have argued earlier; so, the movement from conceived relationships in thinking to a verbal form constitutes by definition an alteration, if not distortion, of the idea. The transmis- sion of language-based thought also suffers from the confusion of tongues. Any use of language is a compromise between what may be called the "private language" of each user and the idealized language system, the "public language" of the community. Language becomes "psychologized" as each user furrows his own personal linguistic groove. In this sense, language is always a symptom. According to Karchevskij, (45) who initially pointed out the inevitable struggle between the "psychological" meaning which the individual wishes to express and the "ideological" meaning imposed by the social system of language, a compromise between the two necessarily results. In turn, this produces two consequences: an individual does not express himself completely, and the language system itself experiences constant change via the structures of homonymity and synonymity. His argument can be extended. If any system of language, especially once it is seen as metaphorically based, is and must be partial and incomplete (Karchevskij's "ideological") and redolent with old metaphors constantly in transition, of which its speakers are una- ware; and if individual users of language only, not the system, express desires and drives in the metaphors of their private language (Karchevskij's "psychological"), of which they are unaware; then, unless we posit the unreasonable notion that each individual is an exact microcosm of his culture, we must conclude that a private language system and a public language system cannot be isomorphic or homologous with each other. The conflict between the two has exceptionally wide implications. First, in the constant transmission across private languages, one has to expect regular transmutation of thought, and all under the innocent guise of a common language. Second, not only ought one not expect to say what one wants to say; but one, surely, cannot be expected to be aware of if, when, and how one is saying what one wants to say or not. That is, thinking cannot be guaranteed its translation, and criteria for any such detection are lacking. The dead metaphors of the "collective unconscious" and the desires of the individual unconscious both produce disguise and</page><page sequence="8">Metaphor, Thinking, and Thought 249 deception of this disguise of which the individual must remain ignorant. With this perspective we can begin to appreciate Heidegger's influential aphorism that language conceals as well as reveals. Thought or meaning is not transparent in language; it needs to be interpreted every time. It is not merely that language is a system of tolerated ambiguity and polysemy (which it is), or that this am- biguity is contained within manageable clusters of connotations (a notion which underestimates the constant potential of language- based creativity). It is rather that any final meaning (or thought) can continually evade an interpreter. It has no "presence" in the words; it is hidden in them. Even Saussure and Wittgenstein, when stressing language as a system of difference, as a system of "negative iden- tities" of units related to those of the rest of the system which locate, shape, and determine them, were possibly too conservative. Once we concede that language systems are dynamic and not isomorphic with private languages which bear the unconscious desires and thinking of the users, the potential identity of words moves closer to infinity. In one significant sense, all this becomes the entire thought in lan- guage; to distinguish, as is common, the "context" from the "text" is a misleading abstraction which reflects some "physical" concep- tion of language. (46) Everything is thought, without location but only with instigation in language. Language is separate from the process of thinking , although it can play a role there; it is inseparably enmeshed, of course, in verbal thought , although negligibly so in other forms of thought, as in the arts and the entire range of social behavior. Yet language must remain an arbitrary or conventional system; there is no final refer- ence outside itself, and certainly not in "reality" which is classified in its name. Language is not a system of "natural symbols." Nevertheless, humans must use language as if it were natural; as if it were the equivalent of things and actions and proposals. The use of language implies the necessity of it being reified, made substantive, even anthropomorphized to some degree or other. Language has to be symbolic. So, whether we think with or without language, the operations are metaphoric; any anthropomorphism we impose upon words defies rather than promotes our lexical urge. Despite our- selves, we hint rather than signal. Many writers are in search of the link between the different realms of human activity. In other words, what are the mechanisms or processes or structures which enable translation either way between thought and language, thought and action, the unconscious and the</page><page sequence="9">250 Et cetera • FALL 1982 conscious? I want to suggest, without implying any final specificity, that the answer lies in metaphor; that the structure of seven metaphoric modes, operating in discrete and laconic ways in think- ing, create the paths of transformation into language, which being a symbolic system can theoretically be "deconstructed" into the same seven modes. Metaphor constitutes the link because its specific structures of relating are present, in different forms, in both systems. In a similar fashion, metaphor mediates between thought and action and the unconscious and the conscious. By definition of translation, we do not say what we think, nor do we act what we think or say, but we can and do translate some equivalence through the operations of metaphor inherent in man. Because of our habitua- tion to metaphoric equivalences, we casually assume such transfor- mations are facile operations; but each realm is far less accommodat- ing than we believe. It seems more accurate, therefore, to consider thought as supra-lingual: in its struggle with language, in its frequent "defeat" by it and in its occasional explosion beyond it. Langauge change and innovation in thought are significantly interrelated. It seems to me that Freud, more than anyone else, appreciated the role of metaphor as the mediation structure between the different realms. Whether in his attempt to interpret the unconscious, such as in dreams, or in the complementary task of interpreting symptoms, consciously manifested, his attention focussed on metaphor. While his terminology varied, his insight was precise. Displacement, condensation, negation, contraries, symbolic representations, logical connections by simultaneity in time, and more, are all there. Periodically, he refers to metaphor either as yet another mechanism, or as embracing all these processes. Likewise, Freud and innumera- ble recent psychoanalytic writers (47) explicitly focus on metaphor, metonymy, and opposites in the endeavor to translate the symptoma- tic language (and non-linguistic expression) of analysands or of artists into the language structure of unconscious motivation. With some degree of awareness or not, metaphor is seen as the Janus-faced link. This is not the appropriate place to explore more fully this study. However, I want to suggest two major qualifications. First, both the theory and practice is marred by the tendency to treat metaphor as one, two, or three modes only. Second, because Freud never fully appreciated the entire range of metaphor and its internal interrelations, he was able to continue his distinction between the unconscious, preconscious, and the conscious or the partially but significantly overlapping distinction between the primary process and the secondary process as he did (distinctions, I would argue, which curtail if not distort an otherwise remarkably insightful project). Expressing this another way, Freud gave us an introduction</page><page sequence="10">Metaphor, Thinking, and Thought 251 to the unconscious which will continue to bear fruit. But his understanding of the conscious failed to reach the same heights, in particular, because of his faith in and therefore appreciation of rational, conscious thought (though in this he still has plenty of company). This is also because his understanding of language was bifocal: farseeing in one regard, innocently shortsighted in another (although in this, we are the fortunate heirs of the advances in linguistics of the last fifty years). To the degree that I am correct, this misinterpretation of conscious process ultimately leads to a miscon- ception of the unconscious ones as well. And as Freud stressed, it is the latter that are so important. I have argued that the seven modes of metaphor form all thinking: in dreams, in rational argument or science, in all our daily mental activities. In this perspective of process, irrespective of what other criteria may be applicable, there is no difference between the primary and the secondary process. Certain writers have questioned the validity or usefulness of this distinction, (48) although usually to accommodate the otherwise "anomolous" position of the creative individual. However, psychoanalysis generally retains this mentation duality: primary process thinking being more primitive, simple, affect-laden, diffuse, and metaphoric with a greater emphasis on symbolic imagery; secondary process thinking being more logical, rational, reality-oriented, language-based, and differentiated. Even though many stress that the two co-exist merely with fluctuating emphases, they do not dispute the notion that most normal adults spend most of their time engaged in the more rational processes of the latter, and that we regress to the former in times of intra-psychic conflict, defense, or moments of lower guard. In other words, we are still presented with a binary opposition, each composed of métonymie features seen as contiguously related. Furthermore, we are rarely presented with any further clarification of what rational or logical mentation entails. Is it inductive, deductive, or causal thinking, for example? Instead of showing how each of these forms is nothing other than one or other of the metaphoric modes, it will suffice, I believe, if we simply refer to Arieti's explication of one of them. For, although his language is different from mine, he estab- lishes a similar point: In induction, the mode of contiguity makes us associate A and B because we have observed that B has followed A many times. The mode of similarity makes us associate all A's with all B's. The mode of pars pro toto causes us to extend to the whole series of A's and B's what we have observed in the segment of that series, (original emphasis) (49)</page><page sequence="11">252 Et cetera • Fall 1982 There is no antithesis between metaphor and rationality once one appreciates the complexity and comprehensiveness encompassed by the metaphoric modes. All thinking is thereby explicable. And, once one is not distracted by misleading beliefs of the role of conscious- ness, I want to argue, as does Lévi-Strauss, (50) that thinking is a deep structural or unconscious operation. Even when we are engaged with full awareness in activities conventionally recognized as con- scious thought, consciousness provides only such things as the setting, the theme, the attention, aspects of the desired goal, retention, the opportunity to repeat oneself, and possibly more. But it does not do the process of thinking. That has to come from elsewhere, whether we are aware of it or not - and probably, we are, more often than not, unaware. In this sense I agree with Piaget when he says, "the concept of the unconscious itself is completely general; it is not at all restricted to the emotional life. In any area of cognitive functioning, all the processes are unconscious. We are conscious of the result, not of the mechanism." (51) It is, therefore, quite reasonable for Gould, for example, to compare the different but related concepts of the unconscious mind of both Lévi-Strauss and Freud. The two are not irreconcilable. (52) But we cannot pursue here that investigation. We need to stress, however, that the uncon- scious mechanisms of displacement and condensation, so prevalent as well as so useful as techniques of disguise and compromise in circumstances of repression, constitute only a special function of the same, ubiquitous metaphoric process. We should not confuse vari- ables like motivation and function with the invariable processes of operation. In addition, it may make clinical sense to retain the concept of regression - but not with the processual and dichotom- ous implications it conventionally carries. We cannot leave, however, without some brief reference to Hans Loewald's fresh and sensitive discussion on language and the two processes. (53) He sees everyday mental activity fluctuating between the two constructs of primary and secondary process: the former characterized by oneness, homogeneity, undifferentiation, and global, emotional unity; the latter by duality, multiplicity, and a linked manifold reconciling a differentiation of word from thing. The linking, or more fully, the "textured linkedness in experience and thought" is normal adult mentation. Repression is an unlinking. A certain amount of repression, he argues, is always there to produce a desirable compromise between "too intimate and intense closeness to the unconscious . . . and deadening insulation from the uncon- scious." (54) In other words, normal human development in thought and language begins with a "primordial density" of the "global emotional situation" of the mother-child language initiation. It then</page><page sequence="12">Metaphor, Thinking, and Thought 253 changes with the separation of discrete words from the things they represent but with the concomitant linking of the two phenomena. He characterizes schizophrenic thought as without this link - that is, words are treated as things. Abstract thought, on the other hand, makes words quite autonomous from their thing-representations, producing a "lifeless nimbleness all its own." Great literature "interweaves" both the primary and the secondary process. I would like to provide, tentatively, a different reading of roughly the same material. The initial diffuseness the child experiences, which both Loewald and most development psychologists stress, is, especially by the time of language acquisition, far more selective and discriminating than the metaphor "global" suggests; nor is it as insensitive to boundaries between the phenomena, as "density" suggests. But it is certainly rich in gestalt- style appreciation of each particular experience, in which, for example, the sensations of touch and sound and specific emotions are felt as one composite, total experience: a feeling is washed over by a sight which splashes with sound. Discrimination is there, but applied to goals other than "we" expect. Synaesthesia is born. The cross-fertilization of both senses and emotions, the super-imposition of collage-experiences, be- gins. (55) And it remains with us throughout our lives: no art, to begin with, could ever be appreciated without its presence. With its birth is also announced the beginning of human metaphor, for synaesthesia is nothing other than sensory-based and affect-laden metaphor. Later, language encourages the same process to move beyond a sensory base to one composed of words. The metaphoric paradigm now becomes the pun and the oxymoron: "a play on words." Concomitant with this movement, the abstractness of language, in particular its conceptualizations, the teaching of words with more a univocal than polysémie reference, the discouragement of "fantasy" and its unequivocal demarcation from "reality," and an unconscious preference for métonymie sequential thinking (56) all help to reduce the quantity and quality of synaesthesia in the Western adult. By the same time, of course, one has normally acquired the limited set of metaphoric classifications each culture deems appropriate - now taken as real and true. Metaphor is defined as deviant and relegated accordingly: to unconscious imag- ery and to the artist. In place of Loewald's concern for a healthy balance between the primary and the secondary processes, I therefore pose another. No relationship, no classification is exclusive. No translation, no ex- change is equivalent. Metaphor is just a metaphor. All metaphor, all thinking is both true and false. But we can do no better. Problems arise if people believe that thoughts are either true or false. Whereas</page><page sequence="13">254 Et cetera • FALL 1982 the literal is merely the currently conventional stale metaphors, the belief in the truth of "literalness," its facticity, is a pervasive one. For those who insist on some opposite of the metaphoric, all we can offer is death; for to live one must metaphorize. So, in addition to Loewald's depiction of the therapeutic as the re-establishing of old links, I would like to suggest we aim also at a loose attachment to them. For otherwise we may rest satisfied with a memory of things past, with repeated transformations of the old. Surely we need add to this: the chance to create new metaphors, to think new thoughts.

Jakobson, who enumerates the emotive, conative, referential, metalingual, poetic, and phatic. See his "Closing Statement: Linguistics and Poetics," Style in Language, ed. T.A.

For one comprehensive interpretation of currently competing analyses of affect, including its relation to thought and language, see Andre Green, "Concep- tions of Affect," International Journal of Psychoanalysis, 58, 1977, pp. 129-55. 45. See W. Steiner, "Language as Process: Serge Karchevskij's Semiotics of Language," in Sound, Sign and Meaning, ed. L. Matějka (Ann Arbor, Mich.: University of Michigan Press, 1976), pp. 291-302. 46. This, of course, requires much more discussion than can be afforded it here. The opposition between "text" and "context" riddles the literature; the idea being that the former "contains" the meaning once the signals of the latter have been taken into account. Although it is a desirable step away from positivist notions of transparency, it seems, to me, in the wrong direction. The boundary imposed between text and context betrays a physical or spatial notion of language and meaning. They are "present" in the text, not in the reader, not in the things left unsaid, not in the repressed, not in the cultural system of language itself. Although it may make the task of interpretation seem more difficult, all these aspects need to be considered equally as constituting the undifferentiated totality of meaning. Again, I suspect that Derrida is trying to tell us that in all his writings. 47. Some of the recent literature on this subject would include: J. A. Arlow, "Metaphor and the Psychoanalytic Situation," Psychoanalytic Quarterly, 48, 3, 1979, pp. 363-85; N. Reider, "Metaphor as Interpretation," International Journal of Psychoanalysis, 53, 1972, pp. 463-9; W.H.

Major, "The Logical Process of Interpretation," International Review of Psychoanalysis, 7, 1980, pp. 397-403; J.S. Antrobus, "The Dream as Metaphor: An Information-processing and Learning Model," Journal of Mental Imagery, 2, 2, 1977, pp. 327-338; L. Wurmser, "A Defence of the Use of Metaphor in Analytic Theory Forma- tion," Psychoanalytic Quarterly, 46, 3, 1977, pp. 466-98. I have not included references to Freud's writings; useful bibliographies can be found in most of the above works. 48. See, for example, G.D. Chaitin, "The Representation of Logical Relations in Dreams and the Nature of the Primary Process," Psychoanalysis and Contem- porary Thought, 1.4. 1978, pp. 477-502; S.R.

Noy, "A Revision of the Psychoanalytic Theory of the Primary Process," International Journal of Psychoanalysis, 50, 1969, pp. 155-177, who, in particular, challenges the notion of regression. 49. S. Arieti, The Intrapsychic Self (New York: Basic Books, 1967), p. 193. I have just discovered this book, and I was pleased to read his redescriptions of induction, deduction, and causality, because when I wrote the following description of causality in an earlier work, it was greeted with a smile from even my sympathetic colleagues. I referred to the discussion of causal explanation in the entry on "Scientific Explanation" in the International Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences : "One criterion demanded is the provision of necessary and sufficient conditions, so that one may say - if S, then T. Another attribute insisted upon is that the thing to be explained must be re-expressed in terms of a general theory. A third demand is to relate the thing to others like it, providing a systematic account of how they are related. Let us now re-express these attributes of rationalist causal explanation. The third is demanding a metaphoric classification of similars; the second a synecdochic classification of part and whole; the first a transformation expressed as a</page><page sequence="15">256 Et cetera • FALL 1982 metonym."

In that article, I present the seven metaphoric modes for the first time. 50. There is surely no need here to go beyond repeating some of the most frequently quoted passages from Lévi-Strauss: "... (I)t is enough to establish the conviction that if the human mind appears determined even in the realm of mythology, a fortiori it must also be determined in all its spheres of activity." . . . "I therefore claim to show not how men think in myths, but how myths operate in men's minds without their being aware of the fact." The Raw and the Cooked (New York: Harper and Row, 1975) p. 10, 12. 51. Quoted by N. Gould in "The Structure of Dialectic Reason: A Comparative Study of Freud's and Lévi-Strauss' Concepts of Unconscious Mind," Ethos , 6, 4, 1978, p. 191. 52. Gould, ibid. 53. H.W.

I must take this opportunity to refer to the radical and exciting interpretation of conscious and unconscious thought processes developed by Ignacio Matte Blanco in terms (briefly) of symmetry and asymmetry. Apart from the fact that I want to reject all dichotomous models, I find his work full of stimulation. Serious consideration of it must await another time. See his The Unconscious as Infinite Sets : An Essay in Bi-logic (London: Duckworth, 1975). 54. Loewald, ibid ., p. 249. 55. Synaesthesia is seen these days by most psychologists as little more than an oddity in which one sense perception is experienced through another sense. Language, and especially that of poetry, is peppered with its verbal manifesta- tions, for example, "red with anger," "it looks cold," "bitterly sharp." However, it has also been seen, although loosely, as an essential technique of thought and acquisition of meaning. Theorists of art emphasize it (with or without the precise label) as the constitution of art itself and of aesthetic appreciation. Limited references could include C.A. Donnell, W. Duignan, "Synaesthesia and Aesthetic Education," Journal of Aesthetic Education, 2, 1977, pp. 69-85; E.M. Hornbostel, "The Unity of the Senses," Psyche, 7, 1927, pp. 83-9; C.E.
