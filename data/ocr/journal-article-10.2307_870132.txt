<plain_text><page sequence="1">R. SCHILLING Two Unknown Flemish Miniatures of the Eleventh Century THE Leofric Gospels (Oxford, Bodleian Library, Auct. D.II. I6) derive their name from the first Bishop of Exeter (1050- 72), who presented them to his cathedral. However, the MS is of earlier date. It comes from Brittany and was written around 9oo.1 Two full-page miniatures were inserted in the eleventh century. One of them precedes the Gospel of St Mark, the other the Gospel of St John, the latter with text on the verso, beginning with an illuminated initial. This leaf replaces a folio, apparently missing at the time. Apart from the text the missing folio probably contained a drawing of St John's symbol. The manuscript still has three similar lightly coloured drawings showing the symbols of the 1 F. MADAN and H. E.

They are drawn in a pre-Carolingian style, strong and impressive, but crude compared with the two illuminations, which are outstanding examples of early post-Carolingian art. In both miniatures the Evangelist is seated on a massive throne with the book on a desk to his left. He holds pen and penknife and is looking up towards his symbol for inspiration. The emotional character of the two figures is intensified by a composition of great dynamic power, vigorous in design and in choice of colours. The convergence of lines towards face and hands renders the agitated movement of St Mark (Fig. 7) most impressive. His vivid expression is stressed by the contrast formed by the drapery stretched wide apart across his knees, from which the border of the mantle swings upwards in a long steep curve. This movement is balanced by the accessories, the curtain, the eagle with the script roll, the desk and the stool. The choice and distribution of colours add a distinctive note to the composition. Cool tones predominate. The sur- rounding objects are attuned to the main colours of the figure. The blue-green of the mantle and the light ochre of the alb are set against a background of dull purple, patterned in gold, silver, blue and white, with red dots, which also appear on the mantle. Different shades of blue and violet are used for the accessories. Blue appears in the curtain, the clouds, the symbol and the stool. The dull purple of the background is echoed in brighter tones of violet, applied to the inner frame, to the throne and to a cloud, and in a sombre shade to the flesh tints. These blue and purple colours are a most effective foil to the figure, which they surround like a garland. A contrasting accent of rust brown with vermilion lights appears on the fabric covering the desk and in the lining of the cloak. The type of St John (Fig. 8) with his arms outstretched on either side is frequent in Carolingian miniatures. Greater emotion is displayed by a slight deviation from the usual scheme; the Saint does not face the spectator, but turns towards the symbol. Here, too, the dynamic power of the picture is enhanced by the choice and distribution of colours. The rust brown cloak and the vivid blue background are more intensely contrasted than garments and ground on the other illumination. There is less variety, but here, too, a harmony is achieved by graded colours of a bold and unusual combination. The alb contains the same colour as the mantle, but lightened to near white. Shades of olive green with ochre and blue mediate between the two diverging colours. The violet frame reflects the tone of the hair, while face and hands have the colour of the alb. The two miniatures are closely related to the style of a group of Flemish MSS. Some of these come from the Flemish borderland, but the school seems to have developed at Liege, where two of the earliest MSS were written and illuminated.3 Both are Sacramentaries with a series of illustrations: one of them, small in size, now at Bamberg (lit. 3) comes from St Lambert's, the other (Paris, Nat. lat. 819) from the monas- tery of St Lawrence. The colour-scheme seems to be a main characteristic of the school: the selection of shades and the blending of colours with free use of white, giving them a chalky, dull appearance. As in the Oxford miniatures we find a few dominant colours brought into harmony, by applying them with varying tints. In this the miniatures differ considerably from the contemporary illuminations of the leading school of Reichenau, with their manifold brilliant and striking colours. They seem rather more like the miniatures of the Cologne group, where a similar scheme is applied with a few colours of different shades.4 Their influence on these Flemish MSS is obvious, though they show little of the 'impressionistic' brushwork so characteristic of the Rhenish school .5 Compare, for instance, the shades of St John's vestments, the reflections of surrounding colours in flesh and hair, the typical violet frame with white stripes, and details such as the stars on the book or the dotted white spots on the base of the throne. The colours of the Oxford miniatures are, in fact, almost the same as in the Bamberg MS. We find similar combina- tions of rust brown with vermilion and blue lights, brown used together with yellowish pink, or ochre shaded with olive green. The contours are fine black lines, but hands and faces are drawn in red. A background of a design as in the miniature of St Mark appears in the scene of Christ and the Magdalen of the Bamberg MS (Fig. Io). Such large diapered patterns, which are not often met with in illuminations of that period, occur, however, frequently in the Flemish MSS. Several illus- trations of the Vita St Audomari at St Omer have them. The resemblance of pattern and colour is perhaps most striking in the Damasus portrait of the Brussels Gospels (Bibl. Roy. II, i75) (Fig. I2).8 The Bamberg MS contains scenes from the Life of Christ, but no Evangelists. There is only one miniature with a single Saint, that representing St Gregory (Fig. 9). The picture compares well with the two Oxford miniatures, as its compo- sition resembles that of an Evangelist rather more than the usual type of this Saint. The arrangement of the figure largely conforms with that of St Mark. The drapery repeats patterns to be found in both the Oxford Saints. The figure has similar proportions: rather short legs, horizontally draped knees and elongated body. The face shows a certain family resemblance, the hands are drawn with equal delicacy. This miniature also has a violet frame, with undulating white lines, just as the Cologne MSS. In the picture of St Gregory as in that of St John we notice the same peculiarity: on the left upright portion of the frame is a moulded band, rather like a capital. In the Bamberg miniature it holds the top of a desk with the inkhorn, while in the Leofric Gospels the 2 There are some more MSS with similar humanised symbols of the Evangelists. Moray has published the Berne Gospels (cod. 85) in connection with the Harkness Gospels of New York (Public Library), which have the same Landevennec Comes as the Leofric codex. c. R. MOREY, E. K.

MICHELI: L'enluminure du haut Moyen-age et les influences Irlandaises [1939]. 3 MAX SCHOTT: Zwei Latticher Sakramentare in Bamberg und in Paris [1931]. 4 Schott refers to iconographic relations between the Li6ge and Reichenau schools and also to similarities of colouring. There is a certain conformity of technique, the pigments being similarly fine. But colours are used differently. In the Reichenau, too, the colours are applied to stress the expression and emphasize the agitation. But this is done in a similar way for each miniature, while in Cologne each picture has to some extent its own colour scheme. This is aimed at also in the Flemish miniatures, though the effect is never of the same intensity as in the Rhenish miniatures, where the colours are far more expressive than the design. 6 H.

This is the abbreviated, mis. interpreted version of a feature of Echternach miniatures, where the inkhorn is placed on a high desk, supported by a column, which stands close to the frame.7 The shape of the two Oxford illuminations, though narrow, is wider than in other miniatures of the Flemish school,s probably because they are painted on leaves fitted into a Carolingian MS of nearly a square format. The figures of the Bamberg MS are softer and more subtle than the two Evangelists, their attitude is less deter- mined, their gestures are not quite as vigorous. This may be partly due to the fact that the Bamberg MS is somewhat earlier than the Oxford miniatures. In both cases the com- position cuts across the frame. However, in the small Bamberg Sacramentary the figures move rather timidly in scenes which are crowded, while in the Gospels the frame has become too narrow for the full display of a single figure. The relation between the two MSS is in some way analo- gous to that between two MSS of the Reichenau school, the Gospels of Otto III and the Gospel Lectionary of Henry II (Cim. 58 and 57 of the Munich State Library). The design of the Evangelists is more distinct and stronger. Without any architectural background the structural qualities are more apparent in these two pictures, which have a grandeur and monumentality unsurpassed by any other miniatures of the school. 9 The Calendar, as Schott has pointed out, indicates that the Bamberg Sacramentary was written not before 1015. That this is the approximate date is confirmed by the style of its miniatures. The MS was certainly completed before the Paris Sacramentary, for which the date of 1025 can be assumed as a terminus post quem. The Christ in Majesty of the Paris Sacramentary, from St. Lawrence, Liege, is shown in a more static and solemn attitude.'0 The figure is confined more strictly within the frame and arranged symmetrically. The first symptoms of the Romanesque style may be observed. The Oxford Evan- gelists have still the Ottonian vagueness of space, with the figures in agitated movement, with forms distorted to convey action rather than to display natural gestures and the shape of the human body. Though the composition of the different scenes is similar in the two Sacramentaries, the Paris MS may well be later than the Oxford Evangelists, all the more as their colour scheme is reduced merely to blue and pink shades. The portraits of SS Jerome and Damasus (Fig. 12) at the beginning of a Gospel-book from French Flanders (Brussels II, 175) denote a change towards a still more architectonic and linear composition, achieved by symmetry and parallel- ism and design of great precision. In the rendering of faces and hands the resemblance with the Evangelists is closer than that with the two Sacramentaries. Three further minia- tures of Evangelists (Fig. i i) are by another hand." They are of special interest in connection with the Oxford miniatures, as two of them show exactly the same icono- graphic types. The style, however, has changed. The figures no longer form part of a composition, fired by an agitated rhythm, but have been enclosed within an architectural frame. Their proportions have become rather squat. There is sym- metry in architecture and other accessories. The body is defined more clearly under the draperies, which is more schematized; the attitude and gestures are quieter. The emotional power of the Oxford Evangelists could hardly be better exemplified than by their contrast with the heavy, more static Brussels figures. From the Saints mentioned in the Comes it appears evident that the Brussels Gospels come from the Franco-Flemish borderland and not from Lidge. Whether this also applies to the Leofric Evangelists cannot be said for certain. To Liege points the close connection with the two Sacramentaries. Considering the composition of the Bamberg St Gregory and the Christ in Majesty of the Paris MS, one might think that the two Oxford Evangelists represent the conventional types of Evangelists in the Lidge group. We, however, cannot trace them in any other Lidge MSS of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Apart from representations in profile, those in three-quarter or partial full face prevail, with the Evangelists writing or preparing to write. We find them first in a Gospel Book of St. Lawrence of Lidge (Fulda, Aa21), painted shortly after the middle of the eleventh century.'2 These types appear slightly altered also in Franco-Flemish MSS such as the Paris Gospels (Nat. lat. 278).13 In both groups they continue to be used in the twelfth century.14 The Oxford Gospels contain the earliest list of the dona- tions with which Leofric so lavishly endowed his church.'5 7 cf. the Gospels from Goslar at Upsala (University Library), the Gospels from Luxeuil and another Gospel Book, both in Paris, (Nat. lat. nouv. acq. 2196 and lat. 10438).

GOLDSCHMIDT: German Illumination [1928], P1. 50, 66. 8 The narrow shape of the miniatures may also be due to the influence of the Echternach school. In many MSS, with the text written on two columns, narrow panels of miniatures or decorated script are confined to one of these columns. Cf. Codex Epternacensis (Gotha, MS. I, 19), the fragmentof Luxeuil in Paris (lat. nouv. acq. 2196) and the Golden Gospels of Henry III in the Escorial. This arrangement of script and decoration may go back on the example of the school of Trives, cf. MSS such as the Gospels of the Ste Chapelle in Paris (Nat. lat. 8851).

"3 The type of the writing Evangelist seen in profile, frequent in Carolin- gian MSS, may in the Flemish MSS go back to examples of the Ada group, perhaps mediated by Traves MSS. The motive of the hand raised outside, as it appears in the picture of the Leofric St Mark, was also popular in MSS of the Ada school. But it seems more likely that the Leofric Evangelists are of French origin. In French MSS we find in many variations the full-face picture of St John, with the head turned towards the symbol in the upper corner. It is a similar conception, though nowhere the connection is very close. Cf. MSS of Tours, such as the Vivianus Bible of Paris (Nat. lat. I) or the Dufay Gospels (Nat. lat. 9385), also some of the Reims and Anglo- Frankish Gospels. H. KOHLER: Die Schule von Tours [1930-3]; A. BOINET: La miniature Carolingienne [1913]. 14 For Liege MSS, cf. the Gospels at Brussels (Bibl. Roy. 18383), late eleventh century, where St Luke may be compared with Leofric St Mark. Also Gospels at Darmstadt (Landesmuseum 682) twelfth century and similar pictures in the Florus or the Augustin at Brussels (Bibl. Royale 9369 and 10791 [Gaspar and Lyna, P1. x, xIIi.] Among the Franco-Flemish MSS compare Brussels (Bibl. Roy. 5573) or two codd. from St Amand at Valen- ciennes (Bibl. Munic. 74 [75] and 173 [174] ). Schott claims that relations with the Anglo-Saxon art are closer in MSS of the Franco-Flemish border- land than in those coming from Liege. The Leofric Evangelists too denounce this particular connection in their figure design, mark also the desk, covered with a cloth, as found in Anglo-Saxon miniatures. 16 The Exeter Book of English Poetry, Exeter [1933], Chapter II; MAX FOERSTER: The Donations of Leofric to Exeter. Foerster deals with three catalogues of Leofric's donations, quoting in full the second one of the Exeter Book. He distinguishes between various forms of Leofric's gifts, whether made out of his private possessions or only procured by him. 316</page><page sequence="6">TWO UNKNOWN FLEMISH MINIATURES OF THE ELEVENTH CENTURY In this catalogue the Gospels are mentioned as one of 'H mycele Cristes bocs'. It has been assumed that Leofric brought the Gospels with him, together with other MSS, when he came over to England in I042 with Edward the Confessor. What are the arguments in favour of this view, which would permit us to fix the date of the two miniatures more precisely? Less than a third of the books in the donation of Leofric have survived. Among these are two other Continental MSS, Bedae Historia Saxonice written in France in 818, and a Missal (Oxford, Bodl. 579), for which the same claim as for the Gospels has been made. It should be noted that this Missal, too, comes from lower Lorraine, being written and decorated in a monastery of the Arras diocese, if not at Arras itself.'6 All the other MSS from the donation which have come down to us, were written in England, even those which go back beyond Leofric's time. The list contains the books usual in a conventual library of those days, but it is remark- able for its large proportion of Anglo-Saxon texts, among which we find Gospels (Cambridge, Univ. Library, II, 2, I1) and the famous Exeter Book of English Poetry, still preserved in Exeter Cathedral. The books from Leofric's donation give us an idea of the thoroughness and consideration with which he proceeded in his work. He introduced the Rule of Chrodegang of Metz for the canons of his Cathedral. The MS. which was used for this purpose (Cambridge, C.C.C. I91) contains the text both in Latin and in Old English. A Poenitential (Cambridge, C.C.C. 190) also has Latin and Saxon text combined: an Anglo-Saxon compilation by Archbishop Ecgbert and para- phrases by Halitger of Cambrai. A Collectar (Harley 2961) probably copied under the eyes of Leofric, follows the version of Stephen of Lidge. 17 From these-examples two con- clusions may be drawn: they show that Leofric remained in touch with that part of lower Lorraine - the country between Liege and the French coast - where the Missal and the Gospels had come from, and where his home most probably had been before he came over to England. But they also show his regard for the established Saxon church and his anxiety to smooth relations. This fact makes it rather difficult to believe that he would have chosen Continental MSS as gifts for his church at a later period of his office. It is more likely that the Gospels, as well as the Missal, were part of his equipment when he started on his journey to England. He may have presented the two MSS when he moved his seat, in Io5o, from Crediton to Exeter, an occasion for the endow- ment of the Cathedral with precious books and other gifts. It fits in well with the stylistic characteristics of the Evan- gelists that they should have been painted shortly before 1042. We had placed them between the Bamberg Sacramentary and the Gospels of Brussels (II, 175), which suggests the second quarter of the eleventh century. Another point endows the two miniatures with particular significance. They are documents of the relations between Flemish and Saxon art, one of the few Continental illu- minated codices of which we know for certain that they actually were in England at the decisive period shortly before the Conquest. With features inspired by English art, such MSS will not have failed to impress and influence the Saxon craftsmen. The same process as in the Church took place in art. Paintings such as the Leofric Evangelists had, no doubt, their share in preparing the change from the Saxon to the Norman style. In MSS such as Arundel 60 the change from the Anglo-Saxon 'impressionistic' painting to a more solid, heavier colouring can first be noticed. I should like to mention and put forward for discussion another MS, the Gospels (Stuttgart, bibl. qw. 7, ca. Io50-7o).18 In this MS (Fig. i3) the miniatures display the typical features of the Anglo- Saxon style in composition, arrangement of the drapery, and in the abundant foliage decoration of their framework. The technique has changed from opaque colours to brighter and heavier pigments, smoothly painted and shaded, and out- lined with strong contours. The manuscript, however, con- tains no evidence of its provenance and it has still to be ascertained whether it was written in England, or whether it is not one of the late examples of Franco-Flemish illumina- tion, shaped from an Anglo-Saxon model. 16 F. E. WARREN: The Leofric Missal, Oxford [1883]. The Missal con- tains different additions, among them (fol. 39-58) a calendar for Glastonbury, calendar tables and four drawings of the Winchester style (late tenth century). As text and drawings fill a complete gathering, they may have been added to the MS at a later date, even, as has been suggested, by Leofric himself, to supplement the original Arras Calendar. 17oE. c. and E.
