<plain_text><page sequence="1">* L. H. G. Greenwood. Aspects of Euripi- dean Tragedy. New York. Cambridge Uni- versity Press. 1953. vii+144 pages. $3.75. Ihe major aspect or Jkunpidean tragedy herein considered is the question of the out- look of Euripides upon the Olympian reli- gion. In opposition to those who have found beneath the unbelievable mythological exter- nals of his plots a core of quasi-religious faith in divine powers controlling the life of man (the "symbolist theory"), and opposing with equal energy Verrall's "rationalism," which would discover a purely naturalistic explana- tion of every ostensibly supernatural compo- nent, Greenwood has made a strong case for what he has, not very happily, called the "fan- tasy theory." Based on this view, to me very plausible, he concludes that the playwright is essentially a playwright, and incidentally a satirist of anthropomorphic religion, saying, in effect, to his audience, "What you see in my play could not have occurred; but if the story were true, what would have occurred is just what you see in my play."
