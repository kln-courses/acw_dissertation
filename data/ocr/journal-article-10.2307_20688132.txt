<plain_text><page sequence="1">AT WORK IN THE GENRE LABORATORY: BRIAN DePALMA'S SCARFACE TRICIA WELSCH Fade in on the death throes of a man, his body riddled with bullets, screaming with anguish and adrenaline. An army of assassins in cam ouflage garb attacks from all sides. Impossibly, the man continues to fight back. After his agonized body has absorbed many more bullets than seems humanly possible, a lone gunman?finally, almost mercifully? appears and fires a single shot. The man top ples from the balcony he has commanded and falls into a decorative pool of water far below. The last image we see is of his spread-eagled form, face down in the water. This is the death of Tony Montana, which concludes Brian DePalma's Scarf ace (1983). What is striking about this sequence is not the defeat of the gangster but the way his final appearance persistently evokes associa tions with a film genre supposed to inhabit different territory altogether, that is, the hor ror film. The scene could easily be taken from a monster movie in which the culmina tion demands a prolonged, superhuman burst of energy from the creature before the assem bled forces of civilization (as variously defined) bring the monster to its knees. In fact, the final image in Scarface employs cross-generic conventions to create a tense but lively interplay of forms that typifies both this film and other 1980s gangster films. Robin Wood has argued, "One of the greatest obstacles to any fruitful theory of genre has been the tendency to treat the genres as dis crete," and the exchange between DePalma's Scarf ace, a direct descendent of the gangster line through its parent film, Howard Hawks's 1932 Scarf ace, and the horror genre helps explain the resistance of some critics and audiences to this film, as well as its cult sta tus among others ("Ideology" 62). More important, by acknowledging the "interaction and multiple determinacy" within American film, Wood's approach offers a way to accommodate generic change (72). If, as many scholars have proposed, genres serve as problem-solving constructs for the cultures they reflect and are fundamentally conserva tive structures, committed to (inevitably) temporary resolutions of the hopeless contra dictions that produce their dramas, then DePalma's Scarface exemplifies the ways gangster films of the 1980s redefined generic solutions by reconfiguring the problems the gangster film traditionally posed. Specifically, the 1980s gangster film extends the treatment of the criminal as ethnic alien found in the early genre pictures. The crime film of the 1930s presents the mobster as a recent and unwelcome immigrant to this country. The earliest genre exemplars cus tomarily offer warnings (gangsters are not "men" but social problems) and strongly worded recommendations that citizens should "do something" about these intruders? preferably evict them. The 1932 Scarface, for example, features additional footage exhort ing citizens to "put teeth in the Deportation Act."1 Anyone who deserves the opportunities available in the New World, these films urge, will assimilate himself as quickly as possible. To rub out cultural difference is to rub out the violent criminal. Tricia Welsch is an assistant professor of film studies at Bowdoin College.

In the 1980s gangster film, eth nic, racial, and gender differences have moved to center stage, where they can be examined before they are managed or elimi nated. Further, by introducing elements from supposedly alien film genres, the 1980s gang ster films pose a cinematic analogue for the mechanisms of social accommodation. The suturing of conventions from screwball comedies (in Married to the Mob), musicals (The Cotton Club), and film noir (PrizzVs Honor) to the gangster formula has created an amorphous, aesthetically daring, and often compelling body of work. But whether in the anarchic chaos of some of these hybrids or in the near-seamless matches, they often dis guise a conservative treatment of ethnicity, race, and gender that resembles the xenopho bia espoused in films made 50 years before. This essay uses DePalma's Scarf ace to explore how the threat of cultural difference has been contained in the recent gangster film through generic hybridization. DePalma's film treats ethnic differences as insurmount able by refracting the gangster film through the lens of the horror film. For sequences from the grotesque chain saw murder of a drug dealer to the cathartic death of Tony Montana atop his cocaine hill, Scarf ace draws on competing traditions within the hor ror genre, models based either on the ultimate security of those threatened by a monster or on their correctly paranoid response to a threat that cannot be contained. The first Scarf ace owes an unassessed debt to the early Universal horror pictures, especially Frankenstein, which in turn provides a link between physical deformity and monstrosity that DePalma reconceives as cultural alien ation.2 Treating ethnic identity as the source of unnatural selfhood, DePalma incites a xenophobic mob mentality and exerts pres sure to brandish American values and prac tices. The trade-off between "secure" and "paranoid" horror?seen especially in recent horror films?completes the gangster as a threat so alien that he ought to be extirpated immediately. Drawing on two different horror traditions (the monster movie and the slasher film), even as it offers up gangster film conventions of plot and characterization, Scarface has resisted easy categorization. Its mixed critical and popular reception highlights the ambigu ity of the generic hybrid's cultural position. The same audience that patronized slasher films throughout the 1970s and 1980s found in Scarface a style of violent excess at once comic and terrifying?a combination appeal ing to (mostly male) teenagers and college students. Indeed, young audiences were going to see popular slasher films repeatedly, eventually turning to video stores to rent hor ror titles again and again. Scarface's reception among its most devoted admirers mimicked the screening habits of slasher film fans. In theaters, these audiences often actively participated by shouting favorite lines of dialogue along with the on screen actors. The carnival atmosphere in the theater during a screening of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre "terrified" a critic as sympathetic to the genre as Robin Wood {Hollywood 93). For Scarface to be accepted by a teen crowd when it was widely rejected by older viewers and critics reflected the loy alties of genre audiences: where older view ers perceived a broken promise, teenagers unfamiliar with either The Godfather or with classic gangster films recognized and approved only Scarface''s links to their favored generic form, the horror film. As Susan Dworkin notes, It was possible to meet teenagers from California to New Jersey who had gone back to see the Scarface shootout again and again, laughing more happily each time. And you could bet that a generation that enjoyed seeing (more correctly, imagining they had seen) a man dismem bered by a chain saw would likewise groove on the Indian's drill [in Body 40 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 49.1-2 (Spring-Summer 1997)</page><page sequence="3">Double]. Like Brian himself, the kids seemed to think it was "just a movie." They paid their money and screamed and laughed and then went out for pizza. They did not judge the effect on women or cops or Cubans or Indians, they did not judge the effect on their souls (23-24). Both horror and gangster films address them selves consistently to the dilemma of aberrant behavior, but their approaches differ signifi cantly. The plea of some film monsters to be treated as human forms a crux in horror cine ma: everything hinges on whether they deserve or will receive such treatment. Gangster film conventions, however, decree that violent, criminal actions will cause the mobster to be called a monster or a beast but that he will not ultimately forfeit his status as a human by virtue of these acts. Thus, films with titles like Scarface, Mad Dog Coll, and Beast of the City flirt with the language of horrific denomination without ever actually committing themselves. Furthermore, the unbreachable gap between human and inhuman in the horror film is often externally coded in monstrous physiognomy, physical deformity writ large. As such, unless the conflict features a shape-changer who can be restored to his rightful body?unless it can be reappropriated and renewed?that which is monstrous cannot be assimilated; it is utter ly foreign. But in the classic gangster dramas, the foreignness of the crime hero comes from ethnic heritage, class difference, and the restriction of opportunity. (It also has to do with daring and the will to succeed.) Although these differences may seem insur mountable in practice, they are less recalci trant, less permanent or restrictive than the disparity between monster and human in hor ror films: the criminal's rehabilitation is always possible. Nonetheless, the horror and gangster genres are peculiarly compatible, as their conflicts are usually resolved (when res olution is possible) by either the assimilation or the destruction of the aberration. By mak ing explicit the links between these forms, DePalma's film is exemplary: overdetermined as it is, Scarface subverts, reinvents, and renegotiates the turf the gangland crime film would claim throughout the 1980s. In the Monstrous Laboratory, or Building the Perfect Beast In "Nightmare and the Horror Film: The Symbolic Biology of Fantastic Beings," No?l Carroll isolates two common taxonomic struc tures of horror films. Horrific creatures, he finds, are constructed along either a "fusion" model or a "fission" model. The former unites conflicting themes or impulses within one frightening figure; Frankenstein and Dracula are key examples. The fission model distrib utes conflicts over more than one figure, either through some process of cloning, shape changing, or doubling; Doctor Jekyll (and Mr. Hyde) and the Wolfman illustrate this pattern. "Horror film imagery . . . incarnates archaic, conflicting impulses," says Carroll (18). Carroll's ideas may be useful when consider ing Scarf ace's troubled relation to the genre it professes to recapitulate. Although the gang ster himself has traditionally stood outside accepted norms of behavior, neither his visu al presentation nor his psychology explicitly labeled him as monstrous in early film incar nations. Instead, care was taken to situate him in a socioeconomic position that was offered as at least partial explanation for his charac ter, or such minimal attention was paid to his loathesomeness that audiences had little trou ble rooting for him. The original Scarface (Paul Muni) was charismatic in his na?vet?, treating his guns as toys; state and municipal censor boards feared he would disarm and charm audiences.3 Even Tony Camonte's notorious scar was scarcely highlighted, not treated as a mutilation of the body that could reflect inner desecration. Nevertheless, the early gangster does contain, or "fuse," opposing qualities. As Robert Warshow claims, the organized crime hero is at once the Oedipal son trying to usurp a more established gang lord's territory and the child who would be destroyed for such aggression. Such a figure, urges Warshow, satisfies the JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 49.1-2 (Spring-Summer 1997) 41</page><page sequence="4">1 &gt;* \\\ ; I ^^,^^^ ^ *? V\mit&gt; ? I ^^^^^r In DePalma's film Scarf ace, the monster of the horror movie and the criminal hero of the gangster film combine in the person of Tony Montana (Al Pacino) to create a postmodern hybrid. audience's dual need to indulge the ego freely and to be punished and cleansed of this crime.4 In treating his gangster more forthrightly as a monster, DePalma enacts his own Oedipal drama with "father" filmmakers Hawks and Hecht. He gleefully integrates the antisocial violence of the gangster with the distorted, enlarged perspective of the monster, fusing two genres. Like the child who wants to trade in his family for a new one, DePalma lays claim through Scarface's unique hybridization to a second set of generic forbears. The fascinations of untempered egotism are cru cial here: if some would accuse DePalma of plundering the classic film canon for his deriva tive films, such self-indulgence is perfecdy expressed by his film's protagonist. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) believes that the world is his for the taking, and most of the film's energy is engaged in dramatizing his self-gratification. He understands the world only in terms of him self and in this is as simple as a child?and as childish as any generic monster. Tony treats the world as a toy, after the manner of Hawks's villain. Tony's car, his video-surveillance equipment, his beautiful wife are all his play things?although he lacks charm and gra ciousness in his relentless narcissism (DePalma and Pacino permit Tony no soften ing, no glee like the first Tony shows when his whims are satisfied). Nevertheless, such infan tile self-absorption fascinates the audience. Warshow describes the early gangster's acquisitions as steps on the ladder of capital ist success, but Tony Montana borrows Tony Camonte's method without his philosophy. Camonte's rules are simple: "Do it first, do it yourself, and keep on doing it," positive exhortations to action that, while criminal and antisocial, involve a certain work ethic. 42 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 49.1-2 (Spring-Summer 1997)</page><page sequence="5">He has to act to get what he wants, and when he at last breaks his self-made laws, his death follows swiftly; his world is a place where breaking the rules has lethal consequences. Syntactically, Tony Montana's self-professed philosophy is based on not doing; two rules he professes are "Never underestimate the other guy's greed" and "Don't get high on your own supply." In this limited sense, he has not earned what he gets?he is a passive recipient. By eliminating the generic norm that requires labor (however spurious), DePalma makes central what Hawks glosses over quickly: the childhood, unsocialized practice of simply taking what one wants, of not sharing one's toys or observing the boundary that reserves another's belongings for his use. While Hawks's film somewhat uncomfort ably allows the police to capture Tony and restore the status quo, DePalma spends most of his time demonstrating that everything is up for grabs. The gangster picture has long been considered a fable of financial success, but whereas in the 1930s this conviction touched a Depression audience's need to have enough money to be permanently secure (a grown-up worker's problem), in the 1980s it spoke to the me generation's reluctance to grow up, to a child's desire to have every whim gratified immediately. By connecting criminal behavior more close ly to the monstrous selfishness that is child hood's norm, DePalma reinstates the power of violence to disturb and chastise. One immediate consequence of depicting Tony as a terrible, willful child is that the gangster's inevitable death at the end of the movie invokes the now-compromised catharsis achieved in early genre models. When Hawks made the original Scarface, Tony Camonte's speedy, brutal death was mandated to end his criminal career. Audiences of 50 years later, however, were accustomed to seeing crime triumphant and law enforcement corrupted; they no longer demanded that a crooked hero be physically dead by the film's end?or that his death, should it come, restore law and order.5 Crime films of the 1980s exposed brutality and cor ruption on so many levels that audiences could seldom point to one criminal as the source of all evil. Hence, no one death offered so cathartic an experience as the one Warshow observed in the 1930s films. The violence on the streets and on the screen was too pervasive to make this simple remedy satisfying. The same behavior?a criminal taking what he wants rather than earning it?resonates differently, however, when it is reified by the fantastic power and fearfulness a monster possesses. If so much exposure to crime fic tions has made the criminal mind accessible and intelligible to viewers, DePalma manages to reinstate the strangeness by making his vil lain at once both larger than life and childish ly self-absorbed, by referring to the horror film tradition, which has conventionally por trayed its central figures thus. A look at the troubled patriarchal structure in a classic tale of horror will illuminate this connection. In Carroll's discussion of monstrous biology, he calls attention to Frankenstein and to the creature most literally a "composite" or fusion of disparate ele ments, constructed as he is of outsized body parts and the degrading remains of corpses (20-21). Henry Frankenstein works on his experiment when he is supposed to be prepar ing for his wedding and the begetting of his own family of human children. With the narcissism of a child, Henry plans to marry the person most like himself, his adop tive sister, thus keeping his childhood self intact. The monster kills Henry's bride on the couple's wedding night, enacting his creator's wish not to take on adult responsibilities. At the same time, the monster fulfills his own reverse-Oedipal wish to have his single parent all to himself by killing the woman who would become his "mother." In Bride of Frankenstein, the incest theme continues, as the monster "marries" a female creature fashioned by his own creator father? a wife who must then be seen as his sister. The JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 49.1-2 (Spring-Summer 1997) 43</page><page sequence="6">monster seeks to enact the paradigm his father has established; he consolidates his childhood even as he prepares to become autonomously adult by marrying. In DePalma's Scarf ace, a similar kind of nar cissism occurs, a centripetal force subsuming each outside influence back into the gang ster's childish persona. Although he longs for a family life, Tony Montana cannot keep his reconvened family together; neither his mother nor his sister nor his wife will stay with him for long. (And his family is riven by the absence of his father before the film's narrative opens.) Tony cannot have children with his wife?though he blames it on her "barrenness"?because he is himself a child. Although he wants to possess the cool and lovely Elvira to establish his supremacy over her lover, his boss, Tony's fullest emotional connection is with his younger sister, Gina, whom he wishes to keep pure and unspoiled, virginal. He seeks his mirror image in a sib ling, someone younger who reminds him of his own childish self. (The only other soft spot Tony shows is a weakness for children: he cancels the planned assassination of an important enemy when the man's children would be killed alongside him.) Frankenstein popularized the image of the monster as a powerful child, and DePalma's gangster participates in a similar paradigm. Tony cannot negotiate the conflict between his personal power and his childish insistence on self-gratification, and he increasingly resem bles this classic movie monster, even being physically likened to Frankenstein's creature in the final frames. He contradicts himself unself consciously when he declares early in the film that he wants only what is coming to him: "The world and everything in it." Tony's "world" is composed, finally, of himself alone; as such, it is claustrophobic, narcissistic, monstrous. A key monologue makes his self-enclosure unintentionally clear. Tony's "Say good night to the bad guy" speech points a finger at the shocked diners in a Miami restaurant and, implicitly, at the viewing audience. You need someone like me to show you you're alive, he urges; I exercise your evil impulses and then you exorcise me and feel that all the evil has been eradicated. This speech restates some what crudely a lesson DePalma picked up from Hitchcock?the viewer is implicated in the crime simply by viewing it. But in Scarf ace, the reverberations are silenced almost immediately, for Tony has not earned the right to make such a speech to us. We reject the notion that he has a philosophy of external relations in which others participate, because we have never seen him act as though anyone outside himself matters, except to sat isfy his needs. Even in this speech, the rest of the world exists merely to notice him. Family structure in Scarface reiterates the problems of patriarchal collapse found in hor ror films such as Frankenstein. Tony claims that he and his sister Gina "never had" a father; Dr. Frankenstein quickly abandons his creature. Equally crucial is the mother's absence from both narratives. The monster in Frankenstein is born 6&gt;/many bodies, but out of no one body. The mother Tony does have rejects her son emphatically, further compli cating his identity. It is traditional for gang ster films to address the family background of the criminal, often showing an abusive father or an ethnic mother who cannot cope with the unleashed energies of her child amid the New World's temptations. But Tony's mother goes beyond the conventional regret indicated by heartbroken genre parents, expressing an undisguised loathing for her son that is more like the fear and disgust one might feel on seeing a monster than anything that could be considered maternal sentiment. Even the land of his birth, his motherland, Cuba, is forcibly repelling Tony as the film opens. Scarface offers no promise of repairing a broken famil ial relation, despite Tony's persistent efforts, which end only with his death. For Tony, more fear and anxiety are ultimately associated with the rejection by his mother than with the absence of the father. There is only one (flippant) reference to Tony's dis figurement, when an immigration officer proposes that he got his scar from "eating pussy." Although Tony dismisses the remark, 44 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 49.1-2 (Spring-Summer 1997)</page><page sequence="7">the reference to a toothed vagina suggests a belief that women are dangerous, able to destroy men by the voraciousness of their desire. In siting the source of Tony's wound at the source of his birth, DePalma also makes reference to the rejecting mother, whose dis gust and indifference destroy Tony no less than the fictitiously orgasmic woman who marks him.6 Both sexual pleasure and the reproductive process are treated with fascinated revulsion. As Freud explains, "It often happens that neu rotic men declare that they feel there is some thing uncanny about the female genital organs. This unheimlich place, however, is the entrance to the former Heim [home] of all human beings, to the place where each one of us lived once upon a time and in the beginning (245).7 In Scarface, Tony describes his longing to come to America, where he will be (briefly) reunited with his mother. DePalma twists the conventional portrayal of the United States in gangster films as the promised new land by treating it instead as the site of Tony's frustrat ed desire to return to the womb. Tony's eponymous mutilation, which func tions as much as his name to identify him, also labels him as distorted and, in the Frankenstein tradition, monstrous, associated with waste parts. He has been patched, sewn together, remade, and is only spuriously whole. It is also worth noting that the single word Tony uses more than any other is "fuck," which is heard in the film a staggering 181 times and which is always used to represent the extreme of hostile anger or disgust.8 The continual associations among sex, anger, nar cissism, ambition, and violence in Scarface fuse the gangster and horror traditions in the figure of a monstrous businessman. The Perfect Beast II: The Offal Truth No?l Carroll's fission model of monstrous biology considers shape changing as another method by which repressed fears get expressed in the horror film. Through inges tion of some potion or in conjunction with some natural event, such as the rising of the moon, the outwardly normal man or woman is physically transformed, usually into a beast. Such moments of transformation allege the instability of personal identity, the plea sures and terrors of losing control, the beast(s) within us all. DePalma intensifies the classic gangster's violent energy by altering Tony Montana's chemical makeup with large quantities of cocaine. Tony's monstrous metamorphosis is not complete until he resorts to drug depen dency. While the drug does not literally cause Tony to change shape, it affects his actions stunningly: the mind-altering substance is the direct, even sole, agent of Tony's fall, in much the same way as a mad scientist's potion is the catalyst for transformation. In the film's final sequence, Tony repeatedly drops his face into a mountain of cocaine, which makes him confused and soporific? until he sees an army of gunmen pouring over his grounds on the closed-circuit TV security system. Then he rallies, roars to his feet, and, in a display of phallic contentiousness, poises the biggest gun in his arsenal between his legs. Acknowledging the horror convention that traps victims inside what initially seem to be safe havens, DePalma has Tony first cower in his bullet-proof fortress, then reverse the convention by boldly attacking his attackers. That he chooses a weapon that he presents as a phallus ("Say hello to my little friend!") renders his shape changing sexual as well. With one shot from this monstrously enlarged organ, he blows down the thick wooden door of his office and destroys half a dozen men on the other side, each of whom is equipped with much smaller, conventional firearms. Tony has become a creature, a thing of enlarged parts and phenomenal power, and will be destroyed as a supercharged beast rather than as a man. Probably the most unfor gettable images of Tony come during his death throes, as his body takes scores of bullets without collapsing and he screams out threats and challenges to his assailants. His agonized refusal to die visually recalls movie monsters from King Kong and Frankenstein to Jaws and JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 49.1-2 (Spring-Summer 1997) 45</page><page sequence="8">When Tony's fortress is assaulted, he first cowers in his supposed haven, much as the vic tims of traditional horror films did, then he takes up his "little friend" to attack his attack ers in a sequence of horrific violence. A Nightmare on Elm Street but fundamentally is related to creatures in the shape-changing tradition as well, for it is Tony's cocaine induced mania that gives him the physical power to withstand endlessly repeated gunfire. Acting itself, and especially the use of deforming disguises, in turn invites some mediation between the actor's private and public personas. Any actor who inhabits a role may be said to be a shape changer, but the actor in a horror film must be made to look inhuman, or at least unlike the actor himself?even though it may be his personal attractions that brought him fame in the first place.9 The jagged scar that bisects Tony Montana's face indicates his history of vio lence, but it also suggests a tie to monstrous ly anthropomorphic creatures, beginning with the monster in Frankenstein, also disfigured by a prominent facial scar. If the strangely powerful, skewed bodies of film monsters have enthralled us, it is even more strikingly their faces to which our eyes have remained glued over the years, their faces that the camera most often frames with rapt attention as we try to read their markings as signs of their intentions. DePalma's Scarface is a man whose face is conspicuous ly scored and deformed, but this mark no longer signifies a connection to a historical gangster?"Scarface" Al Capone?who bore an infamous scar. Where Hawks and Hecht capitalized on a living criminal whose exploits were legendary, DePalma profits more from the iconographie facial disfigure ment characteristic of the horror film. A final kind of horror hybridization at work in Scarface can be read as a radicalization of the "fission" dynamics Carroll proposes. Unlike the gangster cycle, which has endured fluctu 46 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 49.1 -2 (Spring-Summer 1997)</page><page sequence="9">ations in popularity, horror films have flour ished over the decades, with a few major shifts in conventions. DePalma incorporates elements from both the classic monster movies and more recent slasher films into his gangster-horror synthesis; as a result, the humanity of his gangster during or despite his monstrous deeds comes under closer scrutiny than is possible in traditional gangster cinema. One crucial scene in the 1983 Scarface that problematizes Tony's aberrance is his early encounter with some Colombian drug dealers with a chain saw: the sequence resonates dis turbingly with the graphic violence of the slasher film. The closest reference is, of course, to Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), a cult favorite that has been subjected to much critical scrutiny. A deranged family, formerly occupied in slaughtering meat, now tortures, executes, and feeds on human victims. During the course of the narrative, this group kills four out of the five young people left helpless after their van has broken down at the family's backwoods door. A "Final Girl" (as she has been dubbed) escapes the chain saw-wielding killer after prolonged and gruesome combat. This formula has been repeated with resound ing commercial success since 1974. Char acteristic of this trend is the graphic nature of the violence; the frequent use of point-of view shots to create a complicated exchange among the victim, tormentor, and viewer; the youth of the victims; their sexual activity; and the open-ended nature of the conclusion. Seldom if ever are the killers destroyed; if they are brought to justice, they are released in time for a sequel. This lack of closure has led Andrew Tudor to differentiate what he calls the "secure" horror of the classic genre films from the "paranoid" horror of the post 19708 genre contributions (103^). DePalma makes suggestive use of the narra tive and stylistic conventions of "paranoid" horror by placing his gangster in an unusual ly horrifying situation: when Tony goes to make a drug buy, he is menaced not by a gun (the tool of his trade), but by a chain saw. The people who kill his accomplice and threaten Tony are Colombian, not Cuban, carrying forward the generic gangster depiction of war among immigrant groups for criminal author ity.10 At the same time, the extreme vicious ness and brutality of the attack, far beyond anything characteristic of the gangster films of any period, demonstrate a fascination with the monstrous nature of violence that owes its vitality to the splatter film. The chain saw scene in Scarface recapitulates some of the conventions of slasher films and rewrites others. It evokes Psycho (1960), often considered the inaugural slasher movie, by setting the attack in a shower and by replaying that film's obsessive interest in voyeurism. Since then, the Texas Chainsaw movies have made iconographie the use of big power tools as weapons of aggression, and DePalma's use here of a motorized chain saw portends his next exercise in horror, Body Double, in which a man kills a woman with a power drill. The thinly veiled sexual joke in that film has struck some viewers as distinctly unfunny, yet the potency of these mechanical phalluses to terrify and quell their victims is undeniable. Carol Clover notes that the gun is not the weapon of choice in the slasher film, whose "emotional terrain ... is pretechnological." She continues: The preferred weapons of the killer are knives, hammers, axes, icepicks, hypo dermic needles, red hot pokers, pitch forks, and the like. . . . But the use of noisy chainsaws and power drills and the nonuse of... bow and arrow, spear, cat apult, and even swords, would seem to suggest that closeness and tactility are also at issue_Knives and needles, like teeth, beaks, fangs, and claws, are per sonal, extensions of the body that bring attacker and attacked into primitive, ani malistic embrace (198). Much of the power of the death-dealing "embrace" in Scarface, which Tony nonethe less survives, derives from our competing desires to see and to avert our eyes from such a dreadful scene. The sequence begins with JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 49.1-2 (Spring-Summer 1997) 47</page><page sequence="10">the character's failure to see and interpret correctly. When Tony meets the Colombian drug dealers at their hotel to make his first important purchase in America, it is crucial that he assess the danger accurately. He mis takes the chatty manner of the head of the gang for ineptitude, when, in fact, the man is stalling for time while an assistant creeps up with a gun. Moreover, Tony assumes that the woman lying on the bed watching television is powerless, irrelevant; a minute later, she pulls an enormous gun out from beneath the pillow, springing a strangely phallic sur prise. Because of these errors, Tony will be forced to watch the excruciating torture and dismemberment of his accomplice, Angel. But though the individual gang members brandish guns, the instrument that inflicts the torture is a chain saw. In keeping with slasher conventions, the weapon enforces a tactile relation between the victim and his attacker. At the same time that Tony is being forced to watch the unwatchable, the audience is repelled and attracted, wondering anxiously how much it will be forced (permitted?) to see.11 Furthermore, the segment is edited to scan quickly, so that a viewer is frequently unsure of what he does see, as opposed to what he expects or imagines.12 And the prob lem of seeing horrible images like these is exacerbated by many viewers' practice of watching gory sequences through their upraised, protective fingers. The desire to look is ambivalently indulged by the peeka boo game: the urge to hide one's eyes, to shield oneself from the unspeakable, is matched only by the equally strong desire to see the unimaginable made visual.13 "It is no surprise," says Clover, "that the rise of the slasher film is concomitant with the development of special effects that let us see with our own eyes the 'opened' body" (198). The "fascination [in the slasher film] with flesh or meat itself as that which is hidden from view" has a particularly sexual compo nent here. As Tony asserts throughout Scarface, "The only thing that gives orders in this world is balls," and the threat of dis memberment therefore speaks directly to his fear of castration, of being without the power to give orders. In fact, when he is forced to watch Angel's murder and then is chained in the shower to be tortured himself, he is already powerless; he cannot even act to free himself, let alone force anyone else to act. His passivity, his "ball-lessness" feminizes him, in a twist that reiterates the sexual shape changing of the woman on the bed, who ini tially appears passive but actually commands the biggest, most powerful gun in the room. (Tony regains his "balls" as soon as his friend Manolo enters and he is able to "arm" himself again; he quickly begins giving orders and seizes a gun, the traditional gangster weapon of penetrating power.) Moreover, the threat/promise of the "opened body" in Scarface completes in a literal way the dissection of the criminal psyche per formed thematically in the classic gangster films. The gangster picture explores its pro tagonist's illicit acts and violent ambition? foreign to (or repressed by) the average per son?and opens him up in a figurai way for our observation and pleasure. Here again the horror film is, by comparison, explicit; not only does it render that which is foreign as inhuman or monstrous, but it now also shows us the internal organs of the monster. To be more precise, the horror film offers to show us the monster's viscera. In Scarface, the chain saw first emasculates Tony by depriving him of his (masculine) ability to lead, then finishes the job by offering to fem inize him by opening his body with the chain saw. The phallicity of the weapon of choice invites a reading of the opened body as vagi nal, the gaping wounds as female. In the econ omy of masculinity and virility proffered in this scene, Tony has nothing to trade?except perhaps his refusal to take the threat seriously. Even after Angel's death, when Tony is chained up and threatened, he betrays no fear: he rebuffs his attacker's offer of clemency by spitting in the man's face and saying "Fuck you" with no apparent anxiety. His sang-froid is both appalling and appealing; his passivity 48 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 49.1-2 (Spring-Summer 1997)</page><page sequence="11">is both forced and chosen. His ability to remain untouched by the shocking gore around him "opens" him in another way to the audience, too: we now know, at a still early stage in the film, what Tony is capable of, what he can withstand. As shocking as the Colombians' cruelty is, Tony's ability to endure it coolly, even mildly, contradicts what we expect as his appropriate response and creates him as unfathomably Other, as monstrous and inhuman. Thus, we identify Tony as belonging natural ly to the group that at present terrorizes him. This parity leads back to the classic gangster hero, who is not very different from the pow erful mobsters he would displace and who cannot imagine a political or an economic sit uation that would make his violence unneces sary. The horror film's "creature" and the gangster film's criminal hero turn out to be oddly compatible monsters. The Bitter End Scarface is taut with unreconciled claims, making its patrimony as monstrous and mis shapen as that of any horrific creature cap tured on film. DePalma mixes secure and paranoid horror conventions liberally, uncon cerned by the explosion his own mad experi ment might cause in the genre laboratory. His creation, Tony Montana, is born of the unholy coupling of monsters like Frankenstein and Texas Chainsaw's Leatherface, and the result is an ungainly hybrid of various horror tradi tions, a monstrously willful child who is relentless, invincible. When these horrific ingredients are combined with the conventions of the classic gangster cinema, the mix becomes even more volatile. On the one hand, the horror elements restore a cathartic inevitability to the final shootout; on the other, the overblown violence of the chain saw scene, and the associations it creates with splatter films, disrupt the conventional restora tion of order that ends the gangster film. The vaguely ethnic background of the classic gangster adds to his foreignness, whereas locating Tony's threat in a specific group of immigrants at a precise historical moment (Cuban refugees in Miami in 1980) makes a formerly tractable difference crucial, irre deemable, Other. The gangster's volatility has always formed part of his appeal, but his instability in DePalma's film is radical. To remake Hawks is, for DePalma, to dismem ber him. From the opened body of the classic film DePalma takes his parts, suturing them raggedly in places and with surgical precision in others. But for all Scarface's elaborate, confused parentage, it evokes Dr. Franken stein's exulting cry as his creature begins to stir: "It's alive!" The uneasy resolution of Scarface's narrative emblematizes the difficulties a generic hybrid faces. Its extreme vividness and its confused reception by audiences who were committed to Scarface as either a remake of Hawks's original or a new-style slasher film?but not both at once?speak to the problems and opportunities of the revitalized, postmod ernist 1980s gangster film.14 In fact, the mul tiple cross-generic conventions in DePalma's Scarface accurately represent the gangster films in this decade. A renewed fascination with the urban ethnic criminal, always an alarming and "foreign" figure, now extended itself to encompass scheming female mafiosi (Prizzi's Honor), comically inept lawmen (Married to the Mob), and all-singing, all dancing African American mobsters (The Cotton Club) in its field of vision. Repeatedly, the gangster formulas were combined with and skewed by the conven tions of other generic forms (film noir, the screwball comedy, the musical). Repeatedly, these hybrids presented the problem of Otherness and resolved it by containing the threat the outsiders posed, although in novel, ingenious ways compatible with the expecta tions created by each new generic overlay. The gangster hybrids of the 1980s represent ed a backlash against the empowerment campaigns of the 1960s and '70s, move ments that provided the genre's new materi al even as they fueled the anxiety these films express.

He adds that Hawks "monsters up" Scarface: "Hawks recon ciles his breakneck speed with images whose tur bulent, expressionist backgrounds contradict everything usually said about Hawks's plain style. At this transition point in his career he could still get the best of both worlds" (18). 3 Catholic publisher Martin Quigley said that Scarface "presents heroically the exploits of a criminal, snowing him as rich, courageous, and cunning against contrasting characteristics on the part of the guardians of the law. It glorifies crime, presents methods of crime, and familiarizes the audience with them. Even though the crirriinal is brought to justice in the final scenes it is an influ ence against law and order." See also Black 124-31. 4 Compare Warshow's claim that "the gang ster speaks for us, expressing that part of the American psyche which rejects the qualities and the demands of modern life, which rejects 'Americanism' itself" (130) with Wood's con tention that the more recent horror film embodies a "spirit of negativity, an undifferentiated lust for destruction, that seems to lie not far below the surface of the modern collective consciousness" (Hollywood 93). Scarface may be located at the intersection of Warshow's "rejection of 'Americanism'" and Wood's "undifferentiated lust for destruction." 5 Wood asks, "Can the [horror] genre survive the recognition that the monster is its real hero?" (Hollywood 109). With Scarface, horror extends its tentacles into the compatible generic system of the gangster, in which the "monster" has always been the "hero." 6 Jack Nicholson's bandaged nose provides the opportunity for a similar exchange in Chinatown. When a tiresome law enforcement agent harasses Nicholson's character, the private investigator claims that his nose was cut when the policeman's wife "got excited" and "closed her legs too fast." The capriciousness and potency of a woman's desire is imaged in both films as fearsome but itself desirable; the men compete for the distinc tion of being damaged by a vagina dentata. 7 In this passage, Freud also discusses the phrase "Love is home-sickness": "Whenever a man dreams of a place or a country and says to himself, while he is still dreaming: 'this place is familiar to me, I've been here before,' we may interpret the place as being his mother's genitals or her body" (245). Issues of patriotism and repatriation take on a different cast when the mother replaces the father as the central figure. My reading relies on Carol Clover's application of Freud's term "unheimlich." 8 Richard Corliss offered this count as "con servative." 9 Boris Karloff tells a wonderful story about being cast in Frankenstein that underscores this point: James Whale, the director,... was lunching at a nearby table. Suddenly he caught my eye and beckoned me over.... He asked me to sit down. I did, holding my breath, and then he said, "Your face has startling possib?ities... ." I cast my eyes down modestly, and then he said, "I'd like you to test for the Monster in Frankenstein." It was shattering?for the first time in my life I had been gainfully employed long enough to buy myself some new clothes and spruce up a bit?actually, I rather fancied meself ! Now, to hide all this new-found beauty under monster-makeup? I said I'd be delighted (Lindsay 54). 10 Enrique Fernandez claims that Scarface fails to comprehend the experience of exile; he also comments on the crew's difficulties with the Cuban community in Miami, which result ed in the production being moved to Los Angeles (74). 11 If DePalma had had his way, we would have seen a lot more than splattering blood. The uncut version of the film, which received an X rating, contained several shots of Angel's severed limbs. These shots were sacrificed to gain an R rating (McGuigan 122-25). 12 The classic example of such confusion occurs in Psycho. After seeing the shower scene, many viewers remain convinced that they have seen the killer's knife piercing flesh. This scene confused the censors, too, who insisted that Hitchcock remove the footage of Janet Leigh's bare breasts?shots that also did not exist (Rebello 48). 13 See Wilhams for a full discussion of this phenomenon. 14 Isabel Pinedo makes a compelling argument that the post-1960s horror film merits the label "postmodern," since it "constructs an unstable, open-ended universe in which categories col lapse, violence constitutes everyday life, and the irrational prevails" (29). The instability of a gang ster-horror hybrid like Scarface suggests that this label may be even more widely applicable. Works Cited Black, Gregory D.
