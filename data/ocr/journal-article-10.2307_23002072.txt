<plain_text><page sequence="1">M.R. Gautam The sound of music To understand Indian music fully, in its essence, it is necessary to have a synoptic vision of the physical, psychological, aesthetic and spiritual aspects. Therefore, raga could be best described as an aesthetic gestalt because it is something much more than the sum total of its external components. It has a distinct personality, a bhava and a rasa. It is considered as the language of emotions. No other music of the world has any musical form resembling the raga of Indian music. It is both secular and spiritual, depending on how one takes to it because the fundamental difference in approach of the Indian and the Western outlook on art, including music, is that the former is centripetal and the latter is centrifugal. In Indian music, the study and practice of the raga and also tala is, in fact, a voyage of discovery to the very source of all sound and rhythm, which is nada and lay a. Nada at the source is not the audible sound of music but the cosmic vibratory Energy through whose irradiation the entire universe has been created. And lay a is the divine immanent rhythm which is inextricably integrated with nada. Therefore, the state ment so often heard from master musicians that one's musical notes should emanate from the nabhi or the inadequate English equivalent, navel, has enormous significance which those great musicians themselves did not realise because the nabhi is the centre of paravak or the vibratory Energy and the primordial source of all sounds. The only way to cognise this is through prana which should not be mistaken for breath. Prana is the source and cause of breath. It is the base on which all sounds, feelings and activities of man rest. Modern science has proved that there is a common energy which manifests itself in various ways in sound, colour, feelings and that they are all therefore interconvertible. That is why the colour blue is supposed to indicate bhakti (devotion); ochre, detachment; yellow, spiritual; green, jealousy; red, anger; etc. Many interesting 87</page><page sequence="2">88 / India International Centre Quarterly experiments are being conducted in the USSR and Germany about the inter-relation between colour and sound which I had the opportunity of seeing when I visited these countries. Therefore, the cognition of prana and establishing oneself in it is no different from prana-cintan Yoga which is one aspect of Patanjali's raja Yoga and his asthadha prakrtti. That is why music and all arts and learning were known by the term vidya signifying that true learning would lead man to immortality. Similarly the origin of tala was from chanda (metre). The word tala is from the Sanskrit root tal which means the palm of the hand. The ex tended connotation would be rhythm as denoted by the use of the hands. Some believe that tala is an acrostic word combining the first syllables of the word tandava and lasya of Siva and Parvati, respectively. We shall return later to consider the linkage of the concept of tala to the under standing of the time-space continuum. But what is music in its fundamental sense? Could it be defined as an eidetic art of the material resources exemplified in subjective processes qua pure possibilities? From primitive man onwards, music was used as a means to express an idea, depending on his qualitative apprehension of the resources at his disposal and the modes of symbolism he evolved from them. In the beginning, the idea was expressed through symbolic sounds. These syllables also served to evolve a spirit or frighten it away. The idea was not clearly formulated into words but expressed directly in sound without the mediation of an intelligible sequence of words. Later, one finds that the logical thought and the musical motif pass little by little from the indefinite to the definite in the course of a song as if the initial dream-state were gradually yielding to wakeful consciousness. To primitive man, melody and sound had great significance; they had a magic power which was not abused but used judiciously. For instance, in the Solomon Islands, when young men sang and one of them suddenly took a high note which others could not follow and a young girl took it up in the same high register and continued it, it meant that the two people were in love. A melody is not a chance combination of notes but an organic and dynamic whole, a form which is more than the simple sum of the notes of which it consists. The artificial placing together of single notes in succession would be a synthetic product and, therefore, bereft of musical life. Even the aboriginal would discard such a melody as "powerless" because it is not able to offer a "dwelling place" to a spirit. A primitive melody may not have the sophistication of intricate harmony or variation of subtle tonal textures; it is merely a continuous repetition of varied motifs, regulated essentially by the tension between the beginning of the motif and the last note. All the notes in between are determined by con scious striving towards the last note. But the significant point to note is</page><page sequence="3">M. R. Gautam / 89 that the motif and the series of its repetitions grow according to definite patterns which can assume the most varied forms depending on a par ticular culture or the ideas and feelings expressed. Thus, music is a mode of thinking in tones and rhythms. Hearing of simple music stimulates different types of awareness. Music always conveys some sense although the tones, except in the strictly physical sense, are incapable of definition as the substance of the tones hardly forms the vehicle of thought. This is specially true of primitive music. We have to discover the fundamental principle by which a certain organisation of sounds makes sense. Here the analogy of language would be useful. Language is a mode of thinking in words. Words are symbols for things and acts, their qualities and their mutual relations. The association of symbols with objects and actions forming new words and later on sentences comprises, in short, the genesis and evolution of language. Just as in language the verbal syntax, which is the fundamental convention of speech, has its roots in human experience, so also in music, the syntax of notes is just as important and is based on human experience. It is as easy to make nonsense with words as with notes. For example, you can say: "Gopal music to perfectly sweet listens". You can make equally little sense when you sing: ga re ni ma ga pa re ma ni. Both are meaningless but the first sentence when expressed thus becomes intelli gible: "Gopal listens perfectly to sweet music". Similarly, the musical fragment when expressed thus would make more sense: ga pa ma ni re magfl re. Like language, music is a conventional utterance, assuming in different periods, the forms to which it is constrained by its relation to the existing conventions of life. Therefore, it has its own intrinsic laws dictated by the nature of the musical substance. But its growth is, strangely, in spite of these laws, not because of them. When we talk of these laws we are proceeding a little towards stylised music but before we come to that, we should consider folk music. Folk music is the unconscious expression in melody of the racial or ethnic feelings, character and interests of a people. It is music created by the common people or peasantry without the benefit of any scientific training. It chronicles their lives in terms of design, melody and rhythm and over a period of time, becomes part of their tradition. Scientists believe that the human voice grew out of savage yelps and grunts and the first steps in the history of musical development can be traced in its primitive fragments of time and rhythm. Therefore, the natural music of a people depends on their temperament, culture and habits. For example, "the music of a demonstrative people is rhythmic and lively; of a saturnine people, gloomy; of a melancholy and poetic people, pathetic; of matter-of-fact people, simple, direct and unelaborate; of a lively people, merry and light".1</page><page sequence="4">90 / India International Centre Quarterly There are many other theories about the origin of music such as those proposed by Charles Darwin, Rousseau, Herder, Spencer, Wallascherve and Buecher.2 It is not necessary to go into their respective details and merits here. But the theory of Carl Stumpf that music arose, like speech, from the need to give signals by sound and speech indeed is protomorphic music. It may be somewhat oversimplifying the close relationship between language and music but nonetheless it is possible to speculate "sound language" as the common source of both speech and music. Language can be considered merely a sort of levelled-down music. When the meaning of the syllable depends on the pitch at which it is uttered, the language naturally tends to become musical. Sound language gave birth to both speech and music, the former striving towards free rhythm and the latter towards a more regulated one. Here I wish to express my difference of opinion with Western scholars like Stumpf. I believe that the very expression "free rhythm" used by Stumpf for language seems a contradiction in terms because the very word 'rhythm' implies regulation or uniform recurrence. To carry this logic forward, rhythm is implicit in all arts but not in language, unless it is specially spoken with a specific accent or feeling. Because there are two basic forms of rhythm—morphological and psychic—it is common to all arts including architecture which Samuel Johnson called "frozen music". Where there is feeling, there is psychic rhythm. Rhythm is the expression of the regulation of a form of feeling, either psychic or structural. Rhythm is a kind of dance of the heart. Moreover, I do not believe in the interconnection of language and music and the evolution of the latter from the former as Western scholars do. My belief is that music all over the world has evolved out of the inter jectional and exclamatory expression of feelings—of men as well as animals. Language of words is valid only to man but what of animals? They also have a language but it is the language of sounds, as when a dog is playing or is angry or sad. The fundamental difference between the language of words and the language of sounds is that the former is a mediate and the latter is an immediate form of communication. The latter has an immediate appeal and is easily and instinctively appreciated. Even poetry is a mediate art. I would go even further to state that the natural occurrence of storm and thunder is an interjectional expression of the clash of clouds. At one time Western scholars would have de nounced this as a pathetic fallacy since they considered it fallacious to impose human feelings on nature. However, it has now been recognised and acknowledged by eminent scientists of the world that even so-called inanimate objects like stones and metals have a dormant consciousness. Nacaitanyamvidyate is an old Sanskrit saying which corroborates this new theory. Apart from Stumpf, the theories of others have been rejected as untenable or only partially tenable.</page><page sequence="5">M. R. Gautam / 91 The realistic imitation of natural sounds forms an important part of primitive music. Then followed totemistic music with its concept of anthropomorphism, representing animals, stones, plants, wind, musical instruments, almost the entire order of society. An interesting fact is the enormous importance given to sound as the mysterious bond uniting all things existing in the universe. It was believed that if a man who represented the totem god—say, of a snake, tiger or frog—could imitate the cry of that particular animal to perfection, he would obliterate the boundary between the subject and object and identify himself with the totem and, in fact, would become the totem. This is indeed very significant because it is this concept which assumed a different dimension in Indian classical music. The legends regarding the production of rain and the creation of fire through singing raga Megh-Malhar and raga Deepak or the materialisation of the deity of a raga by singing the Dhyana mantra of that raga and the raga itself with fervent devotion, are all part of the same phenomenon of the total merging of the subject-object into a creative void. The solid spiritual base of Indian music needs to be stressed. Our Jati gana was considered as gandharva sangita because it was believed that it not only pleased the gandharvas or celestial beings but also the gods. The jatis not only gave rise to material prosperity (abhyudaya) but unseen spiritual benefits (adrsta phala). This music, which in turn founded the Sama Vedic music, was not meant for the masses. But at the same time there was secular music which was known as Gana. This consisted of Grama ragas—six in all as mentioned in the earlier Sanskrit text, Naradia Siksa (150 bc). Indian music, for over two thousand years, has had two parallel streams of evolution—the sacred music consisting of Vedic and Jati Sangita and profane or secular music consisting of Gana and Grama ragas, Bhasas, Vibhasas and Antarabhasas. Jati gana with its elaborate Grama murchana system gradually faded out by Tenth century ad, whereas, Gana, i.e. Grama-raga with its feminine counterparts such as Bhasa, flourished and grew into Margi and Desi sangita. Later on Margi sangita was supplanted by Desi sangita. In this connection, it is interest ing to note the change in Margiya sangita in the course of about eight centuries. In the Natyasastra, Bharata states that Margiya sangita is spiritual music like Vedic music. He distinguishes it from Gandharva sangita. Later Gandharva sangita itself came to be referred to as Margiya. A few centuries later, in the time of Matanga, the secular music of Grama ragas came to be called Margiya sangita. After Matanga, the term Margiya began getting mixed up with Desi sangita. By Thirteenth century ad, at the time when the magnificent work Sangitaratnakara was composed, Jati gana had practically died out and</page><page sequence="6">92 / India International Centre Quarterly had been replaced by Grama raga. At this stage, it is important to delve into the two unique contributions of Indian music, namely, raga and tala. The raga evolved from both the Jati and the Grama raga. It has incorporated in it the ten luksanas or characteristics of its matrix, the jati. But in the course of the centuries, it steadily began to shed its rigidities and became more vulnerable to free improvisation. Raga, in its etymological sense, means a colouring, a sonic dyeing of the conscious ness in various sonic colours of the notes. Although apparently rigid in structure, when mastered, a raga is capable of infinite improvisation, e.g. Yaman, Bagesri, Malkauns, Bhairva, Bhairavi, etc. Here the raga will stand comparison with our yoga. Just as in yoga, the rigours of intense discipline are calculated to realise total release from the thraldom of not only the flesh but from all attachment,inasimilarway the restrictions in the structure of the raga would vanish with the attainment of adequate mastery in all the aspects of the raga—technical, aesthetic and emotional. In other words, to achieve effortlessness of expression it requires tre mendous sedulous and continuous effort. A discussion of the quality of effort would lead us to the study of the metaphysics of effort which again would take us to the edge of mysticism. I shall briefly deal with the concept and evolution of tala. Tala was the function to measure time of a musical rendering. Time was considered to be eternal by itself and, therefore, unlimited. The fundamental ques tion, then, was whether time could be measured and if so how. Time is differently conceived in the different schools of Indian philosophy. Time in itself is one but it appears to be many with reference to the changes or events that take place in it.3 The concept of tala is based on the under standing of time-space. Time itself is not measurable; what is measurable is the action or event that takes place in it, the limitation, therefore, being subsequently attributed to time. Thus, time is transitory and relative; it always has a point of reference or a standard of measurement with reference to that through which it becomes perceptible. This time is chronological and consists in the notion of sequence in which certain events are prior and others later. But the time that is eternal is the sub stratum of this partial time. Abhinavagupta calls it the kal-khanda or a portion of time. He further states that it is the action of singing that is actually measured in terms of time. He elucidates Bharata's definition thus: The tala arises from the instrument spoken of as ghana by the application of sasabda kriya such as samya and nisabda kriya such as avapa which embodies action within a portion of time and is essentially a substance, is the means of measuring (literally limiting) the extent of the act of singing.4 In other words tala is conceived by Abhinavagupta to be the means, fashioned out of the sasabda (sounding) and nisabda (silent) kriyas (act)</page><page sequence="7">M. R. Gautam / 93 for measuring the extent of the act of singing, as it is extended in time. If extension be understood as the quality or property of space, then tala is essentially the means of determining and regulating the act of singing in time-space. But Abhinavagupta has referred to only two aspects of tala, namely, movement (kriyas) and divisive time measurement {paricchitti). But there are two other aspects also which are equally important. They are (a) patterns of the division of time, and (b) their cyclic recurrence. Abhinavagupta also says that time cannot be perceived without action5, rather it is time that is the cause of every limitation.6 Time is, as already pointed out, the formal cause of all change; its material cause being the limited objects or particular actions. So action or kriya is a means of determining the divisions of time in its transitory aspect, whereas time is the eternal substratum in which the actions take place. Sarngadeva extended Abhinavagupta's theory of tala being the means of measuring the act of singing in time-space by identifying tala with kala (time). He states, "Providing through action (kriya) measured by units such as laghu etc., the measurement of song (gita), etc. time (kala) is tala."1 To go into the subtle differences in the concept of tala according to Abhinavagupta and Sarngadeva is not germane to this article. Having conceived tala as time, qualified by the measured expanse of the act of singing and the necessity for definite patterns of time divisions and their cyclic recurrence, we find that the patterns of action that determine the forms of tala imply alteration of relative action and rest—the frequency of which produces rhythm (laya) and tempo. So the three factors—time, action and the rate of change (caused by relative action and pause)— constitute tala. Between the period of Bharata (200 ad) and Sarngadeva (1300 ad), there was tremendous development of the tala. In Bharata's time, there were only five Marga talas, namely, Cancatputa, Cacaputa, Satpitaput raka, Udgkatta and Sampakyestaka, whereas by the time Sarngadeva appeared, there were as many as 120 talas. These were known as Desi because in his time Desi ragas constituted the popular classical music. There were eight ways of marking the Marga talas, namely, Avapa, Niskrama, Viksepa, Pravesa, Dhruva, Samya, Tala and Sonnipeta. The development of the Desi talas was closely linked with the development of the prabandhas, many of whose names, were borne by the talas. Structurally, the present-day talas bear a close resemblance to the Desi tala. Though Hindusthani music drifted away a little from the old patterns after the advent of the tala, Karnataka music still retains the old patterns of time divisions. The introduction of the tala was a landmark in the evolution of Hindusthani music because it gave the singer, for the first time, full scope for free improvisation and made possible</page><page sequence="8">94 / India International Centre Quarterly real vilambit (slow) elaboration. Today we have the Dhruvapada, Khyal, Thumri, Tapa, Bhajan, Ghazal—all artistic expressions of man in different moods. These are the direct products of his creative genius. He has summarised his deepest experiences and embodied them in the above indelible forms showing other men, who are not as fortunately endowed as he, that the experience of music cleanses the emotions, makes possible the contract with that source which is the essence of beauty and permanence.□ References 1.
