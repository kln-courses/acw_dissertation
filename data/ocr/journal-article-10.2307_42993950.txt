<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Life of Birds By Joel Carl Welty Third Edition. 754pp. CBS College Publishing. New York. 1982. Geared to undergraduate students of orni- thology, The Life of Birds is beautifully written and well illustrated. Despite Welty's tendency to become anthropomorphic, it is a joy to read. The five chapters on anatomy and physiology are excellent. Beginning with bones and mus- cles, Welty leads the reader through the ner- vous, digestive, circulatory, respiratory, excre- tory, and reproductive systems. His presentation is fascinating because he incorporates ecology and behavior throughout the discussion. His ability to write on these topics with a constant awareness of the birds' everyday life enhances the reader's interest and enthusiasm. Welty's "behavior" chapter clearly explains classical ethological concepts, such as fixed action patterns and innate-releasing mechan- isms, and presents a brief analysis of the nature- nurture controversy. This chapter helps the reader to realize the importance of avian behav- ior to the field of ethology. The chapter entitled "Social Behavior" is deceiving because it deals with only a limited number of topics. Here Welty discusses imprint- ing, dominance hierarchies, and social facilita- tion, and then only briefly mentions topics such as flocking, allopreening, and mobbing. In three later chapters, he accurately and completely cov- ers bird song, territoriality, and courtship and mating habits. I found his treatment of eggs, nesting, incuba- tion, and care and development of the young to be informative and at just the right level for an undergraduate course. A large section of the book is devoted to ecological concepts (100 pages). The titles of the three ecology chapters are "The Numbers of Birds and Their Regula- tion," "The Ecology of Birds," and "The Geo- graphy of Birds." For a student who has had a formal course in ecology, these sections might seem to be somewhat lacking in theoretical analysis. As an ornithological text, however, the information is provided in an appropriate fashion. / i Discovering Science John W.

SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 1982 49</page><page sequence="2">The chapters on flight and migration and orientation fit together well. Welty has kept abreast of the current literature and provides an up-to-date analysis of these subjects. The treatment of the classification of birds is brief, with only nine pages devoted to short descriptions of orders of known birds, living or fossil, and every family of living birds. This is not adequate for teaching purposes, but is the only aspect of the book that seems incomplete. The origin and evolution of the birds is treated in the next-to-last chapter and possibly should be moved up to one of the first chapters. Unfortunately, the figures and tables are sometimes not explained well in the text and seem to be merely placed in close proximity to relevant sections. For instance, Figure 8-11, dis- playing photoperiodism as it relates to the behavior of white-crowned sparrows, has been added to the third edition, yet the information from the figure is not incorporated or explained in the body of the text. The photographic reproductions in the third edition are generally sharper than the same pic- tures in the second edition, although some appear to be either over or underexposed. Fig- ure 14-11 is odd in that it is overexposed and inverted when compared to the same picture in the second edition. The telling sign of the success of a textbook is the reaction to it by good students. On this score, Welty's The Life of Birds has always been suc- cessful, and I imagine it will continue to be a favorite. The book should be used to supplement lecture material; where appropriate, original literature must be assigned. Welty's book pro- vides the undergraduate with an ideal founda- tion upon which the professor of ornithology may build. FredE.
