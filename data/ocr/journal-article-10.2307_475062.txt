<plain_text><page sequence="1">Signs of Borges. By Silvia Molloy. Trans. Oscar Montero, Post-Contem- porary Interventions Series. Durham: Duke UP, 1994. 142 pages. Touted on the cover as being "widely regarded as the best single book on the work of Jorge Luis Borges," this is Molloy's Las letras de Borges (1979) which when first published passed largely unnoticed outside Ar- gentina. On the same cover the author modestly permits Doris Sommer to remark, "I can think of no other scholar of Latin American literature who enjoys and amply deserves the reputation of Silvia Molloy," a view which will cause some ironically-raised eyebrows in the trade. Leaving such banalities where they belong, it should be made clear that this is not a book which can stand beside those of Barrenechea, Christ, Alazraki or McMurray, that is, as helping to create the existing consensus about the basic themes of Borges' work and (less consistently) about his techniques. Molloy disdains such criticism as merely "a tradition of reductive readings" (2). Her view is that Borges's texts are "not hospitable," that they engender "initial rejection," "initial distrust" and even "hostility." We, as common readers, strive to ignore or overcome these reactions and tend to avoid responding to the summons "to read differently" (1-2). Her objective, therefore, is to destabilize our reception of Borges, emphasizing "plural textual masking" and the notion that what we are reading are "shattered texts," endowed with "a vocation for marginality" (3). Where Molloy comes clean is when she writes that Borges' entire work "upholds a constant and</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 135 honest disquisition on writing, his own writing, the writing of others" (4). Those of my generation will recognize the distinctive voice of the 1970's when it was fashionable to assert that books grow out of previous books and not out of observation of what for the sake of convenience we call reality or life. Molloy's initial thesis is that in Borges "the absence of realistic mimesis baffles critics" (7) (with, of course, one exception). This absence derives from his "fecund mistrust of the arbitrary, apparently fixed sign" (6), so that his work is characterized by "occlusive duplicity," "swerves," "shifting dynamics" and "fluctuation." The result, in terms of character-presen- tation, is a shift from an "anthropomorphic image" to "an openly meta- phoric simulacrum" illustrated by the figures in the tales of Historia uni- versal de la infamia. These early figures, who portend later ones, are thus "fragmented, robbed of centrality." As we pass from them to the first really memorable character, Pierre Menard, we are told that behind him stands "a narrator who because of his contradictions is as inconsistent as the character he presents," so that all collapses into "pure indeterminacy" (31). These "textual constructs," however, are more subtle than they seem, and even when they appear to be doubles or contrasting pairs, as in "Los teblogos" or "Historia del guerrero y la cautiva," there is always a third factor disturbing the "reassuring binary oscillations" (47). By now we have reached commentary on individual short stories, always the acid-test. Here Molloy has to meet her own challenge to produce non- reductive readings, which present the stories "differently." Since she avoids reference to other critics, who are brushed aside as resolved "to push Borges into known categories," no readings other than her own are dis- cussed. But no matter; Molloy's readings are predictably just as reductive as anyone else's. The center of the book discusses Borges's techniques for conveying an impression of reality, using "La postulaci6n de la realidad" (Discusi6n) as a starting point. Inter alia, Molloy asserts that "the laconic detail with long-range syntactic consequences and the laconic detail with long range semantic consequences splinter an utterance that at the same time seems to relish these interruptions" (67). I have not been able to find out the meaning of this and sundry other "utterances" in this book, as for example when "the differential and unexplainable residue" of the Discusi6n essay is said to be found "decentered" "in an inserted hypothesis." A less pre- tentious style would have helped. The rest of Signs of Borges veers away from discussion of specific examples taken from the different genres which Borges frequented and consists of rather brief comments on aspects of his writing such as "Distorsion," "Fear of Names," "Divergence" and "Conve- sion," "Disarticulation," "Interpolation" and the like. They contain inter- esting insights, but in the end they become fragmentary and the books</page><page sequence="3">136 Reviews HR 64 (1996) ends abruptly without a clear conclusion. One is left with the impression that it is composed in the main of statements and assertions about Borges, especially the Borges of the earlier essays and fiction, without enough analytical back-up. It uses a technique of bite-sized sub-chapters, not very coherently organized, written with wilful disregard of other Borges criticism and applying certain notions to the texts rather than deriving them from them. In short, an odd choice for the Duke series. DONALD SHAW University of Virginia</page></plain_text>
