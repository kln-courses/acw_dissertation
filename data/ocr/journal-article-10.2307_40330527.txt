<plain_text><page sequence="1">Noah's Ark revisited: On the myth-land connection in traditional Aboriginal thought.1 Erich Kolig* One of the most salient features of tradtional Aboriginal mythology is its intimate connection with the land. In Aboriginal consciousness myth is not free-floating. With few exceptions, myths or mythemes are closely associated with specific geographic locations. Sometimes though, when myths get diffused to distant groups through the religious 'inter-tribal' exchange network, the Aboriginal mythographer may not be clear in his mind which particular places, or topographical conditions of the land, are referred to in the foreign myths. Nonetheless, he will take it for granted that quite specific and concrete loci are linked with them. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that for Aborigines, traditionally, myth - if it is to be taken seriously - without land is simply inconceivable. In my experience, for instance, it is commonly accepted by Aborigines that Biblical mythology is associated with particular places in the 'countries' Israel, Egypt, Canaan, etc. (with the exception related later). And this often leads to the rejection of these myths; not because their veracity appears doubtful, but as they are seen to be relevant to these foreign 'countries' only. Aboriginal belief traditionally holds that mythical conditions and events have become manifested in what exists now as a multitude of physiographic and topographic features of the land. The landscape, that had crudely existed beforehand without a creatio ex nihilo ever having brought it into existence, has been thrown into ever-lasting, immutable shapes by the intervention of the Dreamtime heroes. While some of the land's topography shows passively the formative influence of Dreamtime powers, other features are believed to be the metamorphosed bodies, or body parts, of erstwhile living beings. And yet other features of the land may be believed, though more rarely, to have possessed life themselves, including human-like volition and mortality (Strehlow 1947:27f; Worsley 1967:146). Myths, providing a quasi-record of Dreaming events, primordial beings and their deeds and travels, cover the land with an intricate network of mythic paths (or 'tracks' as Aborigines say) which draw on incalculable geographic detail. No doubt, the connection of myth with land, its sites and scenery, is recognized by Australianists as one of the most eminent features of the Aboriginal Weltanschauung. As R. M. Berndt (1970:10) remarked: 'Without this connection with the land, Aboriginal religion would have been radically different' - and, one might add, society, too. For apparently the myth-land connection has a series of political, social and economic implications. Myth undoubtedly is universal, though of course anthropological, philosophical and psychological speculations as to its reason d'etre diverse sharply. But why do Aborigines tie it so emphati- cally to the land and in so doing differ distinctly from other societies? â™¦ Department of Anthropology, University of Otago, New Zealand. 1 1 am indebted to my Aboriginal guides who led me to and taught me about the sacred places. na</page><page sequence="2">Why should myth at all be tied to land, whether in Aboriginal society or in any other, as it surely can exist on its own? What is the purpose of this connection? Although seldom explicit, Australianists tend toward various explanations which I am roughly grouping according to two paradigmatic views that appear to be fundamental.2 One tends to see myth predominantly as a theory of sorts, designed to give, among other things, explanations of the natural environment, its topography and resources. In this view, myth if connected to the land, is capable not only of explaining the landscape, its genesis and peculiari- ties (see e.g. T. G. H. Strehlow 1947:5), but also of supplying meaningful and useful statements on natural resources, drawing attention to hazards, and helping with geographic orientation. This view which is essentially pragmatic and utilitarian is expressed in the phraseology of myth being a 'route map', a 'store-house of knowledge' about the natural environment and a 'guide' to the natural landscape (R. &amp; C. Berndt 1970:27; 40ff., 206, etc.; R. Berndt 1970:6). More concretely, myth may be seen as a powerful mnemonic device reinforcing vital knowledge of the terrain and economy (Gould 1969:81 and 1977:6). A cognate, derivative view holds that mythopoesis of the kind that heavily draws on the landscape, is prompted by Aboriginal man's emotional need to bring the land and nature within the ambit of the intellectually familiar and thus reduce and buffer the psychologically adverse impact of a stark, often threatening and dangerous landscape (R. Berndt 1976:133). Myth not only defines man's place in nature, but wrongly so, one must deduce, since by humanizing the landscape it glosses over the sinister reality of man's utter dependency. The other major view, developed from the anthropology of Durkheim and Radcliffe-Brown and comprising a variety of otherwise mutually exclusive theoretical stances, shares the notion that myths, what- ever else they are, are linked with the land to legitimate local organization, distribute space and regulate access to land (e.g. Warner 1958:16; Maddock 1974). Distinguishing thus, as I have done, two discrete categorical views is a product of logical ordering and does not fully correspond with actual persons. There are hardly any 'purists'. Charac- teristically, R. Berndt (1973:23) interprets the symbolism of one group of myths as centring on 'ritual and territory' while that of another one as to do with 'explaining natural phenomena, placing them in a human and 2 An interesting attempt has been made to explain the myth-land connection in the Trobriand Islands in terms of an underlying mnemonic and logic structure (Harwood 1976). A logical rank ordering of myth, as to the time sequence involved, is presumed to correspond with a geographical order. Apart from the fact that this hypothesis has been severely criticised for, as it turns out, its eclecticism, arbitrarily excluding or including myths (Carroll 1978), it does not seem to work well for Aboriginal mythology. Some Aborigines apparently do use myth loci to memorize the sequence of events in a myth-cycle. They accompany their mythological reminiscing with drawing dots, signifying loci, in a string linked by lines. Apparently they think of the place first and then associate it with a myth event that is supposed to have taken place there. (The mnemonic linkage is not too difficult as place-names often are taken from the myth-song verses.) But these persons are a minority and their mnemonic technique seems idiosyncratic rather than cultural. Moreover, there are few myths referring specifically to the invention of techniques or social institutions, or to acts of creation, and this makes it difficult to arrange Aboriginal myths into similar categories as used for the Trobriands. Most myths also have such meandering paths as to make it difficult to discern geographic axes. Erich Kolig 119</page><page sequence="3">familiar setting, providing an atmosphere of credibility and familiarity'. Gould believes myth to be reinforcing geographic knowledge (Gould 1973 :7ff.) as well as organizing land attachment of social groups (1969a: 268ff.). Warner sees myths as expressive of seasonal cycles, i.e. as explanations of nature (Warner 1958:393ff.), but also as a social regulator of land and resources (ibid: 16). Also in other respects there is much overlap which confuses my neat categories. So for instance, Berndt's interpretation (1976:133) resembles, at least superficially, Roheim's (1945:7ff.) theory that Aboriginal man libidinizes the hostile environment in myth-fantasies. By engaging in sexual day-dreaming, i.e. mythologizing, Roheim contends, Aborigines make an unpleasant reality more bearable. (This thesis of his, however, is not quite consistent with another one he had propounded earlier (Roheim 1934) and in which he argued that myth redirects libido away from mothers and expresses father-son conflict.) But while Berndt's viewpoint, broadly informed by a positivist outlook, attributes primary importance to an 'external' reality (land and natural environment) and regards myth as expressive of man's need to come to grips, physically, emotionally and intellectually, with natural givens, Roheim's, aprioristically based, allots the primum movens of myth to a condition 'inside' man (libido) which only secondarily draws in the physical reality of the land. Aborigines interpret the myth-land connection ambivalently. Myth events are taken to provide the landscape's aetiology while, inversely, the topographical conditions are accepted as empirical, irrefutable proof of the myths' veracity. Thus by a circular argument the landscape's topo- graphy is believed to be explained truthfully by myth, while at the same time it is taken as cogent evidence of the myth's truthfulness in particular, and the truthfulness of the religious dogma in general, since dogma is enshrined in myth. Myths must be true, I was assured by Aborigines many a time, because the things mentioned in them do really exist. Nowadays one is often assured by Aborigines who wish to stress the myth's veracity: 'when you see it (a particular physiographic feature of the land) you can believe (the myth)', meaning the feature is exactly as the myth relates and hence is capable of bearing testimony to the myth's assertions. While doubtless these are religious truths to Aborigines and as such are deserving of respect without reservation, and while the Aboriginal idiom of thought is valid in itself, analysis is required to determine whether either, or neither, part of the circular argument, or what else, constitutes a true causal explanation of the myth-land connec- tion in an anthropological sense. In this paper I wish to examine whether the myth-land connection serves intrinsically the purpose of myth providing an aetiological theory for the land. But before I do so, I shall look briefly at that part of Aboriginal reasoning that says land evidences or empirically corroborates myth. This contention when taken at its face value does not strike me as a convincing explanation of why myth is so intimately bound to land. Are myths really in need of empirical proof? I think traditionally it did not require such evidence to impart credibility to myth. Myth being axiomatic, its acceptance was not contingent on empirical proof of any kind. As has often been observed, only the western mind puts high priority on empirical evidence in sorting truth from fiction. In most traditional societies religious metaphysics were hardly ever challenged 120 Noah's Ark</page><page sequence="4">Erich Kolig and thus the need for empirically-based defence was obviated.3 When nowadays Aborigines speak of 'when-you-see-it-you-can-believe', I think, they are knowingly or unknowingly catering to a new-fangled skepticism that is quite atraditional. Traditionally, the correspondence of mytholo- gical assertions with empirical evidence does not appear to have been a prerequisite for acceptance of creed. Characteristically, Aboriginal languages, so far as I know, do neither terminologically nor conceptually distinguish between knowing and (religiously) believing, both being seen as one truthful mode of apprehension and cognition as opposed to falsehood and lie. Only in a more convoluted and metonymical sense, I think, is the speech-figure 'when-you-see-you-can-believe' expressive of a traditional reason for the myth-land connection. In order to expound this I shall have to quote Stanner at length. The Aborigines universally believed that ancestral beings had left a world full of signs of their beneficent intent towards the men they had also brought into being. The wisdom about living given to men, cherished by traditional experience, could interpret these outward and visible signs as saying that men's lives had to follow a perennial pattern and, if they did so, men could live away under an assurance of providence (Stanner 1976:20). What better assurance of the divine intent, what more impressive imagery could there possibly be than the apparent eternity, immutability and serenity of the land and its features.4 Aborigines were 'physical philosophers' as Stanner says (1976:34), 'trying to discern a common hidden structure behind the outward appearance of the physical world. Their imagery was material . . .' Aborigines had looked for, and found, in the world around them the signs of divine intent toward men, 'assur- ances' of life and its purposefulness. Thus the land was seen by Aborigines to be full of visible markers and embodiments of interlocking sections of a cosmic structure which in its entirety and fullness remained eternally hidden and could be embraced only as a metaphysical creed. Here I think lies the purpose and meaning of the myth-land connection. Now let me turn to the other part of the Aboriginal statement - that myths serve to explain the landscape - which by and large is identical with the anthropological perspective mentioned earlier.5 I do not doubt that by its basic versatility and through accrued properties myth may come to serve several diverse functions, aetiological, moral, mnemonic, social-ordering, etc. However, in this paper I wish to examine whether 3 Perhaps a somewhat extreme and certainly a most radical contrast to western empiricism is Taoism which attributes higher importance to *what is not', 'pure nothing', than to what is accessible to empirical witnessing in the physical universe. 4 It is not, I think, surprising that C. G. Jung saw rocks and minerals as informing an archetype of stability and everlasting power, counterbalancing the ephemerality and insecurity of human existence. Although his concept of archetype is highly debatable, ethnographic material he has drawn together demonstrates that man in many societies, impressed by the immutable qualities of rock, has seen it as revelatory of special, cryptic meaning (C. G. Jung 1964: passim). 6 Outside Australian aboriginal anthropology a major exponent of the 'theory- perspective' on myth is A. E. Jensen, who in his classic work Mythos and Kult bei NaturvÃ¶lkern attributes to it culture-aetiological functions (1960:78ff.) - though not quite consistently insisting at the same time on its being zweckfrei (Jensen 1960:v). 121</page><page sequence="5">Noah's Ark there is ground for the assumption that myth is connected with land for the intrinsic reason of myth to explain the land. This view, developed mainly from Tylor (his 'Myth of Observation', 1964:67ff.), Frazer, and more recently Popper and Jarvie, rests on two major premises: first, that myth is theory and its primary function is to be explanatory of the real world and its phenomena. (See especially Popper 1972:84, 146, 285f., 348 on myths as 'pre-criticism' theories. This view was already implicitly employed by Marx.) Second, that mythopoesis, insofar as it draws specifically on geography and natural topography, is induced by the physical reality of the land. Mythopoesis of the kind that produces myths which are closely and inextricably tied to geography is prompted as it were by man's physical existence in a particular land of given features and characteristics. Hunter-gatherers, indisputably, are vitally concerned with environmental configurations surrounding them, causing them to speculate about them and in the process transforming, intellectually, what has been unfamiliar, threatening into the familiar, friendly. Owing to physical need, they address their theory-producing mental capabilities to the environment and by using the intellectual raw material myth and tying it to the land in which they have to live, come up with theoretical if pre-scientific statements. So, I believe, would be the relevant argument. Even though Bushmen turn out to associate their myths less emphatically to features and places of the land, for Aborigines at least this does not on first sight seem an unreasonable assumption. In what follows, however, I shall question its validity. Aboriginal mentality, being neither primitive nor pre-logical in the Levy-Bruhlian sense, presumably employs means not different from ours for theory formation. If myths are found wanting in the properties expected of theories, it must be inferred, therefore, that they are not meant to be theories (in Popper's sense).6 Broadly, my argument rests on Levi-Strauss' assertion that natural phenomena are not what myths seek to explain, but are rather the medium through which myths try to explain facts which are themselves not of a natural but logical order (Levi-Strauss 1966:95). Anthropologists studying Aboriginal myth usually experience its land- connectedness as a fait-accompli. Such a static, post hoc rationalizing perspective necessarily is less revealing than a processual one, i.e. one based on empirical observation of how myth becomes attached to land. This may not only reveal the 'how', but may go some way toward explaining the 'why' of the connection. The ethnographic case by which I attempt to reconstruct the process of a myth's attachment to land is centred around Noah's Ark. This particular myth version and its site of manifestation combine to form a discrete syndrome, replete with millen- nial and redemtive features, and also are distinctly set apart from the well-known Christian belief element Aborigines are commonly familiar with. Although the myth has originally been known only locally in a 6 There is a parallel here to the dispute about whether or not Aborigines had knowledge of human physiological procreation. The question is whether the dogma stressing a spiritual and parthenogenetical origin of humans at the expense of insemination is to be taken as a theory, i.e. as reflecting the state of knowledge about the real world in a given society, or as simply a statement of belief irrespec- tive of secular knowledge. As Leach has powerfully argued (1969) knowledge of causalities in the natural world and speculations about ultimate meanings are two different things. Similarly, as it is implausible that dogma should be a theory, it is to presume myth is. 122</page><page sequence="6">Erich Kolig small area south of the Fitzroy River (in the Kimberleys of Western Australia), owing to a far-flung religious communication network it is now well diffused throughout Aboriginal communities in La Grange (where the PÃ©tris have made brief reference to it; see Petri and Petri- Odermann 1964:465 and 1968:440), Broome, Derby, on stations along the middle and lower Fitzroy River, Fitzroy Crossing and even as far away as Balgo Mission. The particular myth version centres on a site on the Desert periphery - about 70 km south of Noonkanbah Station, just south of the Barbwire Range and east of the Worral Range - where the Ark is supposed to have come to rest after the deluge. There the Ark can still be seen today. But owing to the site's inaccessibility and remoteness it has not been visited by Aborigines for many years, possibly decades. The myth, however, has been thriving all the while developing many a colourful offshoot. Over a period of nine years I made four attempts, all unsuccessful, to reach the site by vehicle, but finally succeeded in spotting it from the air in a single-engine aircraft. Unfortu- nately, while the site was positively identified by a guide, no detail could be made out. Nonetheless, I think this case permits significant insight into the process by which a myth becomes arbitrarily superimposed on a geographic site and embellished over the years. Admittedly, the relevant myth does not belong to the traditional Aboriginal repertory, but I can see no intrinsic reason that would disqualify it from being used for certain extrapolations. The Ark myth conforms to the common type of travel myth which relates how a myth being, or beings, appear coming from a distant 'country' - the exact origin often being unknown - cover a large distance and finally enter the ground whereby the hero, or heroes, become manifested in the form of usually a rock, hill or water-hole on the surface. Over the years and through countless hours of often painstaking discussion, I have gradually come to what I trust is a fairly accurate reconstruction of the myth-land conection. Soon after I had commenced research in the Fitzroy River area, in 1970, I came across the belief in a 'boat left behind by Noah' somewhere south of the Fitzroy River. Later I chanced across an entry in Native Welfare files about an officer having received information on a 'metal boat' on the Desert fringe near the Worral Range. It was speculated that the 'boat' may in actual fact be the fuselage of a crashed aeroplane which on account of their unf amiliarity with planes, Aborigines might have misinterpreted. This seemed not too far-fetched a conjecture, as there had been an Air Force installation on Noonkanbah Station during World War II; and there was also the possibility that a Japanese war plane may have been hit during the raid on Broome and having veered off toward the Desert crashed there. Various Aborigines I discussed the matter with, provided fanciful descrip- tions of the Ark's manifestation from which no unambiguous, clear picture could be inferred. The problem was compounded insofar as those I spoke to had seen the 'boat' many years previously, some of them while they were adolescents. Their fading memory was counterpoised by extravagant fabrications, and some, I suspect, may only have known of the site from hearsay while claiming to have actually seen it. The vague image that gradually emerged was of a strange structure of sorts which Aborigines variously described as a metal contraption, a heavily rusted brittle matter, or a glass-like or crystalline substance. Several additional features emerged 123</page><page sequence="7">Noah's Ark forming an integral part of the entrenched belief: a variety of tools and equipment such as anchor, mast, railing, hatch, spade, crow bar and sledge hammer were said to lie about on the site - with further details varying according to a person's imagination, experience with boats and vocabulary. The Ark was said to be laden with gold and precious stone or mineral, and I was cautioned not to remove anything, presumably in view of the apparent greed of whites for mineral wealth. Not one Aboriginal I discussed the matter with had any doubt that it was really Noah's Ark. As one said, the white man's claim that the Ark had landed somewhere in Egypt (sic) was a lie consistent with the attempt to keep Aborigines in subservience, for Noah had actually come to Australia. I believe this to be a significant statement. The Ark being manifested in Australia, an important cosmic event through benevolent divine intent has been revealed for the benefit of Aborigines. Whites who have claimed a monopoly of this belief, by falsely associating it with a site and event far away in their own 'country', have not only deliberately misled Aborigines, but also have tried to exclude them from obtaining a major revelatory truth. The mythical story commonly agreed upon by Aborigines goes as follows. During the Dreamtime flood, woramba, the Ark Gumana carry- ing Noah, Aborigines and animals, had circumnavigated the St George Ranger, having probably approached them from the north or north-west. It then had drifted south and finally as the waters receded had come to rest in its present position in the 'flood plain' of Djilinbadu. The Biblical deluge corresponds with a traditional flood motif in this region, according to which the lizard woman Luma fleeing the rising waters traversed the region and eventually drowned at what is today the settlement of Looma (see Kolig 1973/4). Some Aborigines embellished the story of the primordial deluge with the opinion that all 'wicked' people, both black and white who had been living in Australia, were drowned and only 'good' Aborigines were spared by having been permitted aboard the Ark. Characteristically, all whites perished then and this is why until Captain Cook's arrival, Australia belonged only to Aborigines. (Others, how- ever, maintained whites also travelled in the Ark and one even suggested that God himself had come along for the ride). The obvious nativistic and mildly xenophobic overtones of this version were further heightened in another one which predicted a deluge to happen when somebody will pull, accidentally or not, the Ark's anchor from the ground and water will be gushing forth from the hole. The millennial augury of this version was that while all whites will subsequently be drowned in a Goetterdaem- merung'liko catastrophe Aborigines would be rescued by the Ark and enter a new blissful era. Tying in with this is the belief that the Ark would sometimes be visible and sometimes invisible, in particular whites being most unlikely to see it. Special techniques were claimed to be required in the approach such as clutching a Bible, or praying, or receiv- ing a dream about the Ark beforehand, or simply arriving accompanied by the present 'boss' of the boat, an elder living in Looma. By employing my own preconception about the nature of truth and fiction, I teased out a series of hard facts on the site, which were later verified - as much as this is possible from the air. The main manifesta- tion of the Ark appears to be a whitish, soft or brittle stone monolith rising no more than approximately one metre above the ground, and 124</page><page sequence="8">Erich Kolig situated in a shallow claypan that fills with water after heavy rain. In the immediate vicinity some veins of similar material appear to run along the surface of the ground, branching out in a radius of probably less than thirty metres. These features are interpreted to be the mast and ribs, or railings, of the boat. The consistency of the monolith seems to be surprisingly soft as one man claimed he could stick a knife in it and reported that somebody else has split it easily with a tomahawk. (Accord- ing to -&gt;ers. comm. from Dr P. Playford, a geologist who has worked in the area, it probably is a lense of siltstone). It is not unimportant to note that several persons had seen the site without noticing the boat, apparently prior to the myth-connection becoming more widely known. One man who had seen, unsuspectingly, the monolith several years ago while mustering cattle in the area - previously there had been a station in the relative vicinity - realized only during our discussion that what he had seen was the famed Ark of Noah. This indicates that there is nothing particularly striking or even faintly suggestive of a boat, of any size or description, about this place. While some claimed that most of the Ark now lies submerged under sand and soil, with only the 'mast' protruding, it remains highly doubtful whether there really is some kind of pÃ©trographie structure attached to the 'mast' underground, which earlier when still visible may have resembled a boat hull. The evidence suggests that the conception of a boat lying half-buried under the sand, more likely than anything else, is the result of a dream vision with no substantiation in either empirical fact or morphological similarity. How did the superimposition of the myth on the site occur? The original 'finder' of the Ark was the father of the present 'boss' who lives in Looma and is well-known among the Aborigines for synthesizing traditional Aboriginal belief with fundamentalist Protestant tenets. His father, known as 'the Gagural' - a title of high honour with mythological connotations - was apparently also versed in Biblical mythology, besides having been an eminent expert of traditional lore and belief, a healer and clairvoyant. Roaming about in the area, he chanced across the site - it is not clear whether he saw it then for the first time or had been already familiar with it for some time. He subsequently received a dream vision in which it was revealed to him that he had found Noah's Ark. Unfortu- nately, there is little to go on concerning when exactly this had happened, but by inference from other data a time about 40 to 50 years ago seems most likely. Early promulgators of the myth and associated site were in close contact with Gagural, initially spreading the word only among Aborigines living on pastoral stations along the lower Fitzroy River. Only much later, owing to a now rapidly expanding communication network among Aborigines, was the message carried much farther afield. Over the years, as the myth gradually spread, the initial revelation was elaborated upon not only producing several local and numerous individual variants, but adding to the myth's standard corpus. For instance, the well entrenched idea of considerable treasures laid up in the boat appears to have been added much later and to have developed from several roots simultaneously. According to one man who provided restrained and reasoned information on the subject, it had occurred to him years after he had seen the Ark that there must be riches heaped up in it. This happened when he worked in the Halls Creek area and saw veins of white stone - some of which, by the way, are quite spectacular and are tourist 125</page><page sequence="9">tfoah'sArk- attractions. These are quartzitic intrusions and in the Halls Creek area they occur in conjunction with gold. Seeing these veins the man felt reminded of the whitish stuff on the site of the Ark and soon made the logical, though geologically improbable and empirically unfounded, con- nection between gold and the light-coloured stone of the Ark. Another contributory factor was the rumor reaching Aborigines about Dutch ship- wrecks found in shallow waters off the Western Australian coastline, and some of which were literally laden with gold coins and other valuable objects. It seems plausible that this information, exaggerated and dis- torted as it may have been when reaching Aborigines, built up the idea that just about every wrecked ship, or Ark for that matter, must contain, treasures. Perhaps not to a small extent the experience Aborigines have with mineral prospecting has had some influence too. Aborigines widely believe that most, if not all, stone and mineral, whether of peculiar appearance or not, must be precious since whites seem to search for them so eagerly. And when Aborigines speak of gold stored away in the Ark they may not mean it literally, but use 'gold' as the common synonym for all kinds of valuable stone. No wonder Aborigines are reluctant to lead Whites to the site, fearing of course their relentless avarice for minerals which may usher in the destruction of the Ark. Then there are less well entrenched variations on the basic theme, such as the belief in the end-time deluge and rescue of true-believing Aborigines. The myth element of the wicked having been drowned presumably is an adjunct of fundamentalist missionary provenance, as that brand of Protes- tantism habitually stresses atonement for sins. Another one about a left- hander having stopped the flood by dripping off blood from the small finger of his left hand, seems to be of traditional origin. Variations range from widely known ones to way-out, idiosyncratic ones that are hardly shared by more than one or two. An example of the latter kind is the belief that a goat - - of all possible guardians - is now 'looking after' the boat. By probing underneath the complex trappings of what this myth may have come to mean to individual persons, some fundamental aspects of the myth-land connection, its meaning and process of attachment can be extrapolated. Above all, the case demonstrates how a mytheme becomes suddenly, arbitrarily and one might say whimsically superimposed on a topographical feature that has been known for a long time. The actual physical appearance of the feature is of no account, as has been shown by the fact that Aborigines gave so many divergent descriptions of the site. They were not deliberately trying to obscure the picture; but to them it was a boat regardless of how it might present itself to the non- believer's eye. All this and more adds weight to the contention that myths do not convincingly present themselves as explanations of the landscape, or as aetiological theories. If myth's function were to explain the land- scape then one would reasonably expect not only a morphological correspondence between myth content and site, but that all geographical points, landmarks or not, are associated with myth. But the fact is that, although virtually all geographic loci are named and thus clearly have entered Aboriginal consciousness as to their distinctive existence, by no means all have a myth. T. G. H. Strehlow (1947:6) does assert that every feature of the landscape, prominent or otherwise, is associated with a myth, but his view is apparently not shared by other Australianists (e.g. 126.</page><page sequence="10">Erich Kolig Worsley 1967:151; R. Berndt 1970:6). Nor for that matter is he probably right when he remarks that the perfectionism of previous generations in mythologically explaining all sites has stunted the creative drive of Aborigines for centuries as there was no opening for them to fill with their own imagination. It seems to me connecting myths with sites has always been an ongoing, never-ending process since such connections presumably could slip into oblivion or vice versa, as the site disappeared freeing the associated myth to be applied elsewhere. Also the introduction and diffusion of myths 'cross-tribally' must always have provided a strong stimulus to associate them with localities in one's own territory. Myths seem to be highly selective: it is often strikingly arbitrary which land features are and which are not linked with myth. Nor indeed are the most spectacular ones always and necessarily associated with myth. One rocky outcrop may for instance be seen as the metamorphosed body of a myth being, while another one no less conspicuous in size, shape or colour may have no myth attached. Although there is a tendency to 'ex- plain' deposits of red ochre as the blood of Dreamtime beings, there are some which are not so explained and some which are not explained at all. Or perhaps one tree may be said to be a mythic being's spear stuck in the ground, while millions of other trees are ignored. This was forcefully brought home to me when two trees said to mark the camp of the Kangaroo hero Djamandi - the very spot is immortalized in a mythic song verse - were pointed out to me from a short distance. Although plainly visible I could not make them out simply because of all the other trees standing there. An identical situation occurred to me when a group of trees was shown to me, which were the souls of victims of a death- magic site nearby. This would be most peculiar if the purpose of myth were to explain the landscape. Only in a rather vague and superficial sense are all parts and pheno- mena of the land, potentially, linked with myth: usually by being declared to belong to the 'law' of a myth being that has wandered about in the area. Whole stretches of country may have a diffuse kind of mythological significance. So, for instance, may any topographical feature in a wide area be thought of being one of the Dreamtime beings swallowed and regurgi- tated by the Rainbow Serpent (R. Berndt 1970:6; Maddock 1978:106), or may be said to be the victim of malignant, man-eating spirits (R. Berndt 1970:6). In an area north-west of Noonkanbah Station all ant- hills are regarded as Dreamtime beings whom the white giant Danggaba poisoned by breaking wind. Round stones found over several square miles may be believed to be the testes of the bandicoot ancestor (R. Berndt 1970 :6f.). Usually, strikingly shaped stones - nodules, geodytes, limon- ites, petrified lava bubbles, mudstone, stone rods and the like - when found are linked with a mythic law', i.e. are referred to the nearest Dreaming track in the unspecified sense of having been 'left behind' by that mythic being. In this way anything considered worth attention can be linked with, or incorporated in, an existing myth, if necessary through an exegetical twist. If myth were to explain land it should be expected that there would be a causal stimulus for mythopoesis arising from the perception of the land and its various features. Consequently, we should find the most spectacu- lar and prominent land features to induce the strongest stimuli thus generating the more important myths. Alternatively - as R. Berndt (1970:8) suggests - the economically most significant sites should have 127</page><page sequence="11">Noah's Ark the major myths attached. No such correlation exists in my experience. In the Fitzroy River region, more often than not places held in highest religious esteem by Aborigines stand out only by their complete visual unimpressiveness, as well as their aesthetic and economic insignificance. Aborigines of my acquaintance urged me to chauffeur them on a two-day arduous pilgrimage through rough terrain so they could visit one of the most important sites in the myth of the Kangaroo hero Djamandi (who changes farther south into Malu). The site turned out to be a simple cave, one among many in the central Kimberley mountains. I realize that it is debatable which land features Aborigines may traditionally have regarded as more spectacular than others. While for a cultural outsider to ascertain this, as far as aesthetic criteria go, must remain a somewhat dubious exercise, one is on safer ground in respect of economic criteria. But here again I could find no correlation. There are, for example, impressive gorges in the Fitzroy River region, which are not only aesthetically pleasing (also to Aborigines, as I could observe), but also contain both permanent water and an ample fish supply. Surely they must have favourably impressed Aborigines; yet the most prestigious rain Dreaming centres in the area, with few exceptions, are soaks - outwardly no more than shallow depressions in the ground from which, after arduous digging, a meagre trickle of dirty water can be extracted. As said before, some physiographic features have an 'explanation' and some do not. Selection is random as well as completely arbitrary and apparently depends on chance revelation. As the Ark syndrome shows, the process of myth attachment does not appear to be guided by whether a natural feature is suggestive of the mythic shapes subsequently super- imposed on it. This speaks clearly against myth having been developed from the land feature so as to explain it. It might be claimed that Aborigines coold not interpret the Ark manifestation as such before their stock of knowledge was expanded so as to include boats. Equipped as they are in post-contact time with enhanced experience (knowledge of western technology and technical things for instance) and new conceptual tools, Aborigines might be able to detect new meaning in familiar shapes and to provide interpretations of land features that had hitherto eluded their mythopoetic efforts since they were not suggestive of anything known. But as it turns out a monolith may be a Dreamtime being, a phallus, a ship's mast or simply a stone. And a tree may come to be seen as a camp marker, a spear, a boomerang, a man's soul or just a tree. There is no outward correlation between the physical manifestation and the manifested. The process by which myth and land eventually present themselves in conjunction appears to be this. Myth is mentally, if not historically, antecedent to its attachment to land. In other words, mythopoesis occurs (in the initial stage much of it may be unconscious) before, entering full consciousness, the mind-product becomes attached to a site. Only in this way is the diffusion of standard mythemes over vast areas, possibly the entire continent, explainable. As Maddock (1976) has clearly shown, traditional mythemes have been handed on 'cross-tribally', either in unchanged or deliberately inverted form. If Aborigines were to devise myths ad-hoc stimulated by the particular givens of the land, myths would vastly differ in accordance with geographic distance, and geomorphological and ecological variations. In fact, what seems to happen is that a myth, 128</page><page sequence="12">Erich Kolig or mytheme that has arisen or become known through diffusion is suddenly through a dream vision or perhaps intuition seen manifested in a site or land feature. The process of selection of such a feature for myth attachment occurs on an unconscious level and there seem to be no regularities. In other words, myth can suddenly be seen by the believer, or dreamer, to be revealed in anything without the particular physio- graphic feature or phenomenon being even remotely suggestive, in shape, size, colour or location (a boat may be found in the desert) of the mythic shape superimposed on it. Of the numerous myth sites I have seen I recall only one whose associated mytheme showed a relatively clear correspondence of shape with the physiographic feature: a rock formation with impressively anthropomorphic features - face, nose, chin and forehead being clearly distinguishable - of which it was said to be an old (or socially mature) Dreamtime woman. However, even in this case the myth superimposition was arbitrary insofar as the rock did not have discernible sexual or age characteristics and could just as easily have been interpreted as 'a young male'. The history of the Ark myth shows that an initially individual and private revelation becomes gradually more widely accepted and incor- porated in a population's standard belief system. Much depends probably on the status and prestige of the recipient of the vision or intuition. Some revelations received by minor men, may never become commonly accepted and may soon be dropped as unconvincing. The Ark myth also demon- strates that over the years as a myth becomes embraced by ever more people, it becomes embellished. Additional mythemes are incorporated, pieces of information, actual experiences and the like are tacked on thus gradually building up a highly complex end result of accumulated sedi- mentation.7 Part of this phase - after the connection between myth and land has been established - is that the myth becomes adapted to local geographic or geomorphological peculiarities. In this constricted sense the landscape does serve as a minor source of inspiration; a kind of mythopoetic supplement. So did some Aborigines come to see tools, anchor, etc., manifested in rocks randomly strewn about on the site of the Ark - an addendum of which others are less convinced. I think two examples are in order which, in my mind, highlight the limited dialectical process between myth and land adding to an established myth. Kalyeeda Creek, Yidar, a side arm of the Fitzroy River, is associated with a Prometheus myth. At the place Balara the freshwater crocodile Goaneya had been subincised. Jerking away in pain and anguish, he jumped into a deep section of the creek, containing permanent water. As he did so he took down with him, tightly clutched in between his legs, the fire. Two small birds, Nyiman, swooping down several times, eventually succeeded in snatching the fire away from him thus retrieving it for mankind.8 Further upstream the Fitzroy River, Geikie Gorge is 7 1 do not wish to imply that this process results in increasing specification that would allow arranging myths serially (see Munz 1973 and Leach 1974). As often as myths increase in complexity and detail, they are probably dismantled and broken down into their components which in turn may serve as mythopoetic starting points. 8 In another version the retriever of fire is Wuilimirmir, or Walu-gurari (walu = fire), the chicken hawk, who rising from the water with it hits every tree and names them. Both versions closely resemble fire myths of Arabern Land, as related by Maddock (1970). 12*</page><page sequence="13">Noah's Ark associated with an almost identical myth, both being apparently only slightly differing permutations on the same theme. A crocodile, frightened by the method of circumcising with a stone blade - hitherto the opera- tion had been performed by scorchmg off the prepuce - jumped into the depth of the gorge. While Kalyeeda Creek is embedded in flat, sandy scrub country, Geikie Gorge is lined on both sides by steep, almost vertical cliffs. In one cliff face there is a roughly circular aperture: this was where the crocodile had jumped through and thus created the hole. Quite obviously, in this place the myth has been adjusted so as to incorporate an existing physiographic feature. As with the previous two myths that occur in two neighbouring language groups, there is another myth couple presenting itself as permutations of one theme among adjoining groups. There are two myths and relevant manifestations of an o!d Dreamtime woman, Banan, in the Fitzroy area. One manifestation, near Fossil Downs homestead, is a strikingly anthropo- morphic boulder which is said to be Banan sitting there exhausted at the end of her long trek from somewhere near the northern coast. The other manifestation is a round hill in the outliers of the St George Ranges and shows some additional myth details. While Banan on Fossil Downs sits rigidly upright, the other one is said to be squatting on hands and knees, her buttocks raised. This interpretation follows the hill's natural contours quite well. A tuft of whitish, sun-bleached spinifex on the hilltop represents the woman's hair; and a shallow grotto in the hill-side, in between her thighs, is her vulva. The hill's scale-like, smooth surface structure is said to be her 'corroboree-paint'. In refutation of Strehlow's claim (1947:6), it is quite appropriate to conclude with a short consideration of the eternally processual dimension of the myth-land connection. The fickleness of revelation and the apparent antics of mythically 'explaining' one place but ignoring others, find their fitting equivalent in the natural ephemerality of some myth-land connec- tions. All of them are probably subject to change sooner or later, as some may simply be forgotten or fall into oblivion for other reasons. But some are simply forced to disappear, or change, on account of the limited life- span of the particular myth-manifesting phenomenon: for example, trees (see e.g. Mountford 1978:48, 127; Strehlow 1947:25). Again an example is in order. On the lease area of Noonkanbah, north of the Fitzroy River, two Dreamtime beings met and fought: one a ghostly white giant, Danggaba, the other a black, hairy, 'gorilla-like' colossus, Marala-Marala. Their titanic fight is manifested by two features on one particular site. A sand dune that appears to extend in a straight line for several kilometres, is broken at this place because, as the myth has it, the two giants locked in battle had violently kicked about scattering the sand and levelling the dune. However, this place is by no means extra- ordinary, as there are several similar-looking sites in the vicinity. In fact, my guide mistakenly led me to the wrong place at first, noticing his error only when he could not find what he remembered as the second feature. This, the other memento of the fight, is a crippled baobab tree whose trunk appears to creep along the ground with only a very few branches sticking out vertically. It is believed to be the body of the fallen giant Danggaba, although somewhat incongruously it is believed that afterwards he had picked himself up again and returned to his point of origin. Two ram-rod straight branches of the tree are said to be the spears which felled him 130</page><page sequence="14">Erich Kolig and now protrude from his body. The site is rather unspectacular as broken sand dunes and crooked boabab trees abound in the area. Now, baobab trees have an amazing life-span, but sooner or later the manifesta- tion of Danggaba's body will have disappeared. And what then? Ignoring the likelihood that future Aboriginal generations will simply not bother, the theme will probably be transferred to another site, as may have happened several times before. Somebody will, in a flash of intuition, see the fight revealed in another feature of the landscape - a bent tree, a soak, a rock configuration, a cleavage in a hill, for these things often mark the fateful climax of Dreamtime events.
