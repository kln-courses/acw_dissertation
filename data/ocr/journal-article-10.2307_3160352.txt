<plain_text><page sequence="1">EVOLUTION OF MORMON DOCTRINE GEORGE B. ARBAUGH Carthage College, Carthage, Illinois The intricacies of Mormon polytheism are a perpetual sur- prise to the student of American thought. But a second sur- prise awaits the historian who attempts to trace the roots of this American polytheism. It is that Mormon doctrine moved not from ordinary Trinitarian thought but from an original position in which extreme monistic tendencies were dominant. There are three stages in this transition: an original monism, a reversal to tritheism, and the expansion of this into polytheism. I As I have elsewhere set forth at length, the most probable origin of the Book of Mormon was twofold: first the borrowing of an Indian novel written by Solomon Spaulding, a Congrega- tional minister, and second the revision of this so as to incorpor- ate the theology of the Disciples of Christ, this revision being made by Sidney Rigdon who left the Disciples to become the great theologian of early Mormonism.' The problem of the Trinity was much discussed in that age when Unitarianism had become well formulated and mili- tant. Spaulding seems to have accepted this anti-trinitarian tendency. In the Manuscript Story, an earlier novel which he began but never completed, he repudiates "traditionary and vulgar prejudice" in Christianity, and appears Unitarian rather than atheistic. Jesus is not mentioned in the appraisal of "the Christian religion" which is printed at the end of the Manuscript Story (Lamoni, Iowa, ed.). Reason is regarded as an unerring and sure guide. The Bible is "a mere human production designed to inrich and agrandize its authors &amp; to enable them to manage the multitude." God is referred to as the Almighty, and in the Manuscript Story itself God is spoken of as the un- revealed Almighty, omnipotent Being, or great and good Being. Spaulding did not wish to dissipate the "happy delusion" 1 Cf. Part I of my Revelation in Mormonism (Chicago, 1932). Chapter II is par- ticularly pertinent. 157</page><page sequence="2">CHURCH HISTORY of the masses, yet his views seem to have crept into his second manuscript, the Manuscript Found, of which the Book of Mor- mon appears to be a revision. Here Jesus could not be ignored, being one of the primary actors, but Unitarian re-interpretation of his nature is given. Christ and the Father are not two per- sons. Christ is instead a manifestation of the Father. "Christ was the God, the Father of all things," we read in Mosiah, 7:27. Further, the writer could not refrain from giving his theological explanation of this. Obviously he had argued this with his friends before! "And because he dwelleth in flesh he shall be called the Son of God, and having subjected the flesh to the will of the Father, being the Father and the Son-the Father, be- cause he was conceived by the power of God; and the Son, be- cause of the flesh; thus becoming the Father and the Son."2 This is difficult to interpret, though in the history of doctrine it recalls Patripassianism and modalistic Monarchianism. But whatever its form, the Unitarian character of the thought is un- mistakable. God's theological unity having thus been argument- atively established, the Lord is made to later announce himself in similar fashion: "Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son."3 The views of Spaulding must have had much natural appeal for the Mormon theologian Rigdon when he set himself at the task of revision of the manuscript. The Disciples of Christ-wvhom Rigdon left through jealousy-had been in- fluenced by Unitarianism. Although they did not object to the conception of God as three-fold personality, yet they re- jected the term "Trinity." Alexander Campbell who never used the word even though being a Trinitarian said, "I have not spent, perhaps an hour in ten years in thinking about the Trinity ... I think nothing about it, save that it is not a Scriptural term and consequently can have no Scriptural idea attached to it. But I discover that the Trinitarians, Unitarians and the simple Arians are always in the field upon this subject and that the more they contend, the less they know about it."' With this background and his own revolutionary tendencies, Rigdon was apparently receptive to Spaulding's ideas, and early Mor- mon theology shows interesting traces of its influence. In one 2 Mosiah 15:2-3. 3 Ether 3:14. 4 Peter Ainslie, The Message of the Disciples for the Union of the Church (3rd ed., New York, 1913), 110 f. 158</page><page sequence="3">EVOLUTION OF MORMON DOCTRINE of the early Mormon oracles,5 we find a direct influence from the Book of Mormon argument (Mosiah 15:2-3). Christ rea- sons that he is the "Father because he gave me of his fulness, and the Son because I was in the world and made flesh my taber- nacle." Even certain portions of the Book of Mormon which seem to have been inserted by Rigdon (or perhaps Rigdon and Joseph Smith jointly) appear to have been influenced by Spaul- ding's thought for they strongly emphasize the oneness of the Father, Son, and Spirit.6 Some Mormons of a later day have tried to argue that these passages do not mean that Jesus and the Father were the same person but only that God gave Jesus his own name of "Father," because Jesus possessed God's fulness of glory.7 But this is incorrect for as late as 1832 or 1833, while revising the New Testament, Rigdon and Smith gave Luke 10:22 a clearly Unitarian meaning: "and no man knoweth that the Son is the Father, and the Father is the Son, but him to whom the Son will reveal it."8 II Unitarianism was soon abandoned by official Mormonism, yet it left important traces. Long afterward Saints who knew their scriptures too well caused trouble by reverting to this discarded view, arguing "that Jesus Christ is God, and the only God, and the only Eternal Father."9 Certain apostles of the Hedrickite faction lost their high offices in 1933 for insist- ing that Father, Son, and Spirit are only "attributes" of the Eternal Father.1? But the main development was a replacement of Patripassian views by tritheism. For this change Mor- monism was predisposed by its inheritance of the theology of the Disciples which was not only not clearly Trinitarian but which also developed in the direction of tritheism. Following John Locke's insistence on simple sensory ideas, Alexander Campbell believed that the only way God could have revealed himself was by speaking the words of the Bible. Mormonism took over this insistent anthropomorphism, and already in the 5 Doctrine and Covenants (Utah ed.), 93:4.

Take away his body and parts and what is left? "Nothing, just nothing; why does he need a Heaven to dwell in? He could dwell nowhere," answers a Mormon writer."2 Mormons found a strong devotional appeal in this. "If we believe in an abstract God... then we cannot form a mental picture of him when we pray."'3 The Disciples of Christ left Jesus, as the "Son of God," quite distinct from the Father, and when the Mormons followed in the insistence on God's spatial-bodily reality they tended to distinguish between Christ and the Father as two different bodily Beings. The diverse manifestations of God ap- peared more obvious than his oneness. If Christ is his body and yet is on earth while the Father is in heaven then there must be two gods. It was an easy step to add that the Holy Spirit-which was thought of more or less as energy-is a third god. The fol- lowing bold assertion by bold prophet Joseph Smith will illus- trate the end-product of the tendency: "Many men say there is one God; the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are only one God! I say that is a strange God anyhow. . . All are to be crammed into one God, according to sectarianism.""4 The Mormons grant that there is a oneness among Father, Son, and Spirit which makes it possible to speak of them as a trinity, but this is not a oneness of being, still less of person, but is rather a oneness of mind, of wisdom and will. It is such oneness as that of husband and wife,15 or between Jesus and his disciples.'6 There had, of course, been such thoughts as these before in the history of Christianity, but it was just at this point that Mormonism showed its uniqueness and daring. One God may be left an Absolute, a unique Being, but if there are three man-like gods, why not more than three? III Up to this stage of development we still do not have gen- uine polytheism. The Trinity had not yet become three gods but rather a Triad, and the individuality of each awaits poly- 11 Ether 3:8. On Campbell, cf.

This was to be made possible by the complete identification of gods and men in a single race. At about the time the Book of Mormon was first being printed and the new religion established, we find Rigdon and Smith making an extremely sharp distinction between the hu- man and divine. While writing the Book of Moses, they "cor- rected" Genesis 6:1-2. Instead of allowing the "sons of God" to marry women, they changed it to read "son of men," and these "sons of men" were identified as followers of Cain, i.e. as members of the Masonic lodge. Apart from this being histor- ically incorrect,'? the revision bears internal evidence of not being the true text, for while it denies that these polluting per- sons were "sons of God" it inconsistently explains the signifi- cance of the term which it had removed: "And Noah and his sons . . . were called the sons of God."18 This change is very instructive. The lack of a sharp distinction between the human and the supernatural was so displeasing to the creators of Mor- monism, at the time of its origin, that they not only corrected it but even pointed out that these "sons of God" were not really sons of God but merely good men who hearkened unto the Lord and were therefore called "sons of God." Two or three years later, when "translating" the New Testament, Rigdon and Smith were still very much opposed to a confusion of divine and human, for they made Luke 3:38 def- initely creationistic. Instead of "Adam, which was the son of God," the Mormon version reads: "Adam, who was formed of God." But the wall of separation between human and divine was crumbling. Speculation about various heavens and various degrees of heaven had developed, and conflict between incon- sistent views led to a sudden reversal of the entire previous outlook. On February 16, 1832, Smith (and Rigdon) received a "vision" which revealed the existence of three heavens, and most significantly the following appeared as a statement of the glory of those who go to the highest heaven: "Wherefore, as it is written, they are gods, even the sons of God."'1 It is un- 17 This is related to a Persian myth which has demons thus allying themselves with women before the coming of Zoroaster, and in Enoch the idea from Gen. 6:1-2 is dramatized in an intricate angelology.

The irony of His an- 161</page><page sequence="6">CHURCH HISTORY certain whether this was meant to say as much as it seems to say, but at least it definitely indicates that speculation about the man-God theory was well under way. The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which rejects polytheism, has had great difficulty in interpreting this. A. B. Phillips writes: "So far as I know, the Reorganized Church has never placed any official interpretation upon this passage. The church has never expressed a belief in a plurality of gods, and I have never known of an instance where any of its repre- sentatives have done so ... Very little comment has been made by our representative ministry on the quotation you refer to. Such as I have known appears to crystallize in the thought that its intent is to emphasize the fact that, by adoption through the gospel plan, believers may become heirs of God as his child- ren."20 It is noteworthy that this faction has not rejected polytheism but merely has not accepted it, even though recog- nizing that their prophet taught it." Moreover, their attitude is in opposition to a clear apotheosic tendency in Doctrine and Covenants 76:58, referred to above. To make polytheism complete, anthropomorphism had to be carried to its extreme conclusion. If men can develop into gods then also gods must once have been men, and the life of the gods must be determined by the same basic principles opera- tive in human nature. This meant, primarily, the displacement of the divine attributes of eternity and absoluteness by those of procreation and development. And at the heart of the new theory we find the principle of sex. The sonship of Christ was interpreted in this way, and sex was then elaborated into a uni- versal explanatory principle. Once Smith preached: "Where was there ever a son without a father? And where was there ever a father without first being a son? . . . Hence if Jesus had a Father, can we not believe that He had a Father also?"22 swer is brought out by Plummer's comment in The Cambridge Bible: In your law (Ps. 82:6) "men on whom God's word has conferred a fragment of dele- gated authority may be called 'gods' (Elohim) without scruple; He, Whom tho Father Himself sanctified and sent, may not be called Son of God without blas- phemy!" There is certainly no hint of polytheism in this; nevertheless as the International Critical Commentary suggests: "The doctrine of the Incarnation has its roots, not in bare Deism, but in that view of God which regards Him as entering into human life and consecrating human activities to His own purposes.'' (Comment on John 10:34). 20 Letter addressed to the author, dated March 28, 1930. 21 Revelation in Mormonism, 105, for their inconsistent attitude toward the poly- theistic Book of Abraham. 22 Parry, Smith's teachings, 58-9. 162</page><page sequence="7">EVOLUTION OF MORMON DOCTRINE About 1841 Smith, who had assumed more positive leader- ship of the church, found strong substantiation for polytheism in the discovery that Elohim (Hebrew for God) is plural, and he made good practical use of this knowledge in his revision of the opening of Genesis in the Book of Abraham. His way of proving polytheism was vigorous and dramatic, if not convinc- ing. Once he preached as follows on the basis of I Corinthians 8:6, "Paul, if Joseph Smith is a blasphemer, you are, I say there are Gods many and Lords many, but to us only one, and we are to be in subjection to that one . .. Some say I do not in- terpret the scripture the same as they do. They say it means the heathen's gods. (Actually this is correct. G. B. A.) ... You know and I testify that Paul had no allusion to the heathen gods. I have it from God, and get over it if you can ... I will show from the Hebrew Bible that I am correct, and the first word shows a plurality of Gods (Genesis 1:1). An unlearned boy must give you a little Hebrew."23 Theoretically, procreation of gods necessitated goddesses. "Sex," says one of the great Mormon theologians, "which is indispensable on this earth for the perpetuation of the human race, is an eternal quality which has its equivalent everywhere. Since we have a Father, who is our God, we must also have a mother, who possesses the attributes of Godhead. This simply carries onward the logic of things earthly, and conforms with the doctrine that whatever is on this earth is simply a represen- tation of great spiritual conditions, of deeper meaning than we can here fathom."'2 A famous Mormon hymn, written by Eliza R. Snow, shows the religious vitality of the doctrine. I had learned to call thee, Father, By thy spirit from on high; But, until the key of knowledge Was restored, I knew not why; In the heavens are parents single? No, the thought makes reason stare. Truth is reason; truth eternal Tells me, I've a mother there. Nevertheless Mormon goddesses are products of logic rather than objects of worship. This stands in sharp contrast to what might be termed the practical polytheism of Roman Catholicism, where the Blessed Virgin and the saints, similar 23 Ibid., 55 f. 24 J. A. Widtsoe, Rational Theology (Salt Lake City, Utah, 1926), 64-65. 163</page><page sequence="8">CHURCH HISTORY to pagan functional deities, serve real devotional needs even though not being regarded as divine.25 The great Mormon deities are all male and the goddesses are of little significance apart from their procreational function. Procreation involves growth, and this developmental view completed the identification of the races of men and gods. The destiny of men and the origins of the gods are thus given. "God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens."26 All men and gods (their souls, that is) are bodies of spirit, consisting of the same parts, having the same functions and of the same size as earthly bodies, only of a more refined matter. For their more rapid advancement in the eternal progression, the spirits born to gods are sent to some earth by their parents, placed in bodies of crude matter, and when they acquire insight into the laws of nature (by which gods themselves are governed), they pass on into unending growth. IV The intriguing intricacies of this anthropomorphic poly- theism are beyond the scope of this paper,27 but there is one further step in the movement from unitarianism to polytheism. It is the attempt to find a satisfactory unity among the gods, the inevitable problem of any polytheism. But since such at- tempts are sporadic and not very significant, this can scarcely be added as a fourth step in the transition to the previous stages of monism, tritheism, and polytheism. In indicating the nature of the search for unity we may best begin by summarizing the fundamental changes in view- point, revealed by contrasting them with a few commonly con- ceived "attributes" of deity. Unity .-...............-.... Plurality Eternity ................... Procreativity Absoluteness ...-.... Finiteness Creativeness -..------- Scientific Control Spirituality ......--... Materiality (bodily function) 25 Consider this prayer: "Jesus, Mary and Joseph, I give you my heart, and my soul! Jesus, Mary and Joseph, assist me in my last agony!

Roberts, Mormon Doctrine, 10. 27 The only extended treatment of the doctrine as it was employed in the various factions apears in my Revelation in Mormonism, and unfortunately this is pre- sented historically rather than systematically. 164</page><page sequence="9">EVOLUTION OF MORMON DOCTRINE These attributes lead to a succession of major problems which have concerned Mormon thinkers, and which-paralleling the attributes-may be listed thus: 1. Relation of gods to one an- other; 2. Advancement of the gods; 3. Relation to nature: orig- inal; 4. Relation to nature: future; 5. Functional life and its values. 1. Not all of these problems have received equal attention among the various Mormon churches. Thus the problem of the relation of the gods to one another was extensively treated only by Joseph Morris, prophet of a minor faction. He re- vealed that there are 144,000 gods in a quorum, and that they are ruled over by a president, his two counselors, and twelve apostles. A new god entering the quorum from a lower quorum forces out the president at the top, so that there is an endless change in the make-up of quorums and governments. This view, though even it leaves countless questions unanswered, is far more specific than the teachings of other polytheistic Mor- mons. Yet it is not different from them in fundamentals. For the others too, there is endless progression, priestly rule, and patriarchal order among the gods. Life among the gods is qualitatively like that in the Mormon church, but there is more perfect wisdom and better obedience to law. 2. The problem of the relation of the gods among thenl- selves thus becomes the problem of the advancement of the gods. Joseph Smith indicated that the careers of gods are repetitious rather than unique. For example, Jesus' Father likewise died on a cross. Each world has its functional deities. Further, Smith indicated that there are three estates: spiritual (from birth to incarnation on earth), embodied life, and celestial life (with retention of body) in one of three heavens. This system of estates is a Great Plan which the gods devised in order that their children might progress more rapidly toward godhood. And under this great plan, as among the original gods, progress is not uniform. Indeed many spirits fail to become gods, fall- ing in one of the lower heavens. Only those in the third heaven, and the third degree of glory of it, become gods and are allowed to procreate. This simple but incomplete theory was little added upon except by Joseph Morris, who indicated that there are ten estates of a spirit instead of three. Advancement of any spirit is conditioned by two factors, its obedience (to its parents-gods) and its wise control of nature. This leads to our third problem, 165</page><page sequence="10">CHURCH HISTORY the origin of spirit, for if the gods themselves progress by learn- ing to understand and control nature then the laws they give to their children must be natural wisdom rather than divine de- crees. 3. To understand the nature of the divine, one must un- derstand all of nature, for deity is a part of nature. The prob- lem of the original relation of spirit to nature was discussed freely if not extensively by Joseph Smith. Even in the Book of Mormon God appeared as a Being of flesh and bone, and Smith concluded: "There is no such thing as immaterial matter. All spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure, and can only be discerned by purer eyes; we cannot see it; but when our bodies are purified we shall see that it is all matter."28 It seems certain that Smith vaguely conceived of spirit as an offshoot of an original inert physical nature, but the Mormon philosophers prefer not to theorize extensively on the relation between these two kinds of matter, and when asked where the first gods came from the Mormon is likely to answer that, diffi- cult as it may seem, there weren't any first gods; the first gods had parents too. And as proof they cite the problem of priority of hen and egg! This means that though all gods are finite that the race of gods is infinite. It has even been suggested as not unlikely that in some way this spiritual matter was the original Reality, "that from it are derived all other forms of matter."29 There is in this something akin to Bergson, not only in the doc- trine of creative evolution in which spirit by its upward reach gives birth to matter, but also in the driving force in the evolu- tionary process-that the very cause of the eternal drama of education of spirit is the independent compelling influence of the will of every spiritual being. Mormons have not been receptive to evolutionary theory, con- trary to what one might have expected. It is insisted that "apes and humans evolved separately." "The first ancestors of pres- ent day humans were themselves human beings."30 One reason for the objection to biological evolutionism is that the Mormon conception of the history of salvation (designed as a "Great 28 Doctrine and Covenants 131:7-8. At another time he said spirit is "more pure elastic and refined matter than the body." Parry, op. cit., p. 164. Unofficial revelation states that God's body is not of flesh' as we know it, but of "power and glory" and is transparent and perfect in appearance. Saints' Herald, Nov. 6, 1912 (reprinted in A. Knislcy, Revelations in Our Times (Independence, Mo., 1913), 49. 29 Widtsoe, Rational Theology, 29. 30 Snyder, Important Teachings, Chapter XI. 166</page><page sequence="11">EVOLUTION OF MORMON DOCTRINE Plan") specifically states that the gods gave men bodies just like their own. Gods themselves evolve but men cannot! It is a strange thing to see Mormons denouncing the evolution of man as ignoble and yet believing in the evolution of the gods. While Mormonism thus sought to make spirit the basic and causal factor in universal evolution, yet this primordial spirit is not self-conscious and self-determinative, for the first gods rose from an original lowly, inert state by learning the laws of the universe and conforming to them. The progress of a god began with the exertion of his will in an endless struggle for knowledge and power. This will is not, however, in oppo- sition to an opposing Nature, for it believed that the forces of the universe-heat, light, electricity, magnetism-are not blind, but are the expressions of universal intelligence; that energy is nothing more than intelligence. And, since growth in intelli- gence is conforming to the intelligent laws of the universe, no god is or ever could be omnipotent, and probably could never be omniscient. The first or head god, through his head start over other spirits (due perhaps to a more active will), has attained a degree of intelligence and might which exceeds the combined intelligence and power of all other beings. While it is regarded as unlikely that two or more gods have made exactly the same progress, yet it is thought possible that many gods have ap- proximately the same state. 4. The future relation of the gods to nature interests the practical-minded Mormon more than the mysteries of origins. The evolution of spirit is active, positive, becoming ever more a self-conscious and wise process. As in the cosmic processes of the philosophies of India, spiritual laws are at work, but in Hinduism spirit is caught in the tragic chain of sequence; in Mormonism law is a helping factor in the divine process. With Heracleitus, the Mormons believe that inactivity spells non-ex- istence. "Quiescence in the universe can not be conceived, for then there would be no universe."3 The inter-working of mat- ter, energy, and intelligences is ordered by a great law of har- mony in an eternal upward-striving movement. Joseph Smith revealed that men take with them to their future estates the degree of intelligence attained in this world.32 This has been transformed into a philosophy of acquisition of usable science, 31 Widtsoe, Rational Theology, 19. 32 Doctrine and Covenants, 130:19. 167</page><page sequence="12">CHURCH HISTORY mastery of the laws of nature. Intelligence is the means by which the spirits advance in power and divinity. Orson Pratt has suggested some of the features of such advancement: "God, though in the figure of a man, has many powers that man has not got. He can go upwards through the air. He can waft himself from world to world . . .8 One interesting problem, seldom considered, is that of liv- ing room. If the gods increase by endless multiplication one might think they would run out of worlds to conquer (and mat- ter). The problem becomes more acute with the realization that gods subsist on celestial foods and thus gradually (through procreation) transform the crude material of the universe into spiritual matter. The only suggestion on this is from Joseph Morris who indicates that worlds themselves grow and pass through the same estates as do spirits. Spirits live in an ex- panding, growing universe. 5. Finally, the attribute of materiality raises many pro- blems relating to functional life and its value. The Mormon ethic has unquestioning faith in knowledge, a Socratic faith that right conduct will proceed from right understanding. This is partly an outgrowth of Alexander Campbell's repudiation of original sin, and his argument that man is quite capable of be- lieving in God when God has sufficiently convinced him (faith being thus a rational acceptance of evidence). Life is thus at every step rational, reasonable; it is the accepting of the order of nature. Social morality likewise roots in rationality. It grows naturally out of one's self-interest. "A lone God in the universe cannot find great joy in his power. The Lord, being in harmony with eternal laws, can progress best as the whole universe be- comes more complex, or advances ... In that sense, the man who progresses through his increase in knowledge and power be- comes a co-laborer with God, and may be said, indeed, to be a help to God."84 Mormonism knows no absolute values. The good is the realization of functional achievement, in a universe where even gods must have vegetables and telescopes. Divine life is life in nature. And while this divine life is ever multiplying itself by individuation or procreation, yet its unity is insured by the 33 Cf. I. W. Riley, The Founder of Mormonism (New York, 1902), 407 ff. 34 Widtsoe, Rational Theology, 26. 168</page><page sequence="13">EVOLUTION OF MORMON DOCTRINE rationality of Nature itself. Reasonable gods will not be so fool- ish as to break themselves on the sensible laws of an intelligible universe! Mormons grant that this ideal unity is at times broken. There have been disagreements among spirits, and there has been a "war in heaven." Yet, significantly, Satan's rebellion is inter- preted not so much from a moral standpoint as being a difference in understanding or wisdom. Lucifer proposed to save men without any volition on their part, by filling them with knowl- edge of this earth, whereas Jesus insisted that men must retain their free will. Wrong judgment has thus led to retrogression, to the development of devils-very few in number-who per- haps are made more susceptible to error by each mistake in judgment. V This is the end of the story, not the logical end but the his- torical one. We began with strict Unitarianism, a monism which completely identified the persons of the Trinity with one an- other. Then with the extension of the fundamental anthropo- morphism which had been inherited from Alexander Campbell, the persons of the Trinity were separated once more, in time so sharply as to result in tritheism. Then tritheism was extended into a sweeping polytheism, by identification of the races of men and gods. But the final chapter, which Nathan S6derblom re- garded as inevitable for any polytheism or nature religion,35 was never completed. This is an attempt by means perhaps of pantheism to recover unity among the many divine beings. The beginnings of pantheism are certainly present, in a close kin- ship of spirit and matter, a divine life which is in nature, and more fundamentally still in the thought that the nature of the divine life is based on- the intelligence or rationality of Nature and her laws. But this fourth stage was never completed, be- cause the process of Mormon revelation was cut short before it was completed. And it will probably never be completed now. for the speculative and revelatory tendencies in Mormonism have largely given way to crystallized dogma.36 35 Cf. N. Soderblom, The Nature of Bevelation (New York, 1933), 20. 36 For sources regarding doctrinal development, where not cited, consult my Reve- lation in Mormonism. 169</page></plain_text>
