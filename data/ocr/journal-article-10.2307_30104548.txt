I), about 8 kms. directly south of Naxos town, at the northern edge of the fertile coastal plain of Polichni (PLATE I3c). The hill (PLATE I3b), on the southern slopes of which is the core of the site described here, is at the landward end of the promontory which then flattens out as it projects into the sea. The hill is steep and very rocky, with a high (nearly 6o m. above sea level) and prominent summit, though a series of terraces on the south side make it considerably more convenient for occupation than seems at first sight to be the case. This text is an account of the results of a surface survey of Mikre Vigla. Although a good deal of archaeological investigation has taken place in the area,2 this site has barely been noticed,3 in spite of the fact that copious sherd material can be seen on the surface. Pottery collected by Professor C. Doumas from Mikre Vigla4 and fragments of figurines which seem likely5 to be from the site have been in the Naxos Museum for several years. There are also representative items in the sherd collection of the British School at Athens.6 Most of the information about Mikre Vigla and the immediately surrounding area relates to the Bronze Age but there is also some evidence7 for activity in later antiquity, which is reflected, if only in a modest way, in our finds from the site. Apart from the promising character of the surface material and the unique (for the Cyclades) presence of substantial numbers of figurines, there were other good reasons for embarking on an investigation of Mikre Vigla. Naxos is the largest and most fertile of the Cycladic islands and was important throughout prehistoric times and in later antiquity. Relatively little however is known about the island in the Middle and Later Bronze Age (roughly the second millennium B.C.), apart from the LC III finds from Grotta and Aplomata8 and important new early LC material recently excavated by one of the present writers.9 Prime objectives of the investigation of Mikre Vigla were to establish the nature and chronology of the occupation of the site, to investigate its links with other Cycladic islands and other areas of the Aegean and to clarify and extend our view of the Middle and Late Bronze Age on Naxos as a whole. 1 See Appendix I for a full discussion of the geomor- phology of the site and surrounding area. 2 Fotou 17 (map), 47, 55 (references); and see n. 10. 3ADelt 20 (1965) 506, n. 4; BSA 69 (0974) 50. 4 See above, Acknowledgements. 5 See above, n. 4 and Technical Abbreviations. 6 See below, catalogues of pottery and other finds. 7 e.g. Archaic inscription in Naxos Museum. 8 Fotou 46, 49-53; BSA 76 (1981) 9, 12, 13, I8; also 4, 7 (LCI-II). 9 See Hadjianastasiou, this volume.</page><page sequence="2">NAXOS pollona- 0 0 O C&gt; O 3 SAplomata CD7 Grotta- , O 903 Moutsouna a 300 -~ ~" 0ny \poO.

A preliminary survey to define the main concentrations of material immediately showed that they were restricted to the S slopes, the summit and the area below and immediately to the N of the summit. Beyond the areas indicated on the plan (FIG. 2), there were very few signs of any finds, though it is possible that this may be partly due to the extension of sand - cover since antiquity. Although terraced, the slope of the hill, especially on the S, is steep and eroded and it is unlikely that much of the material is in its original position. Exceptions to this are presumably the finds from the summit plateau and perhaps from Area 16 (including Structure 7), which is relatively flat and has no terraces to the N from which objects could easily have fallen. The flat, westward extension of the promontory was not included in the survey proper, though it was briefly investigated. A limited amount of material (a few sherds and pieces of obsidian) were seen. Unless subsequent geomorphological changes have obscured the evidence, it does not seem that this part of the area was intensively occupied, although some EC pottery and obsidian was recovered in a previous survey.1' COLLECTION AREAS (FIG. 2) These were distinguished on the basis of natural features - rock outcrops, terrace edges etc.: Areas i-3: arbitrary subdivisions (W - E) of the relatively flat plateau on the summit of the hill. Area 4: below the summit on the N side of the hill, i.e. between the bottom of the zig-zag path (S), Structure 2 (N) and the top of the ramp (W). Areas 5-7 E - W: low, immediately above the sea, on the S side of the hill. The area divisions are arbitrary and much of the material was lying on the rocks and clearly out of context. Area 8: above (N) 5-7 and below (S) the terrace wall - Structure 6/Area 9. Area 9: immediately on top of the terrace wall (Structure 6). Areas 10-12 (E - W): terrace above Areas 5-9. Large boulder outcrops but also substantial flat areas, especially to the W. Area 13: immediately above Areas I O-iI, bounded on the N by the steep rocks which drop sharply from the highest point of the site and, to the W, by an extension of these. Some terrace walls are visible to the W and, at the E, a line of large boulders which may be either natural or a substantial wall. A massive stone has been hollowed into a water trough. Area 14: to the W of Area 13, beyond the rocky extension, and N of Areas 10-12. Area 15: above Area 14 and below the summit plateau. Area 16: E of Area io and divided from it by a sharp rise in the bedrock. A large and relatively flat terrace, clearly defined on the W, both by the drop and by a prominent line of rock outcrop. This, adapted at the SW by an artificial addition, seems to have been used 'o See Appendix I; R.

Below and to the SE of Structure 7, there was probably a pathway to the sea, although the lower part is rocky and there is no easy access to the water. STRUCTURES (FIGS. 2-4; PLATES 14-15) The following are the main structural remains identified in the course of our study. In addition to the features described there is scattered evidence of walling at many other points on the site, mainly the southern slopes. Most of these unlisted structures are built of small stones, like the retaining wall of the pathway (PLATE I4d), and seem to be terrace walls. Their date must remain uncertain, though we should, as always, bear in mind the predominantly prehistoric character of the pottery from the site. Some of these walls may, of course, have belonged to houses and some may have had a dual function. The building material is always local, but there is an enormous variation in the size of the elements used. Many of the stones are small and could have been easily gathered or split off from the rocky outcrops and then positioned. Some, however, are much larger boulders (e.g. PLATE I5d) and their orderly arrangement proves that, even if not actually quarried, they have been moved from their original locations. Because of the rocky nature of the site, patches of outcrop are often used to form the sides of structures (PLATE 14b). Structure i (FIGS. 2, 3; PLATE 14a) On the very summit of the hill, in Area I, is a large heap of stones, clearly the remains of the superstructure of a rectangular building, whose foundations can partly be made out below the tumble. The lower courses include some very large blocks, especially at the S end of the W front (PLATE I4a). The S side is made of smaller stones. The arrangement of the foundations at the E end shows that Structure I had a predecessor, on a somewhat different alignment (see FIG. 3). The later building measures c. 5.40 x 3-90m. Its date cannot be conclusively demonstrated and it is not necessarily prehistoric, though the lack of any material of later date in the immediate vicinity must make such a date highly Ss2 s3 s4- "path S AC ~`.e3mw FIG. 3.

About 2m to the south of Structure I are the remains of a short length of retaining wall of small stones (not planned). Some of the figurines, at least, must have been associated with the small plateau where Structure I stands, since they were found there and are unlikely to have moved up the slope in the course of time! Although the majority were found on lower parts of the site, it is possible, but by no means certain, that they too were originally associated with this building. Likewise, the discovery of a fair number of post-prehistoric sherds on the summit" suggests that this part of the site continued to be a focus of interest, after the settlement had been abandoned. Our sole fragment of bronze (undated) and a piece of painted plaster from just below the plateau, on the S, might also have been associated with this building. Pathway (FIGS. 2, 3; PLATE I4d) On the N side of the hill (i.e. to the S of Area 4) are zig-zag sections of a retaining wall of small stones which supported a narrow pathway to the summit. Structure 2 (FIGS. 2, 3; PLATE I4b) On the N side of Area 4, a combination of natural outcrops and artificial additions represents the remains of a building of c. 5.00 x 5.80m. The back (N) wall is formed of outcropping rocks, the front (S) and one side (W) are mainly composed of massive stones. Smaller blocks form the E end of the S wall and the E wall, though the latter is not well preserved. There seem to be traces of internal divisions. Structures 3 and 4 (FIGS. 2, 3; PLATE 14C) Area 4 and the zig-zag path to the summit are approached from the W by a long (c. 16. 70m) 'ramp' lined with massive blocks. At first sight, the lines of this 'structure' seemed too regular to be coincidental, but its exceptionally massive character, together with the artificial-seeming lines of natural formations elsewhere on the site make its true character problematic. It is quite possible, of course, that what was essentially a natural feature was utilised, modified or unmodified, as an approach passage to the site. Just below Structure 2, the 'ramp' is blocked by large stones (Structure 4; FIGS. 2, 3), perhaps fallen from the sides or part of a stairway which would have been required at this point to negotiate the ascent. If our identification of a semi-artificial ramp is incorrect, these stones may simply be the remains of an terrace, supporting the ground in front of Structure 2. Structure 5 (FIGS. 2, 4; PLATE 15a) At the S edge of Areas 5/6, this structure has a substantial N wall of large stones, which retains the hillside above, as well as forming the N wall of the Structure. Part of the E wall (of small stones) is visible, though the S has fallen away. The E wall appears to continue " See Catalogue.</page><page sequence="7">MIKRE VIGLA: A BRONZE AGE SETTLEMENT ON NAXOS 69 ii FIG. 4. MIKRE VIGLA. Plan of part of site, with Structures 5, 6 and 7. some distance down the slope and may have been a party wall shared by several buildings. Some large stones at the W probably formed part of the W wall which is otherwise of the same character as the E. Structure 6 FIGS. 2, 4; PLATE I5b) At the top (N) of Area 8, and supporting the S edge of Area Io is a massive retaining wall, of large stones. (The area on top of this wall was designated Area 9 for collection purposes). In the same way as Structure 5, this wall seems to have formed part of a unit (or units), with walls of smaller stones running S to c. 2.IOm at the E and 3.20m on the W side. These walls also seem to have further connections.</page><page sequence="8">70 R.L.N. BARBER and 0. HADJIANASTASIOU Structure 7 (FIGS. 2, 4; PLATES I5C) This lies in Area 16, the largest reasonably flat space on the site, and is the most impressive construction. Its importance is emphasised by the discovery of fragments of painted wall plaster and of fine Cycladic White pottery, also by the remains of what may be a monumental doorway. The W side of the Area, and of Structure 7 itself, is defined by a line of rock outcrop, which drops sharply to Area Io on the W. This line was also used as the W wall of the structure, adapted in places (especially at the SW corner) by the addition of sections of built wall of small stones. The S wall consists of large stones; the N incorporates both large and small; the E is of mixed character. Although the structure seems certainly a unit (c. 19. oo (varies) X c. 8.oom), its plan can be readily seen as two halves, with a possible extension to the N. The W half appears to be a single room (c. Io.oo (varies) X c. 8.oo), though there seem to be traces of some internal walling at the S. It has two large, squarish and apparently worked blocks at the NE, possibly defining a doorway. The E half, divided from the W by a party wall, lies on much more steeply sloping ground - the reason for its eroded nature. It consists of two rectangular (N - S) compartments (each c. 2.00 x 8.oom, the W slightly larger), whose function can only be surmised. They may simply have supported a floor above, they may have been rooms at a lower level, or they may have supported a stairway leading up to the main terrace area. Immediately below the rectangular compartments, a narrow path leads down to the rocks immediately above the sea and may have given access to some kind of landing stage (see also Structure 8). 5.oom to the N of the structure, as here defined, is another W - E wall, of both large and small stones, which may be a terrace wall (although the slope is not particularly steep) or part of another building - or conceivably part of Structure 7, though no architectural connection with the latter is immediately apparent. A short distance beyond the E boundary of Area 16, and E of Structure 7, a small section of a room was excavated in a rescue operation by the Archaeological Service. The walls were of small stones and contained, amongst other pottery, fragments of a pithos of late MC date.12 Structure 8 (FIGS. 2, 4; PLATE I5d) About 35.oom SE of Area 16, just above the sea and near the end of the path referred to under Structure 7, a wall of massive stones runs N - S for c. 6.oom. It may have retained a small terrace above the sea or possibly have something to do with the landing. THE POTTERY Notes I. Seventy seven bags of pottery were collected during the course of the fieldwork. The catalogue represents a selection from these. Further sample pieces (uncatalogued) have been retained. 12 This will be published separately.</page><page sequence="9">MIKRE VIGLA: A BRONZE AGE SETTLEMENT ON NAXOS 71 2. Parallels cited for items presented in the catalogue are, as always, somewhat arbitrarily chosen. The aim has been to establish a date for each form in terms of either local or foreign (Minoan or Mycenaean) pottery development and, if possible, a place of origin. Assessment of the latter has been aided by a petrological study (Appendix 2). In many cases, general statements about date are supported primarily by reference to other publications where fuller justification has been attempted. For Middle and Late Cycladic pottery, especially the former, the most common reference is to the relevant chapters in the forthcoming publication of the 1974-7 excavations at Phylakopi on Melos (PhMC, PhLC). Although the Phylakopi material may appear in print somewhat later than the present article, it has seemed redundant to repeat here the full range of arguments and references and we hope that this procedure will not cause readers difficulty. EARLY CYCLADIC (FIGS. 5-7; PLATE I6) The Early Cycladic pottery collected at Mikre Vigla consists mainly of coarse ware sherds, as one would expect of settlement material, containing vessels for everyday use. Surfaces are often worn and there are few traces of burnishing. It is difficult to assign sherds collected in a surface survey to specific EC phases, as there is virtually no stratified material for parallels; except for the EC III phase as it was established at Kea and Phylakopi. The earlier phases are known either from cemeteries or from settlement sites where the stratigraphy is uncertain. For instance, a large part of the published EC II material from Kea comes from fills under floors, so its stratigraphic connection to the next phase is clear, but not to the earlier phases.'" The material from Akrotiri was found either in the 'deepest layers' or in pits dug for the pillars supporting the modern roof and includes at least one LN sherd.14 On Mt Kynthos on Delos two phases A and B (ECII and ECIIIA) were recognised, on the basis of external parallels and not stratigraphy and some material is grouped as A/B as it cannot be assigned with certainty to either phase.'5 Phylakopi still has the most complete stratigraphic sequence, but the ECI material from the earlier excavations seems to have more affinities with pottery found in cemeteries rather than settlements and the recent excavation which would help to define this phase has not yet been published in detail.'6 For these reasons, the chronology proposed here is tentative. Many well-known types were absent; there was no stamped or incised decoration, either of EC I or later date (other than the slashed bands); nor any of the fine painted pottery which characterises the material from Keros, Ayia Irini Phase II and Phylakopi I-i.'7 The rim of a collared jar (io) and some bowls and jars (4-6, 9) may represent the EC I phase. The sauceboat fragment is EC II and there are EC IIIA and EC IIIB types. The main body of material could be either EC II or III. In the following catalogue we have included only those sherds which are immediately recognisable. It is possible that some of the pottery classified below under COARSE WARE is Early Cycladic, as, for example, some plain bowl rims (298-300). '3 Keos Pt II 363. 14 BSA 8I (1986) 300-I.

Others are similar but rather coarser, and sometimes softer, in biscuit (= Melian Late Cycladic White) and a variant (Pale Gritty = PG) is often yellowish, rather pumice-like to the touch and with prominent grits. Our feeling that 'Pale Gritty' might be a Naxian version of this common Cycladic fabric is not supported by analysis,26 which suggests that it, together with all the other varieties, is Melian. Some few pieces are in the hard buff category also noted on Melos. Some are red-washed inside - a feature which is already well known,27 but may be characteristic of the later pieces (late MC/early LC). 'Later Local', the main Cycladic fabric of the LCI-II periods, is essentially a develop- ment of the coarser variety of Cycladic White (LCW), though it has by now acquired a distinctive buff - light orange tinge. A few pieces are rather harder fired and darker buff in colour (= Hard Buff). The decoration on the varieties of Cycladic White is in matt paint of varying thickness. In general the colour varies from black to brown and is often uneven. A purplish shade is not uncommon. One or two pieces are in the Black-and-Red style. Both the Curvilinear and the Naturalistic styles (earlier and later Middle Cycladic) are represented. The decorated Later Local material consists of one or two true Red-and-Black pieces and a larger number with simple monochrome designs. The paint is usually black or red and matt. On a fair number of fragments, there is a white slip applied before the decoration. The Red Washed sherds, entered below in the Dark Burnished section, are on a fabric closely related to Later Local. Comments on individual forms below will make clear that the material includes both earlier and later Middle Cycladic elements, as well as some which are indistinguishable from LC. The borderline betweent late MC and early LC is not easy to draw but the chronology of the bulk of the imports would suggest that here pieces of doubtful date are likely to be MC rather than LC. CUPS A number of fragments of PANELLED CUPS (see also below, under FEATURES) are found in all varieties of Cycladic White and, much less frequen- tly, in Later Local. The panel itself appears on only one fragment (125, below). 41. (P488) (FIG. 8; PLATE I7a). D .I7; CW (F); outside, thin line on rim and bracket below; inside, one solid semicircle pendent from rim.

The finer pieces (42, 41) seem likely to be Melian, assuming we are correct in recognising that island as the home of most of the fabric; others (46), less fine, seem to be from the same source but, on appearance alone, might equally well be local, as we 25 CBA 148-52, and i68f.

The Panelled cup28 is essentially a late MC form, though it began in the early MC period and is reasonably common, in a modified version, in early LC. Our pieces probably cover the whole range. A few should be earlier MC on the grounds of fabric (42) or decoration (129 below) or form (Ix6, 117). 46 should be late MC or early LC.

Some are coated inside (61, 65) and some may have had painted patterns on the exterior (59). Some, perhaps most, of these bowls are 'Cycladic', with a loop handle at the rim (65). 59. (PII) (FIG. 9).

The shape32 is most prominent in MC, both early and late, with some variations in form, although a taller version is quite common in LC. Our pieces are probably not later than MC.

D (max.) .078; small area of rim, plus c. 2/3 of handle; PG, hard fired with grey core to biscuit; traces of stripes on rim and handle. Upper S side. The version is well known from Phylakopi,33 though there is no strong evidence for the date. One OPEN BOWL has a ledge rim: 67- (P44) (FIG. 9). D c .30 (?); LL (SC); traces of red wash inside. AI5(E). This has some resemblance to a burnished piece from late MC Kea.34 There are fragments of BASINS in Later Local fabric: 68. (PI9) (FIG. 9).

An M-LC date is likely for this form, which is especially common in coarseware at Phylakopi, where there are also examples with stripes on the rim.35 The relative scarcity of pieces in CW fabric also points to a later date. A SPOUTED BOWL has a concave rim, unusual at Vigla, but well known at Phylakopi: 70. (Doumas) (FIG. 10; PLATE 17b).

It is fine for such a thick vase and recalls finds from MC Phyla- kopi38 and MH Kirrha and Aegina,39 though the shape is not identical. The design is unusually 'Geometric' for the MC period but the fabric cannot be earlier. It may therefore be early MC and is probably related to the matt class of 'Geometric' pottery which was discussed at some length in the original Phylakopi report40 but has since proved so difficult to isolate. It should be mentioned however that this shape is not included in that discussion. Although here classed as a jar, the closest parallel for the design is an MH kantharos from Aegina and the piece could also be of that form (see n. 39). Fragments of AMPHORAS: 85. (P489) (FIG. Io).

While there is no doubt that it belongs to the Black-and-Red style (based on burnished red circles, with matt black appendages), best known from Phylakopi,47 there are no exact parallels for the drawing of the bird. The solid black head (it may possibly have 'lost' an eye) is not characteristic of Phylakopi, but is closer to Theran pieces (birds and other animals).48 Speckled additions are also common on Thera, but not usually on the bodies and there they are in white rather than black.49 The round disc-body is much more typical of Phylakopi.

Interesting parallels (see individual entries above) for the fabrics and motifs can be drawn, particularly with material from Melos, both MC and LC, including the Black-and-Red style.

DARK BURNISHED POTTERY51 (including Red washed) (FIGS. 12-13; PLATES I9c, d, e, f) FABRIC The fabric of smaller vases is very similar to that of Plain Ware - usually brick or orange coloured, soft and slightly powdery to the touch, and without any large inclusions; indeed 51 CBA 146-8 and references; PhMC.</page><page sequence="25">MIKRE VIGLA: A BRONZE AGE SETTLEMENT ON NAXOS 87 many of the so-called Plain Ware fragments may have been burnished originally - a suggestion which is supported by the evidence of clay analysis. Larger vases (e.g. the ring-stemmed goblet fragments) are generally coarser, often with a grey core to the biscuit. The colour of burnish is most often red, brown or intermediate shades; sometimes darker, even black. For the definition of Red Washed, see below. The slip/burnish frequently survives only in tiny pieces which, together with the similarity of fabrics, causes difficulties in distinguishing between Plain and Burnished sherds. The best pieces are highly lustrous (e.g. 205) which suggests that they may be earlier rather than later in the MC series, at least if the chronologically documented decline of burnish-quality at Ayia Irini52 is true also of Vigla. Dark (as opposed to Red) Burnished sherds, much rarer, are on a very different, consistent greyish fabric, not unlike that of Cycladic White, for which a Melian provenance is indicated by clay analysis, though Thera may also be a possible source. The standard fabric, which does not seem markedly different from that of other sites, is likely to be local. Although scrappy, the DB pottery contributes important information to our picture of BA Vigla. It demonstrates that the second of the two major decorated MC fabrics was used at the site and the chronology of some of the forms, as well as the high quality of the burnish in some instances, suggests that the site was occupied through the MC period, as presently defined. Gaps in the range of shapes recognised (e.g. no Barrel/Ovoid Jars) may be explained in terms of the limited amount of material or local idiosyncracies. NOTE. Fragments are rims, red-burnished and normal in fabric, unless otherwise stated in the entries. FORMS There are a few fragments of fairly thin walled FLARING CUPS, probably of Straight-sided/ 'Keftiu' type: 151. (P75) (FIG. 12). D .0o8; traces of dark coat inside, apparently below the DB surface at the rim. A14(E). 152. (P82) (FIG. 12). D c .8. AI2(N). These fragments seem likely to be from 'Keftiu' cups of M/LC date,53 though the shape does not seem to be normal in Burnished ware. A few pieces of SEMIGLOBULAR/ROUNDED/ TEA-CUPS apparently have traces of dark burnish: 153. (P12I) (FIG. I2). D .11 I; fine, consistently sandy fabric. AI2(mid). 154. (PI23) (FIG. 12). D .08; as 153.

HADJIANASTASIOU PLAIN POTTERY (FIGS. 14-I6; PLATES 20a, b) FABRIC Pottery in this category is normally undecorated, but with smoothed surfaces and a less gritty biscuit than that of Coarse ware. The colour is usually light brown/dark buff, pinkish or brick-coloured. Some pieces have a grey core. A few are very thin-walled. The Plain category must include several sherds which were originally slipped and burnished or otherwise decorated, since several which were assigned to the Dark Burnished category because there were tiny fragments of paint adhering are otherwise indistinguishable from Plain ware. The similarity in clay composition between some Plain ware sherds and the main Dark Burnished group is confirmation of this.7 CUPS AND BOWLS Prominent are sherds of CONICAL CUPS, both shallow (215) and deep (214). 214.

This form is well known on Cretan and Cycladic sites in late MC/early LC.72 Our pieces are manu- factured in the standard Minoan technique, with cut-away string marks on the bases and pronounced grooves on the interiors.

The surfaces of large vases are often very rough, but smaller (and sometimes larger) vessels can have smoothed surfaces with the grits much less prominent. The biscuit frequently has a grey core. The fabric must be local, as may be a much smaller category of red-brown micaceous ware which has been recognised elsewhere on Naxos, also on other islands.89 BOWLS are found in many sizes and with numer- ous minor variations of rim form.

Parallels are to be found amongst the material from recent excavations at Phylakopi and in Period V at Ayia Irini.90 Although the material is some- what various and coarse shapes are difficult to date both because of their long-lived character (domestic functions do not change rapidly) and lack of published parallels, the bulk appears to be Middle rather than late Cycladic.

This group contains two rather different versions. 323-325 are relatively thin-walled and have plain rims, in two cases with plastic additions. The forms are paralleled among late MC/early LC material from other Cycladic sites.91 The studs and interior plastic additions are not so common, though studs are found on the exteriors of (M-) LC decorated basins at Phylakopi92 and our LL pieces (68, 69, above). Perforations are found near the rims of some MC coarseware bowls.93 326 is an example of a shallow and very thick- walled variety, found in Ayia Irini Periods IV and V, as well as in MC Phylakopi, and apparently a Middle Cycladic type.94 There are numerous fragments ofJARS, some (per- haps many) of hole-mouthed or bridge-spouted types.

D .27. AII(top). This is essentially an MC form, and perhaps an early one.98 Others have a pronounced concavity in the surface of the rim, presumably designed to hold a lid (perhaps of the same type as Keos Pt II D 6o, fig.

COMMENT Other uncatalogued Mycenaean sherds are mostly thin, in fine fabric, and often coated dark- reddish or black (see comment on kylikes above). The material, although very limited in quantity, seems to span the whole Mycenaean period. Overall, the prehistoric imports run from MMII- LHIIIC, with an apparent majority down to MMIIIA. The lack of any material earlier than MMII more or less accords with the position as presently understood at other major Cycladic sites, where only a few sherds of MMI date have been noted.122 The small amount of pottery is a disadvantage to coher- ent analysis and there is little material of LM/H I-II date to indicate the balance between Minoan and Mycenaean material at that time.

COMMENT Although it is not easy to provide comprehensive parallels for this fragmentary material, the presence of pottery of the periods indicated is clear and there is probably more, unrecognised, amongst the coarse ware. No generalisation based on a handful of sherds can carry very much weight but there is at least a possibility that a limited amount of fine ware - and more coarse - was being deposited at the site, for whatever reason, continuously from Geometric to Roman times, and later too. THE SMALL FINDS TERRACOTTA THE FIGURINES124 About 140 fragments of figurines have been recovered from Mikre Vigla. The majority are in the Naxos Museum, a few are in the sherd collection of the British School at Athens. This total includes the pieces from the Gratsias donation which, on grounds both of stated "23 We are grateful to Mr Guy Sanders for this identifi- cation. 124 This section of the report represents a first publica- tion of the figurines. We intend shortly to present them more fully and in a broader context. The writers would like to express their sincere gratitude to Dr M.-L. Collard, whose comments on the finds, particularly from the viewpoint of their Cretan rela- tionships, have been of inestimable value. She is not however to be held responsible for any of the opinions expressed.</page><page sequence="53">MIKRE VIGLA: A BRONZE AGE SETTLEMENT ON NAXOS 115 general provenance (Polichni) and similarity to our finds, seem to us likely to be from Mikre Vigla but cannot be said with absolute certainty to be from the site. FABRIC. There is some variation in fabric but the majority of figures are identical in this respect to the coarse pottery from the site - mid to dark brown surfaces with prominent white grits and a grey-black core (Fabric I). Less common are a group in a closely related but rather finer ware, with buff-reddish and smoothed (even lightly burnished) surfaces (Fabric 2). A few pieces have a lighter or darker buff finish, well smoothed or burnished, with occasional traces of red paint (Fabric 3). There is considerable variation in the types (parallels are cited mainly in the catalogue below), as defined both by body form and attributes. There is only one certain animal - and this may be a bucranium rather than the head of a formerly complete creature. SIZE. This varies from small to minute. The torso (534), whose surviving height is 5.Icms. might perhaps have had a total original height of c. 7.5cms. Many torsos were slighter than this and the figures to which they belonged must have been correspondingly smaller. The 'kourotrophos' figures (520o etc.) were perhaps about 3 cms. high. Some figures may not have been finished below the waist (53I etc.) and others are probably seated (528 etc.). BODIES. The majority were cylindrical or ovoid in section at the waist and some fragments which apparently belong to lower bodies and/or bases (548 etc.) suggest that they had cylindrical stem-like lower parts, without differentiated limbs. However the presence of many fragments of separate limbs (57x etc.), as well as the finished surfaces between the legs of one or two figures (546, 547) show that some had separately modelled arms and legs. It is in theory possible that some of these pieces are from votive limbs which were never attached to bodies, although there are never any suspension holes such as are common in Crete. It is not clear whether or not there were animals with torsos, since the one indubitably animal piece (563) may simply have been a bucranium, or whether there were other votive objects (e.g. 'anchors', see 546). HEADS. There is a good deal of variation in type. Mostly there is virtually no detail in the face, which is not separately indicated (512) or is simply pinched out of the upper part of a long tubular neck (555), leaving a plain domed top to the head. More often than not the intention seems to have been to give the head a backward tilt. The more elaborate figures (e.g. with cap and baldric - 51xo) have a rounded or oval head on top of a shorter neck of varying thickness. Some head types are flat-topped and pronouncedly triangular in plan (as well as concave) on the top (523, 528, 56i). Some have an oddly-shaped crown or headdress which may flatten and broaden (56o, 559) and/or sweep back (558) - rather in the manner of some Cretan figures though, in their case, the sweep seems normally to be forward. The 'Early Cycladic' heads (552 etc.) are quite different from the rest. The head is a long oval, with a strong backward tilt, the whole forming a separate unit on top of a relatively thin cylindrical neck. In general, features are not often marked, other than by pinching, but the best preserved of the 'EC' figures (552) has a long prominent nose on its oval face and, in one case (56o), the eyes are defined by means of tiny circles, lightly impressed with some kind of tool. POSTURE. As far as we can tell, the figures were mostly standing. Some were probably</page><page sequence="54">116 R.L.N. BARBER and 0. HADJIANASTASIOU seated (528 etc.) and others may have been merely torsos fixed to a kind of support rod (531 etc.). Bends in some of the limb fragments suggest that they might have been raised to the head or chest (540), possibly in the Cretan gesture of worship. Where arms are fully preserved, albeit in a schematic form, they are either outstretched (544) or inclined inwards towards the chest or, in the case of the 'kourotrophos' (520 etc.), holding an object. ATTRIBUTES. These are few but interesting. Two (51o, 5Ii) have caps formed of applied plastic bands. Several (512, 514, 515 etc.) have baldrics like EC hunter-warriors, though there are no signs of weapons. Three (520-2) appear to be clutching objects which we have assumed to be children, though, since they have no clear form, they might as well be something else (drums?). One (517) has a penis cover, another (518) probably a belt, perhaps a cover too. Two limbs (57I, 572) had some kind of plastic attachment, now broken off, conceivably a sword. CATALOGUE OF FIGURINE FRAGMENTS Figures with baldric and/or cap 510. (SF 5; NM7536). (FIG. 25; PLATE 25) Head and torso of figure with cap and baldric. MPH .046. Fabric 2. The nose pinched out; substantial chin; relatively deep eye sockets, possibly originally filled. Stumps remain where arms (separately modelled) have broken off. The torso relatively flat in section at the waist. The cap has a conical centre, the brim formed by a plastic band, oval in section; a similar band joins the peak of the cap to the band at the front of the head. The baldric also consists of a plastic band, parts surviving on the left shoulder and back, the rest of the original line visible in shadow. Found 30m. E of the bottom of Area 5. Cf. BSA 36 (1936) 121, fig. 25 14 (from Trapeza, EMII-III); Myrtos 212, no. 3, fig. 95, pl. 7IC, d (EMII). Caps of various kinds are common on simple Cretan figures, though baldrics are virtually non-existent amongst published material. 511. (G I). FIG. 25) Head of figure with cap, as 51o. MPH .026. Fabric 2. Worn. The neck was apparently longer than that of 510 and the head, tilted backwards and with a pointed chin, different from 5xo and closer to 553 (below). 512. (SF I; NM7428). (FIG. 25; PLATE 25) Head and torso of figure with baldric. MPH .051. Fabric I. The neck and head, apparently intact, are formed of a cylindrical projection upwards from the torso. The face was lightly pinched out but is not defined in detail. The left arm, again apparently intact, is a short stump; the right was presumably similar. The baldric is a roughly shaped flat plastic band, best preserved on the back where it flattens and thickens out at bottom left. Found in A6. Cf. EC marble figures: P. Getz-Preziosi, 'The hunter-warrior figure in Early Cycladic marble sculpture' in PCP 87-96, especially fig. I. 513. (SF 20; NM7433). (FIG. 25) Torso. MPH .038. Fabric I. Plastic additions - possibly a baldric over the right shoulder; indeterminate shapings on the rear of the figure, at arm level on either side. Found in AI2(S). 514. (SF 239). (FIG. 25; PLATE 25) Torso of figure, with baldric over right shoulder. MPH .041. Fabric I. The torso is a narrow cylinder. The back of the figure is worn but the baldric, a flat band, passes over the right shoulder and left arm (which is set by the side) and broadens out at the back, as 512. N. p. For baldric passing over the arm in a marble figure, see Sculptors 23, fig. I Ih. 515. (SF 6; NM7434). (FIG. 26) Torso of figure with baldric. MPH .043. Fabric I. As 512 but no head preserved and more rounded in section at the waist. Both arms appear finished and to be simply stumps, the left slightly longer. The baldric is narrow and rounded, best preserved under the left arm but hardly at all at the back. Found in AiI. 516. (SF 224). (FIG. 26) Torso, probably with baldric over left shoulder. MPH .03.

Getz-Preziosi - above 512 - 89 and fig. IA, B) and is common amongst Cretan terracottas (cf. BSA 9 (1902-3) pl. X). 518. (G 7). (FIG. 26; PLATE 25) Torso of figure, broken at waist, with remains of belt. MPH. 038. Fabric 2. The figure unusually long across the shoulders where broken. Unusual plastic treatment may represent a cloak under the left arm. The interpretation of this figure is problematic. 519. (G 8). (FIG. 26; PLATE 25) Torso. MPH .039. Fabric 2. Very worn on front. The left arm appears complete and to be formed of an applied pellet; the right has a tiny cylindrical boring, possibly for attaching the limb. Cf. 516, above. Kourotrophos type 520. (SF 4; NM7435). (FIG. 27; PLATE 25) Torso of small figure with a child (?) under left arm. MPH .023. Fabric 2, but harder fired than normal. The figure is very thin, and rectangular in section at the waist. The left arm is a short 'pad'; the right, of which a stump only survives, was probably simi- lar. The object held is formed from a short cylindri- cal blob of clay, broken at both ends. It is possible that the baby is misinterpreted. The object could in truth be virtually anything - a drum, for instance. Found in AI3(W). 521. (SF 3).

Ours may be mostly broken from figures rather than made as independent pieces. Other Fragments Some poor pieces with features which are duplicated in the catalogue have been omitted. A number of other fragments, apparently from figurines, but completely unidentifiable, have been retained but are not described or illustrated here. COMMENTARY The figurines from Mikre Vigla are unique in the Cyclades. While other figures have been discovered, these have almost all been either of a different material and level of sophistication (the EC marble pieces) or well-known Minoan or Mycenaean.types, presumably imported. The primary questions which present themselves are of chronology, origin and function.</page><page sequence="67">MIKRE VIGLA: A BRONZE AGE SETTLEMENT ON NAXOS 129 Origin and date The problems of origin and date are closely connected but it must be recognised that there is no prima facie case for regarding them, from this or any other point of view, as a unified group. Our figures are clearly locally made, with no certain and only one or two possible exceptions (in Fabric 3 - e.g. 561). Although the lack of obvious Cycladic parallels for these objects has already been remarked, it is true only if we think of very small-scale pieces in terracotta - and, even then, one or two of the terracotta heads from Kephala'25 are not far in form from some of ours. Two of the features which are most striking among the Vigla finds (and at the same time largely lacking in the Cretan material) find compelling similarities in EC marble figures. These are the long oval backward-tilted head, whose only plastic feature is a prominent nose - and the figure with baldric, of which the marble version has been dubbed the 'hunter - warrior' type.126 In the latter case, the sort of 'mistake' which we may see in figure 514, where the baldric passes over the figure's arm, is made also in a marble figure.'27 Further, many EC pieces have very long necks. Indeed, if we set the head 552 beside a marble parallel,128 it seems impossible that the one was not shaped by reference to the other. It is also of considerable interest that the belt and penis-sheath are found on Early Cycladic marble figures'29 and may even have chronological priority over Cretan examples'30 which are, however, more numerous. In terms purely of chronology, an EC date for some of our finds receives support from parallels with Early Minoan pieces, especially for the 'kourotrophos' type,131 which however is not itself so far known amongst the corpus of EC marble figures. If these parallels are valid and our suggestion of an EC date for some of the figures is correct, the significance for understanding the functions of both these and their marble counterparts is considerable. It makes absolutely clear that their function was not solely a funerary one and suggests that the possession and use of such figures may have been much more widespread than is usually thought, since they were available in this modest and obviously cheaper material. The awkward question of why they have not previously been recognised elsewhere remains. It is not likely however that all, or even necessarily the majority of the Mikre Vigla figurines are Early Cycladic. What of the remainder? They do not closely resemble Mycenaean figures'32 for, although there are one or two general similarities - columnar lower bodies, pinched-out faces - these are outweighed by the dissimilarities in fabric, decoration (most Mycenaean figures are painted) and basic figure types (no 'Phi' 'Psi' or 'Tau' or other known Mycenaean forms). Resemblances to Cretan figures (so far quite inadequately published)'33 are considera- 125J.E.

HADJIANASTASIOU bly closer. Many of the points of comparison are general (local manufacture, pinched-out faces etc., wide range of types) but there are some more specific similarities. The Cretan figures from peak sanctuaries like Petsofa, and other sites,134 are mostly larger, more fully modelled, with more detail in the features (eyes, breasts marked) and separate limbs. But there is a good deal of variation and most of the features found at Vigla are parallelled in some way or other. Some of our high-crowned heads resemble Cretan pieces'35 and caps of various kinds are quite common in Crete.'36 The arm postures - stumps which represent outstretched or inward-bent arms - also appear regularly in Crete.'37 Some of our types however (the figure with baldric, the 'kourotrophos') are not standard, though they are occasionally found, in the Cretan repertoire. We have no figures with weapons like the Petsofa piece with a dagger,'38 itself in any case quite unusual, and no figures whose gestures certainly duplicate those of Cretan worshippers.'" None of our figures have the bell-shaped skirt so common in Crete.140 We have no separate limbs, perforated for suspension,141 though not all Cretan limbs were so perforated.142 In view of the fragmentary nature of our material it is not however realistic to deny absolutely the possibility that some of these types may have existed at the site. The bull or bucranium (563) is certainly an item with clear Cretan connections.143 Bovids are common amongst Mycenaean figurines,144 though none such were found at Vigla. The bucranium also occurs in Mycenaean art, though, apart from the rhyton, it appears in representations,'45 rather than in corpore. The stylised form - horns of consecration - is well known, especially in Crete. Bovids are common at Petsopha.146 Many more horns and legs were found there, which might suggest that some were bucrania only. These examples are however much more three-dimensional than the flat-sectioned piece from Vigla and they have separately modelled arms and legs. One much larger but flat-sectioned bucranium from Prinias is in the Ayios Nikolaos museum. 561, which in any case is in a fabric that may not be local, looks like a piece from early palatial Knossos.147 Because of the nature of our project, none of these finds has a clear temporal or locational context. For chronology, all one can say is that the site has produced material of all periods from EC to Frankish and, in theory, the figures could belong to any or all of these. The most likely dating for the majority would superficially seem to be the period to which most of the pottery belongs, i.e.. late MC. This would suit some of the Minoan- looking pieces, also the Cycladic 'cruciform' examples (544, 545), but the deductions made above point quite strongly to the fact that the use of terracotta figures at the site began much earlier, in EC times, and might even be taken to indicate a priority of use in the islands. In view of the lack of Mycenaean figures from Vigla, in spite of their presence elsewhere in the Cyclades, including Naxos,148 we may conclude either that figurines 134 See n. 133. 135 BSA 9 (1902-3), pl.

To sum up, we seem to have figurines in use here from EC II, probably lasting throughout the MBA when they took on a more Cretan character, possibly into early LC, after which they may have died out. Function and use Finally we may consider the question of function and use. Precise reasons for the manufacture of simple terracotta representations of people, animals or objects are curiously difficult to determine.'49 While it is perhaps worth bearing in mind that some of these objects might have been toys for children, the most likely explanation seems to be that they had some connection with religious belief or practice, particularly in view of the parallels which can be adduced, which mostly come from graves and sanctuaries. Mikre Vigla is clearly a settlement site, not a cemetery, and the figures must be seen in that context, though it can not be absolutely clear whether they represent the remains of domestic use, widespread throughout the dwellings of the settlement or were deposited in some kind of a common centre - or both. The building on the summit would appear to be the prime location for such a 'shrine' (especially if it were related to sea-faring) and the figurine fragments which came from there must be close to their original place of use. It is impossible to tell, of course, how many of the rest were originally here, since the find-spots were quite widely scattered, though it is worth noting that there are virtually none from the SE part of the hill, which includes Area 16 and Structure 7, to which, for topographical reasons, material from above is least likely to have fallen. It may further be of significance that a proportion of the Mycenaean and post-prehistoric sherds came from the summit and one might conclude that, after the site itself became less important - or was abandoned - the building on the summit, so easily accessible from the sea, continued to attract visitors. This is exactly what happened in the later history of the Temple at Ayia Irini on Kea.'50 As to the precise ways in which the figures were employed, there is not a great deal to go on. Their quantity and modest character suggest personal possessions or offerings rather than cult figures. But what were they intended to represent? Perhaps not specific people so much as types - or the activities in which the individuals who made them or had them made might have been involved - hunting, fighting, childbearing, or simply doing obeisance to the gods. Animals might have symbolised sacrifices or gifts to the deity or a desire for fertility in the herd.'"' Our bucranium suggests a more direct connection with Minoan religious ideas. The circumstances of deposition can only be guessed at and depend, of course, partly on whether figures were created and kept in a household context - at times of crisis or 149 For consideration of some relevant points see R.L.N.

BARBER and 0. HADJIANASTASIOU passage or simply occasionally by custom - or whether they were offered in a public centre. In either case, one should perhaps see them standing on simple benches, shelves or altars. The tiny dimensions of many of the pieces (the 'kourotrophoi' are a case in point) suggest that they may either have been of purely symbolic value - or else that they were displayed in a confined physical context of very limited size - like the little box shrines that one sees today by the wayside, or a niche in the wall of the home. The idea of a domestic setting for many of the figures perhaps therefore gets some support from their small size. The curious feature mentioned in connection with 533 and the very thin flat sections of some other pieces (531-2) suggest that quite a number of the tinier pieces did not have complete lower bodies but were heads and torsos only, displayed by being attached to some kind of a thin rod. It is not difficult to visualise a group of figures, including but not exclusively composed of such types, each with their own connection with some important occasion, permanently set within a small household shrine. It is our failure to find evidence of such elsewhere, unless the not insubstantial number of fragments of marble figures from settlements are interpreted in this way'52 - and that argument would be valid only for the EC period - that casts doubt on this suggestion. On the other hand, there is nothing to support an exclusively shrine-based interpretation, since none of the known shrines (except to some extent the Minoan peak sanctuaries) contains figures like ours.

Most appear to be reused pieces of broken vessels but it is possible that some were specially manufactured. The most striking difference is in the character of the edges; some being very smooth and regular (e.g. 586), some very rough and jagged (590). This may be due to the relative ease with which a smooth finish can be produced on a soft or a hard fabric or it may be an intentional element in the manufacture or, again, it could be caused by the use to which the items were put. 58I seems certainly to have been used for rubbing, a process which deformed its regular shape. The perforated pieces were perhaps spind- lewhorls or light weights; the unperforated rubbers or counters or game pieces. Such discs with the same range of variations are well parallelled amongst the finds from LC Kea,'53 though none are illustrated. It is rather surprising that only one example appears among the finds from late MC Kea'54 and, on this evidence, the discs should be almost exclusively of LC date. SPINDLEWHORLS 59x. (SF 59).

It is not clear whether the upper surface represents a renewal or whether the application of a plastered surface was in two stages. The latter explanation may be supported by the fact that the lower layer, whose back is very uneven where it has been pressed against the wall, seems slightly coarser than the upper.

COMMENT The composition of the different fragments from S7 suggests that they do not all come from the same wall surface, or at least not from the same phase of application. In some cases there seems to have been a finer surface and a coarser lower layer - standard practice if decoration was to be applied;'58 in others a single layer, not always of the same consistency. Although there are no signs of figured scenes, fragments with coloured surfaces show that at least some of the buildings had quite sophisticated inter- ior decoration and add to the impression that Mikre Vigla was a settlement of greater importance than its forbidding geography and small scale might suggest. Figured scenes date from MMIIIA in Crete but perhaps not earlier than LC I in the Cyclades, though plaster painted with plain washes is found earlier'59 and there are coloured fragments from amongst the late MC material from Ayia Irini.'16 Our pieces presumably fall within the main period of occupation as defined by the pottery - late MC-early LC.

It would be interesting to know whether they represent trade, manufacture, or simply possession. The figurine fragment adds another to the list of those found in settlements (if it did not come from our putative 'shrine'). The large number of pieces of emery and marble on the site strongly suggests some kind of trading or manufac- turing operation, probably the former, since the tally of finished objects is so slim. The site is certainly well situated for such activity. The querns are of the saddle type and made of lava stone which must have been imported.

Of these, only six are of local material - emery or chert. Although small, this sample indicates the presence of an obsidian blade technology and, less well understood, of flake production.

Scale 1:2 MORPHO - TECHNOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS The morphology of the blades is comparable to that of other obsidian blades which have been found all over the Aegean. Among them, the most typical pieces are blades with parallel sides and triangular or trapezoidal cross-sections.162 From a technological point of view, the proximal fragments have an angular shape and, when it is preserved, a facetted butt (FIG. 35). Examination of the butts of the blades reveals that the pressure platform has been prepared there on an axis perpendicular to the axis of the flaking surface. There are no signs of preparation on the dorsal side of the blades. This technique of the special preparation of the platform seems to have had a long tradition, as it has been observed as early as the LN period at the mainland site of Franchthi, and continues in the Final Neolithic.'63 It is not yet clear whether this technique and the method of pressure flaking 162 R.

It is conceivable, however, that the larger percussion flakes were used as cores themselves. No diagnostic flakes were recognised which could be attributed to any specific typological or technological classification. They can only therefore be classified, somewhat unsatisfactorily, as 'unstandardised' flake technology - a description which has already been employed for obsidian from Middle Bronze Age levels at Ayia Irini.'65 ECONOMY OF THE RAW MATERIAL The great dependence of the inhabitants of the site on obsidian at this period and the relatively small amount of obsidian in relation to the other finds are immediately evident. It seems likely that trips to the island of Melos were undertaken regularly and that no alternative sources were explored. The limited amount of obsidian also suggests that the material might have been first imported to another site on Naxos - and then supplied to other centres, such as Vigla, in restricted quantities. In the absence of cores, we have no clue as to the form in which the raw material was imported, although the existence of flakes shows that not all the tools, at any rate, were imported ready-made. If this is a sign of intensive exploitation, involving the total exhaustion of cores, the presence of a relatively prominent flake technology, which has been shown to be very wasteful of raw material, is rather contradictory. There may therefore be a functional reason for the large number of flakes at the site, which we do not yet understand. The absence of any artefacts in other material (apart from a very few crude flakes of chert) leaves us with the obsidian blade fragments and the unretouched flakes as the only tools that can be identified. E. PANAGIOTOPOULOU MIKRE VIGLA - a review of the evidence The location of Mikre Vigla provides some strong pointers both to the reasons for initial choice of the site and to its likely character. It is secure and defensible and, at the same time, close to good land. The S side of the hill provides a sheltered, if steep, location for settlement and there are harbours or beaching facilities both to N and S of the site, which overlooks, with excellent visibility, the straits between Naxos and Paros - no doubt a significant marine highway in prehistoric times, as now. That the site was a settlement is clear from the copious finds of coarse and fine pottery of everyday use, as well as the house remains and the tangible evidence of domestic activities (spinning, weaving, grinding grain). Although the houses were in general probably small and modestly built, sharing party and terrace walls, there was some use of large boulders for building, proving the ability to mobilise a sizeable labour force and manipulate heavy weights. At least one of the buildings of the settlement (S7) had walls 164 0. Hadjianastasiou, in E. French and K. Wardle (eds.), Problems in Greek prehistory, 1987, 17 and pl. Ic. 165 R.

HADJIANASTASIOU adorned with painted plaster, suggesting that the community was more sophisticated than one might have guessed. The settlement was chiefly confined to terraces on the S slope of the hill throughout its life but, already in the EC period, it seems to have been large, since EC finds came from quite widely separated areas (12, I6). The relationship of this early village on the hill of Vigla to the previously located EC remains on the promontory is as yet unclear. The status of Vigla however seems to be underlined by the fact that some of the figurines can be assigned to this period. The EC pottery suggests a foundation date in EC I or II and continuous occupation throughout EC III, since we have material of both stages A and B. There is good evidence for the early MC period in the pottery, a substantial proportion of the Minoan imports may have arrived then, and a proportion of the figurines must be dated to this phase. Both local and imported pottery however suggests particularly intensive use of the site in later MC times, continuing into early LC. There are various signs of the strong Cretan influence already well known from other Cycladic islands at this period (fragments of the peculiarly Minoan fenestrated stand form are perhaps worth a special mention). Finds of the Late Bronze Age in general seem less prominent and we have tended to assume that the site declined after LC I-II. However both erosion of the later levels of the site and the difficulty of recognising local Late Cycladic III pottery may cast some doubt on this assumption. There are a number of Mycenaean imports, continuing well into LHIIIC. The series of local Cycladic pottery from Mikre Vigla is of great interest, even though it consists solely of surface material. It suggests that the site shared in the overall Cycladic community from this point of view, using the two main Middle Cycladic classes - Dark Burnished and Cycladic White. The prominence of Melian pottery amongst the finds (if the analytic evidence is correct) seems strange. The superficial conclusion that virtually all the pottery with painted designs was imported seems hard to accept, especially in view of the evidence for local production of Dark Burnished pottery, as well of coarser wares. If true, we must start to look for an explanation. Apart from the strength of connections with Melos, as demonstrated by the pottery, the firm evidence for contacts with Crete, especially in the time of the First Palaces, has already been mentioned. It is difficult to know how much emphasis to lay on quantities of sherds in such a small sample, but fragments of fine MM pottery are quite numerous and certainly more than one might have expected. The reasons that can be put forward for Vigla's outside contacts are, as usual, mostly rather general ones - the need for obsidian from Melos, the interest of the authorities of the Cretan palaces in exploring relationships with other Aegean centres. Vigla may have been a place where boats put in, even though bound for other destinations. A possibility suggested to us by the quantities of marble and emery fragments on the site is that Vigla was in some way connected with the export of these Naxian commodities. The relationship of Mikre Vigla to Grotta, apparently the largest settlement on Naxos in EC and LC times (and therefore perhaps MC too) is intriguing, though a matter for future consideration rather than immediate answers. Returning to the site itself, the archaeological evidence pushes one towards the view that the building on the summit may have been a repository for some of the many figurine fragments found, and it is possible that it may have been this which continued to attract visitors after the settlement had gone into decline. If this 'shrine' was a reality, its</page><page sequence="79">MIKRE VIGLA: A BRONZE AGE SETTLEMENT ON NAXOS I4I popularity as judged by the number of the figurine finds and the fact that they are unique to this site in the Cyclades, might have had something to do with harbour facilities and geographical position. It must be admitted, however, that there is nothing in the character or attributes of the figurines to support that idea. The most difficult problem associated with the figurines is just this fact - that they are unique in the Cyclades. We are reluctant, on this basis, to attribute a special significance to Mikre Vigla but the possibility has to be borne in mind. The finds from Mikre Vigla therefore tell us something about the nature of the site and the chronology of its occupation. The interest of the figurines is self-evident. Most important, perhaps, it enlarges our view of a relatively little known period of Naxian - indeed Cycladic - prehistory and we hope that it will encourage further research in the area and period. R.L.N. BARBER O. HADJIANASTASIOU APPENDIX I MIKRE VIGLA, NAXOS: the site, its maritime and landscape setting Naxos, the largest island in the Cyclades, offers considerable potential for settlements of quite different kinds. Extending 35 by 26km, its area of some 428 square kilometres (c 17o square miles) is characterised by a wide range of habitats. Though limited areas are covered by Tertiary and later deposits, most of the bedrock is more resistant. Intrusive igneous rocks, such as granites, or metamorphics such as schist, gneiss and marble are typical. The resulting scenery is often spectacular, with sharp mountain ridges gashed by deep ravines. In the highlands, remains of sites from many periods suggest that the difficulty of cross-country travel in the interior of Naxos often provided a welcome degree of security in the troubled history of the Archipelago. The island contains the highest point in the Cyclades, rising to 1,oo8 metres above sea level (over 3,300 feet), and attracts snow in wintertime. In contrast, Naxos also offers some of the largest areas of fertile land in the islands, such as the plain of Tragaia, and many sheltered and relatively well-watered valleys nestle between the craggy spurs which protrude east and west from the main north-south mountain spine. Although grain is grown (with barley traditionally more important than wheat), Naxos has long been known particularly for its vegetables and tree crops. Though even in this century pigs have been reared in surviving patches of oakwood, the forests of former times have largely gone and it is the planted groves of olives, lemons, oranges, apricots and almonds which have become a characteristic and productive feature of the landscape of Naxos in the recent past. The Bronze Age use of Mikre Vigla is interesting because the site lies neither in the security of the high mountain country, nor in the sheltered plains and valleys. It is set on the windswept headland sometimes known as Cape Parthenos, which protrudes from the west coast of the island approximately 8 km south of the present port of Naxos. In this port, the igneous rocks which elsewhere contribute to the island's high spine instead outcrop at low altitudes, and the headland is made up of the eroded remnants of an intrusion of granite. This rises abruptly from the sea to a height of almost 6om (2oo feet). The rock has weathered into the well-rounded massive forms typical of granite, and the</page><page sequence="80">142 R.L.N.

Aspects of this coastal setting will be discussed before characteristics of the site itself are examined, and then its landscape context will be considered. THE COASTAL SETTING As elsewhere throughout Greece, the possibility of shoreline change has to be taken into account before attempting to assess the relationship between prehistoric coastal sites and their environment. Alterations in the relative levels of sea and land have to be considered, along with the processes of erosion and deposition. On balance, it seems not unlikely that western Naxos has been subject to some submergence since the site at Mikre Vigla was occupied. The permit under which the present study was carried out did not however cover investigations using diving techniques, so no first-hand evidence is available. There are local rumours of stone</page><page sequence="81">MIKRE VIGLA: A BRONZE AGE SETTLEMENT ON NAXOS 143 s5 s7 sl 60 m 40 20 Sea Level FIG. 37.

Though this could not be evaluated underwater, it is injudicious to reject such accounts out of hand. Glass-bottomed buckets are used by the octopus hunters, and the accuracy of their observations has been confirmed by archaeo- logical divers working nearby, off Paros and Antiparos."66 The considerable number of land-built structures found underwater there makes it unlikely that western Naxos would have been immune from what appears to be a regional submergence, and whilst many of the remains on the sea bed reported in these papers are difficult to date, some certainly appear to be later than the period of the occupation of Mikre Vigla. Until local direct evidence of the contemporary shore level becomes available, it would therefore seem safest to assume that originally the Vigla site stood somewhat higher relative to the sea than at present. The way in which remains of the Mycenean period now under excavation at the port of Naxos descend below the present marine-controlled watertable would appear to confirm that a post-Bronze Age submergence of west Naxos is probable. Although submergence seems likely, it would probably be wrong to assume that all the traces of human activity which may now be seen below present sea level here should be associated with changes of level. For example, without recourse to diving, artificial cuttings may be observed in rock in the shallows along the beach which runs south from Mikre Vigla. These are wholly underwater, and the layout does not suggest salt-pans. The rectangular cut edges and the consistent module size suggest the quarrying of regular standard-sized blocks. The material is not the igneous bedrock, but a beach-rock formed by natural cementation of the sand. In this region of recalcitrant granites, it offers a much more amenable material for masons. Although it might be tempting to conclude that quarrying suggested relative sea level change, none of the cuttings appears to extend out to depths where it would be impracticable to work by wading, at the present water level. It therefore seems simpler to assume that this resource was exploited where it developed, i.e. in the shallows, rather than invoke a complex sequence whereby the beach-rock would first be created underwater, then emerge above the surface to be quarried, before being re-submerged to its present position. 166 I.

HADJIANASTASIOU The evidence from Paros and Antiparos referenced above suggests submergence of between 3 and 6 metres. We must consider whether changes of this order would alter the topography at Mikre Vigla sufficiently to affect the archaeological interpretation of the site. Both the apron of low land completing the peninsula to the north, and the beach areas flanking it to north-east and south, have profiles which are commonly of gentle gradients. A lower relative sea level would thus certainly shift their shorelines noticeably to seawards of their present positions. The extent of the low rocky islets offshore would also be increased. The scope of the changes would obviously vary according to the local profiles and the actual amount of vertical movement within the suspected range, but in general a lateral difference of the order of some tens rather than many hundreds of metres seems likely. In the most extreme case, with level change towards the maximum end of the postulated range and more sediment overlying the bedrock than is now the case, it is possible to envisage the present-day islet to the north being linked to the peninsula. Whilst this would marginally increase local land-use potential, it would not alter the essential nature of the site, in the way that such a level change appears to have altered the setting of Saliagos. There the present islet seems likely to have formerly been a hillock on a landbridge linking Paros and Antiparos.'67 Nothing quite so radical has to be allowed for in interpreting Mikre Vigla, in that though its area may have changed, there is no reason to doubt that the site has remained a peninsula. Indeed, because of the relatively steep-to profile of the hill of Mikre Vigla itself, even a 6m change would not significantly alter its area or its immediate potential for human use. Attention has also to be given to the possibility that the coastal configuration has been altered by processes of erosion and deposition. The hardness of the igneous rocks is such as to suggest that even where they are directly exposed to wave attack, it is unlikely that they have been significantly eroded in the geologically short period since the Bronze Age occupation of Mikre Vigla. In some parts of Greece, notably at the head of the Thermaikos Kolpos, deposits from major rivers have advanced the coastline significantly during the Holocene, and indeed in historic times. In the Cyclades, however, most streams dry up in summer, and Naxos stands alone with Andros in having rivers with a constant flow. Even these are of no great volume, and though material eroded from inland contributes to the local beaches, river action is not a dominant factor in coastal evolution around Mikre Vigla. The pattern of what is happening appears to involve three main factors: the fixed points provided by Cape Parthenos and lesser outcrops of resistant bedrock; the plentiful supply of beach sand; and the longshore drift, which is powered by the strong southwes- terly winds of winter and the powerful Meltemia which blow from the north for most of the summer. The result is a tendency for long straight beaches to develop along northwest/ southeast and northeast/southwest lines, linking the geologically strong points. Immediately south of Mikre Vigla, the northwest/southeast beach line has cut off from the sea a semicircular lagoon area, now filled with soft mud and evaporite deposits. This would appear to merit future investigation, on more than one count. It appears to have been cut off from the sea relatively recently (and if the beach goes through a cycle of depletion, it could well become reconnected). As a lagoon sheltered in the lee of Mikre Vigla when the Meltemia blow, it would have offered a valuable harbour for small craft. Its waterlogged deposits might well preserve interesting boat remains as well as organic 167 Morrison op. cit. n. 166.</page><page sequence="83">MIKRE VIGLA: A BRONZE AGE SETTLEMENT ON NAXOS 145 material for environmental studies. If the supposition that relative sea level was lower here in prehistoric times is correct, the hollow may contain a soil horizon or indeed a fragment of ancient rural landscape, preserved beneath the infill. The lagoon site is a natural salt-pan, and this is just one of the maritime resources which may have been exploited by the occupants of Mikre Vigla. The location on the headland is an ecotone site in several senses. Not only is it strategically located to make use of the resources of both land and sea, but it allows convenient access to several aspects of both the terrestrial and the marine environment. In the immediate locality there are the products of the ecology both of rocky headlands and of sandy shores. Besides scope for collecting mollusca, crabs and other seafoods, and for fishing off the rocks and netting from the beaches, the site has much to offer boatmen. Overall, the coastline of Naxos tends to be very regular, with few sheltered inlets of any size. Many stretches are rugged and steep. At Mikre Vigla, however, there is a choice of beaches with different exposures, where boats can readily be drawn up. Today they are favoured by wind-surfers. That to the north-east offers a sheltered landing when south-westerly gales blow; and this situation would tend to be enhanced if a lower sea level extended the headland towards the northerly islet. When the Meltemia blow down out of the north, there is a well sheltered area at the head of the northwest/southeast beach, in the lee provided by the hill of Mikre Vigla itself. This corner would have offered reliable shelter, whether or not the lagoon was open. At the present day, a caique is frequently left untended for long periods moored to the rocks at the foot of the south side of the site. This emphasises the dependability of the shelter there in the period of the Meltemia, since if the wind went round to blow hard from the south, it would be at immediate risk. The headland extends far enough out to the west to suggest that shelter from northerly gales would still be adequate even if the beachline lay farther to seawards, in a phase when relative sea level was several metres lower than at present. We know that from at least the Neolithic onwards, fishing was important at some Cycladic sites.'"" Gamble, however'69 has pointed out that at some favourable locations the finds suggest that fishing was not in fact exploited. Though attention may thus be drawn to the potential of Mikre Vigla in ecological terms, and as a base for seamen, it would require excavation to establish whether that potential was actually realised. Although meaningful surface finds of fishbones are unlikely, there is a better prospect of establishing from surface collection whether the occupants of Mikre Vigla used boats to transport raw materials and finished goods. Some of the finds are ambiguous, in that they could have been brought by either land or sea. Although whole artifacts of marble were not found, some finished fragments and rough pieces were present. Geologically, these certainly did not belong on the hill. The same was true of pieces of emery, commonly used as an abrasive in marble working. Both occur on Naxos, but at a distance. It is not inconceivable that in the Bronze Age as in more recent times it was found convenient to move such heavy materials by boat, rather than packing them overland through difficult country. Some of the finds certainly had come at least part of the way to Mikre Vigla by sea, however. There were sherds of pottery from Melos, and Minoan and Mycenean wares. Some other sherds of less distinctive styles may well have been imports. 168 e.g. Evans and Renfrew op. cit. n. 166; J.L.

HADJIANASTASIOU THE SITE ITSELF There are two parts to Cape Parthenos. The 6om hill which is the site of Mikre Vigla itself, and the apron of lower ground to the north. Much of the latter lies within 15m of present sea level, and although bedrock generally appears to be close to the surface, that area is generously smothered in blown sand. Because of this it is difficult to evaluate the shortage of visible prehistoric sherds there, compared to their density up on the sand-clear surface of the hill. There would seem to be three main possibilities. Firstly, it may be that the difference is more apparent than real, and that signs of occupation in the lower area are simply masked by the sand. There is indeed the prospect that the sand layer may be preserving remains with better potential for excavation than those which seem likely to have survived in the thin soil cover on the exposed slopes of the hill. If the difference is real, it might be interpreted in two ways. Lack of low-level settlement might reflect greater vulnerability to attack there than on the heights above. Alternatively, it might merely be a matter of relative comfort. The low ground has no shelter to the north, and bears the full brunt of the Meltemia throughout the summer. Thus, though there are reliable wells there, it is not an attractive area either for cultivation or habitation unless effective shelter is organised. It was noticeable that though there are shelves on the north-east facing slope of the hill large enough to accommodate a substantial stone-built mandra (a modern goat shelter), there was relatively little sign of ancient sherds on that up-wind side compared to the amount they found on the lee side. The effect of these winds should not be under-rated. As the Naval Intelligence Handbook puts it, in the Cyclades the northerly gales of summer 'blow for long periods at a time and are exceedingly fierce... on the heights they prevent the growth of vegetation and even the movement of men and animals.'70 Barber reinforces this: 'When the summer "meltemi" is blowing from the north in the Cyclades, you can be almost swept off your feet on a hilltop or exposed slope, while the sheltered side is virtually windless."' This is certainly so at Mikre Vigla. During the survey work, the calm on the lee side of the hill was in marked contrast to the boisterous conditions to windward. It seems not impossible that security and shelter were both factors in the choice of the site. The isolation of the hill, set out on its peninsula, gives excellent all-round visibility (as the modern name may suggest). Trouble could be seen coming over a radius of several kilometres, by land as well as by sea. Then immediate access presents considerable difficulties round much of the perimeter of the hill. There are stretches of sheer cliffs on the landward as well as the seaward side, and the jumble of massive granite boulders is awkward to traverse. But although the site clearly has natural advantages as a refuge, there is no obvious sign that its security has ever been enhanced by artificial fortifications. Other interpretations must therefore also be considered. If the cairn on the summit of the hill marks some kind of shrine, it is possible that in antiquity the advantage of all-round visibility was perceived there not in terms of look-out sentinels but rather in that of the prestige of being seen from afar. However the hill was used, one disadvantage would have been the shortage of drinking water up there. Although the cracks and minor hollows in the granite hold winter showers, on the hill itself there are no obvious cisterns, or wells (which would have been a major undertaking in that rock).

HADJIANASTASIOU excavation suggests one solution. Unless actually beseiged, it would have been simplest to carry up water from the coastal plain, where wells are easily dug and reliable. There is one recommended to modern campers closeby on the low-lying northerly extension of the peninsula. THE LANDSCAPE SETTING Water is in fact seldom a problem in the strip of coastal lowlands from which the headland protrudes. The rainfall shows the usual Mediterranean winter maximum with over two-thirds of the annual total of around 38omm (15 inches) tending to fall between the start of November and the end of February. Although July and August average just half a day with rain each, summers on Naxos are never quite rainless, and groundwater from the foothills backing the coastal plain can also help to keep the Wells there supplied during the drier months. As noted above, snow can fall on the higher mountains of Naxos in winter time. The size of the island and the enclosed nature of some of the deeply incised inland valleys combines to make these cold in winter but hot and sultry in summer. The ameliorating effect of the sea is however apparent at both times of year in coastal lowlands like that in which Mikre Vigla is set. Frosts are rare on all the lower ground, and have very seldom been recorded at a meteorological station close to the sea in Naxos. The average annual temperature in lowland Naxos is around 65 degrees Farenheit (18 degrees Celsius), with monthly averages varying between about 54 F (12 C) in January/February, and 77 F (25 C) in July/August. The nearest high ground to the site is a ridge, half a kilometre wide and topping Ioom a.s.l., which runs into the coastal plain from the north-east. The tip of the ridge is bifurcated, and its northerly spur reaches the coast just beyond the beach which flanks the northern side of the promontory. The southerly spur is aligned with the hill of the Mikre Vigla site, but stops short of it. The snout of the ridge sweeps steeply down to the level of the coastal plain, much of which is less than 2om above sea level, and a flat bottomed col intervenes between there and the start of the hill. Immediately inland of the site hill, the col is at its lowest (much of the land is within Iom of present sea level), and sand blows through between the beaches. Except where this occurs, however, most of the coastal strip is of fertile and adequately watered soil. The distinction between the level land of good arable potential and the rocky inland ridge with its thinner soils is now very obvious in the cadastral pattern. As the perspective diagram illustrates, the valued lowland is heavily subdivided into a network of small fields. While there are some walled fields on plateaux on the upper part of the ridge, most of its slopes are unenclosed rough pasture. It is difficult to evaluate how much soil there may formerly have been on the flanks of the ridge. Some scrub grows there at present, despite the depredations of the goats, and it was presumably better wooded in the past. The best prospect for establishing the status of local woodland at the time of the Bronze Age occupation of Mikre Vigla would seem to be to attempt to recover pollen from the lagoon in-fill. We can assume that some soil erosion would have followed deforestation, so the likelihood is that the slopes were originally more productive than they now appear. Even in the recent past this seems to have been so, since in some areas (e.g. the re-entrant between the spurs, and the rolling country marking their northern margin) a great deal of work has been put into terracing, the characteristic</page><page sequence="87">MIKRE VIGLA: A BRONZE AGE SETTLEMENT ON NAXOS I49 recourse of the Aegean islanders for maintaining and exploiting soil on difficult terrain. Many terraces here appear to have been abandoned quite recently; it would be interesting to know how far in the past their origins lay. That is however almost impossible to ascertain with such features, which have to be rebuilt so often in the course of routine maintenance. CONCLUSION Although uncertainties such as this can not readily be resolved, what is clear is that the occupants of Mikre Vigla were well placed to exploit a useful range of potential resources, maritime and terrestrial. They had ready access to the products of sandy and rocky shores, together with beaching places and sheltered moorings for fishing and trading craft. The coastal strip widens to both south and north of the ridge, offering tens of square kilometres of fertile land along this part of the litoral of western Naxos, in marked contrast to the rugged and precipitous coast of much of the rest of the island. The spurs facing the site set one onto a ridgeway which leads up into the high hunting country of the hinterland. Bintliff'72 has concluded that in the prehistoric Cyclades proximity to resources for basic subsistence by agriculture and/or fishing was of absolutely over-riding importance in the choice of settlement locations. Problems arise with his view, however, in cases such as that of Phylakopi on Melos, where though the site was well placed for fishing, excavation shows that this was not in fact a major activity. Faced by difficulties such as this Gamble'7 countered Bintliff by suggesting that by the time of the Bronze Age the social environment as much as the physical one was a determinant, in that by then settlements functioned in relation to one another within a broad regional network. He concluded that it was unrealistic to interpret the siting of each in isolation or to consider only local provision for self-sufficiency in food. Very much the same principles emerged from a study of sites from a wider range of periods carried out elsewhere by the present writer.174 If the figurines of Mikre Vigla had more than secular meaning, and if the kerbed cairn on the summit was a shrine set there so that it could be seen from afar, the users of the hill may have perceived the site's virtues in terms very different from those we would tend to attribute to seekers after a combination of security with seaside subsistence. Natural resources are cultural appraisals. The results of the non-destructive survey carried out at Mikre Vigla should thus be regarded as a base-line for future research, rather than as being conclusive. The wide range of possible resources to which the site offers access has been established, but it would take excavation to clarify which of them had actually been valued and exploited. With discontinuous and shallow stratigraphy set amongst massive granite boulders, even an excavation would be unlikely to answer all our questions. IAN A. MORRISON 172 Bintliff op. cit. n. 168. 173C.

HADJIANASTASIOU APPENDIX 2 PETROGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF MIKRE VIGLA WARES INTRODUCTION Petrographic analysis was undertaken of samples of the Mikre Vigla wares at the Fitch Laboratory in Athens as part of a larger material study of Bronze Age Cycladic ceramics." The purpose of the petrographic work was twofold: to obtain compositional data allowing more precise ware characterisations, and (where the data were sufficiently distinctive) to permit suggestions to be made for the provenance of the samples. The petrographic data would also establish the existence of multiple fabrics within ware categories and any use of common materials for the production of different wares."17 THE SAMPLES Thin sections were prepared for samples of each of the seventeen wares identified by the archaeologists. Each ware was represented by between four and nine thin sections depending on the range of fabric attributes and vessel sizes present in each category. In this way it was hoped to avoid excluding from ware groups those fabrics whose only major distinction was the size of inclusion due to the sample being from a larger pot, or thicker part of a pot. Grain sizes were measured with an eyepiece graticule and stage micrometer fitted to the microscope and frequencies were estimated by eye with the aid of comparator charts.'77 Total inclusion percentages are stated for those inclusions larger than silt for each fabric group. Unless noted, inclusions showed no orientation or grading within the sections. A total of eighty-nine thin sections were examined, and the numbers used in this report refer to the thin section sample numbers. For purposes of this discussion the features common to all the fabrics in a material group are discussed first, and then only the most diagnostic features of the fabrics are presented. THE PETROGRAPHIC RESULTS Examination of the thin sections of the wares from the Mikre Vigla Survey produced three broad classes of material: fabrics with a metamorphic-granitic/granodiorite profile, calcareous fabrics containing volcanic inclusions (rhyodacite and tuff), and those samples with less distinctive sedimentary profiles (see FIG. 39). "75 The author is grateful to Dr Robin Barber and Mrs Olga Hadjianastasiou for the opportunity to study this material. It is anticipated that the wares and fabrics discussed here in a preliminary report will be presented at a future date in greater detail as a part of the Fitch Laboratory petrographic study of Bronze Age Cycladic ceramics. "76 The word 'ware' is here defined as a class of ceramic objects which share attributes of morphology, decoration, composition and technology. 'Fabric' refers to the mater- ials of the fired clay paste. 177 Comparator charts used for this report included the Wentworth Scale for sediment grain sizes (e.g. P.A.

Metamorphic/Granitic Group (PLATE 32a, b) Five fabrics were included in this category made up of the following wares: Dark Burnished (dark), Dark Burnished (red), Plain Ware, Hard Buff, Red-Brown Micaceous Ware, Semi-Coarse and Coarse Wares. The fabric groups represent material consisten- cies, such as the Semi-Coarse/Coarse Ware group where size of inclusions was the only difference, or the Dark Burnished/Plain Ware group which illustrated the problem of ware identification for archaeologists once the surface finish of a sherd is lost. If all the Plain Ware samples had matched the materials of the Dark Burnished sherds then there might have been a case for suggesting the use of common materials for both wares. However the remaining five Plain Ware samples were different in material terms, and quite heter- ogeneous as one might expect for such pottery. In general these fabrics represented clays which were frequently micaceous with origins in schist, granite or granodiorite formations. The ferruginous groundmass of the samples was predominantly oxidised or partially oxidised dark red-brown colours (Munsell 5YR 5/6-8, 2.5YR 4-5/8). Percentages of quartz silt and fine mica laths present in the clay groundmass varied by fabric. The most common rock fragment inclusions were quartz-</page><page sequence="90">152 R.L.N. BARBER and 0. HADJIANASTASIOU mica schists, quartzites, chert, granites or granodiorites, and some phyllites, siltstones, silty marl clasts, micrites and silicified iron-rich mudstones. These rock fragments varied greatly in size, often within single samples. The metamorphic rock inclusions were normally more angular than the volcanic and argillaceous clasts. The most common discrete mineral inclusions &gt;.125mm were feldspars, biotite micas, quartz (mono- and polycrystalline), hornblende and clinopyroxene (both usually altered), kyanite, muscovite, chloritoid and infrequent carbonate impurities. Rutiles and red iron oxides (probably haematite), apatite, garnets and zircons were common accessory minerals. The feldspars were both plagioclase and alkali, frequently euhedral, zoned, with simple and complex twinning. The more diagnostic features are discussed below. Dark Burnished (dark and red)/Plain Ware Fabric Group The first fabric group, including samples of these three wares, contained between 3-5% inclusions, and was distinguished by abundant fine biotite micas, frequent quartz silt and iron oxides in the matrix. The groundmass contained rare voids and appeared compact and uniform in grain size. Larger inclusions occurred only infrequently, ranging in size from o.25-4.oomm, and were primarily angular fragments of polycrystalline quartz showing varying degrees of strain, or granitic fragments with subordinate biotites and weathered feldspars. The feldspars and quartz were occasionally intergrown in a micrographic texture common to microgranites. Carbonate impurities were rare and occurred either as incomplete fossil tests or as rounded clasts of silty marl. On several Dark Burnished samples it was possible to see a thin layer of slip adhering to the surface of the sherd, reduced at the outer edge. In all cases there was a marked orientation of the finest matrix constituents parallel to the vessel surfaces. This feature is consistent with the strong mechanical manipulations of the clay paste during smoothing (preparation for a fine surface finish) and burnishing (finish). Two samples of this ware (41 and 44) were slightly distinctive. The former contained a large (5mm) angular fragment of muscovite-sericite schist, with discrete muscovite and kyanite present in the fabric, with feldspars commonly showing sericitization. The presence of a larger rock fragment may be due to the sample coming from a handle (rather than a fine body sherd). The other sherd was made from a siltier clay with fine micas only a subordinate feature. Weathered feldspars and kyanite were rare, and one large (5mm), very weathered rounded volcanic rock fragment was noted. The Plain Ware Group The five remaining samples of Plain Ware presented a heterogeneous material picture with around Io% total inclusions per sample, and varying degrees of groundmass compaction and grainsize size uniformity. The groundmasses contained abundant silt, with fine micas (.I25-o.25mm) in common to moderate percentages in three samples. Fine-grained carbonate clasts (micritic limestone and marl, o.25-3.oomm) occurred in a different three samples, with silty limestone clasts in one. A few rounded siltstones (o.5o-3.oomm) appeared in one slide, and a few angular quartzite fragments (0o.25- o.5omm) were present in another. Two samples contained small quartz-mica schist fragments, while another sample contained several rounded clasts of a similar size (o.25-o.50mm) chlorite-sericite schist. Weathered plagioclase (?) feldspars, altered</page><page sequence="91">MIKRE VIGLA: A BRONZE AGE SETTLEMENT ON NAXOS 153 amphiboles and opaque iron oxides were the only other notable inclusions. Two samples showed a moderate degree of matrix particle orientation parallel to the surfaces. Hard Buff Group The Hard Buff group was characterised by an extremely fine-grained groundmass with 1-3% inclusions and a moderately-well compacted texture, frequent quartz silt and tiny pale micas. Other inclusions were rare, consisting of angular quartz grains with strained extinction, iron oxides and ferruginous concentrations of clay, angular fragments (o.25mm) of chlorite schist. One sample (37) contained rounded moderate percentages of silicified mudstone and phyllite fragments (o.5o-i.oomm), and another (40) had larger and more numerous angular quartz grains, quartzite, chert, biotites (o.25mm) and weathered plagioclase feldspars. This slightly coarser sample was not derived from a wider-walled vessel or vessel appendage, so vessel size was not the most apparent cause for the material variation. This group then may represent the more metamorphic end of the material profile for this first group of Mikre Vigla wares, these two samples spanning the grain-size range for sediments derived from a weathered metamorphic phyllite-schist series of rocks. Two samples (37, 40) showed parallel orientation of the finest constituents, and sample 40 also showed grading, with the finest particles at both edges. Red-Brown Micaceous Ware This ware presented a relatively uniform material profile with around 20% inclusions and a groundmass appearance of only moderate compaction and grain-size uniformity. The groundmass contained abundant percentages of biotite laths (.125-O.25mm) and similar size angular quartz grains. These inclusions were also present in sizes larger (up to I.oomm) than those of the groundmass. A few subangular carbonate rock fragments were noted (i.50mm) and quartzite-marble fragments occurred rarely, one with tremolite and biotite, another with inclusions of hypersthene. Serpentine, kyanite (weathered), musco- vite and clinopyroxene occurred infrequently. The samples showed consistent parallel orientation of the finest particles parallel to the surfaces, and represented sediments derived from a metamorphic formation which included recrystallised limestones and marble. Semi-Coarse and Coarse Ware Group (2 Dark Burnished (red)) The Semi-Coarse and Coarse Ware samples were grouped together since the only material difference between them was the consistently smaller size of the largest inclusions in the first ware (3.oomm). This was most probably the result of the interference of the potter (removing the larger inclusions) rather than selection of a naturally finer-grained deposit of the same clay. Two sherds of Dark Burnished (red) were made from materials similar to those of the Semi-Coarse samples, with slightly fewer micas and rare fossil carbonates. The groundmass of this group was moderately fine-grained and not well compacted, with frequent angular quartz silt. The overall percentage of inclusions was high (3o-4o%), ranging in size from .125-5.oomm, with the majority falling in the o.25-3.oomm range. Discrete grains of angular quartz, cloudy feldspars (often showing seriticization), pla- gioclase (with lammelar twins) were the most common inclusions. Kyanite, some large</page><page sequence="92">154 R.L.N. BARBER and 0. HADJIANASTASIOU (o.75mm) fresh biotites, red iron oxides and very fine olivines were rare. Some quartz was intergrown with alkali feldspars in a micrographic texture reminiscent of microgranites, and rare examples of myrmekite (sodic plagioclase intergrown with vermicular quartz) were noted. Three of the Coarse Ware sherds had higher than average percentages of biotite and muscovite micas in the groundmass (65, 66 and 69), and two sherds (66 and 69) had significantly higher overall percentages (40-50%) of inclusions, particularly quartz (silt and larger discrete grains), with accessory minerals very rare. Three coarse ware sherds showed parallel orientation of the constituents (64, 66, 69). The Rhyodacite-Tuffaceous Volcanic Fabrics (PLATE 33a, b) This calcareous group of samples represented seven wares, primarily the pale-firing clays (Munsell 2.5Y 7/2-4, 6/2; 5Y 7/2-4) except for the suspected Mycenaean and Minoan imports. The material profile was sufficiently homogeneous however for the group to be characterised as a single fabric type, with minor variations which followed the ware categories for the most part. The groundmass of these wares exhibited some variations in compaction and uniformity of grain size, but was generally very fine-grained containing moderate to frequent percentages of quartz silt. The fabric normally had significant numbers of well-preserved calcareous fossils (primarily foraminifera) and frequent rounded micritic clasts or scatters of lime. Detrital chert and polycrystalline quartz with strained extinction were common along with various types of volcanic rock fragments in a range of sizes, shapes and frequencies. The igneous rock fragments included volcanic glass, tuff, andesite and rhyodacites. Euhedral feldspars (o.25-o.50mm) were frequent inclusions, primarily fresh and occasionally as glomerocrysts. The feldspars were both plagioclase and alkali, showing simple and complex twinning and occasionally discontinuous or convolute zoning. Clinopyroxene and hornblende were also present, with fewer muscovite and biotite micas and red iron oxides. The size of the inclusions was again found to be unrelated to the wall width of the samples. The following features distinguished the individual wares within the fabric type. Later Local This ware was characterised by high percentages of fossil and other carbonate inclusions as well as abundant volcanics (o.50-2.oomm), angular-subangular, with porphyritic texture and intersertal groundmasses. Total inclusion percentages were 20-30%. Zoned amphiboles were algo present. One sample (30) had a siltier matrix and well-sorted inclusions (angular-round), 0.25mm), possibly the result of sieving, with no volcanics but small rounded micrite clasts. Late Cycladic White &amp; Fine Cycladic White (buff) 27 These samples had a slightly finer-grained matrix than Later Local and fewer overall inclusions (5-Io%), but contained relatively large (I.25-3.oomm) volcanic rock fragments, glass and tuff. The rock fragments contained hornblende phenocrysts or occasionally exhibited a radiating texture from plagioclase. Poorly sorted, rounded calcareous clasts, some with chert inclusions, were also a feature of this ware along with relatively large</page><page sequence="93">MIKRE VIGLA: A BRONZE AGE SETTLEMENT ON NAXOS 155 (I.50-3.00oomm) siltstones with euhedral feldspars. No volcanic rock fragments were noted in samples 17 and 18, but since there were no other deviations from the material profile this was felt to be the result of sampling rather than any more meaningful cause. Pale Gritty This ware contained IO-20% overall inclusions, rare volcanic rock fragments (up to 4.oomm) with phenocrysts of plagioclase and alkali feldspars in porphyritic textures. Angular to rounded discrete quartz grains (o.o5-o.25mm) were frequent along with relatively large (o.5omm) biotite and chlorite laths. Calcite inclusions were recrystallised and often sparry, and inclusions of calcareous siltstones contained angular bimodal (0o.05/0o.I5mm) quartz grains. Occasional phyllite fragments were also noted. One sample (9) had no carbonates or fossils, contained more quartz, rare radiolaria inclusions, and the volcanic rock fragments were significantly altered (argillized). Dark Burnished (light) These samples contained between 5-Io% inclusions and were distinguished by silty calcareous clasts and an absence of alkali feldspars. They also were characterised by abundant percentages of fossils and rounded carbonate (marl-micrite) impurities. Fine Cycladic White &amp; Fine Cycladic White (buff) 29 This group of samples was distinguished by an overall fine-grained profile, with Io% total inclusions and discrete angular quartz (o.25mm) occurring in moderate-abundant percen- tages. Fragments of volcanic glass and tuff were present, with one spherulite (rhyolite) of alkali feldspars and quartz. Semi-Coarse 72 Although the constituent grain-sizes of this sample were slightly larger than the other members of the overall fabric group, its inclusion profile was compatible with those of the other wares. It contained Io% overall inclusions, and some fragments of quartzite and discrete grains of strained quartz distinguished this sample. It may have been mis- identified in the field, and perhaps suggests the existence of a slightly coarser ware in this volcanic fabric. Sedimentary Fabric Group (PLATE 34a, b) This group of wares was not bound by common fabric attributes except as they represented the use of a variety of sedimentary materials and had well-compacted groundmasses. Fine Cycladic White 23 This sample contained 20-30% inclusions and was extremely calcareous with abundant microfauna. Other inclusions were mudstones with chert inclusions, detrital chert, polycrystalline quartz with strained extinction of the grains, occasional biotites and feldspars. It is possible this sample is related to the fabric of Later Local.</page><page sequence="94">156 R.L.N. BARBER and 0. HADJIANASTASIOU Fine Cycladic White (buff) 26, 28 These samples were extremely fine-grained with only around I% inclusions, and those few were mostly fine or silt-sized. Biotites, quartz, rutile and other red iron ores were the most common along with a scatter of lime. This group could be related to the Fine Cycladic White fabric and represent either a slightly finer source or different preparation of the raw paste. In the absence of more samples interpretation is risky, but since sample 29 of this ware matched the Fine Cycladic White fabric, and sample 27 showed affinities with Late Cycladic White, it can be suggested that the creation of a ware category purely on the basis of a slightly darker fired colour was perhaps premature. Dark Burnished (light) 47 This sample was also extremely fine-grained, with 3% inclusions, fine pale micas, some detrital chert, mudstones and carbonate impurities. The absence of more diagnostic inclusions may have been the result of the randomness of sampling, but without more samples it would be impossible to say if this sherd represented an alternative fabric of the ware. Red Gritty Ware The majority of these samples were characterised by relatively large (2.50-5.oomm, sub-angular-rounded) inclusions related to materials derived from a phyllitic formation in percentages of lo-20%: argillaceous siltstones, silty mudstones, quartzite-hornblende schist and serpentine. It is possible that the phyllite/siltstone inclusions were added (due to their consistent shapes/sizes and even distribution throughout the matrix), but a larger study is required to confirm this. This fabric bore some resemblance to those of Late Minoan storage vessels with material origins in central Crete.'78 Two members of this group (58, 59) contained slightly different inclusions: quartz-mica schist, chert, argillized and chloritized volcanic rock fragments, silicified argillaceous clasts and altered detrital clinopyroxenes and hornblende. While it is tempting to include these two samples with the first group of metamorphic fabrics, they are grouped with the others for the present since their material profiles were not inconsistent with sediments from a phyllite-schist source. Minoan Ware Two of these samples contained no inclusions in an extremely fine matrix, while the rest had around I-5% inclusions. Three samples contained fine biotite micas, feldspars, quartz, small percentages of carbonate and a few chert and quartz-mica schist fragments. One of these (90) also contained relatively larger biotite laths and hornblende, unusual in fine Minoan wares: A sixth sample (85) also contained clay pellets and serpentine along with biotites, feldspars, fine quartz, suggesting a possible affinity with materials from north central Crete. 78 The author is grateful to P.M. Day for this information.</page><page sequence="95">MIKRE VIGLA: A BRONZE AGE SETTLEMENT ON NAXOS 157 Mycenaean Ware Three samples of this group had no inclusions in extremely fine-grained matrix materials, while the rest had 1-5% inclusions. Two samples contained only fine quartz with strained extinction. The remaining five samples represented clays with a low-grade metamorphic origin. These sherds contained fine abundant micas (the largest of which were identified as biotite), monocrystalline quartz with strained extinction (in varying percentages), micaceous and ferruginous mudstone clasts, occasional feldspars, rare fragments of quartz-mica schist and rare carbonate impurities (fine-grained limestones, some with quartz silt). Three samples (8o, 83, 84) showed marked parallel orientation of consti- tuents, and sample 8I showed grading of inclusions with the finest nearest both surfaces. DIscussIoN In general the ware categories of the Mikre Vigla samples remained intact after material analysis with few exceptions, the Fine Cycladic White (buff) being the least convincing. In some cases individual samples within a ware showed some distinctive material features but rarely so numerous to warrant exclusion from the group without further corroboration from additional samples. However, in the cases of Red Gritty, Dark Burnished (red) and Plain Ware there were several sherds of each ware which were sufficiently distinctive to suggest the possibility of multiple fabrics for those wares. In two cases (4 Plain Ware sherds and Semi-Coarse 72) there was some indication that the samples may have been mis-identified in the field. The fabrics of the Mikre Vigla wares were characterised as belonging to three broad classes of clay materials. The first class of metamorphic-granodiorite fabrics incorporated the darker red wares, which exhibited constituent variations (probably both natural and artificial) resulting in five fabrics for the seven wares included. The second class of material (calcareous fabrics with tuffaceous-rhyodacite inclusions) incorporated seven paler wares grouped into six material fabrics. The third, a sedimentary class of ceramic fabrics, included the suspected imports (Red Gritty, Minoan and Mycenaean) and those few sherds from other wares with undiagnostic constituents. The constituent and grain-size variations within the fabric groups of each class of clay material were felt to be mainly reflections of the natural potential for variation within clay deposits. Thus fluctuations in percentages of silt or fine carbonate impurities, or different degrees of weathering of inclusions were consistent with regional variations in sediments. Preparation of the raw materials would also result in differences in grain size and the presence or absence of some larger inclusions. In addition minor variations in fabric also might be the result of chronological or functional factors affecting ceramic production. Thus, within the scope of this report, it was not possible to be more precise in interpretation of minor material variations. The metamorphic-granodiorite fabric group was compatible with the use of materials derived from the Mesozoic-Early Tertiary granodiorite formations on Naxos for the production of both fine and coarser wares. The fabrics dominated by the volcanic inclusions may have been made from materials quarried in the vicinity of Mikre Vigla where these formations outcrop. The other fabrics in this group (Red-Brown Micaceous and Hard Buff) with larger percentages of schist, phyllites and mica (and occasionally recrystallized limestone-marble fragments) may represent clays quarried further east of</page><page sequence="96">158 R.L.N. BARBER and 0. HADJIANASTASIOU the site in the contact zone between the granodiorites and schist formations, approxi- mately 2-3km. east of the site. Previous petrographic analyses of Naxian wares have produced fabrics consistent with the present results. In particular, the Semi-Coarse and Coarse fabric constituents are compatible with Pittinger's Naxian fabrics XVI (muscovite/biotite schist with granite) and XVIII (schist from the contact zone with pegmatic veins with some olivine), and the Red-Brown Micaceous Ware profile resembles her fabric X (metamorphosed limestone with calcite and pyroxenes).'79 In addition this fabric had strong petrographic affinities with Group 3 No. io (quartz diorite and micas) of Williams' suspected imported fabrics to Thera.'80 The calcareous tuffaceous-rhyodacite group of fabrics represented clays derived from formations which included volcanic glass, tuff, rhyolite, dacite and andesite rocks, such as exist on the neighbouring island of Melos. Indeed they are petrologically compatible with Williams' Melian samples (his fabric 2) from Ayia Irini on Kea,'81 and with Pittinger's Melian fabrics (especially Ia and II: plagioliparitic tuff, and andeso-dacite).182 The constituents of Pale Gritty Ware may represent clays quarried in southeast Melos which were derived from the Green Lahar outcrops which include tiny metamorphic fragments in addition to volcanic and limestone fragments. Thus the bulk of paler fine ceramics from the survey appear to have been imported to Naxos from Melos at that time. The Red Gritty Ware and Minoan Ware samples also had features compatible with previously analysed petrological material. The Minoan fine ware samples were generally compatible with the Minoan fine ware analysed by Williams from Ayia Irini on Kea.'83 Williams' samples did not include microfauna, and there were no foraminifera noted in the present samples. However, in his petrological description of Knossian fine wares, Riley mentions that his LMIa samples also did not have these fossil inclusions which are otherwise so characteristic of most Knossos fine fabrics.184 So perhaps this is more evidence for this material feature of these wares being chronologically sensitive. The presence of serpentine is also noted by Riley as a common constituent in Cretan fabrics, and he cites an area west of Knossos which could produce sediments containing phyllite-related inclusions and serpentine.'85 The Mycenaean group was also consistent in material profile with petrological samples of Mycenaean pottery studied by Riley, though he notes that the presence in such fabrics of inclusions of phyllite and schist indicate that the raw materials for the pottery did not originate in the immediate vicinity of Mycenae.'86 The area around that site is dominated by calcareous formations with marl and limestone being the most common ceramic impurity for the local clays. 179 R.E.

To a large extent the material variations followed ware designations, and in several cases the possibility of multiple fabrics for a ware were indicated (especially Dark Burnished (red) and Red Gritty). The main difference in the membership pattern of the first two material groups was that the fabrics in the first group (metamorphic/granodiorite) appeared to suggest different quarrying locations for the clays within a broad compositional profile, while the calcareous fabrics suggested the use of a remarkably uniform material type with minor variations possibly enhanced by the potters' preparations and treatment. It was also interesting to note that the examples of fabrics showing particle orientation occurred in the non- calcareous wares: all the Dark Burnished samples (except 41 from a handle), Red Brown Micaceous, Hard Buff, and some Plain Ware, Coarse Ware and Mycenaean samples. This fact may reflect the tendency to prepare the surfaces of these fabrics by scraping and smoothing for finishes which often also required rubbing, whereas the paler fabrics were not given reflective finishes, possibly due to the limitations of the clay type and/or stylistic bias. Larger material studies of these individual wares and fabrics are required to pursue these initial interpretations, refine the preliminary categories and confirm the existence of the alternate fabrics suggested by the results. In addition experimental work is in progress on the composition of some pale clays found on Naxos, and it is hoped the petrographic data from fired samples of these clays may shed some light on whether all paler fine wares were imported to Naxos during the Middle and Late Bronze Ages, or whether the some may have been locally produced.
