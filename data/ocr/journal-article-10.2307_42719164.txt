Few men were as well known as he and few have influenced the lives of so many people as profoundly as he. His theory of relativity appeared at first of interest to only a handful of specialists, but in time it came, through its application to the techniques of modern warfare, almost to stand as an arbiter of human destiny. It might, therefore, be of interest to examine into the thoughts of so great an intellect upon the greatest of all subjects: religion. What was Einstein's attitude toward religion? Albert Einstein was born of very irreligious parents and at the early age of twelve developed a vehement scepticism which stayed with him throughout his mature life. In his "Autobio- graphical Notes" He wrote: . . . there was religion, which is implanted into every child by way of the traditional education-machine. Thus I came - de- spite the fact that I was the son of entirely irreligious (Jewish) parents - to a deep religiosity, which, however, found an abrupt ending at the age of 12. Through the reading of popular scient- ific books I soon reached the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not be true. The consequence was a positively fanatic [orgy of] free-thinking Suspicion against every kind of authority grew out of this experience, a skeptical attitude. . . 305</page><page sequence="2">306 PHILIPPINE STUDIES which has never again left me, even though later on ... it lost some of its original poignancy.1 It appears that, through all the years of religious scep- ticism, Einstein never completely gave up his childhood belief in God. Thus, some forty years later, he could say: My religion consists of a humble admiration for the illimit- able superior spirit who reveals Himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble minds.2 In his maturer years this belief in God was evidently in a supreme Intelligence; - because he saw that it could not be by chance that the universe was run: "I cannot believe God plays dice with the cosmos."3 He had discovered the greatest unify- ing laws of nature, but it was only because there were already intelligent patterns ahead of him in nature. If God played dice, i.e., if the world were run by chance, there would be no ordered patterns he could trace. Neither he nor any other mind could ever discover laws, and all scientific efforts would be useless. There are however serious deficiencies in Einstein's notion of God and of religion, which it would be quite revealing to study. I will mention three. I God, as Einstein conceived Him, cannot be a God who re- wards and punishes men. Why? Because that would make God anthropomorphically cruel and malicious, since men are not free and do not do good and commit evil from free choice. God is subtle, but he is not malicious.4 I believe in Spinoza's God, who reveals himself in the har- mony of all being, not in a God who concerns himself with the fate and actions of men.5 A God who rewards and punishes is for him [the cosmic religionist] unthinkable, because man acts in accordance with an inner and outer necessity , and would, in the eyes of God, be as little responsible as an inanimate object is for the movements which it makes.6 This denial of human freedom is indeed strange in one who left his native land forever when his personal freedom was</page><page sequence="3">EINSTEIN'S COSMIC RELIGION 307 endangered, and for years enjoyed the blessings of freedom in a land of free men.7 Why so keen a mind should so definitely and unequivocably deny man's inner and outer freedom is not fully understandable to me. It is perhaps traceable to the fact that Einstein lived a relatively secluded life, far from vio- lent free acts of crime and heroism among men, and to the fact that his mind lived constantly in a universe of thought where the law of necessity was supreme - the universe of math- ematics and natural science. Thus, in the physical world, he saw the utter supremacy of law, but he could not see in the moral world the law of reward and punishment that like- wise necessarily followed goodness and crime; his reason - there is no such moral world, since there are no freely chosen acts. I hazard a guess that if Einstein had studied more of the sciences which deal with the deliberate choices of men (his- tory, sociology, politics, law, etc.), men would probably have lost some of his epoch-making discoveries, but neither would they have been misled by his denial of man's freedom, of the moral order, and of a God who controlled the free wills of men by the law of reward and punishment.8 II A second deficiency of Einstein's religion is that paradoxi- cally it is a religion in which one cannot pray. In his brief explanation of "cosmic religion,"8 he describes three stages in the evolution of religion: a) The /ear-religion of primitive peoples - who believed in and sacrificed to their god(s) out of fear that he would hurt them with disease, famine, death, drought, storms, etc. b) The social, moral religion - of Judaism, Christianity, and the oriental religions, which to keep the social unity of their peoples, preached an anthropomorphic God, a God of Pro- vidence, who rewarded and punished men for their good and evil deeds. Thus, they developed the idea of morally good and evil acts, and of a moral order. c) The cosmic religion - which is pure religion, unmixed with any human subjective motivations, and which "seeks to</page><page sequence="4">308 PHILIPPINE STUDIES experience the totality of existence as a unity full of signifi- cance/'10 Einstein describes cosmic religion further as present in all religious founders but as having no definite teachings: The religious geniuses of all times have been distinguished by this cosmic religious sense, which recognizes neither dogmas nor God made in man's image.11 ... it cannot lead to a definite conception of God...12 It is likewise strong in Buddhism,13 and especially in heretics and atheists and saints: It comes about, therefore, that precisely among the heretics of all ages we find men who were inspired by this highest reli- gious experience; often they appeared to their contemporaries as atheists, but sometimes also as saints.14 From all the above, it seems to follow that in cosmic reli- gion one can not pray , because: a) man has no freedom of will, and prayer is essentially a free act of will; b) God in cosmic religion does not "concern himself with the fate and actions of men,"15 is not a God of Providence (which Einstein expressly attributes to moral religion). How could a man feel like praying to a God who will not aid or forgive him, or hear his prayer? c) God in cosmic religion is vague and undefinable, of him we can have "no definite conception." Certainly a God whose nature fits the God of Buddhists, heretics, atheists and saints, is, to say the least, a puzzling divinity, an "unknown God." Would a man feel like praying to such a deity? This interpretation seems confirmed by Einstein's remarks elsewhere that his God is "Spinoza's God,"16 and by his im- plication that religion is reducible to painstaking scientific ef- forts or to a reverent awe of Nature: A contemporary has rightly said that the only deeply reli- gious people of our largely materialistic age are the earnest men of research.17 In every naturalist there must be a kind of religious feel- ing. . .18</page><page sequence="5">EINSTEIN'S COSMIC RELIGION 309 My religious feeling is a humble amazement at the order re- vealed in the small patch of reality to which our feeble intel- ligence is equal.19 Thus, cosmic religion is one in which we can study Nature and admire it as the revelation of God, but not one in which we can establish contact with the Author of Nature Himself and pray to Him because He has a personal interest in and special providence over us. Ill A third deficiency in Einstein's concept of religion is that (contrary to our expectations from a mind so strictly logical) religion originates from feeling and emotion , not from mind and reason. We acquire it by "experience," not by logically rea- soning to it from facts and events. This . . . cosmic religious sense ... is hard to make clear to those who do not experience* it, since it does not involve an anthropo- morphic idea of God; the individual feels the vanity of human desires and aims, and the nobility and marvelous order which are revealed in nature and in the world of thought. He feels the individual destiny as an imprisonment and seeks to experience the totality of existence as a unity full of significance.20 We do not deny the function of emotions in religion, but Einstein seems to attribute the origin of religion solely to them, i.e. to emotions without reason. Thus, his essay on "Cosmic Religion" starts: Everything that men do or think concerns the satisfaction of the needs they feel or the escape from pain. This must be kept in mind when we seek to understand spiritual or intellectual movements and the way in which they develop What, then, are the feelings and the needs which have brought mankind to religious thought and to faith in the widest sense? A moment's consideration shows that the most varied emotions stand at the cradle of religious thought and ex- perience.21 It seems obvious that in the field of religion, for some unexpressed reason, Einstein considered the scientific method of reasoning from facts as inapplicable, and its only means of knowledge to be feeling and direct experience.</page><page sequence="6">310 PHILIPPINE STUDIES In conclusion, Einstein leaves us with some very odd par- adoxes, if not with actual inconsistencies: a. that there can be religion whose God one can not pray to; b. that atheists may be the most religious of people; c. that religion may be reducible to scientific effort, i.e. to science; d. that man is not free, yet Einstein left his native land forever to preserve his own freedom. Where lies the root of these anomalies, of these subtle in- consistencies which took unawares the greatest mathematical genius of 300 years? Perhaps some answer lies in that he seemingly gave only "a moment's consideration"22 to, and did not ask himself seri- ously enough these questions: a) "Are feelings and personal experience sufficient norms for informing us on the nature of religion and of God? b) "Why cannot the strict logical reasoning from causal- ity, so successful in science and mathematics, be used in the field of religion - to discover the qualities of God and of true religion? c) "Would it not be an even greater sign of Goďs intel- ligence to create men free and yet be able to control those free wills by some superior law? Are free will and law necessarily contradictory?" Instead Einstein seems to have been influenced by the liberal Protestant atmosphere around him that religion was approached by feeling and unreasoning faith, and by the de- terminism of the physical sciences that men were determined by Nature and could in no way determine themselves. Einstein's example gives mankind these important lessons: a) on the one hand, that it is no weakness or old-fash- ioned tradition for intellectual people to admit and reverence a Supreme Intelligence that runs the universe;</page><page sequence="7">EINSTEIN'S COSMIC RELIGION 311 b) on the other, that a human genius remains ever hu- man; he may be supreme along one line, but in other fields, especially in that of religion, he may be as fallible as his next- door neighbor. * * * ll Paul A.
