<plain_text><page sequence="1">761 Presidential Address Recent Trends in Archaeology of Andhra Pradesh V. V.Krishna Sastry I Dear Delegates, 1.1 At the outset, I express my grateful thanks to the organisers and office bearers of the Indian History Congress and especially to the members of the section of the Historical Archaeology, Epigraphy and Numismatics, for having elected me as President of this section. When I was requested by the organisers of the Indian History Congress to prepare a paper on any aspect of Indian Archaeology or Epigraphy, instead of selecting a general topic. I thought it was my primary duty, as Head of Department of Archaeology &amp; Museums for over a decade to tell something about my discoveries as an archaeologist and the achievements in various facets of archaeology in Andhra Pradesh, so that the delegates would be benefited a little by knowing as to what is going on in Andhra Pradesh and in what way they could make use of it in their respective regions. Even while dealing with the recent trends in archaeology of Andhra Pradesh pertaining to different periods, I thought it would be appropriate to project the personality of the Andhra Pradesh though partially commencing from the Pre-Historic times to the early Medieval. Besides the archaeological research, I have had to devote as much attention as possible towards conservation and preservation of monuments and other researches as in the field of Epigraphy, and Salvage archaeology. In the light of the above scheme my address contains the details of Pre-History in brief mainly gathered through explorations, Proto-History through explorations and excavations and Early History mainly by excavations by me and my colleagues in the Department and in the Universalities of the State as well. 1.2 The State of Andhra Pradesh drained by such' mighty and perennial rivers like Godavari, Krishna and containing important geological rock formations right from the Archaeans to Deccan traps and covered by their consequent soils to support the vegetation was most congenial for the survival and sustenance of pre-historic man. 1.3 After the discovery of early stone age implements at Pallavaram in 1863 A.D. near Madras by Bruce Fooie,' the search for further pre-historic remains was continued bv Bland Ford.2 William King3 and others. The erstwhile department of</page><page sequence="2">762 Archaeology of Hyderabad4 noticed blades, cores and other artefacts in the Adilabad district. Subsequently Messrs. N.lssac, S.N.Rao,5 M.L.K. Murthy6 Timma Reddy7, B.R.Subramanyam,8 David Raju,9 R.V.Joshi10 and others have done extensive work in Andhra Pradesh to focus light on the pre-historic remains. 1 .4 During the recent years, I happened to notice an extensive Lower Paleolithic site at Amarabad11 in Achampet taluk of Mąhbubnagar district, on the extensions of Nallmalai hill plateau and another at Nadimipalli near the foot hills of Achampet range. Here a large number of hand axes, cleavers and factory waste were collected. During our excavations at Yeleswaram12 in Nalgonda district, a large number of Lower Paleolithic tools which included cleavers, hand axes, flakes and other waste material were collected near Madhavaswamy temple. A very prolific Upper Paleolithic site was noticed at Gundala gorge,13 over a quartzite hilll palteau from where I could collect a large number of blade cores, blades and blade tools etc. 1.5 While I was excavating Peddambur, a Megalithic site, in Mahbubnagar district I came across a skeleton of Bos Vamadicus14 in the gravel on the right bank of the river Krishna in association with Middle Paleolithic/Upper Paleolithic artefacts, which is an important event in the Indian pre-history. Later, while studying the rock paintings at Ketavaram15 in Kurnool district, I collected a large number of blade cores, blades and a few blade tools of chert, chalcedony etc. The site is bounded by caves and caverns of quartzite low hills. On the basis of these tools the rock paintings could be placed in the date frame of Upper Paleolithic-Mesolithic times. In fact several Mesolithic artefacts were found on the tops of these hills. 1.6 In course of my excavations at Peddankur in Karimnagar district, I explored, in the company of Thakur Raja, Ram Singh, several important Paleolithic and Mesolithic sites. Several Lower Paleolithic open air stations were found near Godavari Khani16 in Karimnagar district. They were all workshops from where we came across hand axes, ovates, polyhedrons, workshop waste in the form of flakes, flake blades, chips and few cleavers. One important Middle Paleolithic artefacts including scrappers, points and borders. One interesting open air Upper Paleolithic site was recently found near the local college at Godavarikhani18 which yielded both lithic blades and bone artefacts alongwith the well fossilised faunai remains of ox, buffalo, gazelle, deer, sheep, rodent, horse and dog alongwith other broviade. two important Mesolithic sites deserve mention here. One is in the vicinity of Gowrigundam19 a seasonal waterfall in the Ramgiri hill range in Karimnagar district on the top of the which there is a medieval fort. Many Mesolithic clusters are exposed here among the foot hill scrub jungle. Singh and myself have collected thousands of microlithic artefacts including a variety of backed blade tools. This seems to be a prolonged occupation seasonal camp of the Mesolithic times. on 1 .7 The second import Mesolithic site was found near Narsapalli, a hamlet of Medipalli village, around the flat sand stone bed. Many anthropomorphic rock brushings in hunting poses and holdings fishing nets were found in association</page><page sequence="3">763 with a large number of tools of geometrical designs like triangles, rectangles and projected ovates. Singh also discovered two fossiliferrous Upper Paleolithic sites in Adilabad district at the foot hills of Wakhidi21 in Boath taluk of Adilabad district. Wankhidi must have been a wòrkshop-cum-occupational site whereas the site at Manikgudem might be a way station. II New Stone Age 2.1 The presence of a great number of polished stone axes on the surface without associated habitation sites at many places was enigmatic to several archaeologists. However, during recent times archaeologists brought to light many neolithic settlements through out the length and breadth of India. The salient features of the Neolithic culture are agriculture, domestication of animals, pottery making, polishing of stone implements and in the later phase developing of metallurgy. Self protection being the main preoccupation during the Neolithic times many settlements were noticed on the saddles of foot hills. 2.2 However, 'in Andhra Pradesh some habitation sites were noticed on the plains as at Nagarjunakonda22, Gandlur23, Veerapuram24, Untoor25, Ieej26, Ramapuram27, Chinnamarur28 etc. The ecological setting during the Neolithic times may be similar to the present day arid climate characterised by thorn and scrub jungles and interspersed by grass lands. But there must have been a thicker vegetation and heavier rainfall. 2.3 At Polakonda29 in Warangal district, the Neolithic axes and adges were found over sloping plains of the south face of Peddagutta hill. The early historical site at Peddabankur30 in Karimnagar district contained a scatter of Neolithic axes indicating the presence of a Neolithic habitation disturbed during the early historical times. Neolithic axes were collected around Mesolithic sites and sometimes in the vicinity of Megalithic burials as at Devaruppula31 in Warangal district. But permanent settlements appear to be few. Neolithic settlements were noticed recently at Togarraai32 village situated on the banks of the river Maneru and Kodambapur, also on the Maneru Peddabankur, Budigapalli,33 all situated in Karimnagar district; Polakonda, Kolakonda34 and Devuruppala in Jangaon taluk of Warangal district; Chinnamarur, Karapakala,35 Ieej, Tadikonda,36 Paidigutta37, Somasila, 8 Jetprole,39 Chagatur40 in Mahbubnagar district; Hulikallu,41 Palavoy,42 Akkammakonda, tadipatri, Mudigallu in Ananthapur district43; Mylavaram in Cuddapah district; Kanigiri, Pusalapadu, Uppalapadu, Dronadula in Prakasam district44; Gandalur Godavarru, Konduru, Ponnekallu, Lam, Amravati, Chebrolu in Guntur district45; Keesarapalli, Eedara, Errupadu, Palligiri, Mogallu in Krishna district.46 Excavations of Neolithic Sites in the Past 2.4 Archaeological excavations were conducted by Dr. Allchin in 1960 at Utnoor and brought to light a Neolithic ash-mound with series of post-holes implying the existence of cattle-pens. The excavations over another ash mound site near Hulikallu, conducted bv the State Department of Archaeolociv, corroborated the</page><page sequence="4">764 evidence brought out by Allchin at Utnoor. The ash mound at Palavoy,47 excavated by Dr. Rami Reddy, also reveąled series of post-holes besides a large number of bone tools. On the basis of carbon-14 dating Prof. Rami Reddy postulated that the commencement of Iron Age in South India could be pushed back to 1180 B.C. However, Rami Reddy's date requires further corroboration. Kulikąllu excavation also yielded a good number of bone tools besides a crescentic copper blade and another double edged blade in the shape of double triangle. 2.5 The excavations at Veerapuram by Birla Archaeological and Cultural Research Institute and Ramapuram48 by the Archaeological survey of India and Gandalur49 by Nagarjuna University brought added information on the settlement pattern and daily life of the Neolithic-Chalcolithic times. Several underground pits cut into the calcite bed rock found at Gandalur in Guntur district induced the excavator to believe that they were pit dwellings. Similar pits noticed at Nagarjunakonda50 were also believed to be pits for dwelling of the Neolithic folk. But it should be considered that the scorching heat of Guntur summer would not permit any living being to dwell inside the pits. It would be reasonable to presume that the rock cut pits were utilised for underground grain storage. In that case the practice of hoarding grain might be traced from Neolithic times. 2.6 Exploratory survey conducted by the State Department of Archaeology &amp; Museums . revealed the presence of Neolithic habitation at the mouths of the caves as at Guthikonda51 in Guntur district, Belum52 and Billasargum54 in Kurnool district, Tadikonda5* in Mahbubnagar district. The Neolithic people appear to have resided near the mouths of the caves but buried their dead in far interiors of the caves. At Guthikonda human skeletal remains in association with hand made pottery, sometimes with mat impressions, and an antennae sword of copper were found at a distance of half a kilometre in the dark recess of the cave interior.- It might also attest to the practice of offering or providing weapons to the dead during the late Neolithic times, a practice that became indispensable during the Iron Age. In the Chalcolithic context at Hulikallu two thin copper blades were offered to a child burial. 2.7 As discussed above, the economic life of the Neolithic man in Andhra Pradesh differed from place to place. If it was mainly agriculture in the coastal districts of Guntur and Prakasam, there was an emphasis on animal husbandry and hunting in the districts of Kurnool, Anantapur and Mahbubnagar; while it was a combination of agriculture and hunting in Telangana districts. The identification of over 45 Neolithic-Chlacolithic sites in Guntur and Prakasams districts under the leadership of Prof. B.R. Subrahmanyam, might indicate that agricultural economy was already gaining importance and that a stage had reached when food production and supply had exceeded the actual demand. 2.8 In some South Indian sites like Tekkal lakota56 in Karnataka and Paladugu57 in Medak district of Andhra Pradesh the metallurgy of gold was mastered alongwith copper metallurgy and the knowledge of both might have ultimately lead to the discovery of iron, during the last phase of the Chalcolithic times as noticed at Palavoy.</page><page sequence="5">765 2.9 The heavy copper antennae swords58 probably intended more for ceremonial purposes than functional, were manufactured by poring molten copper through two lateral channels into the mould, probably of clay, the metal filled up into the tubular channels look like antennae after cooling and hardening. However the antennae hilt thus shaped was not quite convenient for wielding the sword. 2.10 The transition from the chalcolithic to Iron Age is noticed at Ramapuram, Chinnamarur, Veerapuram, Hulikallu and Polakonda. At chinnamarur, a Neolithic cemetery of community or fàmily burials, was noticed in a Megalithic habitation, while a Megalithic cemetery was noticed over the Neolithic habitation. Chinnamarur is an interesting site where we could notice a silent transition from Chalcolithic to Megalithic. Ill Iron Age 3.1 Iron Age was represented in South India more prominently by the Megalithic burials which are notice in many districts of Andhra Pradesh, particularly towards south of the river Godavari. Similarly no burials were so far noticed in the district of Adilabad, which is on the north of Godavari. A good number of sites have been identified in the district of Khammam by erstwhile Department of Archaeology of Hyderabad State and excavations were conducted at Janampets,59 Taigiri 6 and Hashampet.61 The Archaeological Survey of India exposed a good number of burials in the Yeleswaram63 valiey, now submerged under the Nagarjunasagar reservoir. During recent times excavations were conducted at Pochampadu 64 Kadambapur,65 Agiripalli,66 Enneru,67 Jonnawada,68 Chinnamarur,69 Peddamarur,70 Uppalapadu,71 Chagatur,72 Karapakala73 and Serupalli.74 3.2 At Pochampadu75 besides a good number of iron objects which include javelins, battle axes, strapped celts, copper hilted daggers, and a trisula and an elephant goad, stirrups and tripod stand, there were also plenty of pots of black and red ware and all black ware. The other interesting objects were terracotta figurines of deer with elongated necks, and an ivory comb underneath a skull. Kadambapur,76 an extensive megalithic burials site, situated in the Peddapalli taluk of Karimnagar district, recorded conches cut at the bottom to be used as bangles, besides two spiralled ear rings of base gold. Among the iron objects were javelins, daggers, battle axes and arrow heads. On the basis of looped card designs over some of the pots recovered from the burials, the Kadambapur Megaliths were assigned to the early phase of Iron Age. Several earthern ware legged sarcophagi were recorded from Tenneru.77 The Megalithic burial pits of Jonnawada78 were carved into the lateric bed rock. At the bottom of these pits sarcophagi containing skeletal remains were placed. The iron objects included iron tripod, trishula and lamp. The Megalithic burials at Chinnamarur79 were of primary type cist burials in which the dead body was directly placed in the cist. The burials at Peddamarur80 appear to be family types, each bigger cist chamber being transepeted into two or three compartments, and utilised for a different person, probably of the same family. The interesting finds from Peddamarur are two terracotta sarcophagi, one is boat shaped and the other fusi</page><page sequence="6">766 form pointed at both ends with a door in the middle. They were exclusively utilised for inferring infant remains. A wooden coffin was noticed at the bottom level of a pit burial at Uppalapadu.81 A terracotta figurine of a buffalo was luted to the trough shaped sarcophagus at Peddamarur. A huge transpeted burial at Chagatur8 had two stone benches inside, supported by vertical slabs. Evidently the two stone benches were intended for exposing the human dead body until the flesh was consumed by carrion eaters and insects. In order to define it as a place of exposures a 100ft x 100ft. a squarish barricade of dry masonry was built to the burial. Similar stone barricades were noticed for the menhirs at oq Valigonda in Nalgonda district. 3.3 In the light of the above discussion it is clear-Andhra Desa in particular and South India in general came under the influence of those who practised Megalithism. The Rigveda supposedly compiled during the 2nd millennium B.C. considers the burial (Anangnidagdha) and burning (Agnidagdha) as two legitimate alternative methods for the disposal of the dead. Rigveda mentions that the Pitrus who dwell in heaven are those who have been burnt by fire and those who have not been burnt (Agnidagdha and Anangnidagdha).84 The idea of burying the dead was current even before the practise of burning came into vogue. An entire hymn in Rigveda 85 describes the ritual attending to the practise of burial. Prof. Keith suggested that the literary text of Rigveda of the 10th Mandala was meant for burial only. According to Sayana,85 the commentator of Vedas, burial was an orthodox method of disposing the dead. In Atharvaveda 87 there are atleast four methods of disposing the dead viz. burying, burning, casting out (Pratopath) and exposure (Uddhitah). The practice of post cremation burial was known even to the age of Indus civilisation.88 There is an allusion in Rigveda 89 to the house of earth (bhumigiriha). In the Yajurveda there is description of a ceremony known and Pitrumedha which consisted of arranging the burnt bones of the dead in an urn to be deposited in the earth. In the Atharvaveda a coffin91 (Vrksa) is alluded to. It is a rite of collecting and depositing the bones which may be explained as a compromise between burying and burning. In Satapatha Brahmana 9 a rite is prescribed for raising a memorial to the dead which may be a menhir. Prof. Keith believes that the idea of burning to carry the soul to heaven is not vedic. In the Rigveda it is mentioned that the buried dead went to heaven quite as much as the burnt. 3.4 We find in the 10th Mandala of Rigveda 93 that a bank of earth was raised between the village and the cemetery and a circle of stones was erected for protection of the survivors. 3.5 At Urukonda94 in Mahbubnagar district a mile long barricade of earth was erected to separate the burials from the habitation. Amangal,95 also in Mahbubnagar district, contained an extensive cemetery, whereas Mangalampalli contiguous to Amangal was the habitation site of the Megalithic folk. Amangal is an inauspicious place where the dead were buried, whereas J^analampalli is an auspicious village. 06 3.6 In an Atharvaveda we find that dishes containing cakes, milk, ghee, flesh, food, honey and water were offered to the king i.e. Yama who died first of the</page><page sequence="7">767 mortals. Cakes and grains with sesame were placed on bones and corns mixed with different articles of food were placed near the bones. The articles of food, kept in different vessels were buried under the stones or bricks with the remains of dead body. According to Grihyasutra of Aswalayana,97 as soon as a man dies, a smasana should be built for him towards south-east or to the south-west of the village at a place which is inclined towards south or south-east. Kadambapur burials are situated over a site inclining towards south. 3.7 In the light of the above discussion it would be tempting and most reasonable to believe that the Megalithic burials of South India were not authored by the Dravidians as hitherto believed by many scholars but by the followers of Brahmanical religion. Many indologists have agreed that a group of Aryans followed the practice of burying the dead body and anothner group the practice of cremation. Taking the argument a little further, could we presume that the group who practised burial were the followers of Yama and those who practised cremation were the followers of Indra ? The anthropological examination of the skeletal remains98 found in the Megalithic burials revealed that they may not be assigned to a different racial family than those of the so called Aryans. 3.8 The extensive use of iron coupled with domestication of horse, used both as a draught and sacrificial animal, construction of huge lakes found invariably in the vicinity of Megalithic burials and extensive irrigation under these lakes resulted in economic prosperity and acquisition of political power which threw up community leaders who became heroes in course of time. These heroes styled themselves as Mahatalavaras and Maharathis and probably minted coins with the newly acquired titles. Under the Mauryan hegemony these petty leaders were succumbed for a while, finally paved way for the establishment of empires in South India. Probably the strongest of these petty leaders might be the founder of the Satavahana empire. IV Early History 4.1 During the post-Independence era archaeological excavations in Andhra Pradesh have been taken up at various places to throw ample light on the dark corners of Andhra history. The Archaeological Survey of India took up Nagarjunakonda as an exclusive project to light several unknown facets. For the first time it was proved that Nagarjunakonda" was not only an important Mahayana Buddhist centre but had an uninterrupted history from the prehistoric times to the medieval. Similarly the State Department of Archaeology &amp; Museum conducted excavations at Yeleswaram100 valley on the left bank under the water of Nagarjunasagar. Yeleswaram too proved to be an abode of man from the prehistoric times to the late medieval ages. 4.2 Subsequently large scale excavations have been taken up at Peddabankur,101 an early historical site in Karimnagar district, by the State Department of Archaeology. Here several Satavahana structures, such as enclosure walls, elliptical houses, brick wells, soakage pits, a covered drain etc., have come to</page><page sequence="8">768 light. Besides, several hundreds of Punch marked silver coins, more than 7,000 Satavahana coins, Roman coins and objects of iron, copper and gold of' the pre-Satavahana and Satavahana periods have been recorded. 4.3 Dhulikatta102 is another important Satavahana site excavated. The entire site was closed by a mud fortification having gateways at the cardinal directions. Excavations in the middle of the fort revealed a Satavahana palace complex with a large number of rooms, floors paved with brick and walls plastered with line. Several wells, grain storage bins were also unearthed. At a distance of one kilometre towards north of this fortification a Buddhist stupa attached with monastic cells was also exposed. On the basis of the inscriptions found on Ayaka slabs, the date of expansion of the Vedika with provision of Ayaka slabs, was assigned to 2nd century B.C. The original stupa must have been constructed atleast a hundred years earlier. 1 03 4.4 Another important Satavahana site was Kotilinga, situated between the Peddavagu, a rivulet, and the mighty river Godavari. It is the most extensive Satavahana site so far discovered in Andhra Pradesh. Several hundreds of coins of copper or potin pertaining to the regnal periods of Gobadha, Samagopa, Chimuka and Sirisata were found dn the surface, as also in the excavations, The coins of Gobadha and Samagopa104 were found at the lowest levels of occupation whereas the coins of Chimuka and Sirisata found at the upper levels, that it could deduced that Gobadha and Samagopa preceded the Satavahanas in this region. 4.5 The early historical mound at Kotilingala with a height of nearly 6 mts. above the ground level is roughly 50 hectares in extent. It is encompassed by a mud fortification with several gates opening towards cardinal points, measuring 1054 mts. long on the east-west and 333 mts. on the north-south. The height of the brick rampart was 9 mts. Several elliptical houses raised with rubble, remains of brick structures, brick wells and closed drainage were traced in the middle of the fort. Massive brick bastions over the mud rampart at the four corners is an evidence of its political importance. 4.6 Chandavaram,105 situated on the bank of the river Gundlakamma in Prakasam district is an important early Buddhist site excavated by the State Department of Archaeology, the Buddhist stupa situated over the hill known as Singarakonda, is about 4 kilometres from the village, Chandavaram. The Buddhist remains accidentally came to light when the villagers were digging out bricks for construction of their houses and in that process threw out some beautifully carved Ayaka slabs. The excavations unearthed the vestiges of a Mahastupa preserved upto the level of Harmika alongwith other such parts a Pradakshinapatha, the Vedica with Ayaka platforms set up at the four cardinal directions. 4.7 The stupa situated over the hill was approached by a flight of steps provided at the southern end. the stupa possesses an almost intact hemispherical dome (anda), over a drun (vedika), having Ayaka platforms to support Ayaka pillars, over each of them. These Ayaka platforms and pillars were possibly set up at a later period than the original stupa in order to face the gates of the</page><page sequence="9">769 Pradakshinapatha. The diametre of the stupa 's 148 feet as against Î62.7 feet at Amaravati, 148 feet at Bhattiprolu, 122 feet at Ghantasala and 106 feet at Nagarjunakonda. Like all the stupas, the one at Chandavaram too was constructed with solid brick. The dome of the stupa was 30 metre in diametre basing over , a drum that projected out 2.30 mts. to serve as a second Pradakshinapatha to which were provided at each cardinal point an Ayaka platform. Each platform is about 6mts. in length and once had Ayaka pillars, now non-existing and only vacant slots visible. These Ayaka pillars are believed to be representatives of the five important events in the life of Buddha. 4.9 Over the drum were planted huge lime stone panels of three metres height and one metre width which rested against the dome. All these dome panels, over 30, intended to be witnessed by those circumambulating the upper Pradakshinapatha, were carved in bas relief with the representation of Dharma Chakra, Bodhi Tree and the Stupa. The entire basement of the drum and facades of the Ayaka platforms were cased with the lime stone panels depicting winged animals, addorsed lions, Poornakumbha motives and a' couple worshipping Bodhi Tree. 4.9 On the northern Ayaka platform there is a panel containing the worship of the Pillar of Fire by two couples, each on one side. The right side male devotee is offering a fruit held-up in his two hands, while the lady behind him is holding up a globular vessel in her right hand and carrying a lotus flower in her left hand. The objects carried by the couple on the left of the pillar are indistinct due to the damage. This reminds the Amaravati106 panel of the same theme in which the ladies bend on the knees to touch their foreheads to floor, thereby the display of their physiognomical contours is accentuated. 4.10 In contrast, the figures on Chandavaram panel are standing in a very delicate and suppliant posture in extreme devotion. The pillar which is a symbolic representation of Buddha stands over a throne, underneath of which are depicted the Buddhapadas. Another panel depicts the episode of Nalagiri elephant which the arrogant elephant surging forward and on its way trampling some people. The mood of the fierce elephant entwining one of the legs of a man with its trunk may be contrasted with the people fleeing in terror. In the second panel the ferocious elephant turns meet like a lamb and prostrated before the Buddha who is standing with hands held in Dharmachakra mudra. 4.11 Some of the vedika panels depict the bas relief of stupa, with its vedika figures of purnaghatas and emerging foilage, the anda bedecked with festoons and the harmika in different tiers issuing forth luxurious foilage. One of the Purnaghatas depicted over the pilaster is shown over a pot-rest, out of which lotuses emerge and flow over the shoulder. Unfortunately most of the panels have been mercilessly mutilated by the ignorant local people. In one such panel the infant Siddhartha is shown over the lap of the astrologer Asita or Kondanna (Kaundinya). The depiction of the divine infant is very tender and naturalistic. 4.12 Keesaragutta is presently an important Saivite pilgrim centre situated 40 kilometres away from Hyderabad in Medieval taluk of Ranga Reddy district. Exploratory survey over the top of Keesaragutta hills revealed an extensive</page><page sequence="10">770 fortification was over the hills encompassing an approximate area of 3 square kilometres. Examination of some of the still remaining portions of the fort Wall revealed that its basement was constructed with rubble tò a width of 10 feet and the superstructure was raised with bricks measuring 50x25x8 cms. On the basis of the size of he bricks and random finds of Vishnukundin coins inside the fortification it is conjectured that the fortification was the work of Vishnukundins. The fort was provided with three main gates on the east, west and north prefaced by strategic secondary walls probably to stop direct onslaught of the enemy. Over a hill situated towards west of the Ramalingeswara temple, there are more than 70 lingas arranged in four rows with an intervening space of 10 feet. All these lingas are carved on black basalt with smoothly rounded tops (Rudra bhaga), octagonal shapes (Vishnu bhaģa) and square bottom (Brahma bhaga) installed over brick platforms. Almost every pond of water over the hill has a linga brick pedestal on one of their banks. 4.13 Excavations conducted by the State Department of Archaeology &amp; Museums revealed a square Siva temple in brick with a pedestal in the middle. The flooring inside the temple was paved with brick and a covered drain was provided at the north-east corner. The square platform raised in the middle of the shrine has a square socket for installing a linga, now missing. A running varandha existing on all the four sides outside the structure was probably separated by wooden pillars based on granite slabes. The excavation conducted at he foot of the Ramalingeswara hill revealed another brick structure with five rooms prefaced by a rectangular hall, a small porch and flight of steps. Considering the two metre breadth of the walls, it is presumed that the structure must have been a multi-storeyed building. The flat roof must have been covered with rectangular terracotta tiles and plastered with lime. Altogether 18 brick structures have been excavated. Among the minor antiquities, there are a good number of Vishnukundin coins with a squatting lion on the obverse, and a kalasa f lanked,by lamp stands on the reverse. Unfortunately, no coin bears any legend. 4.14 The other important find is a terracotta 'garbhapatra' which is globular in shape and luted with five demonical beings on the shoulder and two serpents encircling the pot at the bottom. The vessel was provided with a lid having a squatting human like figure probably representing Vastospati or Vastupurusa. The garbhapatra might represent the miniature form of Mother Earth encircled by the celestial serpents Vasuki and Agartala. The Panchabhutas, namely the earth, water, air, fire, light and ether are represented in the anthropromorphic form over the shoulder. As the garbhapatra was found at one of the corners of the antarala of a brick shrine it must evidently have been used for depositing nine varieties of gems and grains as became vogue during later times. A copper Garbhapatra was noticed just below the stupi of he sikhara in the Roopla Sangameswara temple of Rastrakuta times in Kurnool district. There are no external decorations over the copper vessel but an yantra on a gold plate, varieties of gems and a palm leaf were the contents inside. 4 1 Mention may also be made of a stone plaque on which there is a bas relief of a nude Goddess with legs flexed and stretched out. Interestingly, the Goddess carries the head of a lion in one hand and a linga in the other. A dwarfish human</page><page sequence="11">771 figure carrying a bowl is shown at the base. This is probably a unique representation manifesting the dominance of the Sakti cult at the same time counterbalancing the Vaishnava and Saiva cults, Vishnu being represented in the form of a Lion, Siva in the form of a Linga. 4.16 Among the other antiquities there is phallic shaped crystal linga, about one inch long, which was evidently intended for domestic worship. Besides there are, a small linga, a nandi and Idharapatra used for performing abhisheka, all of terracotta, a broken plaque of Mahishasura Mardini, a terracotta figure of ganesha, much damaged. These might be the earliest representations of Brahmanical faith, datable to 3rd-4th centuries A.D. The other cultural remains such as a late variety of black and red ware, sprinklers of the Roman type (found in many Satavahanas sites)107 beautiful stucco figures of the Gupta idiom, conch bangles, terracotta beads and the size of the brick utilised for construction of buildings indicate that Keesaragutta Harished contemporarily with Nagarjunakonda if not later, on the basis of Gautamiputra Satakarni it may be suggested that the Vishnukundins have succeeded the Satavahans in the Telangana region, while the Ikshvakus succeeded in the coastal region. As already stated before, no Ikshvaku coins were found in the interior Telangana, Keesaraguta assumes great importance due to the fact that the early unadulterated Brahmanical faith flourished here, while Nagarjunakonda sustained a mixed culture-in the sense that Buddhism and Brahmanism existed side by side. It may also be studied by the future historians whether Keesaragutta was the abode of Sriparvataswamy.108 who was invariably invoked in all the Vishnukundin copper plate grants. The fact that there are no early or Vishnukundin evidence at Srisailam believed to be the Sriparvata, is another corroborative evidence. 4.17 The antiquarian wealth of Keesaragutta provides a missing link between the Ikhcaku remains of Nagarjunakonda and the early Chalukyan. Further, the fortification circumscribing three square kilometres in area is probably one of the earliest hill forts in South India. 4.18 Nelakondapalli in Khammam District is believed to be the birth place of famous Bhakta Ramadas, the builder of the Rama temple at Bhadrachalam. Towards east of the present village, "there is an extensive early historical Satavahana site sprawling over an area of about 3-4 kilometres interceded by rocky patches and fertile agricultural lands. A decade ago, while widening a road near Nelakondapalii, nine stone idols of Buddha carved in the Amaravati idiom were unearthed. On the basis of the broken chips of lime stone and a cistern near the finds spot, it is presumed that the Nelakondapalli was a carving centre of Buddhist idols during the Ikshavaku times (2nd-3rd centuries A.D.). Surface explorations here yielded hundreds of Ikshavaku and Vishnukundin coins. This is an important evidence to testify suzerainty. But for Nelakondapalli in Khammam district and Yelaswaram in Nalgonda district, no other site in interior Telangana have revealed Ikhsvaku coins. 4.19 About 2 kilometres north-east of the village Nelakondapalli, a massive Buddhist stupa stands on the southern bank of huge lake. The antiquity of the lake might</page><page sequence="12">772 be traced from the pre-lkshvaku times. The excavations carried out during the recent years revealed that the stupa with a diametre of 42 mts. had five successive rims and intersected by spokes emanating from the hub. The hallow portions between the spokes and the rims were packed with earth dug out from the vicinity. The stupa was provided with Ayaka platforms at the cardinal directions and have flights of steps on the east and north. There is a 24 feet wide Pradakshinapatha around the drum. It appears that the drum and he dome of the Stupa were not decorated with Ayaka slab as in the case of other Andhra stupas but the entire structure appears to have been plastered with lime. The almost intact Buddhist Stupa with a height of 45 feet from the ground level is one of the most massive and imposing structures in Andhra. In the light of the Ikhvaky and Vishnukundin coins found in course of excavation, the date of construction of the stupa might be assigned to the 3rd century A.D. 4.20 The nine idols of Buddha that were recovered previously frrom Nelakondapalli, now exhibited from exhibited in the Victoria Jubilee Museum at Vijatawada, are in different sizes. Some of them display skillful execution of a very high order. 4.21 The minor finds Nelakondapalli included a head of an exquisiteely carved Buddha idol and a miniature stupa. The miniature stupa carved out of life stone of 1 1/2 feet has all the components such as the vedica, the anda (dome) and the hãrmica. It is interesting to note that the Vishnukundins who styled themselves as Parama Maheswaras109 must have,' out of political expediency, permitted or patronised the worship of Buddhist stupas. The importance of Nelakondapalli lies in the fact that it might have served as a halting place for the Buddhist pilgrims travelling from Vidharba-Kosala region passing through Kotilinga, on the banks of the river Godavari, Pasigoan near Kotilinga, Phanigiri, Gajulabanda, Tirumalagiri, Vardhamanpeta, Nelakondapalli and Jaggayyapet, to reach Nagarjunakonda. 4.22 Nelakondapalli is probably one of the extensive, commercial and religious centres with a strong agrarian and industrial base. Provided with a huge lake on one side and a very fertile red soil cover it might be a typical example of a highly urbanised city during the early historical times. 4.23 Bavikonda110 (hill of wells) is situated on the breach road from Vishakapatnam. The Buddhist settlement occupying an area of about 10 acres at the top of the hill over looking the Bay of Bengal commands a very picturesque view. Excavations revealed a Mahastupa having a 10 feet wide lower Pradakshnapatha, a circular drum and Ayaka platforms on four cardinal directions. There is also an upper Pradakshnapatha on the top of the circular drum or the vedika. The railing walls are badly damaged, retaining only the lower courses. The floor of the Pradakshnapatha was packed with random rubble over which a 8 cm. thick lime concrete was laid. A staircase (now missing) was provided to scale the eastern ayaka platform. Beautifully carved slabs of Buddhapadas were found in the debris of the stupa. The other important structures are two apsidal viharas, two circular chaityagrihas, one veneered with dressed stone a congregation hall, viharas, a refractory and six votive stupas.</page><page sequence="13">773 Two Roman silver coins of the periods of Tiberius and Augustus are the other important finds to fix the chronology to 1st century A.D. 4.24 The natural depression over the hill deepened for storing rain water at three places. Besides, there are two cisterns vertically scooped into the bed rock to a depth of one and half metres. Channels were cut into the cisterns to lead the rain water in. 4.25 Totlakonda is situated about 5 kilometres north-east of Bavikonda. It is another Buddhist centre perched over a sprawling plain hill and overlooking the Bay of Bengal. It lies about 25 kilometres from Vishakapatnam to Bheemunipatnam. The hill is approximately 600 feet above the coastal strip. The name Totlakonda appears to be of recent origin derived from the presence of eight rock troughs of various shapes and sizes hewn into the bed rock. Each of these troughs have flights of steps taking water out for drinking and other purposes. 4.26 The main stupa is situated over a highly elevated part of the mound towards extreme north of the site stands over a square random rubble veneered with brick. It wa provided with a pair of flights of steps on the eastern and western sides leading to the Pradakshnapatha around the vedika. The anda was built up of locally available random rubble. The entire structure from vedika to the chatra must have been plastered with lime. 4.27 Towards the north of the Mahastupa there are a series of votive stupas on a row, all veneered with dressed stones. Towards south there are tow chaityas one is apsidal and the other is circular. At the north west corner there is another stupa which might be the earliest with two ayaka platforms on the east and west. The vedika and anda are totally damaged retaining only a few courses of the vedika. Interestingly a series of sockets in stone were found on either sides of the ayaka platforms evidently intended to raise wooden posts to support a roof which sheltered the devotees to enable them to perform religious ceremonies of long duration. Towards the south of the stupa there is a circular chaitya standing over an elevated vedika. At the four corners of vedika there are four socketed stones intended for similar purpose as above. 4.28 All the above religious structures were separated by a stone railing of uprights with lenticular mortices for inserting cross bars. The uprights were decorated with makara and lotus motifs 4.29 The three wings of the monastery were constructed in the pattern of Thrisala112 architecture, the middle open space was being utilised for a congregation hall. Outside the southern monastery and towards south-east there is a refectory for cooking and serving food. The refectory was built over the bank of large tank which appears to be the main source of eater supply. Besides, there are eight rock cut troughs at different places outside the periphery of the establishment with flights of steps to get in 4.30 A good number of square and stellate stone platforms were noticed as separate units having stone paved Pradakshinapathas, on the eastern side of the mahastupa and adjacent to the alignment of votive stupas. Intact or broken Buddhapadas in different sizes were recovered during excavation here suggest</page><page sequence="14">774 that they must have been placed for worship over these raised platforms. It is to be examined whether these Buddapadas worshipped as separate units besides the Mahastupa, chaityas and votive stupas, were really Buddapadas or Acharyapadas. In that case Totlakonda might be a pontifical seat. A silver Roman coin of Augustus Caesar and a Satavahan coin reading as 'Satakanisa' will help to date the active period of the stupa to 1st century A.D. Several stucco113 decorative fragments like padmas and arsha padmas are the other finds. The monks staying at the monastery, which commands a charming view of the vast expanse of the sea, and having a salubrious climate, temperature never exceeding more than 30° celsius, even in mid summer must have spent their time studying, learning and discussing. 4.31 Recently another important Buddhist site was noticed near Gopalapatnam on the sea shore, situated about 15 kilometres from Tuni in the East Godavari district. A series of Buddhist monasteries with stupas were noticed over the tops of several hills, A minor excavation conducted near the village revealed the remains of a stupa and a monastery. The minor finds included some well preserved Vishnukundin coins. It has to be examined whether the monasteries situated over the tops of the hills with difficult assent might also have served as landmarks for the incoming ships. Similar situation of the Buddhist sites over the tops of the hills at Bavikonda and Totlakonda, overlooking the Bay of Bengal, might have served a similar purpose. V Epigraphical Research 5.1 With a view to copy and preserve lithic and copper plate records which serve an invaluable material reconstruction of history an epigraphy section was constituted in the year 1964 in the State Department of Archaeology and Museums. It was proposed to conduct village-wise survey in the different districts of Andhra Pradesh and copy all the available stone and copper plate inscriptions besides bringing out a research journal entitled "Epigraphia Andhrica" containing articles by learned scholars on various inscriptions. So far, village-wise survey for collection of inscription has been completed in 8 districts (viz.,) Cuddappah, Warangal, Kurnool, Karimnagar, Nalgonda, Mahbubnagar, Medak and Nalgonda. At present, the village wise survey for inscriptions in Nizamabad district is in progress. So far the Department has collected over 6,200 inscriptions from various district of A.P. Besides, several copper plate records obtained by the State Museum, Hyderabad, by way of purchase or as Treasure Troves have been copied. The inscriptions so far collected pertained to several dynasties that ruled over different parts of A.P. like the Satavahanas, Ikhvakus, the Vishnukundins, the Chalukyas of Vemulvada, Mudigonda, and Kalyani branches, the Kakatiyas of Warangal and Vijaynagara rulers, besides a host of several minor chiefs of local nature.</page><page sequence="15">775 Conservation of Monuments 6.1 Besides the monuments protected by the Archaeological survey of India, most of the State Departments of Archaeology have protected monuments of local importance in their respective States, as per the Acts passed by the state legislatures. There has been dissatisfaction among most of the archaeologists that all major and spectacular monuments and comparatively well preserved were taken over by the Archaeological Survey of India leaving some less important monuments to the protection of the States. It is sometimes irritating that in a connected group of monuments of the same period only the major and colossal monument was singled out and taken over by the Archaeological Survey of India leaving the insignificant and half crumbled monuments to be taken care of by the State Departments. To some extent it is true that the State Departments hitherto could not devote much attention for proper up-keep of these monuments due to paucity of funds. Unfortunately it is also the same case with some of the monuments under Archaeological Survey of India. But it should be admitted that some State Departments of Archaeology neither have sufficient funds nor trained conservation staff. 6.2 Fortunately, the State Department of Archaeology &amp; Museums of ANdhra Pradesh has an excellent record of preservation of monuments from the beginning of its inception i.e. in 1913-12 A.D. During the time of Dr. Ghulam Yazdani, the then Director of Archaeology of Hyderabad State, the outstanding monuments such as at Ajanta, Ellora, Bidar, Gulbarga, Ramappa etc. have been carefully conserved and bequeathed to the Archaeological Survey of India. After Yazdani's retirement, it appears, that the conservation and up-keep of the monuments comparatively receded to the background for another four decades. 6.3 During the recent years conservation of monuments in Andhra Pradesh received great encouragement due to the liberal grants released by the Government of Andhra Pradesh. There are over 500 protected monuments under the control of the State Department of Archaeology and Museums which include protohistoric, Buddhist, early historical sites, besides temples of Chalukyan, Rashtrakuta, Kakatiya and Vijayanagara periods, about 52 historical forts of various periods, Islamic pionuments particularly of the Qutub Shahi and Bahamani periods including mosques, tombs, dargahs, civilian buildings etc. the expenditure on conservation works is met under both plan and non-plan budgets. Several new schemes such as development of historical forts, conservation of dilapidated temples, development of Qutub Shahi and Paigah tombs have been launched recently. Under development of forts, the historical fort of Kondapalli situated near Vijayawada which played a significant role during the turbulent times of the medieval ages, the extensive Ramagiri Fort in Karimnagar District believed to have inspired Kalidasa.to compile Meghadootha and Medak Fort in Medak town are under conservation. 6.4 Most of the Kakatiya temples which contain exquisite carvings are found to be crumbling due to faulty foundations. About 47 such temples have been identified for conservations or total reconstruction if found necessary. The trikuta temple at Nagulapadu, stated to be an architectural gem of the Kakatiya times has been dismantled and reconstruction is under progress. Similarly the crumbling</page><page sequence="16">776 Kakatiya temple at Jakaram and the unique Panchakuta temple at Ramanujapuram were also dismantled for reconstruction. Another beautiful Kakatiya trikuta edifice built by Kundamamba a sister of Ganapathideva in 1169 A.D. situated at Nidikonda in Warangal district was also dismantled and reconstruction work started after laying a solid reinforced concrete foundation. The Mylareswara temple at Mylavaram dam which came under the submergence of the dam across Penna river was dismantled and reconstruction work started. 6.5 During the recent years large scale conservation of the Qutub Shahi tombs situated towards north-west of Golconda Fort has been taken up. The Qutub Shahi cemetery contains the tombs of all the 7 kings besides the royal ladies, their commanders-in-chief, their hakims and even their court dancers. Each major tomb in the complex has an adjoining mosque. A visit to the tombs complex would be beneficial for any scholar to study the architectural development during the whole range of the Qutub Shahi period from the early 16th century till the end of 17th century. Most of these monuments including the highly elevated sepulchral and ornate religious edifices have been conserved. Even a small structure was not ignored. Some of the major tombs which are as high as 170 ft. particularly those belonging to Mohammad Quii Qutub Shah, Sultan Mohammed and Hayat Bakshi Begum have been chemically cleaned by the chemical Conservation branch of the department. With the financial assistance given by the Quii Qutub Shah Urban Development Authority all the major tombs in the complex have been illuminated. After repairing the roads and pathways connecting these monuments, landscaping and laying of lawns and imbedding exotic plants the gloomy sepulchral environment was transformed into a lovely location in Hyderabad. 6.6 The other remarkable cemetery is of the Paighas who were the first nobles under the Nizams of Hyderabad. The tombs contain blend of Moghuls, Rajasthani and Assafijahi styles. The stucco ornamental work inside and outside the tombs is the finest craftmanship of local artisans. Strictly following the Islamic injunction the attempt of the artisans not to represent living beings in their natural forms but only in abstract forms is superbly achieved. The damage perpetrated to the stucco trellis work, the latticed marble rrailing around the tombs and perforated wooden doors could not be stalled due to prolonged Ilegal battle against the illegal encroachers before the monuments were protected. However, conservation work of the damaged walls, doors, ceilings, parapets, decorated columns is under completion. It is expected that within a short time the Paigah Cemetery would become another tourist attraction in Hyderabad. 6.7 Besides, the conservation of the above two groups of tombs several mosques of the Qutub Shahi period are under conservation. Particular mention may be made of the Hayat Bakshi Mosque ait Hayatnagar, wholly built of dressed masonry and attached with a caravan sarai, Kulsum Begum mosque at Kusulmpura with an imposing dome over the Mihrab, the Qutub Shahi mosque at Uppal with an elevated and lightly ornate minarettes, the spacious Musheerabad mosque, the Kairatabad mosque of pleasing proportions built by minarettes, the spacious Musheerabad mosque, the Khairatabad mosque of pleasing proportions built by</page><page sequence="17">Ill Khairtunnisa Begum another mosque built by Hayat Bakshi Begum with splendid stuccoi ornamental wofk at Golconda, the Charming mosque at Sultannagar built by Sultan Mohammed with a blend of Mughal and Qutub Shahi styles, the Badshahi Ashurkhana built by Md. Quii Qutub Shah, aesthetically decorated with Persian mosaic tiles. VII Salvage Archaeology 7.1 In India several irrigation projects were taken up to channelise the waters of the rivers and rivulets to the parching fields. These projects have brought tremendous pressure upon Indian archaeology to deviate from normal activities and to undertake salvage operations of archaeological remains to be submerged under the reservoirs. While inaugurating the centenary celebrations of Archaeological Survey of India on 14th December, 1961 Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru enunciated the future policy of the Government of India for salvaging the cultural remains in the following words : "...Some years ago a matter of conscience arose for us when we were considering what we should do about Nagarjunakonda in the south. There was this buried city gradually coming out and there was the proposal to erect a dam there and create a big reservoir which would supply water for irrigation. There was direct conflict between the claims of today in the sense of practical utility and the claims of the past. We are troubled by the conflict, but it was inevitable that we should decide ultimately in favour of the present... The old relics of Nagarjunakonda were rapidly crumbling into dust and we decided that they should be removed bodily and placed on a little islandin the middle of the lake and preserved in such a way as to prevent their decay, The present impigned upon us and ultimately forced us to give preference to a great irrigation project". 7.2 Way back in 1 960s, the Buddhist remains in Nagarjunakonda valley consisting of the Mahastupa and other 30 Buddhist establishments belonging to the Bahusrutiyas, Aparamahavinaseliyas, Chuladharmagiri, etc. besides a wealth of sculptures have been transplanted before submergence. The transplantation operations at Nagarjunakonda did not pose a big problem due to the fact that the new place of transplantation is not quite far off from the original site and the operation only involved careful dismantling and shifting of large amounts of ancient brick. Coinciding with these rescue operations at Nagarjunakonda the monuments in the Nubian valley in Egypt were being transplanted. The story of rescuing the Abu Simbel is publicised throughout the world. Appeals for salvaging the Egyptian monuments were sent all over the world and the UNESCO made herculean efforts for gathering funds and technical experts which resulted in a most spectacular and brilliant civil engineering achievement by which the rock facades and the deep shrines of Abu Simbel were bodily cut and transplanted at higher sites. About 40 countries have participated in these salvage operations.</page><page sequence="18">778 7.3 Similarly, large scale salvage operations have been undertaken in the Srisailam submergeable area exclusively by the Andhra Pradesh State Government without any technical aid from anywhere. These operations may be classified into three categories, namely i) exploration of archaeological sites and excavations of some selected sites, ii) Transplantation of architecturally and artistically important temples, and iii) Collection of loose sculptures and setting up of new museums. 7.4 Explorations and Excavations : The Krishna river known in the ancient times as Kanhabena or Krishna veni, with its major tributaries like Bhima and Tungabhadra, had sustained human civilisation for millions of years. Several prehistoric sites have been noticed on either banks of the river in the submerged area of Srisailam Dam in the districts of Kurnool and Mahboobnagar. Several Stone Age sites of the Lower, Middle and Upper Paleolithic, have been spotted at Shaikapalle, Sasanur, karapakala, Kottur, Singavaram, Uppalapadu, Kudavalli, Veerapuram. Vellala andVemylapadu in Kurnool district, Rameshwarapuram, Budidapadu, Yaparla, Vellatur, Pragatoor and Somasila in the district of Mahbubnagar. The Neolithic Chalcolithic phase was well represented at Chagatur, Chinnamarur and Veerapuram. 7.5 Several hundreds of Megalithic burials of Iron Age were noticed at Peddamarur, Chinnamarur, Uppalapadu, Gondimalla, Chagatur, Solipuram etc. displaying varieties of architectural features. Extensive Megalithic habitations were also excavated near Peddamarur and Chinnamarur. The early historical phase, coeval with the Mauryan and Satavahan periods was represented at a good number of sites. Veerapuram in Kurnool district yielded Satavahana and post Satavahana structures. At Satanikota, a Satavahana fortification was discovered. Kyatur was another early historical site datable to 1st-2nd centuries A.D. The early brick shrine of Saivite pantheon excavated at Chabolu Gummadam, Siddheswaram and Rangapuram range from 2nd to 5th centuries A.D. 7.6 The' village-wise survey for archaeological remains in the submergeable area by the State Department of Archaeology &amp; Museum and Archaeology Survey of India was started in the year 1966 and continued for a decade and resulted in the identification of 44 groups of temples as architecturally and artistically important for transplantation. The survey brought to light the existence of the following major styles of architecture in the temple construction: 1 . Those constructed in the Rashtrakuta style as noticed at Kudali Sangameswara, Rupala Sangameswara, Papanasi group at Alampur and Bhujangeswara which is an adjunct shrine to Rupala Sangameswara. 2. Temples constructed in the Western Chalukyan style namely Malleswaram, Somalsila and Pratakota etc. 3. (a) Temples constructed in the Vijaynagara style like Madanagopala at Jetprolu, Madhavaswamy at Manchalakata.</page><page sequence="19">779 (b) "temples belonging to late Vijáynagara style with a Dravidian vimana such as the Chennaķesvara at Chinnamarur. 7.7 Most of the temples out of the 44 identified groups have been transplanted except a few like those at Pratakota and Somasila. The shifting of Somasita group of temples protracted for 3 to 4 years due to administrative and technical reasons. Finally a picturesque place was selected on the outskirts of the newly rehabilitated Somasila village facing the reservoir. The construction of Papanasi group containing 22 temples at Alampur is now completed, the reconstruction of Rtipata Sangameswara temple is awaiting completion. 7.8 This is probably for the first /lime that the Government of' Andhra Pradesh have meticulously planned and executed the salvage archaeological operations on a massive scale, the entire work from identifying the temples to reinstallation at new sites, collection of loose sculptures and construction of new museums undertaken by various agencies like Archaeological &amp; Cultural Research Institute Hyderabad, Nagarjuna University facilitated by release of magnificent grants were solely due to the initiative antJ foresight of the Government of Andhra Pradesh, for which every arch ajeo log ist should be beholden. 7.9 While concluding my address, I once again thank you for giving this great opportunity to share with you some of my views and experiences.
