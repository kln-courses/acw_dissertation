Some of the more significant steps in this direction have been the publication of Trude Dothan's The Philistines and their Material Culture (Hebrew edition, 1967; English edition in press), where the then known material was assembled and discussed, and the excavations at such sites as Ashdod, Aphek, Tel Zeror, Tel Shera, Tel Sippor, Tell Eitun and Tel Batash (Timnah), which have yielded valuable new material. Tell Qasile, the site of a port town on the northern bank of the Yarkon river, has come to play an important and unique role in this research. The first excavations on the site, directed by Benjamin Mazar in 1949-51 and 1956, revealed a settlement founded by the Philistines during the 12th century B.C., and which flourished over the succeeding centuries. After the excavations were renewed there by the present author, in 1971, it was a pleasant surprise in the next season (1972) to find that our Area C coincided with the sacred area of the Philistine town. We were faced with a unique op- portunity to excavate a Philistine sanctuary which had passed through an extensive architectural history. By the time our excavations had come to a close, in 1974, we had revealed three successive temples with their associated courtyards and in- stallations. The architectural remains, and the large quantities of cult objects, small finds and pottery, mostly discovered in clear stratigraphie contexts, represent a most significant contribution to the study of a period often regarded as a "dark age" over broad areas of the ancient Near East. Publication of our excavation report in this Qedem series has necessitated the division of our material into two parts. The present volume presents and discusses the architecture and the cult objects, while a subsequent volume will treat the other small finds and the pottery, as well as the chronological, cultural and historical conclusions. The fact that the Tell Qasile sanctuary is the only temple which can clearly be attributed to the culture of the "Sea Peoples" has called for a broad research in order to define the various cultural traditions reflected on the site. In the comparative discussions, therefore, I have sought to trace all possible con- nections with the Aegean, Cypriote, Egyptian and Canaanite traditions. Since these are the principal elements of the eclectic Philistine pottery, it was essential to determine the extent to which they are also reflected in the other finds on the site. The discussion in Chapter Ten is largely based on an extensive study of the results of the previous ex- cavations at Tell Qasile. This study was enabled by Professor B. Mazar who submitted me for study the plans, photographs and diaries of these excavations. Hopefully, this material will be published in a future volume. I wish to thank all those who aided in organizing the excavations, especially the staff members, during both the excavations and the preparation of this publication. Professor B. Mazar, who conducted the first four seasons at Tell Qasile, was ever helpful, with invaluable advice and suggestions throughout the work. Professor Y. Yadin, then Head of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University, and Professor Trude Dothan, jointly guided me through the preparation of my Ph.D. thesis, on which this report is largely based. To these three of my teachers I must express deep gratitude. Mr. J. Aviram, Director of the Institute of Archaeology, aided in organizing the expedition and, especially, the publication of the results. The late Mr. Y. Rabinowitz, then Mayor of Tel Aviv-Jaffa, kindly helped in raising the essential funds for the project. Much assistance was also received from the Museum Haaretz, its then directors (the late B. Z. Kadouri and Mr. J. L. Prag) and its staff, especially A. Kindler, Uzza Zevulun, M. Megiddon and A. Yosef. The entire expedition and technical staff is listed below, in Chapter One, but especial contributions 1</page><page sequence="7">were made by the following in the preparation of the present volume: Margalit Eichelberg and Esther Huber-Harel (drawings of the cult objects); Y. PortugƒÅli (first draft of plans and reconstructions); L. Ritmeyer (final drawings of plans and reconstruc- tions); A. Glick, A. Hai and Z. Radovan (pho- tographs). I was invaluably assisted by Tessa Mindel in preparing the English translation, R. Graf- man kindly edited the manuscript, E. Jacob has ably seen the volume through the press and Miss. Hanna Katzenstein devoted important suggestions in the final stages of publication. To all, once again, I am most grateful. October 1980 Amihai Mazar 2</page><page sequence="8">CHAPTER ONE THE SITE AND ITS EXPLORATION THE SITE Tell Q asile1 is situated at the southwest corner of a kurkar ridge, 250 m north of the present course of the Yarkon river, and about 2 km east of the Mediterranean coast (Pl. 1 : 1). On the north, west and south, the mound is surrounded by plains, while on the east a small ravine separates it from the continuation of the ridge toward the east and northeast. The top of the hill is 26 m above sea-level. On the south and east, slopes are steep, while on the west and north they are very gradual. The ancient remains are found above the 18 m contour on the west side, and above the 22 m contour on the south and east. The original area of the ancient site was approximately 16 dunams (4 acres), yet due to natural erosion and human activity the margins of the site were damaged, and the area of the site now is approximately 13 dunams (see Figs. 1, 17 and p. 7 below). Fig. 1. Map of sites along the Yarkon River. 3</page><page sequence="9">CHAPTER ONE NATURAL RESOURCES In the introduction to the preliminary report on the first two seasons of excavations at Tell Qasile, B. Mazar described in detail the natural conditions and economic background of the site: "The single fact that, on the kurkar ridge overlooking the plain of the Yarkon, there existed for many generations a good-sized and flourishing settlement, strengthens the assumption that the river constituted the main factor in the economics of the settlers: it would appear that, by using the waters of the Yarkon for irrigation, they were able to maintain a high standard of agriculture, as witnessed by the grain pits, silos, stores for wine and oil, and fruit presses which were found mainly in the strata of the Iron Age. It should also be mentioned that even in the lowest stratum (XII) farming tools, including many flint sickle-blades, were found in great numbers. Moreover, we see from an archaeological conspectus of Tell Qasile that, apart from farming, industries and exports were important factors in the life of the settlement. It is therefore reasonable to infer that the site was used at various times as a sheltered port on the north bank of the Yarkon, similar to those found near the mouths or the deep waters of other streams of this country: thus ships sailing along the coast would make their way through the estuary of the Yarkon and anchor in the deep waters near Tell Qasile, the more so as the sand banks in the estuary were, in those days, less numerous than they now are. In view of this assumption, one can understand the story told about the cedar trees of the Lebanon, being brought in floats by sea to Joppa in the days of King Solomon and of Zerubbabel, Governor of Judah, to be forwarded from there to Jerusalem [2 Chronicles 2, 16; Ezra 3:7]. In the light of the archaeological discoveries at Tell Qasile, the settlement must have reached a high standard of development in the 10th century B.C. and in the Persian period... It appears that the trees were brought 'in floats' to the Yarkon to be unloaded on the northern bank of the river near Tell Qasile, and then transported by land to Jerusalem."2 To this description we can only add two details: the water supply of the settlement could have been based on wells sunk into the underground water level. A square well of the Persian period was cleared in 1971; it was cut into the kurkar to a level of 1 m above sea-level, where traces of silt were found. 4 Another well, dug during the Middle Ages (Mam- luk?) to a depth of approximately 23 m, was found in our Area C. In the Iron Age I, too, such wells probably solved the problem of water supply, although none have as yet been found. We may also assume that the flatlands along the banks of the Yarkon were marshy. Hippopotamus bones found in the excavations may be indicative of this. Marshes were a well known feature along the banks of the Yarkon river until the beginning of this century. THE EXCAVATIONS Following the discovery of two Hebrew ostraca on the surface of the site, B. Mazar directed four seasons of excavations there. The result of the first two seasons, during 1949, were published in an extensive preliminary report.3 In the third season, in 1950, the southern area of excavations (Area A) was extended and a row of buildings, belonging to Strata X-VIII, were exposed (Buildings O, W, Z). The fourth season, in 1959, furthered exploration of the western area (Area B), the excavation of which had commenced in the first seasons. In 1962-63, small- scale probes were made in the southern area, under the supervision of B. Mazar and I. Dunayevski.4 The renewed excavations at Tell Qasile, under the direction of the author, were sponsored by Museum Haaretz, the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University, and the Israel Exploration Society; financial assistance came from the Municipality of Tel-Aviv-Jaffa. Four seasons of excavations were conducted, as follows: June 1971 - salvage excavation of the Persian well, north of the mound; August 1971 - a two- week sounding on the mound, carried out as an educational project for students of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University. During the first week the eastern end of the southern area (Area A) was examined and found largely to be destroyed by erosion. During the second week the excavation of Area C began with a sounding in Squares 74 A4, 75 Al and 65 Dl, in which thick brick walls, later proved to be part of the Philistine temple, were discovered just below sur- face.5 June-September 1972 - Area C was extended to 500 sq. m. The discovery of Temple 131 (Stratum X) stood at the center of this season. Favissa 125, parts of the temple courtyards and parts of a Byzantine bath-house were also excavated.6 July-August 1973 - The area was extended to</page><page sequence="10">THE SITE AND ITS EXPLORATION 850 sq. m, and excavations reached bedrock. Further parts of the sanctuary of Stratum X were exposed, and a large dwelling was excavated south of it. The focal point of this season's excavations was the discovery of the temple of Stratum XI, and a small shrine, which existed during Strata XI-X, west of the main temples. Summer 1974 - the excavation was deepened to bedrock in many places and the temple of Stratum XII, the earliest one at the site, was exposed.7 STAFF AND MANPOWER During the excavations, the author was greatly assisted by Messrs. M. Megiddon and A. Yosep, who saw to administration and general supervision on the site. The staff during the several seasons included: 1971 - Dr. E. Netzer (architect), I. Eisenberg, Y. Baumgarten, and the late Z. Ben-Zvi; 1972 - Dr. E. Netzer (architect), Z. Maoz (surveyor), the late Z. Ben-Zvi, Pamela Ullman, Hannah Fr√∂hlich, Y. Baumgarten, S. Yankelevitch, Y. Levi, D. Ziffer, Sarah Hofri, and E. Lass (most of whom were students at the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University); 1973 - Bracha Goz, Hannah Fr√∂hlich, Osnat Mish, D. Altman, S. Kochavi, E. Lass, Y. Levi and S. Yankelevitch; 1974 - Pamela Ullman, E. Lass, Y. Levi and Y. PortugƒÅli (architect). The technical staff in all seasons included: A. Hai, Z. Radovan and A. Glick (photographers); Gina Golan, Yael Marks, Deborah Netzer and Lisah Hanninan (pottery restoration); Alina Friedlander, Esther Huber-Harel, Hannah Ochion, Sally Borsch (pottery drawing); Bracha Goz and Pamela Ullman (pottery registration and publication assistants); Dr. Y. PortugƒÅli and Dr. E. Netzer (plans and isometric reconstructions); L. Ritmeyer (final drafting of plans ! and reconstructions). The cult objects were drawn by | Margalit Eichelberg and Esther Huber-Harel. ƒº Much of the labour was carried out by groups of volunteers, including students from the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University (1972) and students from the American Institute of Holy Land Studies in Jerusalem (1972-73). AREAS OF EXCAVATION The three major areas of excavations on the site have been denoted as follows: Area A: On the southern part of the mound, excavated in 1949-50 (Squares 33-35 and 43-45), covering 1400 sq. m. Area B : A long, narrow area encompassing Squares 51, 61, 70 and 71 excavated in 1949-50; a stepped trench was excavated in 1959 in the northern part of this area (Squares 80-81). The general area ex- cavated is 300 sq. m. Area C : The sacred area, excavated during the years 1971-74 (Squares 75, 65, 74, 64), covering an area of 850 sq. m. The entire area excavated at Tell Qasile totals 2,550 sq. m., i.e., 16% of the ancient settlement. During the various seasons, accidental discoveries led to the excavation of several installations and tombs around the mound; three Iron Age rock cuttings were mentioned in the preliminary report of the first two seasons, and in 1973 two additional Iron Age II rock cuts were excavated, near the western edge of the mound. The Persian well mentioned above was another chance discovery near the edge of the mound. TOPOGRAPHY OF THE MOUND The topography of Tell Qasile is an important factor for understanding the character of the settlement and its stratigraphy. The process of erosion has led to a shape somewhat different from the original topography of the mound. The natural hill was an asymmetrical ridge: the western slope is long and gradual, while the eastern slope is short and steep. Excavations in the various areas have shown that the ancient settlement was built up only on the western slope, while the steep eastern slope remained outside the boundaries of the settlement. Thus, the picture conjured is one of a settlement built up on the slope facing the sea. The gradient of the slope can be calculated according to data published by B. Mazar,8 supplemented by the following data from Area C: Distance Line of Line of between points Difference Gradient measurement squares of measurement in height East-west 64-74c 27 m 2.00 m 7.7% North-south 65-75-1 17 m 0.80 m 4.7% North-south 64-75-3 15 m 1.15 m 7.6% 5</page><page sequence="11">CHAPTER ONE Fig. 2. Contour map of Tell Qasile, with location of excavated areas. Fig. 3. Schematic section of the Tell, from east to west, looking north. The natural slope is therefore of 5-7% (3¬∞-4¬∞). This slope led to differences between the floor levels of adjoining buildings. It can be assumed that for every 10 m in length there is a difference in level of 0.50-0.70 m in the floors of buildings of the same stratum. Naturally, the differences will be only slight within one building unit and greater between neighbouring architectural units. This basic factor is 6</page><page sequence="12">THE SITE AND ITS EXPLORATION most important in the analysis of the stratigraphy in the various areas at Tell Qasile. EROSION AND DISTURBANCES The mound has been greatly affected over the centuries by natural erosion as well as by the removal of the rich soil by local peasants. As a result, various strata are exposed at different levels. The buildings of the later strata (Strata VI-I) can be found above the 24 m contour, and below this level earlier Iron Age strata are gradually and successively exposed. In Area A the natural rock was found along the 22 m contour, and Iron Age I remains were found only above that level. In Area B ancient building remains are found up to the 16-17 m contour, while on the eastern side of the mound ancient remains disappear along the 23 m contour (in Area A) and along the 21 m contour (in Area C). On the northern side, erosion has probably destroyed all the remains below the 17-20 m contours. The present measurements of the mound are 110 m from east to west and 120 m from north to south, giving a total area of 13 dunams (3.2 acres). A reconstruction of the original size of the settlement, based on the ancient topography of the hill, shows that its original area was about 16 dunams (4 acres; see Fig. 17). The erosion was most severe near the summit, on the eastern side of the mound. In Area C the results of this erosion are clearly apparent. On the eastern side of this area, the ancient building remains were almost completely annihilated, and bedrock was exposed 0.50 m below the surface. On the other hand, at the western end of the same area, 30 m to the west, the accumulation of the ancient strata reaches a depth of 4 m. Thus, the present surface of the mound on the eastern side of Area C slopes to the east, while the natural bedrock slopes in the opposite direction (see Fig. 3). The erosion determined the line of preservation of the various strata. At the eastern end of Area C, for example, Stratum XII remains can be found immediately below the surface, while as one proceeds westward, Strata XI- VIII remains are to be found, too, because of less severe erosion there. The top layers of Area C were disturbed by erosion and by late construction (see Fig. 53, p. 145). In its eastern part, Strata XII-XI remains were found just below the surface. At its western end, the building of a Byzantine bath-house destroyed the Strata IX- VIII remains. A late trench passed through the southern part of the area, destroying parts of Iron Age buildings. A well, of the Middle Ages (Locus 165), damaged part of the southern walls of the temples. In the southeastern corner of the area, large pits had been dug in the Middle Ages, while at its northwestern corner, pits had been dug in the Persian period. All these caused damage to the Iron Age I strata in various places. Yet, fortunately, the temples and most of the other Strata XII-X structures were almost undisturbed, though those of Strata IX- VIII were found in a bad state of preservation. METHODS OF EXCAVATION AND REGISTRATION The Grid In the first season of excavations, in 1949, the mound was divided into a grid of large squares (20 X 20 m). Each square was given a number and was sub-divided into sixteen smaller squares (5x5 m). Within each large square, the smaller squares were denoted from south to north (A-D) and west to east (1-4). Thus, each smaller square is denoted according to its large square and its own position within the larger square, e.g., Square 45 Al.9 This method, though somewhat cumbersome, has been retained in the renewed excavations. Registration The method of registration employed in the renewed excavations is that current in Israeli archaeology,10 in which three series of numbers are used: locus numbers (at Tell Qasile, Area C: 101-333); wall numbers (501-622) and basket numbers (1001-3860). The locus numbers were allocated daily to each defined locus, and comprised clearly-defined floors, rooms (or partly excavated rooms), installations, various types of earth layers, etc. Each architectural unit was denoted after one of its main loci; the latter number is underlined in the final plans. Wall numbers were also allocated daily whenever new walls were discovered. Basket num- bers were given to each basket of sherds col- lected in a particular locus during a day (or part of a day). Baskets were changed whenever a new stratigraphie feature appeared. The sherds collected in the baskets were sorted, marked with sub-numbers and either sent for restoration or for further typological study. Separate basket numbers were also given to special finds. The three series of numbers were allocated daily, in continuous order, and recorded in a "graphic basket list" in which the location of each basket was noted by number, along with a listing of full details including its square, locus, 7</page><page sequence="13">CHAPTER ONE level, contents and stratigraphie position. The description of each locus, including a corresponding list of baskets, was recorded on a specific "locus card". This method was found to be efficient, enabling the accurate attribution of the individual finds to their respective stratigraphical contexts. Excavation Policy Our policy during the excavations of Area C in 1971-1974 was to employ the Wheeler-Kenyon method of excavation within a large and continuous area. Thus, while the stratigraphy in each of the smaller squares was determined accurately by close observation of the sections in the baulks, our main goal was to reveal as much as possible of the architecture of the site. Thus, whenever possible, an architectural unit was excavated as a whole, and only then did work penetrate into the subsequent, lower stratum. When two sections of the same floor within a clearly defined room were found flanking a baulk, the latter, after recording, was removed so as to reveal a full picture of the architectural unit. On the other hand, in open areas, such as streets and courtyards, baulks were not removed, to facilitate a continuous study of the rather more complicated stratigraphy of such areas. Since the preparatory imposition of a grid upon a site does not necessarily correspond with the orientation of its buildings, we occasionally found it expedient, in the lower levels, to mark new sections and baulks on new lines, corresponding to the orientation of the structures being revealed. The drawings of many baulks and minor sections have been combined into eight major sections (A-A- H- H), in accord with the orientation of the buildings (see plan, Fig. 54). Thus, a synthesis of two concepts has been obtained: the "architectural" concept, which tends, toward the exposing of large areas in which the architectural layout of a site can be studied, and the "vertical" concept which favours the stratigraphical study of a site by accurate observation of the accumulation of the various layers of earth in each stratum.11 8</page><page sequence="14">CHAPTER TWO CORRELATION OF THE STRATIGRAPHY OF TELL QASILE RESULTS OF PREVIOUS EXCAVATIONS Following the first two seasons of excavations in 1949, Prof. B. Mazar established the following stratigraphical and chronological division:1 I Arab period (including Mamluk) II 1 j I 2 Byzantine period (4th-6th centuries A.D.) III Late Roman period (3rd-4th centuries A.D.) IV Early Roman period (Herodian dynasty, 1st century B.C.- 1st century A.D.) V Hellenistic period (3rd- 1st centuries B.C.) VI Persian period (Post-exilic, 5th-4th cen- turies B.C.) VII 1 Middle Iron Age II (House of Jehu and end VII 2 of Kingdom of Israel, 8th century to 732 B.C.) VIII Middle Iron Age I (House of Omri, 9th century B.C.) IX 1 Early Iron Age III (United Kingdom, 10th IX 2 century B.C.) X Early Iron Age lib (pre-Israelite period in Tell Qasile, end of 1 1th century and beginning of 10th century B.C.) XI Early Iron Age Ha (Philistine period, end of XII 12th and 11th centuries B.C.) The sub-division of the Iron Age in this table is that used in the original publication, written in 1951, and which corresponds with that suggested by W.F. Albright. Meanwhile, various other sub-divisions of the period have been suggested in various publications, and much confusion has risen. In the present publication we used a very general sub-division, as follows: Iron Age I: 1200-1000 B.C.; Iron Age II: 1000-587 B.C. Whenever a more detailed terminology is required, we refer to centuries, or parts of centuries B.C. The results of the renewed excavations in Area C raised several problems in correlating them with this sub-division, which was based on excavations in Area A. A further study of the plans and records of Area A prompted us to suggest certain corrections in the interpretation of the stratigraphy and chronology of Strata IX- VII. In the following notes, the stratigraphy of the site is briefly summarised, and our proposals concerning the correlation of the stratigraphy of Areas A and C are laid out. (A detailed discussion of the chron- ological, historical and cultural background of each of the strata will appear in Part Two.) THE CANNANITE PERIOD In the excavations of Areas B and C, a few sherds dated to the Middle Bronze Age II period were discovered on bedrock; these were not given a separate stratum number. Some of the sherds in Area C could be dated to the Middle Bronze Age IIA period, and they may be indicative of a semi-nomadic occupation, similar to that discovered by J. Kaplan at nearby Sede-Dov.2 Some Middle Bronze Age lib tombs were excavated east and west of the mound; however, no occupation remains from this period were found on the mound itself. Throughout the Canaanite period Tell Qasile remained a natural, unoccupied hill. The Canaanite settlement along the Yarkon basin was concentrated on the two large mounds of Tel Aphek (near the sources of the river) and Tel Grisa (Tell Jerishe, on the southern bank, opposite Tell Qasile).3 While Aphek had guarded the main land route connecting the northern and southern parts of the country, Tell Grisa served as an important Canaanite port, utilising the river for anchorage. Further south, Jaffa served as the main sea port along the coast during the Middle and Late Bronze Ages. THE IRON AGE I PERIOD: STRATA XII-X The excavations at Tel Aphek, Tel Grisa and Jaffa have shown that all three sites were destroyed toward the end of the Late Bronze Age. While Philistine pottery was found in pits and occupation layers, overlying the Late Bronze Age destruction layers, it 9</page><page sequence="15">CHAPTER TWO would seem that at all three sites the 12th- 11th centuries B.C. were a period of relative decline. The foundation of a town at Tell Qasile during the 12th century B.C., and its vivid development during the succeeding century, would point to its having in- herited the roles of Jaffa and Tell Grisa as the main port in this region at the time. Thus, we can see here a dynamic process of change in the relative im- portance of sites within a single region, involving the phenomenon of the foundation of new settlements by new settlers. Stratum XII at Tell Qasile represents the earliest phase of Philistine occupation of the site. In Area A, only a few building remains could be discerned and most of the remains consisted of an accumulation of earth layers on bedrock, containing sherds of the second half of the 12th century B.C. On the other hand, in Area C substantial building remains from this stratum were discovered. As will be shown in the next chapter, two phases of this stratum could be observed in certain locations in Area C. Sections of floors found on bedrock could be attributed to the earliest phase of the stratum (termed "XIIB"). Decorated Philistine sherds were found on these earliest floors. However, most of the building remains in Area C, including Temple 319, can be ascribed either to the second and main phase of Stratum XII, or to Stratum XII as a whole. In this report, this principal phase is termed simply Stratum XII. Stratum XI represents the erection of new buildings in Areas A and C. In Area A some of the buildings which could be clearly attributed to Stratum X were probably founded already in Stratum XI, though this process is as yet unclear in some of the buildings. Although new buildings, including a new temple, were erected in Area C, there was no radical change in the basic layout of the area. The inhabitants in this stratum were probably the descendants of the Philistines who founded the settlement in the mid- 12th century B.C. Only one building phase could be attributed to Stratum XI in Areas A and C, yet in the courtyard of the temple of Stratum XI the floor was found to have been raised once or twice. In these specific places, the various floors were termed XIa, Xlb, XIc respectively. Stratum X is characterized in both Areas A and C by the heavy fire which led to its destruction. Numerous restorable pottery vessels were found on the floors of this stratum, as well as a large number of other artifacts. The heavy destruction layer is clearly visible and thus forms a key to the 10 understanding of the stratigraphy of the site. The fact that no typical decorated Philistine vessels were found during the first seasons of excavations in Area A led B. Mazar to term this stratum as "Late Philistine" or "Pre-Israelite", and he dated it to the end of the 1 1th century and the beginning of the 10th century B.C.4 The violent destruction of the stratum, according to him, represented the conquest of the region by King David.5 Trude Dothan, on the basis of the characteristic decorated pottery of Stratum X, related this stratum to her third phase of the Philistine culture, which she places in the second half of the 1 1th century B.C.6 As seen in Part Two, a good number of well-decorated Philistine vessels came to light in the various buildings of Stratum X in Area C. This is clearly in contrast to Area A, where such vessels were not found in Stratum X buildings. The finds from Area C lead us to conclude that decorated Philistine pottery was still produced during the time span of Stratum X, and that its absence in Area A is due to social or ethnic differentiation between the two areas. We shall return to this problem in Part Two. In most of the excavated area, only one building phase of Stratum X could be identified. However, in several places in Areas A and C (Building J in Area A, and Building 225 in Area C), architectural alterations were evident during the time of Stratum X. These have not been designated by separate stratum or phase numbers, since they were not a general feature. The absolute chronology of Strata XII-X, as determined by B. Mazar in 1949, remains valid. THE TENTH CENTURY B.C.: STRATA IX-VIII Stratum IX, dated to the 10th century B.C., was divided by B. Mazar into two sub-phases, IX 1 and 1X2. This division was based on the stratigraphy of Buildings J and K in Area A, excavated in 1949. However, no such sub-division could be observed in Buildings W and O, excavated in the subsequent season (1950). In Area C, two floor raisings could be observed in the open areas of Stratum IX, yet no sub-phases were found within the structures of this stratum there. Therefore, the sub-division of Stratum IX into two phases should not be regarded as a general phenomenon throughout the site, but rather as isolated repairs in particular buildings and courtyards. The pottery finds from Stratum IX are characteristic of the 10th century B.C.; yet, while B. Mazar dated the stratum to the entire century, we</page><page sequence="16">CORRELATION OF THE STRATIGRAPHY OF TELL QASILE prefer to restrict it to the first half of the century. No decorated Philistine pottery was found in Stratum IX and this fact, as well as the architectural modifications in Area A, led B. Mazar to assume that Stratum IX was built up by Israelite settlers under David and Solomon. This ethnic identification can also be challenged. In Area C, the temple of Stratum X was rebuilt in Stratum IX, a fact indicating a continuation of cultic traditions on the site in Stratum IX. This phenomenon contradicts any radical ethnic change in the population, and we therefore conclude that, following the heavy de- struction at the beginning of the 10th century B.C., the site was rebuilt by its former inhabitants or their descendants, now under the rule of the United Kingdom of Israel. The violent destruction of Stratum IX is represented by an ash layer in Buildings J and K, and by a layer of debris with pottery vessels in situ on the floors, in the southern part of Area C (this destruction layer was, however, not found in every building of this stratum). Stratum VIII represents repairs of buildings of the previous stratum, and underwent no radical changes. The building remains and finds were scarce, yet they indicate a continuation from the previous stratum. The pottery was attributed by B. Mazar to the 9th century B.C., yet (as is shown in Part Two, in a typological discussion of the pottery) this date is too low. Both the pottery of Stratum VIII from Area A, partly published in the preliminary reports, as well as the pottery which could be attributed to this stratum in Area C, are, according to our conclusions, no later than the late lOth-early 9th centuries B.C. Thus, we suggest ascribing Stratum VIII to the second half of the 10th century B.C. It is very likely that this stratum was destroyed by Pharaoh Shishak, re- turning to Egypt along the Coastal Plain. Another possibility to be taken into account is that Stratum IX was the town razed by Shishak, while Stratum VIII represents a rebuilding of short duration, late in the 10th century or the early 9th century B.C. The scanty pottery finds preclude a more precise dating. AN OCCUPATIONAL GAP A more radical change in the correlation between the stratigraphy of Area A and that of Area C concerns Stratum VII. B. Mazar attributed to Stratum VII fragmentary structures discovered above Public Building L in Area A; these contained pottery which was dated to the 8th century B.C.7 However, on the basis of our present knowledge, the published pottery from this stratum cannot be dated to later than the 10th century B.C.8 A new analysis of the stra- tigraphy of Area A, which is to be presented in a later volume, shows that the relative stratigraphy of this area should be differently interpreted, and that the poor remains which were attributed to Stratum VII may well be part of the Stratum VIII complex. In Area C only two major strata (IX and VIII) follow the destruction of Stratum X, and both can be dated to the 10th century B.C. We therefore suggest that following the destruction of Stratum VIII, toward the end of the 10th century B.C., the site was abandoned for several centuries. THE SEVENTH CENTURY B.C. In Area C a period which had not previously been identified at Tell Qasile was observed for the first time. The evidence includes sherds of the very end of the Iron Age, found in unstratified wash layers of earth, lacking any architectural remains, overlying the remains of the earlier strata. In one of two rock- cuttings west of the mound, there was a group of vessels of this same period. The newly recognized occupation phase, probably of short duration, has been termed "Stratum VII", yet it should not be equated with the remains attributed to Stratum VII on the mound in Area A. Thus, we may present the following chronological table for the Iron Age strata in Tell Qasile: "Stratum VII" Last phase of Iron Age (Late 7th-early 6th century B.C.). Occupational gap Stratum VIII Second half of 10th century B.C. Stratum IX First half of 10th century B.C. (divided into two phases in certain buildings). Stratum X Third Philistine town, ca. 1050-980 B.C. Stratum XI Second Philistine town, ca. 1100-1050 B.C. (including two floor phases in courtyards). Stratum XII First Philistine town, ca. 1150-1100 B.C. Stratum Scanty remains of earliest "XIIB" Philistine occupation, ca. 1150 B.C. 11</page><page sequence="17">CHAPTER TWO STRATA VI-I In Area A a large building of the Persian period was attributed to Stratum VI. The period is represented in Area C only by several pits. Strata V- III were hardly represented in Area C ; only one pit contained pottery of the Early Roman period (Stratum IV). It seems that during the Hellenistic-Roman periods only a few buildings existed atop the mound, while the rest of its area remained unsettled. Remains of a large bath-house, of the Byzantine period (Stratum II), were discovered in the western part of Area C; the remains extend beyond the limits of the excavated area. Byzantine buildings and in- stallations were also uncovered in Area A, as well as in various places in the vicinity of the mound. The most important of these is the synagogue, used by either Jews or Samaritans, found close to the north eastern corner of Tell Qasile.9 The Arab and Mamluk periods (Stratum I) are represented in Area C by a well and a few walls and pits found nearby. Thus, in principle, the stratigraphie framework established by B. Mazar in 1949 has proved ap- propriate, though some revisions concerning Strata IX-VII had to be made in the light of the re- newed excavations. 12</page><page sequence="18">CHAPTER THREE STRATUM XII: THE EARLIEST PHILISTINE SANCTUARY (Plan: Fig. 48, p. 140; Schematic plan: Fig. 4) The main structure of Stratum XII is Temple 319, which was exposed in the center of Area C, below the later temples. Around the temple, extensive parts of a courtyard and structures were uncovered. These could easily be excavated in the eastern part of Area C, where bedrock is high and the later strata had been destroyed by erosion. In the western part of the area, however, structures of Stratum XII were exposed only in rather small trial pits. In several places remains of floors, predating the main struc- tures of Stratum XII, were discovered. These have been termed Stratum "XIIB". The structures of Stratum XII are divided into the following units: (1) Remains of Stratum "XIIB"; (2) Temple 139; (3) Courtyard 110; (4) Room 314; (5) Remains, northwest and west of the temple; (6) Remains in the southeast corner of Area C; (7) Building 221. STRATUM "XIIB" In the area of Temple 319, clear remains of an occupation level were uncovered, predating the actual building of the temple. A lime floor (Locus 321), descending to the west, was discovered below the foundations of Wall 584, and 0.15 m below the floor of the temple (see Section A- A and PI. 3: 1, left). The floor is built directly upon bedrock. A number of sherds, including two Philistine sherds decorated with spirals, were found on the floor. East of the temple, a similar floor (250) was found 0.10 m below the foundations of Wall 557 (Sections B-B, C-C). A round installation, plastered on its western side, is connected to this floor (Pis. 4:1, below right). The floor is enclosed on the north by a brick wall (620) made of a black, muddy material. Both the wall and the installation were preserved to a height of a mere few centimeters above bedrock. Thus, the few remains in the area of Temple 319 show that the latter succeeded a short occupation period. We have no direct indication for the existence of cult place in this location already in the first phase of occupation. The stratigraphie evidence in the area surrounding the temple is rather different. In various places in this area (Loci 275, 278, 286, 292) two floors were found one above the other, the lower ones laid down close to bedrock. The brick walls in this area (Walls 610, 603, 621, 585 and 533) were built directly on bedrock, and sometimes the lower floors abut them (in the case of Walls 610 and 621). It is thus clear that Stratum XII has two phases and that the temple was founded only in the second phase. But it is still impossible to determine the character of the earliest phase: was it merely a short occupation period, represented by several floors and installations, or were some of the buildings in the area erected already in this phase, continuing to exist after the temple itself was founded? If the second alternative is correct, we can only assume that the fragmentary installations found below Temple 319 are part of the earliest cult place since, according to this alternative, the general layout of the "temenos" was established already in the earliest phase of occupation. These assumptions call for further investigation on the site. TEMPLE 319 (Figs. 4, 5, 13, 14; Sections A-A, B-B, C-C, F-F, G-G; Pis. 3-5) The Stratum XII temple was discovered below the floors and walls of the later temples. Most of the building was exposed, except for such parts as were covered by the stone walls of Stratum XI, which were left in situ in the process of excavation. The external dimensions of the structure are 6.40 X 6.60 m, and in plan it consists of one room (cella)1 with a raised platform at center. The corners of the building do not form right-angles; the northwest and southeast corners are at acute angles (84-86¬∞), while the southwest and northwest corners are at obtuse angles (94-96¬∞). The walls are built of brick, with- out stone foundations. The eastern wall (557) is 0.48-0.52 m thick and is built of a single row of 13</page><page sequence="19">CHAPTER THREE Fig. 4. Area C, Stratum XII, schematic plan. bricks, some of red hamra and others of black clay. The wall is preserved to a height of two courses and is covered by the lime floor (203) of the Stratum XI temple. The southwestern corner is covered by a stone wall (516) of Stratum XI; the corner is pre- served to a height of 0.45 m, and is plastered on the interior. The southern wall (584) is built of light brown bricks, is 0.68 m thick and it stands to a height of 0.65 m, leaning to the north at an angle of 8¬∞. A large part of this wall had collapsed into the temple (see Section G-G; PL 7:2). The northern wall (619) is made of the same light brown brick, and is preserved to a height of 0.50 m above the floor. It is at least 1 m thick, but the exact width cannot be determined, since its northern face was cut by the foundation trench of Wall 5 1 1 of Stratum XI (see PI. 14</page><page sequence="20">STRATUM XII: THE EARLIEST PHILISTINE SANCTUARY Fig. 5. Two suggested reconstructions of Temple 319 (Stratum XII). 4:4). The wall is built of two rows of bricks; in each course, one row is built of headers and the other* of stretchers. The western wall (578) was discovered beneath and west of the western stone wall (532) of the succeeding temple (Pis. 5:1; 15:1). Its western face was exposed for a length of 3.50 m. The northwest and southwest corners of the temple have not been excavated, but their location is certain. Temple 319 is built on a slope descending westward and northward. The foundation level of the walls follow the level of the bedrock, as can be seen, for instance, in the case of Wall 557, the foundation of which (in its northern part) is 0.30 m lower than the foundation level of the same wall, 4 m to the south. Hence, in the southeast corner of the building, the floor abuts the wall foundations, yet is at least 0.25 m higher than the foundations in the northwest corner. Above the lowest course of the eastern wall, a large stone slab (1.7x1.00x0.15 m) had been laid, protruding from the face of the wall. The top of the stone is 0.38 m higher than the nearby temple floor, yet it abuts the floor of the courtyard to the east (Locus 243, PL 5:3). It therefore probably served as the threshold of the entrance to the building.2 The interior dimensions of the temple are 4.75 X 5.06 m (the former measurement is con- jectural). Benches of beaten earth were found along the northern, eastern and part of the southern walls; they are 0.42 m wide, and rise just 0.15 m above the floor. Originally they were plastered with a thick layer of clay. The floor is made of a composite layer of lime and earth; its level is generally even (20.85 m above sea-level), but in the southeastern corner it rises by 0.20 m in accordance with the level of the bedrock. The floor was found covered with a layer of brick and plaster debris (0.40-0.50 m thick). Traces of fire were found in two places on the floor: in the southeast corner and near the entrance. However, in most of the area of the building there were no visible signs of fire. In the western part of the temple, a raised brick platform3 is preserved to a height of 0.5 m above the floor (Pis. 3; 4:1). In Stratum XI, Floor 203 and Walls 568 and 574 were built above the platform. Their construction destroyed the upper part of the platform, and thus its original height is unknown. The original form of this platform can be determined by lines of plaster, which have fortunately been preserved. Jutting eastward, it had a projection (0.84 m wide and 0.75 m long) divided into two parts by a plaster line. This projection was flanked by "wings", jutting 0.68 m on the south and 0.85 m on the north. All these appendages had probably been stepped. A plaster line, preserved to a lengh of 0.70 m, probably denotes the continuation of brick wall 613, which creates a corner with the northern wall of the temple (619). The length of this wall would thus be 3.36 m and its width 0.58 m; however, most of its western face is lacking. There are two possibilities for understanding the plan of the western part of the building (See Fig. 5 a-b): (a) "Wall" 613 was part of a solid platform stretching to the western wall of the building (578). In this case, "Wall" 613 could have served as a fourth step leading up to the platform; 15</page><page sequence="21">CHAPTER THREE (b) "Wall" 613 was indeed a wall, creating a cell (1.1 X 2.75 m) between it and Wall 578; entry to this cell may have been at its southwest corner, beneath stone Wall 532 of Stratum XI (which was not removed during the excavations). Such cells are characteristic of the succeeding temples here. About 20 pottery vessels were found on the floor of the temple beneath the brick debris. Most of them were grouped in the southwestern corner of the temple, south of the extant remains of the platform (PL 4:2). In the succeeding temples, too, most of the finds were concentrated in this corner. COURTYARD 110 (Sections C-C, D-D; Pis. 2:2; 17; 18:1; 21:1, 3) (Loci 110, 113, 156, 180, 210, 230, 243, 255, 275, 278, 286, 292, 297, 301, 311, 331) A large open space extends to the east of Temple 319; this courtyard was only partly excavated so as not to disturb the walls of Strata XI-X. However, it can be determined that it stretched eastward continuously from Temple 319 to the eastern end of Area C. On the north, it extends beyond the limits of the excavated area. The courtyard appears to be L- shaped, with a rectangle in the south (9 X 20 m) and one in the north (9 X 15 m); its overall area is at least 300 sq. m. Lime floors, covered by thick layers of light grey ash, with thin (0.10-0.15 m) layers of black ash, characterize the area of the courtyard. These ash layers appear just east of Temple 319 (Locus 263) and pass below the foundations of Walls 556 and 516 of the succeeding temples (Section A- A). Further east, in the soundings made below Room 106 of Stratum X, the debris layers of Stratum XII are 0.50 m thick. Here, three layers of black ash were found within the grey accumulation (Loci 301, 255; PI. 21:3; Sections C-C, E-E). In the northern part of the courtyard (Loci 292, 275) the ash layers are 0.80 m thick. In several places in the courtyard, two different floor levels could be distinguished, with 0.3 m between them (see, for example, Pis. 17:3; 18:1; 19:2). The lower floor is built on a layer of friable kurkar , the latter- covering the kurkar bedrock. In Locus 197, the two floors abut Wall 610, which is preserved to a height of six brick courses. As mentioned above, it is not clear whether both floors are contemporaneous with Temple 319 or whether, perhaps, the lower floor belongs to phase "XIIB". The floor of the courtyard slopes down to the northwest, following the bedrock. In Locus 311, for example, the lower floor is 0.7 m higher than in 16 Locus 275, 9 m to the north. The floors and ash layers in Locus 110 were penetrated by Pit 125 of Stratum XI, as can clearly be seen in the section (Fig. 8; PL 19:2). The layers of grey ash seem to be the result of the accumulation of organic material in this open area; this material was apparently burned from time to time, and hence the black layers. Similar grey and black ash layers characterize Iron Age I strata at several sites: Shiqmona, Aphek, Beth-Shemesh, Gezer, Tell el-Far'ah (S) and Tel Shera.4 The finds in the area of the courtyard included many sherds and animal bones; three special finds deserve mention: a scarab (Reg. No. 2912; see Part Two); an an- thropomorphic juglet (p. 81; PL 30:3-4) and on ivory handle of an iron knife (Reg. No. 3188; see Part Two).5 In the soundings made below Room 106 of Stratum X, in the southern part of the courtyard, meager fragments of brick walls were found, preserved to a height of one course only. The segment of Wall 605 may meet up with Wall 585, which enclosed the courtyard on the south. Since Wall 605 has a western continuation at its northern end, it may have formed part of a room within the courtyard, east of Temple 319. The significance of a short segment of a wall in the northeast corner of Locus 301 is undetermined. Room 314 (Sections D-D, E-E; PL 19:3) Room 314 is located northwest of Courtyard 110. It is rectangular, its interior dimensions being 2.20 X 7.00 m. The eastern wall (527), preserved to a height of 0.80 m, is built of a single row of light brown bricks resting on a stone foundation 0.20 m above bedrock. The bricks are laid as headers, and measure 0.43 X 0.58 m. On the south, Wall 527 creates a corner with Wall 528, of similar con- struction (PL 19:3). Two further walls (609, 610) are built up against the outer face of this southeast corner of the room. These walls are built of red hamra material; Wall 609, 1.08 m wide, is built of two rows of small bricks (0.18 X 0.54 m). The ash layers and floors of the courtyard (Loci 197, 297) abut these walls on the east and south. The ex- tremities of both walls end in an unclear manner: Wall 610 continues 3 m to the north, yet in a section made farther north (Locus 292), no continuation was found. Similarly, Wall 609 continues 2.5 m to the west, but does not appear in a probe farther west (Locus 320). The function of these walls is difficult to</page><page sequence="22">STRATUM XII: THE EARLIEST PHILISTINE SANCTUARY explain. Wall 609, at least, may have served as a ' bench or a raised platform facing the temple &lt; courtyard. The brick walls at the northern end of Room 314 i are well preserved. They were covered by a kurkar floor of Stratum XI (Locus 285). Most of the western i wall of the room has not been exposed, being covered ( by stone walls of later strata. Within the room, 0.25 &lt; m above bedrock, a lime floor was found, sloping down to the north; it was covered by an accumu- lation of 0.50-0.90 m of brick and plaster debris. I REMAINS NORTHWEST AND WEST OF , TEMPLE 319 I The structures of Stratum XII in the area west of Temple 319 and Room 314 are known only from | rather small probes. Trial Pit 316/320 (Squares 64 D3-4-74 A3) (Section F-F) I This probe was excavated within Room 204 of Stratum X. Below Floor 310 of Stratum XI, an accumulation of debris (0.70 m thick) is attributed to Stratum XII. Directly above bedrock, layers of lime (0.25 m thick) indicate the presence of a floor which had been repaired successively. Above these layers, a group of broken pottery vessels was found (Locus 320). The layer above consists of an accumulation of grey material and fallen brick, covered by another i floor (Locus 316), 0.60 m above bedrock. This floor passes beneath the foundation of Wall 511, the northern wall of the temple of Stratum XI (PI. 22:3). Both floors abut a brick wall which is the continuation of Wall 528. Trial Pit 317 (Square 64 D3) (Section G-G; PI. 23:1) The continuation of the brick wall found at Locus 320 was discovered here 4 m further west. South of this segment of the wall (62 1), the same stratigraphie picture was revealed: an accumulation of successive lime floors with layers of grey material between. Above this, a layer of black ash was found. It would appear that the wall fragments in Loci 320, 317 are part of a single wall built parallel to and 3 m away from the northern wall of Temple 319. The area between the temple and the wall (Loci 317; 320) may have been either a street or divided into several rooms. Trial Pit 324 (Square 74 B3) [Sections D-D, G-G; PI. 24:2) This probe was excavated below Locus 308, part of the street of Stratum XI. Above bedrock, an accumulation of horizontal layers of grey, soft material (1.10 m thick) was found. This would in- dicate that the area west of Room 314 was open, either a street or a piazza. Loci 248; 315 (Square 64 C2) [Sections B-B, H-H; Pis. 14:4; 15:1) Stratum XII remains were revealed west of Temple 319, as well. Parallel to the western wall of the temple, 0.25 m to the west, a wall (603) made of grey bricks was found, built on bedrock. It is 0.60 m wide and is preserved to a height of 0.70 m. Its western face is plastered, and it has a bench of red hamra, standing to a height of 0.30 m above bedrock (PI. 15:1). White lime floors, sloping down to the west, were found west of Wall 603. On the uppermost floor (Locus 248), a semi-circular brick installation (1.20 m in diameter) was discovered (PI. 14:4, below left). The floor and the installation are contemporaneous with the wall to the north (586), which creates a corner with Wall 603. While Wall 603 went out of use at the end of Stratum XII, Wall 586 continued in use throughout Stratum XI (see p. 27). Wall 603 has been exposed for a length of 6.50 m; its southern part, found below the floor of the small Shrine 300 (Strata XI-X), probably formed a corner with the continuation of Wall 519. Its northern section may have turned westward, in continuation of Wall 619, or continued northward, creating a corner with Wall 621. SOUTHEAST AREA: BUILDING 262 (Section E-E; PL 27:4) (Loci 280, 262, 147b, 256, 274) The excavation of this area was fraught with stratigraphical difficulties. Here the bedrock rises to its maximum height, and in the eastern end of the area (Square 65 C3) it is found a mere 0.50 m below the surface. Erosion has destroyed all the remains from Stratum X on. An additional disturbance was caused by a late trench cut into the area. Most of the walls and floors discovered here were definitely in use in Stratum XI, and some of them may have been founded already in Stratum XII. Wall 585, exposed for a length of 7 m, can be ascribed to Stratum XII with certainty; it is built of red hamra bricks, resting on bedrock. It was covered by Walls 17</page><page sequence="23">CHAPTER THREE 615 and 522 of Strata XI-X. The foundation trench of Wall 615, which cuts parts of Wall 585, can be seen clearly in a section (see Section E-E). Wall 585 continues eastward (533) and westward (519), thus creating a dividing wall between Courtyard 1 10 and the buildings to the south. This important feature in the layout of Area C survived throughout the following strata, though the wall itself was rebuilt successively. A large room is enclosed by Walls 585 (on the north), 587 (on the east) and the early phase of Wall 535 (on the west). The southern wall of this room is probably hidden beneath Wall 549 of Stratum XI. Two floors were found within this room; the lower one (280) is built directly upon bedrock and may be attributed to phase "XIIB", while the upper one (262) is 0.30 m higher. On the latter floor, fragments of storage jars were found (PL 27:3). Wall 533 (PL 2:2, below left), which continues Wall 585 eastward, forms a corner with Wall 587. It is built of grey bricks, laid as headers, and is founded upon bedrock. Above Walls 533 and 587, only one building phase has been found, attributed to Stratum X (Walls 522 and 548); it is therefore possible that Walls 533 and 587 were founded in Stratum XII and remained unchanged in Stratum XI. This phenomenon is related to the question of the date of construction of Building 147. The latter has not yet been excavated in its entirety. Its massive brick walls (564, 566, 537, 545) definitely existed in Stratum XI, and it may well have been founded already in Stratum XII. Floors of this stratum were found, close to bedrock, in Loci 147b and 256, thus connecting Walls 533 and 587 with the rest of the building. However, final proof that the building as such was constructed in Stratum XII is still lacking. In Square 65 B2, a circular pit (1.20 m in dia- meter) was found cut into bedrock (Locus 260), empty when discovered. Over it a brick wall (547) had been built, probably forming a corner with Wall 537. Since another wall (546) had been built close-by in Stratum XI, Wall 547 was probably constructed in Stratum XII, and may be further evidence that the first phase of Building 147 was built in Stratum XII. In this case, Pit 260 could be attributed to the earliest phase, "XIIB". All the remains above Wall 547 were destroyed by a pit dug during the Middle Ages, thus complicating the stratigraphy of this vicinity. BUILDING 221 (Section F-F) South of Temple 319, excavations penetrated into Strata XI-XII in a limited area, within Room 171 of Stratum X. Brick Walls 519 and 544 were built on bedrock and are preserved to a height of 1.50 m. They remained unchanged in both Strata XII and XI. Wall 519 was cut by a well (165) of the Middle Ages. In the section thus created, below the foundation of Wall 519 and directly on bedrock, a white lime floor could be seen - further evidence of phase "XIIB". Thus, Room 221 was apparently built contemporaneously with Temple 319. The southern wall of the room (614) was built of stones, in contrast to most other walls of this stratum, which were built of mud bricks without stone foundations. The in- terior dimensions of Room 221 are 2.20 X 3.10 m. A lime floor was found within, close to bedrock. At the center of the room, a pit (220) had been cut down to bedrock; the relationship of the pit to the floor is unclear. An accumulation of brick debris, 0.40 m thick, separates the floor of this room from Floor 201 of Stratum XI. The finds were sparse, but a piece of unworked iron is of significance. CONCLUSIONS Although Stratum XII has been excavated in only a limited area, certain conclusions concerning the development of the settlement here can be deduced. The first phase of occupation (XIIB) is represented by white lime floors laid on bedrock. Several walls (610, 603, 621, 533 and 585) may have been erected already in this phase, but the major building phase is related to the foundation of Temple 319. In this phase Walls 533, 585 and 519 formed a continuous line separating the temple precinct on the north from the dwelling area to the south. This division was preserved in subsequent strata, thus indicating a continuation of the urban planning. The rather small temple of Stratum XII was enclosed by buildings on three sides. In the subsequent strata, the temple was to be rebuilt on a larger scale, though its orientation and the location of its holy-of-holies were retained. The temple courtyard was very large in comparison with the rather limited size of the edifice itself. No signs of any enclosure wall of the temple precinct were found; if such a wall had existed, it would have been eroded completely on the eastern side of our excavated area, and would have extended beyond the limits of our excavations on the north. The oblong room (314) at the northwest corner of the courtyard would seem to have formed part of the temple complex, like similar rooms in the subsequent strata. The area west of this room was probably an open 18</page><page sequence="24">STRATUM XII: THE EARLIEST PHILISTINE SANCTUARY TABLE 1.

The area south and west of the temple precinct was closely built up already in this stratum. This picture is in contrast with the Findings in Area A, where only poor remains could be attributed to Stratum XII and most of the area remained unbuilt. This indicates that the temple precinct was originally at the very heart of the settlement; only in succeeding strata were the peripheral regions intensively built up. The succession of layers of ash and lime floors, reaching an average thickness of 0.50 m in Courtyard 1 10 and more than 1 m in Locus 324, are an indication of the long span of Stratum XII. As revealed by a study of the pottery, this stratum covers the entire second half of the 12th century B.C. It is difficult to define the end of this first city and the cause of its destruction. No traces of fire were found, and it is impossible to say if the destruction was caused by violent conquest or by some other reason. The southern wall of Temple 319 was found fallen to the north, a possible result of an earthquake; although this phenomenon was defined in one place only, and thus is insufficient proof, the possibility that an earthquake brought the end of this city should not be excluded. 20</page><page sequence="26">CHAPTER FOUR STRATUM XI: REBUILDING OF THE SANCTUARY (Plan: Fig. 49, p. 143; Schematic plan: Fig. 6) In Stratum XI new buildings were erected in most of Area C, and the few walls of the previous stratum which continued to exist were incorporated into them. The average thickness of the debris in this stratum is 0.50 m. The features of Stratum XI in Area C can be divided into the following units: (1) Temple 200; (2) Courtyard 281 and Pit 125; (3) Rooms 261 and 276; (4) Open Area 283 (5) Shrine 300; (6) Building 147; (7) Building 201. TEMPLE 200 (Figs. 6, 7, 13, 14; Sections A-A, B-B, C-C, F-F, G-G; Pis. 5-7) (Loci 200, 203, 227, 279) The temple of Stratum XI (Building 200) was erected on the stumps of the walls of the previous temple. In its plan, two principles of the previous structure were retained: the location of the holy-of- holies and the orientation of the building. However, the new temple as a whole was built according to a new plan. The four outer walls are 1 m thick and are built of undressed kurkar stones (0.40-0.50 m in length) (see Pis. 3; 4:1). The dimensions of the walls are:1 Exterior Interior Northern wall (511) 8.55 m 6.50 m Southern wall (516) 8.20 m 6.25 m Western wall (532) 7.70 m 5.85 m Eastern wall (556) 7.94 m 6.00 m The area of the building (including the walls) is 57 sq. m. The stone walls are preserved to a height of 1.30 m above the floor, but it is impossible to know if they were built entirely of stones or whether they had a brick superstructure resting on a stone foundation, as did the walls of the succeeding stratum. Although no plaster has been found on the external walls, it may be assumed that they were originally plastered with a layer of clay (as were the inner walls of the building). The eastern, facade wall (556; PI. 6:2) is situated 2.70 m east of the fa√ßade of the previous temple. It i s built on a layer of black ash which seals the accumulation of the previous stratum (Locus 243, Section A-A). This is the only outer wall of the building which did not continue in use in Stratum X and therefore it is less well preserved than the others. Its northern part stands to a height of 0.60 m, and its southern part, which continued to serve as a foun- dation for a bench in Stratum X, stands to a height of 1.00 m. The entrance to the temple is at the northern part of the eastern wall, and is 1.40 m wide. The southern doorpost is built of large stones (1.00 m long) and the northern one, of smaller stones. The northern wall (511, Pis. 3; 4:1, 4; 23:1) is built be- yond the boundaries of the previous building; its narrow foundation* trench cut the northern face of Wall 619 of Stratum XII (Section G-G, PI. 4:4). The wall was preserved at its western end to a height of 0.94 m, while the eastern segment stands to a height of 1.58 m. The floor of the temple abuts the lowest course of this wall. The western wall (532, Pis. 6:1; 8:2), which remained unchanged in use in Stratum X, is preserved to a height of 1.50 m; it is partly built over Wall 578 of the previous temple, leaving the latter wall outside the new temple. The lowest course of this wall is built in a slightly different line than the rest of the wall; its southern end projects 0.40 m to the east (PI. 7:2), while its northern end projects similarly to the west (Pis. 5:1; 15:1). The floor of corner Room 227 and that of Room 229 abut this lowest course on either side of the wall. This lowest course should not be taken as a separate building phase, as might be deduced from a glance at the plan, for both this and the upper courses are bonded to Walls 511 and 516. The slight difference between the courses of Wall 532 should be ascribed to a technical correction at the time of construction. At the southern end of Wall 532, two additional foundation courses were built at the level of the floor of Temple 319 (Section A-A, PL 3:1). These courses 21</page><page sequence="27">CHAPTER FOUR Fig. 6. Area C, Stratum XI, schematic plan. illustrate the process of the transition between Strata XII and XI; there was a space between the southern wall of Temple 319 and its raised platform. The builders of Temple 200 filled in this space with two courses of stone, and only above them did they build the first actual course of Wall 532. The southern wall (516) is built on the stump of brick Wall 584 of the previous temple. The floor at the center of the temple is 0.10-0.20 m lower than the foundation of Wall 516, although it gradually rises until it reaches the lowest course of the latter (Section F-F, PL 6:1). The sloping of the natural bedrock resulted in a differ- ence in height of 0.45 m between the foundations of Walls 516 and 511. Wall 516 is preserved to a height of 1.25 m. An interesting phenomenon can be seen to the 22</page><page sequence="28">STRATUM XI: REBUILDING OF THE SANCTUARY Fig. 7. Two suggested reconstructions of Temple 200 (Stratum XI). north of the temple: "Wall" 592 (Section G-G, Pis. 23:1-2) forms a corner with the continuation of the lowest course of Wall 532, and continues for 6.40 m opposite the northern face of Temple 200, though at a slight angle. This "wall" consists of only one course of stones; it was built above the grey accumulation of Stratum XII, but is covered by a beaten earth floor (283) of Stratum XI. At this corner of the temple, bedrock is 0.90 m lower than at the southwest corner, a fact which required the strengthening of the northwest corner of the new structure. Thus, the "wall" should be interpreted as a retaining wall, originally built only one course high and intended to level the area in preparation for the construction of the northwest corner of the building. The floor of the temple (Locus 203) is composed of a layer of beaten lime and earth laid up on a fill of light brown earth (0.15-0.20 m thick). The level of the floor within the building is 0.30 m lower than that of the courtyard and it is therefore assumed that a step led down from the courtyard into the temple. This step could have been built of wood at the entrance of the building, where the floor has not been preserved. Within the building, the floor was found covered by a layer of brick and plaster debris, 0.30 m thick. A few artifacts found scattered on the floor (Locus 203) include two bowls, a goblet, a bronze arrowhead and some bones. Benches were built of red hamra brick along the walls of the temple. The eastern bench (569; pl. 6:2) is of one course of bricks, 0.70 m wide and merely 0. 14 m high. The plastering of the floor here rises and covers the bench as well. A short segment of the southern bench was discovered in the southeast corner of the structure. In the western part of the temple, two brick walls (568 and 574) form a cell in the corner (227). Wall 568 (PI. 6:1), of which only one course of bricks is preserved, is 0.60 m thick and 2.76 m long. A bench runs along the northern face of this wall. Wall 574 is 1.12 m thick, and is built of a single row of bricks (each 0.80 m long), laid as headers, with an ad- ditional row of smaller bricks (each 0.32 m wide) laid on the western side (PI. 4:2). The wall is pre- served to a height of three courses on the west and one course only on the east (Section A-A; PI. 7:3). Both walls lack stone foundations and are built directly upon the floor level. The space enclosed by these two walls (227) measures 1.53 X 2.85 m; the entrance, 0.80 m wide, is situated between the southern end of Wall 574 and Wall 516. The beaten earth floor was found covered by a layer of black organic material and a rich collection of finds: cult vessels, pottery vessels (including many small offering bowls), beads, figurines, an ivory cosmetic bowl and an alabaster kohl pot (Pis. 7:1-2). Most of 23</page><page sequence="29">CHAPTER FOUR the objects were found along the walls, sealed by a brick construction and the artificial fill of the Stratum X temple (see below). It has already been noted that most of the objects of the three temples were found in this same location throughout Strata XII-X. It would seem, therefore, that the southwest corner was of some special significance throughout these three strata. The northwestern corner of the temple, north of Wall 568 (Locus 200), measures 2.35 x 2.75 m (Pl. 6: 1). Benches were built along the three walls of this niche-like corner. The finds from this spot include a Philistine bowl, a Philistine stirrup-jar and fragments of a lamp. Blue and red paint were found adhering to lumps of earth; signs of woven fabric were visible on the paint, indicating the former existence here of a large piece of painted cloth. The floor of Locus 200 was only partly preserved, but it probably originally covered Wall 619 of the previous temple. Another Philistine stirrup-jar was found immediately below the floor level, stuck onto the face of Wall 619 (PL 4:3). It seems to have been buried here intentionally by the builders of Temple 200. There are two alternatives for the interpretation of the remains of the western side of the temple: (1) Brick Walls 568 and 574 were actual walls, forming a room behind. In this case, the corner space in Locus 200 may have served as a holy-of-holies, while Locus 227 would have been a closed storeroom, similar to Locus 188 in the succeeding temple; (2) Walls 568 and 574 may not have been actual walls, but rather formed a platform, analogous to the raised platforms of the previous and succeeding temples. The fact that these "walls" do not have actual foundations is in favour of this latter interpretation. The two possibilities are shown in the alternative reconstructions (Fig. 7 a-b). No evidence was discovered of pillars to support the roof.2 It is therefore assumed that the roof was made of wooden beams, of over 7 m in length. These were probably of cedar, as were those identified in the temple of Stratum X. COURTYARD 281 AND PIT 125 The Courtyard Floors (Sections A-A, B-B, C-C, E-E; Pis. 17-18) (Loci 242, 253, 276, 281, 290, 296. Floor raising: Loci 233, 272) As in Stratum XII, a large open courtyard extended to the east of the temple. Most of the courtyard was revealed, except where there were 24 walls of Stratum X. A layer of brown, compacted earth (0.15 m thick) formed the floor of the courtyard, laid on the black, ash layer which sealed the accumulation in the courtyard of the previous stratum. A strip, 0.80 m wide, along the east face of the temple, was paved with a layer of kurkar (Loci 242, 253, 279; PL 19:3); east of this strip the floor of the courtyard was of beaten earth. The floor descends to the northwest, as did that of the previous courtyard. In Loci 296 and 281 (on either side of Wall 508 of Stratum X), the floor was found covered by a layer of light grey ash which included numerous animal bones and sherds. In Locus 296, a group of bowl-bases was found, all turned upside-down. East of the temple the floor of the courtyard had been raised twice (PL 21:1; Sections A-A, B-B). The second floor (Locus 272) was 0. 10-0.20 m above the original floor (281), and was again made of beaten earth, covered with animal bones and sherds. The third and uppermost floor (Locus 233) was made of a layer of light brown clay. The floor of the courtyard was thus raised several times, while that within the temple remained unchanged. As a result, the difference in height between these floors in- creased to c. 0.45 m. In the last phase, at least, a step was probably built at the entrance to the temple. At its southern end, the courtyard was probably enclosed by a wall (615), discovered in narrow sec- tion above Wall 585 of Stratum XII and below Wall 522 of Stratum X (see Section E-E). In Locus 290, east of the Stratum X temple, two parallel lines of brick construction were revealed, the southern one of which probably leaned on the continuation of Wall 615. The poor state of pre- servation, and the lack of any associated finds, pre- vent definite interpretation of these lines, but they could have been benches or a cult installation within the courtyard. In the northeast part of Area C the floor of the courtyard was destroyed by erosion. No remains of a curtain wall surrounding the courtyard were discovered and, even if such a wall had existed, it would have been completely eroded. It is therefore impossible to determine the eastern limits of the courtyard. Pit 125 (Pis. 18:1, 3; 19:2; Section: Fig. 8) Pit 125, in which an important group of cult vessels and pottery vessels was found, is situated in Square 75 Al, northeast of Temple 200. The stratigraphie position of the pit is well determined: it is sealed by the floor of Courtyard 111 and the foundation of the</page><page sequence="30">STRATUM XI: REBUILDING OF THE SANCTUARY Fig. 8. Section through Pit 125 and its surroundings (western baulk of Square 75 Aj). altar, both of Stratum X, and it cuts through the layers of debris of Stratum XII (Loci 110, 113). No remains of the courtyard floor could be discerned around the pit for a radius of 4 m; instead, the area was covered by a layer of earth (0.30 m thick) mixed with numerous animal bones and sherds (Locus 109). This layer is readily distinguished in the sections below the northeast corner of the temple of Stratum X (PL 19:2). The pit was cut into the bedrock, with straight sides; it is 1.90 m in diameter. The fill in the pit can be divided into several layers; below Floor 190 of Stratum X, a layer of brown earth (probably the make-up of this latter floor) covers the layer of earth, bones and sherds mentioned above. The next layer is composed of brown clay, below which (at the 20.10 m-20.20 m level) a concentration of finds was discovered. The most important find is an an- thropomorphic vessel (PL 29) found broken into several pieces (PL 18:3); nearby, a broken zoo- morphic rhyton was found (PL 36), as well as fragments of a zoomorphic mask, decorated Philistine vessels (bell-shaped bowls, a stirrup-jar and a horn-shaped vessel) and other bowls, goblets, juglets and lamps. The lowest layer in the pit consisted of dark brown clay, with a few sherds. Pit 125 can be interpreted as a favissa or a bothros which was used to bury cult and offering vessels. There are two possibilities in determining the date of the cutting of the pit: (1) it could have been cut while Temple 200 still existed; in this case, the pit would have been sealed during Stratum XI, but prior to the accumulation of the layers of sherds and animal bones in its upper layers; (2) the pit could have been cut at the end of Stratum XI, following the destruction of Temple 200 and prior to the construction of the succeeding Temple 131; in this case, the pit would have served as the favissa for the burial of cult objects used in Temple 200. The bones and sherds in the upper part of the pit could have been swept into it from the surrounding area, or they may be taken as evidence of extensive cultic practices in connection with the sealing of the pit. The fact that the sacrificial altar in Stratum X was built over this pit may indicate that the builders of Stratum X were aware of its sanctity. Rooms 261 and 276 (Sections D-D, E-E; PL 20:2-3) At the northern end of the courtyard, a rectangular room (261) was built; its outer dimensions are 3.40 x 5.90 m. The walls, 0.70 m 25</page><page sequence="31">CHAPTER FOUR thick, are built of brick without stone foundations; they are preserved to a height of 0.20-0.30 m and were exposed immediately below the surface, all later remains having eroded away here. The foundations of these walls were laid upon layers of black and grey ashes in the Stratum XII courtyard. The floor, a thin layer of lime, was preserved in patches at a level only slightly higher than the foundations of the walls. Fragments of storage-jars and a cooking-pot were found on the floor (PL 20:2). As we shall see, this room continued to exist, without change, in the following stratum. Room 276, situated to the west of Room 261 and perpendicular to it, is poorly preserved and its plan is reconstructed from fragmentary remains. The outer, conjectured dimensions of the room are 3.40 X 5.30 m. The eastern and southern walls (527, 528), of brick, had been founded in the previous stratum and reutilized in Stratum XI. The western wall (608), built of kurkar stones, is overlaid by a similar wall of Stratum X (530). The northern wall of the room has been reconstructed on the basis of a single stone, which forms a corner with Wall 608. Thus, the room is essentially a rebuilding of Room 314 of the previous stratum. The floor is of beaten earth and gravel (PL 19:3) and was found covered by a layer of organic material and ash, on which many sherds, animal bones and a large, beautifully dressed basalt grinding stone were found (PL 20:3). A second floor (Locus 135) was revealed 0.10-0.20 m above the original floor. It is of a layer of kurkar and was found covered by a layer of fallen brick, 0.30 m thick. It was especially well preserved in the central and western parts of the room. The entrances to Rooms 261 and 276 could not be located; however, it seems that the rooms were connected with Courtyard 281 and served as auxiliary rooms for cult practices within the temenos . OPEN AREA 283 (Sections D-D, F-F, G-G, H-H) (Loci 213, 219, 244, 271, 283, 285, 289, 293, 308, 310, 323, 328) A large open area stretches to the north of Temple 200 and Room 261. In the northwestern part of this area, the floor was of a layer of kurkar which was revealed up to Square 75 B2, where erosion has destroyed it. In this square, the open area is an uninterrupted continuation of Courtyard 281. North of Room 261 (Locus 213), the floor was covered by a layer of soft grey ash, 0.30 m thick. West of this 26 room, the floor was found in patches (Loci 285, 289, 27 1 ; PL 24: 1), descending to the west by 0.40 m over a distance of 8 m, in accord with the slope of the bedrock. In Locus 285, the floor covers the stump of Wall 527 of Stratum XII, while Walls 588 and 530 of Stratum X were constructed over it. Thus, the stratigraphy of this area is well established. In Locus 271, a new kurkar floor was laid, raising the original floor level by 0.10 m. In a section made below Room 204 of Stratum X (Section F-F), two superimposed floors of Stratum XI were exposed. The lower one (Locus 310) is of a layer of kurkar and abuts the northern wall (Wall 511) of Temple 200; this floor is a continuation of the kurkar floors in Loci 271 and 242. Thus, again, Open Area 283 is a direct continuation of Courtyard 281. The upper floor (Locus 244) is of grey beaten earth and is 0.15 m above Floor 310.3 On this floor, more than twenty pottery vessels were found, most of them leaning against Wall 511 (PL 22:2). The stone walls of Room 204 of Stratum X were constructed immediately above Floor 244 (Section F-F), and it seems as though the builders of that stratum were aware of (if not actually stood up on) this very floor. The continuation of the open area was found north of Temple 200 in Locus 283 (PL 23:2, Section G-G). Here, the floor is of greyish beaten earth, covering "Wall" 592 (which has been previously explained as a terrace wall revetting the northwest corner of the temple; see p. 23). The floor was exposed here in a large area (Loci 328, 308, 323) which is characterised by an accumulation of thin layers of soft, grey ash material descending steeply to the northwest. In several places, layers of black ash were found within the grey accumulation, similar to those found in the courtyard of Stratum XII. In both cases the grey material should be explained as the result of the accumulation of some organic material in an open area, and the black ash lines as an indication of occasional burning of this organic material. The open area continues also to the west of Temple 200. In Square 64 C2, a square installation was discovered, measuring 1 X 1 m and made of a thick layer of white lime, with a concaved upper surface (Locus 293; Pis. 5:1; 16:3). The lower part of a storage-jar was attached to the southeast corner of this installation, for draining liquids from the upper surface. A pestle and mortar, made of hard kurkar stone, were found on the installation. For the use of this installation, see p. 73.</page><page sequence="32">STRATUM XI: REBUILDING OF THE SANCTUARY SHRINE 300 (Sections A-A, B-B, H-H; Pis. 14-15) (Loci 229, 300) Shrine 300 is attached to the back (western) wall of Temple 200. Approach to it was through Open Area 283. It is composed of two parts: an entrance porch (229) and the actual cult chamber (300).4 Entrance Porch 229 (PI. 14:4, lower) The inner dimensions of this unit are 1.85 X 4.20 m. It is enclosed on the west by a brick wall (621), of which only a small section could be exposed at the western edge of the excavated area. The northern wall (586), founded in Stratum XII, continued in use here in Stratum XI, for the floors of this stratum abut it on both of its sides (PI. 16:5, bottom). The area along the western face of Wall 532 (the western wall of Temple 200) is problematic, since no clear floor of Stratum XI has been discovered here. It is assumed that Wall 532 served also as the eastern wall of Porch 229, and that the stump of the brick wall (578) of the previous stratum served in Stratum XI as a bench, along the new stone wall (Section B-B; PL 5:1). Floor 229 is 0.60 m lower than the floor of Temple 200. This difference in floor levels within the same stratum is explained by the slope of the bedrock in this area (Sections A-A, B-B). The floor is of a thick layer of lime, and covers the top of Wall 603 of the previous stratum, continuing into Cult Room 300. A broken cult bowl, decorated with a figure of a bird, was found in situ on this floor (Pis. 16:1, 2, 4). The bowl completes a set of three cult stands and two cult bowls found within Room 300 (PI. 33:1). Beside the bowl, a large slab of unworked stone (0.50 X 0.25 X 0.12 m) was found lying on the floor. The possibility that this stone served as a ritual massebah should not be dismissed, though definitive proof is lacking. Further east, at a slightly higher level, a cup- and-saucer and a low pottery stand were discovered. The floor was found covered by a 1.20 m thick layer of fallen brick abutting the top of Wall 532 (PI. 15:1, baulk). Large fragments of a fallen brick wall could be observed in the debris. The brick debris was found covered by a horizontal layer of sand, reaching a thickness of 0.50 m near the entrance to Room 300. Similar layers of sand were also found above the destruction layer of Temple 131 of Stratum X (see below). In both cases, the sand was found covered by a Stratum IX floor. Stratigraphically, therefore, Unit 229 is later than Stratum XII and sealed by Stratum IX (see below). The details and function of Unit 229 cannot be determined finally, because of the poor preservation of its front wall. The latter is only 0.40 m thick; it could have been a parapet or a wall supporting a light roof. The entrance to Unit 229 was probably at its northeast corner. Shrine 300 (Pis. 14:1, 4; 15:2) The exterior dimensions of Room 300 are 3.50 X 5.60 m, and its interior dimensions are 2.20 X 4.18 m. The walls are built of brick without stone foundations. The southern wall (599, 0.45 m thick) abuts the northern wall (515) of a dwelling to the south. The eastern wall (573) abuts the western wall (532) of Temple 200. The western wall (601) was discovered near the edge of the excavated area; its exact thickness is unknown, but it seems to have been a double wall, c. 1.00 m thick. The northern wall (600) is built of headers and is 0.80 m thick. The walls were preserved to a height of 0.85-1.50 m above the floor, and the entrance (1.10 m wide) is at the northeast. On entering the room, a turn of 90¬∞ to the right had to be made in order to face the holy-of- holies, located at the southwest corner. Inside, benches made of brick were built along all of the walls. They are 0.34-0.49 m wide and stand 0.16-0.26 m above the floor. The walls and benches were plastered with light brown clay mixed with kurkar grits. In the southwest corner is a raised platform composed of two steps (each 1.00 m wide and 0.42 m deep); the lower step is 0.40 m above the floor and the second one, 0.13 m higher. Both steps are built of brick and plastered similarly to the benches. Three brick projections stand on the floor in a row parallel to the southern bench, some 0.30 m from it. Their dimensions are 0.23 X 0.29 m; 0.23 X 0.33 m and 0.20 X 0.36 m respectively, and they stand to a height of 0.18 m above the floor. These projections could have served as pedestals for the three cult stands found in the shrine. A group of cult objects and pottery vessels was found in the southwest corner of the structure, near the raised platform. Three cylindrical cult stands were found on the floor, leaning on the lower step of the platform. On two of them, cult bowls were found in situ . As mentioned above, a third cult bowl was found in Unit 229, probably forming part of this 27</page><page sequence="33">CHAPTER FOUR same set. On the floor, near the cult stands, several goblets, jugs, chalices and lamps were found. This group had been smashed by the collapse of Wall 599, which had fallen to the north. A low cylindrical stand of pottery was found on the northern bench, and a bronze hook was discovered on the western bench. Also on the floor were five stones, one shaped like a pestle and another like a cone with a rounded top. Although these stones were no larger than 0.30-0.50 m, they may tentatively be interpreted as masseboth. The destruction of this temple was caused by the collapse of the walls; there was no accompanying fire, as the lack of both organic material and ashes indicates. The layer of fallen bricks reaches a height of 1.80 m (Pl. 14:2). As in Porch 229, the fallen bricks were covered by horizontal layers of sand which, in turn, were sealed by the lime floor of Stratum IX. The stratigraphie position of Shrine 300 can be determined according to the following data: (1) The shrine abuts Wall 532 on the east. The latter served as the western wall of the temples in both Strata XI and X. The floor of the shrine is 0.75 m lower than the floor of Temple 200 of Stratum XI, and 1.40 m lower than that of Temple 131 of Stratum X. A difference of 0.75 m is logical when the descent of the natural rock is taken into account. In contrast, the difference of 1.40 m is twice that called for by the natural slope. This fact would indicate that the shrine was founded in Stratum XI. (2) The foundation of the eastern brick wall (573) is 0.20 m higher than the floor of the shrine. Only the eastern bench joins the foundation of the wall and the floor (see Section A-A). This type of building technique, which is appropriate for construction on a slope, shows that Wall 532 was built first; then Wall 573 was attached to it, and only then were the other walls, the floor and the benches constructed. These are, of course, only technical phases which can be attributed to the beginning of Stratum XI. (3) On its southern side, Shrine 300 abutted Wall 515, which was founded in Stratum XII and continued in use without change throughout Strata XI-X. South of this wall, the floor level of Stratum X is 1.80 m higher than the floor of Shrine 300; such a difference is not plausible and indicates that the shrine was founded in Stratum XI. (4) The floor of Shrine 300 is a direct continuation 28 of the floor of Unit 229; this unit is enclosed on the north by Wall 586, which is connected to both Installation 293 of Stratum XI and Floor 194 of Stratum X. The layer of brick debris above Floor 194 is a direct continuation of that above Floor 229 and Shrine 300. This mass of fallen brick was found covered by a floor of Stratum IX. Thus, while to the north of Unit 229 a clear distinction between Strata XI and X can be made, in Shrine 300 itself there are no remains peculiar to Stratum X. (5) Floors 229 and 300 were built above a brick wall (603) of Stratum XII. This leads to the conclusion that Shrine 300 was founded in Stratum XI, contemporary with, or slightly later than, the construction of Temple 200. In Stratum X the small shrine continued to exist unchanged until it was destroyed, during the general destruction of the stratum. BUILDING 147 (Section E-E; PI. 27:3-4) (Loci 141, 147, 214, 222, 223, 266, 269) In the description of Stratum XII, the stratigraphie difficulties in the southeast part of Area C were presented (see above, p. 17). The large building (147) partly excavated in this area existed mainly in Stratum XI and went out of use in Stratum X. In the north, this building borders the temple courtyard, while in the south and east it continues beyond the limit of the excavated area. The walls of this building are of light brown brick, without stone foundations. The best stratigraphie picture can be found in a section excavated at the northern end of the building, where a foundation trench of Stratum XI (Wall 615) was found cutting a wall of Stratum XII (585) (Section E-E). Wall 615 went out of use in Stratum X, when it was built over by two new walls (510, 522). Walls 585 (Stratum XII) and 615 (Stratum XI) probably represent two phases of a large building (Building 147) to which a series of brick walls (566, 583, 564, 545, 537) further south can be attributed. These walls were founded on bedrock and some of them (564, 566, 583) were exposed immediately below the surface, for erosion had destroyed all later remains. As mentioned above, this building was probably founded already in Stratum XII. A kurkar floor (Locus 258) of Stratum X, constructed above Wall 537, proves that this building went out of use in this stratum.</page><page sequence="34">STRATUM XI: REBUILDING OF THE SANCTUARY The general plan of the building cannot as yet be reconstructed because of later intrusions, as well as the fact that it continues beyond the excavated area. The following rooms belong to this building: Room 141 The room is enclosed by Wall 615 on the north and Wall 535 on the west. Its southern wall is probably Wall 549, but the attribution of the latter to Stratum XI is problematic (see p. 45). On the east, the room could have been enclosed by Wall 587, but it is not clear if the latter, which existed in Stratum XII, continued also in Stratum XI. It is possible, therefore, that Room 141 was a direct continuation of Room 147. A later trench, passing from east to west, disturbed the interior of the room. The identification of the floor here is rather uncertain. Floor 141 appears in the plan of Stratum XI as belonging to this room, yet this attribution may be questioned as its level is somewhat too high and may, therefore, be more appropriate to Stratum X (see below). Yet no clear floor could be discerned between Floor 141 and Floor 262 of Stratum XII. Room 147 This room is enclosed on the north by Wall 533, on the east by Wall 564 and on the south by Wall 583 (PI. 27:4, upper left). All these walls were founded on bedrock and probably existed already in Stratum XII. As mentioned above, it is difficult to decide whether Wall 587 of Stratum XII existed also in Stratum XI, or whether Rooms 147, 141 and 266 constituted one unit. The inner dimensions of the room are therefore either 1.85 X 5.00 m or 4.50 X 5.00 m. The floor is made of beaten lime and is 0.20-0.30 m higher than the floor of Stratum XII. In the southeast corner is a brick installation measuring 0.70 X 1.90 m and made of two large bricks and several smaller bricks placed on their sides. It is built perpendicular to Wall 583, and since Wall 564 is at an obtuse angle to Wall 583, a narrow wedge-shaped space was formed between the wall and the installation. The function of this installation has not been determined, but it could have served as a platform or a bench. Near the installation a group of pottery vessels was discovered, including two storage-jars, chalices, a lamp, and a chalice which had been decorated by modelling of a bird's head and wings (see PI. 33:3). Room 269 The room is enclosed on the west, south and east by Walls 604, 537 and 546, respectively. The northern wall (549) can only tentatively be attributed to this stratum. The southern wall (437) (PI. 26:5) is es- pecially well preserved, with thick lime plaster on both faces. The interior dimensions of the room are 2.60 X 3.60 m. Most of the area within was de- stroyed by a later pit, yet on its western side a lime floor was found, and on it was a large fragment of a Philistine krater, decorated with a bird motif. The relative stratigraphy at this spot is not entirely clear, for excavations have not reached bedrock. Room 325 In a small probe excavated west of Wall 604, a kurkar floor (325) was found 0.35 m lower than a similar floor of Stratum X (306). This floor abuts Wall 549, and since it is earlier than the floor of Stratum X, it may be attributed to Stratum XI, thus determining the date of Wall 549 (see Section E-E). However, the detailed stratigraphy of this area must await further investigation (see below, p. 45). East of Room 147, parts of four rooms were dis- covered (PI. 27:4). In this area, the surface is very close to bedrock and the accumulation of debris is not deeper than 0.50 m. Stratigraphy in this area is therefore most difficult. Room 214 Wall 564, which separates Rooms 147 and 214, is a double brick wall, 1.30 m wide. Beyond the corner, with Wall 583 southward, it changes its direction slightly; this section (566) is 1.50 m wide. Floor 214, which abuts this wall on the east, is close to the bedrock; remains of three storage-jars and a jug were found on it. To the south, a floor was discovered on a slightly higher level (Locus 222). Floor 214 should probably be attributed to Stratum XII, and Floor 222 to Stratum XI, though the two might have been contemporaneous. Room 223 This room is enclosed by three brick walls (583, 566, 545). It is 2.50 m wide; its length is unknown. At the northwest corner was a rounded installation, built of bricks standing on their narrow sides. Room 175 This room, at the eastern edge of the excavated area, is built of stone walls founded on bedrock. Its hard 29</page><page sequence="35">CHAPTER FOUR kurkar floor was also laid on bedrock. No later remains were preserved here, and the stratigraphie attribution of the room remains doubtful (see below, p. 46). Room 330 A small probe, south of Wall 537, revealed part of a room in which a thick layer of brick debris (over 1.00 m deep) covers a bench attached to Wall 537. Both the bench and the face of the wall are plastered with a thick layer of lime. The nature of this room and its dimensions are as yet unknown. The width of the walls of Building 147, and the dimensions of this partly excavated building, show that it was a public building. Its location at the highest part of the mound, next to the temple complex, is evidence of its importance. It was probably part of the acropolis of the city. BUILDING 201 (Sections F-F, G-G) (Loci 199, 201, 302, 322) Of building 201, situated south of Temple 200 and west of Building 147, only one room and parts of two others have been excavated. The building is enclosed on the north by Walls 519 and 515 which form part of a long wall crossing the area from east to west. Room 201 The southern wall of this room (543) is built over Wall 614 of Stratum XII and is covered by Floor 171 of Stratum X (PL 26:4). The entrance to the room, 0.83 m wide, is located at the western end of this wall. The western wall (544) was probably founded already in Stratum XII and went out of use in Stratum X. The interior dimensions of the room are 2.30 X 3.10 m. Its floor is of beaten earth and kurkar gravel. Large bricks were found laid on the floor as if to strengthen and repair it. The floor was found covered by a layer of brick debris 0.80 m thick, with no traces of fire. Room 322 A large part of this room was destroyed by medieval Well 165. The tops of the southern and western walls (612 and 616) were found immediately beneath the floor of Room 193 of Stratum X. The interior dimensions of the room are 2.15 X 5.10 m. In a small section cut towards Wall 612 from the north, it could be observed that the foundation of that wall is 0.77 m above bedrock, and that the floors of Stratum XII pass below it. It can therefore be concluded that 30 radical changes took place in this area in Strata XII, XI and X. The general plan of Building 201 cannot as yet be determined. Two trial pits were excavated south and west of these rooms (Loci 302 and 312), revealing floors of Stratum XI. These indicate the continued trend of the floors, sloping downward to the west, as in the northern part of the excavated area. CONCLUSIONS The basic layout of the Area C buildings in Stratum XII continued in Stratum XI. This is proved by the unchanged location of the temple, the arrangement of the courtyard before it, and the continued use of the long wall south of the temple enclosure cutting across the area from east to west. However, all the buildings were built anew, on a different plan. The stone walls of Temple 200, which were built on the stumps of the brick walls of the previous temple, indicate a radical change in building technique. The addition of the small temple west of the main one suggests an expansion of the sacred area. The close proximity of Public Building 147 to the temple suggests the con- centration of public buildings in the highest area of the city. This area probably served as the "acropolis" for the settlement. The large open areas east and northwest of the temple may be taken as an indi- cation that the settlement was not closely built up in this phase. The raising of the floors in the open areas indicates that the time-span covered by Stratum XI was com- paratively long. The nature of the destruction of Stratum XI is difficult to define. No signs of destruction by fire were found. On the other hand, the floors of the buildings were covered by a layer of brick debris. In several places the builders of Stratum X reused walls of the previous stratum (as in the case of Temple 200 itself), utilized structures founded in Stratum XI (as in the case of Shrine 300 and Room 261) and founded new walls on the floors of what were open areas in Stratum XI. All this would imply that Stratum XI did not end in catastrophe and that the transition between Strata XI and X was a gradual process of new construction replacing old. Some structures (such as Public Building 147) went out of use in Stratum X, yet the general layout of the area was retained there, too.

The destruction layer buried rich groups of finds, which came to light on the well- preserved floors. This characteristic destruction layer facilitated identification of the remains of Stratum X and, therefore, this stratum served as the reference point for determining stratigraphy on the site. The buildings of Stratum X can be divided into the following units: (1) Temple 131; (2) Courtyard 111; (3) Courtyard 235 and Room 204; (4) Shrine 300; (5) Street 241; (6) Building 236; (7) Building 225; (8) Remains east of Building 225; (9) Street 224. TEMPLE 131 (Figs. 9-14; Sections A-A, B-B, C-C, E-E, F-F, G-G; Pis. 2:1; 7:4; 8-13) (Loci 106, 127, 131, 133, 134, 142, 188) Temple 131 of Stratum X is, in fact, a rebuilding and extension of the previous Temple 200. Three of the outer stone walls of the previous building were reused, and thus the outer contours of the building in its western part were retained. Nevertheless, radical changes were made in the internal plan. An entrance room (106) was added; the inner division of the main hall was altered; and the floor was raised by 0.70 m. The outer dimensions of the temple are 8.00 x 14.50 m and thus it covers an area of 1 16 sq. m. The Fill of the Floor The floor of the main hall of Temple 131 was laid upon an artificial fill. An unusual feature in the make- up of this fill is a "frame", constructed of bricks along the inner sides of Walls 51 1, 532 and 516 (Sections A-A, B-B, C-C, F-F). This frame could most readily be recognized in the west, along Wall 532. The brick construction (Wall 558 in Sections A-A, B-B) covers the accumulation of objects in Locus 227 and the red brick bench in Locus 200, both of Stratum XI (Pis. 6:3, 7:1). The southern frame also covers part of the accumulation of objects in Locus 227. It is clear that the builders of this brick construction were aware of these artifacts and intentionally covered them over. Although this brick construction resembles a separate building phase, it is clear that it is merely a frame supporting the fill of the floor of Temple 131 since, on one hand, it is built over the floor of Temple 200 and, on the other hand, it is covered by the floor of Temple 131. The northern wall (511) was thickened to 1.25 m by adding a foundation row of stones, laid upon the brick construction of the fill (see Sections F-F, G-G). Within this artificial frame, two layers could be discerned (PI. 5:3; 6:1): the lower one, 0.30 m thick, was laid on the floor of Temple 200; this layer is composed of light brown brick material with plaster debris and some sherds. The upper layer, of similar thickness, is of darker brown brick material, entirely lacking sherds. In several places the outlines of bricks could be discerned. This upper layer seems to have been built of poor-quality bricks. Two round stone pillar bases were incorporated into the fill, which was covered by a layer of plaster composing the actual floor. This process of constructing a fill for the floor of the new temple indicates a continuity between Strata XI and X - the builders of Temple 131 having commenced their building operations from the floor of the previous temple. Entrance Room 106 (Pis. 7:4; 8:1; 10:1) The following data determined the stratigraphy of Room 106: (a) the floors of the Stratum XI court- yard were found beneath the foundations of the walls of the room; (b) the eastern wall of Temple 200 (556) went out of use and the foundation of the western wall (517) of Room 106 was adjoined to its stump (PI. 5:2; Section A-A); (c) the foundation level of the walls of Room 106 is 0.50 m higher than that 33</page><page sequence="39">CHAPTER FIVE Fig. 9. Area C. Stratum X, schematic plan. of the walls of Temple 200; (d) the northwestern corner of the room was built as an extension of Wall 511. The foundation of the new section (513) is 0.50 m higher than that of the wall to which it was ad- joined. In contrast to the previous building, the walls of this entrance room were built at exact right angles. The inner dimensions of the room are 3.57 X 5.85 m. The thickness of the eastern and western walls is 1.20 m, while the southern wall, which is adjoined to another wall of Stratum X, is only 0.80 m thick. The walls are built of brick on a stone foundation. The foundation of the eastern wall (508) is not level; its northern part is about 0.20 m lower than the southern part, in accordance with the natural slope. The walls are preserved to a height of 1.00 m above 34</page><page sequence="40">STRATUM X: FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE PHILISTINE SANCTUARY Fig. 10.

Exonometric view of Area C, Stratum X; looking south-west. the floor, and the bricks (0.40 X 0.80 m) are of light brown material. In the upper course of Wall 508, the bricks were laid as headers on the inner face and as stretchers on the outer face (see plan). Walls 513 and 517 were similarly built, while narrower Wall 510 was built of only stretchers. The walls were covered on both faces with a thick layer of plaster made of light brown clay mixed with kurkar gravel. The main entrance to the temple is at the northern end of Room 106. It is flanked by two pilasters; the eastern one (1.18 m wide and 0.40 m deep) was formed by thickening the eastern wall of the temple (508), while the western one (513, PL 9:2), 1.28 m wide and 1.50 m long, is an extension of Wall 511. A recess, measuring 0.40 X 0.60 m was left in the outer corner of the western pilaster and a parallel 36</page><page sequence="42">STRATUM X: FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE PHILISTINE SANCTUARY recess was created on the eastern side of the entrance by a bench built along the pilaster, ending 0.40 m from its outer face (PL 19:1; see reconstruction, Fig. 10). The width of the entrance at its outer side is 3.23 m, and on its inner side, 2.50 m. Three stone slabs, the largest of which measures 1.15 X 0.62 m, form the threshold (Pis. 19:1; 21:3). The slabs are slightly higher than the floor of Room 106, although the latter gradually rose to meet the top of the slabs. No traces of door-sockets were found. If such had existed, they would have come to light, for the en- trance was well preserved and plastered on all its surfaces. Thus, it can be assumed that the temple doors were set into a wooden frame, probably built into the outer side of the entrance. Each door wing would have been about 1.40 m wide. With the doors opened, activities within Room 106 would have been visible to an onlooker in the courtyard, yet the main hall of the temple would have been hidden from view. Along the inner walls of the temple, two stepped benches were built of brick and compacted earth (Pis. 10:1; 21:1). Each bench is 0.40 m wide; the lower bench is 0.40-0.60 m higher than the floor, and the upper bench is 0.20 m higher. A continuous layer of plaster lines the inner face of the wall, the benches and the floor. In the southwestern corner of the room, a large slab of kurkar stone (1.00 X 1.00 m) was found lying on the upper bench. It may have served as an offering table or for some other un- known function. The original floor of the entrance room was composed of a layer of compacted brown earth, 0.10-0.15 m thick, covered by a layer of beaten lime plaster. This floor was preserved in the northern part of the room where it meets the threshold slabs and the benches along the walls. In the center of the room, the floor has sunk (PI. 21:2) and was con- sequently repaired - a new beaten earth floor was found 0.14-0.24 m above the original floor (PI. 10:1). A layer of brick and ash debris, 0.80 m thick, was found covering the floor of the room. Burnt organic material was found mainly in the northern end of the room. Near the entrance, the accumu- lation of organic material was 0.20 m thick and included remains of burnt beams, probably from the wooden frame and doors of the entrance, which had caught fire during the destruction of the build- ing. The southern part of the room was disturbed by Pit 124, dug during the Roman period. The finds in Room 106 were sparse; two fmall flasks were found on the floor near the entrance, and two lower fragments of bowls were found on the western bench. Wall 517, which separates Room 106 from the main hall of the temple, is 1.20 m thick. It has only one foundation course and is built of stones to a height of 0.70 m above the floor; one course of bricks was found above the stone courses. At its northern end the wall has a protrusion to the west, forming a pilaster 0.93 m wide and 0.58 m deep. The wall is plastered on its three surfaces (PI. 9:3). The foundation course of Wall 5 17 continues to the north until it reaches Pilaster 513 (Pis. 5:2; 6:2; in the plan this course appears in dotted lines). This foundation course created a massive threshold between Room 106 and the main hall. The wide entrance (3.30 m) is flanked on one side by the northern end of Wall 517 and on the other side by a projection, 0.10 m deep, formed by Pilaster 513. The floor of the temple covers most of the foundation course at the entrance, except for two large stones protruding above the floor at the center of the threshold (PL 10:2, left). On both sides of these stones, unplastered bricks (0.60 m thick) were laid so as to narrow the entrance between Room 106 and the main hall to 1.80 m. Since only one course of bricks was found, surrounded by large quantities of burnt wood and ashes, it is probable that the superstructure of this partition was built mainly of wood. It is not known whether there had been a door in this partition or whether it was merely an open doorway. The Main Hall (Loci 127, 131, 134, 142; Pis. 9:1, 10:2) The outer lines of the main hall of this temple follow those of the previous structure. It is an irregular rectangle with the following inner di- mensions: length (along the central axis, including Room 188): 7.2 m; width on the eastern side: 5.80 m, and on the western side: 5.35 m. As mentioned above, the northern wall (511), 1.00 m thick in Stratum XI, was bolstered to a thickness of 1.25 m by adding a row of stones laid above the brick structure of the fill of the floor (Section F-F). The superstructure of the wall above this row of stones is of bricks, laid as headers and stretchers (PL 10:2). The western and southern walls of the previous temple continued to exist without change. They were built of stones, preserved to a height of 0.70 m above the floor. The southern wall is plastered on both sides even though Wall 519 is abutted to its outer face. Along the central axis of the main hall stood two 37</page><page sequence="43">CHAPTER FIVE round stone bases, for wooden pillars. The long axis of the hall is thus divided into approximately equal parts (not taking into account Partition Wall 551): the distance between Wall 532 and the center of the western pillar base is 2.65 m; the distance between the centers of the two bases is 2.52 m; the distance between the center of the eastern base to the hypothetical continuation of Wall 517 is 2.20 m. The pillars were built parallel to the northern wall of the temple; the distance between their centers and the latter wall is 2.90 m. However, since the room is not an exact parallelogram, the distances to the southern wall differ (2.83 m from the center of the eastern base, and 2.56 m from the western base). This symmetrical division shows that the outer stone walls (511, 532 and 516) were considered as one architectural unit for the purpose of the roofing. The further inner division of the main hall by Partition Wall 55 1 and the cult installations before it were built after the pillars had been constructed, and probably even after the hall had been roofed over. It may be assumed that the pillars carried beams which crossed the main hall from north to south, thus dividing the area into rectangular strips no wider than 2.65 m, a distance readily spanned by shorter beams. The pillar bases (Pis. 3; 5:3; 6:1) are of chalky stone, and are cut as exact cylinders, 0.68 m in diameter. The eastern base is 0.52 m high, 0.18 m of which protrudes above the floor. The western base is 0.40 m high and is completely sunken into the fill of the floor. A round wooden pillar, 0.30 m in diameter, had been laid on this base and then brick steps were built around it (Pl. 1 1 :2). The negative impression of this wooden pillar is preserved (PI. 11:1, 3-4) and, for the first time in the archaeology of this country, enables the reconstruction of the relation between the diameter of a stone pillar base and that of the wooden post above it; in our case, this relation is 2.2:1. Remains of burnt wood which were dis- covered nearby, as well as near the entrance to the temple, have been identified as cedar.1 Near the pillar bases, fragments of unfired clay were found, bearing negative impressions of round wooden beams. These are probably remains of the clay used for filling the gaps between the wooden beams of the roof. Benches similar to those found in Room 106 were built along the walls of the main hall. Those along the northern wall terminate in a stepped projection, 0.70 m high (Pis. 9:1; 13:2). The benches along the southern wall vary in width; while on the east they are 0.53 m wide, on the west they are only 0.36 m wide. This seems to have been intentional, so as to equalize the distance between the lower benches along the northern and the southern walls (4.40 m). Wall 556, the eastern wall of the previous temple of Stratum XI, went out of use in Stratum X, yet its top was reused as the foundation for the bench along Wall 517. A brick partition wall (551) was built in the western part of the temple, 1.35 m east of Wall 532 (PI. 10:2). Its length is 3.08 m and its width is 0.65 m. This wall was clearly built after the completion of the other walls, for in order to bond it to the northern wall (511), a narrow foundation trench was cut into the latter. Wall 551 lacks any stone foundation; only two courses of brick were found below the floor, incorporated into its fill. As seen above, this partition wall was not taken into consideration when the roofing of the temple was carried out. It is possible that this wall did not even reach the roof, but was merely a low partition. When this wall was dismantled during the process of excavation, an alabaster flask and two pottery vessels (a bowl and a juglet) were found within it. This group was probably a foundation deposit, buried amongst the bricks during its erection. At its southern end, the wall projects westward, creating a small partition, 0.40 X 0.70 m. An entrance between this partition and Wall 532, 0.60 m wide, gives access to Room 188. A raised platform (Locus 133) abuts Wall 551 on the east. The location of this platform is interesting: it is situated north of the central axis of the hall, opposite the center of the main entrance. This location was intended to provide a direct view of the raised platform from the entrance, without interference of the pillars. The brick platform was founded directly within the fill of the floor. The platform measures 1.12 X 1.30 m, and its original height was 0.90 m above the floor. It was plastered on all of its sides, by the same layer of plaster which covered the walls, benches and floor. The upper part of the platform was almost totally destroyed by the foundation trench of a Byzantine wall, yet part of the original plaster covering its upper surface was pre- served (Pis. 10:2; 11:1, and Section C-C). The benches along the northern wall (511) turn southward to meet the northern side of the raised platform. The upper bench is wider than average (0.88 m). Two steps lead up to the raised platform on its southern flank (PI. 11:1). The lower step is 0.33 m high and the upper one is 0.13 m high. As mentioned 38</page><page sequence="44">STRATUM X: FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE PHILISTINE SANCTUARY above, the steps were built of bricks over the western stone pillar base and around the wooden post standing upon it. The steps were plastered with the same plaster covering the raised platform and the floor. The erection of the steps should not be taken as a separate building phase, as might be concluded at first glance. The construction of all the inner features of the temple (benches, raised platform and steps) is homogeneous and contemporaneous. The light brown plaster mixed with kurkar gravel is characteristic, and corners were usually rounded off when the plaster was laid. The fire which destroyed the building baked the plaster, which is thus well preserved. The floor of the main hall is more or less level, yet is 0.10 m higher at the edges than in the center. The floor was covered with the distinctive plaster noted above. It was found covered by a layer of debris - bricks, plaster, burnt beams and ashes. The character of this destruction layer differs in the several corners of the area. In the northeastern part of the hall (Locus 127, PI. 13:2) the destruction layer was 0.50 m thick and contained much brick, baked hard by the fire. The floor itself was covered by a layer of black ash, several centimeters thick. The destruction layer also covered the benches along Wall 511 (Sections F-F, G-G). A layer of brown earth, 0.50 m thick, covered the destruction layer in this area. Above this, a lime floor of Stratum IX was found. In the northwestern corner of the hall (Locus 142, PI. 13:3), the destruction layer may be divided into two sub-layers; the lower one, 0.40 m thick, contained bricks and plaster debris mixed with much burnt organic material. The upper layer contained brick and plaster debris, with no traces of fire; it was found sloping downward from the top of the platform toward the eastern pillar base, and rising toward the east, thus creating a depression in the center of the hall. The depression was found filled with horizontal layers of sand up to 0.30 m thick. This sand accumulated during a period following the de- struction of the building and before its rebuilding.2 In the southeastern part of the hall (Locus 131, PI. 13:1), two destruction layers were found, similar to those found in Locus 142. The upper one reached the top of the preserved wall, 0.80 m above the floor. In this area the floor of Stratum IX did not survive and in its place a layer of black ash covered the de- struction layer, as well as the top of Wall 517. In the southwestern corner of the temple (Locus 134), Byzantine building activity destroyed all early re- mains, apart from a layer of accumulation above the floor, 0.50 m thick. This latter layer was rich in burnt organic material, wooden beams and brick debris. The process of the destruction of the temple can be defined by analysing the destruction layers. First, the building was set on fire; the roof, which consisted of wooden beams and clay plaster, burned and collapsed onto the floor. This is represented by the accumulation of burnt organic material on the floor. Later, the upper parts of the walls collapsed, creating the second layer of brick debris and which contained no traces of fire. The horizontal layers of sand which accumulated in the depression at the center of the brick debris is an indication of a time-gap in the occupation of this area. Most of the finds in Temple 131 were discovered around the raised platform and in adjacent Locus 134 (Pis. 1 1:3-12:3). In other parts of the main hall, few finds came to light. In Locus 142, a bowl was found upside-down on the floor, near the eastern end of the bench. West of it, a jug and a juglet were found. On the southern side of the locus, near the end of Wall 517, a small pilgrim flask was found on the floor. Fragments of an unusual libation vessel (PI. 37:3) were found on the floor near the raised platform (other parts of the same vessel were found 0.40 m below the floor, in the burrow cut by a rodent). Two bowls had been placed on the northern benches. Two cult vessels were found in Locus 131: a pottery "naos" (Pl. 30:1-2), found lying on the floor east of the raised platform, and a cylindrical cult stand decorated with two moulded animal figures (PI. 32:3), found lying on the floor, near the middle of the southern bench; an iron bracelet was found nearby. On the upper step, south of the raised platform, were a bronze axe-adze (No. 1430), the upper part of a cylindrical cult stand decorated with human figures (PI. 32:1), part of a large ritual bowl, and a pottery lamp. The lower part of the same cult stand and the other part of the ritual bowl were found in the de- struction layer, 1.00 m east of the raised platform. The neck and rim of a large cult vessel (PI. 31:6) were found in the upper part of the destruction layer, near the top of the raised platform. Body fragments of the same vessel were discovered in the courtyard north of the temple entrance. The above facts show that during the destruction of the temple cult objects were smashed and scattered about. On the floor, south of the raised platform and Wall 55 1, a row of pottery vessels was found - including 39</page><page sequence="45">CHAPTER FIVE fragments of two storage-jars, two jugs, a krater, juglets and bowls turned upside-down and arranged one within the other in groups of two (PL 12:2). A similar group of bowls was found at the western end of Locus 134, near Wall 532. Nearby, a bichrome strainer-jug, lamps and a composite double flask were found (PL 12:1). Another group of vessels was found along the southern wall and the benches in Locus 134, including a bichrome globular jug, a composite triple flask, a pomegranate-shaped vessel and several other pottery vessels (PL 11:4, right). A number of bowls were found at the top of the destruction layer as preserved; these had probably fallen down from a niche or a shelf in the wall. A bird-shaped cult bowl (PL 34:3-4) and a zoomorphic libation vessel (PL 37:1-2) were restored from fragments found scattered over Locus 134. Most of the pottery vessels along the walls were found in situ . In contrast to the cult vessels, these vessels seem not to have been discarded or disturbed before the destruction of the building. They were found ar- ranged along the walls as if thus intentionally placed. Room 188 (PL 12:4-6) Room 188 is situated on the western side of the partition wall (551). Its inner dimensions are 1.35 X 3.20 m. Its beaten earth floor is 0.15 m lower than the floor of the main hall. In contrast to the rest of the temple, the walls of this small chamber were not plastered. Above the floor there was a layer of brick debris 0.50 m thick, the top of which was disturbed by a Byzantine wall. Few traces of fire were found within the chamber. More than a hundred pottery vessels were discovered on its floor, most of them in a pile 0.30 m high at the northern end, along Wall 511, and some others close to the entrance, near Locus 134. Among them were bowls, jugs, juglets, flasks, several decorated Philistine vessels (bowls, jugs and stirrup-jars), as well as a pome- granate-shaped vessel and a cult bowl with tubular rim (PL 37:1). In the northeast and center of the chamber, the lower parts of three storage-jars were found. The fragmentary lower part of another large jar might be from a "collard rim" pithos. This chamber probably served as a storeroom for offering vessels. The vessels found in it are of a different chronological value than those found on the floor of the main hall. While the latter were in use up to the very end of the temple, the former may well have accumulated over the entire life-span of the building, from its foundation, and many of them were probably no longer in use when the building was destroyed. PL 40:8 shows a pottery disc, 1 8cm in diameter and 3 cm thick. It has a hole in the center, and one side of it is well worked, with two concentric ridges. The other side is unworked. The disc is made of coarse ware with a black core, and is covered with light red slip. This object was found with two large fragments of similar discs, in the foundations of the Byzantine hypocaust, built about 0.50 m above the western part of Temple 131. On the back, unworked side of each of these discs, traces of plaster were found, similar to that covering the walls and various installations of the temple. The discs were used during the Byzantine period as a filling material for a floor, and thus we may assume that they were taken from closeby. Since the Byzantine builders probably removed the upper debris of the destruction layer of the temple, it may be concluded that the discs were found by them in this layer. The traces of plaster on their back side show that they had been attached to walls or installations in the temple, and they may thus be considered as architectural decorations of a unique type.3 COURTYARD 111 (Section E-E; Pis. 2:2; 17:1; 18:1) (Loci 111, 172, 190, 215, 231) Courtyard 111, which stretches north and east of Temple 131, continues the tradition of the previous strata, yet while in the latter the courtyards were not defined by walls, the present courtyard was sur- rounded by stone walls which created two major units: the eastern one, measuring 6.00 X 7.00 m, and the northern one, 4.20 X 11.50 m. The overall area of the courtyard is almost 100 sq. m. The stone walls (529 and 563) enclosing the courtyard on the northeast (PL 17:2) were discovered below the surface soil; one course of large stones was preserved (the length of the corner stone is 1.25 m). While the outer face of these walls is straight and well built, the inner face is rough. This construction technique would indeed suit a terrace wall or fence. The gap between the southern end of Wall 529 and Wall 534 (which enclose the courtyard on the south) may have been destroyed by erosion or by human activity, though the possibility that it was intentionally planned should not be excluded. The rectangular room (261) at the northern end of the courtyard, founded in Stratum XI, continued to 40</page><page sequence="46">STRATUM X: FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE PHILISTINE SANCTUARY exist without change in Stratum X, and the stone walls of this stratum enclosing the courtyard abut its corners. The brick walls of this room were preserved to a height of only 0.30 m and no entrance could be located. The stone wall (588) enclosing the courtyard west of Room 261, 0.60 m wide and preserved to a height of two courses, is built on the kurkar floor of the courtyard of the previous stratum. It creates a corner with the stone wall (530), the latter enclosing the courtyard on the west and abutting the northern wall of the temple (511) (PI. 19:1, right). Thus, two Stratum X walls (513 and 530) were attached to Wall 511, which had been founded already in Stratum XI. The foundation level of these two added walls is 0.70 m higher than that of Wall 511. Wall 530 is partly built over a stone wall (608) of the previous stratum. In its southern part, which served also as the eastern wall of Room 204, this wall is preserved to a height of 0.80 m; in its northern part, a 1.50 m segment of the wall is built of large, flat stones, the tops of which lie at the level of the courtyard floor (PI. 19:1, bottom right). This was probably the threshold of the entrance from Street 241 to Courtyard 111. The corner between Walls 530 and 588 was strengthened on the outside by several large stones. The floor of the courtyard is of light brown clay, similar to that used for plastering the surfaces in the temple. The floor was made up of a layer of compacted earth, 0.30 m thick. Sherds, animal bones and ashes were found on the floor, yet no destruction or ash layer was found here. In the southern part of the courtyard, near the entrance to the temple, the plaster of the floor is 0.06-0.07 m thick. Below it, a 0.02 m thick layer of lime was found, probably intended to strengthen the floor before the entrance. The northern part of the courtyard floor has been destroyed by erosion. A square foundation (530) was built within the courtyard, 1.80 m north of the temple, in line with its eastern wall (Pis. 18:3; 19:1). The foundation measures 1.30 X 1.50 m, and is built of two courses of rough kurkar stones, 0.35-0.57 m in length. It is flat atop and protrudes 0.10-0.15 m above the floor of the courtyard, which meets it on all sides. This square foundation was built above Pit 1 25 of Stratum XI (PI. 18:3) and is in turn covered by the courtyard floor of Stratum IX (Locus 103). Its shape and location indicate that it was the foundation of a sacrificial altar, the location of which was carefully considered. Although situated at the fa√ßade of the temple, it was placed off to one side so as to leave the area before the entrance proper free for movement. No special finds were uncovered on the altar or nearby. In the eastern part of the courtyard (Locus 190) the level of the bedrock rises and the thickness of the accumulated debris gradually decreases. The courtyard floor, made of a layer of light brown clay, is but a few centimeters above the floor of Stratum XI and the same below the floor of Stratum IX (PI. 18:9). In the eastern end of this area the floor of Stratum XI has disappeared, probably as a result of levelling activities in preparation for the floor of Stratum X. The latter was laid directly upon the debris of Stratum XII. In Locus 231, the floor was found covered by a layer (0.25 m thick) of brick and plaster debris. In Locus 172 (PI. 2:2) the floor had been disturbed by late pits, including a large Byzantine one. Here the level of the floor rises toward Wall 522, enclosing the courtyard on the south; this wall has two courses of stones, with plastered brick built above. A bench (0.40 m wide and 3.30 m long) was found along the outer face of the eastern wall of the temple (508). It is built of two courses of dark brown bricks, plastered together with the wall. The finds in the area of the courtyard were sparse and included mainly broken pottery and quantities of animal bones. COURTYARD 235 AND ROOM 204 (Sections F-F, G-G; Pis. 22:2; 23) (Loci 194, 204, 235, 303, 304) Courtyard 235 borders the northern and western walls of Temple 13 1. At its eastern end is Room 204, while in the south it leads into the small temple (300) which continued in use unchanged in Stratum X. On its northern side, the courtyard is enclosed by a stone wall (593), built parallel to the northern wall of the temple, some 3.00 m from it. The entrance to this courtyard was from Street 241 through an open- ing 1.40 m wide, having a large threshold stone (0.85 X 1.10 m). The entrance was flanked by two short walls running north-south (PI. 23:2); the eastern one (536) is also the western wall of Room 204, while the western one (594) is only 1.60 m in length. The space between these two walls was probably covered, forming a sort of a roofed gate- room. Upon entering through this gate-room one could either turn left into Room 204 or right, into the courtyard (235). 41</page><page sequence="47">CHAPTER FIVE Room 204 The inner dimensions of the room are 2.10 x 2.90 m. Its stone walls were preserved to a height of 0.80-1.00 m. The northern wall (511) of Temple 131, founded already in Stratum XI, served as the southern wall of this room. The eastern and western walls (530 and 536) were built on Floor 244 of Str√§tum XI (Pl. 22:2-3), and their foundation level is higher than that of Wall 511. The entrance to the room, 0.95 m wide, is at its southwestern corner. The foundation of Wall 536 continues below the threshold level of the entrance and abuts Wall 511 (PI. 23:1). Fifteen clay "loom weights" were found on the entrance floor. In the light of the traces of a heavy fire at the entrance, causing the partial baking of the brick debris, it can be assumed that the en- trance door and frame were originally of wood. Two installations were found on the floor of the room. In the northwestern corner, a small installation (inner dimensions 0.40 X 0.60 m) was built of stones and terminated in a small platform. A thick layer of black ash and remains of intensive use of fire, which had even baked the plaster on the walls above, indicate that this installation was a cooking stove. The second installation, in the southeastern corner, was enclosed on two sides by the walls of the room and on the third side by bricks stood up on their narrow sides. This installation may have been for storage. The floor of the room was of beaten earth and was found covered by a layer of black ash. In the northeastern corner, four storage-jars were found in situ standing on the floor. The floor was covered by a layer of brick debris, 0.70 m thick on the southern side and 0.35 m thick on the north. The brick debris were covered by a layer of stone debris (PI. 22:1), apparently from the collapse of the Stratum X walls. Room 204 probably served in an auxiliary role in relation to the cult practices, perhaps for the pre- paration of the ritual meals. Courtyard 235 The L-shaped space west of Room 204 (Loci 235, 304, 194) was probably an unroofed courtyard. On the north, this space is 3.00 m wide. The enclosing wall on the west is beyond the limit of the excavated area, yet, if we assume that the hypothetical con- tinuation of Wall 621 enclosed the courtyard on the west, the width here would be 4.20 m. The floor of the courtyard is of layers of beaten earth and, in some places, layers of kurkar . The floor descends toward the west, thus creating a difference of 0.50 m between the level of the threshold to the courtyard and that of the floor in Locus 194. In Locus 304, the floor is of thin layers of beaten earth, probably created by continuous use and treading upon it. In the center of this area, close to Wall 593, a pit (Locus 303) was found, 1.50 m in diameter and 1.00 m deep. This pit cut into Wall 592 of the previous stratum, while floors of the following stratum were sunk into it (PI. 23:4). It contained only layers of soft grey ash, and may have served as a rubbish pit for the ashes from Room 204. In Locus 194, the floor of the courtyard was of layers of kurkar , 0.20 m thick (PI. 16:2, 5); this floor seals the plastered installation (293) of the previous stratum. The floor ends in a straight line, parallel to the brick wall (586) which is connected with Shrine 300. The finds in Courtyard 235 were meager and consisted mainly of sherds. The floor was covered by a layer of brick debris 0.80-1.00 m thick. In Locus 194, fallen stones were found among the bricks, and horizontal layers of sand, 0.10-0.15 m thick, cover the debris. These layers resemble those found in the area of Temples 131 and 300. Shrine 300 As already noted, this shrine was founded in Stratum XI (see above, pp. 27-28), and continued in un- altered use in Stratum X. Courtyard 235 led to the shrine from the north. STREET 241 (Sections D-D, F-F, G-G; PI. 24:1) (Loci 241, 245, 246, 268, 282, 291, 309) As we have seen, in Stratum XI the area north of Temple 200 was a wide open area extending beyond the excavated zone. In Stratum X this area was di- vided by stone walls into Courtyard 235 on the sopth and Building 326 on the northwest, with Street 24 1 crossing between them. The section of the street excavated forms a corner, extending on the north and west beyond the limits of the excavated area. The with of the street in its western part is 3.80 m. The walls enclosing the street are built of at least two stone courses above street level, as is the rule with outer walls in Stratum X. The corner of Building 326 was rounded off to facilitate movement along the street. In the area of the street, thin layers of soft, grey material were found, a continuation of the layers of the previous stratum; the total thickness of their accumulation above the kurkar floor of Stratum XI is 0.80 m. However, it is difficult to distinguish 42</page><page sequence="48">STRATUM X: FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE PHILISTINE SANCTUARY precisely between the debris of Stratum XI and those of Stratum X, which were sealed by the lime floor of Stratum IX. The layers descend to the north and south by 0.50 m over a distance of 9.00 m. In Locus 24 1 three layers of black ash were found in the grey debris. A bell-shaped pit, probably dug in Stratum VIII, cut through the grey debris in this area. At the northern end of Locus 241, a round pit, 1.10 m in diameter, was found containing grey ash (Locus 246). The grey debris at the northern end of Locus 24 1 are sealed by brick debris which had fallen from Wall 579. These, in turn, are sealed by the lime floor of Stratum IX. In Loci 309 and 291, in the southern part of the area, layers of black and grey ash covered a beaten earth floor. The grey and black layers are similar to those of Strata XII and XI, and are characteristic of open areas at Tell Qasile. As mentioned above, these layers represent the ac- cumulation of organic material and its occasional burning. Street 241 was probably one of the major streets in the ancient settlement, and from it en- trances led into the two courtyards (111 and 235) of the sacred enclosure. BUILDING 326 (Sections D-D, H-H; PI. 23:3) (Loci 277, 326) Only the southeastern corner of this building has been excavated. The outer wall (579) is 0.75 m thick and is preserved to a height of 1.00 m. Its curved shape and the destruction of its brick superstructure have been noted above. A brick partition wall (590) was revealed within the building, and in Locus 326, south of the partition wall, a short fragment of stone construction was found, with a partly preserved stone pavement flanking it. The other loci here have beaten earth floors on which large fragments of storage-jars were found. The level of the floor is 1.00 m lower than that of Street 241. This considerable difference in levels within the same stratum was brought about by the descent of the natural rock to the northwest; the buildings were erected on the slope, and while inside one building the floors are more or less on a single level, large differences in floor level can be expected from one architectural unit to another in the same stratum. BUILDING 225 (Sections F-F, G-G; Pis. 24:3-26:4) (Loci 168, 171, 187, 193, 225) Dwelling 225 abuts Temples 131 and 300 on the south. The maximal outer dimensions of the building are 8.50 X 13.50 m, and it covers an area of about 1 12 sq. m. The building includes a courtyard divided by a row of pillars into a roofed and an unroofed section, and two square rooms to the east. The eastern and southern parts of the building are well preserved, the walls standing to a height of 0.40-0.80 m above the floor. The western and northwestern parts, however, were damaged by later building operations. The heavy fire of the destruction caused a partial baking of the brick walls, giving them a reddish hue. Beneath the heavy destruction layer many pottery vessels were found. The northern and part of the eastern walls of the building (515, 519, 535) were founded in previous strata and reused in Stratum X. The other walls were founded in Stratum X, according to a new plan. The northern wall (515 and 519) was destroyed partially by a well of the Middle Ages (165) and partially by a late ditch, leaving only one course of bricks preserved above floor-level. The eastern wall (555) of Room 168 was built directly on a kurkar floor (306) which was preserved on both sides of the wall. Wall 541 was built over Wall 544 of Stratum XI, with a slight change of direction (PI. 26:3). Wall 540 was built parallel to Wall 543 of Stratum XI, some 0.70 m south of it (Section F-F, PI. 26:4), thus enlarging Room 171. The entrance to the room was rebuilt at the western end of the new wall. Walls 544 and 543 of Stratum XI, which went out of use in Stratum X, were found immediately beneath the floor of Room 171. The outer southern wall of the building (570 and 572), facing Street 224, is built of stones to a height of 0.25 m above the street level, the brick su- perstructure appearing only above this level. As mentioned above, this building technique is char- acteristic of the outer walls of Stratum X. The outer wall of the courtyard (572, PI. 24:3) is only 0.60 m thick, while its continuation (570), enclosing Room 168, was thickened by an additional row of bricks laid as stretchers. Only a small section of the outer western wall (602) was preserved, at a level lower than that of the courtyard floor. The rest of this wall, as well as the southwestern corner of the building, were destroyed by an Iron Age II pit. The entrance to the building was apparently situated somewhere along this wall as the other walls were all well preserved and showed no indications of an opening. It is probable that a northwestern street ran west of this building. 43</page><page sequence="49">CHAPTER FIVE Courtyard 225 measures 3.70 X 7.60 m in- ternally, and thus covers an area of 28 sq. m. The floor is composed of a layer of beaten lime (PI. 24:3) and was found covered by a layer of brick debris, 0.50 m thick. Several pottery vessels were found on the floor (PI. 25:3), including an Egyptian storage- jar which came to light in situ in the southeastern corner, a krater and a peculiar jar with unusually thick walls. On the northern side, the courtyard is enclosed by a row of five pillar bases, large, roughly worked slabs of kurkar (0.40-0.70 X0.70-1.00 m; average thickness, 0.15-0.20 m; PI. 25:1). These bases were sunk into the layer of brick debris of the previous stratum, and their tops were flush with the courtyard floor. The western base differs from the others in its round shape and better workmanship. It probably originated in a public building of the previous stratum and is in secondary use here. From center to center, the pillar bases are 1.20-1.50 m apart. These bases probably carried wooden columns supporting the roof of a "portico" on the north. With the destruction of the house, the wooden pillars burned, firing the surrounding fallen bricks. Around each pillar base, burnt remains were discernible. The "portico" north of the pillars measures 3.00 X 8.30 m internally, and is divided by a narrow brick partition wall (514) into two units (193, 187). The western unit (193) was paved with a layer of kurkar gravel (PI. 25:1), the floor being a few centimeters lower than the tops of the pillar bases, and sunken at its center. It was found covered by a thick layer of black ash, burnt beams and fallen brick, which had smashed several pottery vessels. The partition wall (554) is only 0.40 m thick; at its northern end it abuts Wall 515, while its southern end probably reached a wooden column. Another partition wall (553) spanned the space between Wall 541 and the easternmost pillar base. Its seven courses of bricks were fired during the destruction of the temple and hence are well preserved. These two partition walls were built over the kurkar floor and may therefore be considered as a secondary building phase. They create Unit 187, the entrance to which is situated between two pillar bases. The floor of this unit is a continuation of the floor of "Portico" 193 and it, too, was found covered by a thick layer of black ash. A group of pottery vessels found on the floor includes a decorated Philistine stirrup-jar, a red- slipped strainer-jug, a juglet, a bowl, and five clay "loom weights". The northern part of this unit was destroyed by the medieval well (165). At the south- eastern corner of the unit is a meager brick con- struction, built parallel to the partition wall (533) and creating an installation (Locus 185, PI. 25:2), measuring 0.60 x1.50 m internally. Within this installation, a group of vessels (including two storage-jars and several jugs) was found, within a heavily burnt layer. This installation probably served as a storage space. South of the partition (553) a brick platform was found, measuring 1.00 x 1.00 m and standing to a height of 0.40 m above the floor. A kurkar mortar and pestle were found on this platform. Wall 541, which divides the courtyard and Unit 187 from the two eastern rooms of the building, stands to a height of 0.70 m above the floor. At its southern end, the entrance to Room 168 could be identified, although poorly preserved. The inner dimensions of Room 168 are 3.60 X 3.90 m. The floor is composed of beaten earth, yet along the eastern and southern walls, a 1.00 m wide strip was paved with kurkar . In the northeastern corner, a square silo (0.85 x 0.95 m) was built of narrow bricks stood on their narrow sides, laid directly upon the floor (PI. 26:3). The silo was found filled with burnt legume seeds. The floor of the room was found covered by the same thick, black ash layer characterizing the other rooms of this building. The finds in this room were rich. Remains of more than eighty storage-jars, all of similar type, were re- covered. About twenty storage-jars were found standing along the southern wall, and the rest were found fallen within the destruction layer, 1.00 m thick (PI. 25:4-26:2). Forty-five of these jars could be restored completely and the remains of 35 others were registered. Some jugs, bowls and two large, hand-made dough-troughs (?) were found in this room. Near the silo, a basalt vessel was found standing upside-down. In the destruction debris, large fragments of bricks (including complete ex- amples) were observed (PI. 25:4). From the posi- tion of the jars within the destruction level, it can be assumed that they had originally stood on several tiers of shelves. The finds suggest that the room served as a storage room as well as for household activities. The grinding-stone in the courtyard, and the dough-troughs and silo in the adjoining room, indicate that the food was prepared within this building, yet since no ovens were found here, the baking and cooking probably took place elsewhere, either in the oven found to the south, in Street 224, or somewhere in the unexcavated area to the west. 44</page><page sequence="50">STRATUM X: FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE PHILISTINE SANCTUARY The stratigraphie situation at the southeast corner should be noted. Here, it seems as if Walls 555 and 570 were built on a massive kurkar floor which continues on either side of these walls, in Loci 224, 306 and 268. This floor is certainly of Stratum X, since it covers Wall 537 of Stratum XI. This stratigraphie situation could not finally be clarified, since we did not dismantle Walls 555 and 570, nor did we cut a section through them. Yet, if our im- pression is correct, this may lead to the conclusion that Building 225, or at least Room 168, was con- structed in a late phase of Stratum X, probably after the erection of Temple 131. However, no final conclusions for this problem can be drawn for the time being. Room 171, the second square room, was entered from Room 168 through an opening 0.80 m wide (PI. 26:4). Much burnt organic material found in the entrance indicates the former existence of a wood- en door here. Near the entrance, several "loom weight", as well as a broken hippopotamus (?) tusk, were found. The inner dimensions of the room are 3.05 X 3.36 m. Its floor, of beaten earth, was found covered by a layer of black ash. The finds on the floor included fragments of a storage-jar, four complete decorated Philistine stirrup-jars and fragments of a decorated kernos (PI. 40:1-3). The northern part of the room was disturbed by a late ditch, leaving the northern wall preserved only to a height of 0.10 m above the floor. However, the southern and eastern walls stand to a height of 0.68 m; Wall 540 had collapsed to the north (PI. 25:2, section). The finds indicate that this room was the main living room of the building. No clear evidence for the existence of a second storey was found in Building 225, yet the thickening of Wall 570 may indicate the existence of such above Room 168, and probably also above Room 171. There is no direct connection between Building 225 and the temple enclosure to the north. The entrance to the building was probably from a north-south street to the west, which may have met with Street 24 1 to the north, which led to the temple enclosure. The proximity of this building to the temple, the fact that its back (northern) wall abuts the outer tem- ple wall, and certain peculiar finds (the kernos fragments, the five complete stirrup-jars) may in- dicate that Building 225 served as a priestly residence. (For comparative discussion of the plan of this house, see below, p. 74.) REMAINS OF STRATUM X EAST OF BUILDING 225 (Section E-E) (Loci 137, 173, 175, 306) The area east of Building 225 underwent a radical change in Stratum X. Building 147 of Strata XII-XI went out of use; one of its main walls (537) was covered over by a kurkar floor (306, 258), a direct continuation of the floor of Street 224 south of Building 225 (PI. 28:1). Most of this area, however, has been destroyed by erosion and by late pits. Two brick walls can safely be attributed to Stratum X. Wall 522 (PI. 27:1) is built above Wall 615 of the previous stratum. Its western part, abutting the southern wall of the temple, is built of brick without a stone foundation. Its eastern part, enclosing the courtyard of the temple on the south, is built of bricks laid over a stone foundation of two courses. It is probable that Wall 534, a continuation of Wall 522 to the east, was founded in Stratum X, though its exact stratigraphie position is not clear (see above, p. 29). A second brick wall (549) is built parallel to Wall 522 and 2.50 m south of it. We have previously mentioned the possibility that this wall was founded already in Stratum XI, though this could not be determined with certainty. Two floors meet up with this wall (Loci 141, 137). The lower one (141) can be attributed to either Stratum XI or Stratum X (see above, p. 29). On this floor three installations were found; two of them are rounded and built of stones; the third lies in the western corner of the room; it is built of bricks standing on their narrow side (PI. 27:2), and could have served for storage, while the rounded installations probably served as stands for storage-jars. The poorly preserved upper floor (137) is of lime, and its attribution to Stratum X is certain since it was covered by a wall and a floor of Stratum IX. The room formed by Walls 522 and 549 was enclosed on the west by Wall 535, and on the east by a brick wall (548, founded in Stratum X). It is as yet not known whether this room formed a separate entity or whether it belonged to a larger structure which has not been preserved. The stratigraphical sequence south of Wall 549 is also rather complicated. Of two kurkar floors here, the upper one (306), continuing into Room 168, can clearly be attributed to Stratum X; the lower floor (325) was constructed either in a late phase of Stratum XI (in this case Wall 549 should be at- tributed to the latter stratum) or in an early phase of Stratum X. 45</page><page sequence="51">CHAPTER FIVE Room 175, situated at the eastern end of the excavated area, and described in the previous chapter (see above, p. 30), also involves stratigraphical difficulties. Its northern wall (334) could be a continuation of Wall 522 of Stratum X, since its western angle was built above Wall 533 of the previous strata. The general plan of this area in Stratum X could not be defined due to the heavy erosion and the proximity to the surface soil. STREET 224 (Sections E-E, F-F, G-G; Pis. 24:3; 28:1, 3-4) (Loci 224, 238, 258) At the southern end of the excavated area, a 19 m segment of a street was exposed running north-east to south-west. At its southern end (Locus 224), the street is bordered on the north by Building 225. East of this building the kurkar pavement (306) extends in a small section preserved up to Wall 549. It is not clear whether this area was an enlarged piazza or whether another wall, which has since completely disappeared, continued the line of Walls 572 and 570. On the east, the street pavement reaches the line of erosion, and in the south it continues beyond the limit of the excavated area. The street pavement is of beaten kurkar gravel, with many sherds trodden into it. The pavement slopes down to the west, the difference in level being 0.25 m over a span of 10 m. In the western area, large blocks of collapsed brick walls were found on the street pavement. Above these, a silo was erected in Stratum IX (PI. 28:3). Wall 570 and 572, bordering the street here on the north, is thickly plastered on its outer face. Close to the end of Wall 570, a round oven (0.70 m in dia- meter) was found standing upon the street pavement. This oven was soon abandoned and its remains are scanty; still within Stratum X, a second oven was built partly over it, but slightly to the east. The latter is of similar size and shape as the first one; its walls are of clay, 0.03 m thick, and preserved to a height of 0.20 m (PL 28:4). The finds in the street were sparse, mainly sherds typical of Stratum X. Near the oven a decorated flask was found. The street went out of use in Stratum IX, as can be deduced from the stone walls of the latter stratum, built over its pavement. CONCLUSIONS Building activity at Tell Qasile reached its peak in Stratum X. The transition from Stratum XI to 46 Stratum X can be defined as a quiet process rather than the result of a violent destruction. The buildings of Stratum X were constructed with the intention of improving and elaborating the earlier structures, while the general layout of the area was preserved. Some architectural units of Stratum XI, such as Room 261 and Shrine 300, continued to exist essentially without change. Three of the outer walls of the main temple of Stratum XI continued to be used, though the plan of the interior underwent a radical change and the building was enlarged to the east. The open courtyard of Stratum XI was divided in Stratum X into a street, from which entrances led into two separate courtyards before each temple. Single rooms within the courtyards served the cult, and before the main temple, a sacrificial altar was built. The long wall, which divided the area south of the temple enclosure from east to west already in Stratum XII, continued to exist in Stratum X, although some segments on its eastern side were rebuilt. It served as the northern wall of a block of buildings bordered by a street on the south. Thus, the temple enclosure on the north and the dwelling houses on the south, bordered by parallel streets on at least two sides, created a block ("insula"), recalling the planning of Area A in this same stratum. It seems, therefore, that Stratum X com- posed a well planned town, with parallel streets surrounding blocks of buildings composed of two rows of structures with adjoining back walls. While in Strata XII and XI the floors of the open areas were raised several times, such a phenomenon was not found in Stratum X, a fact which may indicate a shorter duration for the latter stratum. Indications of two building phases in Stratum X were observed only in the southeastern corner of Building 225, which was built over a kurkar floor of the same stratum. Many of the buildings of Stratum X were de- stroyed by a violent fire. In Area C, Temple 131, Room 204 and Building 225 were all burned. In Area A, Buildings K, J, W and O were burned. On the other hand, no traces of fire were found in Shrine 300, which was destroyed by the collapse of its walls to the north. Similar collapsed brick walls were seen in Street 224 as well. The destruction of Stratum X can be explained in two ways: the city may have been taken in battle and its buildings razed; but it is also possible that the town was destroyed by an earthquake, during which buildings collapsed and caught fire. Although the first alternative seems more</page><page sequence="52">Fig. 13. Schematic plans of the Tell Qasile Temples. Fig. 14. Superposition of the plans d√¨ Temples 319, 200 and 131 (Strata XII-X). plausible, the second should not be ignored. The pottery and finds show that the destruction occurred at the end of the eleventh century or the beginning of the tenth century B.C. A violent conquest of this site at such a time may be attributed to King David. 47</page><page sequence="53">CHAPTER FIVE TABLE √é. LIST OF LOCI, STRATUM X.

Large portions of these strata, at the southwestern corner of Area C, were destroyed by Byzantine structures, while at the eastern and northern ends of the area erosion had taken its toll. Remains of Stratum IX were preserved mainly in the northern half of the temple, north and west of the temple and in a small, southern part of Area C. Although no complete structures were preserved, the remains were sufficient to reconstruct the development of settlement in this stratum. The architectural units in Stratum IX are: (1) Temple 118; (2) Courtyard 103; (3) Building 169. TEMPLE 118 (Sections B-B, C-C, F-F) (Loci 118, 126) Although the building remains found above the temple of Stratum X were scanty, they were suf- ficient to indicate that the temple was rebuilt in Stratum IX. This has been determined on the following evidence: (a) The northern wall of the previous temple was rebuilt. One course of bricks of the rebuilt wall has been preserved, made of red clay bricks which were laid over the light brown bricks of the previous stratum. The face of the new wall protrudes 0.10 m to the north of the wall of Stratum X, and a large (0.85 X 1.45 m) slab stone terminating the wall on the east forms the foundation of the western doorjamb of the temple entrance (PI. 9:2). The slab covers the recessed doorjamb of the previous temple and was laid 0.30 m above the earlier floor level. (b) The western and eastern walls of the previous temple (532 and 508, respectively) were met on the exterior, close to the uppermost preserved course, by floors of Stratum IX, which were built above the destruction layer of Stratum X (see Section C-C and Pis. 5:1; 8:2, below; 17:1). Since no separate building phase of Stratum IX could be observed in the construction of these walls, we assume that following their destruction in Stratum X, these two walls were repaired without any notable modification in the preserved portions. (c) A kurkar floor (148) of Stratum IX, meeting the northern wall of the temple (511), was con- structed above the destruction layer of Stratum X in Room 204 and Courtyard 235 (PI. 20:5). A stone wall (512) of Stratum VIII was, in turn, built over this kurkar floor (PI. 2:1, left). A white lime floor of the courtyard of Stratum IX (Locus 105) was built above the destruction layer of Stratum X at the entrance to the temple and continues within the building. (d) The Stratum IX floor within the building, made of a thick layer (0.10-0.12 m) of mixed lime and earth, was preserved in the northeastern part of the structure, where there were no disturbances by later building activities (Loci 1 18, 126; Sections B-B, C-C; Pis. 2:1; 11:3; 13:3). This floor was built 1.00 m above the Stratum X floor and is separated from the destruction layer of Stratum X by a layer of accumulated sand and brown earth (PI. 13:1), in- dicating a certain gap in occupation, prior to its construction. The floor is 0.60 m higher within the building than in the courtyard before it (Section E-E). This difference in level was brought about by the presence of the thick destruction layer within the building, over which the floor was laid. Only a few fragments of this floor were preserved; the eastern part (Locus 126) does not meet the eastern wall (508), and two large pits destroyed its southern and northwestern parts. In the north, this floor slopes down through the entrance of the building towards the courtyard. At the entrance itself, the floor was laid upon a layer of bricks, stood up on their narrow side. It was not clear whether these bricks were from the collapsed wall of the previous stratum or whether they were laid here intentionally, to strengthen the floor at the threshold. The western section of the 50</page><page sequence="56">STRATUM IX: REBUILDING OF THE RUINED SANCTUARY floor (Locus 1 18) touches the northern wall (5 1 1); at its western end the floor was 0.20 m above the upper surface of the raised platform of Stratum X (Section C-C; Pl. 1 1 :3), and breaks off at a structure, of which only one brick survives, made of the same red clay as the repaired wall (511). This brick is probably the remainder of a platform which was built in Stratum IX directly above that of the previous stratum. This assumed platform was almost completely destroyed by Byzantine foundations. Floors 126 and 1 18 were clean of finds, though a thin layer of earth containing some sherds overlay it. Above this layer an accumulation of unstratified material, up to one meter thick, reached the surface. The above data show that the ruined temple of Stratum X was repaired in Stratum IX and, although no cult objects were found, the structure probably continued to function as a temple. No clear evidence of the nature of the destruction of the Stratum IX temple was found. Although the walls of the building were repaired in Stratum VIII, no separate floor of this latter stratum was found within, and the floor of Stratum IX (126, 118) may also have served in Stratum VIII until the final desertion of the building. COURTYARD 103 (Loci 103, 105, 108, 136, 148, 151, 153, 154, 182, 192, 198, 207, 240) A large open courtyard surrounded Temple 1 18 of Stratum IX on its eastern, northern and western sides. Its original measurements are unknown since the floor was destroyed by erosion on the north and east, while on the west it continued beyond the limits of the excavated area. The pavement was preserved for 5.00 m east of the temple, 10 m north of it and 4.50 m west of it. Some 280 sq. m of this floor have been exposed in the excavations; it was laid over the partition walls and rooms of the courtyards of Stratum X, and cancelled them. East and northeast of the temple (Loci 103, 105, 153), the floor was only slightly above the floor of the previous stratum, with a thin layer of brown earth separating the two (Pis. 2:2; 17:1; 18:1). Here the floor is of several thin layers of lime. It abuts the eastern wall (508) of the temple, and rises to the east. In the northeast, the floor reaches a strip of small stones laid parallel to the eastern boundary wall (529) of the Stratum X courtyard (PI. 17:1). This floor was found overlying the northern boundary wall (563) of Stratum X and thus both walls can be assumed to have gone out of use in Stratum IX. In Locus 103, the layers of lime forming the floor are 0.25 m thick. At the center of this area there was an installation (108), made of a large stone slab surrounded by an irregular circle of stones ( 1.45 m in diameter; Pl. 1 8: 1). In the floor east of this installation, there was a circular depression 2.00 m in diameter, sunk to a depth of 0.07-0. 10 m. The installation may be explained as a sacrificial altar, similar in function to the altar of Stratum X which was covered by the floor of Stratum IX. On the northern edge of the area, meager remains of a wall (582) may be an indication of a boundary wall enclosing the courtyard on that flank. North of the temple entrance (Locus 105), the floor, 0.12-0.15 m thick, was laid 0.40 m above the Stratum X floor, a layer of brown brick debris separating the two. The floor covers Walls 531 and 530 of Stratum X and it, in turn, is overlaid by walls of Stratum VIII (Pis. 18; 19:2). Above the northern section of Room 204 of Stratum X, the floor is made of layers of lime, laid over a fill of stone debris (Section F-F). These stones were found on both sides of Wall 520, and it is not clear whether they rep- resent the collapse of the upper part of this wall at the end of Stratum X, or whether they were an intentional fill for the floor of Stratum IX. Above the southern part of Room 204, where the stone fill disappears, the Stratum IX floor was of a layer of kurkar , 0.10 m thick (Locus 148). This floor met the northern, repaired wall of the temple, as well as the top of the eastern wall (530) of Room 204; but it covers the top of the western wall (536) of Room 204 and continues westward over part of Stratum X, Courtyard 235 (PI. 20:5). On the north, the kurkar floor ( 148) was a direct continuation of the lime floor of the open area (103), and was preserved for some 6.00 m for a width of 1.50 m. The original kurkar floor was overlaid by a second layer of kurkar , 0.10 m higher in level. This strip of beaten kurkar seems to have been intended to strengthen the floor of the open area along the northern wall of the temple, and to protect the latter from erosion. The beaten lime floor of the open area continues north and west of the temple and gradually slopes to the northwest. In Locus 207 (PI. 24:1), three floor layers were found above the debris of Stratum X. Each floor consists of a 0.02 m thick layer of lime covered by accumulated grey earth; the total thickness of this layer is 0.25 m. It was covered by an accumulation of soft grey material, which reaches the surface. This area was disturbed by pits cut during the Iron Age II (in Square 74 B3), the Persian period 51</page><page sequence="57">CHAPTER SIX (in Square 74 B2) and the Byzantine period (in Square 74 A3). In Locus 240, the floor of Stratum IX covers the fallen bricks of Stratum X Wall 579 and abuts Wall 591 (Section D-D). The latter wall was built of red clay bricks similar to those used for the repair of the temple in Stratum IX. In the northern part of the locus, a poorly preserved oven was found (Locus 217). Northwest and west of the temple (Loci 154, 192, 198), the floor was of an accumulation of layers of lime, totalling 0.50 m in thickness. In Loci 240 and 198, two major lime layers could be defined; both had sunk into Pit 303 of the previous stratum (PI. 23:4) and both were overlaid by Stratum VIII walls. In Locus 192, the floor met the uppermost course of stone Wall 532 and descends to the west over the thick brick debris of Stratum X covering Courtyard 194 and Shrine 300 (Sections B-B, C-C; Pis. 5:1; 13:4; 16:5). On this floor, another poorly preserved oven was found. The lime floor of this open area was preserved up to the southern edge of Square 64 C2. South of this, all remains of Stratum IX disappeared, due to Iron Ag√© II pits and Byzantine foundations. The finds in the open area were sparse and were mainly sherds and animal bones. This extensive open area resembles the open courtyards surrounding the temples of the previous strata, yet while in Stratum X the courtyards were well defined by boundary walls, that of Stratum IX was a large unenclosed area similar to that of Strata XII-XI. The stone in- stallation in Locus 108, and the two ovens built on the pavement, would point to cultic activities taking place here. The fact that the floor was repaired twice indicates a considerable life-span for Stratum IX, probably no less than several decades. BUILDING 169 (Section E-E; Pis. 27-28) (Loci 123, 169, 177, 189, 236) South of the temple, building remains of Stratum IX were preserved only in a narrow strip. Erosion and later building activity had destroyed the other remains east and west of this strip. The preserved remains show that a radical change in planning had taken place here in Stratum IX. Street 224 of Stratum X had gone out of use and a new building (169) was constructed partly above it. In the northern part of this building, Stratum X walls were repaired on a slightly different line, using bricks of black alluvial clay. Wall 539 was built over Wall 541 of the previous stratum, with a slight shift to the west, so that the new wall partly covered the silo and the storage-jars in Stratum X, Room 168 (PI. 26:3). Wall 539 forms a corner with Wall 542, built over Wall 549 of the previous stratum. A thin lime floor (123b) meets Wall 542 on its northern face; the floor was found close to the surface and was disturbed by a late trench. A group of storage-jars (lower parts only) was found on the floor (PI. 27:1). On the north, this floor probably reached Wall 522 which may well have continued in this stratum, but such a tie could not be verified. South of Wall 542, a large area (169) was paved with kurkar slabs, some of which were as large as 0.80 m in length (Pis. 26:3, top; 27:5; 28:2). This floor was preserved for a length of 6.85 m and a width of 2.00 m. As noted on the north it is enclosed by brick Walls 542 and 539, and on the south by a stone wall (576) preserved to a height of two courses and to a length of 7.20 m (Pl. 28: lj. Another stone wall (577) abuts the latter wall and forms two rooms to the south, continuing beyond the limits of the ex- cavated area. These two stone walls were built over Stratum X, Street 224. The foundation of Wall 577 is slightly higher than the earlier street, while Wall 576 cut partly into the pavement and is partly built directly upon it. Floor 169 itself was laid directly upon the kurkar floor of Stratum X Loci 258 and 306. This large stone floor was probably part of a storeroom or shed within a courtyard of a building, the full plan of which is unknown. Another small fragment of Stratum IX structures was discovered in Square 64 A4. A small part of a stone wall (571) was preserved to one course only, and a lime floor meeting the wall on the west (Locus 270) was constructed over Wall 572 of Stratum X. A group of pottery vessels, including a storage-jar, a chalice and a globular jug, was found on this floor in a layer of ash which was covered by a layer of brick debris. East of Wall 571 the northern half of a circular silo was discovered (Locus 226, Pis. 24:3; 28:3), built of small stones; its diameter is 2.25 m, and its walls were found standing to a height of 0.50 m. A similar silo was found in Building W (Area A), in a Stratum IX courtyard. These remains were part of a building which had extended south- ward, beyond the excavated area. CONCLUSIONS Although the buildings of Stratum IX were poorly preserved, the general development of the settlement can be ascertained. After a gap, following the de- 52</page><page sequence="58">STRATUM IX: REBUILDING OF THE RUINED SANCTUARY struction of Stratum X, the area was rebuilt; the temple was repaired and probably continued to serve in its original function. The complex of Stratum X courtyards, including Shrine 300, the single rooms and boundary walls, went out of use and were replaced by a large paved area surrounding the temple on three sides. This was probably a public piazza, used for cult practices around the temple. South of the temple, houses were built on a new ground plan. The town planning of Stratum X underwent a radical change, as is illustrated by the building over Street 224. A similar process was observed in Area A, where a major street of Stratum X (Street A) was no longer used in Stratum IX and adjacent dwellings were built on a different plan. The finds in Stratum IX were sparse, yet a small group of complete vessels (from Loci 123 and 270), as well as a collection of sherds (from the floors of the open area), provide a basis for the dating of this stratum to the first half of the tenth century B.C.

Byzantine constructions and erosion have destroyed almost all the remains in the southern half of the excavated area, as well as on the eastern and northeastern sides. Fragmentary building remains of this stratum were found only in the northern part of the temple, as well as in the northwestern corner of the area. THE TEMPLE Remains of stone construction, later than the floors of Stratum IX, show that the temple was repaired in Stratum VIII. Wall 508, the eastern wall of the temple in Strata X-IX, was reconstructed on the same lines (Wall 501), of which only one course of stones was preserved (Pis. 8:7, below; 17:1, on the left). This course is partly of large stones (0.40 X 0.40 m), laid over the upper brick course of the pre- vious wall. The wall, 1.30 m thick, was preserved to a length of 3.20 m, and was found just below the surface. Above the northern end of the earlier wall (508), the new wall was built of two large stones, each 0.80 m long (PI. 19:2, upper left). The wall continues northward, beyond the limit of the pre- vious temples. This extension (501) is only 1.00 m thick; it was built over the floor of the open court- yard of Stratum IX, and indicates a change in plan of this area in Stratum VIII. The northern wall of the previous temple (511) was buttressed in Stratum VIII by a revetment wall (512), made of a row of large stones, each 0.70-0.80 m long (Pis. 1:1, left; 22:1, right). This wall was built over the kurkar floor (148) along the outer face of Wall 5 1 1, which probably continued without change. We have no other data concerning the temple of Stratum VIII. No specific floor was found within the building, and all its southern and western parts were missing; yet it would seem that the two building re- mains just described would suffice to conclude that the temple was still in existence in this stratum. THE AREA SURROUNDING THE TEMPLE East of the temple a layer of kurkar gravel (Locus 107; see Sections A-A, B-B, C-C) meets the upper course of Wall 508, above the debris on the Stratum IX floors. The layer was found just below the surface soil; it contained no sherds and lacked any true surface. It may be explained as a fill, intended to strengthen the lower, outer face of the wall originally built in Stratum X and now serving as a foundation for the new wall of Stratum VIII. The kurkar fill may originally have been higher, carrying a floor of the Stratum VIII courtyard. A foundation of a stone wall (502) forms a corner with the northern wall of the temple (PI. 1:1 left; 17:1). The new wall is 1.25 m thick, the one course being preserved to a length of 3.70 m. It was built over Floors 105 and 148 of Stratum IX, and in line with the northern wall of the temple (Pis. 1:1, left; the parallel Wall 501, two fragments of thin lime floors were found (Locus 104), on a level higher than the floor of Stratum IX. This area apparently re- mained unroofed, forming a sort of a porch leading into the temple. West of Wall 502 and north of Wall 512, a large area (196) was found paved with a beaten earth floor (Section G-G); the latter contained many sherds and animal bones. The sherds show signs of weathering, as if they had been exposed on the surface for a long time. Such a picture is reflected in the typological study of the pottery, which seems to show that the site was deserted for several hundred years, following the destruction of Stratum VIII. The floor descends to the northwest and at its eastern edge (Locus 1 1 9) it is 0.90 m higher than some 9.00 m to the west. Layers of grey earth had accumulated above the well-preserved floor, which meets Wall 552 on the north and continues beyond the excavated area to the west. Floor 196 is part of a large open area, similar to the one of the previous stratum. Wall 552 encloses the open area on the north and forms a corner with Wall 575, of which only a length 55</page><page sequence="61">CHAPTER SEVEN of 2.00 m is preserved (PI. 22:1). Wall 552 itself is preserved to a length of 4.00 m and to a height of four courses. These two walls probably formed the southeastern corner of a building which has been almost completely destroyed by erosion and by Persian pits. This corner supersedes a previous building phase, to which two earlier walls (611, 559) can be attributed: Wall 611, a single row of large stones, each 0.80 m long; and Wall 559, built of smaller stones. Two floors were found north of Wall 611; the lower one (Locus 212) made of kurkar , meeting Wall 611; and the upper one (208), a few centimeters higher, possibly reaching Wall 552 (though this tie-up is not clear). The two corners clearly belong to two different building phases, yet both of them were built above the earliest phase of the Stratum IX courtyard here (see Section H-H). Both may be attributed to secondary phases within Stratum VIII or, alternatively, Walls 611 and 559 were constructed during the span of Stratum IX, contemporaneous with the rebuilding of the floors in the open area of that stratum. We may recall that, in two buildings in Area A (Buildings K and J), two separate building phases were attributed to Stratum IX, which was divided by the excavators into separate phases (IX 1 and IX 2). In our case it was impossible to determine whether the early phase (611, 559) should be attributed to a later phase of Stratum IX or to an early phase of Stratum VIII. Extension of the excavations to the west may provide a solution. At the northern end of the excavated area, in Squares 74 B3-4, a small portion of building was exposed below the surface soil (PI. 20:4). It includes a narrow stone wall (562), preserved to a length of 2.20 m, which extends northward beyond the limits of the excavations. On the west, a floor of large stone slabs (Locus 218) meets this wall; it was preserved over an area of 2.20 x 2.20 m and also extends northwards. The floor was found covered by stone debris containing Iron Age and some Byzantine sherds. This building fragment, constructed over the floors of Stratum IX, is either part of a Stratum VIII building or a trace of a much later building (probably of the Byzantine period). Its proximity to the surface, and the mixed pottery found above its floor, preclude a more positive dating. South of the temple, only two small floor frag- ments of Stratum VIII were preserved. One was found in Square 65 CI, 0.30 m above Floor 123 of Stratum IX (Locus 123a, in the plan); the other (Locus 164) was found in the southeastern corner of Square 65 B1 above stone Floor 169 of Stratum IX. Both floors were of a thin layer of lime; no significant finds were uncovered on them. No walls could be attributed to Stratum VIII in this area, and it is not known if Stratum IX walls continued in use in Stratum VIII. CONCLUSIONS Although the remains of Stratum VIII are frag- mentary and poorly preserved, we feel they are sufficient to determine that the temple was repaired in this stratum and continued to exist in its original function. The area north of the temple was re- organized, new walls being built above the open courtyard of Stratum IX. In the northwestern corner of the area, a new building (probably a dwelling) was constructed. The two phases observed in this building can be attributed either to Stratum VIII alone, or to an upper phase of Stratum IX and to Stratum VIII, respectively. No evidence of violent destruction was found in this stratum, but the small fragments pre- served, and their proximity to the surface, prevent a clear understanding of the nature of their end. The finds from this stratum in Area C were very meager and included mainly sherds collected in the open area (196) and a few vessels found on Floors 218 and 212. Following the destruction of Stratum VIII, the settlement seems to have been abandoned, remaining unsettled for a long period. This conclusion, based on the pottery typology, finds support in the fact that the sherds from the floor of the open area (196) were found weathered, apparently having been exposed for a considerable length of time. 56</page><page sequence="62">STRATUM VIII: THE FINAL REBUILDING OF THE SANCTUARY TABLE 9.

The layers included sherds from the end of the Iron Age, though some loci contained mixed material from the end of the Iron Age and later periods. Two square rock-cut pits found west of the mound contained pottery from the end of the Iron Age. No similar remains were identified in Area A, on the southern part of the mound. In the renewed stratigraphical analysis of the finds in Area A, it became clear to us that the poor remains attributed by the original excavators to Stratum VII do not justify the definition of a separate stratum and can readily be explained as part of Stratum VIII buildings. The pottery attributed to Stratum VII in Area A is no later than the 10th century B.C. and should be attributed to the redated Stratum VIII there. The term Stratum VII is thus free for use in defining the new period represented only in Area C. (However, in order to avoid confusion with the re- ports of the previous excavations, the term here has been placed in quotation marks.) THE ACCUMULATIONS OF EARTH IN AREA C (Loci 117, 121, 138, 158, 178, 179) These six loci numbers were given to ac- cumulations of earth not containing any structural remains, but found above the remains of Strata IX- VIII. In Locus 121, above the center of the temple of the previous stratum, the accumulation of soft, light brown earth is 0.90 m thick and was found close to the surface (Sections B-B, F-F; Pis. 13:1-2). The black ash layer above Wall 517 contained pot- tery from the end of the seventh century B.C. The accumulation above this ash layer is 0.50 m thick (Section A- A; PI. 13:1, on the right). In Locus 121, the accumulation was thinner at the northern end of the area, eventually disappearing through erosion, near the top of Wall 512. Above the southern part of the temple, the accumulation of Locus 121 was cut by a late trench (122) which passed through the area from east to west (Section F-F). South of this trench, the accumulation of "Stratum VII" appears again, over the destruction layer of Stratum X in Building 225 (Locus 158, Section F-F; PI. 2:1, right). No remains of Strata IX- VIII were discovered in this area, and they had probably been destroyed by erosion or human activity, prior to the seventh century B.C. The accumulation in this area, 0.90-1.30 m thick, was disturbed by a Persian pit (Locus 162), and in the west it was destroyed by Byzantine foundations. East and south of Locus 158, it was completely eroded away. Loci 121 and 158 are the only ones in which the accumulation of earth contained homogeneous pottery solely from the end of the Iron Age. The accumulated earth in these two loci seems to have been formed through the dumping of refuse here, above the temple and Building 225, at the end of the seventh century B.C. Another possibility is that these layers are wash layers of structures which had stood atop the mound. Other loci contained unstratified earth with mixed pottery from the end of the Iron Age as well as from late periods. Locus 138, in the northwestern part of the area (PI. 5:1, top of baulk), is an accumulation of earth post-dating Floor 152 of Stratum VIII. The debris contained mixed pottery from the Iron Age and Roman-Byzantine periods. Locus 117, above the southwestern corner of Temple 131, contained similar mixed material, as well as pottery from the Middle Ages connected with the digging of Well 165. This is a later intrusion, which penetrates to 0.50 m above the floor of Temple 131 of Stratum X (Section G-G). Many sherds from the end of the Iron Age were found also in Loci 178 and 179, which con- tained disturbed earth accumulations between the 58</page><page sequence="64">"STRATUM VII": A LATE IRON AGE OCCUPATIONAL PHASE foundations of the Byzantine bath in the western part of the area. PITS Four pits in Area C can be attributed to the end of the Iron Age. Pit 183 This pit was found somewhat north of the temple entrance. It cuts through Floor 104 of Stratum VIII and Floor 105 of Stratum IX (PI. 10:1). The finds in it were few, but since no sherds later than the Iron Age were found, the pit should be attributed to "Stratum VII". Pit 189 This was a very small, circular pit in Square 65 B1 which cut throught Locus 123 of Stratum IX and disturbed Wall 542 (PI. 17:1). The pit was empty of finds and its attribution to "Stratum VII" is tentative. Pit 294 A large pit cut into the brick debris and walls of Shrine 300 and Building 225 (Section H-H; PI. 14:2, above), containing soft, light brown earth with some sherds from the end of the Iron Age. The foundations of the Byzantine bath-house were built above this pit. Pit 305 This pit is similar to the preceding one; it cuts the southwestern corner of Building 225, and was built over by Byzantine walls. It also contained Late Iron Age sherds. ROCK-CUTTINGS ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE MOUND During the construction of a road, west of Tell Qasile and south of the Laskey Planetarium, two rock- cuttings came to light. Both were excavated during the 1973 season and subsequently were dated to the end of the Iron Age. Locus 313 A square pit, measuring 1.40 X 1.50 m, was hewn to was destroyed by road construction; the three other was destroyed by road construction, the three other walls are vertical and the floor is flat. On the floor there was a group of broken pottery vessels from the end of the Iron Age, which comprises the most im- portant group from this period at Tell Qasile. Locus 318 This is square pit similar to the above, measuring 1.88 X 2.17 m, and is 1.50 m deep. It is situated 1.10 m south of the previous pit. The finds were sparse, consisting merely of a few sherds. The function of these two rock-cuttings is not clear. They are not graves, and can possibly be in- terpreted as agricultural installations. CONCLUSIONS Following the destruction of Stratum VIII, the sacred area of Tell Qasile went out of use and the site was abandoned during the 9th, 8th and most of the 7th centuries B.C. The pottery from the end of the Iron Age in the earth accumulations and pits in Area C, and in the installations west of the mound, show that the site was resettled for a brief period at the end of the 7th century B.C. Since this period was not identified in the other areas of excavation on the site, it appears that the new settlement covered a very small area and comprised a few buildings on the top of the mound. Area C probably became an open area in which refuse pits were dug. The earth accumulations illustrate either the intentional dump- ing of refuse in this period, or they are the wash layers of material denuded from the top of the mound. The similarity of the pottery found in this stratum to the Judean pottery of the 7th century B.C. may point to the possibility that the foundation of this small, short-lived settlement is to be connected with the expansion of Judah to the coast during the reign of Josiah.1 59</page><page sequence="65">CHAPTER EIGHT TABLE 11.

In view of the problems connected with the origins of the Philistines, and the eclectic nature of their culture,1 it is most significant to determine whether the temples at Tell Qasile ascribe to any previous architectural traditions. Accordingly, we shall briefly survey the parallels to other temples discovered in Palestine, Syria, Cyprus and the Aegean region. THE CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF THE TELL QASILE TEMPLES (compare Figs. 13-14, p. 47) During the nearly two-century span of Strata XII-X, three main temples were consequently built, one over the other. They vary in many details of plan (see Fig. 13), a fact which is unusual in sacred places in the ancient Near East where, in within such a short period, temples usually retained their basic plan. However, some principles of planning were retained throughout all three temples at Tell Qasile: (1) The temples are not monumental structures. The earliest one, which is also the smallest, is no more than a single, medium-sized hall. The largest one, Temple 131 of Stratum X, is no larger than an average dwelling of the same stratum (such as Building 225, south of it). (2) The temples are not free-standing buildings, but are integrated into the town-plan, being attached on the south to a group of buildings and thus together forming an insula surrounded by streets. (3) All of the temples (including Shrine 300) are oriented toward the west-southwest, the holy-of- holies being situated on the west. (4) The location of the entrances to the temples is not consistent; while in Stratum XII the entrance is at the center of the eastern wall, in Stratum XI it shifts to the northern part of the eastern wall, and in Stratum X the wide entrance is located on the northern wall of a newly-built ante-chamber. While in Strata XII-XI the approach to the temples is direct, Temple 131 of Stratum X and Shrine 300 of Strata XI X have a "bent-axis" approach, preventing a direct view of the holy-of-holies from the outside. (5) The temples of Strata XII-XI comprise single architectural units. The proportions of the main hall (cella) are almost square. Temple 131 of Stratum X has the outer proportions of a long-building, yet the main hall (cella), that is, the area between Walls 517 and 551, is still almost square. Thus, the three temples of Strata XII-X each have a cella of similar proportions. (6) The location of the holy-of-holies remained basically unchanged throughout Strata XII-X. In the temples of Strata XII and X, as well as in Shrine 300, it was built as a raised, stepped platform of brick, plastered on all sides. The form of the holy-of- holies in the temple of Stratum XI is unclear; above, we have discussed two possibilities, as either a niche or a raised platform. (7) In the temples of Strata XI-X, and perhaps also in the temple of Stratum XII, a small room was formed in the western end of the building, used for storage of cult objects and offering vessels. It was probably also used as the "treasury" of the temple. (8) In all of the temples, benches of plastered brick were built along the walls. (9) The roofing of the temples in Strata XII-XI was achieved without internal support. The en- largement of the temple in Stratum X necessitated the erection of two pillars to support the roof; these were of cedar, standing on cylindrical stone bases placed at regular intervals along the long, central axis of the building. The location of the entrance to the main hall, and of the raised platform at the northern half of the hall, enabled a direct view of the raised platform without the interference of the pillars. (10) The burnt remains of wood in the Stratum X temple show that entrances, door-frames and the like were of wood. The two samples examined proved to be of cedar, probably brought from the Lebanon. 61</page><page sequence="67">CHAPTER NINE COMPARATIVE DISCUSSION OF THE PLAN OF THE TEMPLES The Levant Although several studies have been devoted to a synthesis of the development of temple architecture in the Levant, these attempts have been faced with major difficulties and some of the suggestions there are rather obscure.2 A survey of the Bronze and Iron Age temples in Israel and Syria shows that many of them are monumental buildings, generally larger than the contemporaneous dwellings and usually free- standing. The plan of most of these buildings is symmetrical, with the entrance opposite the holy-of- holies; these buildings can be divided along their main axis into two similar parts. These general features can be found in various temples from the Early Bronze Age to the Iron Age.3 In some of them the cella (the main hall) is a broad room, while in others it is a long room. This major group includes most of the important temples in the urban centers of the Levant during the Bronze and Iron Ages. The temples at Tell Qasile differ from this group in most respects, and it is in other traditions of temple ar- chitecture that we are to seek their parallels. A symmetrical plan with a direct approach char- acterized only one of the temples of Tell Qasile: Temple 319 of Stratum XII. However, this is a small building, hardly monumental like the buildings men- tioned above. Among the temples discovered in the Land of Israel, there are very few examples which can be related to this temple, the common features being only the symmetrical plans and the comparatively small dimensions. Two early ex- amples, probably having no direct relation to our building, are the Early Bronze Age II shrine at Tell el-Far'ah (N),4 and a Middle Bronze Age IIB temple (?) discovered at Giv'at Sharet near Beth-Shemesh.5 A closer example is perhaps the small temple in Area C at Hazor (Fig. 15:B),6 from the Late Bronze Age II, which can be compared with Building 319 at Tell Qasile in its dimensions (the outer dimensions of the structure in Hazor, Stratum la are 5.20 x 5.80 m), the entrance at the center of the eastern wall and the benches along the walls. However, the holy-of-holies is built differently, and the use of the stelae shows a different cult. Either way, this temple is the closest parallel to that of Stratum XII of Tell Qasile. Two other temples should be mentioned in this connection: the temple at Timna7 which, in its original phase (13th century B.C.), was a broad- building (8 X 10 m) with the entrance at the center of the eastern wall and, in its second phase (the period of Rameses III), was extended to 10 X 10 m. According to the excavator's interpretation, it re- mained unroofed. This is not surprising, consider- ing the climate of this area. The general plan of the temple and the raised platform in the holy-of- holies recall Temple 319 at Tell Qasile, built slightly after the destruction of the temple at Timna. In spite of the many Egyptian finds at Timna, no ar- chitectural parallel can be found for it in Egypt, and the building probably reflects a Canaanite tradition.8 The temple at Arad, the only Iron Age II temple so far discovered in Israel,9 is composed of a broad-room (cella) and a holy-of-holies in the form of a niche ( adyton ). It is possible that this unique temple reflects, in a varied form, the architectural tradition of the latter-mentioned group of temples.10 Thus, Temple 319 at Tell Qasile can be considered (with much caution) as part of a small group of temples of the Bronze and Iron Ages in the Land of Israel, sharing the common feature of a direct entrance at the center of the eastern side of a broad cella of comparatively small size. It is interesting to note that in three of the temples of this group (Hazor, Timna and Arad) stelae were found within. This may indicate a common cult practiced in those particular temples. Temple 200 of Stratum XI at Tell Qasile is of unique plan, unparalleled in other temples in Israel. Some similarity can be found in the contem- poraneous northern temple at Beth-Shan, Stratum V (Fig. 15:F),n in which the entrance is similarly arranged at the corner of the edifice; yet an ar- rangement of an entrance room (?) and four pillars within the building is not present in Temple 200. (The form of the holy-of-holies in the northern temple at Beth-Shan is unknown.) A similar arrangement of an entrance at the corner of the main hall is also found in Fosse Temples II- III at Lachish (Fig. 15:D),12 as well as in the temple at Tel Mevorach (Fig. 15:E).13 All of these temples are of irregular plan, dif- ferentiating them from the main group of Canaanite temples, which display a symmetric plan, as mentioned above. Temple 131 of Stratum X is also unique; no similar buildings have been found in Israel. However, many details find parallels in the comparatively small group of Canaanite temples of irregular plan. The closest parallels can be found in the Fosse Temples at Lachish where, as at Tell Qasile, three successive 62</page><page sequence="68">COMPARATIVE STUDY OF TEMPLE ARCHITECTURE Fig. 15. Schematic plans of various temples in Canaan, Cyprus and the Aegean. 63</page><page sequence="69">CHAPTER NINE temples were built during the Late Bronze Age, without any change in the location of the holy-of- holies or the orientation. The layout of Fosse Temples II- III has the same units as the temple at Tell Qasile: ante-chamber (Room A), main hall (cella), and a back room (Room F; which is analogous to Room 188 at the back of the Tell Qasile temple). In both cases the entrance is indirect, though a real "bent-axis" approach exists only in Temple I at Lachish (Fig. 15 :C). Fosse Temples II-III have a corner entrance, recalling the entrance of Temple 200 at Tell Qasile. The interior details of the Lachish temples also recall Tell Qasile Temple 131. The inner proportions of the cella of our temple (not taking into account Room 188) are similar to those of Fosse Temples II-III. In both, benches were built along the walls, the holy-of-holies is in the form of a raised, stepped platform, and the roof was supported bv wooden pillars resting on stone bases. The ar- rangement of two pillars along the long axis of the building in Fosse Temple I recalls the similar ar- rangement in Temple 131 at Tell Qasile. Thus, Temple 131 at Tell Qasile at least seems to reflect the Late Bronze Age tradition represented in the Fosse Temples at Lachish. Another example of this same Late Bronze Age tradition is found in the temple at Tel Mevorach, mentioned above. This building, oriented to the west, has an indirect approach, benches along the walls, a raised, stepped platform, and probably had wooden, pillars to support its roof. This example, from the Late Bronze Age I, lacks an ante-chamber and a room at the back, yet it may be attributed to the same group of temples of irregular plan and common characteristic features. The temples in Strata VII-V at Beth-Shan also share many similarities with the temples at Lachish and Tell Qasile. The temple of Stratum VII, built during the 13th century B.C,14 has architectural elements recalling those which characterize the Fosse Temples at Lachish and Temple 131 at Tell Qasile: ante-chamber, cella , holy-of-holies (built as a rep- arate adyton' and a small room at the back. The entrance is indirect and the holy-of-holies is off the central axis. Benches were built along the walls, and two pillars supported the roof. In Stratum VI of the 12th century B.C. the Beth-Shan temple was rebuilt, with an additional entrance room and a modified holy-of-holies, which now faced the center of the building (Fig. 15:H).15 These temples recall in some aspects the large Canaanite temple which was recently excavated at Lachish.16 Although the temples at Beth-Shan VII-VI resemble in some aspects those at Tell Qasile and Lachish, they stand unique in their layout and interior arrangemnts. The two temples of Beth-Shan, Stratum V are con- temporaneous with the temples at Tell Qasile.17 The "Basilical" plan of the southern temple is un- paralleled; the arrangement of the pillars and their heterogeneous character raises a suspicion that the building underwent fundamental changes prior to its final phase, when it was probably converted into a storehouse (as James has suggested). Therefore, its original plan cannot be determined. The plan of the northern temple is even more obscure (see above), yet it is clear that this building had an indirect entrance.18 The fact that cult objects were found in it, and that the plan comprised one main hall, indicates that the building served as a temple (as the original excavators claimed, and in contrast to James's proposal, that it was an administrative building). The uniqueness of the Beth-Shan temples can be ex- plained in light of the unique history of that city, which served as an Egyptian garrison-town manned by foreign mercenaries. Amalgamation of Canaanite and Egyptian traditions created new architectural forms, displaying variations from the schematic traditions of both Egyptian and Canaanite ar- chitecture. Two other buildings dated to the transition from the Late Bronze Age to the Iron Age may tentatively be identified as temples. One is Building 30 of Stratum IV at Tell Abu Hawam (Fig. 15:G),19 a rebuilding of Building 50, probably the temple of Stratum V. Building 30 comprises a large hall, probably with pillars,20 and a small corner room. (This plan somewhat recalls that of the temple at Enkomi, in which the bronze figurine of the "cop- per god" was discovered; see below, p. 67.)21 The second building is the "lion temple" excavated at Jaffa.22 This is a poorly preserved structure and the paucity of finds in it has made its identification as a temple uncertain. However, the appearance of two pillar bases along the long axis of a large hall recalls, on the one hand, the arrangement of the pillars in Temple 131 at Tell Qasile and, on the other hand, several buildings of cultic character in the Aegean, from the end of the Mycenaean period (such as Building G at Asine; see below, p. 67). The ex- cavators dated the building to the "late 13th-early 12th century B.C., that is, contemporary with the conjectured period of invasion of the Sea Peoples, 64</page><page sequence="70">COMPARATIVE STUDY OF TEMPLE ARCHITECTURE prior to the Philistine occupation of the Tel Aviv- Jaffa part of the coast". If the date and the cultural attribution are correct, we can regard the building at Jaffa as a link between the Aegean traditions and the architecture of Temple 131 at Tell Qasile. However, according to the excavators, the holy-of-holies was near the western long room of the building. In this case, the general plan differs from that of the temple . at Tell Qasile. Finally, we should mention a cult room which was discovered in Stratum 3a at Ashdod, of the Iron Age II.23 It has an L -shaped cella with a raised platform and a bench behind. According to the excavator, the ehtrance was in the southeastern corner, above the bench. However, it is more logical to assume that the sole entrance was from Room 1003, and that the bench behind the raised platform (which is separated from the rest of the hall by Wall 1030) was part of a small room in the back of the building, similar to the rooms in the temples at Tell Qasile. This cultic structure, which had an indirect entrance, was prob- ably part of a large building. The above-mentioned temples can be grouped un- der the classification "temples with irregular plan and indirect access". In the following table some of the data concerning these temples is assembled: TABLE 12. TEMPLES WITH IRREGULAR PLAN AND INDIRECT ACCESS.

This group should not be taken as homogeneous, and the temples of Tell Qasile, Strata XI-X are certainly not identical to any one of these temples, yet there are several common features: their pro- portional dimensions, the thickness of the walls, the corner entrances, the indirect access to the holy- of-holies, the benches along the walls, the pillars carrying the roof, the raised platform, and the back chambers, are all features common to many of the buildings in this group, including those at Tell Qasile. Most of these features are lacking in the main group of Canaanite temples, the symmetrical monumental buildings mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. The latter was the major temple type amongst the West-Semitic population of the Levant from the 3rd to the 1st millennia B.C. On the other hand, the group of irregular temples (to which the Tell Qasile temples are related) form an exception to this main group. In at least two cases, such temples can be 65</page><page sequence="71">CHAPTER NINE attributed to non-Canaanite populations: at Beth- Shan, to an Egyptian garrison or to Aegean or other foreign mercenaries serving in the Egyptian garrison; and at Tell Qasile, to a Philistine (or other "Sea People") population. The "Lion Temple" at Jaffa, if indeed it was a temple, may also have been built by foreign mercenaries in service at the adjacent Egyptian fortress. The Fosse Temples at Lachish were built outside the actual city and therefore may tentatively be attributed to foreigners, who were not an integral part of the Canaanite population of the city. The temple at Tel Mevorach is an isolated building on a small site which, during the Late Bronze Age, could have served as harbour for foreign merchants and traders. We are inclined, therefore, to attribute the irregular temples in Palestine to the non- Canaanite population, while the symmetric buildings with direct entrance, as at Hazor, Megiddo and Shechem, continued to be the main temple type in Canaan. The attaching of a small shrine (300) to the main temple at Tell Qasile is almost unparalleled in the cultic architecture of the Levant, the closest parallels being the small temples built around the Dagan temple at Mari, during the 18th century B.C.,2,4 the cluster of temples at Kition built during the 13th- 1th centuries B.C. (see below, p. 67), and the small shrine adjacent to the main shrine in the Mycenaean cultic complex at Phylakopi (see below). The plan of Shrine 300 can be paralleled to those of two other small shrines: the cult chamber in Stratum V at Lachish (10th century B.C.),25 and the Iron Age II temple discovered at Sarepta on the Phoenician coast.26 The cult chamber at Lachish measures 2.30 X 3.30 m; its entrance is near the center of the northern wall, and there is a raised platform in the southwestern corner. These features resemble Shrine 300, as do the cult objects there, which included four cylindrical stands and two cultic bowls. This cultic chamber was probably used by the Israelites under the United Kingdom. The temple at Sarepta, which is partly built of ashlar stones, measures 2.50 X 6.20 m internally. It has a "bent- axis" entrance, a raised platform near the western end (wrongly termed "an offering table" by the ex- cavator) and benches along the walls. All these features are shared by the shrine at Tell Qasile, which is the earliest of this series and is the only one attached to a larger temple. The Aegean Region Our knowledge of temple architecture in the Minoan and Mycenaean cultures is sparse.27 Cultic rituals were practised in the palaces or in chapels con- structed within the palace complexes. However, the few buildings which can be identified as temples have interesting features parallel to those of the temples at Tell Qasile. A cultic complex in the citadel of Mycenae is dated to the end of the 13th century B.C. (Mycenaean IIIB2).28 The eastern building of this complex (Fig. 15:0) is a rather small structure (5.60 X 11.80 m), with an ante-chamber leading to a squarish cella having benches, wooden pillars and stepped platforms. Two small chambers at the back served as storage space for cult objects. This temple, unique in the Mycenaean sphere, in many aspects resembles the Fosse Temple at Lachish and Temple 131 at Tell Qasile. The second building in the complex has a large hall leading into a small cultic chamber, with a "bent-axis" entrance, benches and a raised platform. This combination of main temple and subsidiary cultic chamber is also reminiscent of the Tell Qasile complex. Another Mycenaean sanctuary has recently been excavated at Phylakopi (Melos) (Fig. 15:P).29 It consists of a main temple ("West Shrine") and a subsidiary shrine ("East Shrine"). The "West Shrine" (6.00 X 6.60 m) recalls our Temple 200 (Stratum XI) in size and orientation. The small chambers at its west side, used for storing cult objects, recall the similar chamber at Tell Qasile. It is not clear, however, where the holy-of-holies was located: whether within the main hall, along its western wall, or in Room B, west of the main hall. In the first case, it would be very similar to the Tell Qasile temples. The "East Shrine" (2.20 X 4.80 m) recalls in size and plan our Shrine 300. It is a subsidiary shrine, attached to the main temple, having a "bent-axis" entrance, as in Shrine 300. The "East Shrine" was founded toward the end of the 13th century B.C. and continued in use, together with the "West Shrine", throughout the Mycenaean UIC period, until it was destroyed in c. 1120 B.C. Since this date almost corresponds to the foundation of Stratum XI at Tell Qasile, the resemblance between the two sanctuaries gains significance. Relations between the Phylakopi sanctuaries and the East Mediterranean have also been established on the basis of the Canaanite bronze figurines found on that site. In two buildings in the Mycenaean cultural sphere, 66</page><page sequence="72">COMPARATIVE STUDY OF TEMPLE ARCHITECTURE pillars are arranged on their long axis, as in Temple 131 at Tell Qasile and probably also as in the "Lion Temple" at Jaffa. One is a small megaron (5.50 X 7.50 m) at Eleusis, below the later telesterion .30 The second is House G at Asine, dated to the Mycenaean III C period. 31 In this latter hall (5.00 X 7.00 m), cult objects were found, but its identification as a true temple is unclear; Mylonas has defined it as the domos of a large dwelling. The two-pillar arrangement along the long axis of the buildings at Tell Qasile and Jaffa may thus well be an architectural element originating in the Myce√±aean culture, though this can only be a tentative sug- gestion (see below, p. 70).32 There are almost no other temples in the Mycenaean culture. Other buildings suggested as temples are only tentatively identified as such, while other isolated examples have no relation to our temples.33 The similarities between some of the Mycenaean temples and the Tell Qasile temples are prominent. The extent of architectural similarity, however, is not clear as a reflection of cultural relations. The fact that the sanctuaries at Mycenae and Phylakopi were constructed during the Mycenaean HIB phase, when relations between Greece and the Levant reached a peak, hint at the possibility of an eastern influence on their plan. The best parallels in the East, however, are the group of irregular temples in Palestine, as defined in the discussion above. As we have seen, this temple type is subsidiary to the main line of development of Canaanite temples. This closed circle of reasoning leads us to introduce the evidence from Cyprus. Cyprus The excavations at Kition and Enkomi have greatly enhanced our knowledge of Late Cypriote temple architecture. For the study of the temples at Tell Qasile, the group of temples excavated by V. Karageorghis at Kition is of especial importance.34 Two of these temples (2 and 3) were founded already during the 13th century B.C., while in the Late Cypriote III period (1200-1050 B.C.), Temples 1, 2, 4 and 5 existed contemporaneously. Temple 1 is an exceptionally large building (22.00x33.60 m) consisting of a large courtyard with a niche-like holy- of-holies at its western end. This temple is unique in plan, unparalleled at any other site. Temples 2, 4 and 5 (Fig. 15:K-M) are rectangular buildings of similar size (the smallest measuring 9.00 x 14.50 m and the largest, 1 1.00 x 22.00 m). The main area in all three temples is divided by one or two rows of pillars which, according to the excavator, form open courtyards and roofed "porticoes". In Temples 2 and 5, small rooms at the western end were identified by the excavator as the holy-of-holies, while in Temple 4 the holy-of-holies was in the niche-like space at the eastern end. The entrance to the temples is always at the corner; its location in Temples 2 and 4 resembles that of Temple 200 at Tell Qasile, while in Temple 5 it recalls that of our Temple 131. Benches built along the walls in Temples 4 and 5 also recall those at Tell Qasile. In a brief discussion on the typology of the temples of Kition, Karageorghis claims that they are of a "standard Near-Eastern type", and compares Temple 2 with the temples at Lachish, Tell el-Far'ah (N) and Tell Qasile.35 This comparison can hardly be accepted on the basis of the interpretation of the Kition temple as presented by the excavator, since the above-mentioned Palestinian temples have a large roofed cella , with a raised platform and storage chambers behind. However, the similarity between the temples of Kition and those at Lachish and Tell Qasile (compare especially Temple 5 at Kition with Temple 131 at Tell Qasile) can be accepted if we interpret Temples 2, 4 and 5 of the Late Cypriote III period as having a large roofed main hall (cella), the roof of which was supported by one or two rows of pillars. The holy-of-holies in these temples was, as at Lachish and Tell Qasile, at the end of this cella . In Temple 5, the holy-of-holies can be identified as the raised platform (called "altar" by the excavator) built of ashlar stones at the western end, in a location almost identical to that at Tell Qasile. The holy-of- holies in Temple 4 was in a niche-like space at the eastern end, opening toward the cella . Only in Temple 2 no clear remains of a holy-of-holies could be defined. The small chambers at the western end of Temples 2 and 5 can be compared with the storage chamber (188) in Temple 131 at Tell Qasile, as well as with Rooms E and F in the Lachish temple. Similar storage spaces can be found in the north- eastern corner of Temple 4, where they are built in a manner similar to that of Cell 227 in Temple 200. Only such an interpretation, in our opinion, can legitimize the architectural parallel between Temples 2, 4, 5 at Kition and the temples at Lachish and Tell Qasile. The temple at Enkomi, in which the statue of the "copper god" was found, is another example of a Late Cypriote temple (Fig. 15:N).36 It measures 67</page><page sequence="73">CHAPTER NINE 1 1.60 X 17.60 m, has benches along the walls, a small chamber in its northeastern corner and a division of the main hall by pillars and a wall. This temple is also interpreted as being partly unroofed. The location of the wide entrance at the end of the southern long wall resembles the entrance to Temple 131 at Tell Qasile, yet the rest of the plan is different. We have already mentioned the possible similarity between this temple and the contemporaneous Building 30 at Tell Abu Hawam IVa (early 12th century B.C.). Other Bronze Age cult complexes in Cyprus, such as those at Myrtos-Pigadhes, Hagia-Irini and Idalion,37 are little more than courtyards surrounded by various structures, none of which can be defined as a definite architectural type. The various cult structures known from the Cypro-Geometric and Cypro-Archaic periods38 are also unrelated to any well-defined architectural type. Conclusions Although no temples with a plan closely related to those of Tell Qasile could be defined, it is suggested that the inhabitants of the site adopted architectur- al traditions known in the cultic architecture of Palestine in the Late Bronze Age and which ap- peared in Cyprus and Mycenae in the 13th century B.C. These traditions continued to predominate in Cyprus during the 12th- 1 1th centuries B.C., con- temporaneously with the temples of Tell Qasile. This architectural tradition differs from the main line of development of temple architecture in the West- Semitic cultures of the Levant during the Bronze and Iron Ages. The relation between the appearance of the "irregular" temples in Palestine, Cyprus and the Aegean is still unclear, yet that there is such a connection is undeniable. The distribution of this type may be related to the close trade connections amongst the lands of the East Mediterranean during the 14th- 13th centuries B.C., as well as to the dispersion of the "Sea Peoples" during the 1 2th- 1 1th centuries B.C. This is a reasonable background to the appearance of such temples in the Philistine sanctuary at Tell Qasile. However, the great dif- ference between the plans of the temples in the three Strata XII-X at Tell Qasile, as well as the probability 'that the temple of Stratum XII retains Canaanite traditions (such as those reflected in Hazor, Area C), show that the Philistine inhabitants had no strong, crystallized cultic architectural tra- ditions behind them. VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE TEMPLE ARCHITECTURE AT TELL QASILE In the following section we briefly survey some of the architectural components of the temples of Tell Qasile.39 (a) Entrances The "bent-axis" approach, which appears in Temple 131 and Shrine 300, was common in Mesopotamian temples of the 3rd millennium B.C.,40 and in several instances in the 2nd millenium B.C.41 This type of entrance is rarely found in the Levant: it is known in Fosse Temple I at Lachish, in the temple of Alalakh, Stratum III,42 and in the Phoenician temple at Sarepta (see above, p. 66). These sporadic instances in the Levant do not seem to have any relation to the Mesopotamian tradition and, as we have seen, this feature is foreign also to the main tradition of the cultic architecture in Palestine, where most temples were built with a direct access to the cella. The location of the entrance at the corner of the building, as in Temple 200 of Stratum XI, is found in several temples of the irregular plan (see Table on p. 65), as well as in all the temples at Kition and that at Enkomi. The absence of such entrances in other temples would point to a probable connection between this group of Palestinian temples and those of Cyprus, in the 13th- 1 1th centuries B.C. (b) The Raised Platform 43 The raised platform, which characterizes the three temples at Tell Qasile, is one of the two alternative types of holy-of-holies found in temples of the ancient Near East (the other type is a niche, which sometimes becomes a separate adyton). While in Mesopotamia the raised platform was popular in the 3rd millennium B.C., and was gradually replaced by a niche in the 2nd millennium B.C., in the Levant the two types appear side-by-side throughout the 2nd millennium B.C. The following Table 13 summarizes the technical data concerning raised platforms in Late Bronze and Iron Age temples in the Levant. The raised platforms noted in the table are built as raised squares or rectangles, sometimes with steps leading to them, and are attached to the back wall of the cella . This type appears in Israel already in the 3rd millennium B.C. and is known in the 2nd millennium B.C. in temples in Syria (Mari and Tell Chuera). In some temples, the holy-of-holies was built as a bench along the back wall of the temple 68</page><page sequence="74">comparativi: study of templi-: architecture TABLE 13: RAISED PLATFORMS IN TEMPLES OF THE LEVANT Building Site Stratum Technique Width Depth Height Details Lachish I brick 3.50m 0.60m 0.30m Three frontal projections and side cell Lachish II stone 3.50m 0.65m 0.25m One frontal projection Lachish III (Early) fill, clay 2.50m 2.25m 0.60m and stone Lachish III (Late) brick slightly larger than the Frontal stepped projection and three former side steps; niche for lamps; hearth at foot of platform Mcgiddo VI lb rubble 7.00m 1.20m 1.10m Plastered Megiddo Vila rubble Complex with fore part, back part and niche Beth Shan VII brick 1.45m 0.77m 0.77m Beth Shan VI Upper brick and 2.40m 1.30m 0.55m altar stone Beth Shan VI Lower brick 1.40m 1.07m 0.73m Incense altar(?) altar Tel Mcvorakh brick c. 1.00m c. 1.50m 1.00m Five frontal steps, plastered Ha/or.

(Tell Mardikh, Area B; Megiddo VII B), while, in other temples, a combination of a square platform and a long bench is found (Alalakh VII; Megiddo VI I A). A more complex arrangement can be found in Beth-Shan VII-VI, where the platform was built within a separate adyton. In Cyprus, an example can be found in Temple 5 at Kition (see above, p. 67). Raised platforms are not found in the holy-of-holies of temples in Egypt or Anatolia, and they rarely appear in the Aegean (at Mycenae). They are, there- fore, part of the cultic architectural traditions of 131 the Levant, originating in the 3rd milennium B.C., perhaps under Mesopotamian influence, and con- tinuing to exist in the Levant for a long period, even after they had disappeared from the temples of Mesopotamia itself. The purpose of the raised platform was to create a pedestal on which, in the words of L. Oppenheim, "the image of the god was lifted above the level of human activity".44 (c) Benches The benches built along the walls of all the temples at Tell Qasile are a characteristic architectural element in many of the temples of Mesopotamia, the Levant, Cyprus and the Aegean.45 They are rare in the large, monumental, symmetrical temples (examples can be found only in Alalakh VII and Hazor, Area H, Strata 2 and la), yet they are very common in the smaller temples, both those with direct entrance and those with indirect access and of irregular plan. In all these temples, the benches are built along the walls; only in isolated examples are they free-standing. A parallel to the double, stepped bench, as in Temple 13 1 at Tell Qasile, is found only in the temple at Tel Mevorakh, of the Late Bronze Age I. In the Fosse Temples at Lachish, benches of a similar size are built in two or three parallel rows. While benches were a usual feature in Meso- potamian temples of the 3rd millennium B.C., they disappear there in the 2nd millennium B.C. They are also unknown in Egyptian temples. Therefore, like the raised platform, we can assume that benches appeared in temples of the Levant in the late 4th and 3rd millennia B.C. (perhaps under 69</page><page sequence="75">CHAPTER NINE Mesopotamian influence?) and continued as a com- mon architectural element in the smaller temples there. Their rarity in larger, monumental buildings may be indicative of different cult rituals practiced in these temples. The appearance of benches in the temples of Cyprus and Greece, from the 13th- 11th centuries B.C. (in the small temple at Mycenae, Cheos, Asine, Enkomi and Kition) is either a local development or an indication of a possible Eastern tradition underlying some of these temples (see above, p. 67). The benches were probably used for the placing of offerings.46 On the benches of Temples 200, 300 and 1 3 1 at Tell Qasile, some pottery vessels were found in situ. (d) Pillars The use of pillars for supporting the roof in temples is common in Palestine in the 3rd and 2nd millennia B.C., while in Syria this feature is know only in palaces of this period. It may reflect Egyptian in- fluence, which was more prominent in Palestine than in Syria.47 The arrangement of the pillars along the long axis is rare and can be paralleled only in Fosse Temple I at Lachish, and probably also in the enigmatic "Lion Temple" at Jaffa (see above, p. 67). We have previously noted a similar arrangement of pillars in Mycenaean buildings at Eleusis and Asine (see above, p. 67). The pillars in the temple at Mycenae are parallel to the long axis, yet are not on it. The temple at Enkomi is also divided lengthwise by pillars and a section of a wall. On the one hand, we could see a connection between this architectural element in the Aegean world and its appearance in the Philistine temple at Tell Qasile; on the other hand, we must remember that Temple 131 at Tell Qasile is of the second half of the 11th century B.C. and succeeds two temples where pillars were not employed. The Aegean tradition here can, therefore, only be tentatively suggested, and this phenomenon could still well be a local development. The pillar bases in Temple 131 at Tell Qasile are well-worked cylindrical drums of chalk stone, quarried in the hills to the east. Most of the pillar base was sunk into the floor, leaving only the top visible. On top of such bases stood a wooden pillar of less than half of its diameter. Such a ratio, between wooden pillar and stone base, is well known in Egyptian architecture,48 and has also been observed in the pillar bases along the eastern wall of the Stratum VI temple at Lachish. On the other hand, two major pillar bases in this same temple (as well as those in the temple of Stratum VI at Beth-Shan) probably carried pillars of a similar diameter, as would be indicated by the diameter of the associated Egyptian-style capitals found.49 The drum-like shape of the pillar bases at Tell Qasile has parallels in the palaces of Alalakh VII and Ugarit, from the Middle and Late Bronze Ages,50 as well as in a series of Canaanite temples in Israel. Some technical data concerning these pillars are compared in the following table. TABLE 14.

(e) The Chamber at the Back of the Temple A chamber at the back of the temple was found in Temples 131 and 200 at Tell Qasile, and probably also existed in Temple 319 of Stratum XII. Such a room first appears in the Dagan temple at Mari, of the 18th century B.C.,53 and at Tell Meskeneh (Emar) in northern Syria,54 where a narrow room was found behind the raised platform in the megaron-form temple of the Late Bronze Age I. Such chambers are found in the Late Bronze temples of Lachish (Fosse Temples II- III, Rooms F and E), and Beth-Shan VII (Room 1068) and VI (Rooms 1034, 1043). Most of the monumental, symmetrical temples of the Levant lack such rooms, yet in Temples 2 and la in Area H at Hazor, walls en- 70</page><page sequence="76">COMPARATIVE STUDY OF TEMPLE ARCHITECTURE closing a niche at the back of the temples perhaps created similar rooms. Similar small chambers ap- pear in Temples 2, 3, 4 and 5 at Kition, as well as in the temple of Enkomi. These small chambers in the Cypriote temples were interpreted by their ex- cavators as holy-of-holies. However, as suggested above (see p. 67), they were most probably storage rooms or treasuries, similar to those in the temples of Palestine and as found in the temples at Mycenae and Phylakopl. At Mycenae and Tell Qasile, the finds certainly support such an interpretation. The partition walls separating the rear chambers in Temple 131, and probably also in Temple 319, had no structural function (e.g., in supporting the roof) and hence may be reconstructed as partitional walls not intended to reach roof level. In Temple 200, the partition wall (574) might even have been the foundation of the raised platform itself (see above p. 24). A similar interpretation was suggested by Tufnell concerning Fosse Temple III at Lachish,55 where the wall separating the raised platform from Rooms E and F there was interpreted as a low parapet. (f) The Location and Orientation of the Temples The temples at Tell Qasile are situated close to the summit of the mound. On the same contour line, other public buildings were erected, such as Building 147 of Strata XII-XI and Building L of Stratum IX in Area A. The temples were integrated within the town plan, with their southern wall always adjoining the northern wall of adjacent buildings. This is in contrast to many Canaanite temples, which were free-standing buildings. The orientation of the Tell Qasile temples is to- wards the west-southwest (249¬∞). Since the matter of orientation of temples has raised some debate, a list of the orientation of various temples in the Levant and Cyprus is of interest (see opposite column). The list reveals that there is little regularity in the orientation of the temples in Palestine.56 A general orientation to the west, between 215¬∞-313¬∞ is found in various temples in Palestine and Syria and is the rule in Iron Age II temples.57 A possible seaward orientation of the temples at Tell Qasile should not be ruled out. Since the settlement was founded as a port town, the deity worshipped in its cultic center may have been a sea deity, considered a protector of seafarers. Less plausibly, the temples may have been oriented to- ward the place of origin of the "Sea-Peoples".58 Orien- / Orien- Palestine tation Syria / Cyprus tation Beth-Shan VII-VI 14¬∞ Ugarit (Temples of 3¬∞ Lachish (Area P) 90¬∞ Baal and Dagan) Beth-Shan V, 107¬∞ Tell Mardikh(D+B) 4¬∞ northern Carchemish 45¬∞ Beth-Shan V, 112¬∞ Tell Chuwera, southern Antae Temple 255¬∞ Lachish, Fosse 176¬∞ Tell Chuera, Megiddo 2048 190¬∞ Small Antae Temple 270¬∞ Megiddo 4040 203¬∞ Mari, Dagan Temple 275¬∞ Megiddo 5269, 5192 225¬∞ Tell Mumbakat 292¬∞ Hazor, Area A 239¬∞ Alalakh 319¬∞ Tell Qasile 249¬∞ Tell Chuera (MB) 340¬∞ Tel Kitan 263¬∞ Kition 275¬∞ Beth-Yerah 270¬∞ Megiddo XIX 270¬∞ Arad (Iron Age) 270¬∞ Tel Mevorakh 270¬∞ Arad EB 284¬∞ Ai, Acropolis (EB) 285¬∞ Tell Abu Hawam 288¬∞ Shechem, Tower Temple 300¬∞ Hazor, Area H 314¬∞ Timna 323¬∞ En-Gedi 343¬∞ THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TEMENOS (a) General Comments In the stratigraphie analysis above, we described the development of the courtyards in the various strata. In Strata XII-XI, the area east, north and north- west of the temples was a large, open area with- out boundary walls, yet on the south it was en- closed by the northern wall of a group pf buildings. Within the open area a single, narrow, long room was constructed in Stratum XII, and two rooms were constructed in Stratum XI. While in Stratum XII an undefined building existed west of the temple, in Stratum XI Shrine 300 was attached to the back, western wall of the main temple. The courtyards of Stratum X were more carefully planned. Two courtyards served each temple (main Temple 131 and Shrine 300). The two courtyards were surrounded by stone boundary walls and were entered separately from a street on the north. The courtyard of Temple 13 enclosed a rectangular room and a foundation of a sacrificial altar, while the courtyard of Temple 300 enclosed a second, single room with cooking facilities. 71</page><page sequence="77">CHAPTER NINE The temple courtyards were a most important component of the cultic complex. This is a well- known feature in the cultic architecture of the ancient Near East, with examples in abundance. The main cultic activity of the common people of the town would take place in the courtyard, while the temple itself was entered probably only by the priests. Such well-planned temple courtyards are known in the Late Bronze Age temples at Hazor, Beth-Shan, Alalakh and Ugarit, as well as in the sacred area at Kition. (b) Altar The square stone foundation in the courtyard of Temple 131 at Tell Qasile is interpreted as the foundation of a sacrificial altar. Similar altars were discovered in various temple enclosures in the Levant, as well as in Cyprus.59 The relevant technical data is presented in the following comparative table. In the Aegean world only a few altars are known.75 From the sub-Mycenaean period, altars are known before the small temple at Karphi76 and at the Heraium at Samos.77 Both are of unworked field stones; the latter altar measures 1.30 x 2.70 m. The altar at Tell Qasile should be regarded as a further link in the continuous local tradition originating in the Bronze Age culture of the Levant. The upper part of the altar has not been preserved, but, on the basis of comparison with better preserved altars (such as that at Arad), we can assume that it was built of stones to a height of approximately 1.00 m.

Its location, north of the temple's entrance and a little east of the previous altar, calls for such identification. The sunken area found around the circular stone installation could have served for draining animal blood. However, nothing else can be said about this installation, and the identification remains tentative. (c) Other Components of the Courtyards Besides the altar, the only other installation found in the courtyards which could be associated with the cult ritual is Installation 293, at the western end of the courtyard of Stratum XI (see above, p. 26). No similar installations have been found in temple courtyards in Palestine, though a somewhat similar feature occurs in the courtyard of the sacred en- closure at Myrtou-Pigadhes.78 The function of this installation is not clear, yet some material seems to have been ground here and then mixed with a liquid. This could have been connected with the preparation of ritual meals. But the installation could have served as some sort of sacrificial altar, in which case the jar in the corner would have been intended to catch the drained-off blood. Such "blood-altars" have come to light in the 2nd millennium B.C. temples at Beicesultan in west- ern Turkey.79 Single rooms characterize the temple courtyards in all three strata (XII-X). In the single room of Stratum XII, an exceptionally large basalt grinding stone was discovered, while in Room 204 of Stratum X a cooking installation and a small silo were dis- covered. It is therefore highly probable that these rooms served for the preparation of sacred meals offered in the temple. Single rooms can be found in the courtyards of several temples in Palestine. At Beth-Shan VII, a large rectangular room (1 107) was found on the western side of the courtyard (near the altar). In Fosse Temple I at Lachish, a single room was attached to the temple structure, but lacking direct access to the temple proper. At Hazor, Area H, Stratum 2, several rooms were found at the side of the courtyard; they served as a pottery workshop and in other undefined functions. In the Iron Age temple at Arad, long-rooms were found north of the courtyard. Thus, such rooms were an integral part of temple complexes in ancient Palestine. The bench discovered along the outside of the eastern wall of Temple 1 3 1 of Stratum X (see above, p. 41) is also unparalleled in other Palestinian temples, yet it does recall Myrtou-Pigadhes, where benches line the walls facing the courtyard. CULT PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLES (a) Building Deposits The small group of finds found within Wall 551 of Temple 131 (see above, p. 38) is best explained as a building deposit. The practice of placing deposits in the foundations of buildings is well known in Meso- potamia, yet it is rarely found in this country. It does appear in the temples of Strata VII-VI at Beth- Shan; in Stratum VI there a rich group of finds was found below the steps leading to the holy-of-holies. (b) Burial of Cult Objects Pit or Favissa 125 was probably intentionally cut for the burial of cult objects when Temple 200 went out of use (see above, p. 25). The anthropomorphic vessel found in the pit (PI. 29) may have represented a fertility goddess worshipped in the temple. The burial of such an important vessel may be compared with the ritual burial of idols elsewhere in the ancient Near East. An early example can be seen in the burial of statues at the Abu Temple at Tell Asmar,80 while more relevant examples are the burials of the "horned god" and "copper god" bronze statues at Enkomi, early in the 12th century B.C.81 The latter was buried in the temple of Enkomi when a new floor was laid. Some relation might be suggested between this practice and that in the Syro-Hittite practice of burying large statues.82 73</page><page sequence="79">CHAPTER TEN COMPARATIVE SURVEY OF VARIOUS BUILDINGS AND TOWN PLANNING AT TELL QASILE No complete plans of buildings, apart from those of the temples, could be determined in Strata XII-XI at Tell Qasile. On the other hand, several complete buildings of Stratum X were uncovered in Areas A and C. A detailed stratigraphie analysis of the buildings in Area A will be given in a subsequent volume. In this chapter, schematic drawings of the various buildings there (Fig. 16) will serve as the basis for a comparative survey, to complete the architectural picture. VARIOUS BUILDINGS Private Houses Buildings K, J, W, R, and Q in Area A, and Building 225 in Area C, are private houses, the full plans of which in Stratum X are known. Apart from Building 225, they are all square and measure about 9 x 10 m. They have courtyards surrounded by rooms on two or three sides, and at least two of them (W and R) are Fig. 16. Schematic plan of Area A, Stratum X. built on the "four-room house" plan.1 Building W is a perfect example of such a house. The entrance led into a central, rectangular courtyard surrounded on two sides by long-rooms, while on the third side a row of pillars supported a roofed area. Building R is of similar plan, yet the entrance led directly into the long-room, perpendicular to the courtyard (and which is usually situated at the back of the "four- room house")- Buildings K and J were probably of the "three-room" type. Their original plan comprised a square courtyard with rooms on two of its sides; later the courtyard was divided by a wall which altered the plan to a regular "four-room" form. In the preliminary report of the first two seasons, B. Mazar claimed that "four-room houses" appear on the site for the first time in Stratum IX (10th century B.C.).2 This was written before the third season, in which Building W was revealed and the plan of Building R was clarified. It is now clear that at least Buildings W and R existed as "four-room houses" already in Stratum X. Our renewed study of the stratigraphy in Area A led to the conclusion that the repairs in Buildings K and J, which transformed them into "four- room houses", took place in a later phase of Stratum X, while the renewed study of Strata IX and VIII indicated that, in these strata, the "four-room" plan gradually degenerated. In Stratum IX, Building J still retained a "four-room" plan, yet the entrance was shifted to its northern side, giving direct access to what had been the backmost room. Buildings K and W ceased to be "four-room" buildings in Strata IX-VIII: Building W became a "three-room" house with a square, corner courtyard with a large silo in its center, while Building K now comprised a large courtyard divided by a row of pillars, with one room on its eastern side. Building 225 in Area C recalls the houses of Area A in construction technique and in the use of wooden pillars, based on stone foundations for the roofing of a "portico" within the courtyard. However, its plan is unique (see above, pp. 44-46); it lacks the rectangular 74</page><page sequence="80">COMPARATIVE STUDY OF VARIOUS BUILDINGS long-room alongside the courtyard, which charac- terized the "four-room house", while the back part of the building is divided into two square rooms, one leading into the other. The outer room was used as a storeroom, while the inner one served as a living room. This house of unique plan may have func- tioned as the residence of an official or priest who served the adjacent temple. The finds in Area A indicate that the plan of the "four-room house" was popular at Tell Qasile in Stratum X (second half of the 1 1th century B.C.). This is in line with the discovery of "three-room" and "four-room" houses at various sites of the Early Iron Age, as Ai,3 Khirbet Raddana,4 Tel Masos,5 Tel Shera,6 and Izbet Sarta (east of Aphek).7 It is also probable that the "four-room houses" at Tell el- Fa≈•ah (N), Stratum III, were founded at the end of the 11th century B.C., as held by the excavator.8 Fragmentary buildings of a related type were ex- cavated at Tel Esdar (11th century B.C.).9 Many scholars agree today that this building type originated in the Israelite settlement sites of the late 13th and early 12th centuries B.C.10 This is con- firmed by the appearance of prototypes of such buildings at sites such as Giloh (Southern Jerusalem), where one of the earliest examples was excavated, and in Stratum Ilia at Tel Masos, where a "three- room" building was identified.11 In 12th- 14th centuries B.C. Israelite sites, such as Khirbet Rad- dana, Ai and Tel Masos II, this type of building (as well as variations of it) was indeed common. However, it soon spread over the entire country. The appearance of fragmentary "pillar buildings" in the 1 1th century B.C. on various sites, such as Tel Sippor, Tel Shera, Megiddo VIB, Afula and Tel Kisan,12 show that it was no longer solely Israelite; it is thus hardly surprising to find it popular among the inhabitants of Tell Qasile. In the hill-country, the pillars in these houses were built of monoliths, whereas in the Coastal Plain and northern Negev, they were of either stone segments or (as at Tell Qasile) wooden shafts standing upon wider stone bases. Building O in Area A, exceptional in its plan, is composed of two parts, the western one probably a large shop or workshop, and the eastern one a dwelling with a large courtyard surrounded by rooms on three sides. The entrance to this latter part was through one of these rooms. This plan continues the tradition of the courtyard houses characterizing private dwellings in Palestine during the Middle and Late Bronze Ages. But whereas during the Bronze Age the rooms around the courtyard were not of unified form,13 the rooms of Building O were rectangular, resembling in shape the rooms of the "four-room houses". Such rectangular "long-rooms" characterize Iron Age architecture, and in Building O they were introduced into an otherwise Late Bronze Age plan. Other courtyard houses were found in the Iron Age I at Tell Beit Mirsim (Stratum B2), at Megiddo VI and recently at Tel Masos, where one of the largest buildings (Building 314) somewhat resembles Building O at Tell Qasile.14 Storage Buildings and Workshops Building Z in Area A of Stratum X is one of the earliest examples of the typical Iron Age storage buildings, consisting of a rectangular unit divided by two rows of pillars.15 Two other examples of such buildings, dated to the Iron Age I, are known: Tell Abu Hawam, Building 33-35 (Stratum IV);16 and Tel Masos, Building 176.17 Both examples are con- temporaneous with our Building Z. The contemporaneous appearance of this type of storage building in Philistia, Phoenicia and the Israelite realm shows that it had become popular throughout the region and should be attributed to no specific ethnic group. Building Z was found south of Street A, in Area A. The neighbouring building to the east, Building Q, is composed of two parts: living quarters (Rooms Q2-4) and a workshop with a separate entrance (Ql), a division which recalls Building O. The workshop was founded already in Stratum XI, and was used for smelting copper or bronze.18 Official Residence Building L of Strata IX- VIII, which has been described in detail in the preliminary report on the first two seasons,19 is a public building with two parts; the northern wfng may be regarded as reception quarters (Rooms L9 and L8, respectively an ante-chamber and a large room with wide benches at its end) and living rooms (Rooms L6 and L7), while its southern part is a series of long, narrow storage rooms. B. Mazar compared this structure with Building 1482 of Stratum IVB-VA at Megiddo, also having long, rectangular rooms. A better parallel would be a building at Beer-Sheba, Stratum II,20 which is larger and more massive than other buildings on that site, and also including living and storage wings. The storage wing there is composed of 75</page><page sequence="81">CHAPTER TEN Fig. 17. General plan of Stratum X structures at Tell Qasile with reconstruction of streets. rectangular rooms similar to those of Building L. The two buildings probably served as the dwelling of high public-administration officials. TOWN-PLANNING AT TELL QASILE The fact that remains of Stratum X at Tell Qasile were excavated in an area of approximately 2.5 dunams, about 16% of the overall area of the site, allows us to discuss certain features of the planning of this stratum. We have already mentioned that the settlement was built on a slope facing west, and that the public buildings (including the temples) were built 76</page><page sequence="82">COMPARATIVE STUDY OF VARIOUS BUILDINGS on the uppermost part of this slope. This location, which provided all parts of the settlement with an equal share of the western breeze, seems to have been intentional. The settlement plan of the two earliest strata (XII-XI) is insufficiently known for discussion. However, some of the basic characteristics of the general plan of Area C were determined already in these strata and were carried over into Stratum X. Most of Area A in Strata XII-XI remained open, while in Stratum X it was systematically built up. The buildings of Stratum X in the various areas are similarly oriented. The streets form a per- pendicular grid (see reconstruction of the street system in Fig. 17). The streets are 4.00 m wide and the distance between them on a north-south line is 22.00 m (between Street A and Street C in Area A), approximately 15.00 m (between Street C and Street 224 in Area C) and 20.00 m (between Street 224 and Street 291 in Area C). It seems as if, north of Area C, there is place for one more street, and so we may assume that the settlement comprised five parallel east-west streets. Only two perpendicular, north- south streets, however, could be traced: Street B in Area A and a hypothetical street west of Area C. In Stratum X, the spaces between the streets were built up as blocks of buildings (¬° insulae ), each with its respective function. The southernmost block (south of Street A in Area A), of which only the northern line of buildings was preserved, is closest to the Yarkon river and to the nearby anchorage. Here, not surprisingly, the storage building (Z) and the metal workshop (Building Q) were found; this block prob- ably served as the trade and craft center. The block of buildings north of Area A was almost completely excavated and is composed of two rows of dwellings, adjoining on their respective back walls. The entrances to the rather uniform dwellings of the southern row was from Street A, while the northern row of houses was entered from the parallel Street C. Only the corner house (W) was entered from north- south Street B. The block of buildings in Area C is also divided into two groups adjoining on their back walls. The northern group served as the cultic center of the settlement, while the southern group contained a row of dwellings. It can be concluded, therefore, that the settlement of Tell Qasile, Stratum X was built according to a well-planned orthogonal plan. There is very little evidence of orthogonal town- planning in the Bronze Age cities of Palestine. This principle is known at two sites of the Middle Bronze Age II: Megiddo and Tel Nagila. At Megiddo, a residential quarter in Area B-B was built according to such a plan in Stratum XII, retaining this principle until the end of the Late Bronze Age.21 At Tel Nagila, a poorly preserved dwelling area was probably originally planned on this same principle.22 These two examples indicate the existence of or- thogonal town-planning in the Middle Bronze Age II. However, during the Late Bronze Age this principle cannot be traced in any of the Canaanite cities, except for the example noted at Megiddo, where an earlier tradition was continued. During the Iron Age II, orthogonal town-planning is rarely found in Israel. It can be seen at Tell Far'ah (N) (Strata 3-2 of the 10th-8th centuries B.C.),23 as well as at Megiddo, Stratum III,24 probably built after the Assyrian conquest of the city. Outside Palestine, Enkomi in Cyprus was built on an orthogonal plan in the 1 2th- 1 1th centuries B.C.25 A main north-south street and eight east-west streets form large rectangular insulae of buildings. The average street width is 2.50 m, and the distance between them is 30 m. The little orthogonal planning in Canaan, on the one hand, and its appearance at Tell Qasile and at contemporaneous Enkomi, on the other hand, points to a probable connection between the two. Other close relations between the Philistine culture and Cypriote culture in the 12th- 11th cen- turies B.C. are well known and are strengthened by various finds from Tell Qasile. It is not improbable that the inhabitants of Tell Qasile, at least in Stratum X, were inspired by the town-plan of Enkomi, as it was known to them before its destruction in the mid- 11th century B.C. 77</page><page sequence="83">CHAPTER ELEVEN THE CULT OBJECTS: ANTHROPOMORPHIC VESSELS AND MASKS The pottery cult objects uncovered in the various strata of Area C comprise one of the richest collections of such vessels ever discovered in Palestine. In the following chapters we shall describe and discuss the cult objects according to various categories. The categories chosen for the division of the material are based on both iconography and function, as follows: Chapter 11: Objects with human representations. These include various cult objects and masks with representations of human beings or deities (but ex- cluding the zoomorphic masks, which are closely related to the anthropomorphic ones). Chapter 12: Cult stands and cult bowls, supported by the stands. This is a homogeneous group of ob- jects. Chapter 13: Libation vessels: cult objects used for libation, such as rhytons, kernoi , etc. A large cultic jar, which probably held sacred plants and into which libations could be poured, is also included in this chapter. To these we should add the an- thropomorphic vessel (Fig. 18) included in this chapter. Chapter 14: Various fragments of clay figurines, fragments of larger cult vessels, the complete shape of which could not be determined, and various un- usual containers used in the cult. Table 17 on p. 120 summarizes the distribution of the finds according to stratigraphie context. Fig. 1 1 on p. 35 shows the findspots of the cult objects in Temple 131. ANTHROPOMORPHIC VESSELS Two anthropomorphic vessels were found in Area C. (a) A Female Anthropomorphic Vessel (Fig. 18; PL 29) Reg. No. 2235; Locus 125; Level 20.19 m; Stratum XI Brown clay, black core, medium fired, white grits, brown slip, traces of red and black decoration*; wheel-made. Height 32.5 cm; maximum diameter 13 cm; average thickness of the walls, 1 cm. The female figure was modelled by applying clay to the wheel- made body when still leather-hard. The face (9.8 cm high) was formed by applying a thick layer of clay to the vessel's neck and then modelling it by hand. The face was naturalistically rendered: the eyebrows form a continuous curved ridge from nose to ears. The nose is prominent and concave. The large eyes are emphasized by a surrounding thick line of black paint, yet no inner details of the eye are given. The cheekbones are prominent and the facial muscles well defined. The lips are thick and parted, giving the impression of a slight smile. The ears are large and moulded in detail, with black paint decorating their forepart. The forehead is very low, and a shallow groove, painted black, appears above the eyebrows. Above the groove is the plain rim of the vessel, thus cutting off the crown of the head. The rim is rubbed and worn, probably the result of extensive use of a specially fitted funnel, found nearby (to be published in Part Two). The massive neck stands upon wide, angular shoulders which form the upper part of the cylindrical body; the body tapers toward the bottom, terminating in a shallow ring base. The breasts form two spouts, moulded onto the body after it had been pierced in the corresponding spots. The breasts are unevenly placed, thus indicating careless workmanship. The arms were separately formed as clay rolls, joined to the shoulders and bent at the elbows to allow the open hands to touch the belly. In contrast to the naturalistic representation of the face, the body and hands are schematically rendered. Between the breasts there are traces of painted decoration, 78</page><page sequence="84">THE CULT OBJECTS: ANTHROPOMORPHIC VESSELS AND MASKS Fig. 18. A female anthropomorphic vessel. composed of a horizontal line and three or four vertical lines, probably in red; this may represent a pendant. The lower part of the body is decorated with six thick, horizontal red lines, of which only traces remain. The general impression of the figure is clumsy. The lack of hair and the crudeness of the 79</page><page sequence="85">CHAPTER ELEVEN face give a masculine impression, and the breasts are the only indication of the true sex. The vessel was found broken, in the lower part of Pit 125 (see above, p. 25 and PI. 18:3). The fragments were scattered amongst other cult and offering vessels. Despite a thorough search of the area, several pieces could not be found. Thus, the vessel had probably been broken before being placed in the pit. Some of the fragments bear traces of a fire which occurred after the vessel had broken. Although the figure lacks any divine symbol or clear attribute, it probably represents a fertility goddess. It is also likely that Pit 125 was in- tentionally cut for the burial of this cult object and that other cult objects and vessels found there were buried as offerings, in relation to the burial of this main figure (see above, p. 73). The vessel was used by filling it through a special funnel and pouring the libation liquid through the breasts. The liquid may have been milk, as Harden assumed of a vessel from Spain (see below). This vessel is unique, and no close parallels are known. However, the general conception, its function and the physiognomy do have interesting parallels. Out of nearly twenty anthropomorphic vessels from the Bronze and Iron Ages found in Palestine, about half depict female figures.1 They vary in details of execution and artistic style, but most are small vessels, with only two as large as that from Tell Qasile: a vessel from Beth-Shan VII, representing the Egyptian god Bes,2 and a male figure from Lachish, dated typologically to the Late Bronze Age.3 None of the anthropomorphic vessels from Palestine have pierced breasts or physiognomic features similar to our vessel. A group of small Egyptian alabaster vessels, from the period of the New Kingdom, depict a pregnant woman holding her hands on her belly, as on our figure. The Egyptian vessels have been defined by Emma Brunner-Traut as "Gravidenflaschen", sug- gesting that they were used as containers for materials connected with midwifery. Brunner-Traut also suggested that the body shape of this vessel recalls the hippopotamus goddess Ta-weret (Teoris), protector of pregnant women.4 M. Weippert, in a paper following Brunner-Trau≈•s, sought to define a group of seven Cannanite pottery "Genaikomorphic" vessels which, he believes, are the Canaanite version of the above mentioned Egyptian alabaster vessels.5 Although some of the examples he quotes (especially No. 4, from Beth-Shan) truly recall the Egyptian prototypes, the group as a whole cannot be considered homogeneous. The vessel from Tell Qasile, which Weippert includes in this group (No. 6), resembles the Egyptian vessels in the position of the hands as well as in the general clumsiness of the body. However, it differs from that group in its size, its lack of handles and in the appearance of breast-spouts. These differences (stressed by Weippert himself) put our vessel in a completely different category, from the functional point of view. Female anthropomorphic vessels with breast- spouts are known in several scattered examples in antiquity. In Crete, two large figures of this type, from the Early Minoan III period, were found at Mallia and Mochlos.6 Among the group of twenty-two stylized anthropomorphic vessels found in the 13th century B.C. temple at Mycenae, one has pierced breasts.7 Yet the bodies of these vessels are pierced in various places (probably in order to facilitate firing), and thus it is hard to judge if the pierced breasts in one of the figures had any special cultic significance. A most interesting parallel is a Phoenician alabaster statue found in Gallera near Granada (Spain).8 According to D. Harden, the statue is oriental in origin and should be dated on stylistic grounds to the 7th-6th centuries B.C. It depicts a goddess seated on an ornamental chair, holding a large bowl. The figure is hollow and has pierced breasts. Harden explains the function of the Gallera statue as follows: "This is clearly a miracle-working statuette, which at an appropriate time in the cult ceremony enabled milk to flow through the breasts into the bowl from a hollow that could be filled through the head. Until the miracle was to happen the holes in the breasts were blocked with wax, or other material, removable by gently heating." Although this may be a little imaginative in detail, it is possible that the statuette from Gallera and the vessel from Tell Qasile may have served similar cult practices. The crude physiognomy of the figure from Tell Qasile differs widely from the common female representations in Egyptian and Canaanite art. How- ever, an interesting parallel can be found in a clay head discovered in the Mycenaean temple at Cheos, in a Mycenaean IIIc context.9 The protruding cheeks, eyes and eyebrows, and the straight upper edge of the forehead, are all reminiscent of our vessel. A hollow passes through the center of the head, which was probably originally attached to some container. 80</page><page sequence="86">THE CULT OBJECTS: ANTHROPOMORPHIC VESSELS AND MASKS The "sex" of this figure could not be determined. Both the artistic style and the use of the figure would relate it to the Tell Qasile figure. Such a relation gains in significance when we take into consideration the "genetic" relationship between Mycenaean IIIc pottery and Philistine wares. Amongst the group of pottery statues from Crete representing a goddess with arms raised in prayer, the statues from Gazi and Karphi10 from the sub-Minoan period have crude, clumsy faces, recalling the Tell Qasile vessel, although here the relation may be coincidental. Other female representations from the end of the Late Bronze Age are the faience rhytons from Ugarit, Enkomi and Tell Abu-Hawam.11 The face on the Ugarit example somewhat recalls that of the Tell Qasile figure in general outline and in the heavy dark paint surrounding the eyes. Major female figures were an important feature in Mycenaean cult, as it indicated by several such "ladies" found at Mycenaean cult places. The best known are the female anthropomorphic vessels found in the shrines of Mycenae, Phylakopi and Tiryns, all of the 13th- 12th centuries B.C.12 They were un- doubtedly the most important cult objects in the Mycenaean shrines of this period. In Cyprus, Proto- White Painted bottles from Enkomi (late 12th- Mid-1 1th centuries B.C.) represent females, probablv goddesses, holding their hands on their bellies (as on our figure);13 their breasts are prominent but not pierced. Jacqueline Karageorghis sees a connection between their appearance in Cyprus in the late 12th century B.C. and the Aegean immigration to Cyprus at that time. Can these Cypriote vessels be regarded as a link between our vessel and the Mycenaean examples? If so, we have identified an Aegean practice which has passed through Cyprus and on to the Philistine culture. However, much caution is called for, taking into account the considerable stylistic differences between the three spheres. It remains an open question whether the vessel from Tell Qasile represents a particular artistic or cultic tradition, or whether it is a local phenomenon without any defined tradition behind it. Most of the various parallels are either too remote in time or too sporadic within their own culture to be definitive. All in all, the similarity of the Tell Qasile figure to the Cheos statue, the female clay figures of major deities in Mycenaean cult, and the use of breasts as spouts in the Aegean, would point to some sort of connection with Aegean traditions, but this must re- main tentative for the while. On the other hand, the comparison to the statue from Gallera shows that our vessel may represent a cult practice accepted by the Phoenicians and brought with them to their western colonies. (b) Anthropomorphic Juglet (Fig. 19; PL 30:3-4) Reg. No. 1485; Locus 157; Level 21.38 m; Stratum XII Fig. 19. An Anthropomorphic juglet. 81</page><page sequence="87">CHAPTER ELEVEN Brown clay, medium fired. Height 8.6 cm. The juglet has a pear-shaped body, plain round base, and a handle, drawn from rim to shoulder. It was probably wheel-made, but during the moulding of the human face, when the vessel was leather-hard, the body was. slightly squashed. The face was shaped on the neck of the vessel by applying additional clay. The face has a long protruding nose, eyes in the form of coffee-beans, large, protruding ears and a short, rectangular beard (or protruding chin?). The eye- brows are emphasized by two minute pieces of clay and above them is a long clay coil, passing across the forehead and curving behind the ears. This coil may represent the hair-do or, more likely, two rams' horns. The vessel was found close to bedrock, in the accumulations of grey earth in Courtyard 1 10 of Stratum XII. Among the various anthropomorphic vessels from Palestine, only a few are juglets. Two depict wom- en,14 and only one, from an Iron Age II tomb at Beth-Shemesh, depicts a bearded male figure.15 Four fragments of anthropomorphic juglets were dis- covered in an Iron Age II context at Ashdod.16 These few examples do not conform to any single artistic style and therefore can hardly be grouped together. The "coffee-bean" eyes find parallels in a female anthropomorphic vessel from Gezer, men- tioned above.17 The possible rams' horns may point to an identification of the figure as a male god. In a 6th century B.C. temple at Meniko in Cyprus, a small figurine was found depicting a bearded male god with similar horns. Karageorghis suggested to identify the figure as that of the god Amon or the Phoenician Ba'al Hamman.18 Other depictions of male gods with rams' horns are known from Israel, Cyprus and the western Phoenician world in the Persian period.19 It is not impossible, therefore, that our juglet (although earlier by hundreds of years) may also represent a male god. A "NAOS" (Fig. 20; PI. 30:1-2) Reg. No. 1969; Locus 134; Level 22.05 m; Stratum X This is a pottery plaque, 36.6 cm high and 25 cm wide, made of reddish-brown clay, medium fired, with a black core. Remains of a heavy white slip are visible, as well as a barely discernible red decoration. The object was found lying on the floor of Temple 131 of Stratum X in front of the raised platform. The plaque shows an architectural fa√ßade in which two figures were shown standing en face , in relief. The fa√ßade has a flat frame, 2.5-3.5 cm wide and protruding 2 cm from the central surface. The lower part of the frame, as well as an additional panel at the top, protrude a further 1.5 cm. The upper panel has a slightly concave profile which recalls an Egyptian cornice; it is pierced on either side, the diameter of the holes being 1.3 cm. On the lower panel of the frame, on line with the holes above, are two circular depressions, 1.3 cm deep. The corresponding de- pressions and holes were probably intended for the insertion of wooden door hinges, enabling the closing of two wooden (?) doors, to hide the sunken panel from view. The two figures within the panel were made separately and then attached to the panel before firing. They were intentionally defaced, only parts of their legs being preserved. Since no other remains of the figures were found amongst the destruction debris in the temple, it is probable that they were thrown outside before the building was set on fire. The original height of the figures was 26 cm. Judging from the traces of the bodies, the figures apparently portrayed female goddesses with their hands holding their breasts. The shape of the heads permits us to assume that they had a broad coiffure, perhaps with Hathor curls. The upper and lower parts of the plaque were decorated by attached figures, now missing. The remains of the figure on the upper part possibly in- dicate that a crouching animal was depicted, while those on the lower part are less clear. These two figures may have served as handles for carrying the object during the ritual. This object should be defined as a naos : a model of a temple fa√ßade which could be closed or opened to reveal the deities within. The discovery of the naos near the raised platform indicates that it had originally stood on the platform and that it was probably one of the more important objects in the temple. The intentional defacing of the figures also points to the significance of this object in the cult. Naoi in the form of architectural fa√ßades with figures of deities are well known in Egypt since the Middle Kingdom.20 Under the New Kingdom, and especially during the Ramesside period, statues of naofori (persons carrying a naos) were common.21 An Egyptian prototype of our object may be seen in a limestone naos from Deir el-Medineh;22 it is 32 cm high and 26 cm wide, made in the form of an 82</page><page sequence="88">THE CULT OBJECTS: ANTHROPOMORPHIC VESSELS AND MASKS Fig. 20. 'Naos'. architectural fa√ßade, with a large head of Hathor depicted in a sunken area which could be closed be- hind two doors. It is suggested that the origins of this type of object are the Egyptian shrines, the most famous of which is the small shrine from the tomb of Tutankhamun, covered by decorated gold sheets.23 The fa√ßade of this shrine (26.5 X 50.5 cm) was ex- ecuted in full Egyptian architectural fa√ßade style. When its two doors were open, one could see with- in the depths of the shrine two standing figures, probably representing the king and his consort. The naoi from Deir el-Medineh and Tell Qasile may be regarded as simplified schematizations of this type of Egyptian shrine. A broken cult object from Gezer may have been a part of a similar naos.2* Only the front part has been preserved, a flat area with the lower part of an architectural fa√ßade, including a 20 cm wide 83</page><page sequence="89">CHAPTER ELEVEN opening flanked by depressions which could have been for the door hinges, like those of the Tell Qasile naos . Neither the form of the rest of this ob- ject nor its date can be determined. Several pottery plaques found at Memphis in Egypt depict a nude woman standing within an architectural fa√ßade.25 Though Petrie defined this group as part of a larger group of "figures of women on a couch", well known in Egypt from the New Kingdom on26 (known also as "figures of concu- bines"), I believe that the two should be classed apart. I have found three plaques similar to those from Memphis in private collections in Israel; their style and execution would give them an Iron Age II Date. Their origin should be sought either in Phoenicia or in the coastal city states of Palestine.27 They prob- ably depict naked fertility goddesses standing within a shrine, like in our naos , which can be considered a prototype for the others. The same subject can be found in a Phoenician model-shrine (now in Beirut), where two goddesses are shown standing in a fron- tal attitude.28 Later on, the idea was taken by the Phoenicians to their western colonies, where some Phoenician and Punic stelae are decorated with similar figures of garbed goddesses standing within an architectural fa√ßade.29 POTTERY MASKS Fragments of one anthropomorphic and several zoomorphic masks were found in Stratum XI. (a) Anthropomorphic Mask (Fig. 21; PI. 31:1) Reg. No. 2965; Locus 227; Level 21.33 m. Grey clay, grey slip, medium fired. Two fragments of this mask were discovered, the larger one comprising most of the left side of the face. The nose is 4 cm long and has two carved nostrils. Below the nose, the upper lip of the open mouth was preserved. The left cheek is modelled and terminates at the top in a hole for the left eye. The fragment ends with a plain rim, pierced below the ear for the threading of a string. The second fragment bears the right ear, depicted in detail. On the basis of these two fragments, the mask can be reconstructed as life- size, measuring 20 cm high and 15 cm wide. The mask was made in a naturalistic style and the various features of the face are rendered in detail. It is large enough to be used by an adult, who could have tied it to his head. The eye openings and mouth would have allowed for sight and breathing. Our mask continues a tradition which can be traced to the Late Bronze Age. Three masks of this period were found in the Lower City at Hazor30 and at Gezer.31 The two Hazor masks are less than natural size, and have closed mouth and open eyes; one of them is grotesque in style and the other is naturalistic. As in our mask, they have holes for a tie string, yet since they are smaller than life-size, they were probably tied onto statues. The mask from Gezer has open eyes and a nose similar to the Tell Qasile examples, and is life-size. The continuation of the tradition can be traced into the 10th century B.C. at Tel Shera, where a fragment was found, similar to that from Tell Qasile.32 A fragment from Hazor, Stratum Va, can be attributed to the 8th century B.C.33 Anthropomorphic masks were common in the Phoenician culture of the 7th-6th centuries B.C., as revealed in the excavations along the Phoenician littoral, at such sites as Achzib, Khaldeh and Sarepta.34 These Pheonician masks, the predecessors of the Punic masks, are smaller than life-size and were probably used as votive objects. Several anthropomorphic masks are known from Cyprus, dated to the Late Cypriote III period (1200- 1150 B.C.). An important group was discovered at Kition; the one so far published depicts a male face with open eyes, a close mouth, well-defined ears and holes for tying a string. The moustache, eyes and eyebrows were emphasized with paint.35 Several masks were found at Enkomi, most of which have not been published.36 One published fragment depicts a bearded male figure with closed mouth and open eyes.37 Only one of the later Phoenician masks from Cyprus is life-size and was probably intended to be worn over a human face.38 Many of the above-mentioned masks were found in cultic contexts. The mask from Area C at Hazor was found close to the small Canaanite temple; the masks from Kition were found in the temples or in the nearby bothroi; some of the masks from Enkomi were found near the temple of the "Copper God" and two fragments from Sarepta were found in con- nection with the Phoenician temple there. Thus, these masks most probably served in cult practices. The life-size masks from Tell Qasile, Gezer, Tel Shera, Cyprus and the temple of Artemis Orthia at Sparta were probably worn by worshippers or priests during a ritual; this practice can be explained in various ways:39 it could either symbolize the image of the god in a kind of ritual "pantomime" or it could 84</page><page sequence="90">Fig. 21. Anthropomorphic mask. THE CULT OBJECTS: ANTHROPOMORPHIC VESSELS AND MASKS be used for "raising" figures of mythological or historical heroes from the dead. The smaller masks from H azor and the Phoenician examples would point to their having been hung on statues, or used as votive objects in connection with burial customs.40 Masks were probably also considered as apotropaic objects. There is no clear evidence determining the sex of the masks from Hazor, Gezer, and Tell Qasile, while some of those from Cyprus and the Punic world definitely display male features. (b-d) Zoomorphic masks (Fig. 22; PL 31) Fragments of three zoomorphic masks were dis- covered in Pit 125 and in its surroundings. (b) Fig. 22:a,e; PL 31:2,5. Four fragments of this mask were discovered, made of grey clay, slightly burnished. The two main fragments, which join, include an eye and an ear. They were found in two different loci; fragment No. 2196/1 in Pit 125 (at the 21.00 m level), while fragment 2890 in Locus 242, several meters west of Pit 125 (at the 21.75 m level). Two other fragments, which include the nose (no. 3155/1) and a fragment of the mask's rim with a tying hole (no. 3155/2), were found in Locus 272, some 6 m south of the center of Pit 125 (at the 21.50 m level). Though these two fragments could not be joined to the other two fragments, they must be attributed to the same mask since both ware and workmanship are identical. The distribution of the fragments of this mask is ad- ditional evidence of the character of Pit 125, into the upper part of which fragments of cult objects were thrown, while other fragments of the same objects were scattered over a wide area around the pit. The main fragment of the mask includes part of an eye socket, eyebrow and ear. The elliptical eye is open, and above it a groove indicates the eye socket; the eyebrow is denoted by a series of deep incisions. The ear is rounded and decorated with a series of deep incisions along its edge. There is a circular de- pression at the center of the ear. The second frag- ment bears a short, flat nose with two deep, large nostrils. The upper lip of the open mouth can be seen below the nose. The angle of the lip in relation to the nose is similar to that on the lion-shaped rhyton (see Fig. 34). This characteristic feature, as well as the shape of the ear, lead us to identify the mask as that of a lion. The openings for the eyes and mouth, as well as the tying holes and the size of the mask, show that it could have been worn by an adult during a ritual. 85</page><page sequence="91">CHAPTER ELEVEN Fig. 22. Zoomorphic masks. (c) Fig. 22:b-c; PI. 31:4. Two fragments of this mask (Nos. 2196/2-3), both of brown ware, medium fired, were found in Pit 125 at the 20.00 m level. The first fragment includes part of the eye opening, two grooves delineating the eye socket and a ridge depicting the eyebrow. The ear is semi-circular, with an inner depression en- closed by two incisions. The second fragment in- cludes the left ear and part of the eyebrow, identical in shape to those of the first fragment. (d) Fig. 22:d; PI. 31:3. Reg. No. 2981; Locus 233; Level 21.47 m. This fragment was found near the edge of Pit 125, 4 m southwest of its center. It is of grey clay, medi- um fired, and slightly burnished. The workmanship recalls the anthropomorphic mask (a) and the zoo- morphic mask (b). The fragment includes part of an elliptical right eye socket, a ridge depicting the eyebrow and a semi-circular right ear with central depression. The shape of the ears and eyes of the last two mentioned fragments is close to those of mask (b) and, therefore, it is probable that they, too, were of lion form. These zoomorphic mask fragments are unique. No parallels have been found in Israel or in the neighbouring countries, except for a small fragment from Enkomi, possibly part of a similar mask.41 The latter fragment was found in the same building as the bronze statue of the "Horned God". It is of grey clay and includes an eye and an ear (?), similar to our fragments. This interesting parallel calls for fur- ther study. The practice of using zoomorphic masks is hardly known in the Levant. A figurine from Lachish, from either the Iron Age or the Persian period,42 depicts a male wearing a lion-skin. At Kition and Enkomi, bull skulls were used as ritual masks in the L√°te Cypriote III temples.43 C y pro- Archaic clay figurines show human figures wearing bull-shaped masks.44 A bull- shaped votive mask w√¢s actually found in the Iron Age II Phoenician cemetery at Achzib.45 In Egypt, literary and artistic descriptions indicate the use of masks depicting gods.46 Among them are depictions of dancers wearing masks which portray the god Bes.47 Bes has a human face with rounded animal ears similar to those on our masks,48 and therefore it could be assumed that our masks depict that god. However, the angle of the mouth in mask (b) makes its identification as a lion head almost certain (see further below, pp. 102-103). The grooves above the eyes of our masks recall the Humbaba masks known from Mesopotamia. The latter have been related by Barnett to the similarly grooved masks from the temple of Artemis Orthia at Sparta.49 Our masks could be "the missing link" between these two widely separated groups, both chronologically and geographically. However, here again, a possible reconstruction of our mask (b) prevents its association with the Mesopotamian Humbaba masks. 86</page><page sequence="92">CHAPTER TWELVE CULT STANDS AND CULT BOWLS TALL CYLINDRICAL STANDS (a) A Cult Stand Decorated with Human Figures (Fig. 23; PL 32:1-2). Reg. No. 1367; Locus 133; Level 22.51 m; Stratum X Yellowish-light brown clay. Large and small white grits, medium fired, yellowish-greenish core, reddish- pink decoration. Height 44.2 cm; diameter of base 21.8 cm; diameter of rim 15.2 cm. The upper part of the stand was found on the top step leading up from the south to the raised platform of Temple 131 (see PI. 11:3). The lower part of the stand was found broken, 1 m to the east, in the layer of bricks and ash debris above the floor of the temple. The stand was found broken in many pieces, some of which had become distorted in the fire of the destruction of the building. The stand was wheel-made as a cylinder, open at either end, with an everted, rounded rim. When leather hard, two rows of windows were cut in its walls. The lower row has seven rectangular windows, each 12 cm high and 3-3.5 cm wide. Horizontal grooves delineate the upper and lower borders of the spaces between the windows, The upper row includes four trapezoidal windows, each 16-17 cm high and 6.5-8.0 cm wide. In each of the windows a schematic human figure is shown striding with outstretched hands, the head in profile. The figures were formed by cutting out the windows around the contour lines, in ajour (open work) technique; they are thus an integral part of the vessel fabric. The stubbiness of the legs, which gives the figures a clumsy look, may have been intentional to maintain the stability of the vessel. The body of the figures was schematically rendered, without any detail of dress. After the body was cut, the neck was slightly pinched; the head is a direct continuation of the vessel's wall, and neither head-dress nor coiffure is depicted. The profiled head emphasizes nose and chin. The large ear was the only part of the figure added separately. In two of the figures, the feet are shown in profile. The stand is decorated with horizontal red-purple painted lines, which continue on the figures as well. Painted lines appear on the neck and shoulders of one of the figures. The motif of a procession of human figures with outstretched hands ("Marching Men") is well known in the iconography of the Levant in the second mil- lennium B.C. It is common on Syrian cylinder- seals of the Middle Bronze Age1 and on Mitannian cylinder-seals of the "Common Style", characteristic of Palestine in the 14th- 13th centuries B.C.2 E. Porada has assumed that the motif depicts a row of dancers in ritual or battle dance, an interpretation which may also fit the scene illustrated on our stand. A similar motif appears on three decorated metal bowls of the Iron Age, discovered in Cyprus and dated by E. Gjerstad to the 8th century B.C.3 On two of these bowls, a row of female dancers holding hands is shown in a cult ceremony before a seated goddess. A procession of musicians also appears in the same scenes. A most interesting parallel to the Cypriote motif is seen if we take our cult stand together with a contemporary stand from Ashdod (Stratum X), depicting musicians, probably in a ritual (cf. 1 Samuel 10:5).4 The combination of the representations on these two Philistine cult stands provides an earlier parallel to the representation on the Cypriote bowls. We thus may conclude that both our stand and the "Musicians Stand" from Ashdod depict parts of a ritual scene, while the entire scene, can be seen on the above-mentioned Cypriote bowls. We should also mention a conical seal of the Iron Age I from Tell el-Far'ah (S)5 and a group of scaraboids from the Iron Age II,6 showing two or three human figures with outstretched hands. These may be taken as schematic representations of the "dancers" motif. Despite the great stylistic dif- ferences between these various representations, they seem to indicate a continuation of a single cult practice, from the Middle Bronze to the Iron Age. 87</page><page sequence="93">CHAPTER TWELVE Fig. 23. A cult stand with human figures. Representations of human figures on cult stands are found rarely. The known examples from Israel are all contemporaneous with the cult stand from Tell Q asile: they appear on the two square, building- like cult stands from Beth-Shan V,7 and on the above-mentioned "Musicians Stand" from Ashdod. In these three stands, the human figures were made separately as clay figurines, and then attached to the stand when leather hard. However, the "central" figure and one of the animal heads on the "Musicians Stand" were made in the same open work technique as at Tell Qasile. In a cult stand from Megiddo VI, figures of a nude goddess were separately attached.8 A frieze of human heads appears on a cult stand from Beth-Ullah, in the inner Shephelah, probably from the end of the Iron Age I.9 In other areas and periods, depictions of human figures on cult objects are very rare. Isolated examples are known from Egypt,10 Ugarit11 (both from the Late Bronze Age) and Cyprus (Archaic period).12 However, these 88</page><page sequence="94">Fig. 24. A cult stand with animal figures. CULT STANDS AND CULT BOWLS examples are isolated and differ from one another in style and subject. We may conclude, therefore, that the above-mentioned group of cult stands from Palestine represents a specific artistic trend which developed in the 11th century B.C. along the coast and the Jezreel plain. (b) A Cult Stand with Animal Figures (Fig. 24; PL 32:3-5) Reg. No. 1266; Locus 131; Level 22.10 m; Stratum X Brown clay, medium fired, grey core. The base and the uppermost part of the stand are missing.The 89</page><page sequence="95">CHAPTER TWELVE preserved height is 50 cm. It was found on the floor of the temple of Stratum X, near the southern bench and close to the foundation trench of the medieval well (165), which probably destroyed part of this stand. The animal figures were found separately, one near the body of the stand, and the other, 2 m to the west. The stand is in the form of a cylinder, flaring out toward the base. Three horizontal grooves band the lower part of the body. The two animal figures were made separately and than attached on opposite sides to the upper part of the stand. One complete figure and the back part of a second figure were preserved. The complete figure is 16.5 cm long; its body is a roll of clay to which legs and a tail were attached. The legs are slightly bent and only the feet are actually joined to the stand. The various features of the legs are rendered in detail, except for the feet, which are schematically represented (the toes being emphasized by incisions). The animal is shown crouching on its forepaws, the lowest part of which has not been preserved. The long tail passes between the hind legs and on to the right side of the body, ending on the back. The massive, long neck was made in one piece with the body, with the upper muscles emphasized. The head has long, protruding ears; two prominent ridges form the nose and eyebrows, ending below the ears. Two other ridges on the forehead create a V-shape. The eyes are two small lumps of clay; the nostrils are emphasized by two holes, and the mouth is slightly open. The other animal figure is shown crouching on its hind legs, with its tail attached to the body of the stand. The legs and feet are rendered in a style similar to that of the other figure. These two figures probably sup- ported a bowl forming the upper part of the stand. Traces of the join with the bowl are visible on the chin of the complete figure. The identification of the animals is not clear: they could be either dogs or lionesses. The long head, back-turning ears and long, massive neck are characteristic of depictions of dogs in Late Bronze Age art, as on the gold bowl from Ugarit,13 on the lion and dog orthostat from Beth-Shan IX,14 and especially on an ivory in Mycenaean style from Megiddo,15 in which a dog is shown attacking a mountain goat. This latter is the only artistic de- piction of a dog with a tail resting on its back, like the tails of lions in the Late Bronze artistic tra- dition.16 The dog figures noted on these three objects differ from Egyptian depictions, which usually show the thin, pointed face of the Saluki dog,17 and are closer to the hunting dogs shown in the Assyrian reliefs.18 Since dogs held an important place in ancient Near Eastern religion,19 it is not improbable that the animals on our stand are dogs. On the other hand, in ancient Near Eastern art there is no precedent for a presentation of two dogs in heraldic position. Lions, however, are shown in this manner throughout ancient Near Eastern20 and Aegean art.21 In one example, from Deir el-Medineh in Egypt, a cult stand has two lion figures flanking a Hathor figure.22 Figures of lions appear also on Iron Age cult stands from Palestine, such as on the two stands from Taanach,23 one of the square stands from Beth-Shan V24 and on a fragment of a cult stand from Tell Deir- Alia.25 The latter, which shows an animal with its tail on its back, was identified by the excavator as a lioness. Stylistically, the lion figures on the stands from Taanach (10th century B.C.), as well as pottery lion figures from Megiddo,26 differ greatly from that on our stand. It thus remains unclear whether the artist of the Tell Qasile stand sought to depict figures of dogs, lions or lionesses.27 Perhaps the latter possibility is the most acceptable. (c)-(e) Cylindrical Cult Stands from Shrine 300 Locus 300; Level 20.60 m; Stratum X-X (PI. 33:1) Three cult stands were found in a group, leaning on the plastered steps at the southwestern corner of Shrine 300 (PL 14).

The stand was wheel-made as a cylinder, open at both ends. It tapers upward from a point 6 cm above the base, and becomes angular and narrower toward the neck. Two small, oval windows (2.8 X 5.3 cm) were cut in the body, on opposite sides. The neck has two ridges and the rim is everted and cut obliquely. The body is decorated with seven groups of bands, each of four to seven red painted lines. The upper body is decorated with a frieze of a net pattern, and the lower neck bears a frieze containing eight groups of concentric semi-circles divided by single vertical, wavy lines. The rest of the neck has two groups of horizontal lines, and the rim is also painted. The motifs of concentric semi-circles and vertical wavy lines are characteristic of Philistine pottery. However, the appearance of Philistine dec- oration on a cult stand is unique. This stand probably held the bird-shaped cult bowl (Fig. 29), found lying near its rim. 90</page><page sequence="96">CULT STANDS AND CULT BOWLS Fig. 25. Cylindrical cult stand (reg. 3446). (d) Reg .

One of the two cult bowls found nearby (Fig. 30 or 32) probably stood on it. (e) Reg . No. 3604 (Fig. 27; PL 33:1, right) Brown clay, medium fired, few white grits, light brown slip, black and red-brown decoration. Height 54 cm, maximum diameter 17.5 cm. The cylindrical body widens at the center and narrows again toward the flared base. Unlike the previous stands, the neck is a direct continuation of the body. The flaring rim has a slight ridge on it. Three rectangular windows (4.7 X 8.0 cm) were cut in the body. The stand has five painted bands of geometric design enclosed by black and red lines. The lowest band bears a ladder pattern in black; the second band has intersecting diagonal lines creating rhomboids and triangles filled with dense parallel lines in various directions. The central and widest band, containing the windows, is similarly decorated. The fourth is divided into rectangles, some containing a fill of horizontal lines and others divided into four triangles, two of which are filled in with red paint, creating an "hour-glass" (sometimes called "butterfly") motif. The uppermost band has rectangles containing an "hour-glass" motif, but larger than the band below it. The decoration was not precisely done, as is especially noticeable in the two lowest bands, where the lines are not parallel to one another and the design is not well integrated. On the other hand, the two uppermost bands are well done. Some of the motifs composing the decorative de- sign on this stand are known on Philistine pottery, yet the design as a whole cannot be considered typical of the Philistine style. The continuous ladder pattern, for example, is unparalleled on Philistine pottery. The "hour-glass" pattern, however, rarely appears on Philistine pottery (on a stirrup-jar from Locus 188 in our excavations, on a jug from Beth- Shemesh, and on a box lid from Gezer.28 A frieze of this motif is known only on a Philistine stirrup-jar from Gezer and on a strainer jug from Megiddo (the latter dated to the 10th century B.C.).29 On cult stands this motif appears only once, on a stand from Beth-Shan V.30 The motif is known also in Cyprus, both in the Late Cypriote III period (on a local Mycenaean Illclb kr√°ter, and in Cypro-Geometric pottery).31 (f) Fragments of a Cult Stand Reg. No. 3507 ; Locus 275; Level 21.60 m; Str. XI. Several body fragments of a cult stand which could not be restored, including remains of triangular windows. These are the only examples of triangular windows on cult stands at Tell Qasile. Discussion Stands (a), (c)-(e) from Tell Qasile are part of a large group of cylindrical cult stands, open at both ends, known all over the ancient Near East from the 3rd millennium B.C. on.32 In Palestine several examples are known from the Early. Bronze Age,33 but the type becomes more common in the Middle Bronze Age, of which there are many examples at Naharia, Megiddo and Gezer.34 Of the Late Bronze Age, such stands were discovered at Hazor, Lachish, Tell Jemeh and Tell Deir-'Alla.35 Two stands from Tel Shera,36 of the end of the Late Bronze Age or beginning of the Iron Age, closely resemble stands (c)-(e) from Tell Qasile, while most other examples from the Late Bronze Age are of different shape and decoration. Outside Palestine, cult stands from the Late Bronze Age are known especially at Ugarit,37 as well as at Tell Billa and Nuzi (the two latter examples are of the Late Bronze Age I).38 In Egypt, cult stands of typical local shape are known throughout the 2nd mil- lennium B.C.39 In Cyprus and in the Mycenaean sphere, cult stands of this type were unknown during the Late Bronze Age, but they do appear in the Minoan culture, from MM II until the Sub-Minoan period,40 as well as at Troy.41 In comparison with the large number of temples of the Middle and Late Bronze Ages excavated all over the Levant, the number of cult stands from these periods is rather small. This places further weight upon the comparatively large number of cult stands of this type dated to the 11th- 10th centuries B.C. found in Israel. The best examples are from Beth- Shan and Megiddo. Only one stand was attributed to Stratum VI at Beth-Shan,42 while a large number of stands and stand fragments were attributed to Stratum V there, which is contemporary to Stratum X at Tell Qasile. Of the nine more or less complete stands found at Beth-Shan four are decorated with snakes, birds and leaves plastically rendered and applied to the body.43 This type is characteristic only of Beth-Shan in the 1 1th century B.C., and it closely resembles the two square, building-like stands from that same stratum (see above, p. 88). Four ad- ditional stands, all from the southern temple of Stratum V,44 are decorated with rich geometric de- signs resembling the ornamentation of the con- 93</page><page sequence="99">CULT STANDS AND CULT BOWLS contemporaneous stand (e) from Tell Qasile. Loop handles appearing on the stands at Beth-Shan do not appear at Tell Qasile. A similar phenomenon can be seen at Megiddo. While in Stratum VII A, of the early 12th century B.C. only an upper part of one stand was found,45 four stands were attributed to Stratum VIA, of the late 11th century B.C.46 It is interesting to note that some of these stands were found in Area C-C, at the southern part of the mound, which was a common dwelling area. This shows .that the stands were used in house cults in addition to their use in the temple. Other cult stands from the Iron Age I were found at Tel Sippor, Tell Qiri (Hazorea, where it was found with its cult bowl), Ai, Hazor and Tell Deir-'Alla (where two fragmentary stands with painted dec- oration were found.)47 Cylindrical stands continued in common use during the 10th century B.C., as is shown by ex- amples from Megiddo IVB-VA, Tel Amai and the cult room of Stratum V at Lachish,48 the examples at the latter site found with their cult bowls, as at Tell Qasile. The stands from this century are un- derrated, except for the stand from Megiddo, decorated in black, red and white stripes, char- acteristic of the bichrome pottery group of the Iron Age. A complete stand from a 7th century B.C. context in Jerusalem is an isolated example from this period,49 while in other Iron Age II sites, fragments of stands (the complete shapes of which are unknown) were found.50 Outside Palestine, cylindrical stands open at the top are very rare in the Iron Age. Two such miniature stands were found at Kition and another at Idalion in Cyprus.51 Stand (b) from Tell Qasile is the only example on our site of a second type of cult stand, consisting of a cult bowl joined to a cylindrical body, a sort of elaboration of a chalice. This type is known in Egypt and Mesopotamia already in the 3rd millennium B.C., but in Palestine it appears for the first time around the end of the Middle Bronze Age and the beginning of the Late Bronze Age.52 During most of the Late Bronze Age, this type is not represented in the finds, but it reappears in the Iron Age I, at Hazor XI, Megiddo VI, and Ashdod X,53 and continues to appear in the 10th century B.C. at Megiddo and Tel Amai.54 Several other cult stands of this type should probably be dated to the end of the Iron Age I or to the 10th century B.C.,55 during which period such cult stands were also made of stone.56 Outside Palestine, such stands are known in various strata Alalakh, Byblos and at Myrtou Pigadhes in Cyprus.57 Two isolated examples from the Late Iron Age, in Phoenician style, were found in the Archaic temple at Meniko in Cyprus.58 The unique concept underlying stand (b) from Tell Qasile, in which the bowl is supported by two opposed animal figures, however, finds no parallel in any of the above ex- amples.58*1 An elaborate variation of the chalice-like stands is the square stands ending in a flat bowl. These are always decorated with rich plastic decoration. The earliest example is from Stratum VIII at Megiddo.59 Three examples are dated to the 1 1th century B.C. (one from Megiddo VI and two house-shaped stands from Beth-Shan V),60 while three additional ex- amples, the most elaborate of this group, were found at Taanach and Megiddo and are dated to the 10th century B.C.61 In addition to the above-mentioned stands, many fragments of undefinable stands have been published from various sites, from the Middle Bronze Age II to the Iron Age II.62 The survey of the finds has led us to the following conclusions: (1) Cult stands with and without attached bowls appear side-by-side in the Levant, from the Middle Bronze Age down to the 10th century B.C. The open cylindrical stands begin appearing in this area already in the Early Bronze Age. After the 10th century B.C., both types appear only sporadically. The stands with bowls are rare in comparison to the open cylindrical type. (2) During the Iron Age I, and especially during the 1 1th century B.C., cult stands were very popular in Palestine, remaining common also in the 10th century B.C. The cult stands from this period out- number those of the Late Bronze Age, and they show more variation in shape and decoration. (3) The shapes of the stands from Tell Qasile do not have close parallels amongst the Late Bronze Age cult stands from Palestine, though there are similarities to Late Bronze Age cylindrical stands from Syria. The closest early parallels to our stands are the two examples from Tel Shera, from c. 1200 B.C.; similar examples can also be found in the varied group of cult stands from Beth-Shan V and Megiddo VI, of the 11th century B.C. (4) There is no consistency in the shape of the windows of the cult stands. In all periods, rectangular, oval, triangular and small circular windows appear contemporaneously. At Tell Qasile, 94</page><page sequence="100">CULT STANDS AND CULT BOWLS the rounded rectangular windows are dominant, though triangular windows also appear.63 (5) Loop handles appear on many of the cy- lindrical stands of the Middle and Late Bronze Ages, and are very common on the cult stands of the 1 1th century B.C. in Palestine. However, they do not appear on the cult stands from Tell Qasile and Tel Sippor, or on Late Iron Age cult stands. (6) The decoration of the cult stands is related to the contemporaneous techniques of pottery decoration. During the Middle and Late Bronze periods, rope decoration and various incised patterns were common, but already in the Middle Bronze Age painted decoration, including human figures, appears on the stands from Megiddo. On Late Bronze Age cult stands from Gezer and Tel Shera, we see painted decoration in a style characteristic of the pottery decoration of the period, while on other cult stands of the same period rope decoration and incisions continue to appear. During the Iron Age I, painted decoration became very common. The decorative motifs on the cult stands from Beth-Shan close- ly resemble those at Tell Qasile, and include net patterns, triangles, "hour-glasses", and groups of horizontal and diagonal lines, yet they do not include characteristic Philistine motifs as does one stand from Tell Qasile. Decoration of applied figures, such as on stand (b) at Tell Qasile, is rare in the Bronze Age, but becomes more common in the Iron Age I (though no parallels to the figures at Tell Qasile could be found). The open work technique used in stand (a) is paralleled only in the "Musicians Stand" from Ashdod. The procession of human figures and the two heraldic animals are an important addition to the list of motifs appearing as plastic decoration on 1 1th century B.C. stands, which include nude goddesses, musicians, human-heads, snakes, birds, animals and animal legs. Incised decoration is rare during this period. The rich and varied decoration of stands in the Iron Age I, especially during the 11th century B.C., is an in- dication of the unconventional and vivid art of the period. The artistic tradition reflected by the decoration of the 11th century B.C. stands does not continue into the 10th century B.C. The cult stands of this latter century are either plain or are decorated in the Phoenician bichrome style (e.g., the stand from Megiddo IVB-VA). The motifs on the square stands from Taanach and Megiddo reflect the Phoenician and Syrian influence on local art during the 10th century B.C. Various explanations have been raised in regard to the function of the cult stands. C.F.A. Schaefler in- terpreted them as incense stands, in which coals were burned.64 However, the lack of traces of fire would negate this theory. Several stands from Ugarit were explained by Sehaeffer as libation funnels, used in connection with the cult of the dead, and Nilsson explained the Minoan stands in a similar manner.65 Rowe suggested that the stands were used for holding sacred plants, used in agricultural fertility rituals.66 McCown, and recently Lapp and Courtois, explained them as "libation stands".67 The two lat- ter explanations are based on various artistic representations from the ancient Near East. The last explanation is based on Egyptian New Kingdom representations, showing kings and gods pouring liquids into such stands, on which lotus flowers or libation vessels are placed.68 Albright concluded that the specific function of the stands could not be determined, and that they may have been used for various functions: libation, incense burning and for holding sacred plants.69 In discussing stands of the 3rd millennium B.C., Delougaz arrived at the same general conclusion, though he emphasized that their main function was to support various cult vessels.70 In any case, the term "incense stands", common in archaeological literature, is baseless. Some of the cult stands from the end of the Late Bronze Age to the 10th century B.C. discovered in Israel were found together with cult bowls (see below, pp. 96-100). It is clear, therefore, that at least in this period the main function of the stand was to support such cult bowls, the stands themselves not having any other specific function. Thus, the cylindrical stands without attached bowls had basically the same function as the chalice-like stands with attached bowls. The stands from Tell Qasile, Lachish and Beth-Shan were found within temple buildings, sometimes near a raised platform on which the figure of a deity stood. It is most probable that ritual meals were served to the deities in the cult bowls supported by the stands, while other special vessels were used for libation. Albright, following Ingholt,71 claimed that ritual stands of our type should be identified with the hammanim mentioned in the Bible (Lev. 26:30, Isaiah 17:8, Ezekiel 6:5-6, II Chron. 14:4; 34:7). Ingholt showed that the word hamman in Tadmoric meant "incense altar," and Albright claimed that the root of the word was hmm, connected with the 95</page><page sequence="101">CHAPTHR TW E LV H function of the vessel as an incense burner. However, since the function of these vessels as incense burners is baseless, their identification with the biblical hammanim remains doubtful.72 LOW CYLINDRICAL STANDS In addition to the five tall cylindrical stands, two lower stands were found in Shrine 300. One, found on the northern bench of the shrine (see PI. 14:1) is 21.5 cm in diameter and 23 cm high. The second was found amongst the brick debris in Room 229, in the front part of the shrine. Its upper diameter is 19 cm; it is 18.5 cm high, and it has two small, round holes in its wall (drawings of both these stands will appear in Part Two). Similar low stands are known in various periods and are usually explained as stands for carrying storage-jars.73 In several cases they were found in cult contexts: in Fosse Temple I at Lachish,74 and at Tomb 912 D at Megiddo, of the Late Bronze Age, in which a stand of this sort carried a bowl which probably contained a ritual meal for the dead.75 A similar stand was found in the temple at Kition in Cyprus, for which Karageorghis has found parallels in the Minoan culture.76 CULT BOWLS Four complete cult bowls and several fragments of such bowls were found at Tell Qasile, most in connection with cylindrical stands. One bowl was found in Temple 131 of Stratum X, and the three others are from Shrine 300. The bowls are wheel- made and three of them are decorated with heads and wings of birds, separately moulded in clay and added in the leather hard stage. To this group we may add a chalice from Stratum XI, bearing similar de- coration. (a)-(d) Bird-Shaped Cult Bowls (a) Reg .

It has a rounded body, flat, everted rim and a tang base to facilitate stability on the stand. A bird's head, tail and four stylized wings are attached to the rim. The bird has a short neck, pinched-in head, two eyes made of small pieces of clay, and a flat, broad beak. The head is decorated in red and black paint: horizontal black lines on the neck, black dots marking the eyes, and black and red lines on the head. The tail is split, like a fish-tail, and is decorated with dense, parallel red and black lines. The short wings are turned backwards slightly and bear short black and red painted lines on their upper surfaces. The rim is decorated with short black lines. The typical shape of the beak leads us to identify the bird as a "Shoveler" duck (Anas Clypeata).11 97</page><page sequence="103">CHAPTER TWELVE Fig. 31. Fragments of bird-shaped cult bowls (1:5).

The bowl was found on the floor of Room 229, the front room of Shrine 300 (PI. 16:4). It completes the set of three cult stands and two cult bowls found within the shrine. The bowl has a rounded body, everted rim which thickens within, and a pointed base. A bird neck and head is attached within the bowl. The neck is elongated and the head, which rises above the level of the rim, is slightly pinched and has two eyes which were separately made of two small, rounded pieces of clay. The beak is missing. The interior of the bowl is decorated with eight red-painted radial lines, symmetrically arranged. The rim is painted with short red lines. The neck of the bird bears three red bands and the eyes are encircled by a red line, a red dot emphasizing the eyeball. (d) Fragments of Bird-Shaped Cult Bowls (Fig. 31) (d J Reg.

Discussion Few examples of cult bowls are known from Bronze Age sites in Israel. Ruth Amiran has suggested that two "double bowls" from the Early Bronze Age found at Gezer and Tel-Aviv had a cultic function atop cult stands.78 Two such bowls, with holes in the base, are known from the end of the Middle Bronze Age: at Megiddo, Stratum X-IX (Area B-B), and at Tell el-Far'ah (N).79 Only one clear example is known from the Late Bronze Age: a simple bowl with a rounded, pierced base, found on a cylindrical stand near the raised platform in Fosse Temple III at Lachish.80 The main parallels to our bowls can be found in strata of the 1 1th- 10th centuries B.C. These can be divided into three types: bird-shaped bowls, plain bowls, and bowls decorated with a garland of leaves. The first type, of which three examples were found at Tell Qasile, is represented also at Megiddo and Tell es-Safi.81 The example from Megiddo, Stratum VIA, is a carinated bowl with the wings and tail of a bird; Fig. 33. Bird-shaped chalice. the bird's head and the base have not been preserved. The bowl from Tell es-Safi is only 14 cm in diameter. A bird figurine is attached to its inner part, flanked by two snakes (uraei). The bird's beak rests on a lotus flower, attached to the outside of the bowl. The base has not been preserved, but an examination of the object (now at the Rockefeller Museum) has led us to suggest that it was originally attached to a small stand. Its date cannot be determined on stratigraphie grounds, but stylistic similarities with the cult bowls from Tell Qasile indicate its probable attribution to the Iron Age I. Fragmentary bird figurines were also found in Ashdod (Strata XII-XI), Gezer, Tell Jerisheh,82 and at Tell Qasile itself (see below, p. 113). A similar bird's head was found at Enkomi in Cyprus, near the temple of the 1 2th- 1 1th centuries B.C.83 All of these figurines may well have originally been attached to cult bowls, similar to those found at Tell Qasile. The prototype of bird-shaped cult bowls can be found in a group of similarly decorated bowls found at the New Kingdom site of Deir el-Medineh in Egypt.84 The latter may have been inspired by the richly-decorated Canaanite metal vessels illustrated in Egyptian paintings, some of which have pairs of antithetic bird heads,85 and others, rows of bird heads on the rim.86 Several objects of clay, ivory and stone, from Egypt and Canaan, dating to the Middle and Late Bronze Ages, are decorated with bird heads. These include ivory cosmetic boxes (which will be 99</page><page sequence="105">CHAPTER TWKLVH discussed in Part Two), Egyptian stone vases,87 zoomorphic pottery vessels found in Middle Bronze Age contexts,88 a serpentine bowl from Tell el-Ajjul, and a broken alabaster bowl from the same site, re- constructed as having a bird head, and a limestone bowl from Cemetery 900 at Tell el Far' ah (S), with a bird head.89 In the Aegean world, however, only one example is known: the famous crystal bowl from Grave Circle B at Mycenae, dating to the Middle Helladic Period.90 Since this artistic tradition does not continue in the Mycenaean culture, the origin of the bird-shaped cult bowls from Tell Qasile should probably be traced to either Egyptian or Canaanite Late Bronze traditions. The popularity of the bird motif in Philistine art is well attested on pottery, where a bird, in a clear Mycenaean artistic tradition, is one of the most common motifs,91 as well as from the Medinet-Habu reliefs, where the ships of the "Sea Peoples" are decorated with birds' heads.92 The birds were ap- parently sacred to the Philistines, as to other "Sea Peoples", perhaps because of the role they played in sea navigation.93 Finally, we should mention similar plastic de- coration of birds' heads, wings and tails, which appears on askoi from Cyprus in the Early Cypro- Geometric period, starting in the mid- 11th century B.C.94 The similarity of the latter's style of dec- oration with that of our bowls, as well as the date of their appearance in Cyprus, has led us to assume that there must be a relationship between these two groups of cult objects. This is another indication for the cultural link between Cyprus and the Philistine culture during the 11th century B.C. The second type of cult bowls - plain bowls with no plastic decoration - of which there is one example at Tell Qasile (bowl [e] above), is paralleled by three other examples: a bowl from Tell Qiri (Hazorea), found with a cult stand in an 1 1th century B.C. context; a bowl with a hollow cylindrical tang from the Iron Age I settlement at Ai, and a bowl from the cult room at Lachish, Stratum V (10th century B.C.), found together with cylindrical stands.95 The third type of Iron Age cult bowls, decorated with a plastic garland of leaves, begins appearing during the 11th century B.C.,96 becomes popular during the 10th century B.C.,97 and continues to appear during the 8th-7th centuries B.C., in the Phoenician culture.98 The lack of this type in Philistia, its appearance at Megiddo in the bichrome Phoenician technique, and the decoration, probably a schematic rendering of the lotus motif so popular in Phoenician art, show that this type should be at- tributed to the Phoenician and Israelite cultures. In addition to the three types of cult bowls men- tioned above, ordinary chalices, as well as "cups and saucers", were sometimes placed on top of cult stands.99 The function of the composite cult stand and bowl has been discussed above (p. 95). In summary, it can be said that cult bowls used together with cult stands were most common in the 11th- 10th centuries B.C. Of the three types men- tioned, the bird-shaped bowls are limited in time to the 11th century B.C., while the plain bowl type begins to appear in the Late Bronze Age and con- tinues during the Iron Age II. 100</page><page sequence="106">CHAPTER THIRTEEN LIBATION VESSELS ZOOMORPHIC RHYTON (Fig. 34; PL 35) Reg. No. 2256; Locus 125; Level 20.15 m; Stratum XI Brown-reddish clay, light brown core, well fired, yellowish slip, reddish-purple and black decoration. Length 13.5 cm, height 12.8 cm, diameter of rim 13.3 cm. The vessel was found broken in Pit 125 close to the anthropomorphic vessel (Fig. 18). All the fragments were found and the vessel was completely restored. The rhyton was wheel-made as a cup with a simple rim and a rounded ridge below it. A flattened loop handle stretches from the rim to the middle of the body. The lower part of the vessel was moulded in the shape of an animal's head, probably a lion (see below). The moulding was done both by adding pieces of clay to the vessel when it was leather hard and by pressing the vessel from the inside. The details of the face were emphasized with paint. The two small ears were outlined in black, with one diagonal line across their center. Between the ears, at the top of the forehead, is a broken projection, the complete shape of which is unknown. Below the ears is a horizontal red line, from which three shorter vertical Fig. 34. Zoomorphic rhyton (2:5). 101</page><page sequence="107">CHAPTER THIRTEEN lines descend towards the nose. The eyebrows consist of two curved black lines which meet at the ridge of the nose. The eyes are made as elliptical projections, outlined in black. A wide vertical black line marks the eyeball, a naturalistic feature of a lion's eye. The nose is represented by a long, flat ridge decorated with a black painted ladder pattern. The cheeks are emphasized by rounded projections, outlined in black and decorated within by a star pattern in black and red. The mouth is open and the upper lip is thick and over-emphasized. Two nostrils were pierced on the upper lip, at the end of the nose. The tongue and four teeth were separately added to the lower lip. The tongue is painted red and the teeth are set at an angle, as if to illustrate the fangs in perspective. The mouth is outlined in red. The body of the rhyton is decorated with a frieze of geometric designs enclosed by two groups of lines, each consisting of a black line between two red lines. The decoration within the frieze is in black only. On the front, above the lion's forehead, two triglyphs made of four black vertical lines enclose a metope with a double spiral pattern with a wavy line between. On the other side, the decoration consists of two groups of geometric de- signs, each having a wavy line enclosed by three vertical lines on each side. Near the handle is a ladder pattern. The handle itself is decorated in black in a schematic plant-like motif. This frieze is charac- teristic of the Philistine decorative style. Our rhyton is the most elaborate, and the only complete example, of a group of similar rhytons known from the Iron Age I. The four other examples were found at Megiddo, Tell es-Safi, Tell Jerisheh1 and Tell Zeror.2 The rhyton from Tell Jerisheh was found in an Iron Age I stratum; that from Tel Zeror was found in a cemetery which contained Iron Age I tombs (although the object itself was not found in a clear context); the examples from Megiddo and Tell es-Safi were found out of context. Trude Dothan, who defined these rhytons as part of the Philistine material culture (note 1), has emphasized the stylistic differences between those from Tell es-Safi and Megiddo as opposed to that from Tell Jerisheh. The first two are naturalistically rendered and their rich decoration resembles that of the Philistine pottery at its peak. The rhyton from Tel Zeror resembles these two examples in its naturalistic style, which is especially noticeable in the way the eyes and lips were made. The fragmentary rhyton from Tell Jerisheh is surprisingly similar to the one from Tell Qasile; many details, such as the diagonal teeth, tongue, open mouth, nose, eyes and cheeks, are similarly rendered, and thus it is most probable that both were made in the same workshop and perhaps even by the same artist. The identification of the animal on the rhytons from Tell Qasile and Tell Jerisheh as a lion is not definite. The relatively elongated mouth and the large, protruding upper lip seems to differ from the usual depictions of lions' heads in the older rhytons and other objects noted below. It has even been suggested that our rhyton depicts a pig.3 But on the basic of the length of the head, the angle of the mouth in relation to the nose, the shape of the ears and of the eyes, and the protruding tongue, it would be preferable to identify the animal as a stylized lion's head. This group of five rhytons can be related to the Philistine culture or the culture of other "Sea Peo- ples" in Palestine. Closely related parallels to this group are Aegean stone and metal examples which predate the Philistine period by hundreds of years.4 The best examples are the lion-shaped gold rhyton from Shaft Grave IV at Mycenae, of the 16th century B.C.,5 and an alabaster rhyton from the "Temple Treasure" at Knossos, from the Late Minoan I period.6 Another broken rhyton of the same type was found at Delphi.7 Other types of animal-shaped rhytons are known in the Mycenaean and Minoan cultures,8 and are shown in Egyptian wall-paintings from Thebes as being brought by Keftiu? However, there is a long chronological gap between the appearance of the object in the Aegean world and its appearance in the Philistine culture. This gap may be explained simply as due to a lack of finds in the Aegean from the latter centuries of the Late Bronze Age. However, one could also claim that the Aegean rhyton type was accepted in the East already in an early phase of the Late Bronze Age, and that rhytons in this tradition continued to be produced in the Levant throughout the Late Bronze Age. Such a process would explain the fact that, in the wall-paintings from Thebes, Syrians are shown holding rhytons of Aegean type,10 as well as the appearance of a lion-shaped rhyton on the Megiddo ivory from the Lage Bronze Age II, where it is shown on a tray, behind the enthroned king.11 The Philistine rhytons, therefore, either reflect a direct Aegean artistic tradition or are a continuation of a local Canaanite tradition arising under Aegean influence during the Late Bronze Age. A fragmentary pottery lion's head was discovered 102</page><page sequence="108">LIBATION VESSELS Fig. 35. Lion face on a fragmentary cult object from Area B. during the first season at Tell Qasile in an unstratified context in Area B, and was attributed to Strata VIII- VII (see Fig. 35).12 It is of brown clay with a grey core, and has a slightly burnished red slip. The eyes were made as rounded clay lumps and the eyebrows are of clay ridges which continue the line of the rectangular, projecting nose. This head, 5.5 cm high, is not necessarily part of a rhyton. It could have been part of a square cult stand, of the type discovered at Megiddo and Taanach (see above, p. 94). Its workmanship suits a date either at the end of the 11th century or the 10th century B.C. (Strata X- VIII). As a parallel, we should mention a pottery lion's head from Ashdod, Stratum X (10th century B.C.), which, according to the excavator, was part of a lion statue.13 Parallels to such statues are known from Megiddo (lion-shaped pottery statues) and from Ugarit (a pottery lion's head, probably part of a statue).14 The lion-shaped rhytons, zoomorphic masks, fragmentary lion's head from Tell Qasile and Ashdod, and the lionesses (?) on the cylindrical cult stand from Tell Qasile, emphasize the popularity of the lion motif in Philistine art, as it was in all branches of Near Eastern and Aegean art.15 The animal-shaped rhytons may have been in- tended to be used either as cult vessels or as elaborate secular vessels which could also be used for cult purposes. The latter explanation was suggested by Nilsson and others for the elaborate rhytons in the Aegean world.16 ZOOMORPHIC "TRICK VASE" (Fig. 36; PL 36:1-2) Reg. No. 1243; Locus 134; Level 22.42 m; Stratum X Light brown clay, few white grits, even-medium fired, brown-reddish slip, slightly burnished on the outside, traces of fire on the lower part. Diameter 11.7 cm, height 8.7 cm. This vessel is essentially a cylindrical cup with a rounded base, a twisted handle and a round spout perpendicular to the handle. An Fig. 36. Zoomorphic Trick Vase'. 103</page><page sequence="109">CHAPTER THIRTEEN animal's face was moulded on the base of the cup by adding clay when the body was leather hard. The ears are small and triangular; the eyes are of two strips of rolled clay, of which the eyeball of only one was emphasized by a smaller lump of clay. Two vertical ridges which start below the ears end in two protruding nostrils. The closed mouth was made as two horizontal ridges. Between the ears are four vertical grooves. Thus a schematic and stylized animal face was created. The identification of this animal is problematic. It may be a schematic rendering of a lion,17 a bull or cow (although the head lacks horns) or even a hippopotamus, as the small and narrow eyes and wide mouth may indicate. A number of hippopotamus bones found in the courtyards of the temple show that this animal was well known to the people of Tell Qasile, and it may have some cultic significance.18 The upper part of the vessel was closed by a kind of inner funnel which was attached to the vessel when it was leather hard. This funnel ends in an inner tube adjoining the bottom of the interior. The tube is pierced at the bottom. A tubular spout, only partly preserved, is attached to the body of the vessel below the rim. The vase could have been used as a sophisticated libation vessel. It would have been filled with liquid through the inner funnel and when turned upside down, the liquid would remain in the closed cylinder around the funnel, and could have been poured out only through the spout. When holding the vessel, the spout could be blocked with a finger and then turned upside down, thus showing the animal face on top and preventing the spilling of the liquid. The vessel has no direct parallel. The only related vessel from this country is a Late Bronze Age cult vessel from Tell Deir 'Alia, in the form of a life-size duck with a hollow funnel which led up from the inside of the foot till it almost touched the inside of the animal's back.19 A similar idea is known in Cypriote askoi of the Geometric period, termed as "trick vases."20 However, in both the vessel from Tell Deir 'Alia and the Cypriote examples, the inner tube starts from the bottom of the vessel and the shapes of the vessels are totally different from ours. It may tentatively be suggested that the idea behind this type of vessel can be traced from its early appearance in the Canaanite culture, through the Philistine culture which, in turn, could have transmitted it to Cyprus. Although further evidence is necessary, the development of this idea could be an indication of the constant inter- relations between the Philistines and Cyprus during the 12th and 11th centuries B.C.

Only five of the six bodies are preserved. They are arranged in two symmetrical rows of three, the lower row being arranged in the spaces of the upper row. The six parts were connected to the tube by pierced holes. Two horizontal handles were attached to the upper part of the tube. This unique object probably served as a libation vessel. There are no direct parallels, apart from a fragment from Gezer, attributed by Macalister to the "Fourth Semitic Period", which could have been part of a similar vessel.21 Both the origin and the significance of this unusual vessel are unknown. It is probable that the lower parts depict a kind of fruit, such as the citron or fig. CULTIC JAR (Fig. 38; PI. 31:6) Reg.

A cult jar. ro5</page><page sequence="111">CHAPTER THIRTEEN fragments of this vessel were found scattered over a large area inside and outside of the temple. The complete neck was found near the top of the raised platform of Temple 131, several centimeters below the lime floor (1 18) of Stratum IX. Pieces of the body were found on the floor of Courtyard 111, around the foundation of the square altar. This shows that the vessel was broken and its fragments scattered before the temple was set on fire. The vessel is a large, two handled jar, the lower part of the body and the base of which are missing. The neck is composed of an inner cylinder with an inner diameter of 1 1 cm surrounded by four "kidney- shaped" openings. This unusual form of neck was achieved by forming two clay cylinders, the outer one subsequently being pressed in at four points when both were leather hard. The completed neck was attached to the body of the vessel and a ridge marks the join of neck to body. The moulded rim recalls the rims of Irorf Age I kraters. The body flares out toward the bottom and has gently sloping shoulders, to which two loop handles were attached. The neck and upper part of the body were decorated with three horizontal bands, painted in black over a burnished red slip. The lower band is of a net pattern; the middle one is filled with a row of triangles bordered by two horizontal lines; the upper one con- tains fourteen plants. Eight of these plants have stems with five to seven branches, some with painted dots above, and the other six have elliptical tops. This motif appears to be either a schematic rendering of alternating closed and open papyrus or lotus plants, inspired by Egyptian art,22 or merely a depiction of two different kinds of trees, the branched tree recalling the common Canaanite motif of the "tree- of-life". The decoration was carelessly executed; the lines, including those representing the stem, are crooked and irregular. Unnecessary dots and lines appear in the design. A figure of a bird was painted on the body of the vessel, near the bottom of one of the handles; it is schematically rendered, the body a mere few lines; the legs are long and heavy in relation to the body; the wings and tail are represented by parallel curved lines; the neck and body form one continuous line, with no details. This crude figure is very far-removed from the bird motif so common on Philistine pottery. The handles of the vessel are decorated with a "ladder" pattern, and the rim is painted on the outside. The complete shape of this vessel cannot be reconstructed, and no parallels are known. Its base was probably flat, to enable it to stand freely on the temple floor. The function of this vessel can only be conjectured; it could have been a container for liquids used in the cult, yet it may have been used for holding sacred plants, like similar large jars shown in artistic depictions from the various periods and cultures of the ancient Near East and the Aegean as pots for sacred plants.23 A plant could have been place in the central opening, while the four outer openings may have served for watering it or libating into it. The plant motif, which is very rare on such large vessels, may be taken as a hint toward this interpretation of our vessel. CULT BOWLS WITH TUBULAR RIM (" KERNOS BOWLS") (a) Cult Bowl with Bulls' Heads (Fig. 39:a; PI. 37:1) Reg. No. 2114; Locus 188; Level 21.84 m; Stratum X Brown, well-levigated clay, small black grits, medium fired, light brown slip. The bowl was found upside down, at the bottom of the heap of vessels in Room 188 of Temple 131. It is wheel-made, 18.8 cm long and is elliptical in shape, with rounded base. The potter squeezed the bowl between his hands and thus obtained the peculiar shape. The rim, formed by folding its edge inward, is tubular, oval in section, and pointed at the top. Two spouts were made separately on the wheel, and attached to the rim. The one at the front is upright, while the other rests on the inside of the bowl. Both spouts are thickened at the end; the inner one has two horns, separately made, and attached to the spout, whilst the outer spout shows markings of similar horns. Thus the spouts are schematic renderings of bulls' heads. On the rim, above the inner spout, are traces of a projection, broken in antiquity. The upper, outer part of the bowl is decorated with groups of horizontal and vertical black lines, enclosed at the bottom by a horizontal red line. (b) Fragment of a Cult Bowl (Fig. 39:b) Reg.

Cult bowls with tubular rim. includes part of the body and the rim, and a part of a spout. Like the previous bowl, this one also has a trace of an upper part, attached to the top of the rim, but of unknown shape. The rim is decorated with a row of concentric black semi-circles, with two groups of red bands below. The upper part of the rim is painted with alternate short red and black lines. Discussion The concept of a tube within the body of a cult bowl appears already in the Early Bronze Age, on a bowl from Temple 4040 at Megiddo.24 A contem- poraneous bowl from Byblos has a tubular rim, with a row of cups on top.25 A similar idea appears in Egypt during the Middle Kingdom.26 These isolated examples may be regarded as prototypes of the bowls, appearing for the first time in the Late Bronze Age. The following are the principal known examples of this type of bowl: Late Bronze Age: Several fragments were found at Hazor, in the Late Bronze Age II cult complexes in Areas F and H.27 Three fragments of a similar bowl were found north of the Fosse Temples at Lachish, and were attributed to Fosse Temple III.28 A complete bowl from Beth-Shemesh, with two animal- shaped spouts,29 was attributed by Grant to Stratum "Sub-Ill", while Wright attributed it to Stratum IV. Stratigraphically, this bowl should be dated either to the Late Bronze Age or to the Iron Age I. Another fragment from Gezer30 was attributed to the "Second Semitic Period", but its exact date cannot be determined. Iron Age: a complete Iron Age I bowl from Tell Deir 'Alia31 is similar to that from Beth- Shemesh. (The suggestion of the excavator, to identify the animal on the inner spout as a fox and to define the bowl as intended for feeding infants, seems unfounded, see below, p. 108). A fragmentary bowl was found in Stratum III at Beth-Shemesh,32 the inner spout of which is in the shape of an undefined animal whose feet can be seen on the bottom of the bowl. Another complete bowl with a similar undefined animal was found at the cemetery at Azor and dated to the 11th or 10th century B.C.33 An animal-shaped spout from such a bowl was discovered in a 10th century B.C. tomb at Tell Eitun.34 A variant of such a bowl was found, in an undated context, at Tel Kishion (Valley of Jezreel), and tentatively dated to the Iron Age I.35 It has two connected bull-shaped spouts, yet lacks a tube around the rim. The concept of a tubular rim with 107</page><page sequence="113">CHAPTER THIRTEEN attached zoomorphic spouts is found in the Iron Age I also on a krater from Khirbet Raddana, and on a jar from Gezer, tentatively attributed to the same period.36 Fragments of similar bowls were also found on Iron Age II sites as Megiddo Stratum III, Samaria, Tell en-Nasbeh, Ashdod, and Tell Jemmeh.37 The Israel Department of Antiquities and Museums possesses a complete bowl of this same type which, in technique of execution, recalls Iron Age II kernoi from Ashdod,38 and has a close parallel in one of the bowls from Cyprus (see below). Several bowls of the same type were found in Cyprus.39 Three of these are dated to the earliest phase of the C y pro-Geometric period (White Painted I).40 They all have a basket handle, an inner spout in the shaped of a frog and an outer spout in the shape of a bull. Another example was dated to the C y pro- Geometric II period,41 and still another bowl dated to the C y pro-Geometric III period (in Red Slip I [III]).42 The latter is similar to that at the Department of Antiquities and Museums, just mentioned, and therefore may be regarded as an import from the Levant. This survey shows that bowls with tubular rims began appearing in the Canaanite culture of the Late Bronze Age, became popular during the Iron Age I and continued to appear throughout the Iron Age II in Israel. They appear in Cyprus in the Cypro- Geometric I period, while their popularity there declines during the later Geometric period. It seems, therefore, that the type appeared in Cyprus as a result of the close cultural ties between its culture and that of the Levant in the 1 1th century B.C. The exact function of these bowls is difficult to assess, though it is clear that they were used as libation vessels. The angle and position of the spouts prevent practicable use. At the most, one could pour small quantities of liquids through the spout by turning the bowl slightly backward, then filling the tubular rim, and by tipping it forward, the liquid would then pour out of the front spout. KERNOI (RING VESSELS)43 Six fragments of kernos rims and one small vessel from a kernos were found in the excavations. Some of the zoomorphic spouts (which will be discussed separately below) may originally have been parts of kernoi. (a) Ring fragment (Fig. 40:a ; PI. 40:5) Reg. No. 1068/1; Locus 110; Level 21.20 m; Stratum XII Brown clay, medium fired, black core. The outer diameter of the rim is c. 17.5 cm. The diameter of the ring in section is 5 cm. This is a rather small and thick ring, in comparison to other kernoi of the same period. The ring has an opening, which had been attached to a part which is not preserved. (b) Ring Fragment (Fig. 40:b; PI. 40:4) Reg. No. 1818/3; Locus 172; Level 21.87 m; Stratum XII or XI This fragment was found 30 cm above Floor 180 of Stratum XII, at a spot where Strata XI-X floors were not preserved. It can tentatively be attributed to either Stratum XII or Stratum XI. Brown clay, white grits, medium fired, black core, thick white slip. The fragment is 9 cm long; the diameter of the ring section is 2.7 cm. The diameter of the complete vessel is not clear, but it seems to have been very large in comparison to other kernoi of this group. (c) Ring Fragment (Fig. 40:c; PI. 40:7) Reg. No. 2951; Locus 242; Level 21.55 m; Stratum XI This fragment was found on Floor 242, north of Temple 200. Brown clay, medium fired, black grits. The fragment is 1 1 cm long; the diameter of the ring is c. 15 cm, and that of the ring's section is 3 cm. The rim is decorated with six horizontal red lines and short black transversal lines. (d) Ring Fragment (Fig. 40:d; PI. 40:6) Reg. No. 2003; Locus 125; Level 21.30 m; Stratum XI Brown clay, medium fired, red slip and continuously hand burnished. The ring is elliptical in section and is decorated in black on top. The length of the fragment is 8.5 cm; it has an opening to a part which has not been preserved. (e) Ring Fragment and Miniature Vessel (Fig. 40:e; PI. 40:1-2) Fragment of ring: Reg. No. 1698; Locus 171; Level 22.79 m. Miniature vessel: Reg. No. 1802; Locus 168; Level 22.69 m Brown reddish clay, medium fired. The ring is decorated with horizontal red lines and short black perpendicular lines. The diameter of the ring is 16.3 cm; and it is 3.3 cm in diameter, in section. About 108</page><page sequence="114">LIBATION VESSELS Fig. 40. Ker noi. half of the ring has been preserved. It is exceptional in that a miniature vessel was connected to the inside of the ring rather than on top. A miniature vessel which could have fitted this ring (Pi. 40:2) was found in Room 168 of Building 225, which leads into Room 171, where the ring was found. The height of the vessel is 5.3 cm, and it has fragments of two miniature loop handles. This vessel was joined to its kernos ring on its side, a detail which fits the arrangement on the ring. Although the ring and the miniature vessel do not fit one another, the two could have been from the same vessel. Kernoi with vessel attached to the inner part of the ring are very rare. One example of the Late Bronze Age was found at Hazor and another example, of the Iron Age II, was found at Beersheba.44 (f) Ring Fragment (Fig. 40:f; PI. 40:3) Reg. No. 1472; Locus 171; Level 22.68 m; Stratum X Brown clay, medium fired, greyish-white slip on the outer face of the ring. Red net pattern. A fragment of the ring, 6 cm long, was preserved; its diameter is c. 11 cm. The diameter of the section of the ring is 2.2 cm. The two last examples were found in Building 225, south of Temple 131. Discussion 45 Rare examples of kernoi appear already in the 3rd millennium B.C., both in Palestine and in Cyprus.46 Isolated examples from the Middle Bronze Age, again found in both Palestine and Cyprus,47 connect these early examples with the Late Bronze Age kernoi . In this latter period kernoi were still very rare. In Palestine* all the known examples are from 13th century B.C. contexts (two ring fragments from Hazor and a fragmentary ring with carinated miniature bowl from Beth-Shan).48 In Cyprus, several kernoi in a local Base Ring I- II technique are known.49 Similar kernoi were found at Troy in a pre-Stratum VI context.50 In Mycenaean pottery such kernoi are very rare. Only one example is known from Greece proper (Mycenaean IIIA-B),51 and two others were found in Cyprus and were probably of local manufacture.52 One of them is decorated with pomegranate-shaped miniature vessels, recalling Iron Age I kernoi in Israel. The well-known example in the Boston Museum,53 the only one in the Mycenaean UIC technique, is very close in shape to the Cypriote kernoi of the 11th century B.C. Its assumed provenance is either Cyprus or Rhodes. In Crete, kernoi (or "ring vessels") of our type are rare. One example, of the Late Minoan III period, is decorated with cups and human figures.54 Further 109</page><page sequence="115">CHAPTER THIRTEEN isolated examples from the Late Bronze Age are known in Egypt55 and Ugarit.56 It can be concluded that, during the Late Bronze Age, the kernos was a known cult object in various cultures, although it was not of wide distribution. Its appearance in the Mycenaean repertoire may be a result of Cypriote influence on the Mycenaean culture, and not vice versa (see below). TABLE 16. IRON AGE I KERNOI FROM PALESTINE.

Elaborate examples are known from Megiddo, Sasa (Upper Galilee) and Gezer. These are larger than usual and are decorated with miniature, pomegranate-shaped vessels, figures of birds drinking from open vessels and zoomorphic, bull-shaped spouts. The finds from the Land of Israel in this period are summarized in Table 16, p. 110. The pomegranate-shaped vessels, as we have seen, have predecessors in Late Bronze Age kernoi in Cyprus and Egypt (see notes 52, 55). However, other elements, such as the birds, the bell-shaped bowl on the kernos from Megiddo, and decorative motifs such as the checkerboard and the Maltese cross, may be related to the Philistine culture or that of other "Sea People". All of these kernoi were prob- ably made in the urban centers of the coast and plains of this country during the Iron Age I period. The kernos from Sasa, which is one of the most elab- orate examples, was probably brought to Israelite territory in the Upper Galilee through trade. In Cyprus all of the kernoi of the Late Cypriote III period, except one,77 were attributed to the last phase of this period, dated to 1 100-1050 B.C. Seven kernoi have been attributed to this period, one of them found on Floor II or III in the temple at Enkomi.78 Most of them have a basket handle, bull-shaped spout and additional miniature vessels. A bird and a snake appear in isolated examples. The closest parallel for this group is the slightly earlier Mycenaean UIC kernos at the Boston Museum; however, since kernoi are ƒ∑nown in Cyprus from the 3rd millennium B.C., whereas they do not appear in the Aegean world until the Mycenaean IIIA-B period, it seems more likely that the type was introduced into the Mycenaean repertoire through Cyprus.79 The popularity which this vessel-type gained during the 12th- 11th centuries B.C., both in Cyprus and on the coast and plains of Israel, is an important factor in the web of cultural relations between these two regions, related to the settlement of the "Sea Peoples" in the Levant. During the Iron Age II, kernoi became rare in Israel80 but they retained their popularity at Ashdod, where cultural elements characteristic of the Philistines were maintained until the 8th century B.C.81 A parallel development can be traced in Cyprus, where the number of kernoi declines during the Cypro-Geometric period. Only few examples are known from the Cypro-Geometric I- II period,82 one of which has pomegranate-shaped vessels. These kernoi should probably be dated to the end of 1 1th century or to the beginning of the 10th century B.C. Thus, they would be contemporaneous with the similarly-shaped kernos from Megiddo, and they may thus also reflect the cultural relations between Cyprus and Palestine in this period. Several kernoi from Cyprus were made in the Black-on-Red I (III) technique.83 Since the date of this group is debatable, it is not impossible that they should be dated to the 10th century B.C. (see chronological discussion in Part Two). The appearance of the kernos in the Black-on-Red group illustrates its acceptance by the Phoenicians who, later in the Iron Age, brought the shape to their western colonies.84 The Pheonicians were probably also responsible for the transmission of the type to Greece, where it was locally manufactured during the 7th century B.C.85 ZOOMORPHIC SPOUTS Four zoomorphic spouts found in Area C may have been parts of kernoi , bowls with tubular rim or zoomorphic vessels. (a) Mountain-Goat's Head (Fig. 41:a; PL 38:3) Reg. No. 2947; Locus 227; Level 21.33 m; Stratum XI (Temple 200) Brown clay, medium fired, remains of red decoration on nose. Length of head, 5.5 cm. The spout is modelled in the form of an animal head with long, backward-sweeping horns like those of a mountain goat. The horns were made separately and joined to the head. The eyes were made of two clay lumps; the nostrils are emphasized by two pierced holes, and the ears were made of two separate pieces of clay. (b) Bull's (?) Head (Fig. 41 :b; PL 38:5) Reg. No. 3483; Locus 300; Level 20.57 m; Strata XI-X Brown clay, medium fired, remains of red decoration on the neck. Length of spout, 6.7 cm. The horns and ears are broken off. A pair of miniature clay horns was found in the same locus (Reg. No. 3446), but it is not clear whether they are part of this spout. The eyes and nostrils are shaped similarly to those of spout (a). (c) Horned Animal's Head (Fig. 41:c; PL 38:5) Reg. No. 2606; Locus 210; Level 21.14 m; Stratum XII 111</page><page sequence="117">CHAPTER THIRTEEN Fig. 41. Zoomorphic spouts. Brown clay, black core, medium fired; length of spout, 9 cm. The horns and ears have not been preserved, but traces of their joint are visible. The eyes were made of two protruding clay lumps and the eyeballs were emphasized by two pierced holes. A unique feature in this spout is the protruding lump of clay at the top of the neck, below the mouth. This might be interpreted as the beard of a billy-goat. (d) Horned Animal's Head (Fig. 41 :d; PL 38:6) Reg. No. 2183; Locus 196; Level 22.59 m; Stratum VIII Brown-grey clay, medium fired; length of head, 4 cm. The horns have not been preserved. The eyes are made of small lumps of clay. The spout opening is narrow and small in comparison to the previous examples. Discussion Only a few examples of zoomorphic spouts are known from Late Bronze Age contexts. In addition to the bowls with a tubular rim (see above, p. 106), few such spouts are known from Megiddo.86 They also appear on the Cypriote and Mycenaean kernoi mentioned above (p. 111). In the Iron Age I, when the popularity of kernoi and bowls with a tubular rim was at its peak, the number of such spouts increases. Besides the spouts found attached to kernoi and bowls with tubular rims (see above), we should also mention zoomorphic vessels with such spouts from Megiddo Stratum VI87 and several isolated, broken spouts found at Megiddo VI, Gezer, Ashdod, Tell Beit Mirsim and Tel Sippor.88 All these spouts depict horned animals, probably bulls, in a characteristic standard style. The forehead is always in the form of a cylindrical spout narrowing at the front, with eyes made of lumps of clay and sometimes with a painted decoration on the head. The four spouts from Jell Qasile conform to this style. However, two of them, (a) and (c), are unique in their depicting a mountain goat and a billy-goat (?) respectively. Spout (d) from Stratum VIII (10th century B.C.) is similar to kernoi spouts from Ashdod, where such kernoi retained their popularity until the 8th century B.C.89 Other zoomorphic spouts of the Iron Age II are known at various sites in Israel, many of them probably parts of zoomorphic vessels.90 Two examples from Megiddo, Stratum IV have mountain-goat horns similar to those on spout (a) from Tell Qasile. 112</page><page sequence="118">CHAPTER FOURTEEN VARIOUS CULT OBJECTS CLAY FIGURINES Several fragmentary clay figurines were found in the various strata in Area C. Three were found in the Iron Age I strata and two should probably be dated to "Stratum VII" (7th century B.C.). (a) Head of a Horned Animal (Fig. 42:a; PI. 39:2) Reg. No. 1366/1; Locus 134; Level 22.10 m; Stratum X (Temple 131) Brown clay, black core, medium fired. The height of the fragment is 4 cm. The ears and eyes were made of separate lumps of clay. The exceptionally large ears were attached to a pair of horns, which are not preserved. The neck is long and narrow. The fragment is part of a larger cult vessel, the full form of which is not known. There is some similarity to a figurine from Gezer, Strata XIII-XII decorated with painted geometric designs.1 (b) Bird's Head (Fig. 42:b; PI. 39:6) Reg. No. 3067; Locus 227; Level 21.36 m; Stratum XI (Temple 200) Brown clay, medium fired, decorated with black lines on the neck and head. The eyes were made of clay lumps, decorated in red. The length of the figurine is 4 cm. A similar bird-head was found in Area A at Tell Qasile, below the floor of Room L8, and was attributed to Strata XII-XI (Reg. No. QII 4612). Both may have been parts of cult bowls of the type discussed above (Chapter 12). (c) Fragment of a Leg (Fig. 42:c, PI. 39:4) Reg. No. 3461; Locus 286; Level 21.66 m; Strata XI-X Brown clay. This is a fragment of a figurine, a leg with flat foot and toes delineated by incisions. The height of the fragment is 4 cm. The full form of this figurine is not clear. Two similar fragments were found at Hazor, one in Area F (Middle or Late Bronze Age) and the other in Stratum VI (8th Century B.C.).2 (d) Human "Bird-shaped" Head (Fig. 42:d; PL 39:5) Reg. No. 1386; Locus 138; Level 22.20 m; "Stratum VII" (?) Brown-reddish clay, black and brown grits, medium fired. This stylized head was made by pinching a lump of clay between the fingers. Such stylized figurines are well known among the clay Fig. 42. Clay figurines. 113</page><page sequence="119">CHAPTER FOURTEEN figurines of the Iron Age II in Judea and on the coastal sites.3 Our figurine was not found in a clear, stratified context, but should be attributed to "Stratum VII" (7th century B.C.). (e) Animal's Head (Fig. 42 :e) Reg. No. 2718; Locus 228; Level 22.70 m; "Stratum VII" (?) Brown-reddish clay, medium fired, grey core. The head is long, with large, pointed ears. It depicts either a dog or a horse. It has several parallels in Judea and coastal sites.4 This head, too, was not found in a stratified context, but should also be attributed to "Stratum VII" (7th century B.C.). A "pillar figurine", found during the first season in Area A at Tell Qasile, should be attributed to this same period.5 Thus, the collection of figurines from Tell Qasile is relatively small. The few examples from Strata XII- VIII are all part of larger cult vessels and no individual figurines have been found in these strata. The three fragmentary figurines which we have attributed to the 7th century B.C. are similar in style to the Judean figurines of this period. FIGURATIVE POTTERY FRAGMENTS This section deals with three fragments of cult vessels. (a) Figure of a Horse and Rider (?) (Fig. 43; PL * 39:1) Reg. No. 2180; Locus 111; Level 22.20 m; Stratum X Brown clay, medium fired, black core, traces of white slip and red decoration. Length, 13 cm; height, Fig. 43. A figure of a horse (1:5). 11.5 cm. This horse-shaped object has a hollowed body, but the head is not pierced. The hind part widens and was originally joined to a larger cult vessel. There is an impression on the back of the animal, indicating the original presence of a rider. The horse's head is plain, there being little note of facial details. The eyes were indicated by two flat lumps of clay. Above the left eye is the beginning of an ear which has not been preserved. The modelled fore-legs are also only partly preserved, while the hind legs were not depicted. We may, therefore, conclude that this object depicted a rider on a horse and formed part of a larger cult vessel, the complete shape of which cannot be determined. Various artistic depictions of horse-riders are known from the second millennium B.C.6 Though this motif is not very common, and the use of the horse for riding was rather limited until the end of the second millennium, we do possess representations of Egyptians, Syrians and Hittites riding horses. There are no parallels to representations of riders on cult objects, but clay figurines showing riders are known in the Mycenaean culture, while a vessel from Cyprus, dated to the Middle Cypriote period, has two handles shaped as horse-riders.6a (b) Moulded Face on a Pottery Fragment (Fig. 44; PL 39:3) Reg. No. 2028; Locus 188; Level 22.00 m; Stratum X (Temple 131) Brown clay, medium fired. This is a fragment of a large vessel, probably a storage-jar, decorated with Fig. 44. Modelled face on pottery fragment (2:5). 114</page><page sequence="120">VARIOUS CULT OBJECTS horizontal stripes. The fragment includes a handle join, below which two eyes and a nose were plastically rendered. On the left side of the sherd there is a ridge ending in a small groove, which may be taken as part of a hand. In two instances, both of the Iron Age I, human faces appear below handle joins: one from Bethel and the other from Afula.7 The three examples indicate a common artistic practice in this period. A stylistic parallel to our face may be found in a fragment from Lachish, probably to be dated to the 10th century B.C.8 The two fragments from Tell Qasile and Lachish somewhat recall the faces of the "Ashdoda" figurines found in the Philistine strata at Ashdod,9 although the similarity may be coincidental. (c) " Conch-shaped " Cult Vessel (Fig. 45; PI. 36:3) Reg. No. 2219/3; Locus 125; Level 20.00-22.00 m; Stratum XI Brown clay, medium fired. Only a large body fragment of this unique vessel has been preserved. The body narrows towards the base, and it probably had a trumpet-base. However, the complete shape is not clear. The vessel's walls, when leather- Fig. 45. A "conch-shaped" vessel (2:5). 115</page><page sequence="121">CHAPTER FOURTEEN hard, were modelled into a series of wavy vertical ridges. Each ridge bears a painted "herring-bone" motive of alternating rows of black or red painted lines, divided by a vertical black line. Although the "herring-bone" motif appears on Philistine pottery, it is very rare as a central, vertical motif.10 A similar decoration appears on a strainer-jug from Stratum XI at Tell Qasile which has a similarly modelled body, though the ridges are horizontal and of equal width. POMEGRANATE-SHAPED VESSELS Two pomegranate-shaped pottery vessels were discovered in Temple 131 of Stratum X. (a) (Fig. 46:a; PL 38:2) Reg. No. 1377; Locus 134; Level 22.09 m Light brown clay, medium fired, height 10.7 cm. This vessel was whe√ßl-made and when leather-hard, was pressed square, leaving a concave depression on each side. It has a shallow ring base, and a narrow high neck, the rim of which was cut as a zigzag with nine points. Two small holes were pierced in the neck, to enable the vessel to be hung on a string. The vessel has a reddish-purple slip and the shoulder and neck are decorated with three pairs of horizontal black lines, with a white line dividing each pair. (b) (Fig. 46:b; PI. 38:1) Reg. No. 2082; Locus 188; Level 21.90 m Light brown clay, height 9.5 cm. The vessel is identical to (a), but is decorated with black lines only. Pomegranate-shaped vessels made of silver, alabaster, glass and pottery are known in Egypt during the New Kingdom.11 Glass and faience vessels in this shape have been found in Cyprus, in both Late Cypriote II (14th- 13th centuries B.C.) and the Late Cypriote III (12th- 11th centuries B.C.).12 Two pomegranate-shaped vessels were recently found at Tel Shera, dated to the end of the Late Bronze Age or the beginning of the Iron Age.13 They have a red slip and holes for suspension, in special protrusions on the base of the vessel; thus they could be hung upside-down, in a naturalistic fashion. A vessel from Ashdod, Stratum XI (1 1th century B.C.) has a red slip and is more naturalistic in form than those from Tell Qasile, but it lacks suspension holes.14 As seen above (p. 1 1 1), pomegranate-shaped vessels decorate Iron Age I kernoi from Gezer, Megiddo and Sasa, a practice which has precedents in Late Bronze Age finds from Egypt and Cyprus, and continues on a 10th century B.C. kernos from Cyprus. A pomegranate shaped vessel was attached to the inner side of a cult bowl dated to the 9th-8th centuries B.C., recently discovered at Tel Lahav.15 It is the only vessel of this type from the Iron Age II period, prior to the reappearance of pomegranate vessels among the Assyrian pottery of the 8th-7th centuries B.C.16 However, there is no known direct connection between these two groups of vessels, and we can only assume that the concept was transferred to the Assyrians through the Phoenician or Aramaean cultures. The pomegranate motif17 appears as a decoration on Canaanite metal vessels and moulds found at Ugarit,18 and in Egyptian depictions of elaborate Canaanite vessels.19 Pomegranates appear at the tips of Canaanite ivory rods,20 and pomegranate-shaped pendants have been found in Stratum VIA at Megiddo, contemporaneous with Stratum X at Tell Qasile.21 The pomegranate motif had an important role in the decoration of Solomon's Temple (I Kings 7:18-20; II Kings 25:17; Jeremiah 52:23; II Chronicles 4:1 3).22 Pomegranates which decorated the chains in the holy-of holies (II Chronicles 3:16) were probably suspended like the vessels from our temple. The tradition of pomegranate-shaped vessels begins, therefore, in Egyptian and Canaanite cultures Fig. 46. Pomegranate-shaped vessels (2:5). 116</page><page sequence="122">Fig. 47. Votive vessels (2:5). of the Late Bronze Age and continues in the Philistine, Phoenician, Israelite and Assyrian cultures. VOTIVE VESSELS (a) Group of Miniature Vessels (Fig. 47; PI. 39:7-1 1) This group of seven miniature vessels was found in Locus 170, at the eastern end of the excavated area. Here, erosion destroyed most of the ancient remains and only a layer of brown earth, 0.50 m thick, was found above bedrock. No floor or any other stratigraphical element could be defined in this layer. At the lower levels, above bedrock, some Middle Bronze Age II pottery was found, while at the upper part of the layer most of the pottery was of the Iron Age I. The miniature vessels were found in the upper part of the layer and therefore we have concluded that they are survivors of a ruined Iron Age I favissa , related to the Philistine temples. The vessels are wheel-made; the bases are unworked and show signs of being string cut. The ware is coarse, with a grey core, and the vessels are undecorated. They are in various shapes: (a) is a straight-sided bowl (diameter 5.5 cm); (b) is a carinated bowl; (c) is a jug (height 4.5 cm); (d) is a fragmentary jug; (e) is a two handled storage-jar (height 4.3 cm); (0 is a cup (height 2.8 cm). The most interesting of them is (g) (PL 39:7); it is made as a bowl (5.5 cm in diameter) with six small cups arranged in a circle around a central, similar cup. Only four of these miniature cups have been preserved, and of the other three, only the impressions remain. This vessel continues a long tradition of similar but larger vessels, known during the Middle Bronze Age at Nahariya, Megiddo and Beth Shemesh,23 and continue at Ugarit during the Late Bronze Age.24 Our vessel is smaller and thinner than the Middle Bronze Age examples. The fact that Middle Bronze Age sherds were found in the same locus, yet at a lower level, raises the possibility that our vessel should also be attributed to the Middle Bronze Age. However, we believe it is of the Iron Age I, like the rest of the pottery found at the same level. If this dating is correct, our vessel would be the only example of its kind from this period. (b) Small Votive Bowls (for drawings, see Part Two). The temples of Strata XII-X contained groups of small, undecorated bowls averaging less than 10 cm in diameter, usually with an unworked, string-cut base. They can be divided into the following types: (i) Bowls with rounded walls and flat base; (ii) Bowls with rounded walls and rounded base; (iii) Bowls with rounded walls and high base; (iv) Bowls with rounded walls and ring base; (v) Carinated bowls with ring base or flat base. The distribution of these types in the various strata is shown in the following table: Type Type Type Type Type Total I II III IV V Found Stratum XII, Temple 319 1 3 4 Stratum XI, Temple 200 18 3 3 3 6 33 Stratum XI, Pit 125 1 3 4 Stratum X, Temple 131 2 6 8 117</page><page sequence="123">CHAPTER FOURTEEN Two additional miniature bowls with a red slip were found in Pit 125. These small bowls probably served for minor offerings in the cult practices. Bowls of similar size, also of rough workmanship and with a string-cut base, are known at various sites in the Middle and Late Bronze Ages.25 Like our bowls, they are made as miniature imitations of ordinary contemporaneous bowls. POTTERY VESSELS OF UNIQUE FORM Among the hundreds of pottery vessels found in the various temples, some were of unique shape, probably made especially for the cult practices. A full discussion and description of these vessels will ap- pear in Part Two, in the discussion of the pottery by typological series. Here we shall only list these unique vessels: Stratum XII: A "pyxis-flask" decorated in Philistine style, found on the floor of Temple 319.26 Stratum XI: A horn-shaped vessel decorated in Philistine style, from Pit 125; a bottle with rounded base and suspension holes, recalling those of the pomegranate-shaped vessels; a fragmentary vessel with three legs; hand-made bowls and cups with impressed decoration. Most of these vessels were found in Pit 125. Stratum X: Two composite flasks decorated in Phoenician style;27 a strainer-jug with wide mouth and square stirrup handle; fragments of chalices and goblets decorated with lotus patterns. The rather large number of stirrup-jars, small flasks, hemispherical goblets and medium-sized bowls found in the various loci in the temples is evidence of the important role of these vessel types in the cult practices. Most of the bowls in Temple 131, of Stratum X, were found arranged in groups of two or three, laid upside-down, one on the other, on the floor of the temple (PI. 12:1-3). The practice of placing bowls upside-down in sacred places finds parallels at Hazor (the temple at Area H, Late Bronze Age II), at Ashdod Stratum XIII (early 12th century B.C.), at Knossos in Crete and Enkomi in Cyprus.28 CONCH USED FOR TRUMPETING (PI. 40:9) Among the cult objects found in Locus 227 in Temple 200 (Stratum XI) was a conch of the genus Charonia tritonis seguenza , known as Triton, or Trumpet shell.29 It is 19.5 cm. long, its top was cut away, enabling its use as a trumpet (it still works to- day). A large fragment of a similar conch (14 cm. long) was found in the courtyard of Stratum XII (Locus 275). These shells are found in the Mediterra- nean and, though fairly rare, are still used by fisher- men and herdsmen as trumpets. The practice of using them as trumpets is well attested in the Aegean, where a number of examples are known from Minoan sites like Mallia, Knossos, Phaistos, Kommos and elsewhere. At least in two cases - at the Palace Chapel at Phaistos and at Hogarth's house at Knossos - the triton shells were found in a cultic context. Clay and stone models of such shells, known in the Minoan culture, emphasize their importance in the Minoan and Mycenaean cult practices.30 The conch may have been used for trumpeting during cult ceremonies in the temple.31 In Israel, similar conchs are a rare find. One example was found in the Iron II strata at Hazor.32 Thus, the two conchs found at the sanctuary at Tell Qasile may reflect an Aegean religious practice. 118</page><page sequence="124">CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE CULT OBJECTS: SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The rich collection of cult objects from Tell Qasile includes almost all of the types of pottery cult objects known to us from Israel besides types previously unknown. Only the square, house-shaped ritual stands, and the "wall brackets", known from other sites at the end of the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age I, are not represented at Tell Qasile.1 Various cultural traditions can be identified through systematic analysis of the finds. On this basis, the cult objects may be divided into the following groups: (1) Objects reflecting local Canaanite tradition (the anthropomorphic mask; the cylindrical cult stands; the votive vessels; kernoi and bowls with tubular rim). The latter two types, though appearing in the Late Bronze Age Canaanite culture in isolated examples, gained popularity in Cyprus and Palestine during the Iron Age I. (2) Objects showing Egyptian tradition. This tradition may have been passed down through the Canaanite-Phoenician culture (the "naos"; the pomegranate-shaped vessels; the bird-shaped cult bowls.) (3) Vessels characterizing the "Sea Peoples" culture and having direct or indirect origins in the Aegean sphere (the lion-shaped rhyton and possibly also the female anthropomorphic vessel). (4) Objects unique to Tell Qasile (the female anthropomorphic vessel; the anthropomorphic jug- let; zoomorphic masks; the large cult jar with five openings; the composite libation vessel; the animal- shaped "trick vase"; the figure of the rider on the horse; the conch-shaped vessel and clay figurines [al- le]). It should be emphasized that the typical Philistine figurines of the "Ashdoda" and "mourning woman" types2 have not been discovered at Tell Qasile. The "Ashdoda" figurines characterize Ashdod, while the "mourning women" have been found on sites south of the Yarkon river (Tell Jerisheh and Azor), as well as at Tell Eitun in the inner Shephefah. This latter type was found only in relation to burials, and thus its lack in Tell Qasile is not surprising. However, the "Ashdoda" type was found in Philistine occupation layers in Ashdod, and was certainly a most important cult object in the local Philistine cult there. Its total lack at Tell Qasile calls for explanation. Since the "Ashdoda" figurines retain a clear Mycenaean tradition, we may assume that at this Philistine metropolis the Aegean strand was stronger, and Mycenaean iconography was retained during the 12th- 1 1th centuries B.C. Tell Qasile was a peripheral Philistine site. We may assume that the local population was mixed, containing both Philistines or other "Sea Peoples",3 who probably were the ruling class, as well as a local population of Canaanite origin. In any event, the lack of "Ashdoda" figurines on our site shows that true Aegean traditions were not strong here, in contrast to the situation at Ashdod. Local Canaanite traditions, as well as much original creative imagination, not connected with any tradition, characterize both the architecture and the cult objects from Tell Qasile. Special emphasis should be put on the connections between cult objects from Tell Qasile and similar objects found in Cyprus. Masks and kernoi were most common in Cyprus during the Late Cypriote III period, while bowls with tubular rim, askoi decorated with birds' heads and wings, "trick vases" and composite flasks appear in Cyprus from the beginnings of the C y pro-Geometric I period. These related forms, as well as the similarity in the temple architecture at Kition and at Tell Qasile (see above, p. 67), are important indications of the relations between the culture of the "Sea Peoples" who settled in Palestine and the Cypriote culture of the 12th- 1 1th centuries B.C. Most of the cult objects may be divided into two classes, according to function: the first class is vessels used in ritual meals; it includes the cylindrical cult stands which held cult bowls. The second class is libation vessels; these include the objects mentioned 119</page><page sequence="125">CHAPTER FIFTEEN TABLE 17.

Other cult vessels had specialized functions. The "naos" with two figures of goddesses (or a god and a goddess), which may have been closed with doors, was probably of special importance and may have served as an "icon " in the temple. A similar significant role may have been played by the female anthropomorphic vessel which may have represented a fertility goddess (though it could have been used as a libation vessel as well). We have already noted the possibility that the cult jar with five openings at the top may have been used for sacred plants, a practice known at temples in the ancient Near East. The various masks were probably used by priests in the ritual performed in the temple, while the conch was used as a trumpet in the ritual ceremonies. The picture is in no way complete, since we may assume that much of the temple equipment has disappeared - precious metals were probably taken away before the last temple was burnt, when leather, wood and textiles all disintegrated. The few remains of woven cloth found in Temple 200 of Stratum XI, painted blue and red, are a hint of what we did not find. Yet the extant architectural remains and the cult objects, as well as some special finds and the rich collection of pottery vessels (to be published in Part Two), are evidence of a vivid and most original culture which flourished in Tell Qasile during the 12th- 1 1th centuries B.C. 121</page><page sequence="127">NOTES CHAPTER ONE 1. On the name of the site, B. Mazar writes (/ EJ , 1, p. 62, n. 3): "On the maps of the Palestine Exploration Fund (about 1875), the tell is marked as Ruins with no name to it, whereas in the maps of the Survey of Palestine it is called Al-Qasila or Al-Khirba, and on some maps both these names are entered; cf. Survey of Palestine, Topocadastral Map 1:20,000, sheet 13-16, Nov. 1944. On the strength of finding the name Al-Qasile on the map we decided to call our site Tell Qas√Æle, hoping, however, that in the course of time the historical name of the ancient settlement may be revealed." 2.

Excavation methods on mounds in Israel have recently been a controversial subject among scholars, especially those belonging to the "school" of the late Prof. G.E. Wright and among Israeli scholars. See Y. Aharoni, Eretz-Israel, 1 1 (1973), pp. 48-53 (Hebrew); W.G. Dever, Eretz-Israel, 1 1 (1973), pp. l*-8*. The method used by the excavators at Gezer was recently expounded in detail by W.G. Dever and H.D. Lance, A Manual of Field Excavation: Handbook for Field Archaeologists, Cincinnati 1978. In the recent seasons of excavations at Tell Qasile, we followed the method employed by many Israeli archaeologists, according to which a grid of 5 X 5 m. squares with baulks between is the basis for commencing excavations, the baulks being employed in the study of the stratification of the debris as much as possible. This method is expounded, e.g., by M. Wheeler and Kathleen Kenyon in: M. Wheeler, Archaeology from the Earth , Harmondsworth 1955; K. Kenyon, Beginning in Archaeology, 1964, pp. 68-1 14. However, we believe that areas should be extended to a size that would enable the exposure of as much as possible of complete architectural units. Within a building, excavations should not penetrate into a lower stratum until the whole building, if possible, is exposed (after registration of the baulks and their removal). This enables the complete study of a particular building. In order to study the development and history of a building, its walls should not be removed even after recording, until excavation proceeds into the lower stratum. CHAPTER TWO 1.

The term cella is used in this work to define the main space of the temple, where the cult ceremonies were carried out; see D.S. Robertson, A Handbook of Greek and Roman Architecture , Cambridge 1954, p. 39. This space is analogous to the heikhal in the Temple of Solomon. The term "holy-of-holies" is parallel to the biblical debir. When the latter is in a separate architectural unit it can be paralleled to the adyton of the Greek temples. In various publications there is confusion in the use of both the Greek and the Hebrew terms. 2. The difficulty in understanding this stone is connected with the manner in which it is laid upon the first course of bricks of Wall 557, and with the fact that it is 40 cm above the floor of the temple. During the excavations it was thought that it might originally have served as an offering table situated opposite the raised platform, similar to the arrangement in the temple of Area C at Hazor (see: Hazor I, Pl. CLXXXI). It was suggested that the stone was not in situ and that it originally lay on the floor of the temple. Another suggestion was that it served as a threshold, with a certain cultic significance (compare the threshold in the temple of Dagon at Ashdod, I Samuel 5:45). If the stone is not in situ, it could also have served in its present position as a base for a wooden pillar standing at the center of Temple 200 of Stratum XI (see below, Chapter Four, note 2). We would prefer explaining the stone as the threshold of Temple 319; its height above the floor can be explained by the slope of the bedrock from east to west, which caused the floors of the courtyard east of the temple to be on a higher level than that of the temple itself. The threshold served, in this case, as a step leading from the courtyard to the temple. 3. We prefer the term "raised platform to "altar which is used in various publications (see below, chapter 9, note 43). 4. See: 'Ain Shems IV, PI 1:1; V, p. 60; Beth Pelet II, Pl. LXVIII-.15. At Tel Shera and Aphek similar layers of ash, dated to the Iron Age I, cover extensive areas; they are up to 1 m in thickness. Similar layers were found in the Philistine strata in Area VI at Gezer, where the excavators explained them as remains of threshing floors; see W.G. Dever et al., BA, 34 (1971), p. 129. This hardly seems likely, since threshing is usually done on open rock surfaces, and there would be no reason for an accumulation of ash and burnt layers in such an area. In all these sites, the accumulation of grey and black ash probably characterizes open areas where rubbish was dumped over the years. The rubbish was burned from time to time, resulting in the black ash material, while the light grey ash represents the disintegration of organic material. 5. IEJ, 25 (1975), PI. 7:b. CHAPTER FOUR 1 . The measuring of the structure was somewhat problematic since the western wall tends slightly to the east while the southern wall tends to the north. Measurements were made at floor level. 2. During excavations, it was suggested that the large stone slab integrated into the eastern wall of Temple 319 of Stratum XII (see above. Chapter Three, note 2) served as a base for awooden pillar in Temple 200 of Stratum XI. The floor of Temple 200 was found covering only the southern and western part of this stone, while it could not be traced above its northern part. It is therefore possible that a single stone pillar was erected in the center of Temple 200. However, as mentioned above, we would prefer to regard the stone as the threshold of Temple 319. 3. During excavations, it was difficult to decide whether Floor 244 was the original floor of Room 204 or not. When it was observed that the stone walls of the room were founded on this floor, it was concluded that it must be earlier than the room itself. 4. In the preliminary reports the small temple was described as comprising only one room. However, Space 229 should be considered part of the complex of this small temple. CHAPTER FIVE 1. The wood remains were identified by Dr. Nili Liphschitz from the Institute of Archaeology, Tel-Aviv University. 2. The sand layers were examined by Y. Yitzhaki, geologist of the Institute of Archaeology in the Tel-Aviv University, who agreed with our view that they resulted from an accumulation of sand in an open area over a period of several years. 3. For an example of a row of discs depicted in a Mycenaean wall painting with cultic connotations, see: W. Taylor, Antiquity, 43 (1969), p. 97, Pl. X. Taylor explains the motif as follows: ". . . this familiar pattern is generally taken to represent the ends of beams and to stand for a building." CHAPTER EIGHT 1. Y. Aharoni, The Land of the Bible, Historical Geography, London 1967, p. 349. It should be noted, however, that the main proof for the assumption that Josiah ruled the coastal plain is the Hebrew letter found at Mesad Hashaviahu. There is no other direct source for such an extension of Judah, and thus it remains an assumption only. CHAPTER NINE 1. Dothan (1967), p. 247; B.

Seton-Williams, "Palestinian Temples", Iraq II (1949), pp. 77-89. An important paper in this field is G.R.H. Wright, "Pre- Israelite Temples in the Land of Canaan", PEQ , 103 124</page><page sequence="129">NOTES TO CHAPTER NINE (1971), pp. 17-32. Wright's solutions, however, are not always constant and in certain cases specific buildings have not been understood correctly. For example, the temples of Stratum XIX at Megiddo and the "Palace" at Ai are presented as buildings with indirect entrances, leading Wright to conclude that there were no broad-room temples in Israel. See also S. Yeivin, "Mycenaean Temples and Their Possible Influence on the Countries of the Eastern Littoral of the Mediterranean", Atti e Memorie del 1 Congresso Internazionale di Micenologia, 1967, Roma 1968, pp. 1130-1148. Here, Yeivin sought a typological division of the temples in Israel in three main types: 1. square temples; 2. broad buildings; 3. tower temples. This division is basically correct, although the first group encompasses temples totally different from one another, such as the Fosse Temples at Lachish, the temples of Beth- Shan, the "temple" on Mt. Gerizim, and others. An important attempt to classify the temples of the Levant was made recently by A. Kuschke, see: s.v. "Temple", in: BRL 2, pp. 333-342, with extensive bibliography and uniform scale plans. (The present chapter was written before the publication of the last work.) 3. This large group of temples consists of variegated buildings. In the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Ages, the group includes the temples of En-Gedi, Megiddo (Strata XIX, XVII-XV) and Ai ("Palais"). All are "broad buildings". See summary and bibliography in A. Ben-Tor, "Plans of Dwellings and Temples in Early Bronze Age Palestine", Eretz-Israel, 1 1 (1973), pp. 92-98 (Hebrew); I. Dunayevsky and A. Kempinski, "The Megiddo Temples", ZDPV, 89 (1973), pp. 161-187. In the Middle and Late Bronze Ages the group includes temples with a broad cella, as well as temples with a long cella. The first sub-group includes the temples of Area H at Hazor, the temples of Dagan and Ba'al at Ugarit, the temples of Strata VII, IV, II- I at Alalakh, and the temple at Carchemesh (Late Bronze or Early Iron Age). See: Yadin (1972), pp. 75-95; C.F.A. Schaeffer, Syria , 12 (1931), p. 9, fig. 2; 14(1933), p. 122, fig. 14; 16(1935), pp. 154-156, pl. XXXVI; Alalakh , pp. 43-89; Naumann (1971), pp. 154-156; L. Woolley, Carchemish III, London 1952, pp. 167-171, pl. 29; Naumann (1971), p. 470. The second sub-group (temples with a long cella) probably originated in the Upper Euphrates region. The earliest examples are the temples of Tell Chuera (Akkadian period), then come the Middle Bronze Age temples at Tell Mardikh, Mari, Shechem, Meggido and Tel Kitan, and the Late Bronze Age temples at Tell Mumbakat, Tell Meskene, Hazor (Area A), and probably also Tell Abu Hawam (Building 50).

In this article, in which Aharoni points out the relations between the temple of Arad and the temple of Timna, he raised the idea that the original mishkan was a broad structure and that it is only the literary tradition of the Bible concerning the Temple of Solomon which has led to its being described as a long structure.

In principle, Giveon accepts the connection between the temples of Beth-Shan and those of el-Amarna, but claims that it is indirect; according to him, the Amama chapels regarded by Rowe as parallels to those at Beth-Shan are themselves a foreign element in Egyptian architecture and were rather built under Asiatic influence in Egypt during the Amama period. For a different opinion, see D. Ussishkin, Tel Aviv, 5 (1978), pp. 24-25. 16. D. Ussishkin, "Excavations at Tel Lachish - 1973-1977", Tel Aviv, 5 (1978), pp. 10-25. 1 7.

Yeivin, VT, 14 (1968), p. 339, Fig. 4, assumed that the temple had a special antechamber, but this is baseless. He also suggested a connection between the 125</page><page sequence="130">NOTES TO CHAPTER NINE temples of Beth-Shan V and the architecture of Mycenaean temples. In his view, the southern temple represents the first appearance of a long-room in the temples of Israel, and thus the influence of the Mycenaean megaron. However, as seen above, long-rooms are characteristic of an entire group of Canaanite temples throughout the second millennium B.C. See Yeivin, op. cit. (above n. 2), p. 1137. 19.

East of the western wall of the building, a group of pottery and cult vessels was found (ibid., p. 47), part of which was placed above the western wall of Building 50, attributed to Stratum V. Among the vessels found on top of the wall of the early building was a bull-shaped Cypriote Base-Ring zoomorphic vessel. It seems that the group was placed there following the destruction of Building 50 and, if so, should be attributed to Building 30. Building 30 may have been no more than a re-building of Building 50, occurring within the Late Bronze Age. The square stone pillar, terminating above in a sort of square capital (ibid., pl. IX :2), may have been a stone altar, similar to those from Enkomi (see below, n. 36). 22. Enc. Arch. Ex., pp. 536-540. 23. Ashdod I, pp. 123-139; II, p. 21. 24. A.

It should be noted that in the central hall of a Philistine house in Stratum XII at Ashdod a pair of unworked stone pillar bases was found; see M. Dothan, Qadmoniot , 5 (1972), p. 7 (Hebrew), plan of Area H, building on the left. 33. See the bibliography in note 27 above. The best known example is the sanctuary at Cheos, which has no architectural relation to our temples. The Mycenaean shrine at Tiryns is built as a small megaron. See K. Kilian, AA (1978), pp. 460-470. Among the Minoan shrines assembled by S. Hood (above, note 27), there are three structures which show some similarities to two of our buildings, though these are by no means close similarities. No. 6 from Mallia (Late Minoan I- II [?!) is a partly subterranean room with a bent-axis entrance, which recalls our Shrine 300. No. 6, the shrine from Mallia, also recalls our Shrine 300 both in dimensions and in the inner installations. According to the excavators it was destroyed c. 1450 B.C., yet Hood assumes that it was reused until Late Minoan III. No. 3, a shrine in Ayia Triada, is a square room, 4.00 X 4.20 m, with one bench along the back room. It was founded in Late Minoan I and repaired in Late Minoan Illb. In plan it somewhat recalls our Temple 319. Though attention should be drawn to these similarities, the material is too scanty to draw conclusions as to a possible connection between these Minoan shrines and the Tell Qasile Philistine temples. 34.

In a letter to the author, dated 9 March 1976, V. Karageorghis writes: "It becomes more and more apparent that Tell Qasile is almost a replica of Kition in many respects." The "temple" at Tell el-Far'ah (N) has been excluded from our discussion, since its identification as such is obscure. 36. Alasia I, pp. 151-362, 505-564; plan: ibid., p. 153, Fig. 1; p. 154, Fig. 2. C. Courtois (ibid, pp. 359-362) compares the plan of this building with the Fosse Temple at Lachish. 37. For a summary and previous literature, see SCE IV/ƒºc, pp. 1-1 1. Two other buildings at Enkomi have been identified as temples, yet this interpretation is obscure: the "Ashlar Building" excavated by Dikaios (see Enkomi I, pp. 191-220; II, p. 524; III, Pis. 276-277) and the "tower" by the northern gate (see H.W. Catling, RDAC (1975), pp. 50-53). Another sanctuary of the Late Bronze Age was recently uncovered at Old Paphos. See BCH, 100 (1976), pp. 884-886; 101 (1977), pp. 759-761; F.G.

Alalakh, pp. 73-78, Fig. 32. According to Woolley, these temples (which differ from earlier and later temples at Alalakh) illustrate Hittite influence in the period of Stratum III. No temples similar to those of Alalakh III have as yet been found in the Hittite kingdom, although the view that the appearance of the temple with indirect entrance reflects foreign influence can be accepted. 43. The archaeological material relating to raised platforms in temples has been assembled by D. Conrad, Studien zum Altargesetz, Marburg 1968, pp. 58-84, in connection with the sacrificial altar described in Exodus 20:22-26. The platforms are termed here "Stufenaltar", "step altars". These parallels, and the accompanying discussion, do not seem to be relevant to the subject of sacrificial altars, as all of them served as stands for the statue of the god. A similar fault also exists in the excavation report of the Fosse Temples at Lachish; see Lachish II, pp. 38-43, Pl. LXXI. Concerning the platform in Temple III, the excavators mention the verses in Exodus 20:24-26; but these verses deal with the sacrificial altar outside of the temple. 44. L.

Two pillar bases were found, probably not in situ , near the outer face of the wall of the Stratum VII palace. They have a square base below and a conical drum at the top. It is not clear where these pillars were originally placed. In the Minoan culture: Knossos I, pp. 370-371, Fig. 268. According to Evans, such pillars were more common in Middle Minoan I- II. 51. The two rows of pillars at Shechem were apparently contemporaneous with the founding of the temple. Compare with the row of nine pillar bases found in the "palace" (?) at Shechem, south of the northwestern gate: E. Sellin, ZDPV , 49 (1926), Tafel 33, 36. 52. The portico with the two pillars was apparently added to the "Tower Temple" at Megiddo in the Late Bronze Age; see I. Dunayevsky and A. Kempinski, ZDPV , 89 (1973), pp. 180-184. 53. See Parrot, note 3 above. This temple should be attributed to the group of "Tower Temples". The cella here is the main long hall rather than the two square back rooms, which were defined as the cella by Lenzen (above, note 40, pp. 31-32). 54. J. Margueron, op. cit. (above, note 3). 55. Lachish II, p. 40. 56. Yadin (1972), p. 210, n. 4, noted the fact that some of the major Canaanite temples (Alalakh, Hazor Area H, and two of the temples at Megiddo from the Early Bronze Age) are built in such a way that their corners are oriented according to the four points of the compass. In his view this illustrates Mesopotamian influence on Canaanite temple architecture. However, the sparsity of examples and the great variations amongst them prevent a clear understanding of the matter. 57. This is in contrast to Yeivin, op. cit. (above, note 2), wjio claims that the orientation of the temples to the west is an exception, and that Canaanite temples are normally oriented to the north. Wright, op. cit. (above, note 1), p. 98, writes that the normal orientation of the temples in Israel and Syria is from south-east to north-west, although he notes a lack of consistency and exceptions to this rule. Aharoni ( BA , 3 1 1 19681, p. 21) states that temples oriented to the west are rare and that the only example in the Near East, in addition to Solomon's Temple, the description of the mishkan and the temple of Arad, is the temple at Tell T ayanat. 58. Yeivin, op. cit., p. 1437, suggested that the change in orientation of the temples at Beth-Shan, Stratum V, was due to Aegean-Mycenaean influence, brought to Israel by the "Sea Peoples" settling at Beth-Shan. However, as we have seen, it is difficult to find a homogeneous temple architecture in the Mycenaean world, and even more difficult to fix a rule for orientation of Mycenaean sacred buildings. In the examples brought by Yeivin, entrance is from the southeast. 59. For a general discussion, see Encyclopedia Biblica IV, s.v. mizbeah (Hebrew). For a discussion of the biblical description of the altar, see Conrad, op.cit. (above, n. 43). 60. Wright, op. cit. (above, note 3), pp. 83-93. 61. Yadin (1972), pp. 80-81, p. 76, Fig. 19. 62. Beth-Shan I, pp. 12-13; Plan, Fig. 1. Rowe defined the installation in Room 3, south of the "temple", as an altar and thus used the term "altar" for the complex of monolithic steps (No. 7) at the western end the corridor. I suggest that the two brick-built installations located in the courtyard, before the temple, should be seen as altars rather than "tables", as denoted by the excavator. The dimensions of the larger installation are c. 1.2 X 1.8 m. 63. Stratum VII: Beth-Shan 11:1, p. 10, Pl. V. The altar was poorly repaired in Stratum VI (Locus 1 102). Room 1096, attributed by James to the upper phase of Stratum V (Beth- Shan IA, Fig. 77), seems not originally to have belonged to the temple courtyard. It should be noted that the altars of the Strata VII- VI temples were found behind the temple and not before it. 64. Y. Aharoni, BA, 31 (1968), pp. 19-21. 65. Y.

According to Woolley, the temple itself was founded already in the Late Bronze Age, on the basis of the structural style of the walls. In the neo-Hittite period, the architectural complex of the temenos, including the altar, was founded and the carved monuments which decorate the building were installed. This chronological conclusion fits the building type, which is similar to the temples at Alalakh and Hazor. 69. For- a summary of the discoveries in Cyprus, see D.H.P.

The building is described as being divided into rectangular spaces with square, monolithic pilasters used in the construction. We cannot accept the excavator's suggestion that this latter building technique is related to techniques used in the Aegean and Anatolia. 4. J.A. Callaway and R.E. Cooley, BASOR , 201 (1971), pp. 9-19. The plan of one of the houses has been published, in R.E. Cooley, Bulletin Series of the Near East Archaeological Society, N.S. 5 (1975), p. 16, Fig. 2. This house has three spaces. The excavators have dated the houses to the first part of the Iron Age I and, according to them, they were destroyed before the end of the Iron Age I. 5. Y.

Kempinski, op. cit. (above, note 5), pp. 144-147, has suggested that Tel Sippor was one of the Israelite settlement sites. This claim is not convincing. Tell Sippor, Stratum III is a small Canaanite site of the Late Bronze Age, while Stratum II is a small Philistine site. Both should not, to my mind, be paralleled to the sequence at Tell Masos. 13. Compare, for example, the houses of Area C at Hazor ( Hazor II, Pl. CCVIII) and Area BB at Megiddo (Megiddo II, Figs. 401-403). 14. T.B.M. III, pp. 19-22, PI. 2, the building in squares SE 12- 22-13-23. This house is a rebuilding of a house of Stratum C. Albright mentions a similar process at Bethel. Although at Megiddo only fragments of houses were uncovered in Stratum VI, it seems that they, too, were parts of courtyard houses; see Megiddo II, Figs. 286, 405, 410, 413. For Tel Masos, sec V.

This drawing has been copied in various publications on biblical archaeology as an example of a smelting furnace of the Iron Age. But this reconstruction has undergone severe criticism, see B. Rothenberg, Tsfunot Negev, Tel Aviv, pp. 57-58 (Hebrew). According to Rothenberg, the furnace found at Tell Qasile was used for smelting metal ingots, which were subsequently recast into vessels. The reconstruction of the upper part of the furnace, and of the air channels, is baseless. 19. Mazar (1951), pp. 197-201.

However, this date seems to be unsafe. Mask No. 1, depicting a bearded man, is very similar to the Punic masks; see Moscati, op. cit. (above, note 8), PI. 75. Mask No. 2, depicting a female visage, is stylistically similar to the masks from Achzib and is therefore probably Phoenician, dating to the Iron Age II. 37. E. et J.

Yadin, "Symbols of Deities at Z ingirli, Carthage and Hazor", in J. A. Sanders (ed.), Near Eastern Archaeology in the Twentieth Century (Essays in Honor of Nelson Glueck), New York 1970, pp. 221-224. Yadin has suggested to relate the Phoenician masks with the title "pnei ba'al" (literary "Face of Ba'al") given to Tanit in Punic inscriptions: "It may be asked whether these very masks were the "face of Ba'al" proper, i.e. the representation of Tanit in the form of VSDJD. If this assumption is correct, these objects are then connected with the cult of Tanit , the mask signifying Tanit VyaJD" (p. 221). In the same way, Yadin explains the significance of the masks from Hazor: "We might assume that here, as well, the mask signifies the "Face of Ba'al" and is directly connected with the cult of the consort of this temple's Ba'ar (p. 223). 41.

In Nasbeh I, p. 236, McCown suggested that triangular windows were common in the Iron Age and that round and rectangular windows were more characteristic of the Bronze Age. This differentiation, however, does not stand up to the evidence; triangular windows appear already in the Middle Bronze Age (at Nahariya) and in the Late Bronze Age (at Hazor and Lachish). It seems that no rules regarding the development of windows can be made. 64. Ugaritica II, pp. 260-261, Fig. 11:1. 65. Ibid., Fig. 1 10, Nos. 40-42; Nilsson (1950), pp. 273-274.

Clay bird figurines appear in Israel in the Middle and Late Bronze Ages {Megiddo II, PI. 245:18-19; Lachish II, Pl. XXVIII :3), but they are different in style from ours.

Wachsmann, in a seminar paper on early shipping delivered at the Department of Archaelogy of the Hebrew University, has raised the possibility that the origin of the sanctity of birds is in their being navigational aids. Thus, on a drawing of a ship on a Mycenaean vessel, a bird ornaments the prow of the ship. See I. Sakilarakis, Ephemeris 1971, p. 210, Fig. 9.

These are usually interpreted as similar animal- shaped rhytons. See J.H. Breasted, Ancient Records of Egypt II, Chicago 1906, p. 210, No. 509; p. 211, No. 518. See also Knossos II, p. 658, where Evans claims that the Syrian rhytons were of Cretan origin. 1 1. Megiddo Ivories, PI. 4:2. A few rhytons have been found in Late Bronze Age strata in Israel, although none of them is lion-shaped; see Beth-Shan 11:1, Pis. XIX :2, XLIV A:3, XLVI A: 1-2; TA.H ., Pl. XXX, No. 428. 12.

The importance of the lion in this period is emphasized both in the Samson cycle (Judges 14:5-6) and by the discovery of a lion's skull at the so-called "Lion Temple" at Jaffa, dated to c. 1200 B.C.; see J. Kaplan, op. cit. (above, Chapter 9, n. 22). However, the lion motif was popular in all branches of ancient Near Eastern and Aegean art, and thus no particular statement should be made concerning its role in the Philistine cult. 16. Nilsson (1950), p. 145. 17. There is some similarity between the depiction of the animal's face on our vase and that on the stone bowl from Tell Beit Mirsim; see T.B.M.

In Egypt the hippopotamus goddess Ta-weret (Teoris) was a friendly goddess, goddess of motherhood; see E.W. Budge, From Fetish to God in Ancient Egypt, Oxford 1934, p. 84; A. Erman, Die Religion der √Ñgypter, Berlin 1934, p. 146, Fig. 54. Yet her artistic representation does not recall the depiction on our vessel; see Hayes, op. cit.

The motif of alternating open and closed lotus flowers is common in Egypt and appears also on Egyptian vessels found in Canaan, e.g., Ancient Gaza III, PI. XLIV:77, and in Egyptian representations of elaborate vessels, e.g., C.F.A. SchaefTer, Ugaritica III, Paris 1956, p. 193, Fig. 157; p. 200, Fig. 168. The motif of the alternating open and closed papyrus plants appears on Syrian vessels depicted in Egyptian art; see Montet (1937), p. 55, Fig. 50; p. 64, Fig. 81; p. 77, Figs. 92-94. This motif appears also on the Arslan-Tash ivories; see F. Thureau-Dangin, Arslan-Tash, Paris 1931, Pl. XLV: 101-103. 23. See, for example, in Mesopotamian art: Frankfort (1939), Pl.

The term kernos as a definition for this type of vessel has been used since the end of the 19th century, though its connection with the classical Greek kernos is not at all established. For a discussion, see S. Xanthoudides, "Cretan Kernoi", ABSA, 12 (1905-06), pp. 9-23. Xanthoudides saw a continuous development from the kernoi of the Early Minoan period (which actually are goblets bearing small vessels) through the "ring vessels", and on to the bowls carrying goblets from the Classical period, identified by him as the kernoi described in classical literature (see examples: Knossos I, p. 76, Fig. 44; H. Thompson, Hesperia, 3 1 19341, p. 340, Fig. 20). I see no connection between these three types of vessels, which served cultic functions in various periods. The word kernos should be regarded simply as a technical term, the term "ring vase", employed in certain publications, is perhaps more suitable for these vessels. 44. Razor II, Pl. CXLVI:18; Y. Aharoni, Tel Aviv, 1 (1974), p. 40, PI. 8:5. 45.

The kernoi from the Early Bronze Age in Cyprus are assembled in Pieridou (1971), pp. 21-22, PI. VIII:l-4, 6. For a similar kernos fragment from Egypt, dating probably to the Middle Kingdom, see W.F.

(above, n. 43), p. 16, PI. 3; Nilsson (1950), p. 138, Fig. 48. The earlier kernoi from Crete are completely different in shape and it is, therefore, difficult to accept the view that the kernos was a common object in Crete. There seems to be confusion between two different types of objects (see above, note 43; Mylonas 1 19661, 381 ; Vermeule, op. cit. I above. Chapter 11, n. 9 1, p. 291). The date of the isolated kernos from Crete is disputed; see C. Blinkenberg and K.F. Kinch, Lindos 1, Berlin 1931, p. 31 1, where it is ascribed to the 7th- 5th centuries B.C. 55. Ayrton et. al ., Abydos III, London 1904, Pl. XVI :4. This kernos has a pair of pomegranate-shaped vessels as well as others, and hence is an important parallel for the kernoi of the Iron Age I from Palestine; see also E.

The identification was made by Dr. Henk K. Mienis, Curator, Mollusc Collection, Zoological Museum, Hebrew University, Jerusalem. The conch was also examined by Mr. David Reese from the University of Cambridge, who prepares for publication the material from Kommos, Crete. I thank Mr. Reese for the information which is included in the paragraph on our conch, as well as for the references in the following note. 30. See J.C. Pendlebury, The Archaeology of Crete , London 1931, p. 130; J.N. Coldstream and G.L. Huxley (eds.). Kythera , London 1972, p. 229. The full list of examples from the Minoan culture will be published by D. Reese in the Kommos report. 31. See E. D. Van Burn, Clay Figurines of Babylonia and Assyria , New Haven 1930, Pl. LIX, where it is suggested that music and noises were performed in the ritual in order "to make such loud and pleasing noise that no ill omened sound could be heard, and to drive away demons by their sacred clamour" (cited in Ashdod II- III, p. 133). 32.
