First of all, I am grateful to the Managing Committee (now Council) of the British School at Athens for granting the permission to undertake the study and to use the notebooks and photographs from the 1937-39 excavations stored in the archives in Athens. During this study Directors of the British School at Athens provided much help, and I owe thanks to all of them: Elizabeth French, David Blackman, James Whitley, and Catherine Morgan. The librarian of the British School, Penny Wilson, and the archivist, Amalia Kikissis, were of great help in providing me with photos and especially with access to the Karphi notebooks. I could not have done the work without the support of the then Knossos Curator, Colin Macdonald who helped in every conceivable way, from the logistics of transporting the boxes from the Museum to discussions of LM IIIC pottery. The staff of the British School at Knossos and numerous visiting scholars were also of great assistance, in particular Steffi Chlouveraki, Eleni Hatzaki, Carl Knappett, Conn Murphy, and Joanne Murphy. My thanks also go to Gail Hoffman, with whom I worked in the museum in 1994 and who shared with me her knowledge of Phoenician and Cypriote pottery I am particularly grateful to the former Directors of the Herakleion Museum, Charalambos Kritsas and Alexandra Karetsou, to the epimeletria in charge of my work, Ioanna Serpetenaki, and to all the guards who watched over the work so diligently. Tassos and Irini Karoussas, then conservators at the Herakleion Museum, helped to find and make available the large krater from K 131 so that we could draw it despite its deteriorating condition. Permits were obtained for this study from the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, and I am grateful to the staff of the School for its support and help. In particular, I wish to thank Maria Pilali for taking care of all of the details and to the Directors of the School, William Coulson, James Muhly, and Steven Tracy for their support. Much of the study and writing of this analysis was carried out in the Blegen Library of the American School of Classical Studies, and I owe thanks to all the staff who keep it running so well. Finally, I am grateful to Natalia Vogeikoff-Brogan for providing storage of and access to the drawings in the archives of the American School during the study. Most of the drawings of the pottery were done by the author and Roxana Docsan, who also inked all of the figures; I am grateful to her for her meticulous care with a difficult body of material. In 1991 Margaret Mook drew some of the vessels. In 1997 Lyla Pinch Brock and Christopher White also joined me in drawing and conservation of the pottery. Thanks also go to Ann Brysbaert, who helped in 1997 with temporary conservation on the pottery so that it could be recorded. Photographs were taken by the author and printed by Katherine May at the INSTAP Study Center for East Crete with the help of a publication grant from the Institute for Aegean Prehistory. I am also grateful to Eleanor Huffman, who digitised all of the drawings. Funding for this study came from a variety of sources. In 1991 I was aided by the Harriet Pomerance Fellowship from the Archaeological Institute of America and a Fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies. The work in 1994 was made possible by the McLean-McTurnan-Arnold Faculty Research Fellowship from Wabash College. In 1996 and 1997 support was provided by the Institute for Aegean Prehistory. Research on the Karphi material was made possible by Faculty Development Grants and Sabbatical leave grants from Wabash College. I am grateful for all of this financial assistance. Over the years, many productive discussions with other scholars have helped in the analysis of the Karphi material. In particular, I would like to thank the following: Gerald Cadogan, Kostis Christakis, the late William Coulson, Anna Lucia D'Agata, Theodoros Eliopoulos, Geraldine Gesell, Kevin Glowacki, Birgitta Hallager, Barbara Hayden, Athanasia Kanta, Nancy Klein, Colin Macdonald, Joseph Maran, Jennifer Moody, Margaret Mook, Penelope Mountjoy, Krzysztof Nowicki, Jeremy Rutter, Metaxia Tsipopoulou, Lee Ann Turner, Saro Wallace, Peter Warren, Vance Watrous, James Whitley, and Assaf Yasur-Landau. Saro Wallace's excellent book, Ancient Crete, unfortunately came out too late to take into account in my presentation, but it is listed in the bibliography (Wallace 2010). Finally I thank the British School at Athens for including this volume in the Studies Series, and specifically Alan Johnston (Chairman of the BSA Publication Committee), Olga Krzyszkowska (Series Editor) and Rayna Andrew (Production Editor). Finally, I wish to thank my husband Joseph Day, without whose financial, intellectual, and moral support over the long years, this study could never have been completed. Leslie Preston Day March 2011</page><page sequence="12">Preface This volume presents a re-examination of the pottery from the excavations at Karphi conducted by the British School at Athens under the direction of John Pendlebury from 1937-39. Although Pendlebury published a final report of those excavations before his untimely death in 1941, the pottery study had not been completed at that time, and it was not until 1960 that Mercy Seiradaki published her analysis of this material. The publication spurred renewed interest in the transitional period that spanned the period after the collapse of the great palatial centres on Crete and before the rise of the polis, but almost immediately questions arose about the dating of the Karphi settlement and the nature of the buildings, questions which could only be answered by a restudy of the pottery and by renewed excavation. This report represents the result of fieldwork undertaken on Crete between 1991 and 1998. What began as an interest in LM IIIC pottery assemblages that might help in the interpretation of the material from the excavations at Kavousi-Vronda (of which I was co director) became a long-term project to study and publish more fully the material from Karphi that was still extant in the Herakleion Museum. In May of 1991 a brief initial study of the material in boxes then in the east storerooms of the Herakleion Museum showed how much was preserved. Ironically, the work had to be cut short because of activities commemorating the 50th anniversary of the German invasion of Crete, the military engagement in which John Pendlebury lost his life. Even this brief exposure to the Karphi pottery showed two things that demanded further consideration. First, there was far more preserved pottery than was drawn and photographed in the publication. Second, nearly every vessel, including fragments, had its find spot marked in ink, making it possible to consider and illustrate the pottery in context. A more thorough study began in the winter of 1994, when I was able to draw, photograph, and describe the nearly complete vases in the west storerooms of the Herakleion Museum, a task that was completed in May of that year. Study seasons continued in May of 1995 and 1996, when the sherd material in the boxes was moved to the Stratigraphical Museum at Knossos for analysis. A final season took place in September through November of 1997 at Knossos. The period from 1997 to the present has been spent in the analysis of the pottery, taking into account the large number of sites of the period that have been excavated in the last 50 years. During the study seasons at Knossos I was able to strew much of the material from the boxes stored in the museum. The larger storage jars that were still preserved could not be restored and many of the vessels were only pieced together long enough to draw and photograph. It was not possible to examine the nearly complete pottery along with the fragments in the boxes at the same time, and some joins that might have been possible were never made. Nevertheless, the vessels presented here represent a more complete view of the Karphi assemblages than is available in the 1960 report. Although every attempt was made to find a ceramic petrographer willing to undertake the analysis of the Karphi coarse wares, it was not until 2006 that such an analysis became possible. Eleni Nodarou helped to choose the samples from the Karphi material and carried out the pétrographie analysis at the INSTAP Study Center for East Crete. We chose to concentrate on the boxes of material recovered from the Temple in 1937, since all sherd material from that season was kept and was still in the original boxes. Although the pottery represents a highly specialised group of vessels for a specific and unusual function, the fragments come from a more complete range of coarse fabrics than the individual pieces selected by the excavators to keep because of some special feature. This group was supplemented by fragments of other types of vessels from the buildings. The material is still in the Herakleion Museum. The fragments were re-boxed and have been moved to a remote storage space, and at the time of the writing the rest is still in the Museum, which remains closed for renovations. While I might have liked to check a few details, it has not been possible to do so. The original pencil drawings and the inked drawings now reside in the archives of the British School at Athens.</page><page sequence="13">1 Introduction The site of Karphi, high on a mountain peak overlooking the Lasithi Plain in eastern Crete, has elicited interest since its excavation by members of the British School at Athens from 1937-1939 under the direction of John Pendlebury (FIG. 1.1). Belonging to the transitional period between the fall of the Minoan palaces and the rise of the Greek city-state, it was one of the first sites thoroughly investigated on Crete from that little-known period often referred to as the dark ages. Pendlebury published his findings with admirable speed, spurred on by the imminent war.1 The final report on the architecture, objects, and history of the site was brief but thorough, with one exception; no analysis of the pottery was included. The pottery was plentiful and particularly difficult to clean, and vessels could not be mended drawn, and photographed in time for the publication. Although a manuscript on the pottery was completed by Mercy Money-Coutts (Seiradaki) before the war and approved by Pendlebury at that time, the publication did not actually appear until I960.2 For this article Seiradaki added some photographs and drawings to her earlier manuscript, but she did not go back and make a new study in light of subsequent archaeological discoveries on Crete. Nevertheless, this publication was most welcome, as Karphi was and still is the most extensively excavated site of the LM IIIC-PG period on Crete, and it enters into every discussion of the period. The published material immediately gave rise to questions about the dating of the settlement and its place in the history of Crete. The excavators observed little or no meaningful stratigraphy, leading to the conclusion that Karphi was a one-period site in use for a rather short period of time, roughly two hundred years from c. 1100-900 BC.3 Any phasing of the parts of the city had to be done on the basis of architectural remains.4 Pendlebury dated the site to the 'Intermediate Period', a label which he saw as more accurate than either SM or PG.5 The term SM implies that the people producing the pottery were Minoans even if mainland elements had come into Crete during LM II—III, while PG suggests that the people had strong mainland connections and stood at the beginning of the Hellenic culture that ultimately dominated the island. 'Intermediate Period' was considered a more neutral term without implications about the ethnicity of the people who inhabited Crete during that period. Nonetheless, the term has been abandoned for more specific chronological or stylistic terminology. Pendlebury called the majority of the pottery SM, with a small amount of PG;6 only after Seiradaki's publication of the pottery in 1960 was it clear that most of the material was LMIIIC. Vincent Desborough was the first to attribute the material to LM IIIC, maintaining that the settlement, while it was founded in the middle or latter part of IIIC, lasted only a hundred years rather than the two hundred assigned it by Pendlebury.7 Mervyn Popham refined the phasing, suggesting that Karphi belonged to the second half of the LM IIIC period, although he admitted that it may have been founded earlier.8 Other scholars have agreed that there was earlier material, including Athanasia Kanta,9 who concluded that the site was first inhabited during an early stage of LM IIIC and that inhabitation continued into the SM Period. Birgitta Hallager pointed to the LM IIIB character of some of the published Karphi pottery and believed that the settlement was inhabited at the very beginning of the LM IIIC period.10 As to when the settlement was abandoned there is even greater confusion. Several scholars have pointed to the report of PG sherds at Karphi,11 and Watrous reiterated this late date on the basis of conversations he had with Mercy Money-Coutts Seiradaki before her death.12 Certainly some of the published pottery can be assigned to the SM or even to the EPG periods, but it was unclear how much later material was found on the site and whether the entire settlement was inhabited into the 10th century. As more material of the LM IIIC-PG periods has come to light on Crete, the question of dating the Karphi material has become more pressing.

Plan ofKarphi (with permission of the British School at Athens).</page><page sequence="15">INTRODUCTION Kastelli Pediada,17 Kavousi,18 Khalasmenos,19 and Kastri20 have provided stratified sequences or closed deposits that allow us to distinguish at least three phases of LM IIIC,21 although there is still no consensus on what these should be called or how they are correlated with the phases of LH IIIC on the mainland.22 The very earliest phase of LM IIIC, in which LM IIIB styles were still prevalent, has been distinguished at Kavousi Kastro and Khania.23 Many sites, including Khania, Khamalevri, Sybrita/Thronos, Kastrokephala, Knossos, Kastelli Pediada, Kavousi-Fronda, Ksvousi-Kastro, and Kastri have produced material that has been identified as early LM IIIC, and at Sybrita/Thronos, Knossos, and Khamalevri two phases of early LM IIIC have been distinguished. It is, however, still difficult at this time to define a middle phase of LM IIIC. As for late LM IIIC, we now know more from other sites in eastern Crete: Kavousi-Vronda, Kavousi Kastro, and Khalasmenos; some pits at Sybrita/Thronos also date to this late phase of LM IIIC stylistically, if not stratigraphically. The SM phase has been more difficult to distinguish, and much of the material attributed to this period comes from cemeteries, rather than stratified habitation sites. Knossos has produced several non-funerary deposits of the SM period, including the Spring chamber,24 the Stratigraphical Museum excavations,25 and the Unexplored Mansion.26 At Sybrita/Thronos several pits can be attributed to SM, and two separate phases of this period have been distinguished by the excavator.27 The cemeteries at Knossos have further helped to understand the PG period.28 This new information has created more questions about the place of Karphi in the history of this period. A re-examination of the pottery, then, is much needed. Recent work on Karphi has also concentrated on reconstructing the social, religious, and political organisation of the settlement,29 and the re-examination of the pottery in its context can provide some evidence for the social organisation of Karphi. Since every piece of pottery and every vessel that was kept from the site had the number of the room in which it was found written on it in ink, and most of these numbers survive and are still legible, it is possible to recontextualise the extant pottery to see whole assemblages that might give clues about the lives and social organisation of the people. Thus, in this pu blication, the pottery is catalogued by room and building or by grave, rather than by type, as Seiradaki organised her publication; the pottery is analysed by type in a separate chapter (Chapter 9). A consideration of the contexts that produced the vessels can also show where the earliest and latest materials were found. In particular, it is important to distinguish whether a vessel or group of vessels comes from within a house, from a street or court, or from one of the tombs, since the depositional histories of these different areas were not necessarily the same. The assemblages presented here are not in any way complete; much pottery was thrown away during excavation. It is fortunate that the excavation notebooks still survive in the archives of the British School at Athens, and one of these notebooks records lists of pottery from every room on the site. Whenever possible, the lists of pottery recorded in the notebook are given in the discussion of the room, as these accounts in general are more detailed than the brief mention in Pendlebury's final report. The buildings at Karphi were uncovered over a three year period, and the pottery was handled in a different way in each season. In 1937 work concentrated on the Temple, although local workers also removed material from Mikre Koprana, a small peak to the east. All the fragments of pottery from this season were saved. In 1938 Rooms 2-57 were uncovered. The pottery was taken down to Tzermiado for washing and study, and much of it was discarded there.30 1939 saw the excavation of Rooms 58-150. In this season, the pottery was sorted on site, and although all of the fine ware was kept, the majority of the coarse vessels were thrown away without washing. In the last two seasons, some information about the discarded pottery was recorded in the excavation notebook, and in 1939 the recognis able types of the various shapes were recorded (e.g. three dishes of Type 2). It is not possible, however, to know what percentage of the pottery found was described or kept. Thus, what is available for study is the result not only of the site formation process, but also of the decisions made by the excavators about the worth of the artefacts. All of the fine wares remain, in addition to whole or nearly complete coarse vessels, or any pieces that were deemed of interest. The preserved pottery, then, is not necessarily a representa tive sample of the shapes, decoration, or fabrics of the 17 Rethemiotakis 1997. 18 Mook and Coulson 1997; Mook 2004; Day 1997; Kavousi IIA. 19 Coulson and Tsipopoulou 1994; Tsipopoulou 2004. 20 Kastri. 21 See D'Agata 2007 for a good summary, especially 101, table 3. 22 Hallager 2007, Mountjoy 2007. 23 Mook and Coulson 1997, 342^4 (Kavousi-&amp;rfro, Phase I); Mook 2004, 164-9; Hallager 2000, 173. 24 Evans 1928, 123-39. 25 Warren 1983, 76-83. 26 Popham 1992, 59-66. 27 D'Agata 1999,201-06; 2007,95,99-101.1 do not, however, agree with her terminology, particularly in her distinction of two phases of SM, which I take here as a single chronological phase; much of what she calls SM I would fit better into the category of very late LM IIIC in my opinion. 28 Brock 1957; Catling and Coldstream 1996. 29 Nowicki 1999; Wallace 2005; Day and Snyder 2004. 30 Seiradaki, 1.</page><page sequence="16">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION Karphi assemblages; nevertheless, a large amount of material does remain and can be used with the publications to make conclusions about the history and society of the settlement. The Karphi material is now stored in the Herakleion Museum and its satellite storerooms. Over the years, with the vicissitudes of history, some of the pottery was inevitably lost. Some vessels had disappeared already at the time of Seiradaki's work, while others seem to have been lost or misplaced in subsequent years. Nearly 140 restored vessels and 65 boxes of fragments were present in the Herakleion Museum when the project began in 1991. During the course of this study, an attempt was made to draw all of the extant pottery for which some shape or decoration was discernable. Many tiny fragments were too small to draw or too worn to determine their precise shape or decoration, and only a brief verbal description was made of them. Frequently sherds from different layers in a room or area were kept in separate compartments in the boxes, each with its own label, and although fragmentary these pieces do provide some information about the depositional histories of the rooms in which they were found. None of the small finds was studied, with the exception of several terracotta objects found with the pottery, such as spools, loomweights, and a potter's wheel. The metal and stone objects that had been inventoried were kept separate from the pottery, and no attempt was made to re examine them; similarly, a large box of stone tools was left unstudied. The figurines from the Middle Minoan peak sanctuary on the summit of Karphi are part of an on-going study by Alan Peatfield, and the terracotta figurines from the settlement are also part of a separate study by Geraldine Gesell, who has also looked at the cult equipment from the Temple. A few pieces of the ritual equipment from the site are catalogued; snake tubes and stands are considered part of the ceramic assemblages of Karphi, with the exception of the 'altar' from K 57, which forms part of Gesell's study. The god dess statues have been well studied by Rethemiotakis31 and Gesell,32 and the large chariot rhyton by Robert Koehl,33 so they are not included in the catalogues. The pottery is discussed and catalogued according to its building, room, or area, beginning with Mikre Koprana and the eastern side of the settlement. The centre of the settlement has been divided into four quadrants: the northeast (the Temple, Temple depend encies, Great House, Baker's House and surrounding streets), the southeast (the Magazines, Southern Houses, Small Shrine, and surrounding streets and squares), the southwest (the Priest's House, Central West Quarter, and Southern Shelters, with their associated streets), and the northwest (the Commercial Quarter, Eastern and Western CliffHouses, Northern Shelters, and Summit). The tombs follow in a separate chapter, and finally the ceramics of uncertain context are discussed. No attempt has been made to modify Pendlebury's original building and room designations, although more recent studies by Rutkowski of the Temple and Wallace of several of the buildings have been taken into account.34 The discussion for each room includes a brief description of its features. If there was any indication of stratigraphy in the room, every attempt has been made to distinguish the pottery from the different layers. Also included is a list of pottery recorded in the excavation notebook for each room, often more detailed than the published account. To help in understanding room function, a list of inventoried objects is also included, with their numbers and references to illustrations in the original publication. Any other objects that were not inventoried but mentioned in the notebook or publication are also noted. Each vessel or fragment has been catalogued according to its context, and for most of these pieces of pottery, the context was assumed to be the number written on it in ink or occasionally pencil (e.g. K 57, M 1). Sometimes the number was not clear, because the ink had flaked off or the number had been written on sediment that had been washed or worn off. If a number could be reasonably guessed at, the object has been catalogued in that context, although note is made that the number was unclear and alternative possibilities are also given. If the number was totally illegible or lacking, the object is catalogued as from an uncertain context. At times, the number on a published vessel did not agree with that in the publication. Whenever discrepancies occurred it was assumed that the number written on the surface was more likely to be correct, especially since the publication came out 20 years after the excavation and Seiradaki did not go back and look at all the pottery again. Occasionally Seiradaki gave the same vessel a different context number in the figures and plates; if one of these agreed with the number written on the vessel, that was accepted as more accurate, but if not, then references in the publication or notebook were used to make a reasonable guess at the correct context. Catalogue numbers have been assigned according to context (e.g. Kl.l). Vessels of uncertain context are simply labelled K.1-K.65. Pottery is catalogued according to fabric in the following order: fine wares, medium-coarse wares, coarse wares, and cooking wares; cooking wares are, of course, always coarse wares, but show evidence of having been used directly in the fire for food preparation. Within each of these four categories, the open vessels are given first, then 31 Rethemiotakis 1998, 2001. 32 Gesell, Glowacki and Klein forthcoming. 33 Koehl 2006, 83. 34 Rutkowski 1987; Wallace 2005.</page><page sequence="17">INTRODUCTION 5 the closed shapes, beginning with the smallest shapes (e.g. cup) and proceeding to the largest (e.g. pithos). Whole or nearly complete vessels of each shape are given first, then rim, base, and handle fragments, and finally body sherds. Catalogue entries include the following: Catalogue number (PLATE and FIG. references). Identifi cation of object. Preservation. Measurements. Description of material and details of manufacture (including fabric, colour, wear, and surface appearance). Details of shape or decoration. Type if applicable. Previous publications if applicable. Comparanda. Date. Measurements are in centimetres. Colours are given according to the Munsell Soil Chart. Whenever possible, the colours were taken in direct sunlight, with the sun behind the viewer. The nearly complete vessels in the Museum, however, were often done without direct sunlight. Such colours are, of course, arbitrary, but the Munsells give some consistency to the recording of colour. An attempt was made to describe the inclusions in the coarse and cooking pottery based on macroscopic analysis; since the investigator is not a geologist, these may be incorrect, but they are based on previous experience with coarse fabrics at Kavousi. During the actual study seasons, it was not possible to do a systematic sampling of fabrics for petrographic analysis, but in 2006 petrographic analysis of the Karphi pottery was carried out by Eleni Nodarou on some 85 fragments, primarily from the Temple. The material from the Temple seems to have included most of the coarse fabric types found on the cooking and storage vessels in the houses, even if the pottery does represent a collection of highly specialised shapes. Since all of the pottery from the Temple was kept, it represents a more complete sample of the range of coarse fabrics. The results of the petrographic analysis can be found in the Appendix. The pottery is analysed in Chapter 9 according to shape. A basic description of the fine wares, medium coarse wares, coarse wares, and cooking wares is followed by an analysis of the pottery by shapes; decoration is generally discussed within each shape. No attempt has been made to change or supplement Seiradaki's typology. In general the distinguishing features of each of her types were not explained; when she has made an error in identification (as in mistaking a tripod cooking pot for ajar), she has created types that do not exist. It seemed best to discuss the shapes in general, rather than adding to an already problematic typology. The final chapter considers the new evidence for the chronology of the Karphi settlement, as well as making suggestions about the functions of rooms and buildings based on the pottery and objects found within. This section is necessarily brief, based as it is on incomplete evidence. It is hoped that the reopening of excavations at Karphi will provide more evidence to reconstruct the society of this important settlement.</page><page sequence="18">2 The eastern side of the settlement Mikre Koprana (K 147-K 150), Eastern Quarter (K 135-K 144), Barracks (K 2-K 7, K 134) and Road House (K 145), Southeast Block (K 130-K 132) MIKRE KOPRANA (ROOMS K 147-K 150) Lying on a peak to the northeast of the main settlement are the rooms excavated as Mikre Koprana (fig. l.l).1 Although the major excavation of the area took place late in the 1939 season, there had also been some archaeological activity in 1937. The notebook for 1937 simply notes that 'sherds were dug up by peasants' while the excavators were working at the Temple, and there were no traces of walls in the excavated area. The notebook records pithoi or large jars, eleven large and four small spools, and stone pounders (three of Type 3 and one of Type 6). Much pottery preserved in the storerooms bears the following designations: MK1, MK IE, MK 1NE, MK IN, or MK 1W. This material came from the 1937 investigation or was excavated before the rooms were defined. When published by Seiradaki, some of these vessels were given a room designation, and sometimes there are conflicting room numbers in different places in the report; if there is any doubt, such pieces are here catalogued according to the designation written on the vessel. The excavators believed that there was a single building on a plateau on top of the summit.2 There was little soil deposition, and the bedrock often appeared 20 cm below the surface; few traces of roofing appeared in the rooms. The main entrance into the building was from the east into K 147. Outside this entrance lay a semicircular vat or bin paved with flat slabs and containing a pithos base and a whetstone. Although he compared this object to what may be a dyeing vat at Archaic Kolonna, Pendlebury thought it was more likely to be a watering trough.3 Room K 147 The building on Mikre Koprana was entered by a doorway into K 147 from the east. This was a large room that may have been divided into two. The excavators suggested that it was built against a pre existing room, but they did not indicate whether this room was K 149 or K 150. Steps led down to the south from the southeast corner to a denuded room. A door on the west led into K 149. The notebook gives much information about the pottery to add to the limited discussion in the publication. Coarse ware included at least five pithoi, one very large one of Type 15, with rope decoration and chevrons and chevrons on the handles, two of Types 6 and 23, and one each of Types 7 and 14; eight pithoid jars, six ofType 3, two ofType 7; several jars ofTypes 2 and 3; tripod legs and a rim ofType 1; a tripod pithos; eleven dishes, eight ofType 6, three ofType 1; a tripod 'lebes;' a kalathos ofType 1; small basin ofType 7; and a trefoil 'lamp'(i.e. a scuttle). Fine wares included a hut urn (K147.17), a small spouted jar, a jug with ridged neck, a cup in blue ware ofType 1, two pyxides ofType 2 (K147.16), two stirrup jars ofType 2, and several bowls ofTypes 1 and 2. The krater base pictured in Seiradaki was not located.4 Other published pottery was not found, including the large basin5 and a pithos with incised chevrons on bands and incised serpentine rope bands, probably the one mentioned in the notebook.6 In addition to the catalogued pottery, the boxes produced the following: three handle fragments from deep bowls bearing multiple pendent loops, a spiral, and a multiple curvilinear design, and a body fragment of a deep bowl with vertical strokes or fringe, and another from a deep bowl or krater with strokes, a decorated feeding bottle spout, a cooking pot with ridged decoration, and a pithos handle, flattened, with raised vertical bands and impressed circles. Objects from K 147 included a bronze knife with twisted handle (687),7 two bronze angle pieces (688, 689), a bronze fibula (690),8 a fragment of a knobbed stone lid (683), two conical stone beads or whorls (684, 685), a double-pierced stone disc (686), four terracotta spindle whorls (two conical, one cylindrical, one biconical in shape) (691,692,693,694), three terracotta spools (695), and animal bones. The pottery from K 147 gives clues to the function of the building. The large number of pithoi (5) and 1 The plan published by Nowicki 1987, figs. 2 and 3 gives a good picture of where these rooms lie in relation to the main part of the excavated settlement and other features of the site of Karphi. 2 Karphi, 69-70. 3 Karphi, 69. 4 Seiradaki, fig. 16.9. 5 Seiradaki, pi. 3c, left. 6 Seiradaki, pi. lb. 7 Karphi, pi. 28.2. 8 Karphi, pi. 29.2.</page><page sequence="19">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION pithoid jars (7), along with the tripod pithos and the large stirrup jar (K147.15) confirm that the room was used primarily for storage. The large basins may have been used for food preparation, and the cooking dishes and tripod 'lebes' (probably a round-bottomed cooking pot) were also used in cooking. The material points to storage and ordinary domestic use, although the pithoid jars and basins may also have served for washing or for some industrial function, such as dyeing of wool. Most of the whole vessels found on the floor were coarse and utilitarian and cannot provide a date for the final occupation. The basin (K147.18) is, however, a good LMIIIC shape, similar to examples from Kastri, Knossos, and Khamalevri of early LM IIIC date,9 and Kavousi-Frowrfa of late LM IIIC.10 Another exception is the fine stirrup jar (K147.15), which finds a close parallel at Khania of early LM IIIC date, where it is thought to be an import from Knossos.11 The other fine wares, however, particularly the deep bowls and kraters, are quite fragmentary, and they could have lain broken on or in the floor for some time. There is nothing that appears particularly late. On deep bowl fragments, the running spirals, hatched lozenges or lozenge chain, Minoan flower, and tricurved streamer all are motifs that appear in early deposits of LM IIIC.12 The upright multiple loops on K147.1 find parallels at Kastri, but also in Phase III at Kavousi-£asfrt&gt; of Late LM IIIC date.13 Certainly the delicate octopus stirrup jar (K147.14), another fragment of which was found in K 149, is not late, although it is without any good parallels.

Rooms K 148 and K 149 The material from these two rooms was lumped together in the publication, but kept separate in the notebook. The objects listed in the publication as coming from the two rooms are said to be from MK in the notebook, and they will be listed there. Room K 149 Room K 149 was connected to K 147 through a doorway, and it also had an additional exit on the south. There was in the room a tank in floor that the excavators thought may have been used for fermenting milk.14 The notebook lists much pottery from the room. There were at least 17 pithoi, four of Type 6, two each of Types 2 and 25, one eachofTypes 1,3, 8,12,14,15, 21, and 22, and one for which no rim found, and the feet of four tripod pithoi; the pithoi were decorated with the usual designs, including impressed circles, squares, alternating hatched triangles, zigzag with dots, X pattern, vertical slashes, oblique slashes, and alternating oblique slashes (K149.24). There were also seven pithoidjars, three ofType 3, two ofType 7, two ofType 9; several jars ofTypes 1,2,5, and 7; a very large number of tripod rims and legs of all types; at least 16 dishes, three ofType 1, one ofType 5, twelve ofType 6, with the usual holes, spouts, and handles; three basins, one ofType 5, two ofType 6; three kalathoi, one ofType 1 with a rim ofType 2,1 ofType 4 with rim ofType 3, one with goddess inside (K149.21); three one-handled jugs ofTypes 1, 7, and 8; two cups ofType 2; several small bowls; an 'egg-cup;' and a coarse kylix stem. Finer and painted pottery included a very fine krater of Type 1 with scale pattern in blue and red paint (K148.5), krater bases ofTypes 1 and 3, two pyxides ofType 2, a large jar with octopus pattern, ajar ofType 3, a one-handled jug ofType 7, two stirrup jars ofType 2, two spouted jars, two kylikes ofType 1, two dishes ofType 1, a pyxis rim of Type 4, small pots with straight sides, and several small bowls of Types 1 and 2 with usual patterns including dotted curvilinear motifs and a hatched lozenge with tricurved streamer (K149.10). There were several fragments from K 149 in the boxes that were not catalogued, including deep bowl fragments with spirals, curvilinear ornaments, floral designs, a rayed panel, and one burned example. Also found were a stirrup jar fragment with fringed decoration and a cup or kylix handle. The tray pictured in Seiradaki was not located.15 That this room was used primarily for storage is in dicated by the unusually large number of pithoi ( 17) and pithoidjars (7) recovered from it. This was the largest number of storage vessels recorded for a single room on the site. It is hard to imagine that there was room for any other activities, yet the number of cooking dishes and tripods suggests that the room was used for cooking, or at least storage of cooking vessels. The kalathos with a goddess figurine (K149.21) inside may have served a ritual function, perhaps for daily religious observance. As is usual, nearly all of the fine pottery was in fragments, and thus it may represent broken earlier material on or in the floor of the room, not what was in use at the time of abandonment. As with the frag ments from K 147, the deep bowls, kraters, and stirrup jars are of early LMIIIC style. The deep bowls or cups with multiple pendent loops (K149.3, K149.5) find parallels in LM IIIC deposits at Knossos,16 although on the earlier example the loops do not hang from 14 Karphi, 69. 15 Seiradaki, fig. 6.1, pi. 2f. 16 Popham 1965,325, fig. 5.27 (early LMIIIC); Cadogan 1967, 260, fig. 2.8 (Knossos, Kephala tholos, early LM IIIC). The date of individual vessels from the Kephala tomb is uncertain. Preston 2005, 101, places this deep bowl (P 67) within the tomb above 2.3 m, not as high in the debris as the latest LM IIIC material. D'Agata (2007,101,table3,104,fig. l)places this material in LM IIIC early.</page><page sequence="23">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION the rim band; multiple loops hanging from the rim band may be a later feature. K149.10 with its tricurved streamer has parallels at Khania, where it is a LMIIIC pattern on a LM IIIB2 shape.17 K149.8 finds parallels at Knossos and Phaistos.18 The bird motif with dotted breast on krater K149.14 is similar to krater K62.1 and to an example from Phase II at Khamalevri,19 while the palm motif finds a parallel at Khania;20 it is possible that the fragment K149.15 may belong to the same vessel.

According to the notebook, the following coarse pottery was found in this room: three pithos rims of Types 2, 8, and 23; three pithoid jars, two of Type 3, one of Type 9; ajar of Type 2; the usual tripod legs; a dish of Type 6; a kalathos of Type 1 (K148.7); and two basins of Type 7. Neither the amphora shown in Seiradaki,22 nor the cooking jug23 was certainly located, although the amphora may be the one from MK 1 (K149.20) and the cooking jug is possibly K.48. Animal bones are also recorded from this room. The pottery suggests an ordinary domestic function for the room. The material is not closely datable, but it looks early in LM IIIC; K148.2 finds parallels for shape in LM IIIA1 at Knossos, as well as at LM IIIC Phaistos,24 and the decoration on krater K148.4 finds a parallel in Phase II at Khamalevri.25 Pottery Catalogue: K148 Fine Wares K148.1 Cup (FIG. 2.4).

Mikre Koprana There is much material labelled simply MK (for Mikre Koprana), sometimes with the designation of MK 1, often with further identifications as to whether the piece came from N, S, E, or W. This is probably the material excavated in 1937 by the local villagers, and it is not clear precisely where the objects came from. Some of this material was published as coming from K 148— 149, and occasionally Seiradaki gave a room number, although the same object can be labelled with more than one room number. A large unlabelled box in the storerooms may contain the remainder of the material excavated that year. The fragments seem to represent an assemblage of pottery before discards were made. In 1937 all the material from the Temple and Mikre Koprana would have been kept. Pottery Catalogue: MK Fine Wares MK.1 Kylix (FIG. 2.6). D. rim est. 17. Single fragment from rim.

EASTERN QUARTER (ROOMS K 135-K 144) Three separate houses were identified in this area, all of megaron type, laid out in a very regular way, each with a large rectangular room, occasionally with a back room (House K138-139-140), sometimes with an ante room or 'prodromos' (Houses K 137-141 and K 138 139-140).36 Pendlebury was the first to call attention to the unusual plans of these houses and how they differed from the other houses in the settlement. He also was the first to suggest that these belonged to a Greek speaking population,37 an idea reiterated by others,38 which has led to the theory that the whole complex forms a single unit that functioned as a ruler's dwelling for the Greek-speaking leaders of the Karphi settlement.39 More recently, Nowicki suggested that the houses were not inhabited by mainlanders, but by an outside group of inhabitants who were under Mycenaean influence,40 although he later suggested that topographic constraints may have played a more important role in the arrangement of these houses.41 The regularity and layout of these houses may have more to do with utilising the available space and with the topography than with the ethnicity of the inhabitants. The rooms in the so-called Barracks, for example, are also very regular. Wallace has pointed out the differences among these houses in terms of size and configuration, based on her new observations and plans.42 These houses in the Eastern Quarter may also be of later date than those in the rest of the settlement, although it is difficult to tell, since so little was found in them. All three houses had hearths in the large rooms, and while such fixed hearths may indicate foreign influence,43 they do occur widely in LM IIIC sites throughout the island.44 None of the rooms produced a large amount of pottery or other material. House K 135-136 This area was approached from a road on the south, leading up from the Barracks. Room K 135 Only two walls were preserved on the east and north, but the excavators thought that the roof on the west side might have been supported on poles.45 The roofing material found within suggests that it could not have been a courtyard. The excavators reported finding little fine ware in the room. The notebook adds the following 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 RMDP, 954, fig. 389.47 (Naxos, LH IIIC middle). Karphi, pi. 30.3.

Scale 1:3 unless otherwise indicated.</page><page sequence="34">THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE SETTLEMENT list of pottery: a pithoid jar of Type 3, a dish of Type 6, a basin of Type 7, and tripod legs. Only one fragment labelled K 135 was found in the boxes, a deep bowl rim with a fringed loop, but this was not catalogued. There are no objects recorded from this room. Room K 136 This large room had a patch of burned earth and much charcoal in the centre of room, no doubt a hearth. There was also a possible square bench in northwest corner, but it was not indicated on the plan. Although too large for the roof to have been unsupported, the room showed no trace of interior supports. The notebook records the following coarse pottery: two pithoi of Types 1 and 14; a pithoid jar of Type 3; four two-handled jars, one of Type 2, three of Type 3; the usual tripod legs; three dishes, one of Type 1, two of Type 6; three basins, one ofType 5, two ofType 7; a kalathos ofType 4; and two stirrup jars ofType 2. Fine wares included a small cup, a jug, bowls of Types 1 and 2, and a tankard spout. No pottery has been preserved from the room. Objects from K 136 included a decorated bronze plate from a fibula (636),46 a stone bowl base (634), a cylindrical stone bead or whorl (635), a faience fragment (637), and 21 terracotta spools. The notebook adds that pumice and animal bones were found in the room. The pottery suggests ordinary domestic use, although the finds, especially the fibula, are unusual; the rarity of such objects found in settlement contexts might indicate a higher level of wealth than appears from the other objects.47 The large number of spools may indicate that weaving went on in the room. House K 137-141 This is a two-room structure, with a 'prodromos' (K 141) and a main room (K 137). Nowicki emended the plan of the building, making it appear more regular, and suggested that it could only have housed a family of five.48 K 142 may have belonged with this building rather than with House K 135-136, as the west wall is slightly thicker, but the excavators were unwilling to commit themselves to this idea. There is so little material from the building that it is impossible to date, and most of the finds suggest ordinary domestic use. Room K 141 Little roofing material was found in this room, suggesting to the excavators that it might have been open. Little was found in it, but the proportion of fine sherds was larger than usual, and they were very broken; perhaps they represent vessels that were broken and discarded during the use of the building. The pottery represented the usual types, and none has been kept. Objects from K 141 included a pierced schist lid (656) and a conical terracotta spindle whorl (657). The description of the pottery suggests refuse or material in or below floors. Room K 137 The large room of the 'megaron' may have been subdivided; a possible foundation of another wall projected from the west wall, and another linear accu mulation may also have been a wall.49 There was a hearth in centre of the northern half of room, a patch of burned earth with charcoal still on it. The pottery included sherds from a jar in coarse ware with medallions and other mouldings (called a goat's head in the notebook), and the notebook adds at least three pithoi with rims of Types 7 and 10, several pithoid jars, a basin of Type 3, ajar of Type 1, a stirrup jar of Type 5, a lid of Type 1 with rope design, and three fine stirrup jars. A tripod pithos published in Seiradaki was not located.50 Objects from this room included a bronze octagonal leg of a tripod (63 8),51 a bronze blade fragment (654), a conical stone bead or whorl (639), and a tetragonal whetstone (655). The notebook adds that there was some bone. The single preserved nearly complete vessel, a pyxis, does not help to determine the date or the function of this room. The bronze octagonal tripod leg may be the remains of a large, high status object used in the room, and has been used to support the identification of this entire complex as the ruler's house.52 Pottery Catalogue: K137 Coarse Wares K137.1 Pyxis (FIG. 2.9).

House K 138-139-140 The largest of the megaron-type houses is composed of three rooms: a 'prodromos' (K 140), a large room 46 Karphi, pi. 29.2. 47 Mazarakis Ainian 1997,304 points out how rarely fibulas are found in settlement contexts and uses this fact to support his idea that the Eastern Quarter belonged to a very wealthy 'ruler'. Bronze jewellery, implements, and weapons have been found all over the site, however, and in several places in greater numbers and with more variety than the few bronzes in the Eastern Quarter (e.g. in Room 12 of the Great House, Room 26 of the Southern Houses, and in Room 106 of the western Cliff Houses. 48 Nowicki 1999, 150. 49 Wallace 2005, 238-9. 50 Seiradaki, pi. 2a. 51 Karphi, pi. 29.2. 52 Mazarakis Ainian 1997, 220, 274. He uses Homer to show the importance of bronze tripods in the gift economy of the epic world, a world that may, however, have little to do with 12th century Karphi.</page><page sequence="35">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI —A RE-EXAMINATION with a hearth (K139), and a smaller back room (K 138). The door into K 140 was not on axis, but the doors leading to K 139 and to K 138 were. Rooms K 143 and K 144 to the east may have served as storage chambers for the building, which could have housed a family of eight.53 Room K 140 This room served as the entranceway to the building. It contained the usual sort of pottery, except that there were no pithos fragments. The notebook adds that there were two pithoid jars, three fine stirrup jars (one of Type 6), a kylix stem of Type 1 (K140.1), and a fine pyxis of Type 4. The publication mentions a fragment of a head of a figurine (644), although the notebook says that this inventoried fragment is actually from K 139. The fragments from cult objects mentioned as coming from K 140 were not described; it is possible that the reference is to the piece identified here as a fenestrated stand (K140.2). There was clearly some small-scale storage in the room, seen in the pithoid jars, and perhaps the very large kylix is the sort that could have been used in elite drinking rituals;54 it is similar in shape and decoration to kylix K120.5, and to an example from Kavousi-Fra«Ja of late LMIIIC;55 the decoration finds another parallel on a cup from Sybrita/Thronos.56 Pottery Catalogue: K140 Fine Wares K140.1 Kylix (FIG. 2.9).

Against the east wall were two upright slabs with a paving between that probably served as a jar stand or an oven. The notebook lists the following coarse pottery from this room: at least three pithoi of Types 8, 13, and 14; three pithoid jars of Types 3 and 11; a two-handled jar of Type 2; the usual tripods; six dishes, two of Type 1, four of Type 6; two kalathoi of Type 4; a basin of Type 7; two stirrup jars of Type 2; a pyxis of Type 2; and three small bowls. Fine ware included a spouted jug, a stirrup jar of Type 2 (K139.1) and a pyxis of Type 1. Objects found in the room were scanty: two conical stone beads or whorls (642,643), five terracotta spools, and some animal bones; the notebook indicates that the fragment of a terracotta figurine (644) listed in the publication as from K 140 actually comes from K 139. From the drawing of this object, it is difficult to determine from what sort of figurine the fragment comes, but apparently it represents the top of the crown and one eyebrow, possibly of a human figure, possibly an animal. The only nearly complete vessel was a medium-coarse storage stirrup jar. The whole assemblage is quite meagre and certainly not in keeping with ideas that this was a ruler's dwelling. Similarly, there is nothing in the assemblage to suggest that a different ethnic group inhabited the house. Pottery Catalogue: K139 Medium-Coarse Wares K139.1 Stirrup jar (FIG. 2.9). Max. pres.

Room K 138 This back room was a steep step up from the main room. It had traces of a stone-paved floor, but otherwise showed no unusual features. The notebook lists the coarse ware that came from the room: at least five pithoi with rims of Types 4, 5, 13, 15, and 22; two pithoid jars of Type 3; tripods with rims of Types 1 and 2 and tripod legs; three dishes of Type 6, one with a spout; two kalathoi of Types 1 and 2; a basin of Type 7; and three small bowls of Type 1. Fine ware included two stirrup jars of Types 1 and 2, five bowls of Type 1, a basin of Type 7, and a pyxis of Type 2. Pumice and animal bones were also mentioned in the notebook. The early LM IIIC deep bowl fragment with multiple loops pictured in Seiradaki was not located.57 The only 53 Nowicki 1999, 150. 54 Day and Snyder 2004. 55 Day 1997, 399, fig. 5.2; Kavousi IIA, 37, fig. 22.B3 P3. 56 Prokopiou 1997, 384, fig. 30d. 57 Seiradaki, fig. 2Id.</page><page sequence="36">THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE SETTLEMENT Fig. 2.9.

Little was found within it. The publication says that the pottery is much broken, and the notebook says none of the coarse sherds was in good enough condition to determine a type. Fine ware included several bowls and about three stirrup jars. Aside from the catalogued small krater there was also the base of a plain jug in one of the boxes. The small krater has a deep, almost carinated shape with a fairly high foot. It has a reserved band on the interior and is decorated with buttonhook spirals. The spirals are common on deep bowls in early LM IIIC deposits at Kavousi-Frorctfo, Kastri, Knossos, and Khania,60 and often are accompanied by reserved bands on the interior.

The east wall of K 143 was cut out of bedrock, and no south wall was preserved so it may have been an open courtyard.61 The north wall was incorrectly placed on the original plan, and Wallace corrected it on her plans and suggested that the room may have been used for temporary storage.62 The notebook records the following pottery: at least five pithoi of Types 3, 5, 8 and 2 of Type 25; seven pithoid jars, four of Type 3, two of Type 7, and one of Type 10; the usual tripod legs; a tripod dish; nine dishes, five of Type 1, four of Type 6; a strainer; two kalathoi of Types 1 and 4; a small lid of Type 1 (K143.3); and small jugs or jars. Fine ware included two small bowls of Types 1 and 2 and a double handle. Objects included fragments of five bone pins (660-664),63 two conical stone beads or whorls (658,681), a pierced stone disc (680), a conical (682) and a cylindrical (659) terracotta spindle whorl. The notebook also records animal bones and pumice. The pottery would indicate ordinary domestic functions of storage and cooking, but the preserved pottery is not closely datable.

THE BARRACKS (K 2-7, K 134, K 145) This area was excavated in 1938 (Rooms 2-7) and 1939 (Rooms 134, 145). The position at the entrance to the settlement and the bare rooms suggested at first the function implied in the name, but the simplicity of the rooms was later attributed to their being among the earliest buildings on the settlement.67 It is not clear whether each room constituted a single house or the rooms belonged to a single complex or multiple houses. The large amount of coarse pottery preserved from the rooms suggests that for the most part these were ordinary dwellings. The proportion of coarse ware, however, may be misleading; at the beginning of the 1938 season, when most of the rooms were excavated, more coarse ware was kept than in later seasons. Room K 2 K 2 was a simple room entered from the west with a hatchway or window at the east end, opening onto a space to the east. Traces of roofing material show that this room was roofed. Of the pottery mentioned in Seiradaki as being from this room, only a single basin could not be located.68 The notebook also mentioned several pithoi decorated with bands bearing a variety of incised decorations: straight or chevron cuts (horizontal, diagonal, or looped), impressed circles, or finger dints. Also mentioned were a tripod bowl, a pithoid jar, a pyxis with handles continuing down the sides, stirrup vases, rough dishes with flaring sides, rounded jars with horizontal uptilted handles, small bowls in fine buff (one with a side spout), a flat lid with loop handle, and a high pedestal base. The handles and tripod legs were said to have dints where attached to the bodies, and the tripod legs also had vertical cuts. 65 Wallace 2005, 242. 66 For parallels, see Prokopiou 1997, 377, fig. 18e (on a krater from Sybrita/Thronos). 67 Karphi, 72-3. 68 Seiradaki, fig. 5.1; it may be the same as one pictured on pi. 3d, bottom, left (K 39); this is also missing.</page><page sequence="39">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINA TION K2.1 SI V K2.2 K2.3 K2.4 Fig. 2.11. Barracks, pottery from K 2 (K2.1-4). Scale 1:3. The pottery included a great deal of coarse and very little fine ware. Not catalogued was the top of a large, coarse stirrup jar (sampled as KAR 06/30). Three spools were found (plate 5 c).69 These are intact except for a chip on one, and were made of very coarse fabrics; their weights are 21, 75, and 60 g. Clearly the room was used for storage (the pithos, jar, stirrup jar, and amphora, possibly the askos), as well as cooking (the cooking dish and cooking jug), and other domestic activities (basins, pyxis, jugs, and lid). The function of the kalathoi is uncertain; elsewhere they were apparently multifunctional, used for offerings in shrines, and perhaps as lamps or braziers. There is no trace of burning on either of the two kalathoi from this room, nor is there anything else found here to suggest a religious function, unless the lid or plaque is the sort used in shrines. The three spools may have been used for weaving, but there were not enough to suggest the presence of a loom. 69 Mentioned in Karphi, 73.</page><page sequence="40">THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE SETTLEMENT Pottery Catalogue: K 270 Fine Wares K2.1 Pyxis (fig. 2.11).

LM IIIC. 70 There was a problem in identifying correctly the material from this room because of the numbering system, which clearly changed early in the 1938 season. Many of the fragments are labelled' K 2', using Arabic numbers. Others are numbered' K II', using Roman numerals. Most often the Roman numeral II has bars across the top and bottom, but occasionally the bars are lacking. It may be that those vessels without the bar came from K 11, rather than K 2. Where Seiradaki's publication provides a check, the questionable pieces are listed as being from K 11. 71 Found with it were fragments of at least two other cooking dishes of different fabrics, one with more schist, the other with only phyllites.</page><page sequence="41">THE POTTER Y FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINA TION Fig. 2.12.

Scale 1:3.</page><page sequence="43">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION Room K 3 This large room was plain and denuded, but had some roofing material. A bench lay at the east end against the bedrock. Of the published pottery said to come from this room, two pieces were not located: a jug72 and a lid.73 The notebook records pithoi (as from K 2), typical rounded pithos rims, ten kalathoi, jugs or jars with wide necks, and very large coarse-ware stirrup jars; the false spout of one of these stirrup jars is preserved, but was not catalogued (Sampled KAR 06/29). Another false spout of a smaller stirrup jar was also found, along with a pithos or pithoid jar with strokes and circles on a raised ridge at the bottom of the neck. The objects recorded from the room included a bronze needle (207), a circular stone bead (616), and a cylindrical terracotta spindle whorl (206). There was a good deal of fine ware, including many deep bowls or cups (K3.1-3), a kylix (K3.4), a pyxis (K3.5), two jugs (K3.7-8), and a small amphora (K3.6). All the pottery was ordinary domestic serving and dining equipment. The coarse wares suggest that the inhabitants used the room for storage (the pithoi, jar, and coarse stirrup jars), cooking (cooking dish), and other domestic uses. The ten kalathoi, however, are highly unusual and constitute the largest number found in a single room. Other rooms on the site that produced large numbers were K 58 (8), K 26 (8), K 28 (7), K 80 (7), K 114 (6), most identified as either cult rooms themselves (K 58) or adjacent to cult areas (K 26, K 28, K 80). As with K 114, however, here is no ritual association in K 3. Both of the preserved kalathoi (K3.10-11) show burning on the interior, so at least these two held burning material, perhaps used as lamps or braziers; if they were offering bowls, they held burning material. It is presumed that the nearly complete vessels represent what was in use in the room at the time the site was abandoned. The fragments of deep bowls or cups (K3.2-3) are possibly earlier, and indeed the decoration of strokes on K3.2 looks early.74 The kylix (K3.4) is similar to large examples from the later part of LM IIIC at Kavousi-VrondaJ5 The narrow-necked jug (K3.8) is a most unusual shape; it was manufactured like the stirrup jars by throwing the neck separately and adding it to the body with a ridge of clay to strengthen the join. It may be an adaptation of FS 120, which was popular on the mainland through LHIIIB1,76 but has not been recognised on Crete. Pottery Catalogue: K 3 Fine Wares K3.1 Deep bowl (FIG. 2.13). Max. pres.

Room K 4 This room was thought to be an open courtyard because of its large size and lack of roofing material. It may have had a long bench at the north end. The notebook mentions the following coarse ware: pithos fragments, tripod bowls, a pyxis, a jug handle, and flat dishes. The recorded fine ware (as in K 2 and K 3) included a spouted saucer, a stirrup jar, and pedestal bases. Only one fragment was found from K 4, a deep bowl with a spiral, and it was too fragmentary to be catalogued. Objects included a human figurine fragment (208) and two terracotta spools. Room K 5 This was a separate small square building, which the excavators interpreted as a watchtower. They reported few traces of roofing and had difficulty determining the entrances.77 The notebook records pithoi, pithoid jars, tripod bowls, flat dishes, pedestal bases, a tripod bowl with an angular profile, and small pieces of fine pottery. No pottery was saved from the room. Objects included a conical stone bead or whorl (263). Room K 6 This was another simple room. The excavators suggest that two large flat slabs found against the south wall may have formed a bench.78 As in other rooms, there were good traces of roofing. The notebook added that the earth was very carbonised. The pottery is reported to have contained a larger proportion of fine ware than usual. The notebook mentions pithos fragments, flat dishes with flared sides and wavy edges, fine bowls with all sorts of bases (flat, low, ring, pedestal), a jug or large bottle, a krater, and tumbler bases. Pottery preserved in the boxes included a large, coarse, elliptical handle with two ridges and a leg or handle decorated with five round finger impressions. Objects from the room included fragments of a stone cup (209),79 a conical stone bead or whorl (264), a cylindrical terracotta spindle whorl (652), and a terracotta spool. Room K 7 This was another simple room with no distinguishing features and no visible entrance, although one is visible in the east wall on the plan. There was little pottery. In addition to the catalogued vessels, the following pottery was found in the Karphi boxes: the rim of a possible kylix, a stirrup jar or jug fragment, fragments from a deep bowl in blue ware, and a round vertical handle also in blue ware. A pierced schist palette (615)80 was also found. The extant pottery suggests simple functions of storage (pithos, jar), cooking (tripod bowl), and drinking. The kylix is of the large variety with small foot that might have been used in drinking rituals.81 The tripod bowl is probably a round-bottomed tripod cooking pot, similar to others on the site; this shape may originally have been imported into Crete from the mainland.82 Karphi, 73.

Street outside K 2-7 The notebook records pottery from an area outside K 2-7, perhaps the road shown to the east of the building complex. Included were pithos sherds with rope patterns, tripod legs, dishes with flared sides, tripod bowls, a scuttle with a grooved and wavy rim and stick handle (K2-7.1), a fragment of bowl in thin blue ware with orange red slip, a large bowl in fine buff clay, and small buff and cream-colored bowls. A huge jug or amphora handle in one of the boxes is labelled as coming from here. The pottery shows little similarity to assemblages found in other areas identified as streets, which generally consist of large quantities of small fragments of fine ware, mostly from deep bowls or cups and kraters (see below). Pottery Catalogue: K 2-7 (Street) Coarse Wares K2-7.1 Scuttle (FIG. 2.15). Max. pres. H. 7.1. Single fragment from rim, preserving handle attachment and beginning of handle. Coarse reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) fabric with frequent grey phyllites (up to 6 mm), some red phyllites (2-3 mm), and hard black and white inclusions (1 mm and less). No traces of burning inside or out. Incisions on interior of rim. LM IIIC. Room K 134 This area, a kind of rock chamber, was considered an outside space, in which the publication records that nothing was found 'of any importance'.83 It was thought to belong more with the Barracks than the Eastern Block. The statement about the lack of finds is surpri sing, given the amount of interesting fine decorated wares marked as coming from the space. The pottery mentioned in the notebook included many sherds from a pithos with a chevron pattern, a large coarse stirrup jar of Type 5, a base with incised lines, at least two fine stirrup jars (K134.3-4), two fine one-handled jugs (K134.5), some fine cups, and pyxides (K134.1). Uncatalogued pottery from the room included a burned base or stopper, a krater with a dotted curvilinear design, a jug or stirrup jar base with bands, and a small coarse jug base. Objects from the room included a terracotta spindle whorl cut from a kylix stem and a fragment of a bone handle (678). While there was not a great deal of pottery here, the same function of storage (pithos, large stirrup jar) appears as in most of the buildings. There was no pottery clearly related to cooking. Perhaps the space was used for storage, both for goods and for pottery. The two octopus stirrup jars are unusual, and they are both badly burned. Possibly they were damaged and discarded in this space. The stirrup jars find their closest parallels with the octopus stirrup jar K150.3. The pyxis (K134.1) has decoration similar to a LM IIIC krater from Sybrita/Thronos, while the splatters on the interior can be compared to a pyxis from Kastri;84 at Karphi there is a good deal of similarity between the decorative schemes on these two large shapes. The stirrup jars and the pyxis look earlier than some of the material found on the floors, perhaps early LM IIIC. Pottery Catalogue: K134 Fine Wares K134.1 Pyxis (PLATE 6 a, FIG. 2.16).

Room K 145 This space was not really a room, but only a short passage leading to Room K 134. Again, the excavators reported nothing of importance found here. The notebook confirms that the pottery was scanty. Nothing is preserved that can be attributed to this area. THE ROAD HOUSE Room K 146 This large building lay to the southeast of the Barracks and northeast of the Southeast Quarter. It was badly destroyed; only the eastern long side and small sections of the north and south walls were preserved. It was entered from one of the long sides. There are no recorded finds in the publication or notebook. The notebook suggests that this area was called MK 2. If so, then a burned stopper or lid preserved in one of the boxes came from here. THE SOUTHEAST BLOCK (ROOMS K 130 K 133) In the notebook this group of four rooms was originally called the Southern Barracks.85 It consisted of at least two separate buildings: House K 130-131 and House K 132-133. The excavators originally thought that some stratigraphy was preserved but the stones in regular order above a black layer turned out to be a chance fall of stones above roofing. Although neither the publication nor the notebook says so, it would seem that these rooms were all roofed. House K 130-131 House K 130-131 was a simple two-room structure entered from the west into K 130. A doorway led from K 130 into a back room K 131; the doorways were not on axis, and the door into K 131 was not aligned with the entrance into the building, providing privacy for this back room. Room K 130 This nearly square room had a platform in the corner. It was entered in the northwest. The pottery was unusual only because there were few pithos sherds. The notebook lists only one pithoid jar, but says that there were at least three examples of each coarse shape. There were one or more buff stirrup jars of 'porridge' ware. Fine pottery came mostly from bowls of Types 1-3, but there were some krater sherds, two kylix bases and the spout of a duck vase. Found in the boxes were also a fragment of a possible bird vase and a pithos base decorated with oblique slashes. Only a spindle whorl cut from a kylix stem was found in the room. There is nothing found in the room to indicate any special functions, nor can the single catalogued krater give a close date. Pottery Catalogue: K130 Medium-Coarse Wares K130.1 Krater (FIG. 2.17).

Its north side was bedrock. According to the publication, the pottery included more fine wares than usual, most probably from a large decorated krater (K131.4). A strainer top is also mentioned. The notebook lists the following pottery: sherds from at least two pithoi of Types 8 and 11, kalathoi of Types 1 and 2, and a large stirrup jar of Type 6; the rest was too fragmentary to distinguish types. The only object from the room was a conical stone bead or whorl (618). The catalogued pottery from this room represents vessels used for drinking and serving of food and drink: a large and elaborately decorated krater (K131.4) and two or three kylikes (K131.1-3), two of them very large. One of the kylikes catalogued here was labelled K 131/138 and may come from either this complex (a mistake for K 131/133) or from the Eastern Quarter (a mistake for K 137/138); no mention is made of kylikes in either group of rooms, although two kylikes were mentioned from K 130. Since neither combination seems more likely than the other, the vessel has been catalogued here. It is possible that this equipment was used for elite drinking rituals such as may have gone on in some of the larger houses at Karphi and at the Big House at Kavousi-Fra«c/a.86 The vessels all look late LM IIIC; there is nothing particularly early. The elaborate fringed and scalloped motifs of one kylix and the exotic animals on the krater look late, but these vessels are not among the latest pottery at Karphi. The krater, in particular, is highly unusual, and surely of local inspiration. It is unfortunate that its surfaces are so poorly preserved that one cannot make out the motifs with certainty. It looks as if there are two animals, possibly mythological animals, on either side of a central motif that may be horns of consecration. The figures have the clawed feet of lions, but their bodies look more like those of horses. One is clearly male. Either they have elaborate headdresses, or their mouths/ beaks are open with trees or plants growing out of them. It is possible that these are griffins, but they may also be fanciful representations of real animals. The other side is also panelled, but the motifs could not be determined. There are good parallels for the subsidiary decoration of this piece; the running spiral occurs on a terracotta window frame from Kavousi-FrorcJa.87 The deep rounded shape is common in LM IIIC.88 Pottery Catalogue: K131 Fine Wares K131.1 Kylix (FIG. 2.17).

House K 132-133 This two-room house is entered from the south into K 133. There are traces of a kalderimi, or paved road, to the south of the building. The contents of the rooms suggest ordinary domestic functions. There was a rather large amount of misfired pottery (blue ware). Room K 133 This small room was thought of as an entrance hall to K 132. It had a bench along its north wall. No pottery is extant.

Room K 132 The larger room of the house was entered down two steps from K 133. There was a bench along the north side of the room. The notebook lists the following coarse vessels: at least four pithoi, two of Type 1, one each of Types 3 and 11; a pithoid jar of Type 8; a tripod of Type 2; three dishes of Type 6, with holes; and a large blue stirrup jar of Type 2. In addition to the catalogued fine pottery, there were also two stirrup jars of Type 2, one with a hole in the false spout. Objects from the room included a stone lid (621),90 a conical stone bead or whorl (622), and a whetstone (623). There is little from this room to suggest date, and the pottery indicates an ordinary domestic function. The deep bowl of blue ware has the rather high raised and concave foot that is found on late LM IIIC vessels. The ring base of the small krater also may be a late feature.

Since many large stones were left in situ at the end of that season, the building was also cleaned in subsequent seasons (especially 193 8).1 Although several rooms comprise the temple complex, the entire area was labelled K 1. In his 1987 study of the Temple,2 Rutkowski provided designations for the various rooms in the complex which will be used here (FIG. 1.1): K 1 for the large room, K Id for the bench along the south wall, K 1 g for the small room entered from K 1 by a staircase, K If for the room to the northwest with Goddess 1, and K lh for the small compartment to the southwest which had a burned red clay floor and produced many vessels of 'blue ware'. To the east, beyond the entrance to K 1 was a large open area that Rutkowski identified as a public open courtyard (Kim). Aside from a few other objects whose precise locations were recorded on the plan in the notebook, the find spots of the pottery are uncertain. Some of the material may have accompanied the ritual objects in K 1 and K If, but other pieces may have been found in other compartments or rooms and may have only a tenuous connection to the ritual activities that went on in K 1. Room K 1 Room K 1 was a large, rectangular room at the very northernmost edge of the settlement. The excavators believed that it was an open courtyard, since they found no roofing debris within. In his later study of the Temple, Rutkowski suggested more plausibly, if without any definite evidence, that the room had been roofed.3 K 1 had an uneven floor of bedrock that was levelled with red clay, and a rectangular stone pier towards the north end one course high, was interpreted as an altar. The northern edge of the room and its north wall had fallen off the cliff before excavation began. The room was entered over a heavy threshold on the east. Another door, at the top of a staircase, led up from K 1 to compartment K lg and a second room, K If. Statues of goddesses with upraised arms were clearly recorded in the notebook as standing on the broad ledge on the south side of K 1 (K Id); the ledge had rubble fill underneath. Along the west wall was a shelf of stones approximately 0.80 m high, next to the steps that went up to K lg. Goddess 1, the largest of the terracotta figures, is recorded as having been found standing on a bench that ran along the east side of K If. The compartment in the southwest corner (K lh) contained the blue ware vessels and most of the other whole pots, according to the notebook; its floor was described as of red mud, but the 1937 drawing in the notebook calls it burnt earth. From the description in the publication and notebook, it would appear that much of the ritual equipment was left standing when the settlement was abandoned. The other whole vessels from K lh, including the blue ware vases, may have been in storage, and at any rate had little or nothing to do with the display and deployment of the ritual equipment in the cult centre itself. In addition to the ritual equipment, much of which is on display in the Herakleion Museum, there were a number of boxes in the storerooms containing material from the Temple; nothing was discarded in 1937. One box was labelled 'K 1 Cleaning', while two others simply said 'Karphi I'. One further box had a label that read 'Karphi: Dump and Outside Shrine', but neither the notebook nor the publication gives any specific information about where this material comes from; there may have been a dump uncovered in proximity to the Temple,4 or this box held material that came from the excavation dump from 1937 and was recovered in subsequent seasons. Other Karphi boxes contained ritual equipment (plaques in one box, snake tube fragments in another, goddess fragments and other religious material in yet another box), but none of it is certainly from the 1 Karphi, 75-6. 2 Rutkowski 1987, 268, fig. 3. 3 Rutkowski 1987, 261. 4 The inventory book does list 'Karphi 1 dump' as a find spot, and the entries seem to belong to the 1938 season, based on the handwriting and the fact that these objects are recorded after objects from Ta Mnemata 8, which was dug in 193 8; they may have been excavated in 1937, however, and not inventoried until 1938. The material is most likely to have come from the Temple, possibly from the dump of the 1937 season.</page><page sequence="55">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION Temple, and much of it can be assigned to other religious buildings on the site. The publication described the pottery from K 1 as usual, both fine and coarse.5 The notebook gives little more information, adding only that there were many cult objects and statues, flat anthropomorphic plaques, some coarse wares, including large stirrup jars, pithoi with rope designs, and blue wares. The date given for all this material in the notebook is Protogeometric. The small dish published by Seiradaki with other material from the Temple could not be located.6 Five goddess statues from the Temple were reconstructed and have been published: Goddess 1 (HM 11042),7 Goddess 2 (HM 11043),8 and three more unnumbered Goddesses (HM 11041,9 HM 11045,10 and HM 11044).11A terracotta plaque with a face in relief was also found (HM 10872).12 Other objects from the Temple include the following: a MM II button-shaped seal with rosette motif (409),13 a disc shaped limestone spindle whorl (110),14 three conical stone beads or whorls (201,274,657), four to six limestone pounders (111-114), an obsidian fragment (205, from outside to the east), a globular terracotta bead (115), a cylindrical terracotta spindle whorl (202, from the dump), two cowrie shells (203, 204, from the dump), and a triton shell (369, from Karphi 1 cleaning). In addition to the vessels catalogued below, the four boxes labelled as coming from the Temple, or K 1 produced a great deal of material, and although not catalogued, some of it is listed below.15 Four goddess faces came from the box labelled 'K1 cleaning'. The first fragment (plate 6 e), preserving the top part of face and the eyes, was made of a very pale brown (10YR 8/4) fabric, with small dark grey inclusions.16 The eyes are unusual because they are deeply incised, rather than moulded. The second fragment from the lower face (plate 6/top) preserved a rather pointed chin and smiling small mouth; it was made of a coarse red (2.5YR 5/6) fabric with large red and grey schist inclusions (2-3 mm).17 The third fragment (PLATE 6/ bottom) preserved the nose, mouth, chin, and one cheek; it was made of a soft reddish yellow (5YR 6/8) fabric with schist inclusions.18 The fourth fragment came from a large face (plate 6 g), and only the mouth, cheek, and chin were preserved. It was made of a coarse red (2.5YR 5/8) fabric with schist inclusions (1-2 mm). The head was made unusually in two layers; a clay cylinder formed the basis, and on top of that was a second layer with the moulded face. Attributes from the crowns or headdresses of the statues were also found: a small bird with outstretched wings, another small bird on a pedestal with folded wings, and a dove offering (PLATE 7 a). Fragments of other ritual objects included arms, a flat plaque with no raised edge, the breast of a goddess, and a goddess in very pale brown clay with knobs (breasts?) and possibly snakes.19 Pottery included an amphora neck, fragments of blue ware, and a few decorated fragments. From the box labelled 'Karphi 1' came fragments of a fine snake tube in very pale brown fabric (sampled KAR 06/45), the heads of two animal figurines (one bovine, one possibly equine) (PLATE 7 b),20 a fragment of a fine ware goddess in buff fabric, 41 arm or hand fragments, a fragment of a thin (Th. 1.8) plaque with a wide flat edge of fine pale fabric with very pale brown (10 YR 8/4) slip, and a fragment of another plaque with a narrow flat edge of coarse red (10R 5/6) fabric with frequent large schist inclusions. Pottery included several painted fine body sherds, a cooking tray, a kalathos with a horn on the rim, a coarse rhyton base (?), and a scuttle handle ending in a bird's head. The second box labelled 'Karphi I' produced the following: a scuttle handle, a possible hut urn doorway (or a coarse fenestrated stand), a fine flat tripod leg or section of fenestrated stand the skirt of an incense burner with burning only on one side of the interior ridge, fragments possibly from two small chalices, and a great number of coarse body fragments The box labelled 'Karphi: dump and outside shrine' produced fragments of the following ritual objects: the skirt and base of a goddess (sampled KAR 06/10); snake tubes; goddess arms, including one elbow; the heads of several goddesses with different hair treatments, including plain applied bands, bands with finger impressions, and several types of chevron bands; a goddess face preserving nose and chin; several ears, noses, breasts from goddesses; and attributes from crowns or headdresses of goddesses, including a poppy, three incised cones, one of which looks like snail shell, two palettes, and the top of a crown with discs (plate 7 c). Pottery included twisted handles from a jug or amphora. If all this material does come from the Temple, then it provides more information about the ritual equipment used in this building than has been published.

An estimate of 10-15 statues would not seem unreasonable, and there are parallels for such a large number at Kavousi Vronda, where as many as 30 statues may be represented.22 Two cylindrical stands were catalogued and there were also fragments in the boxes of at least ten others (sampled KAR 06/11-12, KAR 06/31-32, KAR 06/46-52); one had a snake crawling through the handle.23 Fragments of at least three plaques appeared, in addition to the published one with the head. It is surprising that there were few kalathoi, as large numbers of kalathoi were found in the Vronda and Khalasmenos shrines. Several chalices, scuttles, an incense burner, and some animal figurines make up the remainder of the assemblage, and all are known from other shrines of goddesses with upraised arms. Chalices are unusual in LM IIIC shrines, but found at Kavousi-Frowt/a and possibly Gazi.24 The pottery presents an unusual assemblage for a shrine. The blue ware deep bowls look late in terms of shape and whatever decoration is preserved. The feet of all the vessels are particularly suggestive of a late date, as they are all high raised concave bases that approach the later conical feet of SM and PG date. The coarse cup (K1.8), lid (K1.12), basins (K1.10 11), and stirrup jar (K1.13) all resemble examples from elsewhere on the site, as do the cooking wares. Basin Kl.ll is similar to one from Kastri, though not as shallow.25 Basin K1.10 is closer to a basin than a kalathos, as Seiradaki characterised it; it is a unique shape for this period. The lid (K1.12) finds parallels at Kastri.26 The tripod K1.21 with triple handles, originally published as a jar, is a shape otherwise unattested at Karphi and finds no good parallels. The cooking dish (K1.16) is of a type common on other LM IIIC sites and is one of the best examples preserved of this very common shape.27 Although the vessels may have been in storage and not displayed or used, the pottery suggests activities that occurred in the temple.28 It would be interesting to know if the cooking vessels were actually in the cult rooms themselves and were used in a ritual setting, or whether they were found in K lh or outside and were not necessarily part of the ritual equipment. They may have been used for ritual meals for the community or for preparation of meals for a smaller group of religious or political figures. Likewise, it would be useful to know if the blue ware vessels were employed in the ritual setting, or if their deposition in K lh was chance. Blue ware vessels are found widely scattered over the site, and although they do appear in other ritual contexts (for example in K106 and K 116) they are not exclusively associated with religious areas. This particular group may have been the result of a misfiring in a kiln, perhaps intended for religious purposes, and deliberately buried in K lh. On the other hand, a kiln may have stood in the vicinity, and this material may represent wasters from it; certainly the contemporary kiln at Kavousi-Vronda was quite close to the Shrine.29 These vessels may also have been used despite the warping, either for aesthetic reasons or because they had been specially fired for the Temple.

Rutkowski reconstructed the area south of K 1 as an open space (K 41) reached from street K 72 (including the portion under K 70), with storage sheds on either side (K 40 and K 19-20).31 K 38 and K 39 were apparently open spaces; they are also in close proximity to K 15-18 and at a level lower than the Temple, and they may just as easily have belonged with that complex as the Temple. Room K 19 This large room just south of the Temple was said to be open to sky, suggesting that no roofing material was found in it. K 19 and K 20 are on nearly the same level as the Temple. The notebook lists the following pottery from this area: a few plain pithos sherds; sherds from a pithoid jar in light clay with traces of dark paint; part of a large jug or jar in similar ware; rims of at least three tripods and tripod legs; sherds from a large number of open dishes; trays, one with a horizontal handle at rim; a scuttle handle; and many sherds from rounded vessels with remains of a whitish slip on red clay. The fine ware was described as usual, but included 'rather more fineish pink ware than usual'. In addition to the catalogued pottery a fine stirrup jar fragment, a cooking dish with chevrons on a flat rim, and a tray with spit depressions on the rim were found in the boxes. There were no recorded objects from this room. The pottery is too scanty to suggest a function for this room, and there is nothing to indicate a date. A large proportion of fragments come from trays and dishes, as well as a cooking lid. The rosette pattern on the pithos (K19.5) is unusual, and there are no other examples preserved from the site.

The pottery was similar to that from K 19, and no pottery was represented in sufficient quantity to be mendable. The deep bowl published by Seiradaki as being from this room actually came from K 120, according to the number in ink on the fragment.32 The cooking dish finds a close parallel at Sybrita/Thronos.33 Pottery Catalogue: K 20 Coarse Wares K20.1 Cooking dish (FIG. 3.4).

Rim pulled inward to form spout. Thinner base, probably rounding out like wok. LM IIIC. Room K 40 This tiny compartment was one of several small 'closets' to the south and west of the Temple. The west end had collapsed over the cliff. The room is one of the few associated with the temple for which evidence of roofing existed. The notebook records the usual coarse pottery, including tripods, open dishes, pithoid jars, kalathoi, and stirrup jars. The fine ware was all in small, worn sherds. There is mention of a few fragments that may be from cult objects. The dish published by Seiradaki was not located.34 The boxes produced many fragments of deep bowls, including two rims (one with vertical strokes, one with a loop), three handles, and body fragments with a Minoan flower, spirals, curvilinear motifs, short strokes, and bands. A plain cooking tray was also found. Other objects from the room included a bronze shoemaker's awl (258),35 a haematite weight (256),36 two conical terracotta spindle whorls (257, 259), and a pierced plaque of mother-of-pearl (260).37 30 Karphi, 76. 31 Rutkowski 1987, 261-2 and fig. 7. 32 Seiradaki, pi. 10a top, second from right. 33 Prokopiou 1997, 376, fig. 17b. 34 Seiradaki, fig. 6.5. 35 Karphi, pi. 29.1. 36 Karphi, pi. 30.1. 37 Karphi, pi. 30.4.</page><page sequence="62">THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT 51 K19.1 J K19.2 K19.3 &gt; K20.1 c K19.4 K19.5 K40.1 K40.2 f K40.3 K40.5 K41.1 K41.2 JL K40-41.1 K40.4 P K40-41.2 Fig. 3.4.

The pieces may not represent what was in use in the room at the time the settlement was abandoned, but rather refuse in the floors or material fallen from farther upslope. The deep bowl base (K40.4), with its slightly concave raised shape, painted edge, and reserved disc does not look particularly late. K40.1, however, with its upright multiple loops, could be either early or late in LM IIIC; the motif is found on other deep bowls, like K147.1 and K79-89.2, and appears in early LM IIIC contexts at Khania, Kastri, and Knossos and late IIIC at Kavou si-Kastro.38 The motif of pendent triangle made up of scales, like that on K40.3, appears on LM IIIB deep bowl from Knossos.39 The non catalogued deep bowls have motifs that would fit into any phase of LM IIIC, but the whole deposit looks early rather than late.

Room K 41 The area labelled K 41 was probably an open court, as both Pendlebury and Rutkowski suggested.40 It was divided in two by a line of stones, and the north half was 0.40 higher than the south. That it was a significant area is indicated by the fact that the Temple Road led directly to it. The pottery was said to be similar to that from K 40. In addition to the catalogued pottery, a number of small fragments were found in the boxes from K 41. Deep bowls were the most plentiful and included two rims (one burned, one with a multiple curvilinear motif), three handles, and three body sherds (one with a possible whorl shell, one with a curvilinear motif, one with bands). A spout from a medium-coarse thelastron, the rim of a jug with a handle, a coarse jug of greenish fabric with a black band at the rim, and some blue ware body sherds were also found. Other objects from the area included a pear-shaped bone bead (262), a shell (321), and a fragment of a limestone weight (261). The pottery is too scanty to tell anything about the date or function of this area. A few fragments came from K 40-41 or outside K 40-41. From the latter context is a fragment of a snake tube (sampled KAR 06/19). A fragment of a stirrup jar of coarse greenish fabric with a curvilinear motif and bands is labelled K 40-49, but it was not catalogued.

Room K 38 Pendlebury originally recorded in the notebook that only K 38 was roofed, but in the publication he emended this idea and included K 39 among the roofed areas.41 Rutkowski suggested that both rooms were unroofed sheds.42 The excavators believed that the rooms were 38 Khania II, pi. 35.70-P 0755; Mook and Coulson 1997, 362, fig. 37.150 (Kavousi-.Ka.srro, Phase III); Kastri, 287, fig. 8:o; 288, fig. 9m; Warren 2007, 342, fig. 7.P183 (Knossos). 39 Popham 19706, pi. 47e. 40 Karphi, 76; Rutkowski 1987, 261-2. 41 Karphi, 76. 42 Rutkowski 1987, 262.</page><page sequence="64">THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT 53 entered by ladder from K 20, but it is also possible that they were part of the Great House Shrine or represent another complex entirely. The floors are closer in level to those in K 16-17 than those of the Temple, to judge from the site section. The pottery was as usual, but without any pithos fragments, and the notebook adds that a miniature tumbler fragment was found. Fragments from this room that were not catalogued include deep bowl sherds (one burned rim with a spiral, one rim with a tailed spiral, and three body fragments with vertical lines, a curvilinear motif, and a rayed design), a krater fragment with banded decoration, a coarse jug or jar with a yellow slip and black paint, a flat piece with plastic decoration (part of a plaque?), and part of the face of a goddess statue. Two vessels published by Seiradaki as from this room were not located: a kalathos43 and a deep bowl fragment with a zigzag decoration;44 the kalathos in Seiradaki's drawing resembles one identified on the label as from K 28, and the number may have been misread at the time of the publication. Other objects from the room included a bronze hook (306),45 two bronze rings (307, 308),46 a chip of obsidian (309), a cylindrical terracotta spindle whorl (310), and a shell (311). The pottery is mostly fragmentary; the single exception is K38.1, which is an unusual piece. It is shallower than usual and has a slightly more flaring rim. The reserved disc on the interior and the rather low and wide foot would seem to place this example early in LM IIIC; deep bowls of similar shape can be found at Knossos in LM IIIB.47 The decoration, however, finds a close match at Phaistos of LM IIIB— C date, as well as at Knossos and Kommos.48 Of the sherds, the decoration of K38.2 has parallels at Kastri, Phaistos, Knossos, and Khamalevri, suggesting a date in early LM IIIC.49 K38.4 is similar to a deep bowl from Khamalevri of Phase I.50 The stirrup jar (K38.6) has parallels at Mouliana and Kritsa and may be slightly later in LM IIIC.51 The sherd material, then would appear to belong to the early part of the LM IIIC period. It is possible that the rubbish dump that underlay K 16-17 also went under part of K 38 and K 39. The fragment of a goddess may belong in the room, or it may have come from the dump underneath.

The basin fragment published by Seiradaki was not catalogued.53 Also found in the boxes were handle and body fragments with bands from deep bowls and a jug or stirrup jar handle. Other objects from the room included two pierced schist discs (272, 273),54 a bone handle for a knife (312), and a conical terracotta spindle whorl (271). The pottery is fragmentary and thus probably does not represent what was in use at the end of the room's history. The single exception is the small juglet, which is highly unusual and which looks later than the rest of the deposit. Taken out of context, the juglet might appear to be Late Geometric to Early Orientalising in date, but the shape appears earlier on Crete, long before it enjoys popularity in the later periods.55 On the mainland, the small juglet begins in LH IIIC.56 Pottery Catalogue: K 39 Fine Wares K39.1 Deep bowl (FIG. 3.5).

THE GREAT HOUSE (ROOMS K 8, K 9, K 11-K 18) The excavators thought that one building (Rooms 8-9, 11-18) stood out as superior to the others, and for this reason they labelled it the 'Great House', and suggested it as the ruler's dwelling.57 Although Rooms 15-18 were assigned to this complex, their connection with the other rooms of the Great House has been called into question, and they have been considered a separate unit.58 Wallace's restudy of the architecture shows that, although there is no clear connection between the two groups of rooms (8-14 and 15-18), a good deal of care was taken to build the rooms on the same alignment.59 The large threshold block between Rooms 15 and 16 17 was encroached upon by the north wall of Room 14, so it would seem that there was some collaboration in or acceptance of its construction.60 The two groups of rooms are here treated as separate structures; Rooms K 8-9 and K 11-14 are taken as an elite dwelling, the Great House, while Rooms K 15-18 are treated independently, as the Great House Shrine. Much care was taken in the construction of the walls of the Great House. In addition, the finds from the building suggest its elite function; it produced unusual luxury objects, not as many as found in some other houses, but showing a greater variety. Subsequent scholars, however, have questioned the identification of the building as a ruler's dwelling. Both Nowicki61 and Mazarakis Ainian62 suggested that the Great House is only one of several elite dwellings, and that the megarons of the Eastern Quarter and the Priest's House have an equal claim to the title of ruler's dwelling. The combination of the size of the building, its unusual architectural refinements, and the variety of objects 52 Karphi, 76. 53 Seiradaki, fig. 5.5. 54 Karphi, pi. 30.4. 55 Coldstream and Catling 1996, 356 say the shape begins well back in Protogeometric, although this example looks more elegant in shape. 56 Mountjoy 1986, 143, fig. 177 from Perati, LH IIIC early. 57 Karphi, 77-8. 58 Hayden 1981, 151; Gesell 1985, 79-81. 59 Wallace 2005, 233. 60 Wallace 2005, 237. 61 Nowicki 1999, 148-9. 62 Mazarakis Ainian 1997, 219-20, 304.</page><page sequence="67">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION found within it seems to indicate that the building was the dwelling of an elite individual or group, and the many kylikes suggests that drinking rituals may have gone on in the building.63 The Great House Shrine (Rooms K 15-18) contained ritual equipment, including fragments of goddess statues and snake tubes, and may have served a religious function, although some of this ritual material may have come from a rubbish dump underneath the area.64 If Rooms 15-18 were part of a religious building, the proximity of the elite Great House suggests that the inhabitants may have been prominent in the religious life of the community, or even have been asserting control over religious matters. The location may, how ever, be a matter of chance. The Great House Shrine is not without problems of interpretation, and its role as a religious building in the later stages of the settlement's history is not clear. Some of the material found in these rooms may in fact have come from a rubbish dump under K 16 and K 17, one that also extended under K12 and K13. A fragment of a plaque was definitely found below the floor in K 17, and additional ritual equipment came from other areas which may have been built over the dump. From K 70, which may have been a cellar storeroom for K 15-17, came the arm, hand, and skirt of a goddess, along with a plaque and snake tube, but it is unclear if these came from the dump below or were being stored in the room at the time the building went out of use. Other fragments of cult equipment were found nearby: part of a goddess face, a plaque and a kalathos from K 38 (a space contiguous with K 16), and the corner of a plaque and a goddess fragment from K 72 (to the north and west of the Great House Shrine). In addition, the pottery from K 16-17 showed later disturbance, possibly in the Hellenistic Period. The Great House: K 8-9, K 11-14 The Great House was so called because of its size and certain refinements noticed by the excavators: the building is in the most sheltered position on the site, is the largest building of the period, and is most elaborate in terms of arrangement. In addition, the walls employed fine cut blocks of limestone, with especially elaborate doorjambs.65 At least three phases of construction were defined: Room K 9 was built first, then K 11 and K 14 were added on, and finally, Rooms K 8 (an anteroom) and K 12-13 (basement storerooms); Wallace's investigations confirmed this sequence.66 Room K 8 This small room was an entranceway with fine doorjambs. The entrance from outside is on axis, as is the door into K 9. The notebook mentions a ledge or bench to the right of the door leading into K 9. The notebook lists the following coarse wares: pithoi, flat dishes, a large red jug, tripod legs, the mouth of a stirrup jar, and a kylix stem. The fine ware included some small buff carinated bowls and a handle of fine blue ware. In addition to the two catalogued vessels, the boxes yielded a large tripod leg with a slash and two dints, probably one of the tripod legs mentioned in the notebook. The pottery found in the room suggests some storage and possibly cooking. The pyxis is difficult to date, and we do not know what vessels of this shape were used for, except the obvious one of storage for small items. The decoration suggests that it was made in early LMIIIC, and the interior splatters, which find parallels at Kastri, also point to that date.67 Pottery Catalogue: K 8 Medium-Coarse Wares K8.1 Pyxis (fig. 3.6).

LM IIIC. Room K 9 Originally the only room in the building, this large rectangular room was interpreted as another megaron.68 It had a good door with a raised stone threshold. At the west end was a square column base, and a depression marked the place of a matching column on the east. Carbonised cross-beams were preserved from the ceiling, and the beams were approximately 15 cm square and 1.25 cm apart. There was ajar stand in the northwest corner. The west wall cut through the room and was not bonded with the other walls.

Scale 1:3.</page><page sequence="69">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION provides an idealised section of the stratigraphy in the room. At the bottom was a floor of yellow clay (&lt;dhomatokhoma), varying in depth from 6-10 cm, with the beams resting on it. Over this was a layer of red clayey earth, with another 6 cm layer of yellow roofing material above. According to the notebook the pottery included many pithoi with projecting bases, one with an angular rim; a black-glazed pithoid jar with grooves around the body and an unusual squared rim; large buff kylikes, one with a hollow stem that shows spiral ridges of pulled clay inside (K9.2), and one scored to help attachment of bowl; tripod bowls; flat dishes with low straight sides (i.e. trays) or higher flared sides (i.e. dishes); handles and shoulder fragments of jugs; and pedestal bases. Fine ware included a carinated kylix rim with diagonal lines of paint (K9.3) and a tubular side spout. In addition to the catalogued pottery, the boxes produced the following fragments: two deep bowls with spiral or vertical strokes and bands, another kylix fragment with vertical strokes on the rim, a stirrup jar fragment with bands, a vertical handle with punctuated decoration in a vertical chevron pattern (this may come from K 7, but the writing is not clear), a horizontal basket handle, a small cylindrical vessel, a square flat vessel, and a fine tile fragment. Objects from K 9 included fragments of a bronze ring (367), a terracotta figurine (275),69 a cylindrical terracotta spindle whorl (276), and oyster shells (365, 366). The pottery is not unusual, but it includes a larger number of kylikes than usual, and these are of the large variety that may have been used in elite competitive drinking rituals.70 The rest of the material seems like an ordinary domestic assemblage. If this building was the house of an elite group or individual, and Room 9 is the largest in the building, the amount of available space given over to storage seems unusual. The notebook, while not providing actual numbers of pithoi, indicates that there were many, and one large example is preserved (K9.ll). Nowicki suggested that when K 8 was added on, it replaced K 9 as the hearth room, allowing for more temporary storage in K 9.71 As in other LM IIIC sites, however, storage at Karphi was not limited to the storerooms, and the rooms of the buildings were multi-functional.72 The black-glazed pithoid jar mentioned in the notebooks suggests a later disturbance or occupation of the area of the Great House in later periods, perhaps the Hellenistic Period, as with K 16-17.

Room K 11 This small room was added on to Room K 9, possibly at the same time as K 14. The notebook records the following pottery: pithoi and pithoid jars, dishes, jugs, and tripods, a fragment of a shoulder with a double groove, and a fine miniature tumbler, perhaps the tiny base preserved in one of the boxes. Two small krater fragments, one with loops and an S-pattern, were found in one of the boxes, but were not catalogued. The lid pictured in Seiradaki was missing.73 Objects were few: a fragment of yellow sandstone with a carved ridge (211), one cylindrical (277) and one biconical (212) terracotta spindle whorl, and a lead ferrule (372) were all that was found. Of the pottery, most of the fine deep bowls or cups and kylikes are in small fragments and may represent earlier material discarded in the floor. The quirk pattern on Kll.l certainly appears early at the site. The hatched circle of K11.2 finds parallels in Khania.74 The decoration on the kylix also resembles that on a similar vessel from Khania.75 The fragment of ajar or stirrup jar with wavy line (Kll.ll) is also probably an earlier piece; similar fragments abound on the site, often in dumps of earlier material.76 The two jugs (Kll.4-5) are nearly complete and were probably part of the floor deposit. They are rather similar in shape, although K11.5 is less globular and has a wider mouth; it may have a moustache or scroll design on the shoulder. Parallels for K11.4 can be found in LH IIIC on the mainland.77 The jar and two cooking jugs also were probably on the floor. The jar has the knobbed decoration that was so popular at Karphi. The cooking jugs tell us little except that cooking may have been a function of the room. Pottery Catalogue: K11 Fine Wares Kll.l Deep bowl or cup (FIG. 3.8). D. rim est. 8. Single fragment from rim.

Scale 1:3.</page><page sequence="73">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION Room K 12 This room was thought to be a cellar, only reached from the roof above by a trap door, as there were no doors into the room. Benches lay on the north and east. The room was constructed over the rubbish dump, which continued also under K 13 and K 17; the same rubbish dump may have run under K 70 and K 72. Although the material from the dump was not stratigraphically distinguished from that on or above the floors, the excavators did keep the sherds separate, and this material was found in different compartments of one of the boxes. There were two groups, one labelled 'above the floor', the other 'below the level of the walls to 0.70'. These probably correspond to the levels mentioned in the notebook as 'above 1.70' and 'below 1.70', and an accompanying sketch of the stratigraphy in the notebook supports this idea. From the level of the bottom of the outer walls, a deposit of finer sherds and bones was shown above bedrock; this no doubt represented the pottery dump, while above this level coarse sherds were reported. Some pottery was simply labelled K 12, and it is assumed that this material came from the deposit on or above the floor of the room. In addition to the catalogued vessels, there were a few others, including a deep bowl with spiral or multiple loops, a krater with curved strokes and outlined curvilinear motif, a basin rim, a stirrup jar with a spiral, the false spout of a stirrup jar (sampled KAR 06/27), and a tripod leg decorated with a dint. The material is scrappy, and did not include many whole vessels. Most of the pottery is not closely diagnostic, although it is nearly all LM IIIC. The cup or deep bowl (K12.2) may be a fragment of a wavy band cup of SM date, like those at Knossos and Sybrita/ Thronos.78 It may also be an import, because of the banded rather than the usual monochrome interior; similar interior bands in pairs near rim and lower occur on mainland examples.79 An unusual piece is the jar (K12.8) of micaceous fabric with ridges on the neck. Although not much of this vessel is preserved it looks very different from the rest of the Karphi material, both in fabric and in its incised decoration. Such jars do exist in the PG period on Crete, but they also occur in the Geometric and Archaic Periods.80 This example may be later; there is some evidence of late disturbance, possibly in the Hellenistic Period in this area (see also below under K 16). Objects listed as coming from this room, but without any additional information about which stratum, were the following bronze objects: a sickle (213),81 a dagger (214),82 a saw (215), a chisel (216),83 a nail (217), a needle (218), a fragment of decorated bronze (219), a fragment of a ring (222), and two other fragments (220). Also found were two fragments of lead (221), a globular glass bead (245), a biconical bead of faience (246), and a cylindrical terracotta spindle whorl (244). These objects may have come from the deposit above the floor, rather than the rubbish dump below. Pottery Catalogue: K12 Fine Wares K12.1 Cup (FIG. 3.9). Max. pres. H. 6; D. rim 7.

K 12, Lower Deposit The notebook calls this deposit 'below 1.70', and the tag with the pottery reads 'below level of walls to 0.70'. The deposit included more fine ware than in the upper deposit, and the fragments were less burned. The notebook records pithoi of rounded type with projecting bases and plain bases, the usual type of jar, a tripod leg, two pedestal bases of small bowls and much pale buff pottery, including a large jar, and rims of small bowls. Uncatalogued fragments from this lower deposit included the following: a round cooking pot handle, body fragments of a greenish colour in a phyllite fabric, three medium-coarse body sherds with red bands, three rim fragments from deep bowls with rim bands, two deep bowl handles and one fragment with a handle attachment, five body fragments from deep bowls, two rims from kraters, one handle attachment from a krater, five krater body sherds with bands and one plain body sherd, a false spout of a stirrup jar, a flat base with bands, seven body fragments with bands, and two plain body fragments. Unfortunately, there is nothing particularly diagnostic for dating in the fragments from this lower deposit. The one base of K12.28, raised and slightly hollowed, looks early. The Minoan flower motif, which may appear on several fragments, seems to be popular in the early LM IIIC material, or at least it is found in other deposits, like this one, which have much fine early pottery, but small and broken pieces. The pendent loops that do not hang from the rim on K12.24 are reminiscent of those on deep bowls K32.3, K71.1, and K106.7-8.

Room K 13 K 13 was interpreted as another cellar, like K 12, reached by a ladder from above; it was connected to K 12 but lacked doorways from other rooms.86 Like K 12, this room also had a bench on the north side, as well as an outcrop of rock in the northwest corner. Also like K 12 and K 17, it was built over a rubbish dump. The notebook records the following pottery from this room: fragments from a few pithoi of the usual types, fragments of speckled green ware with red wash, kalathoi of common type, fragments of buff kraters, small bowls, and tripod legs. Little pottery was preserved well enough to be catalogued but the boxes produced a pithoid jar rim and a possible neck of a flask. One jar of Type 9 published by Seiradaki as from this room could not be located.87 The identification of the find spot may be an error, as the profile looks like the larnax rim from K 81-82.

The excavators suggested that it was constructed in the second phase of the building's use, along with K ll.88 It may have been entered from K 9 by ladder, as there were no doorways, only a window or hatch on the south wall that may have led up to K 14. The notebook lists the following pottery of coarse ware, mostly reddish in colour: pithos sherds with chevrons and vertically slashed rope patterns; pithoid jars; five tripods; open dishes, one with vertical sides and a horizontal handle at rim. There was a good deal of gritty buff ware mostly from jars with handle(s) starting from the rim, but also including a pyxis (K14.1) and a sherd from a circular lid with slashed rope design. A point of a steatite implement (223) and fragments of wood (224) also came from the room. The two nearly complete vessels from the room are a decorated pyxis (K14.1) with pleonastic decoration of the fringed style that includes horns of consecration, and a standard LMIIIC tripod (K14.2), with numerous parallels on Crete of LM IIIC date.89 Pottery Catalogue: K14 Fine Wares K14.1 Pyxis (PLATE 9 e-f, FIG. 3.11).

Great House, pottery from K 14 (K14.1-2) and Great House Shrine, pottery from K 16 (K16.12). Scale 1:3.</page><page sequence="79">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINA TION The Great House Shrine (K 15-18) There was no obvious connection between these rooms and those comprising the Great House, although they are oriented along the same lines. This was a building of a single large room (K 16-17) entered through a narrow corridor (K 15) with a trapezoidal room (K 18) to the north and east that has no connection with either K 16-17 or K 38-39. K 70 may have belonged with the building at some point. K 17 was built over the same rubbish tip that ran under K 12 and K 13, as well as under K 70 and K 72. A good deal of religious material was found in this vicinity, both inside K 16 and outside in K 70, K 72, and K 8-14-15. It would appear, then, that K 15-18 was a shrine, but it is not clear whether the religious material belonged to the later stages of the settlement or whether it represents a dump of material from an earlier shrine either on the site or brought from elsewhere. There seem to be three possibilities about this shrine in K 15-18. The first is that all the ritual material found throughout this area may have come from the dump underneath or tumbled down the slope from the Temple and have nothing to do with Rooms K 15-18. The second explanation is that this material came from a shrine in K 15-18. The third possibility is that a shrine in K 15-18 was built on top of an earlier ritual deposit. The last explanation would account for the apparent presence of ritual equipment both below and above the floors of rooms. There is also evidence for later activity, long after the abandonment of the settlement, probably in the Hellenistic period. Room K 15 K 15 was an open, paved and stepped passage leading up into K 16-17. Pottery listed in the notebook from this area included pithoi decorated with incised cross hatching, chevron, multiple bands of finger impressions, and serpentine rope slashed patterns. Also recorded are tripods, dishes mostly with flat bases, some buff gritty wares including handles as from K 14, and fine kylix stems and part of a stirrup jar. No pottery was catalogued but a huge handle was found in one of the boxes from K 15. Objects from the room included a terracotta loomweight (225), two boar's tusks (226), and the horn of a bull (247). Outside Rooms K 8-14-15 Somewhere in this area was found a fragment from the face of a terracotta goddess figure (plate 9 h).90 Room K 16 Room K 16-17 was labelled a large open court. The division between the two rooms was not distinct, and it may have been a buttress, or as Wallace suggests, the remains of an earlier wall.91 The notebook mentions that K 17 was built on top of a rubbish tip, but in the publication, the rubbish tip is said to have run under only K 12 and K 13. The notebook lists the following pottery from K 16: at least four pithoi decorated with finger impressions, rope, double row of dinted rope, and chevron patterns; five pithoid jars, two in gritty buff, the others in red ware; tripods; dishes, one pulled in at rim with holes on either side near base; kalathoi; part of a large coarse stirrup vase; sherds of a vase in red clay apparently with slits cut out near base (K16.1); jugs or jars in sandy orange clay, and a sherd from a heavy tripod lamp. The goblet stem illustrated in Seiradaki was found in one of the boxes but was not catalogued; it is probably Hellenistic in date.92 Objects included fragments of figures of goddesses and other ritual objects, a terracotta figurine (228),93 a terracotta spool, and fragments of a conch shell (227). Not much pottery is preserved from this part of the room. The hut urn (K16.1) is unusual because of its size, and is the largest known from the site. The two handled jar (K16.2) and the goblet stem (identified as a krater base by Seiradaki) are probably Hellenistic in date and show later activity in the area in that period. The jar may in fact represent two vessels of identical fabric, as the base does not seem to fit the profile of the rim and handles. Although no precise parallel could be found, the general shape seems similar to pottery of the Hellenistic period.94 Pottery Catalogue: K16 Coarse Wares K16.1 Huturn(PLATE 10fir,FlG.3.11).Max.pres.H. 16.Three large fragments (22 sherds). 10% (?) preserved, including top of doorway, fragments of two sides, part of roof, one handle attachment on each side, and assorted body fragments; also preserved are parts of inserted cut-out doorway.

There was, however, a lower deposit in the room (none was recorded from K 16), identified in the notebook as the same rubbish tip underlying K 12 and K 13. Fragments from two strata below the walls were kept separate in one of the boxes; both come from below the walls, the upper from 0-0.50 below the walls, the lower from 0.50-1.0 below the walls. The following pottery was listed in the notebooks from the main deposit in K 17: two pithoi, about three pithoid jars, five tripods, dishes, the neck of jar in gritty buff ware, and a tubular vessel like a pipe in gritty buff ware. Uncatalogued sherds included a krater fragment with a curvilinear motif. Many objects of bronze were found in the room, including a fragment of a blade (230), a sickle (232),95 an awl (236),96 a fragment of a saw (237), and a nail (238). Other objects included a stone bead (231), a worked piece of steatite (268), a terracotta horn from a figurine (233), a tubular cult object, two cylindrical terracotta spindle whorls (234, 235), and a pierced boar's tusk (231). There was also some material found in the boxes labelled K 16-17 or K 16-18. Some of these fragments are catalogued below, but also included was a krater fragment with a floral motif, a possible snake tube fragment, and a coarse handle. The miniature tankard (K17.1) can be paralleled by larger LM IIIC examples.97 The krater (K17.2), with its good LM IIIC decorative scheme of filling angles and between bands is similar to a krater from Knossos of early LM IIIC date.98 Pottery Catalogue: K17 Fine Wares K17.1 Miniature tankard (FIG. 3.12).

K 17, Below Walls 0-0.50 The notebook reports more fine ware than usual in this layer, but the sherds were very small and broken. The coarse ware included tripod dishes and jars. In addition to the catalogued pottery, the boxes also contained a handle and a plain body fragment from deep bowls, a double handle, a handle attachment on a coarse jar, a possible thelastron spout, a burned coarse body sherd of 'oatmeal' ware, and a body sherd of phyllite fabric. The pottery is scrappy and not very diagnostic. K17.4 has a crosshatched pattern within multiple loops, a motif which can be found on a number of LM IIIC pots. The low foot of K17.3 may indicate an early date. The hatched oval on the stirrup jar is also a common LM IIIC motif. The pithoid jar or basin and tripod leg are good LM IIIC shapes.

K 17, Lower Deposit, 0.50-1.00 Below Walls According to the notebook, this stratum was identical to that above, except there were no obvious pithos sherds. Part of a red painted 'skyphos' joined a sherd from the floor level. Mention was also made in the notebook of a lower level in K 16 and K 17, which was the same as the other two strata; the base of a ribbed cylindrical cup of MM date (K17.10) came from this lowest deposit. A rather large amount of material was kept separate from this lower deposit in K 17 and was found in a compartment in one of the boxes. Many pieces were not catalogued.

Coarse wares included a spout fragment from a stirrup jar, the handle of a cooking jug, and a fragment of a jug or amphora in phyllite fabric. Unfortunately, the catalogued pottery from this deposit is not closely diagnostic. The ribbed cylindrical cup (K17.10) is clearly MM II in date, belonging to the period when the peak sanctuary was in use. The rest of the material is LMIIIC, and none of it has to be particularly late. The deep bowls lack the raised and hollowed bases found on later examples; the flat bases can be paralleled by some from Kastrokephala." Of great interest is the fragment of a plaque, which suggests that ritual material was being dumped in the area. This information accords well with the cult equipment in K 70, K 72, and K 32, all of which may have been from the same rubbish pit; the cult equipment from K 38 might also have come from the same dump. This material could have been brought from anywhere, but it is interesting that K 16-17 may also have been in use as a shrine of the goddess with upraised arms later on. It is possible that this building was used for ritual from its construction, and that the cult equipment found in the rubbish pit came from a cleaning up of an earlier phase of the shrine. It might also have come from another location, however. Pottery Catalogue: K17, Lower Deposit Below Walls, 0.50-1.0 Fine Wares K17.10 Cup or tumbler (FIG. 3.12). D. base est. 6.

The excavators suggested that animals could step over the low walls.100 If the walls were so low, however, it would not have served well as an animal enclosure, and it seems more likely that it was entered from above, like so many of the other rooms on the site. The function is not clear, nor is it certain whether the room belonged with K 15-17 or K 38-39, since it is contiguous to both. The notebook reports the following pottery from the room: at least four pithoi decorated with pinched rope, chevron and wavy rope motifs; pithoid jars; three tripods; four dishes; and the top of a large red stirrup jar. The fragment of a small tripod found in one of the boxes may be one of the tripods mentioned in the notebook. The only object found in the room was a bronze ring (679).101 100 Karphi, 77-8. 101 Karphi, 29.2.</page><page sequence="84">THE NORTHEAST Q UADRANT 73 The catalogued pottery includes the top of what appears to be a lentoid flask of an unusual shape, with both handles on the shoulder, not from the neck to the shoulder (K18.1); similar flasks come from Pseira and Alalakh in Syria.102 The cooking dish (K18.2) is of the standard Type 6, perhaps the most common on the site; there are many parallels for it in LM IIIC contexts.103 Pottery Catalogue: K18 K18.1 Lentoid flask (FIG. 3.13).

TEMPLE ROAD EAST (ROOMS K 70, K 72) The road labelled the Temple Road had retained much of its paving.104 The excavators thought that it originally branched to the right from the top of K 32 and ran between the Great House and Temple Dependencies on the east and the Commercial Quarter on the west up to the Temple, bending to the left to avoid the rubbish dump that ran under K 16-17. The construction of the Baker's House, however, changed the route. At that time K 70 was built on top of the dump, continuing the lines of the walls of K 16-17. Although K 70 was never identified as part of the Great House, it may have belonged in its last phases with K 16-17. A retaining wall for the dump was visible below K 70, and there was also a heavy banking of masonry below K 71 that went with the earlier arrangement of the area. Room K 70 Room K 70 was a cellar built over the same rubbish dump found under K 16-17. The pottery was recorded as usual, but with little fine ware. The notebook mentions coarse sherds in red and gritty buff clay from tripods or pithoid jars, fragments of dishes, perhaps all from a single vessel of Type 6. There were only a few fine sherds, probably from bowls, and no certain pithos fragments. Objects found in the space included a black stone bowl (600)105 and a cylindrical stone pestle (426).106 A good deal of terracotta ritual equipment was also found in this area, but whether it came from the dump beneath or belonged with the use of the later room as a back room for K 16-17 is uncertain. The notebook mentions the arms, hand, and part of the skirt of a terracotta goddess, a fragment from a flat plaque, and part of a ridged tubular vessel, possibly a snake tube. Fragments of a possible snake tube were found in one of the boxes, and another one from uncertain context (K.33) may also come from here. The plaque fragment was found, but was not catalogued. Only the rounded corner was preserved, with a wide flat edge around it. It was of a coarse reddish yellow (5YR 6/8) fabric with hard black and white inclusions and gold mica. The catalogued material seems to come from the second use of the area as a cellar room, rather than belonging to the earlier rubbish dump or the street. There was no fragmentary fine ware such as was found in other areas of the dump, only large fragments of a coarse stirrup jar (K70.1), an amphora (K70.2), and a lid (K70.3). The stirrup jar has the customary hole pierced through the top, and the top seems to have been made as a separate disc and added on, a trait that is customary in LMIIIC. The large amphora has rope-twisted handles, which although not usual, are found in later LM IIIC contexts, particularly at Kavousi-Vronda.101 They are popular in the middle phase of LH IIIC on the mainland.108 The disc lid is also common on the site and its popularity may be a LM IIIC trait.109 Pottery Catalogue: K 70 Coarse Wares K70.1 Stirrup jar (FIG. 3.14).

The road was a series of widely spaced steps rising to the north. The notebook records the following coarse pottery: a pithos rim of Type 9, two pithoid jars of Types 8 and 10, rims and legs of at least two large tripods of Type 3, several dishes of Types 4 and 6. There was a little fine ware, mainly from bowls, and a kylix stem. Other objects from this area included a curved bronze blade (450),110 an oblong stone object that was not inventoried, and a fragment of a terracotta goddess, as well as animal bones. One of the boxes included the corner of a terracotta plaque of very coarse reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) fabric with large and frequent schist inclusions (2-4 mm); this thick plaque had a flat ridge running around the edge of it. The two preserved vessels were fragmentary and may have come either from the dump beneath the street or from the street itself. The stirrup jar (K72.2), with its disc top, hole pierced near the false spout, and linear decoration is surely late in LM IIIC. Late features include the way in which the spout touches the false spout, and the air hole also is thought to be a sign of the late LM IIIC and SM styles.111 This example lacks the cone on the false spout that is a hallmark of the late LM IIIC stirrup jars elsewhere, but such cones are not common at Karphi, even in the later tomb material. A burned body fragment of a stirrup jar with a crosshatched triangle or lozenge found in one of the boxes and labelled K 72 floor may belong to the same vessel.

TEMPLE ROAD WEST (AREA K 76) Area K 76 This area was very confused; essentially it wound its way from street K 56 on the south to K 72 on the north. Although roofing material was found in it, the excavators believed that the roofing came from buildings to either side of it and that it was always open to the sky. It may, however, have been covered over in its last phase of use. There were two orthostats up against the south end of the west wall of this 'room'; these were the best on the site. Originally thought to be jambs of a doorway from K 56 into K 76, they were later interpreted as table legs or a framed small shrine.112 The extreme south end of the area was paved with a good plaque floor, perhaps from the time when it was part of the street, as the pavers are level with K 56. Pendlebury thought the curved wall on the north resembled Egyptian manure tips.113 There was much burning at the extreme north end, but this seems to be from the oven heating, not from a fire. According to the notebook, the pottery was very fragmentary. All the usual types were represented, but there were few pithoi and many vertical handles from large jars of Types 3 and 4. Fine wares were identified as from bowls or stirrup jars, but all other types were represented except pyxides and tankards. There were two small cups in soft clay of Types 1 and 2, and part of a flat cult plaque. Sherds of a krater with a red painted bird,114 as well as the krater illustrated in Seiradaki,115 were not found. A large amount of fine ware appeared in the boxes from this location. In addition to that catalogued below, there were many deep bowl fragments: seven rims with spirals, one with pendent multiple loops, one with fringe, two with fringe or flower motif, one with a panelled pattern, one with a fringe, three with arcs, and four too worn to tell. Also from deep bowls were seven handles (one with fringed motif next to it) and 25 body sherds: three decorated with spirals, five with curvilinear motifs, three with multiple loops, one with fringe, two with vertical strokes, two with multiple-outlined rays, one with drip pattern, one with a vertical element, one with dots and lines, and six with bands. There was also a fragment from the handle of a cup, a kylix with multiple-outlined rays, six kraters with lozenge chain or hatched ovals (possibly 'kissing fishes'), curvilinear motifs, filler arcs, and elaborately fringed motifs. Eleven stirrup jar fragments were found, decorated with bands, curvilinear motifs, a possible debased octopus, a U pattern, a flower, and fringed motifs. Also found were a small fine spout, a thelastron spout attachment, a jug fragment with wavy bands, a large jug with crude spiral, a coarse jar or jug with a curvilinear motif, the vertical handle of a jug, and a cylindrical piece with ridges and pallette or horns, possibly the top of a goddess, snake tube, or altar (plate 9 h). Other objects recorded as from this space included a decorated bronze axe head 110 Karphi, pi. 28.2. 111 Hallager 2000, 146 provides the most recent discussion of the air holes in LM IIIC stirrup jars. 112 Karphi, 87. 113 Karphi, 87. 114 Seiradaki, fig. 25a. 115 Seiradaki, fig. 25d.</page><page sequence="86">THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT 75 K70.1 (1:4) t K70.2 (1:4) K72.1 K72.2 Fig. 3.14.

The plaque fragment was found in one of the boxes; it is of a very soft reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) fabric, and the corner is preserved with a flat ridge around the top edge. It is difficult to interpret this area. Part of it may have been included in the rubbish pit found farther east. It was probably a street first, perhaps becoming part of the Baker's House or Commercial Quarter in its last phase of use. The pottery suggests that it was not a living space, as it consists of very small pieces, mostly early in date. The material is very similar to that found also in K 79-89, and there may have been a large court in this area that was later carved into smaller units. Like the material from K 79-89, this probably repre sents refuse from earlier habitation of the site. The fine pottery is consistent in style and very useful as an assemblage of material from the earliest part of LM IIIC. First of all, there seem to be more possible cups in this deposit than is the case elsewhere. It is always difficult to distinguish cups from deep bowls when only a small fragment of the rim or body is preserved but several examples in this group look more like cups than deep bowls, including K76.7, K76.12, K76.15 and K76.17; the cup handle found in one of the boxes may be from one of these or similar cups. K76.37 and K76.38 are from shallow cups or bowls, like those found at Khania.119 The best preserved of the deep bowls (K76.1) may be somewhat later, but still within early LM IIIC; the foot is a bit higher than most, and it finds its closest parallel in a deep bowl from the Kephala tholos at Knossos, probably of early LM IIIC date, despite the late date of the tomb.120 Like many of the other deep bowls in this deposit, the interior has a reserved disc. This piece may belong to the later use of the area, as its preservation also suggests. The bases of the other deep bowls are raised and slightly concave, except for K76.24, which has a true ring base, and K76.25 with its flat base. Many of the bases have reserved discs (K76.18, K76.19, K76.23, K76.24). Two of the bases have paint on the edges of their undersides (K76.19, K76.21) or are monochrome underneath (K76.20) or have a spiral or circle (K76.22). The most popular motifs on cups or deep bowls are blob (four examples), multiple pendent loops (four examples), quirk (two examples), zigzag (two examples), and Minoan flower (two examples). These motifs are also common in early LM IIIC deposits at Kastri and Knossos,121 as well as in Phase I of Kavousi Kastro, although the pendent multiple loops do not appear there until Phase II.122 The early deposits from Building B at Kavousi-Vronda are also similar.123 Several of the sherds are of LM IIIB style, as with K76.26 and K76.29. The goblet stem K76.39 is probably from a champagne cup, a shape which seems to die out in popularity after the early phases of LM IIIC.124 The other pottery is more fragmentary and difficult to date.

THE BAKER'S HOUSE (ROOMS K 71, K 73, K 74) This entire building was considered a later addition to the settlement, and it underwent modifications during the course of its history.125 The building was constructed over a street and possibly part of the rubbish dump that was in the area to the west of the Great House. There is an earlier wall under room 71 shown on the plan that may have served as a boundary for the rubbish pit to the east. Rooms 70 and 71 were probably originally single room, entered on the south; the partition wall between them was built later on top of collapsed rubble and may have served as buttress. A so-called bread oven stands in the north end. Little was found in the building, and little survives today. Room K 71 There were comparatively few tripod legs and little fine ware found in this room. In addition to what is listed in the publication, the notebook records at least three pithoi, one with a rope moulding on the rim, several pithoid jars, jars of Types 1-4, a coarse krater; fine 125 Karphi, 86-7.</page><page sequence="92">THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT 81 K73.4 *15 I K73.1 K74.1 Fig. 3.17.

In addition to the catalogued pottery, there was another deep bowl with vertical chevrons and two fragments from stirrup jars, one with crosshatching, and the other with loops. There is not enough material to date this room securely; the deep bowl with pendent multiple loops appears in the very earliest LM IIIC, and there are parallels for it in LM IIIB.126 Pottery Catalogue: K 71 Fine Wares K71.1 Deep bowl or cup (plate 1 h, FIG. 3.17).

The room was unusual in that it had no discernable floor. In addition to the many dishes mentioned in the publication, the notebook records pithos rims of Types 2 and 9, a pithoid jar of Type 10 that joined with a vessel in K 76, many jars and tripods, and much broken fine ware. In addition to the catalogued pottery, there is also a fragment of a deep bowl with multiple loops and three fragments from stirrup jars, one decorated with a spiral, one with a scalloped edge, another with an intricate pattern that included a hatched oval. Other objects included a hollow bone tube (451).127 The fine pottery is fragmentary and probably represents earlier material from underneath, rather than vessels in use at the time the settlement ended. The fact that there were joins with K 76 suggests that all this material might belong to an earlier dump. The preserved sherds do not look late; the schematic double axe pattern of K73.2 is found in earlier contexts and at any rate is an earlier LM IIIB2 motif that continues into LM IIIC.128 Pottery Catalogue: K 73 Fine Wares K73.1 Deep bowl (FIG. 3.17).

Room K 74 This room was said to have produced little fine ware, and Seiradaki illustrated one fragment from the room, ajar of Type 8, which was not found.129 The notebook lists also pithos rims of Types 2 and 5, ajar of Type 7, tripod legs, a kalathos of Type 1, a one-handled jug of Type 3, a spout (perhaps from dish of Type 6), and a few fragments of fine ware from bowls. Animal bones are also recorded. Two additional deep bowl fragments were found, one decorated with a fringed streamer, the other with vertical strokes; these were not catalogued. The single catalogued sherd, with its arc filler and dotted lozenge, is surely LM IIIC, but whether it is early in that pottery phase or later is not certain.

There was no indication of different phases of construction; rather, the excavators thought that all the rooms were part of the same building programme.2 Rooms K 22, K 23, K 29, and K 30 were all connected by doorways and belonged to the same building. Rooms K 31, K 33, and K 34, however, were separate units, with entrances on a possible street outside to the east. Room K 21 Only part of this room was excavated; the rest is said to have disappeared into a field.3 There is no further information on the area, and it is not clear if it was a room or an exterior space. The notebook reports that the pot tery was mostly coarse and much worn, including a few pithos fragments; tripods, at least three with flaring rims; at least two dishes; pithoid jar bases; a gritty buff rim, perhaps of ajar, with a vertical handle; and a pyxis in red ware. Fine wares included flat and ring ba ses, two decorated rims, arched horizontal bowl handles, and a kylix base. The pithoid jar pictured in Seiradaki was not located in the museum boxes.4 Few other objects were found in the room, but two terracotta spools were still preserved, one weighing 50, the other 70 g. The deep bowl with Minoan flower (K21.1) may be an import, as it had a distinctively different fabric and paint; the flower motif seems to be more popular in the early LM IIIC period than later, so this piece may belong to the period of construction of the building. The other pottery gives little indication as to date or function of the area. Pottery Catalogue: K 21 Fine Wares K21.1 Deep bowl or cup (plate 10 d, fig. 4.1). Max. pres. H. 5.7.

LM IIIC. Room K 22 Room K 22 was identified as a magazine west of K 23.5 The room showed many traces of burning, including a patch of baked roofing clay with marks of a rafter 5 cm in section; it is thus possible that a hearth had existed in the room. There was a much larger quantity of pottery than usual for the size of the room. The publication reports that there were eight pithoi, all other common coarse types except open dishes, and little fine ware. The notebook adds the following information. Of the eight pithoi, one was of red clay with a fine chevron pattern, a rope-slashed ridge, and a plain ridge below the rim, and a base that had flaked away; a second was of yellow gritty clay, with chevron and diagonally slashed bands, heavy rim, and a plain base; a third was also of yellow gritty clay with vertically slashed bands, no attached rim or base; a fourth of the same fabric had a pinched rope below the 1 Karphi, 79-81. 2 Karphi, 135. 3 Karphi, 80. 4 Seiradaki, fig. 2.7. 5 Karphi, 80.</page><page sequence="95">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINA TION Fig. 4.1.

Scale 1:3. rim and probably a plain base; a fifth was of reddish clay with pinched rope at the rim and plain bands below; a sixth also of reddish clay had a ridge with finger impressions below and a triple line of finger-impressed rope further down; the seventh was also of reddish clay and had plain ridges; and the eighth was apparently plain. There were also fragments from large jars that were not pithoi, an amphora with two large twisted handles (K22.ll), as well as three very large tripod legs, one with three impressed holes at the top, a flaring rim, a rim that was angular in section, small bases with straight sides, an offset base, one or two jars (K22.12), a sherd from a lid with rope pattern with finger impressions, a white painted sherd in thick red ware, two notched sherds, a large stirrup jar, perhaps with octopus design, and two pyxides (K22.2, K22.3). Among the fragments still preserved in the boxes but not catalogued was a huge handle from a pithos with three holes at the base,6 a tripod leg (sampled KAR 06/24), and a body sherd with a large flat knob as decoration. There were also fragments of a second pyxis similar to K22.6 in fabric. Objects included two cylindrical terracotta spindle whorls (239, 240) and five spools, of which two have been preserved. These are of different fabric and shape, but both spools weigh 60 g. The pottery has some unusual features. Although many pithoi were found in other rooms, the notebook gives enough information about rims, bases, and decoration to suggest that these vessels were well preserved, not just the discrete fragments found in many of the rooms. The number of elaborately decorated pyxides is high as well; they come in many different types and with decoration ranging from the early LM IIIC date of K22.27 and slightly later K22.6,8 to the late LM IIIC dates for pyxides K22.3 and K22.4. The deposit is also unusual for the paucity of deep bowls or other vessels for eating and drinking. The only deep bowl (K22.1) has blob decoration.

Room K 23 K 23 was identified as the most important room of block, and indeed is the largest single room in the building. The room was entered through a doorway on the east, and there may have been an additional stepped entrance from K 21 on the south. On the west end was a steep step up through a doorway into K 22; an additional doorway may have led through stairs into K 29 on the northwest, where there was also a possible small pot stand. Perhaps a window led into K 31 on the north.9 This room had more complex stratigraphy than any other at Karphi. The excavators recognised two separate layers, interpreting them at first as evidence for a second story, but because the lower layer was burned and the upper was not, they were seen as two phases.10 According to the published account, the walls were blackened to a height of 1.24 m, and there was burned destruction debris in the lower layer. The upper layer, however, was not burned, so the excavators suggested that the builders used the clay of the earlier burned roofing as the foundation for a paved floor. It looks as though the building suffered fire damage during its history and was rebuilt. Much of the pottery from this room was labelled K 23 or K 23 floor. There was, however, a large box which was divided into two compartments with material from below the floor. The tag in the one of the compartments read 'K 23: below floor, upper', while the other was labelled 'K 23: below floor, lower'. Only one level below the floor was mentioned in the publication and notebook, and it is uncertain what distinction exists between the two separate groups. The labels suggest that both of these deposits are below the final floor in the building. It is possible that the material from the upper of these two deposits represents what was between the two floors, and that from the lower deposit came from below the earlier floor. The two may also have been kept separate arbitrarily and the distinction has no meaning in terms of date. Since the deposits were kept distinct by the excavators, they are here presented separately. What is certain is that the lower deposits represent material earlier than that from the latest floor. Much of the pottery preserved from the room is labelled K 23, floor. It is assumed that this represents the material on the final floor in use at the time the 9 Karphi, 80. 10 Karphi, 80.</page><page sequence="99">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION building was abandoned. Vessels labelled simply K 23 may have come from either layer. The floor deposit (i.e. what was on and above the later floor) was published as being usual but with little fine ware. The notebook adds the following list of pottery: pithoi, pithoid jars, a large jar with twisted handles similar to the amphora from K 22, sherds from large red stirrup vases, at least two with white-painted decoration, a jug with white paint on harsh grey clay, and smaller coarse vases. The fine ware was said to be scanty and mostly blackened by fire. A good deal of pottery in the boxes labelled 'K 23 floor' was not catalogued. Included in this group were deep bowl fragments: a vertical burned rim fragment with curvilinear motif, a flaring rim fragment with a band at the rim, a burned body fragment with a curvilinear pattern and two more unburned body sherds with curvilinear patterns, one with filler motifs, and a monochrome cup or deep bowl. Also from this deposit were fragments of a spouted jug, a flat vertical handle, a closed vessel with creamy slip and three red bands, the neck and handle of a jug in coarse very pale brown fabric, and a scuttle handle with spiral fluting. From the boxes came a coarse base with an added disc near the base and the rim fragment of a pithos, both labelled K 23. Several vessels published by Seiradaki as coming from K 23 present problems. The carinated bowl of Type 511 and a coarse stirrup jar12 were not located in the boxes or on the shelves. The small tripod looks like one of the tripods from K 121, and the number given in the publication may be an error.13 Objects found in the room included a fragment of a bronze bowl (278), three Neolithic stone axes (284, 285, 286),14 three conical (279, 280, 283) and four cylindrical (281, 282, 287, 291) terracotta spindle whorls, nine terracotta spools (two large and seven medium), a pierced bone sword pommel (289), and shell (290). One spool is still preserved. It was made of very coarse fabric and was burned. It weighs 100 g. Much of the pottery from the floor deposit that was whole or nearly complete was burned, including the krater (K23.ll), miniature amphora (K23.17), thelastron (K23.18), stirrup jars (K23.19 and K23.23), jugs (K23.20, K23.28, K23.29), and jar (K23.31). The fragments found in the room, however, including most of the deep bowls and kraters, were not burned. The fact that the vessels on the floor were burned but not the sherds that may have come from the earlier floor contradicts what was said in the excavation report and notebook. Dating of the two deposits is difficult. Of the nearly complete pots from the floor, the earliest may be the stirrup jar K23.19, with its fringed and dotted crosshatched triangles; the decoration places it toward the end of early LM IIIC.15 Perhaps somewhat later in date is jug K23.20, which finds parallels both at Kavousi-A'fl.vfra of early LM IIIC and at Sybrita/ Thronos of late LM IIIC.16The latest vessel is certainly the large carinated krater K23.ll, with its most unusual shape and decoration. The rows of crosshatched triangles, with their linear character and regularity, along with the absence of any of the lively LM IIIC filler ornaments, suggest that it could be termed Subminoan in style, although exact parallels are lacking. The piece is similar to a kantharos from Kephallonia of the late LH IIIC period,17 and the decoration may be paralleled on an amphoroid krater of LM III date fromTourtouloi.18 Other whole or nearly complete pots are less closely datable. As far as the fragments go, the deep bowls bear typical LM IIIC patterns of wavy line, spiral, panels, loops, and a possible double axe that find parallels in early LM IIIC sites. The tankards are clearly LM IIIC; one with a beaded rim (K23.8) is similar to an example from K28.2; the decoration of filled pendent triangles finds parallels on the mainland in middle LH IIIC.19 Another (K23.9) has decoration similar to that on a vessel in LM IIIC Khania,20 while the third (K23.10) bears a decoration of alternating arcs that look back to the LM IIIA period.21 The other pottery is not closely datable.

K 23, Lower Floor Level The notebook calls this level 'below the floor'. The publication says that the pottery consists of sherds of the usual types, but much broken and blackened by fire.22 The notebook, however, attributes the burned fragments to the floor deposit and mentions a large pro portion of fine sherds. The material from the museum box was divided into two separate compartments, and these have been kept separate, although they may belong together. The preserved pottery was not noteworthy for its burning, and in fact, more of the fragments from the floor deposit of K 23 are burned than from this deposit. One cylindrical terracotta spindle whorl (293) was found in the lower deposit. The upper deposit from below the floor contained, in addition to the catalogued sherds, the following pottery. From deep bowls there were three rim fragments (one with a rim band, one with a curvilinear pattern, one worn or plain), a flat raised base, and four body sherds (two with handle attachments, two with bands). Other open shapes included a krater with bands and three other body fragments with blob decoration, filler, and an indeterminate motif, as well as the handle from a cup or kylix. Closed vessels included a fragment of a stirrup jar or jug with filler design, three body fragments with bands, and a possible pyxis fragment with bands. The material is not closely datable, in part because it is so small and scrappy. The octopus deep bowl (K23.41) may be early, as the depiction of tentacles with suckers is not regular on octopods of LM IIIC; a LM IIIC parallel can be found for this treatment, however, on a krater from Phase I at Kavousi-Kzv/ro P The decorative motif on the pyxis (K23.44) resembles a vessel from early LM IIIC Kastelli Pediada.24 The deep bowl bases are raised and slightly hollowed, but not so much as on later examples, which almost approach the later conical foot of the PG style.

K 23, Below Floor, Lower Deposit The lower deposit from below the floor contained much pottery that was too small to be catalogued. Deep bowls included a rim with pendent multiple loops and a body fragment with a handle attachment. Fragments of cups or deep bowls were decorated with blobs, vertical lines, leaf and bands, or bands, or they were monochrome or plain. Other fine ware included a krater body fragment with multiple streamers, a stirrup jar shoulder, a spout from a tankard, and three body fragments from closed vessels, one with spiral and filler, another with oblique strokes, and the third with bands. As with the material from the upper deposit below the floor, there were fewer burned fragments than expected from the report in the publication.</page><page sequence="106">THE SOUTHEAST QUADRANT 95 Like the material from the upper deposit below the floor, this pottery is difficult to date. There seems to be a great number of monochrome deep bowls or cups, although many of these may instead be parts of blob decoration. Cups and deep bowls with blob decoration are typical of the earlier LMIIIC deposits in Building B at Kavousi-da,25 and blob or monochrome cups also appear in Phase II at Kavousi-Kastro.26 The decorative motifs on several of the deep bowls also find parallels with material from early LM IIIC, including K23.50,27 K23.51,28 and K23.59.29The kylix (K23.62) is similar to one found at Kavousi-Vronda, in the early LM IIIC deposits.30 The bases on the deep bowls are raised and either flat or concave, but again, there are no examples of the very high feet of the latest phases. The material in this deposit, then, is probably not the earliest LM IIIC, but early in LM IIIC. Pottery Catalogue: Below Floor, Lower Deposit Fine Wares K23.48 Deep bowl (FIG. 4.8). D. rim est. 14.

Just Outside K 23 to E According to the notebook, in 1939 pottery was found just outside K 23 to the east, including few sherds, very fragmentary, with a large proportion of fine ware. Included in this deposit were the top of a large red stirrup jar, a lid with rope moulding, and two jars of Type 3, one of which had knobs around the shoulder (K23.73).

Knobs just below lower handle attachment. Labelled outside K 23 to E. LM IIIC. Room K 29 Rooms K 29 and K 30 may have been two separate rooms or a single room separated by a buttress. K 29 was a small compartment approached by stairs from K 23, and it was built up against a wall of bedrock on the east. Pottery was listed as usual, but mention was made of a larnax fragment (K29.17). The notebook lists the following additional pottery from this room: a flat open dish with upright side and horizontal handle (i.e. a tray), a large red stirrup vase, a gritty blue bowl (K29.10), and a ridged pedestal base. Fragments from this room found in the boxes but not catalogued included two deep bowls with spirals, a fine jug handle, a thelastron spout, two stirrup jars, and a jar or jug with creamy white slip and red paint. A pithoid jar published by Seiradaki is actually the larnax rim mentioned in the publication;31 the jar pictured in Seiradaki was not located.32 Other objects from K 29 included a bronze curved disc or cap (265),33 a bronze sickle (267), a bronze ring (268),34 a conical lump of steatite (269), a Neolithic stone axe (292),35 a cylindrical terracotta spindle whorl (270), and a fragment of a bone implement (266). The fine pottery from the room comes chiefly from deep bowls or cups. Many of the motifs are those that are popular very early in LM IIIC: the buttonhook spiral, the quirk, and the outlined double axe. The very tight form of the quirk on K29.4 may be an earlier feature; it appears, for example, at Kastri.36 The buttonhook spiral seems popular in the early part of LM IIIC at Kastri and Knossos.37 Deep bowl K29.6 finds parallels at LM IIIC Phaistos, but cannot be more closely dated.38 The larnax (K29.17) finds its closest parallels in east Cretan burials of LM IIIB or LM IIIB/ C; the dark fish with wavy lines in a central panel is most similar to one on a LM IIIB larnax from Pacheia Ammos,39 but it also resembles the fish on the interiors of a group of sarcophagi from the same workshop dating to LM IIIB/C fromTourtouli, Piskokephalo, and Praisos-Papoures The material, then, looks rather earlier than some of the late LM IIIC deposits found elsewhere at Karphi, although not perhaps as early as the deposits in K 76 or those below the floors of the Great House or K 23. The material provides little information on the function of this room. The larnax (K29.17), which is of the bathtub variety, is probably not funerary but practical.

Room K 30 Like K 29, this was a small compartment backed up against the rock and separated from K 29 by a buttress. The published fine krater with rows of double loops in a scale pattern41 was not located. This vessel finds a close parallel at Kavousi- Vronda.42 The notebook only mentions a tripod bowl (K30.1) and a flat dish (possibly a tray) with wavy rim and finger dints. Objects found in the room included a fragment of bronze (295) and a cylindrical terracotta spindle whorl (294). The tripod bowl (K30.1) is of an unusual type, open, with a rim like a pithoid jar and apparently a rounded bottom. It may be an example of the round-bottomed tripod cooking pot that is thought to have been introduced into Crete in LM III from the mainland.43 Pottery Catalogue: K 30 Coarse Wares K30.1 Tripod cooking pot (FIG. 4.10).

Room K 31 This small room just north of K 23 was perhaps divided into two unequal halves by a partition that is not shown on the plan.44 It was entered through a doorway on the east, and possibly also by ladder through a hatch from K 23. The pottery was recorded in the publication as usual, but without pyxides. The notebook mentions that there were few pithos sherds, and most of these came from a single pithos with a chevron design. Other pottery listed in the notebook includes the following: coarse stirrup jars, tripods, dishes, kalathoi, jars, some straight-sided bases, a punctuated sherd, and quite a large proportion of fine ware, including parts of two kylikes, one large krater, and a very small sherd that appeared to be a Mycenaean or Knossian import. Pottery from the boxes that was not catalogued includes four deep bowl fragments (decorated with multiple loops, spirals, and panelled pattern), a krater with multiple strokes, a stirrup jar, three pithoid jar rims (one of buff fabric with raised bands and incised circles),45 and a strainer spout. There were also two cooking trays, one with a horizontal handle and another Seiradaki, fig. 16.3 and pi. 9c. Gesell, Day and Coulson 1995, 90, fig. 7.2. Borgna 19975, 200.

Objects found in the room included a fragment of a bronze knife (298), a Neolithic axe (297),46 a fragment of a steatite bowl (299), a cylindrical terracotta spindle whorl (296), a pierced, sharpened boar's tusk (300), and the antler of a red deer. The preserved pottery does not look particularly late, although it is clearly LM IIIC. The deep bowl or cup without a rim band (K31.5) is unusual, but the feature does not seem to be a chronological indicator. The metopal panel on deep bowl K31.1 finds many parallels in LM IIIB and it appears in the earliest LM IIIC levels at Ksvousi-Kastro47 and in early LM IIIC deposits at Kastelli Pediada, Phaistos, and Kastri48 The panelled pattern of deep bowl or cup K31.4 has parallels in the second phase of the Kavousi-Kastro deposit49 and at Petras and Knossos of advanced LM IIIB date.50 Thus it looks as though the pottery (much of it fragmentary) belongs to the LM IIIB/C transition or early LM IIIC and does not represent the latest material from the site. The coarse wares, of course, do not provide a date, nor do they suggest a function for Room K 31; it seems unlikely to have been used solely for storage, given the few pithoi found in it. The lids and trays may indicate cooking. Pottery Catalogue: K 31 Fine Wares K31.1 Deep bowl (FIG. 4.10). D. rim est. 13. Single fragment from rim, preserving handle attachment.

Room K 33 Room K 33 was a simple small room with a doorway out onto K 35 to the east; it may have been an independent building. In the publication, the pottery was said to be as usual, but there was little fine ware.51 The notebook lists a good deal of pottery from this room. There were sherds from four pithoi, but only one in any quantity, and it has a pinched rope below the rim. Additional coarse ware included tripods with both vertical and horizontal handles (two of each type), four dishes, and two kalathoi. Fine wares were rather fewer than usual; there were parts of two kraters, stirrup jars, a kylix stem, and a hut urn (K33.2). Found in the boxes but not catalogued were two fine deep bowls, one burned with a spiral design, the other with vertical strokes. Stirrup jar fragments were decorated with fringed half circles, vertical strokes, filling motifs, fringes, and scale pattern. The krater illustrated in Seiradaki may be the same as the coarse bowl catalogued below (K33.3).52 Objects from the room included two cylindrical terracotta spindle whorls (301, 302) and the antler of a red deer.

It had two entrances, one from square 10 on the north, and the other from street 35 on the east. It was slightly set back from the other rooms (K 23, K 31, K 33). The publication mentions that three kraters came from this room, but they have not been preserved.53 According to the notebook, there were only a few pithos sherds, and also fragments of two pyxides. A fragment of a hollowed square vessel was found in one of the boxes, but it was not catalogued. Objects found in the room included a conical stone bead (303) and a pierced sandstone disc (304).54 Area K 35 K 35 was not a room, but a street to the east of the magazines. The pottery consisted chiefly of small and worn sherds, the type of material usually found in the streets and courtyards of the settlement. The krater published in Seiradaki looks rather like a champagne cup or goblet base and could not be located;55 a stem and foot is similar to the one pictured from K 76 (K76.39), and a mistake may have occurred in recording the numbers. The notebook mentions that a fragment was found in K 35 from the same krater as appeared in K 33, but this was not located, as there was nothing in the boxes labelled K 35. Room K 36 Rooms K 36 and K 37 were narrow little rooms or magazines that ran towards the east just north of the door of K 23 and to the south of the door into K 31. It is uncertain where these rooms belong. They were not fully excavated and continued to run toward the east. The pottery from K 36 included many fragments of a pithos with serpentine rope pattern between bands (K36.2), all decorated with incised chevrons, and there were few other sherds, mostly coarse. The basin illustrated in Seiradaki was not located.56 Objects from the room included a bronze needle (305) and a cylindrical terracotta spindle whorl (320). This room was certainly used for storage, but any other functions are unknown. 51 Karphi, 81. 52 Seiradaki, fig. 16.8. 53 Karphi, 81. 54 Karphi, pi. 30.4. 55 Seiradaki, fig. 16.7. 56 Seiradaki, fig. 5.7.</page><page sequence="114">THE SOUTHEAST QUADRANT K33.1 K33.2 K33.3 K33.4 K33.5 Fig. 4.11.

THE SQUARES AND BROAD ROAD (AREAS K 10, K 32, K 48) These three areas comprise two large squares (K 10 and K 48) and a street (K 32) that extended between the Magazines and the Great House on the north and the Magazines and the Small Shrine and Southern Houses on the west. Although this area may once have been paved, and is shown paved on the site plan, no paving stones were actually preserved. 58 Kastri, pi. 73b.</page><page sequence="116">THE SOUTHEAST QUADRANT Area K 10 K 10 was a small square. The publication states that it produced the usual sorts of pottery, but all the sherds were worn and small.59 The notebook records the following: pithoi and jars, a round-based tripod bowl and other tripods, a tray with waved rim, several flat bases of jugs or jars, a jug handle and fragment of a shoulder with a double groove, and two spouts from fine, large stirrup jars. In addition to the single fragment catalogued below, the boxes produced a handle from a double vessel, a handle with a small horned projection, and two fragments from fine stirrup jars, one with a pendent scale pattern. A conical stone bead (210) was also found. All of the pottery looks early in LM IIIC. Pottery Catalogue: K10 Fine Wares K10.1 Closed vessel (fig. 4.13). Max. pres. H. 4.6. Single body fragment. Fine, very soft, reddish yellow (5YR 7/6) fabric. Very pale brown (10YR 8/4) slip. Red (2.5YR 4/8) paint. Possibly from a stirrup jar. Crosshatched triangles or lozenges. LM IIIC. Area K 32 K 32 was a steep road leading from the square K 10 up to the west. The sherds found in this area were small and much worn, and according to the notebook they came mostly from tripods or dishes. The notebook also mentions that there were a few fine pieces, including one krater fragment with a bird, and some flat cult plaque fragments, one with a moulded ear. In addition to the vessels catalogued below, there were five deep bowl or cup rims (three with spirals, one with a spiral and pendent multiple loops, one too worn to determine), a deep bowl handle with arcs as filler, and eight deep bowl or cup body fragments decorated with spirals, multiple loops, arc filler, upright Minoan flower, multiple stems, multiple strokes and bands, and other curvilinear motifs. In addition, there were two krater fragments with alternating broad and narrow curvilinear bands or other curvilinear motifs, a cup fragment, fragments of one large stirrup jar and a smaller one with bands. Only one plaque fragment was found from this area. It had a large hole pierced through it and did not look like the usual sort of plaque found in the shrines. The fragment with the possible ear was not located. Other objects were of bronze and included a knife (508),60 a blade with a long tang (510),61 a rod in five pieces (511), and fragments of a bronze bowl (509). The pottery consists of many small fine fragments, of the sort that often are found in the streets and courtyards at Karphi and which probably represent refuse rather than vessels in use at the time of the abandonment; perhaps they were even beneath the paving stones that subsequently disappeared. Nearly all of the deep bowl or cup fragments have simple decorations, and many of them look early. The bivalve shell on K32.4 in particular has parallels in material of LM IIIB style from Kavousi-Kas/ro, Phaistos, and Knossos,62 and from early LM IIIC at Knossos.63 The motif is similar to other fragments at Karphi, particularly K23.59 from the lower deposit in K 23 and from K43.7. The quirk and the buttonhook spiral appear together in early LM IIIC deposits at Knossos, Kastri, and Khania;64 the rather open shape of the bowls would also fit in with an early date. The motif of multiple stems meeting to form a 'face' is also found on K76.13, and finds parallels at Kastelli Pediada and Kastri of early LM IIIC date.65 K32.10, with its panelled rather geometric pattern and use of arc fillers looks later, but it is too fragmentary to be certain. The kylikes and kraters all fit into the early phases of LM IIIC; the motifs on K32.12 find parallels at Kastelli Pediada and Kavousi-£asfm66 In short, while there is little that is closely diagnostic, most of the material fits into the early phases of LM IIIC. The plaques may have washed down into this area from above to the north and west, perhaps from the same dump found under the Great House, which itself contained a good number of plaque fragments, although it is possible that the plaques came from the Small Shrine.

Area K 48 The area labelled K 48 was not a room but an open square that lay between the Southern Houses and the Magazines. The notebook reported that there were many pithoi, a miniature kalathos with plain base, a large bowl with a flat rim, ajar rim, a very squat vase that may have been a jug, a gritty blue sherd with a white band and a jug with bosses. Sherds found in the boxes but not catalogued include a deep bowl with multiple stems, two stirrup jars (one handle attachment with a scale pattern, the other a burned base), the base of a stirrup jar or jug, and a coarse jug or jar with yellow slip and black bands. Other objects from the room included a conical stone bead (335), a pierced schist plaque (354),67 seven cylindrical (329, 330, 331, 332, 333,334,338) and one biconical (346) spindle whorls, and two shells (336, 337). The material from this deposit was unusual in that there were fewer small fine fragments than usual in an open area and there were two basins that were nearly complete; perhaps these basins were used for washing just outside one of the houses. The small deep cup K48.1 is a shape that is rare at the site, but it does occur in the tombs; a close parallel comes from Atsividhero 3 (A3.3). These tombs are not as late as the Ta Mnemata tombs, and they look rather early in LM IIIC. The base on K48.5, however, is rather high and looks late. Blob cups and bowls appear in the earliest LM IIIC deposits and continue in use, so K48.3 is of little help in dating. Pottery Catalogue: K 48 Fine Wares K48.1 Cup (FIG. 4.14).

THE SOUTHERN HOUSES (K 24-28, K 42-51) This block is said to show two phases of use,68 but it was more difficult to divide it up into individual houses, because there were few doorways. The excavators attributed to an earlier phase Rooms K 43, K 46, and K 47, with an open space K 42, and a curving street to the north where later there were three small rooms: K 45-50-51. They believed that Room K 44 was added later, along with the southern rooms K 24-28, the public room K 49, and the square K 48. At that time the street K 45-50-51 was blocked and divided into the three small compartments shown on the plan. It is likely that the later southern rooms (K 24-28) formed one unit, and the others (K 42-50) formed a second unit, part of which was early (K 43, K 46, K 47) and part later (K 44, K 45, K 50, K 51). K 49 may have been an independent unit. The Southern Rooms (K 24-28) Room K 24 Both K 24 and K 25 were tiny compartments, whose precise relation to the other rooms is not clear. Room K 24 had no unusual features and little deposition, although the notebook records that it contained roofing debris. The pottery from the room was much broken, as though it had been dumped here.69 The notebook lists the following coarse wares: the rim of a pithos in yellow gritty ware, which vitrified from fire (K24.2); a sherd of another pithos with serpentine rope pattern; bases of pithoid jars, some plain and two offset; a rim in gritty buff perhaps from large bowl or jar and another with pinched rope below; three tripods; three bowls with horizontal handles; rims of six open dishes, one with bent-in lip and holes in the base on either side; some horizontal handles from jugs, and four small bases in red ware, one fairly fine. Fine ware came mostly from deep bowls, but included at least one stirrup jar. The pithoid jar published by Seiradaki as from this room was not located.70 Other objects from the room included a Neolithic stone axe (288),71 two cylindrical terracotta spindle whorls (242, 243), and three terracotta spools. The preserved pottery from the room was not diagnostic. The deep bowl with hatched lozenge chain (K24.1) finds close parallels at Khania, Phaistos, and Kavousi-Kastro,72 and it should probably date to early in LM IIIC.

Room K 25 The other small room, K 25, was also denuded, but it had no traces of roofing. There were no unusual features. There was very little pottery, and in fact the notebook records none. The pithoid jar published by Seiradaki was not found.73 Pottery Catalogue: K 25 Fine Ware K25.1 Miniature kylix(FlG. 4.15). H. 4.5; D. base 3; D. rim 4.

Burned grey at handle and on one side of body. No trace of decoration. LM IIIC. Room K 26 A small room connected to a larger room (K 27), K 26 also lacked deposition; the notebook reports that it contained roofing clay and much evidence of burning. There were no other unusual features. Much pottery was found in this small room. The publication reports ten pithoi and pithoid jars and many kalathoi.74 The notebook lists at least four pithoi (one with chevron bands and probably two registers of serpentine rope pattern, one with a plain band, one with double rope with finger impressions and serpentine rope pattern, a fourth with chevron bands); five pithoid jars, one with pinched rope on the ridge below the rim (K26.13), one with a white painted design, a third in blue ware; eight kalathoi; five tripods; and some open dishes. Fine wares listed in the notebook included a kylix base, pyxis sherds, some miniature bowls, small stirrup jars, and a tankard (K26.4). The stirrup jar published by Seiradaki as from K 26 is from K 121,75 and the published stirrup jar with fringed decoration 68 Karphi, 81. 69 Karphi, 81. 70 Seiradaki, fig. 2.4. 71 Karphi, pi. 30.2. 72 Khania II, pi. 36.70-P 0160; Borgna 1997a, 280, fig. 15; Mook and Coulson 1997, 358, fig. 30.103. 73 Seiradaki, fig. 2.5. 74 Karphi, 82. 75 Seiradaki, pi. 6a, right.</page><page sequence="121">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION ■ K24.1 /.

Objects found in the room included a good deal of bronze: a votive double axe (248),77 a disc (249), a dagger hilt (250),78 an awl with a bone handle (251),79 a disc with bosses (252), and thin fragments (253). Other objects included a stone 'inlay' (254),80 a terracotta burnished flattened cylinder (255),81 and two terracotta spools. The krater (K26.5), juglet (K26.6), and tankard (K26.4) were well preserved and were probably in use in the room at the time of abandonment. The tankard is a good example of pleonastic late LM IIIC style, but dating the krater is more problematic. The shape looks late and can be paralleled by an example from a late LM IIIC deposit at Kastelli Pediada,82 but the decoration, for which there is no good parallel, looks earlier in LMIIIC. The juglet is not closely dated; such juglets occur as early as LM IIIC early at Khania, but continue later in the period.83 The cups and deep bowls are only fragments and may belong to an earlier use; the shape of cup K26.1 finds a good parallel at Knossos in the earliest stages of LM IIIC.84 76 Seiradaki, fig. 22h. 77 Karphi, pi. 29.1. 78 Karphi, pi. 29.1. 79 Karphi, pi. 29.1. 80 Karphi, pi. 30.3. 81 Karphi, pi. 30.4. 82 Rethemiotakis 1997, 322, fig. 33c. 83 Hallager 2000, 150-1. 84 Warren 2007, 337, fig. 2.P1919 (LM IIIB/C or earliest LM IIIB).</page><page sequence="122">THE SOUTHEAST QUADRANT 111 K26.5 (1:4) Fig. 4.16.

The bronze double axe may have served as a votive, as suggested by Gesell,85 or it may have been stored in this room for use in the libation rituals that may have taken place in K 27. The number of nearly complete tripod cooking pots suggests that the room may have also been used for cooking. Pottery Catalogue: K 26 Fine Wares K26.1 Cup (FIG. 4.16). D. rim est. 8.

Two ridges on mid body with crude rope slashing. Rope-slashed ridge at base of neck. Dints at bases of handles. LM IIIC. Room K 27 The largest room in the southern group was K 27. Little roofing material was found in it, suggesting to the excavators that it may have been an open space; it was also floored with the same sort of red clay found in the Temple, also interpreted as an open space.86 The recorded presence of some roofing clay, however, suggests that the room may once have been roofed. On the north side was sloping bedrock, with a thin slab of faced marble nearby; the two rhyta were found on this bedrock. These two ritual objects suggested to the excavators that the room may have been a shrine, an idea which found support also from the bronze votive double axe found in the neighbouring room K 26. The notebook lists the following coarse ware from K 27: three pithoi, two in yellow gritty clay, one with pinched rope below rim, the other with a chevron band, and another in red clay with chevrons; two pithoid jars with white painted designs on red clay; eight large jars; four stirrup jars; three kalathoi; a pyxis; five tripods; dish rims; two scuttle handles ofType 1; and a strainer top in buff ware. Fine wares are described as much blackened by fire, but included the two rhyta, which were originally thought to be three rhyta and two vases with human heads, along with a ring stand. Other objects from the room included a cylindrical terracotta spindle whorl (256) and 20 terracotta spools. Seven of the spools are still preserved; they are all of approximately the same size and shape and their weights vary from 50-75 g. All are intact, but worn, and all show burning. The two rhyta have been used to identify the room as a possible cult building. Certainly the large and elaborate rhyton that represents a cart on three wheels with a human figure on top and three ox heads on the front (HM 11046)87 must have been used for religious observance; it has no other possible use, except as decoration. It may have stood on a bench or platform and served as the focus for ritual activity. It is a unique piece and nothing like it exists.88 The other rhyton, with the human head, resembles a canonical piriform rhyton in shape, except for the head, and it is not nearly so large nor so elaborate. It finds a possible parallel in one of the tombs at Ta Mnemata (Mll.l). Were it not for these two objects, however, K 27 would not be identified as a cult room. The rest of the material from the room is certainly like that found in the other buildings on the site. The spools, if they indeed represent a form of loomweight, suggest that weaving went on in the room, since there are so many and of such even size and shape. Possibly there was a combination of religious observance and weaving here, the products of the room somehow in the service of religion or under the protection of a deity.89 Certainly no other room at Karphi is like this, and the usual accoutrements of cult associated with the worship of the goddess with upraised arms (snake tubes, figurines, plaques) are missing. The two preserved kalathoi show traces of interior burning and may have contained coals, aromatics, or burned offerings. The rhyton, used for pouring liquid libations into the ground or into a vessel below, represents a different sort of ritual activity from offering on a stand, where the offering is raised up from the earth; libation from a rhyton may thus indicate that a different deity or aspect of a deity was being honoured (a fertility or underworld divinity) or that the ritual was expected to produce a different result from offering on a stand or setting up figurines.90 There is nothing from this room that looks particularly early in date, although the deep bowl K27.1 finds some parallels with Kastri, which is early LM IIIC. The decoration on the rhyton K27.3, with its combination of curvilinear fringed motifs and some linear decoration could be later.

Room K 28 This small room had no connection with the other rooms. It lacks doorways and was much denuded. The notebook suggests that there may have been a cupboard in the northeast corner. Pottery mentioned in the notebook includes the following: a pithos with chevron bands; a pithoid jar rim with rope-slashed ridge below the rim; tripod bowls, one shallow, one small red; at least seven kalathoi, one with a high pedestal; and a kylix stem. There was a good deal of pottery in the boxes that was not catalogued, including five deep bowl fragments (with multiple arcs, spirals, floral motifs, and bands), a krater fragment with bands, a stirrup jar with a scalloped loop and fringes, and a medium-coarse handle of blue ware (sampled KAR 06/26). The fine decorated krater pictured in Seiradaki was not located.91 The only object found in this area was a cylindrical terracotta spindle whorl (351) found in the cleaning of rooms K 24-K 28. There is little here to indicate the function of this small room, nor is its date clear. The deep bowl with quirk could belong to any phase of LM IIIC. The tankard rim is almost identical to one from K 23. The bird vase may belong to LM IIIB. The kalathos is unusual for its projections on the rim, and finds no parallels. The decoration on the missing krater resembles motifs on early LM IIIC kraters. Pottery Catalogue: K 28 Fine Wares K28.1 Deep bowl or cup (FIG. 4.21). Max. pres. H. 3. Single fragment from body.

The pottery was reported to be as usual, but nothing was recorded in the notebook, nor were any sherds found from this location. Room K 43 This room was thought to belong to the earliest phase of the block. It was entered from K 44, probably by a door in the southeast corner. Only one vessel was mentioned in the publication, a pyxis of Type 4 (K43.13).92 The notebook records the following additional pottery: ajar with in-turned rim (K43.16), a rounded cauldron with coil pattern in relief on shoulder (tripod cauldron), fragments of three large stirrup jars (K43.17), a burnt jar with out-turned rim, a very fine painted tripod cauldron with short legs, and an unusual rim. The painted tripod was illustrated by Seiradaki,93 but was not located in the storerooms of the museum. The boxes produced a number of fragments that were not catalogued: deep bowls (plain or decorated with oblique strokes, spirals, or multiple arcs), two kylikes, two stirrup jars with curvilinear motifs and dotted filler arcs, and a jug or jar of coarse fabric with bands. There were few other objects in the room; only a fragment of a large conch shell (347) was recorded. The pyxis (K43.13), kalathos (K43.14), and stirrup jar (K43.17) are reasonably complete and may be representative of the material in use at the time the room was abandoned. They are not particularly helpful either in determining date or function for the room. Most of the decorated fine ware is fragmentary, and Karphi, 82.

The cup or deep bowl with stemmed spirals (K43.1), for example, finds close parallels among LMIIIB pottery at Knossos,94 but also appears in LM IIIC contexts there and at Phaistos.95 The Minoan flower on deep bowl or cup K43.2 resembles examples on LM IIIB pottery from Knossos96 and LM IIIB-C pottery at Phaistos.97 The bivalve shell on deep bowl or cup K43.7 is another motif that is common in LM IIIB and also in early LM IIIC, for example at Kavousi-ATastro.98 Deep bowl or cup K43.3, with its multiple pendent loops, finds parallels in early LM IIIC deposits at Kastelli Pediada and Knossos.99 Kylix K43.8, however, looks later. Some of these deep bowls were doubtless around from the earlier phases of the building's use. The pottery confirms the excavators' idea that this room belonged to the earliest use of the area of the Southern Houses, very early in LM IIIC.

Scale 1:3.</page><page sequence="134">THE SOUTHEAST QUADRANT Room K 44 The excavators believed that this room was some sort of public structure fronting onto square K 48, and they likened it to a kapheneion in a traditional Cretan village.100 It was added at an angle to the already existing rooms of the building, possibly at the same time as the southern rooms were built (K 24-28). Wallace, however, on the basis of her more recent work on the site concluded that K 44 was not a later addition.101 It was one of the largest rooms on the site, and it was entered from K 48 through a doorway on the north. The notebook lists three pithoi, including many sherds from one in gritty yellow clay with chevron decoration; the usual pithoid jars; tripods; dishes; stirrup jars; kalathoi; a lid with pinched rope decoration (K44.9); a scuttle handle (K44.8); and fine ware. A great deal of pottery was found in the boxes but not catalogued. There were many deep bowl fragments, including rims with multiple pendent loops, spirals, and other multiple curvilinear motifs, a handle attachment with multiple pendent loops, and body fragments with spiral and other curvilinear motifs, one of them burned. A krater handle attachment was also found and burned stirrup jar fragments with filled triangles. Objects from the room included two conical stone beads (318, 319), a sandstone pounder (339), five cylindrical terracotta spindle whorls (313, 314, 315, 316, 317), and six terracotta spools (one large, five medium). Five of the spools have been preserved (plate 15c). They are all intact, with smoothed surfaces, almost burnished, and their colour varies from reddish yellow (5YR 6/8-7.5YR 6/6) to pale red (10R 6/4) where burned. They are approximately the same size and shape, 2.8 high and weighing 25-35 g. They look like a matched set. The pottery from this room consisted of small and broken pieces, with only one nearly complete vessel that may have been on the floor when the room was abandoned. This coarse jug (K44.10) belongs to Seiradaki's Type 3, one of the most common on the site, and it does not help to determine either the date of abandonment or the function of the room. The deep bowl or cup fragments have buttonhook spirals (K44.1), pendent multiple loops (K44.2), and floral motifs (K44.3) that appear both in LMIIIB deposits102 and in LMIIIC.103 The perforated lid (K44.5) finds a parallel in early LM IIIC Khania.104 This pottery suggests an early LM IIIC date for Room K 44. Nothing, however, supports the idea of a public function for the room. Pottery Catalogue: K 44 Fine Wares K44.1 Deep bowl or cup (PLATE 1 a, fig. 4.24). D. rim est. 14-15.

The pottery found in it was reported as usual, except that there were few pithos sherds.105 The notebook provides no additional information on the pottery. Uncatalogued sherds in the boxes included two body fragments from deep bowls, one with bands, one with a curvilinear decora tion, and two stirrup jar fragments with bands. Other objects from the room included two terracotta spindle whorls, one conical (323), the other cylindrical (322) in shape, and seven spools (two large, five medium). Two of the spools are still preserved (PLATE 5 c). They are approximately the same size and weight (75 g), but one is chipped. All of the pottery from this room is small and fragmentary. It probably represents discarded material on the floor or embedded in it. The deep bowls or cups all look early in LMIIIC. The Minoan flower of K46.1 looks like examples from Knossos of LM IIIB,106 with its Y-shaped stamen, but the IIIB examples usually have the strokes for the 'petals' attached to the stamen, not as a separate arc; that is more common in LM IIIC.107 The rim of this bowl looks like examples found in the Phaistos area in LM IIIB-C.108 K46.2 may be a mainland import, as it is not monochrome painted inside and has only a narrow interior rim band. The comb motif has parallels, however, at Kastelli Pediada, and LM IIIB Knossos.109 The body fragment K46.4 with its outlined quatrefoil in panelled pattern recalls an example from Phase II at Kavousi-fizs^ro.110 The fragments, then, look like early LM IIIC and fit well with the excavators' observations that this room belongs to an early phase of the settlement's history.

The pottery listed in the notebook included the following: variations on usual rim types for pithoi and pithoid jars with undercutting, a red pithoid jar with yellow-white slip, a tripod bowl rim, and a red jug with yellow-white slip and globular body.111 The jar of Type 7 illustrated by Seiradaki was not located;112 the stirrup jar fragment identified as from K 47 is actually from K 147,113 and another stirrup jar shown in Seiradaki is probably from Mikre Koprana (MK IE).114 A body fragment with handle attachment from a deep bowl with running spiral decoration was found in one of the boxes. Other objects found in this room included four cylindrical terracotta spindle whorls (324, 325, 326, 327) and a fragment of shell (328). Most of the pottery found in this room is nearly complete and may have been in use when the building was abandoned. The krater fragment (K47.1), however, may be an earlier piece. The stirrup jar (K47.2) is of an unusual carinated shape, and its best parallels can be found in LM IIIB;115 it is a shape that was not popular in LM IIIC, but does appear in early LM IIIC deposits 105 Karphi, 82. 106 Popham 1970Z&gt;, 200, fig. 3.33, pi. 49a. 107 Popham 1965, 328, fig. 7. 108 Watrous 1992,109, fig. 68.1921; Borgna 1997a, 278, fig. 6.6. 109 Rethemiotakis 1997, 318, fig. 271; Popham 19706, 200, fig. 3.41. 110 Mook and Coulson 1997, 352, fig. 18.55, 59, 63. 111 Karphi, 83. 112 Seiradaki, fig. 3.7. 113 Seiradaki, fig. 22g. 114 Seiradaki, pi. 6c, left. 115 Watrous 1992,81, fig. 52.1397 (Kommos); Marinatos 1920— 21,155, fig. 1 (Milatos); Kanta 1980, fig. 55.5 (Kritsa), fig. 73.3 (Zakros); Catling 1968, 121.29, fig. 5.</page><page sequence="137">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINA TION IvXvlvlvl-lvX'XvX K46.1 7 K46.2 K46.3 K46.4 K46.5 K46.6 K46.7 K47.1 M Vi^ * K47.2 Fig. 4.25.

Material from these three rooms may represent earlier material from the street rather than vessels belonging to the use of the rooms. The notebook reports that the pottery was much broken. In addition to the sherds from a strainer mentioned in the publication, the notebook lists only a lid with loop handle (K45.8) and a tripod leg in gritty blue ware. The boxes produced a good deal of pottery that was not catalogued, including a deep bowl with vertical strokes, a burned krater fragment with multiple outlined rayed decoration and another with multiple arcs, a bowl with a pinched out spout, and a stirrup jar with a crosshatched motif. Other objects found in the room included a conical stone bead or whorl (373) and a cylindrical terracotta spindle whorl (350). The pottery is in fragments; there are no nearly complete vessels from this room. The deep bowls or cups look early LMIIIC; K45.1 with its lozenge with chevron filler and slightly out-turned rim resembles fragments from Archanes of LM IIIA2 date,117 but similar motifs also occur in early LM IIIC deposits. The two fragments of kraters with spirals (one running, the other buttonhook) (K45.4, K45.5) also look early, as does the slightly concave and raised base of a deep bowl (K45.3).

Room K 50 Another small chamber built over curving street K 45 50-51, K 50 was entered from K 47. The pottery was reported as usual, but much broken, except for the two catalogued jugs. The notebook records also five pithoi, and in the boxes were fragments of a large jug or jar with crosshatched lozenges and a fine tray fragment. The dish published by Seiradaki was not located.118 Other objects in the room included a terracotta spool and two terracotta spindle whorls, one biconical (348), the other cylindrical (356). The jug and juglet are of the most common shapes on the site, and do not provide much evidence for function of the room or for its date, but it is interesting that these two small compartments produced only vessels used in drinking and pouring.

Room 51 The final room of the three small chambers built over the curving street K 45-50-51 had little of note. The notebook records that the pottery was as usual, but all the sherds were small and worn, and there were few pithos fragments. In addition to the deep bowl and jug catalogued below, there were two body sherds from deep bowls, one with a spiral, the other with blob decoration. No other objects were found in the room. The deep bowl looks late, with its rather high concave foot and handles set high on the body; it finds a parallel at Kommos, where it is dated to LMIIIC, and it is also similar in shape to deep bowls from Phaistos, Knossos, and Khamalevri.119 The juglet is very similar to the one from K 50, although its base is flat.

Room K 49 This room, with its two doorways onto streets or squares was interpreted by the excavators as a public structure fronting on square 48.120 It has a doorway onto the square and possibly another door on the north onto the road (K 54). The pottery was described as usual, and the notebook only adds that all types were present and that there were several examples of a yellow slip on rough red clay A deep bowl with multiple loops was found in one of the boxes, but not catalogued. Other objects found in the room were two fragments of bronze (345), a conical stone bead or whorl (343), a pierced steatite disc (344),121 and three cylindrical spindle whorls (340, 341, 342). There was little to indicate anything but an ordinary domestic function, despite the location of this room. The krater with running spirals K49.1 is unusual, as most kraters have more elaborate and complicated decoration, but parallels can be found from a dump of Phases I—II at Kavousi Kastro,122 so this vessel may belong to early LM IIIC.

BROAD ROAD NORTH OF SOUTHERN HOUSES (ROOMS K 52-K 54) Again, few traces of paving remained in this area, but between K 53 and K 54 was diagonal row of blocks to break the water flow, and the space was interpreted as a road with only a slight gradient.123 A few blocks were preserved next to Wall 59, and these may have been either remains of the paving or part of an earlier structure. The very fragmentary nature of the pottery recorded from this area supports the identification as a street. Room K 52 The pottery from this area was much broken, but no other information was provided in either the publication or the notebook; the notebook only says that the pottery is exactly as from K 51. Not much survives except for a few fragments of fine ware. In addition to the catalogued pottery, there was a fragment of a deep bowl with bands and the added disc and base of the false spout of a stirrup jar decorated with a filled curvilinear motif. Objects included two cylindrical spindle whorls (353, 520) and the point of a bone implement (352). None of the pottery is closely datable, since it is so fragmentary. The deep bowl or cup with spiral and multiple stems (K52.4) is like an example from Phaistos.124 Krater K52.6 has a good parallel at Kastri in early LM IIIC,125 while krater K52.5 resembles one at Kastelli Pediada.126 Spiral and floral motifs run throughout the settlement history, but these fragments look early in LM IIIC. 123 Karphi, 83. 124 Borgna 1997a, 278, fig. 6.7. 125 Kastri, 287, fig. 8t. 126 Rethemiotakis 1997, 312, fig. 15b.</page><page sequence="143">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION Pottery Catalogue: K 52 Fine Wares K52.1 Deep bowl or cup (FIG. 4.29).

Area K 54 This area was not a room, but another road linking K 53 to square K 10-K 32 and K 48. In addition to the catalogued pottery, there was also a small fragment of another deep bowl with a spiral and a krater fragment with bands. A fragment of a bronze knife (358), a terracotta cylindrical spindle whorl (357), a conical stone bead (359), and a square pierced fragment of steatite (599) were also found. The pottery is scrappy and small, but includes the usual sort of material found in streets: deep bowls (here with zigzag), kraters (with outlined solid curvilinear motifs), a basin with bands in and out, and a stirrup jar with wavy line or octopus tentacles. The krater (K54.5) finds parallels in early LM IIC Knossos.127 There is nothing that looks late, and most of this material would fit well into early LM IIIC.

BROAD ROAD BETWEEN SMALL SHRINE AND PRIEST'S HOUSE (AREA K 56) Area K 56 This narrow street ran to the east of the Priest's House and turned west at the north of that building to separate it from the Commercial Quarter. The street may once have continued to the north but was cut off by the construction of the Baker's House. The paving seems to have survived here.128 The pottery was unusual only because of the apparent lack of pithos fragments. In addition to the ubiquitous deep bowls, the notebook also records stirrup jars, the spout of spouted jug,129 two krater bases ofType 3, a lid ofType 4, and a large krater base. Uncatalogued pottery included one handle and one burned body sherd with arcs as filler from deep bowls, a krater fragment, a cooking tray with scalloped rim, a double round horizontal (bucranium) handle,130 a tripod leg with dints, and a strange fragment that may have come from a chalice or a goddess. Objects found here included a fragment of bronze (413), a conical stone bead (412), and a cylindrical terracotta spindle whorl (361). 127 Warren 2007, 341, fig. 6.P2146. 128 Karphi, 89. 129 Published in Seiradaki, fig. 9.9, but missing. 130 One of two pictured on Seiradaki, pi. 12a.</page><page sequence="144">THE SOUTHEAST QUADRANT 12-13 K52.1 K52.2 K52.3 I K52.4 .n.f.ir.jf m K52.5 K52.6 K54.1 K54.2 I 1 I I J K54.3 K54.4 K54.5 K54.6 Fig. 4.29.

THE SMALL SHRINE (ROOMS K 55, K 57) This small, two-room building was identified as a minor shrine by the excavators because of its location and contents.131 It certainly is not a shrine of the goddess with upraised arms, like the Temple, K15-17, or K 116. Its location off the square (K 32), and road K 54 does suggest a public function, and the snake tube and clay altar suggest a religious function, perhaps similar to that of K 58.132 Room K 57 This small room was entered from court K 32, and there was a possible second entrance on the south. The floor of the room was of bedrock, and there was no trace of clay floor or of roofing material, so it was identified as another unroofed shrine. Although the pottery was of the usual sort, there was little fine ware. The notebook adds the following pottery: sherds from two pithoi, one with pinched rope at rim and chevron below, the other with wavy rope between horizontal bands; pithoid jars; tripods; dishes; kalathoi; a scuttle (K57.5); a kylix in coarse ware; and a jug with a projection below the spout and braided handle in coarse red ware. Material from this room found in the boxes but not catalogued includes three body fragments from deep bowls, one with spirals, one with a curvilinear pattern, one with bands; a small medium-coarse jug decorated with a wavy line; a horizontal basket handle; and a coarse bucranium handle with rope decoration. A cooking pot or jar was also not catalogued; 75 fragments from the flat base of this vessel were preserved in a coarse fabric with frequent red and grey phyllites and hard white angular inclusions. The terracotta altar and fragments of a cylindrical stand were also not catalogued.133 Other objects from this room included three terracotta spindle whorls, two cylindrical in shape (362, 363), one biconical (364). The pottery from this room was scanty and not closely datable. Of the deep bowl fragments, one (K57.1) has a decoration of multiple stems that would fit into any phase of LMIIIC. K57.2 is a slightly raised and concave base with a spiral painted on the interior; such a design is rare, but can be paralleled on deep bowls from Khania-ftzste///,134 where they seem to come from levels earlier than LM IIIC, and from LM IIIC Kastelli Pediada and Phaistos.135 The shape of the base looks early. The jar fragment (K57.6) finds no parallels among LM IIIC coarse shapes and decoration, and it may represent a later intrusion. The only whole vessel found on the floor was the jug, which, with its linear design, looks very late in LM IIIC; again, no exact parallel can be found. The decoration looks later than that found on the altar, with its alternating arcs, filled triangles, and horns of consecration. The altar may have religious significance, as suggested by its horns of consecration and the animal figurines on the top, but it also is related to the less elaborate fenestrated stands found in other LM IIIC sites, Kavousi-Vronda in particular.136 Pottery Catalogue: K 57 Fine Wares K57.1 Deep bowl or cup (FIG. 4.30).

Room K 55 The second room of the small shrine was on a higher level, and there must have been steps leading up to it from K 57. It had no independent entrance. The excavators mention a buttress in the southeast corner of the room, and it is possible that this was a small platform, like those found at Kavousi-Frcwda.137 Little was found in the room. The publication mentions the neck of a jug with a projection below the spout, and Seiradaki illustrates a one-handled jug of Type 9;138 it could not be located. The pithoid jar published by Seiradaki is actually the pithos catalogued below (K55.3).139 The notebook adds the following information. There were sherds from three pithoi: one of reddish clay with a serpentine rope pattern and an overhanging rim with pinched rope below (perhaps pithos K55.3), one with a similar rope pattern and darker clay, and one of red clay with oblique strokes incised on bands. There were also three pithoid jars, tripods, kalathoi, and dishes, one with upright sides and finger dents at rim. Two deep bowl fragments were found in the boxes but were too small to catalogue; one was decorated with a spiral, the other of very soft fabric had an undetermined curvilinear motif. Also found in the room was a bronze chisel (411),140 a pierced schist plaque (360),141 and a cylindrical terracotta spindle whorl (374). Nothing found in this room seems to have anything to do with ritual. The function of the room remains a mystery, although it may have served as a storage chamber. The pottery is not datable, nor is there enough to suggest that this was a deposit left on the floor when the settlement was abandoned. Pottery Catalogue: K 55 Fine Wares K55.1 Krater (FIG. 4.30).

In the earlier stages of the settlement's development, the building had direct access to the Temple through the street that once ran between K 52 and K 72, which was later cut off by the construction of the Baker's House. The small room K 58, which produced ritual equipment, was built up against its south wall and was therefore interpreted as belonging to the building, although not directly accessible from any of the rooms. More recently, Nowicki suggested how this building might have functioned as an ordinary domestic unit,2 although it is almost as large as the Great House, and if not religious in nature was still likely to have been an elite building. Wallace's restudy of the architecture of this house indicated that modifications were made to the structure over the life of the settlement; she suggested that either there were two houses later joined together by a doorway knocked in the wall between K 61 and K 80, or that K 80 was added on after K 61,3 The largest room (K 61) was entered on its long side from the street (K 56). This room gave access to either the large room K 80 or the smaller room K 60, through which K 59 could be reached. Room K 58 was backed up against K 80, but this small room was apparently not accessible from the building; Wallace was unable to confirm this fact based on the existing evidence on the site.4 The size of the building and the finds from it suggest that it was the dwelling of an elite individual or family, and like the Great House it was situated close to religious structures: the small room with offering stands (K 58) and the Small Shrine (K 55-57) across the street. Room K 58 Room K 58 was not connected to the main part of the building, and the only entrance into it was from the street (K 52). It appears to have had a public function, one possibly controlled by the inhabitants of the Priest's House. Ritual objects were found in the southeast corner. The notebook records the following coarse pottery, which was much as usual: many pithoi, but without rims; at least eight kalathoi, four of Type 1, four more like Type 1 but with plain bases; tripod legs; ajar of Type 7; several dishes of Type 6; and a small jar of red ware with a white slip. The fine ware is said to have been found below the level of the coarse ware and of the cult objects, and the notebook lists eight bowls of Type 1 (the rounded deep bowl), six with painted decoration; a bridge-spouted bowl; a stirrup jar of Type 2; a small krater of Type 1; a cup of Type 1; the base of cup in blue ware; one very upright base; and a triple handle. No pottery other than the pieces catalogued below was found in the boxes. Objects found in this room, in addition to the two stands, included only a fragment of bronze (416) and two terracotta spindle whorls, one conical (414), the other cylindrical (415). This is a peculiar assemblage, and it is unfortunate that the rest of the pottery was not preserved. The fine wares were at lower level and may represent material earlier than that in use at the time of the abandonment of the settlement. What is preserved are two unusual stands, one kalathos (out of eight found), a scuttle, and a small cup that was once attached to another vessel. The combination of stands, kalathoi, and scuttles also occurred at the shrine at Kavousi- Vronda,5 where they were found associated with terracotta statues of goddesses with upraised arms, as is customary. The stands were probably used to hold kalathoi containing offerings. The stands themselves are both unusual; one is rectangular, the other round but with only two round horizontal handles in place of the many vertical ones that usually wind up the sides of these vessels. If this room was indeed a shrine, it did not house the same sort of ritual activities as the others at Karphi (the Temple, K 15-17, K 116, K 106); offerings were apparently made on the stands, but not in the presence of the goddess, represented by her terracotta images.6 1 Karphi, 84. 2 Nowicki 1999, 149-50. 3 Wallace 2005, 243. 4 Wallace 2005, 244. 5 Gesell, Day, and Coulson 1995,79-80; Gesell, Glowacki and Klein forthcoming. 6 Day 2009, 144.</page><page sequence="149">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION The small size of the room suggests that the ritual activities carried on in it were not intended for the large groups that could be accommodated in the Temple and the open area outside it.

Room K 61 Room K 61 was the largest and main room of the complex. It was entered from the street (K 56) on the east over a high threshold.7 The floor was of clay over bedrock, with carbonised wood in the cracks in the rock that may represent the remains of earlier structures. A low bench made up of flat stones lay along the west wall over the carbon, and also over earth. Although no traces were found of interior supports, there was ample roofing clay to show that the room was roofed. The room may originally have been wider; the wall that runs under K 83 and K 84 may represent an earlier wall for K 61. There were three deposits in the room, one above the roofing debris, one on the floor, and a lower deposit below the floor. These deposits were listed separately in the notebook, but in the publication the material from above the floor and the floor were put together. The pottery has been marked only as K 61, so it is difficult to determine from which layer any individual fragment came. Above floor the pottery was recorded as usual. Coarse ware included fragments of two or three pithoi, a number of pithoid jars, a basin of Type 4, a jug of Type 6, a red pyxis of Type 2, a jar neck with a vertical handle made of three cylinders (preserved in one of the boxes, but not catalogued), and an incised vertical handle. Fine wares were as usual, but there were no pyxides. Objects from this layer included three fragments of bronze (427, 428, 513), a conical stone bead or whorl (431), two conical terracotta spindle whorls (429, 430), and antler of red deer, horns of ox, and goat, as well as a boar's tusk. The floor deposit included sherds of pithoi, a jar of Type 1, and tripods of Types 2 (possibly K61.15) and 3 in coarse ware. Fine wares included a pyxis of Type 2 (possibly K61.12), a stirrup jar of Type 5, a dish of Type 7 with horizontal handles, and a basin of Type 5 with horizontal handles. The pyxis K61.12, cooking mug K61.14, deep bowl K61.2, and krater K61.ll came from this deposit, according to their labels. Other objects included bones. Below floor the pottery was of usual types but was much broken. The notebook mentions a small grey kalathos (probably K61.10), and a bridge spout, possibly the spouted bowl K61.9. Other objects from this layer included a cylindrical terracotta spindle whorl (432), 19 terracotta spools, and a piece of yellow colouring material. Most of the catalogued pottery is simply labelled K 61 and could come from any of the three strata. In addition to the vessels listed below, the boxes produced two deep bowl fragments (one with a spiral with tangents, one with fringed filler pattern), another possible deep bowl, and a rim with a dentil design. The preserved pottery does not give much hint as to its date, and there is the additional problem of not knowing whether a vessel came from below the floor, was resting on it, or was above the floor in the roofing debris. The lower deposit contained for certain the spouted bowl (K61.9) and the kalathos (K61.10). The shape of the side-spouted bowl, with its fringed multiple loops finds parallel in LM IIIC Phaistos and Khalasmenos.8 The 19 terracotta spools suggest that 7 Karphi, 84-5. 8 Borgna2003,452,pl. 26.5. l;Tsipopoulou 2004, fig. 8.13.92 225; for the shape, see also Catling 1968, 127-9, fig. 9.37.</page><page sequence="150">THE SOUTHWEST QUADRANT K58.5 (1:4) Fig. 5.1.

On the floor was the tripod cooking pot (K61.15), which is a typical LM IIIC shape with a close parallel at Knossos;9 the Type 2 pyxis (K61.12) and the deep bowl with multiple loops (K61.2) also came from the floor. There is nothing that can securely be identified as being from the upper deposit, but the fine fragments (K61.3-8) may have come from here. The hatched inter locking ovals of K61.6 is an earlier LM IIIB motif,10 and the goblet stem may also be early. The excavators suggested that many of the pithoi, which were found on the roofing material, were used both for catching rainwater and as chimneys.11 The rest of the pottery is not clearly datable, but fits in well into LM IIIC.

The notebook records the following pottery: a pithos sherd with multiple triangles (like one from K 58), the twisted vertical handle from a large jar, a tripod leg with two dints, the handle from a kalathos, a little fine ware mostly from bowls, at least two krater bases, a stirrup jar neck, and a tubular spout (spouted jars 1 or 2). In addition to the octopus stirrup jar catalogued below, there was also a fragment of a plain deep bowl in one of the boxes. Objects included a fragment of bronze (417) and some animal bones and horns. There is not enough preserved from this room to give a date or particular function. The octopus stirrup jar should date to early in the LM IIIC period. Pottery Catalogue: K 59 Fine Wares K59.1 Stirrup jar (PLATE 17 c, FIG. 5.3). H. 15.5; D. base 5.2; max. D. 15.

LM IIIC. Room K 80 This rather larger room was reached from K 61, but it was at a higher level (some 0.6 m) and required a step.12 Some flat slabs found above the roofing were interpreted as having projected from the roof as eaves. The excavators suggested that the roof of this room rose above its neighbours and possibly had a clerestory.13 There was a ledge along west wall that rose 1.45 m above the floor level. The wall behind the bench showed traces of plaster. The remains of pithoi were more numerous than in K 61.14 The notebook reports that the sherds in front of the door (i.e. in K 61) were higher than elsewhere. The notebook records the following coarse pottery from the pithos area: at least eight pithoi, two of Type 2 and one each of Types 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, all with chevron and rope patterns, one with stacked triangles; pithoid jars of Types 7 and 8; a tripod pithos;15 a large jar or jug; a very large spouted dish; several dishes of Type 6; seven or more kalathoi, three of Type 1, two like Type 1 but with plain base, one of Type 3; a small kalathos; a dish of Type 2;16 a tripod rim of Type 3 and tripod legs; a large red stirrup jar; a smaller stirrup jar of Type 2; a large basin of Type 4; two scuttle handles; a small pyxis (K80.8); a lid (K80.7); and a large krater of Type 8. The finer pottery was mostly found below the level of the coarse ware, and included three pyxides of Type 1; three stirrup jars, one Type 1, two Type 2, one with a dotted bivalve shell pattern; a krater of Type 3 and smaller one of Type 1; the base of ajar of Type 2; a ridged kylix stem; and several small bowls of Type 1, one of blue ware, one with a pattern (possibly an uncatalogued body fragment from one of 12 Wallace 2005,243; Pendlebury (Karphi, 85) thought it needed a stepladder. 13 Karphi, 85. 14 Karphi, pi. 21.4 illustrates some of these vessels in situ. 15 Seiradaki, pi. 2b. 16 Seiradaki, fig. 6.2; pi. 3c right.</page><page sequence="154">THE SOUTHWEST QUADRANT K80.4 K80.5 K80.6 K80.8 £ K80.7 K80.10 Fig. 5.4.

The kylix is probably an uncatalogued one found in one of the boxes, and the stirrup jar has been identified with an unlabelled jug (K80.5). The following published vessels were not located: a nearly complete pithos,17 pithos fragments,18 a basin,19 and a tripod pithos.20 Objects found in the room included three conical stone beads (460, 461, 462), a crescent-shaped stone inlay (459),21 and a round stone object (458).22 Clearly, this room was used for storage, probably among other functions. The fine ware may have come from an earlier phase of the building, but the preserved pieces do not give much indication of date. Two fragments probably from the same deep bowl have spiral motifs, but they are not closely datable. The kylix, with its fringed and panelled decoration does not look particularly early in LM IIIC. Both the carinated pyxis and the kalathos are of unusual shape, although the kalathos finds a parallel in Khamalevri of early LM IIIC date.23 Pottery Catalogue: K 80 Fine Wares K80.1 Deep bowl or cup (FIG. 5.4).

CENTRAL WEST QUARTER (ROOMS K 66 K 69, K 81-K 88, K 96, K 97, K 100) The excavators distinguished four groups of buildings in this block.24 None of the buildings was large or had large rooms, like those found in the centre and eastern part of the site. All the rooms, however, produced a larger amount of bronze than usual and many bone pins. One building (K 85, K 87, K 69) was identified as a possible shrine because of the animal figurines found in it. Building K 66-67-68-81 This building is composed of three rooms, with a fourth long and narrow room (K 66) that may have served as the entrance to the complex. The precise relationship among the various rooms is difficult to determine because of the lack of doorways connecting them. Only one doorway exists, that between K 67 and K 81.25 17 Seiradaki, pi. la. 18 Seiradaki, fig. 1.10-13. 19 Seiradaki, fig. 6.2, pi. 3c, right. 20 Seiradaki, pi. 2b. 21 Karphi, pi. 30.3. 22 Karphi, pi. 30.4. 23 Andreadaki-Vlasaki and Papadopoulou 2007, 45, fig. 2.28 (Khamalevri). 24 Karphi, 89-92. 25 Karphi, 90.</page><page sequence="156">THE SOUTHWEST QUADRANT Nothing in the rooms distinguishes them or suggests functions; they seem to be domestic establishments. The amount of bronze found in this building is unusual and may suggest greater wealth than indicated by the pottery or architecture. Also unusual are the bone pins from K 67 and K 81; such objects are rare at Karphi, but many of the rooms of this quarter produced them. The surviving pottery includes some unusual pieces that may indicate the level of wealth, such as the elaborately decorated basket kalathos (K68.ll), or the date of abandonment, like the LMIIIC-SM wavy band cup (K81.1). Also of interest is the round-bottomed tripod (K68.14), a type of cooking vessel that has been interpreted as influenced by mainland types.26 Rooms K 66-K 68 (Surface) The surface material from over these three rooms was kept separate in the publication. Part of a conical stone bead (433) and a fragment of a steatite pestle (494) were found on the surface. A fragment of a fine cup, the spout of a stirrup jar in blue ware, and a tripod with five small holes where the leg attaches were found in the boxes, but not catalogued. Room K 66 This long and narrow room was perhaps an entrance passage into the building, and it may have given access over a raised threshold now no longer preserved, to K 67. The notebook records many fragments of a pithos with chevron pattern and pithoid jars of Types 1 and 2. There was apparently less fine ware than usual, but a fragment of a large kylix of Type 2 or 3 was found. The single preserved sherd, a deep bowl or cup with a buttonhook spiral, is probably early LM IIIC. Pottery Catalogue: K 66 Fine Wares K66.1 Deep bowl or cup (plate 12 c, fig. 5.5). D. rim est. 13.

Room K 67 The largest room of the building, Room 67, had only a single doorway into Room 81, so it is not clear how it was entered. The pottery included fewer pithos fragments than normal. The notebook mentions a larnax fragment with a handle, a coarse tray with incised lines on the rim, a tripod of Type 1, and a basin of Type 3. Objects found in this room included a bronze stylus shaped instrument (522), a circular base of schist (435), a conical terracotta spindle whorl (437), a terracotta spool, and part of a bone pin (521),27 as well as a lump of green mineral (436). The material found in the room suggests a normal domestic function, although perhaps with less storage than usual. The catalogued deep bowl, krater, and kalathos were fragmentary, not whole vessels that may have been on the floors at the time of abandonment. The deep bowl or cup (K67.1) finds a parallel at Sybrita/Thronos of early LMIIIC date,28 and although it has no close parallels, the krater (K67.3) also is early LM IIIC; it is close in shape to a krater from Khania of LM IIIB2/C date,29 while the decoration finds parallels at early LM IIIC Khamalevri.30 Pottery Catalogue: K 67 Fine Wares K67.1 Deep bowl or cup (fig. 5.5).

The pottery recorded in the notebook includes the following coarse wares: a pithos rim of Type 1, a kalathos of Type 2, a dish of Type 4 with a horizontal handle, and a coarse sherd with white on dark decoration. Fine wares came mostly from deep bowls, but also included a bowl with wavy line (perhaps the cup K81.1), a basin of Type 6 with dark concentric circles inside the base, a krater sherd with U-pattern, a base with ridges at the bottom, and the spout of a jug. Uncatalogued pottery included five deep bowl rims, one with spiral and stacked scale pattern, the others with horizontal curving bands, curvilinear motifs, and plain surface, and other body fragments, one with a spiral. The boxes also included three stirrup jar fragments with fringed or filled motifs and narrow bands enclosed between thicker bands and a coarse jar or jug with a curvilinear filled motif. Objects included a stone Neolithic axe (464),31 a twisted bronze fibula 26 Borgna 19976, 200. 27 Karphi, pi. 28.4. 28 Prokopiou 1997, 379, fig. 20b. 29 Khania II, pi. 41.84-P 0719. 30 Andreadaki-Vlasaki and Papadopoulou 2007, 46, fig. 3.23 (Phase lb). 31 Karphi, pi. 30.2.</page><page sequence="157">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION K66.1 K67.3 K67.2 K81.2 K81.3 K81.1 K81.5 K81.4 K81-82.1 Fig. 5.5.

There was also a strange double-ended object that the excavators thought might have been used in cult. Two larnax fragments are men tioned in the publication; one is catalogued below, while the other may be the flat plaque-like obj ect with the rim of a pithos found in one of the boxes. The boxes also produced a possible figurine fragment from this deposit. The cup (K81.1) is nearly complete and should be thought of as belonging to the final use of the room. It is an interesting shape, looking forward to the wavy band cups so familiar in Subminoan,35 but without the bell shape and high foot. This example is more like those from LM IIIC contexts at Knossos, where they are not particularly late.36 It is extremely large; there are other similar large cups from Karphi (K79.1, K115.1), and one from Kavousi-Frcwda,37 but they are rare, and their function is uncertain. The other pottery, a deep bowl, a kalathos, a krater, and some sort of closed vessel are LM IIIC types, but not closely datable. Pottery Catalogue: K 81 Fine Wares K81.1 Cup (FIG. 5.5).

Room K 68 Room K 68 was a small room, which the excavators thought was entered by a stepladder from Room K 67.38 It may have been a separate establishment. It had a hearth or oven at the south end between the wall and an outcrop of bedrock, where there were many signs of burning. Many pithoi were found in the room, one with a serpentine rope pattern. The notebook mentions part of the same tripod found in Room K 67 (possibly K68.14) and a large red stirrup jar (K68.13). Fine ware included two pyxides (K68.11-12), as well as two kraters, one of Type 1. Included in the boxes but not catalogued were the rims of two deep bowls, one with loops and vertical strokes, the other with bands, as well as numerous body sherds from deep bowls with monochrome decoration, oblique strokes, spiral, and multiple curves with dots. The boxes also produced a krater fragment with a curvilinear motif and a fragment from the top of a stirrup jar. Objects included a steatite disc with 'degenerate' Minoan characters (438)39 and a bronze ring (439).40 While the fragments (K68.3-7) may represent earlier material ground into the floor of the room, the rest of the vessels are nearly complete and probably constitute a floor assemblage for the room just before its abandonment. The fragments of deep bowls or cups look early, including the use of quirk, Minoan flower, and multiple ovals. K68.3, with its floral motif of dotted half circles with streamers on either side, is yet another variation on the tricurved streamer motif that so often includes a hatched or crosshatched motif in the centre. The linear pattern on K68.4 can be paralleled from a Phase II krater from Kastelli Pediada, so it is probably early LM IIIC.41 The fringed motifs and use of the U pattern on the kraters suggest a date toward the end of the early LM IIIC period. The nearly complete pots include two fine deep bowls, one with a wavy line, the other with a buttonhook spiral.

The elaborately decorated basket kalathos (K68.ll), however, is clearly a late LM IIIC piece, as may be the decorated pyxis with linear decoration (K68.12); the latter may have been decorated with birds, but is too worn to be certain. The tripod (K68.14) is unusual, but not unknown at Karphi: a tripod round-bottomed bowl. The decoration of the legs with two dints on either side of a groove with an incised slash, is also uncommon; the piece may not be local, as its fabric is a bit odd for Karphi, and the shape is inspired by mainland types.44 The coarse stirrup jar (K68.13) is of the usual type.

Building K 82-83-84-86-88 This group of rooms included two (K 86, K 88) that were apparently built over an earlier square.45 Two 42 Kavousi IIA, fig. 26.B4 P13; see also Andreadaki-Vlasaki and Papadopoulou 2007,46, fig. 3.6 (Khamalevri, Phase I); 50, fig. 7.15-16 (Phase lb). 43 Kavousi IIA, fig. 37.B7 P5, Andreadaki-Vlasaki and Papadopoulou 2007, 46, fig. 3.1 (Khamalevri, Phase I). 44 Betancourt 1980, 3 (Type B); Borgna 19976,201, fig. 11.5b (Lefkandi). 45 Karphi, 90.</page><page sequence="161">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION K68.14 (1:4) Fig. 5.7.

The relationship of K 82 and K 83 to the other rooms is uncertain. The architectural evidence suggests that the building was a later addition, carved out of space from the Priest's House (K 61) and the square. The extant pottery confirms the idea that this group was a late addition, as there is nothing that belongs to the earlier phases of LM IIIC, except the stirrup jar from K 83. At least three of the rooms produced bronze objects (K 82, K 83, K 88), and two of them had bone pins (K 82, K 83), like so many of the rooms in this quarter. Room K 82 Room K 82 was a small room with a bedrock bench, possibly remains of an earlier wall, along the west wall. The setback in its northwest corner may show the position of a door. The pottery was very broken, and included pithoi of Types 14 and 15, now missing.46 The notebook also lists in coarse wares dishes of Types 1 and 4 and a tripod of Type 1, and in fine wares two blob bowls (K82.1, K81.2), a bowl with wavy lines, the vertical handle of a bowl like that in K 81, krater sherds, and fragments of a stirrup jar. Uncatalogued pottery includes four body fragments from stirrup jars bearing crosshatched triangles or bands, two deep bowls, one with a spiral motif and the other possibly plain, a possible tankard fragment with bands, and a large jug or jar with broad and narrow bands. Objects found in the room included a bronze ring (481 )47 and bronze fragments (479, 480), a conical stone bead (482), and a bone pin fragment (478). 46 Seiradaki, fig. 1.14-15. 47 Karphi, pi. 29.2.</page><page sequence="163">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION The pottery is not closely datable. The deep bowl fragments, one with blob decoration, one monochrome, and one with a linear outlined motif could date anywhere in the period. K82.3 has a reserved disc and a rather high foot, which may indicate a late date; it is carinated, while the other deep bowls are rounded. K82.1 finds a parallel at Khamalevri dating to early LM IIIC,48 but also resembles a much later one at Sybrita/Thronos.49 Such a combination of shapes and decorations can be found throughout LM IIIC.50 The fragment of a decorated kylix is too small to make its shape certain, but the use of the reserved disc on the interior may indicate an earlier date; all of the later examples (especially the better preserved ones) at Karphi are without this feature, which does appear in the K 76 deposit (LM IIIC early). The krater, with its half medallion with strokes, and possibly a spiral finds no close parallels in decoration, but its rather shallow S-curved profile is similar to other kraters at Karphi that may indicate an early date (e.g. K49.1, K79.3).

Room K 83 The excavators thought that Room K 83 was a very low room to judge from the position of the door onto its roof from K 85, and it had earlier walls below the floor.51 The plan shows a small structure in the northwest corner that may have been a hearth or oven, but it is not mentioned in either the publication or the notebook. The notebook lists the following coarse pottery: pithos rims ofTypes 5 and 8; pithoid jars ofTypes 2, 3, 7, 11; tripod legs ofTypes 1—3, one of white ware with dark paint; a dish of Type 6; a kalathos of Type 4; a one-handled jug of Type 3; two basins ofTypes 6 and 7; the base of a cup of Type 1 and the rim of a cup of Type 2. Fine pottery listed included a krater base of Type 1. The following objects were also found in the room: a fragment of bronze (496), a bone pin (483),52 a pierced circular bone lid (535), a conical stone bead (536), pumice, and yellow colouring matter. The pottery from the room is scanty but unusual. The decoration on the deep bowl (K83.1) finds close parallels on kraters at Khania and Khamalevri of early LM IIIC date,53 but the shape, with its ring base, looks later. The stirrup jar (K83.2), with its lively fringed octopus, may have been produced early in LM IIIC; it is different from the other octopus stirrup jars from Karphi and has a more naturalistic octopus. A close parallel can be seen on a stirrup jar from Kritsa.54 The decoration on the pithos (K83.4) is most unusual. Pottery Catalogue: K 83 Fine Wares K83.1 Deep bowl (FIG. 5.9).

Objects included pumice and animal bones. The only surviving pottery is a fragment of a tripod bowl with an incised rim; although the round bottom is not unusual, the rim treatment is otherwise unattested at Karphi.

Room K 86 Room 86 was a later addition, built over the earlier square. It was suggested that it acted like corridor to K 84.55 The notebook records the following pottery: pithos fragments, one with chain moulding around base; a pithoid jar ofType 3; a dish ofType 6; tripod legs; a basin ofType 7; the ridged base of a jar; and deep bowls. Uncatalogued pottery includes deep bowl fragments with outlined curvilinear and filler motifs, a cup, a huge false spout from a coarse stirrup jar, and a large jug or jar with bands. No objects were recorded, but the notebook mentions animal bones. The single catalogued fragment, a krater with a Minoan flower motif, is small and not datable.

Room K 88 This room was also built over the former square; the excavators thought that it resembled K 58, but without cult objects; that is, it is a small room with a single entrance open to the square or street.56 The notebook records the following pottery from the room: a pithos rim of Type 8; pithoid jars ofTypes 3 and 10; ajar of Type 3; dishes of Type 6; tripod legs; basins ofTypes 1, 2, and 6; a krater of Type 1; bowls ofTypes 1 and 2; a stirrup jar of Type 2; and a one-handled jug of Type 3. Uncatalogued pottery included fragments from two deep bowls, one decorated with multiple pendent loops, the other with a fringed, outlined curvilinear motif. A bronze blade (497),57 a fragment of iron (498), and animal bones are also said to come from this room. There is nothing that suggests anything other than ordinary domestic use. The date of the material is not clear, although the fragment of a cup with blob decoration may indicate an early LM IIIC date;58 the vessel is similar to examples from Khamalevri of Phase lb.59 Pottery Catalogue: K 88 Fine Wares K88.T Cup or deep bowl (FIG. 5.9).

Building K 85-87-69 These rooms were possibly connected to those in House K 82-83-84-86-88 by stone steps in the west wall of K 84, no longer preserved, but seen in the profusion of fallen stone.60 This small, three-room building may have served a religious purpose. Two of the rooms (K 85, K 87) produced figurines; human and animal figurines were found in K 85, and a large terracotta horse in K 87; a hut urn came from K 69. This material is very different from that found in the Temple or the other shrines or religious buildings on the site, to judge from the nature of the ritual material found within. No goddesses with upraised hands were recorded, nor any snake tubes, or pinakes; there was only a single kalathos 55 Karphi, 90. 56 Karphi, 90. 57 Karphi, pi. 28.2. 58 Cups with blob decoration characterise the early LM IIIC deposits in Building B at Kavousi-Vronda; Kavousi IIA, fig. 25. 59 Andreadaki-Vlasaki and Papadopoulou 2007, 46, fig. 3.19. 60 Karphi, 90.</page><page sequence="166">THE SOUTHWEST QUADRANT from Room K 87. Whatever religious observances occurred in the building, they were not the same as those involving the large terracotta goddesses with upraised arms (as in the Temple, the Great House Shrine, or K116), or offering on stands (as in K 5 8 and possibly the Small Shrine), or libations (as in K 27).61 Room K 85 Room 85 contained ritual objects and has been identified as a shrine.62 It contained a small ledge in its west wall on which the ritual objects may have stood. It was connected to both K 87 and K 69. The publication mentions pottery in large quantities. Seiradaki illustrates a large coarse amphora with rope twisted handles as coming from this room,63 but this identification is probably an error; the vessel shown on this plate matches one that is labelled as coming from K 70. The notebook adds the following list of coarse vessels from the room: a pithos of Type 2, pithoid jars of Type 3, legs of four tripods, a jar of Type 1, a dish of Type 6, a tripod dish, a trefoil scuttle, two kalathoi of Types 1 and 3, a basin of Type 3, a large stirrup jar (K85.13), new types of basin, dish, and jar. Fine pottery included two pyxides of Types 1 and 2 (K85.5-6), two kraters of Types 3 and 2, a kylix base (K85.3), two stirrup jars of Type 2 and one of Type 7 (possibly K85.9), and several small bowls. Also listed were a fragment perhaps from a mould, a twisted handle, and a cup of Type 2. In addition to the catalogued pottery, the boxes produced the following fragments from this room: a deep bowl decorated with a vertical fringed panel, a burned rope-twisted handle of jug (probably the one mentioned in the notebook), and a large jar or jug with two wavy lines above three bands on the shoulder. An unusual array of objects came from K 85, as well. There was a bronze ring (505),64 a conical stone bead (506), a steatite disc (512), a flat stone tool, and a rectangular bone tube with punctuated decoration (507).65 Of great interest were the many terracotta figurines found in the room, including the head of a female figure (515),66 the torso of a figurine (504), another torso of a figurine that may originally have been in a kalathos (514),67 the head of a large hollow bull figurine (516),68 and a smaller similar bull's head (517). Such a collection of figurines has not been found elsewhere in any room in the settlement and indicates an unusual function. The room next door (K 87) produced more animal figurines. The notebook also mentions pumice and animal bones. Finally, the corner of a rectangular vessel with punctuated design, like the stand or altar found recently at Khalasmenos, was found in one of the boxes (PLATE 9 h). The preserved pottery represents an uncommon assemblage. The carinated stirrup jar (K 85.9) is of an unusual type; although the shape is not unknown on Crete,69 it is more common on the mainland.70 This example may be an import or made in imitation of mainland style. The juglet (K85.7) has a close parallel from Khalasmenos, possibly from a ritual context,71 and another similar example came from K 96 (K96.2). One of the pyxides (K85.5) is similar to examples from Kastri,72 while the decoration of the other, with its double row of running spirals, is without parallels, except on krater K26.5. The flask (K85.8) is another unusual shape; only one certain example of this shape comes from Karphi, from tomb M 16, which has SM PG material (M16.2). This example lacks the decoration that was standard on the SM flasks, and more closely resembles LMIIIB examples.73 The shape finds parallels from LH IIIB 1 on the mainland.74 The large coarse stirrup jar with incised decoration (K85.13) is also highly unusual, finding its best parallels farther to the west on Crete at Sybrita/ Thronos.75 The tray or basin (K85.12) is an unparalleled shape, and the basin or krater (K85.10) is also unusual. The possible religious function of the room is not evident from the rest of the pottery, which seems to include vessels for storage and cooking.

Room K 87 Room 87 was a small room entered from K 85, and it had an unusual rock table at its southern end, on which, according to the notebook, stood animal figurines. Pottery included a pithos of red fabric without its rim, two tripods or jars of Type 3, dishes of Types 1 and 6, and at least two fine kylikes, along with a jug with beaded decoration (K87.1). The boxes produced a small cylindrical object with ridges and a tile or rectangular object, neither of which was catalogued. The incised jug (K87.1) is highly unusual and finds parallels from religious contexts at Syme Vianno76 and at Enkomi on Cyprus, where it has been seen as an import;77 a similar example came from Afrati.78 D'Agata dated this jug to late LM IIIC or SM I;79 the height of the foot, particu larly in comparison to the examples from Syme and Enkomi, suggests a date in late LM IIIC. Of great interest was the large, hollow horse figurine80 and fragment of another animal figurine apparently found on the table (556). This may have been an area for ritual observance; the figurines are reminiscent of animal figurines from the Piazzale dei Sacelli at Ayia Triada, which produced a greater quantity and variety.81 Horse and bovine figurines, but solid and not wheel-made, were also found resting on a corner platform in Building D at Kavousi-FronJa,82 where they apparently served as objects of domestic devotion. If K 87 was a shrine, then it was of an unusual type for Karphi. Pottery Catalogue: K 87 Fine Wares K87.1 Jug (HM 11072) (PLATE 18 e, FIG. 5.12).

Room K 69 Entered from K 85, this small room had a platform of rock left in its northwest corner. A door to the east was thought to have led to the roof of K 81 and K 82. The pottery from this room was listed as being usual, and it included the rims of at least nine pithoi, none of which survives today;83 the notebook further records that the pithoi had all the usual patterns. The other coarse ware was in small fragments and included three pithoid jars, a jar, a tankard spout, and a bowl with knobs on the shoulder. Fine ware included a bowl with blob design like that from A1, two kylix bases of Types 1 or 2, and 83 Seiradaki, fig. 1.1-9.</page><page sequence="171">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION a lid of Type 5. Uncatalogued sherds include the medium-coarse blue ware spout from a tankard with incisions on the rim mentioned in the notebook, a small cup rim, a handle with a knob at the top, and a burned stirrup jar fragment with a solid triangle and dots. The large number of pithoi suggests that the room had a primary function of storage, and except for the hut urn (K69.2), there was no trace of the religious equipment found in the other rooms. The preserved pottery is not closely datable. The deep bowl shape could fit anywhere in LMIIIC, as could the blob or monochrome decoration. Hut urns are not closely datable. The presence of so many pithoi (9) suggests that the room was used primarily for storage. The surviving pithos fragment (K69.3) bears an unusual design for Karphi of impressed circles between rows of incised strokes; a similar design is found on a pithos from the West Magazines at Knossos.84 Objects included a bronze blade with rivet holes (448),85 an iron fragment (449), a stone implement (440),86 the fragment of a steatite bowl (441), three conical stone beads (442,443,444), and three conical terracotta beads or whorls (445, 446, 447).

Building K 96-97-100 The final building in the Central West Quarter consists of a three-room structure entered at the north from the Broad Road (K 103). This door was later blocked. Room K 96 This small room had a paving in its southeast corner on which stood a small pithos with a rope-slashed ridge at the base of the neck and a band with chevron pattern around the middle,87 in shape very similar to the small pithos from K 26. The pottery included very little fine ware, but at least three pithoi, one of Type 7 and two others, all now missing.88 Also included in the list of pottery in the notebook were two kalathoi of Type 1 and a dish of Type 7 with horizontal handles, as well as a krater with a scale pattern (K96.1). A flat, rounded, shallow object with horned projections found in the boxes is labelled K 96. Other objects included a possible bronze sword (500)89 and a boar's tusk.

Room K 97 The pottery from this small room included a large number of pithos sherds,90 and it may have been used primarily for storage. Other coarse ware recorded in the notebook included the possible base of a larnax, a pithoid jar of Type 11, dishes of Types 5 and 6, ajar of Type 3 or 6, a kalathos of Type 1 and tripods, one with slashed decoration. The fine ware was very fragmentary: a handle with incised chevrons, a doubly pierced lug, a small reddish lid of Type 3, a pyxis of Type 9 (sic) of soft pink clay, and a large upright red base that may be from another pyxis. The boxes produced the following uncatalogued fine vessels: three handles from deep bowls, one with a spiral motif, one with curved filler, and three body fragments from deep bowls, one with a panelled design, the others with fillers; there was also a jug or stirrup jar with wavy lines on the shoulder. Objects included a bronze knife with rivet holes (518)91 and a whetstone (519). Most of the pottery looks early LM IIIC. The deep bowl with lozenge chain (K97.1) recalls similar examples from Khamalevri, Kastelli Pediada, Phaistos and Knossos.92 Krater K97.5 also finds parallels in the 84 Christakis 2005, fig. 18c. 85 Karphi, pi. 28.2. 86 Karphi, pi. 30.1. 87 Pictured in situ, Karphi, pi. 21.3 and Seiradaki, pi. lc. 88 Seiradaki, fig. 1.17-8. 89 Karphi, pi. 29.2. 90 Seiradaki, fig. 1.19-20. 91 Karphi, pi. 28.2. 92 Andreadaki-Vlasaki and Papadopoulou 2007, 47, fig. 4.29 (Khamalevri, Phase II); Rethemiotakis 1997, 319, fig. 28af (Kastelli Pediada); Borgna 1997a, 280, fig. 15; 2003, 435, fig. 9.82 (Phaistos, LM IIIB-C); Popham 1965, 324-6, fig. 6.36 (Knossos).</page><page sequence="172">THE SOUTHWEST QUADRANT K97.4 K97.6 K97.7 Fig. 5.13.

Room K 100 This room was once entered from K103 through a door way, later blocked, but the excavators suggested the possibility of steps also leading up into street K 105.95 A ledge lay on the north side, and there may have been a door to the roof of K 87. The pottery was recorded as usual, but with few pithos sherds and the coarse ware was much broken. Fine ware included bowls, at least three pyxides (one of Type 3) a spouted jug, a two handled jug of Type 1, a krater base of Type 1 in flaky stone-like clay, and a flat base. A fragment of a stirrup jar with filler arcs between curved streamers was found but not catalogued. Objects from the room included a pierced stone spool (541), two bone implements (542, 543),96 and a four-sided stone pounder (610).97 The preserved pottery is scanty, but the two deep bowls or cups look early; Hallager suggested that K100.2 is actually of LM IIIB:2 style,98 although its reserved band indicates a date in LM IIIC. Kanta labelled the motif on K100.1 a sea snail pattern, which she believed began in LMIIIA and continued into LM IIIC." The kylix (K100.3) can be paralleled by an example from K 106 (K106.16-17). The thelastron (K100.4) is of an unusual shape, being much squatter than normal; a similar shape (K.28) without a findspot was found in the boxes.

THE SOUTHERN SHELTERS (ROOMS K 62 K 65, K 90-K 95, K 98, K 99) The Southern Shelters were thought to be amongst the earliest remains on the site, interpreted as housing for the first inhabitants of the site that were later used as animal shelters.100 Architecturally, there is little to describe; they were simply walled up crevices in the bedrock. The pottery from these rooms is for the most part too fragmentary and scanty to give either a firm date for the use of these rooms or to help determine their function. 93 Kavousi IIA, figs. 27, 95. 94 Day and Snyder 2004. 95 Karphi, 90. 96 Karphi, pi. 28.4. 97 Karphi, pi. 30.1. 98 Hallager 2000, 174 n. 343. 99 Kanta 1980, 126, fig. 53.10. 100 Karphi, 92.</page><page sequence="174">THE SOUTHWEST QUADRANT Rooms K 62-K 65 The notebook lists the pottery from all these rooms together. The only coarse pottery mentioned is a lid of Type 1 in coarse buff clay. There was much fine ware, but it was very fragmentary; most came from bowls of Types 1-3. Other fine ware included two kylix stems, some stirrup jars, some kraters (K62.1, K62.2), a small trough spout, a spout as from tankard of Type 1 but with four holes making a strainer, and a rim with beading below, both in very soft buff clay, perhaps from the same vessel. There were no obvious pyxis sherds. Room K 62 Deep bowl fragments with vertical strokes and an uncertain motif that were found in the boxes are labelled as coming from this room. Other objects from K 62 included the head of a bronze stud (419),101 a bronze awl (420), a conical stone bead (418), and the head of a terracotta figurine (421).

The only other object found in this room was the hoop of a bronze fibula (422).102 Room K 64 A fragment of bronze (425) and two conical stone beads (423, 424) were found in this room. Room K 65 A stirrup jar top with a large hole through the centre is labelled as coming from K 65. Rooms K 90, K 91, K 95 Material from these three rooms was recorded together in the notebook. Coarse ware included the leg of a tripod pithos (as from K 80), some pithos fragments with chevron design, pithoid jars of Types 3 and 8, a large number of tripod legs, several dishes of Type 6, several one or two-handled jugs, three basins of Types 2 and 4, 2 two large kraters of Type 1, four stirrup jars of Type 2, two kalathoi of Type 1, several small bowls (one with a side spout), and a one-handled jug with knobs (possibly K90.3). Fine pottery included a small dish of Type 8, a pyxis of Type 1, a small lid of Type 1, a stirrup jar of Type 2, and several bowls of Types 1 and 2 (K90.1). Also listed were 15 terracotta spools, pumice, animal bones, and human teeth. The human remains suggest a burial in the vicinity The spools may have come from a loom in one of the rooms, as there were so many of them. Room K 90 The boxes produced at least two deep bowl rims, one with scallops and loops, the other with arcs or loops, and a body fragment from a deep bowl with arc filler.

Scale 1:3.</page><page sequence="176">THE SOUTHWEST QUADRANT The deep bowl fragments all look early; the buttonhook spiral and quirk are motifs that appear early and are less popular in late LMIIIC. The possible bird on deep bowl K91.3 may also indicate an earlier LM IIIC date. Bird-shaped rhyta like K91.5 are known in LM IIIB and later in Subminoan, but are not common in LM IIIC; this example looks like the more naturalistically decorated LM IIIB examples, where the design tries to simulate the markings on the bird's body rather than being schematic or geometric renderings.106 These early sherds, then, support the excavators' idea that these shelters were in use early in the settlement's history, although they are not necessarily the earliest examples found at Karphi.

A square stone tool was also found here.

Area K 101 No pottery was recorded for this room in the publication. In the notebook, the pottery from K 101 was put together with that from K 103 and Kill (the divisions among the areas being arbitrary). The notebook records pithoi: rims of Types 8,10, 14, 18; a base with chain moulding; and body fragments with various patterns, including diagonal slashes, vertical slashes, X-pattern, chain, and rope. Other coarse wares included: pithoidjars ofTypes 3, 7, 9, 10; several jars of Type 2; dishes of Type 1 with horizontal handle and Type 6 with a spout; tripod legs; basins ofTypes 1, 2, 3, and 7; two krater bases of Type 3; several two handled jars or jugs; a kalathos of Type 1; and three bowls, two of Type 1 and one of Type 2. Fine wares included two jars of Types 2 and 8, several krater fragments, bowls ofTypes 1 and 2, two stirrup jars of Type 2, a pyxis of Type 2, a small cup of Type 2, and a tankard spout of Type 1. The forequarters of a terracotta bull figurine with broken legs (611) were also recorded as found here, as well as a sherd from an altar and one from a goddess. A number of fragments from K 101 were found in the boxes, but were not catalogued, either because they were too small or worn or because they did not clearly fit into the category of pottery. A list of these fragments includes the following: a round, horizontal double handle, rather like a bull's head (bucranium);110 krater body fragments, one with fringed motif, one with spiral under handle, one with an upright leaf; krater rim fragments, one with a reserved band on top of the rim, three with fringed motifs on the exterior; two rims, two handles, and a body fragment with multiple upright loops from deep bowls; two stirrup jar fragments; a fine tile fragment; a square or rectangular object, possibly the 'altar' mentioned in the publication; a sherd with incised ridges; and a vertical jug handle. The pottery is made up of small fragments of fine ware, mostly from cups or deep bowls and kraters. The cups or deep bowls have a variety of motifs, including blob, quirk, tricurved streamer, multiple pendent loops, multiple oval with dot, spiral, and flower. The blob decoration of K101.3 seems to occur throughout Karphi, although it is particularly prevalent in the dumps under the Great House and Baker's House. Cups with blob decoration characterise the early LM IIIC deposits at Kavousi-Frorc^/a, as well.111 The quirk is a common LM IIIC motif, and the unusual example on K101.4, more like an S-pattern, can be paralleled at Kastelli Pediada and Kastrokephala.112 The tricurved streamer of K101.2 finds parallels in early LM IIIC deposits at Sybrita/Thronos, Kastelli Pediada, and Khamalevri.113 The multiple oval motif of K101.6 is found on a variety of vessels at Karphi, and it also appears in the dump of phases I and II at Kavousi Kastro.114 The flower and multiple pendent loops of K101.1 appear in a variety of contexts at Karphi, and this example resembles those found at Mikre Koprana (K149.3). Overall, there seems to be a good deal of material that looks early in LM IIIC. Pottery Catalogue: K101 Fine Wares K101.1 Deep bowl or cup (FIG. 5.15). D. rim est. 15. Single fragment from rim.

Rooms K 79 and K 89 contained only a few traces of roofing along the sides, so they were thought to be open courtyards, an interpretation strengthened by the presence of stone paving in both. The quantity of broken fine ware, similar to that from other open spaces in the settlement, further supports the idea that they were open spaces. K 79 led directly into a large room, labelled K 112 and K 78; room K 78 was at a lower level and required a step down, so was considered a separate unit. The long and narrow room K 77 was entered from K 78 through a doorway toward the end of the long wall, preserving maximum privacy. These rooms seem to have been for ordinary domestic use. K 116, a room entered through K 89, however, seems to have been separate and may have had a different function.2 It has been identified as a possible shrine because of the statues of goddesses with upraised arms found in it, and it also seems to have been used very late, judging from the pottery of very early SM style. Room K 79 Little roofing material was found in this room and that only around edges. It also had a 'tarrazza' paving, suggesting that it was probably open. The floor level was uneven, but was much lower than that in K 89. The published pottery included a pithos of Type 21, which is now missing.3 The notebook lists pottery from K 79 together with that from K 89, and most of the extant fragments are given the K 79-89 designation. Seiradaki also published the fragments of a tankard or pyxis4 and a krater with bird decoration5 as being from K 79; both of these were inscribed with the identification K 79-89 and so they have been catalogued with the pottery from K 79-89. Found in the boxes but not catalogued were a long handle with a plastic attachment, a fine handle with incised chevron decoration,6 and the ridged body sherd from a tubular vessel. Coarse wares found in the boxes included a pithos fragment with impressed circles and a tripod leg with incisions. Objects from K 79 included two bronze pins with twisted heads (503),7 the base of a stone vase (533), the head probably from a human figurine (501), and a cylindrical terracotta spindle whorl (502). The pottery identified as being from this room (as opposed to that from K 79-89) is quite fragmentary, and it probably does not represent a floor deposit. The large cup (K79.1) has parallels in K 115 and K 81 and looks very much like the SM wavy band cups from early SM Knossos and Sybrita/Thronos.8 The krater fragment (K79.2) with its fringed whorl shell or filler finds many parallels in LM IIIC, some of them early in the period;9 the shape is unusually shallow and resembles more the deep bowls to which it is close in size. The trays and tripod trays are similar to other examples from the site and from other LM IIIC sites. Of interest are the lugs on two of the trays and the rim of the third, which has been pushed in by fingers to make a wrinkled edge or spit stand.

Room K 89 As with K 79, little roofing material and part of a pavement caused it to be interpreted as an open space. Although this area was open to K 79, it was 55 cm higher than K 79 and the excavators suggested it could be reached from K 79 by a step.10 It is not clear why the excavators decided to combine the material from these two rooms, as in general they were careful to record the individual find spots. There was a large, stone-built oven in the southwest corner, similar to the one in the Baker's House, but smaller. The identification as an oven is not certain, however, since it contained no burned clay lining. The publication listed the pottery as usual. Seiradaki published a small jug of Type 5 from this room, but it could not be located.11 There were few objects found in the area; only a pierced schist plaque (614) is mentioned. Rooms K 79 and K 89 The notebook lists pottery from K 79 and K 89 together and provides additional information about what was found in these two sections of the courtyard. Coarse ware included at least four pithoi of Types 2, 5, 8, and 21, one with impressed circles; four pithoid jars of Types 3, 7, 8, and 10; the base of ajar of Type 7; a large jar of unknown type; tripod legs as usual; a tripod dish with crinkled rim (K79.7); several dishes of Types 1-6, the latter with spout and holes; a scuttle handle; two basins of Type 7; two kalathoi of Types 1 and 2; a large stirrup jar of Type 2; the base of a krater of Type 3; a lid of Type 1; and a small bowl of Type 2 with holes at the base of the handle. Fine wares included a tankard of Type 2 with beaded edges and double axe pattern (K79-89.24), a stirrup jar of Type 2, two pyxides of Type 3, a cup like that from Atsividero 3 (K79-89.1), several krater fragments of Type 1, small bowls of Types 1 and 2, a kylix stem, an 'egg cup', and a twisted triple handle. In addition, there was a great deal of fragmentary fine ware in the boxes that was not catalogued. From deep bowls came two rims with spiral decoration, two handles, and seven body fragments: two decorated with pairs of spirals, one with multiple lines, three with filler motifs, and one with bands. Other open shapes included a carinated kylix with curved strokes on the rim and a krater with fringed motif. Closed vessels included four stirrup jar fragments with spirals, fillers, and fringed motifs and a large stirrup jar. There were various types of handles from different vessels as well, including the vertical handle of a jug, a fine rope-twisted handle from a small vessel, and a handle on the interior of an open vessel. The notebook also records for this area the hand of a goddess, a terracotta spool, and two flat stone tools, as well as animal bones and a deer antler. The catalogued pottery consists chiefly of fine fragments from deep bowls and kraters; very little coarse ware has been preserved. The blob cup (K79 89.1) is a very simple shape that finds few parallels at Karphi; blob cups, however, are common in other LM IIIC sites, and at Kavousi-Frowcfa, they characterise the earlier phase of the settlement.12 A substantial amount of deep bowl K79-89.2 has been preserved, and it may have been in use just before the abandonment; the decoration and shape of the foot, however, places it in early LM IIIC. The decoration of upright multiple loops is common on LM IIIB deep bowls at Knossos and in vessels from early LM IIIC deposits.13 The decoration also continues into the later phases of LM IIIC at Kavousi-Aa.s'fro.14 It may be significant that K79-89.2 has both reserved band and 10 Karphi, 88. 11 Seiradaki, fig. 9.5. 12 Kavousi IIA, fig. 26. 13 Popham 19706, pi. 47e, 50a (Rnossos, LMIIIB); Kastri, 287, fig. 8:o; 288, fig. 9m (LM IIIC early); Warren 2007, 342, fig. 7.P183 (Knossos, LM IIIC early). 14 Mook and Coulson 1997,362, fig. 37.150 (Kavousi-&amp;wfro, Phase III).</page><page sequence="183">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION disc on the interior. A similar motif of horizontal multiple loops can be seen on K79-89.9 with parallels in early LM IIIC Kavousi-A'a.stro and at Knossos.15 The shape of K79-89.3 finds parallels in the earlier phases at Kavousi-Ajxvmy.16 The large fragment of a cup or deep bowl (K79-89.4) also seems early, as it has a similar shape to vessels at Phaistos;17 the unusual form of Minoan flower on this vessel has no parallel. K79-89.5 has a panelled pattern with vertically placed half-rounds that is very common in LM IIIC.18 Finally, the multiple stemmed spiral motif of K79-89.12 derives from LM IIIB motifs and is found on a number of early LM IIIC vessels.19 On the other hand, the fragment of a cup or deep bowl (K79-89.13) may have come from a wavy band cup of late LM IIIC. There are no parallels for the kylix fragments, but the fringed motif of K 79 89.14 puts it squarely into the fringed style of LM IIIC. There are a large number of kraters represented, all of them done in pleonastic style with fringes and fillers. Of particular interest is krater K 79-89.18, which was published by Seiradaki, but new fragments were found of the panel that the bird faces; the scalloped edges of the panel find parallels on kraters from a number of sites.20 The base of a kalathos or tankard (K 79-89.24) has a butterfly or double axe pattern that is common, particularly on early LM IIIC pottery. The decoration on fragments of a closed vessel, probably a stirrup jar (K79-89.28), is close to a stirrup jar from Khania, and it may have been imported from West Crete.21 The face on the possible rhyton (K79-89.29) is most closely paralleled by an example from Phaistos; such vases are rare, occurring only in the LM IIIB-SM periods, and the known examples are from the Mesara.22 The large amount of fine decorated pottery, especially of so many kraters, may simply be a result of chance; dumps often produce many fragments of fine vessels for drinking and mixing, if that is what the deposit represents. It is also possible that the kraters and cups were used in rituals related to the small shrine of the goddess with upraised arms (K 116) and that they were discarded in the court outside. They may, in fact, have functioned in outdoor rituals of the goddess that may have involved parading her statues.23 Pottery Catalogue: K 79-89 Fine Wares K79-89.1 Cup (fig. 6.2).

Room K 78 K 78 may have been part of the same room as K 112. To enter Room K 78, one had to step down from K 112. The pottery is reported as being much broken, and it included fragments from four kraters, including one with bird decoration from K 76 and K 77 and one with a tree from K 75.26 The notebook adds that there was also a pyxis sherd, a krater in gritty clay, another krater with a white slip, and some fragments of kylikes. Although there was a good deal of pottery preserved in the boxes from K 78, none of it was considered worth cataloguing and drawing. It included a deep bowl handle and a fragment with a hatched circle or spiral, kraters with filler motifs or curved strokes below the rim, a large jug or jar with a debased octopus design, a coarse jug or jar with a wavy band or debased octopus, and a vertical elliptical handle in blue ware. Few objects were found in the room; only a bronze stylus-shaped rod (499) is recorded. Room K 77 The floor of K 77 was at two levels, with a rock ledge in the northwest corner. The jar stand along the north wall may have been a fireplace, but there was no sign of burning. The pottery was listed in the publication as usual, and mentions fragments of a krater with a bird decoration, of which the larger remaining part came from K 76;27 These fragments were not located. The notebook added the following information about the pottery. There were some pithos sherds, many pithoid jars of Type 1, a two-handled jug of Type 1, a scuttle of Type 1, a lid of Type 1, a tripod of Type 4, a bowl, sherds from a 'tree' krater (the same as one in K 75), and fine ware mostly from bowls. Several sherds found in the boxes were not catalogued. These included a large strap handle, a tiny fragment from a kylix with vertical strokes on the rim, and a body sherd from a jug with filler ornaments on the shoulder. The pottery gives little suggestion as to the possible uses of the room, but it is interesting that there are joins with pieces from K 78 and from the neighbouring K 76, an area which con tained a large amount of fragmentary pottery, possibly indicating that this room was built over earlier material that also underlay the street K 76. The tankard or mug finds a parallel in one of the Ta Mnemata tombs (M4.7). The open vessel may be a krater, and its decoration does not find any parallels. The other fragments are from jars or stirrup jars with wavy lines, possibly from transport stirrup jars. Objects from the room included the following: part of a bronze rectangular rod (495), a bone pin (494),28 and two conical stone beads or whorls (457, 534); the notebook adds that there were no obvious animal bones.

Room K 116 This small square room had a rocky floor and a ledge along the north side, on which may have stood the terracotta goddesses found in the room.29 The publication mentions fragments of at least two goddesses, while the notebook says that there were three, two in white (i.e. buff), the third in red fabric. Fragments of a terracotta plaque were also found. Some of the fragments of terracotta figures of goddesses with upraised arms found in the boxes may come from this deposit, but none of these was labelled. There were no snake tubes found in the room with the goddesses. The other objects found in the room are ordinary domestic items: a grinder (607), a whetstone (627),30 and three cylindrical terracotta spindle whorls (624, 625, 626). The pottery included more whole fine vessels than general. In addition to the catalogued fine ware, there were at least three stirrup jars and six or more pyxides, including one of Type 4 with a small cup on the rim, here identified as a pyxis with no find spot written on it (K116.2). The kylix base published by Seiradaki as coming from this deposit could not be found.31 Coarse ware was said to be as usual, and Seiradaki published a scuttle as coming from this room, which could not be located.32 The notebook lists additional coarse ware from K 116. There were at least two pithoid jars with rims of Type 25 [sz'c], one with vertical, the other with horizontal handles, and a casual sherd from Type 21. Also found were four or more kalathoi of Types 1 and 2, another scuttle of Type 1, tripods, and a coarse vat. Fine ware included a bowl with dark bands (K116.7) Additional sherds from the boxes included a blue ware rim pinched to form spout (possibly the Type 8 blue ware jug mentioned in the notebook) and a lug handle. Two elements of this deposit stand out. First of all, it seems to be a small shrine of the goddess with upraised arms, since there were fragments of two or possibly three terracotta figures.33 Although there was also part of a plaque, the deposit lacked the snake tubes or offering stands that regularly accompanied such figures.34 Second, the pottery that has been preserved seems to be among the latest found on the site, especially the stirrup jar (K116.4),35 amphora (K116.3), and pyxis (K116.1).36Thejug (K116.6) is of a standard LM IIIC shape, with parallels at Knossos and on the mainland.37 Similarly, the jar finds a good parallel in early LM IIIC Kastelli Pediada.38 The stirrup jar (K116.4) with its high foot, however, looks later. The shape finds parallels at mainland and Cretan sites of late LM IIIC-SM date,39 but it is also close to a stirrup jar from a tholos tomb at Vasiliki which has been dated to EPG;40 the Karphi example, however, lacks the conical knob and the linear design on the shoulder still curves somewhat, so it should be earlier. The decoration of crosshatched triangles is found on many LM IIIC and SM stirrup jars, but usually in connection with other motifs; the use of bands on the neck of the spout instead of horizontal strokes makes it look earlier than SM, but that may be a result of local variation, rather than an indicator of date. A date early in SM seems indicated. The small amphora (K116.3) also looks late, although it is not certain whether the vessel is a jug, flask, or amphora. A similar decoration on a larger amphora can be found in the Knossos North Cemetery of SM date.41 Finally, it is interesting to note the presence of the blue ware deep bowl (K116.5), since a large number of mis fired deep bowls were also found in close connection with the Temple (K1); it is possible that these misfired vessels had some specific ritual association. 29 Karphi, 88-9. 30 Karphi, pi. 30.3. 31 Seiradaki, fig. 18.4. 32 Seiradaki, fig. 8, lamp 1. 33 Day 2009, 142-3. 34 See, for example, the contemporary LM IIIC shrines at Kavousi-Vronda (Day 1997, 401-2), VasiMki-Kephala (Eliopoulos 1998, 301-13) and Khalasmenos (Tsipopoulou 2001, 2009). 35 RMDP, 292-3, fig. 100.241 (Epidauros Limera, LM IIIC SM import). 36 For the general decoration, cf.

It may be that this shrine is a late one, in use at the very end of the settlement's history, perhaps when other areas or shrines had been abandoned. The presence of the oven just outside in K 79-89, however, together with the very fragmentary state of the goddess statues, suggests that at the end the room was not being used for ritual practices.

THE CLIFF HOUSES, EASTERN BLOCK (ROOMS K 75, K 110, K 118, K 119) The excavators had little to say about this building except that it was unclear how the rooms were entered.42 Only the foundations of the northern walls were preserved, almost at the level of the street that ran alongside them to the north. Room K 75 This room may have been entered from the street K 72 on the east. The pottery was listed as usual, and mention was made of two pyxides, one of Type 7 (K75.10) and one of Type 5 with a crosshatched butterfly (K75.9). The only pottery illustrated in Seiradaki, a cooking dish43 and an amphora,44 were both missing. The notebook provides the following additional information on the pottery. There were sherds from at least three pithoi and another in buff clay with chain and chevron patterns; jars of all types; tripods and basins; kalathoi, including one with base of Type 1 and rim of Type 3; dishes of Types 6 and 4; a lid of Type 1 but with incised lines only, a large red vessel, two-handled jugs of Type 3, and a scuttle ofType 1 (K75.13). Fine ware included a bowl, the two pyxides, and sherds from a krater with an orange 'tree' design (K75.7). Among the pottery found in the boxes but not catalogued were fragments of deep bowls (three with spirals, one with another curvilinear motif), a jug with a rope in the middle of the handle, a small burned jug with vertical strokes on the neck, a large burned jug with vertical strokes on the shoulder, a fine pithoid jar with a chevron on a ridge below the rim, and a coarse lid with ridges. Objects from the room included a bronze barbed arrowhead (454),45 a fragment of bronze (489), a burnished black bone pin (488), a conical stone bead 42 Karphi, 93. 43 Seiradaki, fig. 6.6, pi. 2g. 44 Seiradaki, fig. 8.3. 45 Karphi, pi. 29.1.</page><page sequence="192">THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT ^ 38S K75.2 -18 -12 K75.7 K75.9 / * K75.3 K75.4 K75.5 K75.6 K75.8 K75.10 K75.12 K75.11 K75.13 K75.14 K75.15 Fig. 6.6.

The notebook also mentions ox horns from this room. Much of the fine ware is in small fragments and may have been ground into the floor rather than being in use at the time of abandonment. Deep bowl or cup fragments have Minoan flower, arcs, scallops and panel, spiral, and blob or monochrome decoration; all motifs that were popular throughout LMIIIC. K75.1, however, has a type of Minoan flower that is common in early LM IIIC.46 One of the kraters (K75.7) has a close parallel for its decoration from Kastelli Pediada from the later part of early LM IIIC.47 The other (K75.8) shows a double axe between horns of consecration, a not uncommon motif.48 The pyxis (K75.9) has a good LM IIIC fringed style decoration, as does also the stirrup jar fragment (K75.ll). The carinated pyxis (K75.10) is one of only two found on the site. The two stirrup jar fragments (K75.14-15) are probably left over from earlier phases of occupation; the number of fragments was not sufficient to suppose that an actual stirrup jar still stood in the room at the time of abandonment (as was the case in K 110). The material from the room suggests an ordinary domestic function, with a krater, pyxides, and a scuttle in use at the time of abandonment. The bronze arrowhead suggests that the inhabitants had a greater level of wealth than the pottery might indicate. Pottery Catalogue: K 75 Fine Wares K75.1 Deep bowl or cup (PLATE 1 i, FIG. 6.6).

Pottery was listed as usual, but the fine ware inclu ded fewer deep bowls and more pyxides than was customary. The publication lists at least six pithoi and six pithoid jars, a jar with a medallion design (K110.18) along with a large stirrup jar with octopus design (K110.16) and a large pyxis in red ware with white slip (K110.5) with its lid (K110.7). The notebook adds at least four kalathoi (K110.12-15), tripods, and a knobbed jug. Fine ware included four stirrup jars (K110.9-10), one with a very flat shoulder, and a fluted bowl (K110.2). In addition to the catalogued pottery, the boxes produced fragments of deep bowls decorated with strokes on the rim or filler motif on body, or made of blue ware, and a fragment of a stirrup jar with bands. Objects found in the room included a piece of a bronze blade (525) and another bronze fragment (526), a bone handle (524),50 a conical stone bead or whorl (527), a pierced slate plaque (529),51 a MM steatite bowl and lid (530)52 with a frag ment of obsidian in it (531),53 a circular stone disc (532),54 a stone rubber (528), a conical terracotta spindle whorl (523), and more than 50 terracotta spools. This large number of spools suggests that there may have been a loom set up in this room, if spools were indeed another form of loomweight.55 The preserved pottery from K 110 constitutes one of the most interesting assemblages from Karphi, since so many nearly complete vessels were preserved, and there were few small fine sherds. The material certainly represents a group of vessels that were in use at the same time and at the end of the building's history. The fluted or moulded bowl (K110.2) is unique, and may have been made in imitation of palatial blossom bowls, which it resembles. The other deep bowl (K110.1) bears a decoration of multiple pendent loops and a lozenge with alternating strokes, similar to an example from the Kephala tomb at Knossos of very late LMIIIC date, but more organised.56 There are more pyxides than usual, and K110.5 is the largest example found on the site; with its large conical lid (K110.7), it begins to resemble later burial pyxides, like those from the Knossos North Cemetery.57 The fringed pleonastic style decoration, however, leaves no doubt that this piece belongs to LM IIIC, and it has a close parallel in size and shape to a LM IIIC example from Vrokastro.58 The jug (K110.8), while unusual in shape, finds a parallel in LM IIIC levels at Katalimata Khalasmenos.59 None of the material in the room looks particularly early, but none of it postdates LM IIIC; the latest piece is probably the stirrup jar K110.9, which with its fringed decoration is still in LM IIIC and not yet SM; the other stirrup jar (K110.10), with its fringed multiple loops finds many parallels among LM IIIC stirrup jars.60 A large number of coarse kalathoi are preserved. Three show extensive burning on the interior (K110.12, 13, 15), suggesting that they held burning matter, perhaps coals, while the fourth (K110.14) is burned on the exterior and top of the interior; perhaps it held unburned matter at the bottom, possibly oil for a lamp. Finally, the tripod bowl (K110.21) is of a unique type for the site, although known elsewhere on Crete.61 The huge coarse octopus stirrup jar (K110.16) is the sort represented by fragments from all over the site; it was probably used for storage and may have been produced in an earlier phase, since these jars when broken do not seem to have been replaced. There are no parallels for the jar (K110.20). The coarse lid (K110.19) was burned on one side on the bottom and was probably used for cooking; it finds a close parallel at Phaistos.62 The incense burner or firebox (K110.17) was one of only two found on the site (a fragment was also found in the material from the temple), and there are no parallels from LM IIIC. This may have been an earlier example that was kept as an heirloom. It is a standard type for the Neopalatial era, examples having been found in numerous sites on Crete and in the islands.63 Pottery Catalogue: K110 Fine Wares K110.1 Deep bowl or cup (PLATE 1 i, FIG. 6.7).

LM IIIC.</page><page sequence="200">THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT Room K 118 The excavators mentioned that a stone halfway along the north wall may have been a threshold, and that there was only a step between K 118 and K 119. No pottery has been catalogued from this room, and the publication only comments that there was little fine ware. The notebook, however, lists the following pottery: three pithoi of Types 3, 8, and 10; a pithoid jar of Type 8; tripod legs; at least five dishes, two of Type 1, three of Type 6 with spout and holes; a large krater of Type 3; a basin of Type 7; a kalathos of Type 1; small bowls of Types 1 and 2; and a small egg cup. Two rim fragments of deep bowls were found in the boxes, one with a spiral, the other with a fringed pendent multiple loop hanging from the rim, and two tiny burned stirrup jar fragments. Objects found in the room included a pierced schist plaque (612), five flat and two round stone tools, and animal bones. An ordinary domestic function and a date in LM IIIC seem indicated. Room K 119 This room may have been entered from K 117. No pottery has been preserved from it, but the publication states that there was little fine ware, all apparently from bowls. The notebook adds that the rim and handles of tripod of Type 1 and several dishes of Types 1-6 were also found. BROAD ROAD AND SQUARE (AREA K 117) This narrow continuation of the Broad Road (K 56) between K 61 and K 79 was originally a large square that was later reduced in size, and its exit uphill to the west was apparently blocked by the construction of K 86 and K 88; its northern section was labelled K 117.65 The published pottery includes the base of a bowl with compass-drawn circles.66 The notebook adds the following coarse wares: at least three pithoi, one of Type 9 and two ofType 10; a pithoid jar of Type 8; four tripods, two ofType 2, two ofType 3; tripod legs; several dishes of Type 6; two bases of jars or basins; and a small two-handled jug ofType 3. Fine wares included several bowls of Types 1 and 3, a large krater ofType 3, and an animal head handle.67 There was only one other object, a terracotta spool (547). In addition to the three deep bowls catalogued below, there was another with multiple strokes and a fragment of a stirrup jar with multiple-outlined rayed decoration. The deep bowls or cups are similar in design and shape to those found in K 101. The identifiable motifs of multiple pendent loops and flower seem to be found both in earlier LM IIIC deposits and later ones. Pottery Catalogue: K117 Fine Wares K117.1 Deep bowl or cup (FIG. 6.11).

LM IIIC THE WESTERN CLIFF HOUSES (ROOMS K102, K 106, K 113-K 115, K 120, K 121, K 126) Rather better preserved than the Eastern Block of the Cliff Houses, this block was divided into three separate buildings.68 The architecture of rooms K 113, K 114, K 120, and K 121 has been restudied by Wallace.69 House K 113-114-120 This was a three-room house on the eastern side of the block, with entrances from the road K 117 on the east and the road K 111 on the south and from the north from the Cliff Road. All the rooms were connected by doorways, none of them on the axis of the building. Room K 113 was open to streets from two sides, but the two entrances were probably not in use at the same time; the door leading into K 114 is not in line with either. Hence, the activities in K 114 would not be visible from either entrance into K 113. The door in the north wall of K 114, however, is aligned with the door leading out from K120 into the Cliff Road. There were traces of earlier walls that ran under K 120 and K 121, and it seems that K 120 and K 114 were built at the same time to replace this earlier structure, then K 113 and even later K 121 were added on; if this is so, then the pits with carbonised material found in K 113 may have been the remains of an open activity area that existed before K 113 was constructed.70 According to Wallace's observations, these structures were all built after K 102-106-115.71 Room K 113 The room had many entrances, but they were not all used at the same time. Originally the room was connected to K 114 and the square underlying K 89. When K 86 was built, blocking the exit of the Broad Road, a new door into the room from Kill was constructed on the south. The excavators observed that the floor of K 113 was lower than the street Kill, and 65 Karphi, 89. 66 Pictured in Seiradaki, fig. 14.4, but not located. 67 Possibly one of the two pictured in Seiradaki, pi. 12a. 68 Karphi, 94-6. 69 Wallace 2005, 229-33. 70 Wallace 2005, 229. 71 Wallace 2005, 229.</page><page sequence="201">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI — A RE-EXAMINATION Fig. 6.11.

Scale 1:3.</page><page sequence="202">THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT this discrepancy in levels suggested that the doorway was a later feature. The room contained a stone column base, and a second one was suggested; Wallace believed that these could have been stands for pithoi, like those at Kavousi- Vronda.72 There were many pits filled with charcoal in the floor, one of which was under the 'column base'. The excavators thought that these were the remains of the earliest habitation of the site and compared them to the remains of fires made by 'two Albanian murderers and the sheep-stealer of Ida'.73 Traces of a plaque floor were also observed, possibly remaining from an earlier use of the area as a paved open court or square. The pottery was described as usual, although the fine ware was much blackened with fire. In addition to the pottery catalogued below, the notebook also lists the following: three pithoi, one of Type 8, two of Type 22; three pithoid jars, two of Type 3, one of Type 12; several tripod legs; a large jar of Type 3; a large stirrup jar of Type 2 and a smaller one with a hole through its false spout; two kalathoi of Types 1 and 4; a lid of Type 1 (K113.4); several bowls of Types 1 and 2; a large, flat baking board (K113.5); and a spouted bowl. The fine ware included a pyxis ofType 2 (K113.1), a stirrup jar ofType 2 (K113.2), a spouted jug (K113.3), and a bowl ofType 2. The cooking dish pictured in Seiradaki was not located.74 Included in the boxes, but not catalogued, was a vertical handle with a knob on top, also mentioned in the notebook. The following objects were listed as coming from this room: a globular stone bead (549), a rectangular whetstone (604), two flat stone tools, a cylindrical terracotta spindle whorl (605), and animal bones, including a red deer antler. Most of the preserved pottery from this room is nearly complete and represents what was in use at the time of the abandonment. The list of pottery from the notebooks suggests the normal array of cooking and storage vessels. The coarse lid (K113.4), burned all over the bottom, must have been used in cooking, and the flat terracotta slab (K113.5) may also have been used in cooking, as the entire surface is blackened except for a roughly circular patch in the centre; it may have been used, as the excavators suggested, as a baking board.75 This type of thick, flat, terracotta slab is not known (or at least published) from other LMIIIC sites or from Crete at all, and all the Karphi examples come from the Western Cliff Houses, with the exception of one whose find spot is unknown. There was very little fine ware, and especially few examples of drinking vessels; the ubiquitous deep bowl was almost entirely absent from this room. Possibly the room was used for cooking and storage, but not eating and drinking. The three fine pieces found here included a pyxis, a spouted jug, and a stirrup jar. The pyxis (K113.1) is of the usual shape but has a rather more angular shoulder than usual; its linear decoration rather than the more elaborate figured or fringed motifs generally found on pyxides at Karphi makes it appear of late date. The stirrup jar (K113.2) is of good LM IIIC type, although poorly preserved and its decoration of half medallions with hatched ovals is similar to several LM IIIC stirrup jars from Crete and Rhodes.76 The spouted jug (K113.3) is a highly unusual shape for Karphi, although Seiradaki's Type 9 jug is a variation on the shape. Similar jugs come from LM III A and LM IIIB, and there is a parallel from Khalasmenos of LM IIIC.77 Pottery Catalogue: K113 Fine Wares K113.1 Pyxis (plate 21 a, fig. 6.11).

Room K 114 There was nothing unusual in this small room, except for ajar stand in the northwest corner. The pottery listed in the notebook included sherds from at least two pithoi with rims of Type 22, a pithoid jar of Type 1, the base of a basin of Type 4, at least four tripods, six kalathoi of all types, two jars ofType 3, a coarse stirrup jar, two pyxides ofType 3, one with accompanying lid (K114.3 5). Seiradaki mentions a third pyxis in addition to the two catalogued examples,78 but the notebook only lists two, and only two have been found. Objects included a bronze spearhead (550)79 and a cylindrical terracotta spindle whorl (606). As with K 113, the preserved vessels from this room are nearly complete and probably represent what was in use in the room at the time of abandonment, although the inhabitants may have removed finer and more portable vessels, and there may have been later disturbance. No deep bowls are represented here. Instead, there are two drinking vessels: a small conical cup and a monochrome carinated cup. The monochrome cup (K114.2) is an unusual shape for Karphi, although it can be paralleled by examples from Khania (where it is also unusual) and Khamalevri.80 Conical cups are very rare at Karphi, as in most LM IIIC contexts; K114.1 is similar to one from Ta MnemataTomb 16 (M16.1). The two pyxides are quite different from one another. K114.3 is ofType 2, with slashed handles. The decoration is quite uncontrolled, but the elements of spirals and fringed tricurved streamers and panels of chevrons are all LM IIIC date. K114.4, with its elegant depiction of two birds on either side of a double axe standing in horns of consecration, presents a marked contrast. It is of Seiradaki's Type 6, with handles beginning at the base and rising above the rim, and it has an interesting fringed and tasselled chevron between the handles. It is only one of two pyxides found with their accompanying lids, and this one is a simple flat lid (K114.5) with elaborate decoration of concentric circles with leaves arranged in a zigzag pattern and bands and dots on the sides. The two stirrup jars are also quite different; the small stirrup jar (K114.6) is of the usual shape, but its decoration is too poorly preserved to determine. The large stirrup jar (K114.7) is more akin to the coarse storage stirrup jar, although it is of fine fabric. It is globular, with a large flat base, and it has a concave disc that is pierced in the centre. A similar stirrup jar was found at Khania,81 where it was seen as an import from Knossos. The jug with knobbed decoration (K114.9) is in shape like many of Karphi jugs, and the use of knobs as decoration is also common on the site. As for the coarse ware, in addition to the storage and cooking vessels listed in the notebook, there was also a cooking jug (K114.10) with pinched out rim that from the extensive burning found on it must have been put directly in the fire frequently.

Room K 120 This room had a stone platform in the southwest corner, possibly part of the earlier wall that also ran under K 121. A wall may have once divided the room into two.82 The pottery was described as usual, but there was little fine ware and no pyxides. The notebook mentions sherds from a pithos of Type 21, three fine bowl or krater handles, a kylix stem of Type 1, and three stirrup jars, one of Type 6. One of these stirrup jars is K120.4, another no doubt to be identified as a fragment with a hole in the top found in one of the boxes but not cata logued. Another may be the one pictured in Seiradaki,83 which was missing. There were many objects from this room: a bone pin (603),84 a conical stone bead or whorl (601), a Neolithic stone axe (629),85 a pierced schist whetstone (630)86 and a pierced schist disc (649), one cylindrical (602) and one conical (650) terracotta spindle whorl, and a terracotta spool. The material from this room is consistent with a domestic function, but many of the vessels seem to have been fragmentary, perhaps debris broken and ground into the floor rather than a floor deposit. Of the two fragments from deep bowls or cups, K120.1 is an unusual type, without rim band and with a combination of multiple pendent loops and multiple stems that recalls an example from Phaistos;87 it may be an import into Karphi, possibly from the Mesara. The stirrup jar fragment (K120.4) has fringed decoration. The kylix (K120.3) is the very large type found in LM IIIC and possibly associated with drinking rituals.88 It has the deep conical body with carination just below the rim that is so typical of the kylikes of this date at Karphi and elsewhere in east Crete. The decoration of a large outlined motif, possibly an octopus, is common on LM IIIC kylikes and kraters.89 Pottery Catalogue: K120 Fine Wares K120.1 Deep bowl or cup (plate 2 g, fig. 6.14).

Room 121 A second building was identified by the excavators in Room 121, a single room structure, but Wallace has suggested that it was part of K 113-114-120, built after the other rooms and after K 102-106-1 15.93 The entrance into the room is not clear, although the notebook suggests that it may have been from the north. At the east end below the floor were wall foundations that continued the line of the west wall of Rooms K 113-K 114. East of this earlier wall, the deposit went down 85 cm deeper than the area over it or to the west. Wallace's investigations suggest that the lower walls belonged to an earlier room of similar location and dimensions to K 120 and that there had been an earlier activity area to the south represented by the sub floor in K 113.94 There was much pottery. In addition to the vessels catalogued below, the publication and notebook record the following coarse pottery: ten pithoi of Types 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 16, 18, 20, and 24; two tripod pithoi; five pithoid jars, two ofType 8, and one each ofTypes 1, 3, and 7; a jar base ofType 6; tripod legs; dishes, several ofType 6, two ofType 1; a basin ofType 7; four kalathoi ofType 1; a krater ofType 1; two large stirrup jars of Type 2; and four one-handled jugs ofType 3. Fine wares included a pyxis ofType 2; a kylix ofType 1, a jar of Type 3; two stirrup jars ofType 2 (K121.10), a beaded tankard (K121.7), a cup ofType 1, and several bowls ofTypes 1 and 2. There were numerous fragments in the boxes that were not catalogued including a kylix ofType 1, a burned pyxis ofType 2, the base of a jug or stirrup jar with bands, a burned jug with knobs, and a burned juglet with incised grooves at the base of the neck. The basin pictured in Seiradaki was not located.95 Objects from this room included part of a bronze blade (598), a conical stone bead or whorl (596), a schist whetstone (595), a pierced stone disc, and a conical terracotta spindle whorl (597). The notebook also records animal bones and pumice. There was clearly an extraordinary amount of pottery in this room, much of it involved with storage (ten pithoi, two tripod pithoi, five pithoid jars, and two large storage stirrup jars). Some cooking also occurred, as well as other domestic functions. The two tripod cooking pots catalogued from the room (K121.13-14) were unusually small; they are of the variety with a single vertical handle.96 The basin (K121.12) is an unusual type, but a similar example came from Khalasmenos.97 Of the nearly complete fine ware, the stirrup jar (K121.10) is a good LMIIIC type, although not the most common type at Karphi. The neck and false spout are larger than usual, though the body is the familiar globular shape. The half medallion with wavy hatched leaves above a dotted multiple triangle and the fringed antithetic spirals with filler, as well as the quatrefoils and trefoils find parallels on other LM IIIC stirrup jars.98 The shallow bowl (K121.5) is also an uncommon shape, but it has parallels at Kastri and Khamalevri." The small spouted shallow bowl (K121.6) is also unusual, and it is uncertain what these two bowls were used for. The rest of the fine ware is fragmentary and may represent earlier pieces ground into the floor or associated with the earlier structure; there is nothing that is not LM IIIC, although K121.2 finds its closest parallels in LM IIIB Knossos,100 and K121.3 is similar to an LM IIIB deep bowl from Phaistos.101 The decoration on kraters, tankards, and jug find parallels elsewhere on the site and cannot be dated too closely. The quatrefoil leaf decoration on krater K121.8 is similar to that on a krater from Phaistos.102 91 Kastri, 295, fig. 15.P27. 92 Kavousi IIA, fig. 26.B4 P13; Day 1997, 396, fig. 3.1. 93 Wallace 2005, 229. 94 Wallace 2005, 229. 95 Seiradaki, fig. 5.10. 96 A good parallel comes from Kavousi-Vronda: Gesell, Coulson and Day 1991, 166, fig. 6.4 from Building I.

House K 102-106-115-126 This four-room house included two roofed cellars (K 102 and K 115) and a large room (K 106) that may have served as another area for ritual observances. K126 may have been the entranceway into the building. Wallace suggested that K 102-106-115 predated the later phase of K 120.103 Room K 102 This room was said to have been a roofed cellar, probably reached by ladder from K 106.104 The publication mentions a tripod pithos and a kalathos base with olive pits found in the room. The notebook adds a long list of contents, including the following: pithos rims of Types 1, 3, 7, and 17; a pithos base with chevrons and chain pattern; pithoid jars, two of Type 3, two of Type 7, one new type; two jars of Type 3 and one of Type 7; tripod rims of Types 2 and 3 and usual legs; dishes, one of Type 1 with wavy rim and horizontal handles, several of Type 6; two basins of Types 7 and 10, one of Type 4 without handles; and bowls of Types 1 and 2. Fine pottery included a white pyxis of Type 2 and several bowls of Types 1 and 2. Fragments of deep bowls from this deposit are preserved in the boxes: a rim fragment with multiple upright loops, body fragments with fringed motifs and a spiral, and a handle fragment with a curvilinear motif. A cooking tray with a pushed-in lug at the rim was also found in one of the boxes. Objects from the room included 16 whole terracotta spools and fragments of 22 others, suggesting the presence of a loom or storage of a loom here. The notebook also records animal bones and pumice from this room. The preserved pottery is very fragmentary and probably represents material broken earlier and ground Wallace 2005, 229.

It contained a rectangular, stone-lined pit 15 cm deep. According to the notebook, at least six pithoi were found of Types 5,6,7, 8,17, and 18 with the usual designs, along with a wavy moulding and impressed circles, and one quadruple handle with holes at the base. Other coarse wares listed included three pithoid jars of Type 3, two jars of Types 3 and 7, a tripod of Type 1 and other legs, at least three tripod dishes, two dishes of Type 1, one with a handle, and four of Type 6, a small jar of Type 4, a basin of Type 7, a kalathos of Type 3, two stirrup jars of Type 2, two one-handled jugs of Type 3, a bowl of Type 2, and a scuttle handle. Fine wares included a blue bowl of Type 1 (K106.ll), three stirrup jars of Type 3, several bowls of Types 1 and 2, a kylix stem (K106.18), and a cup of Type 1 (K106.1). A good deal of pottery was found in the museum that was not catalogued, including fragments of a deep bowl with reserved band and spiral, and other deep bowls with spirals, pendent multiple loops, and a fringed motif. There were also krater fragments with scalloped edges on the rim band, dotted hatched curvilinear motifs, crosshatched lozenge or triangle, and groups of strokes on the rim. Uncatalogued stirrup jar fragments had bands or filler ornaments. Also found were a cup, a jug with rolled handle and snake (?) attachment, a kalathos with excrescent cup, a small cylindrical vessel, a possible tile, a pithos handle (?), a small jug with wavy line on shoulder, a jug handle, and a large vertical jug handle with a groove down the middle. A variety of objects was found in the room, including a good deal of bronze: two fragments of wire (537), a drop pendent or earring (539),105 a curved knife (540),106 a ring (554),107 a votive double axe (555),108 a rod (553), and a fragment (538). The rod has been identified as belonging to a bronze rod tripod or four-sided stand.109 Also found were the head of a terracotta statuette (559),110 the body of an animal figurine (609), and two sherds from cult objects, perhaps to be identified with two unusual hollow pyramidal objects that were found and not catalogued. A pierced stone plaque (608) was also found, and the notebook adds that animal bones and pumice came from this deposit. Gesell has identified Room K 106 as a possible shrine.111 The bronze double axe suggests ritual activity, as does the fragment of a terracotta statuette (which because of the size would seem to be from a figurine rather than a statue of goddess with upraised arms). The hollow pyramidal objects may also have had a ritual function, possibly parts of horns of consecration, like those from Ayia Triada and Patsos.112 Nevertheless, this is not the same sort of religious area as the Temple or even K 116. Certainly it is not a shrine of the goddess with upraised arms, which regularly has associated snake tubes and plaques, although the basin or stand fragment may indeed belong to a snake tube. It is rather more like rooms K 85- -K 87, with its combination of animal and human figurines.113 The other pottery resembles an ordinary domestic assemblage, including much cooking ware. The tripod (K106.25) is the sort found most commonly at Karphi and other LMIIIC sites.114 The octagonal leg (K106.26), which probably comes from a tripod, is unique. The trays and tripod trays also are typical of LM IIIC assemblages; tray K106.23 has finger or spit impressions on the rim, as often occurs on trays at Kavousi- Vronda, Phaistos, Khalasmenos, Kastri, and Kastrokephala.115 The tripod tray K106.24 is unusual only in that it has an elliptical leg rather than the usual round leg, and there are three parallel vertical strokes on the leg for decoration, in place of the usual dint or deep incision.116 The scuttle handle with its knobs is unique. The fine wares consist of small fragments that could as easily have been in the floors during the use of the room. The only nearly complete vessel was the miniature cup (K106.1). The deep bowls or cups have 105 Karphi, pi. 29.1. 106 Karphi, pi. 28.2. 107 Karphi, pi. 29.2. 108 Karphi, pi. 29.1. 109 Hoffman 1997, 100; the stylistic date for this Cypriote type is early 12th century. 110 Karphi, pi. 32.2. 111 Gesell 1985, 81-2. 112 D'Agata 1997,90-2, figs. 9-13; Kourou and Karetsou 1994, 113-5, pis. 85-86, 88-89, figs. 29-30. 113 Day 2009, 146-7. 114 Kastri, 299, fig. 17.P9; Borgna 19976, 194, fig. 3.1c (Phaistos); Tsipopoulou 2004, 113, fig. 8.7.95-397 (Khalasmenos). 115 Day et al. forthcoming (Kavousi-Vronda); Borgna 19976, 196, fig. 5.3 (Phaistos); Tsipopoulou 2004, 113, fig. 8.7.97 30 (Khalasmenos); Kastri, 290, fig. 1 In; Kanta and Karetsou 2003, 159, fig. 10 (Kastrokephala). 116 For tripod trays cf.

All these motifs appear from the earliest phase of LM IIIC. The most unusual decoration is on K106.3, which has a tricurved streamer with a floral motif and two interior bands instead of the usual monochrome interior. This piece may well have been imported, possibly from the mainland. There were several kylix fragments, at least two of them from a carinated kylix (K106.16-17). The preserved stem (K106.18) is not pierced. Pottery Catalogue: K106 Fine Wares K106.1 Miniature cup (fig. 6.16). H. 3.5; D. base 3.3; D. rim 5.8.

Room K 115 This small room, like K 102, was identified as a roofed cellar, and the excavators thought it was reached by ladder from K106. In addition to the pottery catalogued below, the notebook records the following coarse wares: four pithoi of Types 1,2, 14, and 15 and a base with impressed circles (K115.19); two pithoid jars ofTypes 3 and 9; tripod legs; several jars of Type 3; a dish of Type 6; two stirrup jars of Type 2; ajar or jug; krater bases ofTypes 1 and 2; several bowls ofTypes 1 and 2; and a small tripod pithos. Finer pottery listed in the notebook included two one-handled jugs, a spouted jug, a scuttle, four painted jars of Type 2, a small kylix of Type 2, a large burned pyxis of Type 2 with lily pattern (K115.7), a bowl oflype 1 with a 'Melian imp' (K115.2), a kylix of Type 2 (K115.5) and another smaller one, a stirrup jar of Type 2, a bowl or krater with scale pattern, several bowls ofTypes 1 and 2, and a hut urn (K115.8). The uncatalogued fragments found in the boxes also included the end of a possible bird vase, a kylix base, an excrescent cup with horns, three stirrup jars decorated with strokes, fringes, and scale pattern, a large jug or jar with a quatrefoil floral motif, and body fragments from the same or other jugs. One jug, decorated with bands and published in Seiradaki was missing.117 Few objects were found in the room, only a bronze stylus-shaped implement (551) and a bronze arrowhead (552);118 animal bones were recorded in the notebook. The preserved pottery from this room is made up of nearly complete vessels and constitutes a good assemblage for the end of the settlement's history. It looks very late in LM IIIC. The skyphos or krateriskos (K115.4) is unique for the settlement, and although the shape appears on the mainland as early as LHIIIC early,119 it is rare on Crete until later (SM or PG). This example does not look as late as those found in Ta Mnemata Tomb 17, which are narrower and have higher, more conical feet. This may be one of the earliest examples of what becomes a standard shape in SM. The huge cup (K115.1) with its zigzag pattern may also be late; a cup of similar size and shape was found at Kavousi-FronJa.120 The pyxis (K115.7) has fringed patterns with a bird and possibly a double axe, but it is more careless than usual, possibly a sign of a later date. The large kylix (K115.5) with its fringed decoration, however, is still within the LM IIIC tradition; it has the typical carinated profile and a bulbous stem that is not pierced all the way up. The deep bowl (K115.2) has both a reserved band and disc and an unusual 'gremlin' or 'scorpion' decoration; the shape is reminiscent of a deep bowl from Sybrita/ Thronos, which is dated to early SM.121 The bowl (K115.6) is highly unusual in shape, although another similar bowl was found without any find spot; they may be related to the mainland spouted bowl shape of LH IIIC.122 The stirrup jar (K115.9), with its filled medallions is more reminiscent of the octopus style stirrup jars and looks earlier in LM IIIC, and its shape is nothing like the later SM to PG style. The three jugs (K115.10, 12, 14) are all very similar in shape and they are not narrowly datable. The amphora (K115.15) finds parallels in LM IIIC Kastri, Khania, and Khalasmenos.123 The jar (K115.16) is a type that appears elsewhere at Karphi, but it was not found commonly at other LM IIIC sites. As an assemblage, this group is interesting. Some storage obviously was going on in the room, to judge from the numerous pithoi and pithoid jars, and possibly the coarse stirrup jars and amphora. Cooking wares were also found (both tripods and dishes), along with coarse kraters that might have been used in the preparation of food. Thus the room seems to have been used for multiple domestic functions. The fine wares suggest that eating and especially drinking also went on in the room. The hut urn may have served a religious function, but the use of these small items is still a matter for debate, and this single item cannot be used to 117 Seiradaki, pi. 5c, bottom middle. 118 Karphi, pi. 29.1. 119 Mountjoy 1986, 124. 120 Day and Glowacki forthcoming. 121 D'Agata 1999, 202, fig. 13.41.1. 122 Similar to a spouted cup from Lefkandi (RMDP, 713, fig. 273.63, LHIIIC Middle) andMelos {RMDP, 918, fig. 373.144 — with wavy band.

Room K 126 This room was entered from the north. Its west side was entirely of rock, and it had a narrow entrance into K 106. The pottery was unusual only in being broken and not containing obvious pithos sherds. No actual vessels were preserved. There were two of the baking slabs like one found in K 113, along with one loomweight of a type uncommon at Karphi. Such loomweights do appear at Kavousi-A^astro, but in the Geometric Period.124 Pottery Catalogue: K126 Coarse Wares K126.1 Cooking slab (fig. 6.22). Max. pres. L. 31; max. pres. W. 20.8; Th. 2.6-3.5.

THE NORTHERN SHELTERS (ROOMS K 104, K107-109, K122-125, K127) The rooms known as the Northern Shelters were described as simply spaces created by walling up the bedrock, and there was no coherent plan.125 None of the spaces had any trace of roofing. They were probably reached from the north or from street K 105. The excavators also thought that they were among the earliest buildings on the site, similar to the Southern Shelters. Room K 104 This was a tiny room without features. The pottery was listed as usual, but without pyxides or stirrup jars. The notebook adds that there was a pithos of Type 23 without a base, a lid of Type 1, and a small tripod bowl (K104.1), as well as fragments of a cylindrical ribbed cult object in red clay and a plaque with raised design in buff clay (K 104.2). Aside from the tripod catalogued below, the boxes produced only a single sherd with incised ridges, possibly the cult object mentioned in the notebook. Objects included a bronze awl (574) and a conical stone bead or whorl (573). Although no find spot was written on the fragments of the plaque (K104.2), they are similar enough to the description in the notebook that they have been catalogued with the material from this room.

Flat plaque with raised ridge around exterior. Plastic decoration of animal hooves, on painted background; body fragment has plastic decoration of animal legs. LM IIIC. Room K 107 K 107 and K 108 were on the same level and shared an alignment, with a possible door between. That they belonged together is suggested by cross-joins between the preserved pottery. The notebook records the following coarse ware: at least four pithoi of Types 3, 5, 8, and 14; two pithoid jars of Types 3 and 8; ajar with sharp neck and horizontal handles; the usual tripod legs; four dishes, two of Type 1, one with a handle, and two of Type 6; a krater; two kalathoi of Types 1 and 3; a large pyxis of Type 1; a one-handled jug, a double twisted pithos handle, and a flat clay slab with handles (K107.10). Fine wares included two small jars of Type Lee Ann Turner (personal communication). Karphi, 96-7.</page><page sequence="222">THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT K126.2 K126.3 Fig. 6.22.

More pottery was found in the boxes but was not catalogued. Fine wares included deep bowl fragments with multiple pendent loops or dotted curvilinear patterns, a stirrup jar fragment with a spiral, and a jug or cup handle. Coarser fabrics included a cylindrical ridged vessel and a huge rope-twisted pithos handle with incised chevrons (doubtless the double twisted pithos handle mentioned in the notebook). Objects from this room included a rectangular stone bead (545), a stone grinder (575)126 a cylindrical terracotta spindle whorl (544), a terracotta spool, and antler of red deer. The notebook mentions also animal bones and pumice from the room. The material from the room was of little use either for dating the structure or for determining its function. The large coarse stand was probably used for cooking. There were few deep bowl fragments, and a larger number of fine jugs than normal. The red monochrome jug (K107.5) may have been in use at the time the room was abandoned, as so much of it was preserved; it is an elegant and unusual vessel, with its rope-twisted handle.

Room K 108 According to the notebook, this room had no trace of roofing and may have served as a steep path up to K 109. The notebook lists the following coarse pottery: three pithoi of Types 5, 8, and 10; two pithoid jars of Types 3 and 11; the usual tripod legs; a foot of a tripod pithos; four dishes, one of Type 1, three of Type 6; the base of jar of Type 7; four jars, one of Type 2, three of Type 3; and a kalathos of Type 1. Finer pottery included a stirrup jar of Type 2 with a hole through the false spout, a two-handled jug of Type 3, two kylix stems, and several small bowls of Types 1 and 2. A krater fragment with three bands and vertical strokes and a fragment of a deep bowl with multiple pendent loops were found in the storerooms, but were not catalogued. The pithos rim published by Seiradaki was not found.127 Other objects from the room included a part of a twisted fibula of bronze (546),128 a bronze fragment with rivets (578), a bone pin (576),129 the head of a terracotta figurine (577), and a cylindrical terracotta spindle 126 Karphi, pi. 30.3. 127 Seiradaki, fig. 1.23. 128 Karphi, pi. 29.2. 129 Karphi, pi. 28.4.</page><page sequence="225">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI — A RE-EXAMINA TION Fig. 6.24.

Room K 109 This 'room' is simply a space in the bedrock with one wall on the north and no features. The notebook lists the following coarse pottery: two pithoi of Types 1 and 3, the foot of a tripod pithos, two jars of Types 2 and 3, tripod legs, dishes of Types 1 and 6, several basins of Type 3, a krater of Type 1, and several small plain bowls of Type 1. Fine wares included at least three kraters of Type 1, a stirrup jar of Type 2 (K109.1), several small bowls of Types 1 and 2, three small jars or jugs, a triple handle, and a pyxis ofType 1. Two fine krater fragments found in one of the boxes were not catalogued. Objects included a bronze awl (564), a bronze hooked pin (565),134 four conical (563, 569, 570, 571) and one cylindrical (568) stone beads or whorls, a Neolithic axe head (567), two bone instruments (562, 566), the head of a terracotta figurine (560), and two terracotta spindle whorls, one conical (572), the other biconical (561). The notebook reports animal bones from the room. The stirrup jar (K109.1) is probably from an octopus stirrup jar. The motif of outlined tentacle in a field of U-pattern can be found on stirrup jars from Kritsa, Vasiliki, and Sybrita/Thronos of early LMIIIC date.'35 Pottery Catalogue: K109 Fine Wares K109.1 Stirrup jar (PLATE 23 i, FIG. 6.24).

The pottery is reported to have been much broken, a feature that elsewhere indicates pottery from a dump or from under the paving of a street or courtyard. The notebook reports a coarse kalathos ofType 3, a large coarse red stirrup jar, fine krater fragments, sherds from a small stirrup jar, and a hut urn with a lug on the door (K122.4). Some fragments of the rhyton from K 123 also came from K 122. A jug handle with plastic decoration was found in one of the boxes but not catalogued.

The large krater fragment (K122.3) with the great loops under the handle finds a parallel at Kavousi Vronda, belonging to the very latest LMIIIC phase.137 The panelled patterns of the deep bowls also are LM IIIC features. The rhyton, however, has been dated to LM IIIB.138 Although the conical rhyton was not a popular shape in LM IIIC, it still continued in use, whether as an heirloom item or a vessel of recent manufacture. A good parallel for shape and decoration occurs in LM IIIC contexts at Kastelli Pediada and Khania;139 another rhyton came from a late LM IIIC context at Kavousi-Fro«&lt;fa.140 It is interesting to note that this rhyton was found in the same context as a hut urn.

Fragments came from K 122. For the birds, cf. Borgna 1997a, 289, fig. 22 (Phaistos, LM IIIC); Adreadaki-Vlasaki and Papadopoulou 2005, 380, fig. 45 (Khamalevri, Phase II). LM IIIC. Room K 124 This room was like the others. According to the notebook, the coarse pottery included pithos sherds, one rim of Type 2; two pithoid jars of Types 3 and 7; a jar of Type 2; tripod legs; four dishes, one of Type 1, three of Type 6; two bowls of Type 2, and a lid of Type 1 (K124.9). Fine pottery included two kraters of Type 1 (K124.5 and K124.6 or 7), two fine stirrup jars of Type 2, and several bowls of Types 1 and 2. In addition to the catalogued pottery the boxes produced fragments of several deep bowls, three with curvilinear patterns (spirals?), one with tricurved motif outlined and with dots, and a krater fragment with a linear decoration. A bronze rod (589), a limestone pounder (579), the spout of an Early Minoan stone bowl (580);141 three pierced schist discs (581, 582, 651), four bone pins (585, 586, 587, 588),142 and two terracotta spindle whorls, one cylindrical (584), the other conical (583), were found here. The notebook lists animal bones as well. Some of the pottery finds parallels in early LM IIIC, and it does not look particularly late.

Fine pottery included a large krater with octopus design, a small lid, and bowls of Types 1 and 2. A fragment of a stirrup jar with a scalloped curvilinear motif was also found in one of the boxes, but was not catalogued. There were apparently no other objects found here.

Room K 127 The notebook reports that cult statues were found in crannies of the rocks in this space, but no other information was given, and they were not found. Much pottery was listed, including at least three pithos rims of Types 3, 13, and 23; two pithoid jars of Types 3 and 9; ajar of Type 3; a few tripod legs; two kraters of Type 1; a kalathos of Type 1; four dishes, two of Type 1, two of Type 6; three basins of Types 1, 7, and 12; a jug or jar, perhaps of Type 4; bowls of Types 1 and 2; two stirrup jars of Type 2; a blue tankard spout, and a Byzantine sherd (PLATE 24 e). A fragment of a burned blue cooking pot with a rope-slashed ridge, the incised spout of a tankard in blue ware (mentioned in the notebook), and a fine stirrup jar with a dotted loop near the handle were also found in the boxes, but were not catalogued. Objects found in the room included a bronze knife with a curled tang (645),143 a bronze ring (646),144 a bronze nail (653),145 a lump of lead (647), two conical stone beads or whorls (640, 641), a triangular whetstone (648),146 and a terracotta weight. The preserved material from the room is small and scrappy.

SUMMIT Rooms 128,129 'Peak Sanctuary' The area on top of the peak did not have very well preserved architecture, but in the crannies were many terracotta figurines, and the area was interpreted as a Middle Minoan Peak Sanctuary. The material from this peak sanctuary has been studied by Alan Peatfield and will not form part of the current study. Room K 128 This was a square building, mostly rock-cut, which the excavators interpreted as a watch tower. The pottery was as usual, but there was little fine ware. The notebook lists a few sherds from pithoi, but no rims, much broken coarse ware, the rim of a kalathos of Type 2, and a large stirrup jar top of Type 5. Room K 129 According to the notebook, this room was merely a line of wall between two rocks. The pottery was described as usual, but there were few pithos fragments. The notebook lists many dishes of Type 6, some tripod legs, a few really fine sherds from bowls or cups, some semi-fine from kraters of Types 2 or 3, and two basins ofType 6. From among rocks came small sherds of the usual types along with the following objects: a pierced whetstone (674), two conical stone beads (675, 677), two fragments of lead (667,668), the tip and fragments of a bronze blade (669, 671), a bronze decorated implement (670),150 a bronze arrowhead (672),151 a bronze nail or stud (673),152 half of a small bone handle (676),153 two cylindrical terracotta spindle whorls (665, 666), and many fragments of human and animal figurines and miniature vases.154 FROM SURFACE OF SLOPES GENERALLY No pottery was recorded from the slopes, but the follow ing objects were listed: a fragment of an unfinished limestone bowl (127), a fragment of a limestone palette (128), a conical terracotta loomweight (124), two cylindrical terracotta spindle whorls (125,126), and the head (557) and upper legs of a terracotta statuette (558).

There were two separate areas with ancient use: the actual spring and the so-called sanctuary just above the spring. Vitzelovrysis Spring On the south side of the spring an ancient retaining wall was well preserved.1 The pottery from this area consisted of coarse sherds from water jugs of the usual types, and there were no tripod legs. Some fine ware appeared including a monochrome skyphos and the Protogeometric jug (V.l) catalogued below. There were also many terracotta figurine fragments, including four oxen (396), a sheep (397), and the head of a human figurine (398). It is obvious that the spring continued in use long after the settlement, although perhaps not after the tombs went out of use.

Vitzelovrysis Sanctuary On the summit immediately above the spring was a small flat area of rock, where many terracotta figurines were found, but no actual building. The area was interpreted as an open air sanctuary, possibly with a sacred tree.2 There was very little pottery, all said to be of Archaic date. In addition to a disc-headed bronze pin (394), many terracotta figurines were found here, including the head of a human figure (399), part of a Daedalic head (400), part of a plaque with relief (401), a knob that may have come from the headdress of a goddess (402), a fragment of a terracotta relief (403), and seven fragments from animal figurines (404,405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 410). Six other terracotta figures of animals (116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121)3 were either found on the surface in this area or purchased. A terracotta face that was purchased was said to have come from here (375).4 TA MNEMATA TOMBS This large group of tombs lies on the slopes to the south and east of the main settlement, near the Vitzelovrysis spring. M 1 and M 2 The first two tombs were excavated in 1937.5 These two seem to have been constructed together, with a single retaining wall built behind them against the hill slope. A low wall at right angles to the retaining wall separated the two tombs. Both tombs were corbelled, but both were rectangular in plan and did not begin to round until the second course. M 1 This tomb was thought to be the one excavated by Sir Arthur Evans.6 It had a long dromos that was only one course high and was blocked to that level. The chamber was rectangular and paved with irregular slabs of soft shale. The height of the vault was estimated at 1.25 m, of which 0.30 was below the ground. The number of burials in the tomb is unknown, since no bones were recovered. In addition to the pottery catalogued below, many sherds from a bathtub larnax with dark-painted decoration were found, along with the rim and handle of a pithos with punctuated decoration, sherds from a stirrup jar, and the rim of a fine basin of Type 6. A handle was found in one of the boxes from M 1. The objects included a bronze pin (100),7 a conical stone bead or whorl (101), two cylindrical terracotta spindle whorls (102, 103), and the hindquarters of an animal figurine (104).8 Although the tomb was not found with its contents intact, at least two of the vessels are preserved and give a range of dates for its use.

Like M 1, it was rectangular in plan and was also floored with plaques of soft shale. The vaulting was complete to the capstone, and the door was c. 0.50 high. The stones found blocking the doorway were too large to have fit through the door, leading the excavators to suggest that the bodies must have been introduced into the tomb from above. There were three skulls, all at different levels, but all by the southeast corner, along with quantities of snail shells. In addition to the catalogued pottery, the notebook reports a few fine sherds, including one from a stirrup jar. The skyphos illustrated in Seiradaki as coming from M 2 is actually from M 8.13 Also found in the tomb were an incised fragment of bone (105) and fragments of animal figurines (106, 107).14 The only surviving pottery from this tomb is a coarse tripod, an unusual vessel to find in a tomb. It bears no trace of burning. Not only are tripods unusual in a burial context, but the shape of this example is different from tripod cooking pots found in the settlement. It may belong to a later period, but no parallels have been found. It may have been used as a container (perhaps for a child burial or a cremation), but it does not seem to have been used in cooking.

Two round horizontal handles, two round vertical handles on shoulder. M 3 This tomb was located not far from M 1 and M 2.15 The front was destroyed, but the amount of stone nearby suggests that it originally had a dromos. The tomb was rectangular and had a paved floor raised at the back to form a sort of platform. The tomb was not free-standing but was set into the hill, and the vault reached 1.25 1.50 m. According to the notebook, the human bones of a single individual, including part of a skull were found on the platform along with the two stirrup jars (M3.1-2), but the long bronze pin (182)16 was found in front of the platform. Stirrup jar M3.2 has LMIIIC parallels for shape and decoration,17 but the other stirrup jar (M3.1) has details that suggest a later date: a higher and larger foot, larger spout and false spout, a cone on top of the false spout, and the linear decoration of multiple triangles. The shape and decoration of this vessel finds parallels at Knossos of SM-EPG date, on imported Minoan stirrup jars at Laconia and Rhodes of late LM IIIC-SM.18 Since there was apparently only a single burial in this grave, it would appear that one of these stirrup jars was an antique placed in the grave along with a second more contemporary example in SM times. The earlier stirrup jar might also represent remains from an earlier burial in this tomb, a burial from which all other traces had been removed.

Ta Mnemata tombs, pottery from M 3 (M3.1-2). Scale 1:3. M 4 Tomb M 4 was excavated in 1938, and it was one of the largest and most impressive of the Ta Mnemata tombs.19 It was built with the long dromos parallel to the hillside, with a retaining wall at the back. It had a paved floor, and the vault was approximately one metre high. The door was found blocked with a large stone. Within the tomb were pieces of five skulls immediately above the floor, with other bones scattered and disturbed. Outside, between the dromos and the tomb, a rectangular area with walls and a paved floor contained more human bones and sherds, possibly the remains of another burial. East of the retaining masonry was an area of black earth with a few sherds. Much pottery was also found scattered outside the tomb, particularly to the west; all attests to a good deal of disturbance, either during reuse of the tomb or as a result of robbing. From inside the tomb came the coarse pyxis (M4.3), sherds from a small vessel in red clay with horizontal ribbing (possibly a pyxis), two stirrup jars (M4.4-5) and parts of another, and the base of a krater in 'harsh' clay with a dark wash. In addition to these vessels, there were numerous fragments in two separate compart ments of one of the museum boxes, one labelled 'M 4 inside tholos, at 1 m', and the other 'M 4 inside tholos, below 1 m'. 19 Karphi, 102-3.</page><page sequence="236">VITZELOVRYSIS AND THE TOMBS The compartment labelled 'M 4 inside, tholos below 1 m' produced many fragments of a thin-walled Hellenistic cup of gritty, clinky, micaceous fabric with ribbing on rim and body.20 Also from this level were fragments of a small jug or stirrup jar, a deep bowl fragment, two krater fragments, and assorted body sherds. Objects listed in the inventory book as coming from this same deposit were the two bow fibulas (175, 176)21 and two fragments of an iron nail (178).22 From the compartment labelled 'M 4, inside tholos, at 1 m' came fragments of another late ribbed vessel of gritty fabric, blue-grey inside, and red on exterior; it had a flat base with incisions on the edge, and a knob above. Also from this deposit were a black-glazed fine rim, a coarse black-glazed overhanging rim, a coarse ring base (D. est. 10) (possibly the base of a krater mentioned above), a painted and coarse rim of micaceous fabric that joins with fragment in the compartment in the box without label. One other compartment in the box had no label, but because of the join may belong to this upper deposit. It contained a black-glazed rim fragment, two ribbed micaceous coarse fragments, a coarse base with tripod attachment and dint, a medium-coarse pedestal base, a PG conical foot, a fine black-glazed ring base, a large jug handle, a small juglet, a deep bowl (?) rim, and assorted body sherds. The material from outside the tomb was listed in the publication. From the partition outside came bones and fragments of a single vase. Listed as coming from outside the tomb in the publication and notebook were the following: a number of coarse ware sherds, including two from a larnax; two fragments in red clay with ribbing and medallion decoration; fine sherds from stirrup jars; a krater of Type 2 and other krater sherds; a beaded tankard (M4.7) and kylix (M4.6). The notebook also mentions a few Byzantine fragments, possibly the ribbed wares mentioned above. The other objects from this tomb were simply listed as M 4. These included a bronze needle with an eyehole (171 ),23 part of a bronze ring (177),24 and three terracotta animal figurines (172, 173, 174), probably bovines. It is clear that this tomb was in use over a long period of time. Five burials were made in the chamber and one in the space outside. Since no pottery was associated with the exterior burial, no conclusions can be made about its chronological relationship with the burials in the tomb. The presence of so much late material inside the tomb, even at the lowest levels, indicates that the burials were disturbed. The pottery that belonged with the burials inside the tomb is scanty, but suggests a LMIIIC date. Certainly stirrup jar M4.4 is LM IIIC, and stirrup jar M4.5 also has the fringed style of IIIC, although the presence of the air hole would make it very late in that period. The shape is peculiar and cannot be easily dated. The deep bowl or skyphos with its blob decoration (M4.2) may be late LM IIIC, with parallels at Khalasmenos.25 The cup (M4.1) looks more like the globular one-handled cups that become popular from the PG on; this example, with its deep shape and thin walls, looks late in the sequence, even Geometric, but the use of blob decoration would suggest an earlier date. The kylix (M4.6) and mug (M4.7) found scattered outside the tomb may have been deposited when the tomb was opened later on, and they may belong with the burials inside. Both are late LM IIIC types, with parallels in the settlement. The date of the later material found in the tomb is uncertain. The excavators thought it was Byzantine, no doubt because so many of the sherds were ribbed and because of the gritty nature of the clay. The one cup has parallels in Hellenistic pottery, and the black glazed fragments look fourth century to Hellenistic, so the disturbance may have come in that period. The history of the tomb can be reconstructed as follows: it was first used in the late LM IIIC period, and continued in use into PG (cup M4.1), perhaps by descendants of the original burying population who had moved elsewhere, or those asserting ownership of the grave and its associations. During this time at least five burials were made. At some point a sixth burial was made outside in the area to the southeast, but whether this was a late burial or the burial of someone not part of the burying group (a different family or class or a later interment) is not clear. Finally, probably in the Hellenistic period (when there was activity also on the site of Karphi in the area of the Great House) people returned, dug out the interior of the tomb, disturbed the bones and some of the pottery, and deposited fragments of their own. Possibly this reuse was related to veneration of ancestors, or perhaps it was simply random destruction of property. Pottery Catalogue: M 4 Inside M 4, below 1 m Fine Wares M4.1 Cup (FIG. 7.3).

M 5 and M 6 These two tombs were similar to M 1 and M 2, with a retaining wall behind and a wall separating the two.26 They were not, however, so close together. Much pottery was found outside the two tombs, including much coarse ware of the types found in the settlement. The notebook records that these fragments included tripod legs and pithos sherds with chevron decoration, and a larnax sherd. The notebook and publication also list the following: fine sherds from kylikes, including a base, like those from inside the tomb; an overhanging rim, probably Archaic, and a few fragments of fourth-century glaze. One of the museum boxes had a compartment with sherds and a label identifying them as from M 5 6 surface. These included a fragment of Classical black glaze, possibly fourth century; fragments of three small stirrup jars, one carinated, one with a design of fringed multiple upright loops on the shoulder, and a third with a fringed motif. Also in the box were a ring base from a closed vessel, two bases from small jugs or stirrup jars, a cup or jug handle, another handle, and several body fragments. This material may well have been thrown out of the tomb when it was robbed. The LM IIIC sherds suggest that the tomb was in use during the occupation of the settlement of Karphi. Nothing was well enough preserved to catalogue. M 5 The tomb had a carefully constructed, rectangular chamber with no paving, and it had no dromos. The height of the vault was 1.5 m. Sherds from two kylikes of Types 1 and 2 were found, but no bones. M 6 This smaller and less well-built tomb was only about a metre high. The back of the masonry was rough and ran into the hillside, so it was not entirely free standing. It had an irregular paving and no dromos. The large blocks found within were too large to have been brought in through the doorway, which was only c. 0.50 high. Found inside were sherds from a krater and a few coarse sherds. There were remains only of a single body. M 7 and M 8 These two tombs were constructed close to one another on the slopes of Mikre Koprana, not too far from M 16 and M 17.27 There was no retaining wall, because they were parallel to the hillside, but there was a rough wall between the two at approximately right angles. M 7 The smaller of the two tombs, M 7 was irregular in plan, with a paved floor, and a vault 1.5 m high. The dromos was unlined, and it served as a retaining wall on the east. There were at least two bodies. Sherds from one or more stirrup jars and a kylix of Type 1 were reported, along with two thin bronze discs (183,184)28 and a bone needle (3 71). No pottery was preserved from this tomb. Clearly, the tomb had been disturbed, and there was little to suggest its date; the presence of the kylikes would suggest that it was in use in LM IIIC, however. M 8 Tomb M 8 was the largest and best-built tomb at Karphi. It was polygonal in plan, with stone paving Karphi, 103. Karphi, 104-5. Karphi, pi. 28.1.</page><page sequence="239">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINA TION and a vault of over 1.5 m. It had a dromos, which was found unfilled, an indication that the tomb had been opened. There were remains of three individuals interred in the tomb. Outside the tomb was a deposit of black earth that ran north of the wall linking M 8 with M 7; this deposit was under a layer of red earth that contained sherds from the robbing of the tomb. The material from within the tomb included a stirrup jar of Type 6 (M8.3), fragments of two large kraters of Types 1 and 2 (M8.2), some smaller vessels from near the floor, and pieces of the fenestrated stand (M8.4). One of the kraters is preserved (M8.2), but the other published in Seiradaki was not found.29 Objects from inside the tomb included two bronze bow fibulas (157, 158),30 three bronze rings (159,160,161),31 three spiral hair rings of bronze (162, 163, 164),32 a bronze implement (166),33 many small bronze discs with clips at back for attachment (169), a tubular bone bead (165), and a conch shell (181). The material from the red earth layer outside above 0.85 included sherds from the kraters and other vessels found inside and fragments of a very fine, red-painted kylix that the excavators thought was LMIIIB. One of the boxes had a compartment with sherds from this red layer. In addition to the catalogued fragments, there were at least five bases, seven round handles, one flat handle, and 210 body sherds of the same soft fine fabric. There were no other objects. The deposit of black earth included a kylix of Type 2 (M8.8), many sherds from the fenestrated stand, and some Archaic and later sherds along with the usual fragments. Objects included fragments of two iron needles (167, 168) and three terracotta figurines: the headless figurine of a seated female (170),34 part of a bovine figurine (179), and a fragment of a female figurine (180). There were also traces of walls below the two tombs, and associated with these walls were sherds of the usual types, including a few pithos fragments with chevrons, and a few Archaic sherds, one with overhanging rim, one glazed. The head of a terracotta bull figurine was also found. It is likely that much of the material found outside the tomb was thrown out by tomb robbers and belonged to the burials within; there seem to have been joins between the material found in the red earth outside and that from within the tomb. Fragments of the fenestrated stand also were found both in the tomb and in the black earth outside, along with remains of Archaic and later date. It would appear that there were at least two episodes of reuse when material was removed from the tomb: in or prior to the Archaic period, represented by the black earth, and a later disturbance represented by the red earth. All of the material catalogued below should have come from the three burials made in the tomb. The usual shapes are represented, including skyphos, deep bowl, kylix, krater, cups, stirrup jars, and a thelastron. The fene strated stand (M8.4) is an unusual vessel to be placed in a burial, and this example finds no definite parallels in the settlement; the shape is, however, popular in late LM IIIC Kavousi- Vronda.35 The pottery is also mixed in date, suggesting a long period of use for the tomb. The kylix (M8.8), the stirrup jar (M8.3), and the carinated cup (M8.5) from outside all are of early LM IIIC date, with shapes or decoration common to that period; the unusual decoration on the kylix finds a close parallel on a krater from Khania,36 the stirrup jar is similar to an example from Knossos,37 while the carinated cup resembles examples from the mainland of middle LH IIIC date.38 The shape of the krater (M8.2), with its rather high foot and almost bell-shaped body, looks very late, approaching the Subminoan bell krater; the decoration, however, appears to be late LM IIIC. The skyphos (M8.1) is definitely much later, and finds parallels in either the SM or the EPG period.39 The date for this tomb would seem to be primarily LM IIIC, with at least one burial later in SM-EPG. The later use, represented by the black earth, included terracotta figurines; perhaps already the tomb was used for ritual, possibly for the veneration of ancestors.

Tombs M 9-M 15 This group of tombs was located south ofVitzelovrysis, above the pathway.40 Although there were no links among them, they lie close together and have the same orientation. Tombs 9-12 are on the same level and follow the hill contour, while Tomb 15 lies immediately below M 9, and M 14 lower still, but to the side. M 9 Tomb M 9 was not entirely free-standing but built into the hillside, and it was without a dromos. It was rectangular in plan and was paved with small stones. It stood only 0.60 high, and the capstone was missing. The bones of at least four human bodies were found in it, including the skulls. The pottery included only a small stirrup jar (M9.1) and a coarse jar (M9.2). Three bronze pins were also found (378, 379, 380).41 There is little to date this grave, and the material from within it cannot be thought of as indicative of the range of grave goods found with four burials. The stirrup jar (M9.1) is of an uncommon shape, very squat and with a high foot, and the technique of adding the foot separately as the tops often were on stirrup jars is highly unusual; it finds a parallel in shape at Myrsini of LM IIIC date.42 The decoration of filled triangles with fringes helps to date this example in late LM IIIC. There are no good parallels for the jar, although its knobbed decoration makes it similar to examples from the settlement. Pottery Catalogue: M 9 Fine Wares M9.1 Stirrup jar (FIG. 7.6). Max. pres.

M 10 M 10 was like M 9, but with upright slabs for door jambs. Square in plan, it had no dromos. It was found with no blocking in the doorway, an indication that it was robbed in antiquity. There were remains of four human bodies and the teeth of a sheep or ox. The publication mentions two small vases, both probably one-handled jugs of Type 1, while the notebook lists one-handled jars ofType 5. No pottery was saved from this tomb. Other finds included a bronze pin (381).43 M 11 Like M 9 and M 10 this was a small square tomb, but it had a dromos, of which one wall was preserved on the north.44 A bit of the paving was left in the southeast. The entrance was not found blocked, indicating that the tomb had been entered and robbed earlier. The remains of two bodies and some animal teeth were found within and quite a bit of other material overlooked by the tomb robbers. In addition to the pottery catalogued below, there were also said to be fragments of a coarse red stirrup jar of Type 5, two 43 Karphi, pi. 28.3. 44 Karphi, 106.</page><page sequence="244">VITZELOVRYSIS AND THE TOMBS stirrup jars of Type 2, and one of Type 3,45 as well as a bowl of Type 1 in very soft clay. Other objects from the tomb included the hoop of a bronze bow fibula (382),46 two fragments of an iron blade (383),47 fragments of an iron fibula (3 84),48 a cylindrical stone bead (385), and a fragment of rock crystal (386). The material from this tomb looks very late. The presence of so much iron is an indication that the tomb postdates LM IIIC, when iron was rare. Stirrup jar M11.5 is of LM IIIC date, to judge by its shape and poorly preserved decoration, and the rhyton with its human head is similar to the LM IIIC example found in the settlement in K 27 (K27.3). The bird vase is clearly later, with parallels of SM and PG date, but it is most similar to an example from Axos.49 Stirrup jar Ml 1.4 finds its closest parallels in shape and decoration in Knossos tombs of PG date, but also has parallels elsewhere.50 The thelastron may also be similar in date, as it resembles an EPG example from the Knossos area.51 A date of EPG would be likely for the later of the two burials in this grave.

It was preserved six courses high, and only the capstone was missing. The dromos was blocked in antiquity, and it had a paved floor. The remains of only a single human body were found within. In addition to the catalogued pottery, a biconical stone bead or whorl (391) came from this tomb. This tomb may represent the interment of only a single individual and can tell us something about a burial assemblage, although some material may have been robbed out. The assemblage included a deep bowl, a shallow side-spouted bowl, two juglets, and four stirrup jars. The juglets and stirrup jars are most likely to have been present because of their contents, while the deep bowl and spouted bowl may have been either for the use of the dead in the afterlife or the remains of a ritual at the time of the burial. All of the pottery from the tomb is of LM IIIC date. The shape of the deep bowl is not particularly late, with its slightly concave raised base; it is similar to a deep bowl from K 68 (K68.1) and finds parallels in early LM IIIC deposits at Kavousi-Vronda.5* The shallow side-spouted bowl is highly unusual; it does appear in LM IIIB and so should be thought of as early in LM IIIC.59 Two of the stirrup jars have linear fringed decoration that should date in the later part of LM IIIC.

M 15 This tomb was rectangular inside and out, and it is unusual because it had no visible entrance and no dromos.60 It was built into the hill at the back, so it was not free standing. It contained the remains of two human bodies. In addition to the stirrupjar, there were sherds of a large basin of Type 3, a tripod leg with circular impressions at the top, and a small, two handled cup, probably Archaic in date. This last piece may attest to later activity in or around the tomb. Pottery Catalogue: M15 Fine Wares M15.1 Stirrup jar (FIG. 7.9). Max. pres. H. 8.2; D. base 3.8; max. D. 9.

In addition to the catalogued vases, the tomb produced fragments of two stirrup jars of Type 2 with feet of Type 7 and sherds of a small vase in red clay with a white slip, probably a spouted jug of Type 1 (i.e. a thelastron). The conical cup (M16.1), called a miniature kalathos, was found almost directly under the paving.

The other stirrup jars mentioned may also be as early; they are of the same general shape, but apparently from the description had flat bases. The flask (M16.2), on the other hand is of SM date, with many parallels; the shape seems to have travelled.62 Its fabric is so hard and well-fired that it looks out of place at Karphi and was probably an import, most likely from Knossos. The oinochoe (M16.5), however, looks even later, although no exact parallels can be found for its shape.63 The tomb, then, seems to have been in use over a long period of time, from the middle of LM IIIC down at least to SM and possibly even later.

The remains of three human bodies were found within, along with bones of horse, sheep/ goat, and ox. The publication gives the following pottery in addition to the vessels catalogued below: three stirrup jars, one of Type 1 with a foot of Type 7 and spout of Type 4; two small bowls of Type 2; and a one-handled jug of Type 1, but with a flat lip. To this list the notebook adds a one-handled jar of Type 5 with a rim of Type 4; a two-handled jug of Type 1 with flat lip; the decorated base of large basin of Type 3; the rim of a basin of Type 6; and part of the base of a tripod of Type 3. Other objects included a bronze ring (392)65 and the hoop of a bow fibula (393).66 Only two shapes are represented in the extant pottery: the krateriskos and the thelastron. There are two types of krateriskos; the first (M17.1) is found in a single example and is highly unusual, with its flat rim and two vertical handles from rim to body. A similar vessel can be found at Sybrita/Thronos of late LMIIIC date, but it lacks the flattened rim of the Karphi vessel and the wavy line decoration, and it has no base.67 Ml7.1 also resembles a White-painted I amphora from Kaloriziki on Cyprus that has been dated to CG la,68 or CG II (950-850 BC).69 The other krateriskoi (Ml 7.2-4) are of the belly-handled type. There may be two of these rather than three; there were many fragments that included at least two bases, and possibly M17.2 and M17. 4 are fragments of the same vessel. At any rate, these find parallels in SM contexts at Khamaizi-PAatez and in EPG tombs in Rnossos.70 The thelastron (M17.6) has a close parallel in SM tombs at Knossos, as well.71 The last use of this tomb would seem to have been EPG.

TOMBS AT ASTIVIDHERO The other cemetery lies to the east of Karphi, near the spring at Atsividhero. There were four tombs, two set close together (A 2, A 3), and two standing alone (A 1, A 4). The cemetery did not last as long as the Ta Mnemata cemetery, and there is no material from the tombs that dates to the period after the settlement was abandoned. Whatever the nature of the later activity at Ta Mnemata, whether SM-PG burials or later activities perhaps involving rituals in the Archaic or Classical Periods, there is no evidence for it in the Atsividhero tombs. A 1 Tomb A 1 stood alone.72 It was a rectangular, paved tholos tomb that ran into the hill at the back and had no dromos. The door was found still blocked, but although it looked undisturbed, the bones were not articulated and the pottery was found up against the wall, so the tomb was doubtless robbed in antiquity There were remains only of one human body. Two cups illustrated as coming from this tomb were not found,73 nor was the stirrup jar.74 A small bowl mentioned in the notebook also was missing. The only other object from the grave was a conical stone bead or whorl (150). The cup (Al.l) finds a parallel at Khalasmenos of late LM IIIC date, while the juglet (A1.2) is similar to one from Katalimata.75 Pottery Catalogue: A 1 Fine Wares Al.l Cup or deep bowl (fig. 7.11).

A 2 and A 3 These two tombs formed a pair.76 There was no retaining wall, and both were built into the hill; they were separated by a wall of shaped blocks. A 2 The east side of this tomb had disappeared. It was rectangular and paved with water-proof clay. It had a dromos that was paved with stones. There were fragments of only three small vases found inside, and only a few and much damaged bones. There is too little preserved pottery to suggest a date for the burial (s) in the tomb. The beaded tankard resembles those from M 4 and from K 77 and other places in the settlement, so it can be attributed to LM IIIC. The deep bowl base is high and very late, approaching the conical foot of SM, but probably still within LM IIIC. Pottery Catalogue: A 2 Fine Wares A2.1 Deep bowl (FIG. 7.11). D. base 3.8.

A3 Tomb A 3 was circular and paved with stones; its dromos had been blocked in antiquity. There were many bones, but they were much damaged and there were no objects. Inside the tomb six vessels were found. The cup (A3.1) and deep bowl (A3.3) are examples of the carinated shape found in LM IIIC, and the use of blob decoration can be found in all phases of LM IIIC; these examples both have drips on them. The monochrome deep bowl or cup (A3.4) cannot be closely dated but certainly looks LM IIIC. The miniature cup (A3.2) and stirrup jars fit into LM IIIC as well. 72 Karphi, 108. 73 Seiradaki, fig. 14 cup 2; pi. 8e, top and pi. 8e middle. 74 Seiradaki fig. 11.1, pi. 11a, bottom, second from right. 75 Coulson andTsipopoulou 1994, 75, fig. 10.3; 85, fig. 19.4; Nowicki 2008, fig. 52.KP 282. 76 Karphi, 108.</page><page sequence="252">VITZELOVRYSIS AND THE TOMBS Fig. 7.11.

A 4 This tomb ran alongside the hill and was free standing.77 It was rectangular in plan and has a long dromos that was found blocked. The entrance was not blocked, but there was a pithos partly in the entrance chamber. There were remains of one human body, but they were much disturbed, and the excavators thought the tomb had been robbed soon after the burial was made. Pottery included fragments of a large pithos with chevron decoration, sherds of a stirrup jar in soft pink clay, and bases of two cups or bowls in similar clay. None has been preserved. 77 Karphi, 108-9.</page><page sequence="254">8 Vases from uncertain contexts Many fragments and vessels were stored with the Karphi pottery that did not have room or tomb numbers written on them, and some did have worn numbers that were no longer legible.

Within each shape, an attempt will be made to consider the fine, medium-coarse, and coarse examples of each shape separately, since there may have been functional or chronological differences between a fine shape and its coarse or medium-coarse counterpart. Within the fine wares, I will treat decorated wares, including monochrome decoration, separately from the few plain wares that survive. Cooking vessels, which constitute a particular class of pottery at Karphi, will be considered together after the other vessels, and finally there will be a section on a few terracotta objects that do not readily fall into the category of pottery. With a few exceptions, the terminology for the shapes conforms to those established by Hallager.1 FABRICS Fine wares Not much can be added to Seiradaki's descriptions of the fine fabrics. She distinguished only two general categories, regular buff wares, and the misfired pottery known as blue ware. Regular bufffine wares As Seiradaki noted,2 the fabrics of the regular buff coloured wares are all soft, and I have chosen to categorise their hardness as follows: Very soft: comes off easily on the fingers. Soft: easily scratched with a fingernail, comes off on the fingers if rubbed. Medium soft: still can be scratched with a fingernail, but does not rub off on the fingers. Occasionally, there is a fragment of harder fabric (medium-hard) or even one that is impervious to the fingernail (hard). Such fabrics are probably not local; where one has been tested petrographically (K38.1) it seems to be an import, and a number of fragments of hard fabric look imported also on the basis of decoration or style, like K21.1, which has a mainland motif, or K46.2, K106.3, and K.6, which have interior bands instead of monochrome paint. The softness of the fabric is most likely to have been a result of the conditions under which the pottery was fired rather than stemming from the clay itself; it may simply be due to low firing temperatures in the kiln. The presence of so many misfired vessels in blue ware at Karphi suggests that the potters did not have good control over their firing conditions. Many of the fragments of harder fabric are decorated with motifs that belong to early LM IIIC, so there may also have been a change over time. Soft fabrics, however, are a regular feature of LM IIIC pottery, particularly in east Crete; similar fabrics can be found at Kavousi and Khalasmenos, and probably at other LM IIIC sites as well. Soil conditions may also have contributed to the softness of the fabrics; sometimes joining pieces of the same vessel appear to have rather different fabrics, perhaps because they were buried in different types of soil. Such was the case also at Kavousi.3 The fabrics are well levigated, generally with few inclusions. Frequently, a fabric may have visible tiny black or white sand-sized inclusions. Two fabrics are most common. The first is a soft fabric of reddish yellow (5 YR 6/6,5 YR 7/6,7.5 YR 7/6) with a distinct very pale brown slip (1OYR 8/3-8/4). The second is a more porous soft very pale brown (10YR 8/3-8/4) to pale yellow or light grey (2.5Y 7/2-8/2) fabric with a thin slip of the same colour or no slip at all. Other common fine fabrics include a soft light red (2.5YR 6/8) to red (2.5YR 5/8, 10R 6/6) fabric, usually with a thick creamy very pale brown slip; this fabric sometimes comes with tiny black or white inclusions, and when thick often has a grey core. Another common fabric is reddish yellow and micaceous (5YR 7/6-7.5YR 7/6) often with tiny red phyllites, or small white or black inclusions. This fabric varies from the usual soft to hard. Other fabrics are represented by single examples and may be imported. Petrographic analysis of the fine wares, although limited, has shown a remarkable consistency in the fine fabrics, and the two most common types seem to be identical petrographically. All of the decorated fine wares have dull to glossy paints in black, red, or brown.4 Many of the paints were 1 Hallager 1999ft. 2 Seiradaki, 2. 3 Day et al. forthcoming. 4 I am using the term paint for the dark-coloured decoration, although it is technically incorrect; rather the 'paint' is a form of slip.</page><page sequence="265">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION thick and crackled, but have worn off to a mere shadow. Often the decoration is difficult to discern; sometimes one can only see where the paint has worn off and left the surface less glossy than the slip. The colour of the paint seems to be determined by the firing conditions, varying from black (fired under reducing conditions) to red (fired under oxidising conditions). The surfaces have worn badly, making the original appearance of the vessel uncertain. The secondary burning of so much of the pottery has also changed the original colour, and it is difficult to know what was intended or even originally produced. Sometimes the surface has been so badly burned that the slip has turned black and the paint is a paler colour (like a negative photographic image). Plain fine wares are not common at Karphi, where most of the fine wares bear painted or incised decoration. There may originally have been more plain wares, but if so, few have been saved. Blue wares Vessels in a fabric called blue ware by the excavators show signs of having been misfired in the kiln; the shapes are often irregular. A large number of these vessels are in fine fabrics, often harder than normal due to overfiring, but occasionally soft. They often have tiny white inclusions and are porous, as if small inclusions have burnt out leaving voids. These blue ware vessels are not, in fact, blue in colour, but range from grey to dark grey (5Y 5/1, 5Y 4/1, 5Y 6/1, N5/1, 5G 6/1), sometimes with a bluish cast (5B 5/1, 5B 4/1, 5 BG 4/1, 5BG 5/1). Medium-Coarse Wares Medium-coarse is a difficult category that includes pottery that has more obvious inclusions than the fine wares, but not sufficient or large enough inclusions to be thought of as coarse. Usually, such pottery is thin walled and looks in drawings as though it were fine. At Karphi, this group occurs in two types: misfired 'blue ware' and other wares that resemble either the fine buff wares or the redder coarse wares. The blue wares (four examples) often have hard white angular inclusions and phyllites, and they are grittier than the finer blue wares. The other fabrics are similar to those found in coarser varieties, but with fewer or smaller inclusions. Phyllite fabrics with hard white angular inclusions are most common, often of reddish yellow colour (5YR 5/6, 5YR 6/6, 5YR 7/6; 7.5YR 7/6), occasionally light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4). Some micaceous fabrics also appear in light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) to red (2.5YR 5/8) colour. Other fabrics contain small hard angular black or white inclusions, sometimes both; these range in colour from light red (10R 6/8, 2.5YR 6/6) to yellowish red (5YR 5/6-5/8) or reddish yellow (5YR 6/8), although several have been burned, making colour determination difficult. In addition, there is a very soft light red (2.5YR 6/6) fabric with frequent tiny white carbonate inclusions and a fabric in which the inclusions have fired out, leaving only voids. Coarse Wares Something can be added to the observations made by Seiradaki about the different coarse fabrics that make up the Karphi pottery, based on macroscopic examina tion and petrographic analysis. The most common and doubtless local coarse fabrics in non-cooking wares generally have inclusions from the phyllite series, including schist, and nearly always have hard, white, angular inclusions that can be identified as quartz and/ or quartzite; they can also have small hard black inclusions and often contain silver or gold mica. Petrographically, these are the fabrics defined as group 1. They most often come in light red (2.5YR 6/6), red (2.5YR 5/6-5/8), and reddish yellow (5YR 7/6) colour, and the larger vessels frequently have a grey core. This fabric type includes a wide variety of vessel shapes, including those for storage, transport, working, and pouring, as well as for some ritual vessels; kalathoi and pithoi are most common shapes. Some of these phyllite fabrics look like those from Kavousi, particularly Type IV (a cooking fabric also used on many coarse vessels) and Type X/XI.5 Another common fabric type is represented by flysch fabrics containing igneous rocks, especially basalt, along with the phyllites and quartzites; petro graphically, these are fabric groups 3 and 4. They occur most often in lighter colours, often reddish yellow (5YR 6/6-6/8, 5YR 7/6, 7.5YR 6/8, 7.5YR 7/6-8/6) but occasionally in red (2.5YR 5/6-5/8) or light red (2.5YR 6/6-6/8). This fabric type was used for pithoi, storage jars, and stirrup jars, as well as ritual vessels, including goddesses and snake tubes. There is a great variety of other phyllite fabrics, usually occurring in single examples that include carbonates, siltstones, soft green inclusions, and chaff voids. Some fabrics were used primarily for cooking vessels, although many of the coarse vessels also occur in these same fabrics (especially kalathoi). Cooking wares vary little in colour, primarily red (1 OR 5/6-5/8, 2.5YR 4/6-4/8, 2.5YR 5/6-5/8), but also light red (10R 6/8, 2.5YR 6/6), reddish yellow (5YR 6/6 7/6), and yellowish red (5 YR 4/6,5 YR 5/6-5/8). Nearly all cooking vessels are of phyllite fabrics with hard white angular inclusions and/or gold or silver mica. Shapes include tripods, dishes, lids, jugs, kalathoi, and scuttles. Almost all cooking vessels tested petro graphically are of group 1; those that actually came into direct contact with the fire (cooking dishes, jugs, cooking pots, and tripods) more often in group lb, while Haggis and Mook 1993; Mook 2005, 171; Kavousi IIA, 163-7.</page><page sequence="266">POTTERY ANALYSIS cooking slabs and lids are more commonly of group 1 a. Two unusual types identified petrographically are, however, phyllite fabrics. SHAPES Cup (FIG. 9.1) As Seiradaki observed, cups are comparatively rare at Karphi,6 although they may have been more common than they appear. Cups are similar to bowls in shape, and the two can be distinguished only by the handles; the cup has a single vertical handle, while bowls have two horizontal handles. If the handles are not preserved, certainty in identification of the shape is difficult. Watrous's observation that at Kommos the two shapes can be distinguished by the rim diameters does not seem to hold true for Karphi.7 If there is no clear indication about which shape is represented, the vessel has been classed as a deep bowl or cup (or cup or deep bowl, if the evidence seems to indicate that it is more likely to be a cup than a deep bowl). In general, the comparative paucity of cups has been found to be a common feature of LMIIIC assemblages and contrasts with earlier periods.8 Seiradaki recognised two types of cups: Type 1 is carinated, while Type 2 is deep and rounded, with a rather small mouth.9 Both of these types are based on examples from the Atsividhero tombs, but Type 2 vessels appear in the settlement (K12.1, K26.1, K48.1, K58.1, K148.1). To these can be added five additional shapes. First is a cup similar to Type 1, but rounded instead of carinated (K114.2). The second type is a simple curved cup rising from a small base with a vertical lip (K79-89.1, K106.1, and possibly K73.1, K23.33, and K12.17). The third type is a deep cup with a tall carinated rim (K81.1). The fourth type is a large cup with a deep rounded body (K79.1, K115.1), and the fifth is the conical cup (K114.1). Most common cups are Type 2, and the rounded cup. The least common is the deep cup with tall carinated rim; only a single certain example occurs (K81.1), a very late piece, with parallels at Knossos of LM IIIC date, which already anticipate the SM wavy line cup.10 The foot of this example from Karphi, while rather high, is not yet the conical shape of SM-PG times on Crete. The large cup with deep rounded body is unusual for its size (the rim diameter is 24); it might better be called a mug, except that the term is already used for another shape. Its function might be analogous to the very large kylikes in use throughout the settlement. At the other end of the size scale, several very small cups are preserved (K106.1, K58.1), some of which may have been attached to larger vessels. The conical cup is also rare, represented by a single example from the settlement (K114.1) and one from the tombs (M16.1); this scarcity is not unusual and conforms to the situation observed in other LM IIIC sites.11 The shallow cup, found in LM IIIC Khania,12 is not found at all among the vessels that can be securely identified as cups, although several may be represented among the sherd material (e.g. K76.37-38). One cup from unknown context (K.l) has a shape more akin to Geometric monochrome globular cups and may have come from one of the tombs. One MM cylindrical ribbed cup was found in the rubbish dump under K 17 (K17.10). Rounded cups are most like the deep bowls, and without a handle it is almost impossible to distinguish them from the bowls. Additional possible cups of this type include K100.1, K79-89.4, K76.7, K48.3, K88.1, K76.ll, K.ll, and K101.3; all of these vessels have smaller rims than normal for deep bowls (8-10 instead of the more usual 12-14), and K100.1 has a squatter profile that looks more like a cup. K76.12 may come from a Type 2 cup. In all cases where the handle has been preserved, it rises slightly above the rim. Handles are usually elliptical, although on a few examples they are nearly round. Bases are nearly always raised and concave underneath. The only exception to this rule is K.1, which has a flat base; this is another indication that this cup is later than the settlement pottery. The vessels clearly identifiable as cups have a very limited range of decoration: blob decoration (K79-89.1, possibly K73.1), wavy line (K81.1, K79.1), zigzag (K115.1, K26.1), andmonochrome (K114.1-2, K12.1, K.l); one may be plain (K12.17). Possible cups (K100.1, K 79-89.4, K76.7) add a 'comb' pattern, a Minoan flower, and pendent multiple loops; all the other possible cups have blob decoration. The limited range of known decoration may make identification of cups easier; if the decoration falls outside this range, the fragment is perhaps more likely to come from a deep bowl. Of the four examples decorated with zigzags or wavy lines, two have rim bands and a pair of bands on the lower body; one has a band below the rim. A possible shallow cup shape may be seen in K76.37-38. If these rim fragments are from cups rather than bowls, they would constitute another type, one found also at Khania.13 Both are decorated with blob pattern. Cups also occur in the tombs, most commonly in the Atsividhero tombs. There was one ofType 1 (A3.1), one ofType 2 (A3.2), two probable cups of the rounded type (Al.l, A3.4), and one conical cup (M16.1).

Cups. Scale 1:4. globular cup came from M 4 (M4.1), and an unusual carinated cup from M 8 (M8.5). Most of these cups were decorated with either blob or monochrome decoration. Two have surfaces that are laminated or coated with sediment, making identification of the decoration impossible (A3.2, M16.1). There are few chronological indicators in the cups; no shape or decoration seems to belong to a particular phase of LM IIIC at the site. This is in keeping with what is known about cups elsewhere on Crete.14 Carinated cups of Type 1 with blob decoration have been identified elsewhere as late LM IIIC or SM,15 although an example does appear at Sybrita/Thronos in early LM IIIC.16 As with the deep bowl, there may be a tendency for the foot to become higher during the period, but a low foot is not a necessary indication that the vessel is early. The use of the zigzag is found throughout LM IIIC, although it seems to appear with greater frequency on deep bowls or cups from earlier dumps on the site (especially K 76); the zigzag is also the most common decoration on deep bowls from Kastri, which should date in the first half of LM IIIC.17 Blob decoration is found in the pottery from the early dumps and street deposits at Karphi, but it also appears on nearly complete vessels abandoned on the floors of the settlement and in the Atsividhero tombs. Blob decoration is found in all three phases of the Kavousi Kastro settlement,18 and was particularly common in late deposits at Khania, which still date to early LM IIIC.19 Blob cups are found in greatest quantity in the earlier LM IIIC deposits in Building B at Kavousi 14 Hallager 2000, 138-9. 15 Mountjoy 2007, 224. 16 D'Agata 1999, 190, fig. 5.3.17. 17 Kastri, 286. 18 Mook and Coulson 1997. 19 Hallager 2000, 141.</page><page sequence="268">POTTERY ANALYSIS Vronda,20 while monochrome cups and deep bowls appear in all phases. The cup with wavy line (K81.1) resembles the later SM wavy-line cups21 and may date to very early SM; wavy line cups, however, do have a long history and go back to the early LMIIIC deposits, as at Khamalevri.22 There are only two examples of cups in the medium coarse category (K23.21, K.34). Both are of the rounded type, and K23.21 is blue ware. Neither shows any sign of decoration. Deep bowl (FIG. 9.2) The deep bowl is the single most common fine shape encountered at Karphi, and it is nearly ubiquitous. Seiradaki presents nine different types of bowls in her publication,23 but only two are true deep bowls (Types 1 and 3). Type 2, which comes from Ta Mnemata Tomb 8, might better be called a skyphos, the closest example at Karphi to the bell skyphos so popular in SM-PG times elsewhere on Crete;24 it is discussed below (pp. 265-6). Type 4 is only a base with a baggy globular body; it was not found, and there are no other similar bases preserved in the material. Type 5 might be categorised as a kantharos, but there seems to have been only a single example made out of coarse ware, and it was not located; the shape is very similar to the krater from K 23 (Seiradaki Type 4), although smaller. Type 6 is a miniature shallow spouted bowl, and is dealt with below. The other types (Types 7, 8, 9) are all varieties of the shape known as the krateriskos, and are discussed below. Of the two types of deep bowls identified by Seiradaki, Type 1 has a deep rounded body that rises straight to the rim, with either vertical or flaring sides. The foot is raised and concave underneath, and the handles are set high on the body, although not as high as on Type 3. Type 3 is similar, but has a body that is carinated or nearly so, and the handles are set higher; the carination is not always clear and does not always show up on the drawings. It also appears in two varieties: one type has nearly vertical sides, while on the other type the sides are more flaring. The rounded deep bowl is more prevalent than the carinated variety among the nearly complete examples, and among the rounded varieties, those with the flaring sides outnumber those whose sides rise vertically. Mountjoy's suggestion that there is a gradual development of the Cretan deep bowl over LM IIIC from vertical sides to outward leaning and finally to carinated sides,25 cannot be substantiated by the pottery from Karphi, where the different types seem to occur together in all deposits. Nearly all of the deep bowls can be put into these two categories, although there is a great variation in the types of rims and bases, and in the position of the handles; these same two major types have also been recognised at Khania.26 One example (K38.1) is unusual in having an almost S-curved profile, and its height is much smaller in proportion to the diameter than is customary; the difference may reflect an earlier date, suggested by the stemmed spiral motif with parallels on LMIIIB pottery, or place of manufacture, as is suggested by petrographic analysis. Seiradaki also mentioned another possible type, represented by a bowl with fluted sides, that she thought might have had metallic prototypes, but unfortunately she was unable to locate it for the 1960 publication.27 This is certainly the unique deep bowl K110.2, which resembles the arcade pattern of a stone blossom bowl and is close to Type 3. Rim diameters for deep bowls vary from 8-20, but most have diameters from 12-14; some of the smaller examples may actually be cups. Bowls with rim diameters greater than 20 have been classed as kraters. Deep bowls show a variety of rims. Nearly all of the bowls are the lipless variety, the majority what Mountjoy would classify as flaring lipless;28 the rest are straight or vertical lipless. A few examples have real lips, or have rims that are thickened on the interior below the rim. One variant of the lipless rim is oblique on the interior (e.g. K27.1, K120.1, K46.1) and resembles an example from Phaistos;29 these may not have been produced locally,30 or the unusual rim may indicate a chronological or functional difference. Bases vary little in size, ranging from 3.4-6; the majority fall within 4-5.5. Bases are nearly always raised and they are concave underneath. The few raised flat bases come from areas below streets or from the few lower deposits that were identified (K76.25, K17.15, K12.9), so must be thought of as an early 20 Day 1997, 400, fig. 6.3-5; Kavousi IIA, fig. 25. 21 For example, Warren 1982-83, 83, fig. 60. 22 Andreadaki-Vlasaki and Papadopoulou 2007, 51, fig. 8.32. 23 Seiradaki, 21. 24 In essence, the 'skyphos' is a development from the Bronze Age deep bowl, and should be thought of as the same shape. Modern scholarship, however, generally is split between those who work on Bronze Age material and refer to deep bowls, and others who work on material from PG on who call the shape the skyphos. SM specialists generally speak of skyphoi, rather than deep bowls, since it is in this period that the bell shaped, high-footed skyphos first appears. The two shapes and the two terms should not be thought of as implying a particular group of people (i.e. pre-Greeks or non-Greeks using deep bowls, Greeks using skyphoi). 25 Mountjoy 19995, 512. 26 Hallager 2000, 139; she calls them carinated bowls and deep bowls. A third type of bowl recognised at Khania is a one handled bowl characterised by a conical profile and lipless rim that Hallager believes is similar to FS 242. 27 Seiradaki, 21. 28 Mountjoy 1986, 201. 29 Borgna 1997a, 278, fig. 6.1; see also D'Agata 1999,192 and parallels cited in n. 19. She thinks this is a cup, rather than a deep bowl. 30 A similar one also appears at Kommos, and this may be a Mesara type; see Watrous 1992, fig. 68.1921.</page><page sequence="269">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI — A RE-EXAMINATION K76.1 K36.1 K79-89.2 K120N.1 K68.1 MK.7 K68.2 K115.2 K38.1 M14.1 K83.1 TYPE 1 K61.1 K27.1 TYPE 3 Fig. 9.2.

Feet vary in height and in the depth of the concavity; it would appear that there was a develop ment from the flat-bottomed raised base to a progressively more concave raised base during the history of the settlement.31 A few feet are so concave that they approach the later conical foot of SM and PG date, including K82.3 and K115.2, and these should be amongst the latest examples in the settlement. The true conical foot, however, is not found in the settlement pottery, but is present on several vases from the tombs, particularly on krateriskoi and stirrup jars; K.2 also has a conical foot, but its context is uncertain and it may also come from the tombs. Sometimes the base has a torus moulding (K76.19, K76.21), or is rounded in profile (K79-89.2, K68.2, K23.58, K12.28); both of these features may be early, as examples appear in lower deposits or dumps. Occasionally, there is a true ring base (K12.10, K37.1, K68.1, K76.24, K83.1, and K94.1). Ring bases have been seen as a Mycenaean or Mycenaeanising element in LMIIIC pottery,32 but none of the Karphi examples is obviously imported, and they may imitate a Mycenaean type. At least two examples come from early deposits, a fact that suggests that such types, while rare, do occur throughout the settlement's history. There were seven fine deep bowls in blue ware (Kl.1-3, K23.56, K106.ll, K69.1, K132.1), three of them from the Temple area; the only medium-coarse blue ware bowl (K116.5), with a very warped profile, is similar to the examples in finer wares. All of these with preserved bases have rather high concave feet, and they look late. Most seem to have been intended as carinated but their shapes have become so warped that it is difficult to tell how these could have served a useful function. Some of the fine deep bowls in blue ware that do not seem obviously to be painted may have been plain. Since the surfaces are so often damaged however, it is impossible to be certain. The deep bowls from the tombs are similar in type to those found in the settlement. Only one is definitely of the carinated type (A3.3) and is decorated with blob decoration; another may be M8.6, which is mono chrome. The others are of the rounded type with flaring sides (M14.1, M8.7). Of the three bases, all are raised and concave, M14.1 and A3.3 rather low, A2.1 high. A miniature cup or finger pot was found in K 106 (K106.2); this was very crude, little more than a small disc with a finger impression in the centre. Decoration Nearly all of the bowls are monochrome-painted on the interior, except for those which have blob decoration on both interior and exterior. Only four examples were found with plain interiors with painted rim band or (more occasionally) bands: K.6, K106.3, K46.2, K12.2, and possibly K76.14; these may be imported from outside Crete, as indicated by the fact that their fabrics are harder than usual.33 Seventeen examples of decorated deep bowl rims (c. 6%) have reserved bands on the interior, of which four at least also have reserved discs. Few come from the early deposits, but of the 13 nearly complete decorated examples of the deep bowl, seven have the reserved band, indicating that this feature was popular at the end of the settlement's history, whenever it was introduced into Crete; the deep bowl from M 14 (M14.1) also shows the reserved band. The reserved band on the deep bowl is one of the clear indications of LM IIIC date, but there has been much controversy about the precise date of its appearance in Crete,34 and although the Karphi material does not help to determine when it came into use, it can show the popularity of the reserved band throughout the LM IIIC period until the end. The reserved disc occurs in the bottom of fourteen deep bowls, or roughly 32% of the total number of preserved bases. Reserved discs appear on seven of the 13 nearly complete vessels, suggesting that the motif was popular at the end of LM IIIC at Karphi, although its appearance in several bowls in the K 76 deposit suggests that it was found in the earlier phases as well. There is only one example of a base with a spiral or concentric circles on the interior (K57.2); this may be an early feature, as at Khania-Kastelli.35 There is some variety in the treatment of the underside of the bases. The underside of most bases was left unpainted, but they can be monochrome-painted (K45.3, K76.20, K120N.1), have a band around the outer edge (K40.4, K76.19, K76.21), a spiral or circle (K76.22), or a blob or line (K79-89.2, K115.2). The exterior surfaces of deep bowls are decorated in the following three ways: with motifs, with blobs, or monochrome. Decorated bowls show a wide variety of motifs. Usually LM IIIC deep bowls have been categorised as being either of the open style, with a few isolated motifs, or the close style, characterised by the use of many patterns that cover the entire surface of the vessel.36 Other scholars prefer the term 'fringed style' for this elaborate Cretan style of LM IIIC, but that term causes problems because fringes are used as a decorative element in other pottery periods, and because some of this style of pottery in LM IIIC comes 31 This tendency toward a higher and more concave foot can be observed in deep bowls on the mainland in LH IIIC; see Mountjoy 1986, 205. 32 Kanta 1997, 87-8. 33 The exception is K12.2, which has the same soft fabric as found in local fine ware; the slip, however, is of a higher quality than is customary. 34 The most recent discussions of this phenomenon has been Mountjoy 1999b, 512-3; 2007, 224. 35 Kanta 1997, 88. 36 See, for example, Mook and Coulson 1997, Prokopiou 1997, Rethemiotakis 1997.</page><page sequence="271">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION without fringes.37 Mountjoy has pointed out the problems of using the term 'close style' for Cretan pottery, and like her, I have preferred Schachermeyr's term 'pleonastic style' for the heavily decorated type of pottery.38 The majority of deep bowls are decorated with the simple motifs of the open style; under 10% are done in the pleonastic style, with multiple motifs, fringes, and/or fillers, generally on bowls whose rim diameters are larger than the usual range, that is, greater than 14. It would seem that there is a correlation between the size of the deep bowl and the type of decorative scheme employed; the larger bowls tend to be more elaborately decorated, while the smaller examples generally are decorated in the simple open style. This correlation can also be seen in the fact that kraters are more often decorated in the pleonastic style than in the open style. The decorative zone for deep bowls lies between a band on the rim and one or more set below the handles. The vast majority of bowls have a rather wide rim band. Only six bowls have no rim band at all (K120.1, K38.2, K23.35, K138.1, K23.1, K32.1). The absence of the rim band can also be found on deep bowls from Knossos and Phaistos, probably dating to early LM IIIC.39 Three other deep bowls have a double or triple band at the rim (K91.1, K61.3, K106.10), an unusual feature, but not without parallels on LM IIIC pottery.40 The bottom of the decorative zone is marked off by one (15 examples), two (13 examples), three (two examples) or more (one example) bands. There seems to be no chronological distinction among these types of bands. The base always has a band. Only one deep bowl has a solidly painted lower half: K120N.1. The motifs employed on deep bowls are many and varied. Seiradaki published a selection,41 some typical (e.g. fig. 21a, b, c, e, f, g, i), others uncommon (e.g. fig. 2Id, h, i, k, 1, m, n).42 Spirals The spiral comprises the most common recognisable motif on decorated deep bowls (14%), and there are several varieties. The buttonhook spiral is most common (FIG. 9.3 a), appearing on at least 15 examples (K27.1, K29.1-3, K29.7, K31.6, K32.1, K32.9, K36.1, K61.7, K66.1, K68.2, K76.4, K91.1, K106.10, K106.15, K120N.1, and possibly K44.1), including four of the nearly complete vessels, and three from street deposits. Three of the four nearly complete deep bowls with buttonhook spirals also have reserved bands and three have reserved discs. The buttonhook spiral is one of the hallmarks of the LM IIIC,43 and the motif occurs on deep bowls at every site with early LM IIIC (Kastri, Knossos, Khamalevri, Khania, Kastelli Pediada, and Kavousi Kastro). At late LM IIIC sites such as Khalasmenos and Kavousi-FrowJo, however, the motif does not seem so popular, if it appears at all. At Karphi it appears in two forms, one with a rounded hook, the other with an angular hook. The two can appear together in the same deposits, and there is no apparent chronological difference. Less popular are running spirals (FIG. 9.3 b), which appear on only seven examples (K80.1-2, K43.5, K147.2-3, K147.7-8). Other forms of spiral appear on at least 20 other deep bowls (K12.4, K23.4, K23.38, K29.6, K29.9, K31.7, K32.2, K38.3, K39.1, K41.1, K52.2, K52.4, K75.5, K101.5, K107.1, K108.1, K108.4, K121.1, K127.2, K143.1). Multiple loops or concentric semicircles44 Also popular at Karphi are multiple loops (13%); most of these look like loops, rather than an attempt at freehand semicircles. These are most often found in pendent form (FIG. 9.3 c), either hanging from the rim or rim band (K23.72 — fringed, K43.3, K61.2, K76.1, K76.6, K85.1, K97.3, K101.1, K117.1, K120.2, K124.2 — with solid centre), K148.3, K149.3, K149.5-6), or hanging in the middle of the decorative field (K12.24, K17.ll, K32.3, K32.5, K44.2, K71.1, K76.7-8, K106.7-8, K149.4), When hanging from the rim band, the multiple loops can occur with other patterns: alternating with multiple stems (K31.5, K120.1), with filled lozenge (K110.1), or with a flower (K73.3). Less frequently, the loops appear upright (FIG. 9.3 d), floating in the empty field (K29.8, K40.1, K43.6, K79-89.2, K147.1) or attached to the lower band (K149.12). K76.29 has alternating pendent and upright loops, a motif that finds parallels at Khamalevri in early LMIIIC.45 Multiple loops can also appear lying horizontally on their sides (K79-89.9). Multiple loops can be found on pottery from all phases of LM IIIC.46 The pendent loops not attached to the rim appear in early deposits at Knossos, at Kastri, Kastelli Pediada, and Khamalevri.47 Upright loops 37 Hallager and Hallager 1997, 330-1. 38 Mountjoy 19996, 513; see Schachermeyr 1979, 206. 39 Popham 1965, 322, fig. 3.4; 325, fig. 5.18; 326, fig. 6.31. 40 See, for example, Kastri, 287, fig. 8a, e, f; 288, fig. 9a, d, n; Rethemiotakis 1997,321, fig. 31k(KastelliPediada); Borgna 2003, pi. 3.5, 12.111, 14.130; Andreadaki-Vlasaki and Papadopoulou 2005, 371, fig. 30 (Khamalevri, Phase I). 41 Seiradaki, fig. 21. 42 Fig. 21b is illustrated upside down; fig. 21d was not located. 43 Hallager 2000, 141-2; Popham 1965, 327; Andreadaki Vlasaki and Papadopoulou 2005, 279. 44 This motif is called either multiple loops or concentric semicircles. Most of the examples found at Karphi are so crudely made that calling them concentric semicircles gives a false impression of their regularity. They are therefore called multiple loops in this discussion. 45 Andreadaki-Vlasaki and Papadopoulou 2005, 368, fig. 23 (Phase I). 46 Hallager 2000, 141. 47 Popham 1965, 325, fig. 5.25, 27 (Knossos); Kastri, 295, fig. 15.P27; Rethemiotakis 1997, 309, fig. lOi (Kastelli, Phase I); Andreadaki-Vlasaki and Papadopoulou 2007,49, fig. 6.10 (Khamalevri, Phase II); 52, fig. 9.3 (Khamalevri, Phase I).</page><page sequence="272">POTTERY ANALYSIS Fig. 9.3. Motifs on deep bowls. appear in early LM IIIC at Kastri and in late LM IIIC at Kavousi- Kastro.4* Alternating pendent and upright loops appear early as well at Knossos, Khamalevri, Kastelli Pediada, and Phaistos.49 The less common horizontally-placed multiple loops may be an early feature; they appear on bowls from early deposits at Kavousi-fozs/ro, and at Knossos.50 Thus, all these variations would appear to belong to early LM IIIC. There are, however, few parallels for the pendent loops that hang from the rim and which is the most common form of the motif at Karphi, so this variation may be more popular in the later phases of LM IIIC; the occurrence of this motif in the Kephala tholos at Knossos supports this idea, although it seems to belong to an earlier phase of LM IIIC than much of the tomb material.51 Panelled patterns Panelled patterns are also common on the deep bowls (11%), and they come in several varieties, including butterfly or double axe and half medallion (Popham's wavy border,52 Hallager's panelled pattern).53 The butterfly or double axe pattern (K23.5, K29.5, K40-41.2, K73.2, K76.33, K100.2, K144.1) (FIG. 9.3 e) 48 Kastri, 287, fig. 8:0; Mook and Coulson 1997, 360-2: fig. 37.150; it also appears in the dump deposit on the Kastro, 358, fig. 10.117, of mixed date, Phases I—II and possibly III. 49 Warren 2007, 342, fig. 7: PI83 (Knossos); Andreadaki Vlasaki and Papadopoulou 2005, 368, fig. 23 (Khamalevri, Phase I); Rethemiotakis 1997, 309, fig. 10c (Kastelli, Phase I); Borgna 2003, 441, fig. 15.164 (Phaistos, late LM IIIB). 50 Mook and Coulson 1997, 358, fig. 30.117 (Kavousi-Kastro, Phases I—II); Popham 1965, 325, fig. 5.26 (Knossos). 51 Cadogan 1967, 281, fig. 2.8; for the redating of this and several other vessels in the tomb, see D'Agata 2007, 101, table 3; Preston 2005. 52 Popham 1970ft, 199-200, fig. 3.40. 53 Hallager 2000, 140, fig. 31.</page><page sequence="273">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION probably originated in the double axe, but by LMIIIC was exploited as a decorative pattern and may have lost its explicitly religious meaning, although more realistic double axes are illustrated on larger vessels in pleonastic style, often in association with horns of consecration (see below under kraters). The motif is often shown with outlines, sometimes multiple outlines, and/or with filler motifs. Hallager suggested that the motif is a LM IIIB one,54 but it is certainly found on LM IIIC pottery at Knossos, Sybrita/Thronos, and Kavousi- Vronda.55 Another variation on the panelled pattern has a group of vertical lines with a half medallion or wavy border (K31.1, K79-89.5) (FIG. 9.3 f). Such a pattern can be found on deep bowls from nearly every LM IIIC site.56 A single example is also found in the Karphi graves on a possible deep bowl or tankard (M8.9). At least three deep bowls have a panel with a quatrefoil leaf pattern on one side (FIG. 9.3 h) (K23.51, K31.4, K46.4), similar to examples from Kastri and Kavousi-Kastro of early LM IIIC date, and from Petras and Knossos of advanced LM IIIB date.57 These vessels would date early in the LM IIIC period. Other panelled patterns have various motifs in the centre between vertical bands: chevrons (K106.12, K106.14, K108.5, K122.1-2) (FIG. 9.3 g), wavy lines (K21.2, K76.35, K81.2) or zigzags (K106.4), crosshatching (K23.6, K56.1), horizontal bars (K43.4), and triangles with alternating strokes (K39.1, K31.4). Other panelled patterns have combinations that include scallops (K75.3), triangles with strokes in the angles (K61.1) and U-pattern with a curvilinear motif (K61.3). Other panelled patterns are too worn or fragmentary to make out (K23.37, K76.27, K121.4). Panelled patterns are varied and common on the deep bowls from Karphi. No nearly complete bowls are decorated with panelled patterns, and they occur most frequently on small fragments, suggesting that the motif was more common in the earlier phases of the settlement, but that its popularity had waned towards the end. Only one large fragment of a deep bowl that might have belonged with the final use was decorated with a panelled pattern that was worn but included triangles with strokes in the angles and an oval in the centre (K61.1); this is also an unusual shape, with sharply carinated sides and a very flaring straight rim, and it may not represent the local style. Multiple stems (fig. 9.3 i) There are many examples (8%), almost all fragmentary, of the use of multiple stems, probably in a variety of arrangements (K33.1, K38.5, K39.2, K46.2, K52.3, K57.1, K67.1, K79-89.10, K79-89.12, K80.3, K90.1, K97.2, K106.9, K147.4, K149.1, K149.9). Occasion ally these are angular (K31.5, K68.4). Sometimes the multiple stems meet in arcs (K76.2); these have parallels in deep bowls from Khania of LM IIIB:2/C style and from Pit 5 at Sybrita/Thronos of very early LM IIIC date.58 One example has multiple stems alternating with loops (K120.1). K31.2 has multiple stems with U-patterns between them; a similar U pattern can be found on a fragment from Amnisos.59 Multiple-stemmed spirals appear on three bowls (K38.1, K43.1, K121.2); this motif is common in LM IIIB,60 but also exists in early LM IIIC at Knossos.61 Multiple stems alternating with spirals appear on K29.6. Multiple stems are used as a decorative device on deep bowls of all phases of LM IIIC, and the motif does not seem to be a reliable chronological indicator. Quirk (fig. 9.3 j) The quirk is a popular pattern at Karphi (5%), as on other LM IIIC sites (Kll.l, K28.1, K29.4, K32.7-8, K68.7, K76.15, K76.17, K79-89.8, K91.2, K101.4, K.4, K.8, K.9). Many of the examples come from street or court deposits, and nearly all are small fragments, so the motif may have been more popular in the earlier phases than later LM IIIC. Some of the examples have smaller rim diameters and may be cups, rather than bowls, but it is also possible that the motif was more popular for smaller vessels than for the larger ones. The motif appears in a variety of forms, from a tight S-shape to a looser running motif, but it never seems to occur, as elsewhere, in a form which is closer to alternating semicircles, and which is more common on the mainland.62 Minoan flower The Minoan flower is also popular (5%), and distinctive (fig. 9.3 k). It is most often placed lying vertically (K12.19, K38.4, K43.2, K46.1, K68.5, K75.1, K76.28, K76.32, K79-89.4, K79-89.ll, K117.2, K147.9), but in one case stands upright (K106.5). The interior of the flower is shown with a V-pattern, loops, or multiple U-pattern. One example (K79-89.4), more likely a cup than a bowl, has a more elaborate interior arrangement with hatching between bands. One example may be a 54 Hallager 2000, 174, n. 343. 55 Popham 1965,323, fig. 4.7-9 (Knossos); D'Agata 1999,199, fig. 10.36.19 (krater of late LM IIIC date, Sybrita/Thronos); Prokopiou 1997, 377, fig. 18e (on a krater from Sybrita/ Thronos); Day et al, forthcoming. 56 Kastri, 287, fig. 8q; Mook and Coulson 1997, 344, fig. 8.23 (Kavousi-fesfro, Phase II); Borgna 1997a, 278, fig. 6.1 (Phaistos); Khania II, 140, fig. 31, pi. 36. 57 Kastri, 287, fig. 8m; Mook and Coulson 1997,352, fig. 18.55, 63 (Kavousi-fowfro, Phase II); Tsipopoulou 1997, 220, fig. 18d 91.144.2; Popham 1964, 14.11, pi. 8a. 58 Khania II, 110, pi. 36.80-P 0446; D'Agata 1999,194-5, fig. 7 (Sybrita/Thronos). 59 Kanta 1980, fig. 15.12. 60 Popham 19706, pi. 51a, c. 61 Warren 2007, 338, fig. 3.P2143. 62 Popham 1965, 327.</page><page sequence="274">POTTERY ANALYSIS Mycenaean flower (K21.1), like an example from Khania.63 Additionally, some of the small fragments with fringed decoration may come from Minoan flowers. An example of an upright Minoan flower may have been a floral spray or tree (K48.2). A number of fragments with the Minoan flower motif come from lower deposits, from beneath later streets (K 76, K117) or from courtyards (K 79-89), where they are most likely to represent earlier material that was discarded. None of the nearly complete deep bowls has this motif, and it is likely that it was more popular in the earlier phases of LM IIIC than later on. Certainly the motif appears in the early LM IIIC deposits at Knossos, Kastelli Pediada, Kastrokephala, Khamalevri, Kavousi-A'a.s/ro, and Khania,64 but not in the late LM IIIC deposits at Khalasmenos and Kavousi-Fro«da. Lozenge Hatched and crosshatched lozenges (FIG. 9.31) are quite common (4%), although not as popular as at Kastri; From the fragmentary nature of the material, it is often impossible to tell if the motif was a lozenge chain or simply isolated lozenges, so the two motifs are here taken together. Hatched lozenges are the more common, in a chain (K24.1, K97.1) or isolated (K56.2, K124.3, K127.5, K147.5-6). The lozenge-and-loop pattern found at other sites only decorates a single deep bowl at Karphi (K.7), and the lozenge is cross hatched. Other filled lozenge patterns are also found, probably not in chains, one with crosshatching (K149.13), two with chevrons (K45.1, K124.4), one with loops (K127.3), two with alternating strokes (K56.3, K110.1). A hatched lozenge, perhaps part of a chain, appears on deep bowl or tankard M8.9, along with a half medallion. Crosshatched (K149.10) or hatched (K107.2) lozenges also appear as the central pattern in tricurved streamer motifs. The hatched lozenge is a particularly common motif in early LM IIIC deposits, appearing at Kastri, Khania, Khamalevri, Kavousi-Frowda, and Phaistos.65 Similarly, the lozenge filled with loops also seems to be an early feature, for it is popular at Kastri.66 The lozenge filled with loops, however, is used in a panelled pattern with scalloped edges on the dress of one of the goddesses from the Temple, which was still in use at the end of LM IIIC, whenever the statue was made.67 At Karphi there are no nearly complete vessels with filled lozenges, only fragments, so it would appear to have gone out of popularity in late LM IIIC. Zigzag The zigzag is not as popular at Karphi as at other LM IIIC sites, and only six examples exist (K23.36, K54.1, K76.14, K76.16, K103.2, K138.1), the last in two registers. The motif appears in fragments from lower deposits and streets, but not on nearly complete vessels, suggesting that it was a popular motif in the earlier phases of the settlement. This fits with the pattern that can be observed elsewhere; the motif appears in the Knossos deposit, which contains material that seems to be early LM IIIC.68 It is the most common motif in LM IIIC Kastri, and is popular on deep bowls from the earlier LM IIIC deposits in Building B at Kavousi Vronda.69 The motif is equally popular on cups, and many of the fragments with zigzag may come from cups rather than bowls. Related to the zigzag is the zone of short strokes found on K3.2. This has a close parallel at Phaistos.70 Wavy band The wavy band (FIG. 9.3 m) is found on one nearly complete deep bowl from the settlement (K68.1) and another from the tombs (M14.1), which also has a reserved band. Three other fragments (K12.2, K23.3, K79-89.13) may be from cups or deep bowls, the last resembling the large cup K81.1. The wavy band appears on deep bowls in early LM IIIC at Khania, Knossos, and Phaistos,71 but this thick wavy line may be a feature of late LM IIIC deep bowls and cups. It survived as a dominant form of decoration on the SM 'wavy-line' cup.72 Tricurved streamer The tricurved streamer appears on at least seven examples of the deep bowl (FIG. 9.3 n-o). Where the central motif is still preserved it can be a crosshatched (K149.10) or hatched (K107.2) lozenge, a hatched loop (K124.1), alternating strokes (K83.1), or a floral motif (K106.3, K68.3). K108.2 may also be a tricurved streamer, or a variation on the multiple stem motif; it is similar to K150.1 and finds a close parallel at Sybrita/ 63 Khania II, 141, fig. 31, pi. 35.80-P 0524. 64 Popham 1965, 327-8 (Knossos); Rethemiotakis 1997, 317, fig. 26h-i, k-n, p (Kastelli); Kanta and Karetsou 2003, 153, fig. 3B (Kastrokephala); Andreadaki-Vlasaki 2005,371, fig. 31 (Khamalevri, Phase I—II); 373, fig. 34 (Phase I); 2007, 47, fig. 4.27-8 (Phase I); Mook and Coulson 1997, 344, fig. 8.13 (Kavousi -Kastro, Phase I); 352, fig. 18.66, 69 (Phase II); Khania II, 141, fig. 31, pi. 35.80-P 0524. 65 Kastri, 287, fig. 8i; 294, fig. 14.P2; 295, fig. 15.P21; Khania II, 141, pi. 36.70-P0160 (+70-P 0906); Andreadaki-Vlasaki and Papadopoulou 2005, 370, fig. 29 (Khamalevri, Phase I); 2007, 47, fig. 4.29 (Phase II); Day 1997, 396, fig. 3.5 (Kavousi -Vronda, early LMIIIC; Borgna 2003,435, fig. 9.82 (Phaistos, LM IIIB late); 436, fig. 10.102; 443, fig. 17.181. 66 Kastri, 287, fig. 8j. 67 Rethemiotakis 1998, 22.19, fig. 56. 68 Popham 1965, 325, fig. 5.21-3. 69 Kastri, 286; Kavousi IIA, fig. 25.

Bivalve shell The bivalve shell motif (K23.59, K32.4, K43.7) is not common, and it is almost certainly early, appearing only in early deposits under floors or in streets. The motif is found on LM IIIB pottery,77 and when it does appear in LM IIIC contexts, it is generally considered transitional LM IIIB/C.78 K38.2 has a variation on the bivalve shell that is similar to examples from Knossos and Kastri.79 Multiple-outlined ovals This motif is found on a number of vessels, where the ovals are set at an angle or horizontally (K12.21, K44.3, K61.5, K68.6, K101.6). Multiple-outlined ovals appear commonly on LM IIIC pottery at Khania.80 K44.3 may be a floral motif, as it is set close to upright, and there are other motifs on either side. K12.21 has a solid centre. A variant has upright ovals (K32.6, K76.13), on one of which two small dots have been placed, making it look like a face with eyes (FIG. 9.3p). Similar motifs can be found at Kastri and Kastelli Pediada, both of early LM IIIC date.81 Hatched ovals There is only a single preserved example of this motif on deep bowls, although it appears regularly on stirrup jars. On bowls it consists of a chain of hatched ovals with dots at the end, a combination that looks like kissing fishes (K61.6). Antithetic spirals This motif, which is common on other LM IIIC pottery in central and western Crete,82 is not frequent at Karphi. There may be a single example of its use on K39.1. Other A number of other motifs occur, but only one or two times. Chevrons appear in horizontal bands on two deep bowls (K76.26, K149.7). A chevron shell decorates K76.30. Stacked pendent loops or scale pattern appear on two examples, one fringed (K127.1), the other not (K40.3). The gremlin or imp (K115.2) appears on a nearly complete vessel and may be thought of as a late decoration. Another fragment may bear a human or bird head (K91.3). A variant of the comb motif (K12.18, K100.1) appears on two vessels, although one of them is probably a cup. Many other fragments bear fringed decoration (K61.4) or filler arcs (K31.3, K33.1, K74.1, K75.2, K76.3, K76.34, K79-89.7, K148.2, K149.8). Blob decoration Blob decoration appears on deep bowls as well as on cups. Nine blob bowls or cups exist from the settlement, of which two have preserved handles, so they are clearly deep bowls (K82.1, K22.1), while others may be and from their shapes are more likely to be, cups (K48.3, K76.ll, K88.1, K101.3, K.ll). K76.12 is almost certainly a cup, probably of Type 2. On all the other uncertain examples, the rim diameter is always much smaller than normal, ranging from 8-11, so this decoration may have been considered appropriate to smaller open vessels (as can be seen also from its use on juglets and small feeding bottles). A blob-decorated deep bowl came also from Atsividero (A3.3), and the later skyphos from Ta Mnemata (M4.2) is also decorated with blobs. The blob decoration is created by dipping the vessel into the paint, coating one side, and then holding that side and dipping the other side into the paint. This sometimes results in a drip towards the base, as can be seen on A3.3. Blob decoration seems to be found in all phases of LM IIIC. The prevalence of this form of decoration in the deposit from K 76, where there is much very broken fine ware that may represent dump of earlier material under the later room, suggests that it was in use early in the settlement's history. Its use in the tombs both at Ta Mnemata and at Atsividhero indicates that it was also employed in the late phases of LM IIIC, since none of these tombs seems to contain early material. Monochrome deep bowl A number of deep bowls are apparently decorated with a monochrome wash inside and out (MK.7, K23.34, K51.1, K82.2, K.2-3). When the vessel is represented by only a single small fragment, it is impossible to tell if it was monochrome-painted or the painted part of a 73 D'Agata 1999, 195, fig. 7.5.34. 74 Hallager 2000, 141; 2007, 190. 75 Khania II, 39.71 -P 0908, 71 -P 0735; Andreadaki-Vlasaki and Papadopoulou 2007, 50, fig. 7.21. 76 Gesell, Coulson and Day 1991, 166, fig. 6.5; Borgna 2003, 442, fig. 46.172. 77 Popham 19706, 198, fig. 2.11; pi. 49a, 50a. 78 Gesell, Day, and Coulson 1995, 118, fig. 22.2. 79 Popham 1965 329-30, fig. 8.50; he thinks this may be influenced from the mainland.

A monochrome deep bowl was also found outside one of the Ta Mnemata tombs (M8.6), and a cup or deep bowl came from Atsividero (A3.4). The presence of so many mono chrome fragments in the lowest deposit in Room K 23 suggests that the monochrome bowl or cup was popular early in the settlement history. Two of the monochrome vessels from the floor deposits elsewhere are nearly complete, showing that this style of decoration was also used at the very end of the LMIIIC, an idea that is given support by the appearance of monochrome decoration in the tomb deposits (M8.6, A3.4). Shallow bowl (FIG. 9.4) Seiradaki has only one example of a shallow bowl in her typology: Bowl Type 6.83 This is a spouted bowl, of which only two examples could be found: the miniature one illustrated (K121.6) and a larger decorated one from K 61 (K61.9), which is a smaller version of FS 294 and is not common on Crete. Spouted bowls or cups do appear at Kourtes and Adromyloi with transitional LM IIIB-C material, at Milatos in LM IIIA-C,84 and at Knossos, perhaps in the transitional period between LM IIIB and LM IIIC.85 In LM IIIC the shape appears at Khalasmenos and Phaistos.86This example, with its fringed upright multiple loops is clearly LM IIIC. There are no good parallels for the shape or decoration of the miniature variety K121.6, although its profile does resemble FS 252, which has a carination very low on the body. Since this example has a lug at right angles to the spout rather than a handle, the parallel is not great. FS 252 does appear in LH IIIC contexts on Rhodes and Kephallonia.87 Only a single example of a shallow bowl exists in plain ware, a carinated side-spouted bowl from Ta Mnemata (M14.2). The shape is similar to FS 295, a shallow angular bowl, but there are no close parallels on Crete or the mainland. The base of this bowl is missing, but it is shallow and very angular, with a tall flaring rim above the carination, a single flat handle from the rim to carination, and at a right angle to the handle is a spout. The fabric of this vessel is also highly unusual, since it is a uniform dark grey throughout, and it may have been burned. A second type of shallow bowl has no spout and has horizontal flat handles pinched out below the rim (FS 296) (K121.5, K17.17). This shape is uncommon on Crete, although it is a well-known mainland type. On the mainland it seems always to be plain, but both of the Karphi examples have traces of paint. A similar plain bowl, but of earlier date, comes from Kastri.88 A deeper variety of the shape has been found in early LM IIIC deposits at Kavousi-Vronda and at Khalasmenos of late LM IIIC;89 both of these examples were decorated with blob decoration. The poor preservation of K121.5 makes it difficult to ascertain if there was decoration or if it was plain, while K17.17 is too small to determine the decoration. Plain shallow bowls are rare on Crete, although several do appear in Khania.90 Rim fragments K76.37-38 may also come from shallow bowls; they are decorated with blobs. A shallow bowl fragment from K 23 (K23.62) may be one of the above types or may constitute another type. It has a nearly carinated profile and is apparently plain or monochrome. Another possible bowl type is K33.3. This is a very shallow bowl and may be a krater base that has been so smoothed down that the edges look finished.91 It has a conical foot with a torus moulding on it, and short sides, with a rim that has been flattened on top and slopes down inward. It is monochrome painted. Possibly it was originally a krater base that was then smoothed and reused as a bowl or even a lid. Skyphos (FIG. 9.4) From the Ta Mnemata tombs come two examples of a shape that might be termed a skyphos rather than a deep bowl. M4.2 is similar to a deep bowl in shape, but it is much more flaring in profile. It is decorated with blob decoration and is similar to a bowl of late LM IIIC date from Khalasmenos.92 Somewhat easier is M8.1 (Seiradaki's Type 2 bowl), which is similar to several SM-EPG skyphoi.93 Of note here is the deeper, more bell-shaped profile, the conical foot, and the dipped decoration, which is related to the earlier blob decoration but done in a different fashion. Here the vessel is held at the base, and the whole piece is dipped into the paint. Skyphos/krateriskos (FIG. 9.4) Seiradaki's Type 8 bowl is represented by a single example from K 115 (K115.4). The shape is highly unusual, and it does not look like the later krateriskoi from Ml7 (Ml7.2-4). That it is meant to be an open shape can be seen from the monochrome-painted interior. The krateriskos shape came into use on the 83 Seiradaki, 21, fig. 16.6. 84 Kanta 1980,88, fig. 24.3 (Kourtes); 186,pl.72.6(Adromyloi); 125, fig. 53.11 (Milatos). 85 Hood, Huxley and Sandars 1958-59, 242, fig. 28.VII.10, VI. 1. 86 Tsipopoulou 2004, fig. 8.13.92-225; Borgna 2003, 452, pi. 26.5.1. 87 RMDP, 463—4; 1060-1061. 88 Kastri, 294, fig. 14.P3. 89 Kavousi IIA, fig. 26.B4 P21; Coulson and Tsipopoulou 1994, 85, fig. 19.3. 90 Hallager 2000, 157. 91 Seiradaki published it as a krater: fig. 16.8. 92 Tsipopoulou 2004, 118, fig. 8.11.95-365. 93 Warren 1982-83, 81, 86, fig. 64 (Knossos, SM); Boardman 1960, 132, 136, fig. 4 IV.3 (Ayios Ioannis, SM-MPG krateriskos); Tsipopoulou 1997, 458, fig. 2.5052 (EPG).</page><page sequence="277">THE POTTERY FROM KA RPH1—A RE-EXAMINA TION K61.9 TYPE 6 / , I M14.2 K121.5 W M4.2 K115.4 TYPE 8 M8.1 TYPE 2 1 w \ M17.3 M17.1 TYPE 7 Fig. 9.4.

Scale 1:4. mainland as early as LH IIIB, although it did not become popular until LH IIIC.94 The shape of K115.4 is very globular, with a deeply concave foot, and it finds no parallels on Crete; the closest example is a krateriskos from Kastri.95 A somewhat similar shape can be found from Skyros.96 Both of these parallels are true krateriskoi and are more closed shapes than the Karphi example. K115.4 is certainly later than most of the other pottery from the Karphi settlement, and it is datable to the earliest stages of SM. Krateriskos (FIG. 9.4) There are only four examples of the krateriskos at Karphi, and they come only from a single tomb.97 M17.1 (Seiradaki's Type 7 bowl) is highly unusual; it has two elliptical vertical handles from rim to shoulder instead of the usual round horizontal handles on the shoulder and a high conical foot and a very tall neck with an unusual flattened rim that is decorated with Mountjoy 1986, 124. Kastri, 295, fig. 15.P23. RMDP, 731, fig. 282.15 (LH IIIC, early). The same shape can be called either a krateriskos or an amphoriskos; the term krateriskos suggests that this was primarily an open shape, while labelling the shape amphoriskos indicates that it was a closed shape. The Karphi examples seem to be sufficiently finished on the interior to be counted as open shapes, even though they are not monochrome painted inside. The term krateriskos will therefore be used here.</page><page sequence="278">POTTERY ANALYSIS strokes. The interior is half painted, and the lower half has splatters of paint, making it difficult to determine if the piece was meant to be an open or a closed shape. Hallager suggested that the vessel is actually an amphoroid krater, to which it is similar in handles and rim type, an idea that seems plausible.98 Kanta dated it to advanced LM IIIC and cited Cypriote parallels," and it may be an import or imitation of a Cypriote shape.100 A similar example has recently been found at Sybrita/Thronos of late LM IIIC date; it has the same sort of handles and a similar shape and decoration (including the splatters on the interior), but the rim is much simpler.101 While the Karphi example may indeed belong to the late LM IIIC, it was found with other material that dates as late as EPG, so it does not necessarily have to have such an early date; the Cypriote parallels would also support a later date. Seiradaki's Type 9 bowl is another form of krateriskos, this one better known. Only two or three examples exist, all from M 17 (Ml7.2-4). Seiradaki's drawing is either a composite drawing of M17.4 and M17.2 or the vessel was broken up after it was drawn. Similar examples can be found in SM and EPG tombs on Crete.102 Common features include the high conical foot, deep S-shaped body and tall rim, with two round vertical handles on the shoulder. Kylix (FIG. 9.5) The kylix was not found in great quantity, but nearly every major room produced one or two; a few examples came from the larger Ta Mnemata tombs, but not from the Atsividhero tombs.103 Seiradaki distinguished four types of kylix.104 Type I was the most common, and is illustrated by an example from M4 (M4.6), which unfortunately has subsequently been broken and lost what had been preserved of its stem and handles. It is a large kylix with a bowl carinated just below the rim, twisted handles, and probably a tall stem. Seiradaki suggested that the handles for this type were more regularly plain, and that the stems most often had a bulge in the middle, like Types 2 and 3;105 K115.5 and K.15 may be more representative examples of Type 1. Type 2, which is smaller, has a tall stem with a bulge and a deep bowl carinated at the top and two regular vertical elliptical handles. The illustrated example (K3.4) has subsequently lost its stem, and the bowl seems to rise to a straight rim, without the carination found on Type 1, but with a slight ridge at the top of the lower handle attachment. Type 3 is also a large kylix with a tall bulged stem and a ridge at the point where the stem attaches to the body. It has a deep hollow on the foot, but the stem itself is not pierced. The body is conical and Seiradaki restores a plain flaring rim, although she suggests that it may have had a carination, like Type 1, and it certainly had handles like the others. Type 4 is represented only by a base from K 116, and it could not be located; Seiradaki described it as having a more splayed foot than usual. Few of the feet are preserved. Of the four surviving examples, one is rounded on top and concave underneath (K115.5), one is more conical and concave underneath (K7.1), one is flaring and totally hollow up to the bowl (K9.2), and one is quite flat with a small depression in the centre (K106.18). The miniature version from K 25 (K25.1) is similar to the last variety. Base diameters range from 7-8.5, and the rim is usually 2.5 to 3.5 times the diameter of the base. The stems either have a bulge in the centre or are straight, and the two types occur in about equal numbers. Kanta and Mountjoy suggested that the bulging stem is a feature of late LM IIIC kylikes,106 but it seems to be no certain chronological indicator at Karphi. A nearly complete vessel (K115.5) from a clearly late LM IIIC context has the bulging stem, and this would seem to support Kanta's idea. Both types can be found together in the same deposit, however, as in K 9. The majority of the stems were pierced in the Cretan fashion;107 of the preserved stems, ten were pierced (K9.2, K17.16, K32.ll, K82.4, K85.3, K97.4, K115.5, K140.1, K.15-16) and six were not (K7.1, K9.1, K12.12, K75.6, K106.18, K131.3); K3.4 may or may not have been pierced. The type of piercing varies. Some stems are pierced only about a third of the way up and become progressively narrower before stopping (K115.5). Most are pierced all the way up with a thin hole (K12.12, K32.ll, K82.4, K85.3, K97.4, K.15-16,). A few are pierced with a very wide hole (K9.2, K140.1, K17.16); in the case of K9.2, the oblique lines left on the interior of the stem by the potter's wheel are still visible. Stems were made separately and added onto the bowl. In several instances the vessel has broken at the point where the two were attached (K3.4, K140.1) showing how the bowl and top of the stem were scored at an oblique angle to make the attachment more secure, a feature illustrated by Seiradaki.108 Sometimes at the point of attachment an extra ridge of clay was added for strength (K7.1, K115.5), and occasionally incisions were added for a decorative effect (K85.3). The bowls of the kylikes are deep, although some of Type 1 have shallower bowls (K131.1, M4.6).

Occasionally another type of rim appears, one that is more flaring (K43.9, K76.40, K90.2), and sometimes with thickening on the interior (K131.2); one kylix (K3.4) has no carination and is lipless. The rim diameters range from 11-27 (not including the miniature example). These fall into two groupings, a smaller variety with rim diameters from 11-18 (nine examples), and a larger variety with rim diameters from 21—27 (six examples). Kylikes are generally elaborately decorated; one example may be monochrome (K23.63), but there are no certain examples that are plain. The stem is usually banded (K75.6, K82.4, K97.4, K106.18, K115.5, K140.1, K.16), but can be solidly painted (K85.3, K12.12, K.15). Occasionally the decoration covers the entire body of the kylix, but the rim above the carination most often bears a special decoration, usually strokes (K9.3, K11.3, K120.3, MK.l), sometimes fringes (K106.17, K115.5), a band (K.15, M8.8) or scallops (K131.1); strokes appear below the wide rim band on K3.4. K100.3 has alternating arcs on the rim, while K106.16 has a triangle of scale pattern with dots, and K90.2 bears a floral branch. Most of the decoration on the body is elaborate, with outlined vertical elements rising from the stem and curving out over the surface of the bowl; few kylikes are well enough preserved to show the entire pattern. A typical pattern for LMIIIC kylikes can be seen on K.15, which has an outlined bulbous element that may represent the body of an octopus, outlined, and probably with tricurved streamers for tentacles coming out at the top; a similar motif is known from Kavousi-Fronc/a and other LM IIIC deposits at Vrokastro, Kritsa, and Kastelli Pediada.109 Similar patterns may occur on K9.1, K97.4, K131.1, K140.1, and possibly MK.l and K120.3. K43.8 has what is perhaps a tricurved streamer with hatching in the centre. K131.3 is decorated with hatched lozenge and loops. Fragments identified as kylikes from their profiles are decorated with the following: a panelled pattern with a vertical chevron band and fringed outlined triangular motifs (K80.4), quatrefoil leaf with wavy border (K32.12), horizontal chevron band (K79-89.15), fringed spiral (K79-89.14), floral 'hooks' on either side of a hatched pattern (K79 89.16), and dotted curvilinear pattern (K72.1). Of the two kylikes from the tombs, M4.6 may have an octopus decoration, with alternating arcs on the rim; the spirals may represent the eyes on either side of the topknot. M8.8 is highly unusual, with a formalised pattern that may originally derive from a Mycenaean flower motif or represent a stylised octopus. A similar design can be found on a LM IIIC krater from Khania.110 The interiors of kylikes are always monochrome coated. No examples were found with a reserved band. Two fragments had reserved discs (K32.ll, K82.4). Since the reserved disc was never found on the nearly complete examples from late LM IIIC, it may be an earlier feature; at least one of the two examples was from an early street deposit (K 32). The kylix is certainly a shape that was introduced into Crete from the mainland in LM II, and it was popular as a drinking vessel throughout the LM III period; its development has been the subject of much study.111 The shape is popular at Karphi, but does not occur as frequently as the deep bowl. LM IIIC kylikes tend to be larger than those of earlier periods, as is also the case at Kavousi-Frowt/a and Khalasmenos in late LM IIIC.112 The size of these vessels and the fact that they appear in nearly every large house complex suggests their use in elite drinking rituals; the greatest number come from the Great House.113 Champagne cup (footed cup or goblet) (FIG. 9.5) Despite Hallager's rational discussion of the proper name for this shape,1141 have chosen to keep the highly descriptive (if misleading) name of 'champagne cup'. While it is not an accurate term, it has been so widely used that most scholars immediately visualise the shape, with its flaring base, short stem, and simple body with a single handle. There are only three certain examples found at Karphi, where the shape does not seem to have been popular. These are always fragments from the bases and stems, and no rims or bodies have been recognised. Two of the stems are monochrome coated (K12.ll, K76.39), while one is decorated with vertical blobs of paint on the stem, painted arcs on the underside, and a blob on the interior (K61.8). At Kavousi-Froflda, this shape was more popular in the earlier part of LM IIIC, and had nearly disappeared by the end of the period,115 and the same may be the case at Karphi, to judge from the relative paucity of nearly complete examples, and the fact that two of the examples of the shape came from deposits with a great deal of early material; some of the blob decorated cup rims found in these early deposits may come from champagne cups. Goblet or chalice (fig. 9.5) One stem from an unusual coarse goblet or chalice was found in a room in the Southern Houses (K28.5).

Coarse goblets are not otherwise known on the site, nor are there any close parallels. It may have been a chalice, but does not look like the preserved examples of the type. Chalice (FIG. 9.5) A large, coarse, open vessel with a stem was found in the Temple, and it has been called a chalice (K1.9). Unfortunately, it is broken on top and bottom, so the entire shape is not certain. It has a hollow stem and a thick ridge with a hook on the top at the joint of the stem to the body. The body is flaring, much like the bodies of coarse kalathoi. A similar chalice was also found in the Shrine at Kavousi- Vronda,116 and smaller and shallower, shape is known from Gazi.117 Fragments of two other possible small chalices, occurred in the material saved from the Temple. The chalice shape looks like a kalathos on a stem. Its function is uncertain, but in earlier periods the chalice form (a tall cylindrical or slightly flaring handleless cup on a stem) was found in ritual settings. Chalices were common at Kato Symi in the Proto- and Neopalatial levels,118 where they have been interpreted as vessels reserved for offerings to the divinity.119 Indeed, a chalice can be seen held by the seated figure, probably a divinity, approached by genii on the Tiryns gold ring. The only two certain examples found from LM IIIC come from shrines or temples (Karphi and Kavousi-Vronda), so the shape may have served a ritual function involved with the worship of the goddesses with upraised arms. Mug and tankard (FIG. 9.6) Seiradaki indicated that tankards were rare at Karphi, and she thought that they may have served a religious function.120 She observed that like pyxides, the vessels were allowed to harden before cut off from the stand by which it is assumed that she means the marks of cutting them off the stand were clear on the bases. She did not distinguish between mugs (FS 226), which do not have spouts, and the spouted tankards.121 When the vessel is fragmentary, it is difficult to distinguish between the two. Hallager's observation that tankards are generally larger than mugs does not necessarily hold at Karphi, where one of the preserved tankards is a miniature. Since it is impossible to distinguish the two without the spout, they are considered together, though they probably served different functions. Seiradaki distinguished three types, all in fine wares; the shape was rare in medium-coarse and coarse wares. Type 1 is a large tankard, Type 2 is a mug from Ta Mnemata 4, and Type 3 is a miniature tankard from K 17; these represent the only three nearly complete mugs or tankards from the site. Tankards of Types 1 and 2 are similar in shape, with a large base, concave profile, and wide rim; on K26.4 the rim and base diameters are approximately the same, while the miniature tankard (K17.1) has a rim larger than its base. In both cases the handle is set opposite to the spout, which is a bridge spout. On both tankards the handle rises from the rim to the base (K26.4) or mid body (K17.1). K26.4 has a rim that has been described as 'beaded;' that is, it was thickened, then cut twice so that the clay fanned out, and the resulting ridges on the rim were then cut crossways into small beads or pillow shapes. Two additional spouts from the Small Shrine (K55.2, K57.3) may be from tankards, since they resemble the shape of the tankard spout and have incisions on the end of the spout like K26.4. Mug M4.7 is similar in shape to the tankards, although the base is a bit smaller than the rim. It has a similar flat base and concave profile, and the treatment of the rim is identical to that of K26.4. The elliptical handle, however, is placed in the middle of the body of the vessel, not from the rim to body or rim to base. Other fragments identified as mugs or tankards also have beaded rims (K23.8, K28.2, K77.1, K121.7, K.17, A2.2), although some show differences. In the case of three rims (K23.8, K28.2, K.17) the flaring pointed rim has not been thickened and incisions were made inside and outside to produce a ridge that was then beaded. Base fragment K23.10 is more straight-sided than usual, but its shape is similar to mugs from the mainland.122 Body fragment K23.9 may come from a tankard or mug; it has a similar concave profile, probably from near the base. All the mugs or tankards, with the exception of K17, which is a miniature variety, have rims that measure between 17 and 21. The painted decoration of the mugs and tankards is varied. Tankard K26.4 has the most elaborate decoration, with panels of different motifs, including chequerboard, tree of solid outlined ovals with dots and hatching between each oval, two butterfly or double axe patterns stacked one on top of the other with multiple outlines, a field of zigzags under the handle, and a complex 'sail' pattern that has vertical, horizontal, and oblique elements between the sails, each surrounding a set of upright chevrons. This elaborate decoration is reminiscent of several of the large pyxides (e.g. K22.3, which also has the sail pattern); a similar example found in the Psychro cave may have come from Karphi.123 Most of the mugs and tankards are not so elaborately decorated. Three of the rim fragments have the same painted decoration on the rim (K23.8, K28.2, K.17) with a series of rather curvilinear triangles pendent from 116 Gesell, Glowacki and Klein forthcoming. 117 Kanta 1980, fig. 9.4, called a stemmed bowl. 118 Lebessi andMuhly 1990, 324-5, figs. 10-1. 119 Lebessi and Muhly 1990, 327. 120 Seiradaki, 19-20. 121 Hallager 2000, 153-4 for the distinction. 122 RMDP, 576-7, fig. 213.368-70 (Perati, LH IIIC early). 123 Watrous 1996, 41, pi. 25a-b.</page><page sequence="282">POTTERY ANALYSIS K26.4 TYPE 1 M4.7 K17.1 K23.8 TYPE 2 TYPE 3 Fig. 9.6. Mugs and tankards. Scale 1:4. the rim and filled with dots; some other curvilinear motif is below. Such a decoration is not paralleled elsewhere on Crete, but it does appear on a krater from the mainland of middle LHIIIC date.124 K23.9 has solid triangles with multiple outlines. The miniature tankard K17.1 has panels with a vertical chain pattern, very simple as befits its size. Alternating arcs decorate the lower portion of K23.10; this motif goes back to LM IIIA but is also popular in LM IIIB.125 At least three and possibly four of the mugs or tankards seem to be monochrome. Mug M4.7 also has an additional motif of large incised X's which were then beaded. The closest parallel to this decoration, which was then monochrome painted, is jug K87.1. Tankards and mugs are always monochrome painted inside. The function of tankards and mugs is uncertain, but clearly tankards were used for pouring, and their elaborate decoration suggests a uses in formal or public situations. Mugs may have been used for drinking and the large decorated examples may have served a function in elite drinking rituals similar to the oversized kylikes and cups. Kalathos (FIGS. 9.7, 9.8) There are few fine kalathoi from Karphi (FIG. 9.7), although the shape is found throughout the settlement in coarse wares. Of Seiradaki's seven types of kalathoi, only types 5 and 6 occur in fine wares: Type 5 is here identified as a conical cup (M16.1) and has been discussed above (p. 255), and Type 6 is a basket kalathos (K68.ll), of which only four definite examples were found at Karphi: the elaborately decorated vessel with an excrescent cup (K68.11), two similar examples with excrescent cup (K116.2, MK.3), and a miniature version in blue ware (K110.3). Other fine kalathoi are without handles and are closer to Type 1 in shape, a simple flaring, handleless, open shape. This type is represented by one nearly complete example from K 61 (K61.10) with a bevelled base, a slightly flaring body, and a flattened, outward thickened rim with incised lines. Several rim fragments may also be of this type, although they are larger and the sides flare more (K17.18, K67.3, K79.4). K81.3 may also come from a kalathos, but it is so poorly preserved that it is difficult to tell; it may also be the rim of an amphoroid krater. Mountjoy 1986, 174, fig. 224.3.

Basket kalathos and other fine kalathoi. Scale 1:4. There is only one example of the later type of kalathos that becomes popular in SM and PG graves on Crete: a very flaring bowl with two round horizontal handles below the rim and a very small raised foot, and it comes fromTa Mnemata (Ml.l) of SM date. A similar shape from K 26 (K26.3) has been reconstructed from many fragments that may not actually go together; the upper part may come from a deep bowl. All types of fine kalathos are painted on the interior, and they are usually monochrome. K61.10 apparently has blob decoration on the inside, although the remainder of the paint may have worn off. There is no trace of paint on the interior of K110.3. The most elaborate exterior decoration can be found on the Type 6 basket kalathos. A particularly exuberant example is K68.ll. This vessel has elaborate decoration that includes incision at the base and rim, and strokes and chevrons on the rim itself. The main zone has panelled decoration in which the entire surface is covered in pleonastic style with different motifs, including zigzags, chevrons, vertical crosshatched lozenge chains, vertical rows of butterfly or double axe pattern with multiple outlines, solid triangles with multiple outlines, and a quatrefoil surrounded with hatched and fringed motifs. The whole decorative scheme is similar to that on tankard K26.4 and pyxis K22.3. The decorations on the basket kalathoi K116.2 and MK.4 are too worn to determine, and the miniature example (K110.3) only has bands. The Type 1 fine kalathoi have much simpler decorations; K61.10 has a chevron or V pattern, K17.18 has an undetermined motif. The rims of K79.4 and K67.3 are decorated, the former with hatched triangles and chevrons, the latter with strokes. The SM kalathos (Ml.l) has a simple design of multiple triangles; the interior has a reserved disc at the bottom. The underside is not decorated, so this vessel was apparently not designed as a lid. There are not enough fine kalathoi at Karphi to determine a development during LM IIIC in shape or decoration. The basket kalathos seems to have been more popular at the end of the Karphi settlement, since most of the examples are nearly complete, and no recognisable examples come from earlier deposits or those under streets and courts. Basket kalathoi and other fine kalathoi do exist in other LM IIIC settlements, but often are represented only by small fragments.126 They range in date from early to late LM IIIC. Basket kalathoi were found in the early LM IIIC deposits at both Kavousi-Vronda and Kavousi-Zuxstro,127 but there are also examples from late LM IIIC deposits. From the settlement at Khalasmenos come two kalathoi, one from the ritual deposit in sector A,128 and there is a third from the tholos tomb at Khalasmenos.129 Two basket kalathoi were said to come from the Ayios Theodoros tomb near Vasiliki, also of LM IIIC date.130 126 Hallager 2000, 153. 127 Day and Snyder 2004, 68, fig. 5.6.9; Mook, personal communication. 128 Tsipopoulou 2004, 115, fig. 8.12.95-227, 97-114. 129 Coulson and Tsipopoulou 1994, fig. 18.1; Tsipopoulou 2004, 115-9, fig. 8.12.92-18. 130 Betancourt 1985, 181, fig. 128.</page><page sequence="284">POTTERY ANALYSIS K148.7 TYPE 1 K9.9 TYPE 2 K28.6 TYPE 3 K80.6 TYPE 7 K110.12 K2.3 K58.2 K27.5 K26.7 K110.14 K.37 K43.14 K149.21 Fig. 9.8. Coarse kalathoi. Scale 1:4.</page><page sequence="285">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION The function of the fine kalathos is uncertain; the shape appears in both domestic and funerary contexts, as at Khalasmenos. The basket kalathos with excrescent cup may have served a ritual function; perhaps some small and special offering was placed in the tiny cup. For other kalathoi, the function is less clear, but the elaborate decoration of these vessels suggests that they were used for display, possibly in elite rituals; indeed a basket kalathos was found in the early deposits in Building B at Kavousi-Frow Ja, which may represent the remains of an elite drinking ritual.131 The later type of kalathos of SM-PG is encountered most often in graves, where it may have held an offering made to the dead. The coarse kalathos (fig. 9.8) without handles is one of the most common coarse ware shapes, and certainly one of the most easily recognisable. Of the seven types of kalathoi distinguished by Seiradaki, only four are coarse handleless kalathoi (Types 1-3, 7).132 Type 4 has a handle and a lug and is more like a basin in profile; it exists only in a single example from the Temple (K1.12) and is discussed below under coarse basins. The kalathos shape is simple and has few variations, generally in the treatment of the rim and the base; it resists easy typological distinctions. The base is small (5-10.5), the sides flare out sharply, so that the rim is generally about three times the diameter of the base (15.6-26.6), although the ratio can be as low as 2:1 or as high as 3.7:1. The rim is generally twice the height (2:1-2.2:1), although it can be smaller or larger. The height is most commonly between 8 and 10, but can be as low as 7 and as high as 18. Variation comes in the rim and base treatments, and the four types illustrated incorporate all of these variations. As Seiradaki says, and as is also clear from the notebook, any rim type can occur with any base type.133 Bases can be flat (K3.10-11, K110.12-13, MK.10), but more commonly they are raised either with a simple base (K2.2, K22.7-8, K26.8, K58.2, K110.15, K.37), a bevelled base (K2.3, K26.7, K28.6), a torus moulding (K27.5, K43.14, K110.14, K148.7, K.38), or a ledge (K12.5-6, K27.4, K149.21); in two cases the base moulding has a hook on it (K9.9, K80.6). Occasionally, one or more grooves were incised on the underside (K22.8, K26.7, K110.13). Whatever the treatment, the bases are usually very heavy. Rims also show a great variety: flaring (ten examples) or flattened (15 examples). Flaring rims may have incisions decorating the interior (K22.8, K110.14, MK.10) or have a single notch (K110.12-13). Flatten ed rims may have incisions on top (K9.9, K12.6, K27.4, K43.14, K87.3), or they may have a ledge on the interior of the rim (K27.5, K58.2). Flattened rims may also be decorated with knobs on the outer edge (K28.6, K43.14) or on top (K.37), similar to types found at Kavousi- Vronda.134 Kalathoi are most often in fabrics used for cooking wares, but occasionally occur in those found in storage vessels. The most common is the phyllite fabric (groups la and lb). The surfaces are often smoothed, almost burnished, and are sometimes mottled red and black; the latter feature is not a slip or painted decoration, but may result from an unknown surface treatment, one that has been observed on cooking wares, kalathoi, and cult equipment at Kavousi-Vronda.135 Many of the kalathoi (16 out of the 29) show burning, four only on the interior, eleven on both interior and exterior, and only one on the exterior alone. Of those burned both inside and out, five are more heavily burned on the interior, two more heavily on the exterior. It would appear that kalathoi were often used in fire-related activities, and this may explain the use of cooking fabrics that were designed to withstand sudden extremes in temperature. Those kalathoi burned on the interior probably held burning material, while those burned on the exterior may have suffered accidental (set too close to the fire) or deliberate (placed in or near a fire) burning. It seems likely, then, that kalathoi were multi-functional vessels that were designed to hold burning material. They may have been used as lamps, as a few of them show patches of burning on the upper part of the interior that might have been made from a wick floating in the oil that protected the lower portion from burning. They may also have contained charcoal and have been used as scuttles or braziers; in fact, in shape kalathoi resemble scuttles, but without the handle. It is also possible that the kalathoi were used in cooking. Those kalathoi that were unburned may have been used as ordinary containers, or as offering vessels. A kalathos from K 102 contained olive pits, for example, possibly indicating a household function.136 At any rate, kalathoi were frequent in nearly every context at Karphi. Seiradaki suggested that kalathoi, while they were used for household purposes, were in favour for religious offerings,137 and there is some evidence to support a ritual function. Large numbers occurred in five rooms that were in or adjacent to possible ritual areas: seven in K 27 with the two rhyta and eight next door in K 26; seven in K 80 of the Priest's House, which was associated with K 58 with its stands and eight kalathoi. On the other hand, according to the notebook the largest deposit of kalathoi (10) came from K 3, which had no religious association, and K 114 produced six kalathoi in a domestic context, although it was across the street from a possible shrine (K 116).

Scuttles. Scale 1:4. kalathos from Mikre Koprana (K149.21), with its small figure of a goddess with upraised arms, clearly had a religious connection; it showed no signs of burning. Nearly all cult rooms had kalathoi, but no more than were found in ordinary domestic contexts. The Temple produced only a fragment of a kalathos rim with a horned projection, along with its large assortment of goddesses, plaques, and snake tubes. One of the Temple Dependencies (K 38) produced a fragment of a goddess figurine and a kalathos, but these fragments may belong to an earlier deposit underneath or have fallen down from the ritual area above. The Great House Shrine, which also included goddess figures and a snake tube, produced a kalathos. The Small Shrine had a kalathos in one of the rooms, but not the one in which the altar was found. K 116 was also a shrine, with goddess figures and at least four kalathoi. K 85-87 had animal and human figurines, along with several kalathoi, and K 106 also had figurines and a kalathos. Certainly there was no religious area with large numbers of kalathoi, as was the case at Kavousi-Frcwt/a, and kalathoi may have been in the religious rooms for domestic as well as ritual reasons. Kalathoi seem to show the same multitude of functions at other sites as well. Kavousi-Vronda produced a kalathos in nearly every house, in addition to the large number in the shrine, and kalathoi occured in both ordinary domestic deposits and in the shrine at Khalasmenos.138 In other LM IIIC shrines kalathoi served as bowls for burnt or unburned offerings and were placed on top of snake tubes in shrines of the goddess with upraised arms.139 No coarse kalathoi were found associated with any of the tombs. Scuttle (FIG. 9.9) Related to the kalathos is the scuttle, which has a bowl of similar shape, with a handle added. The bases are generally small but thick, as on kalathoi, and the sides flare outward sharply. The single large round or elliptical handle has been pushed into the body at the rim, creating an irregular rim diameter. Scuttles are most often recognised from the distinctive handles; rims and bases can be mistaken for kalathoi, unless enough is preserved to show the irregularity that comes from the attachment of the handle. Seiradaki called vessels of this shape 'lamps',140 and only distinguished a single type. They were found in many buildings, but never more than one example was found in a room. Only nine scuttles are preserved all in coarse fabrics. Seven of these were simply handles (K2-7.1, K17.33, K27.6, K44.8, K57.5, K58.3, K106.22), but two also preserved part of the rim (K115.13) or body (K75.13). 138 Day et al. forthcoming; Tsipopoulou 2004, 115. 139 Gesell, Coulson and Day 1991, 162; Gesell 1999. 140 Seiradaki, 12, fig. 8.</page><page sequence="287">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION The most complete example, K75.13, had a small, thick, flat base and a flaring body with a straight rim that had a small ledge around the interior; the rim outline was heart-shaped. K115.13 had a simpler rim, without the inner ledge, but with incisions on the interior near the rim; other rim and handle fragments also had incisions on the interior of the rim (K2-7.1, K57.5). One rim was rounded and outward-thickened (K27.6). Handles were round (K17.33, K44.8, K58.3) or elliptical (K2-7.1, K27.6, K57.5, K106.22, K115.13). They always curved sometimes in a single C-curve to rest on the end of the tip (K57.5, K58.3), more often in a double S-curve, which could be more (K44.8) or less (K27.6, K106.22) curved. Often the end of the handle has a dint (K17.33, K27.6, K58.3, K106.22). One example (K106.22) also had four knobs or projections on top of the handle. Other scuttle handles found but not catalogued include one with a crude bird's head at the end from the Temple (K 1) and one with spiral fluting found in K 23.141 There has been a great deal of discussion of the name and function of these vessels. Evans first called the larger examples of the shape incense burners,142 but other types of vessels are more demonstrably used for burning aromatics, and this term has been abandoned for the shape. Seiradaki thought they were lamps because of the burning marks. None of the preserved examples, however, showed any traces of burning, although most were only handle fragments, which would not show burning. Of the two that were better preserved, however, one (K115.13) was not burned, and the other (K75.13) was totally discoloured from fire, possibly in the kiln itself; none of the burning marks suggests that these objects functioned as lamps, and there was no patch of burning near the rim or top where the wick might have rested as in some of the kalathoi. The shape is also called a brazier, but Georgiou accepted the term scuttle as the most precise, and this is the one used here.143 The name suggests that they may have been used for transporting hot charcoal. All of the examples were made out of cooking fabrics, suggesting that they were fashioned with use in fire in mind. Many of the scuttles were found in contexts that also included ritual equipment. Nearly every shrine of the goddess with upraised hands included a scuttle: one came from the Temple, one from the lower level in K 17 that may have included ritual equipment, and one from K 116. Others were found associated with different kinds of ritual equipment: two scuttles accompanied the rhyta from K 27, one scuttle came from the Small Shrine (K 57), one from K 58 was accompanied by two cylindrical stands, those from K 85 and K 106 were found with animal figurines, and one came from K 79, where there was also some ritual material, possibly associated with K 116. The scuttle mentioned from K 147 may have been used in connection with the kalathos with a goddess figurine in it found next door in K 149, since the two rooms were connected by a door. Others have more dubious connections with religious activities: one came from K 19, which may have formed part of the Temple Dependencies, and one came from K 80 in the Priest's House, but without associated ritual equipment. Those from K 2-7, K 23, K 44, K 77, K 125, and K 133 have no known connection with ritual. Scuttles have been found in the shrine of the goddess with upraised arms at Kavousi-Froflt/a, so the shape seems regularly to be connected with religious observances.144 That scuttles also served a more ordinary function can be seen from their appearance in domestic settings, such as K 23, K 77, K125,K 133, and even K 44, which may have had a public function. In the climate on the high peak of Karphi they may have been needed as portable sources of heat in the colder months. Krater (FIG. 9.10) The decorated krater is, after the deep bowl, the most common open shape at Karphi. Seiradaki mentioned that there were regularly 1-3 sherds from kraters in each room, and that there were quite a few restorable examples, indicating the popularity of the shape toward the close of the LMIIIC period.145 She also mentioned that many krater fragments were found in earlier rubbish dumps, so the shape was clearly popular throughout the history of the settlement. Seiradaki identified ten types of kraters at Karphi. Type 1 is similar to the rounded deep bowl (Type 1) in shape, and Seiradaki indicated that this and Type 3 were the most common;146 the illustrated example came from one of the Ta Mnemata tombs (M 4), but it could not be located. The low ring base is unusual for the krater, although the rest of the profile finds parallels in the settlement material. Type 2 was represented in the settlement, although the example illustrated is from Ta Mnemata (M8.2). It has a high foot and an S-shaped curve to the profile that is not often found on kraters from the settlement. Type 3 was also not located; its very high almost cylindrical foot is most unusual. The handles were placed higher on the body, but otherwise it is not so different from Type 2 in profile. The decoration, seen in the published photograph, seems to consist of rows of double upright loops with horizontal strokes between them.147 A similar repetitive pattern of loops covering the entire surface of the pot 141 Other scuttles (called lamps) were mentioned in the notebook from K 19, K 27, K 77, K 79, K 80, K 116 (pictured in Seiradaki, fig. 8.1), K 125, and K 133; two 'trefoil lamps' were recorded in K 85 and K 147. 142 Evans 1928, 135. 143 Georgiou 1986, 28. 144 Gesell, Glowacki and Klein forthcoming. 145 Seiradaki, 22. 146 Seiradaki, 22. 147 Seiradaki, pi. 11c.</page><page sequence="288">POTTERY ANALYSIS MK.13 TYPE 1 M8.2 TYPE 2 .v.* .V.'.V AV.V .V.'.V .'.V.V .'.V .V.'.V .'.V.V .'.V.V .'.V .'.V.V .V.'.V .V.'.V .V.'.V .V.'.V .V.'.V .V.V.' .V.'.V .V.'.V K26.5 TYPE 3 K23.11 TYPE 4 K131.4 K122.3 TYPE 10 Fig. 9.10.

The tall offset rim finds no parallels in the rest of the Karphi material, although it is similar to one of the large cups (K81.1), and the triple handles are also unique; the base is restored. Types 5-9 were distinguished by their bases, which were the only parts preserved. Type 5 is represented only by a single coarse example, discussed above as a coarse goblet or chalice. Type 6 is a coarse stemmed goblet from K 16 that is probably of Hellenistic date. Type 7 seems to be the base of a champagne cup or goblet, but it was not located; it is similar to the champagne cup base (K76.39) discussed above, with its shallow circular depression in the centre. Type 8 is probably what has been identified as a small bowl or saucer (K33.3); what Seiradaki took to be a broken edge seems to be finished, and the whole vessel should be turned upside down. Type 9 was not located, nor have any similar bases been preserved in the boxes. Finally, Type 10 is represented only by a single example from K 131 (K131.4); it is like Type 3 except that it has double handles and is of extraordinary size; the base is not preserved, but has been restored. The preserved examples of the kraters seem to fall into three major types: Types 1, 2, and 3; Types 4 and 10 are represented only by single examples. Type 1 is a deep rounded form usually with a low foot, but sometimes with a pedestal base; the body rises straight up to a rim that is vertical or only very slightly flaring. Into this category fall K132.2 and MK.13 and perhaps K62.1. Type 2, with its S-shaped profile, is represented by M8.2, K49.1, K79.2, K82.5 and possibly K79.3. Type 3 kraters have deeper rounded bodies and a nearly vertical rim; since none of the bases are preserved, it is difficult to know if they have the type of base pictured in Seiradaki. To this type belongs K26.5 and the more fragmentary K31.8, K43.10, K79-89.18, K124.6; a similar shape from Knossos is LM IIIC in date.149 Type 4 (K23.il) is not common either at Karphi or on Crete in general; the closest parallel for its shape appears in Kephallonia,150 and this vessel may have followed an outside influence or have been an import. K122.3 represents a different type, with a very deep body and a nearly vertical rim. Finally, there are a number of vessels whose rims seem to turn in; that is, the rim is not the widest part of the vessel, but is narrower than the widest diameter. Included in this type are the following: K67.2, K79-89.21 and K124.5; such kraters are also found in LM IIIC Khania.151 Few krater bases are preserved, although many have been restored. From the settlement, only the bases of MK.13, K75.7, K76.45, and K132.2 are preserved, although apparently the foot of the missing Type 3 krater from K 30 was also preserved. All of these are pedestal bases of varying heights. From the tombs, only one base was found, on M8.2, and it is similar to K75.7. None of the bases has the holes pierced through them that are found on examples from Kavousi-Fro«c/a.152 Rim diameters vary from 20 to 55.5, but most of them fall into two groups of either 20-30 or 30-40, the larger slightly more common (20 examples) than the smaller (18 examples). Only three rims fall into the 40-50 category (K79-89.19, K124.5, MK.13), and only a single example (K131.4) is larger than 50. The rims themselves show great variety; some kraters are lipless and have pointed rims, like their counterparts on deep bowls, while others have lips that are rolled or flattened on top, usually with a pronounced thickening on the outward edge. Often, but not always, it is the larger kraters that have the rolled or outward thickened rims; the smaller kraters (those with a diameter of less than 30) are more often lipless. The kraters are always monochrome painted on the interior. There are no examples of a reserved disc on the interior, and only a single example of a reserved band at the rim (K124.6). Many of the rims that are flattened on top and/or thickened have reserved bands on top and are decorated with strokes (K31.9, K32.13, K52.5, K68.8-9, K76.42-44, K79-89.19, K79-89.21, K79-89.23, K91.4, K124.5, K148.4, MK.13, K.19), or occasionally a wavy line (K147.13). Kraters regularly have more elaborate decoration than any other shape except the pyxis. While there are a few examples of the simple open style, the majority of kraters are elaborately decorated in the pleonastic style. Seiradaki published two figures depicting krater patterns;153 neither the i llustrated bird nor the 'tree' motif could be found.154 Similarly, the large krater fragment with scroll pattern from K 28 was not located.155 Several of the illustrations are from shapes other than kraters, including deep bowl, kylix, and stirrup jars.156 Few kraters were decorated in the simple style. K23.ll has two rows of crosshatched triangles and nothing else. This use of very linear style with repetitive motifs can be seen as an indication of very late date, possibly SM, but it also may show that the vessel on which it appears was manufactured elsewhere, perhaps not even on Crete. K49.1 bears simple running spirals, similar to those found on deep bowls. K45.4 and K124.7 also have running spirals. K26.5 is more complex, with two rows of running spirals connected by double tan 148 Gesell, Day and Coulson 1995,90, fig. 7.2; Day and Glowacki forthcoming. 149 Popham 1965, 332, fig. 9.62. 150 RMDP, 462, fig. 167.73. 151 Khania II, pi. 41.70-P 0155, 84-P0304. 152 Day et al. forthcoming. 153 Seiradaki, figs. 25-6. 154 Seiradaki, fig. 25d. 155 Seiradaki, fig. 26a. 156 Seiradaki, fig. 25c, e (deep bowl); Seiradaki, fig. 26d (kylix); Seiradaki, fig. 26c, e (stirrup jars).</page><page sequence="290">POTTERY ANALYSIS gents and small quatrefoils filling the field among them. The designs on the other krater fragments are pleonastic, combining several motifs, with fillers and fringes. The most elaborately decorated krater, as well as the largest, is K131.5. This krater is surely of local inspiration. It is unfortunate that its surfaces are so poorly preserved that the motifs are difficult to identify. One side has two animals, certainly fantastic creatures, on either side of a central motif that may be horns of consecration, with a tree of hatched leaves growing out of the centre, between the horns. The figures have claw-like feet, perhaps of lions, but their bodies look more like those of horses; the right-hand figure in particular has the kind of knobby knees associated with horses. This figure is clearly male, but the one on the left is too poorly preserved to identify its sex. The right hand figure also has a long fringed tail that appears equine. The bodies of both animals are outlined with dots. Unfortunately, the heads of both animals are poorly preserved; the right-hand creature seems to have a beak, or else the mouth is represented as open. Either the two animals wear elaborate headdresses, or their mouths or beaks are open, with curving fringed fronds growing out of them. The left-hand figure seems to have a tree with oval leaves growing out of its back. It is possible that these are griffins or some other composite animal; they resemble the griffins on the vessel from LH IIIC Lefkandi, with their dotted outlines, claw feet, and headdresses.157 The other side is also panelled but the motifs could not be determined. Clearly, nearly all of the available space was filled with fringes, arcs, and small ornaments. Other kraters also show figured decoration, but they are less elaborate. In addition to the large fragment from K 76 published by Seiradaki and not located,158 there were at least five kraters depicting birds (K62.1, KR K79-89.18, K149.14-15, K.20). Often these birds are arranged in panels with other motifs. The birds usually have fringed wings, and often have a dotted outline. Other creatures are represented; one krater fragment (K107.4) depicts the tentacle of an octopus. Several kraters bear floral motifs, including tree (K75.7, K52.6), palm (K149.14), and Minoan flower (K86.1, K101.7, K107.3; possibly K76.42). M8.2 has lilies, arranged on either side of a panelled pattern. Other floral motifs are arranged in patterns over the surface of the pot (K97.5, K47.1, K121.8, K124.8). One fragment (K75.8) portrays a realistic double axe between horns of consecration. Most of the kraters have non-figured panelled patterns. MK.13 has a combination of spirals, ovals with alternating strokes, and fringed, outlined curvilinear motifs. K148.5 has a combination of scale pattern, chequerboard, and S-pattern, similar to that found on pyxis K110.5. K82.5 is decorated with concentric semicircles with solid centres and hatching between some of the circles. K124.6 has a panel with a multiple-outlined quatrefoil, and a scalloped curvilinear outlined pattern. Other motifs on fragments include: spirals (K23.12, K23.15, K23.64-65, K32.15, K45.5, K79-89.19, K91.4, K147.12); medallions with rosettes (K67.2), dotted filled ovals (K43.10), and other fillers (K79-89.22); stacked chevrons (K79-89.21); multiple stems (K79.3); dotted zigzag (K23.13); crossmatched (K52.5, K103.3) or outlined (K76.43) lozenges; scale pattern (K96.1, K148.5); outlined curvilinear patterns (K32.13, K54.4-5, K76.42, K85.4, K122.3, K130.1, K148.4), filled loops (K31.8) and wavy borders (K32.14). Other krater fragments are too small to determine the overall patterns, but most are decorated with curvilinear motifs, and many have arcs filling spaces, U-motif, fringes, dots, and scalloped edges. One small krater (K132.2) is monochrome. There is no discernable development in the shapes or decorations on the kraters. Krater fragments with elaborate decorative schemes appear in the lower levels of K 12, K 17, and K 23, and in the streets and courts, particularly K 32, K 76, and K 79-89. Whole kraters were found on the floors and represent vessels in use at the end of the settlement's history, and at least one appears in a tomb (M8.2). Except for the example from K 23, which may be an import, these late examples look little different from the fragments found throughout. Kraters are always elaborately decorated and usually made in fine fabrics. Whatever their function, whether as mixing vessels for water and wine as in later Greek culture or something else, they were meant for social display rather than to serve as simple utilitarian vessels. It is not unreasonable to see the kraters as part of the drinking or feasting rituals that may have formed a maj or element in the social fabric of the Karphi settlement. Other open shapes Large spouted (?)bowl (FIG. 9.11) There are two very similar examples of a large deep bowl decorated with bands and wavy band(s) and possibly spouted (K115.6, K.18). This is a shape for which there are no parallels on Crete. It has a tall offset rim and deep rounded body, and it is decorated with a wavy line on the rim and either bands or a wavy line and bands on the body; the interior is also banded. A similar shape, popular in the islands in early LM IIIC was the large spouted cup (FS 249), which appears on examples from Lefkandi, Naxos, Paros, Melos, and Rhodes.159 The Karphi examples may be variations on that shape and may show some contact with the islands. 157 Mountjoy 2007, 234, fig. 6. 158 Seiradaki, fig. 25a. 159 RMDP, 712-3, fig. 273.63 (Lefkandi, LHIIIC early); 918, fig. 373.144 (Melos, LHIIIC early); 935-6, fig. 381.4 (Paros,LH IIIC early to middle); 958-9, fig. 391.64 (Naxos, LH IIIC mi ddle); 1060-1, fig. 434.230 (Rhodes, LH IIIC early to middle).</page><page sequence="291">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION K115.6 K85.12 (1:8) Fig. 9.11. Bowls and basins. Scale 1:4, unless otherwise indicated. Large carinated bowl (FIG. 9.11) There is a single example of a large carinated bowl from K 143 (K143.2). Decorated with crosshatched lozenge chain, it also has an incised X-pattern below and incisions on the interior, along with bands. Its closest parallel is an unpublished fragment from Kavousi-From/a, which may come either from a LM IIIC context or have been discarded from a later Geometric tomb. Tray (FIG. 9.11) There are two examples of the fine tray, Seiradaki's Type 8 dish. This is FS 322, a shape which first appeared on the mainland in middle LH IIIC, but which by late LH IIIC was generally decorated with bands or monochrome paint.160 The mainland and island examples seem to have more flaring sides and often have double or even triple handles, and they are elaborately decorated. The two examples from Karphi are both monochrome painted, and both have basket handles, but only single ones. K132.3 is shallow (2.7), with a bevelled flat base and flat rim, similar in shape to coarse cooking trays, but with a handle. K43.12 is deeper (4.9), similar in shape to a tray from Rhodes of early to middle LH IIIC.161 Both trays have large diameters (20-28), and they would make excellent shallow serving dishes. Published examples of fine trays with basket handles from other sites have not been found. Coarse trays not used in cooking are rare. K85.12 is a unique shape that is either a very shallow basin or a tall tray, but it seems to fit more into the category of tray. It has a wide, bevelled base, a body that spreads to a flaring rim, and a horizontal handle below the rim; the handles display dints at either end. Basin (FIG. 9.12) Seiradaki defined a basin as any open vessel, except kalathoi, whose height is between one-third and two thirds of its rim diameter.162 She distinguished 11 different types of basins in her publication, including fine, medium-coarse, and coarse wares.163 She men tioned that sherds from basins were found in most rooms, although they were not as common as pithoi, pithoid jars, j ars, and tripods. The shape occurs more often in coarse or medium-coarse wares than in fine wares. Fine basins are open shapes with very wide diameters, ranging from 13 to 28. Most of the preserved fine examples are of Seiradaki's Types 6 and 7. Fine basins are probably quite deep, although no whole complete profile has been preserved, but they appear 160 Mountjoy 1986, 155, 193. 161 RMDP, 1065-6, fig. 436.252. 162 Seiradaki, 9. 163 Seiradaki, 8-9, fig. 5.</page><page sequence="292">POTTERY ANALYSIS K2.4 TYPE 2 K31.10 TYPE 6 !^&gt;t—J K79-89.17 TYPE 7 K1.11 TYPE 3 K26.9 TYPE 8 K44.7 TYPE 9 K147.18 (1:8) TYPE 4 K150.4 K1.12 Fig. 9.12.

They are characterised by a ridge below the rim, and a flat horizontal handle is attached at the ridge. The rims are flattened on top and thickened outward. The decoration of fine basins is quite simple. Two examples have strokes on top of the rim (K54.3, K.22), while one possible basin (K106.20) has a zigzag motif. The exteriors have bands (K54.3, K79-89.17, K101.9) or the deep wavy bands that may represent a debased octopus decoration (K9.6, K31.10). One possible basin (K106.20) has a more elaborate decoration of multiple stems, but the precise motif is not certain. The interiors of fine basins have either a single band at the rim (K9.6, K31.10, K106.20, K.22) or multiple bands (K54.3, K79-89.17); only one example has a monochrome interior (K101.9). Only one possible basin came from the tombs. A rim fragment found outside Ta Mnemata 8 (M8.10) is of similar shape, but lacks the ridge below the flattened, outward thickened rim; it has banded decoration on the interior and monochrome on the exterior. It is smaller than most fine basins (rim diameter is c. 16), and it may not be a basin, but a shallow bowl. Fine basins are rare in LM IIIC deposits elsewhere, although the coarse and medium-coarse varieties are common. A few examples have been found at Kavousi Vronda.164 Only one true basin appears in medium-coarse fabric (K150.4), and it is published as Seiradaki's Type 11. It has a flat base, slightly concave underneath, and nearly vertical sides rising to the usual flattened and outward thickened rim, with a ridge below it. Two elliptical horizontal handles are attached at the ridge and below. The shape is similar to the basins in fine wares, although perhaps deeper and not as rounded. Like the fine ware examples, it is decorated with bands inside and out, with a large spiral on the bottom of the interior. Coarse basins are difficult to distinguish from pithoid jars, particularly when only the rim is preserved, as they often have similar profiles; basins, however, are shallower than pithoid jars and generally have horizontal rather than vertical handles. Basins vary a great deal in size, and doubtless also in function. They were part of the kitchen equipment, as they frequently show burning, and they may also have been used in the preparation of food or for other household activities, such as washing. The coarse lekane or basin usually has a flat base, a ridge below a flattened and outward-thickened rim, and a horizontal handle at the ridge and below. The profiles vary a great deal. Types 1 and 3-6 were said to be frequent, and Type 3 was more common than 8 11. Type 1 has straight sides to the ridge, and the handle is unusually set below the ridge; unfortunately, no vessels of this type were located. Type 2 is most unusual, with two carinations, as if the vessel was made in two sections and the pieces joined; only a single example was found (K2.4). Type 3 has more flaring sides, and the handle is between the ridge and the rim; several examples exist (Kl.ll, K48.7), and it is a type found frequently on LMIIIC sites.165 Type 4 (K147.18) is close to being a pithoid jar, as it is just under the limit for a basin; it is similar to examples from Kavousi- Vronda, Kastri, Knossos, and Khamalevri.166 Types 5-7 are only represented by rim fragments and differ in the depth, angle, and decoration of the rim; Type 5 has incisions decorating the rim, while Types 6 and 7 are primarily found in fine wares. Types 8 (K26.9) and 9 (K44.7) have much thicker walls, a flattened rim that is not thickened outward, and a small ridge at the handle attachment; Type 9 seems to have a more curving profile. Type 10 was not located, but seems to have more of an S-curve. Type 11 only occurs in medium-coarse wares (see above). To these types might be added K1.12 from the Temple, which Seiradaki categorised as a kalathos of Type 4, but which fits more comfortably into the category of basin; it has a two-pronged lug (imitating horns?) as well as a round horizontal handle, but it lacks the ridge found on most of the basins. It also perhaps has some paint on the rim. Coarse basins are rarely decorated, but occasionally have incised decoration on the rim (Type 5), a chain of finger impressions around the base (K147.18), or the same sort of dint or thumbprints on the handles found on pithoi and pithoid jars (K147.18). Deep basin or bowl (FIG. 9.13) Another shape found at Karphi but not in any of Seiradaki's charts is a deep and rounded bowl or basin (K47.3, K85.10, K121.12, K.40). This shape has the rounded profile of the krater, but lacks the pedestal base generally found on kraters. In two cases (K47.3, K.40) the ratio of height to rim diameter does not fall within Seiradaki's parameters for basins; they are too deep, but not by much. I have called this shape the deep basin or bowl, rather than creating a new type of basin to add to Seiradaki's eleven types; the profiles seem too different. I have also avoided calling them coarse kraters, since that term implies a certain function that is perhaps erroneous; they are clearly for domestic use, and were not decorated as display items. One was in medium-coarse ware, the others in coarse wares. 164 Day et al. forthcoming. 165 Tsipopoulou2004,117, fig. 8.10.97-5 (Khalasmenos); Kastri, 295, fig. 15.P34; Day et al. forthcoming (Kavousi-Vronda). 166 Gesell, Day and Coulson 1995, pi. 18d (Kavousi-Vronda); Kastri, 296, fig. 16.PI 1; Warren 1982-83, 84, fig. 56 — this example, however, is scored on the interior: see the drawing in Warren 2007, 341, fig. 6.P2468 (Knossos); Andreadaki Vlasaki and Papadopoulou 2005, 37, fig. 39 (Khamalevri); Andreadaki-Vlasaki and Papadopoulou 2007, 51, fig. 8.33 (Khamalevri, Phase II).</page><page sequence="294">POTTERY ANALYSIS Fig. 9.13.

All examples have deep rounded bodies, and two (K47.3, K.40) have flattened outward thickened rims with ridges below, like the basins; K121.12 has a rounded rim and no ridge. All have round horizontal handles set below the ridge or rim. K47.3 has a creamy buff slip and is painted with bands on the interior and exterior. The vessels of this shape may have been used for some of the same purposes as the basins. Lid (FIG. 9.14) Seiradaki distinguished seven types of lids. Type 1 is a cooking lid (K47.4). Type 2 (K2.8) is found only in coarse ware; K116.8 is similar in shape to Type 2, but has a knob in place of the basket handle, more like the cooking lids. Type 3 (K1.12) is a domed lid with a basket handle that also occurs in fine fabrics (e.g. K110.7). Types 4 and 5 are like cups with handles inside the bowl, but neither of the lids illustrated in the typological chart were found; there were, however, several similar examples with interior knobs (K23.27, K29.13, K41.2, K143.3). Type 6 is another cooking lid (K22.9). Type 7 is the lid illustrated with the pyxis from K 114 (K114.5), and there are two other examples (K28.3, K76.53); this type is shallow, with straight sides, sometimes curving inward, and a wide, flat bottom. A new type, not in the typology is represented by a miniature lid in blue ware from MK IE (MK.12). It resembles an upside-down conical cup with a carination and a slightly knobbed top. Fine lids were often used to cover pyxides (K110.7, K114.5), but they are few in number in comparison with the large quantity of pyxides found on the site. The small lids (K29.13, K41.2, K143.3, MK.12) would have served as covers for vessels with smaller mouths, perhaps jugs. Lid K114.5 is the most elaborately decorated, with alternating bands and dots on the sides and concentric circles with solid ovals set obliquely in</page><page sequence="295">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINA TION K47.4 TYPE 1 K22.9 TYPE 6 MK.12 K110.7 K2.8 TYPE 2 K1.12 TYPE 3 K116.8 K23.27 TYPE 5 1 K110.19 K29.14 K113.4 I K45.8 K56.5 K114.5 7 Fig. 9.14.

Other lids are less elaborately decorated, with bands (K28.3, K110.7), or mono chrome paint (K41.2, K76.53). Lids K29.13 and MK.12 were probably undecorated. Lid K143.3 is decorated with incised lines around the body The coarse lids are all small (9-11.5), made of cooking fabrics, but without evidence of burning. These lids would have been used to cover small-mouthed vessels, like jars or jugs. The cup-like lid with the knob in the centre of the interior would be very practical to place over the mouth of a water jug to prevent any foreign objects from getting in. A subcategory of lid is the stopper, which is made from a piece of pottery that has been cut into a disc to fit into the mouth of a vessel. Three stoppers were found in the preserved material from Karphi (K56.5, K75.12, K76.56). These are 5.5-6.5 in diameter, and all three have been cut down from other vessels by chipping them around the edges to form a circular disc. K75.12 is of blue ware, but the other two are of ordinary phyllite coarse wares. K56.5 was cut down from a cooking dish, and the profile can still be seen; the other two are from body sherds. Such stoppers have also been found in other LMIIIC sites, including Kavousi- Vronda.167 They must have been used for covering or sealing small vessels like jugs or amphoras, and would not have been appropriate for pyxides, jars, or cooking vessels; they would have been created by the householder, not manufactured by a potter. The majority of lids found on the site, however, were made out of coarse cooking fabrics, many of which show signs of burning; these are designated as cooking lids. They are Seiradaki's Types 1 and 6, flat discs with central knobs. Type 1 lids regularly have applied bands decorated with finger impressions and incisions, while Type 6 lids are without decoration and are a bit thinner (K22.9, possibly K38.8). Cooking lids are large, with diameters ranging from 19-27. The knob handles are generally concave, but one example (K110.19) has a handle with a conical knob on the top. The bottoms of these lids are usually flat and rough, as though formed on the ground or on fabric; the tops are often smoothed and sometimes almost burnished. Occasionally a lid has a projecting ledge on the bottom making it concave (K38.9, K.42); two examples (K45.8, K125.2) have a groove around the edge of the underside. The edges are generally straight and vertical, but can be concave (K110.19, K113.4), rounded (K29.15, K45.8, K125.2, K.42), grooved (K29.14, K39.6) or bevelled (K22.10). A raised ridge regularly appears on top at the edge of the rim. The tops are decorated with a variety of concentric ridges with elaborate patterns and incisions, including plain ridges (K39.6, K124.9), incised concentric circles (K22.10, K83.3, K113.4), incised concentric circles with strokes on the rim (K19.4, K38.9, K46.7), and ridges with strokes (K.43), incised chevrons (K29.14, K.42), and oblique slashes (K70.3); these lids are, however, most commonly decorated with ridges that bear finger impressions: one row (K29.15), two rows alternating with grooves (K44.9, K110.19, K.41), two rows alternating with ridges (K80.7), four rows (K47.4), or even six rows (K125.2). Besides these two types of cooking lids, a third variety exists in at least one, possibly two examples: a flat disc lid with a round or elliptical basket handle (K45.8). This type has a flat base, a groove around the outer edge of the underside, and an undecorated ridge on top near the rim. K2.8, Seiradaki's Type 2 lid, may have been a cooking lid that once was larger but was broken or deliberately cut down. Ten examples of the preserved cooking lids are unburned (K9.10, K22.9-10, K44.9, K46.7, K70.3, K125.2, K.41-43), while the remainder show a variety of burning patterns (PLATE 12 /). Six (K29.14-15, K38.9, K39.6, K83.3, K124.9) have a burned band around the outside edge of the underside, two (K31.15, K45.8) are burned everywhere on the bottom except for a band around the outside edge, three (K80.7, K113.4, K19.4) are entirely burned on the bottom, one (K110.19) is burned on one side of the bottom, and one (K47.4) was burned on the top and one side. Those without burning were probably not used in the cooking process, although they may have been placed on a cooking pot after it had been removed from the fire. The others were certainly used during cooking. Those with burned edges were probably larger than the mouths of the vessels they covered. Those which were totally burned may have been set directly into the fire, perhaps as dampers or like a modern pizza pan.168 The examples that were burned everywhere except for an edge around the exterior are more difficult to explain. An experimental traditional oven built at Kavousi produced a cooking installation with a hole in top on which a pot might be placed, or it could be sealed off with a lid, and that might result in this pattern of burning.169 Others were simply selectively burned. Disc-shaped cooking lids first appeared in Crete in LM IIIC, and they are found in nearly every LM IIIC site.170 Those from Khania and Khamalevri are of similar size, shape, and decoration to the Karphi examples.171 Strainer (FIG. 9.1) There is one fragment of a strainer that is probably a lid but may be a bowl (K44.5). This seems to be an open shape, painted on the interior, with a flat rim painted black and a reserve band just below the rim. It may have been part of another vessel or placed over the spout of a jug, or used as a strainer over another vessel. 167 Day et al. forthcoming. 168 Hallager 2000, 163. 169 Day, Glowacki and Klein, 2001, 122. 170 Hallager 2000, 163. 171 Khania II, pi. 55.77-P 1635; Andreadaki-Vlasaki 2005, 278, fig. 43 Khamalevri, Phase II.</page><page sequence="297">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION Pyxis (fig. 9.15) Pyxides were common at Karphi, although not as ubiquitous as deep bowls and kraters, and they occurred primarily in fine fabrics; a few were medium-coarse. Seiradaki distinguished seven types.172 Of these, Type 7 might more accurately be called a straight-sided alabastron, and there are only two known examples: the coarse vessel depicted in the publication (K80.8) and a fine example, of which only the base is preserved, from K 75 (K75.10). The remaining types fall into two basic categories: a cylindrical vessel with sharp incurve at the top and a low collar (Types 1-3, Type 6) and a wide-mouthed cylindrical vessel with basket handles and a ledge around the interior of the rim (Types 4 and 5). Within the first group, the types seem to be determined on the basis of the position of the handles. Type 1 has handles rising on the shoulder, the handles of Type 2 rise from the middle of the sides and to the level of the rim, and Types 3 and 6 have handles that begin at the base and rise high above the rim, those of Type 3 more vertical, those ofType 6 more flared. Types 3 and 6 also have wider mouths. Within the category of wide-mouthed cylindrical pyxides, Type 4 has twisted rope handles and may be rather taller than Type 5, which has plain handles and is shallow. Pyxides of Type 2 are the most common. The bases of pyxides are generally rough, as though cut from the wheel when slightly hardened and not smoothed off. They are generally flat or slightly concave on the bottom. Occasionally the bases have a groove around the underside, near the outer edge (K14.1, K22.3, K61.12, K116.2, K134.1), Bases can be plain (K8.1, K9.7, K22.2-3, K22.6, K79.5, K110.5, K110.ll, K116.1, K147.16, K150.2, K.24), bevelled (K2.1, K3.5, K43.13, K76.49, K85.5-6, K114.3, K116.2, K137.1, MK.9), or made with a projecting ledge (K22.4, K68.12, K75.9, K79-89.24, K110.4, K113.1, K114.4, K115.7, M4.3). The bodies of pyxides can be shallow or deep, and they are generally cylindrical until the carination. There is a good deal of variation in the shoulder and rim treatments; the most common shape has a gentle carination with sloping shoulders that rise to a vertical rim. Occasionally (K22.4, K61.12, K85.5, K110.5, K110.ll, K113.1, K137.1, K150.2) the carination is a sharper and the shoulder almost concave. Types 3 and 6 have more rounded shoulders with a sharply offset collar. Handles vary both in placement and in type. Most common is the round handle that begins at the middle or toward the bottom of the body and rises above the rim (Type 2). Occasionally the handle begins at the base (Types 3 and 6). The handles are generally round, but sometimes they are slashed and fan open, creating a triple handle (K110.5, K114.3, K115.7), and they can also be double (K2.1). On the cylindrical basket-handled pyxides (Types 4-5), the preserved handles are rope-twisted (K43.13), and they are set directly on the flattened rim. A ledge is set on the interior of the rim where a lid presumably rested. This shape is close to the basket kalathos, but the sides flare less. Pyxides should be thought of as closed shapes, and the interior is rarely painted; a few examples have splatters on the interior (K8.1, K134.1). The exteriors are nearly always decorated in pleonastic style, and along with tankards and kraters bear the most elaborate decoration; medium-coarse examples are painted on top of a creamy yellow slip. The main decorative zone lies on the cylindrical sides of the vessel from base to carination, with a secondary zone on the shoulder. Seiradaki states that the decoration nearly always includes horns of consecration or double axes, but this does not seem to be the case on the preserved examples.173 Panelled decoration is most common, and only K85.6 has a different scheme, with its rows of running spirals. Motifs on pyxides include the following: double axe (K79-89.24, K114.4, K115.7), horns of consecration (K14.1, K114.4), spirals (K114.3, K115.7, K134.1), windmills (K22.3), hatched or crosshatched lozenges or lozenge and loop (K37.2, K75.9, K147.16, K.23), quatrefoil (K22.2, K22.6), half medallions or wavy border (K22.3, K68.12, K110.5, K116.1, K134.1), chevron panel (K14.1, K22.3, K22.6, K110.4, K114.3, K116.1), hatched or crosshatched triangles (K8.1, K110.4), bird (K68.12, K114.4, K115.7), dotted hatched oval (K8.1), fringed bulb (K14.1), scale pattern (K110.5), alternating arcs or triangles (K22.2, K22.6, K23.44), dotted curvilinear pattern (K22.2), and fringing (K14.1, K22.3, K75.9, K110.5, K114.3^1, K115.7, K150.2). Many pyxides are of very soft fabric and no trace of the decoration still remains. Handles are decorated either with strokes or are solidly painted. Secondary motifs on the shoulders include hatched triangles (K22.4, K75.9), loops (K8.1, K85.6, K.23), zigzag (K114.3), and oblique or upright strokes (K40.5, K115.7, K147.16). Under the handles are designs of spirals (K114.3), wavy lines (K8.1), chevrons (K22.4, K85.6, K115.7), or fringed chevron with tail (K114.4). Pyxides were not often made in coarse wares. Only three examples are known: two are large and plain (K137.1, M4.3), one from the settlement and the other from one of the Ta Mnemata tombs. The third is a most unusual shape (Type 7), better identified as a straight sided alabastron (K80.8). It has a ring base, straight sides above a low carination, handles on the sharply carinated shoulder, and a small mouth. The two coarse pyxides from the settlement are both burned and may have stood near the hearth or been used in cooking or the preparation or storage of food. The distribution of pyxides on the site is instructive. Nearly every house had one, but there were a few areas Seiradaki, 18-9, fig. 12.

Seiradaki mentioned three in K 22, and there are four extant examples; K 110 and K 114 were also said to contain three each, K 80 in the Priest's House had four, while K 116 produced as many as six.174 The presence of pyxides in lower deposits in K 23 and below streets and courts in K 76 and K 79-89 indicates that the shape was present in the early stages of the settlement, and the large number of nearly complete vessels shows that they were popular at the end of the settlement's history, but that the inhabitants did not carry them away when they left. Because of their frequency at Karphi, pyxides were thought to be one of the most common LMIIIC shapes, but subsequent excavations of LM IIIC sites produced surprisingly few examples.175 The popularity of the pyxis seems to be a local peculiarity of the Karphi assemblage. The function of these vessels is unknown, but several of them have lids (K110.5, K114.4), so they may have served as small boxes for storage of objects or food. It is possible that they were used for storing precious objects (so many of them are elabora tely decorated and fine), as suggested by Seiradaki,176 but they could have been used for storage of food (like modern plastic containers); many of the pyxides show traces of burning, suggesting the possibility that they were placed near the cooking fires. The elaborate decoration suggests that they were meant to impress, and it is likely that they made a statement about the status of the inhabitants on social or ritual occasions. The presence of so many in a room with goddesses with upraised arms (K 116) suggests that they may have also had a ritual function. Pyxides were not found in the tombs, with the exception of M4.3, one of the largest found, and it was in coarse ware. Hut urn (FIG. 9.16) The hut urns from Karphi have been well published, and only the examples from Mikre Koprana (MK.12) and the Great House Shrine (K16.1) can be added to the published lists by Hägg and Mersereau.177 There are nine preserved hut urns from Karphi, including a piece found in K 149 that was inventoried as a terracotta palette, but identified by Hägg as a hut urn door;178 of the other eight, half are in fine wares (K33.2, K110.6, K115.8, K147.17), the other half are coarse (K16.1, K69.2, K122.4, MK.12). The fine hut urns tend to be smaller than those of coarse wares, although the largest and smallest examples are both coarse. All have domed tops and cut out doorways, and all but one have pierced lugs on either side of the doorways; the doors themselves are missing except in K147.17 and K122.4. Most hut urns are plain, but K33.2 is monochrome painted and decorated with incised lines. K115.8 may have been burnished. K147.17 has small horned projections over the doorway, possibly representing horns of consecration. Otherwise, the hut urns are devoid of decoration. The coarse examples of hut urns are similar to the fine ones, except for a greater variation in sizes. At least two of the coarse hut urns are of cooking pot fabric, but this fabric was used for other kinds of pottery at Karphi. One example (MK.12) has a green stain on the interior, as if from bronze, possibly from a pin that kept the doorway in place. Seiradaki noted a similarity in shape to pyxides,179 and Mersereau believed that the hut urns derived from the pyxis shape, but that the potters adapted the form to create an architectural model.180 Petrakis, however, has questioned how this similarity in form could reflect a deeper conceptual link between pyxides and hut urns, and has rejected the association.181 Not noted by either scholar is the great difference in size and decoration between pyxides and hut urns, and if the method of creating the hut urn was derived from the manufacture of pyxides, there seems to be little other connection between the two ceramic forms. Pyxides tend to be large and have elaborate decoration, and their appearance, even with a conical lid, is very far removed from that of the hut urns. Although Seiradaki suggested that hut urns may have been influenced by basketwork cages for birds or small animals, rather than by tholos tombs or granaries, most scholars have seen them as imitating tholos tombs; in fact, Petrakis has suggested that the tholos tomb is the only possible architectural prototype.182 The tholoi of this period, however, tend to be square or rectangular at the bottom, whereas the hut urns are always round, a fact that diminishes the connection between the two forms. To my knowledge, no one has suggested that hut urns are meant to represent the other common round and corbelled or vaulted structures of the period, namely kilns, and it is difficult to imagine any reason for showing such a mundane architectural form.183 174 Seiradaki, 18. 175 Nearly every report of a LM IIIC site includes a statement of surprise at the paucity of pyxides. So Kastri, 84; Hallager 2000, 153. At Kavousi, the Kastro produced no pyxides (Mook, personal communication) and there were few at Vronda (Day et al. forthcoming). 176 Seiradaki, 18. 177 Hagg 1990; Mersereau 1993. 178 Seiradaki, 27, n. 59; Mersereau 1993, 35. 179 Seiradaki, 18, 28. 180 Mersereau, 6-8. 181 Petrakis 2006, 185. 182 Seiradaki, 28; Petrakis 2006, 188. 183 It is true, however, that the goddess figures were fired in such vaulted kilns, such as the one at Kavousi -Vronda', see Day, Coulson and Gesell 1989, 104-5. It is interesting to note that the kiln at Vronda is on the outskirts of the community, but quite close to the shrine. At least one cylindrical stand fragment was found within the kiln, and this was misfired, so</page><page sequence="300">POTTERY ANALYSIS K110.6 K115.8 K147.17 K33.2 t K69.2 K122.4 MK.12 L I I K16.1 Fig. 9.16. Hut urns. Scale 1:4. The function of the hut urns has been hotly debated, and there is little new evidence to add to the discussion here. Mersereau thought that they were household cult objects connected to the worship of the goddess with upraised arms, because of the two later SM and PG models with figures of the goddesses within, but Hallager has challenged that idea for LM IIIC, it is quite likely that the cult equipment was produced at the site and in this particular kiln (as also suggested by the use of mostly local fabrics). If, as Hallager suggests (2009, 119— 20), the hut urns are thought of as housing guardian spirits of a workshop, then it is possible that these hut urns could belong to potters.</page><page sequence="301">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION suggesting that hut urns might have functioned as 'spirit houses' to house the guardian spirits of a household or workshop.184 Petrakis has used the similarity in form to tholos tombs to suggest that hut urns have an explicit connection with death, perhaps representing the tomb type in which the ancestors of the kin group were buried.185 At Karphi hut urns are not widespread, a fact which suggests that whatever their use, hut urns were not part of the normal domestic assemblages of the houses. On the other hand, they were not found in any identifiable specialised contexts. Hut urns are totally lacking from the Temple, and they were not found in any room that can be identified as related to the worship of the goddess with upraised arms. The largest hut urn came from K 16, a room that almost certainly was dedicated to the worship of the goddess at some point in its history, as fragments of goddesses and attendant ritual equipment were found in the vicinity; it is not clear, however, if the hut urn and the cult equipment were in use at the same time. No hut urns were found or identified in K 116, which was another shrine of the goddess. No examples were found in either rooms with altars or snake tubes (K57, K 58), nor in the room with the two rhyta (K 27). The hut urn from K 115 may have a religious connection, as human and animal figurines were found in the deposit in the next room (K 106), and similarly the hut urn from K 69 may have a connection with the animal figurines found next door in K 85 and K 87. If hut urns have a religious connection, it is not with the shrines of the goddess with upraised arms, but with smaller and perhaps less formal religious observances that involved animal figurines. At least three of the hut urns were burned to a greater or lesser degree (K69.2, K110.6, MK.12), but none of them shows the kind of burning associated with cooking; they may have contained small oil lamps or had lamps placed next to them. All in all, there is little in the shape and their contexts to suggest a single function for hut urns. Stirrup jar (FIG. 9.17-9.18) Stirrup jars occur in abundance at Karphi, both the small, fine, decorated variety (fig. 9.17) and the large coarse transport or storage stirrup jars (fig. 9.18). Stirrup jars are among the most common fine closed shapes, both in the settlement and in the tombs. They are also among the most easily recognisable. They occur in all sizes and in all fabrics. Basically there are three types: small fine, decorated stirrup jars (11-20 in height), medium-sized stirrup jars (20-30 in height) in coarse or medium-coarse fabrics, and large coarse stirrup jars (over 30 in height) used primarily for storage and/or transport; all sizes exist in fine fabrics, but the small stirrup jars are confined to fine wares. Seiradaki defined eight different types of stirrup jar, of which five are found in fine wares (Types 1,2, 3,4, and 7); Types 5, 6, and 8 are in medium-coarse or coarse fabrics. Nearly all examples of fine stirrup jars at Karphi were manufactured using a technique recognised as diagnostic of LM IIIC.186 The base and body of the vessel were thrown but the top with the false spout was made separately as a disc that was then added on to the body with a ridge of clay on the interior to strengthen the join between the two. Two features thought to be typical of later LM IIIC stirrup jars are not common on the Karphi examples. One is the cone top of the false spout, which is seen by Kanta as a feature that is typical of the mature LM IIIC period.187 Only one stirrup jar from the settlement has a cone on the top, albeit a small one (K110.9), and only a single example from the tombs (M3.1). A stirrup jar that probably comes from the Ta Mnemata tombs but was unlabelled (K.29) also has a cone on top. This feature probably belongs, as Hallager has suggested, to advanced IIIC through SM.188 The other feature often used as a chronological marker is the air hole close to the neck or handles.189 None of the stirrup jars from the settlement show this feature, and only two from the tombs (M4.5, M11.4). The two examples from the tombs date to late LM IIIC (M4.5) or SM (Ml 1.4), supporting Mountjoy's suggestion that this is a late feature. Of the types of fine stirrup jars, all of the illustrated examples in the publication are from the tombs, except for Type 7, which only occurs in a single example from the settlement (K47.2). The most common shape in both settlement and tombs is Type 2, of which there are numerous examples (FIG. 9.17); the Type 2 stirrup jar has a globular body and ring base. The Type 1 vessel illustrated in Seiradaki was not located, and no certain examples have been found of the shape. Type 3 was confined to a single vessel (M4.5), and its chief distinguishing feature was the air hole behind the false spout. Type 4 is short (M3.1), with a slight knob on its false spout. Seiradaki's Types 3 and 4 both have larger spouts than those on Types 1 and 2, and often these spouts are angled back to touch the false spout (M3.1, M4.5, Ml 1.4, K.29); only one example of a stirrup jar from the settlement shows this feature (K110.9), and it also has the knob on top of the false spout, an indication of later date. The pulled-back large spout may thus be another late feature. 184 Hallager 2009, 119-20. 185 Petrakis 2006, 204. 186 Popham 1965,320. The same feature is found in Khania; see Hallager 2000, 144, although she also finds examples from late LM IIIB:2 there. It can also be seen on a stirrup jar from Kastri; see Kastri, 289, fig. lOe (KP 26). 187 Kanta 1980, 247; see also Popham 1965, 320, who thinks it is diagnostic of LM IIIC in all phases, and Hallager 2007, 190, who thinks it comes in late in LM IIIC early. 188 Hallager 2000, 146. 189 Mountjoy (2007, 223) sees the airhole as a feature of SM.</page><page sequence="302">POTTERY ANALYSIS Mmm M3.2 TYPE 2 M4.5 TYPE 3 T s M3.1 TYPE 4 K47.2 TYPE 7 K85.9 K116.4 Ml 1.4 K150.3 M8.3 Fig. 9.17. Fine stirrup jars. Scale 1:4. The straight-sided or carinated stirrup jar (Type 7) is most unusual and exists only in a single example (K47.2), although Seiradaki mentions another from K 80. As Kanta observed, the straight-sided stirrup jar is found from LM IIIA on, but is common in LM IIIC;190 a similar stirrup jar was also found at Khama levri of early LM IIIC date.191 An unusual type with angular sides (K85.9) finds a parallel at Kritsa of LM IIIB date.192 The decoration of the stirrup jars is elaborate. In general, the stirrup jars have bands on the lower body (many small bands, groups of larger bands enclosing small bands, large and small bands in various arrangements).193 Those with many small lines seem to belong in very early LM IIIC, while those with groups of lines and bands in careful patterns seem to be later, but earlier than those with broader bands or bands in no pattern. The main decorative field is usually confined to the shoulder or to the shoulder and upper body, although on a few examples there is a secondary field between bands on the middle of the body (K44.4, K85.9, K149.18, M3.2), with simple designs of wavy lines, strokes, dotted scallops, and zigzag. This secondary decoration of the sides of stirrup jars is thought to be 190 Kanta 1980, 248. 191 Andreadaki-Vlasaki and Papadopoulou 2005, 372, fig. 32. 192 Kanta 1980, 248, fig. 125.3. 193 Mountjoy RMDP, 1044 suggests that the use of groups of narrow lines between broad bands is a distinctly Minoan feature.</page><page sequence="303">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION if K33.4 TYPE 5 K26.10 TYPE 8 K114.7 K110.16 Fig. 9.18.

Very common are half medallions, usually three or four of them, with their rounded edges at the top. These are commonly filled with ovals that are hatched with straight (K110.9, K113.2) or wavy (K115.9, K121.10) lines, sometimes dotted so that they look like fishes (K38.6, M16.4). The triangular space below can be filled with bulbs and filler (Kl 10.9), multiple triangles (K121.10), or other motifs.

The more rigid straight type is found on vessels from the tombs and not in the settlement. Other motifs on stirrup jars include multiple triangles (M11.4, M15.1), fringed and filled triangles (M4.5, M14.5), fringed, cross hatched and dotted triangles (K23.19), multiple upright loops, often fringed (K16-17.1, K75.ll, K110.10), dotted scales (K85.9, M3.2), alternating arcs (K79 89.25, K47.2), Minoan flower (K45.6, K79-89.25, K149.19), U-pattern (K109.1, K.31), triangles filled with arcs (M3.2, M9.1, M 14.5-6), spirals (K38.7, K125.1), crosshatched lozenge (K76.51), scroll or moustache pattern (MK.8), and various other recti linear and curvilinear patterns. The exception to this definition of the decorative field can be found on a class of stirrup jars with octopus motifs that cover a large percentage of the surface. In general, these stirrup jars are larger than the ordinary ones, measuring 15.5-20.5 in height instead of the more usual 11-18. All the octopus stirrup jars are from the settlement (K59.1, K83.2, K134.3-4, K147.14, K149.17, K150.3, and possibly K120.4 and K109.1), and none came from the tombs, although the stirrup jar fragment from M 8 (M8.ll) may have octopus decoration. Three of these octopus stirrup jars are similar (K134.3-4, K150.3), with the eyes and body of the octopus below the spout, and tentacles that curve around the vessel and end in filled medallions on the back; two of these (K134.3, K150.3) have also panels of zigzags with scalloped edges and may be from the same workshop or by the same hand. K83.2 is slightly different and has an octopus with a crosshatched topknot and fringed tentacles. Another type of octopus decoration is represented by two fragments from Mikre Koprana (K147.14, K149.17) that certainly come from the same vessel and fell on either side of the doorway between the two rooms; these portray the octopus in a more miniature style, with multiple dotted lines for tentacles. Each of these octopus stirrup jars is unique, and while parallels exist on other LM IIIC octopus stirrup jars from Crete and Rhodes, they are not particularly close.195 The dating of the octopus stirrup jars still remains a problem, as they seem to appear in both early and late LM IIIC deposits.196 Of the Karphi examples, K83.2 is closest to the early LM IIIC examples from Tourloti and Mouliana, and is probably of early date.197 K150.3, K134.3, and K134.4, however, are much more formally arranged, with more rectilinear filling ornaments and the tentacles ending in filled medallions; they may date later in early LM IIIC or even belong to the middle part of LM IIIC. That so many of the octopus stirrup jars were found nearly complete on the floors of the settlement indicates that they were in use at the end of the period, although they may have been manufactured earlier. They are elaborate and beautiful vessels that probably were high-status objects and they may have been used or displayed long after the potters who produced them were gone. Another unusual stirrup jar, both in shape and decoration, is an example from Ta Mnemata tomb 8 (M8.3). This is globular, but has a wide flat base instead of the usual ring base or raised concave variety. It has a short, wide spout touching an equally short, wide false spout. Spirals decorate the shoulder, and the body has a large zone decorated with wavy line or debased octopus motif. The shape and decoration are unusual for this period, but a similar coarse example can be found in Oxford, without, however, any good date from context.198 The Karphi example lacks the air hole in the disc that is so common on coarse examples of the shape. The decoration of the handles and spouts also shows a good deal of variation. The handles can be barred with strokes (K23.19, K38.6, K59.1, K72.2, K110.9 10, K115.9, K121.10, M3.1, K.29), outlined with vertical bands (K116.4, K134.3, K150.3, M3.2, IY114.5 6), or have a wavy band (M4.5), vertical bands (K120.4, Ml 1.4), or be solid (M4.4, MK.8). Kanta suggested that the use of loops to outline the handles and spouts was less common in LMIIIC,199 and indeed it is only found on K110.9. The spouts are decorated with single (M14.5-6) or multiple bands (K110.9, K115.9, K116.4, MK.8, Mil.4) or with strokes (M3.1-2); those with bands generally look late. The top of the disc of the false spout most frequently bears spirals (K110.9, K116.4, K121.10, M3.1, M4.5, M14.5-6, M16.4), but also circle(s) (K115.9, MK.8, M3.2, M8.3) and arcade patterns (K38.6, K59.1, K134.3-4, K150.3), the latter found particularly on the octopus stirrup jars. One example (M4.5) also has a pinwheel design on the interior of the spout. The latest stirrup jars from Karphi are from the tombs; the latest is doubtless M11.4, which is probably early in PG, to judge from the parallels for its shape and decoration. It has a true conical foot, an ovoid body, a pulled back spout, and an air hole, although it is missing the cone on the false spout. K116.4 does not look as late, but certainly is the latest stirrup jar from within the settlement; the foot is not yet conical, but the body is ovoid, and the decoration while linear, still 195 For octopus stirrup jars, see Kanta 1980, 255-6 and RMDP 1045-51. The closest parallels for K83.2 are the Kritsa stirrup jar (Kanta 1980,fig. 136.1)andthe one from Myrsini (Kanta 1980, fig. 137.2). Elements of decoration found on K34.3 and K150.3 find parallels on Minoan jars found at Ialysos; for the use of strokes as filler on the lower part, cf. RMDP, pi. 8e, f; for the medallions, cf.

M3.1 may also be late, since it has a rather high foot and a cone on top of the false spout. All the others look LMIIIC. Although stirrup jars occur in both burial and settlement contexts, a greater percentage of the tomb pottery consists of stirrup jars than is the case in the settlement; of the 65 catalogued pots from the graves, 16 are stirrup jars (25%). The stirrup jar seems to have been a major grave offering, whether because of the intrinsic value of the vessel itself or for its contents. There are two fine stirrup jars that do not fit into the category of small stirrup jars, K114.7 and K147.15. These large stirrup jars (H. 32 and 39) are similar to an example from Khania, which on the basis of the clay analysis is thought to have been imported there from Knossos.200 The shape of K147.15 from Karphi is similar, but is squatter and more biconical; the decoration is too worn to determine. It may be an import in Karphi, but it has been so badly burned that it is difficult to determine. K114.7 is more ovoid in shape, but not as globular as the Khania example; it also has a similar concave top to the false spout. Both Karphi examples are pierced in the centre of the hollow false spout, a feature that is common on coarse stirrup jars. All of the medium-coarse stirrup jars seem also to be medium in size, although many are simply fragments. Some were decorated, but others were not. They seem to be squat and globular in shape, with wide, flat bases (K139.1, K.36). Both of the nearly complete examples have large but short spouts and false spouts, and the false spout on one example (K70.1) is concave and pierced. The shapes and fabrics are much like those found in coarse wares; the major difference is in the frequency or size of the inclusions. K23.23 had painted decoration on a creamy slip, but not much was preserved, and all that can be said is that there were arcs used as filler in curvilinear triangles. Several body fragments of medium-coarse fabrics with debased octopus or wavy line decoration were found, and these may well come from stirrup jars (K23.24, K31.13, K77.3, K101.10). Coarse stirrup jars were common (FIG. 9.18). Three of Seiradaki's types are found almost exclusively in coarse fabrics: Types 5, 6, and 8. They tend to be medium-sized (20-30 in height) or large (30-55 in height), although there is one small example (K.45) with a height of 16. Coarse stirrup jars tend to have wide flat bases, and be globular or ovoid in shape; only the large stirrup jar from K 26 (K26.10) has a raised base. Both the spouts and the false spouts of coarse stirrup jars are short and wide, and the spouts are often tilted to touch or nearly touch the false spouts. Where the false spouts are preserved, they are concave on top, hollow, and pierced through the middle (K1.13, K26.10, K33.4, K70.1, K85.13, K.45-46); Type 6, of which no example was found, had a solid false spout. Most of the stirrup jars are plain, but a few are decorated. Stirrup jar K33.4 has painted decoration of bands, with crude spirals on the shoulder. The very large storage stirrup jar K110.16 is decorated with an octopus, and the tentacles go around the vessel in two rows. Probably similar to this vessel are the numerous coarse fragments bearing large wavy bands, possibly the tentacles of debased octopods (Kll.ll, K40-41.1, K45.9, K54.6, K75.14-15, K76.54-55, K77.4-5, K79 89.30, K149.22). K85.13 has incised decoration: vertical and oblique strokes on the handles, incisions around the edge of the false spout. K26.10 is mono chrome-painted. Coarse stirrup jars come in a variety of fabrics, like many of the other coarse wares; those tested petro graphically, however, are most often in flysch fabrics (Fabric groups 3 and 4) and may not be local. The evidence from Karphi for the most part seems to support the idea that coarse octopus stirrup jars were popular in the early phases of the settlement's use, but declined toward the end; most of the fragments come from early deposits under streets and courts. The single exception is the nearly complete stirrup jar from K 110, which was certainly being used just before Karphi was abandoned. Coarse stirrup jars are well known in LM IIIC sites on Crete, and they come primarily from early LM IIIC contexts, such as Khania, Kastri, and Phase I at Kavousi-Aa.s'/ro.201 Two coarse octopus stirrup jars were found at Kavousi-Vronda, but neither comes from a secure late LM IIIC context, and they may be from the earlier LM IIIC period.202 Thelastron (FIG. 9.19) Seiradaki distinguished four different types of side spouted jugs, represented by only 15 examples in the settlement and five in the tombs.203 Types 1 and 2 have basket handles. Type 1 is in medium-coarse fabric and has an offset base; it was said to be more common than Type 2. The Type 2 thelastron illustrated is in coarse ware and badly warped from misfiring; no other like it appears in the Karphi assemblages. Types 3 and 4 were rare; Type 3 has a vertical handle opposite the spout, while Type 4 has no handle. Seven nearly complete examples are preserved from the settlement and five from the tombs. Many of the examples are missing the handles, making it difficult to distinguish their types. Those of Type 1 include K1.7 and K23.18, while K11.6 is the only example of Type 2. K1.4 and Ml 1.3 are of Type 3 and M8.12 and M17.6 seem to be of Type 4; 200 Khania II, 41, 163, pi. 50.71-P 0736/0763/0779/77-P 0719. 201 Khania II, pi. 50.71-P 0736/0763/0779/77-P 0719, thought to be an import into Khania; Kastri, fig. 15.P24, fig. 16.P6; Mook and Coulson 1997, 319-20, figs. 15, 17.36-7 (Kavousi-Kastro). 202 Gesell, Coulson and Day 1991, 151, fig. 3.2; Day 2005,436. 203 Seiradaki, 14—6, fig. 10.</page><page sequence="306">POTTERY ANALYSIS K1.7 TYPE 1 Ml 7.6 TYPE 4 I K26.6 TYPE 4 K11.6 TYPE 2 M11.3 THELASTRON K39.5 TYPE 5 K1.4 TYPE 3 K100.4 JUGLET Fig. 9.19. Thelastron, juglets, and bottle. Scale 1:4. K100.4, K132.4, M12.1, M17.5, and K.28 have no rim or handles preserved, and it is difficult to determine to which class they belong. At least two of the thelastra come from the Temple and are misfired blue ware, one fine (K1.4), the other medium-coarse (K1.7); the others are ordinary fine wares, except for K11.6, which is coarse. This vessel is larger than usual; it is misfired into blue ware, and is very warped. While coarse thelastra are even less common than the fine examples, a parallel can be found at Kavousi- Vronda of late LM IIIC date.204 Most of the finer examples from the settlement have small raised concave bases; K1.4 has quite a high foot. The thelastra from the tombs all have raised, concave feet; M17.6 has a real ring base, and Ml 1.3 has a conical foot. The tombs from which the last two come contain later pottery that is probably PG, and these may belong to the same date. All thelastra have globular bodies, with the spouts set at an angle on the side. The necks are narrow, like juglets, and the rims flare out to a greater or lesser degree. Thelastra are simply decorated most commonly with blob decoration, which appears on the examples from the tombs (Ml 1.3, Ml7.5-6); one example has a wavy line above bands (Ml2.1), and another is uncertain (M8.12). Thelastra from the settlement are decorated 204 Day, Coulson and Gesell 1986, 379 and fig. 12.35.</page><page sequence="307">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINA TION with bands (K100.4), monochrome paint (K23.18), and in one instance a pattern of horizontal multiple loops (K1.4). Others may have been plain, but they are too worn to be certain (K1.7, K132.4, K.28). The thelastron is often called a feeding bottle, but its precise function is uncertain. The shape is common enough in LM III, and the shape with more globular body and narrow neck, without a rivet at the back of the handle is typical of LM IIIC.205 It is interesting that the shape appears in both tombs and settlement, but like stirrup jars, there are proportionally more thelastra in the tombs, and the form seems to continue into the later periods in cemetery assemblages.206 Juglet (FIG. 9.19) Very small jugs are treated as a separate category, since they are so different in size and hence probably in function from their larger counterparts. A juglet is any one-handled jug less than 10 in height, with a rim diameter between 2.5^1. Seiradaki includes two types of juglet in her typology for one-handled jugs: Types 4 and 5.207 Type 4 has a slightly raised base and a wide short neck, while Type 5 has a higher base, is more globular, and has a taller narrower neck, rather like the later lekythos shape; the example illustrated by Seiradaki is said to be from K 89, but no jug from this location was found, and the juglet from K 39 looks much like the illustrated vessel. There are seven nearly complete examples of the juglet from the settlement (K7.2, K22.5, K26.6, K39.5, K85.7, K96.2, K.25-26). Three juglets came from the tombs, two from Ta Mnemata (M14.3-4), and one from Atsividhero (A1.2). Most of these resemble Seiradaki's Type 4, but a few seem to be ofType 5 (K39.5, M14.3, A1.2, K.25). These small juglets generally have raised concave bases; the exceptions are K26.6, which has a flat concave base and K.26, K51.2, and M14.3, all of which have raised bases that are flat on the bottom. The raised feet can be very low (K.25) or high (K96.2, A1.2). The decoration on juglets is simple; three examples are monochrome (K26.6, K85.7, M14.3), one has blob decoration (K22.5), and one has a teardrop between oblique lines above bands (K39.5). The others appear to be plain (K7.2, K50.1, K51.2, K.25), but given their surface preservation, it is not certain. The plain juglets are similar in shape to the decorated ones and seem to be close to Type 5, although two of them lack rims. There are two examples of miniature juglets in medium-coarse fabrics (K61.13, K87.2), one of them possibly a Type 4, the other more carinated and of no known type. Both are squat, with flat bases, and neither has its rim or handle preserved. K61.13 is probably similar to juglet K26.6. Juglets have been found in LM IIIC contexts at Khania, although they are not common,208 and they also exist at Kavousi -Kastro in Phase II.209 Although juglets began on the mainland early in LH IIIC,210 they became popular again in the Late Geometric and Early Orienta lising Periods, where they were used as grave offerings. On Crete the juglet appeared in LM IIIB late and continued into IIIC.211 The juglet K39.5 looks very much like these later examples in shape and decoration, but it is probably LM IIIC. Bottle (fig. 9.19) There is a single example of this shape, which also might be termed a lekythos, and it comes from one of the Ta Mnemata tombs (M1.2). It is a tall, cylindrical shape, with a wide, slightly concave raised base and a narrow neck widening to a very flared rim (restored) with a single vertical handle from rim to shoulder. The vessel is decorated with multiple narrow bands on the lower body, with the base, shoulder, and neck in black monochrome paint. This is clearly not a Minoan shape, and there are no Bronze Age parallels; it seems to be a Cypriote development. The shape is thought to have been introduced into Crete from Cyprus in the early Iron Age, and the closest parallel is an example from Athens dating to the transition from Sub-Mycenaean to PG.212 The bottle seems to be used primarily as a grave offering, and is only found in tombs in Cyprus, Crete, and the mainland. It should date to SM or EPG. Jug (FIG. 9.20-21) One-handled jugs are very common in the settlement at Karphi. Jugs are more plentiful and more varied than amphoras, which show the same shapes but have two handles; it is often difficult to distinguish jugs from amphoras. One to three jugs were found in every room; in a few cases (K 121, K 23) four or more jugs were found in the same room. These jugs come in fine, medium-coarse, and coarse fabrics, and can be decorated or left plain. Seiradaki distinguished 11 types of jugs (FIG. 9.20).213 Types 1, 6, and 7 are found chiefly in fine wares, while Types 3, 9, and 11 are primarily in medium-coarse and coarse fabrics. Type 2 is found only in a single example that is medium-coarse. Type 8 is a 205 Kanta 1960, 281; Hallager 2000, 154. 206 In addition to the examples mentioned in west Crete by Hallager, there are thelastra also in the tombs in the Knossos area. The North Cemetery produced a close parallel for M17.5 of SM date: Coldstream and Catling 1996,302, pi. 165.121.7. Parallels for both Ml 7.6 and Ml 1.3 were found at Ayios Ioannis of EPG date (Boardman 1960, pi. 37 IV5 and 6). 207 Seiradaki, 15, fig. 9. 208 Hallager 2000, 151-2. 209 Mook and Coulson 1997, 355-6, fig. 25.85. 210 Mountjoy 1986, 143 calls the shape a lekythos. 211 Hallager 2007, 190; the narrow-necked variety like K39.5, however, she called a lekythos and saw it as a new shape in LM IIIC (Hallager 2007, 192). 212 Desborough 1964, 27-8, pi. 16d. 213 Seiradaki, 14-5, fig. 9.</page><page sequence="308">POTTERY ANALYSIS K57.4 TYPE 1 K148.6 TYPE 2 K23.29 TYPE 3 MK.16 TYPE 6 K11.4 TYPE 7 K113.3 TYPE 9 K87.1 TYPE 10 K114.9 TYPE 11 Fig. 9.20.

Types 4 and 5 are juglets and have been discussed above (p. 296). There is only a single example each of Types 6 and 10. Type 9 is a spouted jug with a thickening or 'wattle' below the spout. No examples are extant of this type with the 'wattle', but there are several spouted jugs that might be placed in this category (K113.3, K107.6). The majority of fine jugs fall into three of Seiradaki's types: 1, 3, and 7. All these jugs are cylindrical-necked and wide-mouthed; trefoil mouthed jugs are rare, and none are known in fine wares. Jugs come in small and large varieties. The small jugs are primarily in fine wares, and they range from 12-14 in height, with rim diameters of 4.7-7 (fig. 9.21). Few of them have both rim and base preserved. K31.ll has a ring base. K110.8 and K121.9 have tall cylindrical necks with flaring rims. K12.31, K17.19, and K79-89.27 all have shorter necks with more flaring rims that look rather like stirrup jar spouts. K.27 is only a body sherd. The small jugs have simple decoration: wavy lines on the shoulder (K31.ll, K110.8) or on the neck (K79-89.27, K121.9). K.27 has alternating broad and narrow bands on the lower body and an oblique solid leaf on the shoulder. The neck of K17.19 has a band, and the top of K12.31 is monochrome. The interior can have a band (K12.31, K79-89.27, K110.8, K121.9) or a reserved band (K17.19); K110.8 has strokes on top of the rim. Large cylindrical-necked jugs are more common (FIG. 9.20-21). These are 17.7-22.3 in height, with rim diameters of 6.5-12.2. One of these (K57.4) is of Type 1, one of Type 3 (K23.29), one of Type 6 (MK.16), one ofType 10 (K87.1), and two are ofType 7 (K11.4, K107.5). K134.5 is a fine version ofType 11. Two jugs do not fall into Seiradaki's types. K11.5 has a flat base, ovoid body, and tall neck with a flaring rim; it resembles Type 7, but with a wider neck and less globular body. K3.8 is also unusual; it has a raised concave base, a globular-biconical body, and a very narrow neck (rim diameter 4.5). This vessel was constructed rather like the stirrup jars, with the top thrown separately and added on as a disc, with a ridge of clay inside at the attachment. Other fine jugs are too fragmentary to determine a type (K3.7, K11.7, K23.20, K23.69, K79 89.26, K107.7-8, K17.7, V.l, K.44). Bases are either raised or flat, and ring bases are not uncommon (K80.5, K148.6, MK.16). The bodies are generally globular, and necks cylindrical; sometimes there is a ridge at the juncture of the neck and body, perhaps to strengthen the joint between the neck and body (K3.8, K11.4-5, K87.1, K107.5, K107.7, K115.10, K116.6, MK.16),214 and often this ridge is decorated with incisions or is punctuated. Rims are usually simple and flaring; one example (K148.6) has a concave depression around the interior of the rim. Handles show a variety of treatments; they can be round or elliptical. At least three jugs have braided handles (K11.7, K107.5, K.44), one is incised with chevrons (K80.5), and two have an added coil of clay down the centre (K87.1, K148.6). One of the most elaborate handles is that on K107.5 with its twisted coil of clay down the centre; three holes are pierced at the lower attachment, perhaps for more even firing. A similar handle, even with the three holes at the base, can be found on an Archaic jug from Atsalenio at Knossos.215 Finally, a jug fromTa Mnemata Tomb 8 (M8.13) has an unusual ridged handle with painted oblique strokes that looks like a survival from the Neopalatial period. Large jugs are elaborately or simply decorated. The main field of decoration is the shoulder, with bands on the lower body; a secondary field is the neck. Decoration is most often painted, but on one unusual vase (K87.1) there is also incised decoration of beaded triangles with oblique beaded strokes in the lower corners. This piece finds parallels at Kato Symi,216 Afrati,217 and Enkomi on Cyprus;218 in most of these cases, the jugs were found in a context that implied ritual activities.219 Jug K57.4 has an elaborate decoration of a half medallion with strokes or solid fillers, and in the centre a pendent crosshatched triangle with two upright solid triangles, loops and filler arcs. Jug MK.16 has running spirals with double tangents on the body and loops alternating with crosshatched triangles on the shoulder. K80.5 has a whorl shell with dots. K23.29 has a curvilinear design of possible spirals with long tails. Other jugs have simpler decoration of necklace (K23.20) or curvilinear pattern (K11.5). A number of vessels are monochrome (K107.5, K107.7). One spouted jug has a quirk on the neck (K107.6). Finally, there is one jug from the Vitzelovrysis Spring area that has compass-drawn concentric semicircles on the shoulder (V.l), certainly a fragment of PG date, possibly from the mainland. The lower body is painted with bands, generally one to three at the middle, and one at the base; sometimes there is another band on the lower body, or several bands, either wide bands alternating with narrow bands (MK.16) or narrow bands (K80.5). There are also generally bands at the 214 As Seiradaki, 13, suggests for amphoras. 215 Kourou and Karetsou 1998, 247, fig. 12. 216 Kanta 1991,497, fig. 31. 217 Stampolides and Karetsou 1998, 74.40; Kanta and Karetsou 1998, 165, fig. 9. 218 Kanta 1991, 497, fig. 31 (Kato Symi); Stampolides and Karetsou 1998, 74.40; Kanta and Karetsou 1998, 165, fig. 9 (Afrati); Dikaios 1969, pi. 106.5; Pilides 1997, 210, fig. 1; Stampolides and Karetsou 1998, 74 no. 39 (Enkomi). This vessel is seen as an import into Cyprus (Mountjoy 2005,193— 4, fig. 35), and since there are good parallels on Crete, it is likely that the oinochoe came from there. 219 The Enkomi jug was found in association with a shrine of the Horned God (Pilides 1997, 209), the Symi jug was found in a religious site, and the K 87 example was in association with the large terracotta horse figurine.</page><page sequence="310">POTTERY ANALYSIS K11.5 Fig. 9.21. Jugs. Scale 1:4 unless otherwise indicated. neck attachment and at the rim, and a band or bands on the interior of the rim. Handles are decorated with bands (K11.4, K23.29, K57.4) or wavy line (K11.5). Jugs are also found in plain wares, usually the larger varieties. There is only one example of a small jug that is plain (K134.5), and this is of Type 11, with knobs on the shoulder, like those in medium-coarse and coarse wares. K113.3 is also apparently plain, and is unusual in that it is spouted; it has a small flat base and a globular biconical body and cylindrical neck with flaring rim. K115.10 is of Type 7, but with a slightly concave rim. A handle with a twisted rope in the centre (K.44) from an unknown context may also come from a plain jug. There are only six jugs in medium-coarse wares. One is painted with concentric circles on the shoulders (K115.12). It most closely resembles Type 3, but has a</page><page sequence="311">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION low ring base and a shorter neck. K114.9 also is decorated, but with two rows of knobs. It is of Seiradaki's Type 11. K148.6 is Seiradaki's Type 2, and it is monochrome-painted. K116.6 is plain and has a ridge at the base of the neck. K.35 is similar to the group of small coarse jugs from K3 (K3.12-13). Finally, there is a smaller jug of blue ware (K23.22) with impressed circles on the middle of the body; this has a raised concave base and is very squat. Many large cylindrical-mouthed jugs exist in coarse wares. One is Seiradaki's Type 3 (K149.23) with a ridge at the base of the neck, one is ofType 7 (K44.10), two are ofType 11, one with knobs (K114.9), the other without (K50.2). One is of the narrow-necked variety (K115.14), another is a wider-mouthed type with a squat, almost biconical, body (K80.9). There are also smaller jugs, but since many have lost their necks, their identification is tentative. All of the probable small jugs have flat bases, sometimes slightly concave underneath, and remains of a single handle on the shoulder (K3.12 13, K23.28). K12.8 may come from a jug, but it certainly dates to after the abandonment of the settlement; its closest parallels are Geometric or later.220 Finally, there are two jugs with trefoil mouths. One is a very large specimen (K23.30) that has a pinched out rim and a handle very low on the body of the vessel; it may be a hydria, although no vertical handle is preserved. The other is a small version with a true trefoil mouth from one of the Ta Mnemata graves (M16.5); it is decorated with monochrome paint. There are no close parallels for this shape, and the trefoil mouth is highly unusual at Karphi, although elsewhere on Crete it appears as early as LM IIIA:2.221 This may be a late example, as it occurs with a flask (M16.2) that dates to SM; the jug may be SM or PG. Jugs are the basic pouring vessels for the site, and there may be functional differences among the various types. There are few spouted jugs of any type, so there seems to have been little need for careful control of the flow of the liquid. Small jugs and juglets would probably have served for liquids used in smaller quantities, like oil or vinegar. The larger jugs with cylindrical mouths may have been used for water and wine that would have been poured in some quantity. Fine decorated jugs probably functioned as tableware, while the plain fine jugs and the coarse jugs would have been for everyday use of storing water (as in a modern stamnos) or pouring into other vessels. Amphora (FIG. 9.22) Amphoras are similar to jugs but have two handles rather than one; if both handles are not preserved, they are difficult to distinguish from jugs. They are not as common as one-handled jugs, and although they are similar in shape to jugs, their variety is not as great. As with jugs, they appear in both fine and coarse wares, and they vary in size from the miniature (K23.17), with an estimated rim diameter of 2.85, to the oversize (K70.2), with an estimated rim diameter of 20. Seiradaki distinguished five types.222 Types 1 and 2 were found in fine wares, while Types 3-5 were primarily in coarse fabrics. Type 1 is represented only in a single example (K149.20), and this may be the one published in the typological chart as from K 148; it is close to the Type 1 jug in shape. Type 2 is a miniature amphora from K 23 (K23.17). A fine amphora of Type 3 was mentioned in the notebook from K108. A number of fine examples belong to none of these categories, but have narrower necks and may better be identified as flasks (see below, p. 302). K149.20 has a ring base, a globular body, and a wide neck. It is decorated on the shoulder zone with a panel of crosshatching with tailed spirals on either side; bands decorate the lower body. K3.6 may be of the same type, but it is missing the neck, and it is difficult to tell. It has a flat base and globular body. Fine amphoras are rare in LMIIIC deposits on Crete. The miniature amphora (K23.17) finds a parallel in the Kephala tomb at Knossos, probably of very late LM IIIC date.223 Few others have been found in LM IIIC contexts. A single amphora of medium-coarse fabric comes from the Southern Houses (K44.6), and it appears in a misfired blue ware. Like other small amphoras or flasks, it has a rather high ring base, and the round handles run from the neck to the shoulder. Coarse amphoras were probably used for tran sportation of liquids and for storage. Seiradaki's Types 3-5 are all in coarse wares, but in addition there is at least one amphora of Type 1 (Kl 15.15) in coarse ware which is decorated with bands and a possible wavy line; two more were mentioned in the notebook. Another decorated amphora does not fit into any of Seiradaki's types (K2.9), but finds parallels at Kastri, Khalasmenos, Sybrita/Thronos, Kavousi-Vronda, and Kommos.224 It has a wide flat or slightly concave base, a globular body, a narrow neck with a flaring rim and two handles that rise above the rim to the shoulder; this example is decorated with bands, but others often have a tassel ornament. Type 3 only exists in a single example from K 75, which was not located in the museum. It has a cylindrical mouth, flattened rim that is thickened outward andatriple handle.

Amphoras. Scale 1:4.</page><page sequence="313">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI — A RE-EXAMINATION this may be an amphoroid krater, rather than an amphora, on the basis of the rim, but if so, it is the only example of this shape from Karphi.225 Type 4 is a large amphora with rope-twisted handles, and two examples were found (K22.ll, K70.2); K70.2 has painted decoration, but only three bands are preserved. D'Agata has suggested that these amphoras with rope-twisted handles should be classed with later SM amphoras, but a very close parallel exists at Kavousi- Vronda from a clearly late LM IIIC context.226 Finally, there are two examples of Type 5, a coarse flat-based amphora with knobbed decoration on the shoulder (K23.73, K 90.3). Coarse jugs and amphoras with knobbed decoration seem to be particularly popular at Karphi, but do not appear so commonly on other LM IIIC sites. Although amphoras have a long history on Crete, in LM III they become popular only in LM IIIC, and they eventually replace the coarse transport stirrup jar.227 The shape appears in early LM IIIC levels at Khania, Kastrokephala, and Kastri, and in late LM IIIC at Kavousi-Vronda and Khalasmenos.228 Askos (fig. 9.21) There is a single example of this shape from Karphi, and it occurs in a coarse fabric (K2.ll). It has a spout rather like a stirrup jar, but the profile is assymetrical; a single elliptical handle runs from neck to shoulder. As on the stirrup jars, the neck of this vessel was apparently made separately and was added to the body, with extra clay to support the joint on the interior. The vessel has knobbed decoration. The function of this shape is uncertain, but it would have been useful for pouring small amounts of liquids that were stored within in considerable quantity. Flask (fig. 9.22) The flask is a rare shape on Crete, although it appears on the mainland from LH IIIA:2 on.229 Flasks resemble small amphoras, but they have narrow necks and bear the same relation to amphoras as lekythoi do to jugs. Although the shape appeared perhaps as early as the end of LM IIIB on Crete,230 flasks were not common in LM IIIC,231 but were popular in SM times, parti cularly in graves, where they may have contained oil or perfumed oil. Some of these SM examples are so similar that they seem to have been manufactured by a single workshop,232 like the example from Ta Mnemata (M16.2). It has the high conical foot and handles from rim to shoulder found on those examples from Knossos, and it is decorated in similar fashion with triangles with multiple strokes filling the angles as found there; even the use of bars on the outside of the handles is similar. There are, however, several examples from the settlement which could be classed as horizontal flasks (FS 193). Two of these are clearly decorated (K85.8, K116.3), while a third is too poorly preserved to tell, but has incised lines at the base of the neck (K134.2); it also has a true ring base. K85.8 has on the shoulder an upright outlined leaf, while K116.3 is decorated with a panel of crosshatching, with tailed spirals on either side and filler strokes between the panel and the tail of the spiral; it is similar to the decoration of amphora K149.20. Bands decorate the lower part of the bodies of both. On K85.8 there are bars on the handles, which run from the rim to the shoulder. All of these flasks from the settlement are different from M16.2, which has the conical foot typical of SM pottery, and they may be earlier. Another possible flask can be seen in the smaller Ml6.3. A different type of flask was found in the Great House Shrine (K18.1); this may be a lentoid flask, but only part of the neck and shoulder and one handle are preserved. Unusually, it has handles that rise from the shoulder to the base of the neck. A similar handle arrangement can be found on an imported legged flask from Pseira and on a flask from Alalakh in Syria.233 The Karphi example may be an exotic import. Jar (fig. 9.23) Seiradaki defined as jars 'all vessels with more or less in-curving rims which are too small to be termed pithoi, but which seem to have been used for storage rather than pouring.'234 Of the ten types of coarse jars distinguished by Seiradaki, some are actually other shapes. Seiradaki Type 2 is a tripod cooking pot (K1.21), as it has attachments for feet rather than a simple flat bottom. The type of jar it represents, however, is found: a deep jar with a collar and two (rather than the three on K1.21) round vertical handles on the shoulder (e.g. K11.8, K27.8, MK.5).Types 6, 7, and 8 were not found. Type 7, with its straight sides, looks more like a pyxis than a 225 Hallager 2000, 150, n. 142. 226 D'Agata 2007, 99; Day and Glowacki forthcoming (Vronda, Building E, Room El: El PI 19). 227 Day 2005, 436. 228 Hallager 2000,152 (Khania); Kanta and Karetsou 2003,160, fig. 11 A, D (Kastrokephala); Kastri, 296, fig. 16.

Jars. Scale 1:4 unless otherwise indicated.</page><page sequence="315">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION jar; Type 8 may have been a cooking dish. Type 9 is actually a larnax (K81-82.1). That leaves seven different types of jars in Seiradaki's typology Although most jars are in coarse fabrics, there are a few possible fine examples. K1.6 has a very wide mouth (34.5), tall collar, and a ridge at the attachment of the neck; it stands out as unusual in comparison to the other jar rims and neck and may be an earlier type (LM III), although no precise parallels have been found. K12.29 is a rim fragment that has a sharply out-turned rim with a band on the interior, showing that it is a closed shape. It has strokes on top that reach down on the exterior of the rim. K3.9 is also of fine fabric. Although only the top is preserved, it appears to have a rather globular body, with two horizontal round handles set on the shoulder, and a short collar, like Type 5. It may have been decorated, but the surface is too coated with sediment to be certain. There are three examples of jars in medium-coarse fabrics, and they are all decorated. One is Seiradaki's Type 10, a painted jar (K116.7) with a slightly concave base, rounded body, and nearly vertical rim; two round horizontal handles lie on the shoulder. The exterior is decorated with bands: two on the lower body, three just below the handle zone, and a broad band on the neck, and it has a wavy line in the handle zone; the handles are decorated with strokes. On the interior is a reserved band with painted band below, and the rest is covered with splatters. This vessel finds a close parallel in a coarse jar from K 115 (K115.16), and inajaratKastelli Pediada.235 K17.6 is a rim fragment from a closed shape, as it has only a band on the interior of the rim and the rest is left unpainted; the rim is too wide, however, to have been a jug and too sharply out-turned to have come from a krateriskos, so it is here identified as ajar. It has a band at the exterior rim as well as on the interior. K12.32 is of similar shape, although the mouth is not as wide. The exterior is decorated with bands, and there is no interior decoration. The majority of coarse examples fit into Seiradaki's Types 1, 2, or 3. Type 1 (K7.4, K23.31, K110.20) is a deep jar with a flat base, wide mouth, and horizontal handles on the shoulder; it can also be found in fine wares (K3.9).236 Type 2 (K11.8, K27.8, MK.5) is a similar kind of jar, but with a more articulated collar and vertical handles on the shoulder.237 This type also occurs in LM IIIC deposits at Kastelli Pediada.238 The vessel representing Type 3 was not located; it has a collar with a vertical handle that rises above the rim to the shoulder. Close to Type 3 is the jar from Ta Mnemata Tomb 9 (M9.2); this is not as globular as the pictured example, but it has the knobbed decoration that is found on jars, jugs, and amphoras in the settlement.239 Type 4 is similar to Type 3, but has a more flaring rim with a ridge below it (K2.5, K22.12, K85.14). This type is much like the pithoid jars, except that the body seems to be more rounded. Only one other fragment was recorded in the notebook, from K 71. Type 5 is rather like Type 2 but has a taller collar and the vertical handles are set farther down on the shoulder. Only one vessel of this type was recognised in coarse ware (K2.12), and it was painted; another was found in K 149, according to the notebook. Type 6 is only known from the illustrated example, said to be from K 9, and the fragment was not located.240 It has a tall vertical rim and a ridge at the attachment of the neck; the handles are round and vertical. Type 7 is an unusual cylindrical jar and may be a pyxis; none was actually found in the boxes; Seiradaki illustrated an example from K 47.241 There were no examples of Type 8; the one published in Seiradaki was not found, but it looks as though it might have been a cooking dish. Type 9 is a larnax rim. Type 10 is represented by the example from K 115 (K115.16), but a medium-coarse example also came from K 116 (K116.7). To these must be added several others that do not fit any of Seiradaki's types. K43.16 is a most unusual shape, with a rounded body and a rim that seems to be turned in to accommodate a lid fitting over it, rather like some of the pyxides; it is also pierced through the body. A similar jar can be found at Kavousi-Fro« da of LM IIIC date.242 K57.6 also has an in-turned rim that is rolled on top and has incisions below. Finally, K16.2 in fabric and shape is very out of place in the Karphi assemblage. There are two nearly identical handles preserved, but they do not necessarily go on the same vessel; a base of the same fabric does not seem to go with this rim and handle, and there may be two separate vessels represented, each with a single handle. Parallels for the general shape, the base, and the handles exist in Hellenistic Knossos, although in finer fabrics,243 but there are enough similarities to suggest that this type is a later Hellenistic intrusion. 235 Rethemiotakis 1997, 310, fig. 11c. 236 Examples ofType 1 are recorded from the notebook also from K 61 floor, K 71, K 85, K 98, K 137, and K 149. 237 Others ofType 2 are recorded in the notebook from K 71, K 108, K 109, K 124, K 136, K 139, K 147, K 148, and K 149. 238 Rethemiotakis 1997, 308, fig. 8. 239 Other examples ofType 3 mentioned in the notebook come from the following locations: outside K 23 (two examples, one decorated with knobs), K 71, K 76, K 84 (small), K 97 (may be Type 6), K 102, K 113, K 114 (two examples), K 115, K 108 (three examples), K 109, K 136 (three examples), and K 147. 240 Other fragments of this type were said to have been found in K 121, K 144, and K 150. 241 Others of Type 7 are mentioned in the notebook from K 58, K 74, K 79-89, K 112, K 102, K 106, K 107, K 108, and K 149. 242 Day and Glowacki forthcoming, IC2 P36. 243 Sackett (ed.) 1992, pi. 100.37, a fine, cylindrical kantharos of Hellenistic date; pi. 104.12 (50-28 A.C.). It looks late (Hellenistic or Roman), but there are no precise parallels.</page><page sequence="316">POTTERY ANALYSIS Jars are usually large, but smaller versions do exist; jars range in height from 10.9-36.5, while rim diameters vary from 9-32, with the majority falling between 10 and 19. Bases are generally flat or slightly concave underneath. The bodies are commonly globu lar, sometimes baggy, as in the case of K23.31. Jars are generally collared, although occasionally have a wide flaring rim. Mouths are most often wide so as to make removal of stored goods easier. Only Type 4 has a ridge below the rim (K22.12), a feature that appears more commonly on pithoid jars. Handles can be either horizontal on the shoulder or vertical, usually from the rim to the shoulder, but occasionally on the shoulder. Often there are dints at the points where the handle attaches to the body. Some coarse jars have painted decoration (K2.12, K115.16), and the decoration is usually quite simple, consisting of bands or zigzag. Other jars are decorated with knobs, like the jugs and amphoras (K11.8, K27.8, M9.2), and occasionally with incised lines (K57.6, K16.2), although these incised examples may be later intrusions. Jars are found at every LM IIIC site, but are often fragmentary and not well published. Type 1 jars, although not as baggy in shape, can be found at Yjswov&amp;i-Vronda, where they are called pitharakia.244 Jars of shapes like Type 2 appear at Khania, Khalasmenos, and Khamalevri, where they are clearly used in cooking, rather than functioning as storage vessels.245 Jars of Type 10 appear at several LM IIIC sites, including Khalasmenos and Kastelli Pediada.246 Pithoid jar (FIG. 9.24) Pithoid jars are smaller than pithoi, but like pithoi were used for storage, perhaps temporary storage, as Seiradaki suggested.247 No complete example is preserved from Karphi, and the shape is known only from rim fragments. The rims of pithoid jars are nearly identical to those found on basins or lekanai, so it is often difficult to distinguish them from basins, unless a good deal of the body or the handles are found; basins have horizontal handles below the rim, while pithoid jars have horizontal handles on or below the ridge. Pithoid jars differ from other forms of jars because they are straight-sided, almost cylindrical vessels. Seiradaki distinguished ten different types of pithoid jars based on the rims. Type 1 is actually a larnax (K29.17).248 Type 2 is better classified as a pithos; similar rims were recognised in K 66, K 83, and K 107. Type 8 is actually a round-bottomed tripod (K30.1).249 The other types are probably pithoid jars. Most com mon was Type 3, which has a flat rim, slightly outward-thickened, with a ridge below and a round horizontal handle below the ridge; the ridge on the illustrated piece (K26.13) is decorated with a chain pattern.250 Type 4 has a more rounded rim and ridge below, and there is no handle. The illustrated example from K 24 was not located, and no other examples of the type were mentioned in the notebook; it may not have been common. Type 5 has a large flat rim with a ridge below, and again the illustrated piece from K 25 could not be found, nor were there any other examples. Type 6 existed only in a single piece (K8-18.2), a fragment of a large rim with a double ridge and a chain moulding between. Type 7 had a flat squared rim with a flat ridge far below the rim; the illustrated pithoid jar from K 21 was not located.251 Type 9 also has a very flat and squared rim, and the illustrated example from K 31 was not located.252 Type 10 is a large pithoid jar (K2.14) with a profile similar to that of Type 9, with a large squared rim, but the rim is sharply undercut, and there is a sharp angle between it and the body; this type has a round horizontal handle below the ridge.253 The notebook also mentions a Type 11, but there is no indication of what this shape might be.254 One pithoid jar of Type 12 is listed from K 113, but again, there is no indication of the shape. Of the few pithoid jars remaining, the majority are large and cylindrical and have rim diameters that range from 25^48, with most examples falling between 40 and 49. The rims are nearly always flattened on top and thickened outward with a ridge below the rim. There is most often a horizontal handle set at the ridge (Type 1) or below it (Types 3 and 10). The ridge is sometimes decorated (K8-18.2, K26.13) with a row of finger impressions or a chain motif, and one example has an incised chevron on the rim (K29.16), Other pithoid jars (K17.8, K17.26-27) do not quite fit into Seiradaki's typology, although it is difficult to tell since so few examples of the types are preserved. 244 Day et al. forthcoming. 245 Khania II, pi. 45.84-P 0658, 77-P 0872; Tsipopolou 2004, 114, fig. 8.8.96-33 (Khalasmenos); Andreadaki-Vlasaki and Papadopoulou2007,46, fig. 3.28; 53, fig. 10.4 (Khamalevri). 246 Tsipopoulou2004, 112, fig. 8.6.95-71; Rethemiotakis 1997, 2310, fig. 11c. 247 Seiradaki, 5. 248 The notebooks mention other examples with this type of rim from K 66, K 77, K 114, outside K 120, K 121, and K 150. 249 Similar rims were also found in K 72, K 79-89, K 80, K 91, K 117, K 121, K 107, K 118, and K 132. 250 Other examples of Type 3 listed in the notebook include the following: K79-89,K84(2),K85,K86,K88,K91,K101, K 102 (2), K 106 (3), K 108, K 113 (2), K 115, K 121, K 124, K 127, K 133, K 135, K 136, K 138 (2), K 139, K 143 (4), K 147 (6), K 148 (2), K 149 (3). 251 According to the notebook, other examples of Type 7 came from K 79-89, K 80, K 83, K 84, K 101, K 102 (2), K 121, K 124, K 143, K 147 (2), and K 149 (2). 252 The notebook lists pithoid jars of Type 9 from the foll owing locations: K 101, K 112, K 115, K 127, K 148, and K 149 (2). 253 Other examples of Type 10 listed in the notebook come from K 72, K 73, K 79-89, K 88, K 101, and K 143. 254 Examples come from K 83, K 84, K 97, K 108, and K 139.</page><page sequence="317">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION r K26.13 TYPE 3 J 1* K8-18.2 ■ / TYPE 6 mj K2.14 TYPE 10 Fig. 9.24. Pithoidjars. Scale 1:4. The precise function of pithoid jars is uncertain. They are common at LM IIIC sites, and nearly complete examples have been found at Kastelli Pediada, Khalasmenos, and Kavousi-Vronda.255 Seiradaki thought they were used for temporary storage, and this may be correct; the inhabitants may have transferred material from the pithoi, which were used for long-term storage and were difficult to use because of their size, into pithoid jars for immediate use in cooking or eating. The wide mouths suggest a need for easy access, and there is no indication that they ever had lids. In fact, none of the terracotta lids found at Karphi is large enough to have fit a pithoid jar; if the vessels were covered, some other material must have been used, perhaps flat stone discs. There is usually more than one example for each room; perhaps they functioned like canisters for different types of staple supplies. Pithoid jars may also have been used to hold non-food items, like clothing or tools, in much the way pithoi are still used today in traditional Cretan houses. Christakis suggests that pithoi with unrestricted mouths may have been used in processing activities, and the same may be true of the pithoid jars.256 They would have made excellent chimney pots as well, and if so one would expect to see traces of blackening on the interior. Pithos (FIG. 9.25-26) Pithoi were among the most common vessels found at Karphi, and they were easily recognised. Seiradaki reports that pithoi occurred in every room except K 32, K 38, K 50, K 70, K 126, and K 140, and some rooms produced eight or more examples (K 22, K 69, K 80, K 121, K 149).257 Unfortunately, not many are actually preserved, and only 33 examples have been kept and catalogued. Seiradaki illustrated 23 types, but not one of these could be located, and they may have been discarded on the site. Three nearly complete pithoi were illustrated in photographs, but none of them was found in the museum.258 All of the fragments illustrated on pi. 12a were located and catalogued. Thus, what is presented here is only a small percentage of the actual pithoi, although perhaps representative of the total in terms of fabrics, shapes, and decoration. Seiradaki distinguished twenty-three types on the basis of rim profiles. She indicated that the rim of Type 8 (a simple rounded rim) was the most common, followed by 1, 2, 3, 5, and 14. Types 4, 11, 16, 19, and 20 were rare. Types of pithoi were recorded in the 1939 notebook.259 Pithoi are always in coarse fabrics. There are few whole shapes preserved.

K26.14 can be reconstructed and is similar to the example from K 96 published by Seiradaki.260 There are at least two pithoi that might be restorable, K.53 (in boxes numbered 10 and 57), the other K.62 (in the box numbered 7), probably those mentioned by Seiradaki.261 The rim and base of K9.ll are preserved, as is the case with another from an unknown context (K.63). The base and many body fragments of K36.2 are preserved. A number of rims come from identifiable contexts, including K22.13, K23.32, K24.2, K55.3, and MK.3. Other preserved rims have no identifying numbers (K.54-63). Very few of the preserved pithos rims correspond to the 23 different types published by Seiradaki; K.57 resembles Type 19, K.59 may be Type 7, K55.3 is Seiradaki's pithoid jar Type 2. The few preserved bases are all flat (K.53), some with a ledge (K9.ll, K26.14, K.63), or bevelling (K36.2). Base diameters range from 23 to 42, but come in both small varieties (K9.ll, K26.14) and large (K36.2, K.63). K.53 has a hole through the walls close to the base, pierced from the outside in. Few pithoi are sufficiently preserved to show their general shape. Those illustrated by Seiradaki would fall into several different categories. The pithos from K 80 is a piriform shape with a wide mouth and low collar common in LM III.262 The pithos from K 147 is ovoid in shape, similar to Christakis Form 43,263 Finally, the smaller pithos from K 96 is globular, with a narrow mouth and high collar, similar to Christakis Form 52 of LM IIIB/C date.264 K26.14, the only preserved pithos that can be completely restored on paper, is a piriform pithos with narrow mouth and high collar.265 The preserved pithoi nearly always have restricted mouths and a neck or collar. In general, the smaller pithoi have taller necks. Smaller pithoi have rim diameters that range from 23-35, while the larger varieties run from 36 to 54 in rim diameter, and according to Seiradaki are 75-125 in height.266 Handles are most often vertical and round, attached at the ridge below the rim and on the shoulder. Two preserved examples (K26.14, K.54) have round horizontal handles attached below the rim at or below the ridge. The handles, whether vertical or horizontal, often have dints at the attachments (K9.ll, K26.14). Rim profiles vary greatly, and no two are exactly alike. The rims fall into three basic groups: rims that are rolled and thickened outward (K9.ll, K23.32, K.53, K.58), rims that are flattened on top and thickened outward (K22.13, K24.2, K.55, K.56, K.57, K.61, K.63), sometimes with a groove or indentation on the rim (K.62), and rims that are flattened, thickened outward, and undercut (K55.3, MK.3, K.60). Pithoi are elaborately decorated, almost always with incised motifs on horizontal raised bands that run horizontally around the surface of the vessel. These bands were functional, added to strengthen the joint between sections of the pithos that were made separately. Sometimes the pithos breaks at one of these joints, revealing the scoring that the potter made to piece them together; an example of this technique can be seen on Seiradaki pi. 12b, bottom left. This technique has also been observed on pithoi from the LM IIIC settlement at Kavousi-Fr&lt;Wa.267 Often a single pithos will have more than one decoration. The most common decoration on the bands is the incised chevron (K37.3, K149.25).268 On larger vessels, the chevron band is accompanied by a rope slashed serpentine moulding that undulates between the applied bands, as on K37.3, MK.3, and K.53 and the two missing pithoi shown by Seiradaki.269 Other decorations on horizontal bands are less common. At least five preserved examples have impressed circles (K115.19, K124.10, MK.3), probably made with a reed.270 One example has bands with impressed circles and oblique slashes (K69.3), like a pithos from the west magazines at Knossos.271 K112.5 has a similar combination of oblique slashes, but with finger impressions. A unique example of impressed circles with incised triangles occurs on K83.4, and another is listed in the notebook from K 149. Several examples were decorated with an incised X-pattern (K7.5; examples recorded in the notebook from K 12, K 101, and K 149).272 The notebook also mentions examples of vertical slashes from K 2, K 22, and K 101, and two 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 Type 18: K 96, K 101 K 106, K 112, K 121.

Ridges below the rim are often decorated with rope slashing (K26.14)276 or finger impressions (K9.ll, K24.2, K.53, K.55; also K 16, K 18, K 22, K 33, K 27). Finally, several examples are decorated with bosses, either plain (K.64) or with an incised X (K80.10, K110.18), but not enough is preserved to determine what part of the vessel these bosses decorated. One rim (Type 19) was mentioned by Seiradaki277 as having a chevron pattern on the outer edge, but generally the rims were left plain. Pithoi were certainly used for storage, probably of all sorts of material, including foods, liquids, and cloth,278 but without organic residue analysis we cannot be certain about their contents. The hole in K.53 suggests that liquid was stored within; perhaps it served as a drain hole to empty out the vessel, like a pithos from Building B at Kavousi-Vronda, which also has a hole in the base.279 The sizes and shapes (i.e. height or whether the mouth is restricted or open) may have also had a functional differentiation; small pithoi (like K26.14) were the most accessible, while the tall pithoi with narrow mouths were less so.280 Many of the pithoi found in the settlement may have had a secondary usage, rather than representing storage at the end of the site's use. The upper portions of broken pithoi might have been reused as chimney pots, as was probably the case at Kavousi-Frorcda,281 and the bottoms as basins or watering troughs for animals, as 273 Christakis 2005, 27-8, figs. 34-7, Bands 1-8. 274 Christakis 2005, 28, fig. 38, Bands 25-28. 275 Christakis 2005, 30, pi. 19d, Group 12. 276 The notebook lists K1, K 2-7, K 14, K 16-7, K 57, K 80, K 101. 277 Seiradaki, 4. 278 In traditional field houses in eastern Crete pithoi are used to store anything that rats and other small rodents might get at, so old clothing and bee-keeping equipment are stored in large pithoi, as well as wine; Christakis 2005, 64-7. 279 Kavousi IIA, 53, 56, fig. 40. 280 Christakis 2005, 47-8. 281 Day, Glowacki and Klein 2009, 81, 83.</page><page sequence="321">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION suggested by Pendlebury for a base from the buildings on Mikre Koprana.282 Hence, calculations of the amount of storage in the rooms and houses at Karphi, such as those by Nowicki, may not be entirely accurate.283 Without more information on the percentage of nearly complete vessels as opposed to fragments or reused segments, it is impossible to know if a pithos was in use in the room at the time of abandonment or whether there were only fragments from earlier usage or secondary use. Pithoi are common at all LM IIIC sites, but there is not yet an established typology of the shapes or decorations. Most existing typologies, like that of Seiradaki at Karphi284 and that at Khania,285 distinguish the types on the basis of rim profiles, in the absence of large numbers of nearly complete vessels. Rim profiles, however, vary greatly; at Karphi no two are exactly alike. Decoration may be a clearer indicator of LM IIIC date; at Kavousi -Vronda, nearly all of the pithoi were decorated with bands, usually with incised chevron motifs, but occasionally with vertical incisions, impressed circles, or finger impressions.286 The use of chevron bands seems to be ubiquitous in all LM IIIC sites uncovered so far. Rhyton (FIG. 9.27) The rhyton is not a common form at Karphi, and only four definite examples are known. Three different types are represented: the conical rhyton (K123.1), the piriform rhyton with human head (two examples: K27.3, Ml 1.1), and a fantastic composite vessel of a cart or chariot decorated with bulls' heads (not catalogued). The conical rhyton K123.1 was thought by Seiradaki to be an heirloom brought by the first settlers to the site, since it is so unusual but of local clay287 Although this piece does look early, it does not necessarily date to LM IIIB;288 a similar conical rhyton was found at Kastelli Pediada of LM IIIC date.289 The piriform rhyton is represented by an unusual example from K 27 (K27.3). It has a human head as its top, and three handles. The base is missing. The decoration, with its fringed spiraliform motifs and hatched triangles, is certainly LM IIIC. The shape of the body, but not the head, finds a close parallel from Kavousi- Vronda, of LM IIIC date.290 A similar head, probably from another rhyton comes from one of the Ta Mnemata tombs (Ml 1.1). K 27 produced a second rhyton, an elaborate composite vessel that depicts a three-wheeled cart or chariot with three bulls' heads on the front and surmounted by a human figure that is driving. It is most likely that the bulls' heads are meant to suggest an ox drawn cart, and the vessel is extremely elaborate.291 There is another possible rim fragment of a conical rhyton from K 23 (K23.16); the unusual rim finds a parallel at Kommos, which is similar in size.292 A fragment of a fine, thin-walled vessel with a human face was found from K79-89 (K79-89.29), and it may come from a rhyton in the shape of a human head. Only a small fragment survives from the side of the head, preserving the ear in low relief. In front of the ear is a painted decoration of oblique strokes that may represent hair. It is too fine and thin-walled to be the head of a goddess figure, and is more likely to be from a head rhyton, like the one from Phaistos.293 It also resembles head vases from Gortyn and Moires;294 all are of LMIIIC-SM date, and possibly the type was manufactured in the Mesara.295 The most recent study of rhyta suggests that they were ritual vessels used for pouring libations, even into the LM IIIC period.296 They occur rarely in LM IIIC deposits in comparison to the large numbers known from earlier Minoan and Mycenaean contexts. Few of the palatial rhyta, however, were as large and elaborate as the ox-drawn chariot from K 27, a fact that suggests that the ceremony involving the rhyta may have been more public and more meant to impress with elaborate display than was the case in earlier periods. Bird vase (FIG. 9.27) Bird vases are rare at Karphi, and in all but one case very fragmentary. There are two types. One is more naturalistic, decorated to imitate a real bird, with wings indicated, and is usually in LM III style; this type was found in the settlement. The other is the more common SM to PG type found only at Ta Mnemata (Ml 1.2). There were two fragments of the LM III type catalogued from the settlement (K28.4, K91.5), and two more mentioned in the notebook or publication (K 115, K 130). K28.4 may have been a rhyton, but since only a large fragment from the body is preserved, it is difficult to tell. It has wings indicated by an oval with wavy lines, and curvilinear lines with short strokes between them to indicate feathers. K91.5 has wavy strokes between parallel lines. These pieces are irregular in shape, so they could not have come from stirrup jars, which they otherwise resemble. K91.5 has an attachment for the foot. They may also be hollow bird figurines, which appear in the middle and last 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 Karphi, 69. Nowicki 1999. Seiradaki, 3. Hallager 2000, 24-7.

The second type of bird vase is more familiar from SM and PG tombs, and published by Desborough as Type II.299 It has three small legs, a spout like a stirrup jar, and a basket handle, and it is decorated with alternating hatched triangles, like examples from Axos 297 Lemos 1994, 229. 298 Kanta 1980,44, fig. 11.4; Stampolides and Karetsou 1998,77 no. 46. 299 Desborough 1972.</page><page sequence="323">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION and Khamaizi-PAa/si of SM date.300 The function of these bird vases is uncertain, but the later type is regularly found in tomb deposits. Ring vase (FIG. 9.27) There is a single example of a ring base (K108.6). This is a squared tube with a round basket handle on top. It has painted decoration, which is too fragmentary to determine. Ring vases were never common, but appeared more often in mainland contexts than Cretan ones; on the mainland they were popular in LH IIIC. The type with a square profile seems to be Cretan, and examples can be found in LMIIIB contexts at Mallia, Kavousi-Khordakia, and Kalo Khorio-Gow/a.30 Kanta suggests that the Mallia example may be LM IIIC in date.302 The function of these vases is uncertain. Tripod Only one fine tripod vessel (K48.6) was found and it is fragmentary, preserving an elliptical leg and part of the flat base. K48.6 is decorated; it has a dint at the top of the leg, with a painted loop around it and bands above. A medium-coarse tripod vessel (K104.1) is similar. It has a flat base and short elliptical leg. It was turned a grey colour by smoke or burning, and there is trace of painted decoration, possibly light on dark. The function of these vessels is uncertain. Cylindrical stand and snake tube (fig. 9.28) There are a number of cylindrical stands from Karphi, including the tall cylindrical stands with vertical handles on the sides known as snake tubes;303 although no complete examples of snake tubes have been published from Karphi, many fragments exist. This category also includes fenestrated cylindrical stands. Stands are open on both top and bottom. They generally, but not always, have a rim slightly smaller than the base. Bases are bevelled or squared, and there is often a ledge on the interior that has the effect of making the base wider and hence steadier. A ridge or ridges often appear just below the rim, and the rim is flattened on top and thickened outwardly. Stands at Karphi do not usually have painted decoration. There are several fragments of cylindrical stands in fine wares. One (K.33) is possibly a snake tube, as it has vertical round handles on the sides toward the bottom. The lower part of the cylinder is ribbed with three ridges above a bevelled base that has a small ledge around the interior; unfortunately, the top is missing. Fragments of a cylindrical stand made out of fine buff ware were also found among the material from the Temple, but were not restored. In coarse wares, the only nearly complete cylindrical stand is K58.4, and it is an unusual example, as it has two round horizontal handles set midway up the body, rather than multiple vertical handles. K1.15 has a simpler base, and K1.14 has a plain rim or base. Fragments from an uncertain context (K.50) show the attachments for handles. Other fragments were found in Κ 1, the dump outside Κ 1, outside Κ 40-41, Κ 16 17, Κ 70, Κ 79, and possibly Κ 7 and Κ 87. Fenestrated stands are rare at Karphi and other LM IIIC sites, although they are found in abundance at Kavousi-Vronda.204 The best and only certain example comes from Ta Mnemata tomb 8 (M8.4), and it has no known parallels. The base has three steps, and the body is shaped rather like an hourglass, with triangular cutouts in two rows; the lower row has upright triangles, the upper has pendent triangles. The vessel has a rounded shoulder with three ridges, and a sharply out turned rim. It is monochrome painted. An unusual rim or base fragment from Κ 106 and Κ 115 (K106.21) may be from a similar fenestrated stand; with a diameter of 28, it would have been very large. Cylindrical stands were no doubt used to hold open vessels, both in domestic and in religious contexts, and snake tubes seem to have been purely ritual in function. It is likely that most of the examples from Karphi were used in religious observances, but few examples fit into the canonical category of snake tubes: a cylindrical stand with vertical handles up the side and often a ridged top. This may be due to the fact that few examples were nearly complete, and it may be because the stand fragments were not recognised and kept, except from the Temple. Square stand or altar (fig. 9.28) Square or rectangular stands are related to cylindrical stands, and probably served a similar function. There is only one coarse example known (K58.5). This stand is actually rectangular rather than square, and it has an oval opening in the base, with a ledge around on the inside. There is a ledge also on the exterior of the base, and immediately above the vertical elliptical handles begin to snake up the sides, much like a canonical snake tube; the top is missing. A fragment of a square tube from Κ 34 was also found in one of the boxes. The excavators identified the fine rectangular stand from Κ 57 as an altar. It is basically a square box with a round mouth set on top. It has fenestrations of different types and is also elaborately decorated with horns of consecration and alternating arcs, and it has small animal figurines on the shoulder.305 No other such elaborate stand has been found, but a fragment with an uncertain find spot may come from 300 Desborough 1972, 253, pl.

It has a base with a raised ledge, and the interior is uneven, like the base of K58.4. At the corner is a more or less square pillar with two cut-outs next to it, both of flat objects with horns of consecration on top; the second one is larger than the one toward the corner, and it is likely that there was a third smaller one next to the larger one for balance. It may represent a tripartite shrine on the base of a square stand. The use of the horns of consecration suggests a ritual function. A similar square fenestrated stand without the horns of consecration came from the shrine at Vasiliki -Kephala.306 A fragment of a possible fine fenestrated stand was found in one of the megaron houses of the Eastern Quarter (K140.2). This is a flat, rectangular object finished on both ends and with a slight curve to it. It may have been between the fenestrations on a stand of the sort that is found on other LMIIIC sites, especially Kavousi- Vronda. Finally, fragments of another object may be from an altar or stand from K 85 (plate 9 h). There are several fragments from the corner of a rectangular open stand, and they are decorated with punctuated designs. A similar object with incisions, rather than punctuated decoration, came from the shrine at Khalasmenos.307 Plaque (Pinax) There are many fragments of plaques from Karphi, and while the majority of these are coarse, a few fine examples do exist.308 One plaque from the Temple is flat, but has a human head on the top.309 K17.20 is a fragment of a fine plaque with a raised edge around it. Three non-joining fragments possibly of the same plaque were found in one of the boxes, but without any label (PLATE 28 c). These were of fine buff clay with a creamy slip and traces of paint, and they had plastic decoration with punctuated and incised decoration; it is difficult to make out the design, but it may be an animal. These fragments were similar to others of a coarser fabric probably from the Northern Shelters (K104.2) with painted reliefs of bovine hoofs and legs. Only one example of a coarse plaque still has paint preserved, and the decoration is not clear (K.51); the fragment is from the centre of the plaque and has oblique lines and rows of dots in black paint. Decorated plaques are rare, but other examples with relief decoration do exist; a plaque from Kannia has two sphinxes on either side of a palm tree,310 plaques from Kavousi- Vronda and Mathia have depictions of the goddess with upraised arms.311 Painted plaques are not often found, but the painted decoration may have worn off or come off when the sediment was removed, as is often the case with LM IIIC pottery in eastern Crete. Plaques are common, but few of the extant examples are labelled, and it is impossible to know where they were found. It is likely that they came from the Temple or other ritual places, where we know plaques were found, but they may not all be from religious contexts. Where the find spots are known, plaques came from rooms identified as shrines, usually accompanying figures of goddesses (K 1), or from dumps that lay below buildings and streets (K 17 lower deposit, K 32, K 70, K 72, K 76). Only one (K2.13) is known to come from a non-ritual context. Elsewhere on Crete, plaques accompanied terracotta figures of goddesses with upraised arms; they were found at Kannia, Kavousi-Frowda, Khalasmenos, and Vasiliki -Kephala?n Larnax At least two larnakes were found in the settlement at Karphi, although not recognised in the publication. K29.17 was published as a pithoid jar rim,313 the other (K81-82.1) was identified as ajar.314 K29.17 is better preserved and finds more close parallels. The curve of the rim suggests that it was a bathtub larnax, as does the decoration. The excavators could not have seen the decoration, since the surface was left heavily coated and the decoration was revealed only by careful cleaning. It is difficult to find parallels for the rim 306 Eliopoulos 2004, 87, fig. 6.8. 307 Tsipopoulou, 2001, 101, pi. 28e. 308 One box of plaques from the storerooms of the Herakleion Museum contained fragments without identifying numbers. There was a fine thin plaque with a white slip (10YR 8/4) and a wide flat edge, 1.8 wide. The corner of another fine another plaque from K 76 was not catalogued. This was of very soft fabric, 7.5 YR 7/6, and it was 2.2 thick, except around the raised edges, where it was 3.3. The ledge around the edge was 1.9 wide. Medium-coarse and coarse plaques included the following: two fragments of a medium-coarse to coarse reddish yellow fabric (5 YR 7/8) with very pale brown slip (10 YR 8/4), 1.2-1.8 thick; three fragments of flat coarse plaques (2.5YR 6/8) with almost no edge; five fragments of 'oatmeal' fabric, with at least two and possibly three holes pierced in them; and two fragments of another coarse plaque. Finally, there was another fragment of a fabric like K104.2. Another unlabelled box in the museum contained much ritual material, including three plaques. One came from K 70; it was a rounded corner, 1.9 thick, with a wide flat ledge, 2.5 wide. It was made of coarse fabric, 5YR 6/8, with hard black and white and gold mica inclusions. Another from K 72 was also a corner, also 1.9 thick, with a narrower edge (1.8) and made from a very coarse fabric, 5YR 6/6 in colour, with large schist inclusions (2-4 mm). Another corner from a plaque from K 32 had a large hole pierced through it. Finally, there was a very coarse red plaque (10R 5/6) with frequent large schist inclusions that had a narrow flat edge 1.2 wide. 309 Karphi, pi. 35.1; Gesell 2001, pi. 84a-b. 310 Gesell 1985, pi. 108. 311 Gesell 2001, pi. 82b-c (Kavousi-Vronda), pi. 84c-d (Mathia). 312 Gesell 1985,77; 2004; Tsipopoulou 2001,101, pi. 28c; 2009, 128-9, figs 11.16-18; Eliopoulos 2004, 87, fig. 6.9. 313 Seiradaki, fig. 2.1. 314 Seiradaki, fig. 3.9.</page><page sequence="326">POTTERY ANALYSIS profile, since few published larnakes are shown with profiles. The fish decoration on the interior, however, is common and finds close parallels on LM IIIB/C larnakes from other east Cretan sites at Piskokephalo, Tourtouli, Pacheia Ammos, and Vmisos-Papoures,315 The LM MB larnax from Pacheia Ammos has the same sort of rendering of the fish, with gills indicated and several 'fins' on top, but it lacks the wavy lines on the body. Watrous has suggested that bathtubs decorated with fish served a domestic function, and the context of this example in a room and a building that has little but domestic material seems to fit.316 The other larnax (K81-82.1) has a strange angular profile that is too poorly preserved to determine its shape or decoration. It is likely to have been a bathtub larnax as well, and the wavy line on the exterior suggests that it may have been decorated with an octopus. Fragments of larnakes were also found in the Ta Mnemata tombs. A bathtub larnax is reported from Ml, and fragments of larnakes were found outside M4 and outside M5 and 6. Others may have existed in both tombs and settlement, but the fragments were not recognised, since they are easily mistaken for pithoi. Other utilitarian or industrial shapes Drain tile A single fragment of a drain tile was found among the Karphi pottery (K47.6). It is a short (6.8 in height) probably U-shaped coarse vessel and is similar to examples found at Kavousi-Vronda and Kastri;317 at both those sites, however, the drain tiles are dated to LM I. Other examples of drain tiles appear in MM deposits at Kavousi- Vronda?18 Drain tiles were used to drain liquids and channel them from one place to another, but there is no indication of how extensive this channelling might have been. It has been suggested that drain tiles were used to take water run off from a flat roof so that it was directed out beyond the wall,319 and they may have carried water through a parapet arrangement.320 Firebox Only a single example exists of the shape known as an incense burner, censor, brazier or firebox.321 This is a fragment from the perforated bottom of a capsule made out of cooking pot fabric from K110 (K110.17). The vessel is blackened from fire on the interior and much of the exterior, and it is burned all the way through. This example fits into Georgiou's Type I,322 a type that was in use from the MM III-LM LA. through LM III periods, although it does appear as early as the EBA.323 Fireboxes, however, are not common on LM IIIC sites. This example from the bottom of the vessel has a larger central hole with smaller holes pierced all around it. Georgiou suggested that these vessels were used in heating volatile ingredients in the production of aromatics.324 This being the only known example from Karphi, it is possible that it was an antique or that the production of aromatics was very limited. Miscellaneous shapes There are several pieces of unknown shape that do not fit into any of the above categories. A lug handle from K 31 (K31.16) is squared at the end and pierced an otherwise unknown shape and piercing. It could come from a tray or a scuttle, but there are no known parallels at Karphi or elsewhere. Finally, there is a body fragment from K 88 (K88.2) that has knobs all over the surface. It is coarse, with schist inclusions, but it is slipped. In decoration it is like the fine bowl from unknown context (K.12). Cooking Pottery There are six basic shapes in cooking pottery: cooking dishes, trays, jugs, tripod cooking pots, lids, and baking slabs; a few other unusual coarse shapes with evidence for burning are included here as well. All cooking vessels are distinguished by their coarse fabrics and their heavy burning. Cooking dishes are the most ubiquitous form, although few nearly complete examples have been found. Tripod cooking pots are almost as plentiful, easily recognisable from their legs, and cooking mugs and trays are less common. Coarse lids that show evidence of burning also may have been used in cooking. Apparently missing from the Karphi assemblage but common on LM IIIC sites elsewhere are what have been termed cooking jars or amphoras, that is — cooking pots without legs.325 One example of a cooking jar may be K23.31, Seiradaki's example of a Type 1 jar, which is made out of cooking ware fabric and shows burning; it is, however, much larger than usual for such cooking jars. Other cooking jars may have been recorded simply as jars and discarded. Cooking dish (FIG. 9.29) Seiradaki included in the category of dishes all vessels whose height is less than one-third of their diameter;326 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 Kanta 1980, 177, fig. 66.1-2; 178-9, fig. 65.3^4; 144, fig. 56, 3-4; 182, fig. 73.10.

Cooking dishes, trays, and tripod trays. Scale 1:4.</page><page sequence="328">POTTERY ANALYSIS her definition covers shapes distinguished here as dishes, trays, and even a basin. There has been some confusion about the different types of trays and dishes, but the publication of LMIIIC sites has helped to refine the distinctions.327 Cooking dishes have thin rounded bottoms, without base or legs, thickened rims that are nearly vertical to flaring with a sharp demarcation between base and rim, and roughened bottoms.328 The bottoms are nearly always missing, probably because they were burned away during use. In Seiradaki's typology, only Type 6 can be identified as a cooking dish. Types 1, 3,4, 5, and 7 are actually cooking trays, while Type 8 is a fine tray; Type 2 may be a basin, but it was not located and so it is uncertain. Cooking dishes are very common at Karphi and are easily recognisable. They were found in nearly every room, and none was associated with the tombs.329 While dishes are common, they are rarely found complete, and the bases are never preserved. One published example preserving about half the vessel from K 75 was not located.330 Another large fragment came from the Temple (K1.16). The rim of this vessel had been pulled out during manufacture, as had also rim fragments K3.14 and K18.2; two other examples (K2.6, K20.1) had small spouts created by pinching in a section of the rim. Several fragments were pierced (K2.6, K23.25). Rims can be short (K17.28, K108.8) or tall (K.49), and the angle can go from nearly vertical (K20.1, K23.25) to flaring (K2.6, K18.2, K17.29, K.49), sometimes on the same vessel (K1.16, K2.6, K3.14, K 75). Cooking dishes are very large; rim diameters range from 40 to 52, while the rims vary from 2.5-6.8 in height. Cooking dishes are always made of very coarse fabrics that were meant to withstand the heat of the fire and extreme and sudden changes in temperature. These vessels were clearly used for cooking, as nearly all of them show extensive burning, usually on the exterior (K1.16, K2.6, K3.14, K17.28, K23.25, K18.2, K.49); they are almost never burned on the interior, so most could not have held burning coals for roasting meat, as Seiradaki suggested.331 Probably these dishes were set directly in the fire, with the rounded bottoms resting in the coals. They could be used like a modern wok for frying.332 If a large domed lid or another cooking dish was placed on top of them, they could become small ovens;333 the few cooking dishes that are not burned (K17.29, K20.1, K108.8) may have functioned as lids in this way, and perhaps Seiradaki's missing Type 2 from K 80 was this sort of lid since it closely resembles an example from Kavousi-Xastro.334 Mook has also suggested that dishes may have been turned upside-down and the rounded surface used as a griddle.335 The creation of outward pouring spouts, as well as the pinched-in spouts suggests that these vessels were used for cooking liquids, but they may have served other functions; folding the rim inward may have provided a convenient lifting device.336 The holes pierced in some examples could have been for emptying the vessels or for pouring off liquids, but they may also have been used to hold rods to suspend the pot above the fire,337 although in that case there should be more than one hole; unfortunately, these vessels are so poorly preserved that it is impossible to tell how many holes a single vessel had. A significant feature of the cooking dishes is size; they were extremely large, either for cooking large portions of food, or to create an extensive work surface for cooking different portions of the food under different conditions or at different times. Cooking tray (FIG. 9.29) Trays are shallower than dishes and have thick, flat bases and vertical or flaring rims. They are not as common as cooking dishes, but they appear frequently in the settlement, and they are easily recognisable. Usually a full profile is preserved. In Seiradaki's typology of dishes, there are five coarse trays: Types 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7. Type 1 is wide, with a vertical pointed rim and a large lug on the side; the published example from K 149 was not found but it seems to be similar to a tray from Khania.338 Types 3, 4, and 5 vary only in the angle of the sides, but the most frequent is the slightly flared Type 4, which often has finger impressions on the rim and sometimes has horizontal handles. There was only a single example of Type 7, which had the top of its rim incised. The surviving examples of trays fall into these types, and they can either have flat bases or be placed on tripod legs (Seiradaki's Tripod Type 4). There are no certain extant examples of Type 1, although K1.19 and K17.30 327 Betancourt 1980; Borgna 1997a; Mook 1999; Hallager 2000, 160; Day et al. forthcoming. 328 Mook 1999, 503. 329 Dishes of Type 6 are recorded in the notebook from the following rooms: K 16, K 24 (6), K 58 (several), K 70, K 72, K 73 (many), K 74, K 75, K 79-89, K 80 (several), K 83, K 84, K 85, K 86, K 87, K 88, K 91 (several), K 93, K 94 (several), K 97, K 98, K 101, K 102 (several), K 106 (several), K 107 (2), K 108 (3), K 109, K 112, K 115, K 118 (3), K 119, K 121 (several), K 124 (3), K 125 (several), K 127 (2), K 129 (many), K 132 (3), K 135, K 136 (2), K 138 (3), K 139, (4) K 143 (4), K 147 (8), K 148, and K 149 (12). 330 Seiradaki, pi. 2g. 331 Seiradaki, 9.

Cooking jugs. Scale 1:4. may be of this type.339 Type 3, with its very vertical sides, is represented by the flat-based varieties K1.18, K19.3, K79.6, K85.ll, K106.23, K112.2); many of the tripod trays have similar profiles (K21.3, K45.7, K79.7, K79.8, K106.24).340 Type 4, with more flaring sides, is represented by K17.30, K19.2, K31.14, and K112.3, and the notebook adds examples from K 72 and K 75. There are no preserved trays of Type 5, but the notebook records one each from K 97 and K 136 and six from K 149. Similarly, the illustrated example of Type 7 from K 113 was not located, nor were any fragments of this shape recognised in the extant material; the notebook lists two more from K 61 and K 96. Another type, rather like Type 7 was found in K 85 (K85.12), but this has been classed with trays (see above, p. 280). Seiradaki's tripod Type 4 was actually a tray. The illustrated example from K 31 was not located, but many others were found (K21.3, K45.7, K79.7, K79.8, K106.24); other examples listed in the notebook came from K 10, K 21, K 77, and K 106 (3). Trays are very shallow; their height varies from 3 5, with the majority being 3.5-4.5. They are very wide, from 30-50 in diameter, the majority 30—40. Trays of Types 3 and 4, whether tripods or flat-based, often have finger impressions on the rim (K19.2, K21.3, K31.14, K45.7, K79.7, K106.23, K112.3) or have lugs (K1.19, K79.6, K79.8, K85.ll). One unusual example (K1.17) has incised oblique lines on the rim. The tripod trays have legs that are round (K21.3, K79.7) or elliptical (K106.24) and are often decorated with vertical slashes (K79.7, K106.24) or a dint and oblique slashes forming a V-pattern (K21.3). The preserved fragments show no traces of exposure to fire, with the exception of K45.7, which is burned on rim and base inside and out. This lack of burning seems unusual, as other tripod cooking pots are clearly used over open fires. Trays without tripod legs show more frequent burning (K17.30, K31.14, K79.6, K106.23, K112.2), generally on the exterior. These trays could not have been used to hold burning coals over which spitted meat was placed, for they do not often show burning or discolouration from fire on the interior. They are more likely to have served for warming near the fires or for presentation. Cooking trays are common in LM IIIC sites in all phases of the period. They appear at Khania, Khamalevri, Sybrita/Thronos, Kastrokephala, Phaistos, Kavousi-Vronda, Kavousi-ATastro, Khalasmenos, and Kastri.341 Whatever their function(s), they seem to have served as a regular part of the kitchen equipment throughout the period. Cooking jug (FIG. 9.30) Seiradaki's Type 8 jug is a cooking jug. This shape resembles a large cup, with wide, flat base and a collared globular body, with the rim often pinched out opposite the handle to form a spout. A single vertical handle runs from rim to shoulder. There are two different types, one with a flaring rim (K1.20, K2.7, K11.10, K114.10, K.48) and one with a narrower mouth and a collar (K11.9, K47.5, K61.14, MK.5). The type with the flaring rim is the one illustrated in Seiradaki's typology from K 148, and it was not located. One example from an unknown context (K.47) is small and shaped more like a cup; it lacks the pinched out spout, but it was clearly used in the fire and probably belongs in this category; it is similar to a shape which is called a 'dipper' at Phaistos.342 In all these shapes, the rim and base diameters are nearly the same; the ratio of the rim to base varies from 1:1.1 to 1:1.5 and so does the ratio 339 The notebook records many examples of Type 1 from the following locations: K 84, K 87, K 101, K 102, K 107 (2), K 108, K 109, K 112, K 118(2), K 119, K 121 (2), K 124, K 125, K 127 (2), K 139 (3), K 143 (5), K 147 (3), K 149 (3). 340 Other examples of Type 3 mentioned in the notebook came from K 67 and K 150. 341 Hallager 2000, 160-l(Khania); Andreadaki-Vlasaki and Papadopoulou 2005, 388; 2007, 33, 37 (Khamalevri); D'Agata 2002, 54, fig. 5 (Sybrita/Thronos); Kanta and Karetsou 2003, 159, fig. 10 (Kastrokephala); Borgna 19976, 193, fig. 5 (Phaistos); Day et al. forthcoming (Kavousi Vronda); Mook 1999, 503 (Kavousi-ATasfro); Yasur-Landau 2006, 54-5 (Khalasmenos); Kastri, 285, 290, fig. llm-o. 342 Borgna 1997b, 193, 197, fig. 7.</page><page sequence="330">POTTERY ANALYSIS of the rim diameter to the height. The bases are generally flat (K1.20, K47.5, K114.10, MK.5) and occasionally slightly concave underneath (K2.7, K61.4, K.48). The bodies can be shallower (K2.7, K.48) or deep. Handles are almost always elliptical in shape, although K61.4 has an almost round handle. Nearly all of the identified examples show heavy and extensive burning, both on the interior and exterior. On one example (K114.10) the entire surface is burned except for the area around the handle. It looks as though cooking jugs were placed directly onto an open fire, possibly to heat water or other liquids. The fact that they were burned on the interior suggests that something other than water was heated in them and that often that liquid material burned. Cooking jugs have not been identified at many LM IIIC sites, but they do occur in some quantity at Kavousi.343 Tripod cooking pot (FIG. 9.31) The most common cooking vessel was the tripod cooking pot. Seiradaki was not certain that these tripods were used for cooking, since she saw little evidence for burning on the legs of the pots.344 She distinguished seven types, but some of them are not standard tripod cooking pots. Type 4 is a tripod tray and was discussed above (p. 318), and Type 7 is a multiple vessel from K150 that is the only one of its kind; it will be discussed separately (see below, p. 320). Although Types 5 and 6 are not illustrated on the figure of tripod types, Type 5 is described as looking like krater type 4 (K23.10), but shallower and with a rounded base. According to the publication, tripods of this type had square legs, and the type is only represented by the leg K106.26; Seiradaki thought it derived from metal prototypes.345 Type 6 is a tripod jar; three examples from K 43, K 80, and K 137 were illustrated in photos, but not found at the time of publication or drawn.346 The type is essentially ajar with narrow neck resting on tripod legs. The examples from K 43 and possibly K 80 have painted decoration. K27.7 may be of this type as well and may be deeper than has been restored. Like the tripod from K 137, it has slashes on the round legs.347 Seiradaki stated that Types 1-3 occurred most often and with almost equal frequency. Type 1 is a standard LM IIIC cooking pot, with round legs, deep body with collared neck and round horizontal handles below the neck. Belonging to Betancourt's Type A, it is found in nearly every LM IIIC site.348 Five examples are preserved (K14.2, K26.ll, K26.12, K61.15, K106.25), and the notebook mentions others from K 33 (2), K 82, K 83, K 119, K 138, and K 147. The tripods of this type are usually large, with rim diameters of about 17-19, although they can be as small as 11 and as large as 22. The legs can be vertical or flare out slightly. The Type 2 tripod is similar in shape, but has vertical rather than horizontal handles; one-handled (K1.22, K121.13, K121.14) and two-handled varieties (K23.26) both exist, and the handles run from rim to shoulder. The one-handled tripods of this type are generally smaller, with rim diameters from 6-10, while the two-handled variety is larger, with an average diameter of 20.349 Type 3 is a round-bottomed tripod vessel with vertical handles. The illustrated example from K 16 was not found but a shallower example came from K 68 (K68.14) and there are also fragments of round based tripods (K7.3, K30.1, K84.1).350 This may be the shape also that is referred to in the notebook as a tripod lebes. Tripods of this type are open, with very large diameters (35-48). Type 6 is a tripod pithos, illustrated by three photos in the publication, but these examples from K 137, K 80, and K 43 had already disappeared at the time of publication.351 In addition to Seiradaki's seven types, there are other shapes. The first is a tripod bowl, more like Betancourt's Type B tripod (K110.21). This has tall round legs, a shallow body, a flaring rim and two round horizontal handles below the rim. Another type is represented by the tripod vessel K1.21 that was categorised by Seiradaki as a Type 2 jar. This is a most unusual vessel; the scars on the edge of the base attest to the attachment of feet. It has three round vertical handles set on the shoulders instead of the usual two handles from rim to neck. It is the only example of this shape, and there are no close parallels.352 The one tripod from the Ta Mnemata tombs is also unusual (M2.1). It has very short legs that are elliptical in section, a globular body, and a wide short collar; round vertical handles alternate with round horizontal handles on the shoulder. No parallels have been found for this shape. Other tripods are known from fragments and may come from any of the above types, including rims K17.31-32 and legs K16-17.4, K17.9, and K140.3. With the exception of the octagonal leg K106.26, the elliptical leg K16-17.4, and the short legs on the M2.1, all of the tripod legs from Karphi cooking pots are round in section, whatever their type.

For a list of LM II1C sites that produced this kind of tripod, see Hallager 2000, 158, n. 224. 349 Other tripods of Type 2 were found in K 61, K 83, K 87 (2), K 102, K 132, K 133, K 138, and K 144. 350 According to the notebook, others were found in K 33 (2), K 72 (2), K 83, K 98, and K 99. 351 Seiradaki, 9 n. 15, pi. 2a, b, c. 352 Three-handled jars of this shape but without the legs are common in Neopalatial sites.

Often there are slashes instead of or in addition to the dint (K140.3, K16-17.4). In addition to the tripods catalogued and kept, the notebook mentions decoration on other tripod legs: dints on examples from K 8, K 12, K 59, incisions on those from K 8, K 79, and K 97. Tripod legs were set quite high on the vessel, except for M2.1, where they are small and set on the bottom. This technique of setting the legs higher on the vessel seems to appear in LM III and may have been learned from the mainland.355 Nearly all of the tripod cooking pots show evidence of burning, primarily on the exterior, but sometimes on the interior as well (K1.22, K7.3, K14.2). Sometimes the entire pot is quite thoroughly burned (K1.21, K7.3, K30.1, K61.15, K 106.26), at other times it is burned in patches (K1.22, K23.26, K26.12), and occasionally it shows no burning at all (K26.ll, K27.7). The different types of tripod cooking pots may indicate functional differences, different places of manufacture, or different dates. Borgna has suggested that the height of the collar on tripod cooking pots is a chronological indicator, the high flaring rim developing from the short everted rim, and this may be the case at Karphi.356 Although most of the rims are the tall flaring type, two rims from the lower deposit in K17 (K17.31, K17.32) have small everted rims. Otherwise, there seem to be no chronological distinctions among the various types, all three being found in deposits all over the site and in use when the settlement was abandoned. Likewise, there is no correlation between the fabrics used in the cooking pots and the type of cooking pot; all of the cooking pots appear in a variety of fabrics, so the people of Karphi do not seem to have imported a particular type of cooking pot from a single area. Potters in different communities in LM IIIC Crete were making a variety of cooking pots and were apparently exchanging them with other communities, whether in trade or accompanying exogamous marriages. It is possible that a particular type of cooking pot manu factured at one village was imitated in another. The round-bottomed Type 3 cooking pot has been seen as reflecting Mycenaean influence.357 Certainly this type is not common on Crete before LM III, and it is widely found in mainland contexts. The round bottomed tripod cooking pot does, however, already exist in Neopalatial contexts on Crete, such as Nerokourou.358 The fact that these Type 3 cooking pots have very wide mouths also suggests that there may be a functional reason for the rounded bottom.359 Like the position of the tripod feet, the use of round-bottomed cooking pots may have been introduced into Crete from the mainland, but for the feet this probably represents a technological innovation that was adopted because it produced a more functional product, and with the round-bottomed shape it may have to do with the type of food being cooked or the method of cooking. Round bottomed cooking pots do not indicate that Mycenaeans were living at Karphi any more than megaron-shaped houses do. The different types of tripod cooking pots probably represent what was needed for the household and might have included a smaller one-handled tripod, a deep Type 1 tripod and a round-bottomed tripod, along with the dishes, trays, jugs, and lids that made up a household assemblage. Only in two instances do we have very different types, one in the Temple, and one in Ta Mnemata 2, and these may have served special functions; the tomb tripod shows no trace of burning. K1.21 may have been given a special shape because it was used in the preparation of ritual meals or ritual substances. Cooking jar There are no certain examples preserved of the cooking jar or amphora shape that has been found on other LM IIIC sites, especially at Khania, Kavousi-Vronda, Khalasmenos, Kastri, Phaistos, and Khamalevri.360 Some might have existed, but from rim and body fragments it is impossible to distinguish these from tripods. Multiple vessel (FIG. 9.31) Seiradaki's Type 7 tripod is a unique multiple vessel represented by a single example (K150.5). It has small feet that are elliptical in section and a flat base. The outer walls are nearly vertical to a pointed rim, and there is a flattened round handle from rim to leg. Inside is a second vessel, with an incurving profile that rises above the rim of the outer side. Within this smaller bowl is a depression in the bottom. Seiradaki suggested that it might have been something like an EM or MM candlestick or a MM incense burner from Knossos.361 Its exact purpose is not clear, but the interior is entirely burned, and one side of the exterior, so it was obviously involved in cooking, burning of aromatics, or carrying of burning material. 354 Seiradaki, 7. 355 H.

Tripod cooking pots. Scale 1:4.</page><page sequence="333">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION Cooking slab There are four examples of what is termed a cooking or baking slab. Three of these came from the West Cliff Houses (K113.5, K126.1, K126.2), and the fourth (K.52) has no number on it and may belong to one of the other three. These objects are flat slabs of terracotta, 2-4.5 thick, rather like the plaques found in religious contexts, but coarser and thicker. One (K.52) has a ridge around the edge, while the others are simply flat, perhaps becoming slightly thicker at the edge. One has a hole pierced through it (K126.1). The bottoms are rough, as if made by pressing a slab of clay onto coarse fabric or smooth ground. None of them has been preserved in entirety, so we do not know their measure ments. All four are of cooking fabrics with schist or phyllites and quartzite. All show burning; two of them are burned in no discernable pattern, one (K.52) has a burned circular patch in the centre, and the last (K113.5) is entirely burned with a circular unburned patch in the centre (plate 21 c). These slabs may have been used like pizza bricks in an oven to give more diffuse heat, or they may have been used to seal up ovens or large cooking pots. They seem to be limited to a single complex on the northwest side of the settlement. Two fragments of flat slabs found with plaques in one of the museum boxes may also come from cooking slabs, as they were both very burned. There are no known parallels from LMIIIC, but in the Neopalatial artisan's quarters at Mochlos were found a number of 'work slabs' that appear to be similar. These are thought to have been used for metalworking, ceramic production, or food preparation.362 Stand A large slightly curving stand with a vertical round handle was found in the northern shelters (K107.10). It shows burning on the interior and may have functioned as a spit stand,363 or a stand for a cooking jar like those at Khania;364 it may also have been associated with some other industrial process. TERRACOTTA OBJECTS A number of objects found at Karphi were made out of terracotta but were not used as vessels for cooking, storing, or dining. There were many terracotta spindle whorls or beads found in the settlement, and some of these have been preserved. These were discussed in the publication, and nothing new is added here. There are several other objects of terracotta, however, that appeared in the boxes with the pottery, and these are discussed here. Potter's wheel A single fragment of a potter's wheel was found at Karphi (K127.7). This fragment comes from the rim of a large (D. 48) wheel, and it is pierced vertically just below the rim. The underside has a ridge that is decorated with incised strokes. It belongs to Evely's Type 3C, which is the most common kind of Cretan potter's wheel, although it is a bit larger than usual.365 Most of the examples of this type are Neopalatial in date, and there are few examples from LM IIIC.366Two fragments come from the LM IIIC levels at Khania, both of them of the same Type 3C.367 Loomweight Only a single loomweight was preserved in the boxes in the Herakleion Museum (K126.3). It is of an unusual size and pyramidal in shape, with a square base 9 on a side. It is shaped like an elongated pyramid and has a large hole pierced through the walls toward the short top. The shape is not well known on Crete, although examples do occur at Kavousi-Kastro of somewhat later date.368 Spool (TABLE 9.1) Spools were very common at Karphi, and a sample of them was saved. Since these spools were not described drawn, or photographed in the publication, the information about the surviving examples is given here. Three large and 20 small spools were preserved from Mikre Koprana IE, without specific room designation (plate 4 c). The large spools measure 5.6 in height and 4.3 at either end (3.3 in the middle); they weigh 50-100 g. The smaller spools are 4.1 in height and 3.3 at the ends (2.1 in the middle), and they weigh 20-50 g, the majority of them 30-40 g. Both large and small spools are of the same light reddish brown fabric (5YR 6/4) and all examples are burned on one side. None shows any signs of abrasion or wear. A number of spools were also preserved from the Southern Houses. Five spools came from K 44 (plate 15 c). They are all of the same size, approximately 2.8 high, with diameters at the ends of 2.7 and a diameter at the middle of 2.2. The weights are very close, ranging from 25-35 g. Their fabrics are not as uniform as those from MK1E; colour varies from pale red (10R 6/4) to reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6-5YR 6/8), and the pale red examples are the only ones that show signs of burning. K 27 also produced seven worn examples of similar shape, all burned, and weighing 50-75 g; a partial example weighed 40 g. Finally, Room K 46 produced two examples weighing 75 g (plate 5 c). 362 Soles (ed.) 2004, 24-7, fig. 7. 363 Hallager 2000, 162; Georgiou 1983, 78-80. 364 Khania II, pi. 77f. 365 Evely 1988, 100-6; 2000, 284-6. 366 Evely 1988, 101. 367 Bruun-Lundgren and Wiman 2000, 179-80. 368 Lee Ann Turner, personal communication.</page><page sequence="334">POTTERY ANALYSIS 323 Table 9.1: Concordance of spools.

These are made of a very coarse fabric that has been burned totally black over most of the surface. The Magazines also produced a few spools. From K 21 came two examples weighing 50 and 70 g. There were two spools from K 22 in different fabrics and with different shapes, both weighing 60 g. From the floor of K 23 came a single spool weighing 100 g and burned black.

Spools have been found in many LMIIIC sites, and they have been given various names. At Kastri they were called reels and were thought to be weights suspended by a string tied around the centre.369 At Khania they were termed bobbins and identified as the most common form of loomweight.370 Both the settlement and the ceremonial pits at Khamalevri produced examples, as did Khalasmenos, Phaistos, and Sybrita/Thronos.371 None, however, have been found at either of the Kavousi sites. Often they are said to be made of unfired clay; at Karphi they may originally have been of unfired clay, but all show signs of extensive burning that may have hardened and preserved them. The function of these spools is still a matter of some debate. Some have thought they might be gaming pieces to be used with kernos stones.372 At Knossos they were found on top of a kernos stone, and Warren suggested that they may have been used in the depressions of the kernos; the fact that this stone was a reused olive press, however, makes any ritual significance unlikely.373 They are more likely to have been used in weaving. Barber suggested that they were used with a small portable loom for producing bands or belts,374 and most scholars now accept spools as a form of loomweights. The origins of the spool are uncertain; spools seem to have been common in the EBA on the mainland and on Crete, but then disappeared until the end of the Bronze Age.375 Evely pointed out that spools seem to be a feature of LM IIIC sites, possibly part of a wider Aegean manifestation;376 indeed, such spools have been found not only in the Aegean, but on Cyprus and in Anatolia and the Levant.377 Their presence on Crete comes quite early in IIIC, and it is difficult to know if they originated on the island and spread throughout the eastern Mediterranean, or whether they came to Crete from elsewhere; Rahmstorf suggests that they appear earliest on Crete in LM IIIC, and that they may have spread from there to Cyprus.378 At any rate, spools suggest that Crete is part of a wider milieu in this period. If spools were indeed used as loomweights, then they seem to represent a new weaving technology introduced into the island in LM IIIC. At Karphi it is reasonable to suppose that the rooms with the larger numbers of spools probably held a loom. It is interesting to note that the weights of groups of spools seem to be so similar, as one would expect for a loom. 369 Kastri, 302, 305, fig. 19.46 and 50. 370 Bruun-Lundgren and Wiman 2000, 177. 371 Andreadaki-Vlasaki and Papadopoulou 2005, 359, 392, 389, fig. 54 (Khamalevri); Coulson and Tsipopoulou 1994 80, pi. 10.3 (Khalasmenos); Rahmstorf 2005, 149 (Phaistos and Sybrita/Thronos). 372 Hillbom 2005, 299-302. 373 Warren 1982-83, 73, fig. 58. 374 Barber 1997, 515-9. 375 Evely 2000, 502 for spools in EM Crete.

It is hoped that the presentation of this evidence will also lead to new interpretations of the site, and reconstructions of the life, society, economy, technology, and beliefs of the people of Karphi. A few ideas are suggested here. Although the material from Karphi has value in determining the dating of the rooms and suggesting the activities that went on in them, it must be recognised that there are limitations to the knowledge it can provide. The pottery and objects may not precisely reflect the whole assemblages that were being used by the inhabitants, because some material may have been removed when the inhabitants left the site, and post-abandonment depositional processes may also have resulted in the movement of some material.1 If the settlement was abandoned, rather than suffering a single calamity, the inhabitants may have taken with them portable items, and the rooms and buildings may have lain open for a long time before the roofs collapsed and the walls fell in covering what was left in the houses. Thus, the contents of the rooms do not represent all that was in use at the time of abandonment because some objects may have been moved, either by natural processes or human activity, and some material may already have been removed. In addition, so much of the pottery was discarded by the excavators, particularly the coarse wares, that the current view of the ceramic assemblages can give only an incomplete or partial reading of room contents. Even when the notebook gives the types of vessels represented, it does not always indicate whether the vessels were only fragments or were nearly complete, and what was recorded depended on the interests and observations of the ceramic specialist, often made without mending or even washing the pottery. Nevertheless, from what was kept and recorded we can get a picture, however incomplete, of the contents of the rooms and of the date of the material found in them. In this analysis, it is assumed that the sherd material probably reflects earlier usage: vessels that had been broken during the building's history and were ground into floors or pushed up against walls. Whole or nearly complete vessels are interpreted as having been in use at the time of abandonment. CHRONOLOGY AND PHASING OF KARPHI The study of the extant pottery by context from Karphi, taking into account more closely dated assemblages from recent excavations, now provides a clearer picture of the history of this settlement. Not all of the material recovered is of the same phase or period, as other scholars have noted. There is a considerable amount of early LMIIIC material and even some of LMIIIB style, a fact that indicates that the settlement was founded at the transition from LM IIIB to LM IIIC, when LM IIIB styles were still in use. Early LM IIIC material abounds throughout the site, generally in fragments, rather than whole vessels. This material is remarkably similar to that found on sites in western, central, and eastern Crete. Despite the fact that this period is usually regarded as marked by regionalism, with refuge settlements in nearly inaccessible locations developing independently and without contact with other communities,2 there is remarkable homogeneity in the pottery styles, a fact that suggests contact among the various communities on the island. Warren has postulated that the LM IIIC style originated in one place and spread, whether from a single site on Crete or, less likely, from the mainland.3 Once this style was established, it changed little over a long period of time, and it is difficult at this time to define a middle phase of LM IIIC. The majority of complete vessels belonged to LM IIIC late, and are similar to those found at Kavousi Vronda, Kavousi-Kastro, and Khalasmenos. As suggested by the geographic closeness of these sites, there seems to be little variation among them in terms of style, but the assemblages show preferences for different shapes; the pyxis, for example, is common at Karphi but not elsewhere, while the fenestrated stand is popular at Kavousi- Vronda, but not at other sites. Karphi may be lacking in some types of cooking vessels found on the other late LM IIIC sites, in particular the cooking jar or amphora. 1 For a discussion of problems involved in depositional processes, see La Motta and Schiffer 1999. 2 Nowicki 2000. 3 Warren 2007, 334.</page><page sequence="337">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION A few rooms at Karphi contained a small number of nearly complete vessels of early SM date, and it would appear that while the settlement belongs almost entirely to the LMIIIC period, it went out of use when the new SM styles were just developing or being introduced.4 The graves, however, particularly those atTa Mnemata, continued to be used down to EPG, long after the abandonment of the settlement, perhaps by the former inhabitants who had moved to nearby Papoura.5 A look at material from specific deposits at Karphi is helpful. Much of the earliest material on the site comes from the streets or open courts. These are indicated on the Karphi plan with paving stones, but these pavers were rarely found in place; often, only the lines of the widely-spaced steps indicated that the area was originally paved.6 Stratigraphically, the fact that the pavers had disappeared from many of the streets and courts before excavation means that much of the pottery found in these areas may have come from below the pavements, although some fragments may have been thrown out as rubbish or washed in from elsewhere.7 Thus, most of this pottery belonged to the time of or before the construction of the streets and courts, not to the period of final use of the site. The nature of the preserved material from these areas bore out the interpretation that they were not habitation deposits; the pottery came in small fragments and included a high percentage of fine wares. Much of the pottery from these areas was of very early LM IIIC date and gives a picture of the earliest phases of the settlement. Three roads or public courts produced the earliest material on the site. In K 32, K 76, and the so-called 'Broad Road'(K 101, K103, K 105, K 111) deep bowls were plentiful and decorated with buttonhook spirals, quirk, comb pattern, Minoan flower, and bivalve shell, all of which are found in LM IIIB or early LM IIIC deposits. The bases of deep bowls and other vessels were either flat or low raised and concave and included none of the higher feet found on the later vessels. The courtyard K 79-89 also produced pottery from an early phase of LM IIIC, although not as early as the fragments from K 76. One exception is the cup K79.1, which is one of the latest pieces from the site, anticipating the SM wavy line cup; since the nearby room K 116 shows evidence of continued use into the beginning of SM, this cup may belong with that phase, when court K 89 may have housed a bread oven. Although there were indeed few stratified deposits, in several rooms the excavators distinguished lower strata that were earlier than the period of abandonment. In K 23 of the Magazines, there were two lower levels, but unfortunately, the preserved pottery consists of small fragments and is not plentiful, so these deposits are not as helpful as they might be. Nevertheless, the deep bowls with low raised or flat bases and one with a bivalve shell look very early in LM IIIC, although perhaps not as early as those from K 76. This evidence accords well with the suggestion made by Pendlebury that the Magazines were not among the earliest structures at Karphi, but came later than the Great House, Temple, Barracks, and Northern and Southern Shelters.8 A large rubbish dump ran under the Great House and the streets outside it to the west (K 12, K 13, K 16 17, K 70, K 72); this dump pre-dated the construction of the later rooms of the Great House and was recognised and kept separate in the boxes by the excavators. The two lower deposits beneath K 12 produced deep bowls that were early in shape (flat and low raised bases) and motifs (Minoan flower, comb). The same rubbish dump was picked up under K 17, where the excavators kept separate pottery from two different layers. The pottery from the upper deposit is small and scrappy, with few diagnostic elements, except for a deep bowl with a low foot. The lower deposit contains a MM ribbed tumbler base, perhaps belonging to the period when the peak sanctuary was in use. The remainder of the preserved pottery is early LM IIIC, including flat deep bowl bases; the plaque fragment suggests that religious equipment was in use in this area in the early stages of the settlement's history. K 70 was a cellar built over the same rubbish dump, and it may have been a storeroom for a shrine of the goddess with upraised arms in K 15-17, since much ritual equipment was found here. The preserved pottery from K 70 seems to come not from the dump but from the use of the area for storage, as it included a large coarse stirrup jar (K70.1) and an amphora with rope twisted handles (K70.2). While all of the material is certainly LM IIIC, the coarse ware cannot be more closely dated. K 72, part of the street leading up to the Temple, also lay over the rubbish dump. Most of the preserved material seems to come from the final use of the area. The stirrup jar (K72.2) found here has some late features; the air hole near the false spout, the tilted spout, and the linear decoration of the vessel point to a very late LM IIIC date. 4 B. P. Hallager has recently questioned the existence of Subminoan as a distinct chronological period, citing the lack of sites with evidence for SM pottery stratified between LM IIIC and PG (Hallager 2010). While there is much merit in her argument, at Karphi (and at Kavousi), pottery of a style that is more developed than late LM IIIC but not yet clearly PG does exist, and the term Subminoan still seems appropriate for it. Much of Hallager's evidence from Karphi comes from the tombs, many of which continued in use after the settlement was abandoned in late LM IIIC, and when these pieces are removed from the discussion of LM IIIC, the lack of Subminoan does not seem as clear. 5 Watrous 1982, 20. 6 Karphi, 66. 7 In fact, Pendlebury (Karphi, 66) even suggested a massive flooding at the end of the settlement's history that took out all of the pavings. 8 Karphi, 135.</page><page sequence="338">CONCLUSIONS A few other rooms produced early material. A large amount of LM IIIB style pottery came from K 38 in the so-called Temple Dependencies. Pendlebury believed that the Temple was constructed at the beginning of the settlement, and it is possible that the material from K 38 is evidence for that early use, although its proximity to the rubbish dump found around the Great House suggests that some of this early material may have come from that dump. This room may have been associated with the Great House Shrine (K 15-18), with which it is contiguous. K 68 also produced a good deal of early LM IIIC pottery suggesting that the Central West Quarter may also have been one of the early complexes on the site. In general, while the small fragments of fine decorated wares found in every room may belong with earlier phases of the building's use, the nearly complete vessels are probably representative of the material from the time of the abandonment of the settlement, and should provide a date for the last use. Some earlier LM IIIC material continued in use, but it is clear that the majority of the pottery from the latest period of occupation of Karphi was late LM IIIC. Nevertheless, a few rooms produced ceramic material that may be termed SM. These are clustered in the northwest part of the settlement, including K 81 in the Central West Quarter, K 115 in the Western Cliff Houses, and K 116 in the Commercial Quarter; the exception is the possible late vessel from the floor deposit in K 23 in the Magazines in the southeast quadrant. Two of the rooms in the northwest were near or in areas with ritual equipment; K 115 was a storeroom associated with a room containing figurines (K106), andK 116 produced fragments of at least three statues of the goddess with upraised arms. These rooms of ritual importance may have continued in use when other areas of the settlement were abandoned. A cup from K 81 in the Central West Quarter is probably also very late in date, although not so late as vessels in some of the other deposits just mentioned. K81.1 is a large cup with a tall offset rim and a wavy line in the centre. It resembles the wavy band cups that are typical of SM deposits at Knossos,9 although lacking the conical foot and bell-shaped body found on the SM examples. K 115, a small roofed cellar associated with a room with ritual objects (K 106) also produced many fine nearly complete vessels. The krateriskos (K115.4) is unique in the settlement, and although the shape begins as early as early LH IIIC on the mainland, it is rare on Crete until SM or PG. The rest of the pottery is late LM IIIC, including the large cup with zigzag, fringed kylix with bulbous stem, and gremlin deep bowl. The stirrup jar is more reminiscent of earlier LM IIIC. K 116 was apparently a shrine of the goddess with upraised arms. The pottery is amongst the latest in the settlement, especially the stirrup jar (K116.4) and amphora (Kl 16.3), both of which look similar to vessels of SM date. A possible wavy line cup was also found in K 79 (K79.1), part of the courtyard outside K 116. The floor deposit from K 23 included the burned krater (K23.ll) with its uncommon shape and cross hatched triangles. It is difficult to know if the vessel is unusual for chronological reasons or because it was an import. The linear decoration suggests that it was later than LM IIIC in style, and it finds parallels from Kephallonia of late LH IIIC date; although the correlations between mainland and Cretan styles in this period are still not fixed, late LH IIIC may have been contemporary with early SM.10 The settlement, then, seems to have gone out of use early in SM, before the SM style became fixed or when the potters were just beginning to imitate the new style. Even that late use may have been restricted to a particular area. The tombs, however, must be con sidered separately, as they are likely to have continued in use for a considerable period of time after the settlement itself was abandoned; the late pottery found within the Ta Mnemata tombs cannot be used to suggest continued inhabitation of the houses into the PG period. Use of a LM IIIC site for continued burials was certainly the case at Kavousi-Vronda, where the tholos tombs actually cut into the earlier houses of the settlement and where the material is all later than what was found on the floors of the abandoned houses.11 At Ta Mnemata SM vessels appeared in M 3 and M 16 (M3.1, M16.2, M16.5), while M 1, M 4, M 11, and M 17 contained pottery of the SM-PG phase (Ml.l, M1.2, M4.1, M8.1, Mll.2-4, M17.1-4); M 17 seems to have produced nothing but SM-EPG. The spring at Vitzelovrysis also continued in use, to judge from the one imported PG fragment with compass-drawn concentric semicircles that was found there (V.l). The study of the pottery by context, then, provides some new information about the date of the Karphi settlement. It was founded at the beginning of the LM IIIC period, in the transitional LM IIIB/C phase. Pendlebury assigned the earliest habitation to the Northern and Southern Shelters that lie on the eastern edge of the settlement up the slopes of the hill,12 where he envisioned the people roofing over clefts in the rock with brushwood and living while they constructed the earliest parts of the city. The earliest real buildings were thought to be Room 9 of the Great House, perhaps the Temple, and the Barracks. The settlement in this phase had a communal rubbish dump picked up under K 12, 9 Warren 1982-83, 85, fig. 60; Sackett (ed.) 1992, pi. 50a, b. 10 D'Agata 2007, 95. Hallager 2007, 196, however, questions this correlation. 11 Kavousi IIA, 7-8. The situation there may have been different, since it is not certain that any of the tombs were used by the inhabitants of the settlement. 12 Karphi, 135.</page><page sequence="339">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI — A RE-EXAMINA TION K 13, K 16, K 17, and K 70. When or before these buildings were completed, the Magazines, Rooms K 42^13, K 47, and the road K 45-51 -50 in the Southern Houses, as well as the Eastern Block were apparently constructed. In a later phase, additions were made to the Great House, covering over the dump, and the town was regularised with the Broad Road laid out going up to the Temple, the Square K 48, and the remaining rooms of the Southern Houses constructed, with a new road (K 52, K 54) replacing the road covered over by K 45-51-50. Another square existed where later K 86 and K 88 were built. Finally, there were minor alterations: the blocking of the Temple Road, perhaps another cellar for the Great House (K 70), the enlargement of K 74 and K 71. This picture painted by Pendlebury depends a good deal on his idea of how communities were planned and developed, with people living in temporary housing while constructing first important public buildings, then constructing the smaller living quarters, and finally laying out the streets. He often made reference to his discoveries at Amarna as providing a model for development, a reasonable approach for his time. Nevertheless, Amarna period Egypt is a model of dubious applicability for LMIIIC Crete, which did not have the same social, political, economic, or religious organisation. The study of the pottery, however, does bear out some of what Pendlebury proposed. Both the Northern and Southern Shelters produced fragments that have parallels in deposits of early LM IIIC, including the rhyton K123.1. The rubbish dump was early, and probably was used by the inhabitants of the Great House, and the Temple Dependencies (especially K 38) do provide some of the earliest pottery from the site. The lower material from the Magazines was not as early, suggesting that this building was constructed at a somewhat later date. The LM IIIB/C and early LM IIIC material found in the streets and courts suggest that the layout of the street system and many of the buildings belong to the earliest phases of the settlement. Pendlebury did not concern himself with the phases of abandonment, yet there is some indication that some areas went out of use before others. The last buildings in use seem to have been the Western Cliff Houses, the area around a possible ritual centre (K 106), as well as a shrine of the goddess, K 116. There is no evidence elsewhere on the site of anything as late as those two rooms, and perhaps the eastern part of the settlement had already been abandoned; it is possible that when the population left Karphi, the site continued to be used seasonally by shepherds or former inhabitants continued to practice their religious observances at the shrines and Temple, where the goddess statues and accompanying ritual material were left behind. The question remains as to why the population left Karphi; despite Pendlebury's insistence that there was no evidence of any catastrophe on the site the pottery shows much burning, possibly caused by contact with the fires in the houses that must have been used for cooking and warmth, but also perhaps as a result of natural disasters like earthquakes or caused by hostile actions. When the settlement was abandoned, the larger coarse vessels were left behind, but the inhabitants may have taken with them some of their finer drinking and eating vessels; there are few identifiably late LMIIIC deep bowls from the site that are nearly complete. The people also abandoned their statues of the goddesses with upraised arms and ritual equipment, a pattern that can be seen also at Kavousi- Vronda, Khalasmenos, and Vasiliki Kephala.13 While the abandonment of ritual objects seems surprising, it may be that these objects had locational importance and could not be removed from the places with which they were associated. Perhaps elder mem bers of the community or the most devout continued to visit the shrines and temple after the abandonment. The Ta Mnemata tombs were used even after the last rooms were abandoned and continued for several generations until SM-EPG. The spring at Vitzelovrysis was also visited into PG. After the PG period, how ever, the cemetery seems to have been abandoned for a long period. Somewhat surprisingly, later use of the site can also be seen. There was apparently an Archaic shrine at Vitzelovrysis,14 and a good deal of what seems to be Archaic and Classical pottery was found in and around the Ta Mnemata tombs. It is possible that the tombs became a locus for ancestor veneration, or that the cemetery was used by groups of inhabitants of the Lasithi to assert their claims to power through connections with the past or even to establish territorial claims on the site, as was the case elsewhere.15 Hellenistic pottery has been found in K 12-K 17, suggesting reuse in the late fourth — third centuries; possibly Karphi was at that time a seasonal settlement. Finally, Byzantine presence is attested by a fragment of glazed pottery from K 127. FUNCTION OF BUILDINGS AND ROOMS The excavators assigned names to the various blocks or quarters of the settlement, providing them with designations that reflected their presumed functions. Often these names related to religious practices, like the Temple, the Priest's House, and the Small Shrine. The Great House was thought to be the ruler's dwelling, the Barracks were so called because it was thought that soldiers stayed there to guard the entrance into the site. The Magazines contained a large number of pithoi and other storage vessels, the Baker's House had an oven, and the Commercial Quarter was thought to be shops 13 Gesell 2004 (Kavousi-Vronda); Tsipopoulou 2001, 2009 (Khalasmenos); Eliopoulos 1998, 2003, 2004 (Vasiliki Kephala). 14 Karphi, 100. 15 Day 2011 b.</page><page sequence="340">CONCLUSIONS (although K 116 contained religious equipment). Other names were more neutral, simply reflecting the area in which they were located (Southern Houses, Eastern Quarter, Central West Quarter, and so on). For the most part, the finds, especially the pottery, do not help to determine specific functions for the various buildings or rooms. By using a combination of the notebook and the extant pottery, however, one can reconstruct some of the activities that went on in the rooms, at least those that left archaeologically visible remains. The notebook, while helpful in determining what was in the rooms, must be used with care. The material was recorded with increasing detail, so that in the 1937 and 1938 seasons only general shapes were recorded, but by the 1939 season the actual types of each shape were often given; thus there is greater information about the material from the western part of the settlement and the eastern edge than about that from the centre of the excavated area. In 1939, however, most of the pottery was examined without washing and discarded on the site, so the observations about this material may not be complete. Finally, it is not always clear from the notebook whether the pottery that was mentioned was nearly complete or fragmentary. Thus, when the notebook reports that room K 138 in the Eastern Quarter had five pithoi with different rims, it is not certain that all those pithoi were complete and in use in the room at the time of abandonment, since some may only have been represented by fragments, and the upper portions of pithoi could have been reused as chimney pots. Modern attempts at reconstructing the economy and society of Karphi have taken what is given in the publication and notebooks to suggest numbers of vessels and to reconstruct the amount of storage and other activities that occurred in the rooms and buildings.16 Nowicki has even produced plans of major buildings at Karphi with circles representing each pithos or storage jar;17 these seem to be based on a combination of the number of pithoi mentioned in the publication and notebooks together with a calculation of available space, but they are misleading, since we cannot be certain that there were ever that many jars in use in that room at the same time. Nevertheless, the preserved remains do allow us to see typical assemblages and to reconstruct some activities that occurred in the rooms and buildings.18 Most of the buildings in the settlement seem to be ordinary domestic establishments, and the rooms within them multifunctional; activities attested in the archaeological record include storage, the preparation and consumption of food and weaving; other activities can be deduced from the non-ceramic finds. In general, the larger rooms in the buildings showed the greatest number of activities. Storage Storage occurred in nearly every room of the settle ment; only street/courts K 32, K 50, K 70, and K 140 and Rooms K 38 and K 126 produced no fragments of pithoi or other storage jars. Most rooms had between one and five storage vessels, including pithoi, pithoid jars, tripod pithoi, and coarse stirrup jars; jars have not been included in this count, since many of these may have been used in cooking rather than storage. A few rooms produced exceptionally large numbers of pithoi: nine in K 69, eight each in K 22 and K 80. The rooms with the largest numbers also had many other types of storage vessels: K 149 had 17 pithoi, four tripod pithoi, and seven pithoid jars; next door in K 147 were five pithoi, eight pithoid jars, a tripod pithos, and a stirrup jar; K 121 contained ten pithoi, two tripod pithoi, and five pithoid jars;19 K 16-17 had six pithoi, eight pithoid jars, and a stirrup jar; K 143 had five pithoi and seven pithoid jars; K 106 contained six pithoi, three pithoid jars, and two stirrup jars; K 110 had three pithoi, six pithoid j ars, and a stirrup j ar. While there is no evidence for the nature of the material stored within most of these vessels, whether solids or liquids, foodstuffs or other materials, the large coarse stirrup jars almost certainly were used for liquids, whether wine or oil. We can, however, guess that the pithoi were used for long-term storage, while the pithoid jars, being smaller and with wider mouths, would have served for short-term storage. In general, the rooms with the largest number of pithoi tend to be the largest within the house (e.g. K 147, K 149, K 137, K 139, K 132, K 23, K 44, K 110, K 106), but occasionally storage vessels are numerous in smaller rooms (e.g. K 22, K 26, K 50, K 55, K 71, K 84, K 102, K 115). Large rooms with evidence of storage were not found in the Barracks, the Southern Shelters, or most of the houses in the Central West Quarter. The Temple and its Dependencies also were without major storage facilities. The assem blages of some LM IIIC shrines elsewhere included pithoi, as at Khalasmenos,20 but others did not, as at Kavousi-Fro«rffl.21 Perhaps at Karphi whatever food was needed for rituals came from the stores of the members of the community. It is hard to estimate the storage capacities of the houses, since so few pithoi are preserved and the notebook does not provide information on the size of those that were discarded. Basing his interpretation on ethnographic evidence from Lasithi, Nowicki has 16 Nowicki 1999, Wallace 2005. 17 Nowicki 1999, figs. 11-2, 14, and 15; these are reproduced in Nowicki 2002, fig. 60. 18 Day 2011a. 19 The number of storage vessels for what was interpreted as a single-room structure in K 121 is extraordinary, and it is likely that this room belonged with one of the other buildings in the Western Cliff Houses, probably K 113-114-120; see Wallace 2005, 229. 20 Tsipopoulou 2009, 159-60. 21 Gesell, Glowacki and Klein, forthcoming.</page><page sequence="341">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION estimated that an average family of five would need the following amount for storage of basic subsistence: for cereals three large pithoi (or 9-12 small), for pulses one large or 1-2 small pithoi, and for olive oil one large or two small pithoi.22 If he is correct, then either these buildings with large storage capacity housed larger, perhaps extended, families, or the pithoi represent storage of goods beyond what was needed for subsistence. Cooking Cooking also went on in many of the rooms, although few hearths were found (only in K 22, K 68, K 83, K 136, K 137, and K 139). Nevertheless, tripod cooking pots, cooking dishes, cooking trays, cooking jugs, and cooking lids were found in nearly all of the rooms of the settlement. Even ritual rooms produced cooking pottery; the Temple had a cooking dish and several tripod cooking pots. A few rooms contained little or no cooking ware, including one of the buildings in the Eastern Quarter (K 137-141), one of the houses of the Southeast Block (K 130-131), and some of the dependencies of the Temple (K 38, K 39). Some of the rooms with large numbers of storage vessels contained few if any cooking wares (K 69, K 80). Rooms with extraordinary numbers of cooking pots may have served as kitchens: K 138-139 and K 143 for the Eastern Quarter, K132 for the Southeast House, K2 for the Barracks, K 19 for the Temple, K 16-17 for the Great House Shrine, K14 for the Great House, K 31 for the Magazines, K 26-27 for the Southern Houses, K 60 and K 80 for the Priest's House, K 118 for the Eastern Cliff Houses, K 113 and K 121 for one Western Cliff House, K106 for the other Western Cliff House, and all the rooms for the houses on Mikre Koprana. Cooking pottery came in a variety of types. In general, cooking equipment included at least one tripod cooking pot and a cooking dish; cooking trays were also common, but cooking jugs and lids were less so. None of the flat-bottomed cooking jars or cooking amphoras found at other LMIIIC sites were identified at Karphi,23 but some may have been discarded and recorded as jars. It is assumed that the various types of cooking pottery were employed in different kinds of cooking. The tripod cooking pot comes in a variety of shapes and sizes; most are the deep, two-handled collared jars, but smaller tripods with one or two vertical handles, tripod bowls, and round-bottomed tripods also occur. Tripods seem to have been designed to set directly over the fire,24 and they may have been used for preparing stews or soups; the different shapes for the base may have been designed for cooking different kinds of food. Cooking jugs also show evidence of having been placed in the fire, possibly for heating liquids, which could then be poured through the spout. Trays were probably used for warming near the fire or for serving; they do not show the same degree of burning as other cooking vessels. The tripod trays from Karphi show no signs of the interior burning that occurred on examples from Khalasmenos that has led to their being identified as grills or portable hearths.25 The function of cooking dishes is still uncertain. These large, rather shallow vessels had thin rounded bottoms that nearly always were burned so badly that they disintegrated; the rims, however, were very thick, often pulled out or pressed in to form spouts, and sometimes with holes. Dishes may have been used like a Chinese wok for keeping part of the food warm on the sides while the rest was cooking in the bottom. They may also have been used for cooking large quantities of food perhaps for social occasions. Two cooking dishes were found in the oven of the Baker's House, suggesting that they may have been used in baking. The dishes could be turned into small ovens with the addition of a lid of similar shape.26 It is also possible that dishes were used in the cheese-making process.27 While lids are not generally classed among cooking vessels, many of the LMIIIC lids are made of cooking fabrics and show traces of burning, and they may have been placed over the cooking pots. The most common type of lid is a flat knobbed disc, often elaborately decorated on top. The undersides of these lids show burning in a variety of patterns. Other types of vessels may have been used not in cooking, but in the preparation of food, such as basins; these may have been employed like plastic lekanai today for a variety of purposes, for mixing food but also for washing. A few rooms had unusual types of cooking vessels in them. K 126, for example, contained at least two large cooking slabs. These may equally have been used for an industrial process such as metalworking or pottery manufacture. Eating and Drinking Eating and drinking also seem to have gone on in nearly every room. These activities were most often daily and domestic, involving coarse and simpler fine vessels; the more elaborately decorated shapes, however, may have been used as display items in more social forms of eating 22 Nowicki 1999, 156. 23 Yasur-Landau 2006, 54. 24 Yasur-Landau 2006, 51. 25 Yasur-Landau 2006, 54. 26 Mook 1999, 508. 27 It is interesting that no specialised equipment for cheese making has been identified at Karphi, given the importance that shepherding must have played in the local economy. The site is too high to make ordinary agriculture possible, and olives do not grow in the Lasithi at all. Perhaps the cooking dishes were used to boil milk for making cheese; cheese would have been aged in baskets, which leave no trace in the archaeological record.</page><page sequence="342">CONCLUSIONS and drinking. Feasting may have provided households an opportunity to display wealth, status, or taste in their serving vessels and vessels for consumption. Communal or public feasting is part of the social fabric of human communities, and doubtless went on at Karphi. Much of the pottery seems to have been decorated with a view to impressing people beyond the household on feasting occasions. It is difficult, however, to know what kinds of feasting occurred from the limited archaeological record, particularly in the absence of any preserved animal bones.28 Nevertheless, examining the evidence of highly decorated eating and serving vessels, along with cooking facilities can give insights into the feasting practices at Karphi.29 The most frequent fine table vessel was the deep bowl, and fragments occurred in nearly every room. The shape is generally thought of as a drinking vessel, but it may also have been used for eating, perhaps for cracked wheat or porridge that may have served as a basic food for the inhabitants.30 Cups were certainly used for drinking, and like deep bowls could have served for daily and private use or be brought out for social occasions; cups are less common than deep bowls and are also spread around the settlement. The large and elaborately decorated kylikes and mugs, oversized cups, and even some of the larger deep bowls or small kraters (those with a rim diameter from 18-23) may have functioned in specialised feasting occasions that focused on drinking. Kylikes in general seem to have been employed in feasting occasions in LMII—III Crete, as can be seen on wall paintings.31 In particular, the LM IIIC kylix can be extremely large, and the shape may have played an important role in elite drinking rituals at both Karphi and Kavousi Vronda,32 Kylikes are rarer than other drinking vessels, but they do occur in nearly every building on the site, although not in every room. Several buildings had larger than usual numbers of kylikes: the Great House, the Southeast Block, the Western Cliff Houses, and Building K 85-87-69 of the Central West Quarter. The presence of kylikes in K 106 and K 85, both of which contained figurines of possible ritual significance suggests that these vessels played a role in sacred as well as secular rituals. I have argued elsewhere that the large kylikes found on LM IIIC sites may remain from competitive drinking rituals that helped elites create and maintain power.33 Although these drinking rituals seem to have gone on in several large houses on the site, more kylikes were found in the Great House than elsewhere. With its accompanying shrine, its architectural refinements like the use of cut blocks in the doorways, and the variety of luxury goods found in its storerooms this building seems to have been marked as one of the most important buildings so far uncovered at the site. Other types of vessels seem to have been used in festive circumstances, both the drinking rituals and feasting. Kraters were abundant, and while similar in shape to the deep bowls, they are much larger and generally more elaborately decorated. The function of kraters is not certain; the name suggests a large bowl for mixing water and wine in the later Greek fashion, but there is currently no evidence to confirm this association. At Karphi, kraters are often found in association with large kylikes, and may also have been used in the elite drinking rituals, where their elaborate decoration would display the wealth and taste of the owner; a huge and elaborately decorated krater, for example, accompanied the large kylikes found in K131 in the Southeast Block. Kraters were, however, also found without kylikes and may have been used in other types of feasting rituals, along with mugs and tankards. Highly decorated pyxides and stirrup jars probably were meant to display the taste, wealth, or status of the owners during social occasions. The pyxis is one of the peculiarities of the Karphi ceramic assemblage; although known at other LMIIIC sites, the shape is not so plentiful elsewhere as at Karphi. Pyxides are among the most highly decorated vessels at Karphi, and whatever their function, they must have been display items. Fine stirrup jars are generally small and have elaborate decoration; the finest examples with octopus motifs. Perhaps they were used as oil containers, impressive during festive dining. The juglet or small amphora may have served a similar use in ordinary domestic circumstances; these rarely carry elaborate decoration. One-handled, cylindrical-mouthed jugs are plentiful, the coarse and undecorated examples used in ordinary domestic context, the more elaborate and fine vessels employed in social or religious circumstances. All of these types of vessels seem to have been spread around the site, suggesting that small-scale feasting occurred regularly in every household. Cooking vessels also can be useful in determining sites of medium- to large-scale feasting; such vessels should be plentiful and of large size.34 At Karphi, a few of the buildings seem to have larger than normal cooking assemblages. The houses on Mikre Koprana (K 147, K 149-150), for example, produced large numbers of cooking dishes and tripod cooking pots, along with a large number of storage vessels. Building 28 Wallace 2005, 264-70 gives much of the non-ceramic evidence for feasting at Karphi and other LM IIIC sites. 29 Hayden 2001, 46-58. 30 The deep bowl is perhaps analogous to the bowls used for rice or even noodles in Chinese culture, where small amounts of meats and vegetables are placed on top of a bed of rice that forms the staple meals. 31 For example, on the Campstool Fresco from Rnossos: Evans 1935, 388, pi. 31. 32 Day and Snyder 2004. 33 Day and Snyder 2004, 73.

This building was a megaron type and had a hearth in the centre of the large room; its size suggests that it was an elite building, and it may have been involved in regular feasting activities. Not surprisingly, the Great House also had much cooking equipment, particularly if the material from the Great House Shrine is added into the total. K 26-27-28 produced many tripod cooking pots, and K 106 had a variety, including a large number of cooking trays. Of these buildings, at least two (the Great House and K 106) also produced more than one large kylix. Three of them (the Great House, K 106, and K 27) had evidence for religious activities. While the Temple did not have a large number of cooking vessels, taken with the pottery from K 19 of the Temple Dependencies, there is ample evidence that feasting was at least on occasion a sacred ritual. What was the nature of the feasting that went on at Karphi? The oversized drinking vessels and the emphasis on elaborate display on feasting pottery suggests that feasting was part of a system of competitive elite status display, possibly the patron role feasting or diacritical feasting identified by Dietler and Hayden.35 It is also possible that at least some of the Karphi feasts were aimed at promoting alliances among groups, and some at least had a religious meaning. Weaving Some of the other terracotta finds provide evidence for spinning and weaving, including spools, spindle whorls, and a single large weight. Spools were found all over the site, usually one or two to a room, but occasionally they occurred in such large numbers that one can postulate a loom in the room. Many of similar size and weight were found in Mikre Koprana, at least 18 from a single room (K 150). K 136 in the Eastern Quarter had 21 spools, the Southern Shelters produced 15, and in the Southern Houses there were at least 20 in K 27, two in K 26, six in K 44, and seven in K 46. K 23 in the Magazines had nine, with five in K 22 next to it. K 61 in the Priest's House produced 19 spools. K 102 in the Western Cliff Houses had 38, and K 110 in the Eastern Cliff Houses produced over 50. The large pyramidal weight found in K 126 may also have been part of a loom, but only the single example is recorded. Terracotta beads or spindle whorls were also found all over the site, but never more than four of them came from a single room. Clearly the people of Karphi were engaged in spinning and weaving on a domestic scale, and in at least six rooms enough spools (i.e. around 20 or more) were found to suggest that looms were set up: K 27, K 61, K 110, K 102, K 136, and K 150. Other activities Other objects give us further information on the activities and functions of rooms. There is little to suggest industrial activity. Although there must have been a potter's workshop, only a single fragment of a potter's wheel was found and no kiln; the large quantity of misfired blue ware vessels found in the Temple, however, may represent wasters from a nearby kiln. Metal hoards have been seen as possible indicators of metallurgical activity,36 but they may equally well show wealth. The lead run-offs found in K 11 and K 12 of the Great House, however, do attest to some metal lurgical activity there. Religion Many rooms that produced ritual equipment may have served religious functions, with evidence for varying degrees of private or public involvement and distinctly different kinds of rituals. The ritual areas at Karphi have been recognised and discussed by many scholars, but without taking into account the whole assemblages found in them.37 The Temple itself was the largest religious area, and doubtless served a public function. The large open area to the east may have been used for community gatherings.38 K 19, just to the south of the Temple and to the west of the open area produced a good deal of cooking equipment, and it is possible that food preparation for rituals took place in that room. The Temple produced the largest amount of ritual material, including the following: five nearly complete goddesses, fragments of at least four other faces and 40 arms, pieces of a fine buff figure, and attributes from headdresses (birds, discs, palettes, and incised cones). There were also fragments of plaques, one with a head and at least three others, and many cylindrical offering stands, the two catalogued stands and at least ten others. Other shapes included scuttles, a kalathos with horns, an incense burner, a chalice, the base of a rhyton, a possible hut urn, a fenestrated stand, and at least two animal figurines. Other material recorded from the Temple included fine blue ware vessels, and cooking pottery, including tripods and a dish, but no storage vessels. It is not clear whether these objects were all found in association with the goddesses or if they were in one of the other spaces that may have been part of the religious complex. Nevertheless, it is clear that the Temple had the greatest amount and variety of ritual material of all the religious buildings on the site. It is clearly a shrine involving the worship 35 Hayden 2001, 57-8; Dietler 2001, 82-8. 36 Wallace 2005, 259. 37 Gesell 1985, 79-82; Prent 2005, 137^9, 193-4; Hallager 2009, 114-6. 38 Rutkowski 1987, 259.</page><page sequence="344">CONCLUSIONS of goddesses with upraised arms and is similar to other contemporary shrines at Kavousi-Vronda, Khalasmenos, and \'as\\iki-Kephala.y&gt; The two other possible shrines in which goddess figures have been found at Karphi are not without problems. The Great House Shrine (K 15-18) produced ritual material, including a goddess face, snake tube, and figurines, suggesting that this was another shrine. The area had, however, been disturbed in later periods. Even if this disturbance did not affect the distribution of finds, it is possible that some of the material may have come from the dump under K 16 and K 17, since a plaque fragment was found from the lower deposits in K 17. The other areas built over the dump also produced additional cult equipment, including K 70, but it is unclear if these came from the dump below or were being stored in the storeroom at the time the building went out of use. Other fragments of ritual equipment came from the areas around the Great House: part of a goddess face, a plaque and a kalathos were found in K 38, a room that Pendlebury thought was part of the Temple Dependencies, but contiguous with K 16 and possibly constructed over the dump; it produced very early LM IIIC pottery. The streets and courts around the Great House also had ritual equipment, including K 72 to the north and west and K 32 to the south. There seem to be three possibilities about this shrine. First of all, the cult material found scattered throughout this area may have been part of the rubbish dump and have nothing to do with Rooms K 15-18. A second possibility is that most of this material may come from a shrine in K 15-18. The third possibility is that there had been a shrine in K 15-18 in an early phase of the settlement's history and remains from it were left in the area before the later K 15-18 shrine was built. The last explanation would account for the apparent presence of cult equipment both below the floors and above the floors of the area. In addition to the ritual equipment, there was evidence for cooking and storage in K 16-17 and in K 18. The association of this ritual building with the Great House suggests that the inhabitants of that dwelling exerted some control over the religious activity in the shrine. If the shrine existed from the beginning, then they always had control and possibly gained status from that association. If the shrine came later, then as Wallace suggested, it may provide evidence that the group in the Great House was asserting its own power by taking over the shrine.40 The third shrine of the goddess with upraised arms was located in K116 of the Commercial Quarter. Three goddesses are recorded from this room, along with part of a plaque, two scuttles, and more than four kalathoi. Outside the small shrine was an open courtyard, K 79 89. K 116 contained some of the latest pottery found in the settlement at Karphi, including a SM stirrup jar (K116.4), and this shrine may have been later or continued to be used after all or parts of the rest of the settlement had passed out of use. There is, however, some evidence that the building was no longer a shrine at the end of the settlement's history; the goddesses were so fragmentary that no attempt was made to make them up, and the court outside had been taken over by an oven. The material from the Temple and two smaller shrines of the goddess with upraised arms have certain features in common. Goddess statues and plaques were found in all three, stands in all but K 116. It is possible that the three shrines were not in use at the same time. K 15-18 may have been in use from early on in the settlement's history, while the shrine in K 116 may have been in use later than most of the rest of the settlement. It is impossible to date the construction or abandonment of the Temple, since so little datable fine ware was found in it. Pendlebury believed that the Temple was one of the earliest buildings constructed on the site, and if K 38 was part of the dependencies of the Temple, which is not at all certain, then his hypothesis is supported by the very early pottery found there. The blue ware vases found in the Temple have high concave raised bases that look rather late in LM IIIC, and if they do belong with the Temple assemblages, they indicate a use in the later part of LM IIIC. The exceptional preservation of the cult equipment also supports the idea that the Temple continued in use until the end of the settlement. In addition to the shrines of goddesses with upraised arms, there are other areas that produced different types of cult equipment, suggesting different types of rituals.41 Two rooms have been identified as the location of cult activities on the basis of cylindrical stands or altars found within them. The so-called Small Shrine (K 55, K 57) is so designated because of the elaborate 'altar', and a snake tube found in it. The altar clearly has ritual associations, with the double axes and small animals depicted on it, but its precise function is not certain. Whether it is actually an altar or is simply an elaborate stand is not known, but it does bear some resemblance to cylindrical stands found elsewhere in LM IIIC sites.42 The snake tube was quite fragmentary. Cylindrical tubes were used to hold offering bowls in religious contexts.43 Nothing else was found in this building to suggest a religious function. The layout of the building, however, with doorways facing on two large squares, does suggest a public function. Similar 39 Gesell 2004 (Kavousi-Fronc/a); Tsipopoulou 2001, 2009 (Khalasmenos); Eliopoulos 1998, 2003, 2004 (Vasiliki Kephala). 40 Wallace 2005, 260-1. 41 Day 2009. 42 They are particularly common at Kavousi-Vronda, where they occur in domestic assemblages (at least one in each building) but without any clear cult association; see Day et al. forthcoming. 43 Gesell 1976.</page><page sequence="345">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION is K 58, a small room off the Priest's House that faced onto a street. Here there were two stands, one cyl indrical, one rectangular. Eight kalathoi were also found in the room, possibly used as offering bowls with the stands, but no other ritual objects appeared. If the Small Shrine and K 58 did figure in religious activities, they functioned differently from the shrines of goddesses with upraised arms. Gesell identified K 27 in the Southern Houses as a cult area based on the two rhyta found in it.44 Although the piriform rhyton with the human head is portable and thus cannot be used to indicate that ritual activities occurred in the room, the large rhyton in the form of a charioteer and bull's heads is neither easily portable nor of any imaginable function other than ritual. A votive bronze double axe found next door in K 26 may indicate a ritual function for other parts of the building as well. It is difficult to imagine what sort of ritual activity went on in K 27, especially since the room produced so many domestic objects, including 17 pithoi and five tripod cooking pots. The presence of 20 spools suggests that a loom may have been set up in the room as well. At any rate, it is safe to assert that different sorts of cult activity occurred in this room than what went on in the shrines with the goddess figures, since the equipment is so different. There are no other rooms in which more than a single rhyton was found, and few are known at all. Rhyta imply that libations were made into the ground or another vessel. The rhyton is associated with ritual practice from the early stages of Minoan culture, and was especially common in palatial society. Use of these vessels may have involved appeasement of powers believed to reside in or under the earth: deities who regulated the fertility of the earth, those who controlled earthquakes, or those involved with death, even perhaps the dead themselves. The presence of the rhyta along with cooking equipment suggests that the pouring of libations may have been associated with feasting in or around the Southern Houses. Finally, a number of rooms that contained figurines may also have ritual associations. The figurines, while they are probably religious, do not indicate that the room in which they are found was a community oriented ritual centre,45 and figurines appear in many domestic contexts across the site (e.g. K 62, K 90, K 91, K 108, K 109, K 122, K 38, K 140, K 101). There are, however, at least two areas with figurines in association with other objects that indicate religious activity. K 85 and K 87 in the Central West Quarter produced larger animal figurines. In K 85 cult objects are said to have stood on a small ledge in the west wall, and many figurines came from the room, including two or three females, a bull, and the head of a large hollow bull. Possible fragments of a rectangular stand with punctuated design also came from this room. The adjoining room (K 87) contained a large hollow horse figurine and fragments of another animal figurine found on a table of rock. These two rooms, with their figurines set up on ledges or tables suggest definite ritual activity, but one different from what went on in the shrines of goddesses with upraised arms, or the rooms with the cylindrical offering stands. The building is unusual in the fact that storage was separated from the other activities; K 69 was used for storage (12 storage vessels), but none appeared in the other two rooms, which contained cooking vessels. The hut urn from K 69 seems to have been associated with storage and not involved in the rituals with the animal figurines. A similar assemblage came from K 106 in the Western Cliff Houses. The head of a terracotta statuette, body of an animal figurine, and fragments of unusual shapes that could represent possible altars or horns of consecration were found together with a bronze votive double axe. A rim fragment may come from a snake tube or some other sort of cylindrical stand. Cooking and storage also occurred in the room, and the associated room next door (K 102) had 38 spools and so possibly there was a loom here. That these two groups of figurines associated with stands or altars have religious meaning is quite certain, but we are less sure about the nature of that religious activity. The figurines may be a sign of private devotion rather than any public or community ritual. At any rate these rooms lack the clearly public nature of the shrines of the goddesses with upraised arms or even of the small rooms with offering stands that lie open to major streets. Since only a small portion of the entire Karphi settlement has been uncovered, it is difficult to make pronouncements about the religious beliefs of the inhabitants or their ritual practices. Nevertheless, it is clear that religion played a major role in the lives of the people of Karphi. The large temple, bigger than the religious buildings of other contemporary settlements,46 with its many figures of goddesses with upraised arms and open areas for public gatherings outside, seems to have been the central focus of ritual activities, but other smaller shrines with goddess figures scattered throughout the houses, whether all contemporary or not, suggest that ritual was not completely centralised. The presence of special rooms or buildings for offerings on stands and a room housing vessels for pouring libations, perhaps to different deities, indicates different ritual activities scattered 44 Gesell 1985, 81. 45 At Kavousi-Frtwrfa, for example, two horse figurines and a bovine were found on a platform in the corner of Room 1 of building D, but without any other ritual objects, and they must have been the object of domestic piety, rather than the focus of cult activity in a cult building. See Gesell, Day and Coulson 1995, 71-3. 46 Klein and Glowacki 2009, 157. If indeed all of the rooms of the complex at Vasiliki-Kephala belong to the same building, then it would be larger; the actual shrine, however, is quite small; see Eliopoulos 1998, 2003, 2004.</page><page sequence="346">CONCLUSIONS around the site. Finally, the animal and human figurines found in the houses without other ritual equipment suggest the importance of family or private devotion. The presence of cooking equipment in nearly all of the religious buildings indicates that part of the rituals included feasting. SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE KARPHI SETTLEMENT Trade and outside contact Watrous has suggested that Karphi may have been a seasonal settlement, only in use during the summer months, but this seems doubtful.47 Traditional seasonal settlements do not usually have cemeteries, nor so many nor such varied religious buildings. The organi sed nature of the settlement plan, with its cobbled streets and courts suggests a level of town planning that would not be in keeping with a village only in habited during one season. As both Watrous and Nowicki suggest, the inhabitants of the Karphi settlement were probably involved largely in subsistence farming and herding, and they stored their agricultural produce in storage jars within the rooms of the settlement.48 The sheer amount of storage suggests that each household kept food and material needs for its own use and the groups were more or less self sufficient; the fact that some of the houses showed greater storage facilities, however, suggests control over a surplus, and many of these buildings also show evidence of larger scale feasting. The economy, then, was quite simple, and there is no internal evidence that the inhabitants lived on the proceeds of brigandage, as suggested by Pendlebury and Watrous.49 While there may be a few imported goods found in the settlement, the picture from the pottery is that there was little trade with sites outside the immediate area. Most of the fabrics are local, and only a few vessels seem to have come from other sites on Crete, other islands, or the mainland. Several vessels seem to have been brought to the site from elsewhere on Crete. Petrographic analysis shows that K38.I was not of local manufacture, and it shows similarities to vessels from Knossos and the Mesara. K147.15 resembles a stirrup jar found at Khania, possibly an import from Knossos. The spouted bowls K115.6 and K.18 show possible contact with the islands in IIIC. Deep bowls without the interior monochrome coating may come from the mainland (K12.2, K46.2, K106.3, K.6, and possibly K76.14). Krater K23.ll is a possible import from Kephallonia. The flask K18.1 has its closest parallels in Syria and may be an import from the Levant. It is not clear if jug K87.1 was of local manufacture, although its shape and decoration have similarities to other vessels from the site. A close parallel was found at Syme Vianno, and the presence of a similar vessel at Enkomi may suggest contact between Crete and Cyprus. The carinated bowl K143.2 may be an import, as it is unusual in shape and decoration, but there are no parallels to suggest where it might have come from. The evidence is scanty, but suggests that Karphi was not entirely isolated and that the inhabitants had connections, whether direct or indirect, with a number of areas of the eastern Mediterranean. Ethnicity The ethnicity of the inhabitants has been discussed on numerous occasions. Pendlebury believed that some of the inhabitants of the Karphi settlement were Mycenaeans or mainlanders, while others were Minoans, and other scholars have followed his suggestion.50 In particular, they have pointed to the megaron-type plans of the building of the Eastern Quarter as an indication that mainlanders lived at Karphi, segregated from the Minoan inhabitants. The megaron-type building continues to be seen as an indicator of Mycenaean inhabitation or mainland influence,51 although the use of large, rectangular and axial buildings may have as much to do with making symbolic connections to the power and stability of the Mycenaeans as with an indication of ethnicity.52 Other features have been seen as indicative of a Mycenaean presence at Karphi. Two types of cooking pots have been seen as introduced into Crete from the mainland. The round-bottomed tripod, in particular, has been seen as a mainland feature in the cooking assem blage.53 The cooking amphora, which may not appear at Karphi, has also been seen as a mainland type.54 Without written documents, we cannot determine the language spoken by the inhabitants of Karphi, but the material found in the settlement does not show differences that can be attributed to varying ethnic backgrounds rather than to different class or status groups or different dates. 47 Watrous 1982, 19-20. 48 Watrous 1982, 19-20; Nowicki 1999. 49 Karphi, 140; Watrous 1982, 19. It is difficult to know what would constitute archaeological evidence for brigandage, however. 50 Mazarakis Ainian 1997, 219. 51 Tsipopoulou 2005, 324. 52 Whittaker 2005, 338. 53 Borgna 1999, 200. 54 Tsipopoulou 2004, 115.</page><page sequence="347">11 Analysis of Postpalatial pottery from Karphi Eleni Nodarou and Ioannis Iliopoulos INTRODUCTION1 The destruction of the palaces in the LM IIIB period has been followed by the foundation of new settlements in remote and fairly inaccessible areas across Crete. The publication of LM IIIC sites like Kavousi-Frcwc/a,2 Katalimata,3 Vasiliki-Kephala4 and Khalasmenos5 in eastern Crete, Gazi6 and Karphi7 in central Crete, as well as the discovery of new sites through survey8 generated a renewed interest on the character and function of these settlements as well as the economy and structure of the societies inhabiting them.9 The new approaches have brought to light aspects of the material culture that can be explored through analysis. The production and distribution of Post palatial pottery is at the centre of archaeometric analyses, since ceramics of domestic and religious function are found in quantities and in various contexts. Within this framework an analytical project combining thin section petrography and scanning electron microscopy was undertaken for the study of the ritual equipment from Kavousi. It demonstrated the presence of contrasting technologies used by different groups of potters in the area of the Isthmus of Ierapetra during the LM IIIC period.10 The combination of thin section petrography and scanning electron microscopy for the study of ancient ceramics has contributed greatly in the understanding of Minoan pottery making traditions and distribution of ceramics.11 The analytical programme for the Postpalatial pottery from Karphi was put forward in order to assess the following issues: a) Characterisation and grouping of the pottery fabrics according to their mineralogical and textural characteristics through optical microscopy. The petrographic groups are then compared to the groups that derived from the macroscopic fabric study. This comparison reveals the connection between the visual properties of the final product (variation in colour, texture of the surface, hardness) and its technology of manufacture. b) Inferences on the raw materials and, thus, on the origin of the pottery used at Karphi on the basis of the mineralogical composition of the ceramic fabrics. The potential correlation between the function of the vessel and the respective clay recipes is also examined as well as the relationship between the fabrics of the domestic vessels and those of the ritual artefacts (goddess figures and snake tubes). c) Inferences on the technology of manufacture of the ceramics and more specifically on the firing temperature and kiln atmosphere through the examination of the clay body microstructure using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The semi quantitative elemental analysis provided by an Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (EDS) allows the grouping of samples according to their chemical composition and compare them with those from petrography. THE PETROGRAPHIC ANALYSIS Eighty-two samples were selected for petrographic analysis from the Karphi assemblage (for a complete catalogue of the vessels sampled, see table 11.1). The analysis was carried out at the INSTAP Study Center for East Crete using a LEICA DMLP polarising microscope. Among the shapes selected for analysis are included domestic wares as well as ritual objects. The petrographic analysis resulted in the establishment of five fabric groups, four of which are coarse and semi-coarse and one is fine. Detailed petrographic descriptions of the fabric groups are provided at the end of the chapter. 1 We would like to thank the 23rd Ephoreia of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities in Herakleion and the Greek Ministry of Culture for permission to sample the pottery from Karphi for analysis. 2 Day 1997; Gesell, Coulson and Day 1991; Gesell, Day and Coulson 1988; 1995. 3 Nowicki 2008. 4 Eliopoulos 1998. 5 Tsipopoulou 2001; 2004. 6 Marinatos 1937. 7 Day and Snyder 2004; Nowicki 1987. 8 For an overview of the site location and topography, see Wallace 2007. 9 Dickinson 2006; Whitley 1991; Wallace 2003; 2007. 10 Day et al. 2006. 11 Wilson and Day 1994; Shaw et al. 2001; Papadatos et al. forthcoming, to name just a few.</page><page sequence="348">338 THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINATION Table 11.1: Concordance of vessels sampled for analysis.

The absence of optical activity is indicative of a generally high firing temperature. The non-plastic inclusions are moderately well sorted and they consist of low-grade metamorphic rocks, namely fine grained phyllites in a variety of colours and consistencies, set in a mica rich clay matrix. The other non-plastic components are quartzite, monocrystalline quartz and sandstone. There are also very few to rare clay pellets and mudstone fragments which become common in subgroup (b). This rock and mineral suite is indicative of the Phyllite-Quartzite series outcropping in the area of the Lasithi plateau12 (FIG. 11.1). This series has experienced low grade (HP/LT) metamorphism13 and is composed of phyllites, quartzites, mica-schists and quartzose feldspar rich meta-sandstones, marbles and chert.14 The presence of the red clay pellets is indicative of incomplete clay mixing. The vessels represented in this group serve various functions. The domestic component includes cooking pots, cooking slabs, pithoi, jars and one pithoid jar, lids, kalathoi, and a scuttle. There are also three snake tubes and one askos. Subgroup (b): Low grade metamorphic rocks, mudstone and pellets (colour plate 1 c) Samples: KAR 06/1 (K29.14): lid KAR 06/ 59 (K20.1), 61 (K108.8): cooking dishes KAR 06/ 24 (K 22), 39 (K27.7), 53 (K106.25): cooking pots KAR 06/ 70 (K 47): cooking cup KAR 06/ 65 (K36.2), 80: pithoi KAR 06/ 62 (K44.7): basin KAR 06/ 64 (K43.16): jar KAR 06/26 (K 28): jug KAR 06/ 5 (K3.ll), 6 (K110.15), 8 (MK.10), 9 (K110.13), 68 (K22.8), 69 (K12.6), 73 (K26.8): kalathoi KAR 06/19 (K 40-41), 48: snake tubes KAR 06/ 35 (K3.5): pyxis This group is compositionally similar to subgroup (a): the main non-plastic components are the same low grade metamorphic rocks but in this subgroup they are poorly sorted and the presence of mudstone fragments, clay pellets and clay striations becomes more prominent. This indicates the use of a different clay recipe, possibly involving the addition of a red clay of alluvial origin. The Lasithi plateau alluvium is a potential source for the red clayey raw material. As for subgroup (a), the vessels represented in this group also serve domestic and ritual functions: there are cooking pots, cooking dishes, a cooking cup, kalathoi, a lid, a jug, one basin, one jar, two pithoi, and also two snake tubes, and a pyxis. Fabric Group 2: Semi-coarse with quartz-rich matrix (COLOUR PLATE 1 d) Samples: KAR 06/ 32, 50, 51: snake tubes KAR 06/58 (K2.12): jar This is a semi-coarse red firing fabric. The matrix is dark red brown and optically inactive. The dark colour of the groundmass indicates a firing temperature higher than that of Fabric Group 1. This fabric is characterised by densely packed small quartz fragments evenly distribu ted in a micaceous clay groundmass. The semi-coarse non-plastic inclusions consist of phyllite, quartzite, and chert fragments. The fragments of chert, although not abundant, are consistently present in this fabric and this leads to assign to Fabric Group 2 a different origin from Fabric Group 1. Chert constitutes a component of the low grade metamorphic environment of the Phyllite Quartzite series but the raw materials as well as the recipe of manufacture of this fabric are different from those of Fabric Groups la and lb. The vessels represented are three snake tubes and ajar. Small groups and loners The samples presented here are also connected with metamorphic sources of raw materials but due to compositional or textural variations were not included in the fabric groups described above. KAR 06/ 30, 38 (K23.26) (COLOUR PLATE 1 e) These samples are characterised by a red firing, coarse fabric set in a mica-rich base clay. The colour of the matrix is dark red brown and it is optically inactive. The non-plastic inclusions are low grade metamorphic and there are also mudstone fragments. This composition is very similar to Fabric Group 1(b) but instead of phyllite in these samples the main metamorphic component is phyllite mica schist. The vessels represented are a stirrup jar and a tripod. KAR 06/18 (colour plate 1 f) This is a calcareous fabric. The matrix has a dark greenish brown colour and it is optically inactive. The non-plastic inclusions consist of very fine grained brown metamorphic rock fragments, polycrystalline quartz, sandstone and very little quartz. The presence of rare mudstone fragments indicates a link with the Fabric Group lb. There are also rare microfossils.

Geological map of the area ofKarphi (after I.G.M.E. 1989) characteristic elongate voids in the groundmass are indicative of tempering with organic material. This fabric is highly calcareous and has no affinity with any of the fabrics encountered in the Karphi assemblage. The raw material used seems to have been a calcareous marl mixed with a non calcareous red clay. The mudstone fragments could provide a link with Fabric Group lb, i.e. the red non calcareous component could be from the local alluvial deposits. The vessel represented is a basin. KAR 06/21, 46 (COLOUR plate 1 g) This sample exhibits also a coarse, red firing fabric characterised by a red brown and optically inactive matrix. The non-plastic inclusions consist primarily of angular quartz grains and smaller quantities of polycrystalline quartz, chert, phyllite, quartzite, sandstone and rare plutonic rock fragments. The raw material for this fabric seems to be connected with an alluvial origin. The vessels represented are snake tubes. KAR 06/ 2 (K125.2), 52 (COLOUR PLATE 1 h) This is a coarse fabric characterised by a yellowish brown matrix which is optically moderately active. The non-plastic inclusions consist of metamorphic rock fragments which bring this group close to Fabric Group 1(a). Flowever, the predominance of quartzite over phyllite as well as the presence of amphibole led to differentiate these samples from the rest of Fabric Group 1(a). The vessels represented are a lid and a snake tube.</page><page sequence="351">ANALYSIS OF POSTPALATIAL POTTERY FROM KARPHI Flysch Fabrics These fabrics are characterised by combinations of non plastic components which belong to different rock types. Such coexistence of disparate components is attributed to a 'melange'-like lithologic formation or a flysch sequence. All samples of these fabric groups are characterised by a very fine clay matrix which indicates elaboration (levigation or sieving) of the clayey raw material prior to its use. Two main groups have been identified: Fabric Group 3: Semi-coarse with metamorphic and igneous rock fragments (COLOUR PLATE 2 a) Samples: KAR 06/10: goddess figure (skirt) KAR 06/11: snake tube KAR 06/ 25, 27 (K 12), 28: stirrup jars KAR 06/ 74, 76, 78: pithoi This is a semi-coarse fabric characterised by a very fine brown matrix which is optically inactive. The fineness of the clay indicates refinement (i.e. leviga tion) of the raw material prior to use. The non-plastic inclusions consist mainly of metamorphic and basic igneous rock fragments, along with rare sandstone fragments. The coarse non-plastic inclusions must have been added in the clay paste as temper. This rock and mineral suite is connected with flysch deposits. Such outcrops form part of the Tripolis zone and are found at the southern edge of the Lasithi plateau but also in the area of the Pediada, west of the Lasithi plateau. They consist mainly of shales and sandstones with common occurrences of volcanic material of basic composition.15 There is an ongoing analytical project on the material from the Pediada survey16 and there seem to be compositional similarities but not exact parallels between Fabric Group 3 from Karphi and the flysch fabrics from Pediada. With the present data it can be suggested that the samples from Karphi constitute the product of a broadly local workshop. The vessels represented are a goddess figure, a snake tube, three stirrup jars and three pithoi. Fabric Group 4: Semi-coarse with grey siltstone fragments (COLOUR PLATE 2 b) Samples: KAR 06/ 29: stirrup jar KAR 06/ 45, 49: snake tubes KAR 06/ 66 (K.62): pithos This fabric group displays affinities with Fabric Group 3. It is semi-coarse, characterised by a very fine brown matrix which is optically inactive. The colour of the matrix and the absence of optical activity are indicative of quite high firing. Especially in the case of sample KAR 06/ 29 the matrix is greenish brown and there are rounded bloating pores, both characteristic of high firing temperatures. The non-plastic inclusions consist primarily of fine grained phyllite-metamorphosed siltstone which has a silvery grey colour. There are also a few quartzite and sandstone rock fragments. A flysch outcrop might also be the source of the non-plastic inclusions of this fabric group but it is uncertain whether it is of the same origin as Fabric Group 3. The clay matrix of the two groups is very similar but Fabric Group 3 lacks the grey siltstone fragments. Close parallels for Fabric Group 4 have been encountered at the LMIIIC site of Kastrokephala, near Gazi, at the MM building of Gournes on the north coast east of Herakleion,17 among the Minoan pottery of the wider Pediada region,18 and in the Early Iron Age assemblage of Knossos.19 Therefore, there is a possibility that the pottery of Fabric Group 4 may be imported from outside the Lasithi plateau. It remains open to future research and chemical analysis whether all these samples share a common provenance or they were manufactured with similar raw materials. The vessels represented are a stirrup jar, two snake tubes and a pithos. Fine Fabrics One major group and several small groups and loners have been established. They are all characterised by a very fine clay matrix and small non-plastic inclusions which, in most cases, are inconclusive of origin. Fabric Group 5: Fine red fabric with small quartz fragments (COLOUR PLATE 2 c) Samples: KAR 06/ 4 (K122.3): krater KAR 06/13 (K61.2), 14 (K68.1), 16 (K68.2): deep bowls KAR 06/17 (K114.1): conical cup KAR 06/ 22 (K80.4): kylix KAR 06/ 31: snake tube KAR 06/ 55 (K150.3), 56 (K134.4), 57 (K134.3): stirrup jars This is a fine fabric characterised by a reddish brown to greenish brown and optically inactive matrix. The colour of the matrix is indicative of high firing temperatures. The non-plastic inclusions range from common to rare and comprise fragments of angular quartz and biotite mica. Rarer are small fragments of phyllite, chert, and sandstone. There are also dark red brown clay pellets. Due to the fineness of this fabric it is not possible to make inferences on its provenance. A similar fabric has been encountered in the LM III material from the 15 I.G.M.E. 1989. 16 E. Nodarou, N. and M. Panagiotakis, work in progress. 17 Galanaki et al, forthcoming. 18 E.

The vessels represented are a krater, three deep bowls, a conical cup, a kylix, a snake tube and three stirrup jars. Small groups and loners KAR 06/15 (K38.1) (COLOUR plate 2 e) Fine calcareous fabric characterised by a greenish brown matrix which is optically inactive. The colour of the matrix is indicative of high firing temperature. The non-plastic inclusions consist of a few fragments of angular quartz and some biotite mica. There are also rare microfossils. The presence of the latter is indicative of a marly raw material. There are not any marl outcrops in the broader area of the Lasithi plateau. Outcrops of Neogene marl deposits are found on the north coast in the area of Chersonisos and also in the area of the Pediada (FIG. 11.1). The vessel represented is a deep bowl. KAR 06/ 23 (K18.1) (COLOUR PLATE 2 f) Very fine calcareous fabric characterised by a brown and at parts greenish and optically inactive matrix. The colour of the matrix as well as the rare, small rounded voids is indicative of high firing. The very rare non plastic inclusions consist of small quartz fragments; there are also a few red clay pellets. This sample may or may not be connected to Fabric Group 5. Its colour is not the reddish brown seen in that group, it seems higher fired and it has significantly less non plastic inclusions. The fineness of the fabric does not allow any secure provenance assignment. The vessel represented is a flask, a shape that is not common at Karphi. There is a possibility, therefore, that this sample is an import. KAR 06/ 37 (K22.4) (colour plate 2 g) Fine calcareous fabric characterised by a dark brown and optically inactive matrix. The non-plastic inclusions are densely packed in the clay matrix and consist of angular quartz fragments and biotite mica along with common fragments of rounded micritic limestone. As for the previous sample, a marly clay must have been used for the manufacture of this vessel. The vessel represented is a pyxis. KAR 06/ 40 (K43.13) (COLOUR PLATE 2 h) Fine fabric characterised by a dark brown matrix which in some areas is optically moderately active, in others it is optically inactive. There are few non-plastic inclusions consisting of small quartz fragments, and rare chert. There are also few dark brown clay pellets. This composition is not diagnostic of origin but the fabric is not common at Karphi. The vessel represented is a pyxis. KAR 06/ 41 (K113.3) (COLOUR PLATE 2 0 Fine fabric characterised by a dark reddish brown micaceous matrix which is optically inactive. There are common non-plastic inclusions consisting of small quartz fragments, rare phyllite and biotite mica laths. There are also few dark brown clay pellets and clay striations which are indicative of incomplete clay mixing. The composition of the fabric is not diagnostic of origin but the fabric is not common at Karphi. The vessel represented is a jug. ANALYSIS WITH SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY A total of ten samples have been submitted for analysis under the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) in order to investigate technological aspects relating to the manufacture of the Karphi pottery. Fresh fracture surfaces of sherds coated with gold were analysed at the Laboratory of Electron Microscopy and Micro analysis of the University of Patras using a JEOL 6300 SEM fitted with an Oxford Energy Dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The latter allowed us to complement the study of the microstructure with a semi-quantitative chemical analysis of the clay body. An overview of the analytical data is provided in TABLE 11.2. The samples selected are representative of the petrographic groups and the macroscopic fabrics. The issues examined through SEM/EDS analysis include: a) the nature of the clays used for the manufacture of the Karphi pottery, i.e. non calcareous red clays or calcareous marly clays, according to the qualitative and semi-quantitative compositional data provided by the EDS. b) the firing atmosphere as estimated from the microstructure and degree of vitrification of the ceramic body.21 c) potential similarities and discrepancies between the petrographic and the SEM groups d) comparison with published data from a contemporary site at Kavousi, East Crete.22 The Analysis The results of the chemical characterisation were indicative of the nature of the raw materials used for the manufacture of the Karphi pottery. Three groups were formed on the basis of the calcium content in the clay paste: group 1 is low calcareous (CaO&lt;3%), group 2 is calcareous (CaO~5%) and group 3 is highly 20 E. Nodarou, N. and M.

Below we present the results of the analysis with SEM and we investigate to what extent the compositional groups relate to the petrographic groups and whether we can detect specific recipes of pottery manufacture. A summary of the SEM results and concordance with petrographic groups is provided in table 11.3. Low calcareous group Samples: KAR 06/ 8, 19, 47 (PLATE 29 a) This is a fairly homogeneous group with low Ca (&lt;3%) and Mg (&lt;0.5%) content. Moreover, in this group the values for Si and A1 are the highest among all samples examined. Although we cannot suggest that all three samples derive from the same source, they definitely represent a similar geological environment which is Ca-poor and rich in Si and Al. This composition is compatible with a clayey raw material emanating from the erosion of the Phyllite-Quartzite series. This result matches the petrographic analysis since all three samples belong to Fabric Group 1 (metamorphic) and the main non-plastic component is phyllite in a mica rich base clay. The microstructure of these samples does not show any development of the clay filaments or any degree of vitrification (NV), and this is indicative of a low firing temperature (below 750°C). The samples represented belong to a kalathos and two snake tubes. The colour of the fired clay ranges from grey (for the kalathos) to orange-red for the surface and grey for the core (for the snake tubes). These colours are indicative of a firing atmosphere which is not entirely oxidising.</page><page sequence="354">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINA TION 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 &gt;NC IMC AHC A A a 5 10 CaO 15 Fig. 11.2. Diagram CaO/MgO for the SEM samples Moderately calcareous group Samples: KAR 06/ 32, 78 These samples have a Ca content slightly above 5.0% which indicates a different origin than the samples of the low Ca group. Similarly moderate are the Mg values (2.5% and 4.3%). The Si and A1 components display significantly lower values than those encountered in the low calcareous samples. A clayey raw material containing carbonatic material, of calcareous and dolomitic origin, must have been used. The microstructure of sample KAR 06/ 32 (PLATE 29 b) is indicative of advanced vitrification (V) and the estimated firing temperature is c. 900-1000°C. The sample represented is a snake tube and belongs to Fabric Group 2 which is characterised by the predominance of quartz fragments. The colour of the final product is a bright red surface and a grey core which is indicative of a two stage firing, including a phase of oxidation and a phase of reduction. In sample KAR 06/ 78 (plate 29 c) the micro structure indicates a non vitrified stage (NV), i.e. a firing temperature of 800°C. The vessel represented is a pithos and belongs to Fabric Group 3 (with meta morphic and igneous rock fragments). The colour of the vessel is buff on the surface and the core and it seems to represent firing in oxidising conditions. Highly calcareous group Samples: KAR 06/ 10, 22,31,27, 45 This is a fairly homogeneous group with regard to its chemical composition. The Si and A1 values are close to those encountered in the moderately calcareous samples but the Ca content is much higher, ranging from 9% to 15%. The Mg content is accordingly higher, ranging from 6.1% to 10.6%. This compositional variability is associated with differences in the microstructure and the firing temperature of the samples. More specifically, Sample KAR 06/10 (plate 29 d) has a Ca content of 11.8% and the microstructure indicates extensive vitrification (Vc+). The vessel represented is the skirt of a goddess with upraised hands and belongs to Fabric Group 3 (with metamorphic and igneous rock fragments). The colour of the surface and the core is buff and it represents firing in oxidising conditions. The estimated firing temperature is 850-1050°C. Samples KAR 06/ 27 and 45 (plate 29 e) exhibit similar values for the Ca-content (12.4-13.2%) and similar microstructures. The presence of non developed clay filaments indicates a stage of initial vitrification (IV). The samples represented belong to a stirrup jar and a snake tube and they were classified in Fabric Groups 3 and 4 respectively. The colour of the surface and the core is buff and it represents firing in oxidising con ditions. The estimated firing temperature is 750-800°C. Samples KAR 06/ 22 and 31 (PLATE 29f) have high Ca content (9.4% and 14.3% respectively) and are also at the stage of initial vitrification (IV). The samples represented are a kylix and a snake tube and they belong to Fabric Group 5 (fine red with small quartz frag ments). The colour of the surface and the core is buff and it represents firing in oxidising conditions. The estimated firing temperature is 750-800°C. DISCUSSION OF THE ANALYTICAL RESULTS The petrographic and SEM analysis of selected pottery samples from the settlement of Karphi resulted in a</page><page sequence="355">ANALYSIS OF POSTPALATIAL POTTERY FROM KARPHI rather consistent grouping according to the nature and technology of manufacture of the ceramic vessels. The samples comprised a range of shapes used for domestic purposes (cooking pots, jars, basins, pithoi, serving vessels), but also transport vessels (such as stirrup jars) and religious objects (goddess figures and snake tubes). The petrographic analysis confirmed the macro scopic observations on the fabrics used for the Karphi pottery. The coarse and semi-coarse red fabrics form a homogeneous group and are connected in their majority with mica rich clays containing low grade metamorphic rocks (Fabric Group 1). This fabric seems to represent the local component in the Karphi assemblage since there are outcrops of the Phyllite Quartzite series in the broader area of the Lasithi plateau. In terms of its technology of manufacture this group is very homogeneous: as demonstrated by the study of the microstructure and the semi-quantitative elemental analysis the clay used is Ca-poor and the firing took place in an oxidising kiln atmosphere and under a fairly low temperature. The vessels of this group are mainly used for domestic purposes (cooking and storage) but there are also a few special shapes such as snake tubes. Another category of semi-coarse, red firing ceramics represented by a small number of vessels are connected with metamorphic rocks (Fabric Group 2). It is impossible to differentiate macroscopically this group from Fabric Group 1 because it has the same red colour and phyllitic inclusions. However, the clay paste and the technology of manufacture are different; the microscopic analysis showed that there is a higher amount of quartz whereas according to the SEM analysis the amount of Ca in the clay paste and the kiln temperature are also higher than in Fabric Group 1. The origin of the raw material is uncertain but the snake tubes included in this group are vessels of special use and not domestic wares as the majority of the vessels in Fabric Group 1. The buff fabrics (Fabric Groups 3 and 4) are different in appearance, composition and technology of manufacture. They are connected with an environment of flysch deposits, they are manufactured with Ca-rich raw materials and at higher temperatures than the red fabrics. Also, there is compositional variability within the calcareous group, not seen in the red fabrics, indicative either of greater natural variation in the raw materials used and/or of different provenance. The petrographic analysis demonstrated that, although Fabric Groups 3 and 4 derive from similar geological environments, the clay pastes are different. The SEM analysis confirmed this differentiation and showed that there is also internal variability within Group 3 with the pithos having a lower Ca content and a microstructure indicative of lower firing temperature than the goddess figure and the stirrup jar. This strengthens the argument on the natural variation within the flysch deposits and also the possibility of Fabric Group 4 not being produced in the broader vicinity of Karphi. Within the same technological group of the buff wares belong also the samples of Fabric Group 5. These do not contain any diagnostic rock fragments and there cannot be any secure provenance assignment. However, the technological similarity with the coarse buff fabrics provides an indication that they could be part of the same manufacturing tradition. The presence of material that was not incorporated in any of the major groups is also of interest. The meta morphic small groups and loners are differentiated mainly due to the use of micaceous clay mixes contrary to the main metamorphic group which is not mica rich. This variability is indicative of the use of a multitude of clay sources for the manufacture not only of special vessels such as snake tubes but also of domestic wares. Moreover, there are medium sized semi coarse containers whose provenance remains open to discussion. Whether imported or local these vessels demonstrate that Karphi received products from many production centres and that there must have been many groups of potters and/or workshops operating in the broader area. POTTERY PRODUCTION IN CONTEXT The pattern of pottery production at Karphi as seen from the analysis of selected samples is characterised by common recipes and a similar technology of manufacture for religious objects (such as goddesses with upraised hands and snake tubes) as well as for regular domestic vessels. This is particularly the case for the locally produced pottery of Fabric Group 1 which comprises all kinds of domestic vessels as well as a few kalathoi and snake tubes. The same picture is seen in the buff fabrics. Fabric Groups 3 and 4 comprise pithoi, stirrup jars, as well as ritual implements. It should be noted that stirrup jars are the only vessels that are represented exclusively in the buff wares and are manufactured solely with calcareous raw materials. Considering that they are the transport vessels par excellence it could be suggested that some of them may have been imported to Karphi either per se or for their content. Finally, fine Fabric Group 5 was also used for both domestic wares and ritual implements. The absence of specialised production for the ritual objects matches the picture of the settlement at Kavousi- Vronda,23 and comes in accordance D'Agata's analysis on the LMIIIC cult activities and their social framework.24 The material evidence available suggests the presence of a socio-political system based on non centrally controlled autonomous entities sharing a common ideological structure and a religious system 23 Day et al. 2006. 24 D'Agata 2001.</page><page sequence="356">THE POTTERY FROM KARPHI—A RE-EXAMINA TION with similar codes and symbols. An expression of these common ideologies and practices is to be found in the shared elements of material culture, and the homoge neity seen especially in the clay objects (pottery and religious implements). Goddesses with upraised hands, snake tubes, kalathoi as well as kylikes, deep bowls and pithoi with plastic decoration form part of the pottery repertoire of all LM IIIC sites. However, this homo geneity in religious symbols comes in contrast with the regional differentiations in the architecture and other aspects of material culture as exemplified by a closer comparison between two of the most significant buildings at Karphi and Kavousi respectively.25 D'Agata attributes this phenomenon to different social and political organisation.26 The analysis of the Karphi assemblage demonstrated that this material fits well in the pattern of shared material culture with regional variations, especially when our results are compared to those from the Kavousi project. In both sites an array of recipes is used for the production of religious and domestic ceramic objects but the production is fairly localised. However, the imported ceramics and the variety of imported prestige items such as jewellery and bronzes27 are indications that Karphi was involved in an active exchange network at small or larger scale during the LM IIIC period.
