DOING JUSTICE TO POTEMKIN: PARADOX, OXYMORON AND TWO VOICES IN DERZHAVIN'S "WATERFALL" For the young Pushkin and Del'vig Derzhavin was "the man who wrote 'The Waterfall'." The long ode, whose structural intricacies and complex meanings deserve further study, is usually treated very partially by scholars, who cite its purple passages and hail it as a masterpiece.1 I hope here to reopen discussion of this artistic assessment of Potemkin's career, a unique example of the sophistication of the Catherinian age. It should be of particular interest to historians because Derzhavin's many high governmental posts, particularly his positions as Senator and personal secretary to the Tsarina, gave him a unique vantage point. And this administrator-poet dedicated his greatest odes to his most difficult subjects—to God and to Potemkin. Perhaps the most salient characteristic of "Vodopad, na smert' Potemkina" is the all-pervasive presence of paradox. Defined as "a statement which seems untrue, but proves valid upon close inspection," paradox was central to Baroque poetry. One of the most closely related rhetorical figures is the oxymoron, defined often as a "concise paradox" and usually exemplified by an adjective-noun combination that defies logic on first perusal, such as "dry rain." Oxymoron advances an aspect of Baroque poetry frequent in Derzhavin, namely the striving to fuse all experience into a unity. The quality of fusion differentiates oxymoron from antithesis, which tends to divide and categorize and therefore emphasizes the divergence and opposition of categories of experience.2 De Quincey wrote of the inevitability of paradox in any serious treatment of a human subject "so mysterious is human nature 1. Veiy notable exceptions are the treatments of American scholar Pierre Hart and Russian scholars I. Serman and V. Zapadov whose analyses I have used and cite below. 2. See Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics, eds. Alex Preminger, Frank J. Wamke, and О. B. Hardison, Jr. (Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press, 1974), 598. The most interesting treatment of a "Baroque sensibility" outside of the historical Baroque in Derzhavin's poetry is Claude Backvis, "Dans quelle mesure Derzhavin est-il un Baroque," in Studies in Russian and Polish Literature, ed. Zbigniew Foljewski (The Hague: Mouton, 1962), 72-104.</page><page sequence="2">394 Russian History/Histoiie Russe that almost every weighty aspect of truth on that theme will be found at first sight to be startling or sometimes paradoxical."3 Derzhavin must have felt this to be especially true of Potemkin for "Vodopad" is paradoxical on several levels. Paradox occurs on the semantic level because of Potemkin's complex and contradictory traits, on the level of rhetoric/imagery where the central metaphors for Potemkin are all oxymora—a bright darkness (the root term- dark of Potemkin), a falling rising or falling mountain. On the level of narrative structure the excessive prominence of Potemkin's still living rival Field Marshal P. A. Rumiantsev in the ode introduces paradox of at least two kinds: first, Rumiantsev, usually treated by Derzhavin as the aristocratic paragon of vysokaia grazhdanstvennost', introduces an alternative model of heroism, and the speech of Rumiantsev about Potemkin's life and death introduces an unusual polyphony—the voices of two Derzhavins. The second more interesting Derzhavin, here called II, speaks in the unquoted portions of the ode where he attempts to take a larger view of Potemkin in death, whereas the Rumiantsev passages represent the more usual Enlightenment Derzhavin, more familiar to the reader, here called Derzhavin I. The counterpoint of two distinctly different voices is rare in Derzhavin's oeuvre. It conveys not only the strong sense that he was of "two minds" concerning Potemkin but even the poet's lack of clarity concerning the man and his difficulty in dealing with him as an odic subject. I hope to demonstrate below that in the very paradoxical language and bifurcating structure of this ode Derzhavin makes a concession to the complexity and mystery of Potemkin, the man and national figure, calling forth the proverb embedded in the Prince's surname: "Chuzhaia dusha-potemki." ("Another's soul is a darkness")—something beyond our ken. Paradox in Potemkin and in Derzhavin's Treatment of Him: The Semantic Level The whole thrust of the ode is that Potemkin is exceptional—that the usual rules and therefore usual mode of praising are inapplicable in his case. The essence of the hero here is not the wise bowing to nature's ways or acceptance of human limitations that Derzhavin usually counsels, but the constant wholehearted defiance of the laws of nature and of man. Serman has pointed out that Lomonosov treated Peter the Great as a god4 and Pushkin's treatment of Peter in The Bronze Horseman is certainly in the tradition of the hero as tamer and defier of Nature that Derzhavin presents here. 3.

An uncharacteristic lack of confidence in himself as interpreter and evaluator/judge of Potemkin is strongly implied by Derzhavin in this ode. The implied propositions could be stated thus: I judged Potemkin in life, BUT I am now unsure of my judgments; sometimes the greatest good may be effected by those who have undeniably or apparently BAD traits. This kind of admission is occasionally made in other odes under the guise of religious humility: "The ways of Heaven/God are dark."5 Inability to judge in Derzhavin does not usually apply to human action, but is reserved for God and his miraculous gifts and he effectively places Potemkin in this very category—a miracle of God like a waterfall mountain. Derzhavin's task in this panegyric—to fit the praise truthfully to the qualities and stature of the man—is preemptive of both detracting and sychophantic treatments of Potemkin. Derzhavin implies that petty men will attempt to blacken Potemkin in death by lies out of envy just as those who loved him (his protégé Vasilii Petrov) will extoll him as a Christian saint. For Derzhavin instead the man must be exalted as a superhuman unity of "good and bad." For Derzhavin there was no more point in morally remonstrating with the deceased Potemkin than there would be in censuring a waterfall. Most traditional value judgments in this poem are paradoxically revealed to be simplistic and inadequate. For Derzhavin then, a fitting tribute to such a controversial man as Potemkin must in its language and structure reflect the internal conflicts the author felt characterized that man and the corresponding struggle and perplexity of others, including Derzhavin himself, who endeavored to understand him. While it is known from Derzhavin's autobiographical writings that the poet had never been of one mind concerning Potemkin, only Soviet scholars Serman and Zapadov6 adequately appreciated the degree of Derzhavin's fascination with this hero. Derzhavin had personally been both thwarted and 5. Gavrila Derzhavin, "Na vzyatie Izmaila" (2: 361).

The prince's excesses and foibles were satirized in "Felitse" and later in "Vel'mozha,"8 dedicated to Rumiantsev, Potemkin's less noble sides were emphasized. "Reshemyslu" (1783), an ode written to Potemkin in the "Felitsa" mode, was fraught with ambiguity because the noble traits described therein were not all recognizably Potemkin's.9 In his autobiography Derzhavin claims that during the year of Potemkin's demise the Prince "dragged after him [Derzhavin]," requesting encomiastic verses and indeed the poet did write the poetic choruses and historical Description for the great celebration on the Victory at Izmail in April, 1791 at the Tauride Palace, the most luminous fete ever held in the capital by many contemporary accounts.10 The journal Moskvitianin described the prince in "raiments as diamond-studded as male fashion would allow" with a headpiece so laden with precious stones that Potemkin could hardly wear it. Catherine II is known to have bestowed a diamond-studded laurel wreath upon the Field Marshal at that time." Of Derzhavin's poetic treatments of the living Potemkin "Pobediteliu" (1788) on the Ochakov victory and "Na Vziatie Izmaila" (1790) suggest the vague possibility of a lavish tribute such as "Vodopad." Only three public figures were treated by the poet with consistent deference even idealization: 7. Derzhavin had disagreements with Potemkin as a member of the Preobrazhenskii Regi ment petitioning for a reward for his participation in the Pugachev Rebellion, as the governor of the Tambov province and on other occasions as described by him in his autobiographical Zapiski. Neither his Zapiski nor his poetic treatment of Potemkin justify the view of his political biographer, Clardy, that in the palace feud "he favored the Zubovs principally because he realized that they were then closer to the sovereign than the Potemkins." See Jesse V. Clardy, G. R. Derzhavin. A Political Biography (The .Hague: Mouton, 1967), 129ff. The vicious treat ment of Zubov as Thersites betraying Potemkin in "Vodopad" was a daring and independent stroke, suggesting little fear of Zubov. Had he been so anxious to be in with the Zubovs in 1791 he would not have taken it upon himself to chronicle and write poetry for the Potemkin celebration. Later Derzhavin was in cordial relations with Platon Zubov, but long after the Potemkin-Zubov family feud. Derzhavin consistently sympathizes with the great when they are fallen and Potemkin's clear political losses to Zubov may have made him treat Potemkin more positively in this work, even to the detriment of his [Derzhavin's] own personal interests in the court. 8. The ode "Vel'mozha" (1794), dedicated to Rumiantsev on the occasion of his resumption of a military role in the campaign against Poland that year. It is, however, a reworking of his 1774 poem, praising Rumiantsev as the ideal leader "Na znatnost'." Stanza 3 of "Na znatnost'" has been read as a criticism of Potemkin and the same is true of stanza 8 of "Vel'mozha," which begins "O ty, vtoryi Sardanapal!" Grot, however, notes that it could equally apply to Zubov. 9. Derzhavin, "Reshemyslu," 1: 170-77. 10. Derzhavin, "Opisanie Potemkinskogo prazdnika," 1: 383-95. 11.

The Rumiantsev family, inclnding the general's mother, are used by Derzhavin as the standard of "truly noble noblemen."12 Potemkin's undeniable achievements and sudden death, apparently, forced Derzhavin to rethink the meaning of human greatness and at the very least influenced the poet's decision to avoid sychophantically idealizing a man of mixed qualities. The difficulty of understanding the personality and character of Potemkin was often remarked by contemporaries. It is particularly manifest in the memoirs of the Prince DeLigne, who observed Potemkin at close quarters during the celebrated trip with Catherine II to the Crimea. DeLigne's characterization reads like an extended exercise in contradictio in adjecto.n Derzavin spent three years composing "Vodopad" and finally resorted to the use of paradoxically bound opposing forces.14 Etymology and Potemkin-bound Oxymora Spanning the Entire Ode There are highly developed image clusters which are interwoven into the texture of the entire ode. The central images are a mountain "gora" which by definition rises, but here falls, and the falling water which here also rises. On the level of sound texture, the fact that Potemkin's given name GR i GOR ii repeats the sound g/r twice and includes the root gor of the word mountain, is echoed by Derzhavin. The root GOR meaning hill occurs 7 times, its synonym KHOLM occurs 6. GOR in the meaning of burning associated with 12. This is particularly notable in the ode "Na smert' grafini Rumiantsevoi" (1: 214-21) where the elderly countess is held up as a moral paragon to Princess Dashkova. 13. Le Prince de Ligne wrote of Potemkin: "Je vois un conimadant d'armée (le Prince Potemkin) qui a l'air paresseux, et qui travaille sans cesse; qui n'a d'autre bureau que ses genoux, d'autre peigne que ses doights; toujours couché, et ne dormant ni jour, ni nuit, parce que son zèle pour la souveraine, qu'il adore, l'agite toujours, et qu'un coup de canon qu'il n'essuie pas l'inquiète, par l'idée qu'il coûte la vie à quelques-un de ses soldats. Peurreux pour les autres, brave pour lui; s'arrêtant sous le plus grand feu d'une batterie pour y donner ses or dres, cepandant plus Ulysse qu'Achille; inquiet avant tous les dangers, gai quand il y est; triste dans les plaisirs; malheureux à force d'être heureux, blasé sur tout, se dégoûtant aisément; mo rose, inconstant; philosophe profond, ministre habile; politique sublime ou enfant de dix ans; point vindicatif, demandant pardon d'un chagrin qu'il a causé, réparant vite une injustice; croyant aimer Dieu, craignant le diable, qu'il s'imagine être encore plus grand et plus gros qu'un Prince Potemkin; d'une main faisant des signes aux femmes qui lui plaisent et de l'autre des signes de croix; les bras en crucifix au pied d'une figure de la Vierge, ou autour du cou d'albâtre de sa maitresse; reçevant des bienfaits sans nombre de sa grande souveraine, les distribuant toute de suite." Quoted in Lettres et pensées du Prince de Ligne d'après l'édition de Madame de Staël, ed. Raymond Trousson (Paris: Tallendier, 1989), 184-85. 14. Derzhavin, according to Dmitriev, began writing the nature sections about Kivach prior to Potemkin's death. The ode strictly composed "Na smert' Potemkina" dates 1791-94.</page><page sequence="6">398 Russian History/Histoire Russe brightness occurs 3 times. GROM-thunder, Potemkin's characteristic sound, likewise plays an important role. GROM occurs 16 times, 14 in relation to Potemkin, once to Rumiantsev and once referring to God. SHUM, a synonym of GROM, occurs 9 times. The g/r root GER-oi-hero also occurs 4 times. Given Derzhavin's tendency to play on the sound and meaning of proper names, including his own, the high frequency of GR sounds must be viewed as intentional. It reaches a climax in the depiction of the hero mountain's death: Topa c öoraTCTBaMH ynajia. TpoxoHeT 3xo no ropaM KaK rpOM rpeMainHft no rpoMaM. The mountain with its riches fell. Its echo rumbles o'er the mountains Like thunder booming over thunder. Of course, etymology here is bolstered by the fact that Potemkin actually died in the steppe amidst mountains. The spectacular northern waterfall Kivach, about which Derzhavin began writing before Potemkin's death, is moved to the Crimea for unity of place. Lexical play on the word "Potemkin" is less, if more obvious: it is used as a possessive adjective once and against the rules of such formation "Napishetsia Potemkin trud" ("Potemkin's work will be written") and its sound connection to "potomki," "descendants" is exploited once. The semantics of "Potemkin," literal, figurative, and even in proverbs, however, complements the sound element in the image clusters which dominate the ode. These comprise the extended oxymoron Potemkin and represent the fusion of three traditional oppositions: Vision (Illumination) not seeing (Lack of Clarity) Bright Dark Life Death "Vodopad" contains 25 verbs of seeing and 33 verbs of non-seeing and obstructed vision with the paradox that the closed eyes of the sleeping or even the dead have the most valid "visions." What is seen is contemplated and thought about 7 times and questioned rhetorically multiple times. Of course, in a work with such overwhelming visual imagery seeing—and hearing what one sees—are implied much more than the figures above indicate. Explicit seeing and light/enlightenment are opposed to darkness, in</page><page sequence="7">Justice to Potemkin: Paradox, Oxymoron, and Two Voices in Derzhavin's "Waterfall" 399 Russian "potemki," which figuratively means insufficient understanding. Potemkin, through all the stanzas which engage him, is a partial enigma in life and death. Given the extended oxymoronic character of the imagery, perplexity, "darkness" concerning Potemkin and his mystery is increased by his undeniable resplendance. The mastery with which these paradoxical oppositions are interwoven semantically, thematically, lexically and in imagery is remarkable. The sustained fusion of ostensible opposites confers a kind of unity on a very dispersed poem. oeeing/noi-seeing, comprenension/non-comprenension concern me central event presented visually: the fall of a mountain-hero. There is frequent repetition of action-motion verbs associated with Potemkin's death: 27 verbs oî falling, 17 verbs of crumbling, decomposition/disintegration (passive) and smashing to bits (active), 18 verbs of rising-raising. The falling verbs and downward movement are the most obvious. The title and first three words of the ode include the root pad and the verb sypletsia, a crumbling that is at once falling. The occurrences of the preposition s+genitive, meaning down, off of is very high, 9 times. There is additionally a good deal of gazing down and from on high. Crumbling and being smashed happens on a more horizontal level, prior to falling. Man and the mountain through whom the waterfall flows crumbles, falls apart, disintegrates, is destroyed, pulverized. The trees on the mountain "break into pieces." "Ice formations" try to resist the downward movement and turn into a "glassy dust and fall down," "stones are ground to sand." Man and his achievements are turned to dust, trampled, and so on. This crumbling occurs as a result of putting up a solid resistance to downward movement. Stronger resistance to nature and fate (falling) is the essence of human daring ("derzost"'), standing tall like a mountain or heroic pine and represented by upwards movement. This rising may be temporary but Derzhavin in this ode is determined to eternalize it in words. The great hero keeps rising, even in death. The poet raises him anew. In the first stanza and section upward movement is frequent. The fallen waters try to rise back up the waterfall and stand in watery columns. This description of water standing "in a column" is repeated in Derzhavin's metapoetic description of the dithyramb as a waterfall cited below on page 15. In "Vodopad" the water falls and "b"et vverkh bugrami" ("spurts up in hills"). The line "Ot bryzgov sinii kholm stoit" has a more mundane explanation—that the waters make the mountain look blue, but here the more likely meaning is the unnatural one of waters rising back up after falling. It</page><page sequence="8">400 Russian History/Histoire Russe is indeed repeated in this ode and in "Na vzyatie Izmaila" as an image of heroic men.15 Rumiantsev's heroic regiments grow up "Kak kholmy v more iz tumanov" ("Like hills from fog on the sea"). This is reminiscent of the image of thirty wonderful knights rising from the water in Pushkin's "Ruslan i Liudmila." The most striking such image is that of Potemkin as waters trying to raise their thunder up onto the rapids where Rome stood and shook the world. Potemkin was a hero who, as the expression goes, "stoial goroi" ("stood mountain-tall") for his fatherland. Indeed throughout the ode human achievement is portrayed as rising or on high. The factory near Kivach with its bellows is using falling hydro power to raise things. The military steed who jumps into the waterfall raises his "heated face." Such resistance produces boiling-"kypen'e" and striving "stremlen'e." Falling and death have traditional color attributes in this ode; what is unique is their richness, abundance and oxymoronic combinations. The main underlying motif for this color contrast lies in such titles for Potemkin as "svetleishii kniaz" or "ego svetlost." The fall into darkness for the two heroes depicted here comes at the moment of their greatest glitter and clamor. Potemkin was bestrewn with diamonds a few months before his demise. Rumiantsev was so bright he could not be looked upon or ever extinguished, "v ventse iz molnennykh rumiantsev, otsvechivaiasia v vekakh." ("Shining through the ages in a crown of lightning red suffusions") and suddenly fell into his present "opala" and relative obscurity. The brightness-darkness opposition is clear in the reference to Julius Caesar—who prefigures Potemkin; covered with a dark shroud and "closing his eyelids, coveting the throne," he falls into darkness-death ""ust when he desired the diadem." Velizarius who "fell dead in a dungeon, blinded" is like Rumiantsev thrown down into obscurity despite his loyalty and now no longer hurls bright lighting bolts in battle. Rumiantsev was likewise subject to the same rise and fall as Potemkin: "prevoznesli ego" ("they exalted him") for his brightness. Their falls have both contributed to the dark October night that has descended on Catherine's reign. Potemkin, Derzhavin's oxymoronic bright-darkness, had been infamous for his dark qualities and even called "the Prince of Darkness" by ill-wishers in the court. His soldier's death "on nature's dark bosom," is nocturnal in the poem, although he actually expired at midday. A female figure symbolizing Russian martial death descends to him in black raiments, bearing a shield with a darkened lighting bolt. Yet even in this night of death bright, magnificent epithets are used. When Death collects Potemkin's soul and it 15. In "Na vzyatie Izmaila" the Russian heroes are described "Kak dvignuty bezmolvny kholmy."</page><page sequence="9">Justice to Potemkin: Paradox, Oxymoron, and Two Voices in Derzhavin's "Waterfall" 401 ascends to a dark sky, it bestrews the heavens with stars in its wake. Potemkin's closed eyes and loss of vision are emphasized, but we see him bright and vivid and hear his thunder. Future raising and therefore seeing and hearing Potemkin will be assured by the poet. He will raise his lyre and exalt the hero. Here the raising-falling alternation is sustained: "la vospel tebia-smert' tebia skosila/vospel-sud'ba skhvatila liru iz ruk" ("I raised you up in song, Death mowed you down; I raised you up in song, Fate swept the lyre down from my hands"). This fall of the poet's lightning-hurling (military) lyre to the ground, is paralleled to the fall of Rumiantsev's weapons to his feet. Likewise Potemkin's stone-studded Hetman's "bulava" fell from his hands and the shining of his diamond crown was extinguished: "In the radiance of honors ... he fell onto death's black bed." Crushing to dust and smashing to smithereens of human achievements—is the theme of 57: "Tsarstvy porazit', gigantov v prakh preobrazit', popiraiut geroev v pyly" This disturbing theme is rejoined in 67: "I plot' i trud kol' istlevaiut, Chto zh nashu slavu sostavliaet?" ("If flesh and labor decompose, What then comprises our glory?") The trampled heroes are said to become invisible, dark spots. But in the very next stanza this proposition is strongly negated: "Geroev? Net! No ikh delà iz mraka b vekov blistaiut. ("The heroes? No! For their deeds shine through darkness and the ages"). Crushed bodies and buildings are not vanquished but recompose to rise again: H H3 pa3Ba,'iHH BtJüeTaio r, Out of the ruins they fly KaK xoJiMbi rpoôhi hx UBeTyT. Their coffins blossom like hills HanmueTCJ« IloTeMKMH ipy«. Potemkin's work will be written. Death is the common lot of man, but here it is strangely unexpected. Potemkin is presented at the very least, as a demigod, death-less, bes smertnyj like the Gods of the Greek pantheon and like Derzhavin himself in his later poems, such as "Lebed'." Potemkin's rising coffin is aflame in the bright morning sun. His life had been a burning sacrificial pyre-"Zhizn' zhertvennik torzhestv" and his monument in death is an eternal flame. Potemkin in many stanzas is enshrouded in mystery, as a perplexing subject for contemplation—"potemki" in the sense of something unknown. This mystery is metaphorized in the "dym" (smoke) of the waterfall, and particularly in haze-"mgla." His corpse "lies like haze at the crossroads." The negation and ambiguity surrounding verbs of seeing and understanding throughout the ode leave us questioning whether Potemkin has ever been seen for what he really was.</page><page sequence="10">402 Russian Histoiy/Histoire Russe Genre and Narrative Structure of'Vodopatf The generic form in which Derzhavin chose to treat Potemkin is a hybrid of at least three odic types practiced by the poet earlier: the elegiac ode and meditation on death and human endeavor, the panegyric to the great hero, the military ode commemorating great victories and the edificatory satiric ode on the essence of noblity and virtue. In his 1811 critical work "O liricheskoi poezii ili ob ode," Derzhavin outlines the parameters of the genre and gives two metaphoric descriptions of the ode proper as a river and the dithyramb as a waterfall that bear directly on "Vodopad." In Derzhavin's words the dithyrambic lyric [is similar to] a terrible, raging waterfall which in its mad straining breaks boulders and trees, hurls hills of foam up around itself, it raises up splashes like smoke, high in a column and forces one over a long distance to listen to its terrible rumbling din, so that the head of the traveler standing near begins to spin....(8: 584)16 The ode, on the other hand, is compared to a swift, powerful river [the element of "kratkost" and "edinstvo" of thematic line] pulling everything along with it, sometimes overflowing its banks [multiplicity of themes, lyrical disorder including "oborot"—the turn to related subjects] sometimes jumping between forests and mountains and across rapids ["pereskok"—new striking sounds and syntactic rough spots] sometimes flowing quietly in a straight direction between fields and groves solitary and deep in a single path [reference to mellifluous and thematically clear passages] along which the swimmer [the reader/listener] sees flashing before him vistas which arouse in him, now terror, now dejection, now joy, now ecstasy (8: 584). The obvious relation of both these metaphoric definitions to "Vodopad" shows that in retrospect the poet viewed it as a verbal "river" and a waterfall producing, occasionally dithyrambic, one. A large waterfall is at best a unity in dispersion, containing multiple bifurcating strains, opposing forces and dissension, created by the resistance of the mountain (gora) to the verbal flow {reka). In light of Derzhavin's notion of the Pindaric ode in these descriptions, it is not surprising that "Vodopad" appears disunified even upon close reading. My division of the narrative of "The Waterfall" into two voices and eleven discrete sections gives a clear sense of the reticulating and meandering 16.

It is important at the outset that the reader associate the bright diamond waters with Potemkin as Derzhavin remembered him at the Izmail celebration in a diamond-studded laurel wreath, seemingly at the height of his power and glory, but in fact already a "crumbling mountain," ill, depressed and losing in the court feud with Catherine's current favorite, Count Zubov. The water coursing down, glossed by Derzhavin as representing simultaneouly life, time and glory is imperceptibly grinding the mountain down as it flows over it: "Gora sypletsia" All important in this section is the visual representation of the above-mentioned motif of a falling rising. The waters fall, but columns of water defy gravity and rise up. This introduces the pervasive motif of the hero as a defiance of the course of nature—an anti-natural "hill," of water and stone which reverberates with the sound g/r of "grom." In stanzas 5-9 three animals confront the waterfall in a nature setting where Potemkin's demise is about to occur. Glossed by Derzhavin, the wolf represents malice, the deer, meekness and the horse in military trappings-represents the human martial quality of reckless daring, ambition, all traits that had been attributed to Potemkin in different contexts. The increase in tameness and unnatural reaction of these animals to the fall is instructive. The horse representing human ambition against all instinct throws itself into the perilous waters. His presence thus foreshadows the ambition and daring of the fourth human onlooker, the wise warrior, Rumiantsev. Section II (stanzas 10-17) [Rumiantsev-Derzhavin I] Meditation on Life, Glory, and the Meaning of Heroism Like the three animals, Rumiantsev confronts the waterfall. Not named at first, his identity is signaled by repeated references to his family name "Kak vecher vo zare rumianoi" ; later this is echoed in his dream of his past where his last name sounds in the genitive plural formation of the word rumianec. Perched dangerously on a ledge overlooking the fall, Rumiantsev is presented with the fixed traits that define him throughout: "sedina"—grey hair=wisdom, "glubokaia duma"—thoughtfulness, "mgla"—haze=perplexity. He utters the several standard interpretations of the waterfall symbol mentioned above. Stanzas 13-16 are a powerful discourse on the "Fall of the great" replete with ubiquitous forms of the verb "to fall" Here the Roman parallel for Potemkin is Caesar, associated with diamonds and diadems. The desire to be a Tsar implied in "the eyelids which coveted the throne closed"</page><page sequence="13">Justice to Potemkin: Paradox, Oxymoron, and Two Voices in Derzhavin's "Waterfall" 405 is subtly attributed by Derzhavin to Potemkin elsewhere. Rumiantsev's role is prefigured in Velizarius, the Byzantine general who, proclaimed king by a vanquished tribe, declined the honor out of loyalty but was nevertheless unjustly punished. The specific contrast clearly appears to be more flattering to Rumiantsev than Potemkin, despite the greater fame of Julius Caesar. At the end of 16 Rumiantsev recalls the height of his glory from the depths of his enforced returement, and falls into a deep sleep. Section III (stanzas 17-19) [Poet-Derzhavin II] Resumption of Anthropomorphized Description of the Site After the numerous falling verbs of section II, this one begins with the "fall" of night, which is associated throughout the ode with the "darkness" of Potemkin and his death. The related themes of blindness, closed eyes and inability to see, sounded in section II in reference to both commanders recur. A snow-capped mountain—most likely representing the "gray-haired" Rumiantsev —sees a dispersed wave and crumbling stone in stanza 22. The poet—Derzhavin II—does not see Potemkin: "la nichego ne vnemliu, Krome revushchiia volny, O kamni s vysoty drobimoi" ("I hear nothing except a roaring wave, dispersed from above against the boulders,") but Rumiantsev does: ""I snezhnoiu goroiu zrimoi" ("And seen by a snowy mountain.") On close reading it becomes clear that the deserted spot is Rumiantsev and Potemkin spread out upon the space. It is a poeticized approximation of the Crimean historical locale of Rumiantsev's and Potemkin's triumphs, whether military, administrative or diplomatic—and of their respective "falls." The second Turkish War would have been considered a triumph for a lesser man, but in Potemkin's case it was generally viewed as the downfall of a stellar career mainly because his diplomatic initiatives, known as the Greek project, were so grandiose.17 The moment of the death, the synchronic focus is between the fall of the evening glow—"vecherniaia zaria"=Rumian tsev, and the fall of darkness=Potemkin. The anthropomorphization of the place accords completely with the geography-bound titles of the two field marshals: Rumiantsev-Zadunayskii, "beyond the Danube," and Potemkin, Tavricheskii, "Crimean." For the patriotic Derzhavin both these "falls" bring an October night to Catherinian Russia. The observing mountain, Rumiantsev, sat "vzor vperia k vodam" ("fixing his gaze on the waters") and sleeping and here the natural setting is given the same traits: "Pustynia, vzor nasulia svoi Utesy i skaly dremali."("The deserted place, strained its gaze, The cliffs and boulders 17. Isabel de Madariaga, Russia in the Age of Catherina the Great (New Haven, CT: Yale Univ. Press, 1981 ), 384-86,408.</page><page sequence="14">406 Russian Histoiy/Histoire Russe slumbered.") This spatial allegorization continues when the personified moon representing the Islamic enemy whom Rumiantsev had defeated in the first Russo-Turkish War peers down and pales upon recognizing her old enemy, the sleeping elder. The motif of Turkish fright at the sight of both Rumiantsev and Potemkin recurs in the ode. Section IV [Derzhavin I] (stanzas 20-31) Rumiantsev's Reverie-Reminiscence about his Past and Fate These two dream sequences both open with the words "On spit, on spal." The long dream presents Rumiantsev's military feats and prowess in the dynamic visual imagery typical of odes on military triumph. The great military strategist is here a sorceror, unseen by the enemy, working magic on the battlefield. This panegyric passage conjures up in terms of excessive exaltation the height of "silver-gray" Rumiantsev's seemingly incomparable brightness: Hto Bepx cpeßpHCToro wejia, B BeHUe H3 MOJIHeHHblX pyMHHueB, EjiHcraeT b öyaymHx poaax, OrcBeHHBaHCJi b cep/inax. That the top of his silvery brow, In a crown of lightening red suffusions, Shines for future generations, Radiating in their hearts. These memories of Rumiantsev's brightest days had already been "darkened" by the fact of his "fall" from favor and present relative obscurity in stanza 15. The opposition of two heroic types is here fully prepared. Rumiantsev concludes of himself that he has no equal, but this is not borne out in the ode. The dark-brightness that is Potemkin ultimately outshines the grey eminence, Rumiantsev. This is in accordance with epic tradition-the enemy or rival of the great hero must himself be of a similar or comparable status. The section continues with Rumiantsev's second and this time prophetic dream, his vision of a mountain falling (stanza 29). This was foreshadowed in section III as mentioned, when the snowy mountain "saw" another in the process of crumbling. In 28 the fall is predicted with various nature omens and in 29 the vision of the [blind] sleeping seer is presented with a sound texture rivalling those of Tsvetaeva:</page><page sequence="15">Justice to Potemkin: Paradox, Oxymoron, and Two Voices in Derzhavin's "Waterfall" 407 Oh cjibimHT coKpyuinnacb ejjb CiaHHua BpaHOB BCipeneTajia KpeMHHCTijft xo/im aaji crpauiHy mem Topa c 6oraTCTBaMH y nana TpoxoMer 3xo no ropaM KaK rpoM rpeMiHimft no rpoMaM.18 He lists: a fir tree crumbled, A raven flock stirred up The hill of flint cracked frighteningly, The mountain with its riches fell, Its echo rumbles o'er the mountains Like thunder booming over thunder. The vision ends with a Russian Athena-like grim reaper bringing death to Potemkin and awakening Rumiantsev who utters his succinct interpretation of the dream: "A certain leader has perished, you know." It becomes clear in the next section that he knows exactly who has died. Section V (stanzas 32-38) Rumiantsev's [Derzhavin I] Qualified Encomium and Lament for Potemkin This pokhvala is unusual because from its opening lines it qualifies its praise for the fallen hero with "kogda" "kol" clearly expressing approval for Potemkin only when his actions meet a certain moral standard: EjxaaceH Koraa, CTpeMacb 3a ciiaBofl Oh noiib3y oömyio xpaHHJi. Blessed was he when seeking glory He kept the common good in mind. It is a credit to Derzhavin's sophistication that this is not a niggardly, begrudging praise that any reader would reject as unfair. It is a reasonable encomium which lists some of Potemkin's most positive qualities and achievements. In stanza 34 Rumiantsev-Derzhavin I admires the ambition 18. Tsvetaeva's "Poema gory" shows clear signs of being influenced by the imagery and the sound texture of "Vodopad," particularly the centrality of a hill and the repeated element of a sound unit, in Tsvetaeva gr and gr+d, the words hora, hore, hrad, horod, hrot.and so on. In her article on the "new Derzhavin," émigré poet N. P. Gronskii who died in 1934, Tsvetaeva specifically says that she recognizes herself in every line of Derzhavin's "Vodopad."</page><page sequence="16">408 Russian History/Histoire Russe that spurs men on to superhuman feats, characterizing the waterfall-mountain hero in an orgy of adjectival short forms: BejiHKOJieneH, cbcttt, npercpaceH, HyaeceH, CHJieH, rpoMOK, nctn.

This contrast of destructive and useful greatness is phrased in rhetorical questions, which are left more open than most in Derzhavin's oeuvre. It seems that Russia may occasionally need a Potemkin-type superhero—beyond good and evil or beyond the usual standards of moderation'^ Rumiantsev ends here expressing the wish that a traveler will write an epitaph affirming not only Potemkin's martial prowess but also his greatness of soul He TOJIbKO C/iaBHblfl JlHUJb BOttHOfi 3aecb CKpbiT BejiHKHfl Myac ßymoft. 19.

So far in "Vodopad" Rumiantsev is not able to write such an epitaph himself. His praise remains qualified and anbivalent: O 6yab 6eccMepreH, bhtjbi. öpaHHhifi, Koida mbi eecb coôawa ceoU do ai.

Gazing with his characteristic pensiveness into the heavens, Rumiantsev falls silent. Section VI (stanzas 39-49) The Poet's [Derzhavin II] Observations of Rumiantsev and the Death Site Here the poet espies a rigur walking through the mountains and witnesses the ascent of Potemkin's soul. After this a long series of apostrophes to the corpse is deliverd by the poet [Derzhavin II], who pretends not to know or to be unable to believe that the fallen hero is Potemkin in the series of stanzas beginning "Whose corpse .... whose bier?" In 43ff. the would-be answers are again questions: "Is it not you?' and finally end in a recognition series: "Lo, it is you Potemkin." Now Derzavin II presents Potemkin's career in greater and more positive detail without the reservations given in "Rumiantsev's" voice [Derzhavin I]. Stanzas 43-48 treat Potemkin as a "miracle, the fruit of heaven's gift, a wonder of nature herself," whose power for good and evil and unfathomability are certainly not less than those of a waterfall. Potemkin's activities defy nature. Just as the waters in the first stanza defied gravity, Potemkin here is presented as a river which flows upwards onto the hills of Rome. Many of Potemkin's achievements represent the total domination of Nature: "Potrias sredu zemli gromami" ["sreda zemli"= Constantinople] ("He shook the earth's center with his thundering"). Like Peter the Great in Mednyi vsadnik he controls nature:</page><page sequence="18">410 Russian History/Histoire Russe Oh [IloTeMKHH] 3naii cthxh caMbie nonpan&gt; ...

This section in its admiration, awe, and incredulousness at the existence of such a miraculous hero outshouts the calmer encomium of Rumiantsev reaching a dithyrambic fever: "Lo, it is you! Oh, wonderous leader Potemkin!" Section VII (stanzas 50-54) The Poet's [Derzhavin II] Lament Stanzas Having powerfully established how Potemkin should be praised, Derzhavin II goes on to show how he should be lamented. At this point the poet switches sharply to a tone of sincere sadness. Typical of the genre of prichitanie it dwells on the effects of the death on the living: on Derzhavin, the troops, the Tsarina, half the world. The interrupted peace negotiations with the Turks and the mourning Petrov, Potemkin's protege are treated in 53.20 Sudden bereftness and shock dominate this section. Stanza 54 depicts the incident at the Prince of Wiirtemburg's funeral that same year at which a grief-stricken Potemkin, stumbled and fell on his friend's funeral bier. This striking psychological vignette shows in a touching manner Potemkin's passionate fondness for his comrade and prefigures for the reader and perhaps for Potemkin himself, his own imminent "fall." 20. The lengthy title of Petrov's funereal ode gives a clear sense of its content: "Plach na konchinu ego svetlosti kniazia Grigoriia Aleksandrovicha Potemkina Tavricheskogo 1791 goda oktiabria piatogo dnia prestavivshegosia v vere k bogu, v liubvi k otechestvu, v zhelanii blag rodu chelovecheskomu, muzha vsemi vysokimi titlami, no pache krotost'iu siiavshego, pokrovitelia nauk, pobedonostsa, mirotvortsa vsem prosveshchennym, vsem blagorodnym dusham vozhdelennogo, pochtennogo, prisnopamiatnogo."</page><page sequence="19">Justice to Potemkin: Paradox, Oxymoron, and Two Voices in Detzhavin's "Waterfall" 411 Section VIII (stanzas 55-59) The Poet's [Derzhavin II] Meditation on Life, Glory and the Meaning of Human Endeavor A reprise of Rumiantsev' s meditation in section III This section, as Rumiantsev's, repeats numerous themes of "Na smert' Kniazia Meshcherskogo" and the unfinished slate ode (his last), with the important difference that Derzhavin in this poem will defy the death of the superhuman Potemkin and his legacy of achievement. We remember Derzhavin's pious and philosophical acceptance of death in his final work [a view here associated with Derzhavin I]: Peica BpeMeH b cbocm TeneHHH Y HÖCHT Bee aejia nioaca, M TonHT b nponacTH 3a6ßeHKH Haportbi, uapcTBa h uapeft H ecjiH hto h ocraeTca...

And should anything last— Eternity's maw will devour it too, It will not escape the common fate. Stanzas 55-57 represent similar characterizations of the human condition and reaffirm the fatalistic view of life of Derzhavin I, but they will be powerfully countered by Derzhavin's defiance, in the continuation of this section that is Section X. Pierre Hart has quite rightly emphasized the life afffirming tenor of this ode.21 Section IX [Derzhavin II] {stanzas 60-66) Reversion to Nature-presenting Nature's reaction to the fall of the mountain.

The "dark night" of Potemkin's death is contrasted with the frightened "bloody moon," the vanquished foe. Rumiantsev again associated with the "vecherniaia zaria" sits positively allegorized now as Love, apparently purged of his envy. Here in a move that blends the two lamenters, Rumiantsev and the poet, Derzhavin I and II. Rumiantsev is given the zither of a poet and Derzhavin's lyre is given martial qualities—it throws lightning. Again the elder, as the traveler of whom he had spoken, confronts the rising grave monument of Potemkin, "a hill upon a hill," but in a mood of Christian love. This interesting section, which appears to revert abruptly to Nature actually cites the lasting results for Russia of Potemkin's military and political deeds, the reasons why he must be loved and his foibles overlooked. Section X [Derzhavin II] (stanzas 67-69) Return to Meditation of Section VIII. Defiance of Death Here Derzhavin undercuts his usual fatalistic position on human achievement. Potemkin's is the life that will or should escape this fate. This is one of Derzhavin's strongest defiances of death, replete with anger at its unfairness. He personally refuses to allow Potemkin to be forgotten, and seems particularly incensed and pained at the idea that worms would dare to feast on the body-head of this hero. Compared by the poet to Alcibiades and Achilles, Potemkin is shown betrayed by Thersites-Count Zubov in the very wake of his passing. Stanza 68 defends the truthfulness of this panegyric—it is true that Potemkin does not fit Derzhavin's standards perfectly. With a name like Potemkin some darkness was to be expected. It is equally true that he was probably the greatest figure in the Empire save Catherine. Section XI [Derzhavin II] (stanzas 69-74) Generalizing Moral Coda and Tribute to Catherine, the Inspirer of Waterfalls. Here the poet first turns to the still living and future "Waterfall mountains of the world" whom Catherine, the river Suna, may engender to "love truth." To those "vel'mozhi" the usual standards will more easily and readily apply. In 70-71 he addresses the singular waterfall of this ode as "Thou" exhorting Potemkin's memory to live on undarkened in men's minds. Potemkin, a living oxymoron in the first place, had contained his darkness as part of his essence; his whole life and therefore his memory should live as an unfathomable shining darkness.</page><page sequence="21">Justice to Potemkin: Paradox, Oxymoron, and Two Voices in Derzhavin's "Waterfall" 413 The fact that the river is the Tsarina is hidden in the words "ot zar' goriashcha" where the sound tsar' is hidden in typical Derzavinian fashion in t zar'. This was later glossed by the poet. In the final lines of the ode, the all-engendering Suna-Tsarina is compared to a deity as her flood waters pour into Lake Onega. ************ Analysis "Vodopad's" reticulating, called by Hart "unsystematic," narrative reproduces the emotional experience of witnessing the fall of a mountain/hero. Its structure is convoluted and subtle. The reader sees (1) the poet who sees (2) the waterfall-mountain and sees (3) General Rumiantsev who in his turn first sees: (4) the mountain fall in a prophetic dream and then awakens to see that his dream has come true. The motifs of seeing and static verbs of contemplation, thinking, and watching, so abound in the work that they suggest to the reader that he rethink the meaning of Potemkin's life death and not accept ready answers. The poet, Rumiantsev, the Turkish enemy, the Russian soldiers at Izmail, Catherine, the entire court and even a series of allegorized animals ponder and react to Potemkin and his sudden fall in fear and amazement. Approximately a third of the narrative presents Derzhavin s version of the viewpoint of Potemkin's rival Rumiantsev in indirect discourse or quoted speech. I therefore divided the several sections into the poet's [Derzhavin II] and Rumiantsev's [Derzhavin I]. Most of the judgmental material on Potemkin is placed in the mouth of Rumiantsev, whose rectitude in Derzhavin's previous treatment of him would give him the moral authority to judge his fellow warrior. This separation of the various meditations on greatness, death, martial prowess and the meaning/mean inglessness of human endeavor into the poet's and Rumiantsev's views brings the contemporary controversy surrounding Potemkin boldly into the ode. Rumiantsev is here doubly used: as a character he is a foil for Potemkin, an alternative model of heroism; as a first-person narrator he is an alternative Derzhavin. The authority of Rumiantsev's position here however, is seriously undermined by the motive of envy. Derzhavin attributed this motive to Rumiantsev in this period and later, in the poem "K lire" (1797) Derzhavin concludes "No zavistlivoi sud'boiu, Zadunaiskii konchil vek" ("But Zadunaiskii was fated to end his life in envy") (2:135). Yet in calling Rumiantsev's judgments into question Derzhavin is more likely questioning his own prior poetic assessments of Potemkin. This use of Rumiantsev is very subtle: his evaluation of Potemkin is ambiguous, but balanced and was probably acceptable to most Enlightenment readers (and a younger Derzhavin). Here Derzhavin is not satisfied with it nor will he let his reader</page><page sequence="22">414 Russian History/Hisloire Russe be. The rational appeal of Rumiantsev's moralizing viewpoint and of the elder general himself add to the subtlety: Rumiantsev is shown bearing injustice with great dignity; he weeps profusely at the death of Potemkin and shows a good deal of fairness towards his fallen rival. Though he was only about fourteen years Potemkin's senior, Rumiantsev here as an archetypal wise elder embodies the conventional moral wisdom of the age, something Derzhavin often does, but which he unexpectedly challenges in this ode. The ode contains a long tribute to Rumiantsev—one that elicits a chuckle because it is Rumiantsev's own very immodest dream/vision of his past deeds and glory. Rumiantsev always was and remained a kind of hero mountain Derzhavin fully understood. Here Rumiantsev is made to pay tribute to Potemkin and Derzhavin then corrects and partly invalidates that tribute by his own more dithyrambic one to Potemkin, a hero of a kind that perplexed, dismayed and amazed them both. This conflicted tribute honestly engages Potemkin's less positive traits but towards the end of the ode Derzhavin II resolves the conflicting elements into one unified voice. Hart is quite right when he calls this reticulating narrative an "unsystematic thematic progression." He points out that nature to which the ode repeatedly returns is "more than a parallel to man's life," so heavily is it permeated with human endeavor and achievement.22 Comments on the natural setting comprise the central narrative core of the ode sections I (9 stanzas), III (3 stanzas), VI (11 stanzas), IX (4 stanzas) and XI (6 stanzas) for a total of 33. They are presented by Derzhavin II, the more authoritative of the two poetic voices. The meditative and encomiastic sections on Rumiantsev and Potemkin are evoked by contemplation of the natural setting and bifurcate off from it. Rumiantsev's three sections—II, IV and V— comprise a full 25 stanzas, setting up a thesis on life, heroism and Potemkin, a credible position which is paradoxically undermined by Derzhavin II's discussion of the selfsame subjects in the reverse order in 15 stanzas in VII, VIII, and X. The justification for these corrections has overtones of Christian love and respect for the dead but include other important factors: (1) the glorious results of Potemkin's service to the Empire and, (2) the unworthiness of envy of the great or any petty emotions in their evaluation. Derzhavin very shrewdly has Rumiantsev introduce the theme of Envy. In stanza 27 the older general says it is impossible to envy a figure as great as himself: [Rumiantsev thought about himself:] HtO 3aBHCTb OT erO CMHhX Cboh ÖJieanbitl noTynjiaeT B3op, 22. Ibid., 74</page><page sequence="23">Justice to Potemkin: Paradox, Oxymoron, and Two Voices in Derzhavin's "Waterfall" 415 CpeflH 6e3M0JiBH0i 0 CTenaiibfl riOJT3eT H HmeT TOKMO HOp.

Such was his resplendence That Envy lowers its pale gaze Amidst the silent moans She creeps and only seeks a hole Where she might hide from him, And how no one can compare with him. This increases the irony when Derzhavin imputes this very motive to Rumiantsev. Rumiantsev's Encomium to Potemkin in section V certainly seems envy-tinged, especially when compared to Rumiantsev's dithyrambic praise of himself. When Derzhavin II corrects Rumiantsev's praise of Potemkin, he implies censure for Rumiantsev's envy. This, as indicated heretofore, is in some measure a censure by Derzhavin of his own treatment of Potemkin in life. Similar considerations have led Hart to question whether Derzhavin himself envied Potemkin.23 Rumiantsev's envy and rivalry with Potemkin is bolstered by historical evidence thaï he believed that Potemkin engineered his demotion. Contemporaries generally knew and rumored about this rivalry. The overweening presence of Rumiantsev in "Vodopad" is an example of Derzhavin's artistic daring and flair for the dramatic. This is especially the case since Potemkin hated Rumiantsev to be praised beside him and was furious that Derzhavin made glowing references to Rumiantsev and Suvorov in his verses for Potemkin's Izmail celebration in this very year. Similarly, Rumiantsev must have been displeased with the figure Derzhavin made him cut in this great ode. Perhaps the 1794 ode "Vel'mozha. K Rumiantsevu" where Zadunaiskii regains his usual idealized image, was Derzhavin's attempt to atone for the way he used him in "Vodopad." Rumiantsev's distinct voice disappears from the ode at the end of section V, stanza 38, lines 5-6. From then on Derzhavin II, the more authoritative correcting voice, takes over and dominates "Vodopad." He not only sees Potemkin's soul gathered to Heaven, but presents his own lavish unreserved praise of the Prince, one that emphasizes the latter's immmortality and superhuman status. The height of this praise, reached in stanza 47 indeed exceeds anything Derzhavin ever dedicated to Rumiantsev or almost anyone else. Potemkin cannot, must not, die: he is only 23. Ibid., 78.</page><page sequence="24">416 Russian History/Histoire Russe "apparently a dead man," as Derzhavin was later to say of himself.24 His life death is a thing of beauty, an aesthetic phenomenon as Serman has emphasized in his important comments on this ode: The titanic image of Potemkin created in "The Waterfall" could only be measured aesthetically, not ethically. The aesthetic approach to people and events in the ode relegates everything else to the background. Derzhavin the poet overwhelmed Derzhavin's moral-philosophical convictions, which failed to explain all the complexity of historical reality. Derzhavin the poet cannot free himself from the fascination Potemkin's grandeur and fame exerted upon him. Thus there arises [in the ode] a conflict between moral and aesthetic ideals. The most fundamental Enlightenment idea—the idea of the absolute opposition of good and evil is cast into doubt....25 Serman's point concerning the aesthetic appreciation of a life is clearly present in the ode. Indeed, the poet's last invocation to the now dead "kasaiasia stranam vozdushnym" ("touching airy lands") waterfall-Potemkin is "Live by your beauty alone." If one considers the ode as a whole, however, it is apparent that Derzhavin undergoes a much more serious réévaluation of his moral standards here than Serman indicates. He does not merely forget about Rumiantsev's-Derzhavin's attitudes as Angelo Ripellino has suggested,26 he compromises them, without negating their validity for most men. This is clear in stanza 69 which is a moralizing reprise of Rumiantsev's qualified praise of Potemkin, here directed to future national heroes. In the next stanza, 70, we see that the generalizations of 69 are not applied to the singular "waterfall" of this ode. Derzhavin resolves to keep its sound and beauty, now invisible due to the mountain's fall, alive eternally and in stanza 71 to protect it from all unfair detractors, moral or other: &gt;Khbh, h TyHH npoöeraJiM, Htoô peflKO no tbohm BoaaM, Te6x b yMax He 33TMeBaJin PaaacaceHHutt rpoM h nepHbitt ahm.

The compromise of Rumiantsev is important. He ceases to speak in stanza 38, but in 68 an allegorical figure appears with many of Rumiantsev's epithets and qualities: riofl ape bom npn 3ape BciepHett, 3a;iyMMHBO jiioöoBb chaht. Ot UHrpa Bei cpoK bccchhhH Ee noBcioay rojioc mhht. Under a tree in evening's glow Love sits pensively. The vernal wind from a zither Hurries love's voice everywhere Derzhavin wrote that part of this stanza refers to lady admirers who wore medallions of Potemkin, but the quoted lines are lexically associated with Rumiantsev in this ode: in stanzas 9-10 "kak vecher vo zare rumianoi, Sidit ... v glubokoi dume rassuzhdaet" ("like evening in its rosy glow, He sits ... pondering in deep thought") and in 38: "i glas ego promchalsia, glas mudryi vsiudu razdavalsia" ("And his voice hurried forth, That wise voice reverberated everywhere"). There is textual grounds for viewing this figure of allegorized Love as a morally transformed Rumiantsev, apparently convinced to this change by the intervening lament and encomium of Derzhavin II. This transformed figure, like the traveler (the word "elder" here was also used for Rumiantsev earlier) comes to Potemkin's grave in a different attitude in 66. In 67 and 68 no reservations in praise are acceptable. The compromising of Rumiantsev and the warmth and protective attitude towards Potemkin in the second half of the ode is more than Derzhavin II's aesthetic fascination with Potemkin's power and magnificence and it is more than the abstract challenge to the Enlightenment notion of the absolute opposition of good and evil that Serman suggests.27 It has a considerable personal, moral component. Hart is right to raise the issue of Derzhavin's possible envy of Potemkin because the poet is examining his motives here. In 1791 when he had considerable contact with the failing Prince Derzhavin's comments on those last meetings show vacillation and perhaps even sympathy for the man who recognized his talent and artistic independence: 27.

Near the end Derzhavin formulates the poet's morals here: "Only truth gives wreaths, the lightning bolts of whose sweet lyres will never stop sounding" and "Only the idol created by the truthful/righteous man is sacred" and leaves "Vodopad" as his definitive word on Potemkin. We are right to assume that this ode represents not only the aesthetic, but also the "righteous" and truthful treatment of the subject. A mixture of good and bad motivations can characterize the poet as well as as Potemkin. And this is one of the few cases where the confident and headstrong Derzhavin actually corrects himself. In an attempt to do justice to Prince Potemkin, if only in death, Derzhavin exposes his own inner conflict, cleanses himself of any unworthy motives and leaves posterity one of the greatest tributes to a national figure ever written.
