Burger Analysis of the animal bones recovered from the excavations of residential contexts at Chavin de Hudntar reveals a mixed economy that included the herding and hunting of camelids (llama and vicuna) at Chavin de Hudntar as early as the Urabarriu Phase (900-500 B.C.). It also suggests that a pattern of trade in dried llama meat (ch'arki) from high altitude environments (punas) to lower ones had developed by the Chakinani phase (500-400 B.C.), while the consumption of hunt- ed animals (especially deer) sharply declined in importance. During the apogee of Chavin de Huintar (400-200 B.C.), socioeconomic stratification is reflected in differential access to tender meat from younger animals. The role of Chavin de Hudntar in the spread of camelid pastoralism and the importance of highland 'vs. tropical rain forest animals in Chavin ide- ology is discussed as well. El andlisis de los huesos de animales recuperados durante las excavaciones de contextos residenciales en el sitio arque- ologico de Chavin de Hudntar revela que una economia mixta basada en el pastoreo y caza de camelidos (llama y vicuna) florecio durante la fase Urabarriu (900-500 A. C.). Asimismo, sugerimos que un patron de intercambio de carne de llama deshidratada (ch'arki) existia entre los asentamientos de las alturas (punas) y el valle bajo durante las fases Chakinani (500-400 A.C.) y Janabarriu (400-200 A.C.) mientras que el consumo de animales silvestres, como venado declinaba dramaticamente en importancia. Durante el apogeo de Chavin de Hudntar, la estratificacion socioeconomica se manifesto a traves del acceso diferencial al consumo de animales jovenes. El rol de Chavin de Hudntar en la expansion del pastoreo de camelidos y la importancia relativa de los animales de la puna vs. los de lafloresta tropical en la ideologia Chavin son aqui brevemente discutidos. Next to this town of Chavin is a large building of huge very well-wrought stone blocks; it was a huaca, and one of the most famous of the heathen sanctuar- ies, like Rome and Jerusalem with us; the Indians used to come and make their offerings and sacrifices, for the Devil pronounced many oracles from here, and so they repaired here from all over the kingdom. There are large subterranean halls and apartments, and even accurate information that they extend under the river which flows by the huaca or ancient sanctu- ary [Vazquez de Espinosa 1948 (1632): 458]. -M vfore than three centuries have gone by since Vazquez de Espinosa's commen- tary. And although the town of Chavin de Huaintar is today just one of a multitude of small district capitals in highland Peru, the archaeological site next to it has taken on an importance analogous to Rome or Jerusalem for specialists in Peruvian archaeology. During the mid-Early Horizon (ca. 500-250 B.C.), the influ- ence of Chavin de Huaintar was felt from the Lambayeque Valley to the Ica Valley on the coast and from northern Cajamarca to Ayacucho in the highlands, and radical shifts in metal and textile technology, ceramic style, religious ideology, and other aspects of culture were often associated with these new patterns of interaction (Burger 1988, 1992a). The profound impact of Chavin de Huantar on the emergence of complex societies in the Andes led Donald Lathrap (1973:92) to write: I would suggest that any attempt to understand the civilizing effects of agriculture in the Central Andes must ultimately face up to the problem of the agricultural basis of Chavin de Huantar and the state that it ruled. Unfortunately, investigations at Chavin de Huafntar were traditionally confined to the zone George R.

Consequently, most dis- cussion of the agricultural basis has focused on the only available "hard data," which, in this case, are the approximately 150 stone sculptures that once decorated the temple buildings. The fascina- tion with the iconography of these carvings is understandable: Their beauty and sophistication is perhaps unparalleled in Peruvian prehistory. Gordon Willey (1962), for example, considered them to represent the "first great art style" in Peru, and Alfred Kroeber (1947) believed they were among the greatest works of Prehispanic art in the Americas. Chavin stone carving is rich in representations of tropical forest animals and, in one famous piece, of lowland plants. However, the light shed on Chavin de Huantar's subsistence systems by the iconographic studies of these sculptures has not been illuminating. In fact, the identification of the animals and plants represent- ed raises more questions about the basis of Chavin economy than it resolves. A more direct approach is called for in order to begin to explicate the subsistence system underly- ing the success of Chavin de Huantar and, ulti- mately, to grasp how the ideological messages encoded in these exotic iconographic themes are related to the social reality of those worshipping at the Chavin de Huantar temple. Fortunately, excavations in the habitation area surrounding the public architecture at Chavin de Huantar have yielded material evidence of the site's prehistoric economy. This article will focus on the changing patterns of animal use in the mixed agricultural system practiced there. Analysis of the faunal remains allows us to go beyond the problem of dietary reconstruction to consider the way in which animal products were differentially pro- duced and consumed in a complex and stratified "formative" society. Before proceeding, however, some background material will be summarized on the environment of Chavin de Huantar and the archaeological context of the remains under con- sideration. The Environment Chavin de Huantar is located in the Mosna Valley at 3,150 m asl in the north-central highlands of Peru (see Figure 1). To its west is the Cordillera Blanca, whose glaciated peaks often exceed 5,500 m, and to its east is another somewhat lower, but equally steep mountain range, the Cordillera Oriental. The topography is rugged and the slopes surrounding the site have steep gradients, com- monly 45 percent or more. Consequently both landslides and erosion are serious problems in the area. Chavin de Huantar lies on the valley floor at the juncture of the Mosna River with one of its tributaries, the Huachecsa. These rivers are part of the Pukcha drainage that eventually empties into the Marafion, a major tributary of the Amazon River. Chavin de Huantar has an environment typ- ical of the high intermontane valleys of Peru and does not resemble in its topography, climate, or vegetation the tropical forest to the east. The trip down to the eastern lowlands from Chavin de Huantar is a difficult one requiring several weeks. The journey would have been made on foot, since the Mosna like all highland rivers is not naviga- ble. A six-day walk is needed just to reach Arancay, the point on the Marafion where tropical forest products first become available. At present, rainfall at Chavin de Huantar ranges from 750 to 1,042 mm annually (1971-1975 figures) with an average of 855.8 mm per year. Most precipitation-87 percent- falls during the rainy season from October to April, but enough occurs during the remaining months to support perennial grasslands. During the dry season, nightly frosts are common at ele- vations above 3,300 m and on rare occasions they even affect the valley floor (Burger 1983). Thus, it is feasible to produce traditional Andean freeze- dried items such as ch'arki (freeze-dried meat) and chuho (freeze-dried potatoes) on a seasonal basis at high elevations. Using the Holdridge system of classification, the Oficina Nacional de Evaluaci6n de Recursos Naturales (ONERN 1976) identifies three major life zones in the Chavin de Huantar area. The environmental zonation is largely a function of altitude, and quite different life zones consequent- ly are compressed into a relatively small area. It is possible to walk from the lowest to the highest zone in less than two hours. The lowest life zone is the "tropical mountainous humid forest" (bb-MT); it occurs between 3,100 and 3,300 m elevation. This zone, which includes Chavin de Hufntar itself, corresponds roughly to the production 422 [Vol. 60, No. 3, 1995</page><page sequence="3">ANIMAL UTILIZATION AT CHAVIN DE HUANTAR, PERU 10 15 Figure 1. The location of Chavin de Huantar in relation to other archaeological sites (o) mentioned in the text. zone referred to as the kichwa or quechua (Pulgar Vidal 1970:75). The kichwa is the only irrigated zone, and maize, fruit, and other crops sensitive to frost are traditionally grown here. Natural precipitation is sufficient to support rainfall agriculture, but supplementary irrigation reduces the risks involved, especially on the val- ley floor, which receives less rain than the higher elevations. The next life zone defined by the ONERN study is the "tropical mountainous very humid forest" (bmh-MT) between 3,300 and 3,800 m, which comprises the upper slopes and high meadows. This zone, also known as the suni or jalca (Pulgar Vidal 1970:89-90), is esteemed by farmers because of its dependable rainfall, good drainage, and rich soil. The native crops grown here are potatoes, tarwi, quinoa, ullucu, oca, achis, and mashua, roughly in that order of importance. The uppermost zone of economic importance is the "tropical subalpine pluvial paramo" (pp- SaT) locally referred to as the puna. This life zone begins at 3,800 m elevation to the east and Miller and Burger] 423</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY 4,000 m to the west of Chavin de Huantar and ends at 4,800 m where grasslands can no longer be sustained. Now used primarily as pasture land for cattle and sheep, older residents recall llamas being kept in the early years of this century. These vast grasslands also constitute a rich natural habi- tat for a variety of wildlife, including vicufia, deer, spectacled bear, skunk, and partridge (perdiz). Several lines of evidence indicate that the climate was similar, but not identical, to the modern pattern during the time period under con- sideration (900-200 B.C.) (Cardich 1985). We can begin to get a better sense of the impli- cations of these life zones for the ancient subsis- tence economy by calculating the amount of land in each life zone within a 10 km radius of the Chavin de Huantar center (see Figure 2). While the kichwa zone represents a mere 4 percent of the land surface, the suni habitat, favored for high- altitude agriculture, makes up almost 36 percent of the land. The remaining 60 percent of the land lies within the puna zone, and consequently, grasslands were among the most abundant land resources available locally. While the edge of the grasslands can be reached from Chavin de Hu'antar in an hour or less, it is more time con- suming to reach some of the upper slopes and more distant grassland from the valley floor. Because of this, only 13 percent of the population in the district of Chavin de Huantar lived in the valley-floor center in 1961, while the remaining 87 percent resided in small villages and hamlets whose mean settlement size was 107 people. The most frequent location of these villages is just below the grasslands in the uppermost zone of high-altitude farming. Chavin de Huantar was established in an area with rich agricultural potential, particularly for rainfall agriculture on the valley slopes and herd- ing in the vast pasture lands. Irrigation agricul- ture, on the other hand, would have had limited possibilities. The agricultural resources of Chavin de Huantar are by no means unique. Innumerable other locations in this region offer comparable opportunities for mixed farming. There are, how- ever, few locations that are equally advantageous from the perspective of interregional trade and communication. In the highlands, topography often determines patterns of travel, and the Cordillera Blanca, in particular, presents a formi- dable barrier because of its perennial glaciation. Because this range runs parallel to the coast, it separates the peoples of the central coast from the rich highland valleys of the Callej6n de Conchucos and the lowland zones farther east. For travelers entering the southern portion of the Callej6n de Huaylas, there are three passes to the east: Two lead into the headwaters of the Mosna and one into the headwaters of the Huachecsa. The trails that lead over the passes meet at Chavin de Huantar. Other unglaciated passes exist in the central and northern Callej6n de Huaylas, but none as low as the pass (4,700 m) above Chavin de Huantar. If the snow line had been more than 100 m lower (Cardich 1985) at certain times in the late Initial Period/Early Horizon, some of the alternative routes available today would have been impassable. Thus, Chavin de Huantar is ideally suited as a gateway community. Moreover, it is centrally located, roughly midway between the coast and the eastern lowlands and, analogously, nearly at the midpoint between the dry puna Andes to the south and the moister ptramo Andes to the north. This location is particularly advanta- geous in the context of panregional networks of exchange. The Archaeological Background of Chavin Relative chronologies have been developed for Chavin de Huantar using ceramic, architectural, and iconographic evidence (Burger 1984a; Rowe 1962). The faunal materials considered in this article were dated on the basis of associated pot- tery, which, in turn, was associated with 14C sam- ples. The ceramic sequence developed in the set- tlement surrounding the temple (Burger 1984a) will serve as the basis for the discussion here. The Chavin occupation at Chavin de Huantar has been divided into the following three sequential phases spanning the late Initial Period and the first half of the Early Horizon: the Urabarriu phase (900-500 B.C.), the Chakinani phase (500-400 B.C.), and the Janabarriu phase (400-200 B.C.). The Old Temple is believed to have been estab- lished during the Urabarriu phase, while the New Temple flourished during the Janabarriu phase. The above estimates of absolute ages are derived from the analysis of 22 radiocarbon measurements 424 [Vol. 60, No. 3, 1995</page><page sequence="5">ANIMAL UTILIZATION AT CHAVIN DE HUANTAR, PERU LIZI KICHWA (Area of irrigation agriculture) LEi!

The site began during the Urabarriu phase as a relatively small ceremonial center covering 1.5 ha surrounded by several hectares of habitation. The occupation was limited to the western bank of the Mosna, but spanned both sides of the Huachecsa. A wall exceeding 160 m in length was built 1 km north of the public architecture, apparently to control movement along the trail on the valley Miller and Burger] 425</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY floor. A small habitation area, referred to as Sector B, was located a short distance to the south of the wall. The population in Sector B probably did not exceed 100 residents, and it is unlikely that more than a few hundred permanent residents surrounded the temple at this time. The site grew notably during the subsequent two phases, as the temple gained interregional prominence. It covered 15 ha by the Chakinani phase and 42 ha during the Janabarriu phase. After the Urabarriu phase, the wall and the adja- cent habitation area were abandoned, and popula- tion focused around the public center. The Janabarriu-phase population has been conserva- tively estimated at between 2,000 and 3,000, and it would have been one of the most populous Early Horizon settlements in the Central Andes at this time. This expansion was accompanied by an increasing diversity of activities and some of the first unambiguous indications of socioeconomic stratification documented in Peru. Throughout the sequence much evidence indi- cates the importance of long-distance exchange at Chavin de Huantar. The valley-floor center was the central place in a regional system consisting of a multitude of small villages and hamlets, many of which were located near the upper limits of agri- culture, while others were located on the lower slopes or valley floor. An archaeological survey conducted by Hernan Amat (1971, 1976) failed to locate late Initial Period/Early Horizon sites with- in the puna zone; but it is probable that the grass- land resources were exploited by communities liv- ing at lower elevations, particularly in the upper suni zone. Several of these rural sites have been briefly described in the literature (Espejo 1951, 1955, 1961; Tello 1960), and two of them, Pojoc and Waman Wain, have been sampled with test excavations (Burger 1983). The occupants of these small settlements shared the belief system best known from the valley-floor center, and several of them had places of worship featuring Chavin-style sculpture. It is likely that much of the labor and support for the Chavin de Huantar center came from villages like Pojoc, rather than the residential area immediately surrounding the site. At the same time, there are more exotic items in these small sites than the residents of a village could normally acquire on their own, and it would appear that the benefits of supporting the temple were economic as well as spiritual. As noted, the agricultural base of Chavin de Huantar is poorly understood. Little direct evi- dence exists of the cultigens grown there, but it seems probable that maize, squash, beans, and Ilcunma would have been cultivated on the valley floor, while potatoes, oca, ullucu, and perhaps quinoa would have been grown in the suni zone. All of these cultigens have been documented at coastal, and in some cases, highland sites of the time period in question (Cohen 1978; Martins 1976; Ungent et al. 1983), and it is reasonable to assume that they were incorporated into the Chavin de Huantar economy. Charred maize ker- nels were recovered from both Urabarriu and Janabarriu contexts at the site (Burger 1984a:254), but recent isotopic analysis of human skeletal remains of the Urabarriu and Chakinani phases indicates that maize, the sole C4 plant eaten in the Prehispanic Peruvian highlands prior to the conquest, was not the main dietary staple. Cultigens that follow the C3 photosynthetic path- way constituted the bulk of the diet, and consider- ing the ecology the Chavin de Huantar area, it is likely that the potato and other high-altitude tubers and grains were the dietary staples (Burger and van der Merwe 1990).' Relative Abundance of Animal Taxa The 1975-1976 excavation of the secular precincts of Chavin de Huantar yielded a great quantity of animal bone, and it is the analysis of these remains that constitutes the core of our dis- cussions here. Excavations were small scale, and the faunal remains were recovered either in situ or as a result of passing all the soil matrix through a 4-inch screen. Careful troweling permitted the recovery of small rodent and fish bone, although some bias against the recovery of microfaunal remains probably existed. All of the excavated units were in or around late Initial Period and Early Horizon habitations and most of the bone samples came from these domestic structures or more extensive refuse deposits adjacent to these households. In some instances, refuse was found in platform fill or other secondary domestic con- texts; such materials were only considered when the deposits were culturally homogeneous and 426 [Vol. 60, No. 3, 1995</page><page sequence="7">ANIMAL UTILIZATION AT CHAVIN DE HUANTAR, PERU Figure 3. Plan of the ancient site of Chavin de Huantar and adjacent town, showing the locations of excavation units mentioned in the text. showed no evidence of temporal mixing. A description of the specific excavation contexts and an interpretation of their depositional history have been published elsewhere (Burger 1984a: 11-36, 328-335). From the total excavated faunal assemblage we selected a research sample representing each of the three Chavin chronological phases: Urabarriu (900-500 B.C.) from Units Bi, B2, B3, B4, B5, and B7; Chakinani (500-400 B.C.) from the lower strata of Unit D1; and Janabarriu (400-200 B.C.) from the upper strata of Unit Dl and Units A4 and A5 (see Figure 3). The faunal assemblage was identified and analyzed by Miller and several students from the Department of Anthropology, California State University, Hayward. The total sample consisted of 12,672 bone fragments (33.205 kg), of which 2,252 (16.580 kg) could be identified to species, genus, or family. The Chavin de Huantar faunal assemblage, during all three phases, reflects a pattern com- mon to most prehistoric sites in the Peruvian highlands: The vast majority of animal protein was obtained from artiodactyls of the families Cervidae and Camelidae (see Figure 4). Smaller food species, such as viscachas (Lagidium peru- anum), guinea pigs or cuyes (Cavia sp.), and small birds were eaten occasionally by the resi- dents of the site but appear never to have been of major dietary importance. The preponderance of cervids and camelids is supported whether the method of quantification used is numbers of fragments (NISP), minimum numbers of individ- uals (MNI), weight of dry bone, or weight of usable meat (although it is more extreme with the latter two methods, which tend to emphasize carcass size). Urabarriu Taxa Of the three phases at Chavin de Huantar, the Urabarriu assemblage demonstrates the greatest faunal diversity. In addition to the predominant artiodactyls, the Urabarriu residents made minor use of fish, Pacific Ocean shellfish (Burger 1984a:255-261), an unidentified bird, guinea pig, viscacha, skunk, and a canid that may have been either the Andean fox (Dusicyon culpaeus) or the 427 Miller and Burger]</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Camelid JANABARRIU 93% (400 - 200 B.C.)

Of special interest among the non-artiodactyl bones were two worked and polished proximal radii of large felids (Burger 1984a:213-214, Figures 422 and 423), either puma (Felis concolor) or jaguar (Felis onca). If from jaguars, they were probably obtained far to the east, because these animals rarely occur above 1,000 m elevation (Rodriguez de la Fuente 1975:203). Pumas, although present locally, are scarce and difficult to hunt. As no other felid bones were identified in the Chavin de Huantar refuse, it is possible that these rare bones were acquired specifically for bone working because of the symbolic importance of large felines in the ideology of the Chavin culture. Compared to the subsequent phases, the most salient character of the Urabarriu faunal composi- tion is the larger percentage of cervids used dur- ing this time (Figure 4). Cervids constitute between 9.8 percent and 30.8 percent of the total Urabarriu faunal assemblage, depending on the method of quantification used, and this percent- age actually may be slightly higher, considering the number of Urabarriu bones that were classi- fied as "indeterminate artiodactyl" (either cervid or camelid) because of their high degree of frag- mentation. Based on diagnostic antler fragments, these deer were probably all white-tail (Odocoileus virginianus), although the taruka (Hippocamelus antisensis), another species of cervid present at high altitudes in the area today (Grimwood 1969:83), may be represented in the postcranial remains. On the other hand, neither of the smaller species of Andean deer, the brocket (Mazama spp.) or the pudu (Pudu mephistophe- les), was present in the Urabarriu sample. Today these smaller deer tend to occupy the ceja de selva zone to the east of and generally at a lower altitude than Chavin de Huaintar (Grimwood 1969:74-80). Their absence in the Urabarriu assemblage may indicate that this tropical low- land environment fell outside of the normal catch- ment area of Chavin de Huantar. This tentative conclusion is reinforced by the total absence of other bone remains from distinctive lowland ani- mals, such as the tapir or the woolly monkey. While the relative abundance of Urabarriu deer is noteworthy compared to their marginal impor- tance during the later two phases, the exploitation of cervids at Chavin de Huantar, even during ear- liest times, seems not to have assumed the impor- tance that it held at other relatively contempora- neous sites in the northern highlands.

Evidence derived from sites with Initial Period/Early Horizon occupations such as Huaricoto, Huacaloma, Kotosh, Guitarrero Cave, and Pacopampa (Burger 1985; Sawyer 1985; Shimada 1982, 1985; Wing 1972, 1980; Daniel Morales and Alfredo Altamirano, personal communication 1987) shows that the valley dwellers of the northern highlands main- tained their dependence on deer much later than populations living in the high grasslands farther to the south. On the puna of Junin, only 200 km to the south of Chavin de Huaintar, deer hunting had given way to reliance on camelids by the fifth millennium B.C., and a pastoral economy based on domesticated llama and alpaca is documented there from several sites such as Telarmachay and Pachamachay between 3500 B.C. (Wheeler 1984) and 2200 B.C. (Kent 1982). The intermontane valley populations to the north of Junin, however, were slow to adopt this technological innovation (Matos 1976, 1978). As summarized in Figure 5 the northern high- land pattern changed dramatically sometime after the middle of the Early Horizon (ca. 500 B.C.), when all available data point to the sudden inte- gration of camelid pastoralism into the subsis- tence economy of most kichwa zone populations. At Chavin de Hu'antar, however, the record is dis- tinct.

Curiously the Urabarriu faunal profile, rather than resembling Early Horizon sites such as Huaricoto, Pacopampa, Huacaloma, or Kotosh, is more reminiscent of the situation found at Early Horizon sites far to the south, such as Marcavalle. There, in the Valley of Cuzco, by the mid-first millennium B.C., camelids already constituted 89 percent of the usable meat remains (Miller 1979:161). As will be discussed below, the early embrace of camelid pastoralism by the people of Chavin de Huantar may, in fact, have played an important role in the vigor of their economy and the unprecedented influence of the Chavin cult. To understand the importance of camelids in the Urabarriu economy and the aforementioned contrasts, we must first know which of the camelids species were present at the site. Four separate forms of the family Camelidae are found in the Andes today: the llama (Lama glama), the alpaca (Lama pacos), the guanaco (Lama guanicoe), and the vicufia (Vicugna vicugna). Although the taxonomy of the South American camelids is still a matter of considerable debate, both historical and ethnographic evidence show that the four forms have functioned in distinct ways at least since Inka times. Llamas were used principally as pack animals and secondarily for coarse fiber, while alpacas were used for their fine and abundant fleece. Both of these domesti- cates were also used for meat and religious sacri- fice. Guanacos and vicufias, on the other hand, were never domesticated and were obtained only through hunting, including, in the case of the vicufia, the strategy of community drives. The main use of the guanaco seems always to have been meat, whereas the vicufia was also caught and shorn for its extremely fine fiber. Given these functional differences, our understanding of the people that labored in construction of the Old Temple and worshipped there will be greatly enhanced by identifying which of the camelid varieties sustained them.

The zooar- chaeologist is fortunate, however, in that the four species exhibit a definite size gradient; i.e., in general, it is observed among contemporary camelids that guanacos are larger than llamas, lla- mas larger than alpacas, and alpacas larger than vicunas,2 and hence the bone measurements of contemporary animals may be used as a baseline with which to judge the identities of unknown archaeological bones (Kent 1982; Miller 1979; Wing 1972). When pairs of measurements from Urabarriu camelid bones are plotted over identical measure- ments from modern camelids of known identities, the Urabarriu measurements cluster in a clear bimodal fashion with a distinct gap between the clusters. Figure 6 provides an example of such a scatterplot from a particularly well-represented element, the proximal first phalanx. The distinct bimodality of the phalanges' measurements is mirrored by all other Urabarriu camelid elements that occur with sufficient frequency to plot. The two camelid varieties seen in Figure 6 appear to have been separate, homogeneous breeding popu- lations, an interpretation that seems to be sup- ported statistically by the low coefficient of vari- ation values presented in Table 2. Due to the overlap in llama-guanaco size and in alpaca-vicufia size, however, the exact identity of the Urabarriu camelid populations is somewhat more difficult to establish. Scrutiny of Figure 6 suggests only that two distinct camelid popula- tions were present during Urabarriu times, but whether they were domesticated llamas and alpacas, wild guanacos and vicunfas, or some other combination is beyond the resolution of the bivariate plot. Statistical tests comparing the Urabarriu osteometric data with known compara- tive camelid species also yield ambiguous results. For instance, t-tests comparing the means of mea- surements from the Urabarriu small camelids and the comparative species sometimes indicate vicufas and sometimes alpacas, but the fit is inex- act in either case. The means of Urabarriu large camelid measurements tend to match llamas more closely than guanacos, but the fit is not precise here either (Table 3).

Note the low V values, which may be taken as an expression of population homogeneity (Simpson et al. 1960). archaeological camelids far removed from the geographical origin of most of the camelids in the comparative collection (i.e., the southern high- lands of Peru for most of the llamas, alpacas, and vicufias, and Tierra del Fuego for the guanacos). The size and representativeness of the reference collection is presently insufficient to compensate for the variations in camelid body size that may result from breeding strains and/or environmental differences along the Andean chain. Regrettably, osteometric analysis based on modern reference collections provides an essential, but as yet, low- resolution window into the taxonomic identity of archaeological camelids. If it were not for the pivotal position that Chavin de Huantar and the Chavin cult occupied in Andean culture history, such large camelid-small camelid, low-level resolution might be considered adequate. The Urabarriu phase at Chavin de Huantar, however, stands pre- cisely at the threshold of a series of technologi- cal innovations that swept through the northern highlands and the north coast of Peru during the Early Horizon and the Early Intermediate peri- ods. To know whether these changes were found- ed on and/or facilitated by an established agropastoral economy is extremely important to our understanding of Andean prehistory. Lacking precise and unequivocal diagnostic tools with which to identify the Urabarriu camelids, we are forced, therefore, to emphasize factors of cultur- al context and environmental setting, as well as somewhat indirect arguments, to give meaning to the rather imprecise osteometric guidelines. It is mainly in reference to these cultural and envi- ronmental parameters that we make the follow- ing species judgments. We hope that these will function as working hypotheses until such time when the taxonomic identity of the Chavin de Huaintar camelids can be tested by more rigorous scientific means. Considering the presence of llamas and alpacas for over 2,000 years on the puna of Junin just 200 km to the south of Chavin de Hu'antar (Browman 1974a; Kent 1982; Wheeler 1984) and the assertion that llamas (Pozorski 1976, 1979; Shimada and Shimada 1985) and perhaps alpacas (Shimada and Shimada 1987) were well estab- lished on the north coast by the late Initial Period or early Early Horizon, it is tempting to bypass the aforementioned complexities of camelid iden- tification and simply conclude that the Urabarriu bimodal clusters represent domesticated llamas and alpacas. This interpretation must be summar- ily rejected, however, because of the structure of the bimodality. Examination of Figure 6 and other Urabarriu data reveals that there was virtually no overlap between the small camelid and large camelid populations. This degree of separateness is unlike the situation observed among contempo- rary llama-alpaca populations and at Inka period llama-alpaca sites such as Qhataq'asallacta (Miller 1979:152) and Huanuco Pampa (Wing 1988: Figure 3) where the larger population com- monly grades into the smaller population, proba- bly because of occasional interbreeding between 432 [Vol. 60, No. 3, 1995</page><page sequence="13">ANIMAL UTILIZATION AT CHAVIN DE HUANTAR, PERU Table 3.

In contrast, the Urabarriu camelid populations appear to have been repro- ductively isolated. Secondly, the degree of dimorphism observed between the large and small Urabarriu popula- tions makes llamas and alpacas unlikely. Put sim- ply, the size distance between the large popula- tion and the small population more closely resembles the vicufia/guanaco or vicufia/llama distance than it does the alpaca/llama distance. This distance may be expressed as the index of dimorphism, D=Xs where D equals the index of dimorphism, ~x equals the mean of the measure- ment from the small population, and, Xi equals the mean of the measurement from the large popula- tion. Expressed as a percentage, D provides a measure of the average size of the small popula- tion relative to the large one. In Figure 7 the D values of four Urabarriu camelid measurements are graphically presented along with the camelid D values from several other contexts. From this figure it can be seen that the Urabarriu D values hover around the 75 percent level and appear much closer to those recorded for comparable vicufia/llama measurements than they do to com- parable alpaca/llama measurements. Similarly the Urabarriu D values resemble more closely those that we have calculated from Preceramic sites in the puna of the Callejon de Huaylas (Wing 1973) than they do for sites for which the two domesti- cated camelids were clearly dominant, such as Inka Tarma near Junin and Qhataq'asallacta in Cuzco or the Early Intermediate Period occupa- tion at Chavin de Huantar designated as P1RC (Wing 1973). If the Urabarriu camelid popula- tions had consisted of only llamas and alpacas, we would expect the D values to be at or above 85 percent, but since they are not, we must seek can- didates for the mystery camelids of Urabarriu other than the domestic pair. We judge that a significant proportion of the large Urabarriu camelids were domesticated lla- mas based on the following factors: (1) Some of the large Urabarriu camelid measurements match the reference llamas quite well (see Table 3), (2) domesticated llamas were a mainstay of the Chavin de Huantar economy during the terminal Janabarriu phase, (3) some of the Urabarriu camelids had apparently consumed considerable quantities of maize, probably in the form of post- harvest fodder (panca), judging from stable-car- Miller and Burger] 433</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY 95- hataqasallacta --K&gt; . ..... 7 .

Osteometrically the large Urabarriu camelid measurements do not fit the llama parameters exactly, however. Scrutiny of Figure 5 and Table 2 reveals that some of the Urabarriu camelids were significantly bigger than modern llamas. In gen- eral, the large Urabarriu measurements average slightly larger than modern llamas and slightly smaller than modern guanacos.3 We suspect that this osteometric inflation of the large Urabarriu group is because the sample contains a few gua- naco bones in addition to those of llama. Large camelids of the approximate size of the Urabarriu large camelids have been reported from several earlier and contemporaneous sites in the puna of the Callej6n de Huaylas (Wing 1973). With justi- fiable caution, Wing identifies these animals only as "large camelids," but it is highly probable that they were guanacos (Lynch 1980:314) because of both their chronological and environmental prove- nience. That the Urabarriu residents of Chavin de Huantar occasionally hunted these guanacos seems quite likely. We interpret the small Urabarriu camelids to be primarily vicufas on the basis of the following evidence: (1) some of their measurements fit the vicufia parameters quite closely, (2) the presence of one definite vicufia incisor in the Urabarriu sample demonstrates that the residents of Chavin de Huantar exploited vicufias at least occasional- ly during this time, (3) wild vicufias are present today in the grasslands to the west of Chavin de Huantar in the Parque Huascaran, (4) the relative- ly high frequency of cervid and viscacha bones, as well as 26 projectile points, indicate that the Urabarriu people were actively engaged in hunt- ing. A logical extension of their deer hunting would have been the hunting of vicufias, and (5) as noted above, camelids of vicufia size have been reported from several earlier and contemporane- ous sites in the puna zone of the nearby Callej6n de Huaylas (Wing 1973). In terms of osteometrics, however, identifying all the small Urabarriu camelids as vicufias is somewhat problematic. The small camelid mea- surements fit the vicufia parameters reasonably well, but as can be seen in Table 2, they consis- tently exhibit slightly larger mean values than modern vicufias from the southern highlands. 0 E - Q o E 0 a0 x 85- 75 - 434 [Vol. 60, No. 3, 1995</page><page sequence="15">ANIMAL UTILIZATION AT CHAVIN DE HUANTAR, PERU Although unconfirmed by detailed observation, the average body size of vicufias is suspected to decrease from the southern extreme of their range to the north (De la Tour 1954:347; Novoa and Wheeler 1984:121). Finding vicufias of greater average size at Chavin de Huantar in the Department of Ancash (10?S) than in the Department of Puno (15?S) would fly in the face of Bergman's Rule and the general tendency of populations within the same mammalian species to have less body bulk near the equator, while those with greater bulk are found farther from it. It could be suggested, of course, that the Urabarriu small-camelid sample may also not be pure. If even a few alpacas had been consumed by the Urabarriu residents, the osteometric mean of the mixed sample might very well resemble that of the Urabarriu small camelids. Such an inter- pretation, however, is fraught with difficulties. If the small Urabarriu camelids were judged to be alpacas, their disappearance during later periods at Chavin de Huantar, a fact to be discussed below, would have to be explained in terms of a temporary and failed experiment in northern alpaca raising. Moreover the hypothetical pres- ence of late Initial Period or Early Horizon alpacas in northern Peru (Shimada 1982, 1985; Shimada and Shimada 1987) has not been con- vincingly demonstrated (Miller and Gill 1990; Kelgard 1989). Significantly, alpaca fiber does not appear on the north coast until the time of the Gallinazo culture (200 B.C.-A.D. 200) and does not occur in quantity until nearly a thousand years later (Conklin and Moseley 1988:155-156). In summary, we believe that the Urabarriu fau- nal assemblage represents a transitional phase in the animal procurement strategy of the people in the northern highlands. It was a time of mixed hunting and experimental herding. Paralleling the pattern observed to the west in the Callej6n de Huaylas (Lynch 1980:314), the hunters of Chavin de Huantar appear to have shifted the focus of their activity from the nearby kichwa slopes to the high-altitude puna grasslands, and in doing so, from the white-tail deer, Odocoileus virginianus, to the wild camelids, both guanacos and vicufias. At the same time domesticated llamas were beginning to be introduced from the puna areas to the south. At Chavin de Hufntar during the Urabarriu phase, camelid bones outnumber cervid bones by approximately 6 to 1. On the basis of 81 camelid bones well enough preserved for measurement, we judge roughly 55 percent of the Urabarriu camelids to have been llamas and the remainder vicufias-the identity of each of these populations being somewhat clouded by an occasional closely related camelid form that entered the Chavin de Huaintar system. Chakinani Taxa The faunal assemblage from the intermediate Chakinani phase (500-400 B.C.) of Chavin de Huantar, because of its small sample size, pro- vides a rough but important picture of subsistence behavior during the time of the expansion of the Old Temple. The diversity of Pacific Ocean shell- fish consumed at the site increased somewhat during this phase with the addition of a species of scallop, Argopecten purpuratus. The volume of shellfish utilization, however, remained insignifi- cant with a MNI of only 6. In contrast, the mam- malian fauna changed significantly (see Figure 4 and Table 1) with an approximate fivefold reduc- tion in the percentage of deer over the previous Urabarriu phase. A concomitant increase in the frequency of camelids signals the virtual replace- ment of the earlier mixed hunting/herding pattern with one devoted almost exclusively to the camelids. Although the Chakinani faunal sample is too small to permit serious statistical evaluation, mea- surable bone fragments suggest that the nature of camelid exploitation was also undergoing a sig- nificant shift during this time. Measurable bones indicate that both large and small camelids were still present during the Chakinani phase, but that the large variety had come to predominate over the small by a ratio of approximately 2:1. As with the earlier Urabarriu phase, we tentatively inter- pret the larger camelids as introduced llamas and the smaller as vicufias. Osteometric analysis of the Chakinani large camelid bones indicates that they fit the parameters of modern llamas quite well. The guanacos that may have elevated the osteometric profile of the earlier Urabarriu large camelids seem not to have been hunted during Chakinani times. Supplementing this camelid- dominated animal diet were a small number of Miller and Burger] 435</page><page sequence="16">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY other mammals, the viscacha, and an unidentified canid. The guinea pig was not represented in the Chakinani fauna-not to be taken as a sign of the abandonment of cuy raising but rather a reflection of the small sample size. The most interesting additions to the verte- brate fauna during Chakinani times were several marine fish specimens; no freshwater species were identified. The absence of freshwater fish is consistent with the current poverty of riverine life in the Mosna and Huachecsa rivers. The appear- ance of marine species of fish at Chavin de Huantar was due probably to the importation of dried fish. This item has traditionally played an important role in highland-coast exchange, and dried fish are still commonly seen in the markets of Chavin de Huantar and the Callej6n de Huaylas. The dietary importance of exotic marine fish and mollusks may be greater than their small numbers would suggest. Their significance may have been as a source of supplementary iodine and salt rather than of protein or calories. Janabarriu Taxa The diversity of shellfish remains continued to increase during the Janabarriu phase, which is contemporaneous with the New Temple and the period of maximum expansion of the settlement. A total MNI of 25 shellfish representing 14 sepa- rate species of mussels, clams, scallops, gas- tropods, crustaceans, and polyplacophora are rep- resented in Janabarriu-associated deposits (Burger 1984a:258). Nevertheless, they constitut- ed only a minor item in the total diet. Of the three phases represented at Chavin de Huantar, the Janabarriu phase (400-200 B.C.) provides the largest vertebrate sample (see Table 1). In contrast to the increased diversity of inver- tebrates, the exploitation of vertebrate taxa became quite specialized during the Janabarriu phase with camelids achieving an almost total monopoly of the diet. With the exception of single bird and rodent specimens, along with 10 poorly preserved marine-fish bone fragments, the only wild vertebrates in the assemblage are represent- ed by a few deer bones (1.56 percent of the total bone weight). The people who expanded the site of Chavin de Huantar to around 42 ha during Janabarriu times seem to have nearly abandoned the exploitation of wild fauna in favor of domes- ticated llamas. Figure 8 provides one example of this pattern of increased specialization-i.e., 95 percent of the 201 Janabarriu camelid bones suit- able for measurement were derived from llamas. This pattern of Janabarriu species abundance was independently confirmed in the analysis of 917 identifiable bone fragments not included in this study from Unit Dl-floor 1 and Unit Dl-floor 2 and performed at the Laboratorio de Paleoetnozoologia in Lima (Cardoza A. and Pozzi-Escot 1977). We interpret the large Janabarriu camelids to be llamas for the following reasons: (1) The almost total absence of hunting-associated evi- dence derived from Janabarriu contexts suggests that the Janabarriu people relied on domesticated stock. (2) Janabarriu patterns of both differential representation of body parts and mortality/man- agement are distinct from those observed in the Urabarriu sample. These differences are interpret- ed as reflecting the harvesting of domesticated stock and are discussed in detail below. (3) Measurement of Janabarriu camelid bones indi- cates that only one homogeneous population was present at this time. Most of these measurements fit reasonably well with comparable measure- ments derived from modern llamas (see Table 3). It is important to note, however, that in all cases the Janabarriu measurements average significant- ly smaller than comparable measurements from the Urabarriu phase and slightly smaller than the comparative llama measurements. This apparent diminution in large camelid size between Urabarriu and Janabarriu times may be simply a statistical artifact of the elimination of the few guanacos that we have suggested were hunted by the Urabarriu occupants. This same decrease in average size through time is also evident, however, in the measure- ments of llama-size bones from two other con- temporaneous sites in the north-central highlands of Peru. Comparable osteometric data on camelid proximal first phalanges are available from Huacaloma (Shimada 1982:329) and Huaricoto (Sawyer 1985, personal communication 1990). Figure 9 summarizes these data and illustrates the tendency of large camelids in the north-central highlands to decrease in size from late Preceramic 436 [Vol. 60, No. 3, 1995</page><page sequence="17">ANIMAL UTILIZATION AT CHAVIN DE HUANTAR, PERU .. . ? - 0 x x x 0 0 * x A D n z&lt;1 ? x Guanaco 0? o Llama A A AD Alpaca AA A A Vicuina * Janabarriu 25 30 35 4 40 Maximum Width of Glenoid Cavity (mm) Figure 8.

Seen at its most extreme at the site of Huaricoto (Chaukayan phase, ca. 2200-1800 B.C., to Marcaraf phase, ca. A.D. 400-600), this diachronic change represents a more than 20 percent decrease in phalanx width. Several other bone dimensions were checked for further evidence of this diachronic diminution: Chavin de Huaintar, five bone dimen- sions; Huaricoto, three bone dimensions (Sawyer, personal communication 1990); Huacaloma, three bone dimensions (Shimada 1985:302). With only minor inconsistencies, all cases exhibited the same tendency: a 10 to 20 percent decrease in the size of large camelids from the earliest period to the latest. The cause of this phenomenon is as yet unknown. We suspect, however, that it is related to at least two poorly understood aspects of camelid variation and biogeography. We have suggested above that guanacos may have been present in the puna zone of the Callejon de Conchucos and the Callej6n de Huaylas, and that the occasional hunting of this species may have contributed to the osteometric inflation of the Urabarriu large camelids. As the hunting of these animals was supplanted by the herding of domes- ticated llamas, the osteometric sample would become pure and the average size of the large camelids would decrease. In addition to the elimination of guanacos from the platter of the herder/hunters of the north-central highlands, it is probable that the continued diachronic decrease in large camelid size at Chavin de Huaintar, Huaricoto, and Huacaloma is related to the synchronic decrease in large camelid size observed from south (Valley of Cuzco, Peru) to north (Pirincay, Ecuador) dur- ing the Early Horizon to Early Intermediate Period (Miller and Gill 1990:62). Based on an observed latitudinal cline in bone measurements, these authors have argued that Early Horizon and Early Intermediate Period llamas constituted a polytypic species morphologically adapted to a variety of habitats ranging from the southern puna Andes of southern Peru and northern Bolivia to the paramo Andes of southern Ecuador. The morphological extremes of this lat- itudinal cline appear to have occurred, on the one hand, in the Collao (the area surrounding Lake Titicaca), where the largest llamas, those E E .r_, a) o Q cn C . _ 0 E E x 60 - 55 - 50 - 45 - 40 - 35 - 30 20 45 Miller and Burger] 437</page><page sequence="18">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY ill 30 1 17 1 1I -r- Chavin de Huant -M- Huaricoto -E- Huacaloma :ar 17 18 19 320 21 22 2 2 25 26mm 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 mm 1st Phalanx Proximal Latero-medial Width Figure 9.

We believe that the diachronic diminu- tion in large camelids observed at Chavin de Hu'antar and nearby sites provides further evi- dence of the gradual adaptation of southern lla- mas to northern environmental conditions and the development of a llama variety that in some instances was almost 15 percent smaller than the average llama of the Collao. Approximately 5 percent of the Janabarriu camelid bone measurements fall below the llama osteometric range. All of these measurements were derived from bones of the foot, a point with implications to be emphasized below. We inter- pret the 5 percent of Janabarriu camelid bones that do not fall within llama parameters to be vicufias and to represent vestiges of the ancient deer-vicufia-guanaco hunting pattern, perhaps transformed into an infrequent activity with ritual and/or recreational associations, as was apparent- ly the case among the later Moche and Inka (cf. Donnan 1982; Pizarro 1978). Ch'arki and Bone Tools at Chavin The diachronic profile of species abundance and the nature of the camelid populations found at Chavin de Huaintar attest to the introduction of llama herding and a correlative decline in hunting, but they tell us little about the organization of these productive activities or the context in which the resulting animal products were distributed and consumed. Fortunately, these concerns can be approached by analyzing the imprint of cultural behavior left on animal bone due to activities such as butchery and the transport of foodstuffs. The study of these phenomena has only recently begun to be explored in Andean prehistory as part of a more general interest in taphonomic analysis in archaeology (cf.

Differential representation of camelid major carcass groups from the three phases of occupation at Chavin de Huantar. Note that because of the difficulty of distinguishing between fragmentary camelid and cervid vertebrae and ribs, and hence their necessary inclusion in the taxon "artiodactyl," the axial category of camelids is certainly underrepresented during all three phases. Andean faunal assemblage (Miller 1979), but for purposes of the current study, taphonomic discus- sion will be necessarily limited to issues that reflect directly on the situation at Chavin de Huantar, and on the camelids in particular. A convenient point of departure for the study of the human handling of Chavin de Huantar ani- mal bones is the differential representation of skeletal parts surviving in the collection. Figure 10 illustrates the relative proportions of the five major camelid carcass groups (head, axial ele- ments, forelimbs, hindlimbs, and feet) recovered from each of the three Chavin phases. It is evident from this graph that a dramatically different pat- tern of camelid bone survival applies to the Urabarriu-phase material than that which typifies the later two phases. In a word, the Urabarriu camelid assemblage is characterized by an abun- dance of head and foot bones, while the Chakinani and Janabarriu phases show an acute reduction in those carcass groups and a correla- tive increase in leg elements. One might question, of course, whether these impressionistic contrasts are real or simply a result of different samples. Spearman's Rank Order Correlation Coefficient, when applied to the Urabarriu vs. the Chakinani assemblage or the Urabarriu vs. the Janabarriu assemblage, yields results indicating that the dif- ferences are statistically significant (r, = .221; p&gt; .1 and r, = .061; p &gt; .1). In contrast, the same test applied to Chakinani vs. Janabarriu camelid bones demonstrates that these faunal samples possess quite similar rank-order profiles (r, = .678 ; p &lt; .001). Thus, something besides chance seems to have been producing the contrasting patterns of camelid bone survival from earliest to latest time at Chavin de Huantar. In order to evaluate the two prehistoric pat- terns of Chavin bone survival summarized in Figure 10 and detailed in Table 4, it will be help- ful to compare them to an ethnographic baseline. The differential representation of camelid skele- tal elements from several ethnoarchaeological contexts in the puna of southern Peru has been studied by Miller (1979). A common pattern of head and foot overrepresentation and leg under- representation emerged from the excavations and surface collections conducted in 1975 at modern herding communities there.

Most of the causes of camelid bone survival at Tuqsa are well understood, and this assemblage will serve as a baseline with which to compare differential representation at Chavin de Huaintar and other prehistoric sites in the Andes. There are four major influences acting on contemporary camelid bone survival in the highlands: (1) Intrinsic factors of differential bone density in several mammalian species (goat, sheep, cari- bou) have been documented to favor the survival of compact podial elements and enamel-protect- ed teeth more than cancellous long-bone articula- tions and vertebrae (Binford and Bertram 1977; Brain 1969, 1981). Density determinations con- ducted on modern alpaca bones from the South American Camelid Research Station at La Raya, Peru, confirm that the camelids are no different in this regard (Miller 1979:68). (2) The contem- porary pattern of camelid butchery takes advan- tage of the relative fragility of certain long-bone articulations (proximal humerus, proximal tibia, proximal femur, and distal femur) by fracturing them longitudinally and thereby differentially exposing these parts to higher degrees of postde- positional stress. (3) Bone gnawing and con- sumption by domestic dogs adds to the vectors of density and butchery factors because dogs differ- entially destroy spongy, nutritious and/or easily broached bones and, more often than not, ignore less desirable podial elements and teeth-bearing cranial bones. Thus, factors 1 to 3 converge in modern camelid herding communities in the southern highlands to decrease the archaeologi- cal visibility of such elements such as the can- cellous, longitudinally fractured proximal humerus, while increasing the visibility of the elements such as the dense, generally unfrac- tured astragalus. The fourth factor, unlike the previous three, is not a factor of bone destruction but rather of bone transport, and can have the same effect as factors 1 to 3, or just the opposite, depending on the envi- ronment in which it is recorded. This factor is based in a practice common in the puna of mod- ern southern Peru of producing dried llama and alpaca meat by alternately exposing it to the des- iccating effects of the Andean sun and freezing nights. The product of this freeze-drying process, ch'arki, has made its way from the native Quechua into English as "jerky" and constitutes one of the principal items traded by camelid herders of the puna to the occupants of highland valleys and the coast (Inamura 1981; Miller 1979). Camelid ch'arki is mentioned by several chroniclers (Acosta 1954 [1589]:136; Cobo 1964 [1653]:244) as having been an important food item at the time of the Spanish conquest. For the zooarchaeologist the method of manu- facturing ch'arki is fortuitous and conforms well to other researchers' observations concerning dif- ferential treatment of carcass parts with high- meat utility indexes versus those with low-meat utility indexes (cf. Binford 1981). Traditional ch'arki is unlike western beef jerky in that the product normally incorporates the bones within the meat and makes use of all portions of the ani- mal except for the head and feet, which are gen- erally reserved for immediate home consumption by the herding communities.4 Although the mod- ern residents of the puna above Chavin de Huantar no longer possess llamas or alpacas, they continue to manufacture ch'arki from cattle and swine in the same manner as observed among camelid herders of southern Peru. Traditionally, this beef and pork ch'arki is traded to people liv- ing at lower elevations for corn, wheat, and barley (Martin Justiniano, personal communication 1983). Hypothetically, the zooarchaeological mani- festation of ch'arki production and trade would be an overrepresentation of podial and cranial elements at high-altitude sites where camelids were resident and ch'arki was manufactured, and a concomitant overrepresentation of leg and axial elements at intermontane valley or coastal sites that were on the receiving end of the trade arrangement (see Figure 11). This phenomenon, termed the "ch'arki effect" (Miller 1979:210), was hypothesized as a result of Miller's ethnoar- chaeological research, and its high-altitude man- ifestation is proposed here as the fourth causal element in the differential representation seen at several modern and prehistoric sites in the south- ern highlands. 440 [Vol. 60, No. 3, 1995</page><page sequence="21">ANIMAL UTILIZATION AT CHAVIN DE HUANTAR, PERU Table 4.

Such a pattern conforms to butchery practices observed among contemporary llama and alpaca herders of southern Peru (Miller 1979:61-66). (3) The incidence of carnivore gnawing on Chakinani (6.1 percent) and Janabarriu (16.3 percent) camelid bones is within the same order of magnitude as that observed on the Tuqsa bones (9.9 percent). In any case, the sum total of these three taphonomic factors would be to decrease the survival of leg elements, not to increase their survival as is observed with the Chakinani and Janabarriu assemblages. We believe that the most important factor influencing the differential representation of camelid bones from the last two phases at Chavin de Huantar was taphonomic factor number 4 (i.e., the ch'arki effect) and the nature of the environment sur- rounding the site. The valley of Chavin de Huantar is extremely narrow, roughly I km wide, and while it is well suited to potato cultivation, it would not have pro- vided adequate pasturage for large herds of domesticated camelids. As noted earlier, abun- dant and excellent pasture land is available within the catchment of Chavin de Huantar, an hour or more away in the puna of the Cordillera Blanca and the Cordillera Oriental at altitudes of 3,800 to 4,100 m (see Figure 2). The llamas used by the inhabitants of Chavin de Huantar were probably never resident on the valley floor itself for any length of time, but instead were maintained in the puna zone where a significant percentage of them were slaughtered and prepared as ch'arki. Following this interpretation, dried meat contain- ing mostly bones of the upper legs and the axial skeleton would have been traded from high-alti- tude herding communities to the settlement sur- rounding the temple of Chavin de Huantar. In return, the Chavin residents would have provided agricultural products such as maize, which could not be cultivated without great risk on or above the valley floor, or exotic items such as coastal shell or obsidian acquired through exchange. Numerous Early Horizon village sites have been located near Chavin de Huantar between ele- vations of 3,600 m and 3,850 m, just below the beginning of the vast puna pasture land. These settlements were coeval with the valley-floor cen- ter and shared its religious ideology, as evidenced by the presence of Chavin-style sculptures at these sites (Burger 1983). Modern Quechua com- munities located close to these small sites com- bine high-altitude cultivation of frost-resistant tubers and grains with herding on the adjacent puna. Thus, at Chavin de Huantar the ch'arki effect provides a diagnostic faunal fingerprint of the vertical interdependence of multiple-resource zones, which is so often claimed as a hallmark of the Andean economic system (Murra 1972) and offers further evidence for the simultaneous adop- tion of vertical resource exploitation and camelid pastoralism (cf. Custred 1979; Lynch 1983). Zooarchaeological evidence for the vertical interdependency of kichwa and puna communi- ties in the northern and central highland valleys is 442 [Vol. 60, No. 3, 1995</page><page sequence="23">ANIMAL UTILIZATION AT CHAVIN DE HUANTAR, PERU Mandible 1 st Phalanx Dist.

Differential representation of camelid skeletal elements from the Chakinani phase of Chavin de Hurntar compared to the representation of those same elements from the ethnoarchaeological site of Tuqsa in the southern highlands of Peru. The figure demonstrates a highly significant difference in skeletal part representation between the two sites (Spearman's Rank Order Correlation Coefficient rs = -.34, p &gt; .1). not limited to the site of Chavin de Huantar. The site of Kotosh is located some 120 km to the south on the floor of the upper Huallaga Valley at an altitude of approximately 2,000 m. In the analysis of Kotosh camelid remains approximately coeval with Chavin de Huantar, it was noted that "the ter- minal bones of the foot, the phalanges, are partic- ularly infrequent" and that "the main muscle bear- ing bones of the limb, the humerus, and femur are for the most part represented more frequently than expected" (Wing 1972:338). Wing attributes the Kotosh differential representation of camelid bones to procedures of butchery and bone-tool manufacture, but in addition to these factors we suspect that the over-abundance of leg bones was caused by Kotosh's position as the low altitude, agricultural partner in a vertical ch'arki trading relationship.

The ceremonial site of Huaricoto is located 55 km to the southeast of Chavin de Huantar on a low terrace just above the valley floor of the Callejon de Huaylas at an altitude of 2,750 m. This site also contains evidence of the ch'arki effect. Michael Sawyer (1985:70-71) reports that during the Early Capilla (600-400 B.C.) and Late Capilla phases (400-200 B.C.) there was a low frequency of camelid foot bones, concluding that the llama herds were not resident in the Callej6n de Huaylas, but instead were maintained in the puna zone of the Cordillera Blanca above the site. Finally, 250 km to the north of Chavin de Huaintar at the site of Huacaloma, Cajamarca, and at an altitude of 2,700 m, Melody Shimada has found an overrepresentation of camelid appendic- ular elements and an underrepresentation of camelid podial elements from Initial Period to Middle Horizon contexts (Shimada 1982:323). Again, this pattern of skeletal representation is most probably the result of the importation of camelid meat in the form of ch'arki to the site from the high-altitude grassland environment. It would be inappropriate, however, to interpret these data as documenting that camelids were consumed exclusively as ch'arki by lowland resi- dents. Scrutiny of the Chavin de Huantar evidence (Figure 12, Table 4) reveals that the camelid meat consumed by the Chakinani and Janabarriu popu- lations did not arrive at the site purely in ch'arki packages, since head and foot parts do occasion- ally occur in these assemblages, albeit in relative- ly low frequencies. This pattern is to be expected and conforms to what might be termed the "kich- wa zone mixed consumption pattern" of puna- originated camelid meat. This pattern, character- ized by elevated frequencies of leg and axial ele- ments but not total absence of podial and cranial elements, probably resulted from the residents of valley-floor sites consuming a large quantity of imported ch'arki mixed with an occasional entire llama carcass brought to the site on the hoof. We suspect that such mixed consumption would have occurred more commonly than the exclusive con- sumption of ch'arki and that it reflects the avail- ability of fresh meat during the culling of the herd just before the onset of winter and/or the occa- sional slaughter of llamas during the summer months when ch'arki production was not possible. An additional factor that may have contributed a few podial elements to the Chakinani and Janabarriu samples was the persistence of episod- ic vicufia hunting. For instance, the small camelids identified as constituting 5 percent of the Janabarriu assemblage, mentioned in the pre- vious section, are represented entirely by foot bones. These podial elements may have arrived at Chavin de Huantar as part of vicufa carcasses brought back to the site as meat packages in skin grocery bags, perhaps corresponding to the wide- ly recognized pattern known as the "schlepp effect" (cf. Perkins and Daly 1968).6 Uraharriu Differential Representation The Urabarriu camelid assemblage differs in rep- resentation of body parts from both the ethnoar- chaeological pattern of puna bone survival at Tuqsa (see Figure 13) and the Chakinani and Janabarriu assemblages discussed above. The high incidence of cranial and podial elements in the Urabarriu assemblage presents a superficial resemblance to the ethnoarchaeological pattern found in high-altitude ch'arki production commu- nities and seems to suggest that camelids might have been resident in the valley of Chavin de Huantar during the earliest phase of the site's development. But if the science of taphonomy has shown nothing else in the past 20 years, it is that things are not always as they seem. It is highly improbable that camelids would have been resi- dent in the valley of Chavin de Huantar because of the absence of sufficient forage and because the kichiwa zone altitude of the site would make ch'arki production impossible. Moreover, we interpret a substantial proportion of the Urabarriu camelids as wild vicufias, along with a few guana- cos. Instead, we believe the differential representa- tion of Urabarriu body parts is due to both the mixed hunting and herding context of their origin and the prevalence of bone-tool production during the Urabarriu phase. Unlike the faunal assemblages from the later two phases, the Urabarriu sample contains an extremely high frequency of bone tools and bone- 444 [Vol. 60, No. 3, 1995</page><page sequence="25">ANIMAL UTILIZATION AT CHAVIN DE HUANTAR, PERU tool byproducts. A total of 16.3 percent of the specimens in the Urabarriu faunal assemblage were classified as tool byproducts or showed evi- dence of having been worked. At the time of excavation, Burger (1984a:204-209) identified 52 bone artifacts in the Urabarriu assemblage, including needles, awls, spatulas, gouges, and beads. The great majority of these tools were pro- duced from the shafts of camelid and cervid leg bones, a practice that would have reduced the archaeological visibility of leg bones compared to foot and cranial elements (which were not com- monly used as tool blanks) and would have artifi- cially increased the differential representation of foot and cranial elements in the Urabarriu sample. This interpretation is corroborated by the unusu- ally large percentage of Urabarriu bones that could be identified only as "indeterminate artio- dactyl" (21.7 percent of total fragments). Most of these indeterminate specimens were long-bone fragments that had been too badly damaged to dis- tinguish between camelids and cervids. Much of this damage could have been sustained during the production of bone tools; in fact, 45 percent of the indeterminate artiodactyl bones exhibited the characteristic polish or cut marks of worked bone. When these factors are taken into account, the Urabarriu camelid assemblage can be plausibly interpreted as being derived from wild and domesticated animals brought to Chavin de Huantar on the hoof or in carcass form from the grasslands, and subsequently used both as meat and in the bone-tool industry. Camelid Harvesting and Social Differentiation Just as camelid bones reflect the social and eco- nomic relationships that existed between Chavin de Huantar and surrounding groups, they also provide a window into the internal sociopolitical organization of the settlement. By the time of the construction of the New Temple during Janabarriu times, Chavin de Huantar had expand- ed to cover an estimated 42 ha. The settlement certainly was one of the most impressive popula- tion centers of the period and may even have con- stituted a protourban center with all the attendant complexity that this term implies (Burger 1984a:250; 1992a:16-181; cf. Rowe 1963:3). Excavations in Janabarriu-associated contexts clearly demonstrate that the population of Chavin de Huantar's last phase was both specialized in craft production and hierarchically differentiated in regard to consumption of commodities (Burger 1984a:235-241, 1989:563-564). Sector A, located on the north side of the Huachecsa River, was characterized by a variety of lithic implements suggesting artisan activities by a population of low social rank. In contrast, the Janabarriu deposits excavated in Sector D, located on the lower slopes overlooking the New Temple, yielded a variety of high-prestige goods including gold jewelry, worked Spondylus shell, bone beads, and fossils, all of which were absent from Sector A contexts. Based on the artifactual evidence indicating Janabarriu socioeconomic differentiation, one might expect that the faunal remains recovered from Sectors A and D would reflect similar dif- ferences in status and activities, and this is indeed the case. The Sector D residents appear to have possessed differential access to both dried fish from the coast (eight of nine identified fish bones are from Sector D), and a much greater variety of shellfish (Sector D = 12 species, Sector A = 2 species) than the residents of Sector A. On the other hand, no significant difference in the con- sumption of individual mammalian species was detected, nor did the high-prestige population of Sector D have differential access to prime cuts of camelid meat (see Table 4). The skeletal element profiles from the two sectors are virtually identi- cal as judged by Spearman's Rank Order Correlation Coefficient (r, = .629; p &lt; .001). The only area of camelid consumption in which the two Janabarriu sectors exhibit clear distinction is the age of the animals consumed. But before examining these data, a brief discussion of con- temporary and prehistoric camelid mortality and harvesting and the archaeological criteria used to identify this phenomenon will be required. The tendency among modern camelid herders is to maintain their animals on the hoof for as long as they are productive, reflecting the low prestige of camelids as food in urban centers and, consequently, the lack of emphasis on producing high-quality meat by rural herders. Current notions of camelid productivity translate as fiber production for alpacas, burden-bearing strength for male llamas, and fertility for both llama and Miller and Burger] 445</page><page sequence="26">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Mandible 1st Phalanx Dist.

Only after this productivity has been exhausted, usually after some seven to eight years, are the animals normally slaughtered for meat.7 This pattern of contemporary camelid har- vesting, combined with an estimate of the natu- rally occurring mortality of the species, is repre- sented graphically by the background mortality/survivorship curve in Figure 14. The contemporary pattern of camelid manage- ment contrasts with that once practiced at some prehistoric sites in the Andes. Several researchers have reported camelid mortality patterns, based on both tooth eruption and epiphyseal fusion, which demonstrate large to massive die-off for animals of less than one year of age (Miller 1979:215; Shimada 1982, 1985; Wheeler Pires- 0 U-MWAMOMMOMOMMUMAMM M vmw=w=mNmIwMl mmmmopowm IMMOWASIVAIRIMMKOWNW89RU -IrA/%-*, "W', WOMMMOSAIRMOME siawmmmmummumnnm 'aimmolffmgntmwmmm mmlmlwM liniiiiiiiiiiili' I- . . .. . ........... 11 ....... nommumonam onowansommomm I I 111imiivm IIIIII 446 [Vol. 60, No. 3, 1995 OMMAIMMOM, ,VA-m-FAMM WHO m El m m onamoom lm mmim lm m n wmwmwAlmm</page><page sequence="27">ANIMAL UTILIZATION AT CHAVIN DE HUANTAR, PERU Ferreira et al. 1976). Such neonatal and juvenile camelid exploitation has been suggested as a hall- mark of early camelid domestication, perhaps precipitated by enterotoxemia infection associat- ed with the crowded conditions of corrals (Wheeler 1984). For example, at Telarmachay on the puna of Junin at approximately 4000 B.C., Wheeler Pires-Ferreira et al. (1976) found 72 per- cent of the camelids to be newborns. Judging by the state of epiphyseal fusion, such a pattern does not characterize the survivorship of the camelids from Chavin de Huantar: 14.4 percent of the Urabarriu camelids are subadults, as are 39.7 per- cent of the Chakinani camelids and 26.9 percent of the Janabarriu camelids. Within the Janabarriu sample, the two residen- tial sectors exhibit distinct patterns of mortality/survivorship (see Figure 14), which we interpret as reflecting separate exploitation strate- gies practiced by the low-status vs. high-status populations. Based on the known schedule of camelid epiphyseal fusion (Miller 1981), the high-status residents of Sector D seem to have possessed differential access to tender meat from younger animals. Almost 80 percent of the Sector D llamas had died before or at three years of age, while they were still relatively tender but long before they had fulfilled their productive potential as cargo animals. In contrast, almost 60 percent of the llamas eaten by the low-status residents of Sector A were four years of age or older. We anticipate two potential criticisms concern- ing the validity of the above interpretation. First, mortality/survivorship curves based on bone- fusion data possess inherent difficulties. Since each one of the age grades on the horizontal axis of Figure 14 reflects a series of epiphyseal fusion loci (e.g., the distal femur and proximal and distal radio-ulna all fuse by approximately three years of age), the zooarchaeologist ideally seeks a faunal assemblage in which all fusion planes are equally represented. Such equal representation (one bone, one vote), however, seems to exist only in theory. In real faunal assemblages factors of taphonomy and chance always skew the representation of one bone or another. Hence, the representation of some fusion planes and consequently some age grades may be inflated or underrepresented. This is cer- tainly a problem in regard to the absolute accuracy of mortality/survivorship curves based on bone fusion and in comparing the mortality/survivor- ship curves from widely different taphonomic contexts. For instance, it would be entirely inap- propriate to compare the mortality/survivorship curves from Urabarriu and Janabarriu because we have observed that bones survived quite different- ly in those two phases. Valid comparison of the two Janabarriu sectors, however, is possible because we have observed above that the differen- tial representation of bone elements in these two contexts is essentially identical. Secondly, one might ask what difference ten- der young vs. tough old meat would make to Sector A or Sector D Janabarriu residents, if they were receiving the majority of it in desiccated ch'arki packages? While this question appears to present a valid academic challenge, it is not borne out in Andean experience. Today in the highlands of Huancavelica, ch'arki is made from both young and old llamas and alpacas, but to the discerning palate of the consumer it is self-evident what the age of the slaughtered animal was, since younger animals have a better flavor and more tender tex- ture when the ch'arki is eaten. The thickness of cut and other details of production also differ in relation to the age of the animal (Mauro Ticllacuri Ramos, personal communication 1989). Like modern consumers, the Sector D Janabarriu resi- dents probably also found ch'arki manufactured from young animals more desirable, and their ability to acquire it is reflected in the high-status survivorship curve in Figure 14. Slaughtering ani- mals still in their prime for the gustatory gratifi- cation of the elite residents of the valley center provides independent evidence of the emergence of social inequality at Chavin de Huaintar during the Early Horizon. Summary and Discussion Analysis of the animal bones from Chavin de Huantar has provided us with several intriguing observations concerning the diachronic pattern of faunal exploitation at the site. In this section, we shall review our findings and briefly explore some of their implications for understanding the development of the site of Chavin de Huantar and the spread of domesticated camelids to the north- em highlands and coast of Peru.

Economy of Chavin de Huarntar The evidence presented above demonstrates that from its foundation in the late Initial Period (ca. 900 B.C.), the settlement of Chavin de Huantar was partly dependent upon the hunting and herd- ing of camelids on the vast puna grasslands above the valley slopes. During the period of the Old Temple (i.e., the Urabarriu phase), the faunal remains reveal a mixed exploitation strategy con- sisting both of the hunting of wild game, primar- ily vicufia and deer, and the management of domesticated llamas. The presence of llamas in the Urabarriu refuse fits well with other lines of evidence suggesting that Chavin de Huantar was, from its inception, an important node in the net- work of long-distance exchange within the high- lands and among the coast, highlands, ceja de selva, and tropical lowlands. Judging from the Urabarriu phase faunal remains, the primary importance of llamas initial- ly was as pack animals, while their use for meat appears to have been a secondary byproduct of the annual culling of the herds and inevitable loss- es due to disease and other factors. The majority of the llamas consumed during Urabarriu times were four years of age or older. It is noteworthy that during this time wild game comprised 60 - 70 percent of the meat, with the remaining 30 - 40 percent coming from llamas. The vicufia and white-tailed deer appear to have been hunted by the valley-floor residents themselves, judging from the presence of numerous projectile points in their refuse. The probable weapon used was the spear-thrower (atlatl), which figures in the iconography of Chavin de Huantar stone carvings (Rowe 1962:18). Thus, it would seem that during the Urabarriu phase the people of the valley floor directly acquired most of their own meat and were largely self-sufficient in this respect. On the other hand, the maintenance of llama herds on the narrow valley floor would have been impractical, and managing them on the high pas- ture lands would have been difficult from Chavin de Huantar, despite the compressed zonation that characterizes the area. Herding would have required the active cooperation of people living in high-altitude villages near the lower edge of the puna. These villages must have been partially integrated into the Chavin economy even during the late Initial Period. The economic links were reinforced by shared participation in the Chavin religious cult both at the monumental valley-floor temple and at small shrines in the high-altitude villages themselves (Burger 1983). As the settlement and temple of Chavin de Huantar grew during the Early Horizon (i.e., 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 c ._ Z3 0) c C ca) 0) 0) 0- [Vol. 60, No. 3, 1995 448</page><page sequence="29">ANIMAL UTILIZATION AT CHAVIN DE HUANTAR, PERU Chakinani and Janabarriu phases), the pattern of faunal exploitation shifted to one devoted almost exclusively to domesticated llamas. During the Chakinani phase (500-400 B.C.) llama consump- tion constituted approximately 83 percent of the total meat intake, and by the Janabarriu phase (400-200 B.C.) it reached approximately 93 per- cent. These changes reflect several interrelated processes that transformed the local economy. First of all, interregional commerce between Chavin de Huaintar and more distant regions increased; consequently, access to llamas, the only alternative to human cargo-bearers, must have become more essential. At the same time, hunting decreased in importance until, by the Janabarriu phase, its contribution to the daily diet was almost negligible. The abandonment of hunt- ing by the inhabitants of Chavin de Hufantar would have allowed them to devote more time to trade, crafts, farming, and other valley-floor activities (temple rituals, service activities for visitors, etc.). On the other hand, it implied an increasing dependency on the herders and farm- ers living in high-altitude hamlets and villages. These small communities appear to have been responsible for managing the llama herds on the puna grasslands, slaughtering them there, and producing llama meat for consumption by the valley-floor residents. The differential represen- tation of camelid skeletal elements found at Chavin de Huantar demonstrates that this meat was usually provided in the form of dried-meat packages (ch'arki) that could be consumed throughout the year. Thus, the faunal analysis graphically docu- ments the shift from a generalized economic sys- tem with loose ties between the vertical produc- tion zones to a more specialized economy in which communities with specialized concerns were integrated into a single interdependent sub- sistence system. This arrangement, although pro- ductive, is not environmentally determined by the vertical zonation. It is entirely feasible to main- tain a stable and prosperous agriculturally based subsistence system on the valley floor without the input of meat from domesticated camelids, just as high-altitude villages could have survived by supplementing their herding with the cultiva- tion of tubers and grains such as quinoa on the upper valley slopes. In fact, for much of Peruvian prehistory, these two strategies coexisted without being fully articulated, and in some cases, they actually functioned in opposition to each other, both symbolically and physically (e.g., Duviols 1974). The shift to a vertical and reciprocal sub- sistence system reinforced the urban-rural dichotomy within Chavin society, and the differ- ential patterns of camelid consumption between the center and its support area highlight the fun- damentally asymmetric character of this relation- ship. The urban residents ate the meaty flanks of the animals, while the puna residents appear to have commonly settled for llama feet and heads. The faunal remains analyzed here provide additional information for the presence of social stratification within the Chavin de Huaintar set- tlement. It would appear that some valley-floor residents, previously identified as corresponding to the community elite, procured meat from young llamas, slaughtered long before they had fulfilled their potential as pack animals, while the less fortunate members of the community dined on the meat of generally older and presumably less desirable animals. Thus, the faunal remains offer preliminary evidence not only of increasing economic specialization between communities, but also of increasing social differentiation among these communities and within the princi- pal center of this settlement system. Chavin de Hudntar and the Emergence of Andean Agropastoralism Chavin de Hufantar flourished within a sphere of interaction that included most of the central and northern coast and highlands of Peru, as well as portions of the south coast. This phenomenon resulted in the widespread adoption of religious, cultural, and technological features in previously unrelated societies, as well as the more extensive distribution of specific exotic items, such as obsidian and cinnabar. Long-distance trade and contact between many of these groups already existed before the Chavin horizon, particularly in the late Initial Period, but the intensity and impact of these linkages were significantly less. What role did the introduction of the domesticated llama have in the development of the Chavin sphere of interaction and what, if any, impact did 449 Miller and Burger]</page><page sequence="30">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY this horizon phenomenon have on the adoption of camelid herding beyond its original source area in central and southern Peru? In reviewing the faunal studies carried out for Initial Period and Early Horizon occupations at northern centers, one is struck with two seeming- ly interrelated phenomena: the late dates when camelid pastoralism generally became accepted north of the puna of Junin and the rapidity with which this innovation was integrated into the economy of Chavin de Huantar. If Kent (1982), Wheeler (1984), and Wing (1986) are correct in dating the widespread adoption of domesticated camelids in the central highlands to at least the third millennium B.C. (see Figure 15d), it is note- worthy that full-scale acceptance of this econom- ic innovation does not occur in the northern region in some cases until well into the Early Intermediate Period (200 B.C.-A.D. 600). The residents of Initial Period highland centers, such as Kotosh, Huaricoto, Huacaloma, and Pacopampa, dined primarily on venison through- out this period. The more northern centers, Pacopampa and Huacaloma, which were estab- lished centuries before Chavin de Huantar, made only minimal use of camelids in their diet during the Initial Period. These centers acquired virtual- ly all of their meat by hunting, and wild camelids were not native to the adjacent valley slopes and moister paramo grasslands.8 Although camelids did not play a significant role in the Initial Period diet of these and other northern centers, the llama was apparently already known there as a pack animal. Camelid bones, presumably llamas, occasionally occur in late Initial Period contexts at Huacaloma, Pacopampa, and the nearby coastal center of Huaca Lucia (see Figure 15c). At the latter site, Shimada has discovered llama excrement, con- firming that live animals, rather than an occasion- al piece of dried llama ch'arki, were responsible for the stochastic appearance of these camelid bones. At Huaca Negra in the Viru Valley, archae- ologists Strong and Evans discovered a llama buried in a shallow pit with its front legs bound together from the hoof up to the forelimb in coiled rope and with the hind legs lashed together above the hoofs. Nearby, three other llamas were found tied, and two still wore harnesses around their heads and neck. Dated to the Middle Guafiape period, roughly equivalent to the late Initial Period (Burger 1984a:371), the large rectangular build- ing where these animals were discovered has been interpreted as a public building (the Temple of the Llamas), and the four llama burials were consid- ered by the excavators to be religious offerings (Strong and Evans 1952). On the other hand, camelid food-bone refuse was scarce at this and other coeval coastal sites, and camelid wool does not appear in textiles until the Early Horizon. In summary, the evidence currently available sug- gests that camelid herding was probably absent to the north of Chavin de Huantar before the Early Horizon, although the arrival of camelids from southern and central Peru as pack animals would have made them a rare but identifiable sight in this northern region. Although conforming generally to the northern trend of delayed adoption of camelid pastoralism, Chavin de Huantar is exceptional in its relatively early emphasis on these animals. During the late Initial Period, when all northern coeval sites were still relying heavily on the hunting of deer, more than 80 percent of the fauna consumed by the res- idents of Chavin de Huantar were from the family Camelidae. The northern pattern of camelid adoption does not resemble the scenario suggested by Lynch (1983:4) where "pastoralism may have become known nearly simultaneously in the far-flung cor- ners of the communicating Andean world." Nor does it conform entirely to Shimada's hypothesis that "if domestic camelid diffused out of the cen- tral highlands, we might expect sequential dates later as we move farther north" (Shimada 1982:311). Instead, all available archaeological data indicate that after the initial domestication of llamas and alpacas in southern and/or central Peru, the northward diffusion of domesticated camelids progressed extremely slowly for more than 2,000 years until the rise of Chavin de Huantar around 900 B.C., when this center assumed a catalytic role in the widespread adop- tion of these animals into northern economies (see Figure 15b). Why should this have been so? The reasons may be partially environmental. Throughout the Preceramic and Initial periods, wild animals, principally cervids, along with 450 [Vol. 60, No. 3, 1995</page><page sequence="31">ANIMAL UTILIZATION AT CHAVIN DE HUANTAR, PERU domesticated cuyes, appear to have provided suf- ficient meat for the residents of the kichwa zone valleys. The forested habitats favored by deer, however, may have experienced considerable reduction in the northern and north-central inter- montane valleys during the Initial Period and Early Horizon (Shimada 1985:207-208). This environmental shift, whether occasioned by cli- matic or cultural factors, may have caused the depletion of cervid herds and forced the expand- ing valley populations to look upward toward the puna. This explanation, however, emphasizes the nutritional value of the puna camelids rather than the value that we believe the valley residents found most compelling. In trying to assess the reasons for the prosper- ity, success, and influence of Chavin de Hufantar, the access of this center to puna grasslands and its ability to integrate these agriculturally marginal lands into the economic system through camelid herding must have provided an epochal break- through. The existence of bulk transport using lla- mas constituted a technological development that brought with it the potential of long-distance exchange without the extreme energy constraints that exist when human bearers are the primary means of transport. Ethnographers have described llama trains consisting of 80 animals, each carry- ing loads of 80-100 pounds and following a lead animal, under the care of only two or three herders. If this description is applicable in gener- al terms to the past, it would have been possible for three people to oversee the transport of four tons of foodstuffs or other items over a distance of some 15 km per day (Flores Ochoa 1968:118). During this journey, the llamas, for the most part, could graze on natural forage found along the route, while the energetic costs of the food con- sumed by the herders was minimal compared to the materials being transported. At the end of the journey, some of the pack animals could be exchanged on the hoof, while others transported the goods acquired in exchange on the return trip. While llamas make this type of long-distance interaction more feasible, it is dependent on the demand for goods, the ability to produce the sur- plus items for exchange, and the development of social relations sufficient for establishing the linkages and permitting safe movement across potentially hostile terrain. These conditions appear to have occurred during the mid-Early Horizon (ca. 400-250 B.C.) within the context of cultural disruption, in many areas, and the emer- gence of social stratification in others (Burger 1989, 1992a; cf. Browman 1974b). Among the societies that were incorporated into the Chavin sphere of interaction were groups in Ayacucho (Ushnu Era, Jargampata) and Huancavelica (Atalla) that had a long history of familiarity with domesticated camelids. Contact between the resi- dents of Chavin de Huafntar and the herders of the southern highlands is suggested by the discovery of four Janabarriu obsidian specimens that matched the chemical patterning typical of obsid- ian from archaeological sites in the Cuzco and Andahuaylas regions (Burger et al. 1984:265). Contact between Chavin de Huaintar and the southern highlands may also be reflected in the exceptionally large size of Janabarriu llama bones relative to comparable bones from coeval contexts at Huaricoto and Huacaloma (see Figure 9) and the general tendency for comparable camelid measurements to decrease in size from south to north (Miller and Gill 1990). The large Janabarriu llamas may represent direct importation of south- ern camelid stock rather than animals whose ancestors had adapted to northern environments over a period of two or more millennia. The link between the Chavin horizon and the spread of camelid herding helps to explain the spatial as well as the temporal patterning of camelid pastoralism in the northern Andes. Rather than being a gradualistic spread of a tech- nological innovation, the mid-Early Horizon expansion represents a sharp and sudden increase in camelids over a broad area, nearly three mil- lennia after the animals had been domesticated in central Peru. Significantly, the extension of this shift appears to be confined within the limits of the Chavin sphere of interaction. It has been argued elsewhere that a frontier zone existed in what is now far northern Peru, separating the cul- tures of the Chavin horizon from the Chorrera and other distinctively Ecuadorian cultures (Burger 1984b). Recent studies (Lynch 1980; Miller and Gill 1990) from the Cuenca Basin in the southern Ecuadorian highlands have confirmed that, like northern Peru, no evidence exists of wild camelids Miller and Burger] 451</page><page sequence="32">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY 0 coc (U ~II a.

The date of the llama's introduction has been estab- lished at the site of Pirincay in Cuenca to be approximately A.D. 100 (Miller and Gill 1990). Thus, the societies of what is now southern Ecuador did not begin to herd llamas for nearly 500 years after this practice had been adopted in northern Peru during the Chavin horizon (see Figure 15a). How can we explain this lag? It cannot be explained in ecological terms since the landscape and climate in southern Ecuadorian highlands is similar to that in the far northern highlands of Peru; both are technically characterized by paramo grasslands, smaller in extension and moister than the puna grasslands of central and southern Peru. While camelids did not evolve in this habitat, they appear to have thrived in it for 1,500-2,000 years until the Spanish conquest led to their replacement by European domesticates. A mere 150 km separates Pirincay from Pacopampa, so the distance separating the two areas is like- wise insufficient to explain the lag. In our view, the difference in timing is best understood in terms of the cultural forces behind the economic shift. During the Chavin horizon, emerging elites sought products not locally available for distribu- tion to their communities and exotic goods as emblems of status. Increased social and religious interaction further encouraged interregional trav- el and created an ambiance in which such move- ment was feasible. Those groups within this field of socioeconomic activity had both reason to adopt camelid herding for its practical advantages and had contacts with groups that could supply them with both the domesticated animals to serve as the source of herds and the technical knowl- edge necessary for these herds to survive and prosper. Outside the Chavin sphere of interaction, fundamentally different conditions prevailed dur- ing the fourth and third centuries B.C. Thus, we can speculate that lesser need to transport bulk commodities over long distances, and lack of extensive contacts with camelid-herding commu- nities to the south may have been two of the fac- tors that prevented camelid husbandry from spreading north into Ecuador during this time. Animals in Chavin Thought As a clearer picture of the Chavin de Huantar economy emerges, we can better appreciate the seeming enigma that lay at the foundation of Chavin culture. Although Chavin de Huantar is located in an intermontane valley at 3,150 m asl, the vast majority of the animals and plants depict- ed on the sculptures are most at home on the riverine flood plains of the Amazon Basin and the dense forest of the lower eastern slopes of the Andes. The most common themes are monstrous animal amalgams featuring distinctive attributes of the cayman, the crested eagle, the jaguar, the snake, and the monkey (Burger 1992a; Rowe 1962). Lathrap (1971, 1973) argues that an iden- tification on the species level is possible and con- cludes that the cayman represented is the black cayman (Melanosuchus niger), the raptor is the harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja), and the snake is a boa constrictor, probably the anaconda (Eunectes murinus). While it is possible to question the basis of these specific identifications (cf. Davenport and Schreiber 1989), the particular suite of animals selected for representation are generally associat- ed with the tropical forest and with the cosmology of indigenous peoples of the Amazonian rainforest (Roe 1982). It is also noteworthy that all of the animals commonly represented on Chavin stone sculpture are carnivorous and wild. Even in their native lowland habitats they are not particularly important from a dietary perspective, and even without investigation it is clear that they could never have constituted a major source of meat in Chavin de Huantar. The analysis presented here has shown that from its inception the community of Chavin de Huantar was dependent on a variety of highland animals including wild deer and vicufias as well as domesticated llamas and guinea pigs. These highland animals were probably encountered by the residents of the community on a near daily basis. In contrast, the species that contributed their fangs, talons, plumage, and scales to the anthropomorphic/zoomorphic hybrid supernatu- rals of the site's famous stone sculptures were native to the tropical rainforest, several hundred kilometers to the east. The paradox of Chavin existence can thus be seen as dividing itself along the classic lines of cultural materialistic vs. ideational views of culture. The cultural material- ist examining only the fecal residue of Chavin Miller and Burger] 453</page><page sequence="34">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY behavior finds an emergent Andean agropastoral economy and a community filling its belly from the typical menu of highland food animals. The ideationalist, reading only the iconographic data, perceives an entirely different world at Chavin de Huantar, a cosmos inhabited by fearsome crea- tures entirely foreign to the daily lives of the Chavin farmer or artisan. It is not surprising, of course, that the original priestly mythogenitors of Chavin de Huantar would have chosen to focus on animals more exot- ic than those that appeared daily in the stew pot. The issue is not, however, simply a matter of emphasis. The highland animals on which the Chavin people subsisted were never portrayed on the temple sculpture, and, to our knowledge, are entirely absent on other Chavin iconographic media, such as ceramics or textiles.9 In as much as the supernaturals represented were likely viewed as having a decisive role in the successful func- tioning of Chavin society and economy, the inten- tional exclusion of locally inspired symbols becomes more intelligible. One message of Chavin art may have been that prosperity and well- being of the community depended on maintaining the favor of forces alien to the local habitat and daily experience, forces redolent of the powers of the distant and mysterious tropical forest. The mediation of this relationship required the services of ritual specialists. Thus the ideology of Chavin de Huantar, with its heavy emphasis on carnivo- rous and tropical forest fauna, can be seen as mys- tifying the society's source of wealth and power, rather than mapping it in metaphorical terms. In an alternative explanation for the prevalence of tropical forest fauna on the Chavin sculpture, Donald Lathrap (1971) proposed that the people of Chavin de Huantar, supported by a highland agricultural economy, sought to lionize animals that they had probably never seen, but that had been native to the homeland of their ancestors and therefore central to their mythology and cosmolo- gy. While this is a difficult hypothesis to falsify, the analysis presented here suggests that even the earliest population at Chavin de Huantar had mas- tered the skills of camelid herding, a complex and quintessential high-altitude technology. Had the original Urabarriu settlers been pioneers from the tropical forest, we would not expect them to have mastered camelid herding. When considered with the absence of tropical forest cultural traits in this earliest occupation (Burger 1984a, 1988), the fau- nal information presented here casts further doubt on Lathrap's reformulation of Julio C. Tello's hypothesis of the tropical forest source of Chavin. For the priests and artists of Chavin de Huantar, the importance of domesticated camelids and the vertical interdependence of kichwa and puna resource zones must have been fundamental to their understanding of the world. Such concepts may have been expressed artisti- cally in the form of general principles such as the mediation of complementary but opposing forces, as expressed in the Lanz6n, the principle cult image of the Old Temple; on this carving an anthropomorphic supernatural was represented with an upraised right arm with palm open and a lowered left arm with only the back of the hand visible. It does not appear, however, that Chavin art can be understood as an ecological mirror, along the lines outlined by Reichel Dolmatoff (1976) for the contemporary Kogi of Colombia or by Schele (1986) for the Classic Maya of Palenque. Even on a metaphorical level, the sub- ject matter would have been inappropriate since the behavior of animals serving as inspiration for the art would have been unfamiliar to the viewers and therefore a poor basis for natural symbols. It is more probable that the priests of Chavin de Huantar intentionally chose alien metaphors of profound mystery to fuel their spirits; to para- phrase Levi-Strauss (1963), caymans and jaguars were good to think, llamas were good to eat.

Carbon isotope analyses of high-altitude Andean foods by 457 Miller and Burger]</page><page sequence="38">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY DeNiro and Hastorf (1985) have demonstrated that all of the native cultigens, including quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa), are C3 plants. Only maize, believed by many to have been introduced to the Andes from Mesoamerica, is a C4 plant. A third photosynthetic pathway, known as CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism), is characteristic of desert succulents, and the tuna fruit of the Opuntia ficus-indica appears to be the only CAM food consumed in the highlands. The tuna fruit also is thought to have been introduced from Mesoamerica, perhaps after the Spanish conquest. Whether or not this was the case, tuna fruit is currently a minor seasonal food, and it is difficult to imagine it having any impact on the stable iso- tope bone chemistry. Thus, the carbon isotope composition of human bone from Chavin de Huantar probably reflects with considerable accuracy the relative proportions of maize versus C3 plants in the diet (Burger and van der Merwe 1990:87-89; DeNiro and Hastorf 1985:99-104). 2. The comparative camelid skeletal collection of the Laboratorio de Paleoetnozoologia, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, in Lima was used as the basis for this gradient. The rank order positions of camelid sizes in this collection were also recorded by Kent (1982) and conform to those observed by Wing (1972) in other collections. In con- trast, Franklin (1982) and Novoa and Wheeler (1984) describe llamas as being the largest of the camelids, with guanacos being somewhat smaller. 3. Since guanacos are nearly extinct within the Peruvian Andes, the comparative guanaco measurements used here are all derived from animals that originated in Tierra del Fuego where the species is believed to achieve a greater body size than is the case in environments to the north. The average stature of guanacos in north-central Peru, although impossi- ble to confirm with certainty, may very well have been with- in the upper range of contemporary llamas. 4. This description of ch'arki manufacture is based on sever- al independent observations from the highlands of Peru and Bolivia: Miller (1979:99) from the departments of Cuzco and Puno in Peru; Inamura (1980; cited in Shimada 1982) from the Department of La Union in Peru; Tomka (1988) from near Potosi in Bolivia. In contrast, Browman (1989:263-264) has reported seeing Bolivian ch'arki, which includes head and foot skeletal elements. 5. Axial elements, i.e., rib and vertebral fragments, are not included in Table 4 or in Figure 10 because of the difficulty of distinguishing between camelid and cervid specimens. The large numbers of ribs and vertebrae identified generi- cally as "artiodactyl indeterminate," however, make it clear that the camelid axial skeleton was well represented in the Chakinani and Janabarriu samples. 6. The original schlepp effect was proposed to explain the method devised by hunters to butcher and transport the meat from large ungulates weighing as much as 900 kg each. The transportation of a vicufa carcass, weighing only 35 to 60 kg, would not have required the full schlepp procedure. 7. This figure is derived from interviews conducted with sev- eral alpaca and mixed alpaca/llama herders in the Peruvian departments of Cuzco and Puno (Miller 1979). Flannery, Marcus, and Reynolds (1989:99-100) report somewhat high- er thresholds of productivity decline (10-15 years) among llamas of the Peruvian Department of Ayacucho. 8. The only other possible source of meat was human, and human bones both calcined and cut appear in surprising fre- quency at both Huacaloma and Pacopampa (Shimada 1982, 1985; Daniel Morales, personal communication 1987). In contrast, human skeletal remains are never found as part of household refuse at Chavin de Huantar with the exception of an occasional tooth. 9. The local fauna, although deemed inappropriate for pur- poses of religious cosmology, seems to have been important fare for the banquets and ceremonies held at the Chavin de Hufntar temple and surroundings. Camelid remains, proba- bly llama and cuv bone, were abundant in the Ofrendas Gallery (Lumbreras 1977, 1989). Similarly, the skeletons of at least 50 juvenile guinea pigs were recovered along with abundant Spondylus shell fragments from two offerings made in conjunction with the construction of Janabarriu house terraces on the slope overlooking the west of the tem- ple. Judging from their disarticulated state, the cuyes were probably consumed during festivities prior to their inter- ments as offerings (Burger 1984a:22-23; Cardoza and Pozzi- Escot 1977). The use of Spondylus, guinea pigs, and llamas in religious ritual constitutes an early expression of a cultur- al pattern that was to persist until the Spanish conquest (Murra 1975; Rowe 1946).
