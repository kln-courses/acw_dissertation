<plain_text><page sequence="1">Solidarity and Suffering: Toward a Politics of Relationality. By Douglas Sturm. (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1998. Pp. 335. $21.95.) Douglas Sturm is fond of looking at "the big picture" and asking the attendant big questions, such as, How shall we live together? Who are we? What is our place and destiny in the world? In this ambitious book, he provides his own an- swers and invites the reader to reflect upon the radical transformations to polit- ical and economic life that their implementation would require. Sturm's answers emerge out of a frankly utopian "politics of relationality," which comes across as a heady and unstable mixture of various trends in recent political and social theory. Communitarianism, cosmopolitanism, "deep" ecol- ogy, multiculturalism, feminism, "strong" democracy, and "third way" socialism all make appearances. The reader has to work hard to find specific proposals of any sort; much more common are vague pronouncements our laws, for exam- ple, should aim at "creat[ing] a quality of social interaction conducive to the flourishing of a vibrant community of life across the world" (11) and cliched exhortations-such as, to be "respectful of the otherness of the Other" (182). However, the general outlines of Sturm's politics of relationality are clear enough, even if he is fuzzy on the details. (To be fair, most work in contemporary social and political theory is sadly bereft of discussions of policy implications.) Firmly on the left side of the political continuum, he believes that social justice requires</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 283 worker control of industry, the attenuation of private property rights, and the replacement of bureaucratic rule of all sorts with more "dialogic" forms of ad- ministration. Sturm insists, moreover, that our entire collective life must be re- oriented from an anthropocentric perspective to one that takes into account the needs of the entire "community of life." "Big picture" books are risky enterprises; an author wishing to give an over- view of large-scale structures and processes and to prescribe changes to them needs to evince tough-minded analytical rigor and a taste for the concrete if the final product is to be more than a high-minded, well-intentioned, but useless set of platitudes and generalities. Unfortunately, Sturm is not up to the task. The book is full of sentences like the following: "We live in a world riven with deep antagonisms-ethnic and racial, sexual and religious, cultural and class. Perhaps such antagonisms will be with us always. But perhaps not. The shape of the future depends on how we think and what we do in the present" (181). Well, yes. So what? Lack of rigor is also found in the author's tendency to make highly tendentious assertions without a hint of justification or explana- tion. The reader is informed, for example, that a "principle of creative expres- sion" is a "corollary" of the maxim of social justice (220). One is tempted to ask: what do aesthetics have to do with justice, or morality in general? The author simply asserts, rather than argues for, his blurring of the lines between beauty and the Good. An especially egregious example of sloppy categorizing is found in chap- ter 11, where a laundry list of modern "annihilationist" political practices is pro- vided. Apparently, the contemporary American treatment of the unemployed and the homeless is as much an example of the "politics of annihilation" as Nazi genocide (214). Americans may be "more subtle," but are "no less effective" (ibid.). Such silliness becomes possible when one's definition of "the politics of annihilation" becomes so broad that it includes cases of isolation, exploitation, marginalization, and extermination of peoples (21 1). Isn't there an obvious moral risk incurred in lumping American policy toward the poor together with the Holocaust? The book is also rife with equivocations and special pleading. We must, claims Sturm, embrace the principle of nonviolence, but this need not cause us prob- lems if we wish to violently resist an oppressor (241). We need to recast the notion of human rights into a communitarian framework (1 8), but we can still remain stalwart cosmopolitans (267). We ought to reject anthropomorphism and ensure that all life-forms flourish, but we can readily champion human life over nonhuman life forms from time to time (36). And so on. One gets the impression of a naive faith that all good things, in principle, mesh together without remain- der or tension. It is a shame that Sturm, an avowed pluralist, never confronts the opposing view of a Max Weber or an Isaiah Berlin, that pluralism sometimes entails tragic conflict and choices.
