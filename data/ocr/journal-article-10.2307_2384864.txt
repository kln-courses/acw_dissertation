<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Deity Depicted by DONALD F. MCCALLUM Shinzo: Hachiman Imagery and Its Development. By Christine Guth Kanda. Harvard East Asian Monographs 119, 1985. xiv+135 pages; illustrated. $30.00. O _ .VER the past decade I have seen this study developed initially into a first-rate dissertation and then trans- formed from dissertation format to fully professional monograph. The reason I stress this process is to em- phasize the point that it is all too rare in the field of Japanese art history; a number of important disserta- tions have been written during the last ten or twenty years in the U. S., but only a few have actually appeared as books. Considering the time, effort, and money that have been devoted to Japanese art history, the published results have been decidedly thin. In particular, it has seemed to me for a long time that too much energy has been expended on the production of exhibition catalogues when what we really need are research monographs dealing with a wide range of key topics. It is to Dr Kanda's credit to have published an outstanding example of just such a monograph, and I hope that she has initiated a new trend in our field. Her study is organized into two major parts, the first dealing with gen- eral issues, the second consisting of detailed analyses of specific monuments; these two parts are preceded by an introduction and followed by a conclusion. In the introduction Dr Kanda lays out her assumptions and establishes her methodology and goals. The approach to shinzo (Shinto statues) is highly THE REVIEWER is an associate professor in the Department of Art, University of California, Los Angeles.</page><page sequence="2">478 Monumenta Nipponica, 41:4 affirmative-'Shinzo give concrete expression to the Japanese image of the numinous powers that animate the universe and give meaning to life,' and 'Study of [shinzo] unlocks aspects of Japanese aesthetic and religious history not readily accessible through written sources' (p. 1). Dr Kanda sees these im- ages as among the finest examples of wood sculpture in Japan and stresses the importance of the material. Since there is no traditional literature concerning 'Shinto art', she strives to formulate acceptable definitions, concentrating on the relations between shinzo and butsuzo (Buddhist statues). While recogniz- ing the strong influence of Buddhist art on the production of shinzo, she insists that they have a specifically Shinto component. This is undoubtedly true, although at times the argument seems slightly forced, as, for example, when the author asks whether the sculptors were perhaps 'unconsciously expressing their feelings about their gods' (p. 2). A search for what might be called the uniqueness of shinzo is a leit-motif throughout the study, a tendency that is not surprising in terms of the author's engagement with an important body of monuments. Turning from these broader issues, Dr Kanda outlines her analytical framework with regard to the actual statues by dividing them into two categories, the courtly and the syncretic. The former, depicted in court costume, can be seen as the ancestors of the imperial family and the great aristocratic clans. They are conceived of in a manner analogous to that of kami mentioned in Kojiki and Nihon Shoki. The syncretic category consists of kami who are modeled after Buddhist images, particularly Buddhist monks. While this distinction works quite well for male figures, at times it breaks down for the female deities. By and large, the courtly shinzo are found at shrines not intimately connected with Buddhism, while the syncretic shinzo are located in the subsidiary Shinto shrines (chinjusha) of Buddhist temples. The courtly examples tend to be conservative in style, showing a strong sensitivity to wood as a medium; the syncretic statues are apt to be more closely aligned with con- temporaneous Buddhist sculpture. In her general discussion, Dr Kanda creates some tension when she seems to characterize the qualities of shinzo in terms of the courtly group even though the major focus of the study in on three monuments belonging to the syncretic category. This tension be- tween Buddhist and Shinto ideas appears elsewhere in the study and will be discussed in greater detail below. In introducing her general discussion of function, Dr Kanda makes the somewhat peculiar statement, 'Shinzo, whether of the syncretic or courtly type, were not made primarily for aesthetic pleasure' (p. 3). Without the term 'primarily', the sentence might be informative, but the inclusion of the word tends to focus our attention in an inappropriate direction. Obviously the author recognizes this, since the following sentence reads, 'They serve magico- religious purposes.' She then goes on to an interesting discussion of the possi-</page><page sequence="3">MCCALLUM: The Deity Depicted 479 ble religious meaning of the statues, especially as the god-body (shintai or shotai) of the kami. Here a theoretical distinction between conceptions of Buddhist and Shinto images is developed. Particularly important is the fact that shinzoi were gener- ally kept as secret images, veiled from public exposure. While a related phenomenon exists in the Buddhist realm, where some statues are regarded as hibutsu, this tendency is far more pervasive in Shinto. This leads to certain in- terpretative problems when one attempts to analyze the stylistic characteristics of Shinto statues, since we must begin with the recognition that ordinarily they were not made with the intention of being seen. This being the case, it is hard to imagine the type of stylistic evolution that characterizes the flow of Japanese Buddhist sculpture during the same centuries. Even more basic, perhaps, is the fact that an actual image is not required in Shinto practice, since often another category of object, such as a mirror, can serve as the shintai. While the develop- ment of Buddhism as we know it is inconceivable without the presence of im- agery, it is easy to imagine Shinto continuing on essentially the same basic course without any images. I say this not to deprecate the significance of shinzo, but merely as a warning against interpretations that are too strongly determined by Buddhist ideas. Part I, 'Shinzo: Aesthetic, Religious, and Cultic Dimensions', deals with the broader issues and consists of four chapters. Chapter 1, 'The Genesis of Shinzo', discusses the origins of kami worship, pointing out the reasons why an indigenous tradition of image-making did not arise. The impact of Bud- dhism is then assessed, and information presented as to the earliest examples of the making of shinzo under that influence. On the basis of a careful analysis of the textual evidence, the author concludes that the production of shinzo began during the second half of the eighth century. Chapter 2, 'Aesthetic Dimensions', concentrates on matters of iconography, style, and technique. Here Dr Kanda expands her analysis of the courtly and syncretic modes, and shows how the latter category increases considerably in the later Heian and Kamakura periods. A rich body of material is presented in this section. In the discussions of style and technique during the Early Heian, Late Heian, and Kamakura periods, attention is paid to the development of Buddhist sculpture, since the analysis of stylistic and technical developments in the shinzo will be related to the Buddhist material. Chapter 3, 'Religious Dimensions', takes up once again the problem of func- tion. Dr Kanda states her opinion as to function unequivocally: 'The primary function of the shinzo is to give permanent and recognizable form to the kami' (p. 26). As the author points out, since there are no theoretical texts that elucidate the relationship between deity and image, we are at a disadvantage in putting forward interpretations. However, she concludes that in distinction to the theologically symbolic character of the Buddhist icon, the shinzoi was</page><page sequence="4">480 Monumenta Nipponica, 41:4 believed to be identical with the kami that it represented. As soon as it was animated, the shinzo was hidden in the innermost sanctum of the shrine, seldom or never seen thereafter. Following this analysis, Dr Kanda writes, 'The secrecy surrounding shinzo, a denial of the image's primary function of making visible the divine, is doubtlessly a byproduct of its role as shintai' (p. 27). This is a restatement of the 'primary function' of the shinzo quoted above, but there are complex issues here that warrant further study. In particular, the idea that secrecy is a 'denial' of the image's primary function strikes me as questionable. Could it not be the case that the believers ordinarily had a conception of the power of the kami who resided in the shrine that was not related to any efforts at visualization? I would suggest that further analysis is required of the nature of shinzo, shintai, and secrecy before we are able to present a fully articulated theoretical perspective on the 'object' of Shinto worship. Dr Kanda herself offers a number of good suggestions why the image was kept secret, including the idea that the shinzo was so powerful that it could not be exposed to people not properly prepared. She also proposes that the priests may have encouraged secrecy as a way to prevent encroachment on their roles as intermediaries between man and god. This last suggestion is of considerable importance since it involves a recognition of the fact that Shinto is a human in- stitution, subject to all the shortcomings of other human institutions. A poten- tially valuable line of research lies in further study of the role of the Shinto priesthood in manipulating cult and believers for its own benefit. Dr Kanda's third suggestion as to the reasons for secrecy has to to with the possibility of in- fluence from esoteric Buddhist practice. While this is undoubtedly the case, at least in part, with regard to Shinto statues, it does not seem to explain the per- vasiveness of the hiding of non-figurative shintai. Finally, the author suggests that the shrines may have 'lacked provision for the installation of imagery'. Some problems of causality arise here; if there had been a real need and desire for the display of shinzo, ways to show them would presumably have been found. The issue of secrecy is a crucial matter in Japanese religion. While I would not suggest that Dr Kanda is in any sense unaware of these problems, at times she tends to overlook them to a certain degree. Her study is focused on the con- crete, tangible qualities of shinzo, and so the fact that these images were basically not intended to be seen gets in the way a little. It is essential, however, that shinzo be analyzed in a way different from that usually employed for Buddhist icons. The second part of Chapter 3 considers patronage and devotional practices during the Heian and Kamakura periods. Here the author displays her com- mand of the Japanese religious tradition in explaining the impact of Tendai, Shingon, and Amidist ideas and practices on the development of shinzo wor- ship. The focus on Buddhist ideas can be seen in the analysis of the kechien</page><page sequence="5">MCCALLUM: The Deity Depicted 481 inscriptions on the Choanji Taroten Triad, 1130, and the Takano Shrine Zui- shin pair, 1164. While this discussion is interesting, it is necessary to recognize that the two monuments in question are uncharacteristic in various respects, including iconography and technique, and it therefore may not be wise to base a more general argument about kechien relations too exclusively on them. The core of Part 1 is Chapter 4, 'Hachiman Cult and Image', which presents a stimulating analysis of the development of the Hachiman cult. Dr Kanda ex- plains her reasons for focusing on Hachiman imagery, pointing out that such imagery is among the earliest shinzo, is the largest single group, and is widely distributed from Oita to Nagano. The discussion is too rich and detailed to allow for more than summary comments here, so I shall concentrate on just a few key points. The presentation is organized in terms of the four great centers of the state cult of Hachiman-the Usa Shrine in Kyushu, the shrine at Todaiji, the Iwashimizu Shrine near Kyoto, and the Tsurugaoka Shrine in Kamakura. Much interesting material is offered in the first section, 'Usa Shrine: The Origins and Early History of the Hachiman Cult'. Dr Kanda points out that Hachiman's name does not appear in Kojiki or Nihon Shoki, an unusual omis- sion for a deity with a nationwide cult. She then grapples with the problem of how a local cult developed in such a manner that it could spread widely at the appropriate time. A number of important factors are isolated, but I felt that greater emphasis might have been given to the political aspects, since it is unlikely that without strong political backing the Hachiman cult would have become as powerful as it did. The following section, 'Todaiji: The Hachiman Cult in the Nara Period', presents possible reasons for the transfer of the Hachiman cult to the center of national Buddhist worship in 749. Particular stress is laid on the Buddhist aspects of the cult as developed at Usa. There is also a discussion of the court's efforts at centralization, and it is suggested that the Usa Shrine may have been a significant politico-religious entity of use to the court in bringing Kyushu under state control. As I suggested above, political factors were probably of the greatest significance in the development and spread of the Hachiman cult. An additional political dimension appears in the discussion of the various oracles issued by Hachiman and the use of these pronouncements by contend- ing factions. Some decades after the transfer of the capital from Nara, a new official shrine called Iwashimizu Hachiman Shrine was established near Kyoto. This became the center of the Heian state cult of Hachiman and was intimately linked with dynastic and political issues of the time. It was from the Heian period that the concept of Hachiman as an imperial ancestor became impor- tant. The historical survey concludes in the fourth section, 'Tsurugaoka Shrine: The Hachiman Cult in the Kamakura Period'. Here the links between Hachiman and the Minamoto clan are traced, and the construction of shrines</page><page sequence="6">482 Monumenta Nipponica, 41:4 dedicated to the Hachiman cult in and near Kamakura is discussed. Efforts are also devoted to clarifying the nature of the cult during the Kamakura period, with particular stress laid on the Hachiman's rise in status at that time. At this point I would like to ask a question that concerns the four 'official' shrines just mentioned. As I understand Dr Kanda's text, there seems to be no evidence that any of these shrines had figural representations of Hachiman at the time of establishment; in fact, the evidence apparently suggests that their shintai were not images at all. If this is indeed the case, there is a significant discontinuity between the main theme of the monograph-Hachiman ima- gery-and the cult practices of the most important centers of Hachiman wor- ship. As I noted above, there is still a great deal of work to be done before we fully understand the status of shinzo within the broader context of Japanese religious practice. In the last section of Chapter 4, 'Sogyo Hachiman: Hachiman as a Monk', Dr Kanda examines the various theories advanced to explain this phe- nomenon. After rejecting some specific iconographical explanations, she opts for her own theory that it was not a specific prototype but rather the general image of the monk that produced the Sogyo Hachiman form. 'The monkish figure is a model of and a model for all those who follow in the Bud- dha's footsteps. It was ideally suited to the representation of a kami who had adopted Buddhist ways' (p. 46). This appears to place Hachiman squarely in the Buddhist context, and regardless of its significance for the total cult, it prepares the reader for the analysis of the central images of the second part of the book. Part II, 'Case Studies', consists of three chapters, each organized around a key monument of Hachiman imagery. All three are classified as National Treasures, which indicates their importance within the corpus of Japanese religious art. For that reason alone we must be grateful to have excellent monographic discussions of these images. In addition, each chapter discusses a number of other shinzo, attempting to place these statues within the ap- propriate art historical context. Some studies, such as Oka Naomi's Shinzoi Chokoku no Kenkyu, Kadokawa, 1971, discuss and illustrate a larger number of images, it is true, but in the case of Oka's book, for example, all the illustra- tions are small and in many cases virtually illegible. The volume including shinzo in Juyo Bunkazai, 5, Chokoku, 1972, Mainichi Shimbunsha, has a com- plete representation, but there are no discussions and the illustrations are small, although relatively legible. (To be precise, there are short discussions for three images that are reproduced in large color plates at the beginning of the volume.) Consequently, it is fair to say that Dr Kanda has assembled the largest collection of shinzo, adequately illustrated and discussed, that has appeared in any language, indeed, an enviable accomplishment. While the specialist will refer to the more comprehensive illustrations of specific monuments, for example, the Nara Rokudaiji Taikan volume for the Yakushi-</page><page sequence="7">MCCALLUM: The Deity Depicted 483 ji Hachiman group, the fact remains that the book under review is the most convenient and comprehensive study of shinzo currently available. Dr Kanda's achievement is even more impressive when one realizes the difficulties inherent in gaining photographic rights for shinzo in view of many shrines' reluctance to allow their images to be reproduced. Her only significant defeat was with the rights for the Onjoji Shinra, an unfortunate omission because I know from the author's other work that she has interesting things to say about that unusual image. My admiration for the author's accomplishments in Part II of her study is evident, and if I now deal with some of the problems that I perceive, readers should keep these comments within the appropriate context. Dr Kanda's study has stimulated me to attempt some alternative interpretations of various issues, but these interpretations would never have emerged without her work. In a sense, the degree to which this book prompts discussion and even con- troversy is an indication of its importance. It may be useful first of all to consider the overall organizational scheme of Part II. Dr Kanda has provided two chapters on the Heian period and one on the Kamakura. Each of these chapters begins with a detailed analysis of an im- portant Hachiman monument in one of the great Buddhist temples, followed by a more general discussion of shinzo dating from the same period. There are certain problems associated with this scheme, but first I would like to consider the overall significance of the three pivotal monuments. They are located at To- ji, Yakushiji, and Todaiji. All these temples were established by the imperial family, and Todaiji and Toji in particular played central roles in state Bud- dhism. Thus it must be recognized from the beginning that the core of this study is devoted to Hachiman statues that are embedded in a context of the most powerful Buddhist establishments. There is nothing wrong with this, of course, except that the author tends to juxtapose these images with other shinzoi with which they have no real connec- tion. As I noted in some comments concerning Part I, at times there seems to be an uneasy tension between Hachiman images in the service of the official Buddhist establishments and shinzoi in the service of Shinto. The very title of the monograph participates in this tension, since it does not really indicate whether the focus is on Shinto sculpture or Hachiman imagery. The author deals with both (and the two categories overlap), but an unwillingness to clarify certain issues has led to an ambiguous presentation. To me, the greatest achievement of the monograph is its analysis of the role of Hachiman imagery in the service of the official temples; the attempt to go beyond this sometimes leads to unsatisfying results. There is a further problem of structure. If one were attempting a stylistic survey of Early Heian (9th-lOth centuries), Late Heian (llth-12th centuries), and Kamakura (13th century) sculpted Buddha figures, one might select as exemplary monuments the Yakushi statues in Jingoji and Shin'yakushiji for</page><page sequence="8">484 Monumenta Nipponica, 41:4 the Early Heian, the Byodoin Amida for the Late Heian, and Unkei's Miroku in Kofukuji and a standing Amida by Kaikei for the Kamakura period. While exceedingly schematic, it would be possible in general terms to organize a good deal of the sculptural production of the various periods around this framework. Dr Kanda is an excellent analyst of Buddhist sculpture, and she seems to have adopted a paradigm derived from the Buddhist world to articulate her study of Shinto sculpture. But this paradigm does not work very well. The Toji Hachiman Triad has vir- tually nothing to do with other Shinto images of the ninth and tenth centuries in either style or technique. The Yakushiji Hachiman Triad, which heads the chapter dealing with the eleventh and twelfth centuries, is itself a monument of the early tenth century and has as much to do with the sculpture in the chapter on the ninth and tenth centuries as it does with that on the eleventh and twelfth. Finally, the single figure of Hachiman by Kaikei at Todaiji is a work in the mainstream of contemporaneous Buddhist sculpture, and it does not have significant progeny in terms of Shinto images. Again, I am not suggesting that the author is unaware of these issues, but only that the application of her chosen organizational structure sometimes throws things out of kilter. Chapter 5, 'The Toji Hachiman Triad: Shinzo of the Ninth and Tenth Cen- turies', deals with a limited body of material since there are relatively few pieces of sculpture extant from these centuries, particularly the ninth. The Toji Hachiman Triad is itself unique among shinzoi in that it is made in the dry-lac- quer technique (mokushin kanshitsu). This technique directly relates it to other images at Toji as well as to a number of ninth-century icons in various temples in what I have called elsewhere 'the Orthodox Style'. On the basis of detailed stylistic comparisons between this group and the Toji Hachiman Triad, Dr Kanda concludes that the latter dates from the third quarter of the ninth cen- tury. In addition to stylistic analysis, there is also a careful survey of the documentary evidence related to this triad. One of the fascinating features of the Toji Hachiman Triad is that all three statues were apparently made from the same decayed log, which the author interprets as meaning that the material was 'holy wood' (shimboku). What general significance should be attached to this remains unclear, since our knowledge of this fact is based on scientific investigations whereas otherwise it apparently was forgotten. The remainder of this chapter is taken up with a consideration of some of the most impressive of all shinzo. All of these statues are made of wood, in con- trast to the dry-lacquer technique employed for the Toji group, and they all belong to Dr Kanda's courtly group as opposed to the Toji images, which are of the syncretic category. In my view there is essentially no relationship be- tween the Toji group and the other statues discussed in the chapter, and thus their juxtaposition serves basically no function beyond contrasting the salient characteristics of the two stylistic categories. But if we consider the treatment</page><page sequence="9">MCCALLUM: The Deity Depicted 485 of these images as a unit, pried loose from any connection, implied or other- wise, with the Toji Triad, we will find solid and insightful discussion. The groups of images in the Matsunoo Shrine in Kyoto, the Kumano Hayatama Shrine in Wakayama, and the single female figure in Ozu Shrine, Shiga, are splendid examples of what I take to be the fundamental characteristics of 'pure' Shinto sculpture. In that sense, they differ substantially from the essen- tially Buddhist traits of the Toji Hachiman Triad. (The quotation marks around 'pure' signify an awareness that ultimately all shinzo- probably reflect the influence of Buddhist image-making; the distinction intended is between those that specifically employ elements derived from Buddhist imagery and those that do not.) Chapter 6, 'The Yakushiji Hachiman Triad: Shinzo of the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries', deals with a larger number of statues than does the preceding chapter. But, as noted above, there are significant organizational problems with it since the Yakushiji Triad that is its focus seems to have been made early in the tenth century. Aware of this difficulty, the author writes, 'Although it dates to the tenth century, and so has features relating to works discussed in Chapter 5, it also heralds developments in the shinzoi tradition of the following centuries' (p. 61). I would suggest that it would have been preferable to reorganize the presenta- tion instead of forcing the arguments into a preconceived format. The analysis of the Yakushiji Hachiman Triad itself, which is excellent, strives to place the images within the larger context of the wood-sculpture style and to this end they are compared with a series of Buddhist statues dating to the ninth and early tenth centuries. Surprisingly, there is little effort to compare the triad with the shinzo of the ninth and tenth centuries. In terms of technique, the author points out that the three images are made from the same log and also that the central axes of the statues are aligned from the heart of the tree. This latter practice was usually avoided because of the danger of cracking, and, as Dr Kanda notes, its usage here would seem to suggest a specific magical mean- ing. It is significant that both of the key Heian monuments-the present group and that at Toji-manifest a special reverence to what appears to have been regarded as holy wood. The chapter continues with a discussion of the rich variety of eleventh- and twelfth-century images. By and large these monuments do not reflect the radical changes in Buddhist image-making that became prominent at the begin- ning of the eleventh century, especially the joined-wood technique (yosegi- zukuri), but rather continue an essentially single-block technique from Early Heian. There are too many images discussed in this chapter to begin making comments here, but the reader will be well rewarded for a careful study of this section of the monograph. I especially enjoyed the discussions of the Zao Gongen images and those at the Daishogun Hachi Shrine, Kyoto. Considering</page><page sequence="10">486 Monumenta Nipponica, 41:4 that the five courtly statues believed to be from Usa are among the best il- lustrated in the book (plates 40-45), a somewhat fuller analysis of their qualities would have been appreciated. Chapter 7, 'The Todaiji Statue of Hachiman: Shinzo in the Kamakura Period', is probably the best of Part II and in that sense is analogous to Chapter 4 in Part I. On account of the extensive documentation extant, Dr Kanda presents a complete and interesting account of events preceding the making of Kaikei's statue in 1201, as well as of the prototypes that were employed to guarantee the authenticity of the image. All of this is possible because the statue was made for a prestigious temple and had a large group of patrons from the highest ranks of society. The sculptor himself, Kaikei, was one of the most important and active makers of Buddhist imagery of the time. Taken together, these factors place the Todaiji Hachiman squarely within a Buddhist context of the type that I have commented on above. In a sense, the Todaiji Hachiman may be seen almost as a culmination of a process of buddhification. There are numerous stimulating suggestions in the presentation of the Todai- ji project. In discussing the matter of prototype, Dr Kanda argues that the Todaiji authorities were unaware of the Hachiman images at Toji and Yakushi- ji. If this assertion can be sustained, it adds a further dimension to the concept of secrecy discussed above. Concerning the Todaiji project, the author observes, 'Making an image of so powerful a deity as Hachiman was no light matter' (p. 78). This perception forces us to look at the making of shinzo in a way different from that which we normally employ for the study of Buddhist imagery. Chapters 5 and 6 had a rather troubling paucity of Hachiman statues, other than the two key monuments, for a study devoted to Hachiman imagery. This lack resulted in some of the discontinuities observed in the two sections of each chapter. However, in the case of the present chapter there are a number of Hachiman representations dating after the Todaiji image that can be compared with it. The author argues that the production of the Todaiji Hachiman established a precedent for other shrines and temples. If this is true, it may ac- count in part for the larger number of Hachiman images in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Four Hachiman images in the syncretic mode, that is, representations as monks, at Shomyoji, Yokohama; Konshoji, Shiga; Tsuboi Hachimanga, Osaka; and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts are discussed. While none of these is based specifically on Kaikei's image, they do relate to the overall conception of Hachiman as monk (Sogyo Hachiman). Even more interesting are two examples of Hachiman in court dress, belong- ing to Dr Kanda's other category. Although it is not known when this represen- tational mode was first applied to Hachiman, the author suggests that it was in the Kamakura period when Hachiman's position as an ancestor of both the</page><page sequence="11">MCCALLUM: The Deity Depicted 487 imperial family and the Minamoto clan overshadowed his association with Buddhism. Interestingly, the two courtly images are shown in quite different types of robes: the figure in Hatogamine Shrine, Nagano, is dressed in soft court robes, while that of the Akaana Shrine, Shimane, in the heavily starched robes that we know so well from secular portraiture. It is probably important to note that these two figures are found in shrines rather distant from the centers of power. The balance of this chapter deals with some Kamakura and post-Kamakura representations of deities other than Hachiman. Here, too, there are many lucid and interesting discussions. The Conclusion provides a brilliant recapitulation of the basic themes developed in the preceding chapters, and I am hard put to think of many other pages in histories of Japanese art that I have found so rewarding. As many of my comments will have made clear, I am in substantial disagreement with Dr Kanda on various issues, but this is hardly the point; any study that can so stimulate the reader warrants the highest praise. Rather than take up any of these specific problems again, I would like to focus on one general issue to which I alluded above; namely, the stylistic se- quence of Shinto sculpture. In her Conclusion, the author presents a careful contrast between the Toji Hachiman Triad and the main pair of images at the Matsunoo Shrine (plates 10 &amp; 12). She recognizes that the former is un- characteristic for a shinzoi in terms of style and technique, whereas the latter seems to fall within the mainstream of Shinto sculpture. Taking advantage of this perception, I would propose a tentative sequence of Heian shinzo that ex- cludes the Toji triad and de-emphasizes the Yakushiji Hachiman Triad. The proposed sequence would run: (1) Ninth Century: Matsunoo Male and Female Deities (plates 10-12); (2) Tenth Century: Hayatama Okami (plate 15), Fusumi Okami (plate 18), and Uga no Mikoto (plate 20); (3) Eleventh Century: Ketsumiko Okami (plate 32); (4) Twelfth Century: Male and Female Deities in the Cleveland Museum of Art (plates 40 &amp; 41), Male and Female Deities in the Burke Collection (plates 42 &amp; 43), and the Female Deity in the Yamato Bunkakan (plate 44). The implications of this sequence are that it enables us to understand the major developments of Heian-period shinzo quite adequately without referring to the two Hachiman Triads. The situation becomes more complicated in the Kamakura period, but there too I believe there is a mainstream that is not influenced by Hachiman imagery, certainly not by Kaikei's statue in Todaiji. If this argumentation is accepted, it suggests less of a relationship be- tween Hachiman imagery and other shinzo than is implied by Dr Kanda's approach. This returns us to the Buddhist-Shinto tensions discussed above, for the main Hachiman images (those of Toji, Yakushiji, and Todaiji) are so strongly embedded within a Buddhist context that they seem unlikely to have had much, if any, influence outside of that context.</page><page sequence="12">488 Monumenta Nipponica, 41:4 My conclusion is that there are basically three categories of shintai: (1) Hachiman images and other syncretic deities closely allied to Buddhism; (2) shinzo of the type presented in my tentative sequence that do not mani- fest specifically Buddhist elements; and (3) the vast majority of shintai that are not anthropomorphic. Dr Kanda presents a comprehensive analysis of the first group, and while she has provided insightful discussions of individual examples of the second group, I am not convinced that they are properly located as a category in the format of her study. She does not really deal with the third category, and it might be asked why she should in a study specifically devoted to shinzoi. However, several statements in the book suggest the idea that somehow shinzo represent a radically new conception of the kami, possibly even one that is in some way superior to other approaches. 'The appearance of shinzo signals a growing emphasis on the perception of kami as anthropomorphic beings rather than as formless powers or the forces of nature' (p. 88). Not being a specialist in Shinto, I am at a loss to analyze this assertion, but I cannot help thinking that Ise, Izumo, Suwa, and many other shrines of the highest importance function perfectly well without shinzoi. Dr Kanda's monograph has motivated me, a specialist in Buddhist sculpture, to examine more closely the role of concrete imagery in Japanese religious practice. She has answered many questions most satisfactorily, and suggested solutions to numerous other problems. What she has only begun to address is the larger question of representations or manifestations of the kami in Shinto as a whole. This perhaps may not be her task, but it is still a necessary one, for her monograph, bound to be influential and widely read, may leave students with the impression that shinzo are a typical feature of Shinto shrines throughout Japan, rather than being uncharacteristic and even somewhat peculiar within the Shinto tradition.</page></plain_text>
