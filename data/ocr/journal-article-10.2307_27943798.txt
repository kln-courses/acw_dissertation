<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PHILOSOPHICAL VENTURE: A PERSONAL ACCOUNT Charles S. MHIigan It is gratifying to be invited to set forth aspects of my own philosophical development, of learning, and unlearning. There is an element of coll?gial recognition, which I cherish, but also, the subject is not one that I would have assigned myself but one that interests me more than would be seemly to admit. As Thoreau said, MWe are subjects of an experiment which is not a little interesting to me." I appreciate this opportunity. It is difficult to deal with intellectual development apart from events and experiences, but I will try to keep that side of things to a minimum. Events and life experiences have shaped my thinking throughout and at times more than either books or academic pursuits. That probably pertains to almost everyone, but especially if one is an existentialist (which I am not) or a radical empiricist (which I am). Just consider the incredible changes, convulsions, achievements, and obscenities that have occurred since 1918, when I was born, and now, and you will appreciate how tempting it is to veer off excessively into personal matters in relation to rapid social changes. I. Early Influences I grew up in a reverent, but not pietistic, Presbyterian family of southerners transplanted to Colorado where I was born. In time, I drifted away from Presbyterianism and any form of Calvinism, with a couple of exceptions. The church was really two churches under one roof. There was the church, presided over by an educated and civilized minister, and there was the Sunday School. One of my teachers, whatever the Golden Text was, taught that Catholics down the street were storing gun powder in their church basement to be used when they start their revolution to take over the country and make the pope king. Another taught that Christ was going to come down out of the sky any day now, because some rock was splitting in two in the Holy Land. If any of us were doing anything bad or thinking naughty thoughts, we would go to hell along with Jews and assorted others. This was the fare at times in younger years, but they did not teach me. Something in my home environment had inoculated me effectively against the poisons of abstract hatred, fundamentalism, fear, and racism of that type. I had hatred of mean playmates and fear of bullies, but they were very specific, not of generalized classes. I am unable to specify at all when or how or what that inoculation was, and it may not have been articulated. I find it interesting that lessons that I can recall vividly and explicitly had no effect at all, whereas those that took hold effectively were either quite unawares or too subtle to</page><page sequence="2">122 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy be capable of recall. I am sure that some of that childhood atmosphere has affected all the years since, including my intellectual perceptions. Although I drifted away from it, exposure to Calvinism seeps into your bones and reflexes in disguised ways. I will mention two ideas which illustrate this. One is the awesome majesty of God. If you are going to use the term at all, and make any sense, awesome majesty is a necessary quality of God, regardless of how God is conceived. This theological conditioning has been accompanied by a strong allergy to cozy, privatistic, manipulate sorts of gods. I recognized fairly early the paradox that the further God is regarded as removed from us (e.g., "up there"), the more God is viewed in Fairy Godmother terms, whose chief work is my personal convenience and benefit, thanks to Jesus, who died for this very purpose. As long as I can remember, I have found that type of God uninteresting and potentially dangerous. The other disguised but lingering Calvinist contribution has been a predisposition to believe that the importance of our daily decisions has been greatly exaggerated. Much of the material on "decision making" has seemed trivial and pretentious to me. I am speaking of personal decisions, for clearly this does not pertain to decisions of social and public responsibility. Early on, Freud and Jonathan Edwards reenforced my inclination about this. Now, admittedly, a few of life's personal decisions are truly crucial, but even there Freud convinced me that much of our presumed wisdom in decision making is really greater skill in the art of self-deception and adroit rationalization. One reason people like to believe that they are being led through life by God or Jesus or Mary or a guardian angel or a channel-or all of the above-is that circumstances and unforeseeable developments have had more to do with the direction of their pilgrimage than their own determinations. Viewed in retrospect, it has pattern and direction, simply because "way leads on to way" [Frost] and "ends are the outcome of means and the existential matrix" [Dewey]. In short, the universe is orderly in that sense. To confront the haphazardness of existence is surely less comforting than having a private, cosmic guardian-also less childish. I held then and still do that we are much more interesting and complicated than being merely "the ensemble of our decisions" [Sartre]. These views of mine are far more the result of conditioning than of a rationally drawn objective conclusion, but they do include the effort to think clearly. And while they may contribute to an attitude of trust and confidence, in practice they can be very aggravating to colleagues and others. To give but one example: after a faculty committee has worked for months or longer on, say, curriculum revision and finally has come to the moment of decision, it does not endear one to them to express-however gently and eloquently-the view that the new, innovative plan will not make any significant educational difference. I am convinced, however, on the basis of observation that the way we travel the road taken is generally far more important than the selection of one road rather than another. One other early influence which contributed to certain predispositions was the Boy Scouts, a very important part of my adolescence, and being a</page><page sequence="3">Vol.13, Nos. 2 and 3, May/September 1991 123 camp staff member later on. My life-long commitment to ecology grew out of that. II. Student Years As a college and seminary student, I was a typical liberal socialist, believing in gradual progress, in basic human goodness, and that conflicts, by and large, can be resolved by communication, tolerance, and patient understanding. In particular, I had a touching faith that people learn by experience, and when policies and methods prove demonstrably disastrous, most people are capable of reconsideration and the modification of their methods. I believed, for I had been taught, that people act in accord with their own self-interest, as nations act in terms of their own national interest. Needless to say, I have subsequently found precious little evidence to support either generalization. I still hold to those liberal tenets, but with more restraint and many qualifications. I no longer regard recitation of them in a litany as particularly helpful. I remember too well a conversation with Bishop Rice when I was in seminary. I must explain that Bishop Rice, a local character, had founded his own church and proclaimed himself Vicar of the Universe. He ran a skid row rescue mission and I never could decide whether he was quite mad, or a genius, or both. His calling was to expose the follies of political and religious leaders, and he never ran out of material. What he said to me was, "Milligan, you are never going to amount to a hill of beans in the field of religion as long as you think religion can be rational. The crazier, the better!" I am sure that I looked at him with a graduate student's superior indulgence. That was in 1941. Today, I would still disagree with him, but it would be with far less self assurance. In passing, I have to say that in college and seminary years my consuming interest was music, and it was through that that I made my way financially. But I am unable to point to any definite connections with my intellectual conceptions other than an interest in aesthetics and value theory. It was in classes in philosophy and religious studies that I was awakened academically and became a serious student. I will not single out formative teachers, but must state that I was extremely fortunate in that respect at the University of Denver, lliff, and Harvard. My own philosophical orientation was naturalistic empiricism. I had a particular interest in causality, being dissatisfied with positivism's critique. How is it that patterned forces impinge upon a life situation to culminate in definite consequences? I called this the teleological phenomenon. My Ph.D. dissertation was a project spread over nine years and examined the teleological theories of C. E. M. Joad, W. E. Hocking, and Samuel Alexander. It ran to 664 pages and has not been of absorbing interest to anyone since, but it was not wasted effort, for it forced me to develop my own metaphysical thought and a philosophical basis for my theological position.</page><page sequence="4">124 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy In the course of this I discovered that I was really a pantheist. In the dissertation, I called my position "dynamic pantheism" to distinguish it from Plotinian or Hegelian types of pantheism. At the time, I was unaware of William James's comments in 1907 that the brand of pantheism available to empirically-minded persons was hard for them to assimilate, since It is the absolutistic brand, spurning the dust and reared upon pure logic. It keeps no connexion whatever with concreteness."1 I am sure I had read that, but it had not registered or else was operative at a subliminal level. In any case, I was forced to acknowledge a fundamental difference between my type of naturalistic pantheism and the many historical varieties of Vedanta, Neo platonism, and Absolute Idealism. In addition to James, the writers who influenced me then were Dewey, Wieman, and others of the Chicago School. In college I had found Dewey simplistic, mainly reiterating what everybody knew. However, in my dissertation research, I became captivated by such works of his as Art as Experience, Experience and Nature, Human Nature and Conduct, and The Quest for Certainty. Although I do not return to Dewey as often as to some others, I believe that I have resonated more fully to his thought than with that of any other philosopher or theologian. From this I learned that there are two ways to read most thinkers and that one's first reading may be utterly different from a second. The later, considered judgment may either upgrade one's evaluation or the reverse. Now Dewey was not a pantheist. He identified God primarily with ethical and artistic endeavor-"the active relation between ideal and actuaf-which seemed to me too restrictive. We humans are naturally most interested in how our conception of God relates to human life, but, given our propensity toward hubris, it is salutary and salvific to attend also to how one's view of God's nature relates to plants and animals, to cosmic evolution, astrophysics, microbiology, galaxies, and viruses. In fact, one of the greatest contributions of mature religion is to redeem us from hubris and anthropocentrism. This restriction of Dewey's God to the ideal interacting with the actual, which thereby focuses on human involvement, although he emphatically included the cooperative support of nature, seems to me to have been a hangover from his earlier Hegelianism. He wrote in 1890: Every concrete act of knowledge involves an intuition of God; for it involves a unity of the real and the ideal, of the objective and the subjective.2 The religious life ... says that that of which alone the individual can be sure as matter of fact, namely, his private self, is unreal, and that the sole reality is the perfect and universal personality, God, who cannot be immediately felt to be. It asserts that this Personality is not only ideal... but that it is perfectly real.3 1. William James, Pragmatism (New York: Longmans, Green, 1907), pp. 70f. 2. John Dewey, Psychology, 2d ed. (New York: Harper, 1890), pp. 244f. 3. Ibid., p. 340.</page><page sequence="5">Vol. 13, Nos. 2 and 3, May/September 1991 125 God, as the perfect personality or Will, is the only Reality, and the Source of all activity.4 In terms of a Neo-Hegelian idealism, you could combine pantheism with God as ideal reality, because God was imagined as a person. What Dewey did when he discarded Absolute Idealism was to throw away the pantheism but retain the God concept of tension between ideal and real. But in terms of his newly embraced empiricism, the only beings who have commerce with ideals are humans. He should have retained his pantheism (with considerable revision), and discarded the limited conception of God as tension between (now) human ideals and objective reality. In fairness to Dewey's later views, I must add that he emphasized the natural, environmental context for both religion and ethics. "A humanistic religion, if it excludes our relation to nature, is pale and thin, as it is presumptuous, when it takes humanity as an object of worship."5 And again, ". . . what I have tried to show is that the ideal itself has its roots in natural conditions; it emerges when the imagination idealizes existence by laying hold of the possibilities offered to thought and action."6 Although attracted to the ethical aspect of humanism, such passages in Dewey enabled me to see why I was repelled by its too cozy religion and evangelistic tone. I was far more at home with the views of Wieman, Mathews, Case, Bernhardt, Bergson, and the British creative evolution people such as Uoyd Morgan, Smuts, and Alexander. But Dewey combined naturalistic metaphysics, sensitive environmentalism, and an insightful treatment of human experience best for me. As for taking the pantheistic path in theology, consider this passage from Dewey to indicate how neatly his thought can be conjoined with pantheism. Natural piety .. . may rest upon a just sense of nature as the whole of which we are parts, while it also recognizes that we are parts that are marked by intelligence and purpose, having the capacity to strive by their aid to bring conditions into greater consonance with what is humanly desirable. Such piety is an inherent constituent of a just perspective in life.7 My purpose is not primarily to reconcile my position with Dewey's, but to acknowledge my debt to his later writings and to suggest that pantheism can be adapted to it. My Harvard Ph.D. dissertation (1951) was a detailed examination of Whitehead's epistemology and metaphysics, with particular attention given to changes in his views at different stages. I also gave special focus to his doctrine of the Divine Eros as representing a shift from his God concepts of 4. Ibid., p. 422. 5. John Dewey, A Common Faith (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1934), p. 54. 6. Ibid., p. 48. 7. Ibid., p. 25.</page><page sequence="6">126 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy the 1920s. My concluding chapter was again a proposal for pantheism, aesthetically conceived, as an alternative view, in general harmony with Whitehead's philosophy, but different in the category to which the term God pertains. Note that I do not say simply a different concept, but a shift in category.8 This use of Whitehead is in accord with his own view of the legitimacy of a variety of perspectives in religion. I do not hold it to be possible, or even desirable, that identity of detailed belief can be attained. But it is possible... amid diversities of belief... to reach a general agreement as to those elements, in intimate human experience and in general history, which we select to exemplify that ultimate theme of the divine immanence, as a completion required by our cosmologica! outlook. In other words, we may agree as to the qualitative aspects of religious facts, and as to their general way of coordination in metaphysical theory, while disagreeing in various explanatory formulations. These interests of mine at that time were quite off the main path being pursued in philosophy, namely analytic philosophy, and in religion, namely existentialism and neo-orthodoxy. I was a bit slow in coming to grasp the significant contributions of analytic philosophy and existentialism, but taught both many times with genuine but selective appreciation. I never did arrive at a state of grace sufficient to appreciate neo-orthodoxy, with the exception of Reinhold Niebuhr's political philosophy. III. Social Ethics and Social Action Social philosophy and ethics had been a major interest and area of study for me throughout. When I joined the 11 iff faculty in 1957, it was as associate professor of Christian ethics. I had been a pacifist, based on claims of conscience. With the development of the hydrogen bomb in 1952,1 became a nuclear pacifist, approving the use of force when indisputably necessary to preserve peace and prevent thermonuclear holocaust. Even before that, it was dawning on me that there was something self-centered and self righteous about my brand of pacifism in that its validity was justified by condemnation of war and its many attendant evils: arms profiteering, bungled or neglected diplomacy, and xenophobia. The condemnation is surely defensible, but those evils do not automatically confer ideological virtue on 8. Category here means a comprehensive class, designating the boundaries within which all members of the class belong and excluding everything not belonging to that classification. Categories establish data determinants, which is their most important function. Concepts explicate particular content and claims within a given category. For the way that this pertains to the category of God and various concepts of God, see William H. Bernhardt, The Cognitive Quest for God," The Journal of Religion XXIII (April 1943): 92f. 9. A. N. Whitehead, Adventures of Ideas (New York: Macmillan, 1933), p. 206.</page><page sequence="7">Vol.13, Nos. 2 and 3, May/September 1991 127 one's personal disengagement from world tragedies. This painful shift was galvanized in 1954 by a collection of statements about implications of the H bomb by twenty-two people. Among them the political figures not only made more sense than the religious leaders, they were far more sensitive to the meaning of massive earthly destruction. I realized more acutely than ever how the rhetoric of piety can numb the brain. Consider, for example, this statement by one famous theologian: The reaction to this possibility [of the annihilation of humanity] . . . should be the certainty that the meaning of human history, as well as of everyone's life within it, is not dependent on the time or the way in which history comes to an end. For the meaning of history lies above history."10 Or this from the Quaker, D. Elton Trueblood, who at that time was Eisenhower's Chief of Religious Policy, recognizing the possible total destruction of human life, and then adding: ... but for the truly religious man, in the Western or Biblical sense, it does not give us despair because we never supposed that this physical world was permanent or necessary to God's plan. Even though this world be rolled up as a scroll, God and God's purposes remain. The bomb may help us to understand wherein our deepest faith consists.11 I cannot express adequately how callous and outrageous that type of piety struck me then and ever since. There is something sick about any theology that can look with serene equanimity upon a holocaust of earthly life because its God is safe and untouched. What kind of God is that anyway? Theologians at that time were not the only ones out of touch. Many philosophical ethicists were similarly aloof, more interested in preserving their theory from attack by colleagues than in finding significantly helpful engagement with the realities of the world. Bertrand Russell, who must be counted among the greatest minds of the twentieth century and perhaps of any age, had been saying for decades that philosophical ethics had nothing of importance to contribute to social problems. Yet all the while that did not restrain him from vigorous promotion of specific causes close to his heart on the grounds that they were "right." A typical statement of his: . . . bad philosophy has practical consequences, while good philosophy has none_The practical man may be pardoned if he comes to the conclusion that truth is unattainable except when it is unimportant.12 10. Paul Tillich was the author of this statement. He changed his view substantially later. This remarkable series appeared in The Pulpit Digest (June 1954). The quotation is from p. 32. 11.

All systems of ethics embody the desires of those who advocate them, but this fact is concealed in a mist of words.13 Of course in the sixties Russell became one of the foremost activists in the cause of peace and left no doubt that nuclear war would not be merely undesirable, but wrong. As far as I know, he did not attempt a revision of his ethical philosophy to account for and justify this shift away from his emotivist position. I have gone into these matters by way of indicating the religious and philosophical trends in the mid-century period. From 1958 to 1974, like so many others, I was involved in social action and political protest to the limits of my energy. The range of causes was extravagant. For several years, I was moderator on a weekly television panel dealing with public issues and during the height of the Vietnam war had a four-hour talk radio program every Sunday morning. I will spare you a recitation of all the boards and committees and demonstrations. It would not be very different from that of many academics at that time. What is pertinent is to list at least some of the ethical conclusions I came to out of those experiences of social activism. 1. Ethics is an applied art, partly theoretical and partly practical. In that respect, it is like the practice of medicine or architecture or ministry, which requires knowledge and skill, but cannot be an exact science. When it attempts to be an exact science-that is, to be purely abstract--, it becomes metaethics and tends toward elaborate irrelevancies. When it attempts to be merely practical-with contempt for theory-applied ethics becomes a silly form of apologetics at best and fanaticism at worst. Informed ethics is not a matter of being one part theory and another part praxis; it is a thoroughly interwoven mixture of critical reason and actual, involved experience. The purpose of ethics is to contribute to value realization in life and that over extended periods of time, including across the generations. This brings me to the subject of value. 2. Values (actual, real values) are not things; they are not ideal entities; they are not emotions. They may well be accompanied by things, ideals, and emotions. Values are relations-certain kinds of relations. Values are relations which create, sustain, and enhance the significance of life. Thus, values are adjectival; they pertain to concrete beings and experiences. They are qualities. Much cant would be avoided in value theory if discussions paid more attention to the elemental value, nourishment. Strictly speaking, food is not an actual value; it has potential value. It becomes value only when it is consumed, digested, and enters into life with the qualities of strength and 13. Bertrand Russell, "The Elements of Ethics," Philosophical Essays (London: Longmans, Green, 1910).</page><page sequence="9">Vol. 13, Nos. 2 and 3, May/September 1991 129 health. One of the sayings of Epicurus makes the point: 'The beginning and root of all good is the pleasure of the stomach; even wisdom and culture must be referred to this."14 The understanding of discourse about value ought to begin with the most rudimentary, universal, and indisputable values, such as nourishment, health, species survival; not with the most confusing instances. If someone does not recognize nourishment as a form of value, I do not see how any significant discourse on this subject can proceed. It would be a perverse sophistry to argue that, since various cultures have very different views and preferences about foods, we cannot arrive at any firm views about healthy diets and unhealthy ones or conclude that cultural diversities make it impossible to arrive at the conclusion that adequate nourishment is a value and starvation an evil. Yet that is precisely the line of reasoning one encounters in abstract discussions of value. At the same time, it must be obvious that nourishment applied to actual persons is very relative and must take into account the state of health, age, allergies, cultural conditioning, etc. I hope it is also obvious that I am speaking of life values, not economic or exchange values. But what are we to make of instances in which nourishment, for example, would seem not to be of value, as when fasting is called for or in a terminal illness where nourishment fed through intravenous mechanisms against one's will Is surely evil? In the latter case, where there is no possibility of enhancing life significance, nourishment which simply prolongs the dying process is certainly not a value. In the case of fasting, say as a mode of political statement in a just cause, we must keep in mind that the state of one's mind and spirit is a part of one's total health. To clarify distinctions does not mean that decisions in highly problematic circumstances will be easy or made with certitude. Given the great amount of talk in the public forum about "value," it is important to get it straight about such elemental things as that radioactive poisoning and malnutrition are disvalues; they are not cultural peculiarities but facts, facts about life values. 3. Another source of confusion arises from the failure to differentiate between evaluative judgments and actual values. This confusion is compounded because the word "value" is used to designate both of these distinctly different items. Your opinion may or may not be well founded, but in either case, it is differentiate from facticity. Your estimate of ten yards distance is one kind of thing; a strip of carpet is another. Evaluations are often called values, but they refer to the relative worth which persons confer upon things. Evaluations are judgments. Real values as I am using the term refer to actual conditions that sustain or enhance the significance of life. They refer to existent and specifiable qualities such as health, friendship, growth, enjoyment, justice, creativity, wonder, love, and discovery. 4. Qualities of things and processes are no less real than things themselves. Things, in fact, do not exist apart from their qualities, relations, 14. Epicurus, Fragments, no. 59.</page><page sequence="10">130 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy and attributes; they exist with and in terms of their qualities. Authentic relations are internal, not merely external attachments, and they are constitutive. As William James said, The thing as actually present in a given world is there with all its relations. . . ."15 Whitehead developed this line of thought. Rejecting the classical view that the final real entities are substances supporting qualities," in his philosophy of universal relatedness, he asserted that the entities, which are the ultimate actual things, are in some sense procedures of organization."16 5. Ethics has to do with value realization in human lives and the processes and environing conditions that contribute to that. In sharp contrast are practices and environs that harm or destroy values. Schweitzer was correct when he wrote, The great fault of all ethics hitherto has been that they believed themselves to have to deal only with the relations of man to man. In reality, however, the question is what is his attitude to the world and all life that comes within his reach."17 Ethics as an art is inescapably contextual and relational, having to do with actual lives in their actual circumstances, actual social structures in their real time and places, actual limitations, and opportunities. Hence, most debates in ethics about relativism versus absolutism have addressed pseudo-issues, and not surprisingly generated great heat and little light. 6. In accord with ethics as thoroughly relational, I have had to adjust and revise my stand on several issues. For example, I have been involved in prison reform and the abolition of capital punishment for thirty-five years. I still am, but the social conditions, facts, and trends have changed dramatically, so that the issues which were debated even twenty years ago are now less relevant. Given the way that hostilities have hardened so pervasively, it is small wonder that the methods, worldwide, that were demonstrable failures for years are now pursued with re-doubled determination. Another example of a painful shift has to do with Israel, whose policies I defended vigorously for years. It was during the invasion of Lebanon in 1982, after Israeli forces went far beyond the original purpose of making Israel's northern border more secure, that I had to admit that I must not try to justify policies of the Begin government and Sharon's army of wanton destruction. The sad performance since December 8,1987, in Gaza and the West Bank is simply an extension of this madness. So, I am still a friend of the people of Israel, but not its fundamentalist administration. I have been involved in the American-Israeli Civil Liberties Coalition, which within Israel bravely exposes the cruel and illegal practices. I do not see how in today's world, with so many sudden twists and reversals, one can avoid attempting 15. William James, The Will to Believe (New York: Longmans, Green, 1896), p. 278. 16.

Merely to mention China at this particular time is enough to emphasize the absolute necessity for revising policies as circumstances change in basic ways and the utter folly of doctrinaire positions unrelated to existing realities. 7. One of the pressing needs in dealing with ethical problems and issues is an understanding of the critical importance of degrees of value or disvalue, of good or evil. Surely it is one of the hallmarks of maturity to be able to differentiate between a mountain and a molehill, but even more than that, to be able to make distinctions of degrees between such extremes. A definite symptom of intellectual immaturity is the habit of thinking and discussing only in terms of extremes. In logic, we call this the fallacy of the invalid dichotomy: for example, Are you my friend or do you disagree with something I have said? It also takes the form of illicit extension: If you don't think all murderers should be executed, then I suppose you think Hitler was a saint. Relational comprehension has this much needed contribution to make: that, in addition to emphasis upon the fact that everything is to be understood in terms of its relationships within other phenomena, it recognizes that usable understanding of things must include qualities and forces in degrees of more, still more, greater, and less. I do not think anything has disturbed me more in a life of social involvement than the widespread immaturity of educated people who habitually think along lines of either/or extremes with an inability to think in terms of degrees of value. 8. I have been forced to acknowledge that when social action is effective it usually is engaged in protest. Now, every protest against social wrongs implies a belief, by way of contrast, in something that would be right. Nevertheless, the history of successes-abolition of slavery, child labor, racial discrimination, Vietnam, oppression of women-is a record of opposition to something wrong, what people were against far more than what they were for. The reasons are not obscure. Negative opposition can be focussed and, upon its success, disbanded. Positive programs invite debate, encounter delay, require compromising adjustments, and produce burnout-as the biblical phrase has it, cause us to "grow weary in well doing." Many social actionists, I am here to tell you, have never understood this and perceive themselves as agents of constructive social change. The less change they see occurring, the more the level of rhetoric is raised. But the methods of social protest are ill-suited for the architecture of constructive social programs. Demolition and architecture are two very different enterprises. Furthermore, when religious institutions or ideologues have gained control of a society-whether Christian or Jewish or Muslim or Confucian or whatever-the results have not been uniformly happy. Church-type people need to come to some recognition of this. I must emphasize that protest movements have sometimes made great contributions. Righteous indignation is a powerful motivating force and we owe much to it, but it does not build ongoing social structures and programs.</page><page sequence="12">132 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy The tragedy is that humanity is now at the stage where constructive cooperation is crucial. But this requires two things which we humans find extremely painful to engage in: (i) cooperation with others beyond our own circle or nation when it is not for the sake of killing or environmental destruction, but for human health and well-being; (ii) staying with tasks that lack immediate pay-off or social recognition in the near future. At the very time that international cooperation has become absolutely necessary to earthly survival, we have seen the United Nations cut back and cut down, when there was every reason to strengthen its programs and improve its good offices. It has always seemed to me that a strong religious faith ought to contribute to durable commitment for universal human good, through thick and thin, over the long haul. With some that is the case, but looking at the world and including our own country, it is far more evident that religious fundamentalism of various brands has been a major force in promoting wars, hatred, hunger, oppression, and idolatrous nationalism. The prophetic voice is active inside and outside the temples of worship, but it is not apparent to me that it is heard and heeded very widely among church people. The tone is virtually biblical; the voice is secular: "If we do it wrong, scattering pollutants, clouding the atmosphere with too much carbon dioxide, extinguishing the thin carapace of ozone, burning up the forests, dropping the bombs, rampaging at large through nature as though we owned the place, there will be a lot of paying back to do and, at the end, nothing to pay back with."18 In summarizing these conclusions I have come to, I am afraid that it sounds dogmatic and simplistic. I recognize that each of these claims requires explanation and justification, but that is beyond the present purpose. At the least, I must acknowledge the deficiency. IV. Philosophy of Religion and Theology In this section I will not attempt to summarize my philosophy, but deal with selected subjects which are matters of diverse views and debate. Back in the early 1950s when neo-orthodoxy was riding high, Julius Seelye Bixler gave an address in Cambridge and told this story. Thirty or so years earlier when he and his friend, S. Ralph Harlow, were young, they were commiserating about how conservative the older faculty members were in their respective colleges. Then they began to wonder: "When we ourselves have grown old, what will the new ideas of the young turks be, which we as old men will be opposing?" Bixler then went on to say, "We speculated on all kinds of things, but the one thing which never occurred to us was that it would be orthodoxy." The laughter of the audience was raucous. I have to tell you that it did not remotely cross my mind on that occasion that in my own case, twenty and thirty years later, it would be fundamentalism. 18. "The United Nations and the Global Environment," UNA-USA Factsheet (1989).</page><page sequence="13">Vol. 13, Nos. 2 and 3, May/September 1991 133 This is a subject on which my thinking has changed. I used to think of fundamentalism as simply more rigid and intransigent than, say, evangelicalism. I believed in dialogue with any religious group, including fundamentalism. I accepted clich?s about having a different view, but yet "respecting their views" and "having reverence for their reverence." I was, of course, deceiving myself, for I did not really respect the views of fundamentalists; I respected their legal right to hold and express their views. What opened my insight as to what I really thought was reflection about fundamentalism in other faiths, particularly Judaism and Islam at first, but it slowly dawned on me that it applied to all religions, and definitely to Christian fundamentalism. I am using the word fundamentalism in a fairly precise sense. It is severe reductionism of a faith, selecting a very few items (which they call "the fundamentals") from tradition or their scriptures to support a conviction of the categorical evil of those who disagree and the legitimacy of any and all methods of opposition to them. There are many people whose faith is simple or simplistic, who are not fundamentalists because they do not proclaim the utter evil of all others and do not justify evil means in holy causes. The key to fundamentalism is this: "Our opponents are enemies and our enemies are the enemies of God, therefore whatever we do to harm or restrain them is done to the glory of God." The pathetic man, Sean Patrick Flanagan, who was executed in Nevada June 23,1989, for murdering homosexual men, was a bizarre example, but his reasoning was commonplace. He was convinced that he was "doing a service to society" and spent his last hours reading the Bible. You can duplicate the reasoning and comparable behavior in every world religion today: Tamil Hindus in Sri Lanka, Sikhs in the Punjab, Shiites in Iran, the Aryan Nation in Idaho, and the fanatical wing of the Likud party in Israel. It should be clear that fundamentalism is not merely a more intense form of orthodoxy, although some of the orthodox are fundamentalists. But for the most part, orthodox people are steeped in history, whereas the fundamentalist mentality has a revisionist, paranoid, and highly selective use of history. Orthodoxy produces serious biblical (or koranic) scholarship; fundamentalism repeats selected verses with prescribed interpretation over and over. The list of such contrasts could be extended. Granted that in life the differences are often more blurred and shifting than my conceptual distinctions, my intention is to be clear about what I mean by fundamentalism and to emphasize that it is not simply an extreme form of conservatism. I have high regard for religious leaders who perceived the harmful nature of fundamentalism more quickly than I did. For example, Mordecai M. Kaplan, founder of Reconstructionism, wrote in 1955: We have more to fear from the pro-Jewish than from the anti Jewish fanatics, from the political and religious terrorists fighting for Jews and Judaism, than from the bitterest anti-Semites and most intransigent Arabs. ... In the interests of enlightened and ethical</page><page sequence="14">134 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy religion, it is essential that the Rabbinate be separated from the State and be deprived of the power to impose its authority on all dissidents from Orthodoxy.19 Conventional piety has held that religions that are monotheistic and especially "people of the book" (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) are on a higher level in their civilized and spiritual development. Rarely has this presupposition been questioned in the West, but it is highly questionable. A major contribution of these book people has been bibliolatry, laying aside a God of majesty and mystery, and instead worshipping a book. The book becomes a virtual set of Rorschach ink blots which provide authorization for whatever views the worshipper desires. The alarming consequence of this in this century is that multitudes of people who are not fundamentalists have fallen into worship of the Bible or Koran. As with the worship of any idol, complete ignorance of the idol's history and content is not a drawback; it helps. It is necessary only to mention that the fundamentalist syndrome is to be found in secular as readily as religious ideologies. There is political fundamentalism, and nationalistic fundamentalism, anarchistic fundamentalism, racist fundamentalism, ethnic fundamentalism. The crackdown in Tiananmen Square (June 12,1989) demonstrates how easily a secular faith can slide into fundamentalist fanaticism with incredible cruelty, revisionist history, heresy hunting, and paranoia. I turn now to pantheism. Like every other position it has its dangers. It very easily wanders off into a foggy swampland where all distinctions are blurred. It may call this Living in the Light, but it is really a dim twilight in which all small creatures are gray cats. One thinks of Mrs. Moore's experience of the echoes in a Malabar cave in E. M. Forster's Passage to India. The sounds were "entirely devoid of distinction. . . . Pathos, piety, courage--they exist, but are identical, and so is filth. Everything exists, nothing has value." Poor Mrs. Moore was not quite right ever after. In contrast, the kind of pantheism to which I subscribe is Whiteheadean and emphasizes individuation and distinctiveness. Pantheism can slip off the track in the opposite direction of sweetness and light, under the delusion that comprehended in the correct understanding, everything is all right in a kinder and gentler universe. This view, as William James said, "seems too buttoned-up and white chokered and clean-shaven a thing to speak for the vast slow-breathina unconscious Kosmos with its dread abysses and its unknown tides." Naturalistic pantheism does not soften the brutal fact of the moral ambiguity of the universe or the frequent injustices which befall multitudes of human beings without regard to their desert or innocence. Of course, this givenness of 19. From a letter from Mordecai Kaplan to Rabbi Martin M. Weitz, February 4, 1955. 20. William James, Essays in Radical Empiricism, ed. R. B.

But denial of the fact is not an acceptable solution. A particular problem for naturalistic pantheism is that you cannot derive a warrant for the criteria of human good from this concept of God. The Stoics thought we can, but they were mistaken. So the question put to pantheism is: Where is your authority for ethical norms, since it does not come from your God? This lust for an external authority is curious when you think about it. It is worthy of remark that it was the enemies of Jesus who asked, "By what authority?" And it is worthy of recall that he refused to answer the question and also that one of the qualities that offended his critics was that "he spoke as one having authority." Well, who is it that arrives at judgments as to what constitutes human good? It is human beings. Usually they have claimed to have derived their judgments from God, but since they are the ones selecting the criteria from the welter of contradictory sanctions which have been attributed to God, they have in effect fed the lines to God which now mysteriously come back to them. One solution has been to define God as the cluster of factors that support your ethical views, which means that God provides the sanction for human good and therefore is worthy of worship. The mirror effect is unconvincing; the circularity does not, I maintain, actually eventuate in worship, but in debate. What needs to be called into question is the assumption that a satisfactory God must provide authority for the ethical good and detailed commandments for behavior. Although this has been a standard part of the religions of people of the book, it has not been universal in the religions of the world and has most often been honored in the breach with elaborate casuistry to explain why the rules of the Rule Book do not mean what they say. Spinoza rejected the assumption in the seventeenth century, as have a few others. William Bernhardt wrote thirty years ago: God is, and there are no rational grounds for applying moral attributes on human terms, to the divine. "Evil" and "good" are terms we apply to human ways of relating persons to one another and not to the more inclusive reality within which the divine operates. Any extension of these judgmental concepts beyond the human leads to confusion and frustration.21 Later Bernard Loomer and James Gustafson, from quite different perspectives, were to make this same point in more detailed analyses. Those who, like the Stoics, believe that moral values and norms can be adequately derived from nature are wrong. Those who leap to the contrary extreme, 21. William Bernhardt, The Reality Principle in Religion," lliff ReviewXVI:2 (Spring 1959): 40.</page><page sequence="16">136 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy believing that no ethical judgments can find any warrant in nature, are equally wrong. I am willing to argue vigorously that some significant ethical guidance and human applicability can be drawn from the observation of natural phenomena and the given ways of things-in short, from nature. For example, it is in the nature of scientific investigation that integrity with respect to data is required, sine qua nont for any such project to retain validity. Cheat on the data and the value of the experiment has been destroyed. There are many such ways in which nature requires sound judgment, prudence, and respect for methods if severe penalties are to be avoided. On the other hand, there are moral qualities and principles to which nature is indifferent. Chief among these are justice and compassion. Nature and its scenario, history, have shown small regard for supporting processes of justice, either for individuals or societies. "So careful of the type she seems, So careless of the single life." Marvin Shaw's fine paper, The Romantic Love of Evil," utilizing Santayana's critique, presents a convincing case that nature is "a compound of factors favoring and opposing human good."22 However, I would call attention to the fact that Loomer's pantheism is significantly different from early gnostic as well as nineteenth century romantic types of pantheism which Santayana was dealing with, although he clearly identified the God concept as primarily a moral sanction in some of his writing. Also, when it is said that it is not nature's magnitude that makes her admirable, but supportiveness of human life, it must be observed that being "admirable" in terms of human morality is not the primary attribute requisite for deity. We are not limited to Zeus and Wotan as examples; Yahweh and the Deus of Revelation will suffice for deficiency in admirability and supportiveness of human life. Whatever concept you have of God, it is undeniable that the sun shines and the rain falls on (or drought befalls) the just and the unjust with sublime indifference. If the category for God is that which serves human purposes, it is difficult to surpass the type of personal idealism that claims that the chief purpose of the God of the universe is the welfare and salvation of earth's human beings. If that is not very evident to our observation, it is because this God has made it deliberately confusing in order to test people's faith, so they argue. The confusion here-or at least the difference in view-is in Santayana's assumption that worship requires moral agreement, that the God who is worshipped must also determine one's moral judgment. That flies in the face of what most worship has been. Far more characteristically, the God or gods have been that which evoke the sense of majesty, awesome wonder, the splendor of beauty and mystery. It is a loose generalization to say that "devotion to nature would involve the artificial renunciation of human good 22.

Even if nature worshippers were as immoral as devout Contras and Tamils, Crusaders and Inquisitors, they could not derive worship of brute power from nature. Turn to a biologist on this question: Altruism is not restricted to the social insects. . . . Animals have genes for altruism, and those genes have been selected in the evolution of many creatures because of the advantage they confer for the continuing survival of the species.... Altruism is based on kinship; by preserving kin, one preserves one's self. In a sense . .. altruism, in its biological sense, is required of us.24 It is only in part that nature is morally ambiguous. There are respects in which nature is plainly supportive of human life and values-that we are here speaks to that. There are other ways in which nature is destructive of human life and values, as the existence of diseases demonstrates. And then there are other matters in which nature is morally ambiguous. Poison the earth and its waters, as was done for years at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, and as surely as water flows downhill there will be suffering and death in consequence. In principle that is just. But those who have suffered these consequences are not the ones who created the fluids and gasses of death. They almost never are. It is calculated that in World War I about fifty percent of the casualties were noncombatants. The percentage has increased steadily and in wars of the 1980s it is about ninety percent. Many things work out that way in the natural course of things, and that is manifestly unjust. It strikes me as childish and perverse in our religious understanding and response to complain that the Cosmic Mother who has brought us to this point of increased responsibility for our own destiny is unworthy of wonder, love, and praise because she does not meet our every desire and serve also as our Moral Instructor. The books of Job and the Psalms tell us more about authentic spiritual responses than do Proverbs and Aesop's Fables, but Job and the Psalms are not particularly instructive for morality. As for the rhetorical question: "Why not lapse into self-indulgence or exult in destructiveness, since we are to worship the morally ambiguous whole?"25 The answer, of course, is that worship-any people's worship-does not seem uniformly and consistently to culminate in passionate pursuit of peace, daily practice of love, and exercise of impartial justice. Indeed, a most horrendous problem for historic religions has been and is today found precisely in the claim that their God has revealed the true way for human righteousness and provides solicitous favoritism for His privileged ones. Is any need more pressing than that cultures break out of their prideful 23. Ibid. 24.

Is it not all too clear that the task of sorting out and systematizing ethical claims is a human task? Reality apart from us has not and will not produce that. We have something to contribute and it turns out that the text, "you are co-workers with God," has a deeper meaning than formerly realized. We are co-creators with God, admittedly in a small way-but a very precious way. Nature (for that matter, God, however conceived) composes no symphonies or sonnets, creates no cultures or literature, apart from us. The same can be said of governments, economic systems, omelets, mathematics, and games. Is it astonishing, then, that ethical systems-some pretty good, some not so good-are also human contrivances, and so are religions? It has been a cause of great mischief that for a long time governmental and economic systems were viewed as given or sanctioned by God, and the same with many ethical systems. Historically, these systems became more responsible and open to revision and improvement when they ceased to hide privilege maintenance and justification for oppression behind the claim of divine origin or sanction. I do not suggest that removal of the divine fa?ade guarantees improvement; it merely opens the door to that possibility. It does not push us through that door, but at times it has led to genuine improvement. I also do not suggest that our human creations are ex nihilo and apart from God's creativity, for clearly the artist and social craftsperson work with conditions, powers, limitations, and historical momentum which are absolutely necessary for any meaningful creation to take place.26 And in the pantheistic theology, that means given by God. Thoughtful lay people often pose questions about theology in conversation with academics which do not come up in church situations. I have in mind particularly people who have a serious interest, but who find most religious discourse superficial except for academic theology, which they have found elusive and obscure. After making allowances for standard carping aimed at any profession by outsiders, there are three persistent questions which I think merit consideration. One is, "Does this God you are talking about exist? Or, is God real?" A second is, "Why bother with worship? What is the point of that if it is not some disguised form of magic?" The third is, "Can you tell me in plain English and not professional jargon what you mean basically by God? What you think God is?" As Bernard Loomer emphasized, it is not of secondary importance whether one's meaning given to the term "God" designates an abstraction or 26. Dewey was emphatic in stressing human dependence and cooperation with nature and society throughout his writings. Cf.

On this point Anselm was correct, that a God that exists is superior to any God that exists only in somebody's understanding. If God is taken to be the fullness of all reality, including all its richness, regularities, subtleties, massiveness, and minute intricacies, there is no problem in proving the existence of such a God, unless you deny that anything is real. Acceptance in the sense of coming to terms with what is need not be confused with approval, which was the typical error of the Stoics. "Everything harmonizes with me, which is harmonious to thee, O Universe. Nothing for me is too early nor too late, which is in due time for thee."28 Believe me, whatever conception of God you pick, there are many things of which I do not approve. I agree with Job, who said he would fill his mouth with arguments, and even more with Edna St. Vincent Millay's Dirge without Music: "So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind. .. /I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned."29 As for the question, "Why bother with worship?" it is related to the previous issue of the reality of God. The word "God" is a religious term. That is, it has connotations of reverence, honored heritage, an ecclesia or gathering in which the word has depth of feeling and meaning, and it is associated with a sense of the sacred or awesome. The word does not designate such feelings, but a reality which evokes such responses. Some people respond to nature or the universe that way-many do not. And a lot that passes for worship is not remotely related to my description, but is rather more akin to amateurish group therapy. Asking "Why bother with worship of ail reality itself?" is like asking "Why read poetry?" or "Why bother with music or comedy?" These things are characteristic of primitive societies or non literate peoples rather universally. My hunch is that worship with its rituals (socially sanctioned patterns of behavior), mythic poetry, song, and hilarity correspond to basic human and social needs. For me, the word tribal is not pejorative, but insightful in disclosing important aspects of our social nature.30 My most serious criticism of John Dewey's analysis of the religious is his neglect of the tribal character of all religion, the gatherings and ceremonies which mark passages of life and season, which celebrate human strength and capacities in the face of powers before which human existence is fragile and precarious. 27.

I must add that my intention is not to put down efforts to inform, clarify, and urge ethical action, but merely to point out that worship focussed on that purpose has not been very effective and often is counter productive. When you examine the content of the worship services and sermons of Martin Luther King, Jr., or of Gandhi's ashram prayer gatherings, it is clear that they were not focussed on promotion of social action-although they often had that consequence-but, worship services in which human dignity and sanctity were affirmed, and humility and gratitude were acknowledged before a majestic God. Henry Nelson Wieman was emphatic in his insistence that the structure of creativity, which makes possible the actualization of human good, is an objective reality, which we need to recognize and work with.31 While I am indebted to Wieman at many points, my divergence is one of scope, his view being anthropocentric in the sense that the divine is designated according to its contribution to human good and is thus insufficiently ecological. Human well-being is undeniably of major interest to us. Often what we most need is to be strongly reminded that we are not lords of creation. I am convinced that our concern with human good must be placed within the context of an ecological sensitivity. At the same time we must recognize that our efforts toward compassion and justice are not reinforced by natural law or the nature of things, but represent our distinct gift to life on this planet. That is a dimension in which we have a contribution to make to the enrichment of God-if we will. The larger ambiguity of God, which does not provide precise guidance for human ethics, is somewhat like Shiva, God of healing and destruction, or Jung's doctrine of the "dark side of God." The Judaeo Christian tradition is not lacking in examples of this view, but it certainly has not been an orthodox conception. Worship has to do with symbols. As Tillich said, symbols "are not true or false in the sense of cognitive judgments. But they are authentic or inauthentic... adequate or inadequate... divine or demonic_1,32 The real problem is not whether worship should be continued, but whether it can be so enacted and enjoyed, without self-consciousness, as to be authentic, adequate, and meaningful for those who no longer can subscribe to supernaturalism and anthropomorphism. As for the third question, "Can you say in plain English what you mean by God?" the answer is not difficult but does require explication that goes 31.

Pantheistic slogans tend to sound like God is a huge glob. Norman Cousins once put it nicely in saying that we have tried to put our arms around infinity and have been left-not with the universe in our arms-but with a closed and empty circle."33 So, to attempt a brief and I hope clear statement of what naturalistic pantheism means by saying "God is the fullness of all reality whatever" or "nature as a whole," that includes far more than physical bodies like stars and rocks; it means every sort of entity, pattern, bit of meaning, whim, force, quality, experience, event-everything whatever. Even unrealized potentialities and possibilities have some sort of realness which distinguishes them from impossibilities. Although there is an incredible amount which we do not know about the whole of reality, it does seem to be characterized by classes or types of realities. A dream that was actually dreamt is different from one that was fabricated and not dreamt, and both are different from actual occurrences. In short, there are levels of importance from a human standpoint, and to some extent some of these classifications have a basis or warrant in nature. Nature constantly creates values-actual values which sustain and enhance life-and life forms express evaluations, as when an amoeba absorbs a bit of starch but expels a bit of sand, or when a dog prefers one bone over another, as dogs do. But it is in humans that nature gropingly systematizes evaluations, for we humans are part of nature no less than cats and gnats. Nature is so rife with creativity that destruction and death are also functions of hers, inescapably and often tragically. But this is our home, our dwelling place in all generations. Since the earth is the part of the universe where we live, it is where God is most real and understandable to us. The earth is not a person, but it is alive. It is ever birthing. It is beautiful and majestic, a veritable infinity teeming with experience, phenomena, species, perils, disasters, fantastic patternings and relationships discernible by science and re-organized by artists into movement, color, sound, and story. All this. And, of course, the history of the earth is carried within it in various ways. Being a living earth-Gaia-the future impinges upon it in the drive of life forms, genetic programming, and care of offspring. Even so, the earth is a very minute part of our galaxy, and when we speak of nature in the full sense we cannot limit its meaning to earth. For apart from the energy of the sun, our earth would not be the fecund orb which we know as habitat. There was keen wisdom in the many ancient myths which pictured Father Sun as having impregnated Mother Ocean to bring forth life. No doubt we can love the earth in ways that are not possible for us to feel toward the whole universe. But, in terms of awesome majesty, we cannot confine nature as God to the earth. In order to summarize this attempt to explain pantheism in ordinary language terms, I borrow a passage from Whitehead's Modes of Thought: "The doctrine I am maintaining is that neither physical nature nor 33. Norman Cousins, The Celebration of Life (New York: Harper and Row, 1974), p. 79. The lectures were delivered in 1954.</page><page sequence="22">142 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy life can be understood unless we fuse them together as essential factors in the composition of 'really real1 things whose inter-connections and individual characters constitute the universe. V. Further Considerations Whitehead said that the first task of modern philosophy is lo conceive of Importance and Matter-of-fact in some disengagement from the mentalities of the ancient world."35 This certainly applies to naturalistic pantheism. A difficulty occurs when critics slide off the path of direct engagement on to one confronting a medieval or ancient type. An example would be Rudolf Metz's abrupt dismissal of the "Christian Pantheism" of Allanson Picton (1832-1910) because of "the palpable contradiction of combining two such incompatibles."36 That pantheism of any variety is incompatible with strictly Pauline Christianity is surely true, but so would any theology be that accepts Copernican cosmology. However, since Metz equated religion with supernaturalism, he erroneously equated naturalism with materialism, which seriously distorts the views of such pantheists of that period as Picton, Clifford, Romanes, and Seeley. A couple of generations later, Teilhard also called his position "Christian Pantheism"; though very different from Picton's, it met with similar dismissals. A contemporary example comes from Sallie McFague's Models of God. I must first say that there are many things about that book that I admire, and especially her ecological emphasis. Her position, she says, is not pantheistic because it does not "reduce" God to the World. "It does not totally identify God with the world any more than we totally identify ourselves with our bodies."37 My response is that when I speak of the universe (or nature), I do not mean physical body; I mean something more akin to "nature alive," as Whitehead put it. Humans, McFague writes, "may be said to be spirits that possess bodies." I am not at all able to agree with that depiction, for humans are selves in whom body and mind, personal history and psyche are thoroughly interfused. Body and spirit are distinguishable only for purposes of analysis and convenience-in reality, they are engrafted as interacting, dipolar functions. However, I must add that in a poetic or metaphorical sense-and McFague, after all, is intentionally metaphorical-the world as God's body represents a tremendous improvement over the world as a reservoir of resources intended for human exploitation. The living earth, however, can be a moving and timely image, as this statement by Wangari Maathai shows. She was founder of the Kenyan Green Belt Movement and 34.

The statement also shows that the living earth need not imply a cosmic personality or spirit claimed to be transcendent to nature. I am concerned about the wounds and bleeding sores on the naked body of the earth. Have we not seen the long-term effects of these bleeding sores? The famine? The poverty? The chemical and nuclear accidents? The small wars and deaths in so many parts of the world? When we have seen all these calamities, have we done more than ask: Who is responsible?... We are all of us strangling the earth.38 Once again I turn to Whitehead for the summary statement. "... This sharp division between mentality and nature has no ground in our fundamental observation. We find ourselves living within nature. ... I conclude that we should conceive mental operations as among the factors which make up the constitution of nature."39 Among the radical shifts from "the mentalities of the ancient world" which have occurred, none seems to me more remarkable than the realization that patterns are real and constitutive, rather than epiphenomenal. Plato divined that, especially in his account of creation in The Timaeus where triangles are sorted out and crucial for this fair universe to come into being.40 Unfortunately, his forms were static and abstract, and thus irrelevant for a modern cosmology. In our own century, we find eminent thinkers omitting pattern or configurationality in their view of the primordial stuff. Bergson regarded matter and force (?lan vital) as the ultimate metaphysical constituents. Or consider this fairly typical modern statement of faith: The true contemplation of God should proceed not out of manifest phenomena but out of a void. This is the final test of spiritual substance. If our spirituality proceeds out of awe, it loses substance as soon as awe is dissolved. God merges in fullest glory, not when made to sit astride infinity or when regarded as an architect of cosmic spectacles, but when contemplated as the Ultimate Force that prevents the cosmic void from becoming absolute.41 What I want to call attention to is God as "the Ultimate Force" I submit that force is an inadequate and misguided term for what bonds reality into types of order and especially since the discovery of the structure of DNA by Watson 38.

At the same time, many thinkers over the past century and more have intuited that nothing is more basic in the nature of nature than pattern. It is the pattern of the connections in the DNA double helix that transmits the genetic information and instructions to the organism. In the sound which passes from the orchestra via radio to your stereo set, it is not "sound" that is carried through the several transformations en route, but the flow of patterns which persist throughout. Something like meaning or organizing structure is at the base of everything you can think of. Logos is as good a term as any to designate that, understanding logos in the stoic rather than the gnostic sense. I do not believe we can any longer think in terms of matter and force, with patterning as an afterthought. And feeling is as good a term as any to designate the transmission-the participatory impenetration-of energy and qualities. When I did my first Whitehead studies, I thought his terminology contrived and some of his concepts far-fetched. Years later, it was as a result of a brilliant lecture by F. H. C. Crick on The DNA Revolution" that I was enabled to see Whitehead's thought far more incisively. The lecture had nothing to do with Whitehead's philosophy, but in dealing with patterning as communicative-one of nature's languages, if you will?I had a far better grasp of Whitehead's thought. I have a new appreciation of such passages as this: It follows that in every consideration of a single fact there is the suppressed presupposition of the environmental coordination requisite for its existence. This environment, thus coordinated, is the whole universe in its perspective to the fact. But perspective is gradation of relevance; that is to say, it is gradation of importance. Feeling is the agent which reduces the universe to its perspective for fact. Apart from gradation of feeling, the infinitude of detail produces an infinitude of effect in the constitution of each fact.... Thus perspective is the outcome of feeling; and feeling is graded by the sense of interest as to the variety of its differentiations.43 There are implications here for social ethics and policy. I will mention just one. Imagine what a difference it would make if policy makers understood that power does not mean mere accumulation of force, but capability, that is, effectiveness. Accumulation of ever more force in situations where that force is unusable or inept merely multiples frustration. The picture of a person sitting in an automobile which will go one hundred twenty MPH on a freeway whose speed limit is sixty-five MPH, but moving by stop and 42. One of the first popular accounts appeared in Harper's. I was deeply impressed, but the metaphysical implications caught my interest with the publication of Sir Alister Hardy's Gifford Lectures, The Living Stream (NY: Harper and Row, 1965). 43. Modes of Thought, p. 13.</page><page sequence="25">Vol. 13, Nos. 2 and 3, May/September 1991 145 go at five MPH maximum, is the parabolic cartoon of the frustrations of our era. The concept of power as effectiveness in achieving desired results calls for finesse, imagination, skill, the deft touch, and timing, apart from which the multiplication of raw force mocks those who accumulate it. I am still baffled by how it is that an explorer bee can return to the hive and do a dance which communicates to the swarm the direction of a field of flowers and how far away it is. I am not baffled by leaders of nations who think that multiplication of sheer destructive force and increased brutality in troubled places will communicate understanding and encourage cooperative responses-but I am infuriated. I turn now to an admitted problem of pantheism. It so easily becomes vague. It is quite vulnerable to criticism simply because the universe is so vast and virtually unimaginable. A partial response is that it is a matter of record that many people found contemplation of the universe or the All inspiring their worshipful response. William Kingdon Clifford (1845-79) was a pantheist and surely one of the greatest intellects of British philosophy and mathematics, despite his death at age thirty-three. He was extremely opposed to the religious establishment and orthodoxy, yet personally devout. As one of his critics put it, "He found escape in worship of the universe, and stood in reverent awe before its marvelous order and regularity."44 We could add dozens of other examples. Even so, there is a genuine problem in the very vastness and enormity of any talk about "the universe." One should use a word like universe with hesitancy, humility, and, contrary to what I have been doing, infrequency. What, then, is my response to this problem? I will borrow something from traditional Catholicism by way of an answer, namely, its elaborate catalog of saints. As everybody knows, Catholics of understanding do not confuse a saint with God, but regard a particular saint as serving a particular purpose. I was taught in Sunday School to view this idolatrous practice with the utmost disdain. It was a long road of enlightenment to come to the realization that we all have our catalog of saints and shrines, although we may avoid these words. Furthermore-the Bible to the contrary not withstanding-there are worse things than worshipping a saint or symbol of particular virtue or value. We need empowering figures and ennobling symbols and places of special meaning. They are not always wisely chosen, but they can represent particularized embodiments of courage, values, and commitments. It is not necessary that the symbol be perfect or omniscient-although not having detailed information helps in that regard-but that the symbol be meaningful and cherished. I would stress the fact that any pantheism needs symbols which are accessible, particular, vivid, and intimate. This is said gracefully in an East Indian prayer. "Lord, forgive three sins which are due to my human limitations: Thou art everywhere, yet I worship thee in this place; Thou art without form, but I worship thee in these forms; Thou needest nothing, yet I must offer thee praise. 44. Metz, p. 126. 45. This was in the film script of Home and the World. I do not know the original source.</page><page sequence="26">146 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy Actually, my awareness of this means for particularizing the sense of the sacred did not come from contemplating Catholic saints, but from Samuel Alexander's notion of "Deity" as something distinct from NGod.N God, he said, is the creative force; deity is an idealized concept of the next higher level toward which God (nlsus) is striving.46 My reading and revised utilization of this is as follows: In all religions it is commonplace to have special symbols which signify particular meaning, memories, values, events, hopes, commitment, or sanctifying empowerment. These may be individuals or mythic heroes/heroines who are associated with the embodiment of the quality cherished, or they may be shrines, anniversaries, places. Most people, I think, have such symbols. As long as we are aware that these are idols or icons (i.e., of our selection and anointment), we do not worship them literally, but we do feel a special affection and affinity for them. They are not God or the deity, but divinities in my usage. For all the strictures against such a line of thought in Protestantism, in actual practice they have their functional equivalent of saints as well as shrines, including such as Hildegard of Bingen, Luther, Knox, Wesley, Lincoln, Helen Keller, Eleanor Roosevelt, Martin Luther King, Jr. They were, after all, embodiments of nature who lent nobility to the human story and who inspire the ones who beatify their memory. My term is "divinities" by way of admitting that a polytheistic perspective is involved in this, but the label is not important. What is important is to recognize that with human powers and limitations-and no special supernatural endowments-they brought nature to a very special fulfillment. As a footnote, I want to say that the word "God" is not a required term for my religious philosophy. I have known too many people who have been alienated from religions of the establishment, and would not be caught dead using the word "God," but who were devout in their attitudes and lifestyle, to believe that use of the term is essential. For myself, I find it very difficult to express what I think and how I feel without indulging in God-talk. I know that the term God invites misunderstanding and misinterpretation, but then so do words like nature, universe, and religion. The admission of a perspective that is polytheistic need not be disturbing. Trinitarianism has always threatened monotheism. In the New Testament there are many more references to two persons in the godhead, Father and Son, than to a trinity. Whether God is one or three or four or seven or nine depends upon the perspective from which one is considering it. Whitehead recognized this when he said, "It is as true to say that God is one and the World many, as that the World is one and God many."47 It is because pantheism has a monistic cosmology that it must emphasize the multifariousness of existence, the individuating nature of nature, and the incredible fecundity of creative processes. There is nothing intrinsically good in proclaiming that God is one. If that means you must accept my version of 46. Samuel Alexander, Space, Time and Deity (London: Macmillan, 1920), Vol. II, p. 353. The whole of Book IV (pp. 341 ff.) explicates this topic. 47. A. .

But if oneness means integrity, if it means flowing harmony enriched with dissonance, drama intensified with all manner of sub-plots, yet which nevertheless hangs together, it becomes challenging to attempt to conceive God or nature as one. Perhaps the best way to denote the position of naturalistic pantheism is to borrow Sankara's term, non-dualism. Finally, one other idea which has become increasingly important in my thinking is the understanding of particular religions as languages. That is, a religion is a language by which certain things are expressed, meanings communicated, and comprehension facilitated. It is a strange sort of language, because it attempts to deal with matters for which ordinary verbal languages are inadequate. Like ordinary language it is communal, cannot be taken at literal face value, is often indirect and implicative, laden with emotion, and sometimes of surpassing beauty. This mode of understanding religion seems to me to accord well with what we learn from cultural anthropology and philosophically to be close to the religious sensitivities of Santayana, Hocking, and Teilhard, as well as Whitehead, Dewey, and some passages in Tillich's later thought. The primary question, of course, is whether this is a valid way to understand and investigate religion. If it is, there are additional advantages. The so-called problems of pluralism dissolve. It is no more to be wondered at that there are many religions than that there are many language systems. The competitive, proselytizing motive (disguised as "sharing") is eliminated. It makes no more sense to ask which religion is the true one than to ask which of the world's written languages is the true one. As everybody knows, or should know, German is better for some purposes, French for others, Italian for yet others, and probably that can be said of any language, whether written or not. Religion understood as a language also makes it quite possible to be a Christian or Jew or Buddhist or whatever with sincerity, if one so desires, provided that things that are intellectually dishonest or morally evil are rejected with candor. That I happen to use Christian forms and traditions to share and express my faith does not imply my acceptance of all the nonsense and cruelty of Christian history, any more than that I happen to speak English requires approval of things others have said and done through that language. The language people happen to speak is much less important than what they say with that language, and whether it clarifies their thought and inspires their spirits. So it is, I say, with the religion they happen to have: What do they do with it? What does it do to them? My purpose has been to present naturalistic pantheism as a legitimate and defensible religious philosophy, and beyond that to attempt a partial explication of what it means and entails. As for what particular religious language system or mythos that is to be expressed in, I have no interest in promoting any one brand, but a deep interest in the quality of people's devotion and gatherings. Pantheism is a viable option and can be a religious view of eloquence and rich meaning, and I rest my case with these words</page><page sequence="28">148 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy from Boethius: would to pliant strings set forth a song of how almight, Nature turns her guiding reins, telling with what laws her providence keeps safe this boundless universe, binding and tieing each and all with cords that never shall be loosed."48 48.
