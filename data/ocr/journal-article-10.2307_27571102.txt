SCIENTIFIC NOTE Is the banded alder beetle Rosalia funebris Motschulsky (Cole?ptera: Cerambycidae) the model for an ancient Hopi clown? The Pueblo Indians of the southwestern United States comprise several tribes that are well known for the Pueblo architecture of their prehistoric and historic villages and for their religious ceremonies that involve masked dancers known as kachinas. (Some authors prefer katsina and katsinam, pi., as more accurate translations of the spoken Hopi language, which has no ch sound; see Secakuku 1995). Archaeological evidence indicates the kachina religion is an ancient one, dating from at least the early 1300's (Schaafsma 1994). Kachinas are spirit beings who serve as messengers to the gods for the purpose of ensuring ample rain, a bountiful harvest and a life in harmony with the rest of the world. They are anthropomorphic embodiments of objects and beings both animate (plants, animals, historical persons and mythological beings) and inanimate (clouds, thunder, sun and stars). The kachina dances of the Hopi and Zuni tribes are the only ones open to non-Indians and they have been a source of fascination for tourists and ethnologists since the late 1800's. In addition, the Hopi and Zuni carve kachina dolls (called tihu by the Hopi) that are eagerly sought after by museums and numerous collectors. The sale of these dolls is a major source of income, particularly for the Hopi. The Hopi pantheon includes over 300 kachinas. Of interest to entomologists is that several generic insects and at least one arachnid are represented. They include the death fly (blowfly), robber fly, dragonfly, cricket, cicada, bumble bee, wasp, butterfly, moth and scorpion. Surprisingly, no beetle is represented, unless it is the dung carrier, who is a runner kachina that chases a member of the audience and, if he catches him, smears him with dung! However, none of the authoritative treatises on kachinas refers to the dung carrier as a beetle, although I have seen one doll for sale on the Internet (by Hopi carver Ramson Lomatewama) that is referred to as both a dung carrier and a dung beetle (see cited URL 31 August 2007). Here one must realize that a kachina may not be recognizable in whole or in part as the object it represents. For example, the kachina Poli Taka is easily identified as a butterfly by its four wings, proboscis and knobbed antennae. In the cricket kachina, Susopa, the only recognizable insect characteristic is a pair of long thin antennae, while the dragonfly kachina, Sivuftotovi, bears no resemblance to a dragonfly. Presumably, tradition alone identifies the latter. Also participating in the kachina ceremonials of most Pueblo villages are several types of sacred clowns that are not kachinas but who entertain the audience between dances and whose antics are meant to reinforce cultural mores by parodying inappropriate behaviors. Principal among these for the Hopi, and by far the most popular 'kachina' figures with outsiders, are the Koshari (also known as Koyala) or Hano clowns, who are painted from head to foot in broad, contrasting black and white stripes and who have two long, banded antenna-like appendages on the head (Fig. 1). Ross (1993) has noted that the Hano clowns bear an unmistakable resemblance to the banded alder beetle, Rosalia funebris Motschulsky (Cerambycidae) (Fig. 2). The late E. G. Linsley, who collected Koshari dolls carved by the Hopi, remarks that he and several colleagues had independently noted the similarity (Linsley 1995). Ross speculates, Rosalia "must have been drawn to the hypnotic glow of Hopi fires. Did the Indians, watching its antics, add the beetle to their worshipped spirits, calling him Hano the clown?" Ross further asserts that because Arizona alder (Alnus oblongifolia Torrey), the only known Arizona host for R. funebris, shares the same habitat as Arizona cottonwood, which the Hopi use to carve kachina dolls, "the beetle should have been well known to the Hopi." Although the potential RosalialKoshari relationship should be of interest to students of Hopi culture as well as to entomologists, there is apparently nothing in the ethnological literature to that effect. Indeed, Wright (1994), in his definitive work Clowns of the Hopi, makes no mention of a possible beetle model for the Koshari. It is the purpose of this note to amplify upon this intriguing possibility and to correct some errors in Ross' article that could 165</page><page sequence="2">166 THE COLEOPTERISTS BULLETIN 62(1), 2008 Fig. 1. Hano clown kachina doll by Hopi carver Joe Gash of Hotevilla. (Private collection of D. Skiles). Fig. 2. Rosalia funebris Motschulsky, male. easily lead ethnologists and entomologists to dismiss any potential beetle/clown connection and to attribute the resemblance to mere coincidence. Because of its fairly large size and incredibly striking appearance, Rosalia funebris does not fail to impress anyone who encounters it in nature. Though infrequently encountered, Rosalia often appears locally in large numbers on a regular basis. Such aggregations are extremely fascinating to entomologists and laymen alike. Thus, as Ross suggests, it would not be surprising if an animistic and deeply religious people that periodically encountered such a creature were to sanctify it. However, as its conspicuous appearance and collection records indicate, the banded alder beetle is primarily diurnal and would seldom be expected to "be drawn to the hypnotic glow of Hopi fires." The literature on R. funebris supports this, as there is no mention of specimens collected at light. In addition, and also contrary to Ross' assertion, the present Hopi Reservation and, excepting their western and southern margins, even the far more extensive ancestral Hopi lands are largely arid and devoid of Alnus and the appropriate riparian and sylvan Rosalia habitats. The known Arizona localities for R Funebris shown in Linsley (1964, Fig. 2) are well south of the Mogoll?n Rim, which forms the southern boundary of the ancestral lands claimed by the Hopi (James 1974). Of greater importance, particularly to ethnologists, and rendering the previous comments largely academic, is the fact that the Koshari are not a Hopi invention, but were introduced to the Hopi by Tewa Indians who migrated to the Hopi area to escape the chaos and Spanish reconquest of the upper Rio Grande region following the Pueblo Rebellion of 1680. The Hopi Koshari are thus known as Hano clowns (Linsley 1995 refers to them as "hamo" clowns, presumably a misprint) after the present day village of Hano, which was founded by the Tewa around 1700 (James 1974; Wright 1994). Although I have seen no specimens collected in the region, the upper Rio Grande drainage contains ample Rosalia habitat, and the subspecies R f. acomana Casey (now a synonym of R funebris) was collected in Jemez Springs, New Mexico (Casey 1912), not far from the presumed ancestral home of the founders of Hano (Mindeleff 1891). The Koshari are quite ancient, almost certainly predating the first Spanish contact (1540) with Pueblo tribes. Stephen (1936) quotes a Hopi/Tewa reflecting on the modern Koshari antennae consisting of sheep skin stuffed with corn husks that are visible as apical white or yellow tassels (see Fig. 1.), "Long ago, before we had sheep (which were brought to the Americas by the Spanish), when we lived in the Northeast at Tewa yonder, we used no skins of any kind as a headdress. We set a stick on each side of the head upright, and round them we lashed our long hair (presumably jet black) with cotton string (presumably white) wound round and round it." (Italics are my comments.)</page><page sequence="3">THE COLEOPTERISTS BULLETIN 62(1), 2008 167 A final item of interest, because it is consistent with the summer emergence of Rosalia, is that the Koshari are one-half of a clown pair known as the Kossa, comprising the Kwirena, who have a single, stout top knot of hair, a color pattern that bears no resemblance to Rosalia, and who are associated with cold or winter, and the Koshari who are summer clowns (Wright 1994). Although it appears safe to assume that Koshari were present centuries ago among Pueblo tribes in the northern Rio Grande region, neither the time of origin of, the inspiration for, or even the tribe that created the Koshari is known (Wright 1994). Given that significant circumstantial evidence clearly supports the Ross/Linsley hypothesis of a Rosalia model for the Koshari, and in the absence of any ethnological evidence to the contrary, the hypothesis must be considered reasonable and not simply the result of coincidence. It will be interesting to see if ethnologists can uncover compelling evidence for or against a Rosalia/Koshavi connection. Literature Cited Anonymous. 2007.
