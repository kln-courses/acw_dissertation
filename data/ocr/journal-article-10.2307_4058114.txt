<plain_text><page sequence="1">eleven europeans in america During the late war America has had the privilege of playing host to many leading artists of our time. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 England enjoyed a similar privilege. Few records, however, have survived of the activities and interests of the great French impression- ists such as Monet, Pissarro and Sisley who spent the critical period of that struggle in London. To avoid a similar loss in our period the following brief compilation of records and informal interviews was undertaken. Space limitations unfortunately have prevented the inclusion of several European artists who spent the war years here. But in most cases the artists omitted have already become citizens, plan to, or are painters whose recent work forthcoming reprints of Museum of Modern Art catalogs will bring up to date. I would like to take this opportunity to thank again those artists whose patience "under interview" and in supplying and correcting data has made this first-hand record possible.

"My idea of America, like that of so many French, was, and perhaps still is, rooted in Chateaubriand. Nature: the might of nature-the savagery of nature-the feeling that nature may one day re- cover its strength and turn all back to chaos. "The squirrels in Central Park are for me a sym- bol. Here, they are tame, unlike those in Europe. In spite of that they remain a symbol of wild nature- a tiny reserve of it. And it always seems to me that one day they may overrun New York. Again in Central Park I was struck by the bison kept there as a sort of totemic beast. There is a rich American mythology awaiting exploitation. "Here I keep imagining a virgin forest about me. This has had its psychological influence on my paint- ing in America. There has been no influence of the cities. What characterizes my American work is rather its manner of expressing this feeling for nature. Such pictures as Printemps Indien, Paysage Iroquois, Le Grande Melle, Les Gens de Mais, Medi- tation sur une Feuille de Chene, embody a corre- spondence-express something which could never have been painted in Europe. Nocturnal aspects, aspects of revery; savage aspects-Emblematic Landscapes of my life in the countryside of the United States. None of them ever could have been painted in the lie de France-the wickedness, the violence of nature-the hurricane, the tempest, the fury of the storms. andr# mnasson .... _ i: _ "All this is evidently a romantic's position. Of course I exaggerate the ferocity of the climate. But this feature attracted me. I felt I could most effectively cultivate it in my new environment. "Naturally I had already enjoyed the romantic outlook in France before I came here. But this aspect of the United States made a deep impres- sion on me. I would be an idiot to speak of the city. Naturally a city like New York could be stimu- lating. For me it was a constant surprise. But I have never really been long enough in the city. I was stupefied by the traffic. I always told my friends that if they wanted to talk with me they had to come to the country. Consequently I know nothing of city life in your land. Perhaps I am tempera- mentally better fitted to understand the life of the pioneers, their struggle with the elements. In fact I think I understand the life of the past and the problems of the past in the new world better than the city life of the present. "Just a few weeks ago I saw a rodeo for the first time-it affected me like the drawings of Gericault: in which I feel the relationships between man and beast stripped bare. Symbolically, I saw the man as America, and the steer as Nature. This again is an echo of the America of the past. But in addition to this an American rodeo seems to me the best form of 'music hall.' My last work in the United States was an etching called Rodeo. 3</page><page sequence="3">MASSON: Bison au Bord d'un Gouffre. 1944. Ink. "It was a shame I did not see a rodeo during my first year here. But I became cloistered as it were in New Preston. I had always wanted to go to Arizona to the ranch country. "Yes, I was associated with surrealism. With me surrealism has been a cyclic affair. I was one of the first group of surrealists. Then in a manner of speak- ing I became separated from them. "But I am actually more a surrealist in my illus- trations than in my painting. Perhaps it is really that my romanticism appears surrealist. "Fundamentally I am more a sympathiser with surrealism, than a surrealist or a non-surrealist. In the beginning I tried to satisfy myself with the auto- matist app,roach. It was I who became the severest critic of automatism. I still cannot agree with the un- conscious approach. I do not believe you can arrive by this means at the intensity essential for a picture. I recognize that there are intense expressions to be obtained through the subconscious, but not without selection. And in that I am not orthodox. "Only so much as can be reabsorbed esthetically from that which the automatic approach provides should be utilized. For art has an authentic value of its own which is not replaced by psychiatric interest. "It is perhaps more difficult for a Frenchman to be an orthodox surrealist than for artists of other races. I like Chardin too much ever to be a surrealist. In Chardin we find no association with things out- side the representation itself, or at any rate, a minimum of them. Plastic rigour cannot be replaced by even the richest literary imagination. A painting or sculpture does not have a survival value if it lacks this plastic rigour. The literary imagination in such work is never anything but a pretext or excuse for it and must be absorbed into the plastic form. If it is not, the literary imaginative element soon becomes dated. "As a consequence I am solitary: I am too sur- realist for those who do not like surrealism, and not surrealist enough for those who do. I accept the ambiguous situation much as Delacroix did-I do not compare myself with Delacroix, but I believe I understand Delacroix. If he had not the strength of plastic rigour Delacroix would have been a Redon. "The surrealist movement is essentially a literary movement. Its leaders are exacting in literary mat- ters. The surrealist theoreticians are writers; there are no painters among them such as those theoreti- cians of Impressionism as Seurat and Cezanne. In literature the surrealists are as insistent on the exact word as Boileau; but when it comes to painting they are very liberal in matters of structure. The spiritual directors of surrealist painting are not of the profession. They are writers, very brilliant poets who thoroughly recognize the demands of their own profession, but in the case of the plastic arts are not consistently as strict in their require- ments. What makes such a complaisance possible is an elasticity of judgment which can lead to de- plorable aberrations. "In 1938 in Painting is a Wager which was origi- nally published in Sur I already explained my 4</page><page sequence="4">position in relation to surrealism; and again in 1944 in Horizon in 'A Crisis of the Imaginary.' These represented an examination of conscience. Per- haps it would now be well to say that during the last few years I have gone even further and turned to the human face-the portrait-with the aim of approaching portraiture with the greatest possible freedom. And as I undertake it I see this as quite a new departure. "Now on the eve of my departure-and one never sees so clearly as on the eve of a depar- ture-my work in the United States seems to form a definite cell with walls: studies after nature accept- ing any object whatever without any a priori in- tentions, without an attempt at analysis, without any esthetic preconceptions-in short an applica- tion of the automatic approach to whatever object comes up. I showed these drawings to Sartre. He is interested because he is a phenomenalist. Francis Ponge did the same thing in literature in works like La Lessiveuse and La Pomme de Terre. Fernand Leger had tried to do this. In contrast to Leger's approach I feel that to be pure one must respond freely to sensations; and discipline them later. "This is actually counter to the practice of or- thodox surrealism. It constitutes a new esthetic. Georges Bataille was one of the originators of the point of view, primarily on an erotic ground, in his writings in the Paris reviews Documents and Mes- sages during the late 'twenties. It was his group which first recognized Kierkegaard offers no pre- occupation with the senses. "But in contrast to this point of view which I see illustrated in my American work, and which I feel relates it to the outlook first championed by Bataille and his colleagues, the backbone of the surrealist attitude is 'Beware of the visual sensation.' For the surrealists appearance is an illusion-one can with as much justification depict the opposite of what we seem to see. "Matisse sees a lemon as if one had never seen a lemon before. Still if an idea associated with this lemon comes to Matisse while he is painting, he will reject the idea. These men, Bataille and his friends, on the other hand would accept such an idea. Nevertheless in this approach, in painting or sculpture just as in every other approach, plastic rigour must be respected. Marie de Medici, for Rubens, was not just a news item. "One could found a new school on this point of view. If there is a novelty in France today this is it. Such a new school would not turn its back on fauvism, cubism or surrealism. It would not favor the one, or the other exclusively. After all, the real danger to art lies in evasion and shuffling excuses. In the end the only important thing is to make an interesting painting." 4 _ EN P MASSON: Portrait of Claude Duthuit. 1944. Tempera. 5</page><page sequence="5">BIBLIOGRAPHY: The Bed of Plato.

"For me this country was not a place of refuge, but rather a place of election. I did not come here as a refugee; I had decided to come here and stay here before the war began. I arrived in this country June 13, 1938; went back the following winter to Europe for three months to put my affairs there in order; returned here toward the end of February, 1939; and have remained here ever since. "From the end of 1935 until the spring of 1938 I had been living in England. That spring I was in- vited to give a summer course at the University of Washington in Seattle. Tickets to the United States with a return to England by way of the Panama Canal, were provided; so I came-as a visitor. "On landing from the 'Normandie,' Marthe and I sent our luggage on to the hotel and set out afoot. It is a practice we always observe, to land con- cretely on concretefrom a ship, rather than ab- stractly on the rubber of a taxi tire. We walked directly from the French Line Pier to Rockefeller Center. The sight of it gave us the same sort of amedee ozenfunt shock we got from the Pyramids. In 1931 and 1935 we had visited Egypt, Syria, Turkey and Greece. My dream had always been to live awhile in Egypt at Shepherd's Hotel. But now the eternal present be- came symbolized for me by Rockefeller Center. The 'American Acropolis' immediately took its place among my greatest emotional experiences in archi- tecture. "That was my discovery of America. We spent a week in New York; then took a plane to Chicago and the following morning another to Seattle. ... "But we had seen enough to whet our taste. And at the end of my term at the University of Wash- ington instead of returning to Europe by the Panama Canal we cancelled our reservations and set out by Greyhound Bus. First down the Pacific coast: Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles; then across to the Grand Canyon. During our stay in the Grand Canyon we saw a headline of a Los Angeles newspaper dropped from a plane 'War Looms in Europe.' We continued our journey-still by bus- through the Painted Desert, Santa Fe, Denver, Chicago again. When we reached Washington the French Ambassador was in Europe. M. Dumaine, the First Secretary, said: 'M. Ozenfant, it will be war in a day or two, for we are allied with Czecho- Slovakia.' We hurried to New York to board a boat. But instead of war it was Munich. We heard the news by radio in Stuart Davis' studio. "Already won by what we had seen of America 7</page><page sequence="7">and disgusted by Munich and what had led up to it we decided to remain in America and begin a new life. My wife stayed in New York; I went back to London and Paris to close the doors of my past. Then, February second, 1939, I reentered as an immigrant. Thanks to my 'bus tours of the preceding autumn I knew the country before I decided to be- come a citizen. I felt I had a good reason for my decision. And June 13, 1944, 1 received my citizen- ship papers. "The spring following my trip to Europe I was invited to teach another term at the University of Washington. And on my return to New York by bus again, I began to plan the remodelling of an old building near Gramercy Park in which the Ozenfant School opened that autumn-the autumn of the outbreak of the war. The School is now full of splendid Veterans. "And the American environment has been a great help to me in the development of certain ideas during the last few years. Particularly those on forms. As long ago as the beginning of the Purist movement I had felt that certain forms are 'better' and more 'permanent' than others. I had already stated the idea in Apras le Cubisme (1918). In that book I had noted the appeal of formal forces, forces of life-such as waterfalls, clouds, water- spouts, rockets, graphs of the paths of stars, temper- ature curves, etc.-in other words 'forms of forces in action.' "And while my new theories of forms were not basically new, the new environment brought about a reawakening and definite formulation of them Above-OZENFANT: Maternity. 1941. Oil. Upper left-OZENFANT: Maternity. 1945. Painted drawing. 8</page><page sequence="8">4 ~- OZENFANT: Black Mountain. 1945. oil. which I embodied in an article in The Technology Review (Vol. XLV, No. 1, November 1942) under the title Toward a Modern Aesthetic. Fundamentally these theories were the same as those which under- lay my Purist point of view but the change of scene seemed to give them a new life and opportunities to develop. These forms fulfilling the 'preforms' of my conception are 'abstractions' in a sense, but more specifically they are forms taken out of nature in its functioning. "Purism originally was a reaction against the impressionist approach in cubism-little spots which are good in a necktie fabric, but not in painting. You will find the whole story in an article in l'Elan (1916) reprinted in Art (1928). This article entitled Apres le Cubisme was the first published on Purism. "Today, in my work, I see a sort of Purist renais- sance. Between the years 1925 and 1929 1 thought that Purism was over or had to find a new evolution. I thought at that time it would help me to return to the study of nature. I painted my large composition Biological Life (Musee d'art moderne, Paris) and sought in it a fresh contact with external existence. It took me from 1931 to 1938 to work out my prob- lem. This excursion provided me a training and materials. Now thanks to this training I feel I am once more in a position to summarize forms. Purism was essentially a summary. But I do not like to re- write the same play I wrote so long ago. You can- not make new syntheses until you have once more fed visually natural forms and assimilated, digested them. I realize this and I have been patient." LECTURES: 1938-39-University of Washington, Seattle.

Nierendorf had seen me in Paris and had arranged the details of the exhi- bition there. "The year before, on my way back from Alaska I had spent a few days in New York. I had returned by way of Los Angeles and had stopped briefly in Colorado struck by the scenic interest of that region-the peculiarly individual character of its deep-cut ravines and its colors which have almost remained for me the symbolic type of American landscape. "From my Alaskan trip I had brought back a 60 foot totem pole which I deposited at the Musee de l'homme in Paris as well as a beautiful collection of Northwest American primitive art. I have not fol- lowed up my interest with the acquisition of Ameri- can Indian art during my stay here as several of my European colleagues have because I have always felt that I still have my own collection which was kept safe for me at the Musee de l'homme in Paris. "This was not my first visit to New York. My wife and I crossed the United States in 1935 on our way to Tokio, where an exhibition of my work was being held. We were in New York on that occasion for two days. It was so cold we did not leave the hotel. 1939-September, arrived New York. 1942-Fall, typography selection and montage of illustrations for First Papers of Surrealism. 1943-Summer, Mexico City. 1946-February, jury, Fiftieth Annual Exhibition of Artists of Chicago (graphic work).

We met no one. I only called Julien Levy by tele- phone. "The trip the year before the war broke out now seems like a training trip to accustom us with getting away from Europe. As a result our final departure was not the terrific rupture it otherwise might have been. "As for influences which life here may have exerted on my work, it is hard to say. Perhaps the light has had an effect. Perhaps in my work there have been certain changes of proportions since my arrival here; perhaps a tendency to use elon- gated shapes in my anthropomorphic forms. Per- haps the color has become brighter. Perhaps, a greater emphasis on drawing. But one thing is cer- tain, I have always been able to work well here. We Europeans all began our stay here with com- plaints against the severity of the climate and the hectic life in Manhattan. But eventually we all found the climate good for us, especially from the point of view of work. "One of the difficulties in pointing to any influ- ences that may have marked my work is the fact that in it ever since I have been here I have been developing approaches I had initiated before. Sabbath Phantoms which you have in the Museum Collection was the last painting I executed in France, and I feel the painting is connected with po- 10</page><page sequence="10">litical and intellectual reaction. My 'cyclonic forms' -I do not know how else to describe them-which appear in several American paintings, were em- ployed only a short time. And those 'heraldic' an- thropomorphic figures have now once more taken the center of my work, replacing those ventures in landscapes which I worked at briefly just before my Mexican exhibition. And with them has come a re- turn to the unarranged character which marked the anthropomorphic figures I painted in Paris just be- fore my departure. "One change however in my graphic work was the product of necessity. In Paris I could always count on finding a dependable printer and never took the trouble to print my own plates. When I realized that in this country I did not know my way about sufficiently well to find a reliable printer I wrote my printer in Paris. He very generously sent me all his 'secrets.' Then I began to do everything myself-which was very good for my work- naturally. "My interest in 'Black Magic' is, of course, quite apart from all this. I associate the development of my library with my stay in New York, for most of my books on the subject were bought since I came. My love for old books may be an attempt to counterbalance the effects of modern American life-its extravert emphasis. "Though my interest in magic can hardly be brought into immediate relationship with my work as a painter, there is something about magic which fascinates me. It is not in vain that we speak of magical arts. Magic philosophy teaches that the universe is one, that every phenomenon in the world of matter and of ideas obeys the one law which co-ordinates the All. Such doctrine sounds like a program for the painter: is it not his task to shape into a perfect unity within his canvas the variety of depicted forms? The presuppositions of high magic: All is contained in All', and 'All is One' are the basis of my forthcoming book. "From my European background I inherited a curiosity about every form of the past. In many paintings of the old masters nature functions merely as the background to man, and for centuries was conceived by the artist as awesome or diabolical. The past has given a physiognomy to the European landscape, where civilizations lie buried under every acre. I was soon aware that the American landscape has opposite features. In America nature does not bear man's imprint. You may travel many miles through unsettled land, unchanged by the SELIGMANN: Memnon and the Butter- flies. 1943. Oil.</page><page sequence="11">SELIGMANN: Noctambulation. 1944. Mixed technique on masonite. young civilization. This nature is virginal or indif- ferent, untouched by the ghosts of past cultures. "For the European this is a novelty and an attrac- tion, which in my case found its expression in a series of geological or 'cyclonic' scenes. I have abandoned this, not because my interest is slacken- ing, but for the prevailing interest of my work, which is man. "The unconquerable American space has scat- tered the group of Europeans who were accustomed to meet regularly in Parisian cafes. Many were forced or preferred to live in the country. The ex- change of ideas grew rare. Some writers refused to acclimatize themselves. They were bound to their language. Unable to maintain the European climate, unwilling to write in terms foreign to them. But the artists, speaking the language of forms, did not encounter this difficulty. "For me a very valuable experience in this country has been my terms of teaching at Briar- cliff Junior College. Through it I not only acquired familiarity with the language, but through a struggle to make myself clear in a foreign tongue I clarified my own ideas on painting in a way I might never have succeeded in doing alone in my studio. Moreover my teaching activity brought me into contact with 'the people.' And another gratifi- cation that my need to teach brought me was several private pupils, most promising young Ameri- cans. Not that I flatter myself in any way as being responsible for their success: every artist is alone responsible for himself. But in my association with them I have enjoyed the stimulus of discussion and an atmosphere of sensitive effort which is a full reward in itself aside from all the personal promise it affords."

We have been fortunate to be able to continue working. During the first World War I served three years in the artillery. Perhaps my experiences at the front and the daily contact with machines led to the change which marked my painting between 1914 and 1918. But probably it would have happened in any case. At that time we younger men were in violent reaction from impressionism. And a return to local tones, fernand leger f 004.X broader areas of unbroken color and larger forms, was the character this revolt took in my painting. "During the recent war there has not been such an impulse to rebel against what had gone before. But during these years in America I do feel I have worked with a greater intensity and achieved more expression than in my previous work. In this country there is a definitely romantic atmosphere in the good sense of the word-an increased sense of movement and violence. This is a melodramatic country, for all its clear skies. Many American painters paint it illustratively from a subject-matter viewpoint-your 'American Scene' painters. In my opinion subject-matter treatment is more suited to cinema than to painting. I prefer to see America through its contrasts-its vitality, its litter and its waste. Perhaps this is because I am most responsive to externals. Perhaps it is my old interest in 'the object.' But in any case the American period of my painting has certainly been different from the French. "It was the summer following my arrival in this country from Lisbon that my attention was first caught by those contrasts which have become for me so characteristically American. I had been in- vited to teach for a month of the summer of 1941 at Mills College, California, with Darius Milhaud and Andre Maurois. I had decided to go by bus all the way across the continent. The fare was in- 13</page><page sequence="13">LEGER: Jaune et Violet. 1943. Oil. credibly cheap-$36. We slept in berths in the bus that were remarkably clean. It was a way to see the country intimately. I had already covered the ground between New York and Chicago on my earlier visit. From there on was fresh territory and a strange world. Across Texas in an appalling heat- an odor of petroleum that stayed with me for months-scanty vegetation-a landscape almost African in appearance-all very strange to me. And it was there I began to notice those branches of dead trees left lying where they fell, unheeded. Later near Lake Champlain where I spent the sum- mers of 1943, '44, and '45, 1 was even more struck by the broken down farm-machines I would come across abandoned in the fields. For me it became a typical feature of the American landscape, this carelessness and waste and blind and ruthless dis- regard of anything worn or aged. "In this country you are always after something new. In France we use things to their very end. We repair things to their last stage. Here you throw aside as soon as a newer model appears. There is something in the psychology and economy of your country which demands replacements rather than repairs. France is parsimonious, careful. In America the machine makes it possible to produce new things cheap. Possibly this is the explanation of the disappearance of handmade articles in your country. The machine has produced a taste for new things; a taste for new things has made the machine indispensable. The hand is very much at a discount. "But this taste for novelty which is so characteristic of this country is even penetrating my corner of Normandy. Jeanne, my wife, has just written me that electricity has been installed on our farm near Lisieux. In that part of the world such a develop- ment is a major change. It is a victory of youth in youth's struggle against the old and entrenched conservatives. "What has come out most notably, however, in the work I have done in America is in my opinion a new energy-an increased movement within the composition-in paintings where the modelling was emphasized such as the Plongeurs series, as well as in the flatter organizations such as the 1942 Divers, Acrobats, and Dancers. "The Three Musicians is perhaps something apart. It was based on a drawing of 1925 which I had always hoped to expand into an oil, but only found the opportunity after my arrival here. But even in this canvas, for all its static character, there is strength which is new. It would have been less tense and colder had it been done in France. And as a matter of fact I cannot imagine that my series of 1942 of moving figures would ever have been possible there. "Yet I see nothing out of the way in this. I think it entirely normal to take certain influences from one's environment. It would be much more strange to escape absorbing something. Even in Matisse's work done in North Africa, although it preserves every characteristic of Matisse, there is a definite sense of North Africa. Even Mondrian's latest work 14</page><page sequence="14">in this country, his Boogie Woogie compositions, showed the effect of this atmosphere of move- ment-a definite turn from his static organizations of a few years earlier. No, this is clearly a powerful country-one feels it at once; one can resist it, but it is very strong. "For me the contrast in the United States between the mechanical and the natural is one of great anti-melodic intensity. But bad taste is also one of the valuable raw materials for the country. Bad taste, strong colors-it is all here for the painter to organize and get the full use of its power. Girls in sweaters with brilliant colored skin; girls in shorts dressed more like acrobats in a circus than one would ever come across on a Paris street. If I had only seen girls dressed in 'good taste' here I would never have painted my Cyclist series, of which La Grande Julie in the Museum was the culmination. "I always hate to see 'good taste' come to the people. For painters like me who are robust it is very dangerous to frequent the beau monde, bal- lets and the like. French 'taste' is a pitfall for the creative artist. I did not frequent popular dance halls and the people's quarter out of snobbism. I used to go there because I had a real liking for the fellows and the girls of the district. In Paris the 'Casino de Paris' represents 'taste'; the same sort of taste has taken the vitality out of the musical shows in New York. Even burlesque shows are in- fected by 'good taste.' Still there is no need yet to worry. One only has to study the hand-painted ties on Broadway-a locomotive and four pigeons on a violet and black ground, or a buxom nude on a saffron ground-to realize there is still a vigorous survival. The fifteen-cent burlesque shows of Chicago still offer materials. It is only for the artist to select among them. Fourteenth Street may be ruined by the taste of Fifth Avenue; but Avenue B is still rich. And in spite of the fact that people run to good taste as soon as they discover they have bad taste, there will always be another Fourteenth Street, or Avenue B while America keeps young."

But that is never the conscious starting point of my painting. Whenever I set out to do something new I always go back to some- thing old-something I did years earlier. Evolution in art does not go straight; it goes in circles. I have seen this in my own work. And since it is inevitable, I feel that when one recognizes it he should take advantage of it. So at different stages of my de- velopment I have consciously gone back to earlier themes and technical means-even to earlier forms. I think the best springboard is something you have already worked out. A good jump requires a running start and one must go back to take it. At any rate I find I have to.

This was my idea of the art and artists I was going to find here. Instead I was very pleased to meet living people as intense and enthusiastic in their explorations as I found several of the younger artists with whom I have come in touch. "My first painting in America was Napoleon in the Wilderness which you have in the Museum (Mu- seum checklist #205). The decalcomania base was begun in France; but I finished the painting in Santa Monica, California, shortly after my arrival in 1941. Originally the top of the picture as it stands today was the bottom of the composition. One day I happened to see it upside down and decided to finish it that way. I had just come from Europe and dictators. The final painting is possibly an uncon- scious expression of my feelings at the time; for its central figure is not a triumphant Napoleon, but a Napoleon in the wilderness on St. Helena in exile and defeat. "About a month after doing this painting I hap- pened to be in Washington and I came upon the Piero di Cosimo Allegory in the Kress Collection at the National Gallery. I was amazed by the re- semblance between the iconographic features -of this picture I had never seen before and those I had employed in my painting-for instance the strange * p. 103 16</page><page sequence="16">horse dancing, guarded by a female figure with wings, the string and the sea monster in front. "After my arrival in this country I remained two or three weeks in New York and then began travel- ing about the country: Chicago, New Orleans, Arizona, New Mexico to the Pacific Coast. New Orleans I found interesting; but like a cemetery- In fact the admirers of New Orleans who insist on showing the beauties of the place show you first one cemetery, then another; then some old southern houses; then some swamps. I liked Arizona much better. In 1943 I returned and spent five months there. And now I have every intention of staying there for a long while. I need a little opportunity for concentration; after New York I need a rest. "During my first months in New York there were many Paris painters here. At first the surrealist groups seemed to have a real strength; but little by little they began to break up. It was hard to see one another in New York. The cafe life was lacking. In Paris at six-o'clock any evening you knew on what cafe terrace you could find Giacometti or Eluard. Here you would have to 'phone and make an appointment in advance. And the pleasure of a meeting had worn off before it took place. "As a result in New York we had artists, but no art. Art is not produced by one artist, but by sever- al. It is to a great degree a product of their ex- change of ideas one with another. Here in New York one artist lived in the Village, another uptown. This is one of the reasons there is less art produced in this country than in France. It holds for the country at large as well as for New York. There is more loneliness-more isolation among artists than in France. This is certainly one reason for the smaller production of interesting work. "However this situation cannot be changed. The Paris painters when they arrived here first tried to do so. But it is not enough for one person to decide 'This is an artists' cafe.' Such a communal life as that of the Paris cafes is difficult-if not impossible here. "Another reason that so little grew out of the generous transplantation of European artists conse- quent upon the occupation of Paris was the lan- guage problem. Andre Breton does not speak English. He persists in thinking everything not French ERNST: The Marriage of Light and Darkness. 1942. Oil. 17</page><page sequence="17">ERNST: Figure. 1944. Sculpture in plaster. is imbecile. Possibly his reluctance to attempt to speak English for fear of some embarassing error is related to some childhood experience. In any case he is actually frightened-'scared' at the thought of having to learn English. And Breton was the leader to whom most of the younger artists looked in the hope of an American surrealist de- velopment. But because he found it so difficult to get in touch with people here, Breton was fre- quently in a bad mood-not in a mood to work or write. It is impossible for an artist to work in a vacuum. Breton wrote some good poems here. But for Breton it was necessary to have a center. And in New York he found it impossible to maintain one. "As for me, I can as I say, always work here. Sometimes even a physical disadvantage has virtues. In the summer of 1944 I found myself work- ing steadily at sculpture. We had rented a place at Easthampton, L. I., and went there with the intention of spending the summer swimming. But there were so many mosquitos there we could not stick our noses out-of-doors. So I decided to take over the garage, screen it in and make a studio of it. I worked the whole summer there on sculpture. At present during the preparations for my departure to Arizona I have been doing illustrations for Kafka's Metamorphosis; and for Henri Parizot's projected edition of Carroll's Hunting of the Snark and other poems. "Tanguy also works very happily here. Du- champ is another Parisian perfectly contented. Nothing seems to ruffle him. He may go back to Paris, but he always returns here. "In fact among the European painters who have spent the last few years in this country you have had some of those I consider among the greatest of our time-Mondrian, Tanguy, Matta,. to name a few. "And Piet Mondrian's death was a tragic loss to our period. He was a great and honest artist. One has only to recall that the first one man show he ever held anywhere was at the Valentine Gallery in New York in 1942 when he was seventy years old and had been painting more than half a cen- tury. Yet with this remarkable artistic integrity, he was a very human companion. He had a dry humor. He was a little sarcastic, never in a nasty way but in a very sincere way. I met him once at an exhibit of Yves Tanguy's work at the Pierre Matisse Gallery. Mondrian looked at all the paintings and then was asked what he thought of them. 'Oh, I like them very much' he said 'they are beautiful, pure. The only trouble is they are too pure. I like a little dirt such as in my work.' Yet such a statement from Mondrian was fundamentally both serious and sin- cere. For Mondrian felt that his art, abstract as it may have appeared to others, was a concrete reality and encompassed all life-in such a way that Tanguy's actually seemed too pure to him."

"The great trouble with art in this country at pres- ent, and apparently in France also, is that there is no spirit of revolt-no new ideas appearing among the younger artists. They are following along the paths beaten out by their predecessors, trying to do better what their predecessors have already done. In art there is no such thing as perfection. And a creative lull occurs always when artists of a period are satisfied to pick up a predecessor's work where he dropped it and attempt to continue what he was doing. When on the other hand you pick up some- thing from an earlier period and adapt it to your own work an approach can be creative. The result is not new; but it is new insomuch as it is a different approach.. "Art is produced by a succession of individuals expressing themselves; it is not a question of prog- ress. Progress is merely an enormous pretension on our part. There was no progress for example in Corot over Phidias. And 'abstract or naturalistic' is merely a fashionable form of talking-today. It is no problem: an abstract painting may not look at all 'abstract' in 50 years. "During the other war life among the artists in New York was quite different-much more con- genial than it has been during these last few years. Among the artists there was much more cohesion- much closer fellowship, much less opportunism. The whole spirit was much different. There was quite a bit of activity, but it was limited to a relatively mareel duehamp _S g B * small group and nothing was done very publicly. Publicity always takes something away. And the great advantage in that earlier period was that the art of the time was laboratory work; now it is diluted for public consumption. "The basis of my own work during the years just before coming to America in 1915 was a desire to break up forms-to 'decompose' them much along the lines the cubists had done. But I wanted to go further-much further-in fact in quite another direction altogether. This was what resulted in Nude Descending a Staircase, and eventually led to my large glass, La Mariee mise a nu par ses celibataires, meme. "The idea of the Nude came from a drawing which I had made in 1911 to illustrate Jules La- forgue's poem Encore a' cet astre. I had planned a series of illustrations of Laforgue's poems but I only completed three of them. Rimbaud and Lautrea- mont seemed too old to me at the time. I wanted something younger. Mallarme and Laforgue were closer to my taste-Laforgue's Hamlet, particu- larly. But perhaps I was less attracted by Laforgue's poetry than by his titles. Comice agricole, when written by Laforgue, becomes poetry. 'Le soir, le piano'-no one else could have written this in his time. "In the drawing Encore a cet astre the figure is, of course, mounting the stairs. But while working on it, the idea of the Nude, or the title-I do not recall 19</page><page sequence="19">which-first came to my mind. I eventually gave the sketch to F. C. Torrey of San Francisco who bought the Nude Descending a Staircase from the 1913 New York Armory Show. "No, I do not feel there was any connection be- tween the Nude Descending a Staircase and futur- ism. The futurists held their exhibition at the Galerie Bernheim Jeune in January 1912. I was painting the Nude at the same time. The oil sketch for it, however, had already been done in 1911. It is true I knew Severini. But I was working quite by myself at the time-or rather with my brothers. And I was not a cafe frequenter. Chrono-photography was at the time in vogue. Studies of horses in movement and of fencers in different positions as in Muy- bridge's albums were well known to me. But my interest in painting the Nude was closer to the cubists' interest in decomposing forms than to the futurists' interest in suggesting movement, or even to Delaunay's Simultaneist suggestions of it. My aim was a static representation of movement-a static composition of indications of various positions taken by a form in movement-with no attempt to give cinema effects through painting. "The reduction of a head in movement to a bare line seemed to me defensible. A form passing through space would traverse a line; and as the form moved the line it traversed would be replaced by another line-and another and another. There- fore I felt justified in reducing a figure in movement to a line rather than to a skeleton. Reduce, reduce, reduce was my thought;-but at the same time my aim was turning inward, rather than toward ex- ternals. And later, following this view, I came to feel an artist might use anything-a dot, a line, the most conventional or unconventional symbol-to say what he wanted to say. The Nude in this way was a direct step to The Large Glass, La Mariee mise 'a nu par ses celibataires, meme. And in the King and Queen painted shortly after the Nude there are no human forms or indications of anatomy. But in it one can see where the forms are placed; and for all this reduction I would never call it an 'abstract' painting...... "Futurism was an impressionism of the mechanical world. It was strictly a continuation of the Impres- sionist movement. I was not interested in that. I wanted to get away from the physical aspect of painting. I was much more interested in recreating ideas in painting. For me the title was very im- portant. I was interested in making painting serve my purposes, and in getting away from the physi- cality of painting. For me Courbet had introduced the physical emphasis in the XIX century. I was interested in ideas-not merely in visual products. I wanted to put painting once again at the service of the mind. And my painting was, of course, at once regarded as 'intellectual' 'literary' painting. It was true I was endeavoring to establish myself as far as possible from 'pleasing' and 'attractive' physical paintings. That extreme was seen as lit- erary. My King and Queen was a chess king and queen. "In fact until the last hundred years all painting had been literary or religious: it had all been at the service of the mind. This characteristic was lost little by little during the last century. The more sensual appeal a painting provided-the more animal it became-the more highly it was regarded. It was a good thing to have had Matisse's work for the beauty it provided. Still it created a new wave of physical painting in this century or at least fostered the tradition we inherited from the XIX century masters. "Dada was an extreme protest against the physical side of painting. It was a metaphysical attitude. It was intimately and consciously involved with 'literature.' It was a sort of nihilism to which I am still very sympathetic. It was a way to get out of a state of mind-to avoid being influenced by one's immediate environment, or by the past: to get away from cliches-to get free. The 'blank' force of dada was very salutary. It told you 'don't forget you are not quite so "blank" as you think you are.' Usually a painter confesses he has his landmarks. He goes from landmark to landmark. Actually he is a slave to landmarks-even to contemporary ones. "Dada was very serviceable as a purgative. And I think I was thoroughly conscious of this at the time and of a desire to effect a purgation in my- 20</page><page sequence="20">DUCHAMP: Allegorie de Genre. 1944. Collage. self. I recall certain conversations with Picabia along these lines. He had more intelligence than most of our contemporaries. The rest were either for or against Cezanne. There was no thought of any- thing beyond the physical side of painting. No notion of freedom was taught. No philosophical outlook was introduced. The cubists, of course, were inventing a lot at the time. They had enough on their hands at the time not to be worried about a philo- sophical outlook; and cubism gave me many ideas for decomposing forms. But I thought of art on a broader scale. There were discussions at the time of the fourth dimension and of non-Euclidean geometry. But most views of it were amateurish. Metzinger was particularly attracted. And for all our misunderstandings through these new ideas we were helped to get away from the conventional way of speaking-from our cafe and studio plati- tudes. "Brisset and Roussel were the two men in those years whom I most admired for their delirium of imagination. Jean-Pierre Brisset was discovered by Jules Romains through a book he picked up from a stall on the quais. Brisset's work was a philological analysis of language-an analysis worked out by means of an incredible network of puns. He was sort of a Douanier Rousseau of philology. Romains introduced him to his friends. And they, like Apolli- naire and his companions, held a formal celebration to honor him in front of Rodin's Thinker in front of the Pantheon where he was hailed as Prince of Thinkers. "But Brisset was one of the real people who has lived and will be forgotten. Roussel was another great enthusiasm of mine in the early days. The reason I admired him was because he produced something that I had never seen. That is the only thing that brings admiration from my innermost being-something completely independent-noth- ing to do with the great names or influences. Apol- linaire first showed Roussel's work to me. It was poetry. Roussel thought he was a philologist, a phi- losopher and a metaphysician. But he remains a great poet. "It was fundamentally Roussel who was re- sponsible for my glass, La Mari6ee mise a nu par ses c6libataires, meme. From his Impressions d'Afrique I got the general approach. This play of his which I saw with Apollinaire helped me greatly on one side of my expression. I saw at once I could use Roussel as an influence. I felt that as a painter it was much better to be influenced by a writer than by another painter. And Roussel showed me the way. "My ideal library would have contained all Roussel's writings-Brisset, perhaps Lautreamont and Mallarme. Mallarme was a great figure. This is the direction in which art should turn: to an in- tellectual expression, rather than to an animal expression. I am sick of the expression 'bete comme un peintre'-stupid as a painter."

There may be more of a Montparnasse character to Mexico-caf4e life and a cosmopolitan Bohemianism. But Mexico frightens me. It has too much of the character of a tourist country. Here I lived in the same atmosphere I knew in Paris. I scarcely felt touched by the war. It seemed so far away from me. But there is more freedom-more room in this country. That was why I came here. "It is rather hard to be without cafes. It is such a wonderful thing in Europe-and particularly in Paris-to be able to stroll about leisurely and meet one's friends informally. Nevertheless one eventually becomes accustomed to the lack of this mode of living and it is recompensed for by more serious advantages. For example, in this country an artist is better thought of than in Europe. There he is a bohemian-an inhabitant of a half-world. Here he is a citizen of the world just as another. Even as early as 1934 I had begun to recognize certain fascist symptoms in France-in an outbreak here and a squabble there. I almost came out to America then with Paalen. Only some difficulties with my papers kept me from it. "I had never been to the United States; though I had traveled quite a bit about the world.

And when I began to see hints of impending trouble in Europe I made up my mind to leave the Old World as early as possible. I knew I would be found ineligible for military service due to disabilities from the last war; and I realized that in a time of crisis I could be of little use as a painter. "No, I had done no painting during those years at sea. In fact I did not begin to paint until 1924 or 1925. I had not touched a brush even in 'college.' Though, at fourteen years of age I recall being very much impressed by the work of Henri Matisse and particularly by his Interior with Goldfish. His son Pierre was a classmate of mine in school. And part of this interest in Matisse's work was no doubt due to my acquaintance with Pierre. "About 1924 I came across the first issue of La Revue Surrealiste and I became very much interested in it. Not so much in the paintings reproduced in it as in the general spirit of its contents. "One day about that time I was standing on the platform of an autobus going down the rue la Boetie. Two paintings in the window of the Galerie Paul Guillaume caught my eye. I got off the 'bus to admire them. They were Chiricos, the first I had ever seen. "I found later that strangely enough Andre Breton had also discovered Chirico in the same way-from a 'bus passing Guillaume's window. 22</page><page sequence="22">"Shortly after this I began to make some draw- ings. Vlaminck was the first painter to see them and to encourage me to go on. "Gus Bof a of Crapouillot was a friend of mine. He helped me to exhibit two or three drawings in the Salon de l'Araigne'e in 1925. "I naturally saw the surrealist exhibition at the Galerie Pierre in Paris in 1925; but at that time I still had not attempted anything more ambitious than drawings. My first exhibition of paintings took ' place only in 1927. "Meanwhile through La Revue Surre'aliste I had become a close friend of Andre' Breton. He wrote the introduction to the catalog of my show. I re- member spending a whole afternoon with him before the catalog went to press searching through books on psychiatry for statements of patients which we could use as titles for the paintings. The Museum's painting Mama, Papa is Wounded! was one of them. "Here in the United States the only change I can distinguish in my work is possibly in my palette. What the cause of this intensification of color is I can't say. But I do recognize a considerable change. Perhaps it is due to the light. I also have a feeling of greater space here-more 'room.'

I even ask myself if such a thing is really desirable. "It happens luckily in the case of Benediction of which you ask me to recount the geneology, that the task is made easy by some very exact land- marks which mark out the course of my life. "In 1927 my wife and I were subscribers to the Paris Symphony Concerts and we used to sit almost always in the same corner of the Salle Pleyel where the accoustics were particularly good. 1941-June, arrived New York.

"From this seat I had a clear view of the harpists' corner of the orchestra. Invariably-the music con- tributing-the peculiar shapes of harps, their strings vibrating in the light, veritable columns bind- ing earth to heaven, transported me into a world from which I, in turn, had to make my way back under pain of losing myself there. From these re- peated journeys was born in the beginning of 1928 the bronze sculpture which I called The Harp Player now in the collection of T. Catesby Jones, New York. "This was a sculpture entirely made of cords-a 'transparent' sculpture which 'can be seen and effects us from all sides at once.' 24</page><page sequence="24">Above LIPCHITZ. Benediction. 1945.

"In 1930 during my exhibition of 100 sculptures dating from 1911 to 1930 at the Galerie La Renais- sance in Paris, while wandering about the rooms, I kept always seeing the ghost of a sculpture which was not there. It was my harpists' corner at the Paris Symphony which I had stopped attending quite a while before. "Then in May, 1930, 1 began to work on another sculpture in a new attempt to reply to the call of my ghost. And so the bronze was born which I call Harp Players and to which I wanted in the begin- ning to give the title Orchestra Corner. But I have to confess that this sculpture also failed to satisfy me. I felt it still did not do justice to my vision. "At the end of the year 1930 Madame Hel'ene de Mandrot purchased a piece of sculpture in white stone. She had just built a villa on the C6te d'Azur and wanted this piece for her terrace. She asked me to come down to install it. "While I was there Madame de Mandrot asked me to make another, larger sculpture for her gar- den. Imagine a long vine-covered hillside sloping down to a valley which runs from the feet of the Maures to the bland peaks which stand out in profile on the horizon and are only equalled in beauty by those of Greece. It was then that my obsession once again rose to the surface. "On my return to Paris I made a clay model which now belongs to the Museum of Modern Art. I was able to erect the definitive bronze in the garden at Le Pradet in the winter of 1932. And I called it Song of the Vowels, a title which had no connection whatsoever with the famous poem of Rimbaud, but rather with a legend of ancient Egypt, according to which it appears there existed a prayer, the Song of the Vowels, which the priests and priestesses made use of to conjure up the forces of nature. And it is to this capability of man that I have consecrated my work. "In June 1940, on the road to exile our first stop was a delightful village, Castelmoron-sur-Lot. No sooner was I settled there than I set to work- though, of course, I had no interest for sculpture. I could only draw. "The news was disastrous, the Germans were already at the gates of Paris. It was the 13th of June. I remember I was there in that peasant house and I was thinking of my Paris, of what it was going to become, of the terrible sleep filled with night- mares into which it was going to be plunged. And I suddenly felt the need to sing it a lullaby soft and full of hope. "I was drawing-drawing and there again my old obsession reappeared but this time in a form I will say, more pastoral, less aggressive. "I have still in my portfolios many of these draw- ings, one of which, oddly enough, is dated: 'Castel- moron-sur-Lot, June 13, 1940.' 1 say 'oddly enough' because it is rather unusual for me to put such an exact date on my scrawls. A year later to the day I arrived in New York and landed June 13,1941. "The need to work tormented me; but at this time I found myself so upset, harassed by a thou- sand anxieties, and in such a psychological con- dition it was absolutely impossible for me to grapple with the subject which preoccupied me. It was only toward the end of 1942, when I had become calmer, that I began to work on my statue. "Many sketches were made in preparation for my first version of Benediction and while I was working on it. Finally it was shown in plaster with a study of it in bronze in my exhibition at the Buchholz Gallery in March, 1943. "There, I saw it in new surroundings and under the eyes of many people. This gives one a fresh perspective for judgment and I realized that this statue would gain if the figure were full length. "It was then that I set out on my new statue. "From March 1943 I worked at it without inter- ruption until January 1944 when I had to leave it aside to begin the model of Prometheus for Rio de Janeiro. In August 1944 I took up work again on Benediction. And in the meanwhile it had fully ripened in my mind. But as you know it was only at the end of January 1946 that I put the finishing touches to the work and delivered it to the Museum. 26</page><page sequence="26">"I hope this long discourse may clarify at least some aspects of a very complex subterranean stream. "For me continuity in an artist's work is analogous to tradition in the broad field of painting and sculpture and just as essential. Tradition, as I have said to you before, is the Great Stream; the river which is constantly moving forward-always and never the same. In my own work I may have some- times seemed to turn my back on the line I had been following to set off in another direction. But I must always come back. And I am not interested in so called non-objective art. I have a belief in the object-the object itself: like 'the virtue of prayer,' I believe in 'the virtue of the object.' "In my 1942 sculpture The Pilgrim, for example, there seemed a new interest in plant forms. But in 1917 I had already been exploring floral motifs in a piece. Now, however, I was particularly inter- ested in making something very 'open.' But 'open' forms likewise were an old interest, for example my 'transparents' of the late twenties and early thirties. Now these two features combined. In the first sketch for The Pilgrim the plant form reap- peared as a sort of flower with three legs. The third leg got no further in this essay than the wash drawing for the sculpture where it appears crossed out. But this open tripodal form eventually came into being in the large Benediction where it is actually the seat on which the harpist is sitting. And as the player's body and the harp are fused in my 1928 The Harp Player and in The Song of the Vowels, in Benediction the instrument on the figure's left knee has likewise fused with the player's body and her right hand is seen plucking its invisible strings.... "In my opinion the great modern sculptors are Rodin-in his late sketches, Brancusi; Archipenko- in his early work; Boccioni, and Laurens. "For me there is a close analogy between art and wine. The wine that is sweet when it is young will not age. The fine vintages when new are always sharp and bitter to the taste-hard to drink. With age a good wine mellows, the lesser wine turns to vinegar. LIPCHITZ: Lara Standing. 1942. Bronze. "And America as I have seen it is a land of un- limited possibilities. If for no other reason than the boldness with which you in this country explore fantastic and impractical undertakings. A fear of vulgarity, the grandiose, the ridiculous does not deter you. In Paris the Eiffel Tower is an example of what I have in mind. It was originally conceived as a structural tour de force to display the potentialities of steel. When it was first put up it called forth shrieks of ridicule at its ugliness. Today it is the blazon of Paris." BIBLIOGRAPHY: Foreword.

"In July 1938 I came over from Paris on Moholy- Nagy's invitation to take charge of a class at the New Bauhaus in Chicago. Before the opening of the autumn term, however, the Bauhaus was discon- tinued. Moholy was forced to restrict himself to a more modest plan in its successor-the Chicago School of Design. And I settled in Rockbridge Baths, Va. "In January 1940 1 was called up. I had volun- teered for service in the French army. My papers arrived and I left at once for France. "Six months later, June 19, I was taken prisoner at Billy on the river Cher in France. The next twenty months I spent in prison in Germany until my escape from Stettin and return to Free France.

It was there I made the first sketch for the painting Man and Girl. "I returned to the United States in October 1942. My first year here was spent in writing my book They Shall Not Have Me and in giving lectures for the Free French and the Red Cross. In February 1943 1 had a show of pre-war abstractions at Art of This Century in New York. However, I only really started to paint again in the summer of 1943. And I had my first exhibition of this new work in March of the following spring at Paul Rosenberg's Gallery in New York. "To the public this work seemed quite different from that shown at the Art of This Century a year earlier. But as a matter of fact for the last two years before the war I had been making figure studies after nature. Perhaps they seemed more abstract than my present work because I painted them with- out eyes and in this eliminated the most striking human element. Already in 1938 1 used to make my grown son, whom I had brought over that year from France, pose for me with an umbrella. But I wanted to work a few years in this vein before showing any of the results. Finally the war confirmed me in my feeling that I should develop my painting in this direction. "Personally, I feel I have always been doing the same thing in my work: this development has been merely a surface change, not an essential one. In fact I still consider myself an abstract artist. I regard the type of work I am doing today as thoroughly abstract. It is merely a more lively abstraction. The 28</page><page sequence="28">terms 'non-figurative,' 'non-objective' make me sick. They sound as meaningless to me as 'non-human.' And I speak of the terms only, not the art. For there are magnificent works of art that fall within these terms. But I admire them for the beauty they achieve, not for the fact that they avoid repre- sentation. "I think I have always been repelled by negative attitudes. Mondrian, whom I always admired but could not agree with, based his expression on a re- duction of means and the elimination of particu- larized representation. He used to say to me 'We are not of the same tradition-you are a naturalist.' Even as early as 1935 he 'accused' me of belonging to the French naturalist tradition. You certainly remember the occasion-one afternoon at Paul Nelson's on the Boulevard Auguste Blanqui when Nelson was explaining his Suez hospital project. "At that time I was already using curves and breaking away from Mondrian's approach. I never really accepted two dimensional painting. Why submit to the two dimensions of the canvas? You might as well paint only with white because the canvas is of that color. To me art is a way of in- creasing the freedom of man. We should not fall slave to the materials. The third dimension in paint- ing interests me most because it has to be created. A space is added to the world. All means of ac- complishing this are good. "I began to work my way out of white back- ground abstractions toward paintings with rounded forms suggesting three dimensions. I was interested above all in reading the world-in deciphering it. But I had not yet sufficiently mastered my expres- sion to accomplish this. An artist never does all he wants to, he does what he can in the face of techni- cal difficulties and his weaknesses. "Strictly speaking, an abstract painter is one who believes forms, purely as such, can constitute a language, like sounds in music. Much can be done with such an approach toward investigating the world around us. There are many painters who work in the abstract idiom but are not content to limit themselves to it: artists as far apart and as important as Leger and Max Ernst, Masson and Tanguy, Lipchitz and Calder. A circle, for example, can mean so much more than just a mere circular form. In my own case I found I could not express myself fully in so called pure form. But it was ex- perience-passionate development, with many ups and downs-that taught me I was not able to do so; it was not something I decided coldly. Just the same I could never bear to paint only natural forms. By temperament I was an abstract painter. But I went in the direction of cubism with its multiplication of terms and means of expression, in opposition to Mondrian's reduction of them. "Mondrian laughed at the idea of a mathemati- cal formula for art and even more at the use of geometry or algebra in painting. He accepted the idea that there are things which cannot be ex- plained and trusted the sensibility of the eye. But, on the other hand, he did not regard art as con- nected with human forms. That is where I did not agree with him. And I found myself between two HELION: De'fense d'. 1943. Oil. 29</page><page sequence="29">points of view: the view that held abstract to signify 'non-figurative,' and the view that understood sur- realist to mean 'non-real.' I could not satisfy myself with either. I felt I ought to be able to use everything in my art. I should try to put everything of my nature in it. 'Pure man,' in the musical sense of the word pure-that is to say 'perfectly in tune'-for me meant 'full man;' and pure painting, in the same sense, I felt, should be free to embrace anything that the artist contains. Art is a way of living-of living fully-with body, soul, senses, dreams, recol- lections and all. "Therefore I could not and will not admit a defi- nition that places any restrictions on art. I think definitions in their arbitrary restrictions have done more harm to art than anything else. Nevertheless, I believe very much in modern art-unlike so many today who tend to look, longingly, backwards. "In the beginning I believed that abstraction could be developed to embrace the full life of man. But in that period when I was painting abstractions I always felt I was living two lives: one in the studio and one elsewhere. It was actually a good thing for me that I had the urge to write. Writing brought home the limitations of my approach in painting. Most abstract painters write and talk very well. They need to talk. The restrictions they adopt in their pictorial language leave them a lot to express in another medium. "Part of the appeal of abstract art for certain painters is the difficulty it offers for critical evalua- tion. It cannot be judged by the same critical canons which are used to assay older art. It must be looked at on its own restricted and unfamiliar ground. One can much more easily feel he is right and the ad- verse critics wrong in such a field than in one with more familiar standards of quality. "For myself, I cannot believe in art unless it is HELION: Nature morte t Io 0aque d'eau. 1944. Oil. 30</page><page sequence="30">HELION: Les Reveurs. 1945. Oil. human expression. Too many artists, by strangling their most vivid impulses in too narrow a field, are chiefly producing 'art applied to materials.' Let us again seek freedom. "Today, when a modern artist undertakes to sing daily life, he is reproached for it. To many, this is shocking! It is bad taste! Then let us abandon all concern for good or bad taste! Art is a passionate avowal of faith. It is ground for fearless enthusiasm, not for prudence or prudery, cynicism or scepticism, or distinguished sophistication. "There is no art of the future. Only art of the present. Common, daily life is full of mystery and abstraction. I see no greater mission an artist can give himself than show this. Health or happiness is just as inspiring a subject matter as the strange, the fantastic. Let us draw from all sources. Let us paint 'loud and clear.'

But without a mystical element is there a single great picture, a single great poem, or-even-a single great social movement? Does not any organism, individual or social, wither and die if deprived of its power of the mystical, of feel- ing, of reason? Sadly I answer my own question: it is unjust to single out mysticism when it is precisely a lack of mysticism which destroyed France. But we should distinguish between different kinds of mysti- cism. And this war through which we have just passed, should at least have the result of warning us against cruel, one sided mysticisms. Recently I had occasion to remark: 'The good old times have passed when art nourished itself exclusively on the elements of the external world, the world of form, lines and color. We are interested in everything; not only in the external world, but also in the inner world of dream and imagination.' "All the phrases about so-called 'pure art' and about bad 'literary' art have quite easily led to the very shaky positions of these last few years. Lack of 'humanism' in art was a sinister presenti- ment of the sinister present. The example of the great schools and the great masters of the past teach us that a true and genuine quality in painting is not in harmony with the anti-human tendencies 1941-June 21, arrived New York; Washington, Connecticut. 1942-Mexico City to supervise the production of ballet Aleko. 1943-New York and Washington, Connecticut.

"Already during the other war I remember won- dering about painting. I was still very young and did not picture art as a profession or a job. It did not seem to me that pictures were destined solely for decorative or domestic purposes. I remember saying to myself 'Art is in some way a mission-and don't be afraid of this old word. What ever may have been achieved by the technical and realistic revolution in painting, it has merely scratched the surface. Neither so-called "real-color" or "conven- tional color" truly color the object. It is not what we describe as perspective that gives depth. Neither shadow nor light illumine the subject and the third dimension of the cubists does not yet allow a vision of the subject from all sides.' "This in short was the sentiment which seized me in Paris in 1910. But if you talk this way in a techni- cal, realistic period of art, you are accused of de- scending into literature. Was 1, myself, not trying to get away from 'literature,' from symbolism in art? "It was precisely 'literature' that I saw not only in the great compositions of the old 'romantics,' but also in the simple still-lifes of the impressionists and cubists, since 'literature' in painting to my way of looking at it is all that can be explained. It seemed to me that by 'killing' a still life or a landscape in 32</page><page sequence="32">some way-not only in deforming their surfaces- it would be possible to give them new life. "And just as I was accused of descending into 'literature,' before the war of 1914, today people call me a painter of fairy tales and fantasies. Actu- ally my first aim is to construct my paintings archi- tecturally-exactly like the impressionists and cu- bists have done in their own fashions and by using the same formal means. The impressionists filled their canvases with patches of light and shadow; the cubists filled theirs with cubes, triangles and curves. I try to fill my canvases in some way with objects and figures treated as forms-forms re- sounding like noises-forms of passion-designed to add a new dimension which neither the geometry of the cubists, nor the patches of the impressionists can achieve. "I am against the terms 'fantasy' and 'symbol- ism.' Our whole inner world is reality perhaps even more real than the world of appearances. If we call everything that appears illogical 'fantasy,' 'fairy-tales,' etc., we really admit that we do not Above-CHAGALL: House with Eye. 1945. ______________________________________________ Left-CHAGALL: The Red Cock in the Nighl. 1944.:Oil. 33</page><page sequence="33">understand nature. Impressionism and cubism are comparatively easy to understand because they present but a single aspect of an object to our con- sideration: simple contrasts of light and shadow. But a single aspect of an object is inadequate to the summing up of the complete subject-matter of a picture. Every object has diverse aspects. I am not against cubism: I have admired the great cubists and I have profited from cubism. But I have dis- cussed the limitations of its viewpoint at length with my friend Apollinaire, the man who really gave cubism its place ... "If surrealism had been more profound in its internal and external researches it might have crystallized into an artistic movement comparable to that of the period which immediately preceded it. And concerning the so-called 'literature' in my work I sometimes feel that in the use of formal ele- ments I am more abstract than Mondrian or Kan- dinsky. What I call 'abstract' is something that wells up spontaneously in the interplay of psychic and plastic contrasts, bringing to the picture and to the spectator realizations of unknown objects. "What frequently disturbs me in considering the periods of art since impressionism, is the inadequacy of artistic language, the insufficiency of artistic con- ception. How else are we to explain the artistic 'excursions' in search of new styles and content? Man seeks something new: he must recover the originality of his own language-an originality like that of the primitives ... Mankind will discover this language, however, without reverting to stylistic imitation. "We were against 'literature' in painting; but have we found another language and another con- tent? "Wars and revolutions have arisen in the last generation, perhaps because man wants to forge a new, clearer meaning. Once we have found this new meaning, a genuine artistic language, a new form will emerge. "I do not know (and who can foresee) what ex- ternal and internal form the French art of the future will take after France has recovered from its cruel ordeal. Will there be a gradual rebirth of the former sharp-eyed vision and its emphasis on form? Or instead of this former vision, will a new inner vision spring up? Will there be, at the same time, a new world view with new moral and social founda- tions?-And all this confined to France? After the circle of great masters has closed, France will, let us hope, fashion new miracles as in the past. "So let us keep faith, as ever, in the spirit of France. With our whole soul let us look for that re- birth, which will be at the same time that of the whole world." (Continued on page 37) : _ _ Ff^.R? a,hS ,, ,,, _gaR &lt; :?' ii i E . i:i' '''- - Do ;_ .

"The first aim in a painting should be universal expression. What is needed in a picture to realize this is an equivalence of vertical and horizontal ex- pressions. This I feel today I did not accomplish in such early work as my 1911 'Tree' paintings. In those the vertical emphasis predominated. A 'gothic' ex- pression was the result. "The second aim should be concrete, universal expression. In my work of 1919 and 1920 (where the surface of the canvas was covered by adjoining rectangles) there was an equivalence of horizontal and vertical expression. Thus the whole was more universal than those in which verticals predomi- nated. But this expression was vague. The verticals and horizontals cancelled each other, the result was confused, the structure was lost. "In my paintings after 1922 I feel that I ap- proached the concrete structure I regard as neces- sary. And in my latest pictures such as Broadway Boogie Woogie and Victory Boogie Woogie the structure and means of expression are both con- crete and in mutual equivalence . . . "In my 'cubist' paintings such as Tree the color was vague. Some of my 1919 rectangle composi- tions and even many of my earlier works were painted in black and white. This was too far from reality. But in my canvases after 1922 the colors have been primary-concrete. "It is important to discern two sorts of equilibrium in art: 1. static balance; 2. dynamic equilibrium. And it is understandable that some advocate equi- librium, others oppose it. piet mondrian 7- "The great struggle for artists is the annihilation of static equilibrium in their paintings through con- tinuous oppositions (contrasts) among the means of expression. It is always natural for human beings to seek static balance. This balance of course is necessary to existence in time. But vitality in the con- tinual succession of time always destroys this bal- ance. Abstract art is a concrete expression of such a vitality. "Many appreciate in my former work just what I did not want to express, but which was produced by an incapacity to express what I wanted to ex- press-dynamic movement in equilibrium. But a continuous struggle for this statement brought me nearer. This is what I am attempting in Victory Boogie Woogie. "Doesburg, in his late work, tried to destroy static expression by a diagonal arrangement of the lines of his compositions. But through such an emphasis the feeling of physical equilibrium which is necessary for the enjoyment of a work of art is lost. The relationship with architecture and its verti- cal and horizontal dominants is broken. "If a square picture, however, is hung diagonally, as I have frequently planned my pictures to be hung, this effect does not result. Only the borders of the canvas are on 450 angles, not the picture. The advantage of such a procedure is that longer horizontal and vertical lines may be employed in the composition. "So far as I know, I was the first to bring the painting forward from the frame, rather than set 35</page><page sequence="35">it within the frame. I had noted that a picture with- out a frame works better than a framed one and that the framing causes sensations of three dimen- sions. It gives an illusion of depth, so I took a frame of plain wood and mounted my picture on it. In this way I brought it to a more real existence. "To move the picture into our surroundings and give it real existence, has been my ideal since I came to abstract painting. I think that the logical outgrowth of painting is the use of pure color and straight lines in rectangular opposition; and I feel that painting can become much more real, much less subjective, much more objective, when its possi- bilities are realized in architecture in such a way that the painter's capabilities are joined with con- structive ones. But then the constructions would be- come very expensive; they would require a pretty long time for execution. I have studied the problem and practiced the approach with removable color and non-color planes in several of my studios in Europe, just as I have done here in New York. (See Mus. Mod.

Three-dimen- sional space-natural space-thus remained. Cu- bism therefore remained basically a naturalistic expression and was only an abstraction-not true abstract art. "This attitude of the cubists to the representations of volume in space was contrary to my conception of abstraction which is based on belief that this very space has to be destroyed. As a consequence I came to the destruction of volume by the use of the plane. This I accomplished by means of lines cutting the planes. But still the plane remained too intact. So I came to making only lines and brought the color within the lines. Now the only problem was to destroy these lines also through mutual oppositions. "Perhaps I do not express myself clearly in this, but it may give you some idea why I left the cubist influence. True Boogie Woogie I conceive as homo- geneous in intention with mine in painting: destruction of melody which is the equivalent of destruction of natural appearance; and construction through the continuous opposition of pure means-dynamic rhythm. "I think the destructive element is too much neglected in art." BIBLIOGRAPHY: Abstract Art. In Peggy Guggenheim, ed.: Art of This Century, New York, 1942, p. 32-3. Dated 1941.
