<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EXOTIC ORIGINS OF FISHES DEPICTED ON PREHISTORIC MIMBRES POTTERY FROM NEW MEXICO Stephen C. Jett and Peter B. Moyle A variety of fishes is depicted on Classic Mimbres figurative pottery of ca. A.D. 950-1150. Bowl paintings show fishing scenes and equipment. We have tentatively identified depictions of 20 fish taxa, 18 of which are of marine origin. The suite of species suggests a provenience in the Gulf of California, near Guaymas, Sonora. Mimbres traders apparently traveled 1,500 km from New Mexico's Mimbres Valley to the Gulf and back, probably to obtain shells and other materials for home use and for commerce. The Mimbres culture developed in the Mogollon culture area of mountainous southwestern New Mexico, southeastern Arizona, and northwesternmost Chihuahua (Figure 1), culminating in the Classic Mimbres (Surface Pueblo) period of about A.D. 1000-1150 (LeBlanc 1983a). Its most dis- tinctive product was Mimbres Classic Black-on-white painted pottery, which was produced mainly between A.D. 950 and 1150 in the score or so principal villages in New Mexico's Mimbres River drainage. Figurative pottery in this tradition is characcterized by representations of a considerable variety of mammals (including humans), birds, fishes, reptiles, amphibians, insects, and mythic creatures, executed mainly on the interiors of hemispheric bowls (Anbinder 1983; Anonymous 1978; Anyon and LeBlanc 1984; Bradfield 1929; Brody 1977a, 1977b; Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932; Fewkes 1914, 1923; Giammattei and Reichert 1975; Kabotie 1949; LeBlanc 1983a; Lister and Lister 1969; Moulard 1984; Muhlberger 1980; Nesbitt 1931; Rodeck 1976; Schultheis 1984; Snodgrass 1975; Stolper n.d.; Stuart 1983; Tamarin and Glubok 1975). Images of fishes, "present[ing] a remarkable degree of reality" (Olsen 1968:xiv), make up about 11 % of the animals represented on Mimbres pottery (Brody 1977a: 179). A few fishes are also depicted in the region's rock art of approximately the same period (Schaafsma 1975:103, 118, 1980:206, 232; Snodgrass 1975:175-176), and one pottery fragment and one piece of abalone shell cut into fish shapes are known (LeBlanc 1983a:101, 1983b:22). In 1957, Harold S. Gladwin pointed out, in passing, that most fishes depicted on Mimbres bowls struck him as being marine, not freshwater, species. He wrote, "I have ... given a number of drawings taken from Mimbres bowls in the hope that someone may be able to recognize a face, a shape, or a tail and give us some hint as to how and where the Mimbres women got their ichthyological ideas" (Gladwin 1957:224-225, 231). Gladwin (1979:13a-15) repeated his observation more than 20 years later, this time suggesting the saltwater nature of the fishes to be supportive of the idea of a Mediterranean origin for the Mimbrenios (see also Fell [1976:179])! While rejecting this latter thesis, the senior author did feel that Gladwin's remarks on the exotic origins of the fishes depicted were potentially significant. Therefore, he consulted with the junior author, Professor of Fisheries Biology, University of California, Davis, who made preliminary identifications of the fishes and their proveniences. More detailed attempts to identify species were then made by Jett and verified or rejected by Moyle. Finally, the illustrations herein were submitted to the region's premier authority on fishes, Donald A. Thomson, for his views. The taxa listed in Tables 1, 2, and 3 represent (with one exception) those that we felt we could identify with reasonable confidence; less certain identifications are listed in Table 4. Stephen C.

Shaded area is the Mimbres heartland, open triangles are major archaeological sites, and the dotted lines are likely routes of travel between the Mimbres Valley and the Guaymas area (open circle). POSSIBLE GEOGRAPHIC ORIGINS OF THE FISHES The Mimbrefios could have observed fishes in a number of settings. Among freshwater environ- ments were the Gila River and its headwaters, the more distant Colorado River, the Mimbres River and other small waterways east of the Continental Divide, the Rio Grande to the east of Mimbres territory (Miller 1961), the Rio Yaqui of Sonora (Hendrickson et al. 1980), and small rivers of northern Chihuahua. However, the nearest marine waters were those of the Gulf of California (Sea of Cortez), some 500 km away. The Pacific Ocean was 350 to 400 km farther, and the Gulf of Mexico about 1,575 km distant. Thus, purely from the point of view of geographic proximity, the Gulf of California would be the most likely source for the alleged marine fishes depicted on Mimbres pottery (Figure 1). Further, the Gulf of California was the main source of the marine shells that were traded widely in the Southwest in prehistoric times (Brand 1938). At the Galaz site, the shells came principally from the Gulf of California and the Gulf of Mexico (Anyon and LeBlanc 1984: 306). Twelve of 14 shell species known from three other major Mimbres sites are of the Panamic Province, which includes the Gulf of California and points south; one species is from the California Province (Pacific Coast), and one from the Salton Sea. The species correspondence of Mimbres shells as presently known is closest to the Guaymas area of the Sonoran coast of the Gulf of California, some 600 airline km from the Mimbres Valley (Bradfield 1929:62, 122-124; Di Peso et al 1974:8: 139-140, 166, 168-171). It has generally been assumed that the Mimbrenios obtained their shell by trade rather than directly, and certainly some shell objects reached them in this fashion, particularly via the Hohokam of central Arizona (who also occasionally depicted fishes on pottery [Moulard 1984:115, 127]) as well Jett and Moyle] 689</page><page sequence="3">0) (D 0 Table 1.

A.D. 700-1060 [Di Peso et al. 1974:8:127-131, 134, 168]). However, the large number of apparent marine fishes shown on Mimbres pots suggests that the Mimbreiios may very well themselves have engaged in on-site marine shell-collecting. As will appear, the suite of fish species depicted fits well with the idea of Mimbreiio expeditions to the central Gulf of California. FISH DEPICTIONS AND IDENTIFICATIONS Brody (1977a: 178) contended that "Only a few fish [depicted] such as pike, gar, or catfish have enough . . . detail to permit even tentative identification." However, we did not find this to be the case. Mimbres potters appear normally to have used certain conventions in depicting fishes of whatever kind, and because of this there are significant departures from literalism in most of their piscine images. The "standard" fish design included a triangular, somewhat forked tail; widely spaced pelvic and pectoral fins; small dorsal and anal fins; and an opercular opening (Figure 2). These characteristics were most commonly applied to depictions with elongate, streamlined bodies. These more or less standard features were presumably taken from fishes found in the Mimbres River and other local mountain streams and belonging mainly to the families Cyprinidae (minnows) and Catosomidae (suckers)-although there are also similar-looking estuarine/marine fishes. The pectoral and pelvic fins may have been perceived as equivalent to quadrupeds' legs, and placed accordingly. Given these standardized attributes, however, Mimbres potters' fish depictions were varied as to body shape (mainly depth), eye size and placement, mouth size and position, presence or absence of teeth, tail shape, and scale size and shape. Brody (1978:15) considered most patterns on Mimbres fish paintings to be nonrepresentational; however, we believe that, in fact, many, though by no means all, patterns are representational of scales and/or markings. The above variables allow the identification of many Mimbres fish images at the family level and, often, within families to the species level. This suggests close personal observation of living fishes by Mimbrenios. Nevertheless, a number of depictions are too generalized or stylized to classify narrowly. This may be for a combination of reasons, which are discussed below. Fish designs illustrated in the sources cited in paragraph one were examined and compared with illustrations in books on fishes (e.g., LaMonte 1958; Lee et al. 1980; Thomson et al. 1979; Thomson and McKibben 1976; Trautman 1957) and in light of the junior author's personal experience. A number of unpublished pots in museum collections were also examined by the senior author. We did not utilize the Mimbres Photo Archive at the University of New Mexico, but its photographs would no doubt provide additional data. Of the published fish depictions examined, a few could be identified as being of freshwater forms (Table 1), but most were classifiable as marine fishes. Some examples are shown in Figures 3 through 15, and the 10 probable and 8 possible marine taxa identified are listed in Tables 2 through 4, below (summarized in Table 5). Freshwater Fishes The main freshwaters probably accessible to the Mimbres people were the Mimbres, Gila, upper Rio Grande, and Pecos rivers. In these drainages, there is a combined total of perhaps 50 fish species belonging to the following families: Lepisosteidae (gars), Salmonidae (trout), Characidae (characins), Cyprinidae (minnows), Catostomidae (suckers), Ictaluridae (catfishes), Cyprinodontidae (pupfishes), Poeciliidae (livebearers), Percichthyidae (white bass), Centrarchidae (sunfishes), and Percidae (dart- ers). Illustrations and distribution maps of these species are available in Lee et al. (1980). A majority of the species (including the most abundant and widely distributed forms) are less than 150 mm long as adults, with body shapes that feature only minor variations on the "standard" fish design described previously and typified by Figure 2. Previous workers have spoken of depictions of the following freshwater fishes: trout, "pike" (squaw- fish?), squawfish, gar or "gar pike," sucker, catfish, sunfish, eel, and horned dace (Brody 1977a: Jett and Moyle] 691</page><page sequence="5">am CD Table 2.

However, in our estimation, only one freshwater fish taxon, the longnose gar (Lepisosteidae, Lepisosteus osseus) is clearly identifiable, on just 3 or 4 published Mimbres pots (Table 1; Figure 3; Brody 1983:90; Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:Plates 208a, 209a); the long, toothed snout and rounded tail are distinctive, and ichthyologist Donald A. Thomson (personal commu- nication 1984) considers this an "excellent fit." (Hugo G. Rodeck [personal communication 1984] informs us of the existence of unpublished Mimbres gar depictions even more clearly identifiable than published ones.) A second fish, the sucker (Catostomus sp., Catostomidae), may be depicted on 2 or 3 additional bowls (Brody 1977a:Plate 7; Snodgrass 1975:58-59). Both fishes are native to the Rio Grande (Lee et al. 1980). The gar is absent from the Mimbres River (Gehlback and Miller (1961:3), but the Rio Grande sucker (Catostomus plebeius) is found there (Hubbs and Miller 1948: 116; Lee et al. 1980:49, 387). An apparent trout-a fish of the mountain streams-is depicted in a petroglyph north of Silver City, New Mexico (Snodgrass 1975:175). There do appear on Mimbres bowls a number of generalized elongate fishes that could be either freshwater forms such as trout or minnow, or similar-looking saltwater forms (see below). In addition, one bowl shows a man in a fish costume; two men apparently have it on a line (Brody 1983:93; LeBlanc 1983a: 135; Rodeck 1976:51; Snodgrass 1975:134; Tamarin and Glubok 1975:40). This appears to be a composite- species fish, but the numerous barbels and spinous(?) dorsal fin suggest familiarity with catfish (Ictalurus spp., Ictaluridae) of the Rio Grande and Yaqui drainages. However, there is also an estuarine species of catfish from the central Gulf of California southward-the chihuil, Bagre pan- amensis (Ariidae), although it only has two jaw barbels. Among the most distinctive of the fishes on Mimbres bowls are those with extremely deep bodies. Deep-bodied fishes are most characteristic of habitats without strong currents, such as the protected rocky reefs of the Gulf of California (Moyle and Cech 1982). However, there are six species of moderately deep-bodied fishes in the upper Rio Grande and Pecos (but not the Mimbres or Gila) drainages that could conceivably have served as models for some of these depictions. Three of these species are sunfishes (Lepomis cyanellus, L. gulosus, and L. megalotis). These species are small, rarely exceeding 150 mm, and (with the possible exception of the green sunfish), were probably not particularly abundant, being at the extreme southwestern limits of their native ranges. These sunfishes are rather generalized deep-bodied fishes, without the distinctive features and color patterns that characterize Gulf of California fishes. Another distant possibility is the white bass (Morone chrysops), a large-river species that resembles members of the marine families Serranidae and Lutjanidae and that has been recorded from the Pecos River in recent years. It seems unlikely that it was common there in the past, however, as it is doubtful that there was much suitable habitat for it. Two more plausible possibilities are the catostomids Carpoides carpio and Ictiobus bubalus, both relatively deep-bodied for catostomids. Donald A. Thomson of the University of Arizona (personal com- munication 1984) has suggested that some of the fish paintings that we have identified below as being of grunts (Haemulidae) from the Gulf, may instead represent C. carpio. However, the depic- tions' lack of the distinctive sucker-like mouths so characteristic of the Catostomidae, combined with the difficulty that the Mimbrenios would have had in capturing or observing these fishes, makes the abundant and conspicuous marine grunts a more likely possibility. It thus appears that freshwater fishes could possibly have served as models for a small number of the fish forms depicted, but that the fishes painted on the pots are far too diverse in shape to have been solely or even primarily inspired by freshwater fishes. Rather than emphasizing freshwater fishes, Mimbres fish bowls seem overwhelmingly to depict saltwater species, from the Gulf of California (Tables 2-4). They are discussed below, by habitat and family. Fishes of Marine Rocky Reefs Serranidae. Two Mimbres bowls show a fish apparently swallowing a human (Anyon and LeBlanc 1984:562; Schultheis 1984:87; Snodgrass 1975:38). Carr (1979:31-32) and Hopi informants (LeBlanc 1983a:137) considered these scenes to be mythological, perhaps representing transformations; but taking them more literally requires no further assumptions than mythological interpretation does.

Generalized Mimbres fish, with features labeled (drawing after Brody 11977a:1641). The sea basses are large, generalized predators. They include the enormous (up to 2.4 m) jewfish (Epinephalus itajara), the only near-shore bony fish capable of swallowing a human. Jewfish reside in reef caves and may threaten divers, with toothed open jaws (Thomson et al. 1979:80). (Other large species are the Gulf grouper, Mycteroperca jordani; the giant sea bass, Stereolepis gigas; the totoaba, Sciaenidae, Cynoscion macdonaldi, and the milkfish, Chanidae, Chanos chanos. The Seri, one of the two aboriginal groups historically known from the Guaymas area, recognize the first three of these as well as Epinephalus analogus [Malkin 1962:31]. Serranids are supposedly also depicted in Cochimi rock art of the Bahia Concepci6n region of the Baja California side of the Central Gulf [Rector 1981:19].) In the absence of clear diagnostic traits other than body and mouth size, we do not consider the identification of the jewfish to be at all definite. One Mimbres bowl (Figure 15) shows four fishermen with a fish on fish- or feather-baited lines; the quarry is larger than the men. However, unlike the fishes mentioned above, this fish is shown as striped; the jewfish is blotched. An enormous fish being speared (Brody 1977a:55; Figure 13) in a scene on one bowl might also be a jewfish (see below). Other depictions of large fishes may be of parrotfish (see below). b Figure 3.

The deeply forked tail, elongate feathered dorsal fin, and pointed lips depicted on the fish of a bowl from the Galaz Ruin and a rather similar second depiction from the same site (Anyon and LeBlanc 1984:489, 527) suggest this species. It is a kind of fish that might easily have been caught by fishermen. Priacanthidae. One fish depiction with a huge eye (Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:Figure 204e) could be the popeye catalufa (Pristigenys serula), but the species is nocturnal, shy, and a deep-water dweller, making it unlikely to have been often observed; therefore, we are considering it a "possible" only. However, the species is caught on occasion and, because it is bright red in color, is likely to make a strong impression on the fishermen.

Four bowls (Anonymous 1975:35, 1984; Anyon and LeBlanc 1984:510, 571; Snod- grass 1975:55) show fishes that look like snappers (see Haemulidae, below), as indicated by body shape and fin configuration. Snappers are found in a variety of habitats, including over reefs. The longitudinal stripes of the painting in question would suggest the mullet snapper (Lutjanus aratus), which ranges from the central Gulf southward. However, the depictions are somewhat generalized and that species is uncommon and associated with estuaries. (Snapper remains have been found in prehistoric Cochimi middens and-purportedly-rock art of the Bahia Concepci6n region [Rector 1981:19].) Haemulidae. Grunts are rounded-backed fishes that school over the rocky reefs during the day, and are quite conspicuous. The Seri recognize at least one species, Amisostremus davidsonii (Malkin 1962:31). We believe that two species-the wavyline grunt (Microlepidotus inornatus) and the burrito grunt (Anisotremus interruptus) and a number of generalized grunts are identifiable on Mimbres pots (Figures 4, 5), although Thomson (personal communication 1984) considers another Gulf of California species, the black skipjack (Scombridae, Euthynnus lineatus), as an alternative for the wavyline. Three other fish depictions (Anyon and LeBlanc 1984:545, 590; Cosgrove and Cosgrove 700 [Vol. 51, No. 4, 1986</page><page sequence="14">FISHES ON MIMBRES POTTERY Z~ E \W - - I - 6 h \N'N - u m p - - Figure 6.

Note the elongate snout and feathered fins. 1932:Plate 206f) may be of grunts but also could be of Pacific porgies (Sparidae, Calamus brachy- somus), because they have the abrupt facial profile characteristic of this species. Grunts are the most frequently depicted fishes on Mimbres pottery, appearing on at least 18 to 23 bowls (Table 5). Kyphosidae. Sea chubs are of intermediate body depth and have rounded backs and bellies. They swim in schools in shallow waters above rocky reefs. At least four pots depict what seem to be members of this family. Possible species inspiring the Mimbreiios are: the Gulf opaleye (Girella simplicidens), with its bright blue eye (see Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:Plate 205f; this species is recognized by the Seri [Malkin 1962:31]); the Cortez chub (Kyphosus elegans), with its distinctly forked tail (see Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:Plate 205e); and (less likely) the zebra perch (Hermosilla azuae), a rarely encountered barred species (see Snodgrass 1975:54, 55).

The very prominant snout and dark tail identifies the depiction (Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:Plate 207e) as the bizarre longnose butterfly fish (Forcipigerflavissimus), a southern- Gulf species (Figure 6), although the closely related barberfish (Heniochus nigriostris) is more com- mon and is also a possibility. Another, ambiguous, deep-bodied fish with a dark tail and a long, toothed snout like a needlefish's appears in Cosgrove and Cosgrove's Plate 207f. A composite fish with a very rounded body and a very large toothed snout is shown on a bowl from the Galaz Ruin (Anyon and LeBlanc 1984:559).

Note steep head profile, "unicorn" effect, backward-pointing dorsal fin, and eye and mouth placement. Pomacanthidae. Angelfishes and damselfishes are strikingly colored and patterned reef fish with very deep, rounded bodies. There are two Gulf of California species of angelfishes, and identifiable characteristics of both of these are present in Mimbres depictions. One painting (Figure 7 [Snodgrass 1975:21]; also, possibly, Anyon and LeBlanc [1984:522, 533, 557] and Carr [1979:Plate 12]) seems to have mainly the Cortez angelfish's (Pomacanthus zonipectus) pattern (strong body banding and dark face) but has a pointed anal fin and slightly forked tail more like those of the king angelfish (Holocanthus passer). Thomson (personal communication 1984) calls this a "very strong fit." (Two other fairly deep-bodied, banded Gulf fishes exist: the Panamic sergeant major, Pomacentridae, Abudefduftroschelii, and the Pacific spadefish, Ehippidae, Chaetodipterus zonatus.) There is another depiction having a black face, but it also has black fins and no body markings; its long, curved dorsal fin is reminiscent of the Moorish idol (Acanthuridae, Zanclus canescens [Fewkes 1923:33]). Another example is dark with a single white band like a king angelfish, but the band is diagonal and the tail too forked (Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:Plate 205c; Giammatei and Reichert 1975: Jett and Moyle] 703</page><page sequence="17">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY A Figure 9. Drawing of a Mimbres fish painting from the Swarts Ruin (Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:208e), showing blenny-like cirri. Plate 3; Gladwin 1957:225). Some depictions seem to have characteristics of the giant damselfish (Pomacentridae, Microspathodon dorsalis): a prominent trailing tail and dorsal fin, and either uni- formly colored or bicolored body (Brody 1977a:Figure 140; Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:Plate 205d; Fewkes 1914:Figure 26, 1923:Figure 40). However, none of these pictures is absolutely attributable to any one of these species, and the paintings are probably best considered composites or generalizations of members of the abundant and highly visible family Pomacanthidae. Two depictions are like angelfishes in general form but have a spiny dorsal fin as do the closely related butterfly fishes (Anyon and LeBlanc 1984:509, 522). Angelfishes are the second-most frequently depicted Mimbres fishes, appearing on at least 18 to 22 bowls (Table 5). (Alleged angelfishes also appear in Cochimi rock art in the Bahia Concepci6n region [Rector 1981:19, 20].) The angelfish bowl paintings have sometimes been interpreted as being of freshwater sunfishes (Centrarchidae); but these fishes have less deep, rounded bodies and are not strikingly marked. Their sluggish-water habitats are not characteristic of the Mimbres region; the Rio Grande is the extreme westerly extension of the family's native range (Rostlund 1952:284-285). Labridae. The Pacific razorfish (Hemipteronotus pavoninus) is the most unusual of the wrasses, having an unusual "unicorn" fin. It frequents sandy bottoms near reefs in the lower Gulf. Three such fishes appear on two Mimbres bowls, although one is (incorrectly) depicted with catfishlike barbels (Figure 8; Snodgrass 1975:title page, 22, 54, 58). One other bowl shows fishes with "unicorn" head appendages, but the body shape is not that of the razorfish (Lister and Lister 1969:90). Scaridae. There are several parrotfish species among the Gulf's reefs, all distinctive in their beaklike mouth form. One possible depiction (Bradfield 1929:Plate 72[38]; Snodgrass 1975:21) has a pattern of black, white, and hatched squares; these could conceivably represent the azure parrotfish's (Scarus compressus) orange-outlined blue scales. There are at least three Mimbres scenes of a human or humans apparently carrying a large fish over its (their) shoulder(s) (Figure 19; Anyon and LeBlanc 1984:551; Brody 1977a:175; Snodgrass 1975:137). The fishes could be parrotfishes, which may attain lengths of up to .8 m, but other possibilities exist. LeBlanc (1983a:20) suggested they might be Colorado River squawfish, once common in the lower Gila and attaining lengths of up to 1.3 m. However, the mouths are too small and the body too chunky for squawfish to have been the likely models. Clinidae or Blenniidae. Blennies are small, inconspicuous reef fishes. They are distinctive in the area in having cirri on their heads. Two paintings show fishes with such head appendages; the 704 [Vol. 51, No. 4, 1986</page><page sequence="18">FISHES ON MIMBRES POTTERY a ^&lt; ^'&lt;0'r? '-*-1 - ^^oc ^ b Figure 10.

Note wedge shape and dorsal eyes. peculiar posterior spirals on one (Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:Plate 208e) may represent dorsal and anal fin projections (Figure 9). The only blenny of significant size (7 in., 17.8 cm) is the largemouth blenny (Clinidae, Labrisomus xanti). In addition to those mentioned above, various fishes with what at first appear to be barbels occur in Mimbres ceramic art. Our first thought was of the Mexican goatfish (Mullidae, Mulloidicthys dentatus). Closer examination of the depictions indicates, however, that these zigzag lines connect the fishes and represent something other than barbels (Anonymous 1984; Bradfield 1929:Plate 72; Snodgrass 1975:57). Brody (1977a:180) referred to two such lines emerging from the "lips" of a fish as "worms." We feel that they are not worms but instead have symbolic significance; Hugo G. Rodeck (personal communication 1984) has concluded that these are "voice lines" indicating in- tercommunication. In several instances, the mouths of pairs of fishes are joined by such lines. Benthic Fishes In addition to the mullet snapper mentioned above, two strictly benthic (soft-bottom habitat) fish species have been at least tentatively identified, and are listed below by family: Rhinobatidae. One Mimbres bowl painting (Moulard 1984:Plate 47; Schultheis 1984:87) depicts the characteristic wedge shape and dorsal eyes of the shovel-nose guitarfish, Rhinobatos productus (Figure 10; Table 3); Thomson (personal communication 1984) agrees. These fishes are common on sandy shores throughout the Gulf of California (Thomson and McKibbin 1976:18-19), and are 705 Jett and Moyle]</page><page sequence="19">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 11.

Albulidae. One possible additional benthic species, appearing on one pot (Figure 17; Moulard 1984:Plate 13; Muhlberger 1980:Figure 1), is the bonefish (Albula vulpes; Table 4).

(personal communication 1984) also considers the string of fishes in Figure 17 to "seem to be very good drawings of bonefish." Nevertheless, due to this species being rather generalized in form, we are considering the identification to be only tentative. Fishes Largely of Pelagic Habit One highly probable and four less likely pelagic (open-sea, non-bottom-feeding) fishes have been noted (Tables 3, 4). They are listed below, by family: Atherinidae. Schools of Gulf grunion (Leuresthes sardina) often approach rocky shores when young, and are seen over reefs. "The adults spawn on central and upper Gulf beaches during ... January to May . . ." (Thomson et al. 1979:251). The mating involves two fishes burying their posterior halves in the sand; the anterior halves that protrude upward from the sand divergently could have inspired the "Siamese twin" fishes depicted on one bowl (Figure 11; Brody 1977a: 196, 1977b:28; Scott 1983:62). Thomson (personal communication 1984) considers this "a very accurate representation of grunion spawning." Possibly, the cross-hatched posterior portion (in contrast to the striped anterior portions) symbolizes burial in sand. An additional bowl painting (Brody 1983: 104)-shows two long sinuous intertwined fishes with pointed snouts; two wading birds are pecking at the fishes. Thomson (personal communication 1984) proposes that spawning grunions are rep- resented here; the apparent writhing is suggestive, and Thomson speculates that a cross-hatched area between the fishes could indicate eggs. Belonidae. Needlefish are very distinctive, and though pelagic are often seen over reefs. These fish (Strongylura and Tylosurus) are attenuated, with a toothed beak, and have a sinuous movement. Cosgrove and Cosgrove (1932:Plate 208b) show a fairly clear depiction (Figure 12), although the fish is drawn as if it had a toothed tongue rather than toothed jaws; this is a convention also used with depictions of other toothed creatures (Hugo G. Rodeck, personal communication 1984). A fish 708 [Vol. 51, No. 4, 1986</page><page sequence="22">FISHES ON MIMBRES POTTERY Table 5.

A realistic fish with very belonid form is also depicted on a bowl in Scott (1983:56). Exocoetidae. One depiction (Bradfield 1929:Plate 73) seems to have the proper shape and fin configuration for a flyingfish (Fodiator acutus). Another (Brody 1977a:188) is of a winged "fish" that, although having legs, resembles a flying fish in the form of its "wings" and mouth; Mimbrenos may have classed this species as a bird and have gratuitously depicted it with legs; or, a composite creature may have been intended. (Another painting of a fish with legs-probably an anglefish-is known [Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:Plate 23 Id].) The flyingfish is apparently known to the Seri only by hearsay (Malkin 1962:63), but it is thought to be depicted in Cochimi rock art near Bahia Concepci6n (Rector 1981:19-20). Xiphiidae. A painting reproduced in Brody (1977a:176) has certain swordfish (Xiphias gladius) characteristics. However, the "sword" is incorrectly executed (and could be just decorative), and the body is too deep. (If the "sword" is not part of the fish, a jack could be represented.) The swordfish is only occasional in the Gulf of California, but it does often rest at the surface and might thus have been observed. Dead fishes washed onto the beach might also have been seen. Like the Mimbreinos, the Seri recognize many more rocky-reef than benthic fishes (Malkin 1962: 37). It is worth noting that 63% of the eight supposed Mimbres depictions of largely benthic and pelagic fishes are less confidently identifiable (DOC = 4 or 5), as compared to only 36% of the 72 supposed depictions of fishes of the rocky reefs and vicinity (Table 5). Further, the two pelagic fishes that are more confidently identified are the two species most likely to be seen over reefs. Perhaps this reflects less frequent encounters with the non-reef fishes, as would be expected in light of their habitats.

No. 118541). to unpublished photographs in the Mimbres Archive, we do not feel that this is necessary. Use of published sources alone allows us to conclude with confidence that our primary hypothesis-that the Mimbrefios depicted marine fishes-is verified. False interpretation as diagnostic traits of what are really features fortuitously arrived at by Mimbres artists is rendered less plausible by the many readily identifiable Mimbres depictions of pronghorn, bighorn sheep, deer, quail, macaws, hum- mingbirds, horned toads, etc. But it is not necessary to accept every one-or even the majority- of our proposed identifications in order to concur that the test of the basic hypothesis has been positive. One need only examine Figures 6, 7, 8, and 10, for example, to observe the very close fit between Mimbres depictions and marine species that do not have even remote equivalents in local Mimbres waters. THE QUESTION OF WHALES A few examples of Mimbres art have been interpreted as possible whales (e.g., those in Brody [1977a:55], Schaafsma [1975:103], and Stolper [n.d.]). David Henderson, an expert on Gulf of California whaling, has been consulted in this connection (personal communication 1983). He believes that none of the creatures depicted qualifies as a cetacean, for the following reasons: fish- type fins rather than flippers are shown in these representations; tails resemble piscine caudal fins much more than they do whale flukes; eyes are incorrectly placed for whales; head form (except Schaafsma [1975]) is incorrect; no Spanish records of aboriginal whaling exist. The most interesting of the depictions is that in Brody (1977a:55). An unclothed man stands on- 710 [Vol. 51, No. 4, 1986</page><page sequence="24">FISHES ON MIMBRES POTTERY Figure 17.

He is inserting a long, thin, tanged, pointed object into a depression in the creature's back. Rather than seeing this as a flensing scene (Gulf Coast natives did eat the meat of beached whales), Henderson views this as a picture of a large fish being harpooned; knives, not spears, would have been used for flensing. Harpoons and other fish spears were used on the Sonoran coast. The creature shown has crosshatching on its body, which elsewhere we have interpreted as a rendering of fish scales; and, an opercular opening is shown. Interpreted according to the above observations, this scene can be considered evidence of spearing a large fish, presumably for food. However, the possibility remains that a whale was indeed observed but was depicted using piscine conventionalizations of the kind we have mentioned above. Rodeck (1932) noted Mimbres depictions of long antennae on insects that lack prominent antennae in nature, and concluded that such antennae were a "shorthand" indicating the creatures were insects. Rodeck also interpreted a piscine tail on an apparent insect as signalling its being aquatic; this is more problematic, but another depiction of what appears to be a mayfly larva (Moulard 1984:Plate 44) shows an opercular opening, perhaps to symbolize the insects's aquatic character. From an ichthyologist's point of view, "I would vote for a pilot whale [Pacific blackfish, Globicephala scam- monii] misidentified as a fish" (Thomson, personal communication 1984). IMPLICATIONS OF MIMBRES FISH DEPICTIONS Mimbres fish depictions appear in six contexts: 1) one or more fishes with no other representational elements; 2) fishes accompanied by nonhuman mammals (Brody 1977a: 164, Plate 7; Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:Plate 219d); 3) fishes being eaten by wading birds (Anyon and LeBlanc 1984:473, 535, 553; Brody 1977a:185; 1983:104, 108; Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:Plates 208f, 209a-c; Jett and Moyle] 711</page><page sequence="25">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 18.

Several conclusions can be drawn from the above. Although there are no known Mimbres fish- eating scenes (Rodeck 1954:9), and although LeBlanc (1983a:126) stated that fishes "were rarely eaten," it seems clear from Mimbres art that some fishes were caught and eaten, a fact acknowledged by LeBlanc (1985:23). (One must caution, however, that several of the bowls referred to below have little or no provenance and so could conceivably have had their painted designs tampered with.) Many (but by no means all) of the fishes depicted are good food fishes. Two bowls show men swimming with fish; that illustrated in Figure 14 may indicate that the swimmers are pursuing fish with expectations of catching them by hand, a common aboriginal practice (e.g., Pennington 1963: 712 [Vol. 51, No. 4, 1986</page><page sequence="26">FISHES ON MIMBRES POTTERY Figure 19. Mimbres bowl painting from the Osborne Ruin(?), showing a woman(?) with a large fish over her shoulders (Brody 1977a:175). 112). Carr (1979:16) interpreted this as a transformation scene from myth, but a literal interpretation seems more economical since no assumptions beyond simple observation of reality are required. Another bowl shows a fish taken on a line baited with smaller fish; and another pot is known showing a man carrying two strings of fishes; a net lies nearby (Anonymous 1978; this bowl was repainted in modem times, so the design may not be entirely original [Larry Frank, personal communication 1983]). Figure 15 shows four men with a large fish on lines that apparently are baited. Another painting is of a man with a pole over his shoulders; on one end is an animal, on the other a fish (Rodeck 1954:9). In addition, three bowls show persons carrying very large fishes across their shoulders (Figure 19). Figure 16 illustrates a man and a bird-headed anthropomorph pulling a large fish with lines or ropes; another fish next to two reticulated elements seems to indicate net fishing (Snodgrass 1975:36-37); small fish nets were reported historically from the lower Colorado and Gila and in Northwest Mexico from Guaymas southward (Beals 1943:18; Rostlund 1952:85, 166, 167, 291). Figure 17 depicts a bird-headed anthropomorph carrying a single fish in one hand and a string of fish in the other; a bundle of lines might be thought to represent a reed-funnel fish trap, as was used by the Tarahumar in swift streams (Pennington 1963:110-111, Plate 14). The bird- headed or -masked persons with long beaks, plus the depiction on at least 18 bowls of wading birds (including ibises) eating fish (conversing with them, according to some [Brody 1977a:219; Kabotie 1949]), suggest the possibility of belief in a wading-bird deity of fishing.

At least, it seems clear that fish were caught and used for food, or at least that Mimbreios observed others fishing. This is in contrast to the historically known widespread avoidance of fish as food among native Southwest and Plains cultures (Carr 1979:15-17; Helen Issel, personal communica- tions; Olsen 1968:xiv, 3), but a few groups in the Southwest (e.g., the Colorado and lower Gila River tribes and the Tewa) andiit all Sierra Madre Occidental and Gulf Coast groups did fish for food, by hand or with poison or using spears, bows, nets, traps, weirs, and hooks (Arnon and Hill 1979:304; Driver and Massey 1957:202-208; Hill 1982:59-61; Pennington 1963:110-113; Rostlund 1952). Despite the use of fish as food, a number of species depicted are not normally thought of as "eating fishes." It seems likely that colorful creatures such as angelfishes and butterflyfishes were chosen because of their striking shapes, colors, and patterns as well as their general noticeability over reefs. Contexts 5 and 6, above, suggest a ceremonial or at least mythic role for fishes. Figure 18 shows what may be a man in a composite-species fish costume or a transformation scene. The fish is apparently being held by men, with lines to the mouth (Carr [1979:25-26] interpreted this as the War Twins extricating the rain from the Cloud Swallower monster). Composite-species fishes (Brody 1977a: 196, 1977b:28; Scott 1983:62) and composites of fishes and non-piscine creatures (including the Awanyu, or plumed serpent) suggest a mythic role (composites not involving fishes are also known). Perhaps fishes depicted in the company of rabbits, pronghoms, and birds illustrate myth- ological themes as well. More speculative are questions as to whether painted fishes on bowls represented piscatorial "sponsors" or "protectors" of individual Mimbrenios who made trips to the Gulf, or whether fishes were adopted as emblems of particular individuals or families who engaged in travel to the Sea of Cortez. Rodeck (1980:4) wrote, There are some subjects which occur so very frequently, such as . . . fishes, etc., as to suggest they may be clan or extended family totems .... The fact that there are a relatively few such often-repeated subjects correlates with the relatively few such clans or groups in most simple societies. One may not care to place much weight on Rodeck's rationale, but Hopi informants also suggested a clan-totemic function for these zoomorphs. (Could composite creatures depicted on bowls sym- bolize clan alliances, inter-clan marriages, or the like?) According to LeBlanc (1983a: 119-120; see also Berlant [1983:16]), the subjects depicted did not seem to cluster geographically in inter- or intrasite terms or to have any particular age or sex correlates. However, for whatever reason, a markedly greater number of different fish taxa on site-attributable bowls are found on pots from the Swarts Ruin and the Galaz Ruin than from other sites (Table 5). Mimbres classic black-on-white bowls were interred with deceased individuals, often in pristine condition but sometimes apparently having been previously passed down as heirloom pieces. The most finely painted bowls were apparently the most highly valued, and their uses seem not to have been strictly utilitarian (Bray 1982; Jenks 1931; LeBlanc 1983a: 138). Brody (1978:17) noted so great a percentage of the figurative bowls to have been found in burials that he believed "that figurative pictures must be considered as mortuary subject matter." But perhaps at least some of the designs commemorated the activities of the owner(s) in life; Brody felt that underworld mythology was being illustrated and Moulard (1984:113-115) believes that fish images are specifically related to ancestors and the Underworld. However, a 1,500-km round trip to the Gulf would certainly have been a memorable occurance-as would have been seeing the striking fishes there. At very least, the depiction of many identifiable Gulf of California fishes by Mimbrenio potters seems to establish that Mimbrenios did indeed travel to the Gulf, there observing the fishes first- hand, presumably in the water. The fact that many of the species depicted do not presently normally occur in the upper third of the Gulf (north of Kino, Sonora), and the fact that extensive areas of the suitable rock habitats along the rest of the mainland shore are essentially confined to a stretch extending some 80 km northwestward from Guaymas (Thomson et al. 1979:3, 35), point to the Mimbrenios' having been active in the Guaymas area. The fit between marine mollusc species found in Mimbres sites and those now occurring in the Guaymas area reinforces this conclusion, although no archaeological evidence of Mimbres activity on the Sonoran coast has been reported (Bowen 714 [Vol. 51, No. 4, 1986</page><page sequence="28">FISHES ON MIMBRES POTTERY 1976:64-65, 113-114). (Note, however, that water-temperature-and, thus, marine-organism- distributional patterns may have fluctuated at times in the past.) Indeed, the most plausible hypothesis explaining the Mimbreino presence at the Gulf coast is that they were engaged in collecting for the Southwest shell trade (although unworked shells are never depicted on pots). During classic times, the Mimbres area entered, in a major way, the Mesoamerican- Southwest trade network; this correlated with an increase of the Mimbres regional population to as high as 4,000. Exotic goods found in the archaeology are concentrated at the 20 or so largest villages, particularly the Galaz site. LeBlanc (1 983a: 115, 143-144) wrote, "The Mimbres seemingly acquired goods by serving as middlemen." This was probably true for some of the products exchanged; there is little evidence of full-time craft specialization among the Mimbrefios. As mentioned above, it has previously been assumed that the Mimbrenios were merely customers for shells coming through central Arizona and Casas Grandes, Chihuahua (but see Minnis [1984:185-186]). However, on the basis of the fish evidence, one may now conclude that the Mimbrenios were active participants in shell collecting and transport. "These people ... seem to have been excellent craftsmen in the manufacture of... shell beads, and apparently made them in some abundance" (McGregor 1965: 362). Over 7,000 shell items were recovered from the Galaz Ruin, although evidence of shell- working is lacking (Anyon and LeBlanc 1984:306, 313). In addition to shells and other shell beads, pendents, and bracelets, nearly 3,000 shell beads were found in five caches at Cameron Creek Village (Bradfield 1929:60-62, 121-24), 325 beads in a cache at the Saige-McFarland Mimbres site (Klinger and Lekson 1973), and nearly 1,000 beads at a site in the Jornada del Muerto to the immediate east of the Mimbres area (Hester et al. 1978). Shell bracelets are shown on humans depicted on some Mimbres bowls (Hugo G. Rodeck, personal communication 1984), and an apparent shell bracelet forms the design on one bowl from the Galaz Ruin (Anyon and LeBlanc 1984:477). One could also speculate that Mimbrenfios were procurers for the early Casas Grandes shell workshops, perhaps trading unworked shells for shell beads, pendents, bracelets, and the like, which they would then trade to Chacoan Anasazi and other groups of New Mexico and Colorado; however, new chronologies strongly suggest that the end of Mimbres culture occurred at the time of-and was probably linked to-the rapid rise of Casas Grandes (Anyon et al. 1981:219-222; Anyon and LeBlanc 1984:316; LeBlanc 1983a:158-159). The Mimbrenfios also may have mined turquoise in the Burro Mountains (Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:65, 109; Northrop 1975) and certainly traded turquoise (perhaps from more northerly sources [Anyon and LeBlanc 1984:306-307, 313; LeBlanc 1983a: 143-144; Minnis 1984:184-185]). There are early Spanish as well as later reports of such long- distance travelers in the American Southwest and Northwest Mexico (Ford 1983; Mathien 1983; Pailes 1978:142; Schroeder 1981:43-46; see also Brand [1938] and Colton [1941]), including of people from Zuni and the Rio Grande going to the Pacific Coast to obtain shells (Frisbie 1975:126- 127). These kinds of expeditions and trading contacts would help account for the introduction of some Anasazi cultural elements into the Mogollon region, the occurrence of Mexican copper bells, the finding of remains of macaws and parrots and their depiction on Mimbres bowls (Anyon and LeBlanc 1984:307, 313-314, 522; Bradfield 1929:Plate 51; Brody 1977a:54, 179, 187, 1983:95; Carr 1979:34-35:Plate 1; Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:Plate 15c-d; Fewkes 1923:12, 34; LeBlanc 1983a:100, 143, 1983b:22, 31; Minnis 1984:183-185; Moulard 1984:29, 120-121; Nesbitt 1931: 56, 91; Rodeck 1980:7; Snodgrass 1975:ii, 20, 69, 76, 80), the frequency of Mimbres trade pottery at early Casas Grandes, and the purported influence of Mimbres designs on Casas Grandes ceramics (Di Peso 1974:6:102, 8:127-131, 134). (There is relatively little obviously imported pottery at Mimbres sites, however [Bradfield 1929:39; Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:92-99, 109], and "Few Mimbres vessels and almost none that have figurative paintings were traded outside the Mogollon region" [Brody 1977a:212]; see also Anyon and LeBlanc [1984:314] and LeBlanc [1983a:143].) It is notable that whereas most of the fish species depicted on Mimbres bowls are rocky-reef species, most of the shellfish species found in Mimbres sites are most likely to have been found on beaches (both habitats exist in the Guaymas area). There are a few hints of possible transporting of fish (presumably dried) for home consumption or trade. As mentioned above, three depictions of persons (probably women) carrying fish on their shoulders are known (Figure 19). There is also one bowl showing a fish atop a trapezeform design Jett and Moyle] 715</page><page sequence="29">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY (Snodgrass 1975:56); other bowls showing men carrying presumed burden baskets of similar form (Brody 1977a: 11, 168, 190, Plate 16, 1983:68-69; Fewkes 1923:27; LeBlanc 1983a: 136; Snodgrass 1975:iii, 137, 139; Tamarin and Glubok 1975:33) suggest the possibility that the curious depiction mentioned symbolizes the transporting of fish. A bowl in the Detroit Institute of Art (76.87) also shows a razor(?) fish on a burden-basket symbol. Hugo G. Rodeck (personal communication 1984) concurs in the identification of this symbol and believes the burden basket to signify abundance. The appearance of fish-effigy vessels as well as fish bones and scales at Casas Grandes may be relevant (Di Peso 1974:6:91, 185, 199-200, 205, 209, 253, 301, 8:250; Moulard 1984:Plate 90). Heavy dependence on fish for food is reported from a Jornada Mogollon site southwest of Roswell, New Mexico (Gaines 1981:938-939), and fish remains are reported from Jornada sites along the Rio Grande (O'Laughlin 1977:27). An unclassified fish bone was discovered at the Kartchner Mimbres site (Sullivan and Berg 1983:107), and Anyon and LeBlanc (1984:216, 218, 222) tallied 30 fish bones from all Mimbres Valley sites, although none was from the Classic Mimbres period; the only families identified, at the Galaz Ruin, were Catostomidae (suckers) and Cyprinidae (Gila nigrescens, Rio Grande chub). Outside the Mogollon area, fish bones and scales, thought to represent eating of fish, have been found at sites ranging from about A.D. 1100 to the 1500s at the Chamisal Site (Tiwa) on the Rio Grande (Katherine Sargeant, personal communication 1984), Chaco Canyon, Aztec Ruins, and Bandelier National Monument, New Mexico, and Grasshopper Pueblo, Arizona. The species found were all fresh-water (longnose gar, blue sucker, and bonytail), but none presently inhabits the area where found and in at least the Chaco cases were certainly brought in from a considerable distance (Gehlback and Miller 1961; Olson 1968:4). Gars are also depicted in kiva murals at Kawaika Pueblo, Arizona (Smith 1952). Fish-drying was not widely done in the historic greater Southwest but is reported for Santa Clara (Hill 1982:60), San Ildefonso, the lower Colorado and Gila river people, and coastal Cahitans from Guaymas Bay southward; the latter salted their dried fish (Beals 1943:18; Driver and Massey 1957:244-245; Rostlund 1952:140, 198, 301). The shortest likely route from the Mimbres Valley to the rocky coast near Guaymas is down the Mimbres River, across to the Rio de Bavispe, down it to the Rio Yaqui, and across to Guaymas via the Rio Matape, a map distance of roughly 685 km (Figure 1). Riley (1982:3) shows a major trade route paralleling the Bavispe and Yaqui circa A.D. 1500. A return via Casas Grandes would have been by a route crossing the Yaqui and the rugged Sierra Madre Occidental via present-day Sahuaripa, La Junta, Tres Rios, and Pacheco (Di Peso 1974: 6:167). A minimum probable round-trip distance would have been some 1,500 km, no mean distance on foot through desert and mountain of "the most inaccessible and rugged terrain in western North America" (Hendrickson et al. 1980:65). Long- distance trade specialization among the Mimbrenios could relate to population pressure in the Mimbres Valley. Indications are that "the population was quite large and very severely taxed the resource base . . ." (Nelson et al. 1978:200; also, LeBlanc [1983a:154-155, 168, 1985]). At any rate, LeBlanc (1983a: 158-159) has pointed out that the Mimbres Valley lay on the route from the Chaco Canyon trading center to Mexico and that the Mimbrenios seem to have been much involved in north-south trade. The rise of classic Mimbres appears to have been closely linked to the fortunes of Chaco, and the end of Mimbres culture corresponded with the fall of Chaco and the assumption of its and Mimbres' functions about A.D. 1130-1150 by the ascendant Casas Grandes culture. The accuracy of depiction of fishes by Mimbres potters raises some additional questions. The regional pattern in historic times implies that men were the travelers and traders and women the potters, and one apparent depiction exists, on a Mimbres bowl, of a woman decorating a pot (Moulard 1984:Plate 4). However, Brody (1977a: 115-117) has pointed out that in Puebloan culture men occasionally decorated pottery, and that the representational subject matter (e.g., game animals, ritual activities, mythic creatures) implies at least occasional pottery painting by Mimbres men. In any case, if it was the men who observed the fishes, how could the women have painted accurate images of the latter? If individual men selected particular fish species as "protectors" or as emblems, they probably observed those species closely in the field. It seems likely that they carried back mental images of the fishes rather than that they made drawings of some kind on the spot. Even if dried fishes had been brought back, most of them (excepting, perhaps, angelfishes) would have pre- sumably been head-less and tail-less and have lost much or all of their marking and thus have been 716 [Vol. 51, No. 4, 1986</page><page sequence="30">FISHES ON MIMBRES POTTERY poor models. Upon their return, the men could have prepared sketches for the women to work from, but the idea of men doing their own pottery painting is more plausible. Painting from memory, plus repeated copying of established motifs, could at least partly account for the lack of completely literal depiction of fin form and placement, pattern, and so forth. (This would conflict somewhat with LeBlanc's [1983a:138-139)] hypothesis that a small number of artists-as few as 10-did the decorating of all the best Mimbres mortuary pottery. If such a small number were represented, it might mean either that only a small number of individuals were involved in traveling to the Gulf or that a few outstanding artists accompanied expeditions, perhaps expressly for collecting mental images later to be materialized in pottery paintings.) Some of the purely decorative designs on fish depictions were presumably added gratuitouslyby pot painters; these designs could simply reflect generalized recollections of striking patterns on fishes (or on earlier pottery depictions), but such gratuitous patterns appear on mammal, bird, and reptile representations as well. One is tempted to speculate that the putative involvement of Mimbres men in long-distance trade, and the consequent cultural stimulation, somehow contributed to a climate favoring the rapid rise of Mimbres Classic figurative pottery and production of the great quantity of outstandingly decorated bowls made by the Mimbreiios. However that may be, we can agree with Paul S. Martin (1979:70) when he wrote, Mimbres Classic pottery demonstrates such originality and such care in draftmanship that it is in a class all by itself; no prehistoric Southwestern pottery can compare with it as an expression of the sheer ecstasy of living.
