<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HERETICAL SCIENCE OF LOREN EISELEY E. Fred Carlisle I "I am trying to write honestly from my own experience" a solitary man wanders along the wintry banks of a Platte River tributary. As he walks and watches the frozen edges of the stream, he is startled by the face of a catfish that stares at him from the ice where it has been trapped. At first Loren Eiseley turns away, but something makes him hesitate—something calls him back to "the bleak, whiskered face." "Perhaps," he explains, "it was the river calling to her children." Perhaps . . . but for the moment he prefers to call it science. And so he decides to cut the fish from the ice and take it home. Something about testing "the survival qualities of high-plains fishes." That may have been his initial im pulse—and indeed he does make the test. But he learns something more from it than the fact of survival or the failure to survive. He discovers in the experience the deep and tenacious impulse to live which has persisted through fish and men for millions of years. He realizes that he and that mud flat, backwater catfish share something: they are both "concentrations" of life. An experiment that could pass for science has turned into an experience that transcends science, but in doing so, it begins to define the science of Loren Eiseley. Several years before the fish incident Loren Eiseley also found himself alone beside the Platte River. This time it is deep summer, and he is there, as you would expect, for one of the "various purposes of science." But this time he does not come upon any bones or fish. Instead, he becomes like a fish as he gives himself over to the magic of water. "Then I lay back 354</page><page sequence="2">LOREN EISELEY in the floating position that left my face to the sky, and shoved off." He is afraid as he does, but he trusts nature enough to risk himself, and he longs to merge with it, if only briefly. But in that moment he escapes the limits of his body, he extends his senses, he loses himself in time. Momentarily, he crosses over into oblivion. "I was the water and the unspeakable alchemies that gestate and take shape in water." An extension of the senses has become an extension of science, and this, too, helps describe the science of Loren Eiseley. I speak rather extravagantly, I suppose, but really it is Eiseley who speaks extravagantly—for a scientist anyway. When he talks about the magic of water, an encounter with a fish, and some greater unity beyond us all, he seems to wander beyond the bounds of acceptable and systematic science, and for some he becomes incomprehensible. Even his students and colleagues sometimes do not understand. In The Unexpected Universe he writes about an insistently literal-minded student who, unable to follow the sense of his metaphor about a mouse and the Byzantine Empire, accused him of anthropomorphism, not perceiving at all her own insensitivity and imperceptiveness before knowledge, imagination, and in sight. In The Man Who Saw Through Time he describes the attempts of a young colleague "to correct [his] deviations" and direct him back to proper science, for as far as the young man was concerned, Eiseley had been wasting his time. A psychology student and a young scientist: both were trapped in the objective fallacy of science—alienated from their own origins, and confined to the solitude of their own hearts. We require imagination and we must be extravagant, perhaps, to escape either. Henry David Thoreau once rejected a similar demand—the "ridiculous demand" made by England and America "that you shall speak so that they can understand you." He worried, instead, that his writing might not be extravagant enough. It might not wander far enough beyond the ordinary limits to speak the truth he had discovered. "I desire to speak somewhere without bounds; like a man in a waking moment, to 355</page><page sequence="3">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW men in their waking moments." Sometimes Thoreau's words puzzle and confuse, and if Eiseley's occasionally do, perhaps it is because he speaks extravagantly, too. He wanders beyond the limits of conventional science to discover and say something about the meaning of our world and the way we live in it. Loren Eiseley writes of miracles, golden alphabets, ghost continents, of the magic of water, and of enormous extensions of vision through time and into other forms of life. He ex presses wonder and love. He confesses terror and loneliness. Like Thoreau, he does not stop at the imagined borders, for he speaks from an inner sky—that vast void within, where science, imagination, and feeling fuse into a vision of existence at once both personal and scientific. Although I am not a scientist, I know that Eiseley is a fully competent, knowledgeable, and experienced scientist in the conventional sense. In a way, he knows the science that Thoreau did not. However, except in the essays of his "visible profession," as he calls it, he does not write about research and discoveries or about early man in the sense that he is reporting results to his professional colleagues. He writes, in stead, from within the theory of evolution. It is his instrument or paradigm. And through it he makes discoveries, he writes about them, and he writes with love. It was not always that way, for there was a time when Eiseley seemed lost in a dark, cold, and meaningless world, a place that impersonal and objective science had revealed to him. He describes the experience in "The Star Thrower." He has traveled to the remote beaches of "Costabel," and as he walks along the beach in the dim dawn, possessed by a black mood, he comes upon a solitary figure picking up stranded starfish and throwing them back, far out into the sea, hoping that each will survive. Given Eiseley's state of mind, the gesture seems futile, and so at first he thinks the star thrower mad and his action folly. But finally he discovers that the futile gesture is actually a gesture of love enabling the star thrower, "who loved not man, but life," to express love and 356</page><page sequence="4">LOREN EISELEY to project it "beyond the species boundary"—without ex pectation of response or return. There, in that realization, Eiseley discovers that he, too, loves the world with an unex pected and unpredictable love, arising "from the domain of absolute zero." And so he joins the starfish thrower, there on the beach in the early dawn, struggling to save men, as well as starfish, by loving the world. After being away for many years, Eiseley one day returned to a wild-plum thicket he had visited in his youth. He writes about the experience in an essay ("The Last Neanderthal") in which he is talking about the marvelous organizing power of animal and plant life and the corresponding burning away of particular forms of life. He returns because he "wondered if the thicket was still there and because this strange hoarding and burning at the heart of life still puzzled" him. He is older now and conscious of his own burning—conscious that "it was all going." But for me the most moving aspect of the ex perience occurs when Eiseley sees in the bitter plums falling about him—gifts "given from no one to no one"—an image of his "hoarded memories," all the experiences and discoveries that gradually unfold in his books. And he realizes that he wants to make gifts of them. "I wanted to drop them at last. . . I wanted to strew them like blue plums in some gesture of love toward the universe ... to be laid down for someone, anyone, no longer to be carried and remembered in pain." These gestures of love—these extravagant gestures—lie at the center of Loren Eiseley's life and writing, but so does science. And while it may not have always been so, science and love are inseparable for Loren Eiseley. Such a science re quires him in a way to renounce his scientific heritage. But, it enables him to transcend the evolutionist's "meager concen tration" upon survival, adaptation, or speciation, or on the chemistry of the chromosome, and to achieve a biology which is "only for the living." That is Loren Eiseley's heresy, but then what can we expect from a scientist who says, "I am try ing to write honestly from my own experience." 357</page><page sequence="5">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW II "Without imagination no man can follow another into these halls" So Herman Melville warns us as he tries to describe the mysterious and terrifying whiteness of the whale. Without im agination—without taking that personal leap beyond obser vable and known fact—without risking error, failure, and even death, we shall, Melville seems to say, never discover the difficult and elusive truths about the ocean and whale. The pursuit of Moby Dick requires more than imagination, of course, and Melville knows that, too. It requires observation, study, and knowledge. Chapter after chapter of Moby Dick recounts the dissection, measurement, analysis, comparison, and classification of whales. It is sometimes a comic tax onomy, but it is nevertheless an informative and necessary process if we are in fact to know whale. Melville never allows us to forget, however, the limits and inadequacies of all tax onomies. And so he insists on another dimension without which the quest cannot succeed. "No. Only in the heart of the quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his angry flukes; only in the profound unbounded sea, can the fully in vested whale be truly and livingly found out." The seeker must learn not only by empirically observing and measuring the whale's skeleton; he must directly experience the living whale in all its beauty and power. The person who wishes to comprehend whales, or nature if you will, must go there—in a way, I suppose, as Darwin had to go there or even as Eiseley has wandered through the present remnants of the past in search of the origins of man. Eiseley has sensed something of this in Melville, and he is clearly aware of it as a scientist. However, he does not say very much about Melville's intuitive comprehension of the process of science; he writes, instead, of the kinship he feels with the novelist. Melville's books dramatize life as a long, demand ing, and for him, finally exhausting and defeating personal quest, and it is here, especially, the kinship between Melville 358</page><page sequence="6">LOREN EISELEY and Eiseley lies—personal quest: the center of Melville's work and the center, I believe, of Loren Eiseley's science. For him science is a personal quest that recognizes the self as the origin of all knowledge—even of scientific knowledge—but that also requires the systematic structure of science for its success—and that relies on investigation and imagination for its insights. By committing himself deeply and passionately to the personal and universal dimensions of science, Loren Eiseley gives modern biology and anthropology a new idiom, and in doing so, I think he gives them a new dimension. "My personal universe" In "The Slit," the first chapter of The Immense Journey. Eiseley narrates a typical experience from his field work as a scientist. As he rides across "a sunlit, timeless prairie," he comes upon a deep cut in the sandstone where the prairie merges into a black, pitted, and slashed wasteland. He is looking for fossils, and so he decides to climb into the slit hoping to find at least a bone. He finds instead a skull from the remote past before man, and with that the experience begins to vibrate with time and meaning. The ride and his search are by no means a simple quest for fossils, for the experience becomes a symbol for science and for its nature as personal quest. The slit is a natural cut through time that exposes ten million years of geological history and change, and so in one sense, he is physically going back to the scene of the past in search of records. And that is his job as a scientist. The slit also provides the stage for a journey of discovery and understanding that enables him to imaginatively return to the past in search, this time, of meaning. And for him that is also part of the scien tist's life. The search for records and relics of the past and the quest for meaning in time and evolution are both legitimate and necessary domains of the scientist, and both are primarily personal activities. Near the end of the chapter Eiseley writes explicitly about his "personal universe": "Forward and backward I have gone, 359</page><page sequence="7">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW and for me it has been an immense journey. Those who ac company me need not look for science in the usual sense, though I have done all in my power to avoid errors in fact. I have given the record of what one man thought as he pursued research and pressed his hands against the confining walls of scientific method in his time." The record is unconven tional—the "prowlings of one mind," "the seasonal jottings of a man preoccupied with time"—for Eiseley does not give us "science in the usual sense." Nevertheless, it is science—no longer content with mere observation, dissatisfied with con ventional research, frustrated by the limits of the scientific method—science with a touch of Thoreauvian extravagance. Perhaps I am stretching the conventional meaning of science beyond recognition, but I would make a far more serious mistake if I interpreted Eiseley's warning—do not look for science in the usual sense—or his intimate and personal style as indications that he is merely writing conventional autobiography. There are of course elements of autobiography in each of his books. Nevertheless, when I use the word per sonal, I do not simply mean ordinary autobiography, nor do I believe Eiseley means just that. The word has at least three meanings, only the first of which is the autobiographical. The second has to do with the nature of anthropology as a descriptive science; it relies on individual observation, research, classification, and judgment in ways, say, that the exact sciences do not. All the field work that Eiseley describes in his books speaks to that. And what we know about the ways fossils are classified, judged, and valued reveals anthropology's reliance on personal knowledge, in sight, and judgment. The third is related to the basic human impulse—formalized and systematized by science—to make contact with reality, to structure, understand, and to some ex tent, control it. This is somewhat complicated in Eiseley, for he concerns himself with the value and meaning of scientific discovery and knowledge more than with facts and classifica tion, and so it is possible to argue that his anthropology is per sonal, yes, in its attempts and desire to understand natural 360</page><page sequence="8">LOREN EISELEY phenomena, but his concern with value and meaning is philosophic or poetic. Possible, but I think his insights are ex tensions of science based on prior or existing theories—based, for example, on the modern theory of evolution. But whichever is the case, the personal element is the point; and it is clearly present in his desire to know the world. In the books which primarily describe his "personal uni verse" (such as The Immense Journey and The Unexpected Universe,) Eiseley makes himself the center of each chapter, and he rarely includes other persons. This is not simply a function of the first person point of view or of the autobiographical mode or even of the lonely nature of his research. Those elements are important in themselves, but they express a great deal as well about science as a personal quest. Eiseley emerges in these books as an anthropologist who often works alone and who relies mainly on his own research, insights, and discoveries. He recognizes that solitude is a fact of life—science reveals that to him—but he also regards solitude as a fact of science. The scientist—Eiseley's style suggests—must rely on himself, for he is the point of origin of all truth that has meaning for him. And further more, he must participate in the things he is studying. He can not escape it, for one thing, but more than that, Eiseley seems to imply that he, at least, comprehends nature better by living in things rather than by simply manipulating or operating on them. By doing that, Eiseley does not give up being a scientist for philosophy or poetry; he restores, instead, the experience of science to itself. He gives the body of science back to its mind. This is indeed not science in the usual sense. From the personal and experiential center, Eiseley moves outward into the present and through time into the past mak ing repeated contact with external reality. Many of his chapters reflect that movement: they begin with the self and move variously into the personal and evolutionary pasts or into the personal and scientific presents, never losing touch with the self at the center, and normally returning at the end to Eiseley the man and scientist. The rhythm is from the self 361</page><page sequence="9">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW into the world and back; the structure implies interaction; it speaks really of a scientist living in the things of science and in the things of his world. But no matter how far out into the world and time he may be, like Thoreau, Loren Eiseley the scientist is always finally "tracking himself." It is a reflective and reflexive process—not a subjective nor a circular one. These stylistic elements speak clearly for Loren Eiseley's own personal involvement in science, but they only imply his belief that science itself is a fundamentally personal endeavor and that scientific theories or discoveries are forms of personal knowledge. His use of the journey metaphor makes his belief explicit. He speaks of his own life as an immense journey—a long and lonely one that he shall never complete. And in "The Ghost Continent," he talks about "the epic journey of modern science ... a story at once of tremendous achievement, loneliness, and terror." In both cases, quest and discovery are implicit in the metaphor. In Darwin's Century, he makes the metaphor even more specific. He writes about scientists as voyagers who are trying to piece together the charts and maps of unknown seas—trying unknowingly to piece together the theory of evolution. The use of charts and maps—chapter titles like "The Time Voyagers" and "The Pirate Chart"—is not simply a literary conceit or device, effective as it may be, but it expresses, I believe, Eiseley's sense of what science is. The metaphor suggests, first, something of the way new theories are discovered. They are in a sense pieced together from the results of uncertain thrusts into the unknown. The metaphor also implies the way new theories function. They are in fact new maps or charts of experience that enable us to understand the world more clearly. And finally the journey metaphor says something about the adventure, risk, and mystery characteristic of scientific search and discovery. Eiseley speaks about the curious paradox "that science . . . owes its origins to an act of faith that the universe can be rationally interpreted." And he also talks about the mysteries that still remain. "The idea, the structure itself [evolution], however, looms ever vaster and more impenetrable. It is linked 362</page><page sequence="10">LOREN EISELEY with the mysteries within the atom as it is also linked with the intangible, immaterial world of consciousness which no one has quite succeeded in identifying with the soft dust that flies up from the summer road." Each scientist must make a fiduciary commitment. And to do that and to encounter the unknown, as Eiseley describes it, involves, at some level, per sonal passion, commitment, and risk. The metaphor of the voyage—explorations made by men—also defines the structure of Darwin's Century, and that, I think, expresses in yet another way Eiseley's awareness of the personal basis of science. Although the organization is somewhat chronological and even thematic, Eiseley has formed Darwin's Century mainly around men, all of whom are working at the puzzle, trying to piece together fragments of the hidden and elusive design of life. The book, then, speaks of individual scientists encountering or entering into personal dialogue with the world. Such men try to make contact with reality, and sometimes they say something "true" about it. Their personal quests succeed and end in new discoveries, theories, or parts of theories. Normally, science then approves and accepts a given discovery into the existing canon, giving it an authority and so-called objective truth that seems to remove it from the per sonal domain. Nevertheless, these "true" statements are still human constructions that are fundamentally personal and provisional. Eiseley observes, for example, in The Firmament of Time that science "has looked through many spectacles in the last several centuries, and each time the world has appeared real, and the plot has been played accordingly. Strange color ings have been given to reality and the colors have come mostly from within. As science extends itself, the colors, and through them the nature of reality, continue to change. The 'within' and 'without' are in some strange fashion inter mingled." He is talking about the history of science here, but his view seems no less applicable to modern science. Men make certain assumptions, and scientists accept certain theories. And these become the colors (the spectacles or 363</page><page sequence="11">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW theories) with which we paint or design, or even project, real ity. "The worlds drawn out of nature are human worlds" —human designs for a territory that repeatedly eludes us. Although Eiseley does not directly say so, perhaps he thinks of the theory of evolution not only as a human construction but as a root metaphor. In The Firmament of Time he does say, "it is only by the hook of the analogy, by the root metaphor . . . that science succeeds in extending its domain." Since the theory of evolution has vastly extended the domain of sci ence perhaps we may consider it an integrative formula or metaphor through which science expresses observations and intuitions of change, process, growth, indeterminacy, and un certainty which replaced the earlier vision of the world as a fixed, known, and predictable place. I am saying in one sense that we have created the theory of evolution—much as a poet might create a poem—but of course we have discovered it, too, and there are books and books to verify that. The point, and I think Eiseley says it in a variety of ways: the scientist cannot know finally whether his discovery reveals an objective charac teristic of nature or an artifact created and colored by science or by the scientist himself. Eiseley contemplates that uncertainty in "The Ghost Con tinent" when he writes about the massive curtained coach of Scandanavian legend into which no one could ever see. Among other things the chapter suggests Eiseley's sense of our inability to know reality. So he ponders: "Suppose . . . the figure in the coach is a changeling and its true face is no face . . . Or . . . behind the concealing drapery . . . there is caught only the swirling vapor of an untamed void whose vassels we are." Then, in terms which unmistakeably refer to science, Eiseley says, "I think of her acolytes, ourselves, toiling in a hundred laboratories with our secret visions of what is, or may not be, while the wild reality always eludes our grasp." (my italics) It eludes our grasp as Moby Dick forever eludes those who seek him and would possess and control him. "I know him not, and never will," Ishmael admits in exasperation. Like Eiseley's speculation that the figure in the coach may have no face, 364</page><page sequence="12">LOREN EISELEY Melville also sees that the whale—nature—has no face. "How comprehend his face when face he has none?" But the quest for Moby Dick goes on. Science continues to search. And Eiseley persists in trying to understand—although he is not insensitive to the possible madness of scientific monomania, just as Melville understood Ahab's madness. "the wild reality" The scientist can never finally grasp the wild reality beyond us, but his belief that the universe can be rationally explained makes him continue. He is committed, passionately and ethically, to discovering and saying something true about reality. And this impulse to make contact and to know con stitutes the universal intent in scientific endeavor. My discus sion of the personal dimension in Eiseley's work and in his notion of science repeatedly led to the connection between per sonal impulse and universal intent. They are two poles of a single endeavor, and therefore, they are really inseparable. I think we sense the universal intent in Eiseley's writing and scientific activity already, but I would like to speak directly of his desire and felt responsibility to make contact with a reality beyond and separate from him. I want to say something about his belief in science and more specifically about his acceptance and use of the theory of evolution and of related scientific knowledge and discovery. Eiseley accepts evolution scientifically as every biologist does. His own professional work has helped confirm or elaborate the theory, and he has studied and learned far more than he has observed. However, he has also interiorized the theory, so that it functions as a major structure for perceiving and comprehending experience. He dwells in it, and through it he makes contact with reality. His research and travel, his scientific knowledge, and his belief in the modern theory of evolution give his work perspective, shape, and authority, as well as content. If they are not the life of his work, surely they sustain it. In The Immense Journey Eiseley has written a series of 365</page><page sequence="13">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW chapters explaining the way in which man's brain develop ment has separated him from nature and has given him con sciousness, language, and some control over his environment and even over his own evolution. As his brain developed, man "was becoming something the world had never seen before—a dream animal—living at least partially within a secret uni verse of his own creation and sharing that secret universe in his head with other, similar heads . . . Man had escaped out of the eternal present of the animal world into a knowledge of past and future." The chapters consistently develop Eiseley's own interpretation of the evolution of the human brain. But that interpretation is firmly grounded in authoritative infor mation and accepted theory. To write these chapters ("The Real Meaning of Piltdown," "The Maze," "The Dream Animal"), the author needed a thorough historical knowledge of early human fossils and their significance for evolution (material which he elaborates more fully in Darwin's Century); he needed to know and understand the details of human brain development; he required knowledge of recent scholarship about human evolution; and he had to understand the related biology. He has relied on his knowledge of the systematic structure of his science, and he has shaped that material into a significant explanation of the discoveries about brain development: "For the first time in four billion years a living creature had contemplated himself and heard with a sudden, unaccountable loneliness, the whisper of the wind in the night reeds." Eiseley's commitment to the systematic structure of science as a way of knowing something significant about human evolution has enabled him to extend prior scientific discoveries into the mind and feelings of living persons. Although he has used and relied on the information available to him, he nevertheless recognizes how incomplete it is and even how mistaken it might be. "In the end we may shake our heads, baffled, and have to admit that many lines of seeming relatives, rather than merely one, lead to man. It is as though we stood at the heart of a maze and no longer remembered how we had come there." 366</page><page sequence="14">LOREN EISELEY "The Angry Winter," a fascinating, complex, and beautiful chapter in The Unexpected Universe, also depends on a detailed knowledge of man's emergence. In it Eiseley explores the inter-relationship between the Pleistocene glaciations and recessions and the emergence of man. This requires an "in tricate knowledge of man's development from early bipedal apes to a creature in our own guise," and it requires an equally detailed knowledge of the advance and recession of glaciers across the northern hemisphere, for Eiseley assumes that man emerged as he did because of the ice. Life and environ ment are inseparable, and they develop together. If man had remained tropical, for example, he may not have developed fire which "opened to [him] the final conquest of the earth." The ice also affected his migrations, and it influenced the sources of his food. So its effect was extensive and definitive. From these natural facts, or scientific speculations, Eiseley tries to grasp the meaning for man. His discovery begins in his study with a story about his dog and an ancient bone; it slowly emerges through his account of the advance and retreat of the ice; and it ends with a narrative of his youthful encounter with a jackrabbit in a deserted cemetery "late in a snow-filled night." As his dog Wolf growls threateningly at him, he senses the gulf between them, yet he realizes that he, too, has shadows from an angrier and harsher past in his own mind. The long development of man through the ice age reminds him of that past and reveals the progressive isolation and in creasing loneliness of man. Facing the jackrabbit again, now in recollection, Eiseley feels the million years between them, but he remembers that he did not shoot, for he sensed, even then, a faint glimmer of kinship. He and the rabbit once shared the desolation of winter deep in the past before man possessed fire. And so the scientist can say about man's emergence from the ice: "Man has been matured by winter; he has survived its coming, and has eaten of its marrow. But its cold is in his bones." "Out of such desolation [the desolation of the cemetery and of the great extinctions through the Pleistocene] had arisen man, the desolate ... he is a belated phantom of 367</page><page sequence="15">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW the angry winter. He carried, and perhaps will always carry, its cruelty and springtime in his heart." We have scientific knowledge that helps us understand our world and that gives us insight into its meaning. Loren Eiseley believes in that knowledge, and he knows that it is the source of meaning—or better, he believes that meaning dwells in the knowledge and facts of science and in the things of history of nature. "All of these perceptive insights that we obtain from the natural world around us depend upon painfully ac cumulated knowledge." But we are also often baffled by the natural world and limited and misled by our incomplete knowledge of it. And Eiseley cannot forget that, either. Science liberates us with its knowledge and vision, yet it repeatedly redefines our limitations as it raises new problems and reveals new boundaries. He accepts the systematic struc ture of scientific method and knowledge, and they take him a long way. At the same time, he presses against the narrow, confining limits of the very system he accepts, as he struggles to see through to the meanings hidden in nature. He tries to extend science so that it comprehends more, but he is also try ing to understand for himself. So no matter how far the in struments and structure of science carry him into nature, Loren Eiseley is still really tracking himself—still seeking to establish his reality against the unknown. "Mine was the wound of a finite creature seeking to establish its own reality against eternity." The universal intent of science merges now with the personal quest. "only by a great act of human imagination" In The Man Who Saw Through Time Loren Eiseley describes Francis Bacon as a voyager who set man on the road to modern science. His historical significance for Eiseley lies, particularly, in his convictions that through science man could create a "second world" out of nature that would transform his life; he "envisioned man's power to change and determine his own destiny." The importance Eiseley attributes to Bacon 368</page><page sequence="16">LOREN EISELEY clearly confirms Eiseley's own belief in the principles of science. But lest we misunderstand Bacon's conception of science—and thus Eiseley himself—the author reminds us quickly that Bacon's "light" (his science) "was compounded of both knowledge and charity" (my italics) and that the "hidden world" Bacon foresaw "could be brought out of nature only by a great act of human imagination." The new world Bacon spoke of would be drawn out of nature by subjecting it to human influence. It would emerge as man accumulated knowledge—invention would lead to in vention, discovery to discovery—but " 'without art [it] would not be done.' " Man would discover the "new continent" through inventiveness and creativity. But even that is not enough, for the charity and humanity Bacon insisted on re quired a moral and philosophical imagination, as well. When Eiseley comes across Bacon's statement, "we must gather from the whole store of things such as make most for the uses of life," he repeats it in pain, for it is here we have failed. Our science possesses knowledge, but it largely disregards charity and love. Our science has erected a huge invisible struc ture—an "invisible pyramid" that requires great expense and sacrifice and that possesses almost magical power and in fluence—but it has failed to find the new and hopeful conti nent Bacon sought. "Ours cannot be the light he saw. Ours is still the vague and murky morning of humanity . . . We presume if we think we are those addressed in his will. We are, instead, only a weary renewed version of the court he knew and the days he wore out in blackness." Eiseley turns off his study light, for a moment, and painfully contemplates Bacon's phrase: for the uses of life. We have traveled so far, yet we are lost. Science is leading us further and further from our first world; it is destroying our past and our primordial contact with the natural world as it imposes technological time and a statistical present on us. It is not, however, realizing or discovering the new found land that Bacon and Eiseley think is within its power. Bacon's structure is huge, drafty, and unfinished—misshapen by his standards. 369</page><page sequence="17">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW The new land lies beyond the mountain where science and the "human spirit" have not yet taken us. We have not kept the faith, Eiseley feels ..." 'If you would learn the secrets of nature,' Thoreau insisted, 'you must practice more humanity than others.' " "For the uses of life" At the beginning of this essay I expressed my belief that Loren Eiseley's major books transform biology and give it a new idiom. That is quite a claim, especially for a humanist. Nevertheless, I believe it, and I want to explain what I mean. In The Meaning of Evolution, George Gaylord Simpson speaks about "the new evolution." It differs in kind from organic evolution, for it is peculiar to man and depends largely on his capacities of intelligence, flexibility, individualization, and socialization. New evolution results from organic evolution, and to some extent still depends on it, but it cannot be ex plained by it, except perhaps by analogy. Simpson writes, for example, about the habitually inter breeding groups of organic evolution, and then points out that the new evolution "operates in what may be called habitually inter thinking groups." (my italics) The mutual influences are no longer simply organic; now they are social and cultural. Heredity also is new; no longer simply organic, it has become linguistic or mental—social and cultural. With man's great unique capacities, evolution has become "subject to conscious con trol." Eiseley often speaks of a similar change. With the develop ment of his brain, man became "the dream animal." "Nature was beginning to evade its own limitations in the shape of this strange, dreaming, and observant brain." This "invisible island"—where "man's selfhood . . . [and] future reality" were produced—allows for creative, conscious change, not just instinctive adaptive change. This inner galaxy enables man "to take on the shape of his own dreams" and thereby ex tend himself "beyond visible nature into another and stranger realm." The new evolution seems to be a scientific "fact," and 370</page><page sequence="18">LOREN EISELEY I should think its discovery would require a new biology—not only one that explores organic matter in sophisticated and in genious ways like molecular biology—but one which explores the new and largely unknown dimensions of the new evolu tion. "It is linked with the mysteries within the atom as it is also linked with that intangible, immaterial world of con sciousness." Eiseley does not present himself as an experimental or a research scientist in the conventional sense. He has been that sort of scientist, but some time ago he chose to write mainly about his own "personal universe"—to "report only from my own wilderness"—and so we cannot expect, as he tells us, "science in the usual sense." He has even written his own "obituary" as a "usual" scientist in which he describes three occasions on which he missed, possibly, the big find. He does not know that he did, but the incidents seem to speak for his own estimate of his achievements as a conventional scientist. "I have crawled in many caverns, stooped with infinite ach ing patience over the bones of many men. I have made no great discoveries." He attributes his "failure"—his career as a small bone hunter—to "a life dedicated to the folly of doubt." I prefer to think of his career, as I know it through his books, as a successful life dedicated to life. Francis Bacon was not a personal experimenter, and evidently he made no scientific discoveries in the usual sense. But Eiseley argues that Bacon's "range of vision of what science in its totality meant for man" makes him scientifically important. Eiseley also believes that Bacon's influence on the style of the Royal Society scientists—what I like to think of as their idiom—has scientific significance, too. To deny it, Eiseley suggests, would "deny to the scientist himself any greater role in discovery than the casual assemblage of facts." At first, Eiseley might seem to be describing himself or making an indirect case for his "science," but he is not Francis Bacon nor does he try to be. His recognition, however, that language functioned as Francis Bacon's major scientific instrument is significant. 37 1</page><page sequence="19">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW "Words can sometimes be more penetrating probes into the nature of the universe than any instrument wielded in the laboratory." Eiseley says this about Bacon, and so he means that words can be scientific instruments. No serious person questions the value of sophisticated instruments for science. Without them, science, as we know it, would not exist. Such instruments are the medium of research and discovery. They reveal facts, patterns, shapes, organizations, trends that we could not possibly know otherwise. Language is also a subtle and complex instrument of discovery. It, too, reveals patterns, forms, or designs as the writer—poet or scientist—discovers meanings in the reality he probes. And language is not simply the mode of the poet or the philosopher. Both of course try to perfect it as an instrument. Eiseley himself speaks of the poet's language as sometimes more penetrating than the instruments of the molecular biologist. But language—Eiseley also claims—is an instrument of science. For one thing, words give the scientist a means to explain and interpret research and discoveries, and even here they are not altogether transparent. They are a medium which shapes the scientist's insights and therefore affects his meaning. But Eiseley means even more than that, for words function sometimes as the primary instru ment of the scientist; they become the medium within which the scientist's knowledge and imagination operate in order to discover something of the nature of the universe. Words, I believe, function this way for Loren Eiseley. Words also provide the great nature writers, Eiseley tells us, with a powerful instrument of insight and expression. Sometimes they see more clearly than their scientific contem poraries. Their contributions, however, are different. They add a dimension to science, "something that lies beyond the careful analyses of professional biology." Science requires their sensitivity and insight, for without it "we are half blind . . . we . . . lack pity and tolerance." These nature writers provide, apparently, a kind of synthetic vision. They write about nature and man. They see nature through frankly human eyes and try to express its beauty and meaning for 372</page><page sequence="20">LOREN EISELEY man. In a sense, Eiseley fulfills in his writing the value he sees in these nature writers, and once again, he might be making a case for himself. But I think it is mistaken to regard him simply as a nature writer who values science—when in fact he is a scientist, just as it is mistaken to distinguish sharply between science and art in his case and thereby lose him in some no man's land in the middle. In The Man Who Saw Through Time Eiseley himself dis tinguishes between the scientist and the artist. He is explain ing the way in which great moments of creativity—in both science and art—resemble particle episodes in their unpredic tability and unexpected quality. But even though both scien tist and artist may experience the aesthetic joy of discovery and design, "a substantial difference still remains. For science seeks essentially to naturalize man in the structure of predic table law and conformity, whereas the artist is interested in man the individual." Eiseley believes that a person may be both a scientist and artist, but somehow the two remain separate; their activities do not fuse into a single mode of creative activity. The discoveries of the great artist or of the great scientist give us a "new geography"—a new design for reality which changes our world. But beyond that gross effect, their domains once again sharply differ, for the artist explores the interior—he draws the world and us into himself; whereas the scientist sometimes ventures to "remake reality." The distinction is sound enough. But perhaps in Eiseley's own case the two ventures are not so different as the quotations indicate. I suggest that both the scientist and the artist dis cover and remake reality. The scientist may concentrate on the physical and chemical or organic and physiological con stituents, and the artist may dwell on the emotional and psy chological constituents of reality. But in our time these domains are not always so easy to separate, and sometimes even they may veer too close together for intellectual comfort. It is also true that some forms of science and of art, too, hardly deal with reality at all, and so they do little more than discover and remake themselves. These theoretical questions are 373</page><page sequence="21">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW difficult and complex, and I raise them only to suggest that the distinctions between science and art sometimes are not clear or simple. A biology which concentrates on the new evolution may have difficulty drawing a line between science and something else, for a new biology may have to comprehend all of the forces operative in man's evolution—everything from the organic through the psychological and beyond. "Man's in tellectual, social, and spiritual natures . . . usher in a new phase of evolution ... a new kind ... a product of organic evolution ... no less naturalistic in its essence even though its organization and activities are essentially different from those in the process that brought it into being." (Simpson, 266) Something new is required. Distinctions and fields must blur, unless one believes that everything can be explained by physics and chemistry or by social and pyschological phenomena that have no material or organic base. And we may not know in what ways the blurring will occur, since our awareness of the new evolution is relatively new. A new biology for the new evolution may take many forms, some more systematic and analytic than others, some more personal and contemplative, but perhaps each responsible and knowledgable form will have scientific significance. Eiseley says that science tries to naturalize man in the struc ture of predictability, whereas the artist concentrates on the individual. I believe Eiseley tries to combine science and art as he explains them. He concentrates on the individual and on man within the structure of predictability (and unpre dictability) defined largely by biology. In his writing the systematic activity and structure of science merge with the search for the self within that structure. Science, then, is simultaneously a pursuit of the self and an attempt to make in creasingly closer and closer contact with reality. The personal and universal dimensions of science merge in Eiseley's books, as the quest for knowledge of reality and knowledge of oneself become one. As a professional anthropologist, Eiseley has searched 374</page><page sequence="22">LOREN EISELEY widely for the origins of man. But that search has extended naturally and logically to a search for the origins of himself in the fields and small towns of Nebraska and in the uplands of the ice age. It has widened to a quest for himself as a solitary fugitive from the twentieth century and as one of a lonely and wandering species through time. It has concentrated into a search for his inner self in the dark void and deep spaces within himself and in the evolution of man's brain—"in the windswept uplands of the human mind." Eiseley has reached into the depths of time, of the earth, of life, and of himself—he has classified and contemplated—in search of a more com prehensive science. In The Firmament of Time, he writes " 'The special value of science,' a perceptive philosopher once wrote, 'lies not in what it makes of the world, but what it makes of the knower.' " Loren Eiseley, however, does not reject one for the other. The one—the world—leads into the other—the self—for in one sense the self includes the world or holds some of the answers to it: "Man's quest for certainty is, in the last analysis, a quest for meaning. But the meaning lies buried within himself rather than in the void he has vainly searched for portents since antiquity." For Eiseley, this is what the new evolution requires and means. The value of the scientist's activity and knowledge rests in their value and meaning for the lived life—"for the uses of life." Eiseley speaks directly of this in the final chapter of The Firma ment of Time where he narrates an experience that illuminates the reflexive nature of the scientist's quest. One day, as he is travelling across a barren valley, he comes upon a blacksnake and a hen pheasant locked in a desperate struggle. For a mo ment he watches them "beating each other to death," and then he decides to separate them. The snake coils itself around his arm, and he rides on, while the pheasant returns to its nest. Over the next ridge Eiseley releases the snake. As he reflects on that struggle, he senses that it has meaning for future life. "The bird had contended for birds against the on coming future; the serpent writhing into the bunch grass had 375</page><page sequence="23">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW contended just as desperately for serpents." But "for what had I contended?—I who contained the serpent and the bird and who read the past long written in their bodies." He had con tended for life and for himself, just as he had when he "failed" to make the great discovery. "I had struggled, I am now con vinced, for a greater, more comprehensive version of myself." He had struggled, as well, I am convinced, for a greater, more comprehensive version of science. In a sense, he discovered both on the beaches of Costabel where he encountered the star thrower. He went there without hope, without pity—looking on life with a merciless eye—-seeking shipwreck. "With such an eye, some have said, science looks upon the world. I do not know. I know only that I was the skull of emptiness and the endlessly revolving light without pity." The beaches express his inner desolation, for they are littered with the debris of life. They are a marginal place where life struggles, where it dies, where it seldom sur vives. It is also a place where human predators collect living shellfish. On those beaches man may express love or contempt for nature and for life. In that place and state of mind Eiseley came upon the star thrower, standing in the posture of a god at the foot of the rainbow, throwing starfish far out over the water, back into the sea. Mistaking him momentarily for one of the collectors, Eiseley asked him "Do you collect?" " 'Only like this,' he said softly, gesturing amidst the wreckage of the shore. 'And only for the living.' " The observer and scientist in Eiseley, and the desolate and pitiless man, as well, could not at first take the star thrower seriously. He was mad. His gestures were futile. He was struggling pointlessly in a world where "death is the only . . . collector," where "life always fails." Loren Eiseley's personal and professional heritage had led him to this, to Costabel, and to imminent shipwreck. He remembers, then, his painful, per sonal past—the house where "the long crucifixion of life" had begun. He thinks of his scientific heritage, dominated by two images: Darwin's tangled bank and Freud's mental landscapes—both defining life as a battle of contending forces. 376</page><page sequence="24">LOREN EISELEY He thinks of the heritage that had released forces it could not control—"irrevocable monsters conjured up by a completely amateur sorcerer." He contemplates on a science that had revealed man "in vaporous metamorphic succession as the homeless and unspecified-one" wandering through a con tingent and indeterminable world where there are only il lusions of form and stability—where "life always fails." At the point of shipwreck, Eiseley somehow renounces that heritage, throws off his despair, and declares his love for the world. For science had also shown him that although life may fail and form be illusory, life persists and diverts itself into new forms. Science may have revealed that man himself, like the universe, is "a tale of desolations," but that has given him the freedom to choose. And the star thrower has shown him the way to transcend the tangled bank and to escape his scientific heritage. "From Darwin's tangled bank of unceasing struggle, selfishness, and death, had arisen, incomprehensibly, the thrower who loved not man, but life." So Loren Eiseley returns to the beach and joins the star thrower in his deliberate and joyful task in which they seek to save man as well as starfish. On the beaches of Costabel the scientist discovered a greater self and he also became aware of a greater and more comprehensive version of science, for he understands now the meaning of Francis Bacon's words—"for the uses of life." 377</page></plain_text>
