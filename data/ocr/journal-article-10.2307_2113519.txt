<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Statistical Study of French Crises T WO major themes have been developed by Ernest Labrousse in his well-known works on prices and income.' One, a reinterpre- tation of the origins of the French Revolution, does not concern us here. The other, a theory of an agriculturally determined business cycle, has recently been confirmed for the early nineteenth century by a young historian and student of Labrousse, M. A. Chabert, and forms the subject of this paper.' Chabert's first work offered time series of French prices from i798 to i820, a hitherto neglected interval falling between the monetary anarchy of the assignats and the period covered by the tables of the Bureau de la Statistique Generale.' He has followed this with a more ambitious effort, a general study of the social and economic development of France during the same years, as reflected in the price series already presented and other data assembled since.4 Now quantitative economic history, especially that aspect of it which studies prices and wages, is by its very nature an imposing subject. To begin with, it is a rather esoteric field. The special skills and infinite pains required to examine interminable series of dusty documents, locating, assembling, testing, and comparing myriads of numbers, and then so to manipulate these numbers that they yield consistent measures of the market value of articles of uniform quantity and quality over long periods of time, demand rare talents and still rarer means. There are few branches of research where so much responsibility rests on the scholar, for since there are few men who would care to repeat ten years of work simply to check its accuracy, he is usually the only guarantee of his own data. Furthermore, this purely practical consideration is reinforced by 1 C. E. Labrousse, Esquisse du movement des prix et des revenus en France au XVIIIP si~cle (Paris: Dalloz, 1932); La Crise de l'6conomie franfaise a' la fin de l'Ancien Regime et ou debut de la Revolution (Paris: Presses universitaires, I944). 2 The present article does not purport to be a review of Labrousse's works, one of which, the Crise, is already well known to the readers of THE JOURNAL through Professor Clough's article on "The Crisis in French Economy at the Beginning of the Revolution," THE JOURNAL OF EcoNoMIc HIsTORY, VI (1946), pp. I9I-96. The recent publication of Chabertes studies, however, provides a worth-while occasion to reconsider the whole thesis and method of the two authors. 8 M. A.

Modern man is reassured by numbers, which possess a quality of precision and certainty that mere words cannot give. Their mathematical character discourages criticism.' It is these considerations, no doubt, plus the effectiveness of his style, that explain much of the rather automatic acceptance of Labrousse's findings ever since their presentation in I932. At any rate, except for some disagreement over the validity of his data, stemming from the coincidentally contemporaneous publication of Henri Hauser's Recherches et documents sur l'histoire des prix en France de i500 a i800,6 his general conclusions have made their way more or less unquestioned into the corpus of French historiography. And yet the thesis presented by Labrousse was by no means the sort to be taken for granted. If anything, it was rather in contra- diction with what economic theory and general economic history might have led one to expect. Briefly, it offered the following theory of the business cycle in eighteenth-century France: i. A bad harvest drives up the price of cereals. 2. For most farmers, the fall in the volume available for market outweighs the gain in price, so that all but the wealthiest suffer a loss in income. This decline in rural revenues, which is roughly pro- portional to the rise in price, is accentuated by farm unemployment due to smaller crops. 3. Since the rural population forms the great majority of the entire nation, the over-all market for industrial goods slumps. 4. The slump is aggravated by the impact of high food prices on the expenditures of the poorer classes in the cities. 5. Businesses everywhere retrench. The price and output of manu- factured articles fall off. Employment drops, intensifying the difficulty. 6. The situation returns to normal when good harvests and lower grain prices restore the incomes of the mass of the population. This, according to Labrousse, is the dominant cyclical pattern of the "exchange economy of the old type, essentially characterized by the high cost of transport, the predominance of the rural sector, 5 Cf.

I, which lists all the pertinent references.</page><page sequence="3">Statistical Study of French Crises 197 the general inelasticity of production, and the enormous place of bread in the popular budget." 7 II The argument stands or falls, of course, on propositions 2 and 3. The first of these-that the fall in the volume available for market outweighs the gain in price-is surprising on the face of it. In view of the extreme inelasticity of the demand for grain in a time when 50 per cent of the popular budget went for bread, a small decrease in supply would cause a relatively large rise in price.' In such a case, there is no doubt that the farm sector as a unit gained. To be sure, Labrousse offers a persuasively detailed picture of the unfavorable consequences, even for the farmer, of an acute shortage of cereals.9 And while the colors employed are unduly and systemati- cally somber, it is quite evident that a disastrous harvest, with all that it implied in the way of hunger and unrest, was quite capable of crippling every sector of the economic life of the nation. It is one thing, however, to show that famine or near famine could have this effect, and another to prove an inverse proportional relationship between farm prices and farm income.10 This transition, which is crucial to the argument, is one of the weakest points of Labrousse's treatment. So far as wage earners, includ- ing landless farm laborers, are concerned, the reader is left to infer that, as consumers of cereals, they lost real income with every increase in prices. While this may have been true in a rough sort of way, 7 Labrousse, Crise, p. I73. Chabert's theoretical formulation follows that of Labrousse to the letter: "The analysis . . . has been done for the eighteenth century in a manner as illuminating as it is complete by C. E. Labrousse. To add anything would be superfluous L'Activite economique, p. 200. 8 Labrousse, Esquisse, pp. 582-95. Labrousse studies the case of a "typical" farm laborer, married and a father of three. The examples given show this to be a modest estimate of the percentage involved. Note in this connection, the phenomenon known as Giffen's Paradox, which points out that in the case of inferior goods such as bread, a rise in prices may actually increase demand. Cf. A. Marshall, Principles of Economics (8th ed.; London: The Macmillan Co., I920), p. 132. 9Ibid., pp. 4I7-42, 5I3-41- 10In the Esquisse, the body of the analysis bears on the situation created by harvests at their lowest and grain prices at their highest extreme, as exemplified by the crises of I770 and i789. But the treatment of industrial activity (ibid., pp. 543-67) and such explicit state. ments as: "The crisis is, as we know, of agricultural origin and proportional to the fall in productivity and the rise in prices" (p. 528), make the author's position clear.</page><page sequence="4">198 David S. Landes the flexibilities of the economy complicated the tendency." As for the farmers themselves, the argument is that (i), since the vast majority did not have enough land, either as owners or tenants, to subsist and were compelled to eke out their income as laborers, out- workers, or shopkeepers, they also fall into the category of consumers of grain; and (2) of those farmers who normally produced a surplus for market, only a few fortunates, cultivating large plots of fertile soil, could profit from the inelastic demand and raise their profits as crops decreased. The first represents at best an assumption. Actually, we have only an approximate notion of the distribution of land and the economic independence of the peasant in eighteenth-century France. Early authorities, notably Loutchisky, stressed the absence of direct farming by the few large landholders and consequently an almost universal cultivation by a peasantry that comprised large prosperous elements.'2 Later students of the question, however, have maintained that the smallness of parcels made the majority of farmers dependent on supple- mentary sources of income.'3 There is some truth in each of these interpretations. The important thing to remember is that the latter thesis can be pushed only so far. On the one hand, the openings for farm labor were restricted by the very fragmentation of property that presumably compelled the peasant to seek such livelihood. On the other, the possibilities of earning a living in nonfarm industrial or commercial occupations were limited by the very character of the French economy, which was overwhelmingly agricultural and based largely on regional self-sufficiency. This position, if overstated, can easily lead ad absurdum. The second point-that only the wealthiest landowners would profit 11 Among such complicating factors, note especially the frequent payment of wages in kind and the poor correlation between the price of bread, which was often fixed, and that of grain. The latter consideration, which is of prime importance for the urban proletariat, is not discussed in either the Esquisse or the Crise. Cf. G. Lefebvre, "Le mouvement des prix et les origines de la Revolution fransaise," Annales d'histoire economique et sociale, IX (1937), x6of. 12 Cf. J. Loutchisky, La petite propriete en France avant la Revolution et la vented des biens nationaux (Paris: Champion, I897); L'Etat des classes agricoles en France a la veille de la Revolution (Paris: Champion, igii). 135The best summary of the question is to be found in the work of G. Lefebvre, "Les Recherches relatives a la repartition de la propri&amp;te et de exploitation foncieres d la fin de l'Ancien Regime," Revue d'histoire moderne III (I928), I03-30; "Les Etudes relatives N la vente des biens nationaux," ibid., pp. i88-2I9; "La R6volution fransaise et les paysans," Cahiers de la Revolution franfaise, I (1934) 7-49 (the same article appeared in the Annales historiques de la Revolution franfaise X (I933), 97-I28).</page><page sequence="5">Statistical Study of French Crises as output fell and prices rose-is based on the argument that fixed costs in kind for food, seed, and other necessities ate up so much of the harvest in most cases that the effect of a decline in total yield on the amount of surplus available for market was multiplied prodi- giously, nullifying and counterbalancing the increase in prices.'4 From a theoretical point of view, the fact that fixed costs in kind will accentuate a fall in output per acre is obvious enough. But this proves nothing about a proportional inverse relationship between pro- ductivity and income. It merely shows that, as yield declines, those marginal farms whose proportion of fixed costs to total output is highest will be the first to reach the point of diminishing profits. In graphic terms, with prices on the X axis and profits on the Y axis, the curve of net income is a sort of rough parabola, with profits increasing up to a certain point as prices rise, and then falling as the rate of decrease of the marketable surplus overtakes the rate of increase of prices.'5 How much output must drop depends in each case on the rate of the compensatory price rise and the level of fixed costs. Unfortu- nately, that is just the sort of information no one can give us for eighteenth-century France. On the one hand, the lack of figures on production makes it impossible to establish demand and price schedules for different types of grain. On the other, the same lack, combined with our ignorance of the precise distribution of land from the stand- point of population, tenure, and quality of soil, makes any effort to establish ratios of fixed costs to productivity almost hopeless. Nevertheless, this purely theoretical relationship between fixed costs and farm income does shed valuable light on the link between the harvest and the demand for industrial products: proposition three of Labrousse's analysis. For if, owing to the inelasticity of demand, the farm sector as a unit always gains as productivity falls, and if, as has been shown, this decline gradually pushes successive groups of 14 To illustrate the process, Labrousse offers three tables of the yields, costs, gross income, and net income of hypothetical parcels of poor and rich soil for the years I774-I789. Unfortu- nately, the results do not, even in the case of poor land, show any uniform correlation among the variables. Esquisse, pp. 406, 409, 4II. It is hard to say whether these tables are meant to be empirical or merely theoretical. Labrousse goes to considerable trouble to use figures based on reality, but then turns around and postulates identical yields for poor and rich soil. 15 Actually, in the strict mathematical sense, there is no such thing as a "rough" parabola, which is by definition symmetrical. But for purposes of description it seems the best way to designate a curve which rises at first and then turns and falls, without resorting to clumsy, if exact, circumlocutions,</page><page sequence="6">200 David S. Landes individual producers beyond the point of diminishing profits, we have in effect an increasing concentration of income varying directly with price in the hands of the wealthier members of the farm and landed community. And while it is impossible to state with precision the effects of such a situation on the market for manufactured goods at specific price levels, one thing is highly probable: the relationship between price, hence concentration of income, and consumption is not a simple inverse one. Instead, it is more reasonable to assume that increases in farm prices up to a certain point encouraged the demand for textiles and similar articles by diverting income from the poorest groups to the more well-to-do. The workers, agricultural laborers, and part-time peasants had never, despite their numbers, furnished much of a market for such products. For many, life was an unceasing struggle for mere subsistence, with almost all available resources going for nourishment. Such manufactured articles as were purchased had to and did last a lifetime. And while, under the pressure of higher food prices, they unquestionably reduced or even eliminated expenditures for these commodities, the margin of compression could not, in the last analysis, have been very large. Most of the slack was taken up by tightening belts, in other words, by the reduction of an already low standard of living. Conversely, an increase in real income due to lower food prices was probably translated by those living on or below the margin of subsistence into a greater consumption of bread and other aliments, rather than of manufactured goods. Everything we know of the mentality of the eighteenth-century worker or peasant and the dura- bility of the clothes on his back would indicate the relative neutrality of this market as a cyclical factor in industrial prosperity. A shift of income from this group to those of the rural population whose fortune customarily permitted a certain expenditure for manu- factured articles can only have benefited industry by increasing the amount of money theoretically available for nonfood expenditures. To be sure, concentration, if carried too far, meant a progressive diversion of income from immediate consumption of industrial prod- ucts-propensity to consume must necessarily have lagged behind ability to consume-with unfortunate consequences to the expectations and, hence, activity of certain branches of the economy. In this regard, hoarding, always important in the French countryside, was especially to be feared. But the rate of hoarding was probably not great at first. Only as output declined more and more and windfall profits fell to</page><page sequence="7">Statistical Study of French Crises 201 an ever smaller number of hands, would the desire of the speculator to hide his good fortune from tax collectors and neighbors eliminate entirely the impulse toward greater consumption, reinforcing the effect of excessive concentration itself. In short, if all elements extraneous to the income-demand structure are eliminated for the sake of analysis, the relationship discovered is not one of inverse proportionality, but rather again a sort of parabola, demand for manufactured goods rising with grain prices until a certain point and then falling off to the crisis level so vividly described by Labrousse.16 III So much for the theoretical aspects of the problem. What of empirical reality? To what extent does the analysis of Labrousse-and that of Chabert-accord with the facts? And even before that, what of the facts themselves? In this connection, since the work of both men is based on a quantitative approach to economic and social history, it might be useful to suggest certain criteria for the proper employment of this approach and examine the technique and conclusions of the volumes in the light of these standards. Obviously these criteria are not meant to be complete, but are chosen simply for their suitability as bases of analysis and judgment. From this standpoint, the following considerations would seem both reasonable and relevant: i. Any effort at quantification assumes the existence of raw data of some accuracy. 2. While the degree of accuracy need not be perfect, further manipu- lation of the crude figures is limited accordingly. 3. Quantification implies in itself the use of inductive reasoning. At all times, preconceived hypotheses, however invitingly logical and useful, must be sacrificed when contradicted by the cold figures. Seen against these standards, both writers fall short, though there is a world of difference between the work of the master and that of 16 Economic theorists have always been divided on the relationship of harvests to the business cycle, some arguing that good harvests promote industrial prosperity, others main- taining the contrary. The apparent contradiction is explained, at least in part, by the relative suitability of the two hypotheses to different types of economies. The former seems more applicable to a highly urbanized industrial nation-modern England is a good example; the latter seems to satisfy better the conditions of a rural society. In both cases, however, the harvest seems to exercise its effect on the economy as a whole through mixed, conflicting forces. On the difficulties and uncertainties of this problem and the precarious balance of the factors involved, see G. Haberler, Prosperity and Depression (3d ed.; New York: United Nations, 1946), pp. 15i-64, esp. p. i64.</page><page sequence="8">202 David S. Landes the pupil. Take the first standard, the reliability of the statistical data employed. From a purely general standpoint, the student of French economic history who attempts to use such material has two strikes on him from the start. Whatever the period covered, and excepting only such overt phenomena as prices and population, all numerical measurements of production, income, or costs are of a highly subjective and dubious nature. To begin with, almost all such measurements are of an official character, and there have been few eras in world history when officials have not had one or another axe to grind, axes that tend to change with the notoriously fickle fortunes of politics and personal intrigue." Furthermore, these official figures are generally based on and ulti- mately derive from the co-operation of the citizenry. Thus most French statistics on industrial production rest essentially on the reports of manufacturers for taxation or other purposes. Those of the eighteenth century are based on the stocks presented by industrialists for the approval of visiting inspectors. Unfortunately, whenever his pocket- book is involved, the attitude of the Frenchman toward his govern- ment has always been but little short of overt hostility. For the vast majority, the feeling has usually been that taxation is simply a legiti- mate form of robbery, to be evaded whenever prospective returns balance the risks. As a result, official inquiry into such matters has rarely been greeted with the truth, and, to the average citizen, the most disinterested government efforts have always been presumed to conceal ulterior fiscal motives. Add to this the fact that in France wealth has been more often something to hide than to show, and that no businessman or farmer worth his salt would ever admit to making money, and you have a situation where records of output, income, and so forth are frequently worse than useless."8 17 This was especially true in the past, when the respect for numbers and the standards of professional objectivity were not so highly developed as now. For one example of the use, or rather abuse, of official statistics for purposes of propaganda, see S. Charlety's critique of the records of the French customs under the Restoration. Charlety, La Restoauration, edited by E. Lavisse in the Histoire de France contemporaine series (Paris: Hachette, I92I), IV, 288f. 18 If the private archives I have examined are any indication, the French businessman has not only been an indefatigable fabricator so far as his government is concerned, but rarely can bring himself to set down the truth in his own personal records. The oft-repeated story of firms with two or three sets of books is no exaggeration. Whether the data are to be found in formal registers or oral deposition, the French entrepreneur has generally had three versions of his business, one for the state and other outsiders, one for the family, and one for himself. So far as the family is concerned, the old saw is to the point: "BVn~fces connus, infants perdus."</page><page sequence="9">Statistical Study of French Crises 203 It would be unfair to imply that either Labrousse or Chabert was not aware of this major difficulty in the employment of French statis- tics. Both warn the reader of the problem now and then, but both, particularly the latter, show an unfortunate tendency to turn right about and disregard their own warnings. And whereas Labrousse, who is primarily interested in movement and relative values, recognizes fraud for what it is but feels that, like error, it will remain constant over time or average out statistically, Chabert shows a deplorable readiness to accept the most questionable data for their own sake. It is hard to see how a historian could give any credence to official reports on the wealth and income of French businessmen, based in large part on the declarations of the people concerned, simply because this information had been requested by Napoleon.'" Labrousse's position on this point is worthy of special attention. In 1932 when he wrote the Esquisse, he pointed to the "dangerously approximative character" of the official reports of the harvest.20 Since at that time he was concerned only with prices, this shortcoming did not raise any serious difficulty.2' Ten years later, however, a recon- sideration of the problem had apparently changed his mind on this score. After clearly demonstrating in an extended analysis the inability of these summary estimates to furnish even the crudest hint of reality,22 19 "It is thus evident that the responsibility of the prefects was engaged . . and that they would hesitate to make inexact statements . Chabert, L'Activite economique, p. 334. See, for other examples of this naivete, pp. i83f. and 206. On the "responsibility" of Napoleon's officials, it may help to recall the following passage from Chaptal: "He [Napoleon] sometimes ordered the impossible and wanted to be served on the spot. He asked for reports which would have required several weeks' work to be exact, and he wanted them right away because his needs would not wait. If one restricted himself to offering him preliminary sketches, he was displeased. It was better to lie with audacity than to delay in order to give him the truth. I have seen him show a great predilection for Regnaud de Saint-Jean d'Angely because he boldly answered all his questions and would not have been embarrassed had he asked him how many millions of flies there were in Europe in the month of August. It is on such tainted bases that on several occasions were set up the factory report, that of agriculture, etc., and it is according to these that France was assigned several billions of francs of commerce and industry in the most calamitous times." J. A. Chaptal, Mes souvenirs sur Napoleon (Paris, I893), p. 354f. 20 Labrousse, Esquisse, p. i9, n. 40. 21. Ibid., p. i9. "The reports of prices, which alone interest us here . 22 Labrousse, Crise, pp. 62-97. Labrousse discusses in detail the following shortcomings of these etats de recoltes: (i) they are prepared not in absolute figures, however approximate, but in multiples of a so-called "ordinary year" for the district concerned; (2) the reports are submitted at different times in different districts, beginning in the middle of August until November; (3) even when prepared late, they are based at best on the appearances of the mowing and some of the early threshing; (4) the officials charged with making these reports are forced to depend on the usual uncooperative and mendacious sources; (5) the information so obtained is further distorted at the hands of the government bureaucracy.</page><page sequence="10">204 David S. Landes he comes to the remarkable conclusion-on the assumption that the errors balance out and that the bias attributable to the systematic fraud of all concerned remains uniform over time-that they provide a reliable index of the movement of agricultural production. This is confirmed, he feels, by the inverse correlation of the harvest and the price of grains, by the parallel shifts in the annual yields of different cereals, and by the plausibility of the amplitude in the fluctuations of these yields as so described.23 And Labrousse confidently sums up: "An absolute evaluation of the harvest will be possible." 24 Labrousse makes a similar decision with respect to the official sta- tistics of industrial output. Here the problem is analogous: How much credence can be given to figures based on manufacturers' declarations or on the amounts of finished goods presented for examination and approval by government inspectors? It is impossible to estimate the degree of fraud, but it was obviously important, especially after I762 when the decree permitting the production of all types of cloth in rural districts increased the possibilities of evasion. Nevertheless, on the same assumptions as for the estimates of the harvest, Labrousse feels that these statistics, if not of absolute value, provide reliable indicators of the movement of manufacture. Of course, in statistics as in so many other things, everything depends on the use made of the materials at hand-the second of the criteria listed above. Even the poorest of crude numbers often possess some interest as such. The essential thing is not to place a greater burden on them than they are capable of supporting. In this respect, Chabert's work is at times inexcusably weak: To build an index of salary changes for the whole of France on twenty- six series of spotty reliability is dubious enough;"26 to base on this 28 Even if this were actually so, it would be no more than circular reasoning, for that is exactly what one might expect of estimates based on vague general opinion, itself derived from the trend of prices and other appearances. In point of fact, a comparison of harvest and grain prices during the fifteen years preceding i 789 shows a most unsatisfactory inverse correlation. Indeed, Labrousse makes it clear in his Esquisse, p. 392, that the correlation announced in his Crise, p. 88, is not to be expected. 24Labrousse, Crise, p. 88. "Absolute," of course, is not meant in the quantitative sense. Labrousse simply means that by using official estimates as index numbers, it would be possible to assign specific amplitudes to the movements so obtained, to say, for example, that in one year production rose i5 per cent and in another fell 25 per cent. 25 Labrousse, Esquisse, pp. 5o4f. and 545. 26 Fourteen of building workers in Paris, six of domestics in the provinces, one, incomplete, of an agricultural laborer, one of the same value of a textile worker, and the rest nondescript and miscellaneous, so much so that the reader finds it impossible to make Chabert's description of his series accord with the figure of twenty-six given in the text. L'Activit6 1conomique, pp. I 82-83.</page><page sequence="11">Statistical Study of French Crises 205 index all sorts of calculations of changes in real and nominal wages, with some of the percentages carried to two decimal places, is statistical hocus-pocus.27 Labrousse is not guilty of this sort of thing. But he is interested in using his indexes of prices and production to one end in particular, the demonstration of a cyclical pattern of economic behavior, and, in order to do this, he is forced to make one fundamental assumption: that the bias due to fraud by farmers and businessmen is uniform over time. This is a hazardous assumption. In the case of the farmer, the year of a poor harvest, when grain prices have risen sky-high and everyone who possibly can is speculating and hoarding, when, on the one hand, there is a small fortune to be made by a shrewd coup and, on the other, the government is everywhere on the hunt for supplies and the populace is restive with hunger and inflamed with hate of the accapareurs, such is the year when silence is more golden than ever and every effort must be made to conceal the size of the crop.28 Under the circumstances, the pessimism of the official esti- mates was exaggerated in lean years, distorting to a significant degree the amplitude of the cyclical fluctuations. Yet, as has already been shown,29 the extent of the fall in the yield of farm products is one of the keystones of the entire theoretical position. The situation is the same for manufactured goods. For one thing, the traditional pessimism of the French businessman has always increased geometrically with hard times-if he cried loud and long enough, who knew what measures the government might be per- suaded to take? Still more important, it has always been more or less the rule in French industry to meet falling profits by first adulterating or otherwise changing the product.0 But, in the eighteenth 27 Ibid., pp. 177-203, 227-28. The index of farm rents is not much stronger: ibid., pp. 60-70, 95-I I8.

I; p. 3I5. 28 The following passage from an anonymous pamphlet of the Restoration, describing the situation in just such a year, is relevant despite the difference in time: "But there was no lack of wheat; the farmers left it on the stalk so that, in case of a survey, it would be impossible to say what they possessed."

Obviously, this practice has never been universal, and many of France's oldest firms are rightfully proud of</page><page sequence="12">2o6 David S. Landes century, the regulations of manufacture made most such measures illegal. In time of depression, therefore, the perennial conflict between producer and inspector was greatly intensified, and the usual down- ward bias of statistics of output was markedly accentuated.3 IV Suppose we grant, however, that this distortion of the cyclical pat- tern of production, both agricultural and industrial, is not such as to vitiate the direction of the movement unduly, that, while the amplitude may be exaggerated, the curve so obtained nevertheless gives an approximate picture of the alternation of expansion and contraction. Let us accept, in other words, the graphs offered by both Labrousse and Chabert and see how much the deductive analysis of the cycle conforms to the inductive reality of their date, the third criterion mentioned above. These graphs are all of the same type, a comparison between the price of grain and some index of industrial activity,32 and are offered as evidence of the inverse relationship between these two primary branches of economic activity during this period. It is obviously impos- sible in the short space of this paper to examine each of these in detail and to verify the interpretation. Yet even a cursory study an impeccable reputation for quality. Unfortunately, in times of crisis, the deviation of a few has generally been sufficient to make even those manufacturers with the best intentions follow suit. 81 Moreover, the relative quantity of industrial products presented for government inspection was, particularly after 1762, a function of the activity of rural industry, which paid little heed, if any, to regulations. On the one hand, merchants found it highly profitable to buy at lower prices in the country, especially in times of falling demand, provoking or accentuating the contraction of regulated urban industry. On the other hand, this competition compelled the latter to by-pass or violate regulations in an effort to cut costs, further reducing the articles presented for official approval. Cf. E. Tarl6, L'Industrie dans les campagnes en France a' la fin de lAncien Regime (Paris: E. Cornely, i910), chap. iii. The fact that Labrousse's data necessarily bear primarily on the regulated urban industries that produced in large part for the wealthier classes and shed little light on fluctuations in the rural manufactures that supplied much of the country population, creates an unfortunate gap in the cyclical sequence which can be filled only inferentially. See above, pp. 200-2. 82 Labrousse offers ten of these graphs, three comparing grain prices with the prices of manufactured goods, five with the output of such goods, one with the price of a raw material, wool, and one with the wage level.-Esquisse, pp. 3i6, 326, 35I, 548, 557, 562, 566; Crise, pp. 177, x78, 879. Chabert gives seven, three comparing grain prices with grain output, two with output and employment, one with the volume of sales at the great fairs of Beaucaire, and one contrasting the Continental price index of cereals as established by Beveridge with French exports of textiles and manufactured products in general: L'Activitl e~conomique, pp. 204, 205, 2o6, 207, 208, 209, 211.</page><page sequence="13">Statistical Study of French Crises 207 reveals that in no case is the correlation as clear-cut as both authors would like to make it, and in many cases the facts contradict the conclusions. In the work of Chabert, the contradiction is sometimes flagrant. Note, for example, the cotton industry of the Seine-Inferieure, which made a spectacular recovery from the crisis of i8io-i8ii in the face of the disastrous harvest of I8I2.33 Even more serious is his general conclusion that the agriculturally determined business cycle as described by Labrousse for the eighteenth century holds good for the first half of the nineteenth "4-this despite the fact that only one of the four major depressions of the years he covers can possibly be so described.8" Labrousse is far more careful in his analysis of specific cases.86 But there is a certain pragmatic adjustment of the interpretation to fit the exigencies of the individual graph. If a steady rise of industrial activity in the face of rising wheat prices is to be accounted for by the relatively low food prices of the preceding period, then it is only fair to expect the persistence of high food prices to have the opposite effect.37 And if a delay in the reaction of wool manufacturers at Elbeuf to the spectacular leap of wheat prices in 1756-1757 is to be explained by the lag between orders and delivery of wool from Spain, one should find evidences of this lag at other breaks in the curve.38 Moreover, certain of Labrousse's graphs are in marked conflict with the cyclical pattern proposed. Thus the price of linen cloth bears no relationship whatsoever to that of grain iron shows a similar indifference.40 Te prices of both woolen yarn and cloth seem either unaffected by those of cereals, or actually tend to vary in the same direction.4' To be sure, price is at best only a reflection of industrial 38 Chabert, L'Activite' &amp;onomique, graph 4, B, p. 205. The graph is headed: "Inverse rela- tionship (contrari!t6 tendancielle) between the movement of the price of wheat and industrial activity." 34Ibid., pp. 213, 220. 85 Ibid., that of 1817.

Landes prosperity, and a perfect inverse correlation was not therefore to be expected. On the other hand, prices represent by far the most reliable data that Labrousse has to offer, and their derivative character will not suffice to explain the purely negative results obtained. Nor is this inconsistency surprising. As has already been seen, a theoretical analysis of the problem shows not an inversely proportional correlation between grain prices and industrial activity but rather a mixed relationship. Ceteris paribus, there was undoubtedly within the income-demand structure itself a whole range in which the flexibilities of the equation allowed the respective variables to move without affecting the final result. Thus, with respect to the effect of fixed costs on net farm income,42 the collection of dues and rents was by no means so rigorous throughout most of the eighteenth century as Labrousse's analysis might lead one to believe. Nor was the expense of seed on sharecroppers' land borne solely by the tenant. Above all, as has already been pointed out, there was no regular correlation between crop yields and grain prices.43 And yet a consistent link between short harvests and high prices is the indispensable core of the mechanism described by the authors. Nor is this all. In actual experience the mechanism of the cycle was far more complicated, and depended to a large extent on such things as government policy, war, the situation of foreign markets, tariff legislation, and fashion, not to mention factors inherent in the productive process.44 In the presence of such external elements- external, that is, to the income-demand structure-the theoretical and actual points of decreasing consumption and business activity must have frequently diverged.45 The uncertainty of the whole relationship is readily apparent. 42See above, p. ig9f. 43 See above, n. 23. Also Esquisse, pp. 398, n. 3I; 399, 400. 44 Thus, even in the case of Labrousse's crisis, such considerations as the unrest and insecurity of famine years (see above, p. I97) and the voluntary abandonment of work by many peasant outworkers, unable to feed their families on normal wages, must not be underestimated. Cf. G. Lefebvre, La grande peer de 1789 (Paris: A. Colin, 1932), pp. s5ff.; also Labrousse, Esquisse, p. 536, and Chabert, L'Activiti e6conomique, p. 202. 45 It is interesting to note, however, that in one or two cases the graphs of the Esquisse would seem to lend some support to the hypothesis of a parabolic income-demand curve, artificially analytical as it is. Cf. graphs 39 and 40 (pp. 548, 557), where industrial activity seems to prosper or more than hold its own in the face of rising grain prices, only to fall when the increase becomes excessive. In view of the unreliability of the statistics, little more than a coincidental value attaches to such evidence.</page><page sequence="15">Statistical Study of French Crises 209 V In the course of analyzing the theoretical assumptions of Labrousse and Chabert and examining their data, this paper has offered a dual hypothesis of the effect of harvest fluctuations on the economy of eighteenth-century France: First, that the effect was not simple and direct, but rather contradictory, with conflicting forces tending, as grain prices rose, to encourage industry at first, and then, as the balance shifted, to create depression; and, second, that owing to this see-saw effect, there was a whole middle range in which the variables more or less cancelled out, limiting accordingly the influence of the harvest on the business cycle. In offering this hypothesis, however, our intention has been not so much to substitute one dogmatic posi- tion for another as to indicate the complexity of the question and to suggest a more cautious, pluralistic approach to the economic history of the period. The problem of the business cycle is difficult enough in the twentieth century, when we have the most extensive and detailed figures at our fingertips. It is even more so for the student of the eighteenth century, whose sources simply will not permit more than some highly refined deduction. In the light of the above, it does not seem superfluous to conclude with the traditional, almost banal, warnings against the pitfalls of quantitative, and especially price, history. Both writers, in spite of their readiness to include nonquantitative and noneconomic factors in their analysis of particular historical phenomena, nevertheless inter- pret economic growth in mechanistic price terms. In this regard, Labrousse is explicit in adopting a position close to that of his predecessor and exemplar, Fransois Simiand, who attributed the rate and nature of such growth to secular price cycles.4" Chabert follows suit by implication.47 Any criticism of this general theoretical position would exceed the scope of this paper.48 It has been mentioned, however, because it 40 Crise, pp. xvi-xxii.

For those interested in attempting the difficult style of Simiand himself, the latter's major work should be cited: Le Salaire, evolution social et la monnaie (3 vols.; Paris: Alcan, 1932). 47Chabert, L'Activite' economique, pp. iI, 200. 48 Let it suffice to refer on this score to the judgment of the late Joseph Schumpeter, Business Cycles (2 Vols.; New York: McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc., 1939), II, 564, n. I.</page><page sequence="16">210 David S. Landes seems probable that this larger approach lies at the root of the inter- pretation of the business cycle criticized above. It has led both writers to place more weight on the documents than they can support, to create time series and indexes when the crude data will not permit such refinements and, finally, to adapt the results so obtained to a preconceived, mechanistic theory. For, despite protestations to the contrary,49 that is what the argu- ments of both writers boil down to, the subordination of all human elements of cyclical change to a more or less consistent income-demand schedule created by and proportional to fluctuations in the harvest; in short, the implication that, in the economy that prevailed up to i848, it was the harvest that made the cycle. As Labrousse puts it: This reconstruction of the mechanism of the depression, which explains roughly the essential of all depressions of the old type, is not irrelevant to economic history, political history, or biographical history. It leads, in effect, to excusing governments of the principal responsibilities, to the substitution of a natural causation for an anthropomorphic causation. Not that human action is irrelevant, not that a government is completely disarmed, even in a liberal economy, in the face of economic catastrophe, nor is it always completely innocent. The voluntary, the deliberate is nevertheless only an accessory factor here. The his- torian, who does not neglect any aspect of reality, undoubtedly cannot ignore it. But in the search for causes, the essential lies elsewhere.50 Unfortunately, the thesis does not work out. And this is especially unfortunate in view of the remarkable possibilities of the quantitative approach when properly employed.5" Statistics, when valid, are prob- ably the sharpest tool in the kit of the social scientist, indeed, one of his strongest assets in the effort to make the social disciplines scientific. But for one thing, figures are only symptoms of a particu- 49 Labrousse specifically warns at one point (Esquisse, p. 554) "against the simple notion of a mechanical, immediate, and exclusive action of the price of grains on the activity of the textile industry." He also attempts to indicate the complications created by the human factor, by the fact that grain prices are in themselves only a barometer, a warning that must be translated into action by the hesitant, vacillating decision of the average entrepreneur. But this personal element is conceived only as a cause of delay, the eventual reaction being fixed by the mechanism described above.
