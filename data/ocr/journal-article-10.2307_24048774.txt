A small object is visi ble in the left hand. The second large-scale male figure is somewhat smaller than the first. He wears a long, broad, ankle-length cloak lined in black, ornamented with a finely executed geometric pattern (?). One can see the hem of a tunic bordered by a strip of a different fabric on this rather elaborate costume. The lower portion of the figure has been badly damaged by soot, so that only its contours are vis ible, but the tunic appears to be slightly broader at the lower edge. Over the tunic, there is a light colored coat of plate armor, slightly more than thigh-length, on which square plates fastened with black cords may be seen. At the lower edge of the armor there is a strip of a darker color. The tunic is wider than the plate armor and emerges from beneath it in folds. As on the other figures, the sleeves are narrow. The cuffs are shown ex actly as they are on the first figure. Over each sleeve, above the elbow, one can see either the sleeve of another garment or a shoulder-piece that is constructed of black cloth decorated with black squares (probably damask). Along the edge is a narrow strip of light-colored fabric. Around his waist, the figure wears a belt fas tened with a buckle consisting of two identical 191</page><page sequence="6">marshak and raspopova: Worshipers from Temple II, Panjikent Fig. 8, above left.

Identification of the Figures on the Northern Wall Vashagn/Verethragna and the Trophy The battle dress of the second male figure in the northern wall mural (who may be assumed to be Vashagn, the Sogdian Verethragna) indicates that the anthropomorphic monster with the gro tesquely large head shown at his feet cannot be interpreted as a mask that he might wear. It is more probable that the monster is a theatrical Fig. 12. Detail of Samarkand ossuary. representation of a conquered demon, a trophy taken in battle.

Sarmarkand. Terra-cotta icon. instrument such as a cithara or lyre. This also explains the small object in the figure's left hand, which must be a plectrum.24 Sogdian terra-cottas yield additional evidence. Three variants of miniature terra-cotta icons de pict the figure of a ruler holding a cithara or lyre. The fragments of two such small icons, traceable to a single initial mold, were found in a sixth century stratum at Panjikent, where miniature icons are generally characteristic of this period (figs. 14, 15).25 An arch with a finial in the shape of a sphere and crescent holds the figure of a deity shown with flames above his shoulders. The god wears a winged royal crown from which issues a long, wavy ribbon and on his shoulders is a cloak fastened at the chest with a fibula. Al though the lower part of the composition is lost, the arrangement of the folds of the figure's clo thing indicates that he was shown seated and that his garments, as in the Panjikent painting, were not girded. No weapons are shown. In his left hand there is a cithara. Another type of small icon, represented at Panjikent by an intact plaque and a fragment, differs only in some details (figs. 16, 17).26 The cloak also is fastened at the chest with a fibula, Fig. 14. Panjikent terra-cotta icon. jLi' /. a jit Fig. 15. Panjikent. Upper section of terra-cotta icon. and ribbons issue from the crown. A long sword with a right-angle crosspiece hangs on a sword belt similar to those of the sword and dagger in the mural. The deity is seated on a throne with elephant-head supports. Instead of a cithara, a lyre rests on the left knee of the god, and in his right hand there is a plectrum. The well-known Afrasiyab terra-cotta mentioned in connection with arrow-slits on a resonator belongs to the third type of miniature icon (fig. 13). Details differ in many respects, but the image is undoubtedly the same. While the crown is different, it also is adorned with ribbons, and in this case, too, the cloak is fastened at the chest with a fibula. The motif of Sasanian ribbons attached to crowns, which appears on the murals, is by no means characteristic of other crowned figures shown on Sogdian terra-cottas. Thus, one might assume 196</page><page sequence="11">marshak and RASPOPOVA: Worshipers from Temple II, Panjikent Fig. 16. Panjikent. Terra-cotta icon. that the figure depicted on the terra-cottas is the same figure depicted on the Panjikent wall paintings. The Sogdian cithara player has been compared to the god Apollo,27 but it is most unlikely that a Greek god appears on the terra-cottas on which a seated figure is shown playing this instrument. The Sogdian musicians are much closer to the many representations in Late Antique and early Byzantine art of a seated Orpheus28 who, as a Thracian, was depicted by artists as a barbarian wearing garments resembling those of a Parth ian or of the local nobility of Roman Syria. In the early third century, Flavius Philostratus de scribed the image of Orpheus in Parthian Babylo nia: "They are, by the way, favorably disposed toward Orpheus more for his tiara and wide trou sers than for his skill in playing the cithara or singing, which had such an enchanting force."29 A reinterpretation of this image in Judaic (and subsequently in early Christian) art as King David30 facilitated the conversion of a seated ci thara player in Oriental clothes into a Sogdian regal deity. The Sogdians learned about Chris tianity primarily from Nestorian missionaries Fig. 17. Panjikent. Fragment of terra-cotta icon. from the Sasanian Empire. Among the early Christians, Orpheus represented Christ, while David was a prototype of Christ. Occasionally Orpheus, seated on a throne in a royal Sasanian pose with splayed knees and surrounded with beasts and mythological monsters shown listen ing to him reverently, appears as the Almighty.31 However, such compositions, which were not Christian images, were interpreted merely as al legories. Sogdians in search of iconographic im ages could turn to Orpheus imagery without fear of being mistaken for Christians. In doing so, the Sogdians not only emphasized the features that already resembled a Sasanian king in the proto type but also depicted a seated cithara player on a throne with elephant supports,32 which, like all zoomorphic thrones of the gods, certainly carried a symbolic meaning.33 In Sogdiana, each deity had a corresponding animal on which he might be shown riding; his throne might resemble the supine animal or be supported by such animals. All three variants are equivalent in Sogdian art, so that a zoomorphic throne may be regarded as similar to a vahana, the vehicle of an Indian god. 197</page><page sequence="12">marshak and raspopova: Worshipers from Temple II, Panjikent As a matter of fact, the Sogdians equated their compositions of the two walls were symmetrical gods to the Indian gods and, for example, likened and mirror-like. On the southern wall, nearer to their own Adbag to Shakra (Indra), whose vahana the goddess, is a small-scale male figure differing was the elephant.34 Such comparisons, reflected from its opposite in that his boots are black, not in Sogdian Buddhist texts, arose in a Buddhist en- pink, and have bows and buckles like those of vironment, but the Panjikent representation of Vashagn.

All these models under ungirded clothes of "Adbag" cut at the lower edge went change under the influence of Sasanian art, into four long, pointed triangular pieces.

Boyce, ed. and trans., Textual Sources for the Study of Zoroastrianism [Manchester, 1984], p. 70), since spring, according to Vis and Ramin, begins in the ninth month, Adhar (V. Mi norsky, "Vis u Rämin: A Parthian Romance," BSOAS 11 [1946]; 12 [1947]; S. H. Taqizadeh, Gahshumari dar Iran-i-qadim [Tehran, 1317/ 1939], p. 263). As to the identification of the tulip festival with the mourning rites and collection of the bones of the divine scion, as reported in a seventh century Chinese source (E. Chavannes, Docu ments sur les Tou-kiue [Turcs] occidentaux, Sbornik trudov Orkhonskol ekspeditsii, vol. 6 [St. Petersburg, 1903], n. 5, pp. 132-33), these fest ivals occur at different seasons of the year. The Chinese source, referring to the Sogdian ritual, speaks of the seventh month of the Chinese calendar, which is a month later than the Sogdian New Year, and a summer one in that period. According to the source, the bones of the divine scion were collected, the bones apparently rep resented not by red (bloody) flowers but by ears of grain (cf. the text from the Fihrist regarding Sogdian summer rites, cited by A. M. Belenitskii, according to which the bones of Tavuz were ground in a mill [A. M. Belenitskii and Β. I. Marshak, "Stennye rospisi, obnaruzhennye ν 1970 godu na gorodishche drevnego Pendzhi kenta" (Wall paintings discovered in 1970 at the ancient town site of Panjikent), SGE 36 (1973), p. 77]). Correspondingly, the Sogdian seventh century festival belongs to a cycle not associated with spring flowering but with the magic of ensuring the future harvesting of the crops. The collection of the bones was associated with ossuary rites, all the more so that the same passage contains information on the Sogdians' burial customs. In several countries, there is some similarity between the spring and summer rites (see S. A. Tokarev's Introduction to Kalendarnye obychai i obriady ν stranakh zarubezhnol Evropy: Istoricheskie korni i razvitie obychaev, ed. S. A. Tokarev et al. [Moscow, 1983], p. 3). While the legend cited by Ε. M. Peshchereva does not correspond precisely to the seventh-century myth, it belongs to the same, most ancient (according to its sources), series of legends about a dismembered man, the parts of whose body were scattered by his murderers in the fields. A similar death was attributed to Orpheus, the torn and scattered parts of whose body were collected by the Muses (S. A. Tokarev, Rannie formy religil i ikh razvitie [Moscow, 1964], pp. 381-83). S. P. Tolstov identified the dismembered divine scion with Siyavush, who, according to the Shahnama, was not buried (S. P. Tolstov, Drevnil Khorezm: Opyt istoriko-aikheologicheskogo is sledovaniia [Moscow, 1948], pp. 202-5); from the blood he shed grew the plant called the "Blood of Siyavush." This, however, must be some other myth, since the Siyavush of the Shahnama per ished not as an infant or youth but as an adult with two wives and a son. The Blood of Siyavush plant is not a tulip (Abu Relkhan [Rayhan] Biruni, Sobranie svedenil dlia poznaniia diagotsen nostei: Mineialogiia, trans. A. M. Belenitskii; article and commentary by A. M. Belenitskii and G. G. Lemmlein [Moscow, 1963], pp. 37-38, 125). Apparently, Iranian-Central Asian legends, like those from Greece, recount that from the drops of blood that were shed grew various flowers associated with specific personages. At Panjikent there are no representations of Siyavush (cf. Μ. M. D'iakonov, "Obraz Siiavusha ν sredneaziatskol mifologii" [The im age of Siyavush in Central Asian mythology], KSIIMK, no. 40 [1951]; A. A. Semenov, "Zhivopis' drevnego Panjikenta" (The painting of ancient Panjikent) [review], Trudy AN TadzhSSR 42 [1956], pp. 243-44). The seduction scene from section III belongs to the "minor genre" of il lustrations of fairy tales and fables and not to the Siyavush heroic tale, as suggested by Μ. M. D'iakonov. Notes 1.

It would better suit Mithra or Tir, who were likened to Apollo (on his comparison with Tir, see, for example, P. Bernard, "Vicissitudes au gre de l'histoire d'une statue en bronze d'Heracles entre Seleucie du Tigre et la Mesene," Journal des savants [1990], pp. 52-62). N. Sims-Williams believes that Adbag is an epithet attributed to various gods, but, among the Sogdians, Adbag (Indra) is likened to other gods—Zurvan (Brahma) or Veshparkar (Shiva)—as a special deity, for whom the epithet replaced the name (N.

There used to be a summer festival in ancient Khwarazm with a characteristic name "[people] will emerge from their clothes," that is, will be nude. In Iran, in late June-early July, there was a blue lotus festival (Biruni, Pamiatniki minuvshikh pokolenii, pp. 231, 256), which, according to Biruni, "was re cently introduced," i.e., was included in the month Tir near the turn of the tenth-eleventh centuries. Murals in room 12 at Dilbarjin, where the heads of "Athena" 's adorants are decorated with blue lotuses, testify to the existence of the festival in Tokharistan (I. T. Kruglikova, "Nastennye rospisi Dil'berdzhina" [The murals of Dilbarjin], in Drevniaia Baktiiia: Mateiialy Sovetsko-Afganskoi aikheologicheskol ek speditsii 1969-1973 gg., vol. 1 [Moscow, 1976], figs. 55-58). At one time, in the sixth century, it could have coincided with the Nowruz celebration. 57. Belenitskil, "Voprosy ideologii i kul'tov," pp. 31, 32, 73-75, pis. IX, Χ, XII. 58. It is possible that the chapels, as distinct from the main edifices of a temple, were built especially for the rituals of one or another festival whose rituals had become so complicated, due to urbanization, as to require special buildings. 59. In the Hall of Masks at Topraq-qalca, in the view of IU. A. Rapoport, the above altar "could have been cut down to its base, but even later a ritual fire was lighted episodically on the site" just as in "other abandoned shrines of the palace" (Toprak-kala, p. 188, n. 13). 60. In Iran, perfuming was performed at the time of the Sade festival, held on the tenth day of the eleventh month, and in Khwarazm on the days of the "Night of Mina," the fifteenth day of the tenth month (Biruni, Pamiatniki minuvshikh pokolenii, pp. 243, 257). In the sixth century, these festivals fell in April and May, but the time at which various festivals were celebrated may have changed according to the mov able calendar, making it difficult to ascertain which aspects of their rituals were associated with the sea sonal customs of one era or another, since anachro nisms, many of which were noted by Biruni himself, were traditionally perpetuated. In addition, it is unlikely that a chapel was used only once a year although the ritual represented on its walls was, of course, the main one celebrated there. 61. P. G.

Provided only that the Sogdians never made in tercalations, returning the New Year back to its former position, the third month of the Sogdian year, named Nisanic, at some time could have corresponded to the Nisan of the Seleucid calendar, from which this month name was probably borrowed through Bactrian media tion (V. A. Livshits, "Zoroastrirskil kalendar'" [The "Zoroastrian" calendar], in E. J. Bickerman, Khro nologiia dievnego mira [Moscow, 1975], p. 332). In the sixth century, among the Sogdians, the fifth-fifteenth days of the tenth month were days that fell mainly in April and were holidays. The fifteenth-sixteenth days of the tenth month were celebrated with interesting spring rites by the Persians (Peikan and Kakil') and the Khwarazmians (the Night of Mina). Thus it was in the early Middle Ages, but this day, like any day of the movable calendar, fell at another time of the year in an earlier period. (Note that the Khwarazmian calendar differed little in this regard from the Sogdian calendar, with which it was synchronized.) Only at the begin ning of the Middle Ages could the characteristics of a spring folk festival have been attached to it (Biruni, Pamiatniki minuvshikh pokolenii, pp. 239, 240, 255, 257; idem, Kniga viazumleniia nachatkam nauki ο zvezdakh, vol. 6 [Tashkent, 1975], pp. 144-45). 76.

At the beginning of the sixth month, the Khwa razmian army, led by the king, conducted a semi festive/semi-military campaign into the steppe beyond the irrigated lands (Biruni, Pamiatniki minuvshikh pokolenii, p. 257; idem, Kniga vrazumleniia nachat kam nauki ο zvezdakh, p. 145). In the sixth-early sev enth centuries, this festival fell in October-December (Khwarazmian and Sogdian months coincided). There is no special mention of the hunt, but one should not forget the important role it played in combat exercises and in the field life of Central Asian riders. In the ancient world, late autumn and winter were the hunt ing seasons. According to the Shahnama, Bahram Gur went hunting in the steppe in the spring and around the Mihragan festival; the sixth-seventh months of the Iranian calendar are also named. At the beginning of the seventh month of their year, the Sogdians cel ebrated the important festival of Nimsarda (half-year), which in the Tang shu was mistaken for the begin ning of their year in the twelfth month of the Chinese calendar, idem, Pamiatniki minuvshikh pokolenii, pp. 254-55; Ν.

In the Sui shi, the Chach fes tivals held on the sixth day of the first month and on the fifteenth day of the seventh month are mentioned [ibid., p. 382)—quite possibly they are the Greater Nowruz and the eve of Mihrigan according to the local, not Chinese, numbering of the months. 207</page></plain_text>
