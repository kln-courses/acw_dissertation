<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Identification of the Bagh Painting by Monika Zin With the exception of the world-famous monastery caves of Ajanta, only few examples of paintings are preserved, that are suitable for conveying an impression of the development of the art of painting in ancient India (1). The most important of these are the wall paintings in the Buddhist monastery complex of Bagh, a group of ten caves, situated approx. 300 km north of Ajanta, in the Vindhya mountains on the river Bagni (Bagh), which dates from the period 460-480, thus corresponding to the more recent Ajanta complex (2). The similarities between certain motifs in the paintings in Bagh and Ajanta suggest that the paintings not only date from the same period, but could also be by the same school or even the same artists (Fig. la-b (3)) (4). Considering the high quality of the Bagh painting, it is very unfortunate that here, in contrast to Ajanta, only few remains have been preserved. Remains of murals are to be found in five caves (Caves II, III, IV, V and VII), but in most cases these are merely fragments of the ornamental decor or remains of the non-narrative paintings, which correspond to those of the Bodhisatva kings at the entrances to the cellas in Ajanta. i1) A compilation of the sites, including a complete list of secondary literature, is to be found in D. Schlingloff, Ajanta-Handbuch der Malerein /Handbook of the Paintings, 1. Erz?hlende Wandmalerein/ Narrative Wall-Paintings, Wiesbaden 2000, vol. 2, bibliography', 4.1-4.23. (2) W. Spink ('Bagh, A Study', AAA, 30, New York 1976-77, pp. 53-84) dates the Bagh caves to the period approx. 465-480. The other treatises regarding the dating of the caves diverge from this view. For some researchers, the copper plate with the inscript of King Subandhu, found in Cave II in 1929, and the stupas in the cellas push the date backwards, but others date the caves as late as the 7th century, cf. V.V. Mirashi, The Age of the Bagh Caves', Indian Historical Quarterly, 21, 2, Calcutta 1945, pp. 79-85; P.K.

The only painting in Bagh for which we can assume a narrative model is also the largest and is located on the exterior facade of the complex. Description of the Painting and Previous Interpretations The preserved part of the largest Bagh painting of approx. 13 m length reaches from the position of the right-hand window of Cave IV to the start of Cave V, thus filling the rear wall of the common veranda, once situated in front of the two caves, the existence of which is borne witness to today by a few remains of the 20 pillars. The collapse of the veranda at a time which can no longer be determined led to the exposure of the murals to the influence of the weather. The paintings preserved today are remnants of a composition which originally covered the whole wall of the veranda, but today only the parts covered by a protruding rock are preserved. The painting was first mentioned in 1818 The first detailed description by a Mr Impey was written in 1854 (6). Although several mistakes in interpretation were found in Impey's description, later to be corrected by J.Ph. Vogel in Marshall's book (7), this description has been quoted again and again in works on Bagh, most 1984, pp. 41-47) can be much more convincingly explained as the special form of flowers or as ruler's emblems with parasols of honour - a motif also to be found in Ajanta XVII (ill.: J. Griffiths, The Paintings in the Buddhist Cave Temples of Ajanta, London 1896-97, vol. 2, pi. 142.23). (5) W.

Although all of these later descriptions emphasize the poor state of preservation of the paintings, it must be said that the remains are still discernible even today (8), as, for example, the photographs of the South Asian Photo Collection show (9). However, in the publications, usually the 1920s copies made by A.K. Haldar, N.L. Bose, S.N. Kar, A.B. Bhonsle, B.A. Apte, M.S. Bhand and V.B. Jagtap, which are kept in the Gwalior Museum and in the British Museum (10) and are reproduced in their entirety as colour prints in Marshall's book (n), are reprinted. The redrawings in this essay (Fig. 2), taken from Marshall's publication, were made by Bose, Haldar, Kar und Apte, on the basis of this original copy; they verify the descriptions given by Impey and Vogel, which run from left to right and can be summarized as follows: - Two women seated inside a building are mourning; the woman on the right is holding an object, presumably a cloth, in front of her tear-stained face. - Four male persons are seated in conversation together; the two in the middle, obviously the protagonists, are somewhat bigger, the person on the left is particularly richly decorated with jewellery. Beneath the two persons seated on the left is yet another, much smaller person, according to Vogel it is 'of blue colour - it must be either a child or a dwarf [...]' (12). (8) The description, the copies and illustrations were of the upper part of the painting. Impey writes that the wall contained two rows of murals: 'At one time the whole front of this has been covered with paintings about the natural height, in a double row, one set above the other, and the surface extant of the work thus elaborately depicted must have been at least 3,000 feet' (1856, p. 561). Obviously, even then, nothing remained of the lower row. The description does not even suggest whether the lower row portrayed persons or ornamental work. The remains of the painting on the north side of Cave IV, i.e. to the left of the entrance door, on the left-hand side of the former veranda, seem, in contrast, to have actually contained at least two rows. The description implies that the figures here were 'much smaller' and were grouped around the central 'Buddh'. 'The commencement of the upper row resembles the healing of the sick: one lean man is sitting and another lying down, their limbs emaciated, while a third seems to be carried before a fourth figure, who appears to be advising them. Two females next occur in a mourning attitude, preceded by a child in glee; then four dancing figures, and another child running, but looking backwards; this borders on the figure of Buddh referred to. The lower row is excessively indistinct, the heads only being traceable satisfactorily; none can be continued: there is one, however, a female with a child at her feet, evidently praying to the figure of Buddh above described' (ibid., p. 565). In my opinion the painting could have depicted not the Buddha but Avalokitesvara, the so-called Saviour, i.e. the Bodhisatva, surrounded by small scenes with people in various difficulties. Such paintings are to be found in Ajanta in Caves II, VI and XVII (ill.: G. Yazdani, Ajanta, Oxford 1930-55, vol. 2, pi. 28b and vol. 4, p. 4a).

There are only slight differences compared with the previous scene: here the dancer has no cap on and the female orchestra consists of only six women. - The following two scenes are separated from the dancing scenes by a wall (14) and separated from each other by a conventionally portrayed rock formation. The first of these two scenes shows a procession of many horsemen. The king is in the centre, marked by a parasol of honour, and is accompanied by an archer walking in front of him. (On the basis of comparisons with similar scenes in Ajanta (15), we can assume that in this scene the armed infantry accompanying the cavalry was portrayed in the lower section of the picture). - The next scene to the right portrays another army procession, moving in the same direction as the previous one, but in this case the participants are riding on elephants instead of horses. The king, again with a parasol of honour held over him (16), rides at the head of the procession; at the end come three women seated on an elephant led by a mahout. - Next to this, the copy of the painting only shows a gate, which probably served merely as a scene divider, and behind this the remains of another elephant, led by a mahout, which, however, here is facing in the opposite direction, that is, to (13) In Marg, 25, 3 (Anonymous, 'Portfolio: Bagh Plates', p. 10) the hypothesis is stated, that the left scene originated earlier than the one on the right. This assumption has nothing to justify it. The author's subjective impressions that the dancer on the left is 'polished' and the dancer on the right 'signifies a folk presence', are as little based on fact as the statements: Tt is likely that while the painter of the left-hand side panel was in touch with the court poetry, the artist who elaborated the second scene had a more vague apperception of the poet Kalidasa'. The composition of the painting is most certainly planned and there is nothing to indicate later additions. (14) Vogel saw the remains of a two-line inscription in Gupta script under the wall. 'Only one letter is plainly visible, it is a looped ka, apparently the concluding letter of the first line. In front of it there are traces of another letter which can no longer be identified, but seems to be provided with the vowel mark e (op. tit., p. 51). Garde (op. at., p. 22) dates the letter to the 6th or 7th century.

Vogels (who had seen the painting) corrected version of Impey's text tells that the part which is preserved in copy belongs to a scene in which elephants and horses stop at a tree honoured by flags and a cakra; under the tree stood 'two small frames or stands containing some drinking vessels and a gourd' (17). - Further to the right there was, according to Impey's description, another tree, under which two male persons were shown sitting. One of them, an ascetic or monk (incorrectly designated as 'Buddh' by Impey) (18), was teaching a man seated beside him, about whose appearance we know nothing, as already at the time the descriptions were made, only a part of his face and a hand were preserved. Most of the descriptions of this painting are restricted to an aesthetic appreciation of this portrayal, which is truly distinguished by the highest quality (19). However the contents of the paintings had not been identified. Vogel contented himself with the comment that the painting probably did not show a story from the life of the Buddha, but a J?taka or Avad?na (20). Debala Mitra was of the opinion that we have here 'depicted a string of seemingly unconnected narratives' (21). To date, only two attempts have been made to link the painting to a literary model; however, neither of these attempts is sound. In 1928, on the occasion of the debate on the book published by Marshall, Ghose attempted to explain the scene as being a portrayal of the Buddha legend (22), even though in the book under discussion, Vogel himself had mentioned the person whom Impey named as 'Buddh', as wearing 'little blue adornments' and being without the 'characteristic marks of the Buddha' (23). In 1972 Anderson, without even attempting to provide evidence to support his assertion, made the claim that the scenes showed the Mah?janaka story (24), solely on the basis of the similarity with the dancing scenes in the well-known Mah?janaka painting in Cave I of Ajanta. (17) Impey, op. cit., p. 564. (18) Impey himself, was not quite certain of his identification, he writes: 'He differs from Buddhist figures in general in being without curly hair../, ibid., p. 564.

Analysis of the Evidence for Identification In the painting, one figure can be identified unambiguously and unquestionably: one of the two persons shown in conversation in the second scene from the left is with certainty the god Indra. His elaborately worked, basket-shaped crown cannot be confused with any other royal headwear and corresponds exactly to the shape of the Indra crown in the Ajanta paintings (Fig. 3a-c) (25). A further unmistakable sign that this person is Indra is the small figure, called a child or dwarf by Vogel, seated to the left at Indra s right knee. This figure displays a strange growth on its head (Vogel: 'curious white crest, trefoil shaped') (26). This person can be none other than Vajrapurusa - the personified weapon of Indra, also shown occasionally in other schools of art, sometimes in the form of a fat dwarf (Fig. 4a-c) (27). The fact that we have identified Indra in the painting greatly narrows the range of possible interpretations. The explanation must lie in one of two areas: either it is a narration, in which Indra is discussing an earthly event with another god, namely Fig. 3a-( appearance of the Mahajanaka Jataka on the left and back walls of the later Ajanta I, we see that this Jataka was thought suitable for illustration and was depicted in the "narrative-recall" scenes; and that these paintings in Ajanta I do show similar events as those before Bagh Caves IV and V. Apart from this observation, Anderson's study is devoted to the detailed analysis of the composition of the painting and not to its content.

Visvakarman, probably about how they could test the virtue of a mortal, King Sibi (28) for example, or it is a conversation between Indra and a mortal himself. For the first proposal the painting offers us no further clues, which could be connected to known narrative material, so that here one would have to revert to speculations which cannot be proven. In order to avoid such speculations, the interpretation should be based on an observation which provides the key to the comprehension of the painting: more than half of the preserved painting shows a procession moving from right to left, which implies that the scenes of the painting should be read from right to left and not, as the common descriptions of the scenes since Impey have assumed, from left to right. This means, therefore, that the two scenes of the army procession take place before the Indra conversation and that this scene takes place in heaven, because in the scene beside it we see gods flying through the clouds. The number of stories in which mortals enter heaven and speak to Indra is, as the texts themselves tell us (29), very small; indeed, in connection with the royal army procession (30) there is only one story by which the painting can be identified and, in addition, this identification is confirmed by numerous parallel portrayals: the earthly king, who goes to Indra s heaven and sits there in conversation with the king of the gods at the same height and of the same rank, is the ideal ruler M?ndh?tar.

(30) Of those listed above, Guttila (J?taka, no. 248) was not a king, and the kings S?dina (J?taka, no. 494) and Nimi (J?taka, no. 541) went to heaven not accompanied by a procession, but in Indra's chariot, driven by M?tali. 306 [8]</page><page sequence="9">Overview of the Narratives about King M?ndhatar The narrative about M?ndh?tr/M?ndh?tar/Mandh?tar/M?ndh?tu^ is known from numerous literary sources and is presumably very old. Already in Vedic literature M?ndh?tar was linked with the figures who later appeared in the narrative, even though his story is not recounted. The Gopatha Br?hmana (31) calls him M?ndh?tur Yauvan?sva - descendant of Yuvan?sva, who in the whole of the epic tradition is held to be M?ndh?tar s father; Rgveda I (32) links M?ndh?tar with the Asvins, who are supposed to have helped him gain possession of land (ksatrd). Although this story is not found in the later tradition, the Asvins are later still mentioned as those who provided surgical aid at M?ndh?tar's birth out of his fathers body (33). This motif of such an unnatural birth, which is common in the relevant literature, possibly originates from the attempts to give the name M?ndh?tar an etymological explanation: only if M?ndh?tar had no mother to feed him, could the others - the gods with Indra in the Brahman tradition and the women in the Buddhist version - call out mam dh?tu 'he should suckle on me!'; a call which is supposed to be the reason for giving him this name (34). In the Brahman tradition M?ndh?tar emerges from his father's, Yuvan?sva's, side at his birth (35), the Buddhists, who also called him M?rdh?ta and M?rdhaja, have him emerging from his father's, here called Uposatha (36), growth head (37).

(37) The child is born from a pure and painless ulcer: Uposadasya r?jno m?rdhni pittako j?to mrduh sumrdus tadyath? t?lapicur v? karp?sapicur v? na kamcid ?b?dham janayati (Divy?vad?na XVII, ed. p. 210, Gilgit Mss, III, 1, p. 92; Bodhisattv?vad?nakalpalat?, IV 13-14, ed. p. 38; T 165, p. 393b; T 202 = Der Weise und der Thor, transl. IJ. Schmidt, St. Petersburg 1843, p. 370). The motif is only told in Sanskrit tradition. M?ndh?tar is also mentioned in lists of extraordinary births, as having been born from the head: Buddhacarita (Chinese) I. 10 and I. 29 (transl. pp. 2-3, 6). [9] 307</page><page sequence="10">to this unusual pregnancy are recounted, we are told about the water prepared by ascetics (38), or, respectively about the butter (39), which was actually meant for his wife and which the king only drank by mistake. The version of the story in the epics emphasises the figure of M?ndh?tar as the ideal ruler, who only did good in his life and was equal to Indra (40). The Rsis, who made the water to create the pregnancy, had already intended to create a child that would be capable of fighting against Indra (41). After the birth, Indra gives the new-born child his finger to suck, thus giving him great growth and strength (42). As an adult, M?ndh?tar takes over half of Indra s throne and conquers the whole earth in one night (43). When a 12-year drought occurs on earth, M?ndh?tar makes it rain, thus saving the earth (44). At another place in epic literature, we are told of fabulous offerings which the king gave to the Brahmans: golden fish one yojana (mile) long, mountains of food and ponds of soup, milk and honey (45). The epics report that the ideal king did not eschew taking drastic steps to protect justice (46). In some epic versions the story serves the purpose of demonstrating that even a life as successful as M?ndh?tar s came to an end (47). Two places in the epics also tell of an open rivalry between M?ndh?tar and Indra. In the R?m?yana it is recounted that M?ndh?tar, who conquered heaven and was on the point of defeating Indra, was cunningly reminded by Indra in his state of fear, that there was still one part of the earth unconquered, whereupon M?ndh?tar returned to earth. The part of earth still (38) In Mah?bh?rata III. 126.10 ff. (ed. p. 414, transl. pp. 463-64) Bh?rgava prepares water which the thirsty king drinks during the night and throws away the rest, in Bodhisattv?vad?nakalpalat? IV (8-12, ed. p. 38) too, the tired and thirsty king drinks the holy water.

In the Mah?bh?rata, on the other hand, it is said at one point that M?ndh?tar defeated Indra at the N?ga town of Gomati (49). The Buddhists, too, discovered M?ndh?tar s story for themselves; however, they emphasized different aspects compared with the epics. The ideal king is equipped with seven jewels (50): a wheel, a jewel, an elephant, a horse, a wife, a general, a citizen (or a son) (31), but the story serves as an example for the ever-growing, but never satisfied desire to possess and to conquer (52). In the oldest Buddhist version, the three g?th?s of J?taka no. 258, it is first said (g?th? 1) that all creatures under the sun and the moon serve King M?ndh?tar (53), in the following two verses it is (48) R?m?yana VII. 59, ed. p. 355, transl. p. 1773.

One of the oldest Buddhist texts that list and describe them is Dighanik?ya XVII. 1.7-17 (ed. vol. 2, pp. 172-77'; transl. pp. 202-8) - in the story of the world ruler Mah?sudarsana. For the prebuddhistic development of the idea cf. J. Gonda, Ancient Indian Kingship from the Religious Point of View, Leiden 1966, p. 37 ff. (51) In the Sanskrit tradition the seven jewels appear after M?ndh?tar's coronation {tasya sapta ratn?ni pr?durbh?t?ni tadyath? cakraratnam hastiratnam asvaratnam maniratnam parin?yakaratnam striratnam grhapatiratnam evam saptamam - Divy?vad?na XVII, ed. p. 211; exactly the same in Bodhisattv?vad?nakalpalat? IV. 20, ed. p. 39; T 152, cf. E. Chavannes, Cinq cents contes et apologues, Paris 1910-35, vol. I, p. 138; T 165, p. 393c; T202, ibid., vol. IV, p. 107 = Der Weise und der Thor, transl. p. 371). In the P?li tradition M?ndh?tar is named as the owner of the seven jewels (prose of Mandh?tuf?taka, no. 258, ed. vol. 2, p. 311), but they are not listed. The fact that the tradition was generally well known is proved by the statements in the text, where, exactly as in the Sanskrit tradition, the dramatis personae are called ratnas, z.B.: tato r?j? parin?yakaratanam pucchi... (Dighanik?yatthakath? XV. 1, ed. vol. 2, p. 481). While the texts speak of parin?yaka and grhapati, in the pictorial tradition one of these persons is portrayed as being much smaller, so that one must think of one of them as being the son, cf. supra Figs. 5 and 6. In the commentary to Dighanik?ya XVI. 1.17 (ed. vol. 2, p. 628) Buddhaghosa makes parin?yaka equal to the eldest son of the king. (52) Paccuppannavattu of the Mandh?tuf?taka (no. 258, ed. vol. 2, pp. 310-11; transl. p. 216) gives as the reason for the master telling the story of the past the monks' report about a brother who saw a beautiful, rich woman and was later dissatisfied with monastic life. In the Dhammapadatthakath? (ed. vol. 3, pp. 239-40; transl. vol. 3, p. 62) the story is told in order to instruct a greedy monk. In Der Weise und der Thor (transl. pp. 369-70) the Buddha instructs greedy monks, who are striving for fame, with this story. Mah?prajn?par?mit?s?stra (E. Lamotte, Le traite de la Grande Vertu de Sagesse, Louvain 1944 80, vol. 2, p. 931) says explicitly that in spite of his riches etc., M?ndh?tar did not attain the right way. (53) J?taka, no. 258 (ed. vol. 2, p. 313, transl. p. 217): y?vat? candimasuriy? dis? bhanti virocam?n?/ sabbe va d?s?

Whether the rain of gold, unknown in the orthodox tradition in connection with M?ndh?tar, was linked to him in the Buddhist version from the very start or entered it possibly from a saying about unsatisfied desire is not important. What is significant is that the magic rain plays an essential role in the later versions of the theme, as well as the integration into the history of Buddhist geography and cosmology. While the later Pali tradition in J?taka prose (35) and in the commentary to the Dhammapada (56) only briefly tells about M?ndh?tar's ability to let it rain jewels and about the conquest of the heaven of the Four Mah?r?jas and the Thirty-three Gods, the texts of 'northern' Buddhism go into much more detail. Fundamental for the later tradition, as illustrated for example in the Bodhisattv?vad?nakalpalat? (37), is the version in the Vinaya of the M?lasarv?stiv?dins, also integrated into Divy?vad?na (58) and preserved in the Tibetan Tanjur (59). It reports that M?ndh?tar, in order to save his subjects from work, first gets a deity to make it rain 27 types of grain (60), then cotton, cotton yarn and clothing (61). Then he makes it rain money, first in his own palace and then in the whole land, in order to prove that this happened through his merit and not due to the piety of his subjects (62). Next, M?ndh?tar begins his (54) The two verses of the J?taka (ed. p. 313, transl. p. 217) correspond to verses 186 and 187 of Dhammapada (ed. p. 53): na kah?panavassena titti k?mesu vijjatii appass?d? dukh? k?m? iti vinn?ya pandito// api dibbesu k?mesu ratim so n?dhigacchatif tanhakkhayarato hoti samm?sambuddhas?vakof/ (55) Mandh?tuj?taka, no. 258, ed. vol. 2, p. 311.

III, 1, pp. 92-97) is shorter. Fragments of the story are also preserved in Mss remains found in Turfan, cf. E. Waldschmidt et. al., Sanskrithandschriften aus Turfanfunden, Wiesbaden 1965, no. 558, vol. 1, pp. 248-49; vol. 4, pp. 244-46; no. 982, vol. 3, pp. 243-44.

(60) The text repeatedly uses the same phrase, e.g.: yatas ca sa r?j? kathayatil mama r?jye manusy?h krsisyanti/ tatas tenoktam/ sapt?vimsativijaj??n?m devo varsatuf sahacittotp?d?d eva r?jno M?rdh?tasya sapt?vimsativijaj? fir devo vrstahf {Divy?vad?na XVII, ed. p. 212). Similarly in T165, pp. 393c-94b and T 202 = Der Weise und der Thor (p. 372) the range of magical apparitions is extended to include a rain of musical instruments. (61) Divy?vad?na XVII, ed. p. 212, Tibetan Tales, p. 5; T165 (p. 394a) speaks of silken robes. (62) Divy?vad?na XVII, ed. pp. 213-14, Tibetan Tales, pp. 5-6. All Buddhist texts emphasise that M?ndh?tar owed his happy life to his previous merits. The Sanskrit tradition explains explicitly what merits they were: in the time of a previous Buddha called Sarv?bhibh?ta, M?ndh?tar as the son of a merchant is supposed to have strewn the gems in front of the Majestic One and in the time of Vipasyin, M?ndh?tar as a corn merchant threw the ears of corn into Vipasyin's bowl (Divy?vad?na XVII, ed. p. 227; Panglung, op. cit., p. 36). Bodhisattv?vad?nakalpalat? changes the ears of corn to beans mudga (IV. 114-16, ed. p. 45). 310 [12]</page><page sequence="13">conquest of the world. The Yaksa Divaukasa gives him the ideas for his military campaigns (63). First M?ndh?tar conquers the regions of the world (64) which were not yet his subjects, including Uttarakurus with its wishing-trees; from here he takes possession of the seven mountains around the world mountain Sumeru (65) and then approaches the seat of the gods. Here he is obstructed by 500 Rsis and their curse, under the leadership of Durmukha (66). M?ndh?tar had banished these ascetics from his land, because they had cursed the birds, so that their wings fell off (67). Although curses otherwise always inevitably come true, M?ndh?tar made the curse of the opposing Rsis harmless and he began to conquer heaven by first subjugating the five armies protecting the Trayastrimsa gods, namely the N?gas, Karotap?nis, M?l?dh?ras (M?y?dh?ras), Sad?mattakas and C?turmah?devas (68). Each of these (63) In the J?taka prose the ministers answer the king's questions, in the Sanskrit tradition the person of Yaksa Divaukasa appears, who performs services for M?ndh?tar (he obtains all the necessary utensils so that the coronation ceremony can take place) (Divy?vad?na XVII, ed. p. 211; Tibetan Tales, p. 3; Bodhisattv?vad?nakalpalat? IV 18, ed. p. 39; T 195, p. 393b) and answers the king's questions regarding the targets for conquest. The name of the Yaksa, literally 'the inhabitant of heaven', is most peculiar and does not appear in any of the Yaksa lists, as far as I am aware. In one place in the Mah?bh?rata, which describes M?ndh?tar's birth, it is said that the inhabitants of heaven including Indra gave M?ndh?tar the name (III. 126.28, cf. n. 33). In the Tibetan and in the Divy?vad?na Divaukasa is called M?ndh?tar's 'usher' (p. 211: Divaukaso n?ma yaksah purojavah). The king's constant companion reminds one strongly of Vajrap?ni, like Divaukasa M?ndh?tar, Vajrap?ni constantly accompanies the Buddha. In T 165 and T 202 - Der Weise und der Thor the Yaksa has no personal name, in the latter text he calls out the targets for conquest without being asked.

The Rsi D?rrnukha^ takes water in his hand (tena grhyodakasy?njalih ksiptah/ viskambhitam bhatabal?gram, Divy?vad?na XVII, ed. p. 217; Tibetan Tales, p. 11, Bodhisattv?vad?nakalpalat? IV. 62, ed. p. 41), in order to stop the army. M?ndh?tar makes the ascetics' jat?s fall off and makes them march in front of his army, carrying bows and arrows. Only at the request of the striratna does he set the ascetics free (Gilgit Mss, III. 1, p. 94; Tibetan Tales, p. 11). (67) Gilgit Mss, ed. III. 1, p. 93; Divy?vad?na XVII, pp. 211-12; Tibetan Tales, 3-4; Bodhisattv?vad?nakalpalat? IV. 25-45, ed. pp. 39-40; T 165 (393c) adds that the king of the birds complained in the palace, enraging the king and leading to the banishment of the ascetics. (68) Gilgit Mss, ed. III. 1, p. 65; Divy?vad?na XVII, pp. 218-19; Tibetan Tales, pp. 11-13; Bodhisattv?vad?nakalpalat? IV. 12-1 A, ed. 42; T165 (398a-398c) only names N?gas and 'the other deities'. These deities are also named in other places. The verse of Kul?vakaj?taka (no. 31, ed. vol. 1, p. 204) mentions the fivefold guard of the gods - antar? dvinnam ayujjhapur?nam/ pancavidh? thapit? abhirakkh? - this consists of: uragakaroti payassa ca h?rif madanayut? caturo ca mahant? ti. The commentator explains these as N?gas, Garudas, Kumbh?ndas, Yaksas and Catur Mah?r?jas - an [13] 311</page><page sequence="14">groups of deities wanted to stop the conqueror, but they were incorporated into his army. Finally, the Thirty-three gods were informed that M?ndh?tar s army was approaching. The gods welcomed the king with great honours (69) and granted him entry to Sumeru, where the gods abandoned themselves to the five sensual pleasures under the dark P?rij?taka-trees (70). In the heavenly assembly hall the king of the gods, Sakra, gave king M?ndh?tar half of his throne (71). According to P?li tradition, Indra divided his deities into two halves and gave one half to M?ndh?tar (72). The continuation of the story, which, in the orthodox tradition, ends at this point, proceeds to a surprising turning point: after M?ndh?tar had ruled beside Indra in heaven for an infinite length of time, during the rule of 36 Indras (73), his fate changed. M?ndh?tar won a war against the Asuras and in his arrogance, the explanation which is not to be supported, since N?gas, Kumbh?ndas and Yaksas are led by the Catur Mah?r?jas and Garudas are never counted as belonging to them. A reference in the Sanskrit tradition of the Sarv?stiv?da school, the description of the inhabitants of Meru in Abhidharmakosa (III. 62-64, ed. pp. 520-21; transl. vol. 1, p. 159) does not name the N?gas, but Karotap?nis, M?l?dh?ras, Sad?mattas and Mah?r?jikas - thus only four groups. The descriptive names of the deities 'Bowl-in-hand', 'Garland-holder' (Gilgit Mss, call them M?y?dh?ras!) and 'Constantly drunk' were probably used for C?turmah?r?jas (i.e. the deities of the Catur Mah?r?jas). What is meant must be the subjects of Kubera, because he is elsewhere also depicted with a wine bowl. The interpretation of the descriptive names as sovereign groups of deities had probably led to the unusual division into five groups. (69) The descriptions of the reasons which motivated the deities to their actions are possibly ambiguous. Each group thinks that M?ndh?tar was of very great merit and announces him without reservations to the next group, who welcomes him with even greater honours for the same reasons: Catv?ro Mah?r?j?nahsamlaksayanti/ puny amah es?khyo (yam sattvo n?sya sakyam viroddhum iti/ tatas tais Caturbhir Mah?r?jais Trayastrims?n?m ?rocitam/ esa bhavanto manusyar?j?

(Divy?vad?na XVII, ed. p. 219). (70) Detailed descriptions of heaven are to be found in Divy?vad?na XVII, pp. 219-22, Tibetan Tales, pp. 13-16 and T165, 398c-402b. (71) Many texts repeat this statement, in P?li, in the commentaries to Digha- (ed. vol. 2, p. 482) and Majjhimanik?ya (ed. vol. 1, p. 225 but also in T 165, p. 403b) it was said that M?ndh?tar sat on Indra's throne pandukambalasil?. The Sanskrit references, Gilgit Mss (ed. III. 1, p. 95); Divy?vad?na XVII (ed. p. 222); Tibetan Tales (p. 16); Bodhisattv?vad?nakalpalat? IV 88 (ed. p. 43); T 202 = Der Weise und der Thor (transl. 375) and Buddhacarita XL 13 (ed. p. 87; transl. p. 113) and Chinese IL 10.817 (transl. SBE, 19, p. 118) tell that M?ndh?tar got half of the seat devendren?rdh?sana. The Divy?vad?na comments that before the seat was divided, in the hall of assembly Sudharm? there were 32 seats for Upendras, a throne for Indra and a seat at the end of the row prepared for M?ndh?tar. Upon M?ndh?tar's mere thought whether the last seat was meant for him, Sakra gave him half of his own throne. (72) J?taka prose, ed. vol. 2, p. 312. (73) All text references agree on this statement, cf. J?taka prose (ed. vol. 2, p. 312); Dhammapadatthakath? (ed. vol. 3, p. 240; transl. vol. 3, p. 62); Dighanik?yatthakath? (ed. vol. 2, p. 483); Majjhimanik?yatthakath? (ed. vol. 1, p. 226); Divy?vad?na XVII (ed. p. 222); Tibetan Tales (p. 16); T 202 = Der Weise und der Thor (transl. p. 375). Divy?vad?na XVII (ed. p. 225) and the Tibetan translation of the story (Tibetan Tales, p. 20) explains additionally how long M?ndh?tar's whole life lasted and how long the divine days, years etc. last. 312 [14]</page><page sequence="15">thought occurred to him to depose of Indra, the king of the gods, and to rule alone (74). This arrogance brought his happiness to an abrupt end and he fell down from heaven to his hometown, where he became seriously ill. Before he died, he instructed several people about the ruin that results from arrogance C3). From what has been said, it should have become apparent that the Buddhists not only re-designed the story of M?ndh?tar and enriched it with new motifs, but that they also altered the king's character and thus changed the moral of the story itself. Little remains to be seen of the impeccable ideal ruler of the epic tradition. The Buddhist tendency aims to condemn arrogance, greed and the lustful striving for sensual pleasures and to demonstrate their negative, disastrous consequences. If the story did not conclude with the virtuous deeds of the dying king, instructing his fellow men on the negative consequences of desire, it would hardly be possible to declare M?ndh?tar as being Bodhisatva. Portrayals of the M?ndh?tar Story in Art The Indian artists could choose from many different ways to visually present the M?ndh?tar story. In pre-Christian art, the king was portrayed together with his seven jewels. The fact that the portrayals show not just any world ruler, but M?ndh?tar himself, is proved by the streams of coins raining from heaven (76) (Fig. 5) (77) as well as the fact that in later art such hieratic portraits of the king were incorporated into the multi-scene portrayals of his story. (74) The war against the Asuras, which M?ndh?tar wins immediately, because they flee at the mere sound of him drawing his bow, is reported in some places in the Sanskrit tradition (Gilgit Mss, ed. III. 1, p. 95; Divy?vad?na XVII, ed. p. 223; Tibetan Tales, p. 17; T 165, 403b-405a; T 202 = Der Weise und der Thor, transl. p. 375). Other references give no reason, apart from increasing greed, why M?ndh?tar wanted to seize all the power. T165 (405a) and T152 (Chavannes, op. cit., vol. 1, p. 141) discuss that when M?ndh?tar had sinful thoughts, all his supernatural abilities disappeared; all other versions emphasise the immediate effect of these evil thoughts. (75) J?taka prose, vol. 2, p. 313; Divy?vad?na XVII, ed. pp. 223-24; Tibetan Tales, p. 19; T 165, 405b. (76) The identification of the reliefs is from TN. Ramachandran, The Identification of a Buddhist Sculpture from Jaggayyapeta', in Proceedings of the 7th All-India Oriental Conference, Baroda 1933, pp. 763-72. J?taka prose (ed. p. 311) exactly describes the procedure by which M?ndh?tar produced the coins flowing from heaven: in doing so, he had touched his lowered left hand with his right hand. This is not shown in the pictures; the king stands with his right hand raised in a gesture of greeting. The left hand, clenched to a fist at his chest, however, does seem to have a certain significance and is presumably symbolic for 'rain-making' - an ability of the cakravartins, cf. A.K. Coomaraswamy, 'A Royal Gesture and Some other Motifs', in Festbundel Kon. Bataviaasch Genootschap, 1929, pp. 57-61. The N?gas, who are responsible for rainfall, are depicted with the same gesture.

On the right-hand side, however, we have Fig. 6. 1955, p. 37. A very similar, presumably somewhat more recent example of a cakravartin picture is to be found in the Musee Guimet (cf. D. Barrett, Two Unpublished Sculptures from the ?ndhradesY, Artibus Asiae, 3, Ascona 1956, pp. 287-92, fig. 3). The top of the relief has been broken off, so that the streams of coins which were possibly depicted there are not preserved, which in turn makes the identification of the monarch as M?ndh?tar uncertain.

The upper part of the relief shows the events in the world of the gods, firstly, on the left, the procession of M?ndh?tar's army, represented here by a flying elephant with M?ndh?tar flying to heaven. The middle scene contains the portrayal which allowed the whole story to be recognised, namely two equal kings seated on one throne. In the scene on the right, only fragments of women's' figures can be seen. Portrayals of the story in a similar form were not unusual in Amaravati and Nagarjunikonda, as, in particular, the 'pictures of the pictures', i.e. the panels with depictions of the stupas surrounded by reliefs, show us. The tiny scenes in these stupa show only a few or often even only one scene of the series (Fig. 7a-b) (79) and thus prove that the individual scenes were comprehensible, even if the whole series of scenes was not displayed. (79) Amaravati, British Museum, Fig. 7a: BM, no. 85, ill.: R. Knox, Amaravati, London 1992, fig. 76; the scene to the left of the worship of the Buddha's footprints shows M?ndh?tar on the throne together with Indra, the scene to the right is not identified (identifiable!), further right there was presumably a depiction of M?ndh?tar's campaign of conquest, the frieze below has nothing to do with the narrative material and shows the story of Sy?m?vati and Udayana; Fig. 7b: BM, no. 83, ill.: ibid., fig. 15, in the tiny reliefs there are three scenes of the M?ndh?tar narrative: on the left the cakravartin with seven jewels, further to the right the campaign of conquest and, to the other side of the worship of the Buddha's footprints, the king with Indra. For further similar depictions cf. Knox, op. cit., figs. 68 and 69 (only the throne scene), fig. 77 (campaign of conquest and the throne scene) and fig. 78 (cakravartin with jewels and the throne scene). [17] 315</page><page sequence="18">In elaborate reliefs too, the story could be shown reduced to one single scene. Thus, a medallion from Amaravati shows M?ndh?tar and Indra sitting together on one throne, surrounded by a large number of heavenly women, who embody the joys of sensual pleasures with music and dancing (Fig. 8) (80). The portrayals of the M?ndh?tar story in the Nagarjunikonda school are very similar to those in Amaravati (81). Some of these reliefs show yet another picture. One relief (Fig. 9) (82) portrays the following: between the typical scenes of M?ndh?tar seated with Indra on the same throne above and of M?ndh?tar with his seven jewels below (only the upper border of this picture is preserved, which, however, clearly shows the jewel (83), the elephant and the king's hand), is yet another scene, which apparently takes place after M?ndh?tar's fall to the earth: the seriously ill king is lying on a sofa and is being attended to by several women. Behind his death-bed one can discern the women of his court crying. As far as I am aware, depictions of the M?ndh?tar story in India have, with the exception of Amaravati and Nagarjunikonda, not been recognised (84). Fig. 8.

(83) The portrayals of the gem mani or ratna appear very conventionally in the reliefs and remind one of cows' horns. However, this impression arises due to the weathering of the stone, where the surface of the stone is well preserved, the details of the depiction come to light: ratna has the form of an oval object or one consisting of small pearls, from which flame-shaped rays emanate on both sides. (84) The identification of the so-called S?rya and Indra reliefs in Bhaja as M?ndh?tar is most dubious. This identification was first published by R.G. Gyani, 'Identification of the So-called S?rya and Indra Figures in Cave No. 20 of the Bh?j? Group', Bulletin of the Prince of Wales Museum, 1, 316 [18]</page><page sequence="19">Among the paintings of /?===-- -===- - ??? __ _____j== Central Asia, there is, however, a section of a frieze, which, to M^^^^^^^&gt;i^^^ (^r / all appearances, illustrates our \ ^ " | ^^^0"^^^^^^^^^^/^^ J narrative (85).

Agrawala, Indian Art, Varanasi 1965, pp. 191-92. The identification attempts to bring the known reliefs into accord with the text in Divy?vad?na XVII. In some aspects, however, this is impossible: the text mentions, for example, the Asuras or wishing trees, but does not tell of their destruction.

The Borobudur panels also contain the scene found in India of the two kings on the throne (89), as well as scenes which, although they correspond to the narrative, do not appear specifically in the textual tradition. For example, in one of the last panels one king is turning away from another (90) - it must be Indra, who has recognised M?ndh?tar's sinful thoughts. In one of the first panels a man is approaching an ascetic, while, just to the side, he (?) is handed a pot - it must be the illustration of the motif of the beginning of the father's pregnancy (Fig. 10) (91). Fig. 10. The giving of the water and beside it two other scenes, which show the child, first inside his father, and then at his side, are also to be seen on a Tibetan tanka, which, amongst other things, depicts Indra and M?ndh?tar sitting beside each other on the palatial Sumeru, the depiction is based on the version of the Bodhisattv?vad?nakalpalat? (92). Identification of the M?ndh?tar Story in the Bagh Painting In the Bagh painting too, M?ndh?tar is seated at the same level as Indra, i.e. as an equal; here, however, they are seated on the floor instead of on a shared throne, (88) Krom, op. cit., Ib, pis. 41, 42, 43.

M?ndh?tar is portrayed here without a crown, just as in the two depictions of the campaign of conquest, one showing him on a horse and the other on an elephant, he is portrayed without any headwear. The king's triumphant campaigns to conquer the regions of the world unarmed seem to do more justice to the tendency of the textual tradition than the suppression of the N?gas as shown in Amaravati and Nagarjunikonda, for the cakravartin conquers the regions of the world without the use of weapons, solely through the power of his Dharma. As well as this, the participation of women in this peaceful campaign of conquest conforms to the textual tradition; in the war campaign of a king, the entourage with the royal court is always present (93), which is also stated literally in the texts of the M?ndh?tar narrative (94). Whilst the depiction of the deities hovering in the clouds to the right of Indra's conversation with M?ndh?tar in heaven blends into the series of scenes running from right to left, the two scenes to the right again, i.e. the previously almost identical scenes, demand an explanation. The image of the gods in heaven enjoying dancing and music, and of Indra, the leader of the Gandharvas, as the creator and organiser of the heavenly theatre performances, is fairly common (93) and is also expressed in the southern Indian depictions of Indra's heaven, as we have seen. When the artist in Bagh portrayed this scene twice with only a few insignificant variations between the two, the duplication was intended to express something else too: the P?li tradition states literally that Indra divided his empire and the deities subordinated to him into two halves and gave one half to M?ndh?tar (96); in harmony with this, the artist showed the pleasures of heaven in duplicate. The representation of these heavenly joys as duplication of a heavenly dance is also to be found in literature: in the commentaries to the Dighanik?ya (97) and to the Majjhimanik?ya (98) (93) Kaufiliya Arthas?stra 10.2A (ed. p. 234; transl. p. 435, description of the disposition of troops:) madhye kalatram sw?mi ca. (94) J?taka prose (ed. vol. 2, p. 312): Mandh?t? cakkaratanam abbhukkiritv? attano paris?ya parivuto T?vatims?bhimukho p?y?si... Further it is said that M?ndh?tar continued to be surrounded by people and that in his divine rule he had a human entourage. In the commentary to the TXighanik?ya (ed. vol. 2, p. 482) and the Majjhimanik?ya (ed. vol. 1, p. 226) it is recounted that the inhabitants of the subjected regions of the earth came to Jambhudvipa after M?ndh?tar's death and were allocated their destinations by Parin?yaka, e.g. those from Uttarakuru lived in Kuruksetra from then on. (95) Cf., for instance, the portrayal of heaven in the painting of the possible ways of reincarnation of a human in the wheel of existences (bh?vacakrd) in a painting on the veranda of Cave XVII in Ajanta (ill.: Griffiths, op. at., vol. 1, pi. 56; Yazdani, op. at., vol. 4, pis. 4-7) where the gods are displayed dancing and playing. (96) J?taka prose (ed. vol. 2, p. 312): Sakko... devata dve kotthase katv? attano raj jam majjhe bhinditv? ad?sif (97) Sumahgalav?asini, Dtghanik?yatthakath?, ed. vol. 2, p. 482. (98) Papancas?dani, Majjhimanik?yatthakath?, ed. vol. 1, p. 226. [21] 319</page><page sequence="22">Buddhaghosa says literally that Indra divided the dance into two parts: saddhim n?takehi rajjam dve bh?ge katv? ekam bh?gam ad?si. The scene adjoining the conversation of the two kings on the left, i.e. the next following scene can be easily explained by the parallel depictions in the Nagarjunikonda reliefs. Just like in these, Fig. 9, we see here the mourning women, mourning the death of the king who was thrown back down to earth. The dying king himself, who in Nagarjunikonda appears in the same picture, was probably portrayed in the painting in an adjoining, final scene. According to the textual tradition, we can assume that the king was here portrayed dying and instructing his subjects who were crowding around him ("). Thus, in the preserved parts of the Bagh painting we have the following series of scenes running from right to left: - The first two pictures show the triumphant procession of King M?ndh?tar to the heavenly worlds, in the first scene on his elephant-jewel, in the second in his horse-jewel. - The following picture with a portrayal of a heavenly dance performance in duplicate indicates the division of heaven into two areas, one ruled by Indra, and one ruled by M?ndh?tar. - A group of Apsaras and deities hovering in the clouds point to the heavenly regions, where: - in the scene on the left Indra is sitting in conversation with M?ndh?tar, each accompanied by his minister, - (the king who has been ejected to earth and is dying), is mourned by the women of his court. The immediately adjoining scenes to the right, i.e. the first scenes of the painting, of which no copies exist, still remain to be identified. From Impey s description as corrected by Vogel, it follows that here at least two scenes were depicted. The scene on the left is supposed to have portrayed several horses as well as elephants, of which the back of the animal standing furthest to the left is still visible in the copy. The people acting in this scene are supposed to have dismounted from the animals and gathered around the central point of the scene, namely a holy tree, under which vessels with water were placed on stands. In the adjacent scene on the right, that is, the previous scene, an ascetic is assumed to be instructing a man. (") J?taka prose (ed. vol. 2, p. 313) tells that the king, who fell from heaven into his own park, was found by his gardener, who informed the family. In T 152 (Chavannes, op. tit., vol. 1, p. 141) the seriously ill king appeals to his successor not to repeat his mistake. After his death this warning is repeated. In T 202 = Der Weise und der Thor (transl. p. 375) the king, having fallen down in front of the dilapidated gate of his former palace, instructs many people. All Sanskrit versions emphasise his repentance and his willingness to instruct people (Divy?vad?na XVII, ed. p. 224; Tibetan Tales, p. 19) or to give away his property (Panglung, op. tit., p. 36). 320 [22]</page><page sequence="23">The key to the identification of these first two scenes is to be found in depiction of the vessels with water and the ascetic. We can assume that these scenes portrayed the events leading up to M?ndh?tar 's unnatural birth: in the first scene (on the right) the childless king asks the ascetic for a son and in the following scene (on the left) he gets the magic water. Or, possibly, the scenes were to be read the other way around: in the scene on the left, the king has drunk of the magic water and then (on the right) he is instructed by the ascetic on the consequences of his deed. The panel of Borobudur (our Fig. 10) probably portrays the same events. This motif, often repeated in Brahman texts, of M?ndh?tar's father drinking the magic water by mistake, is unknown in most texts of Buddhist tradition or else is ignored by them, in order to avoid acknowledging that the ascetic has any power. Apart from the P?li tradition, which does not mention M?ndh?tar's extraordinary birth at all, in most Buddhist sources it is recounted that M?ndh?tar was born out of the soft growth on his father's head, without, however, giving any reason for this 'pregnancy' (10?). However, the motif of the magic water does appear in the Buddhist tradition in the Bodhisattv?vad?nakalpalat? collection of stories of the poet Ksemendra (101), originating in the M?lasarv?stiv?da tradition. In this version it is told that King Uposadha undertook a journey, in order to visit various different ascetic settlements in his country. He came to a place where the Rsis had just prepared the water that causes pregnancy. The king, thirsty after his journey, drank the water before anyone could stop him and was then instructed by the ascetics about the special quality of this water. Thus one can assume that the first two scenes at the right-hand end of the Bagh painting, known to us only from their descriptions, depicted these events. The monastery complex of Bagh with the common veranda in front of Caves IV and V, supported by no less than 20 pillars and over 70 m in length, must have been one of the most impressive cave monasteries of its time. For the longest continuous wall, the one between the entrances to the two caves, one of the most famous and most meaningful stories of a world ruler, who finally is destroyed because he yields to the temptation of absolute power, was chosen. Greed and the desire for power can never lead to contentment and the right way of life is to be found inside a monastery: Not though a rain of coins fall from the sky Could anything be found to satisfy. Pain is desire, and sorrow is unrest: He that knows this is wise, and he is blest. Where longing is, there pleasure takes him wings, Even though desire be set on heavenly things. Disciples of the Very Buddha try To crush out all desire eternally. (102) (10?) Cf. n. 36. (101) Bodhisattv?vad?nakalpalat? IV. 2-11, ed. p. 38.
