THE THREE BODIES OF A BUDDHA (TRIKAYA). /^\NE of the more interesting features of the Great Vehicle, or Mahiiyana School of Buddhism, is the system of the Three Bodies. Being at first a ' Buddhology,' a speculative doctrine of the Buddhahood, this system was afterwards made to cover the whole field of dogmatic, of ontology, and was in particular substituted for the antiquated ' dependent origination' (pratityasamutpada). At first the Buddhas alone had three ' Bodies' ; afterwards the whole universe was looked upon as residing in or made of the Bodies. Later, or by parallel development, new mythological, mystic, and physiological reveries caused serious alterations of the primitive ' triniturian' form, and in particular the addition of two more Bodies to the ' classical' ones; and the Tantric school, in its own fanciful, mystic, and theurgic way, reduced the speculative system to a mere practical method of Yoga. Much has been written by several scholars on the Trikaya. The latter form of the triniturian theory, its philosophical aspects, and its points of contact with Hindoo cosmologies have been thoroughly elucidated by the able observations of Professor Kern ; whereas Wassilieff has thrown some light on its older signification, we mean the theological and truly 1 Soo Journal Asiatique, 1902, ii. 237; 1003, ii, 358; Maseon, 1905, 178.?The MS. ot the present article has been kindly revised by ])r.

There are also documents on the Tantric aspect of the three or five Bodies scattered in the works on later or Tibetan Buddhism.1 It seems, nevertheless, that something remains to be said. There is no hope of fully illustrating the antecedents, the growth, and the numerous alterations of the dogma under examination, as it is too intimately connected with Buddhist dogmatic as a whole and the history of the schools. But even if our researches should be completely wanting in chronological accuracy, and even fruitless as concerns the historical development of the Faith, we are confident that they will to some extent ascertain the meaning of some important Buddhist tenets. At least it is interesting to gather new original documents and to collect the interpretations which have been presented by native or European authorities. It is a common misfortune when dealing with Indian or Buddhist topics that comprehensive and detailed accounts are far from being clear, and that intelligible summaries aro always somewhat misleading. The genuine methods of the Indian thought are on the ono hand the genial but incoherent effusions of the Brahmana - Upanisads, on tho other the pedantic categories of the Brahmanie or Buddhist ' matrkas' (compilations of technical terms). The Buddhists of old, as a rule, scarcely realize what they mean, and the best scholastical interpreters had to organize the obscuro or contradictory statements and nomenclatures of the Sutras. Therefore, tradition must be squeezed through a filter if one wants coherent theories. This very case offers special difficulties, because the philosophical views are mixed together with 1 8ee H.

We shall endeavour to make out the prominent lines of the diverging theories, and to characterize their mutual relations. The expose of the sources will enable the reader to correct or to complete our very imperfect sketch. General view of the matter. I. The doctrine of the Trikaya as Buddhology, after its completion, but yet free from ' ontological' and costnogonic speculations. (A) The very nature of a Buddha is the Bodhi (En lightenment), or Braj ni? pit ram ita (Perfect Wisdom), or knowledge of the Law (Dharma), i.e. of the absolute Truth. By acquiring this knowledge, nirvana is realized in pot cut ia or in acta The Dharmakaya, Body of Law, of a Buddha is the Buddha in nirvana or in nirvana-like rapture (samadhikaya = dharmakaya). (B) A Buddha, as long as he is not yet merged into nirvana, possesses and enjoys, for his own sake and for others' welfare, the fruit of his charitable behaviour as a Bodhisattva. The second body is the Body of Enjoyment or Beatific Body (saihbhoga kaya). (C) Human beings known as Buddhas are magical contrivances (niriniinakiiya) created at random by real Buddhas, i.e. by Buddhas possessed of beatific bodies, sovereigns of celestial worlds, Tusita-heavens or 'Paradises' (Sukha va tls). II. The doctrine of Trikaya as an ontologic and cosmologic system.</page><page sequence="4">946 THE THREE BODIES OF A BUDDHA. (A) By Body of Law one has to understand the void and permanent reality that underlies every phe nomenon (dharma), or the store of the ' dharmas/ or more exactly the uncharaeterized Intellect (vijftuna). (B) Body of Enjoyment is the Dharmakiiya evolved as Being, Bliss, Charity, Radiance, or tho Intellect as far as it is individualized as Buddha or Bodhi sattva. (C) Magical or rather Transformation's Body is the same Intellect when defiled, when individualized as 'common people* (prthagjana), infernal being, etc. I. DHAliMAKAYA, BODY OF THE LAW. Whatever be, in Mahayiinist books, the precise meaning of 4 dharmakiiya,'l we are taught that this is tho true Body of a Buddha.

The Doctrine of the Dharmakaya as Buddicolooy. (1) The material body of Buddha contrasted with Buddha as the Law embodied. As early hints or foreshadowings of the ' Body of Law/ ono can quote the identification of the Law with the Buddha, to bo met frequently in the Pali literature: " To see the Law is to see the Buddha." To follow Sakyamuni and to touch his robe is not to sec the Buddha : " He is far from me and I am far from him, because he has not seen the Law."8 The meaning seems to bo that, when one has understood the Dharma, i.e. the doctrine of dependent origination (pratltya samutpiida),3 one has seen the best of a Buddha, one has reached everything that can be derived from a Buddha. Preachers first and foremost and preachers only,4 the Buddhas are the 'embodied law* or the 'living law'; in had supporters) is the Dharma something really existing; not so for tho Idealists of the Mabayana: according to them Dharma is a production of the mind, of the Samvrti, and therefore an appearance, a kuya, a body : therefore the Mahayanist can consider the Body of the Law like the two others, as an apparent mani festation of the sole and real being."] 1 think that the ' svabhtivika kaya ' as a fourth body is a Tantrie conception (see below, p. 077). We are said in the Amrtakanika, a commentary to the Namasamglti (v. 156), that the Law-body (styled ' yiigaiiaddhakaya'), *to be known by tho ascetic in himself, is different from the ' saiiibhogikakaya } (Enjoy ment-body) and from tbe ' svabhtivika' (the very Body, etc.). 1 Kfdacakra, quoted ad Namasamglti, Amrtakanika, v. 92. 2 See Minayeif, Uechcrches, p. 218, n. 2.?Mahapariuibbanas. 60; Itivattaku, 91. 12; Sam.

Further, the phrase dharmakaya, with the same import, in the Divyavadanal and in a Jataka,* contrasted with rupakdya or bhutikdya, ' material, visible body.' Srona Kotikarna wanted to see the material body of the Master; he had but seen the Buddha in his Law-body, that is to say, he knew the sacred books, of which he gives a very interesting list. In fact, ' dharmakaya' can be and is understood as an equivalent of ' dharmasamuha,9 the collections of the books, the second jewel (ratna).3 Chinese authorities confirm this distinction of tho two bodies : " Primitive Buddhism (hi China)," says Eitel, "distinguished a material, visible, and perishable body (riipnkaya) and an immaterial, invisible, and immortal body (dharmakaya) as attributes of [Buddha's] human existence." 4 It would perhaps be moro exact to state that the ' material body ' of a Buddha is his ' body,' endowed with the marks which ho already possesses as a Bodhisattva5; whereas his 'soul' or his knowledge is his Body of Law, eternal and inalterable, a " series of undeliled principles," 6 the same in all the Tathagatas, aud beyond the range of thought: " The Buddhas ought to be looked upon as equivalent to the Dharma; tho leaders indeed are the Dharma embodied ; the nature of the Dharma is beyond the discriminative powers of mind." 7 1 SeoDiv. 19. 11, 20. 23. 2 See the story of Upagupta, ibid. 356 (Windisch, Mara und Buddha, 161).

It is the knowledge of the truth (tattvajfmna), the 'arriving at* or understanding the truth (adhigama = dharma),1 that makes a Buddha. A Buddha's mind is made of the 'knowledge of the non-birth of anything' (anutpadajfifina).8 Now the true knowledge being styled ' Dharma' or ' Prajmlparamita,' there is no wonder that the Buddha's real nature should be defined as ' dharma' or 'prajiiaY whereas ' pra j nil ' is styled the mother of the Tathagatas. We read that "Prajila is the real body of the Tathagatas";3 that "all the Buddhas, past, present, and future, have for body the Dharma."4 Prajilakaramati, the commentator of Siintideva's Bodhi caryavatiira, well illustrates this topic: "The Bodhi or Buddhahood is the absolute (paramartha0) reality; empty of any essence, be it unique or multiple; neither born, nor extinct; neither perishing, nor permanent; free from any cogitable contingency, cether-like; it has for name Dharmakdya.

In short, the ' Body of Law' of a Buddha is his possessing Nirvana in acta or in potentia, as Occidental scholastics would say. The synonym, given by a Tantric Commentary, ' samddhikdya,9 ' the state of highest trance/ is a very good one.1 Just as an Aupanisadie ascetic merges into Brahman during dreamless sleep, in the same way tho Buddhist adepts in 'unconscious abstraction* realize the Body of Law, but for a time only. The Bodhisattva, on the contrary, since he has becomo a Buddha, does not abandon the state of trance,2 i.e. his never to be abandoned real Body. 2. Dhakmakaya as an Ontological Principle. The dialectic of the old Suttantas, put in the best scholastical frame by tho Miidhyamikas and already driven to its last results in the PrajiliTparamita books, seems to be such as to prevent any positive system. It aims at an absolute denial of the reality of anything, substance or appearance. Not only the old lesson on ' soullessness' (nairatmya) coupled with ' dependent origination,' excludes the notion of being, and reduces the whole world to a process of becoming (irdvra pel), but enquiries on causality, on ' lnoincntaneity,' on the theory of knowledge, turn to the negation of the very becoming of things. The ' saihsuru' is a mere show, like the water in a mirage, like the daughter of a barren woman. Nor is nirvana or Buddha anything: "The Buddhas are names only, aud it there bo any more distinguished (visista) a thing than a Buddha, 1 should say it is a mere name." Everything merges into void; but the distinction of the two truths provides the doctors with 1 Amrtakauika ad Namasamglti, v. 146.?See J. de Groot, Code du Mahayana, p. 16.?Perfect samadhi, however, is said to be the characteristic of the sambhogakaya (Trikaya, translated by llockbill, p. 200). 2 Sec the sources quoted iu Bodbicaryavatara, ix, 36, aud also J.B.A.S. 1902, p. 374, n. 1.</page><page sequence="9">THE THREE BODIES OF A BUDDHA. 951 a rather solid basis for tho establishing of a Path (relative truth) leading to nirvana (highest truth or void).1 Nay, actual voidness is a postn/atum of this very Path! If thero were something, this ' something' could not be extinguished. In fact, like the Buddhists of old, the Madhyamikas are almost exclusively interested in final release (moksa) ; and, in general, one may say that the Orthodox (amongst whom are tho Madhyamikas) have elaborated metaphysics (skandha - theory, dependent origi nation, void, momentaneity) chiefly to support their eschatology and the practices leading to one's end, be it Arhatship or magnified Buddhahood. There are many Sutras (scriptural texts) and Siistras (treatises) to inform us whither are going the Arhats and the Buddhas, i.e. the purified or magnified individual beings; they are going to nirviina alias Buddhahood or dharmakiiya. And the good middle Path is also fully described. But whence come the individual beings? The Orthodox, the Madhyamikas in chief, content themselves with stating that there is a term to saiiisiira, au apex or limit of being (bhfitakoti), but that ' saihsara ' or 'becoming' has had no beginning. But the constructive Vijfianavndins attach themselves to the realistic clues forwarded by the nihilistic speculation.2 The ' equivalences/ established by nihilistic speculation, are indeed pregnant with positive surmises. Granted that ' things' and Buddhas are equally void, it follows 1 See Journal Asiatique, 1903, ii, 358. 2 The attitude of the Madhyamikas can be appreciated from their authoritative treatises (Madhyaimikusiitrus and commentaries) and IVniii the criticisms of the Yogacaras = Yijiiauavadins, who style, them sarravaindiikas aud ndsttkas. However, it is difficult to state exactly the contributions of the two great Mahayana schools to the theories which will be summarized below. Our observations, so far as the historical relations of the schools are concerned, are possibly wanting in accuracy: Santideva is some times named amongst the Madhyamika, sometimes amongst the Yogacaras. In short, by Madhyamika we mean the purely critical and negative system of the Madhyainakasfitrus, by Yogucara ihe system of Asvaghosa.</page><page sequence="10">952 THE THREE BODIES OF A BUDDHA. that ordinary beings and Buddhas are possessed of the same nature. Further ' saihsiira' = ' nirvana,' but there is no doubt that nirvana' = Buddhahood. Thus the Void (= nairiihnya, pratityasamutpada) was from the first less or more tinged with mystic colours; it was identified with the Pra j nil, which, to speak correctly, is but the knowledge of the universal nothingness; it became apt to bear a more or less definite ontologicai meaning under the name of 4 Dharmakaya,' which associates it with immortal * Nirvana' or Buddhahood. From the very statement that everything is ' void/ chaotic speculation would draw the conclusion that every thing is evolved out of the 4 void.' Absolute nothingness or nirvana is the perfect wisdom, Huddhahood, the Law body ; it is tho absolute truth (paramarthasatya) and tho only reality: the doctrine is near at hand that the process of purification taught by all the .schools (ryaraddna, 1 common people (prthagjana), 2 bodhisattva, 3 biuldha, dharmakaya) is but the counterpart of a process of defilement (samkteiu), from dharmakaya down to prthagjanatva. Old Buddhism was indeed, mutatis mutandis, a theory and a method of going back into the Brahman.' The school of the Yijfianavadins, out of genuine Buddhist tenets, gfinyatii = buddhatva = dharinata, nirvana = saihsiira, has evolved a positive system of emanation. Unlike the Madhyamikas, who identify tho 'Void' with momentaneity and caused origination, unlike the redactors of the Prajiia, who play rather with words than with ideas, the Yijfianavadins, ' supporters of the existence of the only Intellect,' maintain that the 'Void,' as emphasized by the Sacred Books, is * the absence of characteristics,' and really designates a * something.'l " For Vacuity to be a justifiable position, we must have, firstly, existence of that which is empty (the receptacle), and then non-existence of that in 1 One can refer to the Sutras that the school of the Yogacaras stylo ' Sutras of exact meaning/1 see Wassilicff, p. 302. The Mahabheii goes so far as to say that Tathagata is possessed of a permauent bliss, of a pure self, not of Nirvaua, etc. (ibid., 162).</page><page sequence="11">THE THItEE BODIES OF A BUDDHA. 9-5-3 virtue of which it is empty (the contents) ; but, if neither exists, how can there be vacuity ? In objects to which ' notes' such as form and the like arc commonly attributed, there are not really such 'notes/ but the substrate of the designations such as form exists in the same way as there is a rope on which serpent's notion is superimpose*]. Tho denotable properties do not exist." l Now the undenotable real 'something' or 'mere thing* (vasturnatra) is further defined as Intellect (vijiiana), receptacle or quiescent intellect (illuyuvijiiiina),3 according to the general tenet of the school that the things are only mental representations. The ' going on' (pravrtti), or particularizing evolution, or defilement (sumklesa) of Intellect, byr work or thinking, is what is called 'saihsiira/ and by ' nirvana' nothing else can be meant than the purification (vyavadiina) of Intellect, its restoration to its primitive void or radiant transparence (prabhas varata). Here we find an adequate basis for the interpretation of the mystic nomenclature of the Prajnaparamitiis: dharma kiiyu, tathatii, tathagatagarbha, further dhurmadhatu and garbhadhatu, etc. a. By Tathatii, better Bhiitatathata, ' Suchness/ ' True nature/ stress is laid upon the primitive and permanent non diiforcntiution or uiihoterogoneity of everything. We might compare the ?Saiitkhyu ' Nature' or pradhdna? As far as it is evolved and differentiated, Nature is an illusion (mnya), and when non-evolved it is like a pure void (sfinyata). /3.

But this womb of the Buddhas is at the same time their cemetery, since the ' being a Buddha' (buddhatva), the 'being a Tathiiguta,' i.e. the 'being arrived at true knowledge/ can by no means be realized as long as the very idea of a distinction remains. (2) The ma trice of every pseudo-individual being. The Lankit vatiira describes the Womb as " genuinely radiant and pure, bearer of the thirty-two marks, present in all beings, like a precious gem covered by dirt, covered by the skandhas, the dhdtus, and the dyatanas; defiled by the wrong imagi nations due to love, hatred, and error ; permanent, firm, blessed, everlasting."1 "But is not such doctrine of a Tathagata - Womb identical to the doctrine of Atman supported by the non-believers?" The sutra formulates this objection, and clearly states that one must not separate the doctrine of the Tathagatagarbha and the doctrine of soullessness (nairatmya) : " Like a pot-maker who would mould different kinds of pots with the same mass of clay, the Buddha teaches the soullessness sometimes directly, sometimes under the veil of the Tatlulgata's AVomb."2 Indeed, neither the Tathagatagarbha nor tho Pra j nil is a 4 self'; they are identical with? 7.

The ' Dharmakaya,' 'the Body of Law of all the Tatha gatas,' is the most remarkable and probably the oldest amongst these synonymous terms. Since Buddhahood, according to the quasi-universal tenet of the Great Vehicle, is a necessary condition of nirvana; ! since every creature is hoped to become a Buddha; since Buddhahood consists in actual cessation or purification of thought; since thought could never be purified if it were 'really' defiled; since every individual being is but mere illusion, it is obvious to consider Buddhahood, i.e. the Body of Law, as the real and ' really' unmodified nature of everything. A good definition of the Dharmakaya is furnished by a stanza, possibly of Nagarjuna(?), and known to us from a Chinese transcription of Fa-t'icn.2 It runs as follows:? "Homage to the incomparable Law-body of the Conquerors, which is neither one nor multiple, which supports the great blessing of salvation for oneself and for one's neighbour, which neither exists nor exists not, which like the ether is homogenous, whose own nature is unmanifested, which is 1 It is more difficult to obtain Arhatship than to obtain Buddha hood, because it is next to impossible to abandon the sin-hindrance without pity (kiiruita). One must, moreover, remark that the knowledge of the ' void' is a necessary condition ; people who believe in a future 4 nirvana/ as the Arhats of the old schools, cannot reach it by any means. 2 Published aud read by Sylvain Levi as a part of Ed. Chavannos's first article on tho " Inscriptions chinoises de Bodh Gayfi" (lievue de PHistoiro des lleligion*, xxxiv, 1, 1896). See Nanjio, No. 1072; Fn-t'icn, 982 a.i&gt;. Tbe Chinese document contains tho adoration of tho three. Bodies, plus a concluding stanza. A com mentary of the Namasamglti quotes in full the stanzas 2 and .'5 (saihbhogakaya, nirmanakfiya); it gives us the first words of the stanza 1 (dharma) and of a fourth stanza (mahasukhakava; ?

It is the supporter of Buddhahood, by which every Buddha realizes his own aim and universal welfare. It is uumanifcsted, being free from ' form' (artipa).3 It is transcendent, being free from any cogitable characteristic (prapafica). As it is the universal pervader, everybody can recognize it as his true self;4 and there is not another way of knowing it, as it is uncogitable and out of the range of words.5 From the above representation it follows that the Body of Law is a purely metaphysical conception, alien to any mythological exegesis. But, as a matter of fact, although every Buddha has for 'dharmakaya' the unique' dhnrmakiiya,' every Buddha has been said to have his own ' dharmakaya' and receives under this aspect special denominations: thus, whereas Amitabha and Aksobhya are ' dharniakiiyas,' Ainitiiyus and Vajrasattva respectively are their ' sambhoga kayas.'

Further, as Maiijusri is from of old a personification of Wisdom or 'prajfta,' it is said to be by excellence the jiidnukdya ( = dharmakaya). Nevertheless, in the Tantras and in the modern monothcist school, the Body of Law is named Vairocana,1 Vajrasattva, or Adi Buddha. It seems that Vairocana, ' the Radiant,' or the mythological delegate to ' dharmakayatva,' whatever be his name, is the complete or integral Dharmakaya, being made of the ii\c 'sciences' or constituents of Prajfia ; whereas the five Jinas (Dhyani buddhas) are parts of the Dharmakaya, each of these being the personification of one ' science.' We cannot insist on these details, as they are later than the full development of the doctrine under examination, and generally admit of a fourth and even a fifth Body (ananda0, paramananda0, vajraknya, etc.). But to show the speculative deficiency of these theories of the Dhynnibuddhas, we will observe that sometimes the best amongst the Jinas are not placed higher than tho Akanistha abode, i.e. in the very world of Form, whereas the Dharmakiiya is by definition ' immaterial ' (ariipiu).* II.

Antecedents of the Sambhogakaya's Theory. The phrase 'dharmakaya' does not occur in the oldest literature, but it is clearly foreshadowed by such expressions as arc mentioned above (p. 947, n. 2). On the contrary, I fear that not a single trace of a ' saihbhogakaya ' has been met with in the books of the Little Vehicle. Wc never theless are told that the JSautriintikas did admit both Law and Enjoyment bodies; yet we are not able to test this assertion of WassilicfT.3 Be that as it may, let us observe that the theory according to which the Tathiigatas may choose to live during a 'cosmic period' or the rest of the period ;4 that the tenets concerning the Uddhaihsota, a kind of ' never returning saints ' (aniigiimin) who will go up the heavens to the Akanittha abode before reaching nirvana;5 that the sculptures of 1 Kern : " Het lichaam waarvan de genietingen volkomen zijn" (op. cit., p. 71).?St. Julien: " Le corps de la jouissance, Fetat de cclui qui a pu uuir son intelligence avec la nature subtile de la loi."?Csoma: " The most perfect Being."?Jaschke : "The body of happiness or glory, Buddha in the perfection of a conscious and active life of bliss in the second world (heaven or Elysium)."? &amp;arad Candra (p. 91) has: afc;*| ?fo . gfuj*|. jj^ . *? = ? celestial existence.' - But seo Eitel, Handbook (p. 179): "Buddha was said to be living, at the same time, in three different spheres, viz., (1) . . . ; (2) as living iu reflex in the rupadhatu, and being, as such, in the intermediate degree ol'a Dhyaui Bodhisattva in the Samhliogakfiya state of reflected Bodhi."

Tho orthodox schools of the Little Vehicle well stated the fact that, since " the Buddhas arc only preachers,1' the worship of the Buddhas is a mere eult of commemoration ; that there is no difference, as concerns the benefits to be drawn from him, between living or extinguished Buddha.2 But, on the other hand, it was by no means held certain, even by the compilers of the Piili Nikiiyas, that the Tathiigatas do not exist after death.3 And one cannot help thinking that the vulgar worshippers of the Buddha, of his relics, of his symbols and icons, believed in some existence of their deceased god, did not pay much attention to the dogmatic of the scholars, did not even dream of a pujd whose devafd were extinguished and no more to be seen by gods or by men. 2.

Some beings long for others' welfare: these are of the stock and breeding of the Bodhisattvas who make a firm resolve to obtain Buddhahood 1 See Gruuwcdcl, Buddhistische Kunst2, p. 170. 2 The author of the Milinda perfectly agrees with &amp;antideva (Bodhicaryavatara). 8 See Oidenberg's Buddha.</page><page sequence="18">960 THE THREE BODIES OP A BUDDHA. in order to teach the Law and to secure universal happiness in their future kingdoms or ' fields of a Buddha' (buddha ksetra). Carried out during numerous 'periods' tho 'vow* of the Bodhisattvas will succeed in the end; and thus wo seo that, according to their more or less generous principles and behaviour as Bodhisattvas, the Buddhas govern more or less glorious universes, with their hells, their ordinary worlds, their paradises or Sukhavatls: in the case of Amitabba, tho whole ' Held of Buddha ' is a paradise exclusively peopled by holy beings. The Buddhas, who differ as concerns radiance, length of life, etc., reign as colossal figures framed of light and surrounded with ' halos' made of created or magical Buddhas. Their fellow-workers, or more accurately?as tho Buddhas content themselves with attitudes of teaching, of meditating, of appeasing?their officers, the Bodhisattvas of high rank, masters of the ten Bodhisattva-stages (dasa bhumlsvara), possess, like their kings or patrons, beatific bodies. But, as a rule, they bear ou the head a smaller image of the Buddha whom they attend. It happens that the body of a Bodhisattva is no less marvellous than any Buddha's body can be, and e.g. in the case of Avalokita we have a description of a ' glorious body' which proves of great interest. Avalokita's body is either an enthroned image at the side of Amitiibha ! or the receptacle of the whole chiliocosm: in each of the pores of his skin there are worlds with hosts of meditating or singing worthies.2 One finds in the Bhagavadgltii a good parallel of this cosmological-theological doctrine: we mean the eleventh lesson, where Ilari shows to Arjuna " his sovran form supreme, framed of radiance, universal, boundless "; it bears some anthropomorphic features, just as the fantastical icon of Amitabba does in Suklulvati; but "the whole universe in its manifold divisions is solely lodged in it."3 The relation 1 Sukha vat ivy fiha. * See Juuandavyfiha apud Burnouf, lntr., p. 224.

And again, the third body of a Buddha, as we shall see later on, has something in common with the human and 'unnatural' form of Krsna. (b) The preceding account is drawn from various sources.1 Wc are happy to meet a still better piece of theology in the little poem mentioned above. The Fa-t'ion's stanza, as T may venture to stylo it, describes the Stnhbltogukiiya in every particular: "Homage to the Enjoyment-Body, which develops in the middle of the (holy) assembly for the joy of the meditative saints, his large, manifold, supramundane, uncogitablc manifestation, acquired by numberless good actions, which shines into all the Buddha's worlds, which uninterruptedly emits the sublime sound of the good Law, which is enthroned in the great kingship of the Law."2 Unlike the Dharmakaya,3 the Enjoyment-body is visible (rfipuvan), manifested (vibhutim . . prathayati), although it is 'made of mind' or 'spiritual.' Its manifestation is above the [three] worlds [of love, form, non-form], beyond explication (acintyu), made for the joy of the ' meditating' (dhiinatiim),4 i.e. of the Bodhisattvas, who alone can behold it in rapture, and are, as it were, already Buddhas (yathii bodhipriipta). It emits uninterruptedly the good preaching, and therefore is elsewhere named 'collection of sounds' (rutarasi).5 It is the very body of the King of the Law (dharmarilja): it bears the thirty-two marks of a Buddha. 1 Sukhavutlvvuhas (147-186 a.d.), Amitayurdhyanasutra (424 a.a.), Kfirandavyuhu (?). 1 lokatltain aeintyaiii Kukrtasataphalam atmano yo vibhutiih | parsumnadhye vicitram prathayati mahatlm dhlmutam pritihetoh | buddhiinfim sarvalokaprasptam aviratmlarasaddharmaghosaih | vande saihbhogakayam tarn aham ilia mahadharmarajyapratistham || 3 1 add some details from the commentaries of the Namasamglti. 4 Dhimfin = bodhisattva, see Mahavyutpatti, 22. 3, and Bodhi caryavatarapaiijika, p. 23. 2. 5 Sec above, p. 954, n. 3.</page><page sequence="20">962 THE THREE BODIES OF A BUDDHA. As far as a Buddha can be visible?the problem shall bo debated later on?this body of Enjoyment is his real visible body (svdbhdvikarupakdya). (2) Sambhagakdya and Ninmdnakdya in their relation to Dharmakaya. Candrakirti, in fact, uses the phrase rupakdya as a synonym of Sambhogakiiya, and contrasts it with tho dharmakaya. His observations on this topic well deserve attention, as they illustrate the relations between the Body of Law, or ' voidness,' and the Body of Enjoyment, which seems to belong to the ' world of becoming.' In his own commentary to his Madhyamakavatiira,l Candrakirti states that the ' equipment of knowledge' (jiiiina sambhsira), i.e. the full achievement in meditation (dhyann) and wisdom (pra j nil), causes the Body 'consisting in Dharma,' 'whose characteristic is no-birth' (anutpada); whereas ' equipment of merit' (puiiyasaihbhiira), i.e. long and energetic practice of gift, morality, and patience, is tho cause of tho rupakdya of the perfect Lords Buddhas, "endowed with the mark of hundred merits, marvellous, ineogitable, and multiform."2 This last epithet, methiiiks, alludes to the Body's 1 Chapter iii, v. 12, pp. 62-63 of the forthcoming edition iu Bibl. Buddhica. Oar translation is from the Tibetan ; the original Sanskrit would run as follows: tatra yah punyasambharah sa bhagavat am samyaksambuddhanam &amp;itapunyalak$auavato Mbhutfj cintyasya lmnarfipasya rupnkayasva hetuh ; dharmatmakasya ka yasya amitpadalaksnnnsya jiianasambharo hetuh. 2 A synonym of rupakdya is vipdkakdya, * the body where is enjoyed [tho merit of good acts]* (A?vaghosa, Suzuki, p. 102).? The fragment of the Prajiiaparamita quoted Siksasamuccaya, 244, [bodhisattvena . . . buddhakdyam nispaduyitukamena dva triiusanmahapurusalaksanauy asltim canuvy an janani pratilabdhu kameua . . . ], clearly alludes to a rUpakdya; but it scorns that the human body of Buddha is meant.

The reader of Mahayanist treatises, whether Madhyamika or Yogiicaru, is frequently confronted with the doctrine that Buddhahood is the result of the two so-called 'equip ments' (saihbhiira), knowledge (jniina) and merit (punva), or wisdom (prajilfi) and charity (karunii); these are the two wings without which the bird cannot fly. Charity, morality, and patience, without wisdom, arc blind, do not even deserve the name of Piiramitas. Conversely, although wisdom be the unique way to Buddhahood, nay, Buddhahood itself, it requires a purified ground to grow in ; merit, therefore, is only a mediate means, but a necessary means, to the reaching of Buddhahood. The theorem of Candrakirti, as wc may call his above quoted saying, illustrates this topic with a new light, and teaches us a double lesson. The first is easy enough to understand ; the second requires more attention. 1. If the 'equipment of merit' causes the 'beatific body,' no wonder that the Bodhisattvas partake of it with the Buddhas themselves; some of them, heroes of compassionate behaviour, have indeed better claims to its possession than such and such a Pratyekabuddha-like Buddha. Further, Bodhisattvas are not deficient in wisdom; they remain in the world, because they are compassionate, but they think, act, speak, etc., without being defiled, because they are 'purified by Prajiia.' They have claims to all 'Buddha principles' or Buddha's qualifications (buddhadharina), but do not as yet realize them (na saksiitkurvanti). 2. Candrakirti suggests to ns that the ' Knjoyment-Body' is something real, from the point of view of practical truth, even as concerns the Buddhas who are perfectly accomplished, who have 2&gt;erfectly understood and reached the Dharmakaya, i.e. the Vacuity. There is indeed a double-edged problem, as Milinda would say. Granted that the Buddhas have achieved the equipment of knowledge, and are merged into the Dharmakaya, how can they be possessed of a ' sambhogakiiya' P Inversely,</page><page sequence="22">964 THE THREE BODIES OF A BUDDHA. how can they be styled Buddhas if they havo not achieved the equipment of knowledge ? On the one hand, in the later literature under examination, Buddhahood is commonly defined as twofold : (1) Full realization of the Law-Body, pure and void knowledge, non production of thought. (2) The immaterial yet visible image in the Paradise, such as Sakyamuni in the Lotus, Amitiibha in the Sukhavatls.? And Candrakirti soems to agree with this Buddhology. On the other hand, even from the point of view of practical truth, Bodhisattvas sink into nothingness by the very reaching of Buddhahood, and therefore Buddhas are only possessed of the 'body of Law/ that is to say, a 'non-body.' How can Enjoyment-body be predicated of them ? Two answers may be given:? (A) The scholastical or philosophical answer can easily be drawn from some well - attested principles: the Buddha's ' sambhogakaya/ fruit of his charitable behaviour, does indeed exist as concerns the Bodhisattvas who behold it; but it does not exist as far as the Huddha himself is con cerned, since a Buddha, from the very moment of Supreme Enlightenment, has abandoned the world of becoming for the everlasting ' dharmakiiya.' Sakyamuni on the Vulture-Peak in the Lotus, or Amitiibha, etc., no more exist than the Buddhas of old whose miraculous stupas enrich the ' fields' of Buddhas. Owing to his equipment of knowledge a Bodhisattva at last realizes his own aim and sinks into Buddhahood, i.e. ' nirvana without residue.' His equip ment of merit, which has caused the storing of knowledge, causes, par sitrcroit, even after nirvana, the welfare of the creatures, and that in the following way. Although ex tinguished?and extinguished he must be since he is a Buddha?the Buddha will be seen for thousands of cosmic periods as ' sambhogakaya' and as ' niriniinakaya/ that is to say, endowed with a glorious and beatific body or with a human frame, according as the ripening of Bodhisattvas or the conversion of men is to be promoted. Buddha's former merits cause the delusion, the joy, and the salvation of</page><page sequence="23">THE THREE BODIES OF A BUDDHA. 965 the beings who behold him under various aspects. More explicitly, his sura bounding good karma n has been ' pariniimita' or ' turned to others' welfare,'l and will fructify for others. When this immeasurable store of merit is at last nearly exhausted, the ideal image of the Glorious Body will fade away, Tathiigata's earthly apparitions (nirmanaksiva) will come to an end, and a stupa will appear, less effective than the apparently living Tathiigata was, but still an abundant principle of benediction. I venture to believe that Candrakirti's answer would be such or approximate to it.2 (The point of view of the Yogaeiiras will be presently illustrated, see pp. 967-8.) (B) But, beyond doubt, such a system will not prove satisfactory historically. Without underestimating scholastical tenets, which can often be ascertained, and the deductions we may draw from them, which may be sound, without being over-anxious to understand the doctrines in their historic shape, generally to be only guessed by doubtful yet prudent assumptions, one is overcome with the conviction that the Buddhists have not commonly framed their philosophical terms and concepts with the same precision as wc do; nor do they carry any principle to its legitimate consequences. Whereas we are led, by their apparent earnestness, to suppose that they are building coherent theories, we afterwards too often ascertain that they have been indulging in reveries, sharpening arms for disputes, or framing at random nomenclatures and mystic identifications. The long labours of the compilers of the 1 And, in so many words, turned " in order that they could be reborn in purified Buddha's fields," etc. See Siksfisamuceava, p. 32. 2 There is, it may be, another answer bearing on the difference between 'nirvana with residue * or 'nirvana in poVntm" and 'nirvana without residue' or 'nirvana in actu.' But. granted that there are material elements (rftpa), it is quite possible t?? under stand what 'nirvana with residue* may be: the survival of the material body after extinction or liberation of thought. But, according to the Mahayanist tenets, there is no matter in the case of dignified saints.</page><page sequence="24">966 THE THREE B0DIE8 OF A BUDDHA. Suttantas, of the Madhyamika doctors, of the Digniiga's school of logic succeeded, indeed, in making out a rather clear notion of vacuity, sTinyatii, nirviina; it is, in short, full and conscious negation of any cogitable characteristic, material (rupin) or spiritual (ariipinah skaudhiih). Rut, without even mentioning the wild speculations that havo the word 'vajra' ('thunderbolt' or 'diamond') for origin and support, no Buddhist would admit that ' void' or ' nirviina' could be the same in the case of an ordinary saint (Arhat) and of a Buddha. Is it reasonable to compare the small part of void ether in a pore-hole and the limitless expanse of tho sky P1 So great a being as a Buddha ought to possess perfect wisdom and highest trances; but it cannot even be surmised by a pious Mahiiyiinist that he docs not interfere amongst worldly things. No wonder that he is styled "free from'nirviina' (absolute quiescence) and from 'saihsiira' (becoming),"2 that is to say, that ho is active and self-conscious, in so far as he is free from 'nirviina,' yet undefiled by this very activity, since he is free from becoming; and Siintideva, when he quotes a SO tra to this import, seems not aware that this statement, right as it is in the case of a Bodhisattva, is rather questionable in the case of a Buddha. Conversely, the same idea, in short the idea of a living God, will be expressed by an opposite phrase. Buddha has reached ' nirviina,' but remains in the world of becoming; he is possessed of a double body: the ' Body of Law,' since he is all-wise, the ' Body of Enjoyment/ since he is compassionate3 and perfectly happy. The former, as we saw above (p. 9o7), can be styled ' Immeasurable light' and ' All-propitious *; the latter is not a mere show, but 1 See Matrceta'sVarnanarhavarnana, v. 11 (edited and translated by F.

Buddhas are at the same time Brahman and Brahma. 3. The Doctrine of Sambhogakaya as Ontology. From the orthodox point of view?we mean from the point of view that has some claims to be styled Buddhist? the Sambhogakaya, or glorious possession of Buddhahood, is but a stage leading to the effective and exclusive possession of the Dharmakiiya, or a rather active state mystically associated with the possession of quiescence (Dharmakiiya). In any case tho Enjoyment-body is to be obtained by the practice of the Bodhisattvas. Further, every Buddha is endowed with such a body. Now wc observe several transformations of the theory bearing upon very important points in it. (1) It seems that the ' Enjoyment-bodies' belonging to the host of the Buddhas unite to form one; wc mean the marvellous appearance manifested in the abode of the gods Akanisthas, which is substituted for the innumerable ' Paradises ' of old.1 (2) According to the doctrines stated above (p. 054), Tantrikas maintain that the Sambhogakaya is " an effluence or emanation (syandana)2 of the Dharmadhatu (or Dharma kiiya)," an JEon as Neo-Platonists would say, but the first iEon, 'the Womb,' 'the abode from which all things take their origin by emanation.'3 The Vijnanaviidins practically agree with the Tantrikas. Under the name of " subtle dependent origination " (siiksma pratltyasamutpada) they understand a very well delineated system: Vijnana, pure, immaculate, and quiescent, gives birth to the mind (manas), which in turn becomes defiled 1 Sriguhyondrutilaku, (jnoted (ifidbfutha, v. 42.?Journal Buddhist Text Society, i, 45, n. 3. ?Waddeil, u Lamaism." p. 85. 2 dbarmadbatnnifyanda (NamaRariiglti, ad v. 79). 3 ftarvafmttvanam utpattisthanatvan ni nbasukhak arasnrii bhoga kayo yonib (Amrtuknnikfi ad Namasariigiti, v. 60), prak)'tisyaiidana samartha (Gu^hartbii, Nanmsaihgiti, v. 41).</page><page sequence="26">968 THE THIIEK BODIES OF A BUDDHA. (klistamanas) and originates the whole complcxus of thought which constitutes this very world.1 Traces (vasanas) made on Tijuana by the thought cause uninterrupted continuance of the circle. Enjoyment-body corresponds to the undefiled mind. We scarcely need to observe that this system, very like the Brahmanic ones, well harmonizes with the process of purification and defilement taught in the oldest books of the Yijnanavadins. (See above, p. 952 and below, p. 975.) III. KIRMANAKAYA. There can be but little doubt of tho etymological meaning of this word, 'created or transformed body.' The Tibetan translation, S^'B^VS, conveys the idea of a magical, fictitious, or metamorphic phantom; just as wc see that the Buddha creates magical beings (nirmita, nairmdnikas) of different kinds, Buddhas, bhiksus, etc., to promote the conversion of men.3 Tho Chinese &lt;ffc &amp; or RK fy&gt; 'body of transformation' or ' of suitable transformation,' illustrates another feature of the theory.3 1 " World as representing tbe mind." * Not only Buddhas, but magicians also, can create such phantoms. In tbe Divyavadana, Mara creates un image of Buddha; elsewhere be appears under the appearance of Buddha.

" I am not a man .... Know, O Brahman, that I am a Buddha."2 That the historical or rationalistic school, of which a sub branch had its books written in Piili, did not suppress such declarations, attests indeed the antiquity of the schools which held the Buddha for a hyperphysical or supramundane being (lokottara).3 Further, if the Singhalese tradition were to be relied upon, one could lay some stress on the so-called Council of ASoka (240 n.c:.).

(A) As soon as a Bodhisattva?wo mean a future Buddha of the old human type?becomes a Buddha, he is immediately promoted to the high state of radiance above described as Beatific Body; in the same way, it happens that Arhats directly sink into nirvana, and that their mortal frame is consumed by a mystic fire. But, " out of pity for the world," the new Buddha causes his human body to survive: the men and the gods see it, hear the lessons it gives, admire the wheel it moves, become pious witnesses of its nirvana, and preserve its bones in the stiipas. One scarcely needs to remark, but texts expressly state it, that a Buddha's bones aro not bones2; that after Enlightenment nothing earthy, human, heavenly, or mundane remains in a Tathagata. Therefore, his visible appearance is but a contrived or magical body. Thus we obtain the definition, nirmanakaya = ' human Buddha,' or more explicitly ' unsubstantial body which remains of a Bodhisattva after he has reached Buddhahood.' 1 Katha vatthu, xviii, 1. 2. 2 See Suvarnaprabhasa, p. 8: aiiasthitudhirc kayo kuto dbatur bhavisyati.?Contrast the views of the Astasahasrika, pp. 91-5, on the worship of the relies.</page><page sequence="29">THB THREE BODIES OF A BUDDHA. 971 As it has been ably observed by Wassilicff, this theorem seems to be a primitivo Muhayanist interpretation of the Hinayiinist tenets on nirviiiia with residue (sopadhisesa nirviina). It very well suits what may be anticipated from the above quoted Piili documents, although, to say the truth, it rests on the sole authority of the Russian scholar.1 (B) It cannot be questioned, however, that more coherent and advanced ' hyperphysieal ' (lokottaras) theories have been framed, and, very possibly, at the very dawn of Buddhist speculation. The reader is well aware that, according to one school of the Little Vehicle, or, more exactly, according to a dogmatical and religious tendency largely spread in the whole Buddhist world, Sak)ramuni was an extraordinary being, not only after his reaching Buddhahood, but even from his last birth as a Bodhisattva. To content ourselves with the mention of a single point, it seems evident that the thirty two marks aro more than mere tokens of the future Buddha hood of a Bodhisattva; they assure to the Bodhisattva\s body founded claims to be looked upon as suprumundauc.2 The Lokottaraviidins believe that the Bodhisattvas are f superior to the world'; and it is not a mere clerical or pious mistake if the Mahavastu, one of their authoritative books, styles them ' Bhagavantas' ('Lords'). There is no precise difference between Lords Buddhas and Lords Bodhi sattvas; what is human-like in the appearance and behaviour of the latter is such by charitable contrivance (upiiya). " To comply with tho world" (this phrase is a Pali one), "out of compassion for the world," they cause to appear as made of blood and flesh a body that is ' made of mind.' People believe that Bodhisattvas have father, mother, wife, son; but it is a mere show, etc.3 1 See Wassilioff, 127 (137). The statements of Griinwedei (Mythologic, 35, 112) and others depend on Wassilioff. * Tho Bodhisattvabhumi ban elaborate theories on the graluai acquisition of the marks by the Bodhisattvas of the different stages. 3 See the Mahavastu and Barth, Journal des Savants, 1899, August.</page><page sequence="30">972 THE THREE BODIES OF A BUDDHA. Very similar is the opinion held by Vetulyakas, according to Buddhaghosa, and already disposed of by the Fathers of Asoka's Council, that the Buddha did not for a moment resign the royalty amongst the Tusita-gods, and sent a phantom to be born as Bodhisattva, to reach Bodhi, and to play the part of a Tathagata. However, this system is unknown to the redactors of the Mahiivastu. But the phrase used in Kathiivatthu's commentary, nirmitariipamdtraka, ' being only artificial body/ exactly covers the notion conveyed by tho word nirmdnakdya, and Buddhaghosa's description well agrees with the Mahayanist human (i.e. phantom-like) and celestial Buddhas. Mythological features only are modified, the Vulture peak (Saddharmapundarika), the SukhavatI or Paradise (Yyiihas and Amitayuh-sfitras), the Bhagavutiyoni or Female-Buddha's lap (Tantras) making for the Tusita heaven of old, as residences of the ' real' or beatific Buddha. From measureless iEons, nay, at the very beginning, Sakyamuni (or Amitabba, or Vajrasattva) has reached tho supreme and perfect Enlightenment, not, as people fancy, first at Gaya : he is repeatedly born in the world of tho living, i.e. he causes magical Buddhas to obtain Body, teach the Law, and be extinct.1 This Buddhology, so very like the Visnuit system of Avatars, overrules multiple mythological surmises. Ono can mention the lists of the thousand human Buddhas of the Blessed ./Eon or Glorious Age (Bhadrakalpa), where the same names occur more than once ; Vairocana e.g. appears five times. Another application of the principle, and a more celebrated one, is tho system of the Five Jinas (the so-called Dhyanibuddhas), and of the corresponding five Miinusibuddhus: tho former are real Buddhas, like the Sakyamuni of the Lotus ; the latter would be exactly termed ' nairmanikas' (' contrived'). (C) Further, the question can bo raised whether a Buddha has many contemporaneous ' magical bodies,' and whether 1 See Saddharmapumlarika, 8.B. of the East, xxi, Introduction, p. xxv, and pp. 295 (xiv), 307 (xv, 1).</page><page sequence="31">THE TlIitKfi BODIES OF A BUDDHA. 973 they always appear in a Buddha-shape? The old legends (Divyavadana, etc.) show us that Sakyamuni created such ' phantoms' (nirmitakas) that were required, and, accordingly, the principle seems to be that tho magical forms will be adapted to every particular case. The ' nirmanakiTya' of a Buddha is multiform,1 or, in other words, Buddha transforms himself according to the dispositions of the creatures to be saved. Therefore ' iiirmauakiiya' is rightly translated ' transformation body.' Tho Buddha-liko appearances aro the best of the 'trans formations ' ; rather, they ought to be called ' reflexes' (pralibimba),2 as they bear the excellent marks which characterize ' real' Buddhas in their Enjoyment - body. But tho Buddhas are sometimes transformed as glowing bolids, as Mahesvara, as an ape, etc. There is not a place where they do not manifest themselves ; and therefore 'nirmaiuikiiyu' is styled ' omnipresent' (sarvatraga), and rightly defined 'collection of forms* (ruparasi).3 One could be of opinion that, according to the 'better orthodoxy,' transformations arc more suitable in the case of the Bodhisattvas than iu the case of the Buddhas, except as far as Buddha-like appearances are meant. A Buddha's nirmanakayas are rather Avatar - like, human Buddhas; a Bodhisattva's transformations are more like the 'rfipas* or forms of some Hindu deities. Bo that as it may, Avalokita in par excellence the polyiuorphical being. Tho 'Fa-t'ien's stanza' well illustrates the Nirmanaknya, and can be quoted as a summary of what precedes : ? " Homage to tho greatly beneficent Magical [or Trans formation] Body of the Munis, which, in order to promote 1 nanaiTipa, Nftmusariiglti's Commentary ad v. 79. Cf.

There arc two classes of ' contrived Buddhas': some of them arc immediate creations of the Buddha and produce new * contrived Buddhas'; these last are wanting in this generative power (de Oroot, Code du Mahayana, p. 16). 3 Seo above, p. 954, n. 3. j.u.a.s. 190C. 63</page><page sequence="32">974 THE T11UEE BODIES OF A BUDDHA. the ripening of beings, sometimes blazes and glows like fire; sometimes, on the contrary, at the Illumination or in moving the Wheel of the Law, appears in full appeasement; which evolves under numerous aspects, gives security to the triple world by its various contrivances, and visits the ten regions." * 3. Doctrine of Nmmanakaya as a Paht of tiik Ontology. We have seen how the doctrine of 'magical projections' completes the orthodox or semi-orthodox Buddhology, peoples the heavens, and, in the case of Lamaism, furnishes the Church with worthies. This doctrine has yet another claim to our attention. Owing to the vicinity of some philosophical views, both Buddhist and Hindoo, met above (pp. 954, 067), it has been curiously modified. In a great number of late documents (Tantras), and according to the tenets of the Yijfianavadins, which are pretty old, one has to under stand as Buddha's nirmdnakdya not only the Buddha-like appearances contrived by sonic Buddha for special aims, tho complete or partial Buddha's Avatars, as many mythological entities can be, but, rather, the universality of worldly things. These are but ' untrue' transformations of the cosmic ether-like substance known as ' Body of Law' or ' Yijliana' (Intellect). Ninnanakaya is multiple or manifold, as it is caused by the disintegration of the Body of Law, by the particularization of the Intellect, or more accurately as it is the particularized Intellect itself. Nevertheless, granted that its matrix (garbha), or 'spring source' (syandana samartha) is unique and ' really' remains undivided, tho world as a whole can be styled Buddha's ninnanakaya. 1 sattvanfuh pakahctoh kvacid anala ivahhati yo dTpyanianah | saihbndhau dharmacakre kvacid api ca punar drsyuto yah prasantah | naikfikarapravrttam tribhavnbhayuliaraih vhSvaiTipnir upayair | vande nirmanakayaih dasadiganugataih taiii mahartluuii muninam ||</page><page sequence="33">THE THREE BODIES OF A BUDDHA. 975 Hero, again, we havo to do with speculations which are very like the Sihhkhya or Vediintist cosmologies. Dharma kiiya = prudlulna = brahman; nirmanakaya = prakrti or pradhanupurinania = brahmavivarta, etc. It is of interest to observe that, compared with ' parinuma' of the Silmkhyas, ' nirmslna' has tho advantage of illustrating the irreality of the evolved or transformed things, and well suits a philosophy which is pervaded by Vacuity (siinyatil). Nor is the character of the doctrine under examination to be mis understood. ASvughosa, its earliest known promoter, was not, we can assume, a Vediintist sans le saroir. His " Awakening of Faith in the Great Vehicle," one of the best Buddhist treatises that have been written, furnishes us with a very strongly organized synthesis of the theological and ontological notions connected with the three bodies.1 Void (sTinya) and radiant (prabhasvara) Intellect is the Dharmakiiya or Buddhahood. When agitated by all-good influences its limpidity is lost to some extent, and it originates or transforms itself into ' karmavijnana,' actual or active Intellect, out of which are projected, i.e. by which arc thought, the beatific conceptions known as Bliss- or Enjo3rment-bodics. Further, primordial Intellect, owing to previous traces (vilsanas), is brought down to the state of ' Intellect who distinguishes particulars' (vastuprativikalpa vij nana) : this is the creator (nirmsitar) of the so-called material world and world of concupiscence (rupaloka, kama loka). Common people, sriivakas and Pratyekas beget, i.e. see, numberless and various transformation bodies. People who believe that there is a self, that there are pleasant and unpleasant things, create such ' bodies' as human body, enjoyable things, Isvara, Mahildcvu ; at the best they keep a very wrong idea of a Buddha, as they have not yet removed the notion of existence and non-existence : they believe in a human Buddha to be extinct in nirvana, and themselves long for nirviina; they behold a Buddha in ' niriniinakaya,' and themselves appear as ' nirmanakayas' 1 See Suzuki's able translation, p. 100.</page><page sequence="34">976 THE THREE BODIES OF A BUDDHA. of definite order. Not so as concerns tho Bodhisattvas: such beings have got the notion of tho ' Body of Law/ as they know that thero is neither existence nor non-existence ; they aro en communion with the Dharmakaya (dharmakaya prabhiivita),1 as they theoretically know their substantial non-diifercntiatiou therefrom; but they have not yet realized (siiksiltkar) it, sinco they are conscious of their identity with it. Although undefiled by the world, owing to their knowlcdgo (jnanasainbhara), they practise the career of merit (punyasambhara), and enjoy an illusory but purifying activity : they will obtain or havo alroady obtained beatific bodies; they behold celestial Tathagatas, endowed with marvellous qualifications, ripe for, if not already arrived at, everlasting quiescence in Dharmakaya. I shall not endeavour to unravel the many problems and sub-problems that tho preceding exposi will no doubt suggest to the reader. Some of them need long and wearisome discussion. The most interesting, viz., the statement of the historical and speculative affinities of tho Buddhist theologies and metaphysics with the Brahmanical ones, is hardly ripo for inquiry, and iu any case requires wider knowledge of tho Brahmanism and Hinduism than I can profess to have.2 On the other hand, I have avoided any too technical reference to Tantrisiu, although Tantrisni lays much stress on the Bodies, and that for some obvious reasons. Tantrio books profess to bo mysterious, and such they really are. Again, whereas Madhyamika and Vijnanavadin scholars aro as intelligible as the common deficiencies of Hindoo mind and the general rules of dialectic disquisition bearing on mixed niythological-ontological postulata allow them to be, it is an unquestionable yet painful fact that the Tantrio 1 See Siksasarauccaya, 159, 7; Suzuki, 64, 94. * Jaina theories are also of interest; see, for instance, Upamita* bhavaprapanca Katha, pp. 677 foil., on the Sadgiri, the Jaiuasatpura, which bear strong analogies with the Sukhavatis of the Buddhists.</page><page sequence="35">THE THUEE BODIES OF A BUDDHA. 977 authors, Vujracaryas and Siddhas of every rank, are the more obscure and abstruse the more vulgar or obscene are the facts that they have made the starting-point of their insane or frantic lucubrations. Without mentioning the five 'vital-airs' and the Tantras of 'common yoga/ which chiefly deal with thera, a commentary tells us in so many words that the five Bodies identified with the five Jinas?the so-called Dhyanibuddhas, with the five Knowledges, with the five 'Vital-airs/ with the five Joys (ananda)?are nothing else than five carnal pleasures, to be better explained in a Kama&amp;lstra than in a Bauddha tract. Nevertheless, the Tantras contain much that is old, philosophical views, nomenclature, mythology. In their worst exegesis they pretend to be truly Buddhistic, namely, when they identify with the ' fifth joy' this Law- or Thunderbolt - body (vajrakaya), "which is present in everyone like a precious gem, and is to be known by personal experience.''l They afford strange and interesting instances of the plasticity of the Buddhism ; but their speculations are to some degree coherent und organic, and therefore are not beyond the reach of European analysis. Professor Griinwedel and M. A. Foucher have done much to elucidate their hagio graphy in every respect; such publications as BcndalPs edition of Subhiisi tasam graha afford good materials for their dogmatic. But I cannot as yet deal seriously with the Fivo Bodies. 1 Tho Siddhas aim at obtaining a hypercosmic (lokottaraj body, on the pattern of tho Bodhisattva-body.</page></plain_text>
