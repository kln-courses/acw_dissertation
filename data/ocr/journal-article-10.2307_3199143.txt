<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Four Phases of the Creation: Milton's Use of Accommodation in Paradise Lost VII CHARLES G. SHIRLEY, JR. HE NATURE AND SUCCESS of Milton's attempts to portray Heaven is a familiar problem. For action among supernatural entities, a consistent translation into human terms serves well. The apparent materialism of the war in Heaven-swords and cannon-might dismay some readers, but the war is fought on a single plane, between spiritual beings who are described in material terms for better understanding and better poetry. Michael Murrin has demonstrated that this very consistency of portrayal can pose difficulties for the reader, since Milton's similes do not definitively relate heavenly and earthly realities. To describe Heaven, Milton employs a "sealed discourse" which refers to all heavenly artifacts as being gold or diamond but which avoids revealing what the substance of diamond or gold could mean outside the heavenly context. Yet the case Murrin considers is simpler than the case of portraying the episode of the Creation. When the Son leaves Heaven to make a world, Milton must pass from "sealed discourse" to a kind of language that relates visible to invisible, spiritual to physical. The action of Creation is not entirely on a spiritual level, for spirit influences matter directly, nor is it as readily conceivable as the interaction of spiritual and physical that occurs when an angel talks to a man, because the Creation is not a display put on for man nor a work executed by processes comprehensible to men. The Creation is conceptually different from the completely heavenly, the completely infernal, or the completely terrestrial parts of Milton's epic. Perhaps more than any other part of the poem, it tests the poet's ability to portray inconceivable events in ways men can understand. As students of Milton have frequently noted, the lofty subject of Paradise Lost might well have led the poet to use the familiar doctrine of accommoda- tion.2 Most specifically, "accommodation" means God's condescension, when he reveals himself, to allow for the infirmities of human perception and understanding. A simple example is scriptural reference to God's "arm" or "hand" as a physical attribute. Or God's "wrath" might be referred to as if he experienced the same emotions as his creatures. Such a portrayal of spiritual matters holds obvious possibilities for a poet writing about divine action. This method of description may be applied not only to God himself, but also to</page><page sequence="2">52 Charles G. Shirley, Jr. invisible parts of the divine creation, listed by Milton in his Christian Doctrine as including "the highest heaven, the throne and dwelling place of God, and the heavenly beings or angels."3 Despite what some scholars have implied,4 however, the principle of accommodation is broader than mere portrayal of spiritual reality by physical image. Some question whether Milton would use accommodation at all; William G. Madsen doubts that Milton would "arro- gate to himself a mode of understanding and expression that he denies to the human authors of the Bible and reserves to God alone."' Yet one need not think that Milton is writing doctrine or that he believes he alone knows the truth about Heaven and must accommodate his knowledge to ordinary mortals. In creating his poem, Milton is aware of the need to provide pictures for the imaginations of himself and his audience and, as well, to provide ways for conceiving of heavenly modes of thought and communication. Paradise Lost, particularly the section that narrates the Creation, may thus be examined as a poem whose author, aware of the difficulty of presenting spiritual ideas, attempts in various ways to solve this problem. Accommoda- tion may appear in the way a part of the narrative is related, as when the reader overhears Raphael recounting divine history for Adam, as well as in the choice of furnishings for heavenly scenes and shapes for heavenly actors. Milton does not stand as God delivering truth. He is a poet making a theological poem about a subject whose portrayal causes certain problems. One solution is by accommodation, but it is accommodation employed poetically rather than theologically. The method and form of Paradise Lost, calling for the action of Book VII to be reported in conversation rather than to be described directly to the audience, shows this poetic accommodation being acted out. Raphael comes as an intermediary between God and Adam, delivering to Adam a narrative that allows adjustment of portrayal to suit the limitations of the audience. The angel explicitly warns the newly created man that he must use "process of speech" so that "earthly notion" can accept the account of Creation (VII. 178-79).6 The angel had emphasized the similarity of Heaven to Earth when he related the celestial war-"though what if Earth / Be but the shadow of Heav'n" (V. 574-75)-but emphasizes the differences as he begins the story of Creation. In the Creation, there is danger of the mind's confounding substance and shadow. Raphael may be relied upon to let Adam (and at the same time the reader) know in a way he can understand just what he needs to know. Further, Raphael can explicitly condescend to Adam's mode of perception without the questions of propriety which might offend the reader if a human narrator, even a poetically inspired one, announced his intention to make his account suitable for the inferior perceptions of his audience. In short, the conversation between Raphael and Adam is a little drama of accommodation.</page><page sequence="3">SAB 53 Milton's remarks on accommodation in the Christian Doctrine can assist the study of some parts of Paradise Lost, especially those parts describing matters beyond man's comprehension because of their lofty spiritual quality. Milton says about God that the proper course for man is to accept God's description of himself in the Bible, for his nature is there presented just as he intended for man to know it. Going beyond scriptural revelation results in "vague subtleties of speculation" (CD, p. 134; I,ii). This position is not literalistic, however, for Milton warns that when the Bible speaks of God's repentance, it does not mean the human repentance that results from failure to foresee the future. Rather, the mind of God may be imagined as like man's, with the difference that any weakness or deficiency in man is a strength or perfection in God. What God has revealed of himself is accommodated to man's capacity, but man should not respond to this revelation by audaciously trying to discover what God is like in his true person: "In short, God either is or is not really like he says he is. If he really is like this, why should we think otherwise? If he is not really like this, on what authority do we contradict God? . . . We do not imply by this argument that God, in all his parts and members, is of human form, but that so far as it concerns us to know, he has that form which he attributes to himself in Holy Writ" (CD, p. 136; I,ii). Milton has been said to have a distrust of metaphor, visible in the Christian Doctrine as a desire to substitute literal conceptions for metaphorical state- ments made in the Bible.' For Milton, the boundary between accepting a metaphorical statement and trying to see beyond the metaphor to reality corresponds to the boundary between the nature of God and the nature of lower things.8 For God himself, perhaps only for the Father, it is necessary to trust a metaphor such as "hand" or "repentance" even while realizing that the metaphor expresses what God wants us to know about himself but not what he actually is. Milton's willingness to penetrate the figure in most subjects-as long as they are lower than God-appears to be a "distrust" of metaphor only when compared with the "trust" he puts in the letter of descriptions of God. The mode of expression depends on the subject and the circumstances. In a given situation literal truth may or may not be Milton's object, whether he is reading or writing. A number of passages in Paradise Lost support the view that Milton employs accommodation and clarify his use of it. In the Creation section alone, there are passages such as Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift Than time or motion, but to human ears Cannot without process of speech be told, So told as earthly notion can receive. (VII. 176-79)</page><page sequence="4">54 Charles G. Shirley, Jr. The convention of indescribability appears in a new light, as not only human speech but even an angel's is powerless to tell what God can do: . . to recount Almighty works What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice, Or heart of man suffice to comprehend? (VII. 112-14) A little later Raphael emphasizes that what is known to human beings should be limited to that which glorifies God and benefits man. But certainly it is beneficial for knowledge to be put into lively terms. The reader can thus expect a somewhat earthly version of heavenly events, not consistently materialized or naively anthropomorphic, but carefully and deliberately manipulated toward particular effects. Insofar as Milton applies his doctrine about interpretation of scriptural versions of God to his own portrayal of spiritual or celestial events, the physical metaphor or image is valuable for its own sake, even though it is only an image of a higher, inconceivable truth. But use of the physical is only a part of Milton's technique. A careful reading of the Creation section shows that physical details of spiritual realities are suppressed when the spiritual meets the physical. Milton's remarks on imagining God, it may be remembered, warn against confusion of his attributes with similar earthly qualities. By suppressing physical detail in parts of Book VII, Milton makes heavenly realities as vivid as possible without producing any confusing muddles about what is literal and what is figurative in the account of Creation. Another way Milton controls the Creation narrative is by removing it several stages from a direct report of divine action. On the level of events in the poem, this narrative does not differ from that of the previous book. Raphael continues as before, telling Adam things which Adam does not know. The invocation of Book VII is interposed, however, giving thanks for the safe return of the narrator to earth and marking an unmistakable change of focus at the arithmetical center of the poem.9 By reminding the reader of the poet-narrator who is recording Raphael's words, the invocation also helps increase the consciousness of distance from a direct portrayal of the Creation. Raphael himself soon strengthens this feeling of distance. He notes the discrepancy between actual events and the power of speech to convey them, making periodic references to events in Adam's limited experience (for instance, at VII. 296, 493, 536-37). These remarks bring the reader's attention back to the fact that not he but unfallen Adam is the primary hearer. The result is a sense, never lost for long if at all, of the adjustments being made from the original, unimaginable action. The outward circumstances of this narrative do not change from those of Book VI, but the motivation does. Books V and VI provide Adam with a needed warning. According to God's</page><page sequence="5">SAB 55 commission, Raphael should "such discourse bring on,/ As may advise him of his happy state. .. " (V. 233-34) and "tell him withal / His danger .. . " (V. 238-39). In the beginning of Book VII, Adam takes the initiative and asks for the history of the Creation. His wholesome thirst for knowledge makes him want to know what he (echoing the invocation) considers "lower" things (VII. 84). What he receives in answer is a poetically accommodated narrative. The episode of Creation, as related by Raphael, is divided into four main phases of action, each using a carefully distinguished level of accommodation. The first takes place entirely within Heaven, beginning with the return of the Son and the angels from expelling Satan and his crew, and ending with the Son's entering Chaos. The second is the action in Chaos. In this phase, spiritual meets physical directly, a potentially confusing situation which Milton clarifies by suppressing the physical details he had earlier used to describe spiritual beings. The third phase is the forming and filling of the earth, this being the only section with direct scriptural authority throughout. Last is the return of the Son to take his place on the Throne of God. As the first phase begins, the Father receives his victorious army much as a monarch on the stage, if not in real life, might receive an earthly army. He discusses the mistakes of the enemy, the effects of his own losses, and his plans for making up the deficiency. In this speech a logical reason for creation is given-replacing the depleted numbers of Heaven. If taken alone, the logic would indicate an action in response to Satan rather than an action out of God's freedom and foreknowledge, attributes which Milton upholds at length in the Christian Doctrine chapter on divine decree (I,iii). A little later, however, the Father hints at a concurrent explanation, the doctrine that in creation he freely wills to put forth his goodness (VII. 171), a theme touched on again when the angels sing that God will "diffuse / His good to Worlds and Ages infinite" (VII. 190-91). This statement, it might be noted, corresponds to the definition of creation in the Christian Doctrine, which says God brought about the Creation "in order to show the glory of his power and goodness" (CD, p. 300; I,vii). The first phase of the Creation narrative thus describes a process of divine reasoning. Though accommodation sometimes consists of portrayal of spiritual reality through physical images, God the Father is never presented in that way. The rest of Heaven is corporeal, but in the first stages of the Creation account, emphasis is on approximately human reasoning, not approximately human form. Explaining supernatural events by reasons that men can compre- hend leads to apparent contradiction, that God creates a world in his absolute</page><page sequence="6">56 Charles G. Shirley, Jr. freedom but also in response to the apostasy of Lucifer. Just as Milton warns that repentance in God must be shorn of some human associations (CD, p. 6; I,ii), he would warn that divine reasoning must be looked at differently from human reasoning. Certainly he intends the angels' mode of thought to differ from man's, for Raphael says to Adam that there are two types of reason, Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours, Differing but in degree, of kind the same. (V. 488-90) If angels' thought is of higher degree than man's, God's must be even more so. Giving a humanly plausible reason for creation is clearly an accommodation to man; Adam had requested some fifty lines earlier to know . . . what cause Mov'd the Creator in his holy Rest Through all Eternity so late to build .... (VII. 90-92) The speech of God is a direct reply. Besides articulating the process of God's reasoning, Milton provides great detail in the relationship of the persons of the Godhead. The Father and the Son are distinctly separate in Heaven. The Father speaks and the Son obeys; the Son speaks and Chaos obeys. The Son is clearly the instrument of the Father. The phrase "by thee / This I perform" (VII. 163-64) echoes Milton's emphasis in the Christian Doctrine, in the chapters on the Son and on the Creation (I,v and I,vii), that God works through the Son, rather than with him, to create the world. The Son disappears and then reappears, newly equipped with divine attributes needed for creation (VII. 192-96). The words "girt" and "crown'd" (VII. 194) to describe the Son's assumption of omnipo- tence and radiance seem to be part of the general scheme of accommodation, making the action seem physical and the Son human in form. During this account of the Son's preparation for his task, however, Raphael cautions Adam that God's action and man's perception do not coincide. The implied process of disappearance and preparation by the Son, with his explicit reappearance, is complicated by the interposed "Immediate are the acts of God" passage. Yet neither Raphael nor the poet intends to devalue the narrative in progress. If anything, this passage implies that no matter how marvelous an account of God's power may be, the portion which human beings can comprehend is not commensurate with the whole. The image of fantastic events is not an exaggeration but an understatement. Just as God contains a material principle and more (CD, p. 309; I,vii), spiritual reality encompasses the accommodated account and more.</page><page sequence="7">SAB 57 Compared with the use of reasoning processes in the first part of Creation, the description of Heaven's physical features is unremarkable. Chariots, mountains, and gates have appeared before in the poem and here contribute to the effect of rationalization and logical consistency in Heaven. One can maintain a balance between reading these objects as representative of some higher spiritual reality and taking them for reality in themselves. As with Milton's noncommital remarks on whether God is or is not as the Bible represents him, it seems to be a matter for the reader's responsible choice. The physical features as well as the process of divine logic, like God's physical attributes described in Scripture, are the best way to imagine the truth. The heart of Milton's accommodation theory, both theological and poetic, is to accept authorized representations but never to lapse into complete forgetful- ness about their uncertain relationship to reality. When Chaos appears and with it the kingdom of matter, beginning the second phase of Creation, the relationship of spirit to the material world requires cautious handling by the poet. The view of Chaos in Book VII points, of course, to earlier parts of the poem. Chaos has already been seen as a place of incredible disorder, maybe even actively evil, and has been viewed over Satan's shoulders at Hell Gate as it is now viewed over the Son's at Heaven Gate. In this part of the poem, the exact properties of Chaos are not an issue; the focus is still on the spiritual plane, and Chaos appears simply as a turbulent sea. Earlier, when Satan journeyed through it, Chaos appeared in its full nature. Now as a raging ocean, which can easily be imagined by the reader, it gives opportunity for the Omnific Word to speak as he will someday speak incarnate to the Sea of Galilee. This confrontation with Chaos ends the heavenly phase and begins what might be called the cosmic action. Leaving Heaven, the Son and his train of angels also leave the level of consistent and logical portrayal. Up to this point, the Son could be imagined as an anthropomorphic figure, but when he picks up "the golden Compasses, prepar'd / In God's Eternal store" (VII. 225-26), a problem becomes apparent. The reader can either imagine the Son as a grotesquely huge man-shape marking out the boundaries of the World, or he can imagine something like a painting or woodcut, with a tiny World set in a background of murky Chaos and perhaps only the hand of the Son visible, as in a well-known printer's device. 1 Lacking a definite scale of magnitude, the reader is made uneasy by the shifting perspective and lack of certainty about relative sizes. The description of Heaven caused no uncertainty and required no shifting of scale, huge actors being set against a correspond- ingly immense background. The compasses in Chaos insistently point to some other kind of reality. Milton fits a familiar image into his work to serve a definite function as transition between the fully coherent, accommodated view</page><page sequence="8">58 Charles G. Shirley, Jr. of Heaven and the fully coherent, literal view of earth. The image of the Spirit with "His brooding wings . . . outspread" (VII. 235) has the same function and recalls the invocation of Book I, where the "dovelike" Spirit can inspire poetry as well as incubate a world. This image reappears appropriately in Book VII when the relation of spirit and matter in the poem is in a transitional, potentially chaotic state, in need of similar brooding. The brooding of the Spirit passes naturally into the activity of the first two days of the Creation. By this time the transition is over and the logically awkward direct action of spirit upon matter is no longer necessary. Angels, not having to affect the physical world directly, can appear anthropomorphi- cally in this scene, playing their golden harps and singing hymns to God (VII. 256-59). Except for the angels, the first two days' description sounds almost scientific, as if it were being written as literally and unambiguously as possible. The Son and the angels are not nearly so conspicuous as at the beginning of the account. Their near-disappearance prevents the awkwardness of displaying spiritual and physical action together. With the temporary disappearance of the Son and his train, the use of figures of speech changes. The golden compasses and the wings of the brooding Spirit represent something impossible to convey literally. During the events of the six days, however, especially from the third day onward, metaphor becomes a way to describe literal actions that the reader or Adam could have perceived had he been present. Part of the change in treatment is of course in deference to the Genesis account, which Milton follows closely and which has no chariots or compasses. Yet even in following it he has to adapt it to poetic use. The events on earth from the third day through the sixth day use something besides the Genesis account and the hexameral tradition which grew from it. J. B. Broadbent calls it "delineat[ion of) nature simply as it is, with that fine edge of definition which Milton's eighteenth-century followers practised so well . . . " The weight of detail has been transferred fully from spiritual realities to material ones. The physical-seeming presence of the Son as a creative force is replaced by phrases such as "said God" and "God saw." Attention is almost completely shifted from the acting force of creation to the results, and Milton makes no attempt to explain how spiritual power is converted into physical. God simply speaks, makes, and sees-verbs abstract enough to ignore the question of mechanism and to avoid any decisive impression of physicality or likeness to man. One might question whether this part of the story is being told by means of accommodation-that is, by changing inconceivable matters into something men can understand--or whether Raphael is simply arranging materials as a human reporter would. In the background is the Father's comment that he will create a world "in a moment" (VII. 154). From Raphael's explanation of</page><page sequence="9">SAB 59 how the battle in Heaven comes to be three days long, one might suspect that God similarly arranges a six-day Creation for the angels' benefit. Yet Raphael does not seem to change the action from one plane of reality to another as he does when describing events of Heaven. The narration adheres without disclaimer to the six-day scheme, with the angels singing praise at the end of certain days. An observer who in the vicinity of Heaven would see either nothing or an intolerable glare would on earth probably have seen the passage of six normal days during the Creation. This impression is encouraged by the abundance of descriptive detail and by the lack of reminders about the indirectness of the narrative. The reader may not have forgotten that he is listening to a reported narrative, but the fact is for a time pushed to the back of his mind. He sees results, not causes. The sixth day ending and the Creation almost complete, another shift in focus occurs. A transitional passage lists the qualities needed in man, the final creature. Suddenly the Father speaks "audibly" to the Son (VII. 518)-the modifier makes this speech different-and the reader hears once again the kind of narrative he heard in Heaven. Raphael's account of the Creation returns to conversation, for the angel here reverts to a second-person address. These changes separate man from the rest of the universe by making a break in the narrative to emphasize man's spiritual nature. The rest of Creation is asso- ciated with a vague God; man, though he cannot understand more than the smallest part of heavenly reality, is nevertheless close enough to God so that some detail appears in the relationships of the persons of the Godhead. Presumably this is one of the results of man's being created in the image of God. This meeting of spiritual and physical, unlike the preliminary actions in Chaos, has no air of awkwardness or of purely emblematic significance. One reason is Milton's quick return to the concise biblical version to describe the creation of man. But the clearly differentiated planes of existence in the previous part of Book VII almost meet here, though the meeting is not emphasized and is soon to be broken by man's disobedience. After the creation of man comes the fourth phase, the return to Heaven. Mixing of divine force and physical response ceases, so there can be a return to the detailed, poetically accommodated version of spiritual reality. The Creator wishes to step back from his work like a painter from his canvas and see whether the result corresponds to his intentions (VII. 551-57)-a portrayal of God which might do as much as Platonism to explain the "great Idea" of line 557. Details of throne, gates, and so forth reappear. Like the account of the six days, these furnishings of Heaven are taken from Scripture, but their use is different from that of details of the six days. Though sufficient for the imagination, they represent something beyond the literal statement, in Milton's method of accommodation. The transition to Heaven includes a</page><page sequence="10">60 Charles G. Shirley, Jr. moment of what would be awkwardness if taken literally: the planets, says Raphael, stand still (VII. 563). Is this statement hyperbole? Or, like the golden compasses, do halted planets merely point to the inadequacy of the physical world to represent heavenly glory? The answer is not so clear-cut as with the compasses, but the effect of shifting levels of discourse is much the same. In Heaven, God and the angels resume their pre-creation character. The again anthropomorphic Son sits on a solid throne (VII. 586). The angels begin an elaborate worship, with musical instruments and incense. This last section replaces the initial emphasis of Book VII on divine reasoning with descriptions of heavenly furnishings. The Creation is over, and there is no occasion for God to speak and display his thoughts and plans. Until the end of the book, Milton keeps his account in the simplest mode of accommodation: a self-consistent translation of spiritual into physical terms. The reader has only the gentlest reminder that though it is a trustworthy representation, this is not a literal one. The Father paradoxically returns with his Son, though he has never left (VII. 588-89). When Raphael finally invites Adam to ask anything else "not surpassing human measure" (VII. 640), the reader may now detect something more than a warning against too great a curiosity. The use of four distinct types of accommodation in the four phases of the Creation has given "human measure" an epistemological significance. A human being cannot perceive spiritual truth directly. It must be presented to him in familiar terms. Within the poem, Raphael does this for Adam; outside, Milton for the reader. The shifting focus of portrayal in the account of Creation helps confirm and clarify Milton's poetic use of accommodation. He does not merely portray the spiritual by the physical, an obvious thing to do, but arranges transitions when passing from one level of detail to another. Despite the stock properties of harps and gates, the care taken to point out the true status of his lively images shows that for Milton accommodation is by no means a simplistic or naive technique. He uses a fully developed material version of Heaven when it suits his purpose, but he never confounds the spiritual and the physical. Accommodation can relate spirit and matter in more than their theological and philosophical significance. Milton achieves complex poetic effects by varying the technique. Accommodation can present a heavenly landscape or divine reasoning, or it can juxtapose physical and spiritual meanings. The Godhead can be separated in Heaven, merged outside, then separated again and given an audible voice. In using accommodation, Milton, like God, acts as creator-forming "speaking pictures" from the sometimes chaotic ideas of theology. The effect is more artistic than theological. Nothing in the poem corresponds exactly to God's use of accommodation as it is analyzed in the</page><page sequence="11">SAB 61 Christian Doctrine, a work telling how to interpret Scripture, not how to interpret poetry. What Milton says in the Christian Doctrine and what he does in Paradise Lost show that in writing theological poetry, he never forgot that "poetry" was the noun and "theological" only an adjective.
