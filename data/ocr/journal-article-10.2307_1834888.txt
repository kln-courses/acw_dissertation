By WILLIAM GRAHAM SUMNER, Professor of Political and Social Science in Yale Uni- versity. (Boston: Ginn and Company. 1907. Pp. v, 692.) PROFESSOR SUMNER has written a very valuable and timely book, and one involving years of patient research, as well as the possession of a ripe and fearless mind. By " folkways" he means " the ways of satis- fying needs which become habitual and customary by the uncoordinated cooperation of individuals, each trying to satisfy needs as well as he can. When these uncoordinated individual acts become habits of the individual and, after some generations, traditional customs of ancestors, they are recognized as advantageous to social welfare. Then they get a philosophy and become rules of the life policy. Thus they get a notion of 'ought' and are sanctioned by religion and by the force of society. At this stage the folkways turn into mores. Taken together they make a social philosophy and a public morality." The timeliness of a treatise of this character, particularly when the work is carried out as Professor Sumner has done it, is that we are still so naive and anthropomorphic in our modes of thought that we are in the habit of regarding white civilization as a superior type qua white, while in fact the great bulk of our social practices-of our morals, our religion, our marriage, our manners-are almost as little rationalized as our language. They are superior from the point of view of intelligence to the reflexes of animal behavior, but are very far from representing a complete rational oversight. They are but little superior in rational content to the practices of the natural and half-cultural races, and even this slight superiority is usually only a few centuries old. Professor Sumner has developed this standpoint in a manner which is at once fascinating and convincing, and the range and aptness of the ethnological and historical data brought into play is a thing to admire. Incidentally his book is one of the strongest arguments yet presented for the essential likeness of the human mind in all times and in all peoples, and also a most suggestive Volume for those who are interested in the reform of our whole system of education. The analytical and descriptive side of the work is not surpassed, hardly equalled, in the field of social psychology, and the first chapters I regard as the clearest statement yet made on the "folk-mind ".

Aspects of social life are presented in a kaleidoscopic fashion, different sections treat of the same question (compare 479 with 48I and 484; and 625 with 640), the fine print goes over the same ground as the coarse, and the reader cannot avoid the impression that the illustrative materials are sometimes shuffled rather than logically arranged. Some points are elaborated with extreme detail and others touched on in so fragmentary a manner that it would have been better not to treat them at all. (The section on Japanese woman contains a single citation from Hearn, and Chinese woman is not alluded to at all.) Some large and important fields illustrating folkways are very inadequately handled. The treat- ment of folkways as illustrated by literature and art is conspicuously poor, sketchy, and apparently perfunctory. On the psychological side there is lack of clearly defined theory. The irrational nature of folk- ways is convincingly displayed, but we find no indication of the psy- chology of the process by which social practices are slowly rationalized. Indeed, the reviewer does not feel that Professor Sumner has made out a difference between folkways and mores, and it is certain that he frequently uses the terms indifferently (compare sections i and 40). In view of the extraordinarily wide range of authorities used, it is remarkable that Professor Sumner neither cites nor lists Steinmetz's Ethnologische Studien zur ersten Entw ekelung der Strafe, Nieboer's Slavery as an Indutstrial System, Westermarck's Origin and Develop- mnent of Moral Ideas, nor Schultze's Alterclassen und Minnerbunde- the most important books, perhaps, on certain topics to which he gives particular attention.
