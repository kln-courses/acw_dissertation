Locke is puzzling over pre cisely the question of how we come to group an assemblage That there should be more species of intelligent creatures of individuals into a larger group and what reality this group above us, than there are of sensible and material below us, is may be said to have.

But Locke's argument is important because it draws circles, or two equilateral triangles. . . . Nor indeed can we attention to the minute particularity and infinite complexity rank and sort things, and consequently (which is the end of of the physical world which the language of taxonomy, and a sorting) denominate them by their real essences, because we species concept, allows us to gloss over, know them not.

In this text, though, we see organisms may be thought of as a more Platonic version of more clearly the consequences of Coleridge's attempt to Lamarck's notion of environmentally conditioned evolution: identify the essence of nature as the essence of humanity's species "evolve" to a predetermined ideal conditioned not by apparent perfection as a species.

That the poet can speak for other non-human beings suggests his sense that his own identity, his own language, has been formed by these observations, While squinting in the hollow tree they spy these other lives. In "The Eternity of Nature," for instance, The sitting bird looks up with jetty eye Clare explains his desire to speak for birds as a way of ex plaining too the assumed absence of an audience of his own: The green woodpecker made in years remote The wrynecks curious eggs as white as snow And waves her head in terror too and fro Speckled and veined in various shades of brown And then a hissing noise assails the clown And quick with hasty terror in his breast From the trees knotty trunk he sluthers down And thinks the strange bird guards a serpents nest.

In fourteen lines we learn an astonishing number of facts about the bird: when And still find hearts to love my quiet lays (166) and where it may be seen, how its song may be recognized, where we may find its nest, what it and its eggs look like, and Like Shelley in "To a Skylark," Clare sees the bird singing for how it defends its nest. But the poem really presents a neat itself as a grand simile for his own poetic activity, but the argument against egg-snatching. The actions of the peeping birdsong is here neither triumphal nor disembodied, idler (as opposed to the patiently monitoring poet) are Although Clare is working over a Romantic cliché, what is spurred by ignorance over what he does not really see. Care- striking about the bird poems is how literally they reveal ful observation, the poem implies, is its own reward; seeing Clare adopting this strategy of singing with them. His poetry the individual animal, noting its particular place and beauty, is a repetition of the bird's song, which is also quiet in that it leads naturally to an ethic of conservation and a powerful appears to be directed at no other being in particular, and egalitarian sense of the individual animal's right to exist. that it sings of its surroundings, which is what Clare imagines, (There is none of the shock in reading Clare, as there is in for instance, about the "little Robin in the quiet glen" (166).

Endler. See also P. Kyle Stanford, John Gregg, Peter Stevens, and Frederick Ferré. Prof. Damhnait McHugh, of the Department of Organismal and Evolutionary Biology, at Harvard, read an early version of this paper and offered substantial help on the issues of speciation and systemics. 3The editors to the Shorter Works and Fragments volume of The Collected Works note Coleridge's heavy indebtedness to the German writers mentioned, as well as to Blumenbach and Kant, but argue (agreeing with Thomas McFarland) that his final goal of asserting the reality of God is different (48M). 4Though Fruman righdy draws attention to a widespread re luctance to acknowledge Coleridge's plagiarism in criticism of Theory of Life, he makes virtually no attempt to understand the text as a whole, finding it to be self-evident nonsense. Thomas Levere argues that Theory of Life is representative of the culmination of Coleridge's interest and learning in science (215-20). 5This theory does not, as Barfield and others have suggested (Barfield 55-7), anticipate Darwinian evolution. Coleridge's theory, like Lamarck's is thoroughly teleological, and thus ontogenetic. For Coleridge, Nature unfolds not through the blind operation of an al gorithmic process, but through the fulfillment of an idea that leads to a synchronic hierarchy of complexity. 6Naturalists like Linnaeus and Bonnet insisted on the striking similarity between humans and certain primates. As Lovejoy notes, Rousseau and Monboddo "took the further step of asserting that man and the higher apes . . . are of the same species" (235). Shelley used this argument as proof that humans are really vegetarian. 7In his letters to Peacock, of July 22-25, 1816 in which he dis cusses his trip to Chamounix, Shelley speaks at length about being impressed by glaciers, that their inexorable and slow movement (which seems to suggest their spreading across Europe) gives evi dence as well of the vast stretches of history. Shelley sees the glaciers as proof of a power inimical to humanity, since it not only literally threatens our existence but seems also to lead to "the degradation of the human species," since those living close to the mountain seem to him "half deformed or idiotic." The implication seems to be that an environment of such explicit chaos produces people "deprived of anything that can excite interest &amp; admiration" (Shelley 500).
