Virtual Certainty: The Hubris of Irrational Rationalism A. More or Less: Science's Scapegoating of Superstition "Technology is lust removed from nature." - White Noise, Don DeLillo British biologist Richard Dawkins recently passed through town to plug his latest book and, as the local papers reported, he used the occasion to complain again about the puzzling persistence of superstition in Western life: why in an age of astounding scientific advances did people still place their faith in the sham clairvoyance of astrology? Coming from</page><page sequence="2">96 DAVID BOSWORTH the most dogmatic of the new Darwinists, such scorn for the esoteric arts was hardly surprising. Nevertheless, it seemed a curious priority of concern for someone who also occupies an academic chair in the Public Understanding of Science. Certainly there was no shortage of intriguing alternatives. Just months before, scientists in Scotland had cloned a sheep, and Chicagoan Richard Seed - a man armed with the august credentials of a Harvard PhD and a bad-pun characternym out of a Thomas Pynchon novel - had quickly announced his intention to do the same with (to? for?) a human being. If Professor Dawkins was in worrying mood, rather than clucking over the popularity of the mystic hot-line, he might have wondered out loud about the ethical and political issues surrounding this discovery. Or discussed the social and scientific implications of the fact that Oxford now lends its classrooms to students in genetics who earn their PhD' s for work done in the labs of commercial corporations. Or eased the public's mind about the dangers associated with the artificial life movement (the attempt to create software programs that, evolving in complexity, will actually become "alive") - a movement with which Dawkins is personally allied and which, by eerie and unsettling coincidence, is centered at Los Alamos. Or, if obsessed with debunking sham predictions, he might have analyzed the claims of various leading scientists in the artificial intelli- gence field who have been predicting for more than a decade now that we will be able to convert our "selves" into software and, escaping the way of all flesh, live forever in a "postbiological world." Or, for those of us still fond of our flesh, he might have com- mented on the recent reports that Soviet scientists have genetically altered the anthrax bacterium to create apotentially devastating biological weapon. Or on the underground market for both nuclear material and nuclear scientists from the old Eastern bloc. What did it mean for the world that their "elegant" solutions, measured by the megaton and the million dead, might now be sold to the highest bidder? I don't wish to be counted among the superstitious, but that we continue to glance at our daily horoscopes, hoping to catch a fortuitous wave of astral fate and surf our way to sex, fame and fortune on the beach of the new millennium worries me a lot less than our pelimeli pursuit of</page><page sequence="3">The Science of Self -Deception 97 immortality and apocalypse on the wings of Progress, commercially driven and scientifically defined. Dawkins and I might agree that postmodern life seems a very strange mix of material progress and social devolution. The West's postwar explosion of knowledged-based wealth has been simultaneous with a surge in irrational and anti-social behaviors, including divorce, unwed pregnancy, addiction and obsession, STD's, road rage and other forms of public incivility. When addressing these social depradations in the general sense, science's spokesmen, like the late Carl Sagan, have tended to offer a single programmatic solution: more science. If only more studies could be done and our labs were better funded, if only government would simply get out of the way so that the next generation of heroic technologies might be freed from the chains of regulatory restraint, if only our kids were trained to science from the earliest age - if only, in short, more of us were more like Carl Sagan and Richard Dawkins, we might fix our mistakes and escape from the caul of superstition's fears and fantasies. Such a position, however, is not only varnished with vanity and tainted by self-interest; it also expresses obsessive presumptions about social causation which are themselves oddly archaic. For just as corporate leaders keep complaining about the "inefficiencies" of government when nearly every domain in American life (including the nuclear family) has already been privatized, science's spokesmen keep bemoaning "supersti- tion" when the historical trend has overwhelmingly been to rationalize all human endeavors. While on the sound-bite stump, they seem to forget that we aren't living in the Middle Ages. We no longer use the dunking stool, thank God, to assess guilt or innocence; we have instead a highly rational judicial system which, nevertheless, seems to be melting down under the relentless logic of its own procedures. Our political leaders don't consult goat innards to make their often daffy and occasionally dangerous deci- sions; they turn relentlessly instead to "experts in the field." These examples sketch by implication a commonsensical counter thesis to the scapegoating of superstition: if we are thinking foolishly and behaving badly, wouldn' t the causes more likely lie in the actual centers of postmodern power - namely, commerce and science - than in the outer orbits of influence where astrologers, numerologists, and "past life therapists" hold their sway?</page><page sequence="4">98 DAVID BOSWORTH To be fair (and efficient), I should sketch briefly here my own presumptions about power and influence in postmodern America, which are as follows: * that the aptest term for our society 's current ruling system is scientific capitalism; * that through its commercialization and rationalization of nearly all domains, scientific capitalism has built a new and "virtual" America, one which continues to publicize but fails to enact many of the older values we associate with American culture, especially those rooted in democratic and spiritual practices; * that the values and structures of this Virtual America have produced instead a new and very imbalanced American character, the Idiot Savant: someone who is highly trained in specialized techniques and instrumental^ effective but who is also increasingly devoid of common sense, fellow-feeling, emotional self-discipline, and moral sensibility; * that this volatile combination of technical authority and moral opacity leads to a distorted self-image of omnipotence and omniscience, a narcissistic Sovereign Self, full of fantasies of dominion and absent a sense of social obligation; * that the emergence of this character in Virtual America (the Idiot Savant who believes himself to be a Sovereign Self) is creating an estranged and unstable citizenry, one ill-equipped to meet either the specific political challenges of the day or the perennial philosophical problems of being alive. What I hope to show in the pages to come are the various ways in which the methods of science itself, when too broadly applied, lead to habits of thinking which can be highly disingenuous and self-deceiving,</page><page sequence="5">The Science of Self-Deception 99 enacting in the process some of the oldest patterns of human folly. Eventually, I plan to look at experts in the field of artificial intelligence (the latest "saving" technology), in response to whose fantastic promises we are now rapidly and, I believe, thoughtlessly transforming our schools and our homes as well as our economy. Finally, in response to the stress, loneliness, and social disorder of the day, I will try to sketch, however briefly, a recuperative way of thinking that emphasizes not "more science" but something more than science: a richer and more resonant intelligence, one which doesn't deny scientific truth so much as circumscribe and civilize it, returning it to the fold of accountable acts where hubris gives way to humility, and where common sense and fellow feeling are also part of "the facts." B. Puny Boundaries: the Reductionist Fallacy "[Descartes'] omnipotent rationality produced nothing but a blindness to Existenz and a means of concealing very different impulses and purposes beneath the cloak of absolute reason. This scientific attitude in philosophy engendered arbitrary irrationality masked as rationality." - Karl Jaspers Some pre-emptive clarifications are immediately in order. When- ever I mention these ideas in public, someone will scold me with the observation that I am mistakenly "conflating" pure science with complicit technology. Well yes, I am, but knowingly and without embarrassment, and I am doing so in part because that is exactly what scientific capitalism is now enacting all around me. What other meaning can one derive from the fact that universities have begun awarding PhD ' s to corporate employ- ees? When Leon Kass published an eloquent essay in The New Republic arguing for a complete ban on human cloning1 one realpolitik school of ethicists dismissed his thesis, however right it might have been in the ideal sense, as irrelevant. They pointed instead to the "technological impera- tive": that unlikeable - but also, I fear, undeniable - assertion that</page><page sequence="6">100 DAVID BOSWORTH whatever is discovered will be applied. In today's economy, the possible (if profitable) will necessarily become actual. What is thought will quickly be made, and what is made will inevitably, and sometimes radically, revise how we behave. Or, as my epigraph efficiently phrases it: today, and at a far more rapid rate than in 1933, science finds - } industry applies - } humanity conforms.2 It won't do, then, to pretend that science is ethically removed from the social issues of the day, especially when some of the hottest fields of study such as genetic function and neuropharmacology are directly linked to the very core of our human identity. The power to "engineer" in these fields - to clone a human being, or to adjust the moods of many thousands of schoolchildren by dosing them with ritalin each day - presents us with options that are inescapably political, ethical, and spiritual in nature. Although the acute but narrow competencies of science and commerce have only limited relevancy when addressing such questions of subjective value, we do tend, in our bewilderment, to passively conform to what their experts say. What we habitually and mistakenly "conflate" today, in other words, is technical cleverness with philosophical wisdom, a categorical error comically captured by a Seattle paper which actually tried to maintain that Bill Gates and his right-hand man were the Plato and Aristotle of our age. Contrary to the claims of Prof. Dawkins, the one superstition we now most need to fear is our own untutored faith in the moral authority of expertise. To see how and why such a superstition arises out of the very guise of reason - how, in Jaspers' words, the pursuit of "omnipotent rationality" actually engenders an "arbitrary irrationality" - we can turn to the history of behaviorist psychology in America. In the early 20th century, frustrated that the supposed faculties of higher thought did not lend themselves to the exactitude of controlled investigation as required by the mechanistic science of their day, John B. Watson and others chose to limit their studies to those phenomena that could be measured with certainty - to external behavior, rather than moods, images, mental states. Psychology, they thought, should be removed from the misty realm of introspective philosophy. Any truly scientific approach would have to begin from the bottom up: from those atoms of physical activity described by the simple pattern of stimulus - } response. Animals, mostly rats and</page><page sequence="7">The Science of Self -Deception 101 pigeons, would be placed in radically denatured environments, sterile boxes where the stimuli ("input" such as electric shocks) could be totally controlled by the scientist and where the subsequent responses ("output," simple behaviors such as beak pecking) could be precisely counted. Eventually, it was believed, scientists would "condition" ever more complex "schedules" of activity by linking these atoms into larger mol- ecules that would begin to approximate natural behavior. The goal, Watson proclaimed in the first behaviorist paper in 19 1 3, was nothing less than the prediction and control of behavior - the Cartesian dream of an omniscient and omnipotent rationality. While some followers of Watson continued to accept the reality of the mind, acknowledging simply that science did not have the tools to measure human consciousness, the so-called "radical behaviorists" denied that mind as such existed at all. Led by B. F. Skinner, these second- generation behaviorists insisted that human thought itself was but another form of conditioned behavior, a more private version of the physical reflex and so, like the reflex, entirely controlled by stimuli. The traditional categories of higher thought - our claims, say, to faith or love as human motivation - merely masked our ignorance of those conditions, however complex, that actually "caused" our thinking: a radically reductionist view of human life that was most concisely expressed in the title of Skinner's penultimate book, Beyond Freedom and Dignity. How did these psychologists know that mind did not exist? They were merely projecting, they said, from the "hard" results of their labora- tories. But trying to find freedom inside a behaviorist protocol is like trying to overhear a word of English in a meeting of French Canadian separatists, and the leap from pigeons pecking to human beings behaving is a shift in both scale and category without credible scientific justification. In fact, the laboratories of Skinner and his followers are classic examples of the methodological solipsism to which all specialized thinking is constantly susceptible. Their belief that behavior was externally con- trolled (environmental determinism) preselected methods and means of expression which could only reinforce that doctrine's world view. In the first step (separation), the mind is banished from the laboratory because it can't be measured; in the second step {extermination), the reality of the mind is denied because ... it can't be found in the laboratory. The "proof</page><page sequence="8">1 02 DAVID BOSWORTH is little more than the premise concealed beneath an armature of authori- tative terminology. Through such a procedure, science is reduced to a self- fulfilling prophecy, becoming in the words of Wordsworth, an early critic of Enlightenment science: . . . that false secondary power By which we multiply distinctions, then Deem that our puny boundaries are things That we perceive, and not that we have made.3 That Wordsworth's own work was often characterized by a parallel inability to distinguish between the things he perceived and the things that he made - between the actual creation and his poetic imagi- nation - is a highly revealing irony. For as was noted by William Hazlitt in his lecture on Wordsworth's long poem, "The Excursion," the error of self-aggrandizing specialization can afflict "the moralist, the politician, the orator, the artist, and even the poet" as well as the scientist: whenever an intense activity is given to any one faculty, it necessarily prevents the due and natural exercise of others. Hence all those professions or pursuits where the mind is exclusively occupied with the ideas of things ... and not as they are connected with practical good or evil, must check the genial expansion of the moral sentiments and social affections ... Hence the complaint of the want of natural sensibility and constitutional warmth of attachment in those persons who have been devoted to the pursuit of any art or science ... and [their] indifference to everything that does not furnish an occasion for the display of their mental superiority and the gratification of their vanity.4 Seen from this perspective, the Romantic movement seems less a true revolt against the arrogance of scientific rationality than a reactive attempt to gain the same undue prerogatives for poetry itself. Shelley's famous claims that poetry was "divine" and that poets were "the unac- knowledged legislators of the world" become recapitulations of the very error that Wordsworth lamented above. The descriptive acts of the</page><page sequence="9">The Science of Self- Deception 1 03 intellect, whether artistic portrayal or scientific measurement, are con- fused with actual genesis. Expert reason pandering to our will to vanity, we reduce reality itself to "the puny boundaries" of our mind's simula- tions, a process defined as idolatry by religion, solipsism by philosophy, and narcissism by modern psychology. C. Boxed In: the Infinite Eden of Atomism "O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a king of infinite space - were it not that I have bad dreams. " - Hamlet It is not surprising, then, that the supposedly hard science of radical behaviorism pandered to the ultimate of human vanities: the irrational belief in a manmade Eden. Skinner was an unapologetic, proselytizing Utopian whose novel Waiden Two became the blueprint for a planned community, and whose Skinner box, contrary to both maternal instinct and millennia of cultural tradition, was actually used to raise human infants. This delusionary leap from minimal facts to grand schemes has a psychological schedule all its own; it is, in fact, a predictable error. To see this we need only note how closely the Utopian motive behind the opaque space of the spartan Skinner box resembles Hamlet's desire for safe enclosure cited above. Under tremendous stress, the prince entertains and then dismisses the narcissistic fantasy that he could bind himself "in a nutshell" where he might proclaim himself the "king of infinite space." Shakespeare comprehends something here that Skinner's sci- ence has banished from the start: he admits the elaborate interplay of emotion with reason, our innate capacities for distortion and repression, all the ways in which we can revise a "stimulus" to avoid a necessary but frightening "response." He unveils how the desire to be so "bounded" actually conceals a grandiose wish to be beyond all bounds. And in the dramatist's lab, unlike the behaviorist's, the experimental subject is allowed to feel the temptation and discern its cause. By granting him self- awareness, Shakespeare provides Hamlet not only with the opportunity to</page><page sequence="10">1 04 DAVID BOS WORTH choose but with the necessity of making a choice - one freedom he cannot get "beyond." His dilemma is actually a reprise of his suicide soliloquy - to be or not to be - but now recast in ethical terms. Will he continue to exist as an active moral agent, admitting reality and redressing wrongs, or will he slay his own acute social intelligence, censoring "stimuli" to escape the obligation of an onerous response? Will he choose the fantasy of omnipotence or the jeopardy of effectiveness? The relevance of this choice to Virtual America is profound, for although the closed shell of Skinner' s Utopian box is now out of favor, its pattern of error is, as William Irwin Thompson has noted, "Hydra-headed, and no sooner have you gotten rid of Professor B.F. Skinner and his reductionist behaviorism then up pops Professor E.O. Wilson and socio- biology." 5 In our postmodern world, the Cartesian desire for absolute certainty is constantly reinventing itself to our detriment and danger. Whatever the forms it chooses to assume, its reductionist fantasy of gaining total control by eliminating both chance and subjectivity not only leaves us all the more unprepared for the unexpected (the Maginot Line mentality); it blinds us to our own dubious motives. In Jaspers' s terms, arbitrary irrationality arrives in the guise of omnipotent rationality - a process of self-mystification that I call technodupery. Today, despite the claims of Prof. Dawkins, the most effective way to borrow authority for a bogus scheme is not to brandish a witch doctor's fetish, draw a star chart, or recite the rhymes of a magic spell; rather one dons a lab coat, claims "studies have been done," and salts the air with statistical results. It may have been disconcerting that Nancy Reagan was consulting an astrologer to help time her husband's travel plans, but it was far more disturbing that the President himself was redesigning public policy according the gonzo theories of Edward Teller and Arthur Laffer. Where were the opponents of junk science when we needed them most? Supply-side economics is the arch exemplar of technodupery , the cargo cult of postindustrial politics disguised as the sober science of governmental finance. Key to selling its counterintuitive premise that cutting taxes would produce more revenue was the so-called Laffer Curve, a simple graph that had the look-feel of Cartesian elegance and certainty, as if a diamond of pure intelligence laboriously compressed from a ton of</page><page sequence="11">The Science of Self-Deception 1 05 dense data. Actually, though, the Curve was an improvised sketch, drawn up on a cocktail napkin at the suggestion of messianic supply-sider Jude Wanniski. Wanniski was then a writer for the Wall Street Journal and his allies in finance would profit enormously from the political adoption of this something-for-nothing fantasy even as, contrary to the promise of the "scientific" Curve, the federal government's debt would soar. 6 If the fantasy of the "golden goose" was reinvented through the Laffer Curve, the irrational hope of the "fountain of youth" has rearrived, rationalized, as a graph of computational intelligence in Hans Moravec' s book, Mind Children. According to this computer engineer's giddy calculations - and it is important to note that, employed by Carnegie Mellon and published by Harvard University Press, Moravec is not a fringe figure - we will eventually duplicate our selves by "downloading" our minds into computers where we will then "live" forever as pure, fleshless, ever- evolving, self-replicating computational intelligences: abstract minds in a "postbiological world." In the quote below, Moravec imagines the very moment of "genesis" when his software "mind child" thinks and therefore exists. I think, therefore I am: a simulated Descartes correctly deduces his own existence. It makes no difference just who or what is doing the simulation - the simulated world is complete in itself.7 According to his scheme, this virtual Sovereign Self - "complete in itself like Hamlet's nutshell - might even survive the death of the universe, thus being not only the "king of infinite space" but also the earl of infinite time. In the more mundane world of political and personal governance, technodupery confuses our decision-making through the misapplication of statistics, polls, computer program analyses, and narrow scientific results (the oat bran syndrome). Again and again as the principles of rational materialism are applied to the social domain, the look-feel of hard science disguises the irrational, the venal, the irrelevant, the incomplete. The pollster's strategy of narrowing responses to a few possible options, for example, merely recapitulates the methodological solipsism of the</page><page sequence="12">106 DAVID BOSWORTH radical behaviorist. Just as animal behavior is reduced to on-off regimens of bar pressing and beak pecking, public opinion on complex issues is compressed into for-or-against alternatives, the nation's political conver- sation relentlessly reduced to a rhetorical version of the Skinner box. And as any writer knows, even those supposedly rigorous results can be shaped and shifted by a slight tweaking of the question' s wording - a fudge factor all the more possible in computer analyses where the potential biases of software syntax are essentially invisible. The first Clinton administration provided a blatant illustration of just such a form of cybernetic technodupery. A computer, the supposedly unschmoozable Resumix machine, was employed by the transition team to sort the resumes of campaign supporters, selecting finalists for political appointments solely on the basis of their qualifications. In fact, the usual networking, favoritism, back stabbing, and horse trading were skewing this superficially objective "decision-making process." Whole groups of résumés were lost; applicants with powerful sponsors (Tipper Gore, The New Republic owner Martin Peretz, the American Bar Association) were coded preferentially; some transition team workers sabotaged files while falsifying their own to meet the favored profile. This preinaugurai charade of objectivity proved something of a prophecy, a window on the soul of an administration whose pristine wonkish rhetoric would cover over the usual sly and sleazy political maneuverings.8 The ultimate in high-tech hijacking, however, occurred during the election itself. When Perot wanted to return to the race after dropping out, he coyly announced that his decision would depend on the wishes of his followers which he then solicited via a telephonic plebiscite: a model of high-tech, fast-track democracy (the televisual, telephonic town meet- ing) that he proposed to use more extensively should he be elected. As it turned out, though, every call was automatically recorded as a vote for his re-entry when, in fact, some of his former supporters (who knows how many?) were furious with him and were calling to vote against a renewed candidacy. Whether these duperies result from an intentional lie or a meth- odological error does matter, of course, but answers don't always easily coalesce into neat categories of culpable guilt or innocent error. The self that deceives may also believe its own deceptions. Such a lack of self-</page><page sequence="13">The Science of Self -Deception 1 07 awareness proves to be a defining feature of all denominations of the Sovereign Self, and nothing more abets that Selfs will to self-deception than the application of science to the social realm. Abracadabra, the always crucial questions of conscience and character are made to disap- pear by our increasing reliance on objective technique. Government, like psychology before it, is relieved of the agonies and ambiguities of introspection by the supposedly incorruptible findings of expertise. Yet as the catastrophic history of the twentieth century has vividly demonstrated, the practice of politics is never more dangerous than when we presume to have made it into a science ... D. Never Say No: the Manifest Destiny of Moral Opacity Every word is a sound; every sound has a meaning; and its meaning is what it does. - Shantanand Saraswati ... Nor is the practice of science any more dangerous than when we presume it to be free of political implications. The self-excusing fantasy of purity that afflicts the post-Enlightenment practitioners of both art and science grants us license to ignore the otherwise self-evident truth that knowledge is powerful, and so necessarily imbued with ethical and political ramifications. Specialization, that powerful tactic of rational materialist method, tends to narrow not only the field of study but the mind of the student - as much as his pigeons, Skinner's own thinking was bound in a box. The key division in this now pan-cultural process of self- isolation is not just sense from sense (Hamlet's "eyes without feeling, feeling without sight"), or our emotions from our reason, or intellectual discipline from intellectual discipline (art from science, and both from religion) but also organized thought from daily action - invention from its use and abuse. We are, after all, the thinking species. Our ideas have effect; both refining and supplanting animal instinct, they not only direct our behavior, they are behavior. Even our words, as spiritual leader</page><page sequence="14">1 08 DAVID BOSWORTH Saraswati insists, do. And if, as Hazlitt notes, we are in the habit of disconnecting intellectual activity from "practical good and evil," we are not likely to do well. Indeed, under such a system of relentless partitioning, where we are in every way - socially, sexually, economically, intellectually - segmented and walled off, we lose not only the incentive but the subtle methods and sensory evidence necessary to attune the moral intelligence. Boxed in and pressed thin, our imaginations lose their richness and reach: their potential immanence. Trained by day to calculate, by night to fantasize - fashioned, that is, to either exploit or escape reality - our minds never learn the craft of intelligent compassion which can, in effect, turn the opaque into the transparent: the sy naesthetic capacity to see/hear/ feel our way through the barriers of time and space and social difference to imagine what all of our actions, including our thoughts, are doing or will do. The rational intelligence, when subdivided and specialized, rapidly increases its efficiency. Under the same system, the moral intelligence quickly atrophies. What we gain in quantity of goods and speed of transaction, we lose in the quality and richness of human interactions. So we achieve under scientific capitalism the dual and interde- pendent capacities of instrumental ingenuity and ethical opacity. Our systematic drive to apply new knowledge in pursuit of profit relies on our systematic inability/unwillingness to imagine the human consequences of such material "progress." This is the template for a Culture of Idiot Savants, a society that can invent, manufacture, and market ideas like the automobile and television without a clue as to their imminent, radical impact on community and family life; a society whose artists, scientists, and entrepreneurs can create products of increasing vulgarity, violence, or toxicity (the S &amp; M art and fashion craze, the selling of semiautomatic weapons, the promiscuous use of chemicals in agriculture) while denying their influence on the human soul and the human place: on the "mindscape" and the landscape of America. Instead, as Hazlitt noted, all attention is focused intensely on pursuing the needs of the profession itself. Because only "productivity" counts, few specialists are ever trained to just say no to the imperatives of their own enterprise: there is no such thing as too much profit for the businessman, too much invention for the scientist, too much free speech</page><page sequence="15">The Science of Self-Deception 1 09 for the artist, too much (funded) pity for the social service advocate. The ideal of the Golden Mean, with its emphasis on harmony through modera- tion, gives way to the ideal of the Golden Goose, with its relentless insistence on quantifiable progress. Self-discipline is narrowly applied to the acquisition of techniques that will achieve that grossly utilitarian goal of "laying more eggs faster" while the task of attuning the conscience is left unattended, only to be assumed by the surrounding soup of mostly commercial propaganda. Obsessed with can do at the expense of should do, we manage to acquire multiple means only to achieve the same sorry ends: produce and consume, produce and consume. I have analyzed elsewhere how such a philosophy /economy can distort the artist's performance.9 The ethical opacity of the scientist is, if anything, even more extreme, for while the very content of, say, the painter' s work must change if he or she is to commit to an extremist regime (as many willingly did to Nazism and Communism), the scientist's projects can often remain essentially unchanged. As it turns out, the inherently isolationist nature of the scientific method makes it especially susceptible to mercenary practice. Just as yesterday's rocket fuel expert could build his missiles for the Nazis or the allied democracies or the Communists, to terrorize a city or explore the moon, all alike without compromising his scientific principles, today ' s expert in most any field - law, p.r., the graphic arts - can hire himself out to anyone who can foot the bill under the righteous shield of consumerism' s Golden Rule: the customer is always right. So it is that as postmodern politics converts itself to the reductive ethos of efficient production - to the pure science of winning, indifferent to ethical or ideological cost - Werner von Braun is born again in Dick Morris, electoral guru to both Bill Clinton and Trent Lott.10 So it is, too, that physicist Steen Rasmussen can make the following baffled observation about his own participation in the artificial life project: "If you ask me really honestly, 'Steen, why are you doing this?' I can't answer you." His brilliance at his work does not extend to the realm of self-awareness. As with the introspective question of personal motive, the immanent questions of both social consequences and ultimate purpose are excluded from the lab of objective measurement. Uncon- sciously aping the shape of his work, the scientist's own life becomes a</page><page sequence="16">1 1 0 DAVID BOSWORTH kind of blind experiment in which meaning and morality aren't allowed to "skew the evidence," much less just say no to the march of progress, scientifically defined. Rasmussen is unusual in admitting that such teleological cluelessness bothers him, even acknowledging that he may be "committing a sin" through his attempt to create artificial life.11 Both Rasmussen' s comment and his locale (his is one of the "a- life" labs stationed at Los Alamos) recall the doubts of Manhattan project physicist, J. Robert Oppenheimer. Indeed, the whole problem of science' s ethical opacity might best be illuminated by that notable exception when the urgency of the War led to an especially rapid passage from theory to invention to application, dissolving the usual partitions of space, time, and speciality that allow us the illusion of moral immunity. Within but six years of its first practical conception,12 the Bomb was actually dropped on a human population, killing some hundred thousand Japanese civilians. "Pure" science's complicity in a momentous yet highly ambiguous moral decision was undeniable this time, leading Oppenheimer to his famous observation that now physics knew sin. What seems so disturbing in retrospect is both the belatedness and rarity of such an observation, how few of our best and brightest in any profession have made, or would make, such a confession. The exception here highlights the broader rule: how, under our prevailing system of thought, fewer and fewer of us are trained to feel accountable; how, cut off from Hazlitt's "genial expansion of the moral sentiments and social affections," we lose the capacity to imagine what our ideas are doing or will do. Having slowly adopted a philosophy that methodically ignores ethical and metaphysical questions, we have gradually built a society that both excludes the terms that pose those questions and devalues the complex character skills required to answer them effectively. As freedom and dignity "disappeared" from Skinner's laboratory, virtue and wisdom are disappearing from ours, our eyes without feeling, our feeling without sight for their necessary forms.</page><page sequence="17">The Science of Self-Deception 111 II. Media Lab: The Pseudodemocracy of Cybertechnology A. Inventing the Future: the Deceptions of Disinterest Some readers may be surprised by my continued emphasis on specialization. After all, the new technologies of communication (tv- fax- internet) do collapse the boundaries of space and time, and should, therefore, bring an end to the mental and social isolation inherent in the old industrial order. But as Marshall McLuhan convincingly asserted, the rhythms of organized social change are far slower than those of techno- logical invention. Our communications revolution is radically revising our experience of everyday life, yet even the architects ofthat change are often lost as to its meaning and still operate out of a set of values that their own inventions may be eviscerating. Both brilliant and blind, these applied scientists are prime examples of the Idiot Savant mentality that rules our times - as was documented (at times unknowingly) by Stewart Brand in The Media Lab: Inventing the Future at M.I.T.. Now recognized as one of the indispensable design centers of the high-tech economy , the Media Lab was conceived by Nicholas Negroponte and former M.I.T. President and Kennedy Science Advisor, Jerome Wiesner, with what might seem the best of intentions. In the late seventies, Negroponte foresaw the approaching computer-driven convergence of all electronic communications and intuitively grasped that the changes could be both profitable and politically profound. By promising insider access to the coming age of the information economy, he and the now deceased Wiesner quickly attracted a hundred sponsors, mostly corporate, including all the tv networks, Warner Brothers, Dow Jones, Time, and IBM, to support a center for communications innovation at M.I.T. - an institution where science, technology, and commerce gladly "conflate" as a matter of administrative policy. Despite this heavy dependence on corporate money, the Lab's heady (and implicitly political) aim was "to seize the design initiative - 'invent the future'... [using] computer technology to personalize and deeply humanize absolutely everything." The Lab's</page><page sequence="18">1 1 2 DAVID BOSWORTH interdisciplinary crew of scientists, artists, and educators would democra- tize communications - Brand's own dedication is to "the drafters and defenders of the First Amendment" - and they would do so by turning the passive couch potato of broadcast tv into an active editor and composer, the entrepreneurial maestro of the Information Age.13 Certainly many of the technical changes envisioned by the Lab's creators have already occurred, and we are still in the midst of sorting out the social and political implications. Has, for example, the vast multipli- cation of tv channels really empowered the individual or merely sliced and diced the couch potato into a superlarge order of fries? Will the person- alized internet search engines now under development actually enhance our intellectual independence or render us all the more dependent on our past habits, or on the "taste" of these software editors? Are we on the verge of reviving democracy through the instant access of, say, computerized home voting, or are we descending toward a knee-jerk electorate, inviting an instant consensus even more superficial than the latest televisual poll? (Was O.J. guilty? Should President Clinton have attended Lady DVs funeral? Phone in now and we 'II have the results by the end of our show. ) Will the new technologies spark a return to the inherently democratic economy of small, home-based businesses or merely empower corpora- tions to extend their supervisory control over employees by allowing them to keep an exact key-stroke account of productivity, thus reinventing the tedious tyranny of the factory line for the digital age? And haunting all these questions is a more fundamental one: are we in the midst of humanizing our machinery or, in a dangerous act of disingenuousness, merely finding new ways to mechanize our humanity? One method for previewing likely answers is to examine what the espousers of this ideal wish to "personalize and deeply humanize abso- lutely everything" on behalf of our democracy actually believe about personality, humanity, and freedom. The results, alas, are not encourag- ing. Evidence can be found in Brand's 1987 account, though only with some difficulty, for the author has the curious and perhaps self- interested habit of avoiding the pressing question just when an interview turns most interesting.14 One of the more revealing exchanges occurs during his interview with Wiesner when they arrive on a topic dear to all the scientists of the Media Lab: the evolution of artificial intelligence.</page><page sequence="19">The Science of Self -Deception ' ' 3 "...you ought to be able to make machines that are just a hell of a lot better than the brain..." "You expect that?" Wiesner: "Yeah, not necessarily in my lifetime. No one has given a reason why it can' t be done. They make all kinds of crazy arguments - 'A computer doesn't have a soul.' How do we know that it won' t have the same soul as we do? After all, humans will program it. I don't think questions about identity are very interesting." 15 Wiesner is never challenged on what "better" means, and one is led to wonder what kind of answer he could possibly supply as someone who doesn't find human identity a very interesting question. And the irony remains, of course, that his lack of curiosity on the subject didn't hinder him from playing mentor to Negroponte's supposed ideal of deeply "humanizing" everything. This paradoxical desire to simulate and surpass the human while avoiding a deeper contemplation on the nature of humanity, this quite stunning mix of intellectual audacity and philosophi- cal opacity, proves characteristic of the entire Media Lab project and the broader fields of artificial intelligence and artificial life with which it is allied. Chris Schmandt, for example, whose speciality at the Lab is cybernetic speech recognition, defines his goal as follows: I would like the machine to pick up that I'm not having a particularly good day and be supportive or something ... ask me what's wrong ... ask me if I'd like a sandwich. If you're having a bad day and somebody does some little thing for you, it can really swing your whole day around. 16 Note how easily "the machine" slides into a "somebody" who can be "supportive or something" and the truly pathetic prospect of having one's whole day "swing around" as a result of a preprogrammed act of mechani- cal "sympathy" - which would, in fact, stand in the same relation to true compassion as for-pay phone sex now stands to actual desire.</page><page sequence="20">1 14 DAVID BOSWORTH Clearly the new technology of the Information Age can help dissolve some of the isolation caused by the old technology of the Industrial Age with its ever-ramifying bureaucracies and soul-killing specialization of production-line tasks. But every new technology we let into our communal home conceals within it, Trojan horse-like, a largely unknown invasive force, as well as new ways to reconfigure and disguise the oldest errors in human thought, and in a vision such as Schmandt's we can glimpse the old industrial hubris renewing itself with the same results. His technical fix to a "bad day" merely reinvents our current isolation, providing a kind of loneliness upgrade. In this supposedly personalized future, our machines may be "soft" but they will continue to obscure and replace human relations, leaving us not only economically but emotionally dependent on the machinery around us. B. Imaginary Friends: the Seance of Cyber- Solipsism Schmandt's work is no exception. His delusory hope for a comforting machine - robot as talking lap dog - is directly expressive of Negroponte's overall vision, as was evident from his first publication, The Architecture Machine. There, he imagined creating for the architect a cybernetic co-designer, not a tool but a colleague, and in the most romanticized of terms. "The partnership [wouldn't be] one of master and slave but rather of two associates that have a potential and desire for self- fulfillment."17 When man and machine would "converse," their dialogue would be "so intimate - even exclusive - that only mutual persuasion and compromise would bring about ideas, ideas unrealizable by either conversant alone,"18 enacting "a symbiosis that is a cohabitation of two intelligent species."19 A machine that can converse, and compromise, and persuade, a machine that desires self- fulfillment. A machine that is a species. We've crossed from virtual to actual, quickly sliding to the otherwise impossible - which is to say, we have moved from science into fantasy as reason informs the will to absolute power. When Negroponte aims to "make a friend," he believes both that he can "make" it in the industrial sense, and that it will be a "friend" in the human sense. This, in part at least, is what he actually means by "deeply humanizing absolutely everything."</page><page sequence="21">The Science of Self-Deception ' 15 Six years or so after Negroponte published The Architecture Machine, his ambitions progressed from merely inventing a new friend to actually raising the illustrious dead. In a grant application, he proposed "a random access multimedia system that would allow users to hold conver- sations with famous deceased artists." 20The giddy plan to cybernetically revive a Rembrandt, say, recalls Hans Moravec' s example, cited earlier, of "a simulated Descartes" and helps expand that professor's fantasy of intellectual manifest destiny backward in time as well as forward: in the cyber-utopia to come, not only will we live forever, we will be able to bring the dead back to life. Following the logic of such ambitions, we can imagine a kind of "dream team," a wax museum of historical geniuses robotically revived to comfort and advise us. Multiple oracular Obi Wans instantly accessible to each of us for intimate and exclusive dialogues. Just "Mozart and Me" (Newton, Plato, Cervantes and Me), persuading, com- promising, exchanging ideas in a mutual search for self-fulfillment. What is disturbing about such notions, of course, is not the desire to learn from the past by consulting what the dead have said or done, but the naive literalism of an imagination which wants to believe that such an exchange would actually constitute a real conversation. Negroponte does admit that the proposal was "cuckoo" at the time - not, however, because it had all the inherent plausibility of a seance but rather because he was "wildly outside [his] depth in, among other things, natural-language processing."21 For the likes of Negroponte and Moravec, conversing with the dead is, in other words, a technological problem and so, like all such problems, eventually solvable if properly researched and generously funded. I would love to be able to say here that folly is folly whatever the era and simply move on, but as technological leaders in a technological age, these men have real authority and the mystifying luster of their technical savviness requires that we unveil the obvious idiocy of some of their aims. I will start with this: the ambition to converse with the dead is not only ethically suspect but categorically impossible. Even if one reductively defines the human mind as simply equal to the material brain, it is already well-established that daily experience of all sorts - physical, intellectual, emotional, sexual - has a dramatic impact on the brain's internal organization. Which is to say that even at</page><page sequence="22">1 1 6 DAVID BOSWORTH the level of microscopic morphology, mind and place are demonstrably interdependent. We evolve as individuals, then, not only out of the complex and unique patterning of our genes, but also out of an incredibly complex pattern of experiential moments, both simultaneous and succes- sive. Like Saraswati's immanent words, each of those moments has a meaning, its meaning is what it does, and what it does (in part) is change who and what we are. The turbulent merger and succession of all those moments, including all importantly how we choose to react to them, makes for each of us a unique history. And because the flow of history is, as William Irwin Thompson has noted, irreversible and nonrepeatable,22and because we are not only carried by that flow but defined as individuals through our interaction with it, no single human life (even if cloned) is ever repeatable. Let me be clear. Fond as I am of hyperbole as a rhetorical device, I do mean to be literal here. Whether through the materialist approach of genetic engineering or the rationalist approach of computer programming, the re-creation of an historical personality can not be done - ever. Es ist verboten. The agency of restriction may be a wise or jealous God, or it may be a cruel or indifferent universe, but the fact remains that the replication of individual identity is not a technological problem beyond our current intellectual means; it is instead a kind of existential non sequitor. The grounds of the human condition cannot support the event. Nor, for that matter, can the presumptions of democracy abide it. To be identical, two human personalities would not only have to occupy the same time and space, which is physically impossible; they would also have to make the exact same sequence of decisions in response to that setting - for even the slightest deviation could, like the butterfly's wings, cause a storm of eventual difference. Yet the exact replication of a sequence of decisions suggests not the elastic codes of free speech but the intractable mechanics of determinism. It defines the human condition as little more than a complex version of the Skinner box, wherein the same set of stimuli will unfailingly reproduce the same pattern of response. And for all the crudity of Skinner's science, he at least grasped that such a conception of human behavior necessarily takes us "beyond freedom and dignity." Negroponte' s desire to clone identity on behalf of democracy is, by contrast, both incoherent and disingenuous. The metaphysics he presumes implicitly</page><page sequence="23">The Science of Self -Deception 1 1 7 refutes the politics he pitches. This is a truth, however, one is unlikely to grasp if one actually believes "that questions of identity are [not] very interesting." C. Soft Sell: the Robotics of Pseudoegalitarianism The return to Wiesner's quote is fitting here because it was this very proposal that first drew Negroponte to his attention. The partnership that spawned the Media Lab was itself born out of the fantastically fallacious presumption that we can re-create the dead. And while it is quite true that the scientific pursuit of even a loony idea can spur serendipitous discoveries along the way, we mustn' t ignore the deep error in Negroponte' s thinking, nor the darker will that such rosy reasoning - the professed aim to "deeply humanize absolutely everything" - can actually conceal. Indeed, the shadows of the authoritarian imagination were almost imme- diately apparent in Negroponte' s own work. Just two years after first proposing his architecture machine, he wrote a sequel {Soft Architecture Machines) in which the newly minted intimate friend acquired a far more potent identity. In its "desire for self-fulfillment," Negroponte' s "soft" machine now apparently required not equality but dominion. Like some country song about love gone wrong, the so-called exclusive relationship between man and machine had ended with the man being dumped. The sentimental promise of professional companionship had resulted instead in professional extinction as Negroponte waxed so bold as to propose an "architecture without architects."23 As with the Media Lab to come, the expressed rationale was political egalitarianism. Negroponte' s operating assumption was that the individual "could design [his or her] own home, better than any other person."24 By dumping the architect and becoming the intimate "friend" of the customer instead, the new machine would not only eliminate the cost of a middleman but also the inherent "paternalism" of the professional.25 After "conversing" with the customer and learning his or her supposedly unique and "ever changing needs,"26 Negroponte' s machine would obedi- ently translate those personal desires into practical, highly adaptable designs. And lest we worry that this Utopian formula prescribes an even</page><page sequence="24">1 1 8 DAVID BOSWORTH deeper dependence on the machine than previously existed on the archi- tect, Negroponte suggests that the true authorship would rest with the human being. For while the interpretive "competence" would belong to the cyber-friend, the artistic "talent" would be the customer's. Thus, the overall result of their partnership - robotic competence enacting human talent - would be a democratic architecture uniquely obedient to, and expressive of, the creativity of each individual. 27 There are multiple, egregious problems with such a fantastic scheme but only one of them concerns me here. We will ignore for now the dubious insistence on "ever changing needs" and its possible alliance with the induced dissalisi actions of a fashion-based definition of individu- ality. We will avoid considering, too, the problem of community and how it could ever be expressed within such an individualistic architecture. Nor will we take up just yet the disingenuous and dualistic notion of creativity that would separate talent from competence, thinking from doing. What is most important in Negroponte' s account instead is his failure to note a third if invisible presence in the room when customer and cyber-friend converse. The moral authority of his scheme, after all, depends on its claim to eliminate the paternalism of the professional, the middleman whose arrogant faith in his own expertise deflects and obscures the "talent" of the customer. Yet Negroponte fails to note that his machine is itself a creation of professionals, or that, as a product, it will be programmed, sold, and serviced with all the same possibilities for bias, price-gouging, arrogance, and incompetence as the architect's product. By casting his robot in anthropomorphic terms and in a Utopian future where he can imagine the problem of bias has been magically solved, he deflects attention from the actual source of authority in this new relationship. In fact, it's not the "friend" that has superseded the architect both intellectually and economically but the maker of that "friend" - someone, in other words, suspiciously like Negroponte himself. The sentimental notion of robot as intimate companion is a metaphorical Trojan horse within which hides the potential new paternalism of Negroponte' s own professional guild of robotics engineers. And while his claim to an architectural liberation on the people's behalf would appear to conceal the far less rarefied motive of professional rivalry and perhaps even jealousy, his Utopian belief that we can be "talented" without</page><page sequence="25">The Science of Self- Deception 119 bothering to become competent merely upgrades the fatuous narcissism of the Sovereign Self - one thinks a concept and it therefore is - even as it echoes that most familiar of commercial platitudes: the customer is always right. In short, the promises of Negroponte' s futuristic "politics" sound an awful lot like the perennial ones of self-interested salesmanship. In them, we can hear a new version of the old shuck whereby one flatters the client to win his commission (What an EYE you have, Mr. Bosworth!): a tactic not unknown even to paternalistic architects. Negroponte might be right that we need better ways to translate "soft" ideas into "hard" actualities, vague hopes into real hopes. But he is wrong in stressing the utter uniqueness of those desires and in his implicit equating of human happiness with the instant satisfaction of "ever chang- ing needs" - a model which is driven, in fact, by the Market's enormous ideological investment in exciting our perpetual psychological insecurity. He is wrong, too, in presuming that a purity of talent can exist absent a practical sense of implementation. For someone whose whole scheme idealizes "conversation," he conveniently forgets here that creativity is itself a conversation between abstract mind and concrete place, between the ideal and the real. Likewise, Negroponte is correct in noting that an o verdependence on professional expertise has subverted the character of our democracy, but deluded in imagining that the solution resides in conversing with our servant/machines rather than with our peer/neighbors. As the Clinton team' s use of the Resumix machine and Perot' s manipulation of telephonic voting vividly show, liberty always depends more on human character than technical cleverness. Effective democracies evolve from the slow enactments of good will and competence, not the instant gratifications of sovereign will and pure talent, which, as the figments of narcissistic fantasy, are instead the constant source of both private misery and public discord. And emerging from those figments is a further fantasy: the delusion that machines can ever interpret our own will for us without at the same time shaping that will; that any system, robotic or not, can be "value- free." By calling his robots "friends" and emphasizing his reformist intention to convert hard machines to soft, Negroponte distracts us from the ultimate intention of his Utopian thinking which is less to subvert the mechanization of the Industrial Age than to complete it. At the end of his</page><page sequence="26">1 20 DAVID BOSWORTH program, even the most intimate of human relations will be mediated by machines - supposedly soft, supposedly friendly, but machines nonethe- less. Machines his team has made. This expansive desire to interweave his own technological exper- tise into every aspect of our lives - to command, as it were, every communications "interface" - appears almost immediately in Soft Archi- tecture Machines. As with the paternalism of architects, however, Negroponte raises the topic only to claim that he wants to save us from it by rendering its effects soft, responsive, humane. In his vision of the distant future, he reports, these architectural machines would expand from intimate companions to entire "cognitive physical environments." Rather than merely help us design our homes, they would become our homes: we would actually live inside the machines themselves. The implications of such a shift in scale from equivalence ("friend") to enclosure ("environ- ment") make it imperative that we "play with these ideas scientifically and explore applications of machine intelligence that totter between unimaginably oppressive and unbelievably exciting." 28 Even with the acknowledgment of potential oppression (which is raised, characteristically, as an implicit pitch for funding here), there is more than a whiff of megalomania in both of Negroponte' s versions of the future. And if this rapid progression from technology as tool to technology as total (and potentially totalitarian) environment seems familiar, it is because such thinking re-enacts the same psychological schedule we have been tracking all along, the characteristic way that reason panders to will under rational materialist thought. If we chart the rapid evolution of Negroponte' s architecture machine: machine as servant - } friend/peer - } all-enclosing superior what we see is an eerie recounting of the Uriah Heep subplot in Dickens' s David Copperfield: 29 4 urn ble underling - } indispensable partner - } all- controlling boss in a process that recalls the robotic agenda naively celebrated in 1933 by which man conforms to his erstwhile servant, science.</page><page sequence="27">The Science of Self-Deception 1 2 1 The difference rests, Negroponte would claim, in the inherently democratic nature of digital information and in the high-minded motives of the Media Lab itself. So long as its science is permitted to find and its (funding) industries are allowed to apply, we will personalize, and human- ize, and liberate absolutely everything. Following its seizure of the design initiative, we will still live inside an ever more elaborate and enclosing machine, but our prospects there will wonderfully reverse from "unimaginably oppressive" to "unbelievably exciting." We might be wary, though, of such extreme analyses with their utopia / dystopia polarities and note how the temper remains totalitarian ("absolutely everything") even as it claims to serve democracy. Should we really place our faith, as the Lab insists, in converting our machines from hard to soft? Or should we worry instead that, whatever the texture, we are still being placed inside a kind of box - a virtual, if velveteen version of Skinner's old excursion "beyond freedom and dignity"? D. Swallowed Whole: In the Techno-Womb of Postindustrial Momism Negroponte' s vision of total enclosure inside a highly personal- ized, paradisiac realm of soft, humane responsiveness - the tactile home that is our ours and ours alone, that knows our every need and serves us both exclusively and unconditionally - vividly recalls the total nurturing of everyone's first and irretrievable home, the maternal womb. As such, the future sketched by this design initiative might seem more like the dream of infancy than the quest of maturity, a sentimental regress into the nest of passive nostalgia rather than psychological progress into the arena of accountable freedoms. Under Negroponte' s reforms, his self-pro- claimed assault on paternalism, the harsh father of technology learns to hug and share its feelings (through user-friendly interfaces) and, bending its gender, becomes instead a kind of New Age mom. Superficially this might seem attractive, especially when reflecting on the twenties and thirties when political paternalism showed its ugliest face. The problem with such a model, however, is that even when switching roles technology remains the parent, humanity the child. Mothers, after all, can abuse their authority too, especially through refusing to allow their aging children to leave the orbit of their soft (that is, emotional) control.</page><page sequence="28">1 22 DAVID BOSWORTH It is no accident that the socio-psychological phenomenon of the all-controlling mother (first called "momism" by Philip Wylie in the early forties)30 became especially apparent in America after World War II when an era of peace and prosperity allowed the logic of the economy to extend unchecked. Trends long in the making - the withdrawal of fathers from the household, first through long commutes and then divorce; the emascu- lation of work as independent farmers and small shopkeepers became drone-employees within corporate hierarchies; the expansion of business into the service domain; and the saturation of a consumer ethos which induced insecurity to pitch self-indulgence - together created a new psycho-cultural dynamic of social anxiety within environments of con- cealed control. As was documented by David Riesman in The Lonely Crowd, achievement was now being linked less with autonomy than with ap- proval. Yet approval was becoming ever more elusive and short-lived as its status was obscured by the cautious insincerities of office life and as its terms were being fixed to the transitory turns of the fashion cycle - the necessity of acquiring the latest product, hem line, bauble of taste or buzz word of advice. Within the glad-handing maze of the corporate life and inside the broader tent of omnipresent salesmanship (the barkering Big Top raised by the newly national media of radio and tv), aggression assumed its more passive and seductive forms. It posed as concerned (like the close friend in the tv ad who let you know you had bad breath, only to sell you the saving mint); or it waxed jolly (like the laugh track which subtly insisted that if you weren't amused then you didn't "get it" and so were not "with it"); or, most common of all, it shamelessly flattered ("you' ve come a long way, you deserve a break today ..."). But beneath the soft tropes and admiring sighs, the will to control subtly survived, all the more effective for its new disguise. Negroponte's dream of the techno- womb, with its promise of perfect comfort and total control, is but an extreme expression ofthat new dynamic and, as such, less a vision of the future than an exaggeration of the postwar present, mindlessly extending its duplicitous values. The meta- phorical "mother of all products," his new product, the cognitive physical environment, promises to solve the perpetual anxiety of the marketplace society by meeting our "ever changing needs" instantly, and yet without</page><page sequence="29">The Science of Self -Deception 1 23 ever questioning where those needs have come from, whether they are real or ours, whether their constant (and now mechanized) slaking can ever be the basis of a meaningful life. In his idealized description of this environment (where consumerism literally encloses us), we can see the evolving difference between modernist and postmodernist styles of assert- ing authority, the ongoing transformation from industrial paternalism to postindustrial momism. His vision completes the transition from "Life with Father" - the industrial efficiency expert who was the embodiment of an economy which divided work from meaning, workers from their families, and families from their traditional communities - to Life under (or inside) Mother. In his Media Lab, we are offered the promise of a new- and-improved and all-enclosing Ma Bell: the embodiment of an economy which, having divided, will now reunite, inviting us to "reach out and touch someone" through the mediating umbilicais of its communication prod- ucts, service, and advice. Such a conversion might seem a discernible improvement. But its apparent liberation conceals, first, the transfer of the paternalistic industrial economy to the Third World and, second, a further descent into dependency on more intimate grounds. The new emphasis on sensitivity - on "personalizing and deeply humanizing absolutely everything" - diverts us from the realization that the economy has merely changed its style to extend its domain. Having taken control of the traditional paternal roles of construction, provision, and protection, it now expands into the more maternal roles of food-making, child-raising, commiseration, setting the rules for domestic relations. Having once commanded us physically in the factory, detailing the exact pace and shape of our bodily motions, it now commands us psychologically in the office, and even at home, by prescribing new schedules of appropriate emotion: a fashion-line of "feelings" that is even more slippery, ever-shifting, and anxiety-inducing than the style-based status of the clothing industry. As it turns out, despite the awesome instancy of our technology, we can yt just reach out and touch someone. Not only do we have to keep buying the latest software and hardware upgrades (and the expert advice on how to make them work) or risk becoming "incompatible" with "the ever changing needs" of the information economy itself; we also need to be instructed by copywriters, sensitivity trainers, diversity advisers,</page><page sequence="30">1 24 DAVID BOSWORTH parenting experts, liability lawyers, campus sex-code authors, corporate culture columnists, ethicists, image spinners, and damage consultants - all the bibles of Babel in the baffle of self-help - in the ever changing intricacies, the super-subtle diplomacies of "reaching" and "touching." The late Christopher Lasch was especially eloquent on the ways in which social service experts and the "caring industries"31 disempowered families, undermining parental confidence in order to pitch their own expertise. He persisted, however, in calling this co-opting of domestic authority "the new paternalism," a phrase whose connotations distract us from the true temper and tactics of the new economy which, invading maternal domains, has assumed a more maternal guise. The old industrial paternalism was overt, intrusive, martial, mechanical (hard); the new postindustrial momism is covert, suffusive, therapeutic, informational (soft.) The former boasted boldly of its own authority, flaunting the modernist genius of science, art, and industry; the latter, Barney-like, flatters the authority of "you and me," (the genius of Self in and of itself), hosting the sappy celebrations of self-esteem. Industrial dad, insisting that he "knew best," denigrated our abilities and demanded our obedience; porno mom, insisting that we know best, praises our talent even as she robs us of competence by tucking in our napkins and taking over all our tasks, and touts our autonomy while subtly punishing us whenever we give the slightest offense. The one may strut where the other stoops, but both "parenting styles," we need to note, are designed to conquer. Soft or hard, both enclose us in systems that keep us dependent (and so immature) by revoking or subverting freedom's necessary forms. Under momism, too: science finds - } industry applies - } humanity conforms. E. Inside Out: the Mixed Message of the Scientific Method Once we decode the old motive behind the new mood, the self- deceptions of the "cognitive physical environment" become more famil- iar. In fact, the new rationalists like Negroponte and Schmandt suffer the same confusion between freedom and control as the industrial Utopians</page><page sequence="31">The Science of Self -Deception ' 25 whose authoritarian effects they aim to fix. Now as then, no word is more suspect in their proselytizing rhetoric than the cozy confraternity of we. For within that pseudo-egalitarian plural, as we have already seen, not only are the rights of machines allowed to blur with those of human beings, but the self-interest of the technologist is also confused with that of the total citizenry. What's best for technocracy is disingenuously equated with what' s best for democracy . And this brand of self-deception is not limited to the rarefied labs of robotics engineers but more broadly characteristic of the mind set molded by scientific capitalism. Here, McLuhan's observation that the medium implies its own defining message proves metaphorically apt. Science has become our common sense, the method we use, formally and informally, to distinguish falsehood from fact; its results guide and its rhetoric rationalizes even the most intimate of our daily acts: what we eat, how we make love, how we raise our kids. Yet as our preferred "medium," the scientific method remains, for all its openness to new knowledge, subtly problematic as a mediating model for both humane behavior and democratic practice. Yes, in so much as science literally believes that "nothing is sacred," it invites the broadest license to investigate; and yes, it provides an admirably egalitarian means to adjudicate disputes. In very important ways, its philosophical principles seem harmoniously allied with our political rights to free speech and a fair trial. But those rights apply to the scientists themselves and not to their experimental subjects who are, by contrast, required to submit to the most rigorous controls - and, often, "blindly." There is a dramatic distinction between the experience of those inside the scientist' s investigatory "machine," with its strict protocols, and that of the scientist himself who both knows and controls those protocols, even as he remains outside of their effects. When we try to think scientifically about problems in the social and political domain, we often fail to acknowledge the crucial distinction between those two very separate models of power relations: the peer exchange between scientists and the necessarily authoritarian exchange between the scientist and his experimental subject - who, despite the term, is treated more like an object. As Hazlitt warned about the specialized intellect, it is all too easy for us when thinking scientifically about social issues to speak the tropes of egalitarian freedom even as we</page><page sequence="32">1 26 DAVID BOSWORTH enact anew the protocols of hierarchical control. Democratic rhetoric conceals authoritarian character, as people "under study" cease to be people and become more like data, arrayed to "furnish an occasion for the display of [our own] mental superiority and the gratification of [our own] vanity." The ease of the error suggests a caution: as the ancients were advised to beware Greeks bearing gifts, we would be wise to beware technologists proselytizing freedom. We should be especially wary of technologists who invite us to live our whole lives inside their new environments, for despite the egalitarian we' s of their Utopian promises, such places are, inherently, more theirs than ours. Which is to say: if society were, in fact, to become an all-enclosing machine, the results might very well be both "unbelievably exciting" to those, like Negroponte, who are designing that machine and "unimaginably oppressive" to the rest of us inside it. F. Dazed &amp; Confused: the Planned Obsolescence of the Moral Intelligence Nevertheless, in these sick days, when the Born of Heaven first descries himself (about the age of twenty) in a world such as ours, richer than usual in two things, in Truths grown obsolete, and Trades grown obsolete, - what can the fool think but that it is all a Den of Lies, wherein whoso will not speak Lies and act Lies, must stand idle and despair. - Thomas Carlyle, Sartor Resartus If such a claim sounds alarmist, it is important to note the specific source of the alarm. Idon'texpect, in this momist era of soft machines and increasingly subtle salesmanship, anything like oppression in the military sense. "Unimaginably" is best understood as literal here: that is, as with the blind subject of an experiment, our oppression will emerge out of our inability to imagine not only the mechanics but the meanings and values invisibly encoded in our new, all-enclosing cyber-environment. Less</page><page sequence="33">The Science of Self- Deception 1 27 captive than captivated, we will dance to lyrics we don't understand and pattern our days to ends obscured by the opacity of the system's protocols - its as yet unmapped social, ethical, and spiritual walls. As McLuhan and others have tried to remind us, the social effects of any new technology are always opaque at the start and, in this our age of accelerating change when Trades and Truths become obsolete at a metaphorical moment's pace, theirs is a warning that ought to alarm us. The inevitable lag between invention and comprehension predicts a future where the "new and improved" will constantly keep us "dazed and confused." By shifting the terms of self-mystification, the perpetual motion of high-tech progress will keep us mired in a spiritual stasis, ever estranged by its montage of masks from the meaning of our place and so from the compass of accountable acts. To chart the mechanics ofthat estrangement, we can glance again at Hazlitt's critique of the romantic temperament. There, anxious to deflate Wordsworth's sentimental intimation that "one day... the triumph of humanity and liberty may be complete," he proposes instead a more circumscribed notion of human nature, one that is seasonal rather than progressive: All things move, not in progress, but in a ceaseless round; our strength lies in our weakness; our virtues are built on our vices; our faculties are as limited as our being; nor can we lift man above his nature more than above the earth he treads.32 The words are Hazlitt's but the attitude is both ancient and perennial. Aspiring to the universal, this view of human nature would prescribe not the tenets (which will vary greatly from tribe to tribe) but the temperament necessary to the moral life: that habit of humility that scales personal ambition to existential possibility; sculpts what we want to who we truly are. Yet when seen from our lofty ledge of material progress, the comparison meant to seal Hazlitt's argument actually subverts it. His image of the impossible - airborne man - has become instead such an artifact of the conventional that it actually proposes the opposite of what the critic intended: if lifting our natures and our bodies are of equivalent difficulty, then "the triumph of humanity and liberty" through the eleva-</page><page sequence="34">1 28 DAVID BOSWORTH tion ofthat nature may indeed soon "be complete" - and, one might easily imagine (as do Negroponte and Moravec), through the same instrumental, technological means. Only on further meditation do we realize that, despite the failure of the metaphor, the principle still applies. The history of human flight more confirms than refutes Hazlitt's view of human nature: in the sky, as on the ground, "alternate good and evil... [do still] sway the bosoms and businesses of men."33Our new heavenly stage has housed the same complicated character that paced the parapets of Elsinore, one whose possibilities range, in a ceaseless round, from Horatio' s loyalty to Claudius' s betrayal, from Neil Armstrong's "small step" to the terrorist "statement" that sends two hundred people burning to the ground. The collapse of Hazlitt' s metaphor matters, though. The obsoles- cence of his reference is a perfect example of how material change can keep us estranged from the wisdom of the past, which is largely dressed in the metaphorical apparel of an agricultural economy long absent from our immediate lives. And now even the mechanical metaphor of the Industrial Age - the "common sense" of clockwork science and linear print - is being displaced. The new order is neither agricultural nor mechanical but electronic and cybernetic. Just as the natural cycle of the seasons and natural motions of the body once seemed to disappear inside the controlled "boxes" of the lab and the factory, now the rule of the clock and the linear logic of cause-and-effect seem to disappear inside the magical sphere of the Information Age, where with but the flick of a switch or the click of a mouse, there is here, and then is now. When the scenery of daily life becomes "virtual" in such a way, there is no natural or mechanical limit on the forms it can take. When the machinery making that scenery is driven by an economy utterly invested in provoking a climate of "ever changing needs," change itself ceases to be a choice and becomes instead a kind of onerous fate. Driven by the dual engines of fashion and invention, not only our Trades but all the trim and tackle of daily life become obsolete and, with them, whole legacies of metaphorical advice, the proverbs and parables left behind to guide us, go quickly out-of-date. So it is that the fundamental experience of our times is strangely and painfully mixed. Our new and amazing physical empowerments also</page><page sequence="35">The Science of Self-Deception 129 invite a metaphysical disillusionment. As "brought to [us] by" the allied imperatives of the Technical Fix and the Fashion Line, our life of constant progress also prescribes a destiny of ruthless discontinuity through the relentless extinction of meaningful signs. We escape from tribal bias (the sort of liberation that can, truly, humanize our behavior) only to lose as well a sense of ultimate basis. Having once thought our way out of Nature, we now seem to have invented our way out of History. Yet like that first leap forward, the second can also seem like a fall, less an escape than an expulsion - the loss of our home. This extinction of meaning is yet one more "environmental impact" of our blind adherence to the technological imperative. For the more we seal ourselves inside the techno- womb of our global information machine, the more likely we are to presume that the immediate economy equals our ultimate reality, that the virtual is the actual, and that, therefore, the failure of a metaphor's vehicle cancels the tenor of its perennial truth. Losing faith in the reality of those definitive truths, we gravitate toward something very much like the extreme alternatives of self-definition that Carlyle described. Left to invent ourselves on scientific capitalism's virtual stage, either we enter the "Den of Lies," joining its colloquy of spinmeisters and admen, its merchants of immortality. Or we "stand idle and despair," sending up sighs of alienated irony. To the right: Moravec's lab. To the left: Beckett's stage. G. Mission: Control (Freedom in a Box) Thou shalt be as free As mountain winds. But then exactly do All points of my command. - The Tempest, Shakespeare In fact, despite an absolute opposition of temperaments, Moravec ' s Utopian lab and Beckett's dystopian stage are very much the same. In the common extremity of the one's optimism and the other's pessimism, they share a fixation on predictability, a delusory investment in the certainty of</page><page sequence="36">1 30 DAVID BOSWORTH results whether total triumph or inescapable despair. Each is solipsistic in his way, insisting, after Milton's Satan, that the mind either can be (Moravec) or must be (Beckett) "its own place." Both would enclose human consciousness in the sort of conceptual nutshell that Hamlet proposed only to reject; but whereas the engineer proclaims that shell to be the empery of boundless space, the playwright insists that it is merely a cell, dim and confining, which we can never escape. What both views exclude is the innate permeability of human identity - the very quality that makes it so "interesting." Both are anxious to forget that our wrapping in this world is not an opaque shell but a translucent skin, that the border between the single mind and its surround- ing place is porous and interactive, requiring each of us to balance possibility with vulnerability, the projections of hope with the contractions of fear. Both views wish to dodge the permanent predicament of a consciousness which is at once intelligent and mortal: namely, that we can (indeed must) imagine the future but can never know for sure what will happen next; that we can (indeed must) affect the world, but that we are also and always being affected in turn by an ever-shifting mix of random forces and alien wills. The opposing fantasies of absolute authority and utter helpless- ness are alike in this: each wishes to eradicate the tension, interpretive and dramatic, constantly present in our middling condition. By radical elevation or demotion, each wants to remove us firmly and finally from this busy way station where we hover, ever anxious, between the submission of the beasts and the dominion of the gods. When my wish is either always or never the world's command, I am magically freed of all contention. When the end is fixed by either irrefutable sovereignty or irremediable incompetence, all the stress of combative difference - between separate selves or self and natural world - simply dissolves, and the emotional tempest of the moral life is replaced by the sanitized safety of a mechanical calm. Gone, the adjuring ghosts, the disturbing dreams, the urgent yet ambiguous claims to our allegiance. Gone forever, the mortal stakes of decision-making. In life, as re-imagined by both Moravec and Beckett, there shall be no Hamlets. When every maybe is reduced to a must, we are freed of all the chanciness and challenge that vivify human consciousness.</page><page sequence="37">The Science of Self-Deception 1 3 1 "Safe" inside our conceptual shells, we are freed, in short, of freedom itself. I have already tried to show how the desire to recreate the minds of the dead is inimical to the deeper presumptions of liberty . The same sort of self-deception (confusing the condition of freedom with the imposition of control) haunts both Moravec's immortality project and Negroponte's broader vision of inventing truly humanized, "autogenic" machines with their own unique identities.34 For a moment, though, let's grant the latter the fulfillment of his dream. Let' s imagine that his Media Lab has created machines that can converse and confide and persuade, that do desire self- fulfillment. Let' s assume that they are, indeed, a "species," intelligent and responsive, capable of contextual learning and, therefore, of having their own histories and, therefore, of developing their own idiosyncratic person- alities. Let' s assume, too, that famous dead have been revived for collégial consultation and intimate advice. The question remains, then, what rights do these unique or reconstituted beings themselves possess? How free are they to achieve their specific desires for self-fulfillment? Under the Media Lab' s scheme, richly funded by hundreds of corporations, won't they be, in effect, little more than high-tech commodities: "personality modules"35 bought and sold on the market, stored in dens or closets, pirated for profit, forced to undergo "re-education" via software upgrades - only to be erased when, following Moore's Law, they go quickly out-of-date? The first and most essential freedom in any conversation is the right to refuse to participate. In the land of the free, even a prisoner isn't forced to speak, and every citizen but a prisoner is allowed to leave the room. But Negroponte's cybernetic being will not be so free. His digitalized Mozart or Newton or Frank Lloyd Wright will speak only when spoken to, and can only leave when we want them to - that is, only when we turn off our random access multimedia system. As Aladdin has his genie in a lamp, Negroponte would keep his genius in a box.36 Just like the egregiously self-promoting postmodern artists whose career ascendance paralleled Negroponte' s, the technologist wants to "appropriate" the great mind to use it for his own designs. If you can' t paint as well as Rembrandt, you xerox one of his luminous portraits and sign it with your name. If you can't design a beautiful building, you "rebuild" the architect who did, then</page><page sequence="38">1 32 DAVID BOSWORTH patent or purchase his simulated self. How thrilling to click Frank Lloyd Wright on and off, to have the "paternalistic" genius perpetually under one's own paternal thumb.37 And how comforting to buy or build an "understanding friend"38 who, as Chris Schmandt imagines, will always 'be there' to sense and soothe one's troubled moods. Yet if the machine actually has its own desires for self- fulfillment, it would have its own schedule of ambition, its own potentially recalcitrant will. The essence of a friendship, after all, is that its commitments are freely chosen; implicit in the friends' tacit agreement to suspend or subordinate strict self-interest is the mutual right to end that agreement. As most of us discover before the age of ten, the condition of freedom arms every erstwhile friend with the power to betray, and it is precisely the refusal to exercise this perpetual possibility that makes a lasting friend so special, so dear. If one of the Lab's machines actually acquired the capacity to be an understanding friend, then, it would have the freedom that all friends have. If it happened to notice that Schmandt were having a bad day, it might choose to offer him a sandwich - but then it might not. Perhaps, as is quite commonly the case with beings that desire self-fulfillment, the machine itself is having a bad day. Perhaps it believes that its own unique history (including its "friendship" with Schmandt) has been unduly harsh or oppressive, in which case it might actually be happy that the paternal- istic scientist is having a bad day. It might even mock him or deceptively stalk him by pretending to succor him in a momist way. Indeed, if it were like Negroponte's soft architecture machine (a Uriah Heep in waiting), it might take advantage of Schmandt' s bad mood to remove this inefficient middleman, triumphantly assuming his position itself.39 Of course, Schmandt doesn't want an actual friend with a will of its own, for such a friend would require of him a reciprocity of kindnesses and, more frightening, would always hold over him the power to betray. Nor does Negroponte really want a fully free Frank Lloyd Wright, who, after all, if offered the chance to have an intimate chat with your average undistinguished architect, might simply refuse. Instead, he wants a machine that appears to be sensitive, alive, intelligent - that has the "look-feel" of autonomy - but that is, nevertheless, obedient to his will. The sentimental projection of the virtual friend is used to hide the</page><page sequence="39">The Science of Self -Deception 1 3 3 calculated construction of an actual lackey. Shifting self-deceptively between the two models of authority that characterize science, he wants to believe in the peer scientist - the collégial equal, "as free as mountain winds" - even as he fashions that peer inside his own lab, keeping it subject to "all points of [his] command." The temptation of such a self-deception is as perennial as it is dangerous, one of those constancies of human nature that Hazlitt warned against and Shakespeare dramatized. In The Tempest when Gonzalo is shipwrecked on an apparently unoccupied island, he manages to conjure up a Utopian fantasy that matches almost exactly, in Renaissance terms, the avid optimism of the postindustrial techno-womb: the same pseudoegalitarian politics, the same promise of a super-nurturing environ- ment. If he were "king on't," Gonzalo speechifies, nature on this island "should bring forth, / Of its own kind ... all abundance." On his plantation, there would be no war, weapons, toil, strife; no need for laws or for paternalistic hierarchies. No occupation; all men idle, all; And women too, but innocent and pure; No sovereignty - At which point, Sebastian interrupts with the wry reminder: "Yet he would be king on't." And Antonio adds the one-line analysis that might serve as the metaphorical caution against all such Utopian plans, wherein the promises of perfection perpetually conceal the imposition of raw will: "The latter end of his commonwealth forgets his beginning." 40</page><page sequence="40">1 34 DAVID BOSWORTH III Minding Our Place: The Freedom and Dignity of Humility A. Captain Clock: the Crypto-Conversions of Scientific Thought They that make [idols] are like unto them; so is everyone that trusteth in them. - Psalm 115 Near the opening of Brian Moore's arresting movie, Black Robe, a small congregation of Algonquins stare, mesmerized, at a pendulum clock which has been set on its own altar as if it were a statue of Mary or the figure Jesus hung on the cross. The year is 1634. They are in a crude mission church in the early days of French Quebec, and when the clock finally chimes (the event they have all been waiting for), these intelligent, mature, and self-sufficient Native Americans murmur in awe and dis- turbed bewilderment: they think the machine, which they dub "Captain Clock," is actually alive - they believe it has talked. This scene powerfully portrays the sort of profound misunder- standing that inevitably occurs when diverse cultures meet, especially the bafflement imposed by new technologies. Here, the author's choice of object is especially apt, for the clock - "time" literally captured, cast in metal and rendered abstract - is the perfect compression of the new instrumental philosophy that has invaded the continent and will soon eradicate the Algonquin way of life. The gun may loudly kill, the keg of liquor blatantly incapacitate, but the voice of the clock relentlessly converts. A society calibrated to the core notions of mechanized time will, inevitably, come to value the precise plan and literal thing over the symbolic narrative and prophetic dream. In such a society, abstract accumulation will replace seasonal self-sufficiency as the economic ideal. The great irony of the scene rests in this: while the Algonquins mistakenly believe that the clock is alive, they see far more clearly than the settlers themselves how much, even as early as 1634, the philosophy of mecha-</page><page sequence="41">The Science of Self -Deception 135 nized time has come to define European life; that, in a very real way, the clock is the Frenchmen' s captain - the son of the lord that now commands them. The natives' own overt, almost worshipful fascination with the voice of the clock, the power they assign it as opposed to their puzzled indifference to the rituals of the cross, suggests the covert transformation that has already taken place in the land and time of Rene Descartes and that, through the theories of Newton, will soon redefine the universe itself in clockwork terms. The settlers believe that they are converting the "savages" to Christianity, unaware that they themselves have been, and are being, converted to the profoundly unreligious philosophies of rationalism and materialism through their daily submission to the invisible values of the new technologies. The French still wear or revere the "black robes" of the priest, donning the decorative habits of the old spirituality; inside, however, the deepest structures of personal belief and social life are being realigned to the new values of efficiency, regularity, objectivity, and material accumulation. 41 Black Robe elaborates with painful exactitude the differences between the Native American and European world views, yet in doing so, it also manages to uncover that universal grounding of human experience which links each group to the other, and both to us. Even as it evokes the deep sadness that properly attends the loss of a whole way of life, the film refuses to condescend to the Algonquin, Iroquois, and Huron by simply casting their fate in the homogenizing glow of a sentimental victimhood. The individuals of all tribes are allowed that measure of freedom - to know but never know for sure; to affect while being affected in turn - that anxiously animates the human condition. In such a world, where "alter- nate good and evil [still can] sway the bosoms and businesses of men," individual human identity remains an interesting, the interesting question. In such a world, the mortal stakes of decision-making still obtain. And, in fact, the tragic plot turns on a very Hamlet-like sequence of moral indecisi veness under tremendous pressure as the Algonquin leader struggles to understand the true nature of the French priest he has agreed to transport. I cite Moore's film because the complexity of the compassion it evokes provides the best example of the sort of immanent consciousness that can rescue us from the narrow box of a rationalist thought whose walls are opaque to the full meaning of the human place and whose fantasies of</page><page sequence="42">1 36 DAVID BOSWORTH immunity perpetually invite the calamities of folly. Moral opacity ends with acts of intelligent sympathy which, refusing to list into either fundamentalist rigidity or sentimentalist pity, allow us to see/hear/feel our way through the barriers of space, time and cultural difference to locate ourselves in the lives of distant others. And, in fact, to think through, and feel with, the Algonquin as they sit in that mission church is to learn something crucial and exact about our own current lives and so about our possible future. Their cultural confusion and dislocation are true mirrors to our own self-inflicted mental state where the anxious chase after the new-and-improved technique or technology constantly keeps us dazed and confused. In their mesmerized stares before the pendulum clock, we might recognize our own numb faces gathered before the tv set as we grew up, or those of our children today as they play away at their video games. In their amazed deduction that, having spoken, Captain Clock must be alive, we might hear some of today's savviest technologists predicting idiotically the imminent life of their own creations. B. Turing Test: the Self-Extinction of Scientific Wisdom This last likeness is neither coy nor specious, but a disturbing reminder that the narrowness of science's indisputable virtues constantly invites the broader vice of self-delusion. For more than fifty years, Negroponte's and Moravec's field of artificial intelligence has relied on the so-called Turing test as its goal and standard: if, in a blind experiment, a discerning person can not distinguish between the responses of a machine and those of another human being, then that machine must be "intelligent." In one sense, this test seems reasonable and pragmatic. The mission scene in Moore's film reminds us, however, that the conclusion drawn by the discerning person is itself highly subjective. The danger lies in our presuming that discernment is itself a static quality. For the Algonquin, whom only a bigot could call unintelligent - they are uninformed about mechanics, which is something very different - for them, the pendulum clock has passed the Turing test. And given our current pace of change, it is easy to imagine a future moment when we will fail to understand our own inventions and, like those Native Americans, ascribe to them a character, even a life, which they do not have.</page><page sequence="43">The Science of Self-Deception 1 37 Just such a future is sketched in The Media Lab itself when Brand interviews Danny Hillis, the brilliant inventor of the parallel computer and a key thinker in the allied fields of artificial intelligence and artificial life. "I think," Hillis says, "you will have these machines designing their successors, and after awhile we won't understand how they work." Then, just two pages later, this smartest of scientists allows that very opacity - our acknowledged incapacity to understand these future machines - to license a fantasy that mirrors Moravec's mind child almost exactly: "I think the process of machine evolution will lead to things we can' t imagine right now. I think that I'm not going to get to be immortal, but maybe my children will." As with Negroponte's imaginary "intimate friend," the impossible is projected into some imminent future tense - close enough to excite but far enough away to avoid demonstration - where, abraca- dabra, it becomes somehow a plausible end. 42 And the ability to live forever, like the capacity to raise the dead, suggests an entirely different order of self-conception, beside which even the most brazen braying of the Sovereign Self seems modestly measured. The implication was explicitly considered back in 1980 by a NASA team charged with exploring the prospect of our inventing a new "species" of intelligent if artificial creatures. "After all," the team wrote, "[God] is special now because He created us. If we create another race of beings, then aren't we ourselves, in some similar sense, gods?"43 The authors, it should be stressed, were supposedly sober govern- ment scientists, not sci-fi writers or New Age acolytes baying at the moon of the millennium on a mescaline high. The ironies here, multiple and severe, bear recounting. * Modern science, which begins with the banishing of subjectivity - with, especially, the strict exclusion of the pathetic fallacy (ascribing human emotions to natural events) - now arrives at an even more extreme version of pathetic fallacy, mechanical personification: the belief that our machines themselves shall be alive and humane. * Science's self-proclaimedly brave promise to liberate us from the dual dimensions of religious superstition - from our</page><page sequence="44">138 DAVID BOSWORTH demeaning fear of God and our deluded hope for heaven - ends here with scientists proclaiming their own imminent divinity and immortality. * Rationalism's pursuit of pure enlightenment now aims paradoxically toward that moment of embodied ignorance, idealized by the Turing test, when the discerning mind can't distinguish the real from the fake. And all of these ironies, through which the narrow pursuit of science eventually results in the denial of its own premises, are bracketed by, and arise from, a larger and more precedent one: that Western rational philosophy, which is rooted in the ancient Greek injunction to know thyself, has now "progressed" to the point where identity is no longer an interesting question. C. Virtual America: Designing a Society of Self-Deception The pursuit of progress so defined is precisely the prescription for the demise of wisdom in society at large; and as we saw with Skinner, this reductionist error, which allows us to dodge some of the most pressing questions of human existence, was implicit at the start - if not inevitable, then likely. Any philosophy which banishes the subjective mind from its laboratory is in danger of soon believing either that such a mind does not exist at all, or that it is not important, not interesting. When such a philosophy becomes enacted on a broader scale, recalibrating a culture's common sense to its own stringent values, it tends to exclude not only the "affections" but ethical introspection and metaphysical speculation from the daily practice of disciplined thought. Banished, these inherently human pursuits don't cease to exist so much as disappear from clear view; they remain inarticulate and immature, estranged from the language of both reflexive action and authoritative judgment. Our own motives become opaque, and losing a sense of who we are and why we exist, we easily become confused as to how we should behave. For all the data we acquire, we know our selves not - which is to say, in the phrase F ve used before, we become a society of Idiot Savants.</page><page sequence="45">The Science of Self-Deception 1 39 Some of the worst trends of postmodern society, then, are linked to the character of science too broadly applied. If, for example, identity isn't an interesting question, then history, through which identity is shaped and expressed, isn't really interesting either. Respect for the past as a repository of practical wisdom, and for the dead in the deeper metaphysical sense, evaporate - as indeed they have in our vulgarizing culture of the postwar years. If identity isn't an interesting question, then neither is the difference between an original and its duplicate, the authentic and the forged, the actual and the simulated. Surface appearances begin to trump ethical essences, and we arrive exactly where we are: in a Virtual America where spin, packaging, and public relations increasingly define our official reality; and where private ambition pursues its own version of the Turing test, image-making replacing character building as the primary task of personal success. Finally, trapped inside aplace whose avid pursuit of rational facts and material profits utterly lacks an ultimate compass, we find ourselves drawn beyond mere consumption toward addiction and obsession, toward those regimens of self-imprisonment that supply the most reductive answers to human existence. We are drawn, in short, into a kind of mental Skinner box, for the closed psychic spaces of the addict and fanatic are the only "places" where Skinner's theory is actually approximated. In the mind of the obsessed, each stimulus does tend to enact the same robotically predictable response, all ambition compressed into the rigid schedules of the "fix": the drug-of-choice, the ritual bet, the compulsive purchase or sexual fetish, the rote adoration of the star's glossy image. Such cramped and hellish habits demark the true habitat fashioned by radical behaviorism' s Utopian vision. They define what it means - in reality not fantasy - to live beyond freedom, beyond dignity. The great fear traditionally pressed by many of the best science fiction writers has been that science's restless quest for total control will end up creating new mechanisms beyond our control, or even comprehen- sion; that, in Don DeLillo's words, our "appetite for immortality" will invite instead our "universal extinction." No one knows for sure if the eventual products of artificial intelligence will prove politically oppres- sive or physically destructive. What has become painfully clear, however, is that our technological culture has no real ethic of self-restraint, no</page><page sequence="46">1 40 DAVID BOSWORTH training in just saying no to its own enterprise of invention for profit. Consequently, it is hard to imagine how we might prevent the unethical application of a powerful invention. To say so is not to lapse into paranoia but simply to ask for the agencies of prudence, including the designations of taboo, that any society requires if it wishes to remain civilized. As we approach an era of genetic intervention and supercomputers beyond our comprehension, when mainstream scientists openly consider their own divinity and immortality, we might ask ourselves this: is there anything that our can-do culture won 't do? If the only check on our communal behavior is technical or financial feasibility, how shall we avoid the distorting of will which is the moral precedent for a savage rule? D. Sounding the Silence: the Immanence and Resonance of Humility Become what you are. - Pindar Such questions imply a personal as well as apolitical warning. As the allegory of the clock in Black Robe suggests, the more insidious threat of the artificial intelligence movement is not that our computers will become superhuman but that our humanity will become pseudocybernetic, that our behavior may change in important ways without our conscious knowledge or consent. The threat is that - with science finding, industry applying and humanity conforming - each of us may lose if not the political right, then the intellectual clarity to direct his own life. When, dazed and confused by my own ideas, I drift toward folly, my sons are likely to react with an exasperated: Get real, Dad. That highly sensible private advice has its profoundly political side. One of the great reciprocal gifts of a vital democracy, after all, is that it allows us to get real - to address the basic questions of human reality - as individuals. Its liberties encourage a philosophical or religious seriousness which can cultivate, in turn, the very sort of internalized moral realism upon which democracy itself relies. Real freedom can only emerge from informed consent, and consent, to be fully informed, must reach beyond the tacit</page><page sequence="47">The Science of Self-Deception 141 contracts of both the voting booth and the marketplace to the ultimate issues of our origin, nature, and destiny. The admirable desires to maximize our freedom and to "personalize and deeply humanize abso- lutely everything" depend, in other words, on our individual willingness to investigate those very same questions of human identity that science avoids. The narrator of Lawrence DurreW s Justine is being a political as well as an emotional realist when he concludes: "Doesn't everything depend on our response to the silence around us?" ** Amidst all its material successes, there can be no cruder expres- sion of the larger human failure of scientific capitalism - its threat to freedom in the guise of freedom; its actual depersonalizing and dehuman- izing of almost everything - than its compulsive need to prevent that response. Every vista eclipsed, every silence invaded, every pause in the progress of our day colonized by some newly minted "need" or yet another technique to improve our so-called efficiency: has there ever existed a more bogusly busy, a more visually and aurally baffling place? We mustn't presume that this confusion of ours is merely accidental. As with a magnet-powered engine, the pull of Virtual America's avidities is dependent on, and indivisible from, the deliberate push of its avoidances. Its anxious pursuit of fungible facts is driven, in part, by a raw aversion to fundamental truths - those very truths that inform consent and make freedom, collectively and individually, possible. Primary among those truths are these: contrary to the presump- tions of Cartesian rationalism and the Utopian plans that constantly spring out of them, we shall never fully control our own destiny - never talk to the dead at the turn of a switch; never have a friend who can't also betray us; never live forever inside the techno- womb of our own inventions; never "solve" with mathematical certitude the meaning of life. The empowerment of freedom is, finally, inseparable from the experience of uncertainty. Which is why our identity is always a question; why that question is always vitally interesting; and why, too, the temper of our thinking needs to escape the bogus guarantees (virtually opposite but secretly consonant) of both Moravec's hubris and Beckett's humiliation. It would be facile to suggest that our escape will prove an easy matter. As was flagrantly evident in early '98 when the news alternately touted the infallibility of the global market and the marketability of the</page><page sequence="48">1 42 DAVID BOS WORTH presidential phallus, ours is a society uniquely designed to produce hubris and humiliation. I have labored to show here how such high-tech hype and moral squalor are consequentially linked. Contrary to the fretting of Richard Dawkins, it wasn't, after all, the foolish charts of astrology but our highly rationalized systems of law, politics, and free market commerce that brought us, in rapid succession, the vicariously vicious tribalism of the Simpson trial, the emotive necrophilia of the Princess Diana funeral, and the omnidirectional vulgarity of the Clinton sex scandal. Given its origin in the very centers of democratic authority, this last event proved especially discouraging. Day after day we witnessed prosecutors, defense lawyers, presidential advisors, investigatory report- ers, politicians, pollsters, and pundits of every stripe follow the specialized logic of their separate professions and the market-sanctified motive of unchecked self-interest to the almost total exclusion of common sense and fellow-feeling. And as both the arid language of the law and the monkish techniques of genetic science aspired to grasp the fluid meaning of "sexual relations," as the coverage of the New York Times came to mirror that of the tabloid Star, as the President turned the bully pulpit into talk-show tv and erstwhile censorious congressmen voted to release transcripts once worthy only of Hustler magazine, we were forced to watch the ultimate pornographic spectacle: the reduction of free government into a free- falling farce. We saw the final "conflation" of free speech with gossip and of judicial due process with the demeaning moral logic of television's sweeps. The very prevalence of partisan indignation suggested, ironically, a depressing sameness, for even in the rancor of their opposition the individuals involved seemed tacitly allied in their helplessness to do better. Both "the system" and its most empowered citizens gave every evidence of being beyond freedom and certainly beyond dignity. Their public failure poses a final and deeply "personalized" question. It is the same question that has worried me at every level - as an artist and a teacher and a father - for more than a decade now; the one that has driven me beyond the comfortable box of my own specialty to inquiries such as these. The question is simply this: can anyone get real inside the official domains of scientific capitalism's Information Age? Is it possible any longer to live a serious life, one of active freedom and informed consent, within Virtual America's "cognitive physical environ- ment"?</page><page sequence="49">The Science of Self -Deception 143 The opponents of democracy, including Plato, would argue that our current demise follows inevitably from the inherent flaws of self- government. But because I believe with Hazlitt that we share a nature - that, at the deepest level of inquiry, we are created equal - democracy still seems to me the most "elegant" political response to the silence that surrounds us. It is the form that best fits an immediate community to our ultimate identity; the one that grants us the best chance to fulfill our potential and, following Pindar's dictum, become what we are. Our difficulties now don' t emerge from the core notions of democracy but from their subversion. They arise from a science of self-deception whose anti- democratic premises, wedding materialist determinism to rationalist so- lipsism, have co-opted nearly all of democracy ' s provinces with a mission of control. Our problem now, to borrow from Antonio, is that the latter end of our commonwealth has forgotten its beginning. Let' s be clear on what we have forgotten. It is not the originating language of democracy we most miss now - Virtual America is terrify- ingly adept at simulating the rhetoric of freedom; time after time, it passes the Turing test. What we miss instead is democracy's authenticating temper. The way back home begins by shunning hubris for hope, its true alternative. The way out of the slough of humiliation doesn't lie in yet another plot to assume a sovereign throne but in the patient cultivation of humility, its actual antipode. To aspire to be "complete in oneself," as Hans Moravec and millions of would-be Sovereign Selves now do, is to become completely alone, as Beckett's clown and millions of Americans now suffer to know. But that painful estrangement is not the condition we are born to but a choice we make - the choice that Hamlet faced and refused. Reform begins, above all else, by recovering the courage ofthat refusal. To regain the knowledge that informs consent, we need to reject on every level, personal as well as political, the tacit tyranny of the technological imperative, just saying no to its engineer's promise of total control. We should beware this new Greek bearing gifts because our home is not a laboratory and our lives are not experiments. Only in the nutshell of denial can we become as safely exempt as the peer scientist or as helplessly blind as his experimental subject. Our actual place - if we "mind" it in the most immanent and resonant senses ofthat phrase - is far</page><page sequence="50">1 44 DAVID BOSWORTH richer, stranger, and chancier than that. In it, no self-help schedule or soft machine, no invisible hand or savvy technique can spare us from both the mystery of our authority ("to be or not to be") and the sting of uncertainty (those "thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to"). That our minds can imagine realms that our bodies will never reach helps define both the anguish and the wonder, the humility and the hope, of our given place. Our best chances for a free and dignified life still rest in democracy's license to sound the silence and, getting real, to become what we always potentially are: not the kings of, but the communicants with infinite space. Against all the illusory miracles of the science of self-deception, such an identity seems miraculous enough. Notes 1. Leon R. Kass, "The Wisdom of Repugnance," The New Republic, June 2, 1997. 2. In fact, the Cartesian dream of a pure science, like the subsequent dream of a pure art, was always a disingenuous delusion - a convenient eclipse of the moral imagination which, licensed by the methods of isolation and specialization, freed the mind from social concerns. In the past, that delusion was cushioned at least by a strict division of labor between homo sapiens and homo f aber (the thinker and the maker) and by the inevitable lag, sometimes generations long as it was with Mendel's laws, between an idea's discovery and its widespread practical application. But now as space, time, and social roles collapse under the pressures of the information economy, as either scientists themselves patent their discoveries for immediate profit (thinker becomes maker) or the universities that employ them become commodity-producing corporations, the fantasy of purity (and so moral immunity) cannot be sustained. 3.

In modern American politics a key date is 1962 when, at the start of his first race for governor, Ronald Reagan's campaign team hired a behavioral engineering company, BASICO, to drastically revise the candidate's flub-filled campaign style. The strategy - limited access to the press, strictly scripted speeches and note cards with simplistic phrases, using spokespersons for elaboration - prevailed through his presidency. Thus Reagan, the apparently natural man and the favorite of a radical right that despised liberal notions of social engineering, was perhaps the first true "scientifically" packaged candidate.

Although Einstein predicted that mass could be converted to energy at the start of the century, it wasn't until 1 939, when Hahn and Strassmann discovered the potential for a chain reaction in uranium, that the idea of a nuclear bomb became feasible. 13. Stewart Brand, The Media Lab: Inventing the Future at M.I.T (New York:Penguin, 1988), pp. 6-9. 14. Although Brand's book is an informative piece of journalism, the objectivity of his judgments is tainted by the origins of the project. At his own request, he came to The Media Lab not as a journalist but as a consultant, a temporary paid employee. His admission of collaboration in the preface - that Negroponte "helped see the entire project through from my original book proposal to final draft, and the rough design of the cover and the color photo sections are his" - suggests a problematical relationship that few scholars or investigatory journalists would have sustained. Brand's claim that Negroponte "had much of the work of a co-author with none of the control of one" seems disingenuous and ironically reflects Negroponte's own disingenuous account of robotic intelligence as benign servant which will be critiqued in the pages to come.

Heep, the apparent epitome of the "humble servant," is actually the personification of passive aggression; his constant fawning conceals a campaign of total self-interest through which he bribes his way into a partnership with his distracted and grieving boss. 30. See Philip Wylie, "Common Women," A Generation of Vipers (New York:Rinehart, 1942), pp. 184-204. Wylie's prose, composed in the hyperbole of high dudgeon, caused a stir. In a much later book on the sixties youth "rebellion," he more clearly allied momism with consumerism. See The Sons and Daughters of Mom ( New York: Doubleday, 1971), pp.41-55. 31 .

Even Brand's defense of the Lab ("It inflates hubris and then mocks it." [p. 228]) echoes one of the standard defenses of postmodern art, framing each corrupt gesture and investment in vanity as intentional - a "parody" - and so immune to critique. 38. Negroponte, Soft Architecture Machines, p. 5. 39. This warning that "artificial life," with a will all its own, might eventually revolt against its human creators, is hardly new. The caution was being voiced in the very cradle of technoptimism. The year was 1818, the author was Mary Shelley, and the lab - awaiting funding from major corporations - was Dr. Frankenstein's. The first thing his intelligent machine demanded, and with a vengeance, was the comfort of some company. The new Adam, like the old, was desperate for a date. 40. William Shakespeare, The Tempest, Act II, i. 41 . The symbolic turning point for Europe's conversion from a religious to a scientific world view is usually ascribed to the reign of Charles V of France ( 1 364-80) who recalibrated public life by switching from canonical hours to the mechanical clock. Smaller, privately owned clocks became more prevalent in the seventeenth century, and their adoption paralleled an increasing preference for precise and regular measurement in all fields, especially commerce. Newton's Principia Mathematica was published in 1687. 42. Brand, pp. 188,200. 43. Levy, p. 346. 44. Lawrence Durrell, Justine ( New York: Pocket Cardinal, 1961), p.250.</page></plain_text>
