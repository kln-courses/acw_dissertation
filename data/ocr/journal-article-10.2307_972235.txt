Glascock For the last two decades, archaeologists have believed that a ceramic type known as Indfgena Ware was an imitation of Euro- pean majolica, produced by colonial Nahuas in Mexico City for lower-class Spanish families. Ideas surrounding the produc- tion and consumption of Indfgena Ware, as well as majolica in general, have been based on the concepts of Spanish domination and indigenous acculturation. These ideas emphasize European interests in displaying high-value imports to obtain distinction along racial and class lines, and fail to consider indigenous strategies for obtaining power through craft production and dis- play. We begin by critically evaluating the stylistic, iconographic, and technical evidence archaeologists have used to suggest that Indfgena Ware was an indigenous product. We present the results from neutron activation analysis of 250 ceramic sherds indicating that Indfgena Ware forms its own compositional group, different from Aztec pottery and Spanish majolica, and sug- gest that Indigena Ware is most likely a Spanish import. The problems this ware presents for classification reveal the limita- tions of locating power exclusively in the hands of the Spanish and point to ways in which we could overcome this theoretical problem for the study of colonialism in Mexico. Luego de la conquista de Me'xico, los espanoles comenzaron a importar mayolica europea y fundaron fabricas de mayolica en Me'xico. A la vez, los indfgenas continuaron produciendo cera'mica de acuerdo a las tradiciones alfareras precolombinas. Durante las u'ltimas dos de'cadas los arqueologos han crefdo que un tipo de ceramica colonial conocido como "IndEgena Ware" ("Loza Indfgena") es una imitacion de la mayolica europea, producida por indfgenas durante el siglo diecise'is en la Ciudad de Me'xico y usada por familias espanolas de clase baja. La Indfgena Ware es muy parecida a la mayo'lica en te'rminos de forma, acabado de superficie, color y tecnica de vidriado. Sin embargo, gran parte de las ideas sobre la produccion alfarera en el Mexico colonial, incluyendo la produccion de Indigena Ware y la mayolica, asf como el consumo de e'stas, tienen como base los conceptos de do- minacion espanola y aculturacion indfgena. Estos conceptos enfatizan los intereses de los colonizadores Europeos, incluyendo sus estrategias clasistas y racistas de obtener distincion mediante el consumo de material cultural europeo (en este caso la mayolica), e igno ran por completo las estrategias indfgenas pa ra obtener poder social mediante te'cnicas similares de consumo de material cultural. En este artEculo presentamos evidencia que indica que es muy probable que la Indigena Ware sea una loza de importacion espanola, incluyendo los aspectos morfologicos de las vasijas, y evidencia de manufactura y de los motivos decorativos. A la vez presentamos evidencia sobre la composicion quEmica de 250 fragmentos de mayolica, ceramica azteca colonial, e Indfgena Ware obtenida mediante analisis de activacion neutro'nica. El analisis indica que la Indfgena Ware forma su propio grupo de composi- cion quEmica distinto a todos los grupos quEmicos conocidos en Mesoame'rica hasta hoy, y de la mayolica importada de Espana. Mediante el analisis tipologico y qufmico de la Indfgena Ware sugerimos que e'sta es una ceramica de importacion europea. Al tomar en cuenta un tipo de organizacion de produccion e importacion de ceramica distinto a los patrones conocidos mediante los documentos historicos, invitamos a refleccionar sobre las limitaciones de los conceptos basados en la dominacion espanola y la resistencia y aculturacion indfgena y a formular maneras de sobreponer dicho concepto en el analisis historico y arqueologico del Me'xico colonial.

Its forms include compound silhouette plates, hemispherical bowls with annular bases, porringers with leaf- shaped handles, and pitchers (Figure 1). According to the Listers (1982:37), IndigenaWare was "an inex- pensive service ware that withstood hard usage bet- ter than the lesser quality common maiolicas" among Spanish colonizers. The Listers argued that Indigena Ware was an indigenous imitation of majolica using three lines of evidence (see Lister and Lister 1982:3440). First, they believed that Indigena Ware was formed with techniques traditionally used by native potters. Like Aztec-tradition ceramics, Indigena Ware was appar- ently handmade instead of wheel-thrown. European majolica was typically wheel-thrown. The glaze of Indlgena Ware includes lead, but not tin. The Listers suggested that while native potters could produce lead glazes, they could not attain the higher temper- atures needed to flux tin glazes. Second, the Listers argued that the forms of Indlgena Ware were an imi- tation of the more graceful, better-executed com- pound ceramic forms made by European potters, but limited by indigenous techniques. Third, the Listers suggested that the decorative motifs of the llomita Sgrafitto variant of Indlgena Ware were Aztec-tra- dition motifs. Finally, they argued that the red paste of Indlgena Ware was similar to the paste of Aztec ceramics and that future geochemical studies would confirm that they were indeed from the Basin of Mexico. We begin this paper by placing Indfgena Ware in a wider context of ffie debates surrounding power and material culture in the Spanish colonies in the Amer- icas. By comparing the interpretation of Indfgena Ware set forth by the Listers and the issues currently debated elsewhere in Spanish colonial archaeology (such as issues surrounding Colono Ware, a broad term for the pottery of New World colonies that was produced with techniques characteristic of non-Euro- pean ceramic traditions), we argue that a narrow def- inition of power in the colonial period has limited archaeological approaches to colonial Mexico gen- erally, and the study of Indfgena Ware specifically. We use several lines of evidence to question the idea that native potters produced Indfgena Ware, Erst, by arguing that the evidence used by the Listers is weak. We analyzed a sample of Indigena Ware by neutron activation analysis (INAA), concluding that Indfgena Ware does not belong chemically to any clay compositional group in Mesoamerica. Indfgena Ware forms its own chemical group. Based on INAA evidence, we argue that the possibility is stong ffiat Indfgena Ware was a Spanish import or produced by Spanish potters in Mexico, alffiough positively iden- tifying a production site will require further research. Inspired by historical studies and recent theoret- ical developments ffiat view the organization of pro- duction as involved in political and economic strategies (see papers in Costin and Wright 1998), we reexamine issues of production and use of Indf- genaWare. Historical studies have demonstrated ffiat indigenous agency was an important factor in colo- nial economy, politics, and social change (e.g., Cline</page><page sequence="3">REPORTS 69 1986; Farriss 1984; Gibson 1964; Haskett 1991; Kel- logg 1995; Lockhart 1992, 1999). In several instances, historical documents mention that indige- nous people began to produce and trade in European- style items (Carrillo 1989; Gibson 1964; Hassig 1985; Lockhart 1992; Sahagun 1997). Our finding that Indlgena Ware was doubtfully made by indige- nous potters underscores the variety of postconquest responses by craft producers, which were not lim- ited to simply trading in European goods. We finish this paper by suggesting the possibility that Indigena Ware was used by colonial Indians as part of their own strategies of display and search for power. Colono Ware, Indigena Ware, and Power: A Wider Context for the P&gt;blem at Hand Definitions of Colono Ware and its geographical dis- tribution are currently a matter of controversy. In general terms, Colono Ware encompasses pottery produced locally in the European colonies of the New World, with techniques, forms, raw materials, and decoration characteristic of Native American or African pottery traditions. Colono Ware has been found in many areas of the Spanish empire in Amer- ica, especially in the Caribbean and the Norffiern and Eastern Borderlands. Archaeologists argue that makers of Colono Ware sometimes attempted to reproduce European forms, but through the use of non-European manufacturing techniques. For the most part, Colono Wares were made into cooking and storage vessels, ritual paraphernalia, and pipes. Serv- ing vessels also sometimes fit into the broad cate- gory of Colono Ware (Deagan 1987, 1988; Dominguez 1995, 1998; Emerson 1994; Ferguson 1978; Garcla-Arevalo 1990; Howson 1990; Orser 1996; Smith 1995). Although Indigena Ware is different stylistically from most pottery included under the rather diverse category of Colono Ware, debates surrounding Colono Ware are relevant to its study. Both wares have been understood as indigenous products in imitation (to a certain extent) of European imports. Recent debates surrounding Colono Ware have focused on issues of power and politics. Although a large part of the debates surrounding Colono Ware has been lim- ited to culture history, or to whether we can attribute Colono Ware (or wares) to any specific ethnic group, archaeologists also have attempted to lay out a research plan that goes beyond using objects as mark- ers of ethnicity, taking advantage of the opportunity offered by such objects to research political and eco- nomic relationships in colonial situations. Theoretical critiques of the study of Colono Ware as markers of effinicity (e.g., Howson 1990) are strik- ingly similar to critiques of traditional "accultura- tion" studies. These critiques see traditional views of acculturation as passive models of dynamic processes. Such models leave issues of power and strategic re-evaluations of social relations and cul- tureunexamined(e.g., delRio 1991; Droogers 1989; Shaw and Stewart 1994; van der Veer 1994). Tradi- tional views of acculturation also rest upon a limited definition of culture, which "emphasizes complexes of traits rather than peoples' ongoing interpretation, evaluation, and creative response, the strategies and symbolic revaluing that form the basis of cultural process" (Howson 1990:81). Acculturation studies often view material changes as an outcome, result, or product of culture contact (i.e., as "evidence" of acculturation or of cultural change) rather than view- ing material changes as embedded in social contexts that made material culture meaningful and in which different people utilized material culture in behav- iors and practices involved in strategies for obtain- ing power. The debates on Colono Ware have involved concepts of acculturation, cultural conti- nuity, political strategies, resistance, and separatism in exploring how it was involved in the political and social struggles of the Spanish colonies in theAmer- icas (see Howson 1990; Paynter 2000). The study of Indigena Ware in Mexico, however, did not follow acourse like the one subsequendy taken by studies of Colono Ware. Indigena Ware did not, until recently, stimulate any research on indigenous craft production and its reiation to the political econ- omy of colonial Mexico, even though this type of pot- tery may have figtund in colonial economics, strategies of display, and politics beyond Spanish domination and the resulting indigenous "acculturation." If Indi- genaWare was, as the Listers suggested, a native prod- uct, it offers the potential to take into account patterns of indigenous agency in colonial economics and pol- itics, and to study Nahua participation in the changes in strategies of display in sixteenth-century Mexico, patterns not available for study through historical doc- uments but relatively accessible to archaeologists. The integration of Indigena Ware into studies of colonial- ism in Mexico, however, has not yet occurred beyond its brief mention in a few archaeological cases (e.g., Fournier 1998).</page><page sequence="4">70 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY lVol. 14$ No. 1$ 2003] Figure 2. Majolica sherds from the Metropolitan Cathedral, Mexico City. The Listers suggested that this ware was produced by native potters and consumed by lower-class Span- ish families who could not afford European imports (Lister and Lister 1982, 1987), conforming to a widely held assumption about colonial society: that Spanish immigrants attempted, by any means, to reproduce an acceptably European lifestyle and sought distinction from Indians through the use of material culture similar to that used in Europe (in this case Indigena Ware) (e.g., Farriss 1984; Gibson 1964; Lister and Lister 1982). We suggest this per- spective leaves the implications of indigenous pro- duction of this ware unexplored, including its consequences for the organization of colonial craft production and distribution. We present alternative possibilities in an attempt to expand our interpreta- tion of this ware specifically, and colonial material in general, and to raise questions that will enhance our understanding of colonial craft production, con- sumption, and power beyond the effects of Spanish domination. European Majolica and Indigena Ware Immediately after conquering the Aztec capital of Mexico, Tenochtitlan, in 1521, Spanish colonizers began importing European andAsian goods, includ- ing clothingS furniture, and pottery. Some scholars argue that Spanish settlers sought distinction through the use and display of foreign imports (Farriss 1984; Gibson 1964; Kuwayama 1997; Lister and Lister 1982), although recent research suggests that they also incorporated indigenous crafts, especially ceramics, into their daily lives (Charlton et al.1995; Fournier 1997; Rodriguez-Alegria2001,2002,2003; Rodriguez-Alegria et al.2000). Among the kinds of ceramics imported by the Spanish is pottery known today as majolica, "an earthenware covered with lead glaze opacified and whitened by the addition of a small percentage of tin oxide" (Lister and Lister 1982:vii). Majolica has a white, glossy aspect and can be found as undecorated types and as types richly decorated in blue, yellow, orange, green, and metal- lic colors. Majolica forms include simple and com- pound-silhouette plates with annular bases, porringers with leaf-shaped handles, jars, hemi- spherical bowls, and drug jars (Figure 2) (e.g., Dea- gan 1987; Goggin 1968; Lister and Lister 1982). Europeans imported majolica mostly from Spain and Italy, and set up their own majolica workshops in Mexico City very early in the colonial period. All of the majolica wares analyzed by Lister and Lister (1982) have been dated to the period before 1543, only 22 years after the conquest of Mexico. Spanish pottery guilds in Mexico did not allow Indian labor- ers in their workshops as potters, painters, or appren- tices (Lister and Lister 1982,1987), although Indians are mentioned as acting as helpers, perhaps to carry water and raw materials, on rare occasions (Sodi Miranda 1994). Aztec-tradition pottery manufacture continued in Mexico during the colonial period, when Red Ware, Black-on-OrangeS and other types of ceramics were made (Charlton 1968; Fournier 1997). Another ware presumably produced during the colonial period by</page><page sequence="5">REPORTS 71 Figure 3. Romita Sgraffito sherds with the flower motif. indigenous people is known today as IndigenaWarew defined by Florence and Robert Lister as an imita- tion of the forms and surface finish of majolica (1982:34). It is a coarse earthenware covered by a white slip and a lead glaze, and is considered a "mezza-majolica" since its glaze is not rendered opaque by the addition of tin oxide. The Listers con- sider the white slip beneath the lead glaze in Ind1- gena Ware to be an attempt at imitating the color and surface finish of true majolica Indlgena Ware was made mostly into compound silhouette plates, bowls, porringers with leaf-shaped handlesS and small jars. The forms are very similar to those of European majolica at the time, although Indigena Ware ves- sels lack some of the delicate curves and f1nishing on the vessels walls and the annular bases charac- teristic of fine majolica. Lister and Lister split Indigena Ware into two types: the undecorated Romita Plain, and the sgrafitto or carved-design Romita Sgrafitto (Figure 1, 3, 4). Indigena Ware has been found in large quantities in Mexico City, especially in the sixteenth-century trash dump beneath the Metropolitan Cathedral, where the Listers counted a total of 1,665 sherds (Lister and Lister 1982:10) making Indigena Ware more fre- quent in this context than all other imported Span- ish and Italian majolica types. Archaeologists have also identified Indigena Ware in other colonial sites in Patzcuaro, Michoacan, Chihuahua, and Albu- quertue (Lister and Listr 1976 1982), althev}gh ln lower frequencies than in Mexico City. Initially, the Listers (1976:34) believed that Indl- gena Ware was an Italian importS tentatively assign- ing its center of manufacture to Pisa based on stylistic similarities with Italian ceramics and the use of colorful decoration in Romita Sgrafitto. By the time of the publication of their major volume on Spanish and Mexican majolicaS however, the Lis- ters had decided that their initial belief was erro- neousS and assigned Ind1genaWare to Indian potters in the Basin of Mexico. Indigena Ware: Indigenous Ware? When assigning the manufacture of Indlgena Ware to colonial Indians, the Listers presented a prelimi- nary argument based on three lines of evidence: man- ufacturing techniques, vessel morphology, and decorative motifs. lwhe Listers argued that the form- ing techniques of Indlgena Ware were different from those of European majolica. Indlgena Ware was made by hand, perhaps with molds or coils (Lister and Lister 1982:34, 96). The use of the throwing wheel was characteristic of European majolica at the time. As mentioned above, the glaze of Indlgena Ware is made of lead, unlike that of European majolica, which contains both lead and tin. This implies, according to the Listers, a native technol- ogy used in manufacturing these pots instead of the O 1 2 3 4 5 W,i _S ___ .AR.z.t ......... _v, ........ .. 2.S-.M</page><page sequence="6">72 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Nol. 14, No. 1, 2Z3l Figure 4. Romita Sgrafitto sherds with the chain motif. technology used in Europe (Lister and Lister 1982:34). Lead fluxes at relatively low temperatures easily reached in an open firing. Therefore, it was possible for Nahuas to attain those temperatures with traditional firing technology. Reaching the flux tem- perature for tin, which is much higher than that of lead, requires the use of a kiln (Lister and Lister 1982:81-83). Furthermore, European majolica usu- ally has scars left by cockspurs or headpins used to separate plates or bowls from each other during kiln firing to prevent the glaze on adjacent pots from fus- ing them together. Cockspur and headpin scars are absent from Indlgena Ware (Lister and Lister 1982:34). The forms of Indigena Ware also seemed to be in imitation of European majolica, but lack some of the details that set apart the true European imports from native imitations. IndlgenaWare forms include com- mon European forms, such as compound silhouette plates, hemispherical bowls and porringers with lobed lugs. Attributes present in European majolica but not in Indlgena Ware are annular bases and the delicate undulations beneath compound silhouette plate rims. In arguing that the fotms are a hybrid of native and European foims, the Listers seem to imply that native potters were imitating the forms of Euro- pean majolica, but with less command over the form- ing of each pot. The Listers further argued that the decorative motifs of Indlgena Ware are of Aztec tradition. The motifs include variations of a so-called corn motifS chains, and flowers on plate cavettos, large flowers on the center of vessel bottoms, and rare depictions of quadrupeds, birds, and human figures (Lister and Lister 1982:39, 97). These motifs are similar to those found on late Aztec wttery (see below), and differ- ent from those on European majolica. On the other hand, the decorative structure of Indlgena Ware and European majolica is very similar, with motifs on vessel bottoms and around the rim, and decorative areas often structured by concentric lines (Lister and Lister 1982; Vega Sosa 1984). Finally, the Listers suggested that their asszia- tion would be supported by a study they were con- ducting of the chemical composition of the pastes of the ceramic samples. The chemical evidence, pub- lished two years after the Listers' Sixteenth Century Maiolica Pottery in the Valley of Mexico (1982), came from an analysis performed by Maggetti and colleagues on a total sample of 81 majolica sherds of different types from the Metropolitan Cathedral and Metro excavations that included only five Romita Sgrafitto sherds (Maggetti et al. 1984). The tech- niques utilized included instrumental neutron acti- vation analysis (INAA) and direct current plasma-optical emission spectroscopy. Based on the</page><page sequence="7">REPORTS 73 concentration of different oxides present in the Romita Sgrafitto sherds, they concluded the chemi- cal composition matched ffiat of offier Aztec ceram- ics, and not of European imports. The evidence presented by Maggetti and colleagues (1984) con- firmed the Listers' earlier proposal. Until recently, no other chemical composition studies had been con- ducted on large samples of Indigena Ware. Indigena Ware: European Import? We suggest that the four lines of evidence used by the Listers are not sufficient to conclusively prove that Indigena Ware is a colonial indigenous devel- opment. There are stylistic, technical, and morpho- logical similarities between it and European pottery of Muslim tradition that the Listers did not examine, casting doubt on Indigena Ware's native designa- tion. In fact, the evidence from ceramic technology, vessel morphology, and decorative motifs supports a European background to this pottery. The carved design, white slipping, and lead glaz- ing techniques used to produce Romita Sgrafitto had been in use in the Near East and Europe at least since the ninth century. From the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries, sgrafitto pottery was present all over Europe, and it is typologically and technically indis- tinguishable across different geographic areas in Europe using modern typologies (Kuleff and Djin- gova 2001). On visual inspection, European sgrafitto potteiy is remarkably similar to Romita Sgrafitto. We have not studied the forming techniques used in Indi- gena Ware production, but will engage in a future study to determine whether it was wheel-*rown or formed by hand. Regardless, the techniques utilized to glaze and decorate these ceramics were not indige- nous imitations of majolica, but techniques without Mesoamerican antecedents that were used by Euro- pean potters. The forms of Romita Sgrafitto are, as the Listers noted, more limited than those of European majolica, especially given the absence of annular bases, but they are not simply native imitations of better-exe- cuted European forms. Flat-bottomed compound sil- houette plates and flat-bottomed hemispherical bowls were known in Spain since the tenth centllry, as illustrated in a collection from the site of Madi- nat al-Zahra inAndalusia (Cano Piedra 1996). These forms were typical of Hispano-Moresque pottery (Sanchez Pacheco 1997). Although we cannot find these forms among majolica imported from Europe, most likely the forms of Indigena Ware follow an Andalusian tradition, and were not merely the result of Indian imitations of Spanish imports. The decorative motifs of Indigena Ware present a complicated analytical problem. Some motifs were present both on precolumbian ceramics (although they are not the typical Aztec Black-on-Orange ceramic motifs; see Hodge 1992) and on Moresque potteiy from Spain. We counted the motifs on Romita Sgrafitto sherds from the Sagrario Metropolitano in Mexico City, selecting only those that were large enough for us to unequivocally identify the motif, for a total of 155 sherds included in this analysis. The most frequent motifs were flowers, of which 20 were located on plate rims and 19 were located on plate bottoms (Figure 3). Thirty-three sherds have por- tions of motifs that are most likely flowers, bringing the total of flower motifs on Romita Sgrafitto pot- tery to 82. Flower motifs are present in Aztec pot- tery, especially Red Ware and Black-on-Orange ceramics. Flowers on the bottom of plates were typ- ical in early Aztec Black-on-Orange ceramics (Sejourne 1970:Figure 51; Vega Sosa 1975), can be found on rims and bottoms of late Aztec Black-on- Orange ceramics (Vega Sosa 1984:137-140), and are also found on Spanish ceramics that predate the sixteenth century (e.g., Puertas Tricas 1989). The treatment of flower stems and petals on Romita Sgrafitto rims, however, is reminiscent of Spanish pottery designs of Muslim tradition (e.g., Alvaro Zamora 1997; Martinez Caviro 1997; Montagut 1996; Puertas Tricas 1989). Twenty-six sherds contain what Lister and Lister called the "chain" motif, consisting of intertwined bands (Figure 4). This motif is found in Aztec pot- tery (e.g., Hodge's [1992:439] Black-on-Orange "rope" motif, or Vega Sosa's [1984] "bandas ondu- ladas entrelazadas" motif). The chain motif is also found in Spanish pottery before the sixteenth cen- tury, and occurred in an almost identical form in Aztec pottery (e.g., Hodge 1992; Montagut 1996; Puertas Tricas 1989; Vega Sosa 1975). Identifying whether the flower or chain motifs are of Spanish origin, Aztec tradition, or both, is difficult, if not impossible, with the material at hand. The motifs from both traditions resemble each other too closely. Another common motif is what the Listers called the "corn" motif (Lister and Lister 1982), occurring 28 times in our sample of Romita Sgrafitto sherds (Figure 5). Corn was an American crop discovered</page><page sequence="8">74 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 14, No. 1, 2003] Figure 5. Romita Sgraffito sherds with the so-called corn motif. by Europeans only after their arrival in the New World. As a staple of Mesoamerican diets, it held great significance for indigenous people. The Aztecs had a corn goddess, offered corn to the gods in rit- ual, held feasts and ceremonies for the planting and harvesting of corn, and performed rituals to ensure a good harvest of corn every year. Corn, in fact, was involved in all aspects of Aztec myth, religion, pol- itics, diet, and economy (Coe 1994). However, a corn motif such as the one found in Itomita Sgrafitto does not typically occur in pre- columbian Aztec pottery. Corn motifs are usually found in codex paintings, sculpture and architecture, and most likely in precolumbian costumes. During the colonial period, the Spanish destroyed Aztec sculptures, considering them symbols of paganism and an obstacle to religious conversion. Spanish col- onizers and mendicant friars apparently ignored ceramics and the seemingly harmless geometric designs that characterized Late Aztec pottery. Pasz- tory (1984) suggests that they thought of ceramics as too mundane to be an important medium for reli- gious expression. During the early colonial period, then, Nahua potters transferred some important icons to pottery for the first time, creating new forms of ceramic art that preserved some of the religious and social values of theAztec even after the Spanish con- quest. New forms and icons helped artistic ceramic production flourish in the early colonial period (Pasz- tory 1983:298-300, 1984). It is possible that some Nahua potters also transferred the corn motif to pot- tery to escape Spanish censorship or as an outcome of a more general trend of transferring decorative icons and motifs from sculpture to ceramics. There also are corn-like motifs in Spanish pot- tery predating the sixteenth century that look remark- ably similar to the "corn" motif in Romita Sgrafitto. These corn-like motifs are quite frequent in Muslim pottery (e.g., Martinez Caviro 1997; Montagut 1996). The European version of the "corn" motif has at least two different interpretations: the tree of life sacred in Muslim tradition, or an acorn (Martinez Caviro 1997). Whether the motifs present in Romita Sgrafitto are, as the Listers argue, corn motifs or whether they are the Muslim tree of life or acorn motifs is very difficult to establish. We would like to emphasize the ambiguity of these motifs. Whether the potter or decorator meant to represent com or an acorn, the motif could have had different interpreta- tions, depending on the point of view of whoever used or saw the pottery. Interpreting the meaning of colonial imagery, and its reinterpretations during that period, is probably as complicated today as it was for people living in sixteenth-century Mexico, because both colonizers and indigenous people employed their own cultural categories in interpret- ing motifs that were similar, whether originating in European or Mexican ceramic traditions (e.g, Burkhart 1988, 1992). The naturalistic motifs in ltomita Sgrafitto are dif-</page><page sequence="9">REPORTS 75 ficult to interpret as well. These include eight birds, two anthropomorphic images, and one mammal (probably a feline). The designs are rendered in two- dimensional fashion, common to both European pot- tery decoration at the time and Aztec pottery decoration and manuscript painting. Among the most interesting images are a probable turkey (an animal of New World origins) and a human figure in full armor. Although these two images could have been drawn from daily life in Mexico, they do not consti- tute sufficient evidence to propose a Mexican source for Romita Sgrafitto. Decorative motifs are simply too ambiguous as evidence of production to argue . . that Indigena Ware was necessarily an indigenous product, and their interpretation must have been as difficult and varied in the sixteenth century as it is today. Other motifs include a geometric form tenta- tively called the "cloud" motif, which occurs eight times in this sample. We do not know at this point if the motif is of Aztec or Spanish tradition, hadprece- dents in both, or was a colonial innovation. Indigena Ware: A New Chemical Composition Group The strongest line of evidence that Indigena Ware was not a native product comes from neutron acti- vation analysis (INAA). According to our analysis, the chemical composition of Indigena Ware does not match that of any other samples from Mexico. We studied the chemical composition of Indigena Ware and other Spanish majolica using INAA at the Mis- souri University Research Reactor (MURR), taking into account 31 elements. 1 The sample included 94 Indigena Ware sherds, all excavated at the Metro- politarl Cathedral and the Sagrario Metropolitano in Mexico City by the Programa de Arqueologia Urbana, Museo del Templo Mayor. Our sample also contained 138Aztec RedWare samples and 18 sam- ples of majolica of Spanish manufacture in Mexico City,2 which were in turn compared with over 4,000 pottery and clay samples that have been analyzed from all over the Basin of Mexico and Mesoamer- ica at MURR. All sherds were assigned a MURR ana- lytical identification code (anid), MTM021- MTM270, and MTM287-MTM320. Our study did not find a chemical match between Indigena Ware sherds and any compositional group from Mexico studied to date at MURR. We compared all of the Mexican samples with the Indigena Ware group using a Mahalanobis distance calculation. Results indicated that there is less than .001 proba- bility of membership in the Indigena Ware group for any Mesoamerican clay or pottery sample. We also compared each individual Indigena Ware sample with all other compositional groups. Once again, we obtained less than .001 probability of membership in any Mesoamerican pottery compositional group from all Indigena Ware samples. The fact that Indigena Ware forms a new, distinct chemical composition group in Mexico is remark- able, especially since over 4,000 ceramic sherds and clay samples from all over Mesoamerica have been analyzed at MURR. The analyzed ceramics include types such as Aztec Black-on-Orange, Red Ware, plain wares, plumbate, ceramics from Tula, the Teoti- huacan Valley, the entire Basin of Mexico, and Otumba. Chemical characterization of these ceram- ics has resulted in numerous studies and publications (e.g., Brumfiel and Hodge 1996; Charlton et al. l999, 2000; Hodge et al. 1992, 1993; Minc 1994; Minc et al. 1994; Neff 2000; Neff et al.1988,2000; Nichols et al.2002). INAA studies of colonial period pottery, such as that produced in factories in Puebla, and of European majolica are fewer than those of pre- columbian ceramics (e.g., Rodriguez-Alegria 2002). We plan to increase the colonial pottery sample in the near future and compare the Indigena Ware com- positional group to even more possible source groups. A plot for principal components 1 and 2 with 90 percent confidence ellipses visually summarizes the difference between Indigena Ware, Aztec Red Ware, and two Mexico City majolica types (Tlalpan White and Mexico City Var. I) from colonial period Tenochtitlan analyzed in our study (Figure 6). In this plot, none ofthe IndigenaWare samples overlap with Red Ware or majolica samples. Although there is overlap between Aztec Red Ware and Mexican majolica types, Indigena Ware forms its own, dis- tinct cluster, separate not only from Red Ware but also from Spanish majolica. The overlap in princi- pal components space between Red Ware and Tlal- pan White might indicate that some Mexican majolica types were made with locally procured clays, although their composition might vary accord- ing to the different recipes utilized to produce majolica, which required mixing different types of clays (see Lister and Lister 1982). Bivariate element plots explain some of the com- positional differences summarized in the principal</page><page sequence="10">76 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Nol. 14, No. 1, 2w3l o o o o ol o o ol o o o I cs Q 8 CU Q ._ . _ for Indigena Ware o o * Red Ware * IndigenaWare * Mexico City White Var.

The Indigena Ware compositional group has a higher content of Co, Cr, Fe, and Yb and a lower content of Rb, Na, and Ca than Aztec Red Ware from Tenochtitlan and Mexi- can majolica. The chemical composition of Indigena Ware, contrary to what was suggested in previous studies (ListerandLister 1982; Maggetti et al. 1984), provides no evidence to support the idea that it was made by indigenous people, nor does it provide evi- dence that it was made in Spanish majolica factories in Mexico. Comparisons between Romita Sgrafitto and Romita Plain show no chemical difference between the two Indigena Ware types. A plot for principal components 1 and 2 with 90 percent confidence ellipses shows almost complete overlap between the two types (Figure 9). Indigena Ware consistently formed a cluster in all plots done as part of this analy- sis. Thus, there is no compositional evidence to sug- gest that Romita Plain and Romita Sgrafitto were made by different producers or in different locations. These two types combine to form a single composi- tional group that differs from other chemical com- position groups studied in Mesoamerica to date. Although the evidence we have presented is neg- ative, it casts strong doubt on the idea that Indigena Ware was an indigenous imitation of majolica by showing that there are no chemical composition matches with Mesoamerican pottery. The presence of Muslim pottery with the typical forms of Indigena Ware and the use of sgrafitto techniques in Europe further strengthen the case for a European origin. The similarities between European sgrafitto pottery and Romita Sgrafitto support this idea as well. Other pos- sibilities include that Indlgena Ware was made in Mexico by Spanish potters who did not work in Span- ish workshops in Mexico City and who may have employed indigenous labor to manufacture their pot- tery. We are currently working to analyze a sample of pottery imported from Spain as well as other pot- tery samples from Mexico to continue searching for the source of Indigena Ware and examine the possi- bility that it is, as the Listers initially suggested (Lis- ter and Lister 1976), a European import. Indigena Ware and Strategies of Production The issue of who produced Indigena Ware is impor- tant, because its resolution has implications for colo- nial history and archaeology in Mexico.

Spanish col- onizers were incensed by indigenous craft produc- ers, whom they accused of trying to steal their share of the market on imports (Rodriguez-Alegria 2002: 12s123). However, indigenous potters in the early postconquest period do not seem to have begun producing an entirely new kind of tableware to tar- get the Spanish market, underscoring the variety of responses among Indian producers. Our study of Indigena Ware raises the possibility of a different organization of production among the Spanish than we have believed so far. Until very recently, most archaeological work on pottery pro- duction among Spanish colonizers in Mexico has been influenced by historical documents about the organization of potters' guilds and workshops. Not surprisingly, this perspective emphasizes Spanish domination: membership in guilds was strictly Span- ish, no Nahuas participated as potters, and guild pro- tectionism left no room for outside pottery production even by other Spaniards (e.g., Lister and Lister 1982,1987; SodiMiranda 1994). The factthat the composition of Indigena Ware does not match the chemical composition of other Spanish types and is not mentioned in historical documents regarding pottery workshops could reflect more competitive Spanish craft production than the histoncal record implies. Competing factions among Spanish potters, including some outside guilds, could have frag- mented their unity as part of the dominant colonial class. Ourview of IndigenaWare production represents a break from contemporary archaeological ideas of Spanish domination through monopolization of mar- kets and a strict organization of craft production through guild ordinances. If Spanish (or other Euro- pean) potters produced IndigenaWare and employed indigenous labor in their workshops, it would have represented a locus for Spanish-Indian interaction and the transfer of technological knowledge, with consequences for class stratification and social elab- oration in the colonial period. Indigena Ware and Strategies of Display: The Importance of Ambiguity The cultural ambiguity of the decorative motifs of Indigena Ware invites us to study how Spaniards and Indians challenged the categories of race and caste</page><page sequence="13">REPORTS 79 that were part of the colonial enterprise as part of their strategies of social mobility. It is possible that colonial Nahoas consumed Indigena Ware, instead of, or in addition to, Spanish colonizers. Whether of the elite classes or commoners, Indians could have displayed a cultural affiliation with the Aztec and other great civilizations by using ceramics with motifs that seemed traditional, such as the "corn," flower, and chain motifs. At the same time, the glossy finish, white slip, and forms of these ceramics gave the pots a Eutopean aspect. Claiming ambiguous alliances with both Indians and Europeans would have been a particularly effective strategy for any native group seeking social advancement. It is difficult at this point to state how Indigena Ware was used in strategies of consumption and dis- play. Without the proper archaeological contexts we simply do not know whether it was used by indige- nous elites or commoners as well, whether Indians used it at all, or whether the distribution these ceram- ics would suggest regional differences instead of class differences. Our intention has been to point toward these possibilities as viable alternatives to interpretations that only consider Spanish interests in display. The alternatives should be tested archae- ologically in the appropriate contexts. Conclusion Much as research on Colono Ware in the Spanish Borderlands has produced a critique of traditional acculturation studies, archaeological approaches to the colonial period in Mexico must examine power beyond Spanish domination and the resulting, often unexplained, acculturation of indigenous people. This approach has not been able to account fully for patterns of indigenous agency, collaboration, and complicity. The problem is not one of evidence but of how power has been conceptualized in very lim- ited ways as a result of Spanish imposition of colo- nial rule and control of labor. In turn, archaeologists have limited their interpretation of archaeological evidence to confirm these long-held beliefs. The case of Indigena Ware is an example of the limitations imposed by this approach. IndigenaWare was viewed as an indigenous product, but there has been a lack of interest in the possibility that indige- nous potters changed their production to produce for a new colonial market and to create links to Spanish families. Rather than an indigenous product, we argue here it is most likely a European import. We must explore the possibility of indigenous and Span- ish craft production and innovation in a frarnework of agency and strategies for obtaining power. In addi- tion to a Spanish middle class consuming European- style products as part of their strategies of social mobility, we must also consider indigenous adop- tions of European goods for display and for obtain- ing social power. Unless we investigate these alternatives as well as the possibility of competing factions among the Spanish, our concept of power in colonial Mexico will continue to limit our inter- pretations of archaeological matenals and contnbu- tions to history and social theory.
