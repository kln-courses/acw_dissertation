<plain_text><page sequence="1">DANIEL L1BESKIND: CHAMBER WORKS 6-29 October 1983 In front of lines that leave nothing behind The frontal subject The trouble with most criticism, and particularly that brand of interpretive criticism associated with iconology, is that meaning is assumed to exist behind, beneath or within the subjects of criticism. The task of the critic is to delve into, uncover, disclose, reveal, divulge, discover, unfold and show to the reader what lies hidden or unseen, to get to the bottom of things, to plumb the depths, to see beneath the surface, behind the curtain. Behind and beneath are metaphors, since there is no real space surround? ing events or objects that is made visible by criti? cism; but if we allow ourselves to be drawn into the trope, then we might well ask what lies beside, above and in front of the subjects of criticism too. What is it that excludes these other positions from notice? The spatial metaphor places the critic as well as the things he regards. Whatever he talks about, he faces, and by a trick of anthropomor phization the subject faces him. Or at least this is frequently imagined to be the relation. The metaphor of looking would alone be enough to ensure the positioning of the subject in front of the critic (and if we do not look into subjects, we approach them ? no less frontal an attitude). Yet it is the face-to-face relationship between the critic and his subject that has the greatest effect because with it comes the idea that the pheno? mena which are presented to us through our senses are presented as frontages, facades, things that signify what they stand in front of. So it is that the critic may look at his subject as if it were some kind of projection whose meaning is assured by the fact that it is addressed toward him. All the world can still be a stage, and it is then our business to find out what supports the illusion or what gives rise to the representation. Aspects of reality that cannot be thought of in terms of this privileged orientation become more recalcitrant to interpretation because no clue is given as to where we should stand or what we should look toward. As it is, the spatial meta? phor leaves us in no doubt; it leads under the skin, beneath the surface, through the frame, behind the stage, beyond the facade. Often the spatial metaphor is itself already a metaphor of time, but in this instance space and time are interchangeable. Beneath and behind translate easily into a chronological before. Time passes; we look back. Sediments accumu? late; we dig. The face-to-face relationship, no longer possible across time, is replaced by an equivalent arrangement in which the present is construed as a projection of the past, an acces? sible reality offering evidence of previous events than can only be recovered through it. Extend? ing from the past it eclipses, the present is turned into the facade of history. The line of sight engendered by the spatial metaphors of hidden meaning, whether single or doubled, whether expressed in space or spatial ized time, sets the critic in search of origins, essences, intentions, motives, causes, for these are the things that lie behind appearances. He looks therefore to find some animating or auth enticating agency that will account for whatever he confronts. The critic's task is always to con? front. The pressure of these harmless metaphors which bear on language at so many points will ease him into position face-to-face with reality, but will also leave him in no doubt that it is his duty not to take things at face value. Complaint may be made about the covert anthropomorphism imported by metaphors into the critical vocabulary and the frontalizing of the subject as general issues but, in the particular case of architectural criticism or art criticism, there would seem rather less to cavil at, since the face-to-face relationship is given far greater plausibility by the presence of architects and artists who present their work, often with con? siderable care as to how it will be shown and how seen. Would we not be perfectly justified in taking the face-to-face relationship for granted when such is the situation? Can we not, after all, rely on the architect's or artist's intention to orient the work towards us? It would seem so, but Daniel Libeskind's recent drawings may sug? gest otherwise. Lines without bodies Not that Chamber Works, twenty-eight draw? ings exhibited in October 1983 at the AA, were anything but frontal in their mode of presenta? tion. Nothing oblique or unpremeditated here. A conventionally hung, neatly mounted, uni? form series of abstract line compositions in black ink on white paper. At sufficient distance the overall effect is one of staid politeness. It is only when the observer steps within close range of any one of the drawings, close enough for the regulating propriety of the rectangular frame to be diminished, that he becomes aware of the de? monic energy of line within. It is energy hard to describe, for the lines themselves are expressive of neither velocity, force nor animation. A drawn line will normally render something vis? ible of the action that gave rise to it, which allows us to attribute human qualities ? febrile, agitated, delicate, rapid or hesitant ? to mere lines. Because these are architectural drawings, made with architectural instruments, because the lines are constructed, not thrown, it is impossible to do this. An approach that would lead through the drawing back to the event of its being made is denied us. Similar denials occur again and again within the series. Whenever an attempt is made to pass through and beyond the drawings, it proves abortive. They are opaque to this line of critical enquiry. Tigers, though performing the most elaborate excursions when stalking their quarry in the jungle, will, when presented with a slab of meat in front of their cage, pounce, apparently oblivious to the iron bars that lie between. Theirs is a failure of reflex, not of intelligence; likewise, it seems to me, the commentators who pounce on Libeskind's work in an effort to catch and devour its meaning, the meaning, that is, that might lie hidden within it. Together with the folio reproduction of Chamber Works are four short introductory essays by Peter Eisen man, Kurt Forster, John Hejduk and Aldo Rossi. While admitting the barriers to ordinary comprehension, the essayists say that his draw? ings are hieroglyphics (Rossi) or that they are illustrations of a process of thought (Hejduk) or that they are a kind of writing (Eisenman); that they are spatialized scores, musical translations (Forster), pictures of the soul (Hejduk), ana? morphoses (Forster). It is not that they lack cir? cumspection. Eisenman is aware that his recom? mending that Chamber Works be read like writing 'insists on their having a significance that as graphics they could not have'. Hejduk and Rossi (whose contribution is, incidentally, very good) recognize the inexplicable in them. Yet they cannot help but treat Chamber Works as having hidden meaning. The machinations of appreciative language force them to fabricate virtual meanings for the drawings to represent in place of what they know they cannot find ? and remarkably inventive about it they are ? but can their claims to have discovered the modes of representation (if not the content made apparent by the representation) be sustained? Take the hieroglyphic. For several centuries the deciphering of Egyptian hieroglyphics posed immense problems in Europe, but at the same time held the promise of revealing the secrets of arcane knowledge direct from the fount of civilization. In the popular imagination, which remembers when men and dinosaurs shared the earth, the hieroglyphics are still undeciphered. We do not so easily allow such exquisite mys? teries to be trampled on by the advance of palae? ography, the quest for the secret being so much more interesting than its eventual recovery. It is Flinders Petrie: Marks on First Dynasty pottery from Abydos, 1900. AA FILES 6 89</page><page sequence="2">in this state of latent revelation that Rossi employs the word hieroglyphics to describe Libeskind's drawings. Behind the indecipher? able marks there lies locked something about which we remain ignorant, perhaps a lost empire of meaning which we could disinter if only we had the key. It is an enchanting thought, almost irresistible and nonetheless so for one obvious difference. The men who carved the hieroglyphs knew what they meant. Daniel Libeskind claims no such authority in regard to his own work. His procedure is therefore more like augury than writing: first form the signs, knowing only how, never what, and then look to see if they signify anything: sometimes they do, sometimes they don't, sometimes good news, sometimes bad, sometimes nothing. Such a procedure shifts the weight of meaning from behind to in front, from before to after, from the verifiable to the unverifiable, and, as we have already noted, twentieth-century interpretation finds these pos? itions difficult to identify ? let alone deal with. There can be little doubt that Chamber Works are in some way systematic, but they are cer? tainly not a system of conventionalized notation or representation. Nor are they writing, hiero? glyphics, scores, pictures of the soul or of any other part substantial or ineffable. They are more like the tea-leaves in the cup, the spilt entrails of the eviscerated dove, distributions made in such a way that they cannot be fully understood even by their author. Returning now to the issue of opacity, it may be useful to compare the Chamber Works with Micromegas, a series exhibited by Libeskind in 1979 and similar to Chamber Works in tech? nique and format. Employing the ambiguities of Grandville: The Music Cannon architectural projection as their starting-point, Micromegas disrupt the homogeneous, continu? ous space of axonometry and isometry into a multitude of conflicting spaces. The series is easy to place within the context of modern art, if not modern architecture; it belongs to the class of works that investigate fluctuating rep? resentations of space and surface. Synthetic Cubist paintings are of this class, so are some of Lissitzky's Proun compositions, the drawings of Daniel Libeskind: 'Leakage', Micromegas, 1979. Joseph Albers and the canvases of AI Held. All are occupants of that fascinating world of visual ambiguity extolled by Ernst Gombrich. The Micromegas, however unrelenting their destruc? tion of unified picture space, are masterly compositions; abstract but eminently three dimensional, belonging to an established con? vention of pictorial fragmentation. After Micromegas, Libeskind's drawings turned back from abstraction. The Secret Life of Vegetables (1981) and Se guarderai le stelle sanza razzi (As is done through a little hole) (1981), for instance, are built up from recogniz? able fragments of machines, instruments, archi? tecture, furniture, limbs and diagrams. Com? posed of figurative elements embodied in space, they are relatively transparent to normal inter? pretation, the iconographer's dream, in fact: piles of recondite images, lashings of derived ex? pression. Let loose on these, our essayists would not need to have racked their own brains so hard and could more easily have ransacked Libes? kind's; the door of the safe was wide open. By complete contrast, figure and space are nearly absent in Chamber Works, not quite absent but nearly so. A floating nest of semi breves here, comical crotchets on ruptured staves there; resolution into cipher-like bits is occasional and partial, no more than enough to suggest a resemblance, never allowing the sign? like element, whether decapitated stick figure, cross, chequerboard or mascot Mondrian, to break free of the lines of which it is made, lines which refuse to synthesize into bodies, but which for courtesy's sake leave clues as to sources of inspiration. Like animal crackers in my soup, these little hints are more diverting than nutritional. The tendency in the work, in any case, is away from recognizability toward what Libeskind himself refers to as 'remote? ness'.1 What is so remarkable is the near total disengagement from signification of any kind. Such a condition is immensely difficult to achieve; mere abstraction does not begin to approach it. But are the Chamber Works not in some way spatial representations, as suggested by Forster, however far removed from ordinary experience? The answer turns out to be no, not, anyway, the kind of space that has to be thought and con? structed into existence by the draughtsman. Micromegas, which derive ultimately from the Cubist enterprise and look similar to the works of Al Held, were easy to place in the history of modern art; Chamber Works are not. Family likenesses are harder to come by. They have something to do with Kandinsky's musical com? positions, perhaps also with the architectural sketches by Eric Mendelsohn that were drawn while listening to records on the phonograph and titled according to their inspiration. Perhaps the graphical work of Hans H?rtung or Roberto Crippa in the 1950s, of Joel Fisher or Sol Le Wit more recently, all distant relatives at best. Another kind of opacity. No one to talk about. No transactions to record. No past to recon? struct. 90 AA FILES 6</page><page sequence="3">Mircomegas were eminently spatial; Chamber Works allow of only the most detached and uncertain spatial interpretation. The drawings are made of lines that intersect but hardly ever meet. Each of the myriad is a separate construc? tion that begins and ends in its own good time, not joining to another of its kind. The work of a line, its functions, the things it does other than just being a line, are to divide one territory from another, to enclose areas, to join points, to mark paths. This is what they do as edges, traces, contours, trajectories, vectors. The lines of Chamber Works do not do any of these things. Though perfectly regular in construction, and looking as if they belonged to geometry, they may well be amongst the least geometrical lines ever drawn. Since Descartes demonstrated the relationship between geometrical figures and algebraic func? tions, mathematicians have understood that geometry can do without lines, but here are neat Euclidean lines that do without geometry or, to qualify the absolute proscription, lines which on occasion more or less accidentally deposit geo? metrical figures in the same way that they oc? casionally engender signs. Yet despite their lack of employment in normal business, despite their individualization, the lines do interact by drift? ing in parallel sets, intersecting, pairing up into ribbon forms which sometimes intertwine in complex knots (the only deliberately illusionistic device, since the first strip drawn ends up appearing to be on top, as if it had been the last laid). They float together in loose formation or condense into tight fibrous bunches. Without representing space, any of the Chamber Works can be fantasized into three dimensions, given sufficient volition in the observer, for the space is thought into them by him, not projected out of them by the draughts? man. The uniform line of the architectural pen helps Libeskind to avoid constructing illusions of space in the drawings, but what is curious, and very impressive, is that even within the narrow confines of his chosen medium a dy? namic potency emanates from somewhere. The mechanically regulated line is not an obvious choice for the evocation of movement. Engraving, which permits far greater expres? sion of line than a Rotring pen, proved incapable of transferring the vital qualities of cartoons or paintings into prints. Marcantonio, excellent in his craft, tried to perform this service for Raphael, and the world he managed to recreate in lines looked as if it had been steeped in toffee in between times. Libeskind has found a way to make the laborious traipse of upright pen into a frigid calligraphy which does not transfer real qualities of movement into lines (making them porters of their own origin) but invokes kinds of motion unconnected to actions previously performed. Fragmentation has been the leitmotif of Libeskind's work. First impressions of Chamber Works might lead one to think that it continues to be so. Even the subtitle, 'Architectural Medi? tations on Themes from Heraclitus', helps by Joseph Albers: Mural, Corning Glass Showrooms, New York, 1956.

Electron/positron tracks in a bubble chamber. implication to confirm it, since Heraclitus is known to us only through fragments. A collec? tion of odd epigrams and sentences from diverse sources, he, Heraclitus, has to be reconstituted from bits like an amphora stuck together by archaeologists. Fragmentation assumes the pos? sibility, theoretical if not practical, of recon? structing an original that has been broken, of putting together the busted vase. In the past, Libeskind has exploited the psychotic ambiva? lence of the technique which may either register a delight in smashing things up or sadness in sur? veying the shattered scene. Yet fragmentation has to be figurative because only things with a constitution can be broken. Unity and fragmentation are the two major contrasted modes of twentieth-century composi? tion in architecture as well as painting. A classic dialectical pair, married and bickering, they are unable to carry on without each other. The Chamber Works do not move towards unity, nor are they subject to fragmentation. It took me a while to realize that there was nothing to be broken, no virtual space, no subject matter, no substructure, no geometry. Lines that do not make bodies cannot be broken. The discovery of this area outside of unity and fragmentation -^^5-&lt;&amp;C Laurence Sterne: Lines of narrative from Tristram Shandy, 1760. may be the greatest single achievement of the series. So it looks as if all direct communication from the draughtsman through the drawing to the observer has been sabotaged by the former. The remaining signs we may call politenesses; the carry-over of resemblances from earlier works, residua; the words surrounding the project, extraneous. Despite being under the protection of an ancient sage, the past of these drawings is vanishing before our eyes. Yet one transmitted message comes through clearly, and it is propa? gated not by the individual drawings but by their assembly into a set. The twenty-eight drawings divide into two groups of fourteen, one group vertical in format, one horizontal. They were, it turns out, exhibited incorrectly. Hung in straightforward sequence, 1 to 14, they should rather have been paired: num? bers 1 and 14, 2 and 13, 3 and 12, 4 and 11,5 and 10, 6 and 9, 7 and 8 in the horizontal series, and likewise with the vertical. Pythagoras, referred to in Libeskind's introduction through a quotation from Heraclitus as 'the prince of impostors', makes his presence felt. The number 28 is a summation of integers 1 to 7, a Pythagorean operation. There are 7 pairs in each group of drawings and the sequence numbers of each pair add always to 15. The drawings decrease in breadth or width from 2:1 (nothing could be more reverent to con? vention) to 200:1 (nothing could be less like the things we recognize as drawings). The drawings made out of lines end up turning into a line, pro? voking the thought that every line could be a world to itself composed also of a multitude of lines, and so on. As exhibited, there was a strong suggestion of a plane rotating on a horizontal, then a vertical axis. The anamorphosis, noted by Forster, is this appearance of rotation into the oblique. Hung as Libeskind would have wished, this effect would be largely obliterated; the proportional contraction in the drawings would then be easier to imagine as a compression than as a three dimensional rotation. Which leaves the numbers; they are, I think, hardly more than a framing to the drawings, an external principle of organization. Rossi, though, sees them as a pointer towards integral meaning. If they are, it is a pity because, by pointing straight backwards, they break through the opacity to frontal interpretation constructed with such careful brilliance by Libeskind. Ironic, too. Pythagorean mathematics is not only ancient, it is antiquated. It is the subject of in? tense mystification arising from the belief that Number is the informing principle behind reality. Now, Chamber Works, as we have seen, manage to disengage the drawing from its own history ? an awesome accomplishment, as the draughts? man, allowing himself no certainty at any point, gives himself nothing to lean on except his elbows. The separation between systems of representation and the aspects of reality they normally stand for (the celebrated uncoupling of signifier and signified in linguistics) has not been applied to architecture in this or any other way before, despite large importations of devalued semiological currency into architectural journal? ism. Nor is it an idea derived exclusively from lin? guistics. While Saussure was giving his seminal lectures in Lausanne in 1913, modern painting was well on the way to disengaging itself from illustration. But the most conclusive and spec? tacular severance between reality and its bonded representation occurred nearly a century before, when the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss devised logically rigorous geometries, as intern? ally consistent as the common-sensical Euclidean variety, but which could not apply to real space. From which developed the now common idea 92 AA FILES 6</page><page sequence="5">that mathematics has absolutely no pre-ordained affinity with nature but is an independently derived system of correlations. Capable, perhaps, of sometimes running in step with nature, it is capable also of traversing vast areas of the possible but unreal: a marvellous new power. So, whether or not Pythagoras was in his own time 'prince of impostors', he certainly plays that role in Chamber Works, for his magical numbers that make the world ? the ultimate hid? den meaning ? are as alien from Libeskind's project as it is possible to be. Architecture without building So far the drawings have been reviewed without particular reference to architecture in an attempt to find out how they are constituted. In describ? ing how opaque they are to frontal interpreta? tion, how they refuse to make manifest a mean? ing that lies behind them, they have been charac? terized in largely negative terms. But then if we cannot look behind them, we must look in front for the things that the drawing might yet sug? gest, might lead to, might provoke; in short, for what is potent in them rather than what is latent. Such a posture of observation is maintained by Libeskind himself when he talks of Rossi's Teatro del Mondo, suggesting the question as to 'whether the "no longer" of modern architec? ture actually belongs io its very own "not yet" '.2 If this posture is adopted, then criticism as we know it would have only a marginal function, soon exhausted, that of showing the inexplica bility of the work. Interpretation would other? wise have to mutate into another form, with an entirely different orientation, revealing potency not latency. It would become as uncertain an enterprise as any kind of search not assured of at least the possibility of verification. In the mean time my intention is no more than to indicate the empty space outside the interpretive cone of vision, pointing out its qualitative difference from the space within. The much exercised question 'What have they to do with architecture?' may overshadow some qualities of Chamber Works not entailed in the answer. Nevertheless, it can hardly be ignored. Nothing, some say. Then there are those who would admit them as a boundary condition, anything further removed from the basic busi? ness of making buildings being inadmissible. There are those who might follow Eisenman in describing them as Not-Architecture, a category related by direct opposition. There may be those who would see them the way Werner Oechslin saw Micromegas,2 as a graphic exemplification of qualities that could not so well be achieved in building, an imaginative overspill (he compared Libeskind to Piranesi). Always metaphors of extremity are employed, and there is good cause for this, but I would like to treat the question differently by altering the position of Chamber Works in the metaphor. Suppose the word 'architecture', instead of hav? ing its centre somewhere over a block in Port? land, Oregon, had its centre close to these drawings. It is not just a centre of interest that is being talked about, but a centre of activity, an epicentre. Then whatever is renounced in the drawings (and there is a strong renunciation in them) would be excluded from architecture's central concerns. Whatever is detached from the drawings will fall away from the word. Building, space, image, programme; the essences and crutches of architecture in Portland would be centrifuged to the outer edge of the subject, maybe beyond. At the centre, a way of drawing that makes use of architectural instruments ? Map of the underworld on the floor of the outer coffin of the Steward Seni, Egyptian, 2000 BC.

Architecture would be moved from building to drawing, which is more like moving from Chicago to Paris than discovering the Antipodes, in so far as the manner of working is concerned. In one way this is a restoration: drawing once again the fountainhead of architectural creation. In another way it is a truncation. Architecture, which has always involved drawing before building, can be split into prior and subsequent activities: design and construction. The building can be discarded as an unfortunate aftermath, and all the properties, values, and attributes that are worth keeping can be held in the drawing; perhaps a better way of putting it would be to say that they retract back into the drawing. And it is true that the imaginative work of architecture has for a long time been ac? complished almost exclusively through drawing, though manifested almost exclusively in build? ing. The great peculiarity of architecture as a vis? ual art (a peculiarity it nevertheless shares with orchestral, choral, operatic works and, to a les? ser extent, film) is the considerable distance between the process of composition and the thing being composed. By truncating architec? ture and disposing of building, an intimacy between a way of designing and the thing designed is achieved. The architect can travel light. His work does not now involve him in the tedious entropy of getting something built, nor in the dubious poli? tics of improving social conditions, nor in the appalling sycophancy of client-sucking, nor in reconstructing his personality to fit his job. Libeskind, when asked to explain his work, will talk instead about architecture in general. Some? times he will say that architecture is no longer possible. Once it was, but not now. Sometimes, when drawn, he will nevertheless claim that his work is architecture. He moves with the tools of his trade, like a refugee. He does the same thing in a different place, starting from scratch, not as a colonist but as an emigrant. The Chamber Works are prefaced with a luminious quotation which I repeat in full: 'What do you suppose that white line in the sky that you saw from the crack in the cattle-car on your way to Stutthof really was?' the interviewer asked Elaine some thirty years later in her Brooklyn home. 'You see, in order to survive you must believe in something, you need a source of inspiration, of cour? age, something bigger than yourself, something to overcome reality. The line was my source of inspir? ation, my sign from heaven. 'Many years later, after liberation, when my child? ren were growing up, I realized that the white line might have been fumes from a passing airplane's exhaust pipe, but does it really matter?'4 In the uncompleted there is always possibility. In an event cut off from its origins there is promise. There are plenty of people who, either prac? tising architecture as we know it, or having given it up, regard it, like Libeskind, as fundamentally corrupt, but it is just opinion and it makes no real difference to the way anything happens. Except one. Those who stay console themselves with dreams of a Golden Age. Contemporary architecture, they say, is in a state of degener? acy, has lost its meaning and, although it cannot recover its original significance in full, its lost past becomes, for them, a subject of endless reminiscence, a droning noise of quotations, images, models and derivations. The great mumble. Libeskind too believes that much has been lost, but because the loss is irretrievable, he realizes there is no point in repetition and only sentiment in reminiscence. Instead, by cutting out the aspects of architecture that are brimful of meaning ? its all too vivid meaning as a social, economic and political process of con? struction ? he allows for the construction of lines in the sky. Like Elaine in the cattle-truck, Libeskind invokes a principle of transcendence conditionally, the lost past of architecture, per? haps even now recognized as an enabling fiction. So, yes, if the centre of architecture moved over here it would leave a lot behind. Marvel? lous. More to be said. Not now. Soon someone might even ask whether it is possible to escape from the truck, and how. Robin Evans Notes 1.
