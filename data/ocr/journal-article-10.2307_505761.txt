<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology in Anatolia MACHTELD J. MELLINK This survey of campaigns in 1990 gives brief notices of progress in the archaeological fieldwork, both ex- cavations and surveys, which annually now add up to a total of some 150 enterprises. The listing remains flexible and selective depending upon results of in- dividual campaigns. Emphasis is on the pre-Classical sites and on sites with strong Anatolian imprint in the first millennium B.C., rather than on Greek and Ro- man sites, although they too absorbed the Anatolian heritage (fig. 1). For the Classical sites, Stephen Mitch- ell's quinquennial report in AR 36 (1989-1990) 83- 131 offers more detail in an excellent survey from the Propontis to Cilicia, with comments and bibliography. Mitchell's AR reports are rich sources of information, which supplement and balance this newsletter. In 1990-1991 Anatolian archaeology suffered great scholarly and personal losses. Kurt Bittel, a giant in Anatolian archaeology and history, who spent the most creative years of his life excavating and inter- preting the Hittite capital, and whose insight in all periods of Anatolian culture was without peer, died on 30 January 1991, mourned by colleagues and stu- dents in many parts of the world, but having left a corpus of writings that continue to teach and chal- lenge archaeologists and historians. The death of Emmanuel Laroche on 16 June 1991 affects archaeologists as much as linguists. His lucid studies of Hittite hieroglyphic-Luwian problems ad- vanced our understanding of Anatolia's early history and monuments incisively. Wolfgang Milller-Wiener, who directed the Miletus excavations and wrote the exemplary Bildlexikon zur Topographie Istanbuls (1977) died on 25 March 1991 on a return visit to Istanbul where he directed the German Archaeological Institute until 1988. The re- spect in which he was held is reflected in the volume of IstMitt 39 (1989), which was dedicated to him on his 65th birthday. Kenan Erim, whose sudden death in Ankara on 3 November 1990 shocked his colleagues and all ad- mirers of his resurrection of Aphrodisias, has been commemorated by Glen Bowersock in AJA 95 (1991) 281-83. In the international world of Anatolian archaeol- ogy, these men are mourned but their students and teams are honoring them by their commitment. In this year's report, one of the aspects calling for special comment is the prehistoric Anatolian-Euro- pean connection. In the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods, the coordination of Anatolian sites with their counterparts in the Near East has not been difficult on the eastern frontiers, where connections with the technical and cultural development of North Meso- potamia and North Syria could be recognized and traced with the aid of characteristic ceramic and arti- factual features. The Taurus Mountains in their full extent put a barrier in the way of further contacts before the third millennium B.C. Central and western Anatolia with their indigenous ceramic inventory de- prived the archaeologist of Near Eastern synchron- EKCZTEPESAMSUN TEKiRDAG ISNBUL PENDIK iZMiT AINOS YARIMBURGAZ AMASYA KAMANR VANDI MARMAR iZNiK iNANL HYKORTAKOY BAYBURT AELNA HUYUK MA?AT KYZI`KOS - --ILIPIN;R'EKYAA TROY OSDASKYLEM H ANKARA R KAMOG EKSKiYAPARBAPATNOSA AMORIUM BEKULTEPE KTEPE DEMiRCi HUY ENPORDION PAAROP SMKUO .OOE AFYON BOA ASS K RASGEZANTEPE-*RECMSH USAKZ ASSOS ADILCE n 'n DATO A GOR L DAAY MAAYAU HAFRA AANA O AYANI PEREAAON K(E BLAIN1ACEM6,0UK Is6SKHLJYU SAMSTALiREVAIVON BOLKARI KAKARATEPTEPBIRECI KNIDOS INANDA PHASELISM AT XANTHO.

MELLINK [AJA 96 isms, and the European connection was disputed due to lack of stratified sequences on the Anatolian side. This is now changing principally through the ener- getic surveys and excavations conducted by the Insti- tute of Prehistory of the University of Istanbul, whose members are working from the Thracian shores to the upper Tigris, and who are presenting new evi- dence for the cultural sequences of sites like Toptepe, Hoca Qeqme near Ainos-Enez, Yarlmburgaz, in col- laboration with the Dutch excavators at Ilicaplnar on the west shore of Iznik Lake, and the German-Turkish teams in the Eskigehir area. The breakthrough from Europe to central Anatolia is imminent, and will, as Mehmet Ozdogan explains, extend to central Anatolia and the deep deposits of Chalcolithic Aligar. The earliest (or at least early) food-producing acer- amic settlements in Anatolia are strikingly original in their architectural and sculptural development, with Nevalih ori and its sanctuary as the prime example. The relationship in time and technology to commu- nities like that of Aplklh Hytik on the plateau is another question that approaches tentative solution. For the protoliterate stage, the Uruk offshoots along the Euphrates just north of Carchemish are in urgent need of excavation. They will disappear in connection with the new dam constructions at Birecik and just north of Carchemish. The recent surveys of the endangered areas along the Euphrates have made the situation clearer, as have the results of the rescue excavations north of the Atatfrk Dam. Salvage of these irreplaceable sites is essential. For the third and second millennia B.C. archaeol- ogists will increasingly have to coordinate their re- search with that of metallurgists. At the 1990 symposium several reports concerned the search for ancient mines (e.g., Kestel-G61ltepe) as well as the analysis of ores and excavated artifacts. The technical needs of international Bronze Age communities cre- ated networks of trade and aggression on land and sea, involving many parts of Anatolia with its crucial resources. The excavation of the shipwreck at Ka?- Uluburun is giving a major demonstration of the situation in the 14th century B.C. Historically, the new discoveries at Bogazk6y are in keeping with the rank of the Hittite capital. At Nigan- tepe the burnt remnants of a Hittite building have yielded an archive of official seal impressions includ- ing those of the entire dynasty of Suppiluliuma I down to Suppiluliuma II. The historical and glyptic infor- mation is abundant. A promising new source of Hittite texts is the large archive discovered at Ortakoy, ca. 50 km northeast of Bogazkoy, where Hittite letters, cult inventories, and descriptions of festivals as well as Hurrian texts have been recognized. The archaeological substance of Mycenaean inter- action with the northwest coast of Anatolia is coming to light gradually. The work at Panaztepe promises evidence of a symbiosis of Mycenaeans and Anatolians in an Aeolic harbor town of the LH III period, at- tested by habitation remains as well as hybrid burial forms. At Troy, the new excavations are beginning to yield data for the study of local versus imported ce- ramics and other artifacts or customs, while the Be- giktepe cemetery, which has clues to the problem, is being studied for publication. These sites with accessible LB levels (including the lower town of Troy, when excavation can descend in areas cleared by the excavators of Novum Ilium) will help to reconstruct the interaction of Achaeans and northwest Anatolians. The history of Ephesus and Miletus will be more difficult to extricate from water- logged levels below the Artemisium and Athena Tem- ple, but there is better ground to dig at Ayasoluk- Ephesus. The early history of the Phrygians remains to be analyzed in more detail at Gordion, especially in con- nection with the stratum of handmade "barbaric" ware intrusive in the early Iron Age. The presence of this ware at Kaman-Kaleh6yiik across the Halys is a signal to be watched carefully. The seventh-century prosperity of Phrygians along the south edge of the plateau is now confirmed by a hoard of bronzes found at Beygehir, with horsegear resembling that found at Elmali-Bayindir in 1987. One has to remember that Konya-Alaeddintepe has typical south Phrygian strata under the mosque crowning the hill in the heart of the modern town. For Phrygian roots in the north- west, the new excavations at Daskyleion promise good evidence, along with historical substance of the site in Lydian and Persian times. On 13 June 1991, 100 years after the opening of the Istanbul Archaeological Museum, a new wing and the renovated ground floor were festively opened. The history of the museum is illustrated in a room dedicated to Osman Hamdi Bey, the founder of the Archaeological Museum (see also H. Metzger, "La correspondance passive d'Osman Hamdi Bey," MnmAclnscr 11, 1990). The sarcophagi excavated by Hamdi Bey are on display in new splendor. In the new wing, the second floor is mainly devoted to Troy, with the Schliemann and Blegen materials on exhibit in stratigraphic order in a series of spacious cases, well lit and labeled. On the opposite side of this ex- hibition hall is a sequence of other west Anatolian material starting with Yarimburgaz and Fikirtepe, and</page><page sequence="3">1992] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ANATOLIA 121 proceeding with the Yortan cemeteries and other An- atolian counterparts of the Troy sequence. At the back of the hall are Iron Age displays of Phrygian material from the Koerte excavations at Gordion in 1900, with a reconstruction of the chamber of tumulus III, and comparanda from as far away as Carchemish. The entire hall is a great contribution to Anatolian Bronze Age and Iron Age archaeology, with its intelligent and attractive organization and rich display of originals never before visible in such comparative context. Bibliography. With admirable efficiency, the Min- istry of Culture's General Directorate of Monuments and Museums completed the publication of the 1990 Symposium within a year, ready to be distributed at the 1991 Symposium, which was held in Canakkale. The four new volumes are XII. Kazz Sonuglarz Toplantizs I and II, here referred to as Symposium 12:1 and 2 (1990); VIII. Araftzrma Sonuglarz Toplantzsz, here referred to as Research Symposium 8 (1990); and VI. Arkeometri Sonuglarz Toplantzsz, here referred to as Archaeometry Symposium 6 (1990). In addition, the symposium held by directors and staff members of museums in 1990, where rescue excavations were the first item on the agenda, is now published as the first of a new series: I. Miize Kurtarma Kazzlari Semineri, 19-20 Nisan 1990, Ankara (Ankara 1991), hereafter I. Mize Kurtarma Kazzlari Semineri. This volume contains important reports on the valiant efforts to protect endangered sites and to salvage remains left by looters. The Tuirk Tarih Kurumu has inaugurated a new annual presenting narrative field reports called Ho- yiik. Volume 1 (1991) presents reports by Turkish excavators for the year 1988. Some of the illustrations are in color. The acts of the 10th Congress of the Tuirk Tarih Kurumu held in 1986 have now appeared. Volumes I and II contain archaeology and ancient history: X. Tiirk Tarih Kongresi. Kongreye Sunulan Bildiriler I and II (Ankara 1990), here referred to as TTKongresi 10:1 and 2 (1990). The 13th Congress was held in Septem- ber 1990, with one section again devoted to archae- ology and ancient history. A well-deserved tribute is N. Baggelen and M. Lugal eds., FestschriftfiirJale Inan (Arkeoloji ve Sanat Yay- inlari, Istanbul 1991) in two volumes, offering a wealth of articles principally but not exclusively in the Classical field. The Newsletter for Anatolian Studies 7:1 (1991) con- tains a current bibliography of forthcoming and pub- lished works. A report on Late Antique, Early Christian, and Early Byzantine archaeology for the decade 1977-1986 by Urs Peschlow appeared in Actes du XIr Congres international d'archeologie chritienne (Rome 1989) 1563-1619 (Constantinople and Asia Minor). PALAEOLITHIC, NEOLITHIC, CHALCOLITHIC Yarnmburgaz. In 1990, Giiven Arsebilk and F. Clark Howell report, progress was made in four dif- ferent areas of this cave with its Lower Palaeolithic deposits, especially in the lower cave. The palaeoe- cology and geomorphology of the cave were exam- ined in detail. "A number of sand and gravel deposits from the upper chamber may well be good candidates for a Last Interglacial beach deposit. If it is so, then its age could be somewhere between 125,000 and 85,000 B.P., i.e., Tyrrhenian in the broad sense. The lithic industry, on the other hand, consists mainly of flake tools; choppers, though present, are rare. Elec- tron spin resonance dating work is still in progress; the results thus far indicate a period prior to the Last Interglacial Age." For an interim report see Sympos- ium 12:1 (1990) 12-41. Karain and Okiizini. Imn Yalgmkaya reached sub- stantial Middle Palaeolithic levels in area E down to strata 13 (excavated) and 22 (in east profile) at Karain. She also expanded her work in the smaller cave named WOkizini, 32 km north of Antalya. Here the upper levels are mixed but Epipalaeolithic levels emerge clearly, with a chipped stone industry in which traces of sickle gloss may appear. The transition to food production may be accessible to further investi- gations in this cave. Yallnkaya examined other caves in the vicinity and reports that many caves have de- posits of the Chalcolithic period. Some were used for burials, others for residence. A connection with the mound of G6ktepe, ca. 4 km south of Karain (AJA 89 [1985] 551) must be established. The unexplored caves and open sites along the north border of the plain of Antalya may provide a clear sequence from Epipalaeolithic to Neolithic and Chalcolithic, of which the sites of Belbapl and Beldibi in Lycia are also part. For the 1989 season at Karain see Symposium 12:1 (1990) 43-70. An important study of the tool industry is I.

"Aceramic Neolithic is represented by two sites, one a mound on the west bank of the Sason Gay, Hallan Qemi Tepesi, over 4 m in height. Obsidian constitutes ca. 66% of the lithic assemblage, which contains bor- ers, scrapers, backed blades with and without retouch truncations, and triangular microliths. Of numerous stone bowl fragments, several bear incised designs (e.g., crosshatched triangles). Burnt clay fragments are remnants of wattle-and-daub or roofing.</page><page sequence="5">1992] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ANATOLIA 123 "Halaf is represented by a single-period site, Cola Avika, with strong local traits. Two sites had mono- chrome Chalcolithic wares." A report will appear in Anatolica. Hallan Qemi Tepesi has been selected for excavation in 1991. (ay6ni. The ceramic Neolithic, Chalcolithic, and Bronze Age levels of the mound were investigated in 1989 and 1990, Mehmet Ozdogan reports. The ce- ramic Neolithic era is attested by rectangular stone foundations and terrace walls. The ceramic sequence of the site has affinities to dark-faced burnished wares of pre-Halaf date; the later, painted pottery is related to Hassuna and Mersin wares. Terracotta tokens and figurines appear in the same context. For 1989 see Symposium 12:1 (1990) 71-85, and for a discussion of development of architectural techniques, W. Schirmer in Koldewey Gesellschaft Bericht 35 (1990) 8-14. Nevalih ori. H. Hauptmann conducted the sixth campaign at this site on the right bank of the Kantara River in 1990 and reports: "In the upper level, an EB I house was found, terraced and rebuilt once (fig. 2). It had more than one room, and contained a cist grave in the anteroom. Two EB I cist graves elsewhere had contracted, female burials with pottery, bronze orna- ments (e.g., a spiral-headed pin), and stone beads. Pits contained copper slag. The finds resemble those from Hassek H6ytik and Kurban. "In the Halaf level a new type of complex was found, containing two tholoi connected by a 13-m long corridor-like unit. "The Aceramic Neolithic stage is represented by four levels, the upper two of which were excavated earlier. House 6, measuring 12.0 x 5.9 m (AJA 95 [1991] 127, fig. 3), had a limestone chip layer below its clay floor, and underpinnings of stone rectangles separated by channels with large stone slabs as covers. The channels run under the walls. "Level 4 contained, below House 2, the long rectan- gular House 12, measuring 14.0 x 5.5 m, with the same stone and channel substructure (fig. 3). The entrance was on the west side near the Kantara River. House 21 was a bit smaller (12.6 x 4.4 m) but of the same construction. Several of these houses were stor- age units. House 6 and the older form of 21 are suitable for habitation. "Near the northwest edge of the terrace, the build- ing with stelae in squares H-J/10-11 (AJA 95 [1991] 126, fig. 1) is a complex of 14 x 14 m (fig. 4). A stone bench ran along the inner face of the walls, with large stone slabs as covers. The individual slabs were sepa- rated by 12 upright slabs. In the 7.5 x 8.0 m interior space, 0.8 m below the bench level, a well-preserved terrazzo floor was found resembling the floor at Cay- oniu. Two large stone stelae originally had been an- chored in this floor, sculpted with human rep- Fig. 5. Nevah Cori. Back of limestone head. resentations. On top of these, T-shaped "capitals" supported the roof. "This building with stelae had a predecessor, largely demolished. A corner remains in which were two stelae with bird's head finials. Other fragments of sculpture from this predecessor are an over-lifesize limestone human head (fig. 5), the face of which had split off. The 37-cm high head is clean-shaven in the back except for a wavy snake (hair?) in high relief. A second, 50-cm long stone sculpture represents a bird (vulture?) in perfect rendering; eyes and beak are contoured in black. "On the terrace opposite Nevali Cori is a second contemporary site, Nevalih ori II, of which so far two levels have been identified. House 17 here consists of remnants of a structure measuring 9.2 x 6.0 m, sim- ilar in technique and tripartite layout to the houses of Nevalih ori I. The settlement therefore developed on both banks of the river. "Small finds include quantities of chipped flint points of Byblos type, sickle blades, and burins known from PPNB, e.g., at Jericho. Ground stone axes and</page><page sequence="6">124 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 96 Fig. 6. Nevalih ori. Limestone animal heads. Pres. width 8-9 cm. Fig. 7. Nevah ori. Limestone human head. Ht. 9 cm. beads were also found. Noteworthy, too, are small clay figurines, some of men and women, as at Qay6nti. Some simple stone figurines also occur. Excellent modeling distinguishes limestone animal figures, e.g., bear, horse, wild boar, and birds (fig. 6). Human heads are rendered in a naturalistic or stylized manner (figs. 7-8). For the first time we also found a copper bead. "In general, Nevalih ori is an early settled com- munity with domesticated cattle and cultivation of cereals, although hunting is still important. The many structures serving as storage units, the cult building, and the works of art give Nevalih ori the rank of a central place." Fig. 8. Nevah ori. Limestone human head. Ht. 6 cm. The work will continue for one more season in 1991. The water level of the Atatuirk Dam lake is coming close to the site. Aplkli Hiyiik. Ufuk Esin has expanded the exca- vation of this Aceramic Neolithic site southeast of Aksaray to an area of ca. 1300 m2. Seven building levels have been found in a sounding to virgin soil. The rectangular houses have separate walls built of large mudbricks without stone foundations. Some houses have two to three rooms with connecting doors. The houses are more or less grouped in clus- ters. Bins and compartments of mudbrick are ar- ranged in the rooms; hearths and firepits have stone floors in front. One house had red floors and traces of red paint on the walls. Contracted burials are found below floors. Agate beads occur as tomb gifts. The domestic equipment includes obsidian tools (blades,</page><page sequence="7">1992] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ANATOLIA 125 ILIPINAR ... .- _-. ": " "' " . . ..."...

Sheep and goat are still not domesticated, and some bovines are at- tested. Hacibeyli Hoyiik. Sachihiro Omura reports that the site of Hacibeyli in the Develi plain south of Erciyes Dag has ample evidence for Aceramic Neo- lithic occupation in a damaged scarp with obsidian tools. Ceramic Neolithic: Hoca 1(egme Hoyiik. This small prehistoric mound 3 km east of Enez-Ainos was tested by Mehmet Ozdogan in the framework of the Ainos excavations in 1990. He identified five levels of Neolithic habitation. "The upper level has pottery similar to Karanovo late III to early IV. Most of this pottery is black-burnished, and there are numerous examples of horned handles and fluted decoration. The earliest phase has fine red-slipped burnished ware with tubular or crescent lugs reminiscent of Hacilar XI-VI." Excavations will be undertaken in 1991. Obsidian in Northwest Anatolia. Fission track analysis of obsidian from Fikirtepe, Pendik, and Dom- ali is reported upon in Archaeometry Symposium 8 (1990) 73-86. The origin is probably Anatolian and may include the (iftlik region. Ilipinar. J.J. Roodenberg reports that in 1990 he investigated the plans and construction methods of houses in a 40 x 10 m area containing up to eight building levels. The houses were of pise and timber; in many instances rows of postholes are the only surviving remnants (fig. 9). Most houses measure ca. 5 x 6 m. The inventory gives specific clues to the European and Anatolian connections of the site in its Neolithic and Chalcolithic development. Radiocarbon dates start in the early seventh millennium B.C. An extensive report of the 1987-1989 seasons appeared in Anatolica 16 (1989-1990) 61-144. H6yiicek. Refik Duru, in his second season at this site 35 km south of Burdur, made further probings in two Neolithic levels, the lower one of which was better preserved. The pottery is red- and brown- burnished, sometimes with relief ornament and lugs. Female figurines are numerous and vary in types: seated on cushion, kneeling, standing, or squatting, giving birth (head of child emerging), not overly obese but wide and short. Heads are attached separately, and one figurine had a bone tube in the hole for attachment. Faces are incised on the bone inserts. Marble cups are among the remarkable inventory. Kuruiay. A report on the last season of excavation at Kurugay (Neolithic levels 12-13) by Refik Duru appeared in Hiyiik 1 (1988) 1-6.</page><page sequence="8">126 MACHTELD J.

Ugur Silistreli reports on the 1989 season in Symposium 12:1 (1990) 95-104. This site near Nigde represents a regional variant of ceramic Neolithic culture with rectangular and round houses on stone foundations, containing a developed inven- tory including storage jars and other pottery with relief decorations. Remarkable are animals (e.g., stags) shown in profile with heads turned frontally. Small figurines of females with pointed hats appear in the upper level. Obsidian tools remain prominent. Children's graves appear in the settlement; tomb gifts are beads and pendants of stone and shell.

Mehmet Ozdogan pub- lished a report on the rescue excavation of the pre- historic mound 5 km west of Perinthos-Marmara Eregli in Arkeoloji ve Sanat 46-49 (1990) 2-23 with details on the stratigraphy of the Chalcolithic levels and the context of the anthropomorphic storage ves- sel found in layer 5 of phase 3 (figs. 10-11), in a "large burnt building of 7.5 x 3.1 m, near a raised platform. The vessel, measuring 35 x 35 x 85 cm, was made of unbaked clay with much organic tempering. Its rectangular body stood on four conical feet; its arms, breasts, eyes, ears, and nose are represented in relief. The vessel is painted in dull red, indicating the dress, curly hair on the shoulders of the female figure, and crossbands on her breasts. The vessel bears a distinct resemblance to the Kokenydomb vessels of Hungary." See also Symposium 12:1 (1990) 351-75. Central, Southwest, and Pontic Anatolia. Sur- veys conducted by Sachihiro Omura in 1989-1990 resulted in considerable evidence for Chalcolithic habitation of Aligar type in the areas of Yozgat and Bogazliyan. He also proposes to date a painted chaff- faced ware known in the Delice valley to the Chalco- lithic period. For a recent report see Research Sym- posium 8 (1990) 69-89. Mehmet Ozsait in surveys of the Golhisar district noted ample evidence for Chalcolithic sites, and he also draws attention to some Chalcolithic in the G6yn- iicek district southwest of Amasya, Research Sympos- ium 8 (1990) 35-44 and 45-54.

Tahsin Ozgi?A reports that work on the mound continued with investigation of the building phases of the Warshama palace in the center of the citadel. Each phase was marked by additions to the original plan. The palace walls are built against a rebuilt stone fortification wall of the inner citadel. The Warshama palace measures 110 x 100 m in size. It ultimately was burned down in a late phase of Warshama's rule or even later. Lists of temple person- nel and Warshama's letters belong to earlier phases of the palace. Warshama's father Inar also lived in this palace. Much disturbance of the context is due to Hrozny's excavations of 1925 in this area. Work in the Karum, grid squares LVII-LXI/131- 134, showed that the East Karum is widening here in the direction of the road to Malatya. Here both the Ia and Ib levels are well preserved in layout. Small finds are plentiful in each house. Burials (pithoi, stone cists, and a few simple inhumations) are rich in gifts. Stone cists of the Ib level (ca. 2.0 x 1.0 or 1.5 m) were cut down into archives of level II, which thus suffered damage. Both contracted and dorsal burials occur. The pottery in the tombs is of special funerary pur- pose. Among the other tomb gifts are weapons (e.g., shaft-hole axe), gold foil strips covering eyes and mouth, silver seals, necklaces, and decorated bone boxes. In the houses, Ib tablets contain few records of trade; instead, legal texts, especially pertaining to local Anatolian family laws (marriage, divorce, inheri- tance), predominate; references to Assyrians are rare. No tablets have so far been found in level Ia. A Ib stone mold has the figures of a god, goddess, and child; a lead figurine of a novel type is a male deity holding one child in each arm. A group of small rock crystal figurines (weights?) of lions and sphinxes was found next to crystalline weights in duck shape. In level II, all houses in the excavated squares were of Assyrian merchants. Two new archives came to light. The tablets were found in mats or woven bas- kets, in jars or bowls, and on burnt and collapsed shelves in systematic order. The texts refer to trade or record legal decisions among Assyrians; some are memoranda of debts and interest. Some letters had not been sent off when the final burning in level II occurred; among them are letters requesting prompt shipment of certain goods from Assur. The baking of tablets is done in the houses of the merchants: in the fireplace if the quantity is small, and in the oven if many need baking. Some of the merchants were lit- erate, others worked through scribes. The internal chronology of level II is being clarified with the aid of the eponyms and the seal impressions with the names of Assyrian kings. Reports on the 1988 campaign by Tahsin Ozgui? and Kutlu Emre appear in Hiyiik 1 (1988) 11-14 and 15-16. OzgiiA discusses a terracotta head from the mound of Kanesh in Erlsr 21 (1990) 74-76. Bogazk6y. Peter Neve in 1990 undertook investi- gations of the Hittite constructions at Nigantepe. There were two Hittite buildings on the plateau at the base of Nigantepe. The northern one was entered by a monumental ramp from the citadel; the western one, measuring 45 x 25 m, with basements set in the slope (fig. 12), was badly burnt.

"More than half of the bullae carry impressions of royal seals. All great kings of the Hittite Empire pe- riod are represented, beginning with Shuppiluliuma I and continuing with Murshili II, Muwatalli II, Ur- hiteshup-Murshili III (fig. 14), Hattushili III (fig. 15), Tuthaliya IV (fig. 16), Arnuwanda III, and Shuppi- luliuma II. Also represented is Kurunta, whose great kingship is confirmed. The most frequent are seals of Shuppiluliuma I, Urhiteshup-Murshili III, and Tuth- aliya IV, followed by Muwatalli II and Hattushili III, the latter most often jointly represented with his great queen Puduhepa (fig. 17). King-and-queen seals also occur for Muwatalli (fig. 18) and his son Murshili III. Each ruler is represented by a variety of seal types. Fig. 15. Bogazk6y. Seal of Hattushili III. "The other bullae carry impressions of seals of officials, mostly scribes, among whom are princes, i.e., members of the royal family. The bullae were depos- ited systematically by the owners of the seals and also in some typological and chronological order. The west building at Nigantepe evidently contained a palace archive. "Of earlier date are the land deeds that carry seal impressions of Old Hittite kings, among them Hantili, Huzziya, and Muwatalli I. "The building on top of Nigantepe, connected with Fig. 14.

East of the south citadel (in N-0/11) the paved edges of a large artificial pond enclosed an area of ca. 92 x 65 m, as excavated along the west side and established in soundings along the south (fig. 19). The floor of the pond was leveled bedrock, covered by sediments containing numerous miniature vessels. A 1.4-m deep channel runs along the outer north edge of the pond, continuing east and west, here into the interior of the Shuppiluliuma chamber. This feature rules out the interpretation of the chambers as tombs, but may be connected with the reference to a 'divine road to the underworld' in the inscription in the chamber of Shuppiluliuma." J.D. Hawkins comments on the hieroglyphic Lu- wian text in this chamber in AA 1990, 305-14. P. Neve reported on the 1989 campaign in AA 1990, 267-303 and Symposium 12:1 (1990) 225-40; he dis- cusses builders' tools from Hattusha, notably a bronze saw, in IstMitt 39 (1989) 399-406.</page><page sequence="12">130 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 96 Ortak6y-C(orum. In 1990, Ayguil Sfiel started work at a mound near Ortak6y, ca. 50 km northeast of Bogazk6y, where a major Hittite building with court- yards has been discovered, containing typical ceramic and metal finds as well as an archive of Hittite (and some Hurrian) tablets that are coming to light in numerous fragments (ca. 1,800 so far). Further ex- cavations are being planned for this important site, which will represent a Hittite administrative station about halfway between the Hittite capital and Magat; for the area see Research Symposium 8 (1990) 95-97. Mapat. The archives of letters from Magat have now been published by Sedat Alp in two volumes: Hethitische Keilschrifttafeln aus Ma?at-Hdyiik and Heth- itische Briefe aus Mayat Hiyiik (Turk Tarih Kurumu 6:34-35, Ankara 1991). The historical and geograph- ical importance of these letters, most of which came from the level III palace, is discussed in detail, espe- cially the letters and seal of Tuthaliya III, the father of Shuppiluliuma I.

There are two levels of burials: the lower one has graves of regular orientation; the upper one shows less consistency; the chronological range is the end of the third millennium, perhaps continuing into the MB period. Ikiztepe. Onder Bilgi is continuing the excavations of the EB II and earlier habitation levels of mound I. The houses are built of timber and wattle-and-daub; a palisade surrounded the houses on top of the site. Special studies are being made of the architecture; the metal weapons are discussed by Bilgi in TTKon- gresi 10:1 (1990) 71-77; excavations in Hyiik 1 (1988) 25-27 and Symposium 12:1 (1990) 24-46. Acemh6yiik. Aliye Oztan extended the investiga- tion of the north and west sides of the Sarikaya palace, finding further evidence of cut stone bases along the north side. The south front of the Hatipler palace is also being examined. The date of cutting of the trees used in both palaces finds its place dendrochronol- ogically in the long sequence built up by Peter Kuni- holm. For the 1989 season see Symposium 12:1 (1990) 247-58; for 1988, Hiiyiik 1 (1988) 17-19. Nimet Oz- gui publishes an EB II-III jar from level X at Acem- h6ytik in Erlsr 21 (1990) 70-73. Porsuk. The construction of the Hittite postern at the west side of the mound was studied in detail, with longitudinal beams and crossbeams in the mudbrick of the bent, roofed passage.

The Japanese excavations un- der Sachihiro Omura are opening new squares on the mound with its well-stratified Phrygian and Hittite levels. The Iron Age level has characteristic Phrygian small finds and pottery. Kraters with silhouetted ani- mals are common, as are one-handled cups in red and buff ware with knobbed handles. A surprise is the presence of handmade "barbaric" ware related to that found at Gordion, e.g., in the shape of bowls with incised rims. This ware is the first sign of European traits (and migrants) across the Halys. The Hittite levels are beginning to emerge with finds of seals, signe-royal imprints on pottery, and buff and red wheelmade wares; the most promising is the find of a cuneiform tablet fragment of Karum Ib type. An interim report can be found in Symposium 10:1 (1990) 427-42. Karahoyuik-Konya. The late period of Old Assyr- ian trade and its sequel continue to be explored by Sedat Alp, who continued work in the promising northeast area. The inventory of the sizable houses includes regional variants of the Karum Ib ceramic repertoire. Metal is also in evidence (sickles, celts, a lead weight of ca. 1 kg), as are whetstones, weights of hematite, stamped bullae, and seals.

The wall dates to the period of about Beycesultan levels 14-13; sherds of a white-on-red painted pottery of Karata?-Semaytik type are associated with mono- chrome wares." Cilicia. A general historical study of Cilicia is pre- sented by Paolo Desideri and Anna MargheritaJasink, Cilicia dall'etMi di Kizzuwatna alla conquista macedona (Turin 1990). Kfitahya-Bilecik-Eskigehir. Turan Efe's continu- ing survey revealed new evidence for the Late Chal- colithic and EB I periods in the plain of Eskigehir. An EB I mound north of Bilecik, C(akilarasi Tepe, has an extensive cemetery. The EB III and MB periods are well represented in a large mound near In6nui-Bah- ;esaray. "Ahark6y, a site ca. 5 km north of Demircihiiyiik, has material representing the EB II and III periods. A fragment of a portable hearth (fig. 20) is typical in fabric to that of the coarse local cooking ware. The surface was smoothed with a finer clay, but left un- burnished. Blackened areas indicate its exposure to heat. The protuberance above the handle appears to be therio- or anthropomorphic. Similar portable hearths are known from the Konya plain and Cilicia (Tarsus), as well as from central and east Anatolia. This hearth is the first of its kind discovered as far west as the Eskigehir plain." In Anatolica 16 (1989-1990) 31-48 Efe discusses three early sites near Eskigehir and analyzes their chronological context (Chalcolithic and EB I) in terms of Konya plain sites and the Hacilar-Beycesultan re- gion. For the 1989 survey see Research Symposium 8 (1990) 163-77. Demircihiiyiik. Jirgen Seeher in cooperation with the Bursa Museum in 1990 started the excavation of the necropolis of Sariket on a slope ca. 250 m south- west of the settlement of Demircihfiyfik, excavated in 1975-1978. "Of the 141 excavated tombs, 114 belong to EB II (and some to EB III); we thus far have found the burials of the later phases of Demircihiiytik, from phase L on. The earlier burials still have to be located. "Most of the burials are in pithoi with rims facing southeast (fig. 21). The bodies are contracted. The pithoi are closed with stones, large sherds, or complete vessels. There are also some cists and a series of simple inhumations. Tomb gifts consist of pottery, mostly pitchers, and metal items: copper beads, rings, pins with various tops; knobbed diadems of copper, silver, and gold, lead beads and vessels, and some substantial copper weapons: a crescent-shaped axe (fig. 22) and a knobbed macehead (fig. 23).

"Nineteen pithos-graves (fig. 24) and cist-graves are of MB date and probably belong to the Karum-pe- riod-Old Hittite settlement on the east slope of De- mircihuiyiik. Almost all of these tombs were robbed. We found bracelets and earrings of bronze, lead rings, and various pottery vessels. Seven tombs under large rock piles probably are of IA date; there is also a Roman pit-grave. "The Sariket cemetery has already yielded many objects, especially of metal, that are lacking among the settlement finds of Demircihiiytik. This shows that the study of the necropolis is essential to the cultural understanding of the site." Troy. The new excavations, Manfred Korfmann reports, continue in the expanded and extended deep Schliemann trench from squares D/3 to D/9 and be- yond. The stratification of the building and fortifica- tion levels of Troy I is being analyzed, especially with regard to the sequence of Troy I fortification walls at the south side of the original citadel. The stratigraphic situation in the east scarp of Schliemann's deep trench shows that the levels of I continue much higher than expected. A stone cist in this scarp in D/4 is scheduled for further investigation. The pinnacle area E/4-5 was taken down to the burnt walls of megara IIA and IIB, separated by a 43-cm wide alley found filled with burnt mudbrick tumble. The expert workmanship of the construction as recorded by D6rpfeld came out in the preserved sections of the walls with the beam-beddings clearly visible in the impressions in the mortar; both longi- tudinal beams and crossbeams are measurable in the burnt mudbrick sections standing firmly in situ. The Fig. 24. Demircihuiyuik. Middle Bronze Age burial. floors of megara IIA and IIB will be cleaned in 1991. Over the ruins, after leveling of the two simulta- neously burnt megara, a makeshift structure had been erected with mudbrick walls and wooden floor; it also burned down and contained a good inventory of re- storable pottery. The extension of the long trench in D/7 is exploring the succession of fortifications and possible presence of houses outside of the citadels of I and II. In D/9, the wall face of the VI fortification was excavated down to its foundations. The Troy II gate and paved ramp FM are being investigated and newly drawn in detail. New drawings of the Troy VI citadel wall are also being made in addition to the computerized recording of the topog- raphy of Troy, which is making excellent progress. This extends to the lower city to the south and east, as well as to Theater A. Magnetometric surveying is carried out in selected areas, as are deep geomor- phological soundings by Ilhan Kayan who worked to the north and south of Troy in 1990. The sanctuary area in A-B/8 was cleaned by ar- chaeologists from the University of Cincinnati, and a new trench was opened in H/17 in the lower city, where Roman habitation and industrial activities came to light in continuation of trenches made in I-K/17 previously. This area is to be explored in depth to study the earlier levels down to the potential lower city of Troy VI. The news that the "treasures" of the Schliemann collection in Berlin are not lost but stored in Russia among other collections removed from Germany at the end of World War II is basically reassuring. One can hope that negotiations will lead to a speedy res-</page><page sequence="15">1992] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ANATOLIA 133 urrection of this important material, which will need careful treatment by conservators and a modern an- alytical publication, after the initial conscientious list- ing by Hubert Schmidt in Heinrich Schliemann's Sammlung trojanischer Altertilmer (Berlin 1902). For interim reports see IstMitt 39 (1989) 307-13 and Troica I (forthcoming). Miletus. A prehistoric deposit found under Her- oon III in 1983-1984 is discussed by H. Parzinger in IstMitt 39 (1989) 415-31. It consists of habitation debris with sherds of Late Chalcolithic and EB I type and some obsidian. This material corroborates indi- cations from west of the bouleuterion, IstMitt 32 (1982) 30-41, and from Killiktepe, IstMitt 33 (1983) 5-14. The closest parallels for the Late Chalcolithic sherds are from the Dodecanese and Emporio IX- VII. Arslantepe-Malatya. Marcella Frangipane reports that she expanded the work in the southwest part of the mound where the upper EB III settlement has large, multiroomed buildings. Below this EB IIIB level comes a level with a large number of round structures sunk ca. 50 cm into the subsoil. These lie on terraces and belong to two different phases. A late example is elliptical in shape, with steps leading down to the plastered floor at one end. No material was found in situ that could explain the special purpose of these round structures, which average 3.5 m in diameter. Below them lies a large building with stone foundations, set on terraces. The pottery here is of LB IIIA painted type. In an area 30 m to the north, near the top of the western side of the mound, the Late Chalcolithic de- posit lies at a high level. Mudbrick walls stand on stone socles. One wall had geometric patterns painted in red and black on a white plaster, similar to the wall paintings found in building IV of period VIA, EB I. The dating of the newly found building is determined by the pottery of Late Chalcolithic type, period VII: conical bowls, reddish bottles, basins, beakers, and andirons. A long room had large and medium-sized vessels, grinding stones, bone items, and spindle whorls. A mudbrick column stump stood on the floor of a side-room, coated with mud plaster. For the 1989 campaign see Symposium 12:1 (1990) 209-23. Utepe. This mound, 50 km southeast of Diyar- baklr, is being systematically investigated by Veli Sevin. In 1990, Roman, Hellenistic, and Iron Age levels were explored, and a sounding on the east slope reached a Middle Bronze mudbrick building on stone foundations; one of its corridors contained large stor- age vessels and other pottery, including a painted Khabur-type vase. Harran. In 1990, further samples of the stamped bricks from the Sin temple were found reused in the Islamic level, Nurettin Yardimci reports. In Sympos- ium 12:2 (1990) 363-78 the relevant text is given by Veysel Donbaz; Research Symposium 8 (1990) 401-404 reports on a survey of mounds in the Harran area. Van-Dilkaya. Altan Qilingiroglu reports that his 1990 excavations again found a sequence of Medieval, Iron Age, and Early Bronze Age levels. The EB levels contain typical Early Transcaucasian pottery. The up- per EB level was ruined by conflagration. In the cem- etery nine Urartian cremations were excavated; some of the inhumations are also Urartian. Reports ap- peared in Symposium 12:1 (1990) 27-76 and Hiyiik 1 (1988) 71-74. Bayburt Area: Biiyiiktepe. In 1990, A. Sagona started excavations at Buiyuiktepe in the BeSpinar val- ley ca. 35 km southwest of Bayburt. This site was selected after an extensive survey of this northeastern Anatolian region in the Gimuithane district. Buyuk- tepe has Hellenistic occupation on its southern hill. A sample of EB architecture was found on an outcrop. Here the pottery is of Early Transcaucasian type, handmade and partly burnished, beige to black mot- tled and with some spiral decoration in relief. For the survey see Research Symposium 7 (1989) 425-33. Elazig Area. Veli Sevin discusses the early Iron Age as well as Transcaucasian pottery found in the Euphrates-Keban and Elazig area. The Iron Age ware is handmade or slowly turned, with a thick dark red or brown slip and parallel horizontal grooves on rim and shoulder. This ware has no connection with the preceding LB wares and may be connected with the Mu'ki, Sevin proposes. These would have come in from northern Iran in the early Iron Age. See Hoyiik 1 (1988)51-64. Transcaucasia. Problems of EB Transcaucasian and east Anatolian chronology and migration are dis- cussed by J. Yakar in Erlsr 21 (1990) 94-99. EUPHRATES AND TIGRIS AREA, SALVAGE EXCAVATIONS Tille. David H. French reports that the last season at this strategic site near a Euphrates crossing yielded further precision in the analysis of the burnt level, which is now interpreted as indeed marking the end of the LB period but dated somewhat later than usual, the gate and the fortress having been destroyed ca. 1100 B.C. This interpretation is supported by den- drochronological readings. Below the burnt level, other well-preserved building remains existed. Exca- vations in the northwest area of the mound yielded a sequence of over 12 levels. The upper ones (1-3) contained flat wheelmade plates also found in the</page><page sequence="16">134 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 96 burnt level; 4-8 were poorly preserved; 9-12 had the best-preserved architecture; the pottery combined handmade chaff-tempered wares with wheelmade fine wares. For 1989 see Symposium 12:1 (1990) 311- 23. Degirmentepe and Ikiztepe, Malatya. The 1989 salvage excavations of Ikiztepe on the edge of the Karakaya Dam flood zone, 25 km northeast of Malat- ya, are reported on by Ufuk Esin and SavaS Harman- kaya in Symposium 12:1 (1990) 325-44. Ubaid material was well represented; an earlier level resem- bles Amuq B.

Manfred Behm-Blancke discusses the Uruk-style cone mosaics and inlays that came to light in Hassek H6yiik as an indicator of special con- tact. Very important is the use of mosaic inlays of animals (bulls) and the corner pieces imitating cone inserts, IstMitt 39 (1989) 73-83. Cone mosaics also existed at Samsat. Mosaics can still be rescued at Sadi Tepe north of Carchemish, on the west bank of the Euphrates. Karababa Basin: Kurban Hoyiik. The rescue ex- cavations and surveys sponsored by the Oriental In- stitute, University of Chicago, in 1980-1984 in the region of Kurban H6yiik on the Euphrates have now led to major publications, under the general title of Town and Country in Southeastern Anatolia. Volume I is by T.J. Wilkinson, Settlement and Land Use at Kurban H6yiik and Other Sites in the Lower Karababa Basin (OIP 109, 1990); volume II is by G. Algaze ed., The Stratigraphic Sequence at Kurban Hiiyiik (OIP 110, 1990). These volumes will be major tools in the anal- ysis of the prehistoric development of settlement, economy, and technical development of sites in south- east Anatolia from the Chalcolithic to the end of the Bronze Age. Birecik-Carchemish Area. Guillermo Algaze and his team in 1990 studied the materials from the 1989 survey: "Early Neolithic settlements were relatively large (6-7 ha). Teleilat H6yuik is of PPNB date and must be excavated. In Late Chalcolithic, Amuq F sites are few and small, but Hacinebi Tepe is the main fortified site. Sites attesting to Uruk colonization are Tiladir Tepe across the river from Carchemish (not threatened by flooding) and the threatened sites of Kum Ocagli (almost totally destroyed by a gravel quarry), Komegli, and Sadi Tepe (damaged by stone quarrying). "Sites in this area increase dramatically in number in the beginning of MB, and Tiladir Tepe opposite Carchemish has a large building, facing this dominant city. After the Iron Age, Zeugma-Apamea takes over from 333 B.C. through the Roman period. Zeugma will be destroyed by the planned Birecik Dam." Tigris Area. Guillermo Algaze and his team com- pleted a third season of archaeological and geomor- phological exploration of the Tigris and its tributaries above the planned Cizre and Ilisu dams. "In 1990, the Garzan river basin was surveyed over a zone 40 km north of its confluence with the Tigris. A total of 42 mounds and sites was recorded. The earliest sites are of the Aceramic Neolithic period. Chalcolithic sites with Ubaid and Amuq F type pottery were few and insubstantial; no evidence was found for Halaf- period settlement. EB and MB ceramics were not positively identified. The apparent absence of EBA and MBA occupations along the Garzan closely par- allels the results of our investigations in the Batman and Bohtan river valleys. A small number of IA sites were located. Hellenistic-Parthian ceramics were iden- tified at a single site. Many Garzan sites produce a variety of brown- and red-washed pottery that is al- most certainly of Late Roman-Byzantine date. Similar dense occupation is attested in the Batman area, but not in the Bohtan zone." The survey of the Bohtan river basin was completed over its lower 20 km. Giizir H6ytik is an Aceramic Neolithic mound curving around a small lake fed by a tributary of the Bohtan. Some 3-4 m of deposition could be observed in the profile facing the lake. Of the chipped stone, only 3% was obsidian. "A second Parthian relief was found on the eastern side of the Tigris only a few kilometers upstream from the future emplacement of the Ilisu Dam. The relief is situated by the side of the rock-carved north-south route and depicts a reclining human figure next to a bird on a pedestal, and a standing figure, wearing Parthian trousers. The relief has three panels of in- scription (Aramaic or Parthian)." An extensive report on the 1989-1990 seasons of exploration in the Tigris and Euphrates (Birecik-Car- chemish) areas will appear in Anatolica 1991. For an interim report see Research Symposium 8 (1990) 137- 61. C. Lightfoot reports in AnatSt 40 (1990) 19-24 on the 1989 survey. METALLURGY Nigde-Galtepe. Asllhan Yener is investigating the Kestel mine and the workshop site of G6ltepe, 2 km away on a hill at 1767 masl. A stone enclosure wall was found to protect the site, which has a deposit of ca. 1-2 m. The workshops are partly of wattle-and- daub, attested by burnt debris. Ground stone poun- ders, querns, and mortars are very common. Other finds are crucibles and pottery related to the EB II</page><page sequence="17">1992] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ANATOLIA 135 Konya plain lug-ware (also known from the Darbogaz cemetery north of the Cilician Gates), which suggests that the operations date to the pre-Akkadian period. The Kestel mine will be investigated in more detail in 1991 to determine how much tin could have been extracted here in the third millennium, and by which methods. For a preliminary article see Lynn Willies, Bulletin of the Peak District Mines Historical Society 11:2 (1990) 91-96; for other points of view see com- ments by J.D. Muhly et al. in E. Pernicka and G.A. Wagner eds., Archaeometry '90 (Basel 1991) 209-21. Hassek Hoyiik. Chemical analysis of 75 copper objects from Hassek H6yuik (in the flood zone of the Euphrates dams) revealed that objects from the Uruk and EB I-II periods contained no tin alloy, while arsenic and nickel occurred, probably as impurities in the copper ore and not as alloys. Lead isotope analysis suggests that one of the major sources of copper remained a constant supplier in the Uruk and EB I periods. A study will be published by S. Schmitt- Strecker, F. Begemann, and E. Pernicka in IstForsch. Troy-Poliochni. The same authors, with A.P. Gri- manis, investigated metal objects from Poliochni's Blue to Yellow phases. Tin-bronze is prominent in the Yellow period, replacing the unalloyed or arseni- cal copper of previous phases used in the Troy I era. Provenance studies point to Siphnos and Laurion for some of the silver and lead objects from Poliochni, but other sources are also likely. Copper ores from central Anatolia and the eastern Pontic region become prominent in the Troy II phase; see OJA 9 (1990) 263-98. A. Yener, I.L. Barnes, E. Joel, and E. Sayre report on lead isotope ratios of silver specimens from Troy, Uluburun, and other sites. The results point to a mixture of sources, both Anatolian and Aegean; see Archaeometry Symposium 6 (1990) 87-96. Malatya Region. Arsenical copper ores are not native in this area, according to a report by Claudio Caneva, Kemal Sertok, and Alberto Palmieri in Ar- chaeometry Symposium 6 (1990) 1-11. DENDROCHRONOLOGY Peter I. Kuniholm reports that the Aegean Den- drochronology Project now has a 1,503-year contin- uous tree-ring chronology, estimated to extend from ca. 2250 to 750 B.C. on the basis of radiocarbon determinations. The series is formed by samples from the Kiltepe and Acemhdytik palaces, Karah6yik- Konya, Porsuk, Gordion (especially the tumulus at Klzlarkaya dug in 1989, see below), and Greek sites. Samples from Troy I give a 278-year chronology. A report appeared in Archaeometry Symposium 6 (1990) 127-38. MINOAN AND MYCENAEAN SITES AND FINDS Ka?-Uluburun. In 1990, Cemal Pulak reports, the cleaning of the 14th-century B.C. shipwreck's upper slope area was completed. Downslope a mass of en- crustation yielded lead fishnet weights, bronze and hematite pan-balance weights, bronze cauldron straps, a spearhead and a chisel, faience and agate beads, ostrich eggshell fragments, ebony logs, Mycen- aean and Cypriot pottery, and a faience scarab with the cartouche of Tuthmosis I. The lifting of copper ingots, consolidated under water, continued with 50 more raised. The total count is now estimated at 250 oxhide ingots. Tin ingots were numerous: over a dozen quarter-ingots, two complete oxhide ingots, and two rectangular slab-ingots, the latter with holes at their centers. Further downslope, at a depth of 175-185 ft, more spillage material was recovered. The ship's hull has been left in situ, to be studied after further removal of the cargo (especially ingots and stone anchors). For interim reports see Symposium 12:1 (1990) 293-310; INA Newsletter 17:4 (1990) 8- 13. Panaztepe. Armagan Erkanal reports that sound- ings revealed a harbor settlement of the third and second millennia B.C. on the southeast slope and coast of Panaztepe. This was covered by alluvial soil. A sounding down to bedrock revealed walls, postholes, and EB pottery of local manufacture. The second- millennium ware, including Mycenaean, is also locally made. Buff four-handled jars and carinated jars of cooking-pot ware are typical. On the acropolis, below fourth-century B.C. buildings, lies the citadel of the second millennium B.C. A second necropolis was found to the northwest of the citadel; it has pithos- graves and a tholos built with a small dromos. From the latter came a black stamp seal with some kind of signs. The pithoi contain cremations and inhuma- tions. Interim reports are found in Hiyiik 1 (1988) 37-42 and TTKongresi 10:1 (1990) 139-46. Two scar- abs from the pithos-burials in Panaztepe (one of Amenophis III) are discussed by B. Jaeger and R. Krauss in MDOG 122 (1990) 153-56. Ephesus. Selahattin Erdemgil, Director of the Ephesus Museum, reports that new soundings near the basilica of St. John (Ayasoluk) yielded prehistoric material of EB to LB date. Initial discoveries are a Mycenaean wall dated by associated pottery, and buff and reddish wares with distinctive second-millennium profiles and shapes. The soundings will be continued. In the Artemisium, Anton Bammer reports that below the clay floor of the peripteral temple of ca. 750-700 B.C. a series of constructions and deposits descends through Protogeometric and Submycen-</page><page sequence="18">136 MACHTELD J.

Taner Tarhan continued work on the citadel of Van. The terrace in front of the rock-cut Menua chamber was completely cleared; the cutting for a stele was found in the small platform east of the entrance. In the upper citadel area, below two Otto- man levels, an impressive Urartian wall came to light, its ashlar masonry preserved to 2.2 m height in three courses. The mound ca. 70 m to the north of the citadel was probed further in soundings both of Urartian and EB levels. Reports on the citadel and mound appeared in Symposium 12:2 (1990) 429-56 and Hiyiik 1 (1988) 65-70. Ayanlm. This fortress, 32 km north of Van, is built on a natural rocky hill overlooking the lake. Altan Qilingiroglu started excavations in 1989. The fortifi- cations on the south side are built of rusticated an- desite ashlar of fine workmanship; so far a length of 15.6 m has been exposed. The blocks are set on bedrock. In the west part of the citadel the founda- tions of a temple are coming to light. Arrowheads, bullae with seal impressions, and Urartian tablets are among the inventory of the citadel. NEO-HITTITE AND PHRYGIAN SITES Karatepe.

Young in the 1950s. A small Fig. 25. Gordion. Gate sounding, lower ramp floor cut by water channel. trench was dug against the south wall, not far from the southeast corner. Evidence for two separate phases in the history of the passageway emerged. What appears to have been the original ramp, at about the level of the top of the wall's foundation, consists of rough, laid stones and slopes slightly downward to the east. The upper surfaces of the stones had been worn smooth, as though from foot traffic. At some later time, the original ramp was covered over for the installation of the cobbled ramp, about 1 m higher and with a steeper gradient to the east. The later operation included the laying of a large, subterranean water channel that runs parallel to the south wall of the gate, about 1 m from its face. Figure 25 shows a cover slab of the water channel under the meter stick; in the upper right corner and lower front edge are remnants of the original ramp disturbed by the water channel. The rubble foundation of the gate wall ex- tends about 0.7 m north from the face. This wall face was covered with a fine mud plaster in its first stage; the plaster still adheres to the lower three courses of the wall buried when the cobbled ramp was laid (fig. 26).</page><page sequence="19">1992] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ANATOLIA 137 OWE- i:-- i---i r J Fig. 26. Gordion. South wall of gate with original plaster, rubble foundations. "Within the area of the citadel, the clearance of a Middle Phrygian cellar was completed and produced numerous bronze and iron artifacts as well as loom- weights and spindle whorls." Robert Henrickson is investigating the problem of ceramic continuity and discontinuity at Gordion, es- pecially from the Hittite to the Phrygian period. He kindly reports: "The Late Bronze Age assemblage at Gordion consisted of a limited number of mass-pro- duced, standardized, simple vessel types made in well- fired buff wares. This is very similar to the Late Hittite assemblage at Bogazk6y as documented by A. Mfiller- Karpe, not only in typology but also in methods of production (such as use of the potter's wheel) and production sequences for specific vessel types. "The appearance of early Iron Age handmade ware marks a complete break with the LB pottery tradition. In well-stratified contexts, such as floor deposits in the small pit-houses (Symposium 12:1 [1990] 464, fig. 4) or associated surfaces, this ware is found alone. The simple shapes are highly variable, handmade in a gritty paste and low-fired to a dark gray to dark brown color, and probably the product of individual households. The organization underlying the LB mass-production of pottery, and the entire LB assem- blage itself, had disappeared. This early Iron Age handmade ware has parallels to material from Thrace and other parts of southeastern Europe. "In the following stratigraphic phase, sealed under courtyard surfaces associated with Early Phrygian monumental architecture, a wattle-and-daub house (AJA 95 [1991] 138, fig. 13) yielded an assemblage that is typologically Early Phrygian, yet earlier than any previously known (AJA 95 [1991] 138, fig. 14). This pottery is typologically and technologically un- related to early Iron Age handmade ware. The prep- aration and choice of the clay, forming methods and sequences, and relative standardization of shapes and sizes suggest a simple form of workshop rather than household production of pottery, a trend culminating in the full return to mass-production by specialist potters well before the destruction level that ends the Early Phrygian period. The early Iron Age handmade ware is thus distinct from both the LB and Early Phrygian ceramic traditions." A study by Henrickson will appear in the Proceedings of the conference on the Iron Age held at Van in 1990. Reports appeared in Symposium 12:1 (1990) 455- 70 and in Gordion Excavations, Final Reports III: Ann C. Gunter, The Bronze Age (Philadelphia 1991).

Marc Waelkens reports: "After five years of survey and a rescue excavation in the potter's quarter, large-scale excavations started in 1990. A late Hellenistic fountain house with partly preserved large limestone roof slabs had two side wings, a Doric por- tico, and drawing basin. The date is probably first century B.C. Behind the fountain house, along the northern edge of a paved square, the front of a 13.5-m wide public building was excavated, which may have been a basilica. "The Doric temple of the later second or early first century B.C. was studied for restoration and the area in front excavated. "One trench in the northwest sector of the potter's quarter, east of the theater, exposed a vaulted tomb built ca. A.D. 200 as a family tomb and used or reused in the fourth century. The second trench revealed a large pottery dump with nearly three tons of rejected pottery of the first century A.C. Below this are cre- mation urns containing perhaps victims of Alexan- der's victory over Sagalassus in 334 B.C."

Gutter, Heroen, Herrscher in Lykien (Vienna 1990) is the catalogue of a Lycian exhibition held in Vienna in 1990 to celebrate the Austrian and international archaeological enterprise in Lycia on the initiative of Jirgen Borchhardt and with the collaboration of many excavators, historians, linguists, and Byzantinists. The volume is a rich rec- ord of excavation and interpretation, elegantly pre- sented and a declaration of love for the land of Lycia. Limyra. The sections on Limyra in the Viennese volume include models of the heroon and the Ptole- maion and a polychrome restoration of the west frieze of the heroon, a challenge to the art historical imagi- nation. Borchhardt continued his work in 1990, with special attention to the reconstruction of the roof of the Ptolemaion and the stratigraphy to the west of the naos. Attempts were made to free the colonnaded north-south street of Limyra, 8.2 m wide, from the ground water that covered it. Xanthos. For a report on the 1989 season see Sym- posium 12:2 (1990) 75-80.

Boubon. Jale Inan worked at the site of Boubon in the Cibyratis to study and put in order the Sebasteion from which the bronze statues were removed by rob- bers in the 1960s. The inscribed bases, though dis- turbed, remain in the building; Inan is determining the original arrangement and tracking down the fate of the statuary. Balboura. J.J. Coulton carried out a survey in the territory of Balboura in 1988, and in 1990 conducted a systematic survey of sherds from the Hellenistic and Late Roman upper city.

An earlier discussion of the Datga production centers by Tuna can be found in TTKongresi 10:1 (1990) 347-71. Knidos. Ramazan Ozgan continued work at Kni- dos, where several buildings were recorded in coop- eration with the German Archaeological Institute, e.g., the large altar of Apollo on the middle terrace on the west side and the small altar in front of the round temple of the upper terrace. The round temple itself is to be reconstructed as a Corinthian tholos on the basis of several fragments of columns and archi- trave; the tholos had a cella. Both the Apollo altar and the tholos date to the second century B.C. For the 1989 campaign see Symposium 12:2 (1990) 57-67.

The work at Nysa, under Vedat Idil and Vural Sezer, in 1990 concentrated on the gymnasium and on conservation work in the theater. Aphrodisias. The work at Aphrodisias will con- tinue with research and publication under the direc- tion of R.R.R. Smith, from whose report on the 1990 season I quote: "Theater: Detailed analysis of the stage-facade shows that it was an elaborate three-storied structure with an aediculated marble facade. It was designed to carry a grand display of statues, many of which sur- vive: portraits, muses, Victories, and others. The ded- ication tells us that it was built in the 30s B.C. by Zoilos; it is one of the earliest such facades known. "Tetrapylon: Restoration work begun in 1983 was carried out with an unusually high proportion (85%) of the original elements. Even the fine carving of the recessed baroque pediment with its vigorous, animal- inhabited foliage is nearly fully preserved. The Tetra- pylon was reerected on a thick new foundation of concrete. All the elements were bored vertically to hold steel rods that pass from deep in the concrete foundations to the entablature, as a strong but flexible hidden armature. "Portico of Tiberius: The excavation of the long pool continued toward the east end. The possible functions of this pool and its hydraulic features were studied. The construction belongs to the first or early second century, but its exact purpose remains unclear. "A head excavated in 1968 was found to join the Fig. 27. Didyma.

The excavations of 1990 were directed by W. von Graeve, who reports that the courtyard house found on the south slope of Kalabaktepe in 1989 was completely excavated. Both pis6 and mudbrick were used for the walls on stone foundations. The fortifi- cation wall has an outer face of large gneis blocks; the inner face has a mudbrick packing. Stratified pottery and small finds continued to be prolific. A research excavation on Zeytintepe led to the dis- covery of an Archaic sanctuary. A 7-m stretch of foundation and a limestone paving contain consider- able spolia of marble and poros. Among the finds were a marble volute-palmette akroterion, a terracotta kouros head of ca. 7-cm height, and other terracottas with traces of paint. A base of a small votive figure has a dedication to Aphrodite (first half of the sixth century B.C.) and a later dedication also refers to this goddess. Didyma. K. Tuchelt reports that the excavations of 1989 and 1990 have clarified the topography of the sanctuary northwest of the Apollo Temple. "The sa- cred road has now been cleared for 200 m. The northwest area had Archaic votive offerings; illus- trated here are two Ionic capitals (fig. 27) and a bronze griffin head (fig. 28). "In 1990, excavation continued on the slope of the middle sector west of the Artemis sanctuary (fig. 29, see the plan in AA 1989, 218, square XLV). Preserved are foundations of large buildings that had been de- molished in antiquity. The pottery dates from the second century B.C. to the first century A.C. Isolated Fig. 29. Didyma.

"In the grid squares XLVI-XXXVI (AA 1989, 218), where the sacred road approaches the temple area, the roadway now is exposed from its eastward turn as far as the modern road with its paving and curbs (fig. 30). The overlying fill dated the final use to the seventh century A.C. The roadway widens to 6 m in the bend and continues with a width of 5 m toward the temple. East of the bend is a structure (Southeast Building) with limestone ashlar foundations and base course, measuring 6.3 x 6.3 m, perhaps an altar (fig. 31). A long ashlar retaining wall follows the northeast slope. Two wells in this area were used until the sixth or seventh century A.C. The ashlar construc- tions coexisted with the sacred road of period II (second century B.C. to first century A.C.) and I (Trajanic); they were abandoned and built over in the course of the fourth to sixth centuries A.C. "Under the Trajanic paving in the east sector no earlier road surfaces came to light. To the east the road stops suddenly without clues to the existence of a gate or other closure. Apparently the Trajanic street led to the open zone whose surfaces were earlier noted under and south of the modern road near the sacred grove west of the Apollo temple. In the Trajanic period, then, the course of the sacred road was al- tered. The structures in the middle sector veer more to the west, presumably in line with the earlier course of the road as it aimed for the lower ground west of the temple. The procession could have gone through the sacred grove and the so-called stadium in the south area to continue eastward." A splendid summary of the archaeological work at Didyma and the progress of the new excavations is presented by Tuchelt in AntW 22 (1991) Sondernum- mer, with excellent illustrations in drawings, plans, and photographs.

Orhan Bing6l is studying the con- struction phases and size of the theater. In 1990 the plan of the orchestra was established and a beginning was made with reconstruction. Work continued on a gate building where in 1989 a capital with the figures of Scylla, Nereids, and Tritons above a series of acan- thus leaves had come to light; see Symposium 12:2 (1990) 105-17, and W.

Excavations of 1982-1988 in the Artem- isium are reported upon by Anton Bammer in AnatSt 40 (1990) 137-60 with a detailed analysis of the pe- ripteral temple, the cella of which is Hogarth's Temple B. The peripteros of 8 x 4 columns has bases of green schist and measures 13.5 x 8.4 m. It dates to the Late Geometric period and is preceded by earlier construc- tions and deposits, including Early Geometric, Pro- togeometric, as well as Submycenaean and Mycenaean pottery. The various deposits associated with the pe- ripteros and its successors continue to yield samples of votives especially of the seventh century B.C., e.g., in 1990, a small gold griffin head finial with granu- lation and a belt with curved hook and fibula-handle, of Phrygian-Chiote type. Work along the east stoa of the lower agora, Lang- mann reports, revealed further walls of the Archaic and Geometric period. At a depth of 5 m below the Roman floor level the Archaic city emerges, but the ground water problem makes excavation difficult. In the western half of the court an Archaic road is flanked by tombs. Among the new sculptural discoveries is a relief of Helios as a charioteer, belonging to the Parthian mon- ument; in the frieze Helios moves from the right, Selene from the left, with Lucius Verus in the center. For the monument, see Dieter Knibbe in Oster- reichisches Archtiologisches Institut, Berichte und Mater- ialien 1 (1991) 5-18. In the same volume Isabelle Benda reports on Geometric and Archaic pottery from the agora soundings. Pottery from the Artem- isium is published by Anna Gasser, Die horinthische und attische Importheramik vom Artemision in Ephesos (Ephesos XII.1, 1990).

Klaros. Juliette de la Geniere reports on annual progress with the clearance of the temples and altars, and on stratigraphic soundings in the sanctuary. Study of the colossal statue fragments now has brought together the (still headless) statue of Leto from the group with Apollo and Artemis. Four new soundings were made in 1990. Between the temple and the altar of Apollo, four rows of blocks with iron rings, a total of ca. 70 blocks of this kind, have been recognized as places to which sacrificial animals were attached. The same sounding descended to fifth-century B.C. levels with many terracottas, most of which represent Apollo with his lyre. East of the Apollo altar the corner of an earlier, probably fifth-century B.C., altar came to light. A sounding between the altar and the facade of the Artemis temple revealed a succession of walls and floors of the second to fourth century B.C. On the north side of the (second-century B.C.) Artemis tem- ple a sounding revealed an earlier foundation for the temple, a fifth-century B.C. structure with good in- ventory, and evidence for earlier layers to the seventh century B.C.

Guiven Bakir reports on the various trenches in Hbyiik 1 (1988) 85-96. The principal soundings show a hiatus in habitation from 550/540 to ca. 400 B.C.

They are of limestone and differ from other Aeolic capitals in being fluted in continuation of the upper part of the column shaft, even on the undersides of the volutes. Perhaps these eight capitals came from a stoa. Also found in the area of triangular terraces east of the Athena temple was a bronze cut- out lion found in fallen position, evidently an appli- qud.

In 1990, Crawford H. Greenewalt, jr., re- ports, the main objective was the further exploration of the Lydian fortification wall MMS. The continua- tion to the south of the previously exposed stretch revealed the top of the mudbrick wall just below the modern surface; the wall now has been exposed for a length of ca. 120 m. "Part of the toppled superstruc- ture has been demolished and dumped against the truncated stump during the sack of Sardis by Cyrus the Great. Only one small part of the destruction debris was excavated to its bottom, 6-9 m in depth. The debris consistently is composed of fragmentary and disintegrated brick, partly semi-burnt. Directly under the debris and resting on ancient ground sur- face is a dense layer of carbonized timbers. "The 6-9 m high preservation of the fortification wall stops at the modern highway, which in the 1950s cut through all ancient features. To the north of the highway, the Roman avenue had leveled older con- struction. Many Roman phases of construction were discovered below the avenue, and 300 ft2 of mosaic paving had to be lifted in the process of excavating down to the Lydian level, which came to light with fine limestone masonry, probably part of a gate. The gate passage, marked by gravel surfaces of a Lydian road, was unsymmetrical in design (fig. 32). "The top of the Lydian stratum that contains a residential complex east of the fortification was ex- posed near the south end excavated in 1990, presum- ably similar to the burnt houses found in 1984-1986 further north. Artifacts included a fair amount of good quality imported pottery, e.g., Attic black-figure sherds.</page><page sequence="26">144 MACHTELD J.

Wolfgang Radt reports on the 1990 campaign: "The habitation area around the Late Byz- antine Chapel (AJA 95 [1991] 148, fig. 27) was inves- tigated in depth. Fifty-four additional Late Byzantine tombs came to light to the east and south of the chapel; some of the tombs antedate the chapel (fig. 33).

"A Hellenistic-Roman house plan with peristyle court, partly cleared in 1988, now was completed with a western boundary wall (fig. 34). A staircase presum- ably led down from the street at the northwest corner of the house. The major rooms west of the peristyle were remodeled in Roman times. To the northwest was an early Roman industrial installation with basins and cisterns (tannery?). "The Archaic city-wall came to light after removal of the Late Byzantine tombs (fig. 35), first as a mass of rubble, then in careful clearance and section (fig. 34, KP = Kontrollprofil), with three faces stag- gered on the slope and a rubble core. Soundings to bedrock yielded ceramic evidence that the wall is of Archaic date, especially in the form of Aeolic gray ware of the seventh century B.C. The outer, lowest face of the wall (A in fig. 36) forms a low terrace at the base of the wall. The second face B, set slightly uphill, has the best masonry and is evidently the main wall. The third face C is put together casually of boulders and rubble, and seems to function as a re- taining wall and fill uphill; it must have supported the back face of the superstructure of the wall, which has completely eroded. Face A exists only where the ter- rain requires it; in the plan (fig. 34) one notices that it joins the main face of the wall. This projecting reinforcement was mostly found covered by a Helle- nistic wall (fig. 34, at level 216.41), which was also identified further east in 1978-1988 and interpreted as an early Hellenistic access ramp (AA 1989, 389, fig. 2), older than the Hera sanctuary. "Building Z (figs. 37-38), immediately east of the Demeter sanctuary, was investigated following obser- vations made by W. D6rpfeld in 1909. The excavation recorded the Late Byzantine structures built over it and exposed the mosaic room, 7.35 m2 (fig. 39), from under the sloping accumulation. The walls are Hel- lenistic in technique; the stucco decoration of the walls (fig. 40) and the mosaic belong to the Roman period. Among the fallen debris of stucco and tiles near the west wall lay a broken cult vessel with decorated han- dles (fig. 41): heads of Pan, theatrical masks and busts of Dionysos. The mosaic room has a southwest door and a niche in the west wall, and a door as well as a niche on the east side. Building Z is a large complex connected with the Demeter sanctuary. "The mosaic has motifs similar to those of the cult vessel in the central 3 x 3 m field with octagonal panels: comic and tragic masks, heads of Dionysos Fig. 36. Pergamon.

Tomris Bakir reports on her third season of excavation: "The stratification on the mound of Hisartepe shows two destruction levels with conflagration, one associated with the assault of Age- silaos in 395 B.C. and the second with the conquest by Alexander's general Parmenio in 334 B.C., which terminated the satrapy. "Remnants of the satrapal palace that was built in 477 B.C. are coming to light in the form of a well- built stone wall with mudbrick superstructure of 0.9 m width. After the burning of 395 B.C. (Xen. Hell. 4.1.33) the superstructure was rebuilt. The stratifica- tion of the mound has a Roman upper level directly overlying material of the second half of the fourth century B.C., dated by Attic red-figure pottery. Below this is the burnt level of 334 B.C. with mudbrick debris of 0.8 m depth, yielding Attic red-figure and black-glazed wares of the late fifth and early fourth century B.C. of good quality, the tableware of the satraps. "The original floor of the fifth-century palace was found in the next level, with a stone pavement on the exterior to the south, and a clay layer of 8 cm for the interior floor on the north side of the stone wall. Sherds of an Attic kylix by the Komast-Y painter in the construction fill show the wealth of the previous, Lydian era at Daskyleion, a century before the build- ing of the satrapal palace. "The sounding into pre-palace levels went down on a small scale for 1.5 m. From a floor 0.2 m below the palace floor came an Attic kylix with a Phrygian graf- fito, Wana(x), suggesting that Phrygian was used at Daskyleion somehow in the early fifth century B.C., when Megabates was satrap. A lower level yielded floors associated with Attic cups with intentional red glaze and other pottery of 540-530 B.C., notably an Attic column krater; a shoulder fragment of a Phryg- ian vessel with geometric decoration clearly survived from an earlier date. One floor at 2.5 m below the surface had a fragment of an Attic black-figure col- umn krater from the workshop of Lydos with the design of a grazing goat, ca. 560 B.C. The inventory of the buildings in all periods shows prosperity. "In the context of a Tumulus Rescue project, resis- tivity research started at the tumulus Kosemtug. Rob- bers' threatening activities forced a direct start of excavations at Kocah6yuk in precarious circum- stances; with the aid of experts a large cache of ex- plosives prepared for an illegal assault had to be removed during the digging. "The tumulus of Kdsemtug turned out to have been looted in Hellenistic times. We cleared the dromos, which was roofed and 9 m long; burnt ceremonial remains lay in front of the door of the chamber: 84 gilded clay beads in the shape of bud, acorn, and grape, with bronze parts of a necklace. "The chamber was built of carefully worked andes- ite blocks; it measured 3 x 3 m and was roofed in the manner of Thracian vaulted tombs. It had doors and thresholds of marble and a marble column supported a cracked ceiling block. The inner threshold was a reused marble block on which the last four lines of a Phrygian inscription remained. This will be published by R. Gusmani. The inscription is an additional sign of Phrygian activity and presence at Daskyleion, to be explored in further seasons. "The K6semtug tomb has been put under protec- tion and will be restored. Another aspect of Dasky- leion, the paradeisos at Ku? Cenneti on the north side of the lake, has also been looked after by the excava- tors who have persuaded the Forestry Directorate to plant thousands of willow trees along the lake shore."

The circuit wall of the upper town is ca. 2 m thick with a series of small internal buttresses every 3 m or so, which perhaps helped to support a wall-walk.

A small sub-rectangular fort lies inside the sharp southwest angle of the town wall, enclosing an area of ca. 50 x 30 m. A second enclosure exists in the northeast angle of the town wall. "Trench L revealed a Roman street and gateway similar to those of the Medieval period, which may be Selcuk, and there is good Hellenistic and Roman ce- ramic evidence and small finds. "In the lower town, the three-phased circuit wall and tower appear to have a Late Roman context typologically and on the basis of ceramic evidence from outside the walls."
