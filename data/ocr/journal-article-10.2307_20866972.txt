<plain_text><page sequence="1">Into the Wild: Response, Respect, and the Human Control of Canine Sexuality and Reproduction Karla Armbruster I became a mother at thirty-nine, rather late in my reproductive years.1 For most of my adult life up until that point, I had no plans to have children, assuming on some level that motherhood came between women and their higher ambitions, especiallytheirprofessional and intellectual callings. So imagine my horror when I found myself pregnant as a graduate student in my twenties?in a dream. But the sinking feeling that my life was ruined? which I have never forgotten and which resurrected itself briefly during a case of postpartum depression after the birth of my first child?turned to relief when I gave birth to three puppies (one brown and two black) rather than a human baby. "Thank God! I can give these away," I remember thinking. (Of course, I planned to find excellent homes for them.) Somehow, in the course of the dream, I learned that I had become a surrogate for my dog, Annie, who was spayed. A friend suggested that my dream reflected a sense of guilt over Annie's reproductive incapacity. I dismissed this explanation at the time, preferring to think that the dream represented the depth and intimacy of my relationship with my dog. People who worried about the ethics of spaying and neutering pets, I believed, usually did so out of inappropriate identification and anthropomorphism: I wouldn't like to be neutered, and so neither would my pet. (I noticed that this happened most commonly with men who seemed worried about their male pets' testicles.) I had grown up in a semi-rural area where unwanted dogs and cats were regularly abandoned, and many of them seemed to find their way to my family. Our house, we joked, had a secret sign alerting jac 30.3-4(2010)</page><page sequence="2">756 jac them to the presence of animal lovers, much like the cryptic messages that Depression-era hobos reputedly left for each other to indicate the homes of "soft-hearted women." We kept many of the refugees who found their way to us, but at times we had to find other homes for them. I knew from experience how difficult that could be. Annie was one of the dogs who found us. A small beagle mix, she arrived malnourished and flea-infested, clearly terrified, probably with a history of abuse, but also eager for affection. She was also in heat, most likely for the first time, and we speculated that this was why she had been abandoned. We took her in with the intention of finding someone to adopt her, but in the meantime our house became a magnet for all the intact male dogs in the neighborhood. Little Annie wanted nothing to do with any of them, growling, snapping, and biting?not to mention maneuvering to keep her vulnerable parts out of their reach?every time she encountered one of them. But one night I came home, fresh from an evening negotiating the hormone-charged dating and mating rituals of young adult humans, to the traumatizing spectacle of Annie and our family dog, Ramsey, in the process of having sex on the sidewalk leading up to the house. As I stood in shock, only gradually understanding what I was watching, the dogs finished. It was obvious that they wanted to part, but their rear ends were stuck together. Eventually, they managed to face in opposite directions, but their bodies and hind legs were horribly twisted?like a surrealist version of the pushmi-pullyu in Dr. Dolittle. They were clearly miserable. Knowing nothing of the mechanics of dog sex, I could only surmise that something had gone horribly wrong. It felt unnatural, almost like a punishment, and only reinforced the vague notions of sex as sinful that I had picked up from my Catholic education. My shock also reflected the way dog sex has come to stand for sex at its most base in our culture: purely a bodily compulsion, engaged in with no pretensions to love or spiritual ends. Thoroughly a product of this culture, uncomfortable with my own sexuality, I was deeply disturbed by this encounter with what felt like raw sexual instinct. Looking back, I realize that what I witnessed was more than mindless instinct: Annie must have exercised some choice in the affair; if she hadn't felt differently about Ramsey than the other dogs who pursued her, it would never have happened. But at the time I went running</page><page sequence="3">Karla Armbruster 757 into the house and woke up my parents, who called the emergency veterinary clinic. They told us just to wait, though we may have already thrown a bucket of water on the poor creatures. The next day, realizing that Annie could be pregnant, I was concerned only that I might have eight or nine dogs to find homes for rather than one. Within the week, I took her to the vet to be spayed. If there were tiny puppy embryos growing... well, I tried not to think about it, and afterward the vet assured me that there was no sign she had been pregnant. I had never questioned the notion that adopting mutts was the right thing to do; similarly, I accepted the popular wisdom that spaying and neutering them was the only way to prevent overpopulation. (The fact that Ramsey, who had been with my family for some years, was not neutered attests to the fact the wisdom had only recently become popular, in response to a widespread campaign initiated in the 1970s.) I saved my criticism for those who raised and purchased purebred dogs. The desire for a purebred rather than a mutt seemed like a form of elitism to me. And indeed, as I later learned, breeds as we know them evolved in the nineteenth century, in part as a way for Victorians anxious about social mobility to assure them selves?and to display to others?their superior status (Grier 35-45; McHugh, Dog 101). I also felt that providing homes for dogs who needed them?mutts, in almost every case? was ethically preferable to breeding more dogs when there already seemed to be too many. As Donna Haraway puts it in When Species Meet, I was a "true believer in the Church of the Shelter Dog," or at least the Mutt in Need of a Home (96). As I will relate, I have since lost my faith?at least, my faith that there is a way for humans to remain innocent in our relations with dogs, to wash our hands of domination and control over them by choosing mutts and rescue dogs, properly spayed and neutered. I am not denying that the practices that produce purebred dogs are deeply problematic. In fact, breed standards that emphasize appearance over behavior directly undermine dogs' health and autonomy, promoting as ideals qualities that are actually disabilities or deformities. The bulldog's excessively short muzzle often causes breathing problems, for example, and dogs with bulging eyes, like Pekinese and Boston terriers, are particularly prone to eye diseases and inj uries (Hubrecht 180-81; DeMello 83). But even with more sensible standards, closed stud books turn breeds</page><page sequence="4">758 jac into what biologist Raymond Coppinger describes as genetic traps, making inbreeding and the resulting genetic defects almost inevitable (315-16).2 Currently, there are over 350 inherited disorders now known to be associated with particular breeds (DeMello 83). Furthermore, the whole culturally constructed concept of breed?the belief that a name and a certain physical appearance mean something predictable?has led many people to choose certain breeds for questionable reasons,3 while the creation of breed dogs as commodities (with breeds as brands) has fueled the growth of the abusive puppy mill industry. But aren't there parallels between the tight, sometimes deforming human control of breed dog reproduction and the increasingly effective spay/neuter campaigns that prevent mixed breed dogs from reproducing at all? Both are forms of human control over the processes of reproduc tion. However, from an animal welfare perspective, there seems to be at least one very important difference: the reproduction of purebreds is controlled to satisfy human preferences and desires, while the widespread spaying and neutering of mutts (and "pet quality" breed dogs) is practiced for their own good. Without these measures, it seems obvious that even more would die of disease, starvation, or euthanasia in shelters (estimates for this last category are in the millions per year in the U.S.).4 The fact that so many dogs (and other companion animals) are killed in shelters is horrific, and I want to be very clear that I am not advocating a widespread halt to the spaying and neutering that help (and can continue to help) reduce these numbers.5 Despite the concerns I want to raise, it's important to remember that before the widespread availability of surgical options for sterilization, "extra" kittens and puppies were usually drowned (Grier 104); preventing their births is clearly more humane. However, the notion that we spay and neuter purely for the dogs' sake paints us in a more selfless light than is warranted. Is it the only way to prevent "overpopulation" (a subjective concept, to be sure)? As Nathan Winograd points out in Redemption: The Myth of Pet Overpopulation and the No Kill Revolution in America, the fact that there is a market for breed dogs suggests that the problem is not overpopulation; changing preferences about what kinds of dogs we want, and why, could play a major role in putting puppy mills out of business and dramatically reduce euthanasia of dogs in shelters (though Winograd strongly advocates aggressive spay/</page><page sequence="5">Karla Armbruster 759 neuter programs as well). On an individual level, owners are told that spaying and neutering will improve their dogs' health, but scientific evidence does not necessarily bear this out, especially when the proce dures are performed on the animals at an early age (Milani). Claire Palmer points out that spaying and neutering are about more than just preventing reproduction; they are designed to remove the "troublesome sexual concreteness" of our pets and to produce behavioral changes, such as docility and a lessened tendency to roam, that alter the animals to better fit our lifestyles (357). As veterinarian and behaviorist Myrna Milani argues, we should admit that we spay and neuter companion animals for ourselves as much as for them, to spare ourselves the inconvenience of their sexuality and to avoid a deep examination of our cultural preference for breed dogs and the suffering that creates. It seems that an ecofeminist perspective could provide a productive analysis of this widespread control of dogs' sexuality and reproduction. Ecofeminists have led the way in pointing out that many of the same dynamics are at work in the domination of nonhuman animals and the oppression of groups of people, including women, deemed "less than human" by dominant society.6 Lori Gruen, Carol Adams, and Greta Gaard, among others, have specifically addressed technological/cultural control over the bodies of nonhuman animals?in particular the regulation, transformation, and exploitation of the bodies of female animals in industrialized agriculture?as a form of domination and oppression.7 However, there has been little critical attention to our reproductive control of pets, especially the spaying and neutering of mixed breed and "pet quality" purebred dogs.8 Slaves or Companion Species? On the Possibility of Innocence The issue of how to relate to dogs (and other companion species) in a just way is a difficult one. Simply arguing that control should be given back to the beings themselves?as we might suggest in the case of wild nonhuman animals?seems to abrogate our responsibility to the dogs, whose domes tic status means they are dependent on us.9 And human control (or at least influence) over the processes of reproduction is at the heart of what it</page><page sequence="6">760 jac means to be domesticated. This holds true even in the most current theories about the evolution of the dog, in which dogs, in effect, "domes ticated themselves" when wolves congregated around the leavings of human settlements, with those who were least afraid of humans and least aggressive most likely to survive. (Haraway "Cyborgs"; Coppinger). It seems that without even meaning to, humans shaped the nature of the early dog by influencing which individuals would survive and reproduce, and we have exerted more and more intentional control over their survival and reproduction as time has gone on. Given the dependence of their species on ours, it is hard to imagine how we might avoid at least influencing their reproductive processes. For some thinkers, the dependence of domestic animals like dogs upon humans mean they can never be more than slaves.10 There can be no ethical relation to them because they can never be free of human control. As Donna Haraway describes this line ofthought, "Within this frame, only wild animals in the conventional Western sense, as separate as possible from subjugation to human domination, can be themselves" (When Species Meet 207). Though proponents of what Haraway calls the domestication as disaster view do not all go so far as to say we should eliminate domesticated animals, that is the logical conclusion of their arguments (When Species Meet 206). But isn't this the ultimate human hubris: to decide that another species can no longer exist? The notion that domination is the only salient aspect to the existence of domesticated animals diminishes them, reducing them to "merely raw materials or tools" (Haraway, When Species Meet 206). According to Catriona Sandilands, ecofeminism has raised awareness about the importance of including the voice of nature in democratic conversation, applying "principles of equality, self-determination, and even subjectivity to nature as a co conspirator in human activity and as an interdependent actor" (195). Only by leaving domesticated animals out of this conception of an active nature can we justify their elimination.11 And doesn't the notion that domestic animals are a disaster reveal a deep self-loathing on the part of humans: the sense that these species are irrevocably contaminated by our involvement in their development coupled with the belief that we are incapable of a just relationship with them? This deep discomfort with domestic animals and their ill fit on either side of the</page><page sequence="7">Karla Armbruster 761 nature/culture divide merely perpetuates that divide, as Haraway points out. Instead, she suggests, there are other ways to think about domestica tion that do not assume the easy separability of nature and culture or deny domestic animals any agency (When Species Meet 206). As such an alternative, she develops the notion of companion species, a category that encompasses not just domestic animals but also rice, bees, tulips, and intestinal flora?all species that "make life for humans what it is" through a co-constitutive relationship in which the members "make each other up, in the flesh" (Manifesto 15; 2-3). In this view, dogs and humans evolved together, shaping each other in a process that still goes on today (Manifesto 29). Because companion species make each other what they are, she argues, we should focus on relationships as the smallest pattern of analysis, understanding that "none of the partners pre-exist the relating, and the relating is never done once and for all" (Manifesto 12). We "become with" our companion species (When Species Meet 4, 19). Both Haraway and the philosopher Jacques Derrida have emphasized that innocence?the idea that we can somehow escape harming other beings or avoid unequal relations?is a fantasy, based on the questionable assumption that we are "smoothly preconstituted entities" rather than partners in an ongoing, unavoidable dance of relating (Haraway, When Species Meet 287). The belief that we can find some neat, one-size-fits all solution to the dilemma of how to relate to our companion species is similarly suspect, a cowardly dodge that avoids the difficult task of "meeting the other in all the fleshly detail of a mortal relationship," of practicing what Haraway describes as "otherness-in-connection," the tricky business of connecting significantly across irreducible differences (Manifesto 34, 45). This task entails asking the question, "Which historically situated practices of multispecies living and dying should flourish?" and taking responsibility for the answer (When Species Meet 88). Haraway's notion that our interdependence with other species compels us to "response and respect" is a rich one, enabling us to play on the relationship between response and response-ability (When Species Meet 19). Being able to respond, to genuinely make the other the focus of your attention, is an ability that must be developed. And our interrelatedness means it is our responsibility to do so. Response and respect cannot absolve us from</page><page sequence="8">762 jac complicity in the harming and even killing of other creatures, but they do mean taking harm seriously, working to keep "inequality from becoming commonsensical or taken as obviously okay" {When Species Meet 11). For example, like many dog lovers, I thought I had found the path to innocence by adopting mutts from shelters or rescue groups and making sure they were spayed or neutered. Combined with the growing "no kill" movement, this approach seemed to promise a Utopian future for human canine relations, a future without the need for naked acts of control such as stud-book breeding or killing of homeless dogs. However, a recent trend among shelter dogs should make us question this promise. Veteri narian Myrna Milani and trainer and shelter administrator Sue Sternberg have both identified a phenomenon in shelters in the Northeastern U.S.: fewer and fewer dogs with the temperaments to become "nice family pets" can be found, and shelters are shipping in dogs from other parts of the country to meet the demand. While one might interpretthis is a hopeful sign that spay/neuter campaigns are close to eliminating the problem of unwanted pets, Milani and Sternberg see serious problems: the "nice family pets" are being taken out of the breeding pool by the responsible folks who adopt and sterilize them; unadoptable, more aggressive dogs continue to reproduce, eventually filling shelters that hesitate to euthanize them; and people looking for pets turn to breeders and puppy mills. Milani and Sternberg warn that we may be seeing a radical shift in the gene pool of dogs (other than purebreds) in the U.S.12 Breeders of purebreds have no qualms about exerting control over the reproductive processes of dogs, using them to shape dogs for various human ends. Those of us committed to adopting mutts and rescue dogs, dutifully spaying and neutering them, like to believe we are remaining pure of this kind of domination, simply responding to a situation outside of our control. However, Milani and Sternberg's charge suggests that our practices are still shaping the genetics of dogs in general. I would argue that, because dogs are a companion species as Haraway defines it, we cannot avoid affecting them and thus we need to acknowledge what is happening and collectively take responsibility. In response to the potential problem they see in the canine gene pool, Milani and Sternberg suggest that perhaps it is time to start breeding dogs specifically for the role of companion, the "new work" of most dogs today (Katz). On a larger scale,</page><page sequence="9">Karla Armbruster 763 we need to question the naturalization of spaying and neutering as unproblematically the right thing to do and instead recognize it as a massive act of control and domination over our "best friends."13 This does not mean we should stop the practice, but it does mean we should take responsibility for its results on the species, on our individual companion dogs, and on ourselves. How might we better respond to and respect dogs in the matter of their sexuality and reproduction? I suggest we might start by recognizing these processes as wild.14 As I will discuss, wildness is a force that has often been constructed as nature in the extreme, hovering far outside the boundaries of human culture. But wildness transcends these boundaries. While, in our quest for innocence, we have radically suppressed and made invisible much of the wildness that could be expressed by dogs through their sexuality and reproduction, it is still there. And in radically diminishing its opportunities for expression, much is lost. For the dogs, one more opportunity to exercise their own agency and instincts has been denied them, limiting their chances for flourishing. It's true that spaying and neutering, for example, might also contribute to flourishing if they make it possible for a dog to have a good home or prevent the birth of puppies who might not. But we owe it to them to acknowledge the losses as well as the benefits. And what do we lose? A number of thinkers have suggested that dogs and other companion animals that share our lives might be able lead us back into a more intimate relationship with the natural world (Muir; Hoagland; Shumway). But for this to happen, we need to be open to their otherness, their wildness, the very aspects of their lives and behavior that challenge the norms of culture, that surprise us, disgust us, scare us, or (if we let them) energize us and even fill us with wonder. Our lack of tolerance for wildness, our drive to control it, is at the heart of our troubled relationship with the natural world and characterizes some of the most dramatic ways we have intentionally and unintentionally diminished the diversity and health of our planet. As the first domesticated animal, the dog exemplifies the ways the natural world has been irrevocably altered by humanity's existence. And as our closest nonhuman companion, the dog offers us a good place to start transforming our relationship with wildness. To explore how this might be done, I will discuss the way two writers,</page><page sequence="10">764 jac Rhoda Lerman and J.R. Ackerly, recognize, value, and work to accom modate the wildness of their dogs as expressed through the processes of sexuality and reproduction. As Donna Haraway has written, through our ideologically loaded narratives of their lives, animals "hail" us to account for the regimes in which they and we must live. We "hail" them into our constructs of nature and culture, with maj or consequences of life and death, health and illness, longevity and extinction. We also live with each other in the flesh in ways not exhausted by our ideologies. Stories are much bigger than ideolo gies. In that is our hope. (Manifesto 17) Lerman's and Ackerley's stories provide us with this kind of hope, demonstrating ways of living with dogs in the flesh that honor their wildness, sometimes at significant cost to themselves, and in the process forging relationships that attest to the possibility and beauty of responsible otherness-in-connection with companion species. Wildness: Out There and In Here What do I mean by "wildness"? In the Western cultural tradition, wildness has often been viewed quite negatively, equated with the uncivilized, uncultivated, chaotic, violent, and destructive (Snyder 9). As poet and bioregionalist Gary Snyder suggests in The Practice of the Wild, in order to see wildness for what it is, we must turn around many of the old definitions that characterize it by what it is not. Instead of "not tame," for example, we can see wild animals as free agents. We can replace the chaos and disorder we tend to associate with wildness with a sense of a complex, self-organizing order that largely escapes human control or understanding. In this view, the wild brims with energy and surprises, a potential source of both danger and renewal for human beings. It is important to note that Snyder distinguishes wildness from wilderness, a place "where the wild potential is fully expressed, a diversity of living and nonliving beings flourishing according to their own sorts of order" (12). While wilderness may be under siege, wildness remains all around us. Snyder finds it in</page><page sequence="11">Karla Armbruster 765 ineradicable populations of fungi, moss, mold, yeasts, and such that surround and inhabit us... .Exquisite complex beings in their energy webs inhabiting the fertile corners of the urban world in accord with the rules of wild systems, the visible hardy stalks and stems of vacant lots and railroads, the persistent raccoon squads, bacteria in loam and in our yogurt_(14-15) Even the human body is wild, he argues, pointing to the many ways it regulates itself, such as breathing and keeping the heart beating, without conscious intervention. And wildness lurks in "the depths of the mind, the unconscious, . . . where a bobcat is right now" (16). For a Western tradition invested in the dominance of culture over nature, wildness has been deeply threatening. And the concept of wildness, negatively construed, has been used to oppress groups of people seen as closer to nature and animals, such as women and people of color. For example, as Vera Norwood points out in Made from this Earth: American Women and Nature, historically African American women have often been linked to "uncontrolled sexuality and a 'wild nature'" in order to place them outside the boundaries of culture" (174-75). How ever, for environmental thinkers invested in re-valuing nature, wildness holds out the promise of energy and revitalization for humans and human culture. As Thoreau so famously put it, "in Wildness is the preservation of the World" (206). The sense that wildness exceeds our understanding and control is also important for cultivating human humility; as Aldo Leopold explains in "The Land Ethic," recognizing that our knowledge of nature will always be incomplete means changing our role from that of conqueror to plain member and citizen of the land community (240). More recently, Catriona Sandilands, author of The Good-Natured Feminist: Ecofeminism and the Quest for Democracy, has emphasized the ways that wildness exceeds our ability to represent it in human language?a limitation that should certainly provoke humility and a sense of tentativeness when making decisions that affect the natural world (or using ideas about nature to make claims about other things, such as what a particular gender or race is "naturally like"). As she explains, "wildness is unspeakable and calls our attention to the limits of human speech itself. ... It coexists with and participates in human representation; it actively</page><page sequence="12">766 jac shapes the discursive life of nature, yet it cannot be reduced to human creation" (185-86). This means that any representation?of wildness or anything else?is "always already" a misrepresentation, and if we keep that in mind, we will be less likely to succumb to the temptation of thinking we "have it right" and thus to closing down the ongoing conversation crucial for democratic decision-making that includes the perspectives of all entities involved, including nonhuman ones (203). Whether wildness is viewed in these positive ways or in the older, negative ones, it is typically seen as outside or exceeding the boundaries of human culture(s). As philosopher Jack Turner puts it in The Abstract Wild, "Wildness is out there" (125). And yet, as Snyder emphasizes, it's "in here," too. The boundary between nature and culture, human and animal, self and other, the one that divides "out there" from "in here" is, of course, a cultural construction. If we look at the history and changing meanings of the concept of wildness, it becomes clear that it is a construction as well. And yet, all the various shifting constructions of wildness seem to point to something that is bigger than, that exceeds, culture and all its constructions: the force of the material, biological, physical world and its processes, what will go on after we are gone. Humanity is not separate from this force?we participate in it and feel its effects?but we don't understand or control it completely. This notion becomes especially important when we consider Sandilands' claim that wildness is unspeakable. Her analysis, deeply informed by the psychoanalytic theories of Lacan, links wildness to encounters with the Real, the "unrepresentable kernel around which the Symbolic is struc tured" (185). Because our very identities and ways of viewing the world are structured by the Symbolic order, we cannot experience the Real directly once we enter the Symbolic, and it cannot be captured in language. But it affects the structures of language and human thought. It's "out there," but in the traces it leaves in the shape of the Symbolic, it inhabits human culture and language as an absent presence, shaping us in turn. Other thinkers have similarly proposed that language itself is a product of more-than-human forces and thus reflects the nonhuman (rather than distinguishing humans from other animals, as has often been argued in the Western tradition). As Gary Snyder explains, "Language and culture</page><page sequence="13">Karla Armbruster 767 emerge from our biological-social natural existence, animals that we were/ are. Language is a mind-body system that coevolved with our needs and nerves" (17). For Jacques Derrida, the fundamental structuring principles of language "are themselves not only human." (116). Sandilands argues that wildness reveals itself in the moments when we see nature, the earth, animals, and even ourselves as strange and alien, and that "this strange ness, this moment ofthe human linguistic unknowability of nature, must be preserved and fostered" (185). These moments are markers of forces beyond our control and understanding impinging on our lives, our experi ence of the world.15 Wildness will always be more than we can know or say, but we can work to look for its traces and symptoms, to open ourselves up to it. Conversely, when we "sterilize" our canine companions, aren't we violently assimilating their otherness, eliminating opportunities for experi encing wildness and practicing otherness-in-connection? Think about the word "sterilize"?a word we tend not use anymore, no doubt because it gives our intentions away. When we spay and neuter our pets, at least part of what we're doing is making them easier, neater, and less challenging to live with. But perhaps we need those challenges. Sterility does not allow for growth and change?for the wildness of life itself. Looking back, my shock at encountering Annie and Ramsey on the sidewalk that night was a sign that I was in the presence of wildness. The experience?and my reaction to it?could have helped me learn about the wildness in the world around me and inside myself. Opening Up to Wildness: Mutual Transformation in Rhoda Lerman's In the Company of Newfies: A Shared Life Rhoda Lerman's memoir, In the Company of Newfies: A Shared Life, focuses on the powerful relationships she shares with her dogs, relation ships she characterizes as mutually transforming: "I slip the halter of what I've become. They slip the halter of what they've been, and we live together, passionately, changed" (1). This relationship of "becoming with" both enables and is nurtured by Lerman's unusual openness to wildness. And nothing is more wild for Lerman, who breeds and shows her purebred</page><page sequence="14">768 jac Newfoundlands, than her dogs' experience of birth and puppycare, an experience she shares. Of course, this idea that pregnancy, birth, and nursing are wild risks evoking some of the worst essentialist stereotypes associated with ecofeminism. Especially when we 're talking about nonhuman animals, it's easy to lapse into the idea that the experience is somehow an example of unmediated nature working in opposition to the forces of culture. I remember thinking wearily, after the heavily medicalized birth of my first daughter, that I wished I had just crawled into my closet and given birth by myself, as I imagined a dog might do. But, even for dogs, birthing and reproduction in general are culturally mediated. Not only do we decide which dogs may reproduce and with whom, but a number of breeds now need the same types of technological interventions we commonly associ ate with human birth, such as Caesearean sections, because the breed standards have created bodies that can't give birth "naturally." As Jane Brackman describes, the language of breed standards ?culturally con structed and interpreted?exerts a powerful influence on the features valued by purebred dog owners and thus on the reproductive fates of their dogs. So when I say these processes are wild, I mean that they are aspects of nature that exceed (not defy) human control and understanding. In particular, they are manifestations of the wild process of evolution, reflecting a more-than-human wisdom that has developed over time through trial and error. Watching Molly clean her newly born pups, Lerman and her husband stand in awe, whispering to each other: "'How does she know? How does she know?'" (13). Two weeks later, the pups are stronger and moving on their own, following the mandates of something much bigger and older than human culture and knowledge: "The puppies stagger, wobble, tumble, roll slowly, their future lives of action performed at halftime as their dogdom unfolds and becomes. A paw lifts and pushes weakly at a belly. A little body leans against another. The other falls down. Their music is already written. Their bodies know the dance. They are simply answering it, slowly, sleepily" (57). While Lerman values the mystery of the processes at work, she also tries to find points of connection that will help her understand certain perplexing behaviors. In particular, she notices that two of her dogs, Molly</page><page sequence="15">Karla Armbruster 769 and Ishtar, each go to the same spot under the basement stairs and dig a shallow hole after they give birth. Lerman honors the Otherness of her dogs by admitting, "I don't understand," (20) and later proclaiming that "I have stood at the shoulder of Mount Everest, in awe of the earth's thrust to the skies. I stand as awed by the little scratched hole in the basement floor. It has as much power, as much mystery" (22). But she also believes connections can be made across the divide that separates her from the dogs, drawing on her own experiences as a mother to help her understand and hoping that penetrating the mystery of her dogs might "illuminate my own origins, my own instincts, my secret animal self (20). Eventually, worried about losing power in a storm and being without heat for a newly born litter, she remembers wishing she had a bomb shelter for her children during the Cuban invasion in the sixties. And she realizes that Molly and Ishtar, too, were seeking "the safest place, the most distant, darkest, untraveled place they could imagine in case of an emergency," having "crossed their Rubicon" and become mother, caretakers of other beings (22). Despite the way Lerman's experience of motherhood connects her with Molly and Ishtar, she understands that it does not promise an easy understanding?they are still Other, and connections must be worked at, tested against lived realities, and open to question. She always understands that her dogs "are not us, not at all" (70). Her ability to find ways that she and her dogs share experiences without erasing their Otherness leads her to understand her identity as open and malleable, much like the model proposed by Haraway and other poststructuralist and posthumanist thinkers. She writes, "I touch my own double nature, which lies someplace between animal and human, unintegrated, often at odds, going in different directions. I am too aware to be an animal, too far from Eden" (18). In fact, it is this "unintegrated" identity that propels and allows Lerman to strive to change who she is in response to her dogs. As Sandilands writes of Marion Engel's character Lou, who intimately encounters radical wild ness in the person of a bear, the animal's "Otherness .. . propels her to a sense of incomplete selfhood, to a desire to become" (183). "Becoming with" her dogs?stretching the boundaries of the human outwards and tapping into the animality within?is not always easy or comfortable for Lerman. She writes that she and her dogs have "pierced</page><page sequence="16">770 jac each others' worlds" (7); as the word "pierced" suggests, opening up to the wildness of these canine Others is risky and, often, physically uncomfortable, requiring a bodily intermingling as well as a psychological, spiritual one. Sitting in the whelping box with the puppies burrowing against her, Lerman experiences a rare moment of oneness, both with the pups and within herself: "For a brief moment I am their animal and nothing, no one, else. It is an ecstasy, a stepping out of my world into theirs. Australian myth sings of a time when men could become animals and animals could become men, and they understood each other's languages. There are times now, for me, with my dogs" (63). But this ecstatic sense of union quickly turns to disgust, as Lerman confronts the aspects of becoming an animal that most challenge civilized preferences and veneers: she realizes her socks are soaked in urine and Molly, the pups' mother, is leaking a greenish discharge. While these fluids can be washed off, the scars that Lerman carries on her body from the rough play of another dog, Ben, cannot. Encounters with wildness challenge us, mark us, and change us, sometimes in the flesh. That is the cost of "becoming with." Sandilands emphasizes that encounters with wildness are encounters "with a nature that overflows our ability to describe it," encounters typically take the form of trauma, awe, or a sense of oneness with the natural world (192). For Lerman, as we have seen, awe and a sense of oneness predominate. In one telling example, she is lying down in the whelping box and finds herself being licked by Molly as if she were one of her pups, a process that allows her to "escape into [her] animal self (35). She reflects that "sex had been my only escape, perhaps play when I was a child. But now, a great mother grooming me in the heat of the new puppies, in a pool of creation, I am as safe as any infant, as trusting, as clean, as loved" (35). Significantly, the state that Lerman recaptures through this primal experience is one that exists before language, before we are ushered into a sense of ourselves as separate from the world around us, from the Real. For Sandilands, it is the memories and traces of encounters with the Real that are wild, and the sense of unity and wholeness that Lerman attempts to describe is exactly such a memory. It's telling that so many of Lerman's confrontations with wildness? whether disgusting, painful, or transcendent?are deeply embodied and sensory, overwhelming or lying beneath language. For Sandilands, the</page><page sequence="17">Karla Armbruster 771 acknowledgment of wildness and the ways that it exceeds language means understanding that "Human language about nonhuman nature can never be complete; only by acknowledging its limits is the space opened for otherworldly conversations" (185).16 And Lerman's commitment to such otherworldly conversations with her dogs is a consistent theme throughout the book. This commitment is a challenging one. There's a moment when Molly wants to climb onto Lerman's bed and licks her face for permission. Lerman is quite aware that Molly's tongue has just cleaned up afterbirth and the puppies' excrement and urine. "It isn't easy for me to let her lick my face," she writes, "but it is her language and I must listen or she will stop speaking to me" (7). Significantly, in discussing various works by Donna Haraway, Sandilands describes a "space ... filled with interactions and new, mutant languages" between human and nonhuman animal sociality" (184), and the "mutant" language that emerges between Lerman and her dogs requires her not only to resist disgust but also to let go of the notion that she must dominate and control every interaction. For example, at one point, after Lerman and her husband remove some of the pups from the whelping box in order to weigh them, Molly takes one into her mouth, "her huge and treacherous jaws encompassing all but head and tail and little matchstick legs," her eyes looking directly into Lerman's as they each hold onto one end of the pup (19). Lerman beats back her fear, forcing herself to trust Molly as a mother, imagining that Molly' s action is her way of saying that "these are her puppies and she's had enough of our intervention" (19). The deep intimacy, acceptance of risk, and mutant languages that Lerman evolves with her dogs are certainly reward enough for opening herself up to wildness. However, the sense of "becoming with" that she achieves makes her aware of her connectedness to a much larger sphere of existence. In a remarkable moment, Lerman shares an experience of wonder triggered by something that would normally provoke disgust?a profound moment of revisioning that which seems alien, of finding a way to accommodate and even revere the wild. Molly eats ravenously and then regurgitates the pasta she has eaten for her pups?minus the meatballs she was served with it. Lerman understands that "the pile of pasta is her sign that she is finished whelping and her pups are to eat whole food" (67). But she marvels at the mystery of the missing meatballs. Perhaps Molly, or her</page><page sequence="18">772 jac body, somehow knows what is appropriate: "Grains now? Meatballs later? She no longer wants them on her nipples. It's time. Who has set this formidable clock in motion?" (67). The pasta becomes for Lerman a symbol of the wild wisdom of the more-than-human world, a world that miraculously includes her in its mysteries: "One turns inward or upward for a spiritual experience. My Newfs exist in a parallel universe, alongside, neither upward nor downward. Now and then doors open between us, and I experience the wonder and security of a universe that cares for its creatures" (67). Response-ability: Practicing Otherness-in-Connection in J.R. Ackerley's My Dog Tulip While Lerman certainly recognizes the wild aspects of her dogs' involve ment in the cycles of reproduction, and she develops an open, malleable sense of her own identity that allows her to value and accommodate that wildness, she does not directly address some of the larger issues and responsibilities surrounding the human control of canine sexuality and reproduction. We find out that Molly was sent away to be bred to a Canadian Newfie from her same illustrious line and that her puppies were born by Caesarian section. Given these significant human interventions, it's all the more fascinating that Lehrman sees and opens herself up to the wildness in the process that follows, but she does not reflect on the cultural practices of breeding and medical technology that control, suppress, and mask the wildness of that process. Another memoir, J.R. Ackerley's 1956 My Dog Tulip, addresses these issues more directly, in the process illustrating what Haraway calls response and respect to companion species. Living in London with his Alsatian (German Shepherd) Tulip in the 1940s and 50s, Ackerley was, as Haraway describes, "an important novelist, famous homosexual, and splendid writer." (Manifesto 34).17 Assuming that "a full life" for Tulip "naturally included the pleasures of sex and maternity," he set about "finding a husband" for her (Ackerley 56).18 Like Lerman, he recognizes and values the wildness of the processes of reproduction and birth, sometimes experiencing it as mystery and other times as trauma. Rather</page><page sequence="19">Karla Armbruster 773 than finding Tulip' s heats largely disgusting or annoying, he is "touched by the mysterious process at work within her" (63). When Tulip mates with another dog, Dusty, Ackerley's romantic notions of dog love, first reinforced by the "charming" picture they make afterwards, lying on the grass with their paws entangled, are shattered by the dogs' reactions when they realize they can't pull apart. In her panic, Tulip drags a miserable Dusty about on his back, and Ackerley thinks, "Heavens!... this is love! These are the pleasures of sex!" (105). And yet he responds compassion ately to this disturbing, alien face of the canine sexual process, sitting with the dogs and calming them until detumesence occurs. Much like Lerman in the face of Molly's nurturing of her pups, he feels awe at the sight of Tulip caring for her offspring, knowing exactly what to do, guided by a force larger and older than human culture to carry out "the delicate and complicated business of creation" (112). However, Ackerley is also quite aware of the tangle of social practices and expectations surrounding his attempt to give Tulip "a full life." He knows that purebreds are often commodified and explicitly rejects profit as his own motivation. However, at first he searches for another Alsatian to be Tulip's partner, giving as his reason the notion that "so beautiful a creature as Tulip should certainly have children as pretty as herself (57). As Susan McHugh points out, here he assumes "breed equals beauty" ("Marrying" 35), but the book as a whole charts his growing discomfort with human control and suppression of canine sexu ality and reproduction. In part, Ackerley's evolving attitude is inspired by the agency the dogs themselves still manage to assert, despite the force of the structures working to control them. His plans largely fail. Either Tulip rejects the dogs he selects for her, or the male dogs don't seem interested or able to mount her. In response, Ackerley begins to question the entire process, wondering if there is "something unnatural about bringing two dogs, total strangers, together for an hour or so for the purpose of copulation, not to mention having to stimulate them into taking an interest in each other" (80); he notes that Tulip likes some dogs more than others even simply as playmates. Nevertheless, he enlists the help of his veterinarian, and Tulip is successfully mated to another Alsatian named Timothy?with "help," a fact that torments Ackerley after the fact: "Call it 'helped,' call it what one</page><page sequence="20">774 jac would, my virgin bitch had been ravished, it seemed to me, without spontaneity, without desire, and I could not believe that that was right" (86). But Tulip does not become pregnant. Eventually, noticing what seems to be a mutual attraction between Tulip and the dog next door, "a disreputable, dirty mongrel, Dusty by name," Ackerley relinquishes control over her choice of mate." 'It's up to you,'" he tells Tulip (104). And this is the wild interaction that results in Tulip's pregnancy. Throughout the book, Ackerley consistently takes his responsibility, not just to Tulip, but to the entire network of beings she connects him with?other dogs, the rabbits she chases and sometimes catches, other humans?very seriously. However, nowhere does the burden of human responsibility for the lives of dogs as domestic animals come out so strongly as in Ackerley's brutally honest discussion of the fate of Tulip's pups. He unsparingly describes the weightiness of the task: "To' find them homes,' as I had phrased it to myself, began to seem a totally inadequate description of my duty. I perceived that their whole future, their health and happiness, depended entirely upon me. Their lives were in my hands" (119). And he is equally unsparing in describing how he failed them. Ominously, he tells us that it might have been better had he used a bucket of water and flour sack to drown them. As mixed breed pups, they are not highly desirable, and though Ackerley finds them homes, they are not the types of homes he initially hoped for: homes with people who had the money, time, and physical and mental energy to care for the pups properly. He recounts their unhappy fates in detail: one is run over, one is put to sleep because she develops "fits," three are passed on to other owners or otherwise disappear, one leads what Ackerley surmises is a dull and uneventful life, never leaving the flat and yard, and the last roams the neighborhood at will for four years, eventually dying of cancer. While Ackerley admits he cannot know that things would have turned out better for the pups had he found them different homes, he does not try to avoid responsibility, admitting that his primary motivation in moving them out of his apartment into these homes was his own self-interest: "How [well] I did for them was of less urgency then than how I did for myself (121). After the trauma of watching the pups embark upon their unhappy fates, the question of how to respond to Tulip's sexuality weighs on Ackerley just as heavily: he is consumed with guilt about frustrating her</page><page sequence="21">Karla Armbruster 775 desire, at one point asking, "Sweet creature, what am I doing to you? I stretch out my hand in the gloom and stroke the small nipples which, I have decided, shall never again fulfill their natural purpose" (138). He does not want to spay her, viewing that as "tampering" with her, but realizing that in keeping her from sexual activity when she is in heat, he is tampering with her as well. (139). His careful consideration of all the alternatives, his unflinching acceptance of his responsibility for the harm that results from his choices, marks Ackerley's relationship with Tulip as one of true respect and response. Gradually, his focus enlarges from Tulip's situation to that of dogs in general. He remarks upon the fact that dogs in the city are very unlikely to be permitted to engage in sex, reviewing the various ways people justify the limits placed on this natural drive: "Some people believe they hate sex; others regard it as unnecessary, or odious, or positively dangerous. Some, hugging to themselves all the love, which dogs feel only for the human race, will not allow that there is a sexual instinct also" (151). He understands this draconian attempt to suppress and control this wild aspect of dogs' lives as just one manifestation of the human compulsion to order and dominate every aspect of their pets' existences, describing the reactions of owners of male dogs who take an interest in Tulip as she is coming in or out of heat: "Both animals are safely on the sidewalk, they are clearly on the best of terms, the master is in no hurry. But the amount of totally unnecessary interference in canine lives, the exercise of authority for its own sake, has to be seen to be believed" (152). Observing free-ranging dogs trying to court Tulip, Ackerley extends his respect and response to them as well (rather than regarding them as nuisances or adversaries). He compassionately notices how worried they seem about his possible reactions, reflecting on their precarious position as domestic animals: I realized clearly, perhaps for the first time, what strained and anxious lives dogs must lead, so emotionally involved in the world of men, whose affections they strive endlessly to secure, whose authority they are expected unquestioningly to obey, and whose mind they never can do more than imperfectly reach and compre hend. Stupidly loved, stupidly hated, acquired without thought, reared and ruled without understanding, passed on or 'put to sleep'</page><page sequence="22">776 jac without care .... Infinite pains I now took to reassure them, and sometimes succeeded. (158-9) Thus, Ackerley's struggles to acknowledge Tulip's sexual drives and agency without producing more pups leads him into a realization of the basic paradox at the heart of human "ownership" of dogs: in order for them to flourish as domesticated animals, we need to take responsibil ity for their lives, yet the process of doing that often frustrates and perverts their agency and natural instincts in ways that diminish that flourishing. To some extent, Ackerley solves his dilemma in Tulip's case by trusting her to manage her own sexual affairs. Eventually, he decides "I had interfered too much in her life already. ... I wanted no further authority in her personal affairs" (156). His only "interference" involves limiting her freedom to places where male dogs won't be whipped for mounting her and he won't be fined. However, he is astonished to find that she repels most dogs' advances: "It was, indeed, the very thing she had tried in vain to do for me in the past, when I had foolishly supposed my intelligence to be greater than hers" (157). And she is never impregnated again. Though he makes no claims that his approach would work for every dog owner, Ackerley finds that Tulip has her own wisdom, a wild knowledge outside his complete comprehension, that solves the problem in their case. What's notable about Ackerley's book is the degree to which his respect for Tulip's wildness not only leads him to go to great lengths to accommodate it but also takes him on a journey outwards, leading him to reflect on the situation of dogs in general and even other animals. The response-ability he practices with Tulip extends to the rabbits he lets her hunt as well. As she devours the rabbit, Ackerley acknowledges it as a living being, describing "the crunch of the tender bones and the skull, bone still warm with the lust of the young creature's life" (134). Tulip is in heat, and Ackerley allows her to hunt and eat the rabbit to try to divert some of the sexual energy he feels he is frustrating. He understands he has made a choice between Tulip and the rabbit, and he takes responsibility for it. The type of contemplation and taking ownership of choices that Ackerley models towards other beings is hugely demanding, but that is the cost of the "response and respect" that Haraway insists is the proper acknowl</page><page sequence="23">Karla Armbruster 777 edgment of companion species, the way to negotiate "otherness-in relation." Significantly, Ackerley does not present his approach to Tulip's sexuality and reproductive capacities as "the" solution to the problem of how humans should respond to the sexual and reproductive nature of dogs. He maintains humility, never assuminghe has "gotten it right"; at one point, comparing the life he has given to Tulip to those of her pups, he acknowledges that even all the money, time, and energy he devoted to her could not guarantee canine happiness, but only "lay a hopeful foundation for it" (120). As part of laying this foundation, he makes mistakes, learns from them, agonizes over his choices, and generally muddles through, with his regard for Tulip the touchstone of the process; Haraway describes him as "striving to fulfi 11 the messy conditions of being in love," noting that "the misrecognitions were as important as the fleeting moments of getting things right. Ackerley's story was full of the fleshly, meaning-making details of worldly, face-to-face love" (Manifesto 35). Conclusion Certainly, most of us cannot go to the lengths Ackerley did to ponder and accommodate Tulip's needs and desires. We cannot all experience birth and puppycare first-hand; I am not advocating a return to the days when families let female dogs have litters so their children could experience the miracle of birth, often without regard for the fates of the pups. But we can acknowledge the enormity of our control over the sexuality and reproduc tion of the animals we call our best friends and often claim as members of our families. We can take this control seriously and ask in what ways we are responsible for making domestication what David Macauley has described as a "protracted extinction, a slow crippling death of birth itself (130). When we exert control over our dogs' sexuality and reproduction in selfish or unreflecti ve ways, birth itself (or the lack of it) becomes more and more a reflection of our own desires, preferences, and weaknesses rather than a source of wildness and renewal. Instead, we can think more consistently and honestly about how our control affects dogs, as individuals and as a species, and what both we and the dogs lose in the process. We can take responsibility for those effects and losses, minimizing or compen</page><page sequence="24">778 jac sating for them by allowing dogs as much agency and scope for wildness as we can, while also understanding the limits to our ability to control. The problem of dog sexuality and reproduction points to the larger paradox and pathos of the situation of all domestic animals. Something seen as the essence of their natural beings, something we might call wild, has been commandeered and controlled by humanity, often in ways that are harmful to the animals or at least minimize their full enjoyment of life. Instead of saying this control must be abolished, though, it's important to see that it crystallizes the paradox of our relation to all life. We affect the world around us, not always positively. We live, inevitably, at the cost of the lives of others. How to live with this knowledge, and to take responsibility for the effects we have on other beings, is our challenge? the challenge of being human, of consciously and conscientiously existing in relationship with other beings, which is, of course, the only way we exist at all. Webster University St. Louis, Missouri Notes 1. This article was previously published as "Into the Wild: An Ecofeminist Perspective on the Human Control of Canine Sexuality and Reproduction in Vakoch. 2.1 should add that some breeders go to great lengths to avoid these kinds of defects, as documented by Haraway in "For the Love of a Good Dog" and When Species Meet. 3. Herzog, Bentley and Hahn explain changes in the popularity of different dog breeds in the U.S. using the concept of random drift; deviations from the model, they suggest, occur because people tend to copy others' choices in breed selection. Media representations play a role as well; for example, there is a spike in Dalmatian registrations each time a film version of 101 Dalmatians is released. 4. Winograd claims that roughly five million dogs and cats are euthanized in U.S. shelters each year; Hamilton estimates over three million 5. See Winograd for one argument that accessible, affordable spaying and neutering, combined with much more aggressive adoption programs, can elimi nate the need for euthanasia of healthy dogs in U.S. shelters. 6. See Gaard (Ecofeminism)', Adams; and Adams and Donovan. 7. See Gaard ("Ecofeminism on the Wing" and "Vegetarian Ecofeminism") and Gaard and Gruen.</page><page sequence="25">Karla Armbruster 779 8. There is an interesting comparison to be made, for example, between the ways modern reproductive technologies intrude into the lives of dogs and the lives of women: in both cases, some technologies aid the reproduction of certain kinds of socially valued individuals, while others are promoted (and used) as "solutions" to the perceived problem of "too many" individuals belonging to less valued categories. 9. See Palmer ("Killing Animals") for a nuanced discussion of this respon sibility. 10. See Shepard and Hall, for example. In Dominance and Affection, Tuan makes a less extreme version of this argument, simply observing that our relationships with pets always include a measure of dominance. 11. See Macauley for an argument that domestication does not always have to mean domination. 12. Rollin and Rollin also call attention to this trend, summing it up as "responsible people who acquire the best animals assuring that these animals' genes are not passed on, while clueless people happily breed disasters" (10). 13. Rollin and Rollin challenge the naturalized status of spaying and neuter ing by asserting that "in a responsible society, nothing more high-tech than a leash is needed for [canine] birth control" (10). 14. It was the writer and ecocritic John Tallmadge who first suggested to me that the processes of reproduction are wild, involving powerful, more-than human forces that Western medical practices only sometimes succeed in chan neling and taming. In his The Cincinnati Arch, he describes his wife Pam giving birth to their first daughter, reflecting afterwards that "something ancient and powerful had leapt into the room through the door of Pam's wracked body.. .. something older and deeper than the mind, an evolutionary wisdom that had unfolded in harmony with the planet's wisdom" (31-32). 15. It is helpful to look at Armstrong's notion of ferity when thinking about the ways wildness confronts us most profoundly; he defines ferity as those forms of wilderness that represent a reaction against modernity's attempts at civiliza tion, domestication, captivation or manipulation (n. 9, 227) and describes feral behaviors as representing "animal agency inimical to agricultural and domestic order" (36). Interestingly, he uses the example of Robinson Crusoe's cats, which cross "the boundary between pet and pest" (35). Crusoe considers the two cats who survive the shipwreck with him as part of his "little family," accepting and anthropomorphically enjoying their agency. But once their population explodes, they become "pests," and their agency is "reconfigured as ferity" (35). Similarly, the (very real) threat of our dog population exploding both spurs us to spay and neuter and haunts us as a potential expression of wildness. 16. She is discussing Haraway' s writing about her relationships with her dogs and borrows the term "otherworldly conversations" from her. 17. Tulip's real name was Queenie; Ackerley changed her name at the</page><page sequence="26">780 jac suggestion of his editors, who worried that "Queenie" would inspire jokes about Ackerley's sexual orientation. 18. McHugh argues that Ackerley's homosexuality and the "queer ideas of free love and public sex [that] hover at the edges of the text" are intimately interconnected with his willingness to defy societal norms in his quest to accommodate Tulip's sexuality (Dog 156).
