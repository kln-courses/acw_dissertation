<plain_text><page sequence="1">LANGUAGE, SIGNS, AND COGNITION IN THE CHIMPANZEE Roger S. Fouts &amp; Roger L. Mellgren 1 Introduction: Learning and Biological Considerations. Being trained as an American psychologist in the recent past has usually meant that there is a strong environmentalist bias in one's intellectual history. By this we mean that the radical behaviorist philosophy of John Watson still permeates the training of many scientists interested in understanding the behavior of organisms. The essence of this approach is the viewpoint that a newborn baby can be taken from its natural mother and by manipulating the baby's environment we can produce a beggar or thief or bank president or any type of person we desire. Perhaps we have tempered our environmen tal approach in the recent past, but the strong influence of radical behaviorism is difficult to undermine. How can I prove that you cannot take my child and turn him or her into a murderer or an astronaut? If we say that this is not the case, then we argue from negative evidence. That is to say that the appropriate experiment has not been done, and so it is wrong to conclude that environmental influences cannot produce vastly different adults given the same genetic makeup. (To be sure, studies of identical twins, raised separately, have attempted to deal with these kinds of problems, but so many methodological problems exist with this kind of study that we do not feel compelled to draw any conclusions from them.) Each time we are able to change a person's be havior by manipulating the environment we may add further evidence to the importance of the concepts of radical behaviorism. * We wish to thank students and former students who aided in the collection of data and observation reported here: E. Sue Savage, Janet Kate, Joe Couch, George Kimball, and Shiela Thompson. Support for the research reported and preparation of this paper was provided by the National Institute of Mental Health (MH23511-02). 319</page><page sequence="2">320 Sign Language Studies 13 Consider for a moment the opposite situation. Suppose we manipulate the environment and fail to observe a change in behavior. What do we conclude? Hayes &amp; Hayes (1951a,b() attempted to teach their chimpanzee Vicki to talk. The results of their attempt were at best very limited: Vicki learned to say "mama", "papa", "cup", and "up", albeit with a heavy chim panzee accent. From the standpoint of the radical behaviorist several alternative conclusions are possible. First, we might suppose that the Hayeses were not familiar enough with cur rent behavioristic procedures of reinforcement, shaping, fading, etc. , and that they were unsuccessful due to this inadequacy. Second, we might postulate that for some reason the chimpanzee is not capable of learning language. Of course, this conclusion is not justified because it depends on negative evidence. To conclude that the chimpanzee is incapabie of language because it failed to speak in one or a number of experiments would be comparable to concluding that life on other planets does not exist simply because we didn't find life on the moon or on some other planet. A third possibility, not likely to be espoused by the radical behaviorist, is that perhaps a chimpanzee is capable of language behavior but not in a language that is isomorphic with spoken human language. This more enlightened view might be categorized as a "modern behaviorist" position. Most reason able linguists would not require that the subject be able to speak in order to determine if the subject possessed language or was capable of language. The strict or radical behaviorist makes the mistake of assuming "equivalence of associability" (Seligman 1970). This position assumes that general laws govern learning pro cesses and the particular response we choose to measure may be arbitrarily chosen. The assumption is that by manipulating the subject's environment and observing changes in the arbi trarily chosen response, laws with great generality for all responses and organisms will be discovered. Of course, the notion that responses are arbitrarily chosen is clearly not true. A pigeon pecking at a lighted key or a rat running down an alley are not arbitrary organisms and responses in any sense of the word. Both organisms and their responses are used because they are reliable and produce data which usually mini mizes "error variance" -- i.e. the differences associated with idiosyncracies of each organism. For example, pigeons may learn to peck a key without reinforcement contingencies being operative (Brown &amp; Jenkins 1968).</page><page sequence="3">Fouts &amp; Mellgren 321 The equivalence-of-associability assumption may seem like a somewhat extreme statement of faith, but it is not an exaggeration, although it has come under attack in a number of quarters (e.g. Bolles 1975). Consider these statements by two highly respected behaviorists: An operant is a class of behaviors all of which change the environment in the same way. The response most commonly used in operant conditioning is the closing of a switch resembling a telegraph key, although any other objective effect on the environment might be chosen (Reynolds 1968:17, emphasis added). Any natural phenomenon chosen at will may be con verted into a conditional stimulus. . . any visual stim ulus, any desired sound, any odor, and the stimulation of any part of the skin (Pavlov 1928:86). Ethologists are no less guilty of a biased approach to the study of behavior. Typically, the concern of the ethologist is the behavior of the organism in its natural setting and engaged in innate or species-typical behavior. Certainly we need to know the biologically given behaviors of the organism, but the problem with this approach is that it may place artificial limits on behavior. That is, if we concern ourselves only with the biologically determined behavior, we may ignore the biological potential of the organism. Organisms adapt to novel surroundings, and this dynamic process is certainly as legitimate an area of study as is the study of innate be havior. What are we left with? Laboratory studies of learning processes are often unrealistic in the degree of generality they represent. The experimenter may assume his findings represent a general principle, transcending the particular organism or response generating the finding; but such assum ptions often fail when put to the test. The ethologist may ignore the interesting deviations and uniqueness of behavior. In our study of the chimpanzee and the use of sign language, we are put in the middle of these two approaches to the study of behavior. First of all, we are aware of no one who has claimed that the chimpanzee engages in language behavior in its natural habitat. Of course we would be quick to point out that this</page><page sequence="4">322 Sign Language Studies 13 lack of natural language behavior may only be a failure of present observational techniques and opportunities to observe. This question is open to empirical investigation. Second, it is often noted that chimpanzees reared with humans have the ability to understand spoken English (Hayes 1951, Kellog &amp; Kellog 1933). Finally, the ability of the chimpanzee to produce language has been reported on a number of occasions (Fouts 1975. Gardner &amp; Gardner 1969. 1971). The position we find ourselves in is to convince the ethologists that the "unnatural" sign language we teach to chimpanzees is important to consider in discussing the behavior of this organism, because it reveals potentialities previously unrealized. We suspect that the ethologist provides a sympathetic ear for what we say. On the other hand, we must convince the radical behaviorist that a chimpanzee using sign language is not merely another example of a pigeon pecking at a key to obtain some grain or a rat pressing a bar to receive a food pellet. Although we do not deny the value of experimental studies done in highly restricted environments with carefully chosen organisms and responses, we do not feel that sign lan guage in the chimpanzee can be adequately explained only by application of principles derived in these oversimplified situ ations. The findings we will report presumably strengthen this conclusion. We do not mean to imply that there is a dichotomy between the simpler responses exhibited in the usual psychological lab oratory study and the chimpanzee engaging in sign language activity. The basic principles involved may well be similar although we would probably not all agree on what those prin ciples are. Perhaps the most straightforward way to explain the dif ferences between a rat pressing a bar and a chimpanzee signing, or between a chimpanzee and a human, is to make reference to the degree of different behaviors. No chimpanzee has yet written a novel, and no rat has yet signed to an experimenter. It can be argued that each organism learns associations but that the ability to use these associations in novel and unique ways may be restricted by the genetic makeup of the organism. That is, at present we see no reason to postulate a fundamental difference between the acquisition of sign language in the chimpanzee and a rat learning to press a bar in a Skinner Box. A difference that does seem to exist is the degree to which each organism is able to utilize past experiences in novel situations. We would maintain that the chimpanzee is more flexible in its ability to utilize past learning experiences in dealing with these novel situations.</page><page sequence="5">Fouts &amp; Mellgren 323 Perhaps the continuity between learning processes and their relation to chimpanzee sign language is stretched beyond the breaking point when we consider the problems inherent in language as a type of study. We will now consider some aspects of language which are particularly relevant to work with the chimpanzee and sign language. Dichotomies of language. Until recently the main concern of linguists was determining the defining characteristics of lan guage. This was mainly a descriptive exercise using human vocal communication as the model. In general it was assumed that if an adult human was vocalizing to another human, then this was language. Since almost every human seemed to use it, it was thought to be a uniquely human behavior, and universals of language were also assumed to exist. A universal is something characteristic of all languages used by humans. Up until the past decade, the search for universals was one of the main concerns of linguists. If an organism was of the human species, it was assumed to possess language and its universals. On the other hand, animals were thought to communicate, but they were not said to have language. Few linguists concerned themselves very much with animal communication, except perhaps to note that von Frisch misused the term "language" when he referred to communication processes in the bee. The fact that linguists did not expose themselves to the study of animal behavior did not stop some of them from commenting on the linguistic abilities of other animals. For instance, Chomsky states that ". . .all normal humans acquire language whereas acquisiton of even its barest rudiments is quite beyond the capacities of an otherwise intelligent ape" (1961:59). Therefore the interest of some lin guists in studying comparative linguistics across species seemed to serve little function other than to note only in pas sing that other animals do not have language and that humans are quite unique in this capacity for language. The implicit assumption in this approach was that the study of language in another species would be a futile endeavor. some linguists concerned witn nndlng tne universais oi language made lists of the characteristics of language (e.g. Hockett 1959) and others compared these defining characteristics to the available data on animal communication (e.g. Altmann 1967). The interesting characteristic to note is not to be found in these lists, however, but is a characteristic of the lists themselves — they keep growing longer. One cannot help but wonder when the end will be in sight.</page><page sequence="6">324 Sign Language Studies 13 An agreed-upon definition of language does not presently exist (Fouts, in press), and therefore we do not know the es sential characteristics of language. It might be that listing characteristics is not a viable way of defining language, because some of them may not be essential to language, in the same way that a spare tire or four doors may not be essential to defining what constitutes an automobile. One thing that is evident about human language is that it develops during the lifetime of the members of our species and this development is a process of change. It is the various com ponents of the process of language that linguists have so dili gently studied. Many of them have studied the adult character istics of language in an attempt to find a component that was characteristic of the language that existed in each adult mem ber within a particular language community. Other linguists have attempted to find universale in languages used in differ ent language communities . Also, other researchers have studied the linguistic behavior of immature members of our species. Brown (1973) has noted that such hypotheses as "telegraphic speech" are no longer viable explanations for the linguistic behavior of children. Telegraphic speech is the type of linguistic behavior that one would use when sending a telegram; for example, instead of writing "My car has broken down" in a telegram, one would write "Car broken. " The im plication was that children's linguistic behavior was a simpli fied version of adult linguistic behavior. However, it might be that children are using different rules in some instances when compared to an adult user. Regardless of what the final con clusion of this controversy concerning the development of lan guage in children may be, the apparent fact remains that how children use language is in some sense quite different from the way adults use the same language. One could assume (of those differences) that a dichotomy exists between the adults' version and the children's version. However, we know that this is not true, because language is a process in man and develops over time. The adult version develops out of the child's version; but at different points in this process the two appear to be quite different and are quite different. Yet if the development from two years of age to twenty-two years of age were examined , presumably this process would be apparent. If a two-year-old's linguistic behavior were compared with that of a twenty-two year old, it would be wrong to assume that observed differences</page><page sequence="7">Fouts &amp; Mellgren 325 were evidence for a true dichotomy or that a difference in kind existed. One would have failed to view the entire process by limiting his examination to only two different points occurring within that process. So, when comparing the language of the two year old with that of a twenty-two year old, differences would reflect the degree to which change had occurred in the developmental process over time. Observing this process of change by examining its development throughout an individual's lifetime allows a definition of the process itself as a whole rather than the idiosyncratic characteristics of various points of the developmental process. Therefore, a comparison of two separate points of the developmental process of language might result in dichotomies that exist only as long as there is failure to take into account the developmental process taking place between those two points. When language is studied as if it were a static phenomenon rather than a dynamic process, then dichotomies may be assumed to exist. This approach, which treats language as a group of static parts, probably accounts for the dichotomy drawn between the linguistic be havior of man and the communication of other animals. It fails to take into account the evolutionary process that took place for language to develop in our species. And, as with comparing the different points of linguistic behavior within a developing individual member of a species or of this behavior across species, the dichotomies that are drawn are generally based upon the absence of evidence representative of the un examined parts of the developmental or evolutionary process. A clear example of the use of negative evidence or the absence of evidence as if it were positive evidence or empir ical fact occurs in Roger Brown's book A First Language: The Early Stages, when he states (in regard to Chomsky's and Lenneberg's statements about the inability of other animals to acquire language): "So Chomsky and Lenneberg had the evidence on their side when they wrote..." (1973: 33, emphasis added). Quite on the contrary, Chomsky and Lenneberg did not have the evidence on their side. The evidence Brown refers to is the report of early attempts (e.g. Hayes &amp; Hayes 1951, Kellog &amp; Kellog 1933) to teach or observe the development of speech in apes. Because this research failed to show that chimpanzees could use speech to communicate, it did not necessarily follow that chimpanzees could not evince this behavior at some future time. Presently we can only withhold</page><page sequence="8">326 Sign Language Studies 13 judgment concerning the capacity of the chimpanzee to use a vocal language. In addition to the absence of evidence that was used to hypothesize a dichotomy, the fact that the vast majority of linguistic research has been done on one species has had the effect of producing a scientific myopia within the field. Just as language can be conceived as a developmental process within an individual member of our species, it can also be conceived as an emerging process within our species. This means that language has evolved in our species to its present human form and that it will continue to evolve just as other behaviors and physical characteristics of our species have evolved and continue to do so. Therefore, if we were able to compare our present form of language with that of a hypothetical language in our early hominoid ancestors, we could possibly draw another dichotomy between the two forms. However, if the evolution of language were examined, then it is possible that the process would become evident and the ar bitrary dichotomy would disappear. Of course one could hold that language was the result of saltation within modern man. Given our knowledge of the evolutionary process involved in the development of the other characteristics of modern man, this does not presently appear to be a tenable position. Gen erally, the more complex a given trait is, the longer it took to reach its present development. Language in man is indeed a very complex behavior, and it is even possible that its be ginnings were evident in hominid evolution. But since few behaviors leave fossil records, this is a tenuous position to maintain because we currently have no evidence. As before, the best position is to withhold judgment. But it is even more illogical to rely on saltation or divine creation to explain our possession of language. These are not viable explanations, especially when they are applied as explanatory devices for a developmental process. If one finds the barest rudiments of linguistic behavior in an otherwise intelligent ape, is this acceptable evidence for the position that language evolved from a common ancestor? Even though the absence of this evidence was used by Chomsky and Lenneberg to support the notion of saltation, if such evi dence existed, it could not be used to support the position that a common ancestor had incipient linguistic abilities. To hold the position that the behaviors have evolved seems to be a much rtiore productive position, in terms of obtaining empirical</page><page sequence="9">Fouts &amp; Mellgren 327 data, than by fiat to discard the usefulness of cross-species comparative data within a behavior. But the fact remains that the empirical sciences do not deal with conundrums. Because language is a developmental process, and if the behavior in two species did have a common origin, then lan guage studies should supply useful data in terms of indicating the similarities and differences between the evolutions of the two species. Of course, this requires active empirical attempts to study the linguistic behavior in other animals in addition to man and comparisions of this behavior with man's. Active attempts to study certain types of behavior have suffered from scientific apartheid. This is not limited to language and linguists, but it is also evident in the empirical sciences stemming from some of the philosophical assumptions within lan guage sciences. Donald Griffin states the idea as follows: If we examine the background of our curent viewpoint, it is clear that it stems from a critical reaction roughly seventy years ago to an earlier tendency to ascribe human feelings to a wide variety of animals on the basis of anecdotal reports. This behavioristic reaction has served our science well, but so much has now been learned about animal behavior, and especially about orientation and communication, that it is per haps time to reeximaine the basic viewpoint and inquire whether what was once healthy and disci plined restraint may now be limiting our perspectives and causing us to overlook important opportunities for further advances. There has been a tendency for what was originally an essentially agnostic position about mental experiences in animals to drift into a de facto denial that mental states or consciousness exist outside our own species. Here it seems approp riate to follow the example of Holloway (1974) and quote Danial Yankelovich ("Smith," 1972), "The first step is to measure whatever can easily be measured. This is okay as far as it goes. The second step is to disregard that which cannot be measured or give it an arbitrary quantitative value. This is artificial and misleading. The third step is to presume that what cannot be measured easily is not very im portant. This is blindness. The fourth step is to say that what cannot be easily measured really does not exist. This is suicide." (1976:9).</page><page sequence="10">32 8 Sign Language Studies 13 The exclusion of a behavior or an organism from study has not always been so prevalent in the scientific pursuit of knowledge. Perhaps we as scientists have forgotten Aristotle's statement, "If any person thinks the examination of the rest of the animal kingdom an unworthy task, he must hold in like dis esteem the study of man. " 2 Experimental Studies Is thinking or cognition necessary for language? Or, can an organism have language without having cognition? The ob vious answer to these questions is that language is the result of cognition or thinking. To put it in a different way, cog nition is a more basic process than language. Thus, it can be said that language is one overt behavioral representation of the covert behavior involved in cognition. Language and cog nition or thinking have become tied together because one is the result of the other. But the mistake should not be made of assuming that if an organism does not have language, it is therefore incapable of thought. In fact a major part of psycho logical research has been directed toward answering the question of whether or not animals other than man can think. In this section evidence will be presented which presumably bears on the question whether animals can think. Novel combinations. In an article comparing human language to the early data on chimpanzee sign language acquisition, Bronowski &amp; Bellugi listed five characteristics of language. They pointed out that one of these, reconstitution, had not been evinced in a chimpanzee and went on to state that re constitution is the "evolutionary hallmark of the human mind" (1970: 673). They define reconstitution as a process that in volves two procedures; one is an analysis which breaks mes sages down into smaller parts and does not treat the message as an inviolate whole; the second procedure is synthesis in which parts so separated are rearranged to form other messages. In another article, Hebb, Lambert,&amp; Tucker have proposed a similar definition of language . They state that: True language is distinctive in its combinations of two or more symbolic acts (words or gestures) into one situation and in the ready combination of the same parts in another situation and/or another purpose (1973:56).</page><page sequence="11">Fouts &amp; Mellgren 329 Thus, Hebb et al. come to quite the opposite conclusion from that reached by Bronowski &amp; Bellugi in regard to a chimpanzee's use of sign language based on their five characteristic criteria. "Washoe has language ..." (Hebb, Lambert, &amp; Tucker 1973:56). The two definitions appear strikingly similar, but their inclusion in this chapter is not meant to imply that they are "the defi nition" of language. We prefer to withhold judgment until a generallly agreed upon definition of language is found. The im portant aspect of both of these definitions is that they empha size novel combinations and recombinations of elements already present to form new messages. In vocal language, recombina tions occur at two levels. The phonemes of vocal languages are recombined to form new words, but the phonemes do not them selves appear to carry any information; phonemes are compar able to cheremes in a gestural language, made up of different hand configurations, movements, and places related to the signer's body. The other level of recombination is that involved in recombining words into new utterances. Depending on the context in which they are used, words can express new mean ings, and they also have the characteristic of being novel to the organism. The act of combining words or signs, so that when combined they express a new meaning, will be the focus of consideration in this section. One study (Mellgren, Fouts, &amp; Lemmon 1973), which was not specifically directed toward exploring novel combinations, showed this behavior in a striking manner. This study was originally done to examine a chimpanzee's, Lucy's, use of generic or specific signs. Lucy was presented with twenty four different fruits and vegetables over a period of twelve days. She was asked the question WHAT THIS? in sign lan guage in a situation in which she was able to handle, eat, or in general do what she desired with them. The questions concerning the fruits and vegetables were interspersed with presentation and questions about other non-food items in her vocabulary (e.g. strings, shoes, combs, etc.). In this situation Lucy combined signs in her vocabulary to describe fruits or vegetables for which she did not have specific signs. E. g. a watermelon was labeled CANDY DRINK or FRUIT DRINK by Lucy. Another example concerned a radish, with which Lucy had had minimal experience. She labeled it FOOD for three days, and then she took a bite out of it and labeled it CRY HURT FOOD. She continued to use CRY or HURT to describe it for the next eight days of data col lection. She also labeled the four citrus fruit exemplars</page><page sequence="12">330 Sign Language Studies 13 (orange, lemon, lime, and grapefruit) SMELL FRUIT — most probably referring to the odoriferous quality of a citrus fruit when it is bitten into without removing the outer skin. What Lucy displayed was the ability to combine signs in her vocabu lary in novel orders to express relationships that she did not have signs for. Combinations such as these occur quite often. Washoe (the first signing chimpanzee, Gardner &amp; Gardner 1971) has been observed to label a swan a WATER BIRD, while the ex perimenter used the sign DUCK to label a swan. Washoe has also described Brazil nuts with the signs ROCK BERRY. Ally, another chimpanzee, has described a Tootsie Roll candy bar as a BANANA SWEET. What this appears to indicate is that the chimpanzees are able to combine signs in a novel fashion. Indeed, this is simi lar to their ability to transfer signs from one situation to another. E.g. Fouts (1973) noted that the chimps being taught the sign MORE by using it with the DRINK sign spontaneously general ized the use of the MORE sign by asking for MORE FRUIT. It can be seen that the chimpanzee is able to use the signs in a dynamic recombining manner. The signs are not static symbols that refer only to one object or state, but they are dynamic symbols that can be used in various conceptually related situ ations in a manner that appears to represent a high level of cognitive functioning. This chimpanzee behavior at first appears surprising or unexpected in a nonhuman. But this surprise, for the American experimental psychologist, stems from the implicit assumption underlying many of the behavioristic theories that the organism perceives an absolute stimulus and makes an absolute response. Stimulus generalization gradients are based on this erroneous idea. But when the organism is conceived of as an active organ ism that actively perceives relationships rather than absolutes, then the surprise at this behavior is diminished. What the chimpanzee appears to be doing when referring to a Brazil nut as a ROCK BERRY is probably referring to the relationship between the nut and other vocabulary words. In other words, this is an item that has the hardness of a rock and yet at the same time the fruit or edible portion comparable to a berry. The particular aspects to which the chimpanzee responds using a reconstitu tion of signs is unanswered; e.g. we do not yet know whether the function of an object is more salient in terms of choosing signs to describe it or if the physical similarities between two items guides the choice. We do not know if Ally's reference to</page><page sequence="13">Fouts &amp; Mellgren 331 a Tootsie Roll candy as a BANANA SWEET refers to its shape or to its edible qualities or both. Likewise, another chimp, Booee, referes to chewing tobacco as STRING PIPE FOOD -- this seems quite appropriate to our conception of it as long strings of tobacco that one chews. But is Booee referring to these qualities? As yet we cannot state with certainty that he is, but we are presently devising experiments to answer these questions. Comprehension and production of novel commands. It has been demonstrated that chimpanzees produce novel recombin ations of signs to produce novel sign utterances (Fouts 19 75). The study to be discussed here examines the ability of a chimpanzee to comprehend novel commands (Chown 1974). A young male chimpanzee, Ally, was used as the subject. He was born at the Institute for Primate Studies in Norman, Okla homa, on October 15, 1969. At the beginning of the study Ally was 47 months of age and had a sign language vocabulary of 63 reliable signs (meeting a criterion of occurring spontaneously and appropriately in 15 consecutive data collection sessions). The initial part of the study was devoted to teaching Ally a new "game." This is an important aspect of the chimpanzee research, since it is not typically used with other animals when doing experimental studies. The unusual aspect of this approach is that it is subject-oriented rather than experimenter-oriented. The objective is to make the task as palatable to the chimpanzee as possible. We have found that the most successful way to do this is to turn the task into a game that the chimpanzees appear to enjoy doing, since they will often initiate the game them selves. Thus, rather than a highly regimented training proce dure that serves to force an organism into its paradigm, we have a training procedure that involves more spontaneity and does not force the organism to respond. We try to make it a subject-paced experiment as opposed to an experimenter-paced task. The next step in this procedure is to move it from a casual play situation into a controlled situation in which a double blind condition is introduced. The double-blind condition is necessary for controlling the possibility that an experimenter might inadvertently cue the chimpanzee to the correct answer. The testing situation is still subject paced. We set an approxi mate maximum of perhaps 20 trials per testing session. But if the chimpanzee becomes uncooperative or loses interest in the task, we will end it at that time rather than force the chimpan</page><page sequence="14">332 Sign Language Studies 13 zee to perform a task he apparently does not want to do. We have found that forcing the chimpanzee will often turn the task into one that the chimpanzee will attempt to avoid in the future. The initial training serves two important purposes. First it facilitates the cooperation of the chimpanzee, and second, because it is relatively unstructured, it allows the chimpan zee to display behaviors that the experimenter did not pre viously know about. In 1921 Wolfgang Kohler made a similar point when he stated: Lack of ambiguity in the experimental setup in the sense of an either-or has, to be sure, unfavorable as well as favorable consequences. The decisive explanations for the understanding of apes frequently arise from quite unforseen kinds of behavior, for example, the use of tools by the animals in ways very different from human beings. If we arrange all the conditions in such a way that, so far as possible, the ape can only show the kinds of behavior in which we are interested in advance, or else nothing essential at all, then it will become less likely that the animal does the unexpected and thus teaches the observer something (1972: 215). Just as Kohler has said, often an overstructured experimental paradigm tells us more about the ability of the experimenter to conceive of behaviors that a chimpanzee might do than truly exploring the chimpanzee's mental capacity. In the initial part of the study, Ally was taught to play a game of selecting one of five different items from a box and then taking the item and placing it one of three locations when given a command in sign language; e.g. PUT BABY (doll) IN BOX. Initially if Ally made an incorrect selection, the object was taken from him and he was prompted. This was used very sparingly so that he would not become too dependent upon promptings. A corpus of 33 different commands was used in training. After Ally was responding in a fashion that indicated he was not relying on cues from the experimenter, a partition was put in place between the experimenter giving the commands and the three locations for placement of the objects. The box contain ing the five objects was moved about 10 feet from the experi menter so that he could not see what was in the box. Thus, the double-blind condition was introduced in the training phase so that there would be no major abrupt changes between training and testing.</page><page sequence="15">Fonts Κ Mfillarfin 333 After Ally was reliably responding to the commands, the testing situation was begun. In Test I, 5 8 commands were used; 29 of these were commands that had previously been used in training, and 2 9 were new commands. The new com mands were made by adding a new location for objects used in training and by adding new objects. (New objects were used with locations used in the training, and objects used in training were paired with locations not used in training, so that the particular object and location had not occurred together before.) For Tests II, III, IV, and V, all novel com mands were used. Of all the commands used in testing, Ally got 38% correct; this is far above the chance level of response (7%). Of the whole number of novel commands, Ally got 31% correct. It was found that for the new location, a chair, Ally never put an object in it. It was observed that he would stand in front of the chair and even actually sit down in the chair while con tinuing to hold the object. It may have been that Ally's conception of chair may not have included the function of containing or holding things placed in it but only that a chair is something to sit in. When the chair commands are omitted from the total novel commands, Ally's percentage improves to 50%, and for response to all commands (less chair) it im proves to 47%. The results of this experiment show that a chimpanzee can comprehend signed commands that he has never seen before. It also demonstrates, that in a communication system which allows for the production of complex novel combinations to express meanings that are understood by the users of the sys tem, it therefore possesses the property of productivity (Hockett 1958, 1959). The next study (Chown, Kimball, Couch, &amp; Fouts, in preparation) examined the active application of a syntactic system for a chimpanzee to express spatial relations between objects in the environment. In the expression of relations between objects, syntax is the essential property to express the proper meaning for the relation. The relation was expressed in this study by subject-pre position-location. The system was not formally complex, but it did incorporate all the essential aspects of language in a rudimentary form. Ally was also used as the subject in this experiment, but he was now five years old. He was taught the relations on, in , and under , by using physical objects (subjects and</page><page sequence="16">334 Sign Language Studies 13 locations) arranged in appropriate spatial relationships for the particular prepositions. He was then taught to describe the relationship using sign language. After training he was tested in a double-blind condition using novel relationships inte grated with familiar (training) relationships. For instance, a flower was placed on a pillow and the experimenter would ask Ally WHERE? Ally had to go around a partition and answer the question, but only Ally could see the objects. The experimen ter and an observer, who could not see what Ally was responding to, recorded his answer. In order for Ally to be correct he had to use the appropriate signs in the proper order. In testing, Ally used the proper prepositions correctly for familiar relations 84.9% of the time and 76.9% for novel re lations. He correctly expressed the locations for familiar relations 77.9% and for novel relations 64.3% or the time. He correctly expressed the total relationship for familiar relations 67.4% and for novel relations 50.0% of the time. Ally did not always include the subject in his description of the relation. This was not counted as an incorrect response, but if he did sign the subject, it had to be correct or the en tire relationship expressed was recorded as incorrect. Out of the 240 trials, he signed the entire relationship (subject, preposition, location) 44 times, and out of these 44 he was correct 42 times for a 95.5% level of accuracy. Also it is important to note that Ally's errors consisted entirely of labeling an incorrect subject, preposition, or location. He did not make any grammatical error by using in correct order. The subject, preposition, and location were always given in their proper positions for expressing the re lationship. This was true even when the novel relation was one in which a location used in training was now used as a subject in testing and placed in relation to an object that was originally used as a subject in training but was now used as a location in testing. This study demonstrates that a chimpanzee possesses the ability to express, in sign language, a change in meaning through specific structural recombinations specified by a set of grammatical rules. This supports the conclusion that a chimpanzee is capable of utilizing an active linguistic process.</page><page sequence="17">Fouts &amp; Mellgren 335 3 Observations and Anecdotes We will now consider some psychologically interesting phenomena, such as the subjective states or feelings of the subject and the truth or falseness of his statements. These are topics that have traditionally been problematic for psycholo gists in that it is difficult to integrate them into objective, behaviorally defined categories. Nevertheless, a number of interesting observations have been made which seem sugges tive, and therefore we include these observations as illus trations of apparently complex and subtle behaviors of which the chimpanzee is capable. Subjective states. A subjective state is an introspective given for humans. As with other phenomena that have not been examined comparatively, it is often considered to be strictly a human trait. At an empirical level we have not advanced much beyond Wilhelm Wundt in our dealing with this phenomenon. The main problem in dealing with a subjective state is that it is known from introspection and self-report. As a result it is a "private event" and we must usually rely on the subject's reporting on his particular state. Therefore, it is impossible to know whether other individuals are actually experiencing the same sensations as ourselves, even though they label them linguistically with the same descriptions. It is because of this that subjective states are difficult to verify by objec tive criteria. On way we humans assume that we have comparable sub jective states is by something referred to by clinical psycholo gists as empathy. This is not something easily dealt with at an empirical level. Perhaps the closest that the empirical sciences can come to defining a subjective state is by self reports from the individual reactions to similar stimuli; e.g. I burn myself on a stove and you do so also and we have a similar reaction; then we would probably assume that there are comparable sensations. Also, another important characteristic of being able to report an internal state and to relate this to other individuals' internal states is that it means that not only are we able to react to stimulus in ourselves, but also we are able to under stand to some degree how other people perceive their internal states. This would have the implication that the individual not only has a self-concept, which would be necessary in order to report an internal state, but also has a concept of other that is comparable to others'.</page><page sequence="18">336 Sign Language Studies 13 With animals we have been able to determine whether or not they have similar behavioral reactions to similar stimuli, but we have been unable to determine if they are able to relate their subjective experiences to our own. However, with a mutual mode of communication this previously unobtainable data is now made available by self report and reaction to another's similar external condition. For example, if person A has a cut on his hand and another person Β remarks that person A has a cut on his hand, we cannot reasonably assume that person Β correctly understands all the sensations that person A is sensing in regard to his wounded hand. But, because similar words are used to describe the stimulus, we assume that person Β may be attributing his own previous experiences with cuts to person A, even though the individual sensations may be quite different for each. Given these respon ses, we could say that person A is perceiving a subjective state himself and person Β is attempting to empathize with person A. However, neither can be sure that the other is aware of what he is really feeling. But in order to do this each person must have a self concept. This allows him to perceive his own state. Likewise, each must have a concept of other so that both can attribute perceptions they have subjectively of themselves to the other person. These two attributes are basic to subjective states. Therefore, if another animal is to have a subjective state, he must have a self concept and a concept of other. Gallup (1970) has found that chimpanzees have self concepts since they are able to recognize their own reflections in mirrors, but he failed to find this in monkeys. Do chimpanzees have subjective states and are they able to relate these to other organisms? Of course a mutual mode of communication is necessary for the chimpanzee-human relation to be comparable to that between two human beings. Presently we only have observational data to support the position that chimpanzees have and perceive subjective states. And, since this involves a self report of a private event, it is overtly in the same category as human reports because these are also reports of private events. The chimpanzees who have a sign for 'hurt' in their vocabularies use this sign to refer to cuts, sores, and other painful wounds. On one occasion Washoe was observed to use the HURT sign to refer to a presumably painful stomach.</page><page sequence="19">Fouts &amp; Mellgren 337 She had all the symptoms of intestinal flu. She had diarrhea, a temperature, flatulence, and was generally inactive. When an experimenter asked her in sign language: WHAT WRONG WITH YOU ? she responded by signing HURT to her stomach. There have been hundreds of occurrences of chimpanzees' using the HURT sign to refer to "hurts" on themselves as well as on their human companions and even on other animals such as cats. Some home-reared chimpanzees have even been ob served to sign HURT referring to a bandage a person was wearing to cover a cut. This may not be proof for subjective states in the chimpanzee, but the majority of evidence for them in humans is not any stronger, since in both cases it involves reporting a private event. Truth or lie ? In popular folklore it is usually assumed that animals do not engage in the deceitful behavior so often seen in man. This belief is, of course, based on a lack of evidence because of our previous inability to communicate in a meaning ful way with other members of the animal kingdom. We have recently observed a number of cases in which a chimpanzee has either lied or has shown that it could recognize a lie, or at least has displayed a behavior that would be interpreted as lying if it occurred in humans. Whether or not the ability to produce a lie and recognize a lie is a behavior that would develop in a chimpanzee's normal environment or if it is a function of our chimpanzees' contact with humans cannot be answered by our data, since any chimpanzee to this date that is capable of signing has also had extensive interaction with humans. But even if it is the result of the human contact, it still demonstrates that the chimpanzee has the capability to display this behavior, whereas other animals may not be able to do this with human contact. The following observations were made on a seven year old female chimpanzee that has been raised in species isolation in a human home since birth. Evidence that this chimpanzee has the capacity to recognize the truth from a lie was obtained in the context of a normal session giving her practice in correctly signing the names of objects and generally conversing with one of the student assistants. In the course of such a session the human experimenter will often ask the chimpanzee the question, WHAT THAT? indicating an object in the room. On this particular occasion the chimpanzee asked the experimenter, WHAT THAT? indicating a flowering plant hanging on the wall of the room.</page><page sequence="20">338 Sign Language Studies 13 Thinking that the chimpanzee wanted to examine the plant more closely, the assistant removed it from the wall so that it could be inspected more closely. The chimpanzee persisted in signing WHAT THAT? to the flower, so the experimenter finally signed THAT FLOWER. This began a game in which the chimpanzee was now the "experimenter" and the experimenter became the "pupil" required to name various objects in response to the chimpan zee's questions, WHAT THAT? The game continued with the human "pupil" correctly answering with the correct name for a number of objects (book, car, cup, piece of fruit, etc.). Tiring of this game·, the experimenter-"pupil" decided to lie to the inquisitive chimpanzee. When WHAT THAT? was asked of a hat, the experimenter answered BRUSH. As the student assistant described the situation, "She caught me instantly, looked at me, then signed'WHAT THAT? WHAT THAT?'again. I still replied 'BRUSH.1 She seemed a little confused, so I signed 'WHAT THAT?' to her. She immediately replied 'HAT', and seemed very pleased. " We would want to be cautions in reading too much into the anthropomorphic observations made by the assistant; how ever, the change in behavior as a function of the "mistake" is something which may have somewhat greater objectivity than normal. Working with a chimpanzee is a challenging situation and demands very careful observation of the mood of the subject. The strength and aggressive nature of the chimpanzee requires a continuous awareness — an ability to "read" the emotions and behavioral dispositions of the subject — merely to survive for mnrp than a fp.w ,ςρ.ς.ςΐοη.ς. When the chimpanzee was told that a lipstick tube was a STRING by the assistant, the chimpanzee did not sign 'WHAT THAT?' again, but merely signed 'THAT LIPSTICK', correcting the "error" made by the assistant. Somewhat later, the chim panzee asked WHAT THAT? about some sunglasses; the experi menter relpled, 'THAT CANDY'. This one bothered the chimpanzee, and no more reference was made to the sunglasses. Later on, the human experimenter asked the chimpanzee WHAT THAT? indicating the sunglasses. The chimpanzee answered incorrectly, calling the sunglasses a LISTEN (something that makes a dis tinctive noise). The experimenter would not accept this sign, and the chimpanzee correctly signed LOOK for the sunglasses. Some months after these observations the same chimpanzee was used as the subject in an experiment designed to investi gate simultaneously two cognitive psychological processes.</page><page sequence="21">Fouts &amp; Mellgren 339 The basic notion was to use three objects, one of which would be designated as the chimpanzee's and the others would belong to either one of two humans working with the chimpanzees. The objects were books, each as physically different from the other as possible. One experimenter, Roger, was to teach the chim panzee that book 1 was hers, book 2 was Roger's, and book 3 was Sue's. Sue, not being present during training on the owner ship of the books, and without knowing which book went with whom, was to test the chimpanzee merely by asking WHOSE THAT? for the different books. If this procedure were success ful, it would presumably bear on the chimpanzee's ability to learn and relate to stimuli not currently in the physical environ ment through the use of sign language. That is, if the subject correctly identified Sue's book in the test, at least some evidence for being able to learn in the absence of the physical referent would be provided since Sue was not present during training. Of course, more sophisticated procedures could then be developed for study of this sort of phenomen (e.g. Fouts, Chown, &amp; Goodin 1975). In addition, the experiment was designed to show that a chimpanzee can develop a sense of belongingness — this is mine, that is yours. The experiment failed to provide the kind of evidence we had hoped for. The chimpanzee responded satisfactorily when being taught the relationship between books and pri mates, showing adequate performance to the question WHOSE THAT? when Roger was present and doing the training. Pro blems were anticipated, however, when after one session, Roger was writing notes on the session and noticed the chim panzee looking at the books and repeatedly signing THAT LUCY'S to his book. Roger immediately moved toward the chimpanzee to correct what he thought was an error or faulty memory. Before he had reached the chimpanzee, she correc ted herself, correctly signing THAT ROGER'S to the apparently preferred book that had arbitrarily been chosen as Rogers's. The sense of possession seemed unmistakable in the chimpan zee; unfortunately the human and the chimpanzee conceptions of which book belonged to whom were not congruent. Indeed, in the test with only Sue present, the chimpanzee called Sue's book LUCY'S BOOK . She also called Lucy's book LUCY'S BOOK. Thus we cannot provide evidence of the anticipated sort for the cognitive ability of the chimpanzee to learn about things not currently present in the environment, although we feel certain that the failure to demonstrate this ability reflects</page><page sequence="22">340 Sign Language Studies 13 more on the inadequacies of the human experimenters to provide an appropriate situation than on any cognitive shortcomings in the subject. It is of some interest that following the testing session (we actually used three sessions in which Sue asked the chim panzee WHOSE THAT? for each book in each session), Sue, the human experimenter who was "blind" as to what responses were correct, was able to correctly identify which book be longed to each primate. In the case of Roger's book, this is not surprising, since the chimpanzee had correctly called it Roger's book. Sue was quite sure, however, that one of the books was supposed to be hers and the other was supposed to be the chimpanzee's. The experimenter's confidence in knowing which book was hers and which was the chimpanzee's relates back to our earlier discussion of understanding and having a sensitivity for the behavioral disposition and mood or feelings of the chimpanzee in order to be able to work effectively with the animals. The chimpanzee was lying to Sue, and the human experimenter knew it, but the probability of the experimenter's guessing the correct book-to-primate relationship is 0.5 merely by chance. Therefore, we would not want to take this experiment as definitive evidence regarding lying in the chim Kilt it ic ci ιγτγτο cti A final piece of evidence is tied less closely with sign language and involves more natural communication processes. In addition, this observation is important in that it indicates that one chimpanzee may lie to another, rather than lying to a human. In the interests of sanitation it is often necessary to use hoses to clean various areas of the Institute. As might be expected, the chimpanzees are interested in using the hoses for their own enjoyment. It was soon discovered by the human cleaners that an effective means to retrieve a stolen hose from a chimpanzee is to make alarm barks, imitating the natural communication process of the chimpanzee. The result of such alarm barks is that the chimpanzee with the hose will drop it and look for safety. We have observed two male chimpanzees, Booee and Bruno, in a situation which resulted in exactly the same kind of behavior. The hose was on a small island with a cement hut used as living quarters for the chimpanzees staying on the island. Bruno originally had the hose and was playing with it. Booee physically took the hose away from Bruno, but a short while later Bruno gave an alarm bark which</page><page sequence="23">Fouts &amp; Mellgren 341 sent Booee scrambling up to the top of the hut without the hose. Bruno, showing no fear or indication of any threatening situ ation, retrieved the hose for his own use and presumed enjoy ment. It seemed clear that Bruno was lying when he made the alarm bark. No danger could be seen, and Bruno's own behav ior gave no indication of impending danger. This has been observed to occur three times. The three observations presented in this section indicate that chimpanzees may lie to humans and to other chimpanzees, that they may lie about the possession of objects, and that they may lie by using sign language or natural chimpanzee communication processes. Whether the chimpanzees would lie if man were removed from their environment is an open ques tion. At least the folklore that only man is capable of falsehoods and improper behavior seems questionable given the present observations. In addition, these observations indicate a more highly developed cognitive capacity than is often assumed for the chimpanzee. Of course, limitations on the cognitive functioning of organisms are usually based on a lack of evi dence, and therefore it should not be surprising that with further observation and study such limitations tend to dis appear. 4 Summary The conceptualization presented in this paper, along with the interpretation of some of the data, would seem to be the basis for some degree of controversy. Particularly our specu lation on the subjective state of an organism and its ability to detect true and false statements is open to considerable dis cussion. Our purpose in the presentation of this material is twofold. First we hope to stimulate further thought on these difficult problems. Second, we hope that the observations we present may broaden the horizons of the reader with respect to the functioning of the chimpanzee as well as other animals. The data concerning commands and relationships between the objects which are the subject of the command and concerning the naming of fruits and vegetables seem less controversial, although every bit as interesting, in our opinion. These data do seem to indicate a rather high level of cognitive function ing on the part of the chimpanzee. Indeed, it seems that the more freedom we allow in our experiments for the subject to participate, rather than constraining the subject either in a</page><page sequence="24">342 Sign Language Studies 13 confining apparatus or experimental procedure, the more inter esting are the results, and the more impressive is the evidence for apparently higher-order kinds of cognitive operations in the chimpanzee. The long term significance of this observation should not be overlooked. When our orientation is towards the subject as a reactive organism, then our experimental appar atus or procedure is likely to be confining. If the organism is an active stimulus-seeking subject rather than a stimulus reacting subject, then procedures which artificially place constraints on the organism will produce data which reflects these constraints. This is, of course, one of the main advan tages of using sign language as a communication medium. The spontaneity and diversity as well as the potential for novel utterances it allows are all part of this program of research, and presumably the data and observations presented here strengthen this argument.</page><page sequence="25">Fouts &amp; Mellgren 343 REFERENCES Altmann, S.A. 1967 The Structure of Primate Social Communication, in Social Communication among Primates, S.A.
