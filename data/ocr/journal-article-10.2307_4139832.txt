<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pagan Theology: Paganism as a World Religion. By Michael York. New York University Press, 2003. 238 pages. $38.00. Michael York postulates that pagan religious expression is not limited to pre-Christian European religions, that is, the ones typically associated with the term "pagan." Paganism shares a "natural kinship" with the following religions from around the world: tribal religion, shamanism, Shinto, spiritism, American Indian spirituality, Afro-Latin and Afro-American spirituality, Western Paganism, and Chinese folk or traditional religion (6). These religions generally do not easily fit established religious models. Extrapolating from various sociological religious demographics, York concludes that 5-6% of the world's population practices some form of paganism (10). Greco-Roman religions serve as the basis for the paradigm of paganism. York relies on Roman religion to define that paradigm because it is one of his areas of expertise and publication (he published The Roman Festival Calendar of Numa Pompilius in 1986 [Peter Lang]). Paganism focuses on "cult acts" rather than formularies such as dogmas and creeds (12). It is a religion of action rather than belief. It reflects local cultural and ethnographic characteristics. Its rituals revolve around the life cycle of birth, death, and regeneration, thus making it a humanistic religion. Additional essential elements of paganism are multiple deities of two genders, magic, ceremony, supernatural immanence, and an anthropomorphic affinity between the divine and the human (14). York explains</page><page sequence="2">592 Journal of the American Academy of Religion some of these criteria at the outset and defines the rest as they are introduced throughout the book. At the end of the first chapter he summarizes paganism with two traits: a "this-world attitude" and acceptance of spirit in matter (65). The three chapters of the book study paganism as religion, practice, and the- ology. The first and longest chapter searches for pagan elements present in the religions mentioned previously. York does not apply the entire pagan paradigm to each of these examples, although he does point out correspondences between each religion and the prescribed paradigm. For example, he makes it clear that Chinese folk religion and Japanese Shinto share traits, but he does not precisely clarify how either of these religions reflects the larger pagan model. In a similar vein, the similarities and differences between tribal animistic spirits and the Greek gods are not elucidated. Such discrepancies probably indicate that corre- spondences between individual examples and the pagan paradigm exist in broad terms, but not in the details. Readers need to evaluate the material York presents and draw their own conclusions. The section on "American Indians" is interesting and controversial. It includes spirituality in the title but immediately discusses religion without distin- guishing it from spirituality. York's categories become quite fluid in this section: Native American religions include Shamanism, which should be considered an indigenous tribal religion. Since they survive in western society and also oppose the dominant religion, York gives them their own section. Moreover, westerners commonly consider Native American religion as pagan, although practitioners reject this label (45). The discussion very quickly incorporates the autochtho- nous religions of the American continents in general, including the extinct Aztecs, Mayas, and Incas. It concludes with Christian adoption of Native American elements. The presence of pagan elements surviving as folk rituals or countercul- ture becomes a thematic focus of the book. The presentation of contemporary western paganism is important because York has done extensive research in this area and published previously on the subject (The Emerging Network in 1995 [Rowman and Littlefield] and Historical Dictionary of New Age Movements in 2003 [Scarecrow Press]). Some of my own post-doctoral work has been in this area, including discussions via correspon- dence with York. York provides a simplified framework for categorizing mod- ern paganism. Neopaganism is an identifiable religion with a Celtic heritage, propagated by Gerald Gardner: simply put, it is Wicca and all its variants. Recopaganism (reconstructed paganism) consciously revives older pagan reli- gions and typically includes ethnic cultural elements. British, Germanic, Hellenic, and Egyptian religions belong to this category. Geopaganism refers to the pagan elements that have survived in western culture as popular religion and practice, either deliberate or unconscious. Examples would include toasts or "tossing a coin into a fountain." York also includes such greetings as "good morning" and the like in this category, although similar greetings exist in many cultures around the globe (60). York describes modern paganism with lucid detail. The beginning of the second chapter curiously claims the first chapter, titled "Paganism as Religion," is about theology, although the third chapter is called</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 593 "Paganism as Theology." The first chapter examines beliefs, practices, social structures, and manifestations of ultimate reality. In the second chapter York argues the "human urge to express honor and homage" is essentially pagan (66). He distinguishes cultic behavior from magic. The former is ritual veneration, whereas the latter attempts to reorder reality by bartering with (or coercing) the supernatural to conform it to human will, typically via some form of sacrifice. Worship, York claims, is always pagan, whereas magic is found in many forms and religions (68). He examines pagan practices in Hinduism, Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism, Christianity (and Judaism, under the heading of Chris- tianity), and Islam, as well as in modern western society. York reintroduces two old Latin terms, animus and anima, as important concepts for the study of pagan traits. He does not mean the Jungian definitions. Animus represents the "rational soul, reason, intellect, mind, consciousness, or will power," whereas amina is "the vital principle, the breath of life, the animal principle or life, or even life itself' (94). Pagan religious expression embraces both forms equally; there is no hierarchy between them. Interaction between both forms is, in fact, a prerequisite for pagan religious expression. In practical terms, this means paganism in all its varieties experiences life as affirming joy, accepts the material world as animated, and does not reject the earth (94). This chapter contains a wealth of accounts from York's Asian travels of 1981-82. First-hand descriptions of Hindu and Buddhist daily and seasonal rituals in their native context include interpretation about their tenuous relationship to official religious systems. York's position is that popular beliefs and rituals are pagan, having little to do with the dominant religion. Pagan elements inimical to the prevailing religion are not only tolerated but also incorporated into the governing religious tradition. Thailand, for example, practices Buddhism with significant Hindu and aboriginal animistic substrata, whereas Tantra is a wide- spread counter-Buddhist practice in Tibet, China, and Japan. The Himalayan coun- tries practice local shamanism incorporated into either Buddhism or Hinduism. The Catholic and Orthodox Christian traditions integrate pagan practices, festivals, and deities under Christian guise. Pagan theophagy, the eating of God, has, of course, become Christian communion. Islam prays facing a pagan shrine, the Kaaba. The section on agnosticism, atheism, and secularism looks for vestiges of paganism in the secular West. Protestantism paved the way for secularism in its rejection of Catholic paganism. Modern humanism continues the pagan humanistic focus, albeit rejecting the supernatural. York sees various expres- sions of paganism in the following phenomena: drugs, alcohol, the theater, con- certs, movies, cinema stars, sports, hero worship, Haight-Ashbury, and New Orleans Jazz. The operatic prima donnas or Hollywood stars, both as goddesses, and such quasi-Christian festivals as Mardi Gras revive the pagan emotional ritual tradition lost in a secular society. Noteworthy are the Roman pagan roots of the fundamental western devotional observations. The very brief final chapter, "Paganism as Theology," serves as the titular chapter of the book. York provides the concluding definition of an ideal, absolute paganism: "an affirmation of interactive and polymorphic sacred relationship by the individual or community with the tangible, sentient and nonempirical" (162).</page><page sequence="4">594 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Paganism is polymorphic, adapting to individual human and local community needs in many different forms. Its breadth includes humanistic, naturalistic, and theistic sensibilities. York categorizes religions based on a dichotomous contin- uum from life-affirming paganism to world-denying gnosticism. All religions fall somewhere in this spectrum. He also addresses modern misconceptions about and negative appearances of paganism, namely, Satanism, fascism, and racism. In concluding the book he once again redefines paganism: it is a root human religion of celebration and service with the sacred values of honor, trust, and friendship (168). All religions have inherited something from the primal human source of paganism. An extensive bibliography and index complete the book. York has collected a great diversity of global religious information to compare and contrast the fundamental and universal religious elements they contain. This appears to be his life work. He offers many ideas to consider, some of them controversial. The study of religion usually focuses on the "official" forms of religions, whereas anthropology examines the behavior of the people, generally avoiding significant interpretation. York combines the two approaches. He pro- vides a bold and daring answer to the proverb, "Tell me how you pray, and I will tell you what you believe." doi:10.1093/jaarel/lfi070 Vilius Rudra Dundzila Harry S.
