<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BALTIC PSALTERY AND MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS OF GODS AND DEVILS Stephen Reynolds , University of Oregon Except for an entry in the Lithuanian-German glossary of musical in- struments written on a blank page of the Bible translation by Jonas Bretkūnas (1590), the earliest certain literary reference to the Baltic psaltery is found in the Annals of the Riga College of the Society of Jesus for the year 1612, published in 1613. These report a gathering of witches in the (Lutheran) Cathedral at Riga, at which the Devil himself presided. The Jesuits heard from their informant that an orchestra played for this occa- sion, which included all sorts of musical instruments excepta cochlea lotavica quinqué choráis gaudens , quam Dei cochlea simplices vocant; haec sola ab fuit-" except the five-stringed Latvian kokle, which simple people call 'God s kokle it alone was not present."1 This passage must refer to some belief regarding the Baltic psaltery (Lat- vian kokle). In Baltic languages, the name of the biblical God (Lithuanian DievaSy Latvian Dievs) was originally that of the sky-god of the pre- Christian religion; and the word for "devil" (Lithuanian Velnias , Latvian Veins) is derived from Velinasf the name of the pre-Christian god of the dead.2 The belief in question may well go back to pre-Christian myth; it can hardly be attributed to Christianity as disseminated by German churchmen. By the middle of the nineteenth century, the Baltic psaltery (Estonian kannel) was thought to be extinct in Estonia. But in 1875 Mihkel Veske, travelling in Setumaa (near Lake Peipsi), discovered that it was still com- mon among the Setus, a distinctive group of eastern Estonians. He recorded some Setu lore about the instrument, including the following mythical legend: J BS, Vol XIV ' No. 1 (Spring 1983) 5</page><page sequence="2">6 Journal of Baltie Studies The harp [Setu kannõl' is said to have been made by God himself. God IJum- mal) and the Old Evil One ( Vana halb) . . . once made a wager, which of the two could invent a musical instrument first. Straightway God took a leaf from the tree, put it to his mouth, and piped on it; but the Old Evil One began to make a bagpipe, and worked on it for some days, while God happily played on the leaf. When at last the Old Evil One was ready, they played for the wager, the one on the leaf and the other on the bagpipe, but God's flute was more beautiful and had been finished earlier; so God won the bet. Again they wagered which of the two could finish an instrument sooner, and whose instrument would play more beautifully. God went to work on a harp, the Old Evil One on a horn. God was ready sooner, and began to play his instrument while the Old Evil One was still working on his. When the Old Evil One was ready, they played again for the wager, but God played much more beautifully and won the bet. AU musical instruments (all, that is, known to the Estonians there), also the accordion, are said to be made by the Evil One, only the leaf on the tree and the harp have received their sound from God.3 The contestants in this account are similar to the figures already discuss- ed. Setu Jummaļ Standard Estonian Jumal Finnish «/uraa/a- 'God'- was originally the name of a pre-Christian deity, apparently a sky-god, attested as early as 1026; Vana halb is a malicious forest spirit with some traits in common with Velinas.4 The correspondence between the Jesuit report and the Setu account is too good to be accidental. We may assume that the belief whose existence we inferred is essentially represented in Veske's narrative. The latter is a dualistic creation story. Such stories, especially relating to the creation of the world and of animals, are well known; there are a number from Estonia, and a variant of one of these, in fact, also involves the devil's inventing the bagpipe: [At the creation, the devil imitated God and made horses, cows, and goats, but botched the job and produced imperfect animals. To keep them from straying, he invented the bagpipe and played on it. After a while, however, the animals wandered off and joined God's creatures in their stalL God cor- rected their imperfections, and then told the devil that he could reclaim his animals if he could identify them. This he could no longer do. So he was left with only the bagpipe with which to comfort himself; therefore, many peo- ple regard the bagpipe as the devil's bellows.]5 Aside from these examples from Estonia, accounts of the dualistic crea- tion of instruments, or even of dualisticiereation involving a single instru- ment, are not easy to locate. I can offer only one of each. The former is from Rumania: When God was on earth, he pastured sheep. He made the flute and put it under the wool of a sheep; when the sheep were being shorn, the shepherds came upon it. The devil wanted to make something also, so he made a fid- dle, but so that no one would find it, he hid it in a goat. As the goat went with her tail up, a gypsy caught sight of the neck of the fiddle and took it out. Because the flute was made by God, it is blest, so that its song might be pleasant; but the fiddle, a work of the devil, so that he might be beaten with it.6</page><page sequence="3">The Baltic Psaltery 7 Here the group God-flute-sheep-shepherds is contrasted with the group Devil-violin-goat-gypsy. These groupings are not in themselves surprising. Sheep and shepherds are traditionally positively regarded more or less everywhere, and not least in Rumania. The link between shepherd and flute is ancient and widespread. The goat is commonly associated with the Devil, as is the violin wherever it exists, and the gypsy is generally regarded as a devilish fellow. The Rumanian peasant would know the violin only as an instrument of gypsy (or Jewish) musicians. In contrast to the Baltic sources, the instrument of God in Rumania is not a stringed instrument but a wind instrument. A myth of the Transbaikal Tungus includes a single instrument in a dualistic creation account. It describes God as forming the land and sea. When God stepped down upon the earth he met the devil, . . . who also desired to create a world. Thus a dispute arose between God and the deviL The devil wished to destroy God's earth and broke the latter's twelve-stringed musical instrument. [They compete to cause a pine tree to grow; God wins, and the devil concedes.!7 We can determine neither the provenance of the myth nor the significance of the instrument, which is somehow involved in creation. And the devil does not appear to have his own instrument here. Other evidence for opposing musical instruments of God and the Devil is scanty. The best is furnished by a Latgalian saying published by S. Ulano wska: Skřipka ir nu vaina, The fiddle is from the devil, kūkļe nu Diva, the kokle from God, garmonika nu cītumnīka, the accordion from the prisoner, stabule nu gona, the flute from the shepherd, bubjeninš nu suņa.8 the little drum (?tambourine) from the dog. Here again, Dīvs and valns may represent the pre-Christian sky-god and god of the dead. Here again, the Baltic psaltery (Latgalian kūkļe) is at- tributed to God resp. the sky-god. We have already noted the commonplace associations of violin with Devil and flute with shepherd. The attributing of the accordion and drum are a bit puzzling, but need not detain us here. It is the first two figures who are significant for our inquiry, and they fit quite well the pattern established by the witnesses already cited. It so happens that there is a parallel saying from Estonia: The bagpipe was invented by the devil, the violin by the angels; so dancing to the latter is considered less sinful by strict believers.9</page><page sequence="4">8 Journal of Baltie Studies We have already encountered the bagpipe-Devil association, but it is rather surprising to find the violin ranged on the side of the angels, in view of the consensus of Latvians, Rumanians, and more or less everyone else that it belongs to the other party. What the devil has happened? In a legend from Hiiumaa (Dago), maritime Estonia, the mysterious play- ing of a bagpipe causes people to abandon the instrument for the violin. The collector, Karl Russwurm, explains: The bagpipe, as an invention of Taara, . . . was uncommonly beloved everywhere in Estonia .... [W]e must accept a connection between it and the old heathen folk customs and cults. Therefore later the invention of the heathen instrument was ascribed to the Devil, and the . . . famous Pastor Lithander on Rückö (+ 1789) called it the hellsack or the Devil's bellows, which, together with superstitious conceptions, allowed the bagpipe gradually to fall into discredit.10 Russwurm unfortunately gives no documentation for "Taara" as inventor of the bagpipe. Taara poses some complex problems, requiring some fur- ther discussion. Four mythical figures are to be considered here. The first is the sky-god, who among a number of Finno-Ugrian peoples is known by such names as Turms (among the Lapps), Tūrēm or Torem (among the Ob-Ugrians), and the like. This circumstance suggests an ancient Finno-Ugrian deity who could have been known to the Estonians under a similar name. Second, the Chronicle of Henry of Livonia mentions in several places (24:5; 30:4; twice in 30:5) "Tharapita" as the chief god of the western Estonians of the twelfth- thirteenth centuries AD. Henry gives little specific information on the god's attributes. The name has been interpreted as an invocation: Taara avita ! 'Taara, help!' Taara, as the god s name, is a hypothetical reconstruction. Third, the Indo-European thunder-god was prominent in iron-age Scan- dinavia under the now universally known name of Thor. Fourth, Estonian folklore of the seventeenth-nineteenth centuries knew a figure named Tooru or Ta(a)ra, to whom Thursday was sacred, and who was associated with the bagpipe. The problem is the relationship among these figures. Writers of the na- tional romantic school tended to see here an ancient Finno-Ugrian deity who became the chief or even sole god of the Estonians before the German crusaders' conquest, and who remained known to folk tradition down to their own day. They questioned any connection with Thor. The hypothesis of a Taara-monotheism failed of acceptance (and rightly so). Schroeder sug- gested a coalescence of the old Finno-Ugrian deity with Thor; Eisen's views remained close to those of the national romantics. Loorits doubted that any Finno-Ugrian deity was involved. In connection with Tharapita, he accepted a borrowing of the name of Thor, but not of his attributes; the role of Tooru he derived from customs associated with Thor but brought to Estonia at a relatively late date by already Christian Swedish immigrants, so that Thor-Tooru was never an active deity of the Estonians. Paulson questioned</page><page sequence="5">The Baltic Psaltery 9 even the etymological connection between Tharapita and Thor. Our direct concern here is only with the figure of Tooru; his derivation from Thor seems clear enough. His connections with the deity reported by Henry of Livonia, and with the Finno-Ugrian sky-god, are beyond the scope of the present investigation, since we have no evidence linking these last-named figures to the bagpipe.11 A connection between the bagpipe and the thunder-god has also been sought in the numerous Estonian variants of AaTh 1 148B, The Ogre Steals the Thunder's Instrument However, in his careful study of these variants Loorits established that, while the instrument is said to be blown (so that a stringed or percussion instrument is excluded), folk tradition was satisfied to speak only of the pill 'musical instrument' of the thunder-god (called not Taara or Tooru but usually Pikne or Pikker).12 Thus, we have in reality only a few comparatively recent sources, which however do enable us to affirm the association of the bagpipe with Tooru (=Thor) and to recognize that the clergy sought to identify it as the devil's instrument, evidently because of that association.13 Several other Estonian legends reflect the pastors' condemnation of the bagpipe. In one, a malicious sea spirit leads an entire village to death by playing the bagpipe, causing their neighbors to abandon the instrument. This legend is known also in Sweden and Finland, where the instrument is usually the violin; in maritime Estonia, it was later used against the bow- ed lyre, a folk instrument singled out for the wrath of revivalists in the 1870s.14 Other relevant narratives include one from Ludza in which the devil (must- "The Black One") disturbs a wedding party by playing the bagpipe, and two more from Russwurm 's collection, one in which the Devil's son plays the bagpipe mysteriously, and another in which a little devil who plays the instrument leads people astray in a swamp at night,15 an activi- ty characteristic of Vana halb in Estonia, vadātājs in Latvia, and Velnias in Lithuania.16 The violin spread at the expense of the bagpipe, but no doubt also of the kannel The clergy must have preferred the violin, an in- strument, in their eyes, of civilized, Christian nations and of Kultur . The kannel vanished progressively, replaced by the violin in actual use, and, we suggest, in the saying recorded by Wiedemann. Subsuming Wiedemann's angels under the heading "God," we may tabulate the sources surveyed so far as follows: God Devil Riga Jesuits kokle all other instruments Veske- 1st round leaf bagpipe Veske- 2nd round kannel horn (and all other instruments) Ulanowska kokle violin Miháilescu flute violin Wiedemann violin bagpipe</page><page sequence="6">10 Journal of Baltie Studies The bagpipe appears in the "Devil" column (twice), and the violin in the "God" column only in Estonia. This may be explained as a result of the pastors' campaign to identify Tooru with the Devil and to persuade the Estonians to renounce a 11 his works and ways, a campaign that had some success,17 and whose impact seems to have been felt as far away as Or- thodox Setumaa, and even Catholic Ludza, but which was a historical development peculiar to Estonia. The tendency to ascribe Tooru 's attributes to the Devil is, in fact, contradictory to the dominant pattern of folk nar- rative and belief throughout the Scandinavian and Baltic areas, where the thunder-god and the devil are not only clearly distinguished, but regarded as inveterate enemies.18 We commented earlier on the commonplace association of the Devil with the goat. But in pre-Christian northern Europe the goat was associated with the thunder-god, and it is probably no accident that both instruments specifically ascribed to the Devil in our Estonian sources are caprine in nature.19 Aside from the sources already adduced, Baltic folk literature does not provide much evidence for a special association of the Baltic psaltery with the sky-god, or of some other instrument with the god of the dead or another demonic figure. The daina texts, in particular, do not offer much support. I have found so far no instances of mythical figures making musical in- struments. Nor have I found any such figures playing the Baltic psaltery (Lithuanian kanklés) in the Lithuanian dainos. There are some Latvian dainas in which mythical figures play the kokle , namely: three angels (who may have supplanted indigenous mythical figures); the mid-summer deity Jānis; Saule; the Dieva dēli or one of them; and even the Velna māte , which seems at odds with the Dieva kokle tradition.20 I have found Dievs as kokle- player so far only in a single dainai In the realm of the folktale, we encounter mostly international material. When the Baltic psaltery appears, it is often simply a local counterpart of foreign instruments such as the harp. So it is not surprising that most tales involving the Baltic psaltery are unrelated to the Dieva kokle tradition, and that some seem contrary to it. As the object of a dangerous quest, the instrument may be in the possession of a witch or ogre;22 it may be given as ransom to the hero by a devil;23 and in at least one case a marvelous kokle is made by the Devil.24 The Devil may engage a kokle- player to entertain at a celebration in Hell.25 Some folktales, however, exhibit a more positive relation to the Dieva kokle tradition. A tale published by J. Krēsliņš may be abstracted as follows: [A youth rescues from a swamp an old man who turns out to be God (Dievs) in disguise, and who rewards him with a marvelous kokle that delights the living, the dead, the animals, and the fish. After a time, evil foreigners throw him into the dungeon of a castle by the sea. The kokle now sounds sadly; water maidens come to listen. After long years, the captors bring him out</page><page sequence="7">The Baltic Psaltery 11 to entertain them at a feast. But now the instrument sounds angry and threatening. Plūdonis, the sea god (here identified with Dievs) sends a great storm to destroy the captors and their castle, and fetches the hero to his realm to live happily.]26 In this version, a number of details of the story- here presented as a local legend- seem not quite authentic. The compiler is known to have "im- proved" folk material, and one hesitates to rely on his evidence. Fortunately, a more convincing version with good credentials is readily accessible: [The hero rescues God in disguise and receives the kokle as above. He delights animals, birds and fish with it. He arrives at a king's castle. The kokle players there, jealous of his superior ability, throw him into the dungeon to starve. He is fed by the Wind Maidens. The king orders him released to entertain guests. His jealous rivals hurl him from the walls into the sea, but the Wind Maidens rescue him. A storm destroys the castle and its inhabitants. The hero returns home happily.]27 We can affirm that the motif of a marvelous kokle as a gift irom Dievs appears in folk literature. However, the motif is not specific to the kokle . In another tale, the foolish brother rescues God and is rewarded with a magic flute that enables him to keep the devil's flock together; the clever brother refuses to rescue God, receives no flute, loses the flock, and is punished.28 So the Dieva kokle tradition is reflected in folktales, but it is not a strong reflection, for another sort of instrument can equally appear in similar context. A sort of mythical legend on the origin of the kanklès was published by Veckenstedt: [A Žemaitian musician named Abulkis, wanting to compete with others at a feast, prays to Laima for a new, unfamiliar instrument. She presents the request to Perkūnas, who has charge of all musical instruments. He refuses, saying that the Žemaitians should be satisfied with the lyre (which he had given them earlier); otherwise it would be merrier on earth than in heaven. Laima, however, steals the kankles for Abulkis; he wins the prize, and disseminates the instrument among his- people.29 Such an association of the Baltic psaltery and of musical instruments in general with the thunder-god Perkūnas/Pērkons would be significant for the present inquiry. However, this narrative, together with other such material published by Veckenstedt, must be rejected as egregious fakelore. I have found no authentic tradition linking the thunder-god with the Baltic psaltery. This completes the presentation of sources relevant to the Dieva kokle theme that I have found to date. The remainder of the discussion will consist in an examination of some comparative material and some sug- gestions about the history of the traditions. Let us return to the dualistic creation story recorded by Veske. Almost half a century ago Loorits included such stories among the Baltic folk nar- ratives traceable to the Byzantine cultural sphere.30 He regarded them as</page><page sequence="8">12 J ournal of Baltic S tudies "Oriental" in origin and agreed with those writers who identify the Bogomil sect of the Balkans as the transmitters. How complex the issue is can be seen from Lixfeld's monograph on the dualistic creation of animals.31 For our purposes, we need only note that these stories in the Baltic area can- not be dated before the tenth century AD at the earliest. Loorits is thus far correct in regarding the non-dualistic Finnish-Estonian runic poem on "The Birth of the Kantele" as "more primitive."32 One must recall, however, that in the Setu account J ummal and the Vana halb make their instruments just as any peasant would do; they do not employ divine or magical powers, such as would be required for the crea- tion of the earth or of animals; nor do they make them from exotic materials, as is commonly the case in the Finnish-Estonian runic poem. Moreover, the contest involves not only the making, but also the playing of the in- struments. We may distinguish from the dualistic creation itself two motifs: first, different musical instruments are invented by, and/or are specifically associated with, different and perhaps rival mythical figures; and second, two such figures engage in a contest, each playing his characteristic instrument. In Greek myth, the one-day-old Hermes, having stolen cows from his half-brother Apollo, invents the lyra (a small lyre),33 making the soundbox from a tortoise shell.34 The infant cattle rustler appeases Apollo by giv- ing him the instrument, and in some accounts it is this lyre with which Apollo is chiefly associated. Other sources distinguish it from the kithara (a more developed, professional lyre; a third name for such instruments is phorminx) invented by Apollo himself.35 What is consistent is that in- struments of the lyre type are associated with Apollo, a sun-god, and also with his half-brother Hermes, another son of Zeus and member of the "heavenly family of gods of the ancient Greeks," the Olympians. As for the aulos (a kind of pipe, usually translated "flute"), in the best known account Athena invents it. Puffing her cheeks to play it makes her face look funny, so she throws it away with a curse. The satyr Marsyas finds it and teaches himself to play it in defiance of her anger.36 This is, however, probably a propagandistic Athenian revision of an account in which Marsyas himself invents it.37 The syrinx (pipe) is sometimes attributed to Hermes,38 but usually to his son Pan. A well-known story has Pan pursuing the water-nymph Syrinx. At the last minute, she escapes by having herself transformed into a reed (motif D224). Pan makes from the reed the instrument that he names for her.39 Thus wind instruments, although some sources attribute their inven- tion to Olympians, are chiefly associated with, and in other sources invented by, the decidely non-Olympian, sylvan Hermids, whose tragoeideia was subsequently to be appropriated by Christian tradition for the popular depiction of Satan (G303.3.3.1.6, Devil in form of goat.) We also find contests. Marsyas, having mastered the aulos, is daring</page><page sequence="9">The Baltic Psaltery 13 enough to challenge Apollo to a musical contest, and foolish enough to ac- cept terms that placed the loser totally at the victor's mercy. Apollo, unable to beat the satyr in a straightforward playing, resorts to a device: either playing the instrument upside down,40 or singing as he plays, 41 neither of which is possible with the aulos. Thus he wins, and hangs and flays the unfortunate Marsyas. For a time, thereafter he will not tolerate the flute. However, a shepherd finds the instrument of Marsyas and dedicates it to Apollo, and the musician Sacadas, at Delphi, plays the hymn to Apollo on it; thus the god is appeased and reconciled to the instrument.42 Apollo also competes against Pan and his syrinx. He wins this contest too, apparently without resorting to questionable tactics. The sufferer on this occasion is King Midas, who is in the audience and complains that the decision should have gone the other way. Apollo punishes him by giving him asses' ears. He hides the ears under a Phrygian cap and swears to secrecy the one person who has to be taken into confidence- his barber. Bursting with the delicious gossip, the barber digs a hole in a deserted field, whispers the secret into it, and fills it up again. Reeds grow on the spot, and the following year they betray the secret by whispering to passers-by: "Midas has asses' ears!"43 Myths involving Pan thus contain two motifs- the innocent maiden transformed into a plant, from which a musical instrument is made to perpetuate her voice, and the plant that reveals a secret- which together remind us of the tale (or ballad) of the Singing Bone (AaTh 780), 44 a tale type directly relevant to the Baltic psaltery, but into which we cannot go here. Rather, we will end our survey of Greek myths with Plato's dictum that of the musical instruments only the lyra and kithara should be tolerated, with the syrinx being permitted to shepherds in the countryside. He accompanies this prescription with the statement that it is not strange to prefer Apollo and his instruments to Marsyas and his instruments.45 These myths vary in age. The story of the death of Marsyas is doubtless quite old; the tale of Syrinx is probably a late Alexandrian romance. The two motifs that we were seeking appear throughout this material, however. We can expand our table, with some change of terminology (who would be so pitiless as to list poor Marsyas as a devil?). Let us distinguish this time two classes, "upstairs" and "downstairs." upstairs downstairs Jesuits kokle all other instruments Ulanowska kokle violin Veske- 1st round leaf bagpipe (and all other instruments, Veske- 2nd round kannel horn incl. accordion) Wiedemann violin bagpipe Mihāilescu flute violin Apollo vs. Marsyas kithara aulos Apollo vs. Pan kithara syrinx</page><page sequence="10">14 Journal of Baltie Studies The Marsyas myth doubtless reflects a conflict, with a cultic aspect, bet- ween lyre-players and flute-players. Possibly these are Greeks and non- Greeks. The former, in any event, win, and belatedly come to tolerate the flute. Our sense of justice is somewhat assuaged by the observation that Marsyas has his revenge in Rumania, at least. Otherwise, plucked strings go upstairs and wind instruments downstairs. The parvenu violin goes downstairs too, except on one occasion, when the pastors in Estonia per- mit it to sneak upstairs. The rule abides the exceptions' proof. Returning to the Baltic sources, we concluded that the dualistic crea- tion story, as recorded by Veske, is probably of medieval origin. A number of features found in it and in the related material are attested much earlier in the eastern Mediterranean area (which has bequeathed us ancient writings), and may also be quite old in the Baltic area (which has not). The role of the Baltic psaltery does have significant similarities to that of the lyre in Mediterranean antiquity, and supernatural powers are ascribed to it in the Finnish-Estonian kantele poem, which is quite old. We have also noted that Latvian tradition contrasts instruments of Dievs and Veins , and have suggested that it may be proper to see here the sky-god and god of the dead of the ancient Indo-European Baltic religion. If this is correct, it would put the Baltic material in a somewhat different perspective compared with the Greek, for these are the two great gods of Dumezil's "first function." The connection of Dievs with the kokle may be ancient, but what instrument the old god of the dead may have had before the violin arrived is hard to say. Was there perhaps a three-functional struc- ture of musical instruments? Was the bagpipe connected with the second function and the flute with the third?46 The thing is not impossible. The curious saying recorded by Ulanowska deserves further study: 4 The fiddle is from the devil ( valns ), the kokle from God IDfus), the accordion from the prisoner, the flute from the shepherd, the drum from the dog." The list descends from supernatural to human beings and ends with an animal. It also begins with- we suggest- two first-function figures, and places a third-function figure, the shepherd, in fourth position. The third instrument in the list is a nineteenth-century invention that may well have usurped the place of another musical windbag, the bagpipe. But who is the "prisoner"?47 In any case, a three-functional organization of musical in- struments cannot be supported from the dainas; and we must not forget that in Baltic folklore the "stupid ogre" role is usually filled by a, or the, devil, and that in general devils in this context often correspond to, say, the giants of Eddie lore, and not to Odin (G303.13, Stupid devil).48 On the other hand, folklore also provides examples of the correspondence of the</page><page sequence="11">The Baltic Psaltery 15 devil to the pre-Christian god of the dead.49 No simple definition will suffice. The Estonian material contains several relevant items. First, there is a Jumala kannel tradition, although the available evidence is not exten- sive. Second, Tooru was associated with the bagpipe. This is already two- thirds of a three-functional structure. However, it is to some extent acciden- tal. The Jumala kannel motif is likely to be a borrowing, perhaps a fairly early one, from the Indo-European Baits (at least if we suppose, as seems most probable, that the Baltic psaltery and the various forms of its name are of Indo-European origin). On the other hand, Tooru and his torupill were probably borrowed from Scandinavia, not earlier than the late Iron Age. Both may go back to some early Dumézilian structure of musical in- struments, but if so they were rejoined on Estonian soil by accident. Third, the special connection of the bagpipe with the devil, which so far appears to be peculiar to Estonia, is best explained on the basis of a campaign by the pastors of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries against an instru- ment that they associated with paganism, superstition, drunkenness, and immorality. It does not concern the ancient god of the dead. Finally, an association of musical instruments in general with the devil, as in Helbi Hilip's dualistic creation account, can hardly represent any ancient Baltic or Finnic tradition; possibly it arrived in the Baltic area in connection with the dualistic creation stories. In sum, the special association of the instrument with Dievs , a contrast with a rival instrument associated with a rival figure, and a contest bet- ween these figures,50 are the potentially early motifs of the Baltic Dieva kokle tradition. The evidence that has appeared so far does not, however, enable us to specify the social context or ideologial ramifications of this tradition in any very early stage. The dualistic creation account belongs to a recognized cycle of oral narrative dating from the middle ages. In Estonia, the tradition has apparently been somewhat altered by the im- pact of a seventeenth- and eighteenth-century campaign of the Lutheran clergy against the bagpipe. There may well be further sources germane to this topic in the many obscure or scarce volumes pertaining to Baltic ethnography, to say nothing of the Baltic archives, now hardly accessible. The general topic of tradi- tional heroes who play the Baltic psaltery with magical effects provides much material that we have not been able to examine here; the Young Tõll, an epic hero of maritime Estonia, is especially associated with the Baltic psaltery, not to mention the well-known figure of Väinämöiiien. There is still much to learn about the mythical and folkloric aspects of the Baltic psaltery; its positive and negative associations with different kinds of mythic beings is a theme that draws together a part of this lore, including material that has until now received little attention.</page><page sequence="12">16 Journal of Baltie Studies NOTES ABBREVIATIONS AaTH Antti Aarne and Stith Thompson, The Types of the Folktale: A Classification and Bibliography. 2nd revision.

Harva comments that "God and the devils as rivals, the stringed instrument, etc., are features which can by no means be recon- ciled with the original circumstances and beliefs of the Tungus." Paulson disagreed, holding that the dualistic creation motif is not necessarily foreign to the Tungus; see Ivar Paulson, Âke Hultkranz, and Karl Jettmar, Die Religionen Nordeurasiens und der amerikanischen Arktis pie Religionen der Menschheit, 3] (Stuttgart: W.

Kreutzwald 's remarks on pp. 10-11 and 148-49 are of little scientific value, being bas- ed largely on pseudomythology originating in the fevered brain of Johann Lagus. It is of greater interest to note that Boeder, whose book was probably first published in 1685, states that Thursday was sacred to "Thor." Kreutzwald disputed this, claiming that Boeder misunderstood the name "Taara," and Sjögren added a note suggesting that Taara derived from Thor, so that Boeder was right after all (pp. 97-99).

Note motif A161.3.1, Devil (ogre) steals thunder's instruments. 13 Gustav Rank explains the anti-bagpipe campaign by stating that the instrument was associated with drinking bouts; see his Vana Eesti : Rahvas ja kultuur (Stockholm: Eesti Raamat, 1949), 202; transi. B. Oinas and F. J. Oinas, Old Estonia : The People and Culture [UAS 112] (1976), 134-35. This is correct, but the occasion for such bouts was often a folkloric religious observance, such as the metsiku-pidu, Metsik 'wild per- son' is an anthropomorphic straw figure used in fertility celebrations, also called in some localities Tooru; see Loorits, Grundzüge , II, 95-96, and Paulson, The Old Esto- nian Folk Religion, 111-13. The bagpipe's association with Tooru is mentioned by Gustav Vilbaste (Vilberg) apud Eisen, Estnische Mythologie, 159; and Russwurm's statement that this association was a motive for the campaign against the instru- ment is confirmed by Johann Voldemar Jannsen apud Loorits, "Das Märchen," 111 (Jannsen, like others, sought to derive Estonian torupill 'bagpipe' from "Thor"; it comes from toru 'pipe'). Furthermore, antagonism to the bagpipe must antedate the activities of Lithander in the eighteenth century. Balthasar Russow in his Chronica derProuintz Lyffland (1578), although he does not mention Thor, associates the bagpipe with folk religious celebrations that he condemns in the strongest terms. The passage is quoted in Loortis, Grundzüge, II, 326-28, and in Paulson, Old Estonian Folk Religion, 103-04.

"lyra"; also Pausanias, Descriptio Graeciae, 8.23.9, 8.54.7. The tortoise shell is reminiscent of the jawbone of the giant pike that appears in this capacity in the Finnish-Estonian runic kantele poem, as Žilevičius pointed out in "Kanklès mitologije, legendose ir tautosakoje pas mus ir pas mūsiļ kaimynus," Vairas (1937), 351-52. 35 In the Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo, line 131, the new-born Apollo declares the lyra and the curved bow dear to him. Pseudo-Orpheus, Argonautica, 384-85, distin- guished the kithara of Apollo from the tortoise-shell phorminx of Hermes. Pausanias, Descriptio, 5.14.8, says that according to the Greeks Hermes invented the lyra and Apollo the kithara. Diodorus of Sicily in one place (Bibliotheca histórica, 5.75.3) states that Hermes invented the lyra after Apollo's contest with Marsyas, apparently to replace the kithara that Apollo abandoned for a while because of that contest. But elsewhere (ibid, 3.59.2) Diodorus gives a contradictory account: Hermes invented the kithara, but Apollo was the first to play it fittingly, and used it in the contest with Marsyas. There appear to have been efforts to distinguish the two instruments on the basis of the number of strings, but, as H. G. Gundel observes {RECA, art. "Lyra"), "über die Zahl der Saiten beider Instrumente gehen die alten Berichte stark auseinander. ..." 36 Hyginus, Fabulae, 165; O vid, Fasti, 5.697.710; Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae, 14.616 ef; Pausanias, Descriptio, 1.24.1. 37 The claims of Marsyas (and others) to have invented the flute are rejected, in favor</page><page sequence="17">The Baltic Psaltery 21 of Apollo as founder of ci í/iara-playing and autos-playing both, by Soterichus in Plutarch, De musica, 14.

Among early Christian writers, Clement of Alexandria in general would permit only vocal and not instrumental music (Protrepticus, 1 .5), but he directs his harshest words against wind instruments, and even appears in one passage to permit the kithara and lyra to accompany singing (Paedagogus, 4 .2). 46 The history of the bagpipe is obscure both in the Baltic and in general Loorits asserts a Germanic, and hence late, origin in Estonia ("Märchen vom gestohlenen Donnerinstrument," 111), and the views of Otto Andersson were similar, to judge from the remarks of Anthony B aines in Bagpipes [Occasional Papers on Technology. 9] (Oxford: Oxford University Press, n.d. [I960]), 91. Braun leaves open the question of its antiquity in Latvia: Joahims Brauns, "Instrumentālas muzicēšanas aizsākumi Latvijas territorijā," Latviešu mūzika, 9 (1971), 157-58; transi. K. Brambats, "Die Anfänge des Musikinstrumentenspiels in Lettland," Musik des Ostens, VI (1971), 122. An investigation of the bagpipe in Scandinavia concludes that in Northern Europe "los primeros testimonios de la existencia de la gaita se encuentran en esculturas y pinturas de temas bíblicas, en iglesias y catedrales de fines de la Edad Media"; Rafael Meré, "La Gaita en los países nórdicos," Revista de dialectología y tradiciones populares , 26 (1970), 371. The bagpipe in the Baltic area is discussed briefly in Kon- stantin A. Vertkov, Georgii I. Blagodatov, and El'za E. Iazovitskaia, Atlas muzykaVnykh instrumentov narodov SSSR (Moscow: Gosudarstvennoe muzykal'noe izdatel'stvo, 1963), 66, 71, 76; second, revised ed. (Moscow: "Muzyka," 1975), 89, 95, 102; and in B aines, Bagpipes, 90-92. Baines gives an incorrect etymology, perhaps derived from Vertkov, for Latvian somu dūda 'bagpipe'; see Braun, "Anfänge," p. 122.

An ancient connection between the bagpipe and the thunder-god is suggested by David Evans in "Dodona, Dodola, and Daedala," Myth in Indo-European Antiquity, 102-03. As for the god of the dead, I have at present no relevant information. Kallas mentions a tale from Ludza that includes a reference to a "musical instrument of death" (surma pill), but does not elaborate further "Achtzig Märchen," no. 30 note, pp. 308 and 149.</page><page sequence="18">22 Journal of Baltie Studies 47 Oddly enough, an epithet corresponding to cītumraks is recorded for a second-function deity of antiquity: Mars captivus (Dracontius, Hylas, 2 .57), This refers to the well- known myth in which Hephaestus (Vulcan) catches Aphrodite (Venus) in bed with Ares (Mars) and traps them in a net; there is, of course, no connection between this and the Latgalian saying. Normally, a second-function deity is not a prisoner but a guardian: Mars custos, Indra suträman. 48 This is formally so in AaTh 1148B, where the Devil and his household correspond to the giant thrym and his household in Thrymskvida. The differences between the tale and the Norse myth are, in the current jargon, etic rather than emic. The situa- tion is a bit more complex with a related Greek myth. The details relevant to us are known, unfortunately, only in a slightly garbled form in a work of the late fifth cen- tury AD, the Dionysiaca of Nonnus Panopolitanus, 1.145-164, 294-320, 362-380, 387-2.5. Typhon, while Zeus is engaged in a romantic affair, steals the thunderbolts. In a way not explained by Nonnus, he also obtains Zeus's sinews. Although the monster is rather inept with the weapons, Zeus is helpless against him; so he sends Cadmus, disguised as a shepherd, to enchant Typhon by playing on the syrinx. Typhon pro- mises to reward Cadmus when he becomes king of the gods (note motif A189.1 1, Man as helper of thundergod.) Cadmus states that he plays even better on the kithara, having bested Apollo himself on the instrument, but that in punishment his kithara had been destroyed and he lacked sinews to string a new one. Typhon thereupon gives him Zeus's sinews, and he in turn leaves them where Zeus can get them. Cadmus then again pipes Typhon into a trance, while Zeus recovers both sinews and thunderbolts. The syrinx and rus e-kithara here play an entirely different role, and it is not clear how they may be related to the thunder instrument of AaTh 1148B; but the cor- respondence Typhon-Thrym-Devil is obvious. Cf. Valerie Höttges, Typenverzeichnis der deutschen Riesen - und riesischen Teufelssagen, FFC 122 (1937); Lutz Röhrich, "German Devil Tales and Devil Legends," Jo urnal of the Folklore Institute, 7 (1970), 21-35. 49 In some versions of the legend, mentioned in n. 24 above, of the musician in hell (see LTTP 5.18.2), the koklētājs, through contact with a magic object or substance, ac- quires magic sight in one eye (note motifs D1323.5, Magic salve gives clairvoyance, and D 133 1.1. 2, Medicine gives magic sight). On his return to this world, he recognizes a devil, or the Devil, with this power, and the latter promptly knocks out the clair- voyant eye. In spite of the reversal of function (the koklētājs is made one-eyed to remove magic sight, not to grant it), it is hard to deny a connection with the one-eyed and clairvoyant god Odin/Velinas; see Gimbutas, "Lithuanian God Velinas," 89. 50 In the runic kantele poem, there is another sort of contest; various figures attempt to play the kantele, but all fail until the sole rightful player has his turn. The same motif (D1651.7) occurs in some versions of The Ogre Steals the Thunder's Instrument ADDENDUM: Several relevant publications came to my attention after this article had been sent to the printer. One of these concerns a dualistic çreation belief of the Mari (Cheremis), one of the Finnic peoples of the Middle Volga. In Mari tradition, God and the Devil engage in an organoctistic contest, and invent respectively the gusli and the bagpipe (the gusli of this area is not the Baltic psaltery, but the symmetrical, "helmet-shaped" psaltery, which the peoples of the Middle Volga borrowed from the Russians). This account is a close parallel to the one published by Veske. See Jakov Andreevich Eshpai, Natsional'nye muzykal'nye instrumenty Mariitsev [Ioshkar-Ola]: Mariiskoe gos. izd-vo, 1940), 32. Two valuable articles directly relevant to topics raised in the present article were published in Folklorica: Festschrift for Felix «/. Oinas , ed., E. V. Žygas and P. Voorheis [UAS 141) (Bloomington, Indiana: Research Institute for Inner Asian Studies, 1982).
