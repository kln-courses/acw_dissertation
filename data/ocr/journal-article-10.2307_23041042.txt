<plain_text><page sequence="1">Talismans and Trojan Horses: guardian statues in ancient Greek myth and ritual. CHRISTOPHER A. FARAONE. Oxford University Press, Oxford. 1992. Pp. xii + 193. ISBN 0-19-506404-6. The modern reader of the classics hears little of guardian statues, but in antiquity they must have been a familiar sight. Almost by accident Lucretius reminds us of them: "By the city-gates bronze statues reveal that their hands are wearing away from the touch of those who greet them as they pass."1 One thinks of analogies in Christian tradition, such as the foot of St. Peter's statute in the Vatican worn to a stump by pilgrims' kisses, but ancient beliefs about the veneration of statues remain mysterious. In this book Christopher Faraone draws together many threads of evidence on the subject, and he sheds new light on the broader question of the ancients' view of the relationship between gods and images of gods. It is too easy for us to translate (say) Apollon tis ek xulou as "a wooden statue of Apollo", implying that the god is necessarily transcendent and the artefact symbolic. In practice the ancients recognised a more intimate connexion and might see the god as immediately present in the image. This principle has always been less familiar among classical scholars than students of the ancient Near East2, and on every page this study reminds us of its implications. Faraone accepts that guardian statues were never of central importance in polis religion, and that their lore is mostly local rather than panhellenic. The sources for such a study are bound to be difficult. Greek ritual texts are few and of late date, while poets and intellectuals can be positively misleading if we use their writings as a source for everyday religion. If the scholar looks further, he must try to impose order on scraps of evidence from scattered and unsystematic sources â€” Pausanias, the Suda, scholia, asides in Aristophanes, vase-inscriptions, and the like. This means that a study like this one must be organised in categories imposed from outside. Faraone faces this problem by referring the detailed evidence back to two clear but flexible definitions of his own: a talisman is a divine or animated statue which protects something (usually a city) because of its seen or unseen presence, while an apotropaion is a guardian statue set up to ward off enemies of one or other kind. These terms are treated only as convenient labels, often overlapping, and they work well in giving unity to the treatment. From time to time Faraone is helped along by suggestions from anthropological models and from parallels with the better-documented religions of the Near East (mostly Assyrian, but also Hittite and Egyptian), 87</page><page sequence="2">Reviews but he allows his arguments to be judged by their success in dealing with the Greek and Graeco-Roman evidence itself. Five loosely-connected essays make up the bulk of the book. The first (ch. 2) provides a starting-point from myth, and draws links between a group of tales in which Hephaestus makes animated statues of living beings and gives them to his favourites to guard their thresholds. Along with the familiar example of the golden dogs which guard Alcinoos' palace in the Odyssey (vii. 91-4), a number of examples spring up. There is Talos, the walking iron giant who guarded Crete (Apollonius IV. 1639-93, etc); a bronze lion buried on Lesbos for its protection, described in a fragmentary commentary on Alcaeus (Oat. Pap. 53.3711); a golden dog said to have been made for Zeus' temple in Crete (schol. at Od. xix. 518, etc); and a (presumably) distinct dog given by Hephaestus to Zeus and by Zeus to Europa (Nicander of Colophon, fr. 97 Gow &amp; Schofield). Some of these are attested in much later sources than others, and there is no telling whether they embody an archetypal story-pattern or simply share the floating motif of Hephaestus' ability to make automatons. Nevertheless, the collection serves its purpose in showing that animated guardian statues were a real feature of early Greek myth-making. Faraone must next make the long leap from these fabulous statues of myth to the man-made statues of ordinary religion; unwilling to fall back on the old arguments for equating myth with ritual, he looks east and compares the Neo-Assyrian (occasionally also Neo-Hittite) practice of setting up or burying monu mental carved monsters at the entrances of palaces. Here, as often, the Near Eastern material is more instructive than the Greek, because detailed ritual texts and inscriptions survive along with both artefacts and nar ratives. This gives us a window on the complexities of Near Eastern belief which is unparalleled in Greek sources. Crucially, Faraone is able to show in detail that the Hittite and Assyrian rituals did not distinguish between the actual presence of a god or monster and that of a statue made in his likeness. Turning to Greek religious practice, Faraone next examines the custom of averting disasters by erecting images of the beasts or gods responsible: a statue of Apollo might be set up to avert plague, one of a locust to avert an invasion of locusts, and so on (ch. 3). He finds an interesting parallel in a fragment of Aeschylus (Ox. Pap. 18.1262), where the chorus apparently hang up grotesque images of themselves in order to frighten off strangers. In the same light he turns to the grotesque statuettes set up by Athenian potters on their kilns, and identifies them as images of Hephaestus intended to prevent fire from breaking out (ch. 4). All these he sees as examples of the magical procedure of banishing like with like, for which there is close support in further Assyrian rituals. Here a problem remains: however convincing the comparative evidence of the argument that the true or original function of the images was apotropaic, this often seems not to be how the Greeks interpreted their own practices. In written sources the statues of Apollo are sometimes described as commemorations of a past plague rather than defences against future ones, while the potter's statu ettes are sometimes identified not as Hephaestus but as a Cyclops or simply an epistates. Inevitably, Faraone and his reader are left wondering what exactly he has identified: either a significant pattern in Greek practice 88</page><page sequence="3">Reviews and belief, or a group of prehistoric customs whose forms survived with the original purpose lost and now unknowable. Next, he turns to the custom of binding statues of Ares as a means of preventing war or invasion (ch. 5). Evidence for this practice is secure enough for Greece proper (e.g. Pausanias 3.15.7; Anth. Pal. 9.805), and Faraone adds a Pamphylian oracular text which prescribed just such a ritual in the first century BC. This begs to be understood as a form of sympathetic magic: by binding the statue of Ares, one would be curbing the force of war itself. Intriguingly, Faraone compares this practice with the two Homeric stories in which Ares is bound in person (II. v. 385-91; Od. vii. 266-366). The case for a common origin of the myth and the ritual is strengthened by a simple fact of language: in the epic dialect Ares is not only the personal god, but also the abstract phenomenon of war itself. This could mean that in ritual the anthropomorphic statue would function as an image of war itself rather than merely of its patron. Correspondingly, in pre-Homeric versions the stories of the binding of Ares might have been recognisable as allegories of some kind. Within the field of ritual, there is an obvious typological link between the bound Ares and the apotropaic images of the previous chapters. Here Faraone gives us a remarkable story from a later period (Olympiodorus in Miiller, FHG 4.63.27), which seems to preserve a much older belief combining the two patterns. According to this story, Thrace was protected from invasion by buried silver statues of bound barbarians; when Romans looted the statues in the third century A.D., Thrace was promptly overrun by Goths. It takes no wild imagination to see that this late story may look back to traditions which are as ancient as anything in Greek religion. So far, Faraone has given us cast-iron evidence for three types of religious activity centering on the supernatural powers of statues, and he has suggested several significant links with myth. His approach is synchronic throughout, and he is willing to glean evidence from sources widely separated in time and space. This sometimes produces startling results: on pp. 39-41, for example, examples of a single type of apotropaion are taken from Minoan seals, the Book of Numbers, the First Book of Samuel, scholia to Pindar, Columella, the elder Pliny, Marcellus Empiricus, Apol lonius of Tyana, Gregory of Tours, a Hewbrew magical papyrus of the fourth century A.D., the tenth-century Arab historian Mashudi, and mediaeval tales of Vergil the magician. Ritual can be expected to preserve a given custom intact even when its meaning varies from age to age and even between individual worshippers in the same generation. This is equally true of the peoples of the ancient Mediterranean and the pilgrims who kiss St. Peter's foot. However, the synchronic approach is bound to be more dangerous in the case of mythology, where there are less secure a priori grounds for seeking common patterns and archetypes in texts from different periods and genres. It is perhaps for this reason that the least successful part of Faraone's study is the last (ch. 6), where he restricts himself entirely to narrative literature. Here he sets out to uncover another half-submerged mythical archetype, which he calls "The Ruse of the Talismanic Statue". The basic pattern is that a god or wonder-worker gains entry to a city by means of a divine or animated statue full of hostile power. The statue is received with reverence by the people, and this 89</page><page sequence="4">Reviews enables its maker to destroy them. The paradigm is drawn from the story of the Trojan horse, which Faraone takes in a hypothetical early version close to Vergil's. The Trojan story works well on its own as an example of a powerful statue in myth, but Faraone strains credibility when he tries to fit two other mythical stories into the same scheme. The first is a version of Medea's revenge on Pelias, summarised in Diodorus Siculus (4.51-2) after Dionysius Syctobrachion. Medea gains entry to Pelias' city under cover of introducing the rites of Artemis while in a state of religious frenzy, and carries in a statue of the deity with herbs hidden inside it. She strikes Pelias with awe of the new deity, and thus puts herself in a position to plot his murder. The parallel between this and the Trojan story works only if we suppose that the herbs in the statue are the instrument of Pelias' death, so that they would correspond structurally with the Greeks in the horse: this is not clear from Dionysius' account, and in fact the statue seems to be introduced into the city as a standard part of the ceremony of instituting the cult.3 Faraone's third example is Hesiod's story of Pandora (Th. 570 87, WD 47-105), which fits the scheme (with minor tailoring of details) only if we suppose that it stems from an earlier version in which Pandora's part was played not by a woman but by a statue. Although this claim cannot be disproved, there is no good reason to accept it: it is normal in Greek and Near Eastern myth for the creation of man and woman to be described as an act of craftsmanship4, and Hesiod's story requires no further explanation. Nevertheless, the doubts prompted by this venture into structural myth ology do not diminish the overall value of Faraone's study of a peculiarly difficult area of Greek religion. His book is a challenge to our modern assumptions about the relationship between myth, ritual and godhead, and it succeeds in guiding the reader through a maze of recondite material without losing sight of the larger questions of method and interpretation.
