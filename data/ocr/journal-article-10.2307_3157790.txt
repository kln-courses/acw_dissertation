Another important characteristic (or, rather, entire group of characteristics) connects the conception of God, figuratively set forth by the biblical writings, with the profoundest con- clusions of modern philosophy. And here I must beg leave to employ an uncouth, but very expressive phrase, for the purpose of setting forth my meaning. God in the Bible. has a wonderful amount of " concrete manifoldness." The Bible attributes nearly every quality and phase of life with which man is acquainted-with the exception only of those appetites and desires which have the most obvious basis in bodily organs-to the Divine Being. If theology has, as Matthew Arnold claimed, rendered God a " non-natural man"; the Scriptures, and especially the Hebrew Scriptures, freely rep- resent Him after the analogies of human nature (the " natural" man, excluding fleshly weakness and sinfulness). This biblical manner of depicting the Divine Nature has been made an occasion of much adverse criticism. The con- ception of God which it presents has been accused of the grossest "Ianthropomorphism " and " anthropopathism." Many readers of the Bible, not only among the common people but also among scholars and theologians, have been greatly frightened by these high-sounding epithets, when hurled at their sacred book. Who, indeed, could endure to tolerate views that merit titles so ponderous and difficult of pronunciation as these? We have already seen what was the result of such fright in the case of the translators of the Septuagint. The Neo- platonic philosophy, which the learned Jews of Alexandria stood in awe of, and themselves greatly affected, presented a very different conception of the A11-One from that embodied in the Old Testament figures of speech. But those Jews</page><page sequence="2">1891 ] Conception of God. 149 would have displayed a far profounder appreciation of the permanent rational considerations, and would, at the same time, have made a more accurate translation, if they had not allowed themselves to be influenced by such base fear. Well-established historical knowledge seems to relieve, in part, the modern student of the Old Testament from the fear of its so-called anthropomorphic and anthropopathic expres- sions. He knows that the biblical conception of God-like every other religious conception which the Bible presents- underwent a course of development. The revelation which makes the Divine Being and the divine attributes known, and which has its record in the sacred writings, was an historical revelation. No truth, not even (we might say, much less) the central truth of all, is taught with the same clearness, by all writers, or in all times, within the circle of the Scriptures. The well-instructed student knows that the Jehovah of the Old Testament, in one sense of the words, is not the same God as the Father and Redeemer revealed by Jesus Christ. And yet, in another sense of the words, the Lord our God is one God,-from Genesis to Revelation, and as set forth in the times of the Judges, as well as in the age of the Apostles. But if the student of the Bible will interpret it in this broad, historical fashion, he need no longer entertain the craven fears of the Alexandrine Jews or of the post-Reformation Protestant theologians. For the truths, which the Bible pre- sents in those very figures of speech from which some modern theologians so timidly recoil, are among the most profound truths of the philosophy of religion. Far too many students of the Bible, and also not a few theologians, have held a view of which we may fitly quote the remark of Archdeacon Hare: ", In its recoil from the gross anthropopathy of the vulgar notions, it falls into the vacuum of absolute apathy." In their recoil these biblical students and theologians fall back upon the position taken by many thinkers and writers on the philosophy of religion. Such thinkers and writers have so deprived God of all con- crete and manifold quality, and especially of all attributes that belong to the self-conscious life of feeling, passion, and emotion, as indeed to reduce him to a "vacuum of absolute</page><page sequence="3">150 The Biblical and th/e Philosopzical [Mlarch, apathy." He is, in their thought, Absolute Reason, per- haps; but "absolute" and "pure" reason, in the sense of being purely this, and absolutely nothing else. But a more profound philosophy warrants, as a rational truth, the con- ception which underlies the biblical figures of speech, and which attributes the feeling of beauty, the feeling of sympa- thy in all its forms,-and, indeed, all the feelings of concrete and manifold aesthetical and ethical Life,--to God. The Bible opens with a picture of Elo/zim engaged in doing- six days of work (I speak reverently, as becomes the contem- plation of the sublime religious truth thus naively and beautifully presented), and taking pleasurc in its excellence; after which he rests " from all his work," and thus hallows the Sabbath. How inadequate this picture is to teach all the fundamental relations in which God stands to the world, our Lord himself implies in one important particular, at least: " My Father worketh hitherto," he tells us,--thus asserting the truth upon which science and philosophy now insist, and which is (as we have already seen) taught by the Old Testa- ment itself in its doctrine of the immanence of God. In the next picture we behold Jehovah shaping man ",of the dust," planting a pleasant garden for man, sympathizing with man's loneliness and providing a companion for him; and then enjoying himself, with a walk in the garden he has planted, in the cool, breezy evening, after the heat of day is past. Jehovah is next represented as making coats, out of the skins of animals, for Adam and Eve; and then as turning the man and woman out of the garden, in what ap- pears almost as a spirit of jealousy :--"lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever." And, subsequently, throughout the Pentateuch, Jehovah appears as a being of like passions with ourselves, and as taking the most lively interest in human affairs,--on a con- stant watch, as it were, to see that men are doing as he wishes them to do, and are offering him the right kind and amount of offerings, etc. Sometimes (so the writings seem to teach) he is well pleased and sometimes he is very wroth; he loves the Jews and hates their enemies; he is betimes sad and</page><page sequence="4">1891] Conception of God. 15 grieved because his people have not sacrificed to him, or have broken some of his other ordinances; and then he is very glad that things are going better in his domain. He girds on his armor, like any other valiant warrior, and goes out to battle on the side of the right; he mounts a war-chariot and rides furiously over the prostrate foe. He is more sensitive to everything which happens, among or to his people, than was ever Zeus or Aphrodite regarding the affairs of the Greeks and Trojans. Now when Mr. Robert Ingersoll, or some other equally sage (?) but unfriendly critic of Scripture, points out this so- called " anthropopathism" of the Old Testament writers, many of the friendly students of Scripture do not know what they ought to reply. The conception of God held by some of these writers is perfectly unmistakeable. They represent him as moved not only by human feelings and passions, as such; but sometimes by feelings and passions which we should, from our advanced Christian point of view, call unworthy of even a truly good and righteous human nature. And here, no doubt, we must remember the progressive and historical character of that revelation which makes known to us the God of the Bible. Among the prophets the doctrine of Jehovah as a Being of boundless ethical and aesthetical feeling, of intense emotional life, is everywhere to be discerned. The word which the Hebrew seers receive from the Lord is never a cold and pas- sionless expression of pure thought; nor is it simply the declaration of an unchanging and unfeeling purpose. It is a " burden " laid upon the prophet,-so big and heavy is it, re- garded not chiefly as embodying vast and profound thoughts but rather as itself loaded with the weight of divine feeling. It carries the divine hatred of all iniquity, the love of all righteousness, sympathy with the oppressed, and pity for the suffering people. It therefore stirs the consciousness of the messenger to its utmost depths. It falls upon him like a strong hand (Ezek. 8: I); it makes him tremble like a frightened shepherd before a roaring lion (Amos 3: 8); it burns like a fire in his very bones (Read Isa. 6; Jer. I; Ezek. 1-3).</page><page sequence="5">152 The Biblical and the Philosophical [March, In mentally grasping his commission from Jehovah, the Hebrew prophet shares in the divine emotions, no less than in the divine thoughts, which are attached to the prophetic word. He, too, is angry as is Jehovah with the people for their folly and their sin. He feels in his heart the same joy which Jehovah feels in uttering good tidings to the people. The very essential thing which equips him for his office is this,-that his human heart is so perfectly in sympathy with the attitude of the divine heart toward all moral interests and transactions. Let it not for a moment be supposed that the conception of God set forth in the New Testament is any less marked by this " concrete manifoldness," especially as respects all the varied life of asthetical and ethical feeling, than is the con- ception of the Old Testament. The writers of the New Testament never once speak of God as " reason ;" that term, however profound and necessary the truth it conveys, is de- rived from sources in Greek philosophy rather than in Hebrew religious writings. But with the latter God is "Spirit," " Life," is " I-am." When the Apostle would sum up the essence, as it were, of Divine Being in a single word, he, too, does not talk of " Mind," or " Reason;" but he uses terms of the heart, terms of feeling and passion, of the emotional soul. God is Love; He is a consuming Fire. It is scarcely necessary to call attention to the emphasis which the life and teaching of Jesus, as revealing "cthe Father," put upon the emotional aspects and attributes of God. Who that understands the real meaning of this cen- tral revelation does not see that its significance cannot be restricted to those few features of the divine Life with which current theology is wont to deal? The love of nature, the sympathy with suffering, the joyful triumph over the so-called powers of darkness and of death, the sense of humor, the tender regard for animals, the hot indignation at unrighteous- ness, the sense of the meanness and ludicrousness of hypocrisy and Phariseeism,-these and many other divine features of the character of the Father are revealed in the conduct of the Son. Who can mark Jesus weeping at the tomb of Lazarus, and not believe that the Infinite fcces our sorrows at the loss</page><page sequence="6">1891 ] Conception of God. 153 of friends? Who can hear the cry of Jesus over Jerusalem, and not trust the yearning of the boundless divine Pity? Who can see Jesus scourging the defamers of the temple, and not catch a glimpse of the heat and intensity of the wrath of God? But does modern philosophy find in all this anything which it can rationally approve? Does it not rather reject such considerations from its conception of the Absolute; and, consulting reason and not the heart, demonstrate Divine and Infinite Being-if at all-as " Force," and I"Thought," as moral "' Order" no less unemotional than physical Law? I maintain, decidedly not; unless we are to neglect one half, and that the larger half, of the phenomena; unless we are to make reason no more than a calculating machine, and leave altogether out of our account the life of beauty and aspira- tion, of hope, love, and longing, which nature, both physical and human, displays. Until recently it has, indeed, been the fault of psychology too much to neglect the scientific study of the feelings; the instincts, the psychical gropings and strivings, and of all un- conscious or half-conscious movements of human and other psychical life. But this fault is now acknowledged; and earnest endeavors are being made to correct it. Our concep- tions of the breadth and mystery of those underground roots, as it were, in which originates the self-conscious work of the understanding of the individual, are being greatly changed. The study of biology, as a physical science, is having a sim- ilar transforming effect upon our philosophical theory of the nature and connections of all life. The study of plant life, no less than of animal life, is contributing to the same result. Anthropological studies and historical investigations are ever widening our knowledge of Nature. It is here-in the most comprehensive meaning of the term, and as including all we know of man and his artistic, ethical, and religious being and history-that we find the one connected and progressive manifestation open to us, of all the fullness of the Life of God. Philosophy of religion appeals to these conclusions of the various kinds of science, in order to discover those truths and</page><page sequence="7">154 The Biblical andZ tie Plziloso/lical Czonce pion, etc. [ March, facts which it must acknowledge in framing a rational con- ception of God. Just as, insisting upon the perpetual and comprehensive immanence of God, it teaches in speculative forms the same great verity which biblical religion presents in a pictorial and sensuous way, so also in recognizing the manifoldness of the divine activities and attributes, as under- lying the variety of Nature, it accords with the soul of truth of the scriptural authors. Indeed, we cannot maintain both the immanence and the transcendence of God, as a self- conscious Life, and at the same time deny this manifold- ness. The evidence to his immanence is also evidence to the manifestation of this varied Life. When we stand, with thought submerged in the feeling of the beautiful, before a landscape glowing in the setting sun, or watch the fury of the ocean from the rocky cliff or from the steamer's deck, we are experiencing modes and aspects of consciousness which reveal to us the Being of the Infinite One. The heart of the parent at the wail of his first-born, or as he looks on the face of his beloved dead,-dumb before the mystery of the coming and going of human life-proclaims Him, as He is in his inmost Life, who is the Lord of the quick and the dead. Philosophy is being taught to recognize the profound and unexplored depths of meaning which belong to the fundamen- tal postulate of all religion,-viz., a community of being between the finite and the Infinite, between man and God. But did not the writer of Genesis, centuries ago, represent Elohim as saying: " Let us make man in our image, after our likeness? " And "in the garden," where was placed this man, made in his image, did not Jehovah himself walk, " in the cool of the day?" The crown of biblical revelation adorns that postulate,-- ini ouir image, after our likeness?" And all the resources of philosophy have not yet discovered how far-reaching that postulate must finally be made to appear.</page></plain_text>
