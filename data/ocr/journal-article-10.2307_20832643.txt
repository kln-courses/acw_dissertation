<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE IMPERIAL POLICY OF THE EARLY GHAZNAWIDS C. E. BOSWORTH I The concept of the state as a self-perpetuating organism has been familiar to western Europe since the Renaissance and the growth of nation states. The crucial factor has been the transition from the idea of a political grouping as the ruler's private patrimony, entailing the dissolution of the bonds of unity on that ruler's death, to the idea of the nation state as an entity with a political, social and cultural life of its own, able through its own momentum to survive successive changes of ruler or government. Prerequisites for this continuity are that the machinery of government, even though it may derive its authority from the ruler, should have some degree of independent life and, above all, that there should be a tradition of service and feeling of corporate loyalty amongst the personnel of the government machine, the civil service. The existence of institutions such as these has, amongst other factors, made possible the territorial empires of the European powers, which have been able, through their continuity of policy and personnel, to span all the continents of the world. The theoretical aspect of these points has also been elaborated in Europe since the Renaissance. This has been the development of one of the two strands of meaning in the old Roman concept of imperium, that of territorial dominion (the other being that of governmental power, the practical considerations of which have been mentioned above), into a justification for territorial aggrandisement.1 Except for Byzantium, with its traditions inherited from Imperial Rome, self-perpetuating empires such as those mentioned above could not have existed in medieval Europe. In the Islamic Middle Ages, the Caliphate of the Umayyads and the early 'Abbasids stretched over three continents, from Spain in Europe through North Africa to the Near East and Central Asia. Since the cultural traditions of the Caliphate and the administrative personnel who ran it for their Arab masters came largely from the older civilisations of Byzantium and Persia, there is much to be $aid for Toynbee's view that the 'Abbasid Caliphate was a</page><page sequence="2">50 C. E. BOSWORTH reconstruction of what he calls the old 'Syriac society' of the Semitic and Iranian Near East.2 Yet this empire was only tenuously held together through the loyalty to the Caliphs of local governors and military commanders ; there is little trace of any firm community of interest between rulers and ruled or of the existence of any organic administrative institutions. Not surprising ly its unity was short-lived. It was not until fairly recent times that the Ottoman Turks succeeded in creating an empire which, again, spanned three continents and three cultural worlds: the Balkan Christian, the Perso-Turkish and the Arab ones, and which survived for five centuries before the economic and political pressures of Christian Europe brought about its collapse. Thus if we speak of the Ghaznawid Sultans as rulers over an empire, we are using the term loosely, for, except for the motive of territorial aggrandisement, this empire must in many ways be differentiated from the ones which we have just mentioned and which arose in comparatively recent times. It is certainly a convenient term for the assemblage of territories built up by Sebuktigin and Mahmud, and as a geographical term has something to commend it. At Mahmad's death in 421/1030, his possessions extended from Hamadan on the western rim of the Iranian plateau to the region of Delhi in the east, and his armies had further penetrated into India as far as Benares and Kathiawar.3 These territories straddled two alien civilisations, the Irano-Turkish Muslim one and the Hindu one, and the task of welding together these two wholly disparate cultures, if it had ever been envisaged by the Qhaznawids, would have required centuries for its accomplishment. The lands over which the Qhaznawids exercised either full control or else suzerainty may be divided into three groups. Firstly, there was the central core under direct rule by the Sultan or his governors, sc. Afghanistan, Khurasan and Khwarazm. Secondly, there were several dependent dynasties on the fringes who sent tribute to Ghaznah, such as the Kakuyids of Isfahan, Hamadan, Dinawar and Shabar-Khwast; the Ziyarids of Tabaristan and Gurgan ; the local rulers of Chaghaniyan and ghuttai on the upper Oxus ; and the local ruler of Makran in the south of the modern Baluchistan and the adjoining part of Persia. Thirdly, there was the Dar al-Harb of India, several of whose princes paid tribute, and which was regarded by the Sultans as their milch-cow,</page><page sequence="3">the Imperial policy of the early Ghaznawids 51 an inexhaustible source of treasure and slaves. In sheer extent, the assemblage of so many territories compels admiration, and it was the scale of MahmOd's operations which struck so many contemporaries and contributed after his death to the growth of the legend of Mahmad as the great Ghazi. Yet there is little to show that the early Gfaaznawids regarded their territories as anything more than personal patrimonies, con quered by their own swords and to be enjoyed as much as possible whilever they lived. That they should be passed on intact to their successors was desirable but not a prime consideration. For indeed, there was insufficient continuity of administration and the diwans or departments of state lacked sufficient independent life for a firmly-established, permanent empire to hold together of its own momentum. The death of the sovereign was inevitably a critical juncture, for any uncertainty about the succession meant a weakening of control at the centre and a chance for ambitious local governors or commanders to assert themselves. Although Sebuktigin had made considerable conquests of his own on the north-west frontier of India from the Hindashlhl Raja Jaypll, and had annexed the regions of Bust and Qusdar (K3juzdar) to the south-west of Gbaznah, he had continued to regard himself as a governor on behalf of the Samanids, and not as an independent sovereign.4 Sebuktigin died in 387/997, and despite the evident decay of the Samanids under the double pressure of their own rebellious generals and of an external enemy, the Qarakhanids, it does not seem that he envisaged his heirs setting up as an independent dynasty. He did not bequeath his lands as an undivided inheritance, but as governorships to be held by various members of his family, continuing the practice of the last years of his lifetime, and thereby implying that an at-least nominal depend ence on the Samanids should continue. His brother Bughracfeaq was to remain governor of Herat and Poshang. Of his sons, Abu'l-Qasim Mahmud was to continue as military commander in Khurasan ; Aba'I-Muzaffar Nasr was to remain at Bust; and a younger one, Isma'Il, was to have Ghaznah and Balkh. Mahmad, the most experienced and capable of the sons, was dissatisfied with his share, and as events fell out, was able to establish his primacy and secure his father's capital Ghaznah. Even so, he had at one stage been quite willing to leave Balkh or Khurasan to Isma'il.5 A similar situation arose on Mahmud's death in 421/1030.</page><page sequence="4">52 C. E. BOSWORTH During his thirty years' reign, the Qhaznawid empire had expanded enormously. His son Mas'ttd had for long been official wali-ahd% but shortly before his death, Mahmud had transferred the succes sion to his other son Muhammad. Muhammad had a powerful group at court to forward his interests, and Bayhaqi also speaks of the physical deterioration and declining powers of judgment then visible in the Sultan, the results of advancing age and a lifetime of furious activity: "His constitution gave way and in the greatness of his nature a weakening faculty of judgment was apparent",6 The decision to change the succession puzzled many contemporaries, for Muhammad had little military skill and had had no administrative experience beyond governing the province of Gozgan ; whereas Mas'ad had fought in places like Qhur and had recently been left in the newly-conquered provinces of western Persia as governor. It was inevitable that Mas'ad should prove the stronger and establish his rule over the whole of the empire ; but in the course of the process he was quite ready for a division of power with his brother, himself to have the new conquests in the west and the title of Sultan, and Muhammad to have Qbaznah, Khurasan and India.7 Moreover, expecting a struggle, Mas'ad was also prepared to cede the province of Khutfal on the upper Oxus to the Qarakhanid 'All b. Hasan Bughra Khan, known as 'Alitigin, in return for military help.8 Towards the end of Mas'od's reign, the Seljuqs overran Kbur5s5n, Slstan and much of what is now western Afghanistan. The Ghaznawids were still left with their Indian possessions and much of northern and eastern Afghanistan, the provinces of Tukharistan, BadakhshSn, Kabul and ZabulistSn and Baljch did not fall to the Seljuqs till 1059. Nevertheless, Mas ud's nerve failed completely, and in 432/1040 he decided to cede Balkh and TuMiaristan to the Qarakhanid Boritigin (the later Tamghagk Khan Ibrahim), hoping that he would thus clash with the Seljaqs, and then the Sultan planned to abandon Qbaznah altogether, retiring to India.9 Thus he was ready to sacrifice much of what remained of the Qhaznawid edifice of power, which was still an impressive one, leave the ancestral capital of Qbaznah and turn to ghazw in India, hoping to expand his power in the turbulent and uncertain conditions obtaining there. Mas'ud's successors did manage to retain Qbaznah and eastern Afghanistan as well as India, and after a modus vivendi had been achieved with</page><page sequence="5">THE IMPERIAL POLICY OF THE EARLY GHAZNAWlDS 53 the Seljuqs, the truncated Qhaznawid empire settled down to a period of moderate prosperity. The attitudes described here of the early Sultans towards the fate of their possessions hardly seem to be those of the empire builder who wishes to leave his gains intact for his successor and ensure that they pass into the most capable hands. One aspect of the climate of opinion in the Islamic world emphasised the transience of human affairs : according to this, the true believer was he who lived each day as if it were his last.10 The imperfection of human creation was exemplified in the ups-and-downs of political and military power, the very word dawldh implying changes of fortune. The acquisition of political power had in it an element of luck, as the maxim al-dawlah ittifdqat hasanah11 implied, and might as inexplicably be taken away. It was not safe to count upon the preservation of anything beyond one's own lifetime ; moreover, it was felt that a man had a responsibility to carve out a stake in life for himself, and ought not to expect to step straight into a handsome inheritance from his father. One must further remember that Sebuktigin and Mahmad were ethnically Turks, and for Sebuktigin at least, the memory of his early life in the Central Asian steppes amongst his people of the Barskh5n must have been still fresh.12 Turkish was the language which they used for conversation with their Turkish slave commanders and soldiers, and at the court of Mas'ad, Turkish poetry, probably poetry of popular origin rather than the product of literary circles, was known and recited.18 The Islamic sources for the early Ghaznawids are rarely explicit on the Turkish back ground of the Sultans, but this influence cannot have been negligible. The attitude of Sebuktigin and Mahmad, that their conquests had been won by their own military skill alone and might not be lasting achievements, may also have been influenced by conditions amongst the Altaic peoples of the Central Asian steppes, where nomadic empires of immense breadth might be constituted through the energy of an outstanding leader, an Attila or Chingiz Khan. Such empires might then collapse utterly on the death of their founders. Alternatively, they might be divided out among several sons, each retaining a share of the paternal inherit ance, but with the responsibility of building it up by his own dynamism into a further steppe empire ; the classic example of this is the division of Chingiz Khan's empire among his four sons.14</page><page sequence="6">54 C. E. BOSWORTH In the light of these considerations, it is proposed in this article to use "empire" as a geographical term, denoting the assemblage of territories under the rule of one man, and not as a political term denoting a grouping which is self-perpetuating over a considerable period of time and whose component parts have an organic community of interest. Similarly, "imperialism" is used to denote the aggressive policies of the Sultans and their use of orthodox religion and the moral authority of the Caliphate as a justification for these, so that orthodoxy in religion becomes identified with loyalty to the dynasty. II Much of the energies of Sebuktigin, of Mahmud and, to the extent that distracting conditions in the rest of the empire allowed him, of Mas'ad, were directed towards expansion into northern India. The driving factor here was financial gain, the tribute to be taken from the native princes and the spoils of war. Religious zeal, the urge to implant Islam in pagan lands, was not a dominant motive; indeed, it was not a noticeable motive in the Indian campaigns as a whole. There were no serious attempts to convert forcibly the Indian population at large, whose overwhelming numbers, compared with those of the Ghaznawid invaders, would have made any such endeavour hopelessly impracticable ; and the Ghaznawid armies contained large contingents of Indian troops who were allowed to retain their own Hindu religion.16 It is true that Mahmad led his expedition of 396/1006 against Multan in the name of religion and the re-establishment of Sunni orthodoxy. The long-established Muslim colonies in Sind and Multan had at an early date been the scene of a successful Isma'ili da wok, and towards the end of the 10th century, the ruler of Multan recognised not the Abbasid Caliph but the Fafimids of Cairo.16 Although the local ruler Aba'l-Futah, Dawad b. Nasr had had friendly relations with the Ghaznawids, Mahmad never theless marched against him. In 'Utbf s words, "He [sc. Mahmad] was unable, in the interests of religion, to endure that he should remain in power, seeing the vileness of his evildoing and the abomination of his affair \17 But the fact that the inhabitants of that prosperous city had to pay a heavy fine, allegedly of 20 million dirhams, to save it from being sacked, indicates that enforcement of orthodoxy could also be highly profitable.18 Nazim and Habib are basically correct when they say that Mahmad was</page><page sequence="7">THE IMPERIAL POLICY OF THE EARLY GHAZNAWIDS 55 no fanatic in religion ;19 but in some ways, the absence of a motive of burning religious zeal makes his cold-blooded manipulation of religion for pure reasons of state all the less excusable. It is thus impossible to see in the Ghaznawid raids into India, at least in the early period, any planned policy of colonisation and settlement. Provided that the stipulated tribute of bullion, slaves, elephants, fine textiles and valuable commodities like indigo came in regularly, northern India was left to its indigenous Rajput rulers and the population left freely to exercise their own religion. Only the most important centres, such as Lahore, had permanent garrison forces, comprising some regular Turkish troops, but mainly ghazis, attracted to India from all parts of eastern Islam by the prospects of plunder. The turbulence and indiscipline of these garrisons was a perpetual source of worry to the Sultans, but in the absence of any permanent civil administration, they were the only fixed points d'appui for Ghaznawid power in India. Towards the end of his reign, Mahmad tried to establish a more permanent form of control over the Panjab, with a division of responsibility there. The military command remained in the hands of Turkish ghulam generals, based on Lahore ; but at their side was set up a civil administration under a Persian official, the Qadi Bo'l-Hasan 'AH ShirazI, for whose capabilities the Sultan had a high regard. The intended division of functions was clearly laid down in the instructions sent out early in Mas'ad's reign from Qhaznah to the Qadi: "Your job is management of the finances there (katkkudaz-i mall) and you have nothing to do with the military command or the army. [The new Commander-in-Chief] Ahmad [Yinaltigin] will himself carry out the duties required of him ; he will exact the stipulated taxes and tribute from the native princes [mdlha-yi takkurdn (t'hakuran d\j$~^) ba sitdnad az khardj u muwdda'dt] and then go out on plunder raids and bring back large sums to the treasury". But it soon became clear that northern India was insufficiently pacified for this rudimentary civil administration to function, nor were there adequate means of controlling personnel there. The Qadi and the Commander-in Chief were unable to agree over the demarcation of their respective spheres. Ahmad Yinaltigin used the ghazis of Lahore and the money which he had kept back from the princes' tribute and from the plunder of his raid on Benares to rebel against the Sultan jn A,C X033, The rebellion was suppressed, but northern India</page><page sequence="8">56 C. E. BOS WORTH remained in a turbulent state and the experiment of dual admin istration was abandoned for the rest of the reign.2? It may well be argued that expansion into India was the true historical mission of the Qhaznawids, for the seat of their power at Ghaznah was on the eastern rim of the Hindu Kush mountain massif, overlooking the plains of India, and the Arab geographers describe its strategic and commercial r6le as the merchants' resort and entrepdt (matjar, furdah) for the Indian trade.21 When they lost their lands in the west, the Qhaznawids were able to exist for a further century as a power turned purely towards India ; and their neighbours and rivals in Afghanistan, the Qhurids, established through their slave commanders a Muslim dominion in India of an extent hitherto unknown. Ill From the time when Mahmad became Commander-in-Chief for the Samanids in Khurasan, the Qhaznawids were also attracted westwards and felt a rival pull in that direction. India was viewed as a source of money and manpower, and as such, not designed for permanent occupation. It was otherwise with the lands in the west. Such regions as Khurasan, Kfawarazm, Sistan and JibSl were lands of long-established Muslim settlement and culture. They were crossed by some of the arterial trade routes of Asia, such as that one running from Baghdad through Rayy and along the southern edge of the Elburz to Khurasan and Transoxiana, that one connecting the Siberian and Russian steppes with KbwSrazm and Khurasan and that one connecting Khurasan with Kirman, the Persian Gulf and Oman. They were regions of long urban tradi tion, with cities made prosperous by their own crafts and industries or by the caravan transit trade; often these cities were set in rich agricultural oases which had complex systems of land division and irrigation. India might provide spectacular, if erratic, hauls of treasure, slaves and elephants, of a richness which dazzled contemporary Islam ; but the riches of the Iranian lands gave a steady and substantial taxative yield which was very necessary for the Qhaznawids, keeping up as they did a large standing army.22 It is these considerations which explain the Qhaznawid policy of swallowing up or reducing to tributary status lesser Iranian dynasties, such as the Ma'manid Khwarazmshahs, the ?affarids of Sistan, the Ziyarids of the Caspian coast, the Bayids of Kirman and Rayy, and the Musafirids, Rawwadids and other petty Daylami</page><page sequence="9">THE IMPERIAL POLICY OF THE EARLY GHAZNAWIDS 57 and Kurdish dynasties of Jibal. Whether the Sulfans themselves consciously assigned priorities to the two spheres of expansion for their empire is difficult to say. Mas*od regarded the carrying-on of ghazw in India as one of the main duties laid upon him as his father's heir (see below, 20-21). In 425/1033-4 he led an army against the fortress of S.r.s.tf*, a stronghold which his father had been unable to take, and captured it; and he unsuccessfully besieged another one.28 In the winter of 429/1037-8 Mas'ud insisted on personally leading an expedition to the so-called "Virgin Fortress" (QaVat al-Adhra) of HansI, some 70 miles to the north-west of Delhi, in fulfilment of a religious vow he had made, even though the situation in Khurasan and the west was highly menacing. The discussions between the Sultan and his ministers concerning the advisability of this expedi tion, as reported by BayhaqI, show clearly how a cleavage of views existed between the Sultan, heir to the gftaze-tradition of his father, and his advisers from the Persian bureaucracy, highly conscious of the age-old task of Iran to preserve its north-eastern frontier, Khurasan and the Oxus, against the barbarians of the steppes, in this case, the Oghuz.24 Some indication of the royal family's own views is given in what Mas'ud's aunt, Hurra-yi Khuttall, wrote to him when her brother Mahmud died : that Ghaznah, commanding as it did the Indian plain, was the core (asl) of the empire, and next in importance came Khurasan ; all the rest was subsidiary (far'). Shortly afterwards, Mas'ud himself said that he regarded the central lands of the empire, Khurasan, India, Sind, NfmrQz (sc. Slst5n) and Khwarazm as the core, and the recent conquests in central and western Persia as of secondary importance.25 It is the Ghaznawid attitude towards expansion in the Islamic lands of the west which may be regarded as the expression of imperialism proper, for the aim, so far as can be seen, was a permanent occupation and the diversion of the financial yield of these provinces to the Ghaznawid exchequer. The pursuit of this policy brought the Sultans geographically nearer to the seat of the 'Abbasid Caliphs in Baghdad, and their attitude towards the Caliphate elucidates much of their policy in this direction. Like their predecessors the Samanids and their fellow-Turks, the Qarakhanids and Seljuqs, the Ghaznawids were staunch Sunnis of the HanafI rite. The 'ulama of Khurasan and Transoxiana were Srsvati or SarsQti (?), modern SarsSwah, near SahSranpHr in India (Ed.)'</page><page sequence="10">58 C E. BOSWORTH leading exponents of Sunn! orthodoxy, and from these regions? whose cultural and intellectual vitality may perhaps have resulted from their contiguity with pagan Central Asia?came some of the most learned theologians, traditionists, jurists and philosophers of Islam. But whereas it is recorded that on certain occasions, rulers from the Samanid and Qarakhanid dynasties were attracted by the doctrines of the extremist Isma'Ili Shl'ah (e.g. the Samanid Amir Nasr b. Ahmad, who in 331/942 was forced to abdicate, and the Qarakhanid Ahmad b. Khidr Khan, who in 488/1095 was executed through the efforts of the orthodox w/ama')28, no such breath of scandal was ever linked with the Ghaznawid Sultans, and the whole dynasty, down to its extinction by the GhQrids, presented a solidly anti-Shfi front. From the general attitude of orthodoxy which characterised these Turkish dynasties, it seems that these steppe peoples, coming freshly into the Islamic world, tended to identify themselves with the orthodox religious and political institutions, i.e. SunnI Islam and the Baghdad Caliphate, as speedily as possible.27 Moreover, the traditional zeal of the convert helped them to find a certain moral justification for clashing with older-established dynasties nearer the heartland of the Caliphate (e.g. the Buyids) whose Islam was tinged with Shfism or some other suspicious colour. These Turkish dynasties of the 11th century, together with succeeding ones, adopted the Hanafl madhhab, which was particularly influential in the eastern Islamic world, where it was often allied with the Maturldifca/dm. It is often asserted that the Hanafl school was the most liberal of the madhahib and as such commended itself to the Turks and Mongols;28 but whilst the Hanafis were on some points less strict than the other law schools, this assumption should not be taken as proven. The Ghaznawids' orthodoxy showed itself in three directions: (0 in the suppression of heterodoxy within ;heir own dominions; (ii) in the maintenance of friendly relations with the 'Abbasid Caliphs; and (Hi) in the use of the advancement of the true religion and the liberation of the Caliph as motives for imperialist expansion westwards. These three strands are to some extent interwoven, but we shall now examine them separately, in particular the second and the third ones.</page><page sequence="11">THE IMPERIAL POLICY OF THE EARLY GHAZNAWIDS 59 IV Within their dominions, the Qhaznawids were prepared to leave the 'Alids and the moderate, Ja'fari Shf ah, those to whom the theologians ascribed tashayyti hasan, in peace, provided that they never meddled in political affairs. On these terms, the Sultans would treat the leaders of the Shu community with respect. 9 But towards the extremist Shl'ah, the Rawafid, and the Isma'ilfs or Batiniyyah, the Sultans were implacably hostile. In the course of the 10th century, Isma'IlI dais had made considerable progress in Khurasan and Transoxiania, taking advantage of social discontent and of older, anti-Islamic currents of protest. These Isma'ilis owed allegiance to the Fatimid Caliphs in Cairo, and although the political pretensions of the Fafimids were hardly a practical threat in the distant dominions of the Qhaznawids, this allegiance to an outside power, and one, moreover, hostile to the Baghdad Caliphs, gave the Sultans adequate motive for repressive action (see below, 26 ff.). Within NIsbapQr, Mahmud used as a weapon against the Batiniyyah the leaders of the Karamiyyah, a sect accused by their theological opponents of anthropomorphism, and characterised by their intolerance and fierce persecuting zeal.80 Eventually, later in his reign, Mahmud was compelled to take action against the Karami leaders and deprive them of the power which they had been abusing, but until that time, he had encouraged their harrying of Isma'ill sympathisers.31 Because of their support for the orthodox ulema, the Qhaznawids did not generally look with much sympathy on the dervishes and the ?QfIs. Whilst they were not insensible to the appeal of saintly men, as the visits to Mahmad of the NIshapar shaykh Abo Sa'Id Muhammad al-?hargashi (d. 406/1015-16) show,S2 they were suspicious of Sufi shaykhs who collected round themselves large bands of followers from the artisan and lower classes, fearing that they might provoke social unrest. Thus in one episode from the life of the famous mystic Shaykh Abu Sa'Id b. Abfl-Kfaayr al-Mayhanl (d. 440/1049), the orthodox 'ulama accuse him of fomenting fitnah in NishapQr, and secure the Sultan's permission to inflict the ultimate penalty of the SharVah, the hanging of the Shaykh and his followers.33 V From the outset, the Qhaznawids had a tradition of friendly relations with the 'Abbasid Caliphs. Whereas both the Samanids</page><page sequence="12">60 C. E. BOSWORTH and the Qarakhanids at times harboured pretenders to the Caliphate, the Qhaznawids never did this : when the fugitive pretender Abo Muhammad 'Abd Allah al-Wathiqi, who claimed to be a descendant of the Caliph al-Wathiq, came to his dominions, Mahmad imprisoned him till he died.34 Moreover, the Samanids had refused to recognise the accession in 381/991 of the Caliph al-Qadir, regarding him as a tool of the Bayids, and they continued till the end to recognise his deposed predecessor al-Ta'f. After his great victory in Khurasan in 389/999, Mahmad claimed in his fath-namah to the Caliph that it had only been the Samanids' refusal to recognise al-Qadir that had led him reluctantly to take up arms against them.?5 Despite Mahmad's arguments to the Caliph, he had in fact been content until then to follow the Samanids' lead in acknowledging not al-Qadir but al-Ta'f, as the coins minted by him up to 389 A.H. all show.36 The subsequent course of Mahmad's relations with the Caliph has been outlined by Nazim, Sultan Mahmud, 164-5, who has discerned a pattern of great respectfulness in the early years, which, however, became less marked as the Sultan's reign progressed. This change, he says, is seen in his increasing slowness in forwarding fath-namahs and presents after his victories. Nevertheless, the Sultan was usually respectful. The 'Abbasids were especially sensitive where their great rivals, the Fatimids, were involved. They must have felt the contrast of their own miserable state, reduced as they were to Baghdad and its environs, eking out an existence on the pensions allowed them by the Buyid Amirs, at the side of the splendour of Fatimid Cairo and the flourishing economic and cultural life of the Fatimid empire. Hence when in 403/1012-13 the Fafimid Caliph al-Hakim sent an envoy to Mahmad's court, one Tahartl, Mahmud had him arrested and executed, even though the wretched man had come openly and pacifically. As a result, in Jurbadhqanf s words, "When the news of the execution of the envoy from Egypt reached Baghdad and the firmness of the Sultan's faith became known, the tongues of calumniators and the reproofs of censorious ones were silenced, and his name was always mentioned with praise and honour at the court of the Commander of the Faithful".37 Mahmud again gave full satisfaction over the affair of Hasanak's robe of honour. Irlasanak was a member of the prominent NishapQr family of the Mikalis, and had been from boyhood a high favourite</page><page sequence="13">THE IMPERIAL POLICY OF THE EARLY GHAZNAWlDS 61 at court After the disgrace of Ahmad b. Hasan Maymandl, he was appointed Vizier. The year before he was invested with the Vizierate, he had gone on the Pilgrimage, and because of the unsettled state of the bandit-infested routes across the Nejd, he had returned through the Fatimid territories of Palestine and Syria. Whilst there, he had been injudicious enough to accept a MiiVah from the Fatimid Caliph al-Zahir and to accept letters of friendship for conveyance to Mahmud. The possibility of diplomatic ex changes between the Ghaznwids and his Fatimid enemies alarmed the 'Abbasid Caliph, and in 414/1023 he accused Hasanak of Karmathian, i.e. Isma'ili, sympathies. The Sultan regarded the charge as ridiculous, and privately called the Caliph a doting old fool (kharif-shudah\ but to appease him, the offending WliVah was sent back to Baghdad for burning.38 The charge of Karmathian sympathies was revived in the next reign, that of Mas'ud, and obedience to the Caliph's demand for Hasanak's head was the ostensible reason for his eventual hanging. In reality, Hasanak's death was in retribution for the support which he had given to Mas'ad's brother and rival, Muhammad, and came immediately from the conspiracy of his enemies at court ; if the Sultan had wanted to save Hasanak from the wrath of the Caliph, he could certainly have done so, just as his father had done.89 The political and military enfeeblement of the 'Abbasid Caliphate was such that there were no material reasons why so powerful a dynasty as the Qhaznawids should defer to it at all. Contemporary literature is full of this theme, that the Caliphs are now reduced to the status of pensioners of the Buyids, with their very lives threatened by the turbulence and anarchy of their own capital.40 After the death of al-Mutf in 363/974, the Caliphs even ceased for 170 years to mint their own coins. However, the moral authority of the Caliphs as Imams of the Sunni community was still great, and it survived this period of material degradation, until under the later Seljaqs, the Caliphate gradually acquired once more an appreciable degree of political influence. It was the Caliph who had the power to legitimise de factor ower by the award of a patent of investiture. In the Islamic world, power was usually acquired by force of arms or other violence. Although from the time of the ?affarids it had lost its validity, the fiction was still maintained in the eastern Islamic world that all lands were held of the Caliph and that all local rulers were</page><page sequence="14">62 C. E. BOSWORTH his vassals. In practice, this had become reduced to the recognition of the Caliph in the kkutbah, the Friday sermon made in the joint names of the Caliph and the local ruler, and on the sikkah, the coinage, and the tirdz, the embroidered textiles produced in the official workshops, on which the Caliph's name preceded that of the local ruler or governor. With those rulers who were Shl'i in religion, even these marks of respect might be absent. Many of these Shl'i powers recognised the Fafimids as their spiritual over lords, and it was a supreme indignity for the 'Abbasid Caliph when in 450/1058 he was compelled to abandon his capital to the Turkish general Basasiri, who then pronounced the kkutbah at Baghdad in the Fa?imids' name.41 The Caliphs gave the seal of Sunni orthodoxy and legitimacy to the secular rulers of Islam by sending them a formal document granting them their lands Cahd, manshur). Usually, such a grant was also accompanied by the other insignia of royalty, a standard (liwa), robes of honour (khiVah, tashrifdt), and above all, by an award of honorific titles (alqab). In the 10th and 11th centuries there was a rising tide of demand for these titles, until title was piled on title and they became inevitably cheapened. Nizam al Mulk denounces the working-out of this historical process, attacking the frenzied demand for honorifics on the ground that their indiscriminate use blurs social distinctions and degrees: "Nowadays, the meanest person has ten titles, and if any one of these is missed out in addressing him, he becomes angry and abusive".42 It was the Caliph who had the right in the first place to grant these titles, which were normally compounded of the elements -den, -dawlah, -millah, -ummah or -dunya. Such honours had, of course, to be paid for, and the income from their sale made up an important part of the Caliphs' finances at this time.43 The prestige of the Caliphs as grantors of these titles was such that the Daylami Buyids, although Shl'i in faith, always sought their honorific titles from the 'Abbasid Caliphs, and even when they assumed titles which were, to the pious, theologically objectionable, such as Shahan shdh, "Emperor of emperors", sought Caliphal approval for this.44 Furthermore, they always placed the Caliphs' names on their coinage, and avoided putting on it the 'Alid formula " 'All is the Friend of God" CAli Waliy Allah) which less-inhibited Shl'i princes often employed.45 The early Ghaznawids cultivated the Caliphs in order to secure the latter's moral support and approval. After his victory</page><page sequence="15">THE IMPERIAL POLICY OF THE EARLY GHAZNAWIDS 63 in 389/999 in Khurasan, when the khutbah was at last made in al-Qadir's name, the Caliph sent Mahmod a manshiir for Khurasan and the titles of Yamtn al-Dawlah wa Amtn al-Millah, expressing MahmQd's role as champion both of the Caliphate's secular interests and of the faith, and of Waliy Amir al-Mu mining In 392/1001 the Caliph, fearing the ambitions of the rival claimant to the Caliphate, al-Wathiql (see above, p. 12), nominated his son Abu'l-Fadl Muhammad as his waliy-ahd, with the honorific al-Gk'dlib billdh. He wrote to MahmQd announcing this decision and enjoin ing him to include his heir's name in the khutbah and on the coinage after his own, and Mahmud's coins show that this was in fact done.47 After the execution of Taharti, a grateful Caliph sent Mahmud the further titles of Nizam al-Dtn and Ndsir al-Haqq^ In 4*7/1026 Mahmod made his expedition across India into the Kat'hiawar peninsula to the idol temple at Somnath. The deed fired the imagination of the Islamic world, and the Caliph sent MahmQd the titles of Kahf al-Dawlah wdl-Isldm, with further laqabs for his brother and two sons, each of them receiving one title stressing the dynasty's secular power and another one stressing its upholding of orthodox religion. In addition, the Caliph sent MahmQd a manshiir confirming his possession of KhurasSn, India, NImrQz and Kfawarazm, and promised to agree to the nomination of whichever heir the Sultan should choose.49 The succession crisis on Mahmad's death in 420/1030 brought the importance of Caliphal backing to the forefront. Muhammad, the official waliy-ahd, succeeded in Qhaznah with the support of the military commanders and civil officials. Mas'ad was far away in western Persia, having been left there by his father to govern the provinces newly-conquered from the BQyids of Rayy, the Kakuyids of Isfahan and the Musafirids of Tarom. He was remote from the centre of power in the Ghaznawid empire, and it was not surprising that Muhammad should have resisted all attempts at a compromise and division of power (see above, pp. 3-4). To redress this geographical disadvantage, Mas'ud attempted to secure recogni tion from the Caliph as his father's true heir; his brother does not seem to have had time to make any diplomatic approaches to Baghdad. Before leaving Isfahan, Mas'ad wrote to the Caliph asking for this recognition, a patent of investiture and the insignia of royalty, sc. a standard and honorific titles. The Caliph's favourable reply brought great joy to Mas'ud at Rayy: "He</page><page sequence="16">64 C. E. BOSWORTH commanded that they should blow trumpets and beat drums, and read it out in the public gatherings. They took copies of that reply and sent them to Isfahan, Tarom, the region of Jibsl, GurgSn, Tabaristan, NIshapur and Herat, in order that the people might be convinced that he was the Commander of the Faithful's deputy and his father's heir."60 The Caliph's envoy Ba Muhammad HashimI made contact with Mas'ad at Nishapor in Sha'ban 421/August 1030, where a splendid reception was arranged for him. He brought rich presents, including robes of honour, one being in the 'Abbasid colour of black, pieces of unsewn cloth and ten richly-caparisoned horses. But it was the patent of investiture (manshur ndmah) and the honorific titles which most delighted Mas'ad. These last are given by Bayhaqi as Ndsir Din Allah, Hafiz kIbad Allah, al-Muntaqim min Kda Allah, Zahir Khalifat Allah Amir al-Muminin. Mas'ad regarded these awards as important weapons in the struggle against his brother, giving him, in the eyes of the pious, a moral advantage. He, therefore, again ordered that copies of the manshur and details of the laqabs should be sent to the cities of Khurasan and Badhghls and publicised there, so that the people might rally to his side.51 A year later, in 422/1031, the Caliph al-Qadir died and his son al-Qa'im succeeded. By now, Mas'ad was firmly on the throne, and had removed by exiling or execution many of the Mahmudiyan, those who had been his enemies under the old regime. He felt himself to be in a strong position, and this is reflected in the terms which he imposed in return for recognition of the new Caliph. When he first heard of al-Qadir's death, he decided to keep the news quiet and to continue the khutbah in the dead Caliph's name, and this seems to indicate that the Sultan was delaying full recognition of the new Caliph and using this as a negotiating weapon. The reception of the envoy, the Faqih Abu Bakr Muhammad b. Muhammad al-Sulaymanl al-Tasl, was made as magnificent as possible in order to impress the Caliph's representative with the power and might of the Ghaznawid Sultans. Mas'ud made three conditions in return for his recognition of the new Caliph : (1) that he should receive a fresh manshur for all his territories ; (2) that the Caliph should not have direct diplomatic relations with the Qhaznawids' enemies, the QarSl?hanids, and in</page><page sequence="17">THE IMPERIAL POLICY OF THE EARLY GHAZNAWIDS 65 particular, that he should not send them honorific titles and robes of honour except through the intermediacy of the Qhaznawids ; this demand would continue the practice which had obtained during MahmQd's reign ;52 and (3) that the Caliph should agree to Mas'ad's plans for im perialist expansion in the west (see below, p. 26 ff.). These stipulations show that: the Sultan regarded his empire as the dominant power in the eastern Islamic world, for the claim to act as channel of communication between Baghdad and the Qarakhanids was a bold one, dictated by his fear of such shrewd and capable rivals as Yinaltigln of Samarqand and Bukhara and Qadir Khan Yusuf of Kashgbar and fchotan. The sonorous list of territories which Mas'od enumerated in his request for a patent of investiture was doubtless designed to impress the Caliph with the extent of his empire: "IChur2san, Khwarazm. NImrQz, Zabulistan, the whole of India, Sind, Chaghaniyan, Khuttalan, Qubadhiyan, Tirmidh, Qusdar, Makran, Waiishtan, Kfkanan,68 Rayy, Jibal, Isfahan, the whole of the territory as far as the upland of HulwSn, Gurgan and Tabaristan." Finally, a dazzling array of presents was sent back to the Caliph. According to the Vizier Maymandl, the customary scale (rasm) for presents to the Caliphate was 20,000 mans of indigo for the Caliph personally and 5000 mans for his court circle, together with all the presents of cash given by the great men of the Ghaznawid state on the day when the j&amp;utbah in the new Caliph's name was first made, and any other precious articles which the Sultan might like to add. There was also a recognised tariff for envoys, and the Vizier suggested 100,000 dirhams and a robe of honour. Mas'od exerted himself in displaying to the Caliph the extent of his wealth, and in the end sent to Baghdad 100 pieces of cloth, 10 of them woven with gold ; 50 vesicles of musk ; 100 cakes of camphor ; 200 pieces of finest muslin veiling ; 30 Indian swords ; a robe of gold 1000 mitkqals in weight, embroidered with many pearls, 10 jacynths and 20 Badakhsh5n rubies; 10 Khuttali horses caparisoned with silk and 5 Turkish slaves. The envoy received from Mas'ud a gold-embroidered robe of honour weighing 500 mithqdls, of the type usually given to fuqaha ; a mule ; 2 horses ; 100,000 dirhams, and 20 valuable robes. To this, the Vizier personally added a mule, 500 dinars and 10 robes.54 This display had its intended effect, and in 424/1033 the envoy</page><page sequence="18">66 C. E. BOSWORTH al-Sulaymani came to Mas'ud at NIshapur bringing presents of robes of honour and horses, together with the requested manshur ndmah in the customary black silk pouch. Mas'ud's rule over the provinces inherited from his father, acquired by himself or whose conquest was being planned (malakatha-yi mawruth-u munkasib-u anchih ba-tazagz girad) was confirmed, and Mas'ud made a declaration of policy emphasising his role as the defender of religion against heretics and Isma'ills : "They brought forward the turban and sword and the Sultan declared, This turban which I am about to put on with my hand must be wound on by the Supporter of Religion (Nasir-i Dird\ He put it on his head after the crown. He drew the sword and said, The Zanddiqdh and Qaramitah must be uprooted, and the sunnah of my father Yamin ad-Dawlah wa'l-Din thereby observed ; moreover, other regions which are in the hands of enemies must be seized by the might of this tword."55 This episode marks the zenith of Mas'ud's power, before the threat from the Turkmens had begun to cloud the latter half of his reign. One problem remains to be resolved. The Austrian numis matist Zambaur noted that coins were minted by Mas'ud at NIshapur and Hamadan as late as 424/1033 which still bore the name of the Caliph al-Qadir, who had died at the end of 422/1031. He could only suggest that some reason indiscernible to us lay behind it: "Le fait qu'il y a dans le lot present trois pieces avec al-Qadir, emises apres sa mort, nous force a y reconnaitre aussi une intention politico-religieuse qui nous reste cachee ?"56 The only solution seems, indeed, to be that Mas'ad, although he had placed the new Caliph al-Qa'im in the khutbah, nevertheless deliberately refrained from placing his name on the coinage, whilst awaiting the favourable outcome of his demands on the Caliph. That the trust between Mas'ud and Baghdad was far from complete is shown by the Sultan's parting action when the two Caliphal envoys left for home in Muharram 423/December 1031-January 1032 ; he sent a secret agent (munht) with them to report "every thing that happened, great or small."57 The Caliph's envoy did not return to Mas'ad till Rabi' II 424/March 1033,58 and it may be that only then, when the Sultan was assured of his desires, did he let al-Qa'im's name appear on the coinage ; other Ghaznawid coins known from 424 A.H. and thereafter bear al-Qa'im's name.59</page><page sequence="19">THE IMPERIAL POLICY OF THE EARLY GHAZNAWtDS 67 VI We have seen that the Qhaznawids assiduously cultivated good relations with the 'Abbasid Caliphs, seeking the moral advantages which came from Caliphal support. It is true, as we have observed, that there were few concrete military or political benefits to be gained from this policy, for the Caliphate's material power was at this time negligible. The Shi'I Bayids had the substance of power in most of Iraq and western Persia. Consequently, they were, for instance, able to encourage the public celebration, even in the Caliph's own city of Baghdad, of such ShI'I festivals as the 10th of Muharram mourning for al-Husayn and the Ghadir Khumm commemoration.60 They were able to impose public officials on the Caliph, although the Caliph might at times rebel against this.61 On the other hand, there were limits to the pressure which the Bayids could exert on the Caliphs and to their interference in their few remaining functions. It was not in their own interests to reduce the Caliph to utter abjectness. In the first place, it would have aroused too much sympathy from the Sunni powers, and perhaps actual intervention by them ; and secondly, the 'Abbasids were needed by the Bayids for their anti-Fatimid policy. Although the Bayids and the Fatimids had some Shfi tenets in common, the clash of political interests in the area of Syria and al-Jazfrah overshadowed this. Hence the Caliph was able in 401/1010-11 to persuade Baha' al-Dawlah to send an army against the 'Uqaylid ruler of Mosul, Qirwash b. al-Muqallad, who had declared his allegiance to the Fafimids; and several prominent 'Alids were among the 'ulama' of Baghdad who in 402/1011-12 signed the famous manifesto against the Fatimid claim to descent from the Prophet's daughter.62 In fact, the Caliph al-Qadir did not find the Buyid yoke totally intolerable. After 'Adud al-Dawlah, the old Daylaml fierceness of the dynasty mellowed somewhat, and the family became increasingly fragmented and rent by internal quarrels. Whereas in the middle years of the 10th century, several Caliphs had died violent deaths and had followed each other in quick succession, al-Qadir and al-Qa'im had a combined reign of 84 years and died in their beds. A major reason for the Caliphs' insecurity now was not so much the threats from outside forces, but the social and sectarian turmoil within Baghdad itself, arriving from the rival factions of Sunnis and Shi'is, the Turkish and</page><page sequence="20">68 C. E. BOSWORTH Daylami soldiery, and the layyars% ruffians and mobsters ; and it is an unusual year in which the historians do not record a disturbance of some kind in the capital.63 Nevertheless, it was an undisputable fact that the Caliph was not a free agent and was to some extent under the tutelage of the Shi'i Buyid Amirs. This fact meant that there was always some sort of pretext ready to hand for the Bayids' Sunni enemies, who could claim that there was a need to "liberate11 the Caliph. Mahmad's relations with the Buyids were generally correct, if not cordial. Until the last year of his reign, he had only one serious clash with them, that is, in Kirman. He had been unable to resist meddling in a succession dispute there. When in 407/1016-17 the governor of Kirman, Qiwam al-Dawlah Abu'l-FawSris, had un successfully rebelled against his brother Sultan al-Dawlah, ruler of Fars, he had fled to Bust and sought Mahmud's help. Mahmad sent an army, but had no immediate success in reinstating his protege^64 Apart from this, relations with the Buyids went tolerably smoothly, and in Mas'ud's reign, the Amir of Iraq, Jalal al-Dawlah, claimed that Mahmad had tacitly renounced his ambi tions in Kirman (see below, 31-32), and indeed, MahmQd made no attempt to intervene there when, towards the end of his reign, warfare again broke out in Kirman over a succession dispute.*5 Kirman was cut off from the Qhaznawid dominions by the deserts which adjoined its eastern and northern frontiers, and it was not a province of outstanding richness. Central Persia offered much more glittering prizes for a determined aggressor, since it held cities of great economic and commercial importance such as Rayy, Isfahan and Qazwin. Access to it from Khurasan was not difficult, especially as the Caspian provinces of Gurgan and Jabaristan were in friendly hands, those of the Ghaznawids* tributaries, the Ziyarids. The region between the provinces of Khurasan and Jibal had been the scene of much fighting between the Buyids and Samanids, the latter of whom had expended much treasure in trying to capture Rayy.66 If further pretext were required for intervention in the Bayid provinces, the Sultans could not only cite the position of the Caliph in Baghdad but also their interests in keeping open the route across Persia and Iraq for the Pilgrimage. Each year, Khurasan and the east sent a large concourse of pilgrims to the Hijaz, for the leadership of which the Qhaznawid ruler usually nominated one of the prominent figures of his kingdom. The</page><page sequence="21">THE IMPERIAL POLICY OF THE EARLY GHAZNAWIDS 69 internecine strife among the Buy id family caused frequent warfare and unrest within their own lands. Also, as a result of their weakness, they were unable to assert their authority over the rapacious Bedouins of the desert adjoining Iraq, who regularly preyed on the pilgrims' caravans across the Nejd ; the chroniclers frequently report that the pilgrimage to Iraq and KhurSsSn could not be made that year. Complaints were made to the Gbaznawid Sultans about this, with the aim of recalling them to their responsibilities in this direction. Ibn al-Jawzi records under 412/1021 that "The Pilgrimage of Iraq had been held back in the years 410 and 411. When the year 412 came round, a group of people sought out Yamln al-Dawlah Aba'l-Qasim Mahmad b. Sebuktigin and said to him, 'You are the Sultan of Islam and the most powerful of the monarchs of the earth. Every year you conquer a fresh portion of the territory of the un believers ; but the divine reward for opening up the road to Mecca would be greater, and this affair has greater claims on your attention. Badr b. Hasanuyah (Hasanawayh) [sc. the Kurdish ruler of the district of Hamadan and Dinawar, reigned 369-405/979-1014] has for twenty years facilitated the pilgrims' caravan by giving money and counsel, and each single person of your entourage is greater than him in prestige. So attend to the interests of God, He is exalted, and devote some part of your attention to this topic' ."67 Three years later, the Pilgrimage of Khurasan had to return by a roundabout way through the Fa timid territories of Syria and al-Jazirah (see above, p. 13). In 419/1028 some of the KhurasSn pilgrims made the journey to Mecca by travelling through Kirm5n to Makran and the Persian Gulf and taking ship for Jeddah from there, because the landroute across northern Persia was blocked.68 Such considerations as these could well furnish occasions for the Sultans to intervene further west, and it is specifically recorded that in 424/1033 an army sent by Mas'ad captured and executed the Daylami local ruler of the region of Sawah and Qum, ShahrnQsh b. Walkfn ; he had rebelled, and had also illtreated the pilgrims of Khurasan, taking from them transit dues above the recognised level.69 On at least two occasions Mas'ud further adduced the necessity of opening up the Pilgrimage route when he boasted of projected conquests in the west (see below, p. 27). Towards the end of his life, in 420/1029, MahmQd departed from his general policy of non-intervention in the Buyid lands by</page><page sequence="22">70 C. E. BOSWORTH his expedition to Rayy, which ended in the deposition of its ruler, Majd al-Dawlah Abu Jalib Rustum b. 'All. Until the previous year, Rayy had been effectively ruled by Majd al-Dawlah's mother Sayyidah, who had kept her son away from actual power. When called upon by her death to assume direct authority, Majd al-Dawlah was unable to keep order. The Daylami troops got out of hand, so that he very foolishly called in Mahmad's help. Previously, Mahmad had been content that the strategically important and economically valuable city of Rayy should remain under the rule of Sayyidah. When asked by the Vizier Maymandi why he had not intervened there before, Mahmad had smiled and said that if a man had been ruling there, he would have had to keep an army permanently stationed at Nishapar; whereas, whilever a woman ruled there, he did not regard the Bayids of Rayy as a threat to Khurasan.70 Although Mahmud came to Rayy at Majd al-Dawlah's invita tion, it seems that he was already meditating an attack on the city during Sayyidah's lifetime.71 The invitation gave him the opportunity of sacking the city, slaughtering large numbers of its citizens and carrying off rich treasures. Even Mahmad felt that some justification was required for this frightfulness, and that justification was found in religion : the need to cleanse Rayy and Jibal of the heresies of the Batiniyyah. Mu'tazilah and Mazdakites, whose growth there had been encouraged by Majd al-Dawlah's own laxity of belief and practice. Whereas Mahmud had during the course of his reign grown more and more dilatory in sending presents and accounts of his victories to the Caliph, a fath-namah now came directly from the Sultan's camp near Rayy, giving an extensive analysis of Mahmud's motives and the justification for his actions. The document is here quoted in full, for it shows to perfection how skilfully the Sultan could utilise the excuse of religion for what was an act of naked aggression: "A letter reached the Caliph from the Amir Yamin al-Dawlah Abu'l-Qasim Mahmad, with the contents as follows :? 'Greetings to our lord and master, the Imam al-Qadir bi'llah, Commander of the Faithful. The letter of the slave has come from his military camp on the outskirts of Rayy, 1st Jumada II, [4] 20. God has cleared away from this region the hands of the oppressors and has cleansed it of the activity of the infidel Batiniyyah and the evil-doing innovators {da wot al-Batiniyyat al-kafarah wa'l-mubtadtat al-fajaraK). The</page><page sequence="23">THE IMPERIAL POLICY OF THE EARLY GHAZNAWIDS 71 sacred presence has already received news about the exact nature of that upon which the slave has been concentrating his efforts, his struggle in carrying on warfare against the infidels and those who are in error, and his sub duing of the sect of the evil-doing Batiniyyah which had grown up in Khurasan- The city of Rayy was their particular place of refuge and the place where they openly preached their infidelities. Also, they were linked up with the innovat ing Mu'tazilah and the extreme Shfah, who controverted God's Word and the Sunnah. They openly revile the Com panions and hold infidel and antinomian doctrines. Their leader was Rustum b. 'All the Daylaml [sc. Majd al-Dawlah]. The slave got his armies ready and appeared in Gurgan, halting to spend the winter there. Then from there he moved slowly to Damghan, and sent the general 'AH with the vanguard of the army to Rayy. Rustum b. 'All came forth from his lair, seeing no way out but to surrender. He and the leading figures among the Batiniyyah, who were his military commanders, were seized, and then the banners [of the Sultan], following after the vanguard, appeared in the neigh bourhood of Rayy on the morning of Monday, 26th Jumada I. The Daylamfs came forth, acknowledging their misdeeds and themselves bearing witness to their unbelief and extremist Shi'I tenets. The fuqaha were approached for a ruling (Jatwa) on their position, and they all agreed that they had gone outside the sphere of obedience and had joined the ranks of the malefactors, remaining stubbornly in their refract oriness ; hence it was licit to kill, mutilate and banish them, according to the degree of their offences. And if they were not to be ranked among the heretics (ahl aUilhdd), what were they then, considering that their doctrines and beliefs com prised three types, the adherents of each of which will have blackened faces on the Day of Resurrection?that is, ordinary Shl'ism (al-tashayyu), extremist Shl'ism (al-rafd) and Isma'ilism (al-batin) ? These fuqaha alleged that most of the people did not perform the Muslim worship nor pay the poor-tax, nor did they acknowledge the prescriptions of Islamic law, making no distinction between what was lawful (halal) and what was forbidden (haram). Indeed, they openly proclaim insulting accusations and revile the Companions, and profess all these as a veritable religion. The best of this bad lot are the Mu'tazilah. Those of them who are Batiniyyah do not believe in God, He is exalted and praised, His angels, His scriptures, His prophets, nor the Last Day. They consider all religions as fabrications (mafehdriq) of the learned men (or, "of the philosophers", al-hukama), and believe in the doctrines of antinomianism, considering licit the community of goods and women. The fuqaha considered that Rustum b. 'All had been comparatively restrained, and in this direction was to be</page><page sequence="24">72 C. E. BOSWORTH distinguished from his predecessors, except that he had under his care over 50 free women as wives, who had borne him 33 children, boys and girls. When he was being questioned and reproached about this state of affairs and was told that anyone who allowed practices like this was going far beyond what was lawful, he replied that all these women were con sidered as his legal wives, and their children as his children, that it wai traditional and customary amongst his predecessors to marry this number of women, and that in this respect he was simply following their practice.72 A certain district of the countryside around Rayy harboured a number of the Mazdakites, who ostensibly profess Islam, but nevertheless openly reject the Muslim worship, the poor-tax, fasting and ritual ablutions, and who eat the flesh of dead beasts.73 It was decided that the interests of godly religion would best be served by distinguishing the Bafiniyyah from them. So in a burst of violence, they were crucified along the main street of the city, remaining there whilever they [sc. the Ghaznawid army] were in occupation there, and their property was divided up as plunder. They had previously offered an immense sum of money as a ransom for their safety, but they were told that it was their lives which were going to be taken, and that they were not to be bargained for. Rustum b. 'All, his son and a group of the Daylamfs were carried off to Khurasan, together with the leaders of the Mu'tazilah and extremist Shf Is, so that the people might be free of their disruptive influence. Then Rustum b. 'All's treasure-houses were examined. They brought to light nearly 500,000 dinars' worth of jewels, over 260,000 dinars in coinage and 30,000 dinars' worth of gold and silverware. There were over 5,300 pieces of cloth and 20,000 dinars' worth of sets of woven and regal clothes. Fifty loads of books were carried off, but as for the books of the Mu'tazilah, the philosophers and the extremist Shl'Is, they were all burnt underneath the scaffolds of the people who had been crucified, because they were the basic works of heresy. Hence this region has been cleansed of the Isma'IU dais and the Mu'tazill and extremist Shl'i leaders, and the cause of the Sunnah has been helped to victory. The slave has carefully set forth exactly what God gave him the power to do, in making the cause of the conquering dynasty [sc. the 'Abbasid Caliphate] victorious' ". VII At the outset of his reign, Mas'ad owed a particular debt of gratitude to the Caliph al-Qadir for the latter's prompt recognition of him as his father's heir. Moreover, the acquisition of Rayy, the subjugation of various lesser Kurdish and Daylami chieftains in Jibsl and the tributary status imposed on 'Ala' al-Dawlah b. KakQya, made the Qhaznawids a real power in western Persia, holders of a salient driven up against the Bflyid dominions. The</page><page sequence="25">THE IMPERIAL POLICY OF THE EARLY GHAZNAWIDS 73 new Sultan was not a man of his father's calibre, and this soon became a topic of conversation amongst his advisers.74 His ambitions were as great as his father's had been, but he lacked some of Mahmad's strength of will and execution, and had an inferior sense of judgment. The Ghaznawid empire was by now too big for one man effectively to control, and there were disrup tive elements loose in it: a first wave of the Oghuz, the so-called " Iraqi" ones, had already burst across Persia, and a second wave, that of the Seljuqs and InaliySn, was pressing hard on the Ghaznawid defences in northern Khuras5n. The new conquests in the west could only be held whilever the communications between Khurasan and Rayy remained in the Ghaznawid hands, and by the middle of Mas'ad's reign, the Turkmens were making the journey exceedingly hazardous. Nevertheless, in the early part of his reign, Mas'ud seems to have entertained grandiose hopes of further expansion westwards. The Caliph was to be freed from Bayid control; a grand attack was to be launched against the Fatimids ; and the offensive was to be resumed in the holy war against the Byzantines, who, under the energetic Macedonian emperors, had been pushing back the frontier of Islam in northern Syria. When at Nishapur the Caliph recognised Mas'ad's claim, he confirmed to him the lands newly-conquered in western and central Persia and any other lands of the east and west which he might conquer in the future.75 In his letter to Qadir Khan Yusuf explaining the events which led to his seizure of power, Mas'ud said that after his father's death, the Caliph was writing to him continually, urging him to hasten to Baghdad and free him from the abasement to which the "base-born rabble" (literally, "crowd of tails, rumps", guruh-i adhnab) had reduced him. Furthermore, he continued, the divisio imperil which he had suggested to his brother was intended to free him for warfare in the west against Rum and Egypt, a task which the Caliph had expressly laid upon him.76 As soon as he was firmly established on the throne, Mas'ad adopted a threatening attitude towards the Buyids. The old arguments about the need to clear the Pilgrimage route were raised, but it was KirmSn, where his father had already interfered, that presented an obvious point of attack. Mas'ad voiced his threats thus: "Let him [sc. the Caliph's envoy al-Sulaymani] com</page><page sequence="26">74 C. E. BOSWORTH municate [to the Caliph] that an attack on Kirman is going to be made from the direction of Sistan, and on Oman from the direction of Makran, and the QarSmifah overthrown. An army of unlimited size has already been gathered together ; we need more territory, and the army must willy-nilly be used for this purpose. Were it not out of respect for the seat of the Caliphate, Baghdad would certainly have been attacked and the Pilgrimage route cleared. For my father, when at Rayy, had to leave this task unfinished ; and after his death, if I had not been compelled to return eastwards to Khurasan, I would today undoubtedly be in Egypt or Syria. Also, my children have arrived at the age when they need employment, and another one will soon reach this; it is necessary to find them some official position. We have friendly relations with the Buyids and do not seek to harm them in any way ; but they must be more careful and must restore the Caliphal presence to its rightful position of respect. Further, they must open up the Pilgrimage route, since the people under ray rule have been enjoined to fulfil their obligations properly in accomplishing the Pilgrimage, and for this reason, they will be going under the leadership of one of my commanders. So take note, we have come to this decision, and if they do not make an effort in this direction, we shall use force! For God, His name is exalted, will ask us about this [on the Last Day], because we have at this moment not only the prestige but also the complete equipment and armaments, and an army without number".77 The pretexts were thus the supposed weakness of the BQyid rule in Kirman and the consequent sufferings of the population. Abu'l Fawaris Qiwam al-Dawlah's nephew Aba Kalijar had now succeed ed to the united rule of Khuzistan, Fars and Kirman, with the laqab 'Imad al-DIn. Mas'ad now hoped to take advantage of disorder in Kirman and also to revenge himself on Imad al-DIn for his help to and sheltering of the Kakuyid 'Ala' al-Dawlah. His plan also envisaged an attack across the Persian Gulf from the coast of Makran to Oman. Oman had been under Bayid rule or suzerainty since the time of Mu'izz al-Dawlah and his nephew 'Adud al-Dawlah.78 At the beginning of Mas'ad's reign it was governed by a local leader, Aba'l-Qasim 'All b. al-Husayn b. Mukram (or Mukarram), as a vassal of the Bayids, but the region was much troubled not only by the Karmathians whom Mas'ad mentions in his letter to the Caliph, but also by the KhawSrij of the Ibadiyyah sect in the Jabal Akhdar.79 Mu'izz al-Dawlah's army took over Oman by sailing down the Persian Gulf from Ubulla and across from Siraf on the coast of Fars ; but the ethnic and economic connections of the Makran coast with Oman have</page><page sequence="27">fHE IMPERIAL POLICY OF THE EARLY GHAZNAWtDS 15 always been close, and it was not impossible that the Qhaznawids should successfully mount an expedition from there against Oman, even though they were essentially a land power with little maritime experience.80 That the Ghaznawids might have ruled in Arabia remains, however, one of the unfulfilled possibilities of history. A Ghaznawid army, the one that had been previously used to set Mas'ad's nominee Aba'l-Mu'askar on the throne of Makran, did successfully occupy Kirman in 424/1033. Jalal al-Dawlah wrote to Mas'ud protesting against this aggression and complaining that it was a breach of the non-aggression policy which had tacitly existed between himself and Mahmad: "The Amir of Baghdad, who had been in friendly relation ship with the late Amir [sc. Mahmud], undertook a lengthy correspondence and exchange of views on this topic, sending a messenger and speaking reproachfully. The reply came back that 'that province [sc. Kirman] adjoins my own territory on two sides ; it was in a neglected state and the subjects were complaining volubly about the evildoers. It was a duty incumbent upon me to deliver the Muslims, and, moreover, the Commander of the Faithful sent me patent of investiture. This patent recommended that since the province in question was in a miserable condition and without a ruler, we should annex it.' The Amir of Baghdad spoke reproachfully about this affair to the Caliph, and became desperate. The Caliph replied, 'There is no need to speak at length about this. Baghdad, Kafah and the Sawld, which come under my responsibility, are not kept in a peaceful enough state for you to be able to speak about Kirman. Thus this matter was cut short, and a state of emergency and distress remained. They [sc. the Bayids] were afraid that they would not be able to recapture Kirm5n, because our armies in the region of Hamadan were gathering strength, and they were in fear and trembling lest even Baghdad should slip from their hands".81 As events turned out, the Ghaznawid hold on Kirman only lasted a few months. Their rule and, in particular, their financial exac tions, speedily became odious to the local people. They called in the Bayids again, and an army under 'Imad al-Dins vizier Abu Mansar al-'Adil b. Mafinna expelled the Ghaznawid forces.82 Only in regard to the complaints about the Pilgrimage route did Mas'ad gain some satisfaction: the Caliph wrote back that he had ordered (!) the Buyids to put the route in order and to repair the cisterns along it, and that the caravan from Khurasan and Trans oxiana could now proceed. Mas'ad thereupon appointed one of his leading officials, Khw^jah 'All Mikall, as Salar of the Pilgrimage</page><page sequence="28">76 C. E. BOSWORTH (Amzr al-Hajj).m VIII Our sources on the relations between C^aznah and Baghdad become silent in the latter half of Mas'ud's reign, that is, after 1034. Diplomatic exchanges may have continued on a reduced scale, but the major issues of the earlier part of Mas'ad's reign, the succession question and the recognition of Ghaznawid ambitions in the west, had now been settled. The Sultan became increas ingly preoccupied with the ravages in K[hiirSs5n Qf the Seljaqs. Through the combined pressure of Ibn Kakuya's resurgent power and of the Turkmens, the Ghaznawids were gradually squeezed out of Rayy and western Persia; communications between Khurasan and the west and between Khurasan and KhwSrazm became hard to maintain, and this must have made direct relations with Baghhad more difficult. The picture built up by the Sultan of himself as a just ruler and as protector of the Muslims must also have been somewhat tarnished in the Caliph's eyes by an episode like Mas'ud's sack of Smul in Gurgan in the winter of 426/1034-5. BayhaqI says that Mas'ud made the paradise of Amul into a hell, and that a stream of people went from there to Baghdad and to Mecca to complain of the Sultan's tyranny.84 We do not have any record in BayhaqI of a communication from Mas'ud to the Caliph after his decisive defeat by the Seljoqs at Dandanqan, although he did write to the Qarakhanid Arslan Khan Sulayman b. Qadlr Khan Yasuf explaining the circumstances of the disaster and seeking help against the Seljuqs.85 The loss of g&amp;urasan meant that Mas'ud's grandiose plans, his dreams of conquests in the west and liberation of the Caliph, were now irretrievably lost. There were no longer any pressing reasons for either party to seek close relations with the other; for the next century or so, the future of the Iranian world lay essentially with the Seljuqs.86 NOTES I 1.

This seems to be an echo of looser marriage arrangements which probably persisted in backward parts of Persia, like Daylam and the Caspian provinces, where looser, pre-Islamic Iranian ways long survived. A system of poly gamy, in which a man took a number of wives according to his social status, had prevailed in Sasanid Persia, as had marriage between vety close degrees of relationship. Muslims later considered these practices as promiscuous and incestuous, and the Zoroastrians were often reproached with such crimes as nikah aUummahdt. These customs did not disappear with the coming of Islam, but constantly reappear in heretical Iranian socio-religious move ments, and in the literature of the ?Jiu'ubiyyah, they are frequently quoted amongst the mathalib of the Persians. 73. These must be the Khurramdinan, descendents of Bsbak al-Khurrami's Muhammirah, "those who wear red", who were neo-Mazdakites and who certainly survived in the countryside of Persia long after Babak's execution in 838 ; many of them were subsequently caught up by the propaganda of the Isma'IlI da'is [cf.
