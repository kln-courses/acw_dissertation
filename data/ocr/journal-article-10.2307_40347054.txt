<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Vivisection of the Snark JED MAYER Asa popular writer for children, Lewis Carroll grew adept at subverting the xlLpaternalist logic which subordinated children to the whims of their power- ful elders. This concern with the plight of the powerless extended into other areas as well, and in the 1870s Carroll became increasingly concerned about the use of animals as objects for study in English physiological laboratories. As public debate over the ethics of animal experimentation grew more heated, the Oxford logician turned his analytic skills to the subject of vivisection. Anatomizing the logic which justified the accumulation of scientific knowl- edge at any cost, Carroll made a significant contribution to the developing literature of animal rights. While Carroll was writing up his antivivisection pieces for the popular press, he was also engaged in the composition of his most ambitious nonsense poem, The Hunting of the Snark (1876). In this poem Carroll renders the scientific quest for knowledge and power as an absurd sea journey, in which an eccentric cross-section of English professionals set off in search of an elusive hybrid creature. There is much in the poem to suggest that Carroll's "Agony in Eight Fits" was his subversively nonsensical response to the agonies of the vivisection laboratory being vividly evoked in contemporary papers, journals, and pamphlets. While Carroll's mock-ballad has been read as an economic allegory, as a parody of the Imperial nations' "Race for the Poles," and even as an exploration of the rational philosophical tradition in Western thought, the poem has not been considered in relation to its most immediate social and scientific context, the vivisection controversy in which its author was so deeply embroiled.1 As with the eclectic language of the social critical tradition employed by other antivivisectionist writers, The Hunting of the Snark brings a variety of discourses and perspectives to bear on the alleg- edly disinterested disciplines in the burgeoning life sciences. In the process Carroll's poem exposes the close ties between professional advancement and the advancement of science, between the accumulation of knowledge and the accumulation of wealth and power. In response to growing public concern over the morality of experimental operations on live animals, a Royal Commission investigation into the practice of vivisection was announced on May 24, 1875. Over the ensuing months testimony was gathered from laypersons and experts representing a diverse spectrum of opinion on the topic. While spokespersons of the growing British scientific community testified alongside theologians, medical practitioners, politicians, and animal welfare advocates, it was clear that, in many respects, 429</page><page sequence="2">430 / VICTORIAN POETRY science itself was on trial. More specifically, the matter at issue was the right of scientists to pursue their research unhindered by State intervention or public scrutiny, even when the specific nature of that research was ethically questionable, and as such the investigation represents an important chapter in the history of scientific modernity. The closed doors of the physiological laboratory were opened to public inquiry in a way that implicitly challenged the purity of the scientific pursuit of knowledge. Bruno Latour has argued that "we live in communities whose social bond comes from objects fabricated in laboratories; ideas have been replaced by practices, . . . and universal agreement by groups of colleagues."2 In basing our social actions on knowledge achieved in controlled experimental environments designed to exclude human bias, we agree to live in "a world in which the representation of things through the intermediary of the laboratory is forever dissociated from the representation of citizens through the intermediary of the social contract" (p. 27). Central to the model of scientific modernity advanced by Latour is the space of the laboratory as site for the production of knowledge, a space that can only produce facts as long as its conditions remain pure and uncontaminated. In the life sciences, this prophylaxis is notoriously hard to maintain. While field studies in natural history and anthropology continued to be crucial to the advancement of British scientific knowledge throughout the nineteenth century, toward the latter half of the century the laboratory would come to fig- ure increasingly in scientific rhetoric as a uniquely privileged site of biological knowledge, reserved for a more disciplined, professional class of scientist.3 But while the space of the chemical or physical laboratory required little rhetorical effort to maintain its purity, that of the physiological laboratory was harder to maintain, and the Royal Commission investigation marks a decisive shift in the relationship between scientific and public knowledge. Public concern over vivisection was making itself known in the 1870s through the emerging discourse of antivivisectionist polemic. Although figures central to the movement like Frances Power Cobbe, Mona Caird, and Anna Kingsford drew from a long tradition of pamphlet literature promoting animal welfare, they also participated in the ongoing critique of industrial modernity conducted by social critics like Thomas Carlyle, John Ruskin, Vernon Lee, and Charles Dickens. Notably, these eminent Victorian sages were also avowed antivivisectionists, and their social criticism clearly evolved in response to the challenge raised by the issue of vivisection.4 At stake in the vivisection debates was not only the immunity of the laboratory space from legal and moral criticism, but the immunity of scientific discourses and practices from social criticism. The specialization of scientific knowledge in the later-nine- teenth century raised it above criticism by non-specialists, at the same time as it implicitly devalued and practically displaced the social authority previously enjoyed by the kind of eclectic, general knowledge associated with the man</page><page sequence="3">JED MAYER/ 43 J or woman of letters. T. W. Heyck has charted the parallel rise of the scientific specialist and fall of the generalist sage in the mid- to late-nineteenth century, and the vivisection debates of the 1870s mark a decisive moment in this shift from general toward specialized knowledge.5 Antivivisectionist literature from this period enacted a forceful rhetorical intervention in the division of knowl- edge, subverting the language of scientific discourses by subjecting them to the discourses of aesthetics, politics, theology, and philosophy, eroding the increasingly hermetic and imperturbable monologue of scientific specializa- tion with the dialogic voices of social and aesthetic criticism.6 Lewis Carroll had long been a sharp satirist of the self-presumption of scientific rationality and authority by the time he turned his pen to subvert- ing the rhetoric of vivisection in the 1870s. In the arch-academic figure of Humpty Dumpty, Lewis Carroll drew from his experiences as an Oxford don to create a timely yet enduring caricature of the intellectual despot. Grounding his authority in the ability to manipulate and control language, this would-be philologist exposes the power struggles at work in even the most nonsensical language games: "When I use a word ... it means just what I choose it to mean -neither more nor less."7 The only point at issue in such language games is "which is to be master," yet throughout Carroll's work such bids for linguistic authority are consistently and relentlessly undermined by the heteroglossic play of nonsense language. When Alice challenges the high court of Wonderland with the accusation that they are "nothing but a pack of cards," she wakes herself up from a dream in which human beings and animals are used as counters in an elaborate game of social rituals. Nonsense language provides Carroll and his heroine with the ability to subvert the exploitative language games played by the petty tyrants who lord it over the otherwise powerless beings in a Looking Glass version of late-Victorian England. The language of nonsense can shift rapidly between diverse subjects, making unexpected connections and collapsing differences. It is a language through which hybrid forms proliferate, birthing chimeras that are neither exclusively cultural nor natural, native nor foreign, human nor nonhuman. Carroll's term for such linguistic hybrids was "the portmanteau word"; as he notes in his Introduction to The Hunting of the Snark: "this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the Jabberwock," and, as in that earlier nonsense poem, the "hard words" in the Snark can be explained by "Humpty Dumpty's theory, of two meanings packed into one word like a portmanteau" (p. 10). The most obvious example of this collapsing of words is the name of the hunted creature itself. A "Snark" is most likely a hybridized cross between a "snail" and a "shark," an elusive animal belonging to no fixed environment: at once domestic and threatening, shifting effortlessly between home garden and high sea, the Snark is an appropriately slithy emblem for a hunt that is undertaken on an endless variety of discursive levels. As described in the</page><page sequence="4">432 / VICTORIAN POETRY poem's refrain: They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care; They pursued it with forks and hope, They threatened its life with a railway-share; They charmed it with smiles and soap. (p. 46) Scrutinized on a minute scale, pursued as an exotic delicacy for the dining fork, threatened by industrial development, petted, charmed, washed, and domesticated, the Snark is an amorphous figure for the nonhuman animal of the nineteenth century. As recent cultural histories of the animal have persuasively demon- strated, the proliferation of nonhuman animals in nineteenth-century British life entailed a high degree of slippage between the various roles they played.8 Exotic captives captured or killed in distant parts of the British Empire could serve, alternately or even simultaneously, as food, symbol of masculine or na- tional power, zoological spectacle, scientific specimen, or even domestic pet. This metamorphic quality was seen particularly in the Victorian experimental animal, which refused to stay confined to the clinical space of the laboratory. T. H. Huxley himself noted the elusive nature of the controversial creature when he and his professional colleagues in the life sciences sought to head off the antivivisectionist opposition by proposing a bill for limited legislation of the practice. Expressing his faith in the support of the "fox-hunting Com- mons" in a letter to Darwin, he added: "If physiological experimentation is put down by law, hunting, fishing, and shooting, against which a much better case can be made out, will soon follow."9 The Hunting of the Snark is a poem that raises a number of ethical issues regarding human dominion over the nonhuman animal. Though it was only one among many animal welfare is- sues of the nineteenth century, the vivisection controversy of the 1870s and 1880s brought the problem of cruelty before the British public and rigorously challenged the ethical limitations of scientific inquiry and, by implication, the limitations of human dominance itself.10 Like the vivisection movement that inspired it, the animal politics which inform the composition of the Snark developed in response to a single issue, but evolve rapidly beyond that narrower context, drawing connections between a host of related issues sur- rounding the Victorian animal. The rise of vivisection as an accepted and increasingly widespread practice in British physiological laboratories directly parallels the rise of the professional man of science. Before 1870 vivisection was rarely practiced in Great Britain. Traditionally associated with the perceived materialist excesses of Continental scientific inquiry, the practice was widely regarded by main- stream British medical and scientific communities as cruelly in excess of its usefulness, even after the discovery of the anaesthetic application of ether in</page><page sequence="5">JED MAYER/ 433 1847. u With the increased acceptance of the Darwinian theory of evolution, however, the relatively moribund field of comparative anatomy acquired a renewed sense of purpose. British physiologists had lagged behind their Continental counterparts, led by the high-profile example of Claude Bernard in France, and figures like T. H. Huxley, concerned with the professional advancement of British science, dedicated themselves to closing this national gap.12 As Hilda Kean observes, "The real growth of vivisection in Britain dated from Darwin's arguing for an understanding of the commonality between species; it also dated from the dissemination of Claude Bernard's pioneering work on physiology within the scientific community."13 Michael Foster, an English physiologist who had trained under Bernard, became Praelector of Physiology at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1870, largely thanks to Huxley's support. As the first full-time lecturer in physiology at either Cambridge or Oxford, Foster created a regime for the physiological laboratory informed by the work of Bernard and worthy of comparison to the successful chemical and physical laboratories whose discoveries had proved so lucrative to British science and industry.14 By importing Continental laboratory practices into British institutions, Foster and other physiological researchers sought increased public and profes- sional recognition for the "new biology," but this recognition also entailed an unwonted visibility for these practices. Unlike chemical compounds or kinetic forces, the experimental animal was a nonhuman subject whose con- nection to the social realm outside of the laboratory could not be so easily contained. Advocates of experimental physiology countered public criticism by emphasizing the importance of their work to national progress in health and science. Laying down a rhetorical pattern that would be elaborated in future public debates, writings on vivisection in the early 1870s frequently dwell upon the advances to British scientific and medical knowledge which physiological research was sure to bring. Many advocates, like William Rutherford, emphasized the power of vivisection to enhance Britain's "high moral rank amongst nations; for every step which is calculated to improve the physiological state of the individual must inevitably contribute to make the nation successful in the general struggle for existence."15 The publication of Darwin's Descent of Man in 1871 lent proponents of vivisection an additional sense of rhetorical urgency, as the struggle for existence came to be applied at the level of both research and international scientific politics. As Michael Foster himself argued in an 1874 essay published in Macmillans Magazine: "The success of the human race in the struggle for existence depends on man's being well fed; man is therefore justified in slaying and eating a sheep. The success of the human race in the struggle for existence is dependent on knowledge being increased; man is therefore justified in slaying a frog or a rabbit, if it can be shown that human knowledge is thereby enlarged."16 In</page><page sequence="6">434 / VICTORIAN POETRY such arguments, the very principles which underwrote comparisons between animal and human physiology could be used to justify the right of humans to use "inferior" animals as tools of knowledge. The relationship between the rhetoric of social Darwinism and the politics of professional advancement was frequently exposed by the polemical writings of the antivivisectionists, which emphasized the pragmatic self-interest motivating professional advancement in the sciences. In his first antivivisec- tionist publication, Lewis Carroll laments that, in the new age of science, the world "has seen and tired of the worship of Nature, of Reason, of Humanity; for this nineteenth century has been reserved the development of the most refined religion of all- the worship of Self."17 Carroll's "Vivisection as a Sign of the Times" was published in the Pall Mall Gazette on February 12, 1875, shortly before the Royal Commission investigation and during the early composition of The Hunting of the Snark. Focusing on the use of vivisection for educational purposes, Carroll questions the civilizing effect of scientific knowledge, thereby challenging the ideology of human progress that authorized vivisection and emphasizing the will to dominance in the quest for higher knowledge. Such a quest, he implies, is in conflict with the formation of a humane moral character. Vivisection endows professors of physiology and their students with knowledge at the expense of sympathy, intellectual power at the expense of compassion for the powerless. Carroll's polemic culminates in an apocalyptic vision of a world ordered to the logic of the physiological laboratory, linking the subjection of animals to the subjection of women and the working classes: "The enslavement of his weaker brethren- ' the labour of those who do not enjoy, for the enjoyment of those who do not labour'- the degradation of woman- the torture of the animal world- these are the steps of the ladder by which man is ascending to his higher civilisation" (p. 5) Like many of the early feminists who played a central role in the antivivisection movement, Carroll draws a direct connection between the oppression of women, laborers, and animals.18 Vivisection is an "evil," Carroll argues, "that tends continually to spread. And if it be tolerated or even ignored now, the age of universal educa- tion, when the sciences, and anatomy among them, shall be the heritage of all, will be heralded by a cry of anguish from the brute creation that will ring through the length and breadth of the land!" (p. 5). Carroll concludes with a grim prophecy of a time "when the man of science, looking forth over a world which will then own no other sway than his, shall exult in the thought that he has made of this fair green earth, if not a heaven for man, at least a hell for animals" (p. 5). This is a powerful example of antivivisection polemic, only partially weakened by the use of this controversial issue as a fulcrum for Carroll's criticism of secular education. Within the context of Carroll's fierce critique of scientific authority, however, secularism may be read as alluding to the specialization of knowledge and the immunity of scientific inquiry from</page><page sequence="7">JED MAYER/ 435 moral criticism as much as to the more obvious exclusion of religious values from State-funded education. The host of issues addressed by the piece are unified by a common concern with a misuse of power that links the practices of the physiological laboratory with a multitude of other forms of exploita- tion-political, economic, domestic, and scientific. Carroll's global vision of human dominance and exploitation of the nonhuman makes explicit the connection between the closed chambers of the physiological laboratory and the open fields of natural historical study and collection. Although the diverse inquiries of early-Victorian natural history were gradually divided into increasingly specialized fields of study, the amateur collector and the professional scientist shared a common preoccupation with studying and classifying the nonhuman.19 Significantly, the self-proclaimed natural historian on the Snark-hunting expedition is a Butcher notable for his extraordinary writing and lecturing abilities as well as for his surgical skills. In "Fit the Fifth: The Beaver's Lesson" the crew set out to explore "a spot unfrequented by man, / A dismal and desolate valley" (p. 46) armed only with "paper, portfolio, pens, / And ink in unfailing supplies" (p. 50). As "strange creepy creatures came out of their dens / And watched them with wondering eyes," the Butcher proceeds to write "with a pen in each hand," explaining "all the while in a popular style," which his companion, the Beaver, "could well understand" (p. 50). Like the advocates of vivisection, the Butcher is adept at representing his specialist knowledge in accessible language when it suits him, and his ambidexterity implies an ability to straddle multiple discourses. Carroll here emphasizes the close connections between field, laboratory, and press in late-nineteenth-century scientific culture. The Butcher's credentials as a natural historian are nearly complete, requiring only that he prove his knowledge, an opportunity afforded by the sounds of the Jubjub bird, whom he proceeds to anatomize. Like the experimental physiologist, the Butcher unveils "what has hitherto been / Enveloped in absolute mystery," and like a true Oxbridge lecturer he conveys his knowledge in a lengthy "Lesson in Natural History" (p. 53) Appropriately for a bird found in a newly explored territory, the Jubjub is considered in terms of its economic as much as for its scientific value. Carroll's mock natural history lesson plays with contemporary com- parisons between the field research of natural historians and the exploratory research of experimental physiologists. Far from distancing their work from the natural world outside of the laboratory, the defenders of vivisection fre- quently emphasized the connection between the experimental animal and the larger world of nature. In Claude Bernard's vivid words, the physiologist "stir[s] the fetid or throbbing ground of life" in the experimental laboratory.20 The scientist is like an explorer in that "true science is like a flowering and delectable plateau which can be attained only after climbing craggy steeps</page><page sequence="8">436 / VICTORIAN POETRY and scratching one's legs against branches and brushwood" (p. 15). In The Fortnightly Review, John Bridges described the vivisectionist as a kind of "sci- entific geographer at home" obtaining "precise knowledge of the geographical structure of a country, of the elevation of its plateaux and mountain ranges, of the geological features, and of the average rainfall in different latitudes and longitudes."21 The country described in this rather improbably extended metaphor is, of course, the inner landscape of the experimental animal, an internal geography which advocates of vivisection in the nineteenth century frequently represented as coterminous with the landscapes which had long been the province of natural historians. Yet of course these landscapes, and the animals who inhabited them, had a growing number of defenders and guardians; thus, the rhetorical expansion of the physiologist's dominion outside of the laboratory came into conflict with the evolving principles of environmental advocacy as well as the antivivisection movement. The Butcher's lesson cunningly blurs the distinction between physiologi- cal and geographical exploration, implying a common linkage between the accumulation of wealth and the accumulation of knowledge. Animal bodies may serve as both objects of study and sources of material wealth, and Carroll's language emphasizes the slippage between these two related spheres of activ- ity. Beginning with a description of the Jubjub's behavior and temperament, the Natural History Lesson shifts suddenly into a peculiarly cultural mode by considering the bird's plumage in relation to contemporary fashion trends: "As to temper the Jubjub's a desperate bird, Since it lives in perpetual passion: Its taste in costume is entirely absurd- It is ages ahead of the fashion." (p. 54) Given the use of bird's plumage as a Victorian fashion accessory, Jubjub feath- ers would appear to be a commodity well worth speculating on for future trends in haberdashery. If such trends prove fickle, the bird will always serve as a good source of meat, and the Butcher goes on to provide an enticing description of its flavor, as well as directions for storage of this exotic delicacy: "Its flavour when cooked is more exquisite far Than mutton, or oysters, or eggs: (Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar, And some, in mahogany kegs.)" (p. 54) But of course this creature is also a potential source of knowledge as well as food and clothing, and the Natural History Lesson concludes with directions for taxidermic preparation of this rara avis: "You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue:</page><page sequence="9">JED MAYER/ 437 You condense it with locusts and tape: Still keeping one principal object in view- To preserve its symmetrical shape." (p. 54) Properly prepared in this manner, the creature would certainly make an invaluable addition to the museum of the Zoological Society of London, solidifying the Butcher's reputation as a scientific traveller of merit.22 Clearly this bird is a most desirable commodity, a source of considerable wealth and knowledge for the collector willing to brave its chilling cry, earlier compared to "a pencil that squeals on a slate," anticipating its imminent translation into natural historical discourse (p. 48). Carroll's crew regards this creature exclusively in terms of its human use value, emphasizing the anthropocentric self-interest which will ultimately transform this "fair green earth" into "a hell for animals." Carroll's mock-ballad renders the quest for scientific knowledge in terms of an absurd sea-voyage, the infinite flexibility of nonsense language and logic enabling far-reaching connections between British maritime expansion and the march of scientific progress. Scientific classification of new species could serve as a means of asserting cultural dominance and intellectual possession in newly explored regions. In her extensive work on the "classifying imagina- tion" of the nineteenth century, Harriet Ritvo has shown some of the many ways in which classification represented European possession of exotic territories, as well as intellectual mastery of their natural history. . . . Citizens of a prosperous global country like Great Britain easily conflated such metaphorical dominion with more practical or literal modes of ap- propriation. Thus, naturalists in the mother country automatically claimed the right to classify colonial plants and animals- their subjects in more than one sense.23 In his antivivisection writing Carroll suggests connections between the op- pressive anthropocentrism at work in the laboratory and in the field, and in The Hunting of the Snark he makes nonsense of the natural historian's rational ordering of the nonhuman world. In his mock lecture on the Jubjub bird, Carroll emphasizes the relation between the discursive and material "modes of appropriation" in collecting animal specimens, echoing the growing concern expressed by some late-nineteenth-century natural historians over the impact made by their often ruthless scientific harvesting. 24 As Alfred Russell Wal- lace laments in Island Life: I cannot avoid here referring to the enormous waste of labour and money with comparatively scanty and unimportant results to natural</page><page sequence="10">438 / VICTORIAN POETRY history of most of the great scientific voyages of the various civilized governments during the present century. They have brought home frag- mentary collections, made in widely scattered localities, and these have been usually described in huge folios, whose value is often in inverse proportion to their bulk and cost The result of this wretched system is that the productions of some of the most frequently visited and most interesting islands on the globe are still very imperfectly known, while their native plants and animals are being yearly exterminated.25 Though Wallace's primary concern is clearly the loss to scientific knowledge in such exterminations, his chilling vision of widespread species extinction resonates with Carroll's grim prophecy of a world entirely under the sway of human self interest. Classification is yet one more means by which nonhuman animals can be exploited for professional gain, the lists of newly recorded varieties and species increasing the bulk and cost of zoological monographs in inverse proportion to the creatures' dwindling populations. The Snark itself poses an ambiguous threat to the crew, one aspect of which is the difficulty of classifying it. Indeed, the Snark's threat resides in its very ambiguity, and the crew members anxiously speculate on the best means of categorizing their prey in order to nullify it. The Bellman, like his fellow crew member the Butcher, is something of a natural history buff, and provides the poem's most extensive anatomy of their prey, which he rounds off with a description of "each particular batch" of the creatures, "distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite / From those that have whiskers, and scratch / For," he warns the crew, "although common Snarks do no manner of harm, Yet, I feel it my duty to say, Some are Boojums- " The Bellman broke off in alarm, For the Baker had fainted away. (p. 32) The mere name of this dangerous kind of Snark is enough to inspire fear in the crew's hearts, especially in the Baker's, whose uncle had long ago warned him of the Boojum. "'If your Snark be a Snark,'" the Baker's uncle encourages him, u&lt;Fetch it home by all means- you may serve it with greens / And it's handy for striking a light'" (p. 38). Like the Jubjub bird, this class of Snark is a valuable natural resource; that is, unless it's something else: utBut oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day, If your Snark be a Boojum! For then You will softly and suddenly vanish away, And never be met with again!'" (p. 38) The obscure nature of the existential threat raised by the Boojum variety of</page><page sequence="11">JED MAYER/ 439 Snark has inspired endless interpretive speculations on the poem's philosophi- cal symbolism. In terms of the poem's critique of anthropocentrism, however, it is worth noting that the problem raised by the ambiguously classified Snark may be rendered in ethical terms: a Snark is either a nonhuman animal to be exploited, or it is something else. Suggestively, this is also another way of framing the very question at the heart of the Royal Commission's investigation into the practice of vivisection: either the experimental animal is an object to be used for the advancement of knowledge, or it is something else. After the theory of natural selection species could no longer be regarded as fixed, isolate forms, and the border between higher and lower forms must now be seen as permeable, not absolute. The very theory which made viable the extension of physiological principles discovered in animal subjects to human applications also raised troubling ethical questions regarding our freedom in experimenting on creatures with whom we have so much in common. With the publication of Darwin's Descent of Man in 1871, further evidence of the kinship between human and nonhuman animals was made available to both defenders and critics of vivisection at a crucial moment in the growing con- troversy over the practice. As Richard French observes: Both sides in the vivisection controversy found evolutionary doctrines of the relationship between man and animals a weapon of debate to be used gingerly: such doctrines could be adduced both in support of the validity of extrapolating experimental results obtained with animals to human beings and in support of arguments on behalf of animals as "our weaker brethren" or "our dumb fellow creatures," frequently put forth by antivivisectionists." (p. 383) Antivivisectionists made persuasive use of evolutionary theory in challenging the ethical principles of experimental physiologists. In "Vivisection as a Sign of the Times" Carroll questions the evolutionary superiority of the vivisection- ist over his experimental subject as well as those who have not transcended their sympathy for the brute creation: "Is the anatomist, who can contemplate unmoved the agonies he is inflicting, for no higher purpose than to gratify a scientific curiosity, or to illustrate some well-established truth, a being higher or lower, in the scale of humanity, than the ignorant boor whose very soul would sicken at the horrid sight?" (p. 4). This passage would later be quoted by Frances Power Cobbe and its theme echoed by other antivivisectionists over the ensuing years of debate.26 As Paul H. White argues, "Evolutionary continuities between humans and animals, useful in underwriting practices like vivisection and ethology, could also facilitate claims about the degenera- tion of 'gentlemen of science' whose natural sympathies for their human and animal fellows had been deadened by the abstract pursuit of truth."27 Physiologists were, of course, quick to defend their sense of compassion and</page><page sequence="12">440 / VICTORIAN POETRY even to characterize themselves as animal lovers. The notion of evolutionary kinship between human and nonhuman animals, however, was rarely invoked in pro-vivisectionist literature, though when the connection was emphasized it could portray the physiological experiment as a merging of scientist and subject. In an essay for Nature, Edwin Ray Lankester could go so far as to claim that the "physiologist suffers with his experimental animal, and the mutual suffering of both vivisector and vivisected becomes a sacrifice offered up on the altar of Science."28 While such a claim for mutual suffering might be directed toward assuaging public concerns over the alleged inhumanity of physiologists, it nevertheless implies a connection between human and nonhuman animals that calls into question the species hierarchy structuring the laboratory's methodological order: the supposed identity between the physiologist and his experimental animal could be seen as subverting the very principle of objectivity on which good science traditionally depends. Antivivisectionist literature often narrowed the rhetorical gap between scientist and subject which it was so crucial for proponents of vivisection to maintain. In his essay "Some Popular Fallacies About Vivisection," published in the June 1, 1875 issue of the Fortnightly Review, Carroll anatomized and chal- lenged a number of rhetorical duplicities frequently maintained by defenders of the practice, among them the belief "that man is infinitely more important than the lower animals, so that the infliction of animal suffering, however great, is justifiable if it prevent human suffering, however small."29 Carroll observes of this fallacy: "A strange assertion this, from the lips of people who tell us that man is twin-brother to the monkey!" (p. 1073). Emphasizing this kinship, he goes on to question whether science can be expected to restrict itself to nonhuman animal subjects, challenging the assumption that "while science arrogates to herself the right of torturing at her pleasure the whole sentient creation up to man himself, some inscrutable boundary line is there drawn, over which she will never venture to pass" (p. 1080). Echoing the apocalyptic rhetoric of his earlier antivivisection piece, Carroll goes on to invoke "the possible advent of a day when anatomy shall claim as legitimate subjects for experiment, first, our condemned criminals- next, perhaps, the inmates of our refuges for incurables- then the hopeless lunatic, the pauper hospital-patient, and generally 'him that hath no helper'" (p. 1081). Carroll suggests that the erosion of compassion for animals entails an erosion of compassion for other humans and goes on to conclude his polemic by imagining a day when the roles of scientist and experimental subject will be reversed: And when that day shall come, O my brother-man, you who claim for yourself and for me so proud an ancestry- tracing our pedigree through the anthropomorphoid ape up to the primeval zoophyte- what potent charm have you in store to win exemption from the common doom?</page><page sequence="13">JED MAYER/ 441 Will you represent to that grim spectre, as he gloats over you, scalpel in hand, the inalienable rights of man? (p. 1081) Carroll here makes explicit the connection between human rights and animal rights, a connection enabled by the rhetoric of evolutionary kinship developed in this and other antivivisectionist texts. Yet Carroll's approach differs mark- edly from the feminist identification between the oppression of women and of animals often employed by animal welfare advocates. As Coral Lansbury argues, "Women saw themselves as horses being flogged and beaten, and many saw their own condition hideously and accurately embodied in the figure of an animal bound to a table by straps with the vivisector's knife at work on its flesh" (p. 84). Though Carroll clearly expresses a similar sense of identification at certain moments in his own antivivisection writing, his method in the Snark is instead to expose the similarities between aggressive and acquisitive humans and the animals to which they hold themselves falsely superior. The language of nonsense makes possible the imaginative merging of human and nonhuman animals, just as it plays with tying and untying other- wise separate strands of discourse. The sudden comic shifts between nautical, zoological, mercantile, mathematical, and culinary language in The Hunting of the Snark enable conceptual leaps between species of discourse just as the hybrid creatures that come to life in the poem enable discursive leaps between animal species. The Jubjub bird, in addition to the traditionally nonhuman characteristics discussed earlier, also exhibits some very human qualities in the Butcher's description. After commenting upon its absurd taste in costume, the Butcher is quick to add: "But it knows any friend it has met once before: It never will look at a bribe: And in charity-meetings it stands at the door, And collects - though it does not subscribe." (p. 54) Like the Beaver to whom the Butcher is lecturing, the Jubjub appears nonhu- man but is shown to share many of the same qualities (as well as some of the foibles) of the humans who observe it. Carroll's work is, of course, filled with such comic hybrid creatures, making gentle Darwinian play out of such memo- rable figures as a tea-drinking March Hare, a watch-wearing White Rabbit, a baby who turns into a piglet, and a veal-calf-turned-Mock-Turtle who weeps pathetically over his imminent role as lead player in the soup course. The classification problems raised by the Snark bring up some uncom- fortable questions regarding the connections between human and nonhuman animals, and the Darwinian play becomes more deadly earnest in this later nonsense work. In order to help his crew identify their elusive and ambigu- ous prey, the Bellman enters into the mode of the natural history lecturer</page><page sequence="14">442 / VICTORIAN POETRY when he describes: "The five unmistakable marks / By which you may know, wheresoever you go, / The warranted genuine Snarks" (p. 31). Like the Jubjub bird the Snark is eminently edible. In addition to going well with greens, we learn that the Snark's taste is "meagre and hollow, but crisp: / Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist, / With a flavour of Will-o-the-wisp." Presum- ably this is why the crew is hunting the creature, yet with each subsequent "unmistakable mark" described by the Bellman, the Snark comes to appear more human, and less appropriate as a choice of prey. A creature of leisure, the Snark habitually gets up late, "frequently breakfasts at five-o'clock tea / And dines on the following day" (p. 31). Like many of Carroll's Oxford col- leagues, the Snark is also marked by its "slowness in taking a jest," at which it "will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed: / And it always looks grave at a pun" (p. 31). This humorless creature comes to appear the antithesis of Carroll's playful nonsense temperament. As the Snark grows more human, he begins to take on the characteristics of the very upwardly mobile captains of science and industry who pursue him. In Carroll's elaborate satire, the greedy and acquisitive pursuers become the pursued, in a reversal of position enabled by the interspecies slippage running through the evolutionary rhetoric of the vivisection debates. Like his world- traveling pursuers, whose ship represents a portable microcosm of English life, the Snark has a "fondness for bathing-machines, / Which it constantly carries about, / And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes - / A sentiment open to doubt" (p. 32). Bathing machines appeared to represent for Carroll the most degraded aspects of bourgeois cultural values, similar to what neo- gothic architecture represented to figures like John Ruskin and William Mor- ris. In the second chapter of Alice in Wonderland, "The Pool of Tears," Carroll imagines a British landscape forever blighted by the homogenizing culture of seaside tourism: "Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion that, wherever you go to on the English coast, you find a number of bathing-machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging-houses, and behind them a railway station" (pp. 24-25). Uttered as a wry observation through the mouth of Carroll's young heroine, the point is nevertheless a serious one. As in Ruskin's and Morris' polemical writings, such commercial development represents not merely a betrayal of aesthetic taste but also a failure in ecological stewardship, blighting the landscape for economic gain. With the Snark's fifth and final identifying mark, "ambition," the portrait of the Snark as an upwardly mobile professional man is complete. As in Carroll's antivivisection writing, human and nonhuman roles are dramatically reversed, and the object of the hunt comes to resemble the Banker, the Barrister, and the other ambitious humans who pursue it. Like the experimental animal, the Snark is a hybridized cross between the ambitious man of science and the creature whose reactions he</page><page sequence="15">JED MAYER/ 443 charts and tallies. When the Baker finally confronts this animal, he suddenly disappears even while attempting to categorize his prey. For the Snark was a Boojum, you see, something more than a creature to be hunted, anatomized, and turned into a commodity. It is, perhaps, the Snark' s resemblance to his pursuers that finally displaces them: once that "inscrutable boundary line" between species is crossed, the definition of the human itself begins to blur. Similarly, the often "inscrutable boundary line" between the space of the laboratory and the public sphere grew increasingly difficult to maintain during the vivisection controversies of the 1870s. Opponents on either side of this debate might be characterized in terms of their respective interests in maintaining or challenging this division. If the Snark is a poem that reflects the antivivisectionist rhetoric of the period in which it was composed, it does so without ever entering into the world of the laboratory. In the rhetoric of scientific boosterism satirized in Carroll's antivivisection writings, the labora- tory was represented as a space that could contain the unruly world of nature within its controlled atmosphere. The physiological laboratory, like the chemi- cal or the physical laboratory, was designed to control and observe natural phenomena. Yet in the emergence of the laboratory as a space for mediating and controlling the phenomena of nature there also emerges a fundamental shift in the significance of the nonhuman. As Bruno Latour argues, in the development of the laboratory, we witness the intervention of a new actor . . . : inert bodies, incapable of will and bias but capable of showing, signing, writing, and scrib- bling on laboratory instruments before trustworthy witnesses. These nonhumans, lacking souls but endowed with meaning, are even more reliable than ordinary mortals, to whom will is attributed but who lack the capacity to indicate phenomena in a reliable way. (p. 23) With the emergence of experimental physiology in the 1860s and 1870s, however, there also emerged a new nonhuman actor, one which many op- ponents of vivisection would argue did possess a soul, and was thus endowed with a different kind of meaning than the "inert bodies" formerly "signing, writing, and scribbling on laboratory instruments." Animal rights discourses developing over the course of the nineteenth century sought to give a voice to the voiceless. With the advent of experimental physiology as a professional discipline in Great Britain, there emerged a struggle between competing testimonies of the nonhuman that pitted the scientific community against other animal representatives. In the testimonies of researchers during the Royal Commission inves- tigations, the knowledge acquired in physiological research was frequently characterized as "pure."30 Yet these investigations also made public the meth- ods by which such knowledge was attained. In the dramatic words of Claude</page><page sequence="16">444 / VICTORIAN POETRY Bernard: "If a comparison were required to express my idea of the science of life, I should say that it is a superb and dazzlingly lighted hall which may be reached only by passing through a long and ghastly kitchen" (p. 15). Such images are rare in the testimonies of British physiologists, since unlike their French counterparts their words were scrutinized by a socially prominent animal welfare lobby. Yet advocates of vivisection could not afford to close themselves off from public concerns entirely. In seeking increased public recognition and opportunities for professional advancement, experimental physiologists stressed the connection between the nature of their work and the practical concerns of their public. In stressing the value of physiological knowledge, Michael Foster asks: Does the reader know that in all great surgical operation there are mo- ments of imminent danger lest life steal away in gushes of blood from the divided vessels, danger now securely met by ligatures scientifically and deftly tied? Does he know that there was a time when the danger was imperfectly met by hot searing-irons and other rude means, and that the introduction of ligatures, with their proper application, is due to experiments, cruel experiments, if you like, on dogs and other dumb animals?" (p. 375) While the practical benefits of animal experimentation were primarily specu- lative in the later-nineteenth century, the "ligature" between scientific and public knowledge was a necessary one, despite the controversy that knowledge of experimental methods would necessarily bring. Antivivisectionist literature became increasingly deft in tying such liga- tures, challenging divisions between scientific practice and public scrutiny, scientific discourses and social criticism, and vivisectionists and their nonhu- man subjects. Lewis Carroll's The Hunting of the Snark, which merges the human and the nonhuman and subversively mocks human dominance and claims to scientific authority, is a poem that reflects the preoccupations of its author and its time and place of composition. By means of the flexibility and elastic- ity of nonsense language, the poem tightens the ligature between a variety of discourses on the nonhuman to create a global vision of a world reduced to the logic of the physiological laboratory. The poem was published in February of 1876, and like the Royal Commission's report made public a month earlier, it was not warmly received.31 After months of debate and controversy over the Commission's findings, the Cruelty to Animals Act received Royal Assent on August 15, 1876. Requiring registration and licensing of experimenters but providing little assurance of supervision and inspection of research practices, it was an Act that displeased both sides in the vivisection debates. Supporters of vivisection like Edwin Ray Lankester would have advocated fewer rather than more restrictions: "If you allow experiments at all, you must admit the more</page><page sequence="17">JED MAYER/ 445 the better, since it is very certain that for many years to come the problems of physiology demanding experimental solution will increase in something like geometrical ratio, instead of decreasing."32 This has proven to be an ac- curate prediction, one that was also made by Lankester's opponents in the vivisection controversies. For figures like Lankester, this exponential increase in experiments on live animals would represent a victory for science, while for figures like Lewis Carroll it would suggest that we have "made of this fair green earth, if not a heaven for man, at least a hell for animals." Notes 1 Although allegorical interpretations of the Snark appear to have served as an intel- lectual parlor game for academics of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, much like Robert Browning's "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came," the poem has received little attention over the last half century. For an exhaustive survey of some of the more ingenious of these interpretations, the reader is directed to consult the sumptuously illustrated and updated version of Martin Gardner's famed 1962 edition, The Annotated Hunting of the Snark: The Definitive Edition (New York: W. W. Norton, 2006). All subsequent references to The Hunting of the Snark are to this edition and will be cited parenthetically in the text. 2 Bruno Latour, We Have Never Been Modern, trans.

Press, 1997). David Perkins' Romanticism and Animal Rights (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2003) and Christine Kenyon-Jones' Kindred Brutes: Animals in Romantic Period Writing (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2001) have made valuable connections between the politics and aesthetics of Romanticism and the rise of the animal welfare movement in Great Britain, while the Mellen Press has reprinted six key nineteenth-century works in its ongoing Mellen Animal Rights Library series. Many of these are edited and introduced by Rod Preece, whose recently published Brute Souls, Happy Beasts, and Evolution: The Historical Status of Animals (Vancouver: UBC Press, 2005) presents an exhaustive philosophical and historical background to the study of the relationship between animal welfare and evolutionary theories in nineteenth-century British culture. 9 Leonard Huxley, Life and Letters of Thomas Henry Huxley, 2 vols.
