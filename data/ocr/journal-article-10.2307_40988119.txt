<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Recognition of Health and Nutrition Factors in Food Demand Analysis Oral Capps, Jr., and John D. Schmitz A theoretical framework in which to formally consider health and nutrition factors in demand analyses is developed. The framework is employed to empirically identify and assess the impacts of information pertaining to cholesterol on the demands for beef, pork, poultry, and fish. Issues in considering health and nutrition factors in food demand analysis are documented. Key words: health and nutrition factors, demand analysis, Rotterdam model. Nutrition and health issues appear to be major concerns for consumers. In a recent Food Mar- keting Institute survey, 93% of the respondents indicated concerns about the nutritional con- tent of foods. Almost two-thirds of those sur- veyed in a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) study reported they had adjusted household diets in the previous three years for health or nutrition reasons (Jones and Wei- mer). Concerns are on the rise for particular nutrients, notably fat and cholesterol (Borra). As well, organizations representing producer groups appear to be very conscious of health and nutrition concerns in the promotion of products. The deliberate or inadvertent omis- sion of such nontraditional, noneconomic variables may have deleterious consequences in the estimation of structural demand rela- tionships.

A study of the relation- ship between skim and whole milk prices at retail might be upset by a "cholesterol scare" if such a scare received widespread public attention and if the experimental de- sign or statistical procedure did not remove its effect. (P. 134) Bringing together diverse viewpoints of ag- ricultural economists specializing in demand analysis and those interested in human nutri- tion is no easy task. The intent of this article is to formally consider the role of health and nutrition factors in food demand analysis. Spe- cific objectives are: (a) To conduct a literature review of selected studies that deal with health and nutrition issues, (b) To develop a theo- retical framework in which to formally con- sider health and nutrition factors in demand analyses. Much consideration is given to the growing interest with regard to the issue of structural change in demand analysis, (c) To employ the theoretical framework to empiri- cally identify and assess the impacts of infor- mation pertaining to cholesterol on the de- mands for beef, pork, poultry, and fish. Annual data dealing with U.S. per capita consumption levels and corresponding nominal prices over the period 1966 to 1988 are used in this ex- ercise, (d) To document key issues in consid- ering health and nutrition factors in food de- mand analysis. Western Journal of Agricultural Economics, 16(1): 21-35 Copyright 1991 Western Agricultural Economics Association</page><page sequence="2">22 July 1991 Western Journal of Agricultural Economics Literature Review Agricultural economists possess some prior experience in analyses of health and nutrition issues. Borrowing in part from Huffman, it is possible to classify such analyses into various categories: (a) assessment of dietary quality, (b) determination of demand for specific nu- trients, (c) construction of hedonic price or consumer goods characteristics models for nu- trients, and (d) assessment of attitudes and information about health and nutrition on the demand for food products. Assessment of Dietary Quality Assessments of dietary quality are important from the standpoint of personal health and public nutritional policy. Objectives of gov- ernment programs such as the Food Stamp Program (FSP); National School Lunch Pro- gram (NSLP); Women, Infants, and Children Program (WIC); and National School Break- fast Program (NSBP) include the attainment of nutritionally adequate diets, particularly for the segment of the population whose incomes fall below the poverty level. Typically, definitions of nutritionally ade- quate diets rest on: (a) nutrient-to-calorie den- sity ratios (Blanciforti, Green, and Lane; Windham et al.; Johnson, Burt, and Morgan); (b) Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) (Huffman; Peterkin, Kerr, and Hama); and (c) Nutrient Achievement or Adequacy Ratios (NARs) (Lane; Davis and Neenan). Nutrient density is the unit measurement of each nu- trient per 1,000 kilocalories. RDAs, although arguably the best standards for assessment of nutrient adequacy, are not available for all nu- trients. Peterkin, Kerr, and Hama suggest that if 80% of the RDAs for 1 1 nutrients (protein, calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, vita- min A, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, vi- tamin B12, and vitamin C) is met, the diet either for individuals or households is deemed nutritionally adequate. In fact, there are rough- ly 45 essential nutrients, but RDAs have not been established for many of these. Huffman defines nutritional adequacy in terms of meet- ing 100% of the RDAs for 13 nutrients, the 1 1 previously mentioned as well as food energy and niacin. NARs express the amount of a nutrient consumed as a percentage of the amount recommended as established by the RDAs. Lane calculates NARs for nine nutri- ents: food energy, protein, calcium, iron, vi- tamin A, vitamin C, thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin for households in rural California. Da- vis and Neenan calculate NARs for protein, calcium, iron, vitamin A, and vitamin C for households located in central Florida. Johnson, Burt, and Morgan employ the 1977-78 USDA Nationwide Food Consump- tion Survey (1977-78 NFCS) to focus on the influence of participation in the FSP on dietary quality. They provide evidence to indicate that participation in the FSP positively affects di- etary quality. Huffman, using the spring por- tion of the 1 977-78 NFCS together with probit and logit analysis, finds that participation in the WIC program is positively associated with the attainment of nutritionally adequate diets. Lane finds that participation in the FSP and the Food Distribution Program are key factors of dietary quality. Davis and Neenan provide evidence to indicate that participation in the FSP and the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program are important determi- nants of nutritional status. As well, it is of interest to identify economic and demographic factors which may affect di- etary quality so as to determine target groups for food policy programs. Huffman for in- stance identifies and assesses economic and demographic factors associated with attaining nutritionally adequate diets. Key factors in- clude race and food expenditures per adult equivalent as well as age, sex, and education of the household head. Blanciforti, Green, and Lane, using the dietary component of the sec- ond year of the 1972-73 Consumer Expendi- ture Survey conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), examine the demand for rel- atively more versus relatively less nutritious food, as defined by nutrient-to-calorie density ratios, for seven stages of the life cycle. They recommend the use of nutrition education as a policy tool to improve the nutritional quality of diets. Demand for Specific Nutrients It is necessary to determine the effects of var- ious economic and sociodemographic vari- ables on demands for nutrients as well as on the incidence of nutrition risk. Knowledge of factors which influence nutrition demands is useful in the design and implementation of programs to promote improvements in nutri-</page><page sequence="3">Capps and Schmitz Health and Nutrition Factors in Demand Analysis 23 Table 1.

A typical model of demand for specific nu- trients resembles the Engel function. The for- mulation is as follows: (1) Nu = ak + ÃŸkYt + Ã²klZu + Ã´k2Z2i + . . . + 6^ + 0*1^1/ + 0*2^2/ + â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ + &lt;t&gt;khXhi + â‚¬*iJ where Nki corresponds to the intake of nutrient k by individual / or household / ; YÂ¡ corresponds to the income level of the /th economic agent (individual or household); Zu, . . . , Zgi con- stitute a set of binary variables that denote participation in various government food as- sistance programs by the /th economic agent; and Xu, . . . , Xhi refer to a set of sociodemo- graphic factors. Considerable literature exists on links be- tween nutrition and income. The effectiveness of income transfers to alleviate nutritional de- ficiencies varies across countries. Timmer and Alderman, using household budget data from Indonesia, examine the determinants of de- mand for calories in order to develop food policy recommendations. They suggest that with stable prices, income redistribution may improve the nutritional status of the popula- tion. Similarly, Pinstrup-Anderson and Cai- cedo, using household survey data from Cali, Colombia, find that income redistribution may increase the demand for calories and protein at low income levels. On the other hand, Adri- an and Daniel, using data from the 1965-66 USDA Household Food Consumption Sur- vey, provide evidence to indicate that nutrient consumption in the United States, where a far higher proportion of the population has higher incomes, is not typically responsive to income. Selected studies pertaining to the demand for specific nutrients are exhibited in table 1 . Demand models for nutrients are typically used to predict the nutrient intakes of individuals, given anthropomorphic, economic, and so- ciodemographic characteristics. In order to in- vestigate the nutritional achievement of indi-</page><page sequence="4">24 July 1991 Western Journal of Agricultural Economics viduals, NARs may then be calculated. In this way, the construction of demand models for nutrients leads to assessment of dietary qual- ity. In addition, the construction of the models permits analyses not only of the impacts of various government programs but also of so- ciodemographic factors on levels of nutrient intakes. Cross-sectional data sets are used in the var- ious selected studies. Except for the study by Price et al., the respective data sets pertain to national samples, typically from the 1977-78 NFCS. Common nutrients considered are food energy, iron, vitamin A, vitamin C, and cal- cium. Government programs frequently con- sidered are the FSP, NSLP, and NSBP. In most instances, evidence exists to indicate that participation in government food assistance programs leads to increases in the levels of nutrient intakes, ceteris paribus. Finally, so- ciodemographic factors most commonly em- ployed in the models are income, household size, ethnicity, and urbanization. In many in- stances, the effects of the respective sociode- mographic factors on nutrient levels are sta- tistically significant, ceteris paribus. However, the influence of the sociodemographic variÃ¢tes varies (both direction and magnitude) across samples and model specifications. Hedonic Price Models Hedonic price and/or characteristics models are very attractive in analyses pertaining to nutrition issues. The principal product from such models is the assessment of marginal monetary values of nutrients. The hedonic function is typically similar to the following: (2) P, = a, + 2 yuvu + Vi9 j where y y is the marginal implicit price of the jth nutrient and/or dietary component, rj^ is the amount of nutrient and/or dietary attribute j associated with a unit of product /, and PÂ¿ is the price of product i (Eastwood, Brooker, and Terry; Morgan; Morgan, Metzen, and John- son; Huffman). For each product consumed, the price paid by the consumer equals the sum of marginal monetary values of the character- istics of the product. The marginal monetary value of each characteristic equals the quantity of the characteristic obtained from the mar- ginal unit of the product consumed multiplied by the marginal implicit price of the charac- teristic. On the basis of the model, it is possible to determine how much the consumer is willing to pay say, for example, the removal of one gram of fat or how much to pay for the inclu- sion of one gram of protein. Morgan, Metzen, and Johnson use this model to determine a set of hedonic prices for the nutritional charac- teristics of breakfast cereals. Eastwood, Brook- er, and Terry; Ladd and Suvannunt; Huffman; and Capps employ the hedonic price function to determine a set of marginal monetary values for 7, 8, 13, and 14 nutrients, respectively. Hedonic prices for nutrient elements from the studies of Eastwood, Brooker, and Terry; Huffman; and Capps are exhibited in table 2. The selection of these studies rests on the fact that the 1977-78 NFCS is the common data base. Huffman; and Eastwood, Brooker, and Terry use the spring portion of the survey, while Capps uses all seasons from the survey. Little similarity exists, except for perhaps protein and iron, among the estimates of various nutrient characteristics. To illustrate, according to Huffman (Capps), the consumer is willing to pay 1 .9540 (.9680) for the removal of one gram of fat; yet according to Eastwood, Brooker, and Terry, the consumer is willing to pay .2480 for the inclusion of one gram of fat. For protein, according to the results of these three studies, the consumer is willing to pay roughly .44- .650 for the inclusion of one gram, and for iron, the consumer is willing to pay .290 for the removal of one milligram. The consideration of nutritional elements in demand analyses is not a straightforward issue. Usually, the representative consumer does not possess much information in regard to the nu- tritional content of foods. Moreover, nutri- tional factors are not necessarily independent of one another; for example, fat and calories are highly correlated. Also, although it may be desirable to increase iron but simultaneously decrease cholesterol in the diet, particular foods (notably red meat) are excellent sources of both iron and cholesterol. Nevertheless, the key assumption is that consumers care about the nutritional charac- teristics of food. To quote LaFrance, even if consumers do not compute or calculate at the margin the values of obtaining an additional microgram of vitamin B6, for example, they are undoubtedly aware of health and nutritional needs in general. Even if con-</page><page sequence="5">Capps and Schmitz Health and Nutrition Factors in Demand Analysis 25 Table 2.

(p. 3) Attitudes and Information About Health and Nutrition Use of attitudinal variables and information about health and nutrition in demand analysis is fragmentary. National consumer attitudinal research ap- pears to support the opinion that consumers prefer leaner beef (Yankelovich, Skelly, and White). Several studies have been conducted recently to examine consumer attitudes and preferences toward beef. Branson et al. ex- amine the effects of different degrees of lean- ness on consumer demand. Skaggs et al. and Menkhaus et al. analyze the potential of mar- keting branded, low fat, fresh beef. The results of these studies indicate that: (a) consumer health concerns are evident in regard to the ingestion of animal fats, (b) consumers are willing to compromise on taste for a product that is perceived to be more healthy, and (c) health related factors influence the decision to purchase leaner meats. A study prepared by Decision Center, Inc., for the American Meat Institute focuses on the awareness and usage of the lean brand of beef offered by Giant Foods, Inc., a chain located in the Baltimore- Washington area. This particular brand is pop- ular with female customers who are employed and under 40, who have children, and who are concerned about health and nutrition. Capps, Moen, and Branson focus attention on consumer willingness to try lean meat prod- ucts from a retail food chain in Houston. Via probit analysis, using survey data elicited by telephone, they provide empirical evidence that fat-conscious consumers (consumers with a predisposition toward buying low-fat foods), are more likely to try lean meat products than nonfat-conscious consumers, ceteris paribus. The role of nutrition and health information has been a focus in several studies of consumer food choices. For example, Stokes and Had- dock find that exposure to nutrition infor- mation and instruction on its use increases purchases of "nutritious" food. Schutz, Judge, and Gentry discuss the importance of nutri- tion, brand, and sensory attributes to pur- chases of several foods. Putler as well as Brown and Schrader in- vestigate the effect of cholesterol information on egg consumption. Putler models the effects of cholesterol information in a demand rela- tionship for eggs via a nonlinear time specifi- cation corresponding to a diffusion process. The reason for this diffusion process rests on the premise that health information is unlikely</page><page sequence="6">26 July 1991 Western Journal of Agricultural Economics to be received by all consumers instantane- ously. Instead, this information diffuses through the population over time. On the basis of this diffusion model, Putler augments the traditional set of Marshallian demand equa- tions via a nonlinear trend variable of the form, exp[Qg + a)T' - 1 exp[(Â£ + a)T' + B/a ' The variable Tis {(t - Â¿*) + (t + t*)}/2, where t is the current period and t* is the time at which cholesterol information begins to affect consumption. Using quarterly time-series data from 1960 to 1985, the hypothesis that health information has no effect on shell egg con- sumption is rejected. On the basis of the dif- fusion model, the beginning of the health in- formation effect on shell egg consumption is the second quarter of 1 969, and the full impact of the health information is achieved by the fourth quarter of 1980. Brown and Schrader construct a cholesterol information index to estimate the effect of cho- lesterol information on egg consumption. This index is based on a running total of the number of articles available to the medical profession. Each article supporting the linkage between cholesterol and heart disease adds one unit to the running total (lagged two quarters) and each article refuting the linkage subtracts one unit. Brown and Schrader, using quarterly time-se- ries data from 1955 I to 1987 II, augment the typical Marshallian demand relationship for eggs via the inclusion of the cholesterol infor- mation index. Adjustments are also made for seasonality as well as the percentage of women in the labor force. Results from this study in- dicate that, ceteris paribus, information on the links between cholesterol and heart disease de- crease per capita shell egg consumption. Chang and Kinnucan expand the Brown and Schrader index to include those articles avail- able not only in the United States but also in Canada. Using a variation of the AIDS model to capture demand interrelationships for but- ter, margarine, shortening oils, and salad oils in Canada, they conclude that over the period 1973 II to 1986 III cholesterol information negatively impacted butter consumption but positively impacted salad oil consumption, ceteris paribus. In sum, current knowledge pertaining to nu- trition and health determinants of food de- mand centers on the assessment of dietary quality, the estimation of nutrient demand re- lationships, the estimation of hedonic price models, and the use of attitudinal variables and information about nutrition and health in demand relationships. Theoretical Framework The purpose of this section is to describe a theoretical framework to measure the impact of health and nutrition information on the de- mand for food products. To motivate this the- oretical development, consider the issue of structural changes in domestic demand. To quote Purcell changes in prices of competing meats such as pork and poultry cannot explain the dramatic drop in inflation- adjusted beef prices since 1979 ... it is difficult to ac- cept that there has been no structural change in beef demand or that any shifts in beef demand can be ex- plained by changes in prices of other products, (pp. 18- 19) A plethora of studies by agricultural econo- mists exists with regard to structural change in the demand for meat products (see for exam- ple, Chalfant and Alston; Haidacher et al.; Nyankori and Miller; Braschler; Chavas; Mar- tin and Porter; Choi and Sosin; Moschini and Meilke; Dahlgran; Eales and Unnevehr; Good- win). The various studies typically employ econometric procedures such as switching re- gression models; time-varying parameter models; Farley-Hinich and Harvey-Collier tests; Chow tests; CUSUM and CUSUMQ tests, which rely on recursive estimates and recursive residuals; and nonparametric ap- proaches (compliance or noncompliance to weak and strong axioms of revealed prefer- ence) to ascertain the existence or nonexistence of structural change. Although the evidence is far from unanimous, structural change appears to exist in the demand for meat products. The nonconsensus of empirical results is attribut- able to alternative approaches in model de- velopment as well as to differences in data and econometric and inferential procedures. Fur- ther, information about saturated fats and cho- lesterol in the diet appears to be the major explanation for structural change, albeit other reasons include unprecedented economic shocks in the 1970s, increases in participation in the labor force by women, and changes in income distribution, age distribution, and ra- cial composition.</page><page sequence="7">Capps and Schmitz Health and Nutrition Factors in Demand Analysis 27 Assessing structural change in demand re- lationships is indeed very difficult. Evidence of structural change is a direct consequence of changes in the underlying utility function, a construct not directly observable. Since the utility function is not observable, structural change is usually analyzed through the use of Marshallian demand functions. Analyses of structural change subsequently rest on depar- tures from constancy of parameters of the cor- responding demand functions. However, de- mand parameters may vary not only because of structural change but also due to model mis- specification. The bottom-line implication from this discussion is the following- it is nec- essary to formally investigate the sources of structural change. Consequently, the ideal ap- proach is the identification and use of variables that may explain shifts in the utility function. To illustrate, Unnevehr employs a measure of change in income distribution in demand model specifications for meat products. In this light, the theoretical framework in this article, to formally consider health and nutrition information, is similar to the work of Basmann in conjunction with consumer de- mand with variable preferences. The utility function can be expressed as (4) Ut = Ufa 6(rt)), where 0(rt) reflects consumer preferences for the commodity vector, qt. The vector, rt rep- resents exogenous state variables, similar to those in the Houthakker-Taylor state adjust- ment model. The state variables correspond to stock of knowledge, psychological stock of habits, or physical stock of goods. With this framework, by assumption, the formulation of consumer preferences rests in part on infor- mation about the characteristics of qt. In the case of health and nutrition, the vector rt may consist of scientific information per- taining to cholesterol, sodium, dietary fiber, or saturated fats. The key assumption is that changes in scientific information about health and nutrition factors (r) in time t lead to changes in the commodity vector, qt, which in turn gives rise to changes in the parameters of the utility function. The parameters of utility func- tions are dependent on particular variables to account for changes in tastes and preferences. Subsequently, maximization of Ut = Ufa d(rt)) with respect to qt, given rt9 under classical con- ditions, yields Marshallian demand functions of the form (5) qt = qt(y, p' d(rt)). Consumer demand relationships depend not only on prices and income but also state vari- ables. This framework is not inconsistent with the concept of the information-augmented quantity vector of market goods put forward by Choi and Sosin. Importantly, this frame- work may also apply to the assessment of in- formation in regard to either food safety (Smith, van Ravenswaay, and Thompson; Swartz and Strand) or advertising (Chang). In particular, in consideration of issues of food safety, the perception of the quality, 0(rt), of a good by the consumer, by assumption, affects the util- ity function. This perception of product qual- ity depends on information, r, available to con- sumers. Demand may decline (rise) in direct fashion with the extent of "negative" ("posi- tive") media coverage, because such coverage leads to adjustments in consumer perceptions of product quality. Chavas suggests that the issue of cholesterol and fat in meat demand be considered as a problem of product quality. In accord with household production theory, the exogenous release of information regarding saturated fat intake and heart disease may alter beliefs by consumers about the ability of red meats to provide the fundamental good "good health." While theoretically attractive, typically data limitations prevent the implementation of this approach. For example, although health and nutrition concerns are prime candidates as sources of structural change, generally data are lacking to permit tests of such hypotheses. Be- cause of data limitations, previous empirical studies capture the impacts of health and nu- trition information on demand relationships via the use of trend variables (Putler; Brown; Hamilton; Schuker; and Shulstad and Stoeve- ner). However, according to Kmenta (p. 568), "The term 'trend' is always a camouflage for factors that change over time, and it would certainly be preferable if these factors could be identified and measured." Further, according to Basmann, In econometric demand analysis, the introduction of time as an independent trend variable to "explain" the effects of changes in taste is at best an expedient it would be better to avoid, if possible, since trend parameters are not capable of causal or legal interpretation, (p. 48) As well, to quote Chalfant and Alston, Whether a parametric or nonparametric approach is used, there is often a lack of data about the nature of</page><page sequence="8">28 July 1991 Western Journal of Agricultural Economics the structural change, and the alternative hypothesis is usually no more specific than that the null hypothesis is incorrect. It would be preferable to incorporate di- rectly the determinants and the nature of the hypothe- sized structural change in a more specific alternative hypothesis. For example, proxies for increased health consciousness could be included. However, problems arise because of the number of possible influences, the lack of adequate data, and the uncertainty about the manner in which they might affect demands, (p. 397) Nevertheless, Stigler and Becker appeal to economists to augment their models to ac- count for changes in demand relationships. Perhaps the best example of this approach, at least with regard to health and nutrition in- formation, is the work of Brown and Schrader. Empirical Application Brown and Schrader suggest the use of the cho- lesterol information index variable in demand equations for red meat and poultry. In partic- ular, to account for demand interrelationships among meat products, the next section rests on a systems analysis, the use of a Rotterdam model, to investigate simultaneously the im- pacts of prices, total expenditure, and choles- terol information on the consumption of beef, pork, poultry, and fish. The representation of the traditional Rot- terdam model, the starting point for this anal- ysis, is as follows: w*Dqlt = a, + b' Dyt - 2 wfflPk, (6) L k J + 2 CijDPji + eÂ«&gt; j i,j, fc = 1, ...,Â«, where (7) Dqit = 'n[qit/qit-il Dpjt = 'n'pjt/pjt_x], Dyt = ln[y/tt_J, and W* = l/2(Wit + Wft_!). The Rotterdam model is a directly specified demand system. Chang and Kinnucan employ a variation of the AIDS model in consideration of the impact of cholesterol information on the consumption of fats and oils in Canada. The term wft corresponds to a two-period moving average of the average budget share of the rth good in period t and DqÃ¤9 Dpjt, and Dyt correspond to the natural logarithm of the ratio of qit to qu_l9 pjt to pjt_l9 and yt to yt_u respec- tively. In short, D represents the log difference operator. The parameter bÂ¡ corresponds to the marginal budget share of the ith good and the parameter ctj corresponds to the compensated cross-price elasticity of good / with respect to the price of goody weighted by the budget share for the /th commodity. To insure symmetry and homogeneity, clas- sical restrictions from utility maximization, as well as adding up, it is necessary to employ the following constraints: (8) Symmetry cij = cjh Homogeneity 2^ = 0 V,, and j &gt; Adding up Formally to consider health and nutrition information (specifically in this instance cho- lesterol information), it is necessary to modify the Rotterdam model as follows: (9) wfDq^yMCHOL^) + bÂ¡Dyt- ^w*Dpkt' + 2 cvDpÃŸ + â‚¬,. j CHOLt_i corresponds to the cholesterol index developed by Brown and Schrader. The sym- metry and homogeneity conditions are the same as in the traditional specification, but it is necessary to add a constraint to the adding- up conditions, namely 2 7/ = 0. The inter- cept term a, in equation (6) corresponds to a time trend. In equation (9), the time trend is replaced by the natural logarithm of the cho- lesterol index.

The data pertinent to this analysis are available from the authors upon request. Data on cholesterol information are available from Brown and Schrader. This information is available on a quarterly basis, but to be con- sistent with annual price and quantity data, the cholesterol variable is put on an annual basis. To estimate the parameters of this demand system, this study employs the iterative Zell- ner estimation (IZEF) procedure. The IZEF procedure assures the large-sample properties of consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimated coefficients so that conventional tests of significance are applicable. The level of sig- nificance chosen is .10. The equations are assumed to have additive disturbance terms. Because of the adding-up constraint, only three of the equations are in- dependent. Under this condition, the usual es- timation procedure, followed in this study, has been to drop one of the equations, estimate the remaining system, and calculate the pa- rameters in the omitted equation using the classical restrictions (Barten). The IZEF pro- cedure produces parameter estimates invari- ant to the choice of the deleted equations as long as the disturbance terms possess the clas- sical properties. The omitted equation in this study corresponds to fish consumption. The structural parameter estimates and as- sociated Â¿-statistics of the modified Rotterdam model are exhibited in table 3. The goodness- of-fit statistics range from .298 to .726. No evidence of serial correlation is evident in any of the equations. In the beef and pork equations, the coeffi- cients associated with the cholesterol infor- mation index variable are negative. Yet only in the pork equation is this coefficient statis- tically different from zero. In the remaining equations, the corresponding coefficients as- sociated with the cholesterol index are not only positive for poultry and fish, ceteris paribus, but also they are statistically different from zero. Consequently, there exists sample evi- dence to indicate that cholesterol information, with a half-year lag, is a statistically significant determinant in the consumption of pork, poul- try, and fish. Key determinants of meat consumption are unequivocally own prices. Cross-price effects are important for beef and pork as well as for beef and poultry. Total meat expenditure is a statistically significant factor in the demand relationships for beef, pork, and fish but not in the demand relationships for poultry. Compensated own-price and cross-price elasticities as well as expenditure elasticities from the Rotterdam model are exhibited in table 4. All compensated own-price elasticities are negative, in agreement with theory. The compensated cross-price elasticities are posi- tive, indicating that the various meat products are substitutes except for the cross-price elas- ticities of poultry with respect to fish and vice versa. The beauty of the empirical application lies in the ability to test directly the hypothesis that health and nutrition information affects con- sumption patterns of meat products. Indeed, it is important to consider alternative demand</page><page sequence="10">30 July 1991 Western Journal of Agricultural Economics Table 4.

However, the results from this exercise suggest that at least the issue of the importance of health and nutrition in- formation on the demand for food products is open to further study. Issues Data Needs First, to employ the theoretical framework previously discussed, it is necessary to obtain data on health and nutrition information available to consumers and/or attitudes of consumers toward health and nutrition. In general, at present, such information is lacking. Although a cholesterol information index is currently available over time, additional in- formation indices are needed pertaining to other nutrients, for example, dietary fiber, so- dium, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, and polyunsaturated fat. With such indices, it may be possible to identify and assess more gen- erally the role of health and nutrition infor- mation on the demand for specific food prod- ucts. It is meritorious to consider attitudinal vari- ables in demand analyses in addition to the traditional economic factors. This information is best garnered from individual consumers, not from aggregate time-series data. Along this line, Menkhaus, St. Clair, and Hallingbye pro- vide empirical evidence to suggest that atti- tudes toward health-related factors including high fat content, high cholesterol, and high cal- ories are key factors in the decision by con- sumers who purchase less roasts, steaks, and ground beef than previously. To paraphrase Buse, those agencies and or- ganizations designing and implementing ex- penditure surveys (e.g., USDA, BLS) must be encouraged to expand the scope of those sur- veys since to agricultural economists, they are perhaps the primary sources of data to conduct demand analyses. In fact, there exists move- ment in this direction. Beginning in 1989, the Continuing Surveys of Food Intake by Indi- viduals (CSFII) includes a follow-up telephone survey to ask respondents about their diet and health knowledge. This situation represents the first time that a nationwide sample will be used to study the relationship between individuals' actual dietary intakes and their attitudes and knowledge about dietary behavior. In the attempt to assess structural change in the demand for food, primarily meat products, empirical studies rely on the use of aggregated time-series data. Such data, however, are not typically amenable to revealing shifts in tastes and preferences due to health concerns. With aggregate time-series data, the characteristics of the definitional unit of consumption may not be the same over time. Of course, this problem may occur in cross-sectional studies as well, depending on the level of aggregation for the commodity. To illustrate, according to Baumer (p. 2), "A pound of pork consumed in 1986 is counted as the same as a pound of pork consumed in 1966. Today's hog is 50 percent leaner than the hog 25 years ago." As well, nutrient elements such as cholesterol, fat, salt, and food energy vary widely within and among aggregate product categories. At a min- imum, improvements in disaggregated time- series information pertaining to the consump- tion of various products (e.g., sirloin, ham- burger, roasts; ham, pork chops, bacon; spe- cific types of finfish and shellfish; turkey; chicken) is needed. Research Challenges Research is needed to identify and assess non- economic variables (e.g., attitudinal variables) that may be important in explaining variations in the consumption of food products. In this</page><page sequence="11">Capps and Schmitz Health and Nutrition Factors in Demand Analysis 3 1 light, it may be beneficial to agricultural econ- omists to work jointly with psychologists, so- ciologists, nutritionists, and home economists in the consideration of such noneconomic variables. Consumers receive information about nu- trition and health from several sources: (a) doctors, nurses, other health professionals; nu- tritionists, dietitians, or home economists (people source); (b) radio, television, news- papers, magazines, books, government health organization publications, food company pub- lications (media source); and (c) food packages or labels (package source). Research to assess the impacts of the source of nutrition and health information on food consumption, ceteris pa- ribus, merits attention. This factor constitutes in essence a measure of the role of influencers on food consumption behavior. With the ex- ception of the work by Ippolito and Mathios, studies to assess the impacts of sources of nu- trition information on food expenditure or consumption patterns are lacking. In conjunction with the issue of the role of influencers on food consumption behavior, new labeling proposals are under consideration by the federal government (Bacon). Few policy changes have been initiated since 1975 when nutritional labeling was originally implement- ed. Agricultural economists can play a pivotal role in addressing this issue. For instance, it is possible to update the work of Lenahan et al.: (a) to discover the labeling formation most acceptable to the consumer for presenting nu- trition information; (b) to discover the outlet most used by the consumer for receiving nu- trition information; (c) to identify the rate of perception, understanding, and use of nutri- tion information on labels; and (d) to deter- mine the nature and importance of nonuse benefits (Padberg) of nutrition information as perceived by consumers. The forthcoming 1987-88 NFCS contains information on 28 nutritional elements. Hence, with this survey, it will be possible to update studies in the assessment of dietary quality, the determination of demand for specific nu- trients, and the construction of hedonic prices for nutrients. Of course, such efforts will re- quire the use of interdisciplinary teams com- posed of nutritionists and agricultural econo- mists. Furthermore, unlike previous USDA Nationwide Food Consumption Surveys, the 1987-88 NFCS contains information on sat- urated fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsatu- rated fat, cholesterol, dietary fiber, vitamin A, carotenes, vitamin E, folacin, zinc, copper, so- dium, and potassium. Therefore, the 1987-88 NFCS constitutes not only a rich source of nutrition information but also for particular nutrients a new set of information. Additionally, with the 1987-88 NFCS, it is possible to determine whether or not individ- uals or households meet any of the seven di- etary guidelines set forth by the USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) [(a) eat a variety of foods; (b) main- tain desirable weight; (c) avoid too much fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol; (d) eat foods with adequate starch and fiber; (e) avoid too much sugar; (f) avoid too much sodium; and (g) if you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation]. Attainment of a single guideline or multiple guidelines may also constitute al- ternative measures of diet quality. Conse- quently, it is possible to identify food use pat- terns conditional on the attainment or nonattainment of dietary guidelines, all other factors invariant. As well, issues in regard to the demographics of nutrition may be worthy of attention. For example, which population groups achieve nutritional or dietary guide- lines? Also, are consumers who purchase con- venience or formulated foods more or less like- ly to achieve the dietary guidelines? With the myriad of formulated foods in the market- place, this latter question is unequivocally of interest. In fact, a paucity of economic and nutritional information exists pertaining to formulated foods. In the spirit of the works by Havlicek et al.; Capps, Tedford, and Havlicek; and Capps and Pearson, attempts to add to this sparse store of knowledge are worthy of consideration. Research in this area will assist food pro- duction and marketing specialists, agricultural and consumer economists, food program ad- ministrators, food and nutrition educators, health professionals, and nutrition and eco- nomic researchers to better understand the na- ture of and reasons for household food selec- tions. Ultimately, improvements can be made in the design and focus of education and as- sistance programs that have food, nutrition, and food money management components. Joint efforts of agricultural economists with nutritionists and public health officials are of importance to the National Nutrition Moni- toring System (NNMS). The NNMS covers federal nutrition monitoring activities, both</page><page sequence="12">32 July 1991 Western Journal of Agricultural Economics in the USDA and the DHHS. Of interest to agricultural economists, the national monitor- ing of dietary status requires information on the nutrient content of food as well as food consumption. The sources for such informa- tion are the decennial food consumption sur- veys (1977-78 and 1987-88 NFCS) as well as the CSFII initiated in 1985. The CSFII pro- vides information about dietary behavior be- tween the decennial surveys. Opportunities ex- ist for agricultural economists to use food and nutrient consumption information available from the NNMS to conduct analyses of food consumption and to target and develop food assistance and nutrition education programs. Methodological Considerations The incorporation of health and nutrition in- formation into demand systems merits con- sideration. By using the method of translation (Pollak and Wales), parameters of either the cost or the demand functions may, by as- sumption, depend upon previous levels of health and nutrition information. This pro- cedure is very similar to the work of Green in incorporating advertising effects into demand systems. Also, scientific information about health and nutrition may be characterized by either geo- metric or polynomial distributed lag relation- ships. Polynomial distributed lag relationships may be incorporated in demand system mod- els or single-equation models to formally de- termine the level of the effect of the infor- mation on the demand for the goods, when the information first begins to influence demand, the length of time before the information reaches the full effect on demand, and the time path of the effect of the information. Finally, price and income elasticities may vary due to the available scientific information in conjunction with cholesterol. Via the use of single-equation models with random coeffi- cients, it may be possible to determine if such information leads to changes in price and in- come elasticities. Concluding Remarks This article promotes the consideration of health and nutrition factors in analyses of food demand. Given the widespread attention on health and nutrition issues from the news me- dia, food product labels, and from medical per- sonnel, it is important for agricultural econo- mists to identify and assess the effects of attitudes and information on the demand for food products. As well, agricultural econo- mists, in a multidisciplinary fashion, play a role in the assessment of dietary quality, the determination of demand for specific nutri- ents, and the construction of hedonic price functions for nutrients. Research outcomes in these areas will lead to the development of appropriate food production distribution pol- icies as well as to the development of more appropriate marketing practices (e.g., enforce- ment of food grades and standards as well as updating of food labeling requirements). Effectiveness of public policies directed to- ward consumers, farmers, and various inter- mediaries in the food and fiber sector will in- crease with improvements in the understanding of the structural elements of food consumption and nutrient intakes. Estimates of food de- mand parameters are necessary in order to as- sess the impacts of alternative food, nutrition, and agricultural policies. The capability to ad- equately ascertain historical, current, and fu- ture patterns of food consumption is of ex- treme importance to both public and private actors in the food system. Health and nutrition issues are not about to fade away. Almost every new product makes some sort of health or nutritional claim. Re- cent changes in domestic food use have given rise to questions by those involved in food production, processing, and marketing. For example, are concerns about nutrition and health behind the decline in dairy consump- tion and beef consumption and behind the rise of poultry and seafood consumption? Designing foods to make them attractive to consumers is essentially a technological de- velopment. To be fully successful, this devel- opment must be guided by information that indicates how the resulting products will fare in the marketplace. Consequently, it is im- portant to understand the role of economic and noneconomic demand factors. To not consider health and nutrition factors directly in demand analysis, or at least to account for them in some fashion, is not only myopic but also, in the words of Purcell, a failure by the discipline.
