<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews 979 The geographical angle of the collection is pursued with advantage within France too: Daniel Ligou uncovers some new sources to explore 'Les origines de la maconnerie bourguignonne'; Patrick Guyon examines the career of 'Antonin Esmonin de Dampierre, magistrat et franc-macon dijonnais (I744-I824)', Jacques Feneant traces 'L'art royal dans le Val-de-Loire', and, in one of the most outstand- ing contributions,Johel Coutura analyses 'Le Musee de Bordeaux'. The artistic side of Masonry which comes out in several contributions is more closely analysed in Philippe Autexier, 'La musique maconnique', and by Jacques Brengues, 'La guerre des sexes et l'amour macon dans la poesie', while the female side of Masonry which is evident in the latter article is also explored by Colette Bertrand, 'Comment la maconnerie vint aux femmes', and F.

UNIVERSITY OF EXETER COLIN JONES The Complete Works of Voltaire/aEuvres completes de Voltaire. Edited by WILLIAM BARBER, ULLA KOLVING, and others. Volume 33: (Euvres alphabetiques. Edited by JEROOM VERCRUYSSE and others; Volume 62: I766-I767. Edited by JACQUELINE MARCHAND, ROLAND MORTIER, andJOHN RENWICK. Oxford: The Voltaire Foundation. I987. 343pp.; 5I8pp. ?40.00; ?60.oo. The two volumes reviewed here are part of a huge enterprise, familiar no doubt already to most readers. For this is the first ever critical edition of the vast corpus represented by Voltaire's printed works and correspondence: indeed, it is the first attempt at a complete edition of any type for over Ioo years. For these reasons its fundamental importance for the study of French literature and thought is plain, all the more so since Louis Moland's I877-85 edition was in many ways unsatisfactory, not least in that it often arbitrarily lumped together parts of Voltaire's writings which had no original connexion. A major merit of the present edition is that a chronological presentation is followed as far as possible, thus allowing readers to appreciate to the full extent the range of Voltairean productions in a particular year and greatly helping scholars trying to show the development of Voltaire's ideas and</page><page sequence="2">Reviews the cross-fertilization of one genre with another, often previously unsuspected or missed. There have of course been problems. It was in I953 that Theodore Besterman began what has been called the modern Voltaire 'industry' when he published the first volume of his masterly edition of the correspondence. In 1968 he agreed to finance a new edition of Voltaire's works, into which was to be integrated the second, definitive edition of the correspondence, rendered necessary by the amount of material that had come to light because of the interest created by the original one. And, indeed, the correspondence forms Volumes 85 to I35 of the Complete Works. So far, so good. But of necessity the work of the vast team of editors commissioned to prepare the first eighty or so volumes could not have the consistency of approach shown in the correspondence, largely the work of one man. The second major problem has been one of time. Some volumes began appearing as early as the late I96os, but many editors had not even begun their work then or had not even been appointed, so that as I write in 1988 the vast majority of volumes have still to appear. Given these difficulties, the general editor William Barber and his collaborators have done an excellent job: one must particularly mention the Assistant General Editor, Ulla Kolving, whose positive influence is everywhere present, and the members of the executive committee, especially Andrew Brown. For the standard of presentation, the correctness of the text, indeed all the 'technical' side of the edition is of a uniformly high standard, as can be seen from Volumes 33 and 62. It is when one comes to consider the work of individual editors, particularly in their introduc- tions to particular pieces, that there is not always reason for such enthusiasm, and it is this question I shall turn to now. Volume 33 begins the series of volumes devoted to (Euvres alphabetiques. It contains the forty-five articles Voltaire contributed to the Encyclopedie and the I 17 articles he wrote for the letter 'T' of the 1762 edition of the Dictionnaire de l'Academie. Given the fact that the Encyclopedie is generally recognized to be one of the most important achievements of the French Enlightenment, one would expect Voltaire's part in it to be fully explained, in the tradition of Naves and other distinguished scholars. But Section I of the introduction, by Virgil Topazio, is disappointing. In the first place, it contains several unclear or questionable assertions. For example, speaking about d'Alembert's visit to Geneva, Topazio states that 'la tradition rapporte que ce fut a cette occasion que Voltaire aurait inspire l'article "Geneve" qui souleva une tempete' (p. 3), without ever making clear whether or not he accepts this tradition. A little later, discussing the frequently-made assertion that Voltaire was excluded from a greater participation in the Encyclopedie by its editors on the grounds that he was not considered qualified, Topazio comments: 'Les faits semblent refuter une telle assertion' (p. 5). Yet he makes no attempt to tell the reader what these facts are, merely referring him in a footnote to an article by M. Retzler. If the aim of this edition is to inform the reader of the current state of Voltairean scholarship, I can see no reason why the editor cannot summarize Retzler's conclusions in a few sentences. The eager scholar will still be able to peruse Retzler's article at length, but others will be spared the tedious and quite unnecessary task of seeking it out to discover what the editor could easily have told them. A little later Topazio states: 'L'histoire du developpement progressif et manifestement ineluctable de Voltaire a l'Encyclopedie s'est eclaircie avec les annees' (p. 8; my italics). The phrase 'manifestement ineluctable' is in any case odd from the pen of an editor, since it would seem to render his function somewhat unnecessary: it is doubly surprising in view of the fact that for years, as I mentioned earlier, many critics thought that Voltaire's participation was quite the opposite. Most disappointing of all is the absence of any attempt to assess the content and value of Voltaire's articles for the Encyclopedie and their importance in relation to the rest of the work: this attempt should surely have been made. 980</page><page sequence="3">I say this because for the first time one is able to read all the articles Voltaire contributed to the Encyclopedie. Not all are significant: some, indeed, such as 'Facile', 'Faction', 'Gracieux', and 'Habilete', are short and quite disappointing for the avid Voltairean expecting new revelations of genius. But even here it would have been interesting to have an assessment of Voltaire's technique as an encyclopedist. For the technique seems conspicious by its absence: what is disappointing is precisely the lack of a logical plan. What might appear spontaneous in Voltaire's Dictionnaire philosophique, a virtue precisely because the Dictionnaire is a highly selective work of propaganda, seems merely haphazard in the present context. A particularly striking example is the article 'Franchise', where no proper definition of the word is given and where the last paragraph appears more appropriate at the beginning than at the end. In many articles, however, one comes across vintage Voltaire: 'Hemistiche' gives a classic formulation of his views on versification - its constraints are 'des chaines qui rendent l'art d'autant plus precieux qu'il est plus difficile'; 'Gloire' reflects his scorn at anthropomorphic views of God: 'Ce n'est pas que l'Etre supreme puisse avoir de la gloire; mais les hommes n'ayant point d'expressions qui lui conviennent, emploient pour lui celles dont ils sont les plus flattes'; in 'Heureux' there is the admirably concise and balanced aphorism: 'Pretendre etre toujours heureux, est la pierre philosophale de l'ame.' None of these passages is commented on, though cross-references to Voltaire's other works would have been instructive, particularly for the article on poetry. I concede that there are many excellent notes, but on the whole they are limited in scope to the identification of precise references and there is no real attempt to assess the content of Voltaire's articles. Such a task might not be appropriate in footnotes, but should it not therefore have been undertaken in the introduction to this work? This omission is particularly striking when one considers two important articles, 'Histoire' and 'Idole', which are both brimful of interesting and controversial ideas, many certainly deserving commentary and explanation. 'Idole', already well known, is very revealing as regards Voltaire's characteristic views on the superiority of paganism over Christianity. In fact, claims Voltaire, the pagans were no more idolators than the Christians are, and there were no wars of religion among them because they were wise enough to separate enlightened and plebeian beliefs: 'II y avait la theologie sacree, et l'erreur populaire; le culte secret, et les ceremonies publiques; la religion des sages, et celle du vulgaire' (p. 201). Not perhaps very surprising in a thinker of the Enlightenment, but a reference to similar thoughts in Gibbon would certainly not be out of place. There should surely be some reaction to Voltaire's interesting attempt to explain how the gods of paganism arose and to the irony of his ostensible compliment to Catholic saints (p. I 9). Should there not be a French translation of the frequent Latin quotations in this article? And when Voltaire states categorically 'Les premieres offrandes [to the gods] furent des fruits', either his source, if there is one, should be identified or the editor should make clear that Voltaire's statement has no apparent justification other than personal conjec- ture. Above all, one would like some assessment of the importance of this article, its relevance to his other statements on religion, and some indication as to its connexion with the ideas of his contemporaries. Yet again, 'Histoire', the longest (twenty-two pages) and arguably the most important article in the entire volume, cries out for similar treatment. Once more the reader has questions both over points of detail and over the general status of the article. Is it Voltaire's most authoritative statement on the subject? Does it accord with what he says elsewhere? What does he say elsewhere? When, after expressing great scepticism, he does none the less describe three ways of finding out historical facts, is this an original statement? If not, what are Voltaire's sources? Are his views on the utility of history a commonplace contemporary view? Similarly, had anyone else put forward the idea (very like one advanced by the late Reviews 98i</page><page sequence="4">Kenneth Clark) that there seems a necessary link between warfare and the development of the arts? And even if these questions are too ambitious for the article's editor (though I fail to see why they should be), ought there not to be an explanation of the glaring discrepancy on page 165, where note 3, referring to Voltaire's statement that the Phoenicians claimed to have lived in their country for 30,000 years, merely states that the priests of Tyre told Herodotus that the town had been founded 2,300 years earlier? Did Voltaire invent his figure? If not, what was his source? The note gives no information'on this, indeed it makes no comment on the extraordinary contradiction it is pointing to. Surely some reaction from the editor is required. When one turns to the edition of Voltaire's articles for the Dictionnaire de l'Academie, it is to find the same cocktail of impressive erudition and annoying omissions. The introduction (by Jeroom Vercruysse) is again disappointing. At whom, one wonders, is it aimed? Certainly at those with more encyclopedic knowledge than I possess, for why say that the first edition of the Dictionnaire de l'Academie 'suscita immediatement une polemique passionnee dans laquelle Furetiere se distingua avec eclat' if you do not explain why the latter triumphed? Why is this not explained by the editor? One sentence would be sufficient. Surely such an introduction should not have us reaching for our reference books. I fail to see in any case how the reference to Furetiere is relevant to the subject in hand. What would be relevant and is unfortunately not explained is the use Voltaire made of the Dictionnaire de Trevoux. This is alluded to en passant at the end of the introduction (p. 238), but to say merely that Voltaire had used it in his work 'largement' is hardly informative. Admittedly, there are frequent references in the footnotes to specific articles which make this a little clearer, but there is no general assessment of his debt, and this is an important omission. Also helpful would be a little information about the fourth edition of the Dictionnaire de l'Academie, for which Voltaire's articles were written. Vercruysse refers the reader to one of his own articles, but a brief summary of this should be given, since not every reader will automatically have to hand Volume 37 of the Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century, and in this case the point is germane to the discussion. To make this criticism brings me to what I find to be the main problem of this edition, which can also be illustrated in connexion with Volume 62. Are the editors aiming purely at advanced Voltairean scholars who are using the edition solely for purposes of research? Such people should perhaps claim some sort of priority, particularly as regards the scrupulous nature of the establishment of the text and of associated problems. However, the general directives to editors issued inJune 1987, while perfectly naturally warning them to restrict themselves in their notes to information 'not likely to be familiar to well-educated readers', also make provision as regards introductions to particular works for the following areas (as well as the specifically textual questions I have already mentioned): 'circumstances of the circulation and publication of the text, public reaction and the subsequent history of the text' (this is normally dealt with well or at least adequately by the editors in the two volumes under review here) and 'sources, background, general orientation in so far as such matters are strictly relevant to the specific text being presented and are not common knowledge'. This is precisely the sort of information, so expertly and informatively provided in earlier volumes such as La Pucelle, La Henriade, and La Philosophie de l'histoire, which is generally missing in Volumes 33 and 62. For should the edition not also be aiming at the person I can only describe as the general academic reader, the sort of person tolerably well versed in French literature, who wishes to read more Voltaire and find all the necessary information required for understanding a particularly work or text? Is this not the very nature of a critical edition? Here we see the inevitable problem caused by the size of this enterprise and 982 Reviews</page><page sequence="5">Reviews 983 the sheer number of editors. Several appear to have completely ignored the more general interest which their work ought surely be seeking to evoke and satisfy. Volume 62 contains five works written by Voltaire in the period 1766-67; Le Philosophe ignorant and L'Examen important de milord Bolingbroke (both edited by Roland Mortier), Andre Destouches a Siam (edited by John Renwick), and Les Questions de Zapata and Homelies prononcees a Londres (edited by Jacqueline Marchand). My first comment on rereading these works must be in the nature of a cliche: astonishment and admiration at the extraordinary range and virtuosity shown by the seventy- three-year-old Voltaire. Above all, I would have thought this volume should draw attention to his intellectual awareness and liveliness, at a time when some of his contemporary critics such as Grimm and Diderot were writing him off as in his dotage and claiming that he was merely repeating ideas expressed many times before. Repetition there is, to some extent at least, but it is accompanied by an almost uncanny skill in modulating his style so that the message, however familiar in some of its aspects, is always amusing, fresh, or challenging. We go from the personal odyssey ofLe Philosophe ignorant (a work which shows that Voltaire, if not an original philosopher, was at least a dedicated searcher for the truth) to the vitriolic anti-Christian satire of the Examen important; from an interest in reforming France's backward legal system (Andre Destouches a Siam) to more satire of Christianity (Les Questions de Zapata), but this time cast in a much more amusing vein; and finally to the Homelies, such a clear and unequivocal statement of the deist position that it is astonishing that anyone reading it could doubt Voltaire's sincerity. For those who know only Candide or Zadig this volume will come as a revelation. How far is the importance, range, and vitality of these works shown in the various introductions and notes? I must admit to being disappointed in most cases. Le Philosophe ignorant, for example, has a relatively short introduction. Here, as in Jacqueline Marchand's editions of Les Questions de Zapata and the Homelies prononcees a Londres, there is no attempt to assess the work's significance, or to relate its ideas to other similar passages in Voltaire's works (admittedly a demanding task, but one which would allow us to determine to what extent his ideas had developed and how far he was merely rehashing old material). This omission will surely be a major problem in the future for researchers wishing to work on particular aspects of Voltaire's thought or on the eighteenth century in general. The establishment of a comprehensive index when the edition is finally completed would be a way round this, but would represent a truly gigantic task and would still be less satisfactory, in my opinion, than an indication in notes to a particular text as to when the ideas found there appear in Voltaire's other works. But to return to Le Philosophe ignorant: although many notes are of a very high quality, I find Roland Mortier on occasion rather patronizing in his remarks. In note 87 (p. 60) he comments: 'Tout ce passage atteste une connaissance assez superficielle du spinozisme .... La critique de Voltaire est d'une extreme faiblesse, qui frise l'incomprehension.' Now Professor Mortier may well be right, but he should justify his opinion, however briefly, by explaining why Voltaire is mistaken. Even more important, in note 92 (p. 6i), Mortier dismisses Voltaire's comments on Providence and on Final Causes, quoting Grimm with approval (though without identifying the passage). But was the argument from Final Causes so silly anyway? It was after all accepted by the vast majority of Voltaire's contemporaries, pace Grimm, Diderot, and the group associated with d'Holbach. In any case, is such a criticism by Mortier not clearly anachronistic? There was as yet no accepted mechanism such as natural selection to enable the belief in a type of Providence to be dispensed with. This clear and frank discussion of the idea, despite Voltaire's reservations over the existence of Providence, deserves constructive commentary rather than such peremptory dismissal.</page><page sequence="6">984 Reviews To do Professor Mortier justice, I found his edition of L'Examen important de milord Bolingbroke much more impressive, although once again the introduction is rather short. The notes are, however, excellent: painstaking, accurate, and extremely informative. What I find particularly impressive is that Professor Mortier does provide here exactly the type of cross-references whose absence I have been lamenting as regards some of the other texts of this volume. Most notably, he establishes many helpful comparisons with Voltaire's definitive statement of Biblical criticism, La Bible enfin expliquee, a work with which he is clearly familiar. There are, of course, a few quibbles. I feel once more than Latin quotations should be translated into French for the convenience of most readers. Moreover, several of the points brought out in the notes are so important that they should certainly be emphasized more prominently: that is, in the introduction. Note 58 (p. 199) shows the accuracy of Voltaire's quotations from the Bible; note 8 (p. 301) indicates that Voltaire had read Fleury's Histoire ecclesiastique several times very attentively; most significant of all, discussing Voltaire's comments about one Abdias (a contem- porary of Christ), Mortier comments: 'L'extraordinaire erudition historique de Voltaire se verifie une fois de plus' (p. 259, n. 206). It is certainly worth emphasizing this point, already shown by Rene Pomeau regarding the Essai sur les meurs, for the impression that Voltaire was a lazy and superficial reader who often falsified his sources, although usually completely unjustified, may still persist in some quarters. My only real criticism of Professor Mortier is that he does not bring out the passion of this extraordinary anti-Christian diatribe, the cogency and implacable logic shown by Voltaire in exposing the folly of basing society's values and moral codes on a book so demonstrably full of inconsistency, barbarism, and sheer unadulterated nonsense. Many may find my comments here as anachronistic as those for which I earlier berated Professor Mortier, but is not one of Voltaire's overriding claims to be studied his importance as a source of the anticlericalism so important in nineteenth- century and even twentieth-century France? And in a yet-wider sense, was not one of the main contributions to the progress of the human mind made by the Enlighten- ment in general and Voltaire in particular the fact that since such writings as the Examen important, most thinking people have no longer been able to take seriously the teachings of a religion whose sacred writings recount the exploits of Balaam's ass, Jonah's whale, and details of so many horrific or incongruous incidents, which would scandalize the faithful if they appeared in any other book? To be even more anachronistic, for in a critical edition of Voltaire's works one is surely justified in looking for a sympathetic judgement of his views and an assessment of their continuing importance, can we be completely sure that these comments have no significance for the reader of today? Professor Mortier presumably considers that the battles fought by Voltaire are long since won, but perhaps he should emphasize the positive side of Voltaire's thought, since, after all, there are still many bastions of obscurantism and still those who appeal to the Book of Leviticus for moral standards (though it is usually obvious that, unlike Voltaire, they have never read most of it). All this may seem very far from the detached, serene world of a critical edition, but that is precisely my point. I find it a little sad that some sense of the intellectual turmoil of the late I76os does not come through in the editorial comments to Volume 62: Voltaire's absolute determination after events such as the La Barre case to break the Church's power by demolishing the intellectual authority of its foundations, the Old and New Testaments; his equal fear of atheism and desire to establish some sort of more rational belief, shorn of ridiculous superstitions, hence the Homilies prononcees a Londres, which despite continuing the attack against the Bible, also blast atheism and are presented by a 'rational' minister of religion (an alternative title was 'prechees a Londres').</page><page sequence="7">When one comes to consider the Homilies and Les Questions de Zapata, there is a real dilemma, for in the avant-propos to Volume 62, William Barber informs us of the 'deces survenu en decembre 1985 de notre estimee collegue Jacqueline Marchand', editor of the two texts in question. De mortuis nil nisi bonum, but unfortunately I am in the position of having to disobey this venerable adage. Mile Marchand's work is quite simply not of the standard expected of such an edition. Her introductions are quite inadequate (four pages for Les Questions de Zapata and three and a half for the Homelies), in no way dealing with the general problems I have been raising, and the quality of many notes is unfortunately not much better. When Voltaire is discussing the problem of reconciling the existence of God with the suffering of His creatures (p. 435), a question which any serious reader of his works knows preoccupied him throughout his life, Mile Marchand inexplicably refers the reader to two works by La Hontan, with no other comment. Did she think it was reading these books that had caused Voltaire's malaise? If not, what is the purpose of the note? (Apparently none.) Later, she chooses to comment on the following passage of the Troisieme Homelie: 'Puissent tous les theologiens de la terre vivre ensemble comme les commerqants, qui, sans examiner dans quel pays ils sont nes, dans quelles pratiques ils ont ete nourris, suivent entre eux les regles inviolables de l'equite, de la fidelite, de la confiance reciproque: Ils sont par ces principes les liens de toutes les nations' (p. 473). Could there be a clearer echo of a famous passage in the sixth Lettre philosophique: 'Entrez dans la Bourse de Londres ...'? Yet Mile Marchand gives no indication of this, drawing attention instead to a passage in Sedaine's Le Philosophe sans le savoir. I find this quite extraordinary, since in all likelihood it was Sedaine who had been influenced by passages in Voltaire, rather than vice versa. I could give other examples of bizarre, unnecessary, or irrelevant notes. Perhaps it would have been kinder to have kept Mile Marchand's textual work and asked someone else to provide introductions and notes to the two texts instead. There are no such problems with John Renwick's edition of Andre Destouches a Siam. This is a short but not unimportant work, and Professor Renwick has provided an informative and thought-provoking introduction, where he investi- gates Voltaire's apparent delay in assimilating the ideas of Beccaria. The textual notes are of a comparable standard. To sum up, Volumes 33 and 62 give a clear idea of the merits and defects of this edition. The establishment of a clear and reliable text for all Voltaire's works will be of inestimable value to serious students of Voltaire and the eighteenth century, and in this area there can be little doubt that the Complete Works represent a very major achievement. Some editors have done fine work, admirably balancing the conflicting claims of introduction and notes, so that both the working scholar and the general academic reader are suitably informed and served. Others have been less happy, failing on occasion to produce in any sense what seems to me to be suitable as an introduction to a critical edition, often placing in textual notes important facts which should have been expressed in a more accessible form in the work's introduction. This procedure will cause problems not only for the 'general' reader but also for those engaged in research. Imagine someone wishing to investigate some aspect of Voltaire's anti-Christian polemic or his opinions on history or a particular philosopher. Such a person will have to spend many hours reading every page of every relevant work (a huge task, and one which will not always be feasible in the real world, where time may be limited), whereas more informative introductions would allow such a person to form a reliable preliminary opinion of such a topic and could more quickly guide his research to the relevant text. I think it is this fact above all that should claim the attention of the editorial Reviews 985</page><page sequence="8">986 Reviews team, for improvements here are possible and would make this monumental edition even more valuable than it already promises to be. UNIVERSITY OF ULSTER AT COLERAINE G. GARGETT Correspondance complete. By JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU. Edited by RALPH LEIGH. Volume XLVI: I789-91. Oxford: The Voltaire Foundation. 1987. xx + 447 PP. ?50.00. It is sad to be reviewing this volume after Ralph Leigh's untimely death. The latest instalment of the magnificent Rousseau correspondence is yet another monument to the editor's mastery of every aspect of his subject. Following my earlier review of Volumes XLI-XLIII (MLR, 82 (1987), 201-02) there were two further volumes (XLIV-XLV) covering the period 1779-88 and showing graphically the growth of the Rousseau cult (most strikingly in the journal of the visit of Gabriel Brizard and Anacharsis Cloots to Ermenonville in 1783, the year after the first part of the Confessions was published). We are now several years into the posthumous life of Jean-Jacques, and have reached the most fascinating period, the first two years of the Revolution. What this volume gives is not so much a correspondence as a documentary guide to the growing cult of the citizen of Geneva - and to the disputes that continued to range around his name, his life, and his legacy. It is, of course, only a small selection from a great body of material, but the editor has chosen well. One finds here not only copiously-annotated letters with biographical sketches of their often unknown and sometimes bizarre authors and recipients, but in between the letters, and often much exceeding them in length, a rich collection of 'Remarques' which alert the reader to books and pamphlets, speeches and debates, in which Rousseau's image and influence were propagated and contested. Among the main points of interest one notes the arguments (between Du Peyrou and Pierre Moultou) about the premature publication of Part 2 of the Confessions, the very mixed feelings stirred up by the work, the continuing appeal of La Nouvelle Heloise, the ubitiquous presence of the Contrat Social in a multitude of political writings and speeches, the growing movement towards the deification of Jean-Jacques in bust, statue, play, and eloge, and the battle in the Assemblee about the transfer of his ashes to the Pantheon. There are attractive pieces by Karamzin; Isabelle de la Charriere, Du Peyrou, and Vernes emerge creditably, and we can read the melancholy (but probably inauthentic) death letter of a young man who came to Ermenonville to kill himself at the tomb of his hero. UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH PETER FRANCE A Question of Syllables: Essays in Nineteenth-Century French Verse. By CLIVE SCOTT. (Cambridge Studies in French) Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 1986. xii + 25 pp. ?27.50. This book, aimed at the general reader of French poetry, sets out to explain the role of syllabic position in French verse as a carrier of meaning, and the relationship between metre and rhythm. The poetic text is presented as 'the manifestation or realisation of a set of codes' (including, for example, lineation, 'metricity', 'rhythmi- city', rhyme, a rhetorical code, a grammatical and syntactical code, a 'generical code') among which the poet has made choices and which the general reader is not normally equipped to appreciate (p. 189). Clive Scott argues: 'Our sense of the poem as a sequence of interrelated choices is thus extremely undeveloped, as is our sense of the mutations of those conditions which govern choice and of the poem as a shifting web of changing priorities. And yet it is these things which, it might be argued,</page></plain_text>
