<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SOCIETY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE AND EXEGESIS Seventy-seventh Annual Meeting PROCEEDINGS DECEMBER 29th, 30th and 31st, 1941 T HE seventy-seventh meeting of the Society was called to order by the President, Julian Morgenstern, at 2:30 P. M. on December 29th at Union Theological Seminary, New York City. Minutes of the 1940 meeting were approved as printed in the Journal, March, 1941. The reports of the Editor and of the Secretary were accepted and ordered published with the Pro- ceedings. A vote of thanks to both these officers was accorded by the Society. The President announced appointment of the following com- mittees: Nominating Committee: R. E. Wolfe, H. Branscomb, Louise P. Smith. Auditing Committee: F. V. Filson, W. F. Stinespring, H. Orlinsky. Memorial Resolutions Committee: W. H. P. Hatch, H. G. May, N. J. Reich, F. C. Grant. A number of persons nominated for membership and recom- mended by the Council were elected members of the Society. In accordance with the recommendation of the Council it was voted to elect as Honorary Members: Professor Walther Eichrodt, University of Basel. Sir Frederic G. Kenyon, formerly of the British Museum. An oral report of the work of the American Council of Learned Societies as it relates to the interests of our Society was presented by Nelson Glueck, a delegate to the Council from this Society.</page><page sequence="2">SOCIETY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE Oral reports of the Sections of the Society were as follows: for the Mid-West Section, by F. V. Filson; for the Canadian Section, by F. W. Beare; for the Pacific Coast Section, by J. W. Flight (for Pierson Parker). It was voted that formal recogni- tion of the formation of the Pacific Coast Section be recorded. Minutes of the meetings of the three Sections were ordered pub- lished with the Proceedings. The Secretary reported actions of the Council, in which the Society voted concurrence: that the question of time and place of next year's meeting be referred to the Council for deliberation; that the index to volumes 41-60 of the Journal, prepared under the direction of Ralph Marcus, be published in bound copies, and that a charge of one dollar per copy be collected from active mem- bers desiring the index, but that delivery unbound to subscrib- ing institutions be gratis. It was announced that the Council had re-elected E. R. Goodenough as editor of the Journal and named S. Spiegel, K. Lake and J. Muilenburg to fill the vacanacies caused by expiration of the terms of G. Dahl, J. A. Montgomery and J. J. Obermann on the Editorial Committee. The other members of this Committee whose terms expired were re-elected. President Julian Morgenstern read a paper on "The Task of SBLE" as the Presidential Address. Following this address, brief discussion resulted in a vote that the Council name a committee to examine the matter of re- organization of the Society, subject to ratification by the Society at the Wednesday business session. The Society then proceeded to the consideration of the fol- lowing papers: By C. C. Torrey: The Two Messiahs. The doctrine of the two: the Son of Joseph, destined to die in battle for Israel; and the Son of David, destined to reign forever; grew out of specula- tion on Isa 53. Modern criticism recognizes no allusion to the "warrior Messiah" in the OT. In the present paper three such allusion were named and defended: 1. Zech 12 10 ff.; expressly interpreted thus in Jewish tra- dition (Sukkah, 52-a). 2. Zech 4 14; a second passage from the same apoc- alypse, the earlier chapters of which have been made over into a document of the sixth century. 3. Daniel 9 25 f. ii</page><page sequence="3">PROCEEDINGS, 1941 By F. V. Filson: The Chalice of Antioch and New Testament Study. Among church members interest in the Chalice of Antioch continues. Further study of its origin and data is being made. The proposed first- century date has such revolutionary implications for NT study that scholars in the biblical field should follow such investigations carefully. However, it is time for the NT student to point out what is at stake for him in the dating of the Chalice. He can bring forward considerations which show that either the early date proposed by Eisen or his identification of the figures on the Chalice must be challenged. By E. A. Speiser: The "Shibboleth" Incident: Judges 12 o. The incident is universally viewed as a statement concerning a peculiarity of the Ephraimite dialect. According to most commentators the matter involved reflects the contrast between S and s. In the opinion of a few the sounds in question were t and X, with the Ephraimites still retaining the t-phoneme. It can be shown, however, that chronological and geographical considerations preclude the survival of the t-phoneme in Palestine as late as the time of Jephthah. But the retention of such a phoneme in Gilead is altogether probable for that period. The contrast involved was one of t:s, the dialectical peculiarity characterizing Gilead and not Ephraim. By J. J. Obermann: A Graeco-Syriac Inscription from the Church of S. Simon the Stylite (Illustrated). The inscription was first made available by Prof. D. Krencker in APA W, 1938, no. 4, with a reading and translation by Prof. H. Lietzmann. The present paper submitted one or two points at variance with the editio princeps, in reading, translation, or restoration. It also considered the bearing of the composite record on sanctuary inscriptions in general. Monday evening, December 29. A joint session of the Society, the American Schools of Oriental Research, and the National Association of Biblical Instructors. The Society's Representa- tive on the Board of the Schools, W. J. Moulton, made the annual report on the condition and activities of the Schools. The report is printed below. R. M. Engberg, Director of the Jerusalem School, spoke on the subject "Where do we go from here in Archaeology?" Harald Ingholt, formerly of the American Uni- versity of Beirut, now of Beloit College, gave an illustrated paper on "The Danish Excavations at Old Testament Hamath on the Orontes." Tuesday morning, December 30. The Society divided into two sections. In the OT section, the following papers were presented and discussed; 111</page><page sequence="4">SOCIETY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE By Nelson Glueck: The Early Occupation of North Gilead. By E. C. Broome, Jr.: Torah and the Flight of Arrows. The word Torah derived ordinarily from h6rah, "to teach," hence means instruction, interpretation, etc. The argument of this paper is that h6rah and torah is not to be derived from the Qal root yarah, to cast, throw, etc., as ordinarily assumed, but is a separate verb, appearing only in the Hiph'il. This paper was a portion of a longer paper on the subject of the meaning of t6rah in the pre-exilic period. By R. E. Wolfe: Variant Micah Manuscripts. Consideration was given to the relationship between the two appendices (chs. 4-5 and chs. 6-7) and the basic prophecies of Micah (chs. 1-3). The conclusion was drawn that the prophecies of Micah originally circulated in two editions, by combining which the present form was achieved. By Louise P. Smith: The Date of Isaiah 3 1-15. The work of Begrich and Mowinckel, stressing the importance of the syn- chronisms in 1 &amp; 2 Kings for the correct understanding of the chronology of North Israel and Judah, suggests a revision of the dating and interpre- tation of certain passages in Isaiah. The content of the prophecy in ch. 3 1-15 suits the reign of Hezekiah, and if Mowinckel is right in rejecting Begrich's early date for the accession of Ahaz, the traditional interpretation "child" can well apply to Hezekiah. By Pearle S. Wood: Jeremiah's Figure of the Almond Rod. A criticism of interpretations which have been offered for Jeremiah's figure of the almond rod, Jer 111, 12. An examination of passages which suggest a different approach to the interpretation of this figure of speech. By Shalom Spiegel: Josiah and Jeremiah. The older theological views about the Josianic Reform. The newer his- torical information about the Josianic Reconquest. Jeremiah's ministry in Northern Israel. The value of the rabbinic tradition in Megillah 14-b. By H. G. May: Suggestions for a Fresh Approach to Study of the Book of Jeremiah. The first and most obvious problem in the interpretation of the book of Jeremiah has been almost universally overlooked: the problem of Jeremiah's biographer. It is usually taken for granted that Baruch is the biographer, without bothering to prove it. The diction and ideology of the biographer must be discovered. Although this paper was concerned with method rather than with the results, it was pointed out that the biographer belonged to the Deuteronomic school, that he had a definite purpose in the presentation of his picture of Jeremiah, and that he is responsible for the unity which Prof. Torrey has recognized in the book. This approach attempts to escape the subjectivism associated with the usual theories of unlimited additions by different schools, editors, scribes. iv</page><page sequence="5">PROCEEDINGS, 1941 In the NT section, the papers read and discussed were: By E. P. Blair: Gnostic Elements in the Gospel of Matthew. In a number of passages in the Gospel of Matthew, Mark's picture of the disciples' lack of comprehension has been changed to the exact opposite. The reason for this change has long been attributed to Matthew's desire, not only to improve Mark's portrait of Jesus, but also to paint the disciples in a more favorable light. The author of this paper believes that there is a more basic reason for this change, namely, that Matthew's Christology and conception of salvation contain gnostic elements, and that, accordingly, from Matthew's point of view, it is necessary for the disciples to understand the revelation brought by Jesus. By F. W. Beare: The Story of the Empty Grave and the Resurrection Teach- ing of the Primitive Church. The total lack of stories of Resurrection-appearances in Mark, coupled with Matthew's inability to supply the lack except by inference, suggests that in the primitive church the teaching concerning the resurrection of Jesus contained no appearance-stories. The empty-grave story is not a fragment of primitive tradition, but a legend of relatively late fabrication, for which the other three evangelists have no source but Mark. It follows that the earliest faith in the Resurrection was not based on apparitions, nor was the earliest testimony to the Resurrection an appeal to the exper- ience of eye-witnesses. By Mary E. Andrews: PEIRASMOS - A Study in Form Criticism. This paper was in the nature of a report on an interesting monograph by Joachim Hans Korn on Peirasmos: Die Versuchung des Gldubigen in der griechischen Bibel which utilizes the form-critical approach to the narratives of the temptation of Jesus. Korn traced the typical concept of Peirasmos through the LXX, the apocryphal and the rabbinic literature. The pres- ence of the fixed pattern of the testing of the righteous through temptation and the consequent victories of these faith-tested heroes forms a natural background for the use of the concept in NT writings. The narratives of Jesus' temptation were placed in their Sitz im Leben, the Christian com- munity, with the conclusion that the Synoptic picture of Jesus as the Tempted One is not so much a picture growing out of interest in preserv- ing historical data as one designed to serve cult needs, to show the Lord as the leader in every temptation, who already recognized his struggles with his enemies and his sufferings as temptations which he magnificently con- quered. By D. T. Rowlingson: The Factor of Audience in the Utterances of Jesus. Purpose of paper: to set forth the results of analysis of the audiences addressed by Jesus as a factor in interpreting his utterances. Conclusions: 1. In a large percentage of cases the factor of audience is of little help, be- v</page><page sequence="6">SOCIETY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE cause the nature of the audience is vague or not stated - particularly in Q material. 2. Where stated, such designations may be as artificial as many topographical items. 3. In some cases this factor is helpful as one tool among many. 4. The nature of the utterance is of primary importance in most cases. By Otto A. Piper: The Development of the Oral Tradition. While in the early church practical needs and alien influences from within and without tended to alter substance and meaning of the original tradi- tion, the books of the NT offer sufficient proof of the fact that the develop- ment of tradition was constantly checked by the working of three powerful authorities: the OT, Jesus both as teacher and as savior, and the apostles. The existence of these authorities is the distinguishing mark of the early church in the world of religions. Their operation explains the relatively early fixation of the oral tradition and the subsequent canonisation of our four gospels. By T. S. Kepler: Epiphany Stories as Gospel Forms. Epiphany stories play a large role in the composition of narrative mate- rials in the Synoptics. Like sacred legends these stories portray Jesus as the manifest savior through whom God's divinity shines, and by which the believer may be inspired to a life like that of the savior; yet they transcend consecrated folklore, since they are related to real characters and real situa- tions. In the miracle stories Jesus performs wonders; in the epiphany stories wonders are done to Jesus. The epiphany tales in the gospels may have his- torical basis, but the facts of history are poetically colored to depict Jesus the savior as one who is constantly under the divine control and guidance of God. Such stories never would have been developed unless there had been a saintly figure like Jesus to give a halo to such events. The epiphany stories discussed were: 1. The birth of Jesus; 2. Jesus in the temple at twelve; 3. baptism; 4. temptation; 5. transfiguration; 6. temple veil torn. Tuesday afternoon, December 30. The Society met at 2:00 at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America to hear and discuss papers in a symposium on "The Present Status of Studies in the Psalms": Chairman: C. C. Torrey. I.

The Society divided into two sections. In the OT section the following papers were presented and discussed: By C. T. Fritsch: Anti-Anthropomorphisms in the First Five Books of the Septuagint. In the LXX there is a tendency to avoid representations of conceptions of God under human form or with human attributes and affections. It was the purpose of this paper to ascertain the extent of this phenomenon, to classify the examples, to make observations on the material thus gathered. The term anti-anthropomorphic, applied to this tendency, was used in two ways: 1. in the technical or narrow sense of avoiding attribution of human form to God; 2. in the general sense of removing or moderating any attri- bute, thought, or action connected with God that would disgrace or dis- honor him. By S. L. Terrien: Personified Wisdom and the Ugaritic Texts. Examination of the arguments for and against the Canaanite origin of the personified figure of Wisdom in the Sapiential Literature, especially in Proverbs 9. By J. B. Pritchard: Some Aspects of 'Anat. 'Anat appearing in the Bible only in place names, and in that of a person (Jg 5 6) is known from Egyptian texts and monuments of the 19th dynasty as a goddess distinguished for her warlike character. This aspect of 'Anat is strikingly confirmed by a Ras Shamra text describing her wholesale massacre. By T. G. Shearman: The Thirteen Old Testament Acrostics. 1. Occurrence: in Prov, once; in Ps, 8 times; in Lam, 4 times. Embryo acrostics also in Gen, Num, Nahum. 2. Literary construction: a) as to form: one line to a letter, twice; two lines to a letter, 6 times; two and three lines to a letter, twice; three lines to a letter, twice; irregular, once. b) as to alphabetic order: Hebrew order, 10 times; Chaldee order, 3 times. c) as acrostics: perfect, 8 examples; nearly perfect, 4 examples; very imperfect, one example. Appraisal of characteristics. By J. Skinner: Story of Gog and Magog in the Colophon of a Newly Discovered Armenian MS of the "Alexander Romance." A MS known as Etchmiazin 1664, discovered by Pater Norses Akinian of the Kongregation der Mekhitaristen, Vienna, contains the best version of the legendary life of Alexander the Great. Attached to the MS is a colophon containing a short account of Gog &amp; Magog and the unclean people whom Alexander shut out from the world by great gates. Peculiar interest in this colophon is that the names of 23 of the unclean peoples are listed, and are ix</page><page sequence="10">SOCIETY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE different from other series of names appearing in the known versions of the tale. The names have a noticeably Hebraic appearance. They are in no way similar to the names listed in the Syriac version. Other peculiarities: in standard Syriac version the unclean, together with Gog &amp; Magog, will be met at Jerusalem and vanquished by God's angel. In this one they will be overthrown at the city of Joppa. There is also mention of the tomb of the prophet Jeremiah in Egypt, and the assertion that this tomb has thau- maturgic properties. By F. Zimmerman: The Edited Masoretic Text. Aside from Ketib and Qere, the masoretic text official contains no var- iants. That is remarkable. In the process of copying and recopying MT variants must have multiplied. What happened to them? The writer offers the suggestion that the masoretic scholars placed variants 1. at the end of the biblical verses; 2. occasionally at or near the Atnahta; 3. side by side in the verse. Examples of the first class, Gen 23 1; of the second, Ex 30 6; of the third, 2 Kings 5 18. In the NT section the following papers were read and dis- cussed: By L. Wallach: Origin of Testimonia Biblica in Early Christian Literature. By P. E. Davies: Jesus and the Forgiveness of Sins. A restudy of Mk 2 1-12 with reference to Jesus' claim to forgive sins. The passage is to be read in the light of contemporary theory concerning the relation between sin and physical disability, and by comparison with other Gospel statements on the forgiveness of sins (see especially John 9). What explanation can be offered for the dislocations in the thought in this pas- sage? Was this passage influenced by messianic expectation, or by early church belief? Or, does it preserve a tangent in the thinking of Jesus? By M. E. Fish: Jesus and "The Scriptures." Jesus fearlessly exposed pious frauds and pretenses. He was recognized as a master of literary interpretation. He was too alert toward deceits to be deceived, and too honest, with his silences and speeches, to deceive others. He assumed the right to correct Moses' laws. He also referred to "the Scriptures" as "the power of God," a speech of God, and an indestructible message. He used the Scriptures against the tempter, for personal medita- tions, for rebutting disputants and for helping the perplexed. He regarded Messianic aspirations and prophecies as the key motif of the OT. By K. W. Clark: The Kingdom Similes from Growth of Nature. 1. Extra-NT parallels illustrate how this type of simile is applied, with a variety of conclusions. Some of these bear directly on the manner of the coming of the Kingdom. 2. One parallel throws light on the time element, especially in the "spontaneous earth" simile. 3. The botanical sense of x</page><page sequence="11">PROCEEDINGS, 1941 dendron suggests that the usual interpretation of the mustard seed simile (contrast of size) may be invalid, and a different interpretation thereof be required. By E. S. Tanner: The Nazi Christ: A Study in Reinterpretation. It would hardly be exaggerating to say that every Christian from the first century to the present has in some sense possessed his own interpreta- tion of Jesus. The process of interpretation and reinterpretation is going on in every area of Christendom today, but perhaps the most remarkable example is to be found in Nazi Germany. The Nazi Christ, like every other creation of National Socialism, has a complex structure of historical ante- cedents. Following the pattern laid down by H. S. Chamberlain, the Nazi Christ has been rescued from Judaism and Christianity and has been made to feel at home with paganism and militarism. A study of the Nazi Christ yields no positive knowledge of the historic Jesus. Such a study does help to show, however, many of the traits of reinterpretation of Jesus which may be expected to appear among any people where the authority of the state and militarism have run wild. By A. E. Haefner: The Earliest Christian Prayer. The paper attempted to show that the prayer of Acts 4 24-30, while clearly the editorial product of the author of Acts, nevertheless presents a very primitive situation. An exegetical study of the prayer leads to important conclusions with respect to the source known as "Jerusalem A." Wednesday afternoon, December 31. The Society met in two sections. In the OT section the papers read dealt with linguistic subjects. The session ended with an informal meeting of inter- ested SBLE members with the GHSL - Group for Hamitic and Semitic Linguistics. Papers read and discussed were: By Osborne Booth: The Semantic Development of the Term Mishpat in the Old Testament. In any passage in OT in which the word mishpat occurs, its meaning may be given as one of the following: 1. manner or custom; 2. rightful due; 3. judicial decision; 4. case for decision; 5. commandment of man; 6. com- mandment of God; 7. that which should be; 8. administration of law by man; 8a. proper administration of law by man; 9. administration of law by God; 10. litigation. Probably the earliest meaning of the word was "manner or custom"; but the latest development seems to have been that, just as in the days of the Judges, Yahweh would save Israel (either the people or the individual) from his enemies, and so accomplish mishpat. By H. M. Orlinsky: On Suffixed Forms of Qal Infinitive Construct in i and a. A score of Qal infinitives of verbs most of which have o in last syllable of the impf., take the form qitl or qatl, rather than the usual qotl, before suf- xi</page><page sequence="12">SOCIETY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE fixes, e. g. b'bigdo, bil'i, mizza'po (not the expected bbo'gdo, bl'z, mizzo'po). According to Barth these forms are to be traced back to earlier impf. and infin. forms in i and a. Bauer-Leander have proposed dissimilation as the cause. This paper suggested that these anomalous infin. forms in i and a have their origin in the influence of segholate nouns of the same roots which are all similarly declined in i and a (e. g. beged-bigdi, bela'-bil'i, za'ap-z'dpi). By W. F. Albright: Abbreviated Canaanite and Hebrew Names ending in an. Comparative morphological and phonological analysis of personal names from Ugarit and other Canaanite sites show that there was a considerable category of Canaanite hypocorista which ended in a short a followed by n. Recent discoveries at Mari provide the phonological clue which proves that the vowel was short in this particular category (there was another class of adjectival names ending in dn). There are a number of early Hebrew names of the same type, such as "Ethan" and "Heman," where tradition confirms both the original short vowel in the ending and the Canaanite origin of the name. By H. L. Ginsberg: Official and Vernacular Aramaic (by title). The author's published views on this subject were further elaborated and defended against published criticisms. By R. Gordis: The Asseverative Kaph (by title). The biblical text discloses a number of passages where the Kaph is used in an unusual manner. Following Kimhi, the older grammarians called it the Kaph veritatis. This view has been generally abandoned today. How- ever, new considerations, reinforced by Ugaritic material, indicate that through a new semantic development this asseverative use of the Kaph may be validated. By R. Marcus: Stress and Vowel Quantity in Hebrew (by title). This paper examined the recent theories of A. Poebel and A. Goetze con- cerning the origin of the so-called "pretonic long vowel" in the Masoretic system, and pointed out some difficulties in the assumption that this length- ening is due to stress on this vowel in the early Hebrew period. The paper also dealt with Goetze's theory that Masoretic Hebrew forms like qtitl, qetal are derived from early Hebrew qatil, qatal and do not owe the reduced vowel in the first syllable to Aramaic influence; the present writer attempted to show that these forms are Aramaic (Amorite )in origin and are not derived from Early Hebrew (Canaanite) forms. By A. S. Halkin: A Chapter in the History of Samaritan Exegesis (by title). Papers read in the NT section were as follows: By P. Schubert: Eyewitness Authority in Luke-Acts. 1. In Acts eyewitness authority is often appealed to as proof for the truth of the apostolic message. The exegetical analysis of pertinent passages shows xii</page><page sequence="13">PROCEEDINGS, 1941 that a) this concept in Luke-Acts has several more or less distinct and important connotations; b) it is an integral part of a larger apologetic and theological scheme characteristic of Luke-Acts. 2. These findings raise several historical problems: a) eyewitness authority in the early church before and after Luke-Acts; b) the relation between eyewitness authority and charismatic authority in the early church. By D. W. Riddle: The Jewishness of Paul. By S. V. McCasland: Paul's Conceptions of Brotherhood. A comparative study of Paul's ideas of brotherhood with the purpose of indicating to what extent he follows along lines already marked out for him in Judaism; or whether he speaks the language of Hellenism; or a language entirely his own. By B. M. Metzger: Notes on the Saturday and Sunday Lessons from Luke. On the basis of collations of twelve gospel lectionaries a text of the Satur- day and Sunday lessons from Luke has been constructed. This paper dis- cusses 1. the influence of the lectionary text in this area on non-lectionary gospel MSS, and 2. analyzes the nature and significance of variants from the Textus Receptus both in the whole area and in selected lections. By H. R. Willoughby: Hans Holbein the Younger and the Coverdale Title Pages of 1535 and 1539-41 (by title). Historians of the English Bible regularly attribute to Hans Holbein the Younger the title-page woodcut for the Great Bibles of 1539-41. They never attribute to him the Coverdale title page of 1535. Art critics exactly reverse the ascriptions. Norms for testing these assignments are provided by Holbein's own woodcuts. His mannerisms in draftsmanship, composi- tion, design, and iconography yield decisive tests for determining the validity of these contradictory attributions. Results thus obtained require revision of sections on the 1535 and 1539 title pages in virtually all standard works dealing with the history of the English Bible. By J. W. Bailey: The Autobiography of Paul (by title). By E. R. Lacheman: Mistranslations of Aramaic into Greek (by title). A study of Aramaic mistranslations reveals that a) the translator must have used a written source (e. g. confusion of one letter for a similar one); b) the translator was a scholar whose mother tongue was Greek but who had a scholarly, though not a natural knowledge of Aramaic (e. g. the mis- use of one meaning of a word with a double meaning, for the other is more directly explained thus). Examples of mistranslations may be given. Both sections adjourned about 3:30 P. M. JOHN W. FLIGHT, Secretary. xiii XllI</page><page sequence="14">SOCIETY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY During the year 1941, 58 persons elected at last year's meeting qualified for membership in the Society and have been added to our list.

The present active membership of the Society appears to number 678, which with 16 honorary members make a total of 694, a net gain of 88 over last year's enrollment. An additional 14 persons, whose formal election waits upon this meeting, have paid their membership dues and received the Journal during 1941, having been placed on our mailing list. Notices of the deaths of the following members have been received: Rev. Caspar R. Gregory, died during 1940, a member since 1927. Prof. J. Rendel Harris, died Mar. 1, 1941, a member since 1884.

It mentioned with satis- faction the completion of the sixtieth volume of the JOURNAL, and explained that the Index of volumes forty-one to sixty, so well prepared by Professor Ralph Marcus, was ready for the printer. Its publication had been postponed in the hope of getting a subvention from the ACLS. This attempt had failed, xiv</page><page sequence="15">PROCEEDINGS, 1941 xv but the Index would nevertheless be published in March.* Sincere thanks for their help were expressed to those cooperating with the Editor. The rise of printing prices makes it necessary to plan a somewhat reduced JOURNAL for 1942. It was hoped that by greater attention to brevity on the part of both contributors and Editors this might mean not too great a loss of content. Contributors were warned that abbreviations would be imperative. This digest of the Editor's report is a sample of what we must all do. Respectfully submitted, ERWIN R. GOODENOUGH, Editor. *By vote of the Society the Index will be sent free, but unbound, to sub- scribers. It is to be sold to members and others, bound, at $1 a copy.</page><page sequence="16">xvi SOCIETY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE TREASURER'S REPORT FOR 1941 RECEIPTS Balance from 1940 .............................$ 959.93 Dues and Arrears . ............... .......... 2,140.44 Reprints and Alterations........................ 37.76 Yale University Press, Library and Non-member Subscriptions ......... ....................... 544.41 Anonymous Contribution for Prize Memberships for Theological Students ......................... 153.00 Interest ................................... ... 31.68 $ 3,867.22 EXPENDITURES Printing and Mailing JOURNAL ..................$ 2,664.31 Editor's Expenses............................. 114.86 Secretary's Expenses........................... 46.52 Treasurer's Expenses ........................... 41.92 Annual Meetings . ............................. 139.06 American Council of Learned Societies ............ 50.00 Exchange..................................... 1.38 Refunds .................. .................... 12.75 $ 3,070.80 Balance on Hand, Dec. 27, 1941 ................. 796.41 $ 3,867.22 Total Assets Balance on Hand ..............................$ 796.42 2 $500 U.

STINESPRING</page><page sequence="17">PROCEEDINGS, 1941 REPORT OF THE SOCIETY'S REPRESENTATIVE ON THE BOARD OF THE AMERICAN SCHOOLS OF ORIENTAL RESEARCH During the past year the American Schools of Oriental Research have suf- fered the loss of two of their outstanding members. On Feb. 19 Edward Theodore Newell of Huntington, L. I. and New York City died, while still in the midst of his career as one of the world's most eminent numismatists. An incorporator of the Schools, he was at the time of his death a member of our official board. As a token of his abiding interest in our work, he made pro- vision in his will for a bequest of $5,000 toward our Endowment Fund. News of the death of Dr. Clarence Stanley Fisher in the Government Hos- pital of Jerusalem on July 20 reached us during the summer. For many years a Professor of Archaeology at the Jerusalem School, he was serving as its Acting Director at the time of his decease. Dr. Fisher was widely known and was highly esteemed for his outstanding contributions to the methods of archaeo- logical research, and for his many achievements in this field. He will be remem- bered also in Jerusalem circles for his many benefactions and ready response to calls of need. The state of war in the Mediterranean area precluded any thought of field work in either Palestine or Iraq. Our fully developed plans for a final season of excavation at Tepe Gawra had to be abandoned. In Palestine the situation was much the same, but here the School continued to be a center of research, and Prof. Fisher gave instruction to individual students. It is also reported that our excellent Library is "being fully used by scholars and students of Palestine." Within our Jerusalem School grounds there was a small venture in excava- tion carried on under the joint auspices of our Schools and the neighboring Hebrew University on Mount Scopus. This undertaking was prompted by the recent discovery of a further portion of the so-called "Third Wall," when the municipality of Jerusalem widened the road behind our tennis courts. The quest on our part was successful and thus gave further confirmation as to the identity and course of the so-called "Wall of Agrippa." (As to the present status of this question see Dr. Albright's article in the February Bul- letin of the American Schools, No. 81). Prof. Fisher cooperated also, in our behalf, in a minor task of prehistoric research at Ulugharat Abu Usba, a cave in the Mt. Carmel area. Of this undertaking we are awaiting a further report. During the war period our property in Jerusalem is placed under the super- vision of the resident American Consul General. Meanwhile the person having direct management of the affairs of the School premises is Mrs. Inna Pom- merantz, who was the very efficient secretary of Dr. Glueck, and later of Dr. Fisher. Thus far the rooms in the hostel have been quite fully occupied, first by members of consular families from Egypt, and latterly by Red Cross repre- XVll</page><page sequence="18">SOCIETY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE sentatives, English officials and missionaries. Emergency gardening on our grounds is reported to have had a measure of success. Conditions in Palestine have been very difficult, in part because of failure of its two main sources of revenue: tourists and export of oranges. Yet some advances are reported in industries having to do with military equipment. Word has come of a Palestinian Industrial Exhibition in Cairo in the interest of fuller trade cooperation with Egypt. The existing limitations of the usual activities of the Schools make it pos- sible to center our attention on other tasks that are no less important. In the field of publication we are pressing forward, and are seeking to meet our obligations to the fullest extent that our funds permit. Dr. Speiser's overdue "Introduction to Hurrian" appeared on Dec. 1, and the textual and lexical portions are to follow in due season. The next volume of our Annual is scheduled to be devoted to "The Iron Age" as revealed by the excavation of Tell Belt Mirsim. Progress is being made also on the second volume of Dr. Glueck's excavations at Tepe Gawra, and the Baghdad School is sponsoring a volume on the "Sumerian Literary Texts from Nippur" by Dr. S. N. Kramer, a former fellow of the Schools. It is expected that the XXIInd volume of the Annual will be devoted to Dr. Glueck's excavations at Ezion-Geber. Among the other tasks of publication still outstanding is that of issuing several thousand tablets from Nuzi on which Dr. Lacheman is working. Respectfully submitted, WARREN J. MOULTON Report of Proceedings of the Midwest Section of the Society is omitted because of postponement of the usual November meet- ing until March 1942 in order to meet jointly with the Midwest Branch of the American Oriental Society. xviii XV111</page><page sequence="19">PROCEEDINGS, 1941 PROCEEDINGS OF THE CANADIAN SECTION OF THE SOCIETY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE AND EXEGESIS Third Annual Meeting, May 13, 1941 The third annual meeting of the Canadian Section of the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis was held in Em- manuel College, Toronto, on the afternoon of May 13, 1941. In the absence of the president and vice-president, Professor R. B. Y. Scott acted as chairman. Fourteen members, in addi- tion to some visitors, were present. The minutes of the second annual meeting, as printed in the March 1941 issue of the Journal, were approved. The secretary, Professor F. V. Winnett, gave a brief report on the membership of the Canadian Section. Professor C. R. Feilding (Trinity College, Toronto) was nomi- nated for membership in the Society. Professor T. C. Young spoke briefly on behalf of the American Oriental Society, urging members to acquaint themselves with the work of that Society and if possible to join it. It was moved and seconded that the new executive of the Canadian Section of the Society of Biblical Literature and Exe- gesis should be the same as had just been elected to serve as the officers for the Canadian Society of Biblical Studies for the cur- rent year. The executive for 1941-42 for the Canadian Section of SBLE is therefore as follows: Honorary president, Sir Robert Falconer, Toronto; President, Professor F. Beare, Presbyterian College, Montreal; Vice-president, Professor N. H. Parker, McMaster University, Hamilton; Secretary, Professor W. S. McCullough, University College, University of Toronto. (In explanation of the above, it should be stated that on the evening of May 12 and the forenoon of May 13 most of the members of the Canadian Section of SBLE had been present at the ninth anual meeting of the Canadian Society of Biblical Studies, also held in Emmanuel College, Toronto.) xix</page><page sequence="20">SOCIETY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE In the absence of the president, Dean G. B. King of Winnipeg, the presidential address Pioneers in Biblical Critical Science in Canada was read by the secretary. The address elicited consider- able discussion.

Professor McCown called the meeting to order. Moved by Professor Wicher that the group organize as a sec- tion of the SBLE. Seconded and, after considerable discussion, voted. The group proceeded to organize, through election of officers, and each of the following was, upon nomination, elected by acclamation: President, Professor McCown, Vice-President, Professor Wicher, Secretary, Pierson Parker. Voted that the officers as thus elected be a committee, to work in conjunction with the executive committee of the Pacific Coast Meetings of Learned Societies, for the arrangement of programs and other matters. Voted that the said committee of officers be authorized to appoint a membership committee to promote the Section on campuses, among ministers, and elsewhere. Voted that the officers be authorized to establish contact with the parent Society, and to take such other steps as are necessary for organization. The meeting adjourned.
