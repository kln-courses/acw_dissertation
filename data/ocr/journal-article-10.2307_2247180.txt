Pp. xxiv., 479; viii., 539. All English students of Ethics who are acquainted with the polished and powerfully written essays on philosophical subjects which Dr. Martineau published, in collected form, sixteen years ago, and who are at all aware of the influence that he has exercised for a longer period over successive generations of hearers, will have hailed with satisfaction the appearance of these two volumes. And their expectations of pleasure and profit to be derived from the work-especially from that part of it in which Dr. Martineau's own ethical view is expounded-will not be disappointed. Whether, indeed, the book will contribute materially to turn the tide of opinion, which has long drifted steadily away from the ethical position that Dr. Martineau adopted in past years and still maintains, is a different ques- tion; to which, perhaps, I am hardly able to give a sufficiently unbiassed answer. I will try to do what the limits of a Critical Notice allow, to enable my readers to answer it for themselves. The plani of Dr. Martineau's treatise is that of "placing theb positive construction of doctrine at the centre, midway between two wings of critical analysis ". The true mnethod of ethics, as, he conceives it, is essentially psychological; it starts with the moral sentiments of the self-conscious man, which it is the busi-- ness of ethics "I to interpret, to vindicate and to systematise ". It is admitted that "in dealing with its problems it is impossible to remain within the limits of self-interrogationi-it is inevitable that ethics should run out beyond the circle of mere introspec- tion, in order to determine" the relations which man bears tow Nature and to God; but it is an essential characteristic of the true ethical method that it "begins from the self-conscious man, as better known, treats the phenomena so found as genuine pheno- mena,," and "gives to reflective self-knowledge precedence, in ethical relations, over other knowledge ". It is therefore con- trasted, in the first place, with " Unpsychological " theories, which. give priority to the investigation either of Nature, considered as. the " totality of perceptible phenomena," or of "the eternal groun-d and cause whose essence they express ". But, in the second place, the true method of ethics, we are told, is not only psychological, but " Idio-psychological "; it not only starts with the moral sentiments, it also "vindicates their indepelndent cha- racter" and resists all efforts to reduce them to some other species of mental phenomena. It is therefore opposed to all systems which " slur the boundaries" of our several facultiea.</page><page sequence="2">J. MARTINEAU, TYPES OF ETHICAL THEORY. 427 and attempt to " make out that the moral differences which they are engaged in cross-questioninig are only sensational differences under skilful disguise; or, it may be, intellectual differences in an emotional form; or, again, cesthetic differences brought with an alias into court ". Such systems-which are all "fairly reducible" to the three varieties just distinguished-are designated by Dr. Martineau as " Hetero-psychological "; and he places his criti- cism of them after the exposition of his own " Idio-psychological " doctrine for the important philosophical reason that we ought to ascertain the "story" that the moral consciousness "'tells of itself," before we attempt to "evolve the moral fromn the unl- moral phenomena of our nature ". On the other hand-if I mistake not-his reason for placing his criticisms of " UDpsycho- logical " theories first is rather a historical one. "Psychological ethics," he tells us, are " altogether peculiar to Christendom"; the Greek schools are " all essentially unpsychological and ob- jective," and it is therefore, in accordance with the order in which thought has actually developed itself to begin our study of ethics with the " Unpsychological" scheme of Plato. We find, however, that, in order to complete the critical survey of this species of error, in its most appropriate types, we have to go down the stream of time to the 19th century. For while Plato and Spinoza are offered as the most instructive examples of the fate of ethical theory when based on Metaphysics instead, of Psychology - being mutually contrasted as representing re- spectively the " system of transcendency " and the " system of immanency "-the most perfect type of a purely physical doctrine of morals is found in Auguste Comte. On the whole, therefore, historical grounds are only allowed a very subordinate place in determiniing the arrangement of Dr. Martineau's critical results. Plato, Spinoza with his predecessors Descartes and Malebranche, and Comte, occupy the first volume in chronological order; but Clarke, the antagonist of Spinoza, and Hobbes, who was to some extent Spinoza's master in ethico-political speculation, are rele- gated as "I Hetero-psychologists " to the latter half of the second. The contrasts which this arrangement suggests are no doubt instructive; and Dr. Martineau's own view is more sharply anld clearly defined for us by its many-sided opposition- to the other doctrines discussed. Still a treatmlient so disregardful of histo- rical order almost inevitably sacrifices the more positive part of the instruction which the study of our intellectual anlcestors has to give us. The use of Plato and Spinoza, as presented by Dr. Martineau, is a purely negative one; they are not stages in a continuous process of development towards the fuller and clearer ethics at which we have now arrived, but merely sign-posts to show us the path wbich the human mind should not take in the I I have not space to exhibit as I slhould like to do the amount of error that appears to me to be involved in this sweeping statement.</page><page sequence="3">-428 CRITICAL NOTICES: pursuit of ethical truth. I am far from implying that this polemical attitude has made Dr. Martineau's treatment of these thinkers in any degree unfair, or, on the whole, seriously un- sympathetic. I do not doubt that he is as genuinely anxious to " save what is imperishable "in the philosophy of Plato and Spinoza as to confute what is erroneous; and there is argumentative force -as well as rhetorical persuasiveness in the apology he offers for his strictures on Plato:- " Philosophy aspires to rise above tlle transitory and gain the vision of ,eternal truth; and it pays the penalty of this proud pretension in being tried by codes and courts for ever new, and having to satisfy the claims of all. Appealing to the absolute, it forbids us to give it only an historical lhearing; and we should do it its most aggravating wrong, did we not bring it face to face witlh the accumulative experience and matured insiglht -of the human mind."' No doubt, so long as the admirers of a great historic thinker will not suffer him to keep his place in the past, but insist on present- ing his works as a perennial source of philosophic truth, it is inevitable that we should handle these ancient treatises in a critical and polemical and not merely historical manner. Still, it is important that our criticism and controversy should be based on a careful study of their historical relations; because this alone can enable us to enter into their point of view sufficiently to make our criticism profitable; this alone can save us from the error of unconsciously mixing modern categories with those of an earlier period, and expecting a definite answer to questions which were not within the view, or only just within the purview, of the thinkers whom we are studying. And if this is generally true, there is no ancient thinker of whom it is more true than Plato: since the ethical thought of Plato-whether we consider it in itself or in relation to his meta- physics-is not presented to us anywhere as a settled system, but rather as a process through a series of stages from the starting- point of Socrates to the fully fornmulated and articulated result of Aristotle. To understand the earlier stages especially, we have to keep before our minds the influence of the master: while for the comprehension of the ultimate drift of Platonic speculation the formulae of the disciple give us invaluable assistance. What strikes me as erroneous in Dr. Martineau's rendering of Platonic ,ethics is, I think, chiefly due to his neglect of its historical relations. Thus he attributes to Plato a "preference of voluntary pravity to involuntary-a preference openly defended by him against the pro- test of natural feeling," on the strength of a passage in Hippias munor: whereas it appears to me certain that the argument of this dialogue-which belongs to the earliest, most Socratic, stage of Plato's development-is purely " elenchic " and negative in its direct results: the positive doctrine indirectly suggested being that voluntary pravity is impossible, on the ground of the well-</page><page sequence="4">J. MARTINEAU, TYPES OF ETHICA1L THEORY. 429 known Socratic identification of vice with ignorance. 'That no man knowingly prefers evil to good ' is a proposition which forms the node of Plato's argument in more than one dialogue: and though his psychology led him to recognise ' discord' in the soul as a source of evil distinct from ignorance, I conceive that he never abandoned his master's position so far as to give the definite positive answer which Dr. Martineau tries to elicit from him to the question of Free-will. This appears, indeed, in the very passage on which Dr. Martineau seems most to rely for proof of Plato's Libertarianism-the passage in the myth at the end of the Reputblic, in which the souls of men are represented as choosing their lots in life. For wrong choice at this crisis of destiny is expressly attributed to ignorance: " our chief care must be, dear Glaucon," says the master, " to discover, each of us, who can give him capacity and skill' to choose the better life among the possible alternatives." The moral of the fable is, in short, the paramount importance of sound philosophy: for Plato, as - for all the schools spiung from Socrates-with the partial 2 exception of Aristotle-the philosophic Reason is the sole natural lord and ruler of the soul. Hence, again, it appears to me to indicate a very profound misapprehension when Dr. Martineau suggests that Plato's fourfold division of Virtue properly implies a fourth principle in the soul, having " dominance over" vo 9, Ouoo and C'-Ovut'a. He admits that Plato does not "overtly " in- troduce such a principle: but thinks that he gives "a clue to it " indirectly in the supremacy attributed by him to tKUt0oav,: that he may " have felt that Intellect, as such, could not after all be put upon the seat of guidance, but must itself be made available in the career of life, by a power over it". I think it altogether im- possible that Plato-or any other " vir Socraticus "-should have felt this: and, I cannot find an atom of support for the sugges- tion in the Republic or any other dialogue. And this leads me to ask how far Dr. Martineau is justified in characterising Plato's ethical theory as " Unpsychological ". I grant that in Plato's ideal system of philosophic thought all judgments as to good and bad in conduct would be applica- tions, to the obscurer region of concrete life, of the clear and certain knowledge of absolute good which the philosopher would 1 TL a r ' roteL avvar6OV Kalt CLMO-T? ova. I must guard mvself, how- ever, from being supposed to rely on Plato's myths as a source of know- ledge of his philosophy. Dr. Martineau's statement that "they often express the doctrines most sacred to hiis faith, though least effectually guarcled in his philosophy," seenms to me misleading ; so far as it implies that Plato kept a place in his system for beliefs which he held to be certain though not philosophically grounded. 2 I say "partial," because in Aristotle's view the speculative or philoso- phising reason was in a sense supreme, as its exercise constituted tlle highest mode or elenment of human life: though it did not, in his view, furnish practical guidance for the rest of life.</page><page sequence="5">430 CRITICAL NOTICES: possess: the preinisses of ethical reasoning would be somehow supplied by transcendental metaphysics. But this ideal deduc- tion of ethics is nowhere presented to us as actually worked out in Plato's dialogues: certainly the ethical doctrine of the Republic, which Dr. Martineau is mainly occupied in criticising, is reached by the " inferior road" of empirical psychology. Indeed the only part of Plato's ethics definitely traceable to his doctrine of ideas is his view of the essential superiority of philosophic contemplation, in which the soul lays hold of reality, as compared with all other psychical functions or exercises. But this view is in no way dependent on the " trans- cendency" of Plato's metaphysics: in fact it is more definitely and emphatically put forward by Aristotle whose metaphysical 4 scheme " is distinguished as " Immanental ". When he passes to treat of Spinoza, Dr. Martineau cannot be accused of neglecting the historical relations of the system which he is mainly engaged in examining: he pays adequate attention to the antecedent doctrines of Descartes and Malebranche-in- deed his careful exposition of the latter's system fills an impor- tant gap in the history of philosophy, as it has so far been written for English readers.' I do not, however, think that he has traced the development of Cartesianism through its various stages with quite the subtlety and closeness of investigation that he has em- ployed on Spinoza.2 He attributes to Descartes without qualifi- cation or reserve the doctrine that body and mind " are incapable of dealings with one another . . . and, for any mutual con- verse, might as well be at opposite ends of the diameter of the ,solar system ". Now doubtless Descartes was tending towards this position: but there is no adequate evidence that he ever personally arrived at it. I do not think it had ever entered into his head at the time he wrote the Meditationes: and it appears to me very importalnt to keep in mind that in the first stage-at any rate-of his philosophy, his fundamental doctrine was not the mutual incornmunicability of mind and matter but their essential independence, proved to the self-conscious mind by the possibility of conceiving matter annihilated. On the other hand, I think 1 I feel bouncd to point out a peculiarity in the arrangement of this part of the book, whlich is likely to perplex readers. Dr. Martineau gives first &lt;pp. 156-193 inclus.) what appears to be intended as a complete exposition of Malebranche's system; and then afterwards (pp. 194-233) what he calls an " estimate " of the system-but in fact one of the most important parts of Malebranche's metaphysics and the whole account of his Traite de Morale is reserved for the so-called " estimate," which is therefore to a great extent ,expository rather than critical. 2As it is not very long since Dr. Martineaui's Study of Spinoza was noticed in these pages, I have-under the urgent necessity of selection-- passed over that portion of this new book which relates to Spinoza. I ought, however, to say that it is an independent piece of work, and not a mere rifacimento of the earlier Study.</page><page sequence="6">J. MARTINEAU, TYPES OF ETHICAL THEORY. 431 that Descartes nmaintained from first to last a perfect distinctness in conception between psychical and material facts. When Dr. Martineau says-with rather less dignity of style than usual- that "his logic came to grief when he stumbled on the pheno- menon of animal feeling . . . not knowing what to do with it, he awards it sometimnes to the corporeal at others to the mental nature"; I think the critic has been misled by mere ambiguities or superficial inadvertencies in Descartes' language, and has overlooked the fact that he expressly extends his term " thought " (cogitatio, pensee) to include all psychical phenomena -sensations and volitions as well as operations of the intellect.' Equally mistaken, I think, is Dr. Martineau's attempt to fix a similar charge of confusion on Malebranche, on account of his use of the termI "animal spirits "-which the critic strangely seems to regard as an invention of the Cartesian school. At least, I find no evidence to show that Malebranche ever coniceived his " animal spirits " otherwise than as purely material: though he seems sometimes to lapse from the strictness of his occa- sionalist doctrine so far as to regard the movements of the brain as causes of psychical phenomena. However, the general account here given of Malebranche's system both metaphysical and ethical, is interesting, and-so far as I can venture to judge--in the main adequate. The reasons why Dr. MartineaL has allotted so large a space to a writer whom he does not select as a "type of ethical theory" are partly, I suppose, suggested in the following comnparison: In (Malebranche)philosophy goes over from the hesitating position in which Descartes had placed it into complete supernatuiralism; as, in Spinoza, it passes into complete naturalism. The contrast between thenm is interesting, as showing the divergent directions which the inevitable struggle for consistency may take, when a system deficient in coherence is seized on and worked out by minds of opposite tendenev. Had Spinoza really been influencedl by the mvstical turn of thoight wlich is ascribed to him, and which at first sight his language sowiiie imes seems to favour, he would have found his task already accomplished by his French contem- porary; and his ethics would have repeated, instead of superseding, the Recherche de la Veritd. But the speculative genius which was common to both men served a different needl in each of them; in Malebranche, to give base andl persuasiveness to Religion; in Spinoza, to give unity and niiversalitv to Science; in the one to exhibit the universe as divine ; in tIic ot I i to prove it '"geometrical" starting in each case witlpremisses taken from Descartes. The contrast thus drawn is striking and instructive: and appears to me in the main true, provided the terms " mystical " and "I divine" are used in the restricted sense in which Dr. Martineau naturally-and, I think, legitimately-uses them: i.e., as necessarily implying the conception of a Divine Spirit, to 1 Compare (e.g.) the definitions given in his Reply to the Second Objec- jections to the Meditationes.</page><page sequence="7">432 CRITICAL NOTICES: whom volitiona and emotion, as well as thought, are attributed, and a personal or quasi-personal relatioll between the human spirit and the divine. But however much a religious philosopher mnay legitimately prefer Malebranche to Spinoza, he ought to point out that the formier's superiority as a theologian is attained at the expense of philosophic consistency. The God whom Male- branche worshipped as a Christian, and the God whose necessary existence he was confident of proving as a Cartesian, remain in his system two distinct conceptions: no serious attempt is made to derive the former from the latter. Indeed, notwithstanding the horror which Malebranche doubtless sincerely entertained of the impious atheism of his contemporary, there is an almost startling affinity between Spinoza's conception of God, and that which Malebranche appears to have in his mind when he is writing purely as a metaphysician. The idea, he tells us, of the God that necessarily exists is a perfectly simple idea: it is the idea of " l' etre en general, l'etre sans restriction, l' etre infi"i 7 as contrasted with " tel etre ". The reason alone gives us no right to conclude that God is a spirit: it is true that "Iil doit 8tre piuttot esprit que corps, puisque notre aime est plus parfaite que notre corps"; but reason gives us no assurance that there are not beings "plus parfaits que nos esprits": and indeed it is evident that God being " l'etre sans restriction " must " renfermer en lui-meme les perfections de la mati6re ". It is clear that we are getting very near to the Spinozistic deity, of which Extension is one attribute; but we get even nearer in a later treatise,1 quoted by Dr. Martineau, in which we are expressly told that " God is extended no less than bodies "-though not after the manner of bodies, since his substance has no parts.2 Why such a being, so far as cognisable by reason, should be conceived as " loving him- self " or finite things, Malebranche scarcely tries to explain: and he is faini to admit that the attributes of goodness, mercy and long- suffering, which he is doubtless sincere in predicating of God, can only be predicated in a non-nlatural sense.3 1 Entretiens sur la Mctaphysique, vii. The phrases before quoted are from the Recherche de la Verite, III., ii., 9, and IV., 11. 2 Before leaving Malebranche's metaphysics I must notice a not uniMn- portant error in iDr. Martineau's account of his doctrine of ideas. Dr. Martinea-L represents him as holding that " the difference between images or representations anid ideas is tlhe difference between knower and known " (p. 260): that "modifications of the mind are confined to the senses and imagination, anid do not enter the area of the reason" (p. 204). Now Malebranche undoubtedly distinguished his "ideas " from "modifications de l'ame ": but Dr. Martineau does not seem to have observed that he ex- pressly included under the latter term not merely " ses propres sensationis " and " ses imaginations," but also " ses pures intellections." (Recherche de la TzerittE 11., ii., 1.) 3 Cp. Entretiens, viii.: "Dieu n'est ni bon, ni misericordieux, ni patient selon les idees vulgaires."</page><page sequence="8">J. MARTINEAU, TYPES OF ETHICAL THEORY. 433 I must apologise for having dwelt so long on the metaphysics of Descartes and Malebranche, that I have no space to examine Dr. Martineau's exposition of the latter's ethical doctrine. The fact is that, throughout this first volume, there is a distinct pre- ponderance of metaphysical discussion over ethical; if it were not for the title of the work the reader would never suspect that his attention was being specially called to ethical theories. This is especially true of the last part of the volume, which is devoted to Auguste Comte; of the 105 pages which Dr. Martineau em- ploys on this thinker, not more than a dozen appear to be con- cerned with his ethical doctrines. But, in fact, when we con- sider Dr. Martineau's coiiception of the nature of an ethical theory together with his conception of the proper limits of its treatment in the present work, the difficulty rather is to under- stand how he can legitimately have found so much to say about the ethics of the founder of Positivism. "The requirements of my subject," says Dr. Martineau, p. 265, "limit me to a con- sideration of its theoretic base, and withhold me from following it into the practical application "; and by " theoretic base " he means, as another passage shows, a "fundamental doctrine of obligation ". But Comte, if I understand him, would as soon think of having a fundamental doctrine of being, as a funda- mental doctrine of obligation, in Dr. Martineau's sense. Ex- cluding " metaphysics " from his system, he consistently excludes every possible " theoretic base " of this kind for his Art of Morals -unless the term can be applied to his historical exposition of the gradually increasing ascendancy of altruism over egoism in the course of social evolution. If, therefore, Comte is seriously considered as a systematic moralist, it must be either as a historian of social development in its mloral aspect, or as the constructor of a moral and political ideal for the future of society; and the reader will regret that Dr. Martineau, who pays a gene- rous tribute of appreciation to the " wisdom," " noble humanity," and "profound insight" that characterise Comte's work as a practical teacher-in spite of its fantastic details-has not found himself able to dwell on it at somewhat more length. However, both the biography and the exposition and criticism of the Positive Philosophy which he has given us instead are careful, impartial, instructive, and-allowing for the polar opposition of philo- sophical standpoints-not unsympathetic.' The " varieties of Unpsychological theory" which we have so far been occupied in examining have, in Dr. Martineau's view, the, common characteristic that they " leave no room for the conditions 1 I would especially commend the careful and judicious summary of Comnte's debt to Saint Simoll, which is here given. This debt is not such as to prevent us from attributing to Comte originality of the first order; but it is too important to be treated as lightly as it has usually been by the English admirers of Comte. 28</page><page sequence="9">434 CRITICAL NOTICE S: of moral agency, viz., a well-grounded distinction of better and worse, a real authority in the former, and a free personality to give or refuse its rights ". Let us now turn to the " Idiopsycho- logical" method which alone, in our author's view, can duly provide these conditions; let us examine the " story which the moral consciousness tells of itself " through Dr. Martineau as its interpreter. In discussing this narrative, it will be convenient to begin with the account given of the form of the moral judgment, and the general character of the objects to which it is applied; and then proceed to consider the detailed classification of these objects which Dr. Mar- tineau offers. In the first place the moral judgment is essentially comparative or preferential: its primary form is not " X is right " or " good," but "X is better than Y ". "The whole ground of ethical procedure consists in this: that we are sensible of a graduated scale of excellence among our natural principles, quite distinct from the order of their intensity." Hence, to express the " attribute ultimate and essential " which moral judgment predi- cates, the word " moral worth " is to be preferred, since " duty " and " right " are so habitually used of " single problems and con- crete cases, that they . . . do not easily lend themselves to the expression of relative intensities of excellence throughout the whole system of ethical combinations ". At the same time, in each concrete case, each, separate moral experience, the " duty " or " obligation " to prefer the worthier object to the less worthy is distinctly recognised: though conscience, or the moral faculty, in Dr. Martineau's view, is " the mere inner sense of differences along the scale of imiipulses," this sense carries with it an autho- ritative direction to choose the higher. And he holds that these notions of obligation and authority do not merely express a rela- tion-as in the Kantian view-between the autonomous rational self and the non-rational inclinations: " to speak of one part of self imposing obligation on another part is to trifle with the real significance of the sentiments that speak within us ". If " the sense of authority means anything, it means the discernment of something higher than we ": and as " we " are " persons," this higher something can only be "another Person, greater and higher and of deeper insight ". In short, a " subjective con- science is impossible"; the moral preference, qua moral, is essentially a preference commanded by God: and since the validity of the dictates of conscience must stand or fall with the validity of their theological implications, the so-called "Idio- psychological" method of Dr. Martineau turns out to be-if I may so say-essentially Theo-psychological. I do not now propose to argue against this view; but I think that the ancient and well-known difficulties involved in it deserve more attention than they have received from Dr. Martineau. If the claim to authority, essentially involved in the recognition by the human mind of moral differences, can only be conceived as</page><page sequence="10">J. MARTINEAU, TYPES OF ETHICAL THEORY. 435 the authority of "another person," the following dilemma is immediately presented: Is this other Will, in its turn, to be con- ceived as moral or non-moral ? To take the latter alternative, to say that our ultimate obedience is due to mere arbitrary external Will, to which no moral attributes can with any meaning be applied, is a solution from which some theologians have not shrunk; but I conceive that such a view would be repudiated as an offensive paradox by the moral and religious consciousness of most plain men. If, on the other hand, the Supreme Will is affirmed to be essentially a moral will, then the theologian is called upon to explain in what sense the term " moral" is predi- cated in this affirmation; and since he is manifestly under the necessity of giving it some signification which will not involve a reference to an external authority-for the Will was assumed to be supreme, and we cannot have Person set over Person ad infini- tum-he will have to explain why the essential meaning of moral choice, as attributed to God, cannot also be the essential meanilng of moral choice as attributed to man. And such an explanation is, I think, especially due to us from Dr. Martineau, since it would be difficult to find a philosophic writer whose conception of the Divine Mind is more definitely and confidently anthropomorphic. Not merely does he hold and express with the utmost emphasis-what I trust I may speak of as the ' better opinion' of theologians generally-that religious obedience cannot be due to mere omnipotent Will, conceived without moral attributes; that, entirely divorced from a moral nature, mere power or intelligence could be the object of no " veneration "; that only by attributing to God an " inward rule of Right which gives law to the action of his power," and allowing the validity in man of a " sense of a Divine kindred and a Divine likeness," can we " elevate into ' Authority' what else would operate only as a necessity or a bribe ". He goes further than these current generalities; he presses the analogy between Divine and human morality to the utmost extent that common sense and common reverence would permit, in such passages as the following:- "In expressing their conception of a Divine moral government of the world, meni are not content to say, ' God will deal with us according to our works', but 'God must needs deal (i.e., ought' to deal) with us according to our works"' (p. 105). Again," Christianity . . . finds [God] sympathising with the struggles of tempted souls . . . nor is it possible to recognise this sympathy with human probation, without in some way carrying up the light and shade of moral distinctions into His own inmost being. The only question is how to conceive any shadow there and hold the idea of a contrast at all. Is it not impossible that the faintest evil should be in Him? Perhaps the natural answer of Christian feeling would be: Morally impossible most assuredly it is; but naturally, or otherwise than by pre- ferential affection, not so : the idea of the alternative evil cannot be denied I The italics are Dr. Martineau's.</page><page sequence="11">436 CRITICAL NOTICES: to Him, without limiting His view of possibilities; the power to realise it, were He intent upon it, can still less be questioned ; that He rejects it from his personal deterimiination . . . expresses his active repugnance to it (p. 86). If we can say, without using words in a non-natural sense, that the distinction of good and evil exists prior to God's choice, that he " ought " to choose good and realise justice, but that it is not impossible for him " otherwise than by preferential affection " to choose evil and do injustice; why can we not similarly conceive of moral choice in man, i.e., without any reference to an external Will ? I am not arguing that Dr. Martineau is wrong in regarding this reference to an authority beyond ourselves as implied in the common notion of moral obligation. According to me, he is wrong not in what he affirms but in what he denies: it is half the truth to say that the moral reason in me which claims authority over my non-rational inclinations is not merely my own reason; but it is no less true and no less important to affirm, with the late Professor Green, that it is my own, and that "it is the very essence of moral duty to be imposed by a man upon himself ". There is another point of some importance in Dr. Martineau's view of our common moral judgments, which appears to me difficult to reconcile with his account of their theological implica- tions. le holds that the "fundamental ethical fact " is the recognition of merit in a certain choice between alternative principles of self-conscious action: and he contrasts strongly the mor-al choice in which the highest of two alternative principles is chosen, from the pr-dential choice in which-as he strangely holds-we yield to the stroongest impulse. " Among our springs of action," he says, " there prevails a moral scale, according to the order of excellence; and a prudential scale, according to the order of strength": and, if I understand the drift of ch. 3 on " Merit and Demerit," 1 he holds that the merit attaching to any particular moral choice is proportional to the discrepancy between the moral and prudential scale, as applied to the particular alternative of conduct between which the choice is made. But he also holds that a " belief in a retributory judgment is insepar- able " from the recognition of moral obligation: and it appears to me that such a belief must inevitably have the effect of obliterat- 1 I ought to say that Dr. Martineau does not expressly make the state- nment in the text as to the proportion betweeli the merit of a moral choice and its divergence from prudential clhoice. But he makes a corresponding statement with regard to demerit ('i where the discrepalncy is greatest between the moral and the prudential order of principles, the guilt is least: and where the discrepancy is least, the sin is greatest"): anid the whole drift of his argument seems to imply that " merit " and " demerit " are to be similarly treated, mrutatis mutctndis.</page><page sequence="12">J. MARTINEAU, lTYPES OF ETHICAL TREORY. 437 ing any divergence that would otherwise show itself between moral and prudential choice of alternatives. We should thus arrive at the paradoxical result that the more intensely and unreservedly a man holds a belief which the moralist declares to be inseparable from moral judgment, the more impossible it is, according to the same moralist, that any merit should attach to his moral choice! So far I have not paid special attention to Dr. Martineau's account of the objects of moral judgment or choice. As it is in this part of his doctrine that he-on the whole, I think, correctly -regards himself as opposed to the " general consensus of modern English opinion," it is important to examine it carefully. I find, however, considerable difficulty in stating the exact issue; because it appears to me that in most of the general discussion which Dr. Martineau bestows on this subject (in ch. 1 of vol. II. book i.)- and especially in that part of it which is directed against my own views-there is a fundamental confusion between two questions which, in my opinion, have very little to do with each other; and which, at any rate, it is quite indispensable to distinguish clearly and discuss separately, as they have to be dealt with by quite different methods. There is, first, a historical or psychogonical question, to which in my Method.s of Ethics I have made a passing reference1: I have stated it as my view that in the normal evolution of man's moral consciousness-both in the individual and in the race-moral judgments are first passed on outward acts, and only later, as the moral consciousness gradually develops and becomes more mature, the paramount imiiportance of the inner principle of action comes to be recognised. This is the view that I have been led to take mainly by studying morality in the early stages of its development, and noting the gradual and slow process by which the distinction between moral and legal rules and the distinction between virtues proper and other excellences have come to be realised; but as the question, ac- cording to me, is one sociologically rather than ethically impor- tant, I have never had occasion to treat it in a systematic way. I entirely agree with Dr. Martineau in holding that in the mature moral consciousness, which alone each of us can make the subject of immediate observation and analysis, this earlier stage of development is altogether past; and we recognise that it is on the " inner principle " of an act that its morality depends. The issue that I am concerned to raise with Dr. Martineau does not I In my first and second editions I devoted a page to this topic in Book III. ch. i. ? 3, and referred to it again en pcassmnt in ch. xii. ? 1 of the same book. As the former passage is quoted by Dr. Martineau for contro- versial purposes, I may point out that the greater part of it was omitted in my third edition: partly because I thought it was to some extent over- stated, partly because I was afraid that its wordingy muight encourage the very confusion pointed out in the text.</page><page sequence="13">438 CRITICAL NOTICES: in any way turn on the antithesis of inner and outer; it turns entirely on the altogether different distinction between intention and motive: and it appears to me that, through his not clearly distinguishing the two antitheses, the greater part of his argu- ment has no relevance to the only question which I regard as ethically important. So far as I can see, he continually uses in chap. 1 the terms " spring " and " principle " of action-and even "motive "-in so vague a way as to include what I call inten- tion as distinct from motive, as well as what I call motive as distinct from intention': and when, in chap. 6, he does come to consider the issue between " motive " and " intention," he only considers it in the paradoxical form in which it is raised by Bentham, who maintains that there isno such thing as a badmotive. Bentham's statement is, I think, capable of defence, after proper explanation2; but I have always avoided it as a misleading paradox: I have always admitted that the common moral sense of mankind judges motives as well as intentions to be good and bad, and mature reflection leads me to approve, broadly and generally, of this judgment, as I find adequate utilitarian justification for it. The position that I maintain, against Dr. Martineau, is that our common moral judgments of right and wrong relate primarily to intentions as distinct from motives; that we do not primarily consider, in approving or disapproving of an act, what effects the agents desired, but what he designed to produce: the effects that he desired may have been purely good, but if other effects that he distinctly foresaw were bad, we do not allow him to relieve himself of responsibility for these latter on the plea that he felt no desire for them. If a man commits perjury to save a benefactor's life, we may admit the goodness of his motive as a mitigation of his blamieworthiness, but that is all: we judge the intended perjury as morally crimninal, though not so criminal as if it had been done from a sordid motive. It is conceivable that the supposed perjurer may have acted not only from a good motive, but with the belief that he was acting rightly; he may have chosen perjury as a less evil than the sacrifice of his benefactor's life; still, the common sense of mankind judges his act to have been wrong, though we admit on reflection that it is in a certain sense right for a man to do what he thinks right, and therefore require for exactness of state- ment to distinguish "subjective" from "objective" rightness; but this distinction as so introduced relates primarily to intention, and not necessarily to motive at all. More commonly such an "altruistic " perjurer would recognise that he was doing wrong; 1 E.g., he speaks of the " mind estimating its own impulses and volitions" (p. 40) as if the two were convertible terms. 2 He means (1) that pleasure is per se good ; and (2) that there is no class of pleasures operating as motives which we could suppress without doing miore harmn than good to society.</page><page sequence="14">J. MARTINEAU, TYPES OF ETHICAL THEORY. 439 and in this case we might say that the desire to do right ought to have prevailed over the desire to save his benefactor; but even in this case I hold that our common moral judgment of the act does not turn primarily on a comparison of motives. For we commonly regard it as a Stoical exaggeration to require a man to act always-or even as much as possible-from a pure desire to do right; we think that in ordinary human life other motives, which yet we admit to be in a sense 'inferior,' norm-ally and properly come in. ience, in many important cases, the ques- tion of motive as distinct from intention is not even raised, in the application of our common notions of particular duties and virtues; what we regard as indispensable-as I have elsewhere said-is merely a settled resolution' to intend or will a certain kind of external effects.' I cannot, therefore, accept Dr. Martineau's view that out ordinary moral judgments are essentially comparisons of motives: such a doctrine is entirely contrary to my own moral experience, and-for the reasons just given-I do not think that it corres- ponds to the common moral experience of mankind. At the same time, as we certainly do take note of motives and judge them to be good and bad, it is interesting to consider how far it is possible to arrange our motives in a scale, exhibiting their gradations of ethical rank, as intuitively determined by our common moral consciousness; and how far such a graduated estimate of motives is capable of giving us practical guidance. The most original part of Dr. Martineau's work consists in his systematic attempt to construct such a scale, as the result of a number of particular moral comparisons. 'He admits that "Ithe whole scale of inner principles is open to survey only to the wisest mind "; and he describes his own classification of motives as a " tentative draft" fro m a pyschological point of view: but he does not show much diffidence as to the universal validity of his ethical valuation of the springs of action classified; and he has no doubt that " however limited the range of our moral consciousness, it would lead us all to the same verdicts, had we all the same segment of the series under our cognisance" 1 " Thus we call a ilan veracious if he has a settled habit of endeavouLr- ing in his speech to produce in the minds of others impressions exactly correspondent to the facts, whatever his motive may be for so doing: whether he is moved solely or mainly bv a regard for dtity or virtuie generally, or by a love of truth in particular, or a sense of the degradation of falsehood, or a conviction that truth-speaking is in the long run the lhot pf.TV in this world, or a belief that it will be rewarded hereafter, or a plXlgl',6 aversion to the inconveniences which nisleading statements cause to other people. Similarly, we attribute Juistice, if a man has a settled habit of weighing diverse claims and fulfillilng them in the ratio of their importance ; Good Faith, if he has a settled habit of strictly keeping express or tacit engagements: and so forth."-(Methods of Ethics, 3rd Edit., book iii., ch.- 2, p. 222.)</page><page sequence="15">440 CRITICAL NOTICE S: The following is his list: and, in examining it, the reader should keep clearly before his mind Dr. Martineau's fundamelntal distinction between the primary springs of action, which " urge men, in the way of unreflecting instinct, to appropriate objects or natural expression," and the secondary springs, " which super- vene upon self-knowledge and experience, and in which the preconception is present of an end gratifying to recognised feeling ". It should also be said that the list includes the " chief composite springs of action," along with those that Dr. Martineau regards as elementary. LOWEST. 1. Secondary Passions :-Censoriousness, Vindictiveness, Suspiciousness. 2. Secondary Organic Propensions :-Love of Ease and Sensual Pleasure. 3. Primary Organic Propensions :-Appetites. 4. Primary Animal Propension :-Spontaneous Activity (unselective). 5. Love of Gain (reflective derivative from Appetite). 6. Secondary Affections (sentimental indtulgence of sympathetic feelings). 7. Primary Passions:-Antipathy, Fear, Resentment. 8. Causal Energy:-Love of Power, or Ambition ; Love of Liberty. 9. Secondary Sentiments :-Love of Culture. 10. Primary Sentiments of Wonder and Admiration. 11. Primary Affections, Parental and Social; with (approximately) Generosity and Gratitude. 12. Primary Affection of Compassioii. 13. Primary Sentiment of Reverence. HIGHEST. I have not space to discuss this list from a psychological point of view: otherwise I should like to ask why the class of " passions" is so unusually restricted, why conjugal affection is omitted, whether wonder can properly be regarded as a definite motive, and whether " censoriousness" and " suspiciousness" are proper terms for desires of malevolent pleasure: and I should venture to criticise throughout Dr. Martineau's distinction of elementary and composite principles. As regards the ethical valuation- which, rather than the psychological analysis, it here concerns us to discuss-my view is that it probably corresponds about as well as any similar general scale would do to the judgments that men commonly pass as to the different elevation of different motives; but that the very effort to reduce these judgments to precision and system brings home to us forcibly how very vague and varying they are, and how impossible a task it is to assign a definite and constant ethical value to each different kind of motive in this general way, without reference to the particular circumstances under which it has arisen, the extent of indulgence that it demands, and the consequences to which this indulgence would lead in any particular case. It is easy to exhibit this difficulty even in the case of the motive that Dr. Martineau places lowest in the scale. When the preacher tells us that the</page><page sequence="16">J. MARTINEAUJ, TYPES OF ETHICAL TEEORY. 441 impulse to obtain pleasure from another's pain is altogether corrupt and abominable, we give a ready assent: but when the jurist tells us that the demand for "vindictive satisfaction " is indispensable to the effective administration of the criminal law, we shrink from branding as illegitimate even the desire of malevolent pleasure, so long as it is restricted to the satisfaction derived from getting a murderer hung, or a swindler brought to penal servitude. A similar reference to consequences is, I con- ceive, usually made, whenever a conflict of motives occurs, sufficiently sustained and important to lead us to conscious comparison and deliberate choice between them: and thus the moral issue inevitably becomes quite different from that which Dr. Martineau describes as normal: the decisive question is not which motive is higher, but which set of f6reseen consequences is on the whole to be preferred. Dr. Martineau fully recognises that "it is the business of another department of ethics" to " estimate the consequences of actions "; but he thinks that this business should be undertaken " after settlement of the rank of motives". It appears to me, however, that in the very cases he selects to prove his theory, the judgment of common sense as to the mrotive that ought to prevail is manifestly determined by a broad consideration of the alternative courses of conduct to which the conflicting motives prompt. Thus, so far as it is true that " the conscience says to every one, ' Do not eat till you are hungry and stop when you are hungry no more'" it is not, I venture to think, because a "regulative right is clearly vested in primary instinctive needs, relatively to their secondaries," but because experience has shown that to seek the gratification of the palate apart from the satisfaction of hunger is generally danlgerous to physical wellbeing; and it is in view of this danger that the conscience operates. If we condemn " a ship captain," who, " caught in a fog off a lee shore, neglects, through indolence and love of ease, to slacken speed and take cautious soundings and open his steam-whistle," it is not because we intuitively discern fear to be a higher motive than love of ease, but because the consequences disregarded are judged to be indefinitely more important than the gratification obtained: if we took a case in which fear was not similarly sustained by prudence, our judgment would certainly be different. If, again, in a conflict between resentment and the desire of sympathetic pleasure, we think the fornmer motive should prevail, it is only so far as we regard the resentment as being-to use Dr. Martineau's words-" well-grounded" and " the natural de- fence of Right among men ": we condemn the parent whose symnpathy prevents him from punishing his children sufficiently, not on account of the comparative lowness of his motive, but in view of the bad effects on the training of the child. And similarly in other cases. I have only space just to notice the discussion of "Hetero-</page><page sequence="17">442 CRITICAL NOTICES: psychological" theories that occupies the second half of Dr. Martineau's second volume. In the criticism of " Utilitarian Hedonism'" with which it commences, the writer is traversing a ground now somewhat worn, and it is hardly surprising that he should not find much to say that is at once new and true: but many of his points are well-chosen, and his polemical rhetoric is often very effective. There is more freshness of interest, with no less rhetorical effectiveness, in the criticism of Mr. Spencer and Mr. Stephen-mainly of the former-which follows under the title of "Hedonism with Evolution ". The discussion of the " Dianoetic" theories of Cudworth, Clarke and Price appears to me not quite up to Dr. Martineau's ordinary level in penetration and appreciativeness: and after reading it I am quite unable to understand how he can speak of himself as having " approxi- mately adopted" the theory of Kant: since among English writers Clarke and Price certainly approach most closely to Kant's ethical position, and Dr. Martineau's arguments against the place that the latter writer assigns to the Reason must, I con- ceive, be valid against Kant,. if they have any validity at all. On the other hand, the account of Hutcheson's system which con- cludes the volume-though not, in my opinion, free from serious misunderstandings'--is sympathetic, careful and interesting. HI.
