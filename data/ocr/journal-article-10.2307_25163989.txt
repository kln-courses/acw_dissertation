INTRODUCTION During the last two or three decades the use of mountain areas for recreation has intensified and at the same time the environmental awareness movement has experienced widespread growth and increased political influence. These two factors are by no means complementary, nor are they necessarily compatible. It has long been recognized, how ever, that recreation and tourism impart an economic value to remote and hitherto little used mountain regions that today frequently exceeds the combined value of all other possible uses, including extraction of minerals, timber, and the development of water resources. This has resulted in a number of serious land-use conflicts and has compounded the already complex problem of alternate resource-use evaluation.</page><page sequence="2">338 / Mountain Research and Development It is obvious that multiple resource use of a single moun tain region produces incompatibilities between renewable and non-renewable resource extraction on the one hand and recreational use, with an associated infrastructure, on the other. Moreover, recreation itself takes on many forms which themselves are often mutually incompatible. Another important consideration is preservation of the genepool, a need now widely recognized through the long-term efforts of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and the Unesco Pro gramme on Man and the Biosphere (MAB) initiated in 1971. In the United States of America the concept of wilder ness emerged from the philosophy of John Muir and the beginnings of the Sierra Club. However, it achieved a special status with passage by Congress of the Wilderness Act in September 1964. Since then many wilderness areas have been formally designated, especially in the mountain ous regions of the West. This produced many conflicts be tween industry and recreation and conservation and brought into sharper focus the need for defining wilder ness and for developing management techniques to pre serve wilderness in such a way that the legal definition and interpretation deriving from the wording of the Wilder ness Act, is maintained. The Act defines wilderness as". . . an area where the earth and its community of life are un trammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain." This concept is discussed more fully by Baumgartner (1983, in press). The Indian Peaks Wilderness Act was signed into law by President Jimmy Carter in October 1978, after a long political struggle. The area comprises 294 km2 (73,000 acres) of the Colorado Front Range on both sides of the Continental Divide between Rollins Pass (latitude 39? 56' North) and the southern boundary of Rocky Mountain Na tional Park (latitude 40? 10' North). Contiguous territory to west, east, and south falls largely within U.S. Forest Service Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests, and includes many small enclosures of private land. Its east-cen tral section is penetrated by a significant salient that encom passes the privately-owned City of Boulder Watershed, and the publicly-owned Niwot Ridge Biosphere Reserve. The latter, also a research natural area, was formally cited as a Biosphere Reserve by Unesco and the U.S. Department of State in April 1979. Boundaries of these administrative units are shown on Figure 1 and on the Shaded Relief Map (folded-in). It was in 1976, while political pressure for designation of the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area was intensifying, that the plan for production of an environmental atlas was ini tiated. Under a grant from the National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) the University of Colorado Figure 1. Administrative boundaries of the Indian Peaks section of the Colorado Front Range. The Niwot Ridge Biosphere Re serve (A) and the City of Boulder Watershed (B) heavily indent the eastern mid-section of the Wilderness Area. at Boulder had begun to examine the possibilities of apply ing remote-sensing techniques to the study of mountain land-use problems. During the first five years of the project emphasis was placed on studies of mountain hazards, such as avalanches, mudflows, and landslides, in terms of land use planning (Bovis, 1977; Ives and Bovis, 1978; I ves and Krebs, 1978; Ives and Plam, 1980; Dow et ai, 1981; Kien holz and Bichsei, 1982). During the second half of the project (1976-1982) emphasis was placed on definition and production of the manuscript for an environmental atlas. It was hoped that the preparation process would be in time to assist with delineation of the proposed wilderness area boundaries and, subsequently, the completed atlas, or its component parts, would aid in the development of wilder ness management policies and also prove an asset for fur thering education about the nature of the area itself. This paper is intended as an introduction to the Envi ronmental Atlas. It will describe the atlas format, discuss the basis for inclusion of some of its special components, and indicate some of its more pragmatic potential uses. Finally, it will serve to introduce one of the atlas plates, the Shaded Relief Map, scale 1:50,000 (folded-in), and pro vide the basis for subsequent papers dealing with individual thematic maps from the atlas. THE INDIAN PEAKS SECTION OF THE COLORADO FRONT RANGE1 The Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains may be arbitrarily defined as a north-south trending massif 1This section has been adapted from Ives (ed.), 1980, Introduction, pp. 1-8. that extends southward some 150 km from the Wyoming State Line to where it merges with the complex highland centred on Mount Evans and overlooking South Park (Figure 2).

The western limit is more diffuse, demarcated in part by North Park and Winter Park. The Indian Peaks section forms the middle tract between Rollins Pass and Rocky Mountain National Park. It is so named because many of its prominent peaks honour American Indian nations that played an important role in the turbulent history of the Old West. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate in simplified form the areal and cross-sectional appearance of the region. Geologically the Front Range is framed by a series of narrow sedimentary formations that have produced cuestas and hogbacks on the east, and tectonic depressions, also underlain by sediments, on the west. The main bulk of the range is composed of a core of Precambrian acidic intru sives, themselves intruded by acidic Tertiary plu tons. Maximum relief from the High Plains to the Continental Divide is about 2,500 m. One of the most striking features of the Front Range is its almost north-south trending crest line, along which maximum altitudes range between 3,800 and 4,115 m. Viewed from a low angle it appears to slope off rather gendy toward the east as a series of broad benches (belts of accordant summits and ridge flats) that have been described as remnants of former erosion surfaces. This rela tively gentle east slope is dissected at right angles to the crestline by a succession of deep trenches formed initially by river erosion during uplift of the range. Their upper reaches have been modified subsequently by glacial ero sion that occurred during Late Cenozoic times (for discus sions of glacial geology see: Benedict, 1973; Birkeland, 1973; Madole, 1976a, 1976b; Clarke, 1980). The valley down-cutting has produced a fretwork of deep, U-shaped troughs and glacial cirques that have penetrated far into the heart of the main uplift so as to leave, in places, a nar row and precipitous rockwall as the Continental Divide. This feature is especially well developed between Pawnee Pass and the Arapaho Peaks (see Shaded Relief Map). The east-west secondary interfluves, equally precipitous near the Divide, graduate to broad, gently rolling ridges within a few kilometres, and extend below timberline at about 3,350 m. The lowest sections of the intervening valleys oc cur as spectacular gorges before their streams debouch onto the High Plains. Of the east-west trending ridges of the east slope, Niwot Ridge, for the most part within the Biosphere Reserve, is the longest and most prominent, extending a distance of 9 km from the Divide at Navajo Peak (4,087 m) to Bald, or Niwot,1 Mountain (3,490 m). The west slope drops precipitously from the Divide to the large water bodies of Lake Granby, Monarch Lake, and Grand Lake, although several broad and gentle passes (Arapaho, Pawnee, and Buchanan) intervene and provide easy walking access across the range. The wilderness area generally lies above the 3,000 m contour except in the ex treme northwest where the Arapaho and Buchanan creeks fall below 2,550 m prior to entering Monarch Lake. The area has two major sets of contrasting landscape assemblages, one produced by glacial erosion and subse 1 Alternate name, not shown on Shaded Relief Map. Figure 4.

This juxtaposition of rugged, sharp, alpine terrain and more gently sloping land enhances its attractiveness for the moderately experienced summer sea son hiker and backpacker. Another important control on the overall physique of the area is the prevailing westerly wind that is especially strong in winter (Barry, 1973). Thus drifting snow, snow accumu lation, and topographic control of glacier mass balance pro cesses (Alford, 1973; Johnson, 1979), have combined to ensure that most of the tiny present-day cirque glaciers oc cur on the east side of the Divide, and most of the cirque forms have a predominandy easterly orientation. The same wind-topographic-snowdrift relationship dominates the dis position of many of the perennial and late-lying snowbanks which, in turn, exert a strong control on the distribution of vegetation and animal populations. After the physical relief of a mountain area, perhaps the next most noticeable characteristic for the visitor is the vegetation cover and its climatic controls. Seen from the air above the eastern margins of Boulder, the westward rise of land displays a series of sub-parallel vegetation belts, strongly influenced by the progressive shift in local climate with increasing altitude. The regional climate of the area can best be described as having a mid-latitude interior con tinental semi-arid regime, that of the short-grass prairie of the High Plains. The mountain climatic belts are alti tudinal variants of this regional climate, and the controlling factors are a lowering of air temperatures and an increase in precipitation with altitude. The greater amount of pre</page><page sequence="5">J. Iv?s AND V. Dow / 341 cipitation provides sufficient moisture for vigorous forest growth until at extreme altitudes temperature controls dominate a change to alpine herbs and shrubs. Thus the proportion of solid to liquid precipitation increases with altitude, as does the total annual precipitation (from about 380 to 1,200 mm of water), and the mean temperature of each of the four distinct seasons decreases. The length of the growing season, of critical importance to plant species selection and performance, also decreases with altitude. Thus four major ecosystems can be readily recognized above the short-grass prairie and the lower treeline (Marr, 1967): the colline belt, with ponderosa pine and Douglas fir as dominants; the lower montane forest; the upper mon tane forest; and the alpine tundra. Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and aspen (Populus tremuloides), also characteristic sub-dominants of the two upper forest belts, are consid ered as successional after fire or human disturbance. Tim berline, defined as the upper limit of tall, symmetrical, closely-spaced trees, occurs at about 3,350 m, with tree line, or species limit, at about 3,500 m, with local varia tions due to a variety of factors. This transition from tim berline to treeline, the so-called forest-alpine tundra eco tone, or subalpine belt (L?ve, 1969) is one of the most im pressive vegetation boundaries on earth. Its unique char acteristics, with ancient, wind-deformed prostrate forms, have made it of special attraction to wilderness area users, and hence, in places, subject to an excessive degree of human impact (Figure 5). Above timberline, major changes in the micro-topogra phy and geomorphic processes become apparent. Small patches of permafrost begin to occur at about 3,450 m (Iv?s and Fahey, 1973); in sheltered places snowbanks last throughout the summer (Thorn, 1976), and periglacial ter races, needle-ice patterns, and relict and subactual pat terned ground, indicate a rapid increase in climatic severity (Benedict, 1970a). A myriad of tundra plant associations dominate the surface, showing rapid variation over short distances influenced by topography and snow accumula tion patterns (Kom?rkov? and Webber, 1978). Finally, at the higher levels, rock faces, talus slopes, rock glaciers, small cirque glaciers, and knife-edged ridges predominate and the observer enters the true alpine landscape, or Hochgebirge, as defined by Carl Troll (1972). It is upon this natural system that man has begun to leave an increasingly heavy stamp. Palaeo-Indian game drive walls dating back to at least 7,000 years ago are scat tered across the area above timberline (Benedict, 1970b; Husted, 1974), but overall impact was negligible before European penetration. Much more recently hunter and trapper left a minimum indication of their former presence. In the latter part of the last century the prospector and miner literally dug up sections of the surface, and their need for lumber and firewood resulted in the first major impacts on the forests. This has left an impoverished forest cover over large areas and secondary growth after forest fire and Figure 5. The upper part of the forest-alpine tundra ecotone within the City of Boulder Watershed. The steep pyramid on the skyline is Navajo Peak (4,087 m). Early October 1968. logging, indicated by extensive stands of lodgepole pine and aspen, young dense spruce-fir stands and, at the high est levels, burn scars nearly 100 years old where there is little regrowth today. Recreational use is now changing the landscape. This includes: roads and permanent and vacation homes at lower elevations close to the plains; roads, foot trails, and designated campgrounds at middle elevations; and trails, trampled areas, camp-fire scars, and torn greenwood at the higher levels in the wilderness area. These present day uses are supplemented by hunting, firewood collect ing, water diversions, and the re-establishment of many of the original mining towns, mostly as dormitory suburbs for Denver and Boulder. Land ownership patterns are complex and will progres sively differentiate a series of land-use regions as the level of human use heightens. Recreation, because of the many past and recent policy decisions, is destined to be the pre dominant land use of the Front Range as a whole. It can be shown, however, that even so-called protected areas, such as wilderness areas from which mechanized transport is excluded, can be extensively damaged, if not destroyed, by too many hiking boots, campers, and camp-fires. It is doubtful today whether some tracts of the actual wilder ness area warrant the definition "untrammeled by man." Nevertheless, the overall area remains a priceless natural heritage and the worthy basis for development of an environmental atlas. ATLAS PHILOSOPHY The Indian Peaks section of the Colorado Front Range lies within very easy access of the so-called "Front Range urban corridor." The rapidly expanding urban population of the cities of Colorado Springs, Denver, Boulder, and</page><page sequence="6">342 / Mountain Research and Development Fort Collins, already exceeding two million, and a large influx of tourists, can reach the wilderness area boundary at several points by car within one to two hours; can tra verse on foot to the Continental Divide within another two or three hours; and can cross the entire area within a sin gle day, or at most, two days. Under these circumstances human impact pressures, without regulation, will quickly result in accelerating environmental deterioration such that preservation of natural wilderness will become impossible. Regulation, or management, on first inspection, is alien to the very concept of wilderness experience. But effective management has become an imperative. It will require a high level of understanding of social values and visitor be havioural patterns, as well as a much fuller knowledge of the structure and functioning of the ecosystems that make up the wilderness area. Additionally, user group percep tions of other user groups and their impacts, as well as their perceptions of wilderness itself, need to be more fully studied. The broad concept of producing an atlas of this complex high mountain region involves meeting the challenge of describing its personality through study of the combined array of satellite imagery, conventional air photographs, thematic maps, and fieldwork, and the existing accumu lated scientific knowledge of the area. Thus, it was pro posed to portray the physique of the Indian Peaks area, or rather its landschaft, in the sense of German geographical philosophy that received widespread attention amongst German geographers in the late nineteenth and early twen tieth century. Landschaftskunde (landscape science) was pro posed as a means of achieving a more balanced understand ing of the interrelations of objects within specific areas. Thus attention is focused on the overall appearance of the landscape. This means much more than a physical descrip tion of an area; it embraces the totality of abiotic and biotic (including human) interrelationships and how they are per ceived by man. This old concept is especially useful for study of the mountains of the American West now that forces of development and conservation are pitted against each other. The immediate reasons behind the decision to attempt the production of such an atlas were as follows: 1. availability of a large amount of scientific data and knowledge of the Front Range deriving from research at the University of Colorado and other institutions during the last fifty years, and, in particular work emanating from the Mountain Research Station, situated at 2,850 m on the eastern edge of the wilderness area. 2. the fact that in 1976 negotiations with the U.S. For est Service, Unesco, and Congressman Timothy E. Wirth's Citizens Committee for the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area were leading toward declaration of Niwot Ridge as a M AB Biosphere Reserve. It was anticipated that this in turn would provide an oppor tunity for testing the idea that a wilderness area and a specialized research area in contiguity should and could be mutually beneficial. 3. the realization that, due to the acceleration of recrea tional use, an atlas, if well conceived and adequately executed, could, in the initial process of wilderness designation, contribute significantly to boundary de marcation and, in the longer term, aid in the devel opment of intelligent management policies. 4. the understanding that an atlas could, either directly, or indirectly through publications derived from it, help educate the potential user and so influence his perceptions of, and behaviour toward, this particular wilderness area and the wilderness concept in general. The number of visitors to the Wilderness Area is being partially controlled already by a limitation of parking places at the major access points. In the future a policy to rigor ously limit access may be required. This is an arbitrary or purely empirical system for control and it was hoped that the atlas project would aid the development of a more rational approach based upon justifiable needs. It was also envisaged that it would provide a benchmark against which to determine the magnitude and trends of visitor impacts and thus form a basis for adjustment of access control and the development of visitor zoning policies in the future. Perhaps even more important, it was conceived as being able to provide a graphic and intellectually arguable means of demonstrating why any such controls would be neces sary. ATLAS CONTENT Fourteen major themes constitute the core of the atlas and are the basis for individual atlas plates. Most of these were produced by a single author as part of a master's or doctoral dissertation, although in some instances there is joint authorship. Several plates will be prepared for publi cation in future issues of Mountain Research and Development; the next one being scheduled is The Visual Landscape (Baum gartner, 1983). Each map will be the central component of a separate chapter which will include text and illustra tions. The text will describe the process of research and map construction and will analyse the map content both in terms of its contribution to knowledge and as an aid to mountain wilderness management. Thus each atlas com ponent is intended to stand alone. This is due to financial considerations and also in order to achieve the widest possi ble circulation of the research results as they become avail able. The atlas, therefore, will consist of the individual thematic chapters, an introductory chapter, and a substan tial concluding section that will assess both the atlas as a whole and its potential for helping resolve mountain wilder ness area management problems. The atlas will consider also the areas adjacent to the Indian Peaks Wilderness: the Niwot Ridge Biosphere Reserve, the City of Boulder Watershed, those parts of Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests not within the wilderness area, and Rocky Moun tain National Park.</page><page sequence="7">J.

THE SHADED RELIEF MAP The introductory atlas plate is a graphic representation of the study area by means of relief shading. The primary topographic base is the United States Geological Survey (USGS) 1:24,000 contour maps originally triangulated in the early 1900s and subject to periodic correction, primar ily to record the progressive addition of human develop ment. The contour interval is 40 feet, and the national geodetic vertical datum was established in 1929. The most recent topographic mapping has been based on photogram metric methods from air photographs taken in 1953. The latest photo-revision was completed in 1978. These maps show forest cover in green, although the accuracy, espe cially at high altitudes, varies considerably from one map sheet to another. The overall topographical accuracy, as portrayed by the contours, is not comparable, for instance, to the 1:25,000 Swiss maps produced by Bundesamt f?r Landestopographie der Schweiz, Wabern-Bern (Swiss Fed eral Office of Topography, Berne). After a reduction from 1:24,000 to 1:50,000 (see below) the disparity between scale and accuracy is reduced to a more than acceptable level. Used with air photographs, landsat images, and ortho photographs, the 1:24,000 topographic maps provided the base sheets for air photograph interpretation and fieldwork compilation throughout the atlas project. It was decided that the most suitable basic scale for the atlas would be 1:50,000. This enabled compilation from the whole, or parts, of eight 1:24,000 map sheets, onto a single sheet of manageable proportions (60 x 96 cm). It was fortunate that a County Map Series at the 1:50,000 scale was being produced by the combined efforts of USGS and the Colorado Division of Planning, Department of Local Affairs. Both agencies provided outstanding support which enabled the atlas project to obtain the 1:50,000 base map. It was produced by simple reduction and compilation from the 1:24,000 series, and had an 80-foot contour interval, so it was decided to redraw the contours to a metric scale of 25-metre interval for the atlas project. The spacing of the redrawn contours appeared too dense in steeper areas at the 1:50,000 scale and the contour interval was increased to 50 metres. The pronounced easterly orientation of cirques and the north-south simplicity in trend of the Continental Divide make the application of relief shading very effective. It was fortunate that the Bundesamt f?r Landestopographie der Schweiz (Swiss Federal Office of Topography, Berne) was able to undertake the artwork for the shaded relief; the following description has been provided by them and trans lated by Roland Baumgartner. Preparation of the Shaded Relief The relief of an area, including differences in exposure, slope geometry, and elevation, can be portrayed in map form in several ways. One approach is the use of contours, which today are produced photogrammetrically using stereoscopic air photographs. With this method, however, especially for the layman, it is difficult to obtain a good overview of the topography. With relief shading it is pos sible to display hills and mountains as real elevations in the sense that a three-dimensional impression can be simu lated on a flat sheet of paper. The user can sense the relief of a whole region without exhaustive study of the contours. Edges, round forms, steep, or less steep, terrain, and tran sitions must be as accurate as that of the contour system. The multitude of small details that must be shown charac terize an area's relief. For the Indian Peaks area map the Swiss method of shading with a light source (sun) coming from the north west was used. Through the convention of simulating the position of the sun shining at a 45? angle from the upper left corner of the map (north-oriented maps) the best re sults are obtained. There is an additional advantage of adopting this convention. If the cartographer is working with his right hand, having the light source at his upper left provides ideal working conditions since shade cast on the map sheet by his hand does not hinder his work (this would not be the case for a left-handed cartographer, of</page><page sequence="8">344 / Mountain Research and Development course). In addition, local changes in position of the light source can improve the relief impression in situations where the topographic trend would otherwise prove unfavourable. Such circumstances occurred quite frequently and over sig nificant areas of the Indian Peaks map. The entire Arapaho Creek valley as well as the Fourth of July valley (North Fork, Middle Boulder Creek) required a change in light source. For the Arapaho Creek valley, for instance, the light source has been moved slightly toward the west. Be cause the valley trends southeast-to-northwest each valley side would otherwise receive the same amount of shade (or light) and the overall relief impression would have been flat. Nevertheless, the contour base remains unchanged so that topographic accuracy is maintained. The artist at the Bundesamt f?r Landestopographie der Schweiz works on bromine-silver paper which is mounted on an aluminium plate. The contour lines and drainage features are copied onto this base in a very light colour: thus all relevant information is on the artwork sheet. The working devices for shading include the aerograph (a preci sion spray pistol), pencil (small brush), and ink. It is a dif ficult task to accentuate the relief through spraying and painting, especially the differences in exposure. "Light" areas must be enlarged whereas "dark" areas must be dark ened because only approximately 15 percent of the black colour impression (shade) is retained following the photo graphic reduction and printing processes. The grey colour, which is usually used for printing the shade (as on the Indian Peaks map) gives even less of a dark tone. In addi tion, dark-shaded hillsides sloping down onto a plain be come increasingly lighter toward the foot of the slope. This causes a "lower-plain-impression." For the highest eleva tions the "high-alpine-impression" is achieved by intensi fying the differences between light and dark. This contrast is increased to its maximum for the highest peaks. The original shaded artwork is put onto film through a sophisticated screening process. The screen divides the artwork into an array of small dots which give the shade impression and which are needed for the printing process ("loss" of dark tone). This positive film is the base sheet for the printer from which a grey-plate is produced. The Indian Peaks Shaded Relief Map presented considerable difficulty for the printer because the darkness as well as the size of the single dots (boldness) had to be carefully balanced with the "light" areas that were printed in pale yellow. For the Swiss national topographic sheets a dark grey is used to print the shading effect. On this map use was made of Pant one 431C. The production of the "light-side" (sunny side) is a rela tively simple procedure. The screened negative of the shade (grey) is printed in yellow. Through the combination of the grey and the yellow a better "hypsometric impression" is achieved. Finally, while all colour maps require high ac curacy of registration this is especially true for shaded relief maps. Map Production Once the shaded relief artwork was received it was tempting to produce simple xerox copies in order to obtain a first impression of whether or not the final map would be effective. A small portion of this is reproduced as Figure 6 to demonstrate the three-dimensional effect so achieved. The area represented in Figure 6 includes a four kilometre section of the Divide between South Arapaho Peak and Navajo Peak (compare with bottom left coloured photograph on the Shaded Relief Map). It was then de cided that the Shaded Relief Map should not be used solely as part of the atlas production. Considering that Wilder ness Area use has exceeded 150,000 person-visits (over night) during the summer season in recent years, and that full topographic map coverage requires parts of eight of the standard USGS map sheets, it was decided to broaden the objectives of the project to produce a large number of copies of the final map for sale to Wilderness Area users. Thus 20,000 copies were printed by Rand McNally In corporated, 2,000 being put aside for the atlas, 1,500 being required for distribution with this paper and Mountain Re search and Development, and the remainder for sale to the public (3,000 of which were not folded). The production of the Shaded Relief Map provided the base for all the other thematic adas maps although, to avoid colour confusion, the shaded relief is omitted from most of them. For the same reason, and because there is a vege tation map in production, the traditional forest green was not added to the Shaded Relief Map. However, because of its intended use by hikers, trails, road-heads, designated camp and picnic sites, administrative boundaries, and other anthropomorphic features have been added. A compromise has been attempted in reducing the total number of place names, spot heights, and secondary anthropomorphic fea tures. This also relates to a desire to retain as much em phasis as possible on the landforms. SOME IMMEDIATE USES The first drafts of several of the atlas plates were being compiled during the working period of a National Parks Service-U.S. Forest Service boundary study group for Rocky Mountain National Park (cf. final report, 1979). The Indian Peaks Environmental Atlas group, along with other groups and individuals, was invited to participate. Some of the immediate contributions were as follows: Northwestern Boundary of the Wilderness Area: From the Monarch Lake access point (see Shaded Relief Map) one of the major wilderness area valleys runs southeastward and provides access across Arapaho Pass at 3,629 m into the valley of the North Fork of Middle Boulder Creek and the Fourth of July Campground. This is the Arapaho Creek valley. It is comparatively well-forested and the possibil ity of its exclusion from the wilderness area and its avail ability for commercial lumbering was discussed. While ava lanche hazard had not been widely recognized in the pro posed wilderness area at that time, especially below tim berline (M. Plam, pers. comm., 1978), work on the atlas avalanche hazard plate indicated a potential problem. Sev</page><page sequence="9">J. Ives and V. Dow / 345 Figure 6. A section of the shaded relief and initial contour base map (with 40-foot contour interval) reproduced from a xerox copy of the original Swiss artwork. The prominent summit in the south is North Arapaho Peak with Navajo Peak in the north. The in tensely glaciated area along the Continental Divide is especially well displayed. The too closely-spaced contours merge on steep slopes and also break down optically when overlaid by the shaded relief map for xerox reproduction. The overall effect is more dramatic, yet provides less clarity of detail compared to the final printed map. eral avalanche paths (Figure 7) had been identified; their starting zones were high on the valley sides above timber line, but their run-out zones extended to, and across, Arapaho Creek. It was realized that disturbance of the natural forest cover in this valley could significantly in crease avalanche incidence and render winter access dan gerous. As a consequence the northwestern boundary was drawn to include the entire valley within the proposed wilderness area and the prospect of commercial lumber ing in an area of very slow natural regeneration eliminated. General Boundary Designation: Before final demarcation of the administrative boundaries, as shown on the Shaded Re lief Map, was complete, physical, vegetational, human im pact components, and the local political realities were assessed and balanced one against another. The availability of draft maps of vegetation, soils, human impacts, surfi</page><page sequence="10">346 / Mountain Research and Development Figure 7.

Development of Wilderness Area Management Regulations: One of the most severe problems facing the U.S. Forest Serv ice District and Regional staff under existing condi tions?budget reductions and reduced personnel and in creased recreational use ?is enforcement of regulations once they are developed. It is generally understood that, wherever possible, the provision of rational explanations in support of any new regulations will facilitate user re sponse. The logic behind this is that a large proportion of wilderness area users are much more likely to comply with, and even police voluntarily, regulations that have a sound, rational basis. Two hypothetical examples are given to illustrate this ? hypothetical because they entail possible future reg ulations rather than actual regulations or even U.S. Forest Service intent. The first relates to the forest-alpine tundra ecotone: here in attractive areas with small lakes an increase in camping has led to a large number of fire pits and exten sive cutting of greenwood from wind-deformed trees or elfin wood (see coloured photograph on Shaded Relief Map). Research associated with production of the Vegetation Map (Ives, 1978; Hansen-Bristow, 1981; Ives and Hansen Bristow, 1983; Hansen-Bristow, 1983) has led to the con clusions: (1) that the upper sub-belt of the forest-alpine Figure 8. The forest-alpine tundra ecotone on the west side of the Continental Divide offers lush meadows amidst park-like areas of scattered trees, together with distant views of high mountains. Wind deformation of trees is not nearly so pronounced as on the east slope since the prevailing wind blows up-slope from the forest onto the alpine tundra. View taken from the trail below Buchanan Pass into Thunderbolt Creek valley toward the southwest. July 1979. tundra ecotone is not generally reproducing sexually; (2) the individual prostrate elfin-wood forms may be more than 1,000 years old and that treeline (or species limit) may have been established during a period of more favourable cli mate several thousand years ago. From this it is postulated that destruction of these trees for camp-fire fuel will cause local lowering of treeline with no immediate prospect of either natural or artificial re-establishment. Thus, in the future, a complete ban on camp-fires in this belt may be advisable and rationality of the regulation would likely be accepted by a high proportion of users (Figure 8). A second example is drawn from the Human Impact Map and research associated with it (A. Forrest Ketchin, pers. comm., 1982). Several of the preferred camping areas in the main valleys of the Wilderness Area have been so heavily used that soil compaction, damage to trees, tram pling of vegetation, and associated processes have resulted in extensive environmental degradation. This is graphically demonstrated on the Human Impact Map and provides a strongly justified basis for possible closure of selected areas, either temporarily or permanently. CONCLUSION With passage of the India Peaks Wilderness Act in October 1978, the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area Citi zens Committee was disbanded on the assumption that its task was completed. Since that time it has been realized that creation of a wilderness area is a beginning, not an end. The exclusion of mechanized equipment and the gen</page><page sequence="11">J. Ives AND V. Dow / 347 eral protection afforded by wilderness area status, will not compensate for the accelerating wear and tear from increas ingly heavy recreational use. An Indian Peaks Wilderness Area Working Group has now been established composed of many local interest groups and individuals and its pur pose is to work with and advise the U.S. Forest Service on problems and management options associated with operation of the Wilderness Area. As the individual com ponents of the environmental atlas become available in published form it is hoped that the tasks of this Working Group will be facilitated. However, the longer range goals of the atlas project will require publication of the completed atlas. These include contributing to the general under standing of the dynamics of mountain wilderness and iden tification of additional research needs so that the learning and educational process can expand and a better balance be struck between recreational use and conservation. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The work outlined in this paper was made possible by grant NASA-PY No. NGL-06-003-200 from the U.S. Na tional Aeronautical and Space Administration to the senior author. Individuals, too numerous to mention by name, have made many important contributions, the principal ones being acknowledged in the text to the Shaded Relief Map itself. The fieldwork and most of the remote sensing and map compilation was undertaken when the atlas group was based at the University of Colorado Mountain Re search Station. The senior author developed and managed the project while director of the University's Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, 1967 to 1979. The Environ mental Atlas as a whole, and this paper and map in par ticular, is a contribution to the Unesco Man and the Bio sphere (MAB) Programme and United States MAB Na tional Committee, Directorate 6A, study of the impact of human activities on temperate and tropical mountain eco systems. It is also a contribution to the International Geo graphical Union Commission on Mountain Geoecology.

It is a boon because it was designated a wilderness area by President Jimmy Carter in Oc tober 1978, thereby providing the several million people of the "Front Range Corridor" with a most accessible high country recreation area protected from the impingements of twentieth century tech nology. But it is a burden by that same token of easy access, to Coloradans and visitors alike, since it is possible to trample a wilderness area to death by use of climbing boots and tent pegs alone, without the aid of mechanical devices. Popularity can change the character of landscape as easily as it can that of a person, with beneficial or devastating results. The issue, of course, will be decided through effective management and user response. But in a democratic society management policies must inevitably be influenced by that time-honored recourse to providing the greatest range of benefits to the largest possible number of people. In this sense the present manager of the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area is the United States Forest Service. Wise management will not only depend upon available financial resources, but even more upon careful assessment of available knowledge relating both to the personality, or dynamics, of the moun tain landscape, and to the desires and perceptions of those who seek to use it. And the users are divisi ble into different groups with differing, and some times conflicting, objectives. It is in part to assist in the urgently needed generation of management wisdom that this shaded relief map has been pub lished.

This decade-long project, of course, has involved many people, too numerous to mention here. A great proportion of the work was completed by suc cessive teams of graduate students, their contribu tions leading to individual masters and doctoral dissertations. Some individuals, however, cannot go unrecognized. First, Mr. Joseph Vitale of NASA served as grant monitor. Without his irrascible, in tensely human, sometimes sharp and sometimes benign criticism and challenge, nothing would have been accomplished. Dr. Michael J. Bovis served as full-time project coordinator during the San Juan years; Dr. Hans Kienholz acted as natural hazards advisor, 1977-1978; and Mr. Roland Baumgartner as atlas coordinator, 1978-1980. Roland's drive and enthusiasm effectively caused the atlas to take shape. Dr. A.W. K?chler provided invaluable con sulting services on cartography and vegetation mapping, and our academic colleagues, Professor Roger G. Barry and Dr. Misha Plam, contributed in numerous ways and served as sometime co principal investigators with the senior author. The fieldwork, and most of the remote sensing and map compilation, was performed during that fortunate time when the University of Colorado Mountain Research Station provided the year round home for the project. The senior author developed and managed the project while director of the University's Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, 1967 to 1979. The junior author served as atlas cartographer and designer both as full-time research staff member and graduate student. MAP CONTENT A shaded relief map of this quality is not easily achieved.

The germ for the map was the well-recog nized need for a reliable, clean, appropriate scale, topographical base upon which to portray the vari ous landscape elements that together comprise the physical component of the Indian Peaks mystique. The wilderness area itself, while identified as the principal "target," needed something of the sur rounding territory to place it in proper context. Thus a borderland sliver of Rocky Mountain Na tional Park was encompassed, together with adja cent tracts of Arapahoe and Roosevelt national for ests and intermingling private land. Of special im portance are the research areas of the City of Boul der Watershed and the Niwot Ridge (Unesco) Bio sphere Reserve and the Mountain Research Station. Inclusion of the foregoing tracts of land, and concern for a sheet of paper of such a size as to be handled conveniently, predicted the mapping scale of 1:50,000. Thus, using the United States Geologi cal Survey reconstructions of the relevant county maps, we were able to compile a metric base with a 50-meter contour interval. The contours were com pletely redrawn and the final product was placed in the hands of The Swiss Federal Topographic Survey, world-renowned specialists in the art and science of shaded relief. With a light source from the northwest, it was realized immediately that our wilderness area and adjacent territory had been coordinated about latitude 40 degrees N., longi tude 105 degrees W. and shaped by the forces of nature as if to prove the beauty and effectiveness of the shaded relief technique. It remained for Rand McNally and Company to provide the professional touch of map printer to complement the artistry of the Swiss negative.
