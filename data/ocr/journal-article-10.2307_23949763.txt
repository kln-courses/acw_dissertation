<plain_text><page sequence="1">578 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES THE GREEK TRANSLATORS OF THE PROPHETICAL BOOKS. In preceding numbers of the Journal1 I have given reasons for believing that the task of translating the books of Jeremiah and Ezekiel into Greek was in each case divided between two translators. The striking fact that the break in each book comes at nearly the halfway point suggested that this division of labour was the result of the collabora tion of two contemporary translators. It must, however, be admitted that another explanation is not impossible, namely that the earliest Greek version of both books was an incomplete one, which was afterwards supplemented by another worker. The question as to which of these views is correct could only be decided by the discovery of some sure linguistical criteria for distinguishing a Greek translation made in the second century B.C. from a translation belonging to one of the succeeding centuries. May we equate any of the four hands which we have traced in these two books? The second hand in Jeremiah (Jer. β) and the second hand in Ezekiel (Ez. β) each present certain distinctive features of their own, and can certainly not be equated, nor (apart from the reappearance of Jer. β in the book of Baruch) is there any trace of either of these two hands elsewhere in the prophetical books of the Greek Bible. But the earlier portion of the Greek Jeremiah (Jer. a) and the remaining portion of Ezekiel (Ez. a and y) together with the version of the Minor Prophets show a considerable affinity in their vocabulary, which renders it not improbable that they were all produced at about the same time, if not actually by one and the same hand. In dealing with large groups of books such as this, it is difficult to prove prove identity of translators. All that can be attempted here is to show that these books or portions of books have very many details in common, and that as translations they are sharply distinguished from the Greek Isaiah. 1 /.

In this, however, I have been disappointed. The Greek versions of the Minor Prophets are linked together by the recurrence in the opening and closing books and throughout the collection of certain rare words and usages. I have failed to detect any clear indication of the work of more than one hand. The following are some instances of words and uses which occur in more than one of the Minor Prophets but not elsewhere in the LXX. ׳ΑποσταΚάζίΐν' ΑποσταΚάζίΐν (Am.1 JL1) : aptrf) = הול (Hb.1 Zech.1) : duMKtv = JT1 (Am.1 Hb.1 Hg.1) : κατακον8υ\ιζ!ιν (Am.1)—κονδυλίζιιν (Am.1 Mai.1)—κονδυλισμός (Zeph.1): ττρώπλον (Am.1 Zeph.1): σκοπό! as the equivalent for במרה 'a first-ripe fig' (Ho. ix 10, Na. iii 12): *&lt;ior = גיא (Mi.1 Zech.1). A A noteworthy connecting link between the versions of Jeremiah and the Minor Prophets is found in their rendering of the Divine name ' Lord of hosts יהוה צבאות) ׳), a phrase in the rendering of which a well-marked distinction in the books of the LXX may be observed. It is rendered (1) κύριο! σαβαώθ in 1 Kings (five times), and Isaiah (about fifty-seven times) 1, (2) κύριο! των &amp;ννάμ!ων in the Psalms (passim) and in some few passages elsewhere, (3) κύριο! Παντοκράτωρ in Jeremiah (in both parts, about fifteen times in all: in numerous instances the phrase ' Lord of hosts' occurs in the Hebrew where it is omitted in the Greek), the Minor Prophets (Hos. Am. Mic. Na. Hab. Zeph. Hag. Zech. Mai.), in some few passages in 2 and 3 Kings and 1 Chron., and in the Greek books. The Hebrew phrase, it should be noted, is absent from Ezekiel. In this case, it will be seen, Jeremiah α and β are not distinguished from each other. I have already in Table I in my first paper4 noted several instances where the first portion of Jeremiah agrees in its renderings with Ezekiel (the agreement is usually confined to Ezekiel α and y) and the Minor Prophets. Thus, in the second of the instances there quoted, we find that the two words τάσσαν and αφανισμό! occur frequently in Jeremiah a, Ezekiel (a and y) and the Minor Prophets as the renderings of two not uncommon Hebrew words, but are unrepresented in Isaiah. This mutual agreement of Jer. a, Ezek. a and y, Min. Prophets, and the exclusion of Isaiah from this group may be attested by numerous examples. As I have said, I think that it points to the translation of the group being a single undertaking, that is to say, the translations were made at one time, and, if not by a single translator, at any rate by a small group of collaborators. It is probable, as will be shown later, 1 Also in Jos. vi 17 Β (Heb. simply יהוה), Zech. xiii ג (om. σαβ. AQ), Jer. xxvi 10 AQ(om. σαβ. BK). ' Vol. iv, pp. 47ג ff.</page><page sequence="3">58ο THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES that the version of Isaiah had been already made, and that the rest of the prophetical group or the bulk of it was then translated en bloc. It is quite possible that a closer examination than I have yet made will reveal divergences of rendering within the group, but the general agreement is, I think, unmistakable. The following table contains a selection of some of the most striking examples where Jer. a, Ezek. a and y, and Min. Prophets or two of these three books (the Minor Prophets in the Greek must, as was said, be treated as a single book) stand alonex, or nearly alone in their rendering of a Hebrew word or phrase, or in their employment of the same Greek word 2.

See Table III 2. 1 These instances are indicated by an asterisk. י It will be seen that Lamentations agrees with this group in some renderings. Both the recent Bible dictionaries (s.v. 'Lamentations') assert that this book cannot have been translated by the ' translator of Jeremiah.' The original authority for this statement is Noldeke {Die alttest. Literatur, 1868, p. 144). The only reason which he gives is that 'die [Uebersetzung] der Klagelieder 1st recht wOrtlich, die des Jeremia frei undsehr nachlassig,' and this dictum is unsupported by any examples. I was at first inclined to think that Lamentations might belong to the group contain inging Jeremiah a. So far as vocabulary goes, they have a certain amount in common : witness the use of Απόσπασμα, Ατιμοΰσθαι, a1pavi{ttv, ΐραστή{, καriyeiv iSaip. But some differences, e. g. the regular rendering of גם in Lamentations by και ye, and the rendering of ארמון by βάρα (Jeremiah a uses άμψοδον and θίμέλιον), now lead me to think that the Greek of Lamentations is the work of another and a later hand.

This positive evidence may be supplemented by a certain amount of negative evidence, namely the absence from this group of books of such common words as καθά (one doubtful instance in Ez. a and one in Jonah), 021׳, itaMov, πάλι!׳ (one instance in Jer. α), παραγίνίσθαι, naifiv (one instance at the end of Jer. a), 7r0Tf, avvayrav, συντάσσίΐν. In some instances Jeremiah a diverges from the group, and Ezekiel and the Minor Prophets seem to be somewhat more closely related to each other than they are to Jeremiah. Thus, the following, which are used in common by Ez. α and y and the Minor Prophets, are absent from Jer. α : ίχό/ifvos (-ov -α), κατίναντι, ov τρόπον, infράνω. The instances given above in Table IV may not in themselves be sufficient to establish identity of translators. Some of them might be due to imitation. I think, however, that the general agreement in vocabulary existing in these prophetical books affords strong cumulative</page><page sequence="6">NOTES AND STUDIES 583 evidence that we have here another group' answering to that earlier group of the five books of the Greek Pentateuch for which the earliest tradition and all intrinsic evidence indicate a common origin. As to the position of the Greek Isaiah, its rendering of 'Lord of hosts' is sufficient by itself to distinguish it from the group which we have been considering. The translator is, moreover, less competent on the whole than the translator or translators of the Jeremiah group', though he tries to hide his ignorance by paraphrase or abbreviation, occasionally giving the general sense of a passage, while omitting to render the difficult words. Such deliberate deviation from the original is quite foreign to the translators of the other prophetical books, who honestly, although often with little success, try to find an equivalent for every word in the Hebrew. On the other hand, the Isaiah translator, while careless about producing a literal rendering, employs a Greek which much more nearly approaches the classical style than the Greek of the more painstaking translators of the other prophetical books. This may be illustrated by his use of connecting particles. Κα/, it, yap are freely inserted, where there is no corresponding Hebrew word; we may note also the use of καϊ νύν, διότι νύν (iii 8), roimv (iii 10, ν 13), τοίνυν δια δια τούτο (xxvii 4)&gt; δί (xxxvii 28), άλλα «׳ίι׳ (iii 13), τοιγαρούν (ν 26), ού yap yap ... ιίλλά (ν 24). The greater ease of style, and the tendency to give a free rather than a verbatim rendering, are, I think, marks of a comparatively early date. Another characteristic of the Isaiah trans lation, which perhaps also points to an early date, is the agreement which it shows in some of its renderings with the book of Exodus. An ephah is rendered by μίτρα τρία only in Ex. xvi 36 and Is. ν 10; גר (usually rendered πάροικο! or προα-ήλυτο!) is represented by the strange word ytapa!ytapa! (γαύρα!) only in Ex. xii 19 (ii 22, Philo, De Confus. Ling. \ך) and Is. xiv 1; the anthropomorphism by which Jehovah is called ,a man of war' is avoided by the same paraphrase συντριβών πολίμου! in Ex. xv 3, Is. xlii 13. Cf. also the use of the words θήκη and κόσυμβο!, and the phrase tt!tt!tt! top αιώνα χρόνο ν (Ex. xiv 13, Is. seven times). With Genesis the Isaiah translator uses κόνδυ and συναγωγή ϋδατογ (Is. xix 6, xxxvii 25, Gen. i 9)'. Further results may, I believe, be obtained in the grouping of the 1 Dr. Ryle says, on the other hand, ' The only considerable portion of the trans lation done at the same time and by the same hands is the Pentateuch' (Canon of of thtthttht Ο. T., pp. 146 f.). ' Swete, Introd. to O. T.t p. 316. י י A characteristic phrase of the Isaiah translator is μικροί cot piyas (dad μικροί ton μιγίλου). He seems to have recourse to this when in doubt as to the meaning of the Hebrew. It occurs as the equivalent of five different Hebrew phrases (ix 14 (13), xxii 5, 34, xxxiii 4,19), none of these being the common נזקפון מנר נרול which the Greek phrase ordinarily renders in other parts of the LXX.</page><page sequence="7">584 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES books of the LXX by a careful study of their style and vocabulary. As an instance of this I should like, in concluding this note, to mention that, just as the Greek Isaiah stands apart from the other prophetical books, so 1 Kingdoms seems to stand apart from the other three Books of Kingdoms and the Book of Judges. Although, owing to a large admixture of Hexaplaric readings1, it is difficult to arrive at the earliest text in these books, and there is no clear evi dence of so close a connexion as appears to exist between the later prophetical books, yet there are certain features common to, and practically confined to Jd., 2, 3 and 4 Kingdoms, in which, as in other respects, they are distinguished from 1 Kingdoms. Thus, the peculiar use of (γώ *Iμι (=אנכי) before a finite verb (όγώ dpi άσομαι and the like) is practically confined to Jd. (B text five times, A text once), Ruth, 2 K. (seven times: also vii 29 σύ « (λάλησα!), 3 Κ. (once), 4 Κ. (three times)2. Kfρατίνη for 'trumpet' (שופר) is confined to Jd. (B and A texts ten times), 2 K. (four times)', 3 K. (three times), 4 K. (once), 2 Ch. A text (once), and Nehemiah (twice); whereas σάλπι-γζ is used in ι K. and elsewhere. The same combination is seen in the use of the superlative μονώτατο! (י!בד) with the sense of the positive; it is confined to Jd. (once), 2 K. (thrice), 3 K. (five times), 4 K. (twice), and 2 Chron. vi 30 Α. ι Kingdoms uses μόνο!, which is found along with μονώτατο! in 2, 3 and 4 K. Note also the use of the following in 1 Κ.: βάσανο! (= אשם 'guilt-offering'), the transliteration yMovp (=4 ,3 ,2 : נתד Κ. render by μονόζωνοs, (ξ08ία, σΰστρ(μμα), δίκαζαν and δικαστή! (שפט : Jd. Ruth, 2, 3, 4 Κ., &amp;c., use κμίναν, κρίτη!), the adjective λοιμό! to render ' (sons of) Belial' (παράνομο! in Dt., Jd., 2, 3 K., &amp;c.). Many of the renderings in Jd., 2, 3, 4 K. mentioned above find attestation in some part of the Hexapla. I should be inclined to say that the original Greek of these books, when all due allowance has been made for the subsequent intrusion of Hexaplaric readings, was akin in many respects to that of the later Greek versions (Aquila, &amp;c.), and that the versions of these historical books were made at a comparatively late date. 1 King doms represents the first attempt to translate 'the earlier prophets' (נביאים ראשונים), as the Greek Isaiah exhibits the first attempted rendering of' the later prophets' (נביאים אחרונים). It is curious to note that it is only in these two books that the Divine title יהוה צבאות is consistently represented by Κ όριο: σαβαώθ. 1 A striking instance is seen in 3 Kingdoms, in which book most of the large lacunae in the Β text of the LXX are supplied in cod. A from Aquila (see viii 1, ix 15 ff. &amp;c.). 2 Also Job xxxiii 31, Ez. xxxvi 36 A. s 2άλπ1γ£ in 2 K. ii 28, vi 15 ; κιρα,τίνη in 2 K. xv 10, xviii 16, xx I, 2 2. There is other evidence for a distinction between the earlier and later portions of this book.</page><page sequence="8">NOTES AND STUDIES 585 It may be worth while briefly to state the conclusions reached:— 1. 1. Isaiah was the first of the prophetical books to be rendered into Greek. 2. The first half of Jeremiah, the greater part of Ezekiel, and the whole of the Minor Prophets were afterwards translated en bloc, possibly by a single hand, possibly by a small group of collaborateurs. 3. The remaining portions of Jeremiah and Ezekiel exhibit a style quite distinct from that which is found in the last-named group. These portions may have been made at the same time as the last group (this part of the work, with a view to expediting the translation of these two long books, being entrusted to persons not conversant with the methods of the translator or translators of the rest of the group), or they may be the work of a still later date, the earliest versions of these books having been only fragmentary. 4. In the case of Ezekiel, and possibly in other books, the rendering given of the lessons read on the great festivals, such as Pentecost, in the synagogues at Alexandria, formed the basis on which a complete translation was afterwards engrafted. 5. ι Kingdoms was like the Greek Isaiah, a first attempt at rendering one of the main divisions of the Hebrew Bible, and exhibits a different style from that of the later versions of 2, 3 and 4 Kingdoms.
