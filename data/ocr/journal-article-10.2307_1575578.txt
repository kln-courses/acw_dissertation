<plain_text><page sequence="1">THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES Private Worlds and the Technology of the Imaginary: Effects of Science and Technology on Human Representations and Self-Conceptions Luigi Lentini T he impact of science and technology on contemporary society is probably without historical prece- dent. Their effects, nevertheless, are often unorderly. Mixed together with fragments of languages of the postmodern Babel, these effects introduce mutations in the ecosystem and in people. People, in turn, interact with scientific and technological products in a mimetic and confident way; they seem to feel secure in private. But within the city environ- ment, new phenomena overflow the strictly individual sphere to project themselves into public or social spheres. As a result, the areas of interaction between the private sphere and science and technology are key points for un- derstanding the tendencies within and from the individual toward society, and vice versa. These phenomena are the focus of this paper. For each of them, I intend to reveal a certain degree of underlying rationality, even in what is apparently irrational. In this attempt I have been inspired by the work of Freud [1] (which demonstrates a ciphered and decipherable discourse in the oneiric process) and by that of Charles Sanders Peirce [2] (related to the first stage of the process of knowledge: abduction). In addition, the recent interpretive contributions of Massimo Bonfantini [3], an important Peircean scholar, have been helpful [4]. I have not tried to use these sources in a systematic manner. I try only to infer on the basis of some facts an implicative connection between those facts and a probable law, developed or pre-existing, that explains the facts on a hy- pothetical level. PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SPHERES The terms public and private apparently have no semantic ambiguity, but minimal reflection on their historical development reveals phenomena that are not entirely famil- iar. At this time, especially in the technologically more developed countries, a tendency toward introversion, whose focus is the home space, has developed. Part of this phenom- enon has been called 'cocooning' in the United States: the use of the limits of one's own home as a cocoon. The causes that explain the phenomenon are supposedly the absence of security, comfort and so on outside the home [5]. The main effect is, according to some commentators, a reduc- tion of the extent of territory used. The outside apparently is perceived as hostile. In this way, the home symbolically defines a space that is both real and imaginary (considering the imaginary as an illusion without contradictions), char- ? 1991 ISAST Pergamon Press pic.

The Material and Public Spheres Masses of people have always participated in social events. In many cases, this participation has been spontaneous, and in many others it has been directed politically by the power groups of the moment. But al- ways, in public events of any ABSTRACT The author examines the effects of contemporary science and technology on individuals and the psychological and cultural muta- tions that can result, ranging from the physical dematerialization of people to the continuity existing be- tween their psyches and their elec- tronic devices. Within a framework of interrelationships between art and society, he develops a hypo- thesis about the role of the artist in society. kind-trials, religious ceremonies, plays or political gather- ings-masses of people have been, in different epochs, alternately actors and spectators [7]. From decades preceding the eighteenth century until the beginning of the twentieth century, masses of people have participated in large religious or military gatherings, and more and more they have gathered to watch sporting events. There is, in all of these manifestations, beyond their mere form, a physical presence of actors, of spectators, or of both. Why do I point out such a well-known phenomenon? I point it out because this phenomenon of mass participation may disappear. Before analyzing this possibility, let us pause briefly to examine the concept of what is private. Today, the material effects of this term can be measured, thanks to proxemics [8]. Conceptually, privacy is the need for separation, which may manifest itself in many ways. Children, in order to distance themselves from adults, can in some cases simply turn their backs. Similar manners of seeking privacy can be used by adults in pathological conditions such as prisons or concentration camps. I propose that privacy is defined by a certain precinct for separating oneself from something or someone. This im- plies situations that are structurally, although not signifi- cantly, the same. For example, certain religious spaces were private in Greece in the fifth century B.C., in the same way that a contemporary club might be, even though the two Luigi Lentini (architect, teacher), Apartado 7880, 1000 San Jose, Costa Rica.

The bathroom of a house is private, and so is the body space surrounding a person. Thus, in the search for a definition of the concept of privacy, we encounter such diverse phenomena as sacredness and territorial marking, which is com- monly studied in ethology. The con- cept of a precinct, as it relates to privacy, is common to all these examples, al- though what is within the precinct var- ies in meaning. In addition, the method of enclosing the area should be men- tioned. Visual or auditory cues can be used to separate oneself from others. One part of the body, and not other parts, can be closed off, as studies of nonverbal languages have shown. Thus, when speaking of the concept of privacy, it is necessary to define the subjects and the objects as well as their interaction. The etymology of the word provides a description that it still valid: the Latin privus indicates individuality, the condi- tion of not forming part of something. Thus, privacy is a voluntary privation of social aspects, or not being part of social interaction; that is, it is to be simply oneself. Cocooning is partially related to this etymology since electronic sys- tems should be included in it. While, on one hand, the 'cocoon' implies the physical condition of not forming part of something, on the other hand, through electronic systems, it is con- nected to 'everything'. A whole comprises a unit that inter- acts with its parts. The whole with which we are concerned here is made up of observers of systems as well as systems that are observed. Their interaction is manifested in different ways, from en- tertainment to information; it is a dy- adic relationship. The image of society, in this case, is conveyed significantly by means of electronic systems that re-present it. Thus, the absence of physi- cal participation, which implies the dematerialization of the observer and the disappearance of the role of actor, is confirmed. This tendency, which is the beginning of the gradual disappear- ance of the physical presence of the subjects in social participation, began only recently. Certainly, this process of dematerial- ization is discontinuous, since large crowds still come together, for ex- ample, for sporting, musical and politi- cal events. But this fact does not modify the inevitable tendency; nor is this ten- Fig. 1. Albrecht Diirer, Draughtsman and Reclining Woman, engraving, 7.6 x 21.2 cm [21]. The artist, using the 'window' perspective method, is representing the reclining woman. Through the transparent window divided into squares, he looks at the woman and draws her on a surface that duplicates the measurements and squares on the window. In order not to change his point of view, he uses a vertical device. l-0_ _-_N , 1 _ -- Fig. 2.

From the observer (0) are traced two rays (representing the visual limits of the observer) that trespass the window or screen (S) and arrive at the woman Ri.

The other parts of reality (R) outside the window are not taken into account. dency modified by people who still have no written languages and who do not use electronic devices. These groups too tend to become literate and to use electronic devices in their daily cultures. What I want to emphasize is the effect that current science and technology can have, through their products, on individuals: interaction becomes progressively disembodied. Radio, for example, has directed in- dividuals, slowly but surely, toward the role of ever more passive spectators. Hearing alone excites their fantasies, and in their psychological worlds they extrapolate from the sound messages and give them meaning. The operation of 'giving signifi- cance' to a determined universe of sound is not conceptually far from the process already carried out by the hom- inid who analyzed footprints in the dirt or attributed to sounds various mythical and real images. We now can interpret multiple sound universes in our homes or wherever we take our radios without committing more than our imagina- tions. In a certain sense, we seem to be playing with a part of the perceptual system that previously was used by our ancestors to ensure their survival through the ages. We play at having adventures that are now no longer dangerous: we frighten ourselves so that we can feel happy afterward. Could this be an exorcism of what happens to us in the streets, or an exorcism of the possibility of an ecological catastrophe, just as our ancestors with their paint- ings supposedly exorcized the hunt, provider of food and of death? Strangely, our perceptual system now is apparently not as effective for defend- ing ourselves or for attacking as it once was. Does this mean that we no longer need it, or that our culture has provided a certain control over the situation, or both? Are we faced with the loss of some senses and the birth of others in a process of mutation? Mutants and the Mutated We began the compartmentalization of our individual senses with the radio, which excludes sight, smell and tactile perception, according to a process of contemporary culture that later led us to subordinate other senses to that of sight via television. Television, in turn, has influenced the sense of hearing in sophisticated ways, such as experienced through the relationship between the events and accompanying music of tel- evision programs. Music and sound ef- fects can be used to convey meanings 334 Lentini, Private Worlds and the Technology of the Imaginary</page><page sequence="3">consonant with the visual images on the screen. Or, this interrelationship be- tween the auditory and visual can be rendered disconsonant, thereby pro- ducing dramatic or humorous effects. In short, spectators have had to adjust their senses to these new kinds of 'unnatural' or technologically induced perceptions. These phenomena are not limited to television and radio. Many synthetic materials are the visual analogues of natural ones. Their function is to re- present something that is seen as real, even though it perhaps no longer ex- ists. The natural sensations, tactile, hap- tic [9] and even olfactory, are replaced by perceptions developed through elec- tronic devices. The possible sensory ef- fects on subjects have been partially outlined ironically byJerzy Kosinski in Being There [10]. Much can still be added to this tendency to the extent that the quality and quantity of the systems [11] are increased. But how do individuals react when faced with such perceptions? On the one hand, we become extraordi- narily perceptive of that which does not exist; on the other hand, we become passive. Reality is presented as a utopia, or, to be more precise, as a group of heterogeneous utopias, mobile and al- ready realized. Another aspect of this tendency is the amplification of those systems (e.g. computer programs) that promote a playful activity, such as changing or giving colors to an image or adding characters in interactive on-line story telling. In this sense, it is if we were at the beginning of a new form of com- municating our experiences. Until re- cently, communication was the task of writers. But there is a fundamental difference between the situation today and previously: we can present this re- ality while modifying it infinitely as work in progress that is tangential to or superimposed on other work. Specta- tors can assume, among other things, ample and free playful activity. Today, they cannot only use but also possess the systems, thereby structuring for themselves a role that was not formerly available in history. In what way, then, is the relation between actor and spec- tator altered? The assumption of the roles of actor and spectator presents a polarization that has already been par- tially recorded in history. But the modi- fication of these roles involves us in sit- uations that are difficult to foresee, because it implies transformation of the physical and human context from the moment in which the role of observer might become dynamic and reversible, in a complete interaction with the sys- tems. The miniaturization of these apparatus, from the radio to the com- puter, leads to greater human inter- action with the media. Paradoxically, this miniaturization is accompanied by hyperbolization. Television screens grow larger, and, although there are still problems with resolution, they are only a few steps behind movie screens. We see that, with the development of holographic television accompanied by a variation of scale, the physical and psychological context of the screen will be amplified to an extent never before experienced. But what is the implica- tion of this phenomenon? The implica- tion is the loss of limits. If the television screen leads the attention of the spec- tator toward a point, toward certain worlds, it is sufficient to move one's eyes to one side in order to leave these worlds and return to what we call 'real- ity'. But what modifications will be pro- duced in the individual and in the in- dividual's context if there are no limits to the screen? Let us analyze the per- ception of reality as it relates to two mutations, that of the subject and that of the context. MUTATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL If the individual, until a short time ago, assumed a particularly passive role, the introduction of new, integrated elec- tronic systems has made it possible sym- bolically to extend the world of privacy more and more. Mixage, miniaturiza- tion, hyperbolization and the apparent alteration of time and space, among other things, have given us, within the framework of the screen, an omnimo- dal power. Now we can choose our pro- grams to suit our taste. With the antici- pated advent of computerized human figures, it will be possible to create doubles of real persons with or without any relation to reality. One will be able to speak with them or manage them and make them do what one wants. I have no doubt that such operations will become within reach of most everyone [12], from the state to the citizen, in real or deferred time. The possibility of creating political controls as well as of sabotaging them, or of creating alternative controls, be- comes food for thought. One aspect that interests me is the possibility of in- dividuals projecting desires that today still belong to the psychological world. These are on the way to being projected onto a screen and communicated to others to a degree limited only by the electronic system used. This projection gives rise to the following question: Would individuals, who, for the first time in history, project and see their desires manifested outside of them- selves not undergo a transformation? Psychoanalysis states that we always desire the unachievable. What will hap- pen if what we desire becomes achieva- ble, even if only in images, on a screen that tends toward infinity (in terms of human perception)? Throughout the centuries, humans have used language to re-present the world (and the universe) in many ways: scientific, artistic, philosophical, religious. But certainly not everybody has used language in such ways. Until recently it has been primarily the domain of medicine men, priests, philosophers or sages, artists, poets or scientists to represent the world for the tribes, societies and the whole planet. But this human tradition is moving toward a change. The reason is the so- cialization of the means (instruments), which makes those means each day more accessible-even if only in an illu- sory way-to re-create, to re-present or simply to express the world we live in. ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS AND THE RE-PRESENTATION OF THE WORLD Apparently, we are facing a change only of our expressive instruments (i.e. we have added electronic devices to the instruments at our disposal) but there are noticeably different aspects in- volved that include an ample, although little-perceived, range. One aspect of extraordinary impor- tance is the absence of learned tech- niques of expression. People will be able to represent whatever they wish ever more amply. A marked emphasis on an extra-aesthetic situation is always present in part of popular culture: the need for similarity between the re-pre- sentation and the interpreted model. That will be transformed into a com- plete equality between the two. Using specific software and a computer con- nected to a television camera, one can make a self-portrait or, of course, any portrait. However, we are still referring to a situation within a frame of refer- ence, differentiating the figure from the ground. Lentini, Private Worlds and the Technology of the Imaginary 335</page><page sequence="4">There is always the predominance of our daily relationship with the world. Anthropomorphic or geocentric operations transform the creatures of other planets, when they are different, into almost-humans, and they trans- form extraterrestrial landscapes into images that are recognizable or assimil- able to terrestrial landscapes. These operations are similar to those that can be seen in the fantasy maps of the New World according to the iconography of the Europe of the Renaissance. But if this analogy is already obsolete, there are still others in existence today, even though they too may be on the way to extinction. Here I am referring to physical space and the symbolic space of representation. R Fig 3. This fig- ^ ure shows, in a opt\~ ~general way, how a screen (S) can ?t "j. y&gt;&gt;\ cover reality (R). / L '? / .-, In this case a hologram is the / / / / / , screen that is sup- posed to (tends to) cover reality. W e can also imagine an un- limited window, transparent or not, covering it. Fig. 4. This is a part, or the 'first step' of the model expressed by Fig. 5. The internal square represents a theoretical begin- ning of the act of covering a part of reality (R) by some screen (S) produced through technical devices. The screen contains images from the imagination of a human subject. The television screen (either exter- nal to or incorporated into a system) continues to limit us with a repre- sentational space marked by the bor- ders of the Renaissance perspective: the 'window' mentioned by Leon Battista Alberti [13]. Certainly, what happens within these borders has changed. Now we are in front of a window in motion, but it is still limited by borders. On the other hand, if we remember the engrav- ing Draughtsman and Reclining Woman by Durer (Fig. 1), we cannot fail to consider that if the historical visual re- sources obliged the artist to represent movement by means of illusionary opti- cal resources in the system of the por- trait, in reality the artist actually saw and was able to understand his or her opera- tion by means of the window in motion, despite the lack of instruments for pre- senting the fluidity of motion. It should also be pointed out that, in this repre- sentation, the artist clearly decided to frame a part of reality (Fig. 2). What we see today, in contrast, is that the image tends to overflow the window (screen) (Fig. 3). There is a tendency, therefore, toward the infinity of the image. The presentation (or the natural real- ity as it appears to us with the naked eye or is taken in by a television camera or a photographic camera) becomes iden- tical to the re-presentation (that reality that traditionally has been re-presented by an artist through an artwork). Cer- tainly, a 'sort of re-presentation' will always be present in any representation, but generally it will be different from that expressed by an artist. At the same time, now there is a manifestation that is absolutely new in all of history: re-presentation can be superimposed on reality, substituting for it. An example of this is an image projected onto our environment, cov- ering it in order to replace it or substi- tute for it, such as a holographic image. REAL AND IMAGINARY: SUPERIMPOSITION AND EXCLUSION If, through language, we have access to culture [14] and thereby a way of relat- ing to the world, we are now faced with the possibility of operating on reality in such a way-outside of our minds-that we might be confused by it, not within ourselves but rather outside of our- selves. This confusion would be verified if reality (presentation) were to be phe- nomenologically mixed with language that represents it (re-presentation) or if reality would simply 'hide' it. In such a case, as we can see in Fig. 3, the hologram could be interpreted as a screen (S) partially covering reality (R). This would confront us with a situation in which the imaginary substitutes for reality. The diagram in Fig. 4 illustrates how the internal square (S), which represents the screen, begins its first (theoretical) step toward covering real- ity (R). It would be a visible operation of quantifiable limits and areas. To the extent that the screen is extended, thereby hiding reality, reality tends to be reduced to zero. Figure 5 illustrates the theoretical steps of the screen's ex- pansion (S1, S2, S, . . ., Si) and the collateral reduction of the area (AR1, AR2, AR3, .., ARi) of reality (R), which 336 Lentini, Private Worlds and the Technology of the Imaginary</page><page sequence="5">tends to disappear totally, or to zero. We can, therefore, interpret this rela- tion by means of two values. The first corresponds to the image of what is real (ARi, AR2, AR3, . . ARi). This value would be objective and measurable in human parameters; it represent the portion of reality not hidden by the screen. The table provided by Hall in The Hidden Dimension [15], concerning distinct modes of vision, would be use- ful to define this, as the table measures the distances and the areas visually per- ceived by a human observer. Developed rhetorical operations would also be definable. They could surely refer us to important analogies in regard to the mental operations of the operator of the image. In fact, an operator working with no physical limits on what might be created on the screen would be able to express his or her psychological world by means of electronic images. Here it is important to remark that the screen would not necessarily be empty but rather made up of images of any kind, partially or totally covering reality (in terms of human perception as stated by Hall). When and if this happens, we probably could use it as a model for under- standing the operator's way of thinking and its liaisons with reality. The second value, which is the por- tion that covers reality (representation, or the imaginary), is also quantifiable and results from the subtraction of the former. In this way, we have a quantita- tive value of the imaginary and of its counterpart, the real. Finally, we could think that the terms presentation, re-presentation, imaginary and real, and their relationships, al- ready analyzed, are all part of a limited case of the system proposed by Alberti and illustrated by Diirer; but the model of the artist is no more than a part of the same process because, even if the limits of the screen disappear, there is always an 'in front of, an 'in back of, an 'above' and a 'below'. But holo- grams, for example, with their three- dimensional effects, would cause these perceptions to disappear, to the extent that they join what is real with the image, in scientific terms, or they hide it in terms of human perception. PRIVATE WORLDS: MUTATION OF THE CONTEXT We are seeing the transformation of the individual, the transformation of the individual's context, and the creation of an absolutely new or mixed context. The individual's way of thinking is also modified. We do not perceive our known reality, which is subject to a process of accelerated transformation, except by means of the maladaptation and indisposition that Vattimo has called the postmodern condition [16]. In spite of possessing the means of project- ing another reality on this reality, a means that is the result of our own creation or that of others, we suffer a lack of total awareness of this situation. Therefore, I reaffirm what I said ini- tially, that the descriptive process is developed on the basis of private worlds. This leads to a modification of the immediate surroundings and, fi- nally, of the territory. We are beings whose attempts to achieve homeostasis [17] with the world have always shown a certain precariousness. The observ- able hiatus is constantly increasing between conditions of environmental comfort and natural climatic condi- tions. It is clear that the latter condi- after the first step.

' tions form part of a larger process re- lated to human development in all areas. Thus, homeostasis between the human mind and its context seems to be verifying itself in that this context tends more and more to be created by human beings themselves. The individual, with respect to him- self or herself, faces for the first time in history, outside of the realm of magic, the materialization of the imaginary and the possibility of sharing it with others, the possibility of being the ob- ject and the subject of the imposition of the imaginary. We are now faced with a series of questions that range from the relations of the citizen with the state to social interrelations. It is probable that this influence will be progressively less noticed because we have obliged ourselves to a daily process of adaptation. Perhaps the possibility of putting off the imaginary will generate an increase in abilities and access to new potentialities. Thus, we will no longer be faced with McLuhan's thesis of perfectionism and 0 d, - ._..... t3- -, , , i ----.

In their stead, there is the verification of an essentially psychological continuity of individuals with systems that have possi- bilities for expansion toward social interaction, not necessarily like that ex- pressed in some comics or films, but, much to the contrary, like a naturalized interaction, one pedestrian and famil- iar. The formidable power of levels of sharing also presents itself: cognitive, emotional, mythic, playful, etc. But among whom will this interaction take place? Will it be between one individual and another, between one individual and many others or among everyone simultaneously? Both a homogeneous and a chaotic landscape could be possible, depending on whether a re- peated image is produced in one place or a chaotic production of images oc- curs at another place at the same time. Nevertheless, we are facing the possi- bility of a massive theatricalization of the private or of the group, whereby the ancient Greek mode of participatory democracy will be distant in time. If we draw the logical conclusions of what I have said, we can see private worlds as the beginning of an equality (private equals public) whose terms will no longer be semantically opposed. The total soliloquy, in which a sub- ject talks to his or her own (electronic) image, must also be part of these con- siderations. That which previously was only imagined-after having been ex- pressed for centuries by poets and writ- ers and, in our century, interpreted by psychoanalysis as the double [19]-will actually be achieved. The double must not exclude the analysis of certain pathologies. And what will be the role of the artist? ARTIST AND SOCIETY: TENDENCY AND HYPOTHESIS The interrelations among science, tech- nology and the arts are very limited even though the last two are tending toward an increasingly greater integra- tion, thanks to the achievements of the first. There are few examples in which art decidedly confronts these fields in all senses of the word. It seems, in addition, that the representations of contemporary science and technology made by the arts often reflect the science and technology of the past. The fact is that we are no longer in an exclusively mechanical world, but rather in an electronic one. We are faced with immateriality. Simulta- neously, in the opposite corner, there are many apparently contemporary ex- periences, of a holographic nature, for example, that are caught between tech- nical achievement and contemporary accoutrements whose significance tends toward zero, as we can see, for instance, at the Musee de l'Holographie at the Pompidou Center in Paris. I believe that many areas of contemporary art fail to confront some of the problems I have mentioned, although pages of criticism in this regard have been writ- ten. The main problem, from my point of view, is that science is not repre- sented, and only the effects of tech- nology are used, such as lasers, holo- grams and so on. The possibilities of expression have been multiplied enormously both for the artist and for everyone. Now there is no screen, institutionally approved location or stage. Everything can be transformed into a space of multiple dimensions. Certain purely traditional operations of art have also undergone change. Representation has become a presentation; mimesis or analogy has become identity. Simulated images of reality tend to be progressively more comprehensive. What role remains, therefore, for the artist when the possi- bility of creating is open to everybody? Let us analyze two extremes that define a tendency and a hypothesis, while at the same time we remain aware that we actually are facing an immense range of possibilities, which deserve a detailed and extensive analysis. The first extreme, which we have seen repeatedly throughout history, offers to the artist an opportunity to negate his or her context, developing modes of traditional, intermediate or new representation that reinterpret the phenomenon of the socialization of the aesthetic. In this case, the world that artists represent, present or interpret will be subject to the interpretation of their colleagues but will be ever more exposed to the interpretation of society, regardless of whether the artists will it or not. Artists who believe that such representation is real will find themselves facing the loss of reality, condemned to live trapped either in the illusory space of other artists or in an expressive interaction bordering on illusion that approaches the limits of pathology. This reality is rapidly begin- ning to be at the disposition of citizens now able to convert into reality this parallel world, about which, until the present, they could only dream or see as partially represented by others (some- times, at best, by the artist). We can begin to define this universe as an analogy of the real world and thus transmit it to others. In this situation, analogy and reality end up being an equality. This situation leads to that death of art prophesied by Hegel [20] and many others. In this case, death gives life to a socialized expression for which society will no longer need ar- tists. But it is reasonable to suppose that this reality will be constantly subject to multiple illusory modifications, not ex- empt from opposing interactions. Per- haps this is where an option for the artist can be seen, that is, in the pre- viously mentioned hypothesis, or the second extreme. The second extreme would define for the artist a role that is difficult to imagine because of its multivalence: it implies the presence of such dissimilar roles as those of psychoanalyst and cen- sor. The artist would read a reality that is no longer private but rather public, based on what is private; he or she would be able to auscultate and visual- ize the world of desire already social- ized. Now, being able to use symbolic instruments (the effects of the techno- logical instruments), in a complex cul- tural process that is difficult to imagine, he or she could re-present those social- ized aesthetic universes for society itself and, for the first time, observe the mul- tiform panorama of the collective im- aginary. This is a historically original opportunity that is full of possibilities. Together with these two extremes, in which the former is already a fact and the latter a mere possibility, there are numerous alternatives, all of which con- front us with a choice that is a matter of freedom. Science and technology offer us opposite things: a denial of this world in a certain way-and the creation of an illusory one-or a confrontation with this world. This means that even if we tend toward unlimited means of social communication and expressiveness or the creation of cultural landscapes, par- tially or totally denying our world, we cannot forget two questions, similar to those that Paul Gauguin confronted in his art: From where are we coming? And who are we? The first question refers to our history as humankind, to our cities and human settlements, which are the physical supports of such 338 Lentini, Private Worlds and the Technology of the Imaginary 338</page><page sequence="7">history. The second question involves nature, because our support, the body, is part of it. The answers to these two questions are not a romantic matter but an ecological, economical and cultural one. Our body and the environment need food, pure air, water and sun. Consequently, it obliges us not to go back to the past but to do with the history of humankind and with nature the same things we are trying to do with science, technology and society. These answers, perhaps, could clarify another question of Gauguin: Where are we going?

I thank Osvaldo Skliar, with whom I had many interesting conversations concerning the subject of this text. 5. I am aware that this topic has been openly dis- cussed in the United States and that it has been the object of sociological studies. Nevertheless, I do not wish to consider it as more than an indication of a larger situation. 6. The imaginary becomes, as we shall see later, the space of the illusion, out of the mind. 7. Michel Foucault analyzes these mass behaviors of people and their relationships with the political powers; see his Discipline and Punish (New York: Pantheon, 1977). 8.

Hall, The Hidden Dimension (Gar- den City, NY: Anchor Books, Doubleday, 1969) p. 1. 9. 'Haptic' is a term used in experimental psychol- ogy. Sensations perceived with the palm of the hand, such as touching a three- dimensional object, are defined as haptic. 10. Jerzy Kosinski, Being There (New York: Harcourt BraceJovanovich, 1970). 11. By 'system', I refer here to the coordination and organization of various elements, whether of similar or different nature, to reach some objective, e.g. an image of a rose floating in the air (a holo- gram), smelling as a real rose (using chemical devices) and decorating a space. 12. Today in many Latin American countries there is an excess of hardware, much of which is not used to its full potential. I foresee that this situation will continue for years to come. 13. "I write [draw] a square with right angles as big as I want, which I consider as an open window through which I can see what there shall be painted" (translated from the Italian by L. Lentini); Leon Battista Alberti, Della Pittura (Florence: L. Malle, 1950) p. 70. 14. See Jacques Lacan, Ecrits (Paris: Editions Du Seuil, 1966) pp. 493-528. 'Culture' is for Lacan an interchange law, a symbolic order that allows us a passage from nature to human society. 'Language' is the moment in which the culture is established, as a system of symbolic interchange, for facilitating the interchange of experiences. A triadic relation- ship is then established: nature, society, culture. 15. These modes of vision (or categories, accord- ing to Hall) are intimate, personal, social and pub- lic. The categories are also related to the aperture of the eyes (in degrees) and their distances from the object observed (in inches or feet). These two parameters define, in a scientific way, the surface seen by the observer and, at the same time, the category. See Hall [8] pp. 126-127. 16. The concept, created by the Italian philoso- pher Gianni Vattimo, has been used often by him and the Italian media. See Pier Aldo Rovatti and Vattimo Gianni, Ilpensiero debole (Milan: Feltrinelli, 1983). 17.

Psychoanalysis has pointed out since Freud and Otto Rank the contradictory positions of our un- conscious in its descriptions of the psyche, and there are abundant literary examples in many countries, for example, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein, Narcissus and some characters in the tales ofJorge Luis Borges.
