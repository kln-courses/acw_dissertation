<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAIMONIDES ON KINGSHIP The Ethics of Imperial Humility James A. Diamond ABSTRACT In his adoption of the Maimonidean guidelines for extreme humility, the king acts as the supreme existential model for imitatio dei. Imperial gover- nance, when filtered through the prism of Maimonidean humility, results in a regime that most closely resembles a divine one. Using those who occupy the very bottom of the social and political hierarchy (slaves and orphans) as models, the king projects his own sense of "lowliness" to the people. The king thereby promotes their sense of autonomy, and inhibits any anthropocentrism that would be fostered if he were to be viewed as an autocrat. His administration of the royal office is limited by the ethical and philosophical dictates of humility, thereby offering a window into the distinction between its common (anivut) and extreme (shefal ruah) mani- festations. Maimonides does in fact define the parameters of this extraor- dinary humility, but he chooses to do so within the context of a distinct and concrete personality - that of the king. key words: Maimonides, king, humility, halakha, ethics, Moses, Mishneh Torah Moses Maimonides (d.1204), when dealing with the rules governing eth- ical conduct in his pioneering code of rabbinic law, the Mishneh Torah, adopts the Aristotelian "golden mean" as the sole legitimate measure of all character traits. Maimonides categorizes these as "opinions" (deot) rather than as moral qualities. Initially, he categorically endorses this principle: "The correct path is the median (midah benonit) for each and every characteristic that is found in man . . ." (Maimonides 2001, 65 Ethics 1:3; Weiss 1975, 67-70; see Aristotle 1985, 1106a28-b7). As he develops his codification further, however, he makes exceptions to this rule rather inconsistently. Humility, in particular, is specifically excluded from the application of the "golden mean" doctrine.1 The only method 1 The other exception to the rule of the mean is anger, which requires a separate treat- ment; my study is restricted to the issue of humility. For the purposes of this study, it suffices to accept the conclusion of Daniel Statman, citing Haim Vital and Jeffrie Murphy, that hubris and anger both arise out of the same human impulses (Statman 1995, 361).

When it comes to the trait of pride or, literally, an "elevated heart" igovah lev), it is not only advisable to break with the norm of mod- erate conduct, it is actually forbidden to act in accordance with it, "There are those traits for which man is forbidden from following the mean but rather he should veer to the other extreme, and that is an 'elevated heart'" (Maimonides 2001, 67 Ethics 2:3). In this case the model is one of virtual self-effacement rather than what is usually understood as common hu- mility (anivut); this recommended extreme is expressed by the key, yet undefined, phrases "lowly of spirit" (shefal ruah) and "exceedingly base of spirit" (ruho nemukho lemeod).2 My aim in this study is not to address these apparently contradic- tory positions advanced by Maimonides in very close proximity to each other, which have vexed scholars, both rabbinic and academic (Kreisel 1999, 161). Rather, it is to determine what kind of exaggerated behavior these phrases convey and what dangers they are intended to combat. Maimonides does in fact define the parameters of this extraordinary humility, but he chooses to do so within the context of a distinct and con- crete personality. This opportunity arrives at the end of his code, in the tractate entitled "Laws of Kings and their Wars," which is largely taken up with the conduct Israelite kings must follow. The nexus between his theoretical formulation of extreme humility at the beginning of his code and the specific political personage of the king at the end of the code is created by a shared terminology and a common biblical model. First, the assimilation of "lowliness" and the avoidance of an "elevated heart" are hallmarks of the king's rule. Second, Moses is presented as the archetype of utmost humility, the model for both man in general and the king in particular. Finally, the conspicuous appearance of the phrase "lowly of spirit" elsewhere in Maimonides's code to capture economic dependence and political vulnerability will be shown to direct the king to the very opposite end of the social spectrum, to ascertain what ethical posture he must assume. These elements will serve as pointers toward the con- cretization of Maimonides's extremist ethic in his legal (halakhic) con- struct of the king. The person who occupies the highest political office is that individual best suited to embody what, without him, would remain 2 In Maimonides (2001, 66 Character Traits 1:5), anav is the technical term that repre- sents the median on the pride/humility scale. The extreme of self-effacement is captured by the phrase shefal ruah. The former is the ethical stance of the hakham, while the latter is that of the hasid or of the tzaddik (2:3). Steven Schwarzschild claims that the distinction between the mean and the extreme "is Maimonides's entrenched terminological distinction between the Aristotelian homo philosophicus and homo religiosus" (Schwarzschild 1990, 142).</page><page sequence="3">Maimonides on Kingship 91 an ambiguous and largely abstract ideal. Occupying the most extreme limit of the social spectrum that he does, the king is also most prone to whatever dangers pride poses. His administration of the royal office is limited by the ethical and philosophical dictates of humility, thereby offering a window into the distinction between its common (anivut) and extreme (shefal ruah) manifestations. This study, then, will focus on the Maimonidean construct of the monarch, in which aversion to pride and adoption of humility are the definitive characteristics. On the one hand, the laws governing the throne legitimize the excesses of power normally associated with that institution. On the other hand, the king, who is informed by these laws, is also humility personified. Like the typical despot, the Maimonidean king's image looms over every aspect of his subjects' lives. Its effect, however, is not intended to be that of crushing and overpowering concentrated power, but quite the reverse. The office is synonymous with power. The personality, though, is projected through the prism of extreme humility and lowliness. 1. Moses as Archetype of Kingliness The figure of the king is drawn into the main discussion of the ethics of humility by the identification of Moses as the existential model of a shefal ruah. In support of this characterization is the biblical descrip- tion of Moses in Num. 12:3 as being "very humble" (anav meod), rather than merely "humble" ("Now Moses was a very humble man, more so than any other man on the earth"). Consistent with the rabbinic tradition (cf. B. Zevahim 102a; Y. Sanhedrin 1:3; Vayikrah Rabbah 31:4; Shemot Rabbah 48:4), Moses, in addition to being a prophet and lawgiver, is also identified by Maimonides elsewhere in his code as Israel's first official king (Maimonides 1998, vol. 12, 90 Laws of Temple 6:11; see also 1976, vol. 2, 169-70). The juridical context of this allusion to Moses as king is critical for determining the limits that the dictates of humility impose on absolute power. Moses's actions are here portrayed as the original ha- lakhic model for all future Temple and municipal expansions related to the city of Jerusalem (cf. B. Shevuot 15a-b). The rationale is rooted in the constraints imposed upon the kind of absolute power usually associated with a monarch by the virtue of humility. There is a space acknowledged as "holy" within the king's domain over which his supreme authority is curtailed. The borders of the Temple and Jerusalem cannot be tampered with lightly, since they occupy the uppermost limits of spatial holiness. Since other geographical spaces are less holy, any expansion of Jerusalem or the Temple would require an introduction of supplemental holiness; however, in the words of Maimonides, "the implementation of new ho- liness cannot be achieved without the supreme court ..." (Maimonides 1976, vol. 2, 104 Sanhedrin 1:5). For halakhic purposes, the holiness</page><page sequence="4">92 Journal of Religious Ethics that is immanent in the Temple and Jerusalem, unlike that in the rest of Israel, never lapses despite destruction and loss of sovereignty. This is so, he states, because its holiness uniquely attaches "as a result of the divine indwelling {shekhinah), and the shekhinah never dissipates" (Maimonides 1998, 96, Temple 6:16). Though Maimonides adopts rab- binic categories, and reasons accordingly for the sake of drawing prac- tical legal distinctions, "holiness" for him does not connote any sense of ontological otherworldliness. Once his philosophical notion of "holiness" is considered, it will become evident that the single juridical identifica- tion of Moses as king is thoroughly suffused with the principle that the preeminent check on power is humility. "Holiness" itself, for Maimonides, is a function not of an actual divine presence, but rather of human conduct (see further Kellner 2001). The sanctity of the Temple does not, and indeed cannot for Maimonides, ac- crue as a result of God having taken up residence in that location. Rather, its "holiness" and the strictly regulated entry to it are intended to instill a certain ethic. According to Maimonides's philosophical account in his Guide of the Perplexed, admission to the Temple's precinct is severely restricted so as to instill reverence for it. Most importantly, "fear will continue and an impression leading to the humility that was aimed at will be produced" (Maimonides 1963, 594 and see Kreisel 1999, 151-56 and esp. 155). Any single-handed tampering with Temple sanctity would be incongruous with the very things the Temple's sanctity represents - submission and humble servitude. All the rituals unique to the Temple, its utensils, and its services are geared, according to this account, toward neutralizing any illusions of self-importance, for when one came there [Temple] the soul was affected, so that hard hearts were softened and touched. For the deity . . . devised this gracious ruse in order that they be softened and become submissive when they came to the Temple, so that they accept God's guiding commands and fear Him . . . [Maimonides 1963, 580]. The extraordinary requirement of consensus between all branches of gov- ernment (legislative/sanhedrin; political/king; clerical/priest, prophet) prior to broadening the arena of holiness entails a public exercise of self-limitation by the king. The decision process mirrors its effect - the diffusion of holiness follows the diffusion of power. An independent ex- ecutive decision by the king on this matter would amount to an ex- ercise of power in a domain over which he has no jurisdiction. That very domain is designed to impress the virtue of humility on a national scale. Moses's self-limiting gesture with respect to this particular do- main is consistent with its very telos. The fact that it is performed in his political capacity as king sets the standard of humility for all fu- ture monarchs whose stature vis-a-vis the Temple is of a kind with their</page><page sequence="5">Maimonides on Kingship 93 subjects. In this instance absolute power is shared to dispel any hint of motivations fueled by delusions of grandeur. This very same rationale lies behind other restrictions on the king's power, most notably with re- spect to his ability to wage an elective war that is not halakhically man- dated, what is termed a "permissive war" (milhemet reshui). This type of war, which includes "expanding the borders of Israel," is waged for political or economic reasons, and requires the consent of the Sanhedrin (Maimonides 1998 vol. 23, 264-65, Kings 5:1-2; see further Kimelman 1992, 233-38). The notion that the king's relationship to the Temple is, as initiated by Moses, humility-based is intensified in the Maimonidean scheme, once the reason that the construction of the Temple is solely a royal prerog- ative is taken into account. The Guide considers the construction of the Temple as being contingent upon the appointment of a king as a prac- tical measure in the restraint of human arrogance. It is necessary for the king to spearhead its construction in order to avoid power struggles. Should the precise location of the Temple have been disclosed prior to the establishment of a regent, violent conflict would have exploded among all the tribes and nations attempting either to lay claim to it or to de- stroy its commanding prestige. Armed conflict is avoided by the king's development of the Temple Mount, since only he "would be qualified to give commands and quarrels would cease" (Maimonides 1963, 576; 1998, vol. 23, 239-40 Kings, 1:1-2). The self-limitation, which the king en- dures for the sake of widening the Temple's borders, flows directly from his original link with constructing the Temple. The pairing of king and Temple signifies the containment of violence that would be unleashed by impulses of pride and arrogance. Maimonides, in the course of his rationale for the king as Temple builder, makes reference to a historical example of precisely the type of power struggle the king's mandate is meant to avoid. The king's in- volvement is instrumental in thwarting intra-tribal civil war and pre- vents the recurrence of sedition "such as happened with regard to the priesthood" (Maimonides 1963, 576). This is an allusion to the biblical episode recounted in Numbers 16-17 of a mutiny by an Israelite no- ble, Korah, against the perceived hegemony of Aaron and Moses in the desert. The exclusive hereditary claim by Aaron and his descendants to the priestly class was under attack. The rebels' primary challenge to Moses and Aaron is expressed as an accusation of arrogance on the part of Moses and Aaron: "Why do you 'raise yourselves' [from the Hebrew root nasa] above the community of God!" (Num. 16:3). A large section of Maimonides's Guide is devoted to the explication of biblical terms that are problematic for their anthropomorphic applications to God. Through- out this lexicographical section his method is to demonstrate that bib- lical language, and language in general, is equivocal and capable of</page><page sequence="6">94 Journal of Religious Ethics different meanings in different contexts. One such term is "raise" (nasa), and this very verse, Numbers 16:3, is cited as an illustration of one of that term's equivocal, nonliteral meanings. In this context it bears the same meaning as it does when referring elsewhere to God: "eleva- tion, exalted station and great worth" (Maimonides 1963, 47). Although Maimonides's primary aim with this prooftext is to dispel any theological anthropomorphisms, at the same time he has afforded an analysis of the motivations which fueled this rebellion. It concerned class and status, which revolved around the sense of inflated self-worth, captured by the term "raise" (nasa). By drawing attention to the biblical Korah mutiny as an example of the type of conflict that is suppressed when the king throws the power of his office behind the construction of the Temple, the ethical aspect of his role is deepened and overshadows any geopolitical motivations one might normally attribute to this project. Maimonides conceived of the king as the personal embodiment of the national ethos, "for his heart is the heart of the entire congregation of Israel" (qehalyis- rael) (Maimonides 1998, vol. 23, 257, Kings 3:6) and therefore only he can initiate a war that is just: a war that is for the common good. Here Maimonides's vision of the king's role, paralleled in other religious cul- tures, is instructive for ethical discourse regarding just war theory and the sovereign's authority to initiate a jus ad helium,. As James Turner Johnston has argued in a previous issue of this Journal, seminal thinkers within the Christian tradition as well, such as Aquinas and Luther, con- sidered jus ad helium to be the sole prerogative of the sovereign. Since he alone is entrusted with maintaining the common good, he alone has the moral right to employ the sword (see further Johnson 2003, 10). Once Maimonides has established the equivocality of a biblical term, his next step is invariably to cite verses in which the "offending" term appears in relation to God and to reread the verses in consonance with its appropriate sense. The case of the term "raise" (nasa) is no exception. What is particularly striking about the two verses chosen as examples of the metaphorical sense otnasa when descriptive of God is that they are both set in the context of pride and humility manifested by God himself. The first prooftext cited is Psalms 94:2: "Rise [from the root nasa] up, judge of the earth." It is followed by the plea to "give the arrogant [geim] their deserts." In this verse then, the "rising" of God is invoked as a rem- edy for arrogance. It reflects an ethical response, not self-exaltation. The second verse cited to corroborate the metaphorical sense of "raise" with respect to God is Isaiah 57:15: "Thus saith the High, [He that is] borne on high." This verse is also strongly associated in the rabbinic tradition with humility, cited as a prooftext for the observation that "wherever one finds the awesome power of God, there he will also find His humility" (B. Megillah 31a). Once again, when read in their original biblical con- text, these words describe a God who, although high and exalted (root</page><page sequence="7">Maimonides on Kingship 95 nasa), attends to the needs of the now familiar lowly in spirit (those who are shefal ruah) by reviving them. What Maimonides has done by alluding to the Korah rebellion is to map out a route whereby a parallel is ultimately drawn between the king and God. The king, when erecting the Temple, is also performing a kind of imitatio dei. By doing so he first suppresses the "arrogant" igeim), as God Himself does in Psalms 94:2. Once the construction is complete he needs to dispel any trace of self- grandeur that may accompany his reputation as Temple builder. That is accomplished by the continual projection of his own sense of "lowliness of spirit" (shefal ruah), in the preservation of the original perimeters of the Temple and the capital city. Both are symbols of power, and their circumscription is a reminder of the king's self-restraint in the wielding of his own power. To sum up: (i) Moses is the humblest man on earth. (ii) Moses is referred to once in the Maimonidean corpus as a king, (iii) That reference is in the context of self-limitations with respect to the Temple. (iv) The royal prerogative to construct the Temple is intended to sup- press arrogance. (v) The king-temple nexus is a perpetual imitatio dei of divine humility. 2. Lowliness: An Existential Model for Majestic Humility Since the notion of imitatio dei has been introduced, it would be instructive at this point to define what precisely this entails for Maimonides. Though he considers this a legal (halakhic) imperative and divine command (Maimonides 1979, 37 positive commandment 8), in light of his negative theology, which denies the possibility of predicating any attributes of God (see also Maimonides 1963, 1:59), what is there of God that man can in fact imitate? Maimonides shifts our attempts to es- tablish God's attributes from His essence to His actions. Whenever God is said to possess some moral quality such as kindness or compassion, what such a statement really amounts to is that a natural phenomenon has been observed which would, in the sphere of human actions, flow from some such quality. The meaning of such statements about God, however, "is not that He possesses moral qualities, but that He performs actions resembling the actions that in us proceed from moral qualities ..." (Maimonides 1963, 124). Men normally exhibit moral behavior emotively, whereas God's actions strictly accord with what reason dictates is appro- priate. Genuine imitatio dei, then, is, as Herbert Davidson has so ably argued, to act morally but dispassionately (Davidson 1987). Moral virtue, for Maimonides, does not inhere in actions, but rather in internal psy- chological traits. Such psychological virtue is particularly demanded of politicians and rulers and is, therefore, critical for our understanding of</page><page sequence="8">96 Journal of Religious Ethics ideal monarchic governance. The ruler governs virtuously by approxi- mating God's governance, so that these actions may proceed from him according to a determined mea- sure and according to the deserts of the people who are affected by them and not merely because of his following a passion Sometimes with regard to some people, he should be merciful and gracious, not out of mere com- passion and pity but in accordance with what is fitting. Sometimes, with regard to some people, he should be keeping anger and jealous and aveng- ing in accordance with their deserts, not out of mere anger . . . [Maimonides 1963, 126; emphasis added]. The previous reference to Isaiah 57:15, "Thus saith the High, borne on high . . . with the lofty and holy ones I dwell and with the crushed and lowly of spirit (shefal ruah) to revive the spirit of the lowly," is critical for its identification of a class of people who are halakhically defined as "lowly of spirit" {shefal ruah), a condition we have seen previously as being held out as the extreme ideal of humility. They are predominantly those who occupy the polar opposite of the social hierarchy in relation to the king - orphans, widows, converts (Maimonides 2001, 80 Ethics 6:10; 1998, vol. 4, 432 Megillah 2:17), the impoverished (Maimonides 1998, vol. 4, 432 Megillah 2:17; vol. 10, 262 Gifts to the Poor, 10:5), and slaves (Maimonides 1998, vol. 19, 223, 344 Slaves 8:11). The verse ap- pears as a prooftext for the proposition that treating members of this class with the utmost sensitivity to their needs qualifies as imitatio dei, "for whoever gladdens the hearts of these unfortunates is likened to the divine indwelling (domeh leshekhinah) as it says 'to revive the lowly of spirit and revitalize the hearts of the downtrodden'" (Isa. 57:15). The laws governing gifts for the poor also cite this verse as setting a di- vine standard of care for those who are destitute (Maimonides 1998, 262 Gifts to the Poor 10:5), a prime illustration of the teleology of mitzvot characteristic throughout the Mishneh Torah that "shows that ritual acts, in the realm of theology or metaphysics, are also areas of ethics" (Twersky 1989, 146). The features shared by all these classes that need to be compensated for are their vulnerability and powerlessness. Or- phans and widows are deprived of their source of support. The desti- tute cannot support themselves. Converts, bearing the halakhic status of a "new born child" (cf. B. Yevamot 22a, 48b, 62a, 97b; B. Bekhorot 47a), have abandoned their native religion and their society in favor of one in which they have no family ties, in effect orphaning themselves. Slaves are chattel and exposed to the whims of their masters. Com- mon among all of them is their utter dependency on the magnanimity of others. The fact that these classes are all characterized by the expression "lowly of spirit" {shefal ruah) then allows us to focus on precisely what</page><page sequence="9">Maimonides on Kingship 97 state of being it captures - that of loss of autonomy and total reliance on others higher up in the social structure. A system which encourages a social hierarchy whose class divisions are maintained by ensuring that the "lowly" are constantly reminded of their status by those higher up asserting themselves is not only behaviorally corrupt; worse still, it has dire philosophical consequences. Because it promotes dependence of the weak upon the whims of the powerful it fosters an arrogance which sees men as either controlling or controlled. God is edged out, fostering an anthropocentric view of the world for both the oppressed and the oppres- sor. When the former look up and the latter look down, it is only man, and not God, that they perceive as ultimately in control of the world. One need only look to ancient Egypt and its belief in divine kingship for a historical manifestation of this theological distortion. The king was viewed, not merely as divinely chosen or as a deity's representative, but as an actual product of divine procreation. His intimacy with the gods rendered him the focal point of the people's wants and needs. "The king was regarded as the actual author of the fertility of the fields and of the cattle. He was also instrumental in causing the flooding of the Nile upon which . . . the very existence of Egypt depended Without the king chaos would prevail in nature and human society" (Dvornik 1966, 13; Frankfort 1948, 9-12). This view is an outgrowth of that which holds man to be the ultimate telos of the universe, a view emphatically rejected by Maimonides as leading to all kinds of confusion as to the nature of the world, the nature of God, and his governance of the world. In his words: "it should not be believed that all the beings exist for the sake of the existence of man. On the contrary, all other beings too have been intended for their own sakes and not for the sake of something else" (Maimonides 1963, 452). If everything is judged with reference to man, then God's omnipotence is undermined (Maimonides 1963, 446). Man's inflated sense of self- worth and prominence in the hierarchy of being is a primary cause of philosophical confusion about God and His relationship to the world; this confusion could be avoided "if man considered and rep- resented to himself that which exists and knew the smallness of his part in it . . ." (Maimonides 1963, 442). That is why the highest level of charity, according to Maimonides, consists of all efforts toward achieving a state of self-subsistence for desperate individuals, to the point where there is no longer any need for a "charitable" relationship - in Maimonides's words, "in order to strengthen his hand so that he will not be dependent on others and will no longer need to beg" (Maimonides 1998, vol. 10, 262 Gifts to the Poor 10:7). The notion that relationships with the powerless are informed by the dangers of anthropocentrism is reinforced by the concluding verse of Maimonides's laws of charity, "Blessed is the man that trusts in God" (Jer. 17:7) (Maimonides 1998, vol. 10, 265 Gifts to the Poor 10:19).</page><page sequence="10">98 Journal of Religious Ethics The practice, then, of self-abasement (becoming shefal ruah) that is mandated by Maimonides as the ideal form of humility consists of re- placing a human sense of autonomy with that of dependence. Once the ego is displaced, there is clarity regarding man's and the world's depen- dence on God. Those who have internally assimilated that trait gain no advantage over those who materially personify (shefal ruah), since there has been an equalization of class. Benevolence toward the needy that aspires to "gladdening" them constitutes the rarified form of imitatio dei expressed as "likened to the indwelling" (domeh leshekhinah). For Maimonides, just as "holiness" does not pertain to ontology, so God's "indwelling" (shekhinah) is not the hypostasized presence of the mys- tical tradition. It is a notional referent to God's relationship with the world, which draws on the figurative meaning of shakhan, "dwell," an- other term dealt with in Maimonides's lexicography, as "everything that is permanent and is attached to another thing" (Maimonides 1963, 55). It thereby connotes "the permanence of providence with regard to a certain matter" (Maimonides 1963, 55). As stated previously, divine governance, which translates into actions normally considered as kind or compas- sionate, actually "proceeds from Him, may He be exalted, in reference to His holy ones, not because of a passion or a change" (Maimonides 1963, 125). God acts dispassionately, and it is for that very reason that His providence is "permanently attached." There is nothing that can impact on Him to effect any change in His governance. The type of care for the less fortunate, which microcosmically reflects this cosmic relationship, is the kind which "gladdens" them because it is not tenuous or capricious. The phrase "likened to the indwelling" (domeh leshekhinah) already an- ticipates in the Mishneh Torah what Herbert Davidson has convincingly argued is the more cogently developed ethical theory of the Guide, which "directs the perfect man to crown his knowledge of God with dispassion- ate behavior in areas affecting others" (Davidson 1987, 71). The only other use of the expression "likened to the indwelling" in the Mishneh Torah corroborates this interpretation by its linkage with the ascetic behavior typical of the hasid - with respect to the trait of humility, the one who veers away from the mean to the extreme of "low- liness" shefal ruah (Maimonides 2001, 66 Ethics 1:5). Such asceticism leads to a "holiness" (qedushah) of the soul, removed from bad character traits, and holiness of the soul causes one to be likened to the indwelling (lehidamot beshekhinah) (Maimonides 1998, vol. 16, 236 Unclean Foods 16:12). The only "holiness" (qedushah) that can resemble God's is one which is attained by way of the suppression of all corporeal desires, im- pulses, and emotions so that a constant pattern of ideal conduct ensues. Here again, Moses provides the archetype of "holiness" (qedushah), as one who disengaged himself from the world of desire to the extent that "his mind became fixated on the Rock of the world . . . and he became</page><page sequence="11">Maimonides on Kingship 99 holy like the angels" (Maimonides 2001, 61 Foundations of Torah 7:6; Kreisel 1999, 151-56). He had achieved a state "in which he talks with people and is occupied with his bodily necessities while his intellect is wholly turned toward Him so that in his heart he is always in His pres- ence . . ." (Maimonides 1963, 623). Moses disavowed any attraction to the material over and above basic necessities, thus reducing himself to the state of "lowliness" (shefal ruah) of the "unfortunates." This induces a state of dependency, but, since it is intellect-driven, it is angelic in nature. "Angel" is another equivocal term dealt with by Maimonides in his Guide, whose meaning in this context is "separate intellect." The very term for angel, malakh (messenger), connotes absolute subservience; that is, "ev- eryone who carries out an order is called an angel" (Maimonides 1963, 262). They also "always do that which is good, and only that which is good with them . . ." (Maimonides 1963, 266). Analogously, Moses has achieved a supreme angel-like dependency on God through the practice of extreme humility, whose physical model is the class of people who occupy the low- est end of the social spectrum. Moses cannot act any other way because he has internalized moral virtues. Apart from the Mosaic paradigm of extreme humility, Maimonides's non-halakhic discussion of the virtue of charity once again imports the monarch into the context of the term "lowly of spirit" (shefal ruah). Char- ity requires more punctilious attention and care "than any other positive commandment," because "the throne of Israel (kisse yisrael) will never be established nor will the true religion (dat haemet) be sustained except by way of charity . . . and Israel will never be redeemed (nigalin) except through the merit of charity . . ."(Maimonides 1998, vol. 10, 261 Gifts to Poor 10:1). Maimonides, in essence, ties the realization of the messianic period to the performance of the law most involved with remedying the human condition of lowly of spirit. The benefits that flow from the ful- fillment of this command are formulated in monarchic terminology. All biblical instances of the term "throne of Israel," the vast majority of which relate to the Davidic line (cf. 1 Kings 2:4; 8:20; 8:25; 9:5; 10:9; 2 Kings 10:30; 16:12; 2 Chron. 6:10; 6:16), refer to political kingship. The expres- sion "true religion" is almost exclusively linked by Maimonides to the king's mandate in universally promoting its principles.3 "Redemption" is, of course, associated with the messianic period when the monarchy and its political sovereignty over Israel will be restored (Maimonides 1998, vol. 23, 356).4 The reason that the ultimate reward consequent 3 Maimonides 1998, vol. 14, 173 Hagigah 3:1, 6; vol. 23, 264, 355 Kings 4:10; 12:1; vol. 4, 393 Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7:4. Menachem Kellner concludes that what is intended by this expression is "Judaism" (Kellner 1991, 35-36). 4 Redemption (geulah) is most often associated with freedom from servitude; see, for example, Mishneh, Leavened and Unleavened chapters 7, 8, 9; Slaves, chapter 2.</page><page sequence="12">100 Journal of Religious Ethics upon the proper performance of charity is couched in monarchic imagery is, as will be demonstrated below, that the king's reign is assessed by his ability to command fear and respect, while at the same time projecting a personal image of extreme humility (shefal ruah). It is most appropriate then that the ethical act of redressing the malady of shefal ruah caused by material impoverishment should result in a redemption that is effected by one who has an abundance of wealth and power and yet has assimi- lated the character trait of shefal ruah into his very being.5 The king is a symbol of a freely chosen internalization of self-effacement that is so strikingly at odds with his concrete environment that it clearly reflects his liberation from it. His extreme humility then can only be interpreted as a manifestation of a purely abstract dependency on something that transcends the material. He is the mirror image of the "unfortunates" who must be liberated from their material dependency via the largess of halakhically prescribed rules of charity. 3. Biblical Images of Humility: A Monarch's Manual 3.1 Moses and manna Maimonides proceeds to offer a number of images which should be projected by the king when carrying out his official duties. Each image is drawn from a biblical precedent pertaining to some regal personality, and each challenges images of domination and subjugation commonly associated with the figure of the king. The king is advised to variously assume the demeanors of a "brother," a "servant," a "nursemaid," and a "shepherd," all of which are generated by the adoption of extreme hu- mility. David and Moses are the subjects of these biblical precedents; the former is the biblical progenitor of the divinely elected Israelite royal line, while the latter is, from the rabbinic perspective, the very first king. I shall argue that the scriptural prooftexts advancing each one of these humility types were chosen with, to borrow an expression from the Guide (Maimonides 1963, 15), "great exactness and exceeding precision," in order to address the ethical and philosophical dangers the figure of the king poses for the public. 5 For Maimonides (1963, 373), the languor and sadness of exile that prevent philosophi- cal and prophetic developments are captured in the expatriate status of the king: "Her king and princes are among the nations, the Law is no more; her prophets find no vision from the Lord" (Lam. 2:9). The despondency of exile is likened to being like a "slave in bondage to the ignorant who commit great sins and in whom the privation of true reason is united to the perfection of the lusts of beasts." Therefore the king's restoration to his throne in Israel marks the transition from a society that is intellectually vacuous and driven by physical passions to one that is the exact reverse.</page><page sequence="13">Maimonides on Kingship 101 Just as he was the example of a life of extreme humility in the Laws of Ethical Traits (Deot), Moses is presented as the example par excel- lence of the kind of humility which should be adopted by the monarch. Here, however, the biblical prooftext is different. For the general rule of extreme humility, Numbers 12:3, characterizing Moses as "very hum- ble," was the text of choice. For the monarch's humility, the text cho- sen is Exodus 16:8, which has Moses responding to the complaints of the Israelites in the desert as to their lack of food and their apprehen- sion of death by starvation. It is Moses's acerbic rebuke of "what are we (venahnu mah), your complaints are not against us ... ,"that is cited as the Mosaic emblem of "exceeding humility" for the king to follow. Having been deprived of the basic necessities of life in the desert, the people look to Moses for their sustenance. Their relationship vis-a-vis Moses is expressed, through their complaints, in terms of the destitute in need of a provider. It is precisely this situation that is most prone to the theological/philosophical error, which dependence provokes, partic- ularly when that dependence is concentrated on a solitary figure who wields ultimate human power. Exodus 16:8, then, is chosen for its ca- pacity to address both the practical and the theoretical ethical concerns of the predicament which confronted Moses, and which will inevitably confront all future kings. The self-effacing expression "what are we" {venahnu mah) already appears in the preceding verse 16:7, but only captures the practical ethics of humility. Verse 8, however, concludes with an admonition that the people's complaints are, in the final analy- sis, against God. It therefore redresses the philosophical misconceptions of anthropocentrism that absolute dependence promotes, by shifting the focus away from Moses, the man, to God. Exodus 16:8 is also carefully selected for the significance of the re- sponse elicited from God by the people's complaints. That response comes in the form of manna from heaven. Once again we see Maimonides, the great demythologizer of biblical and rabbinic myth, at work. The mythi- cal dimension of the miraculous food in the desert, manna from heaven, is replaced with a philosophical one. The Guide's analysis of manna's philosophical import renders it an apt referent for majestic humility. First, it served to publicize the idea "that those who wholly devote them- selves to His service, may He be exalted, are provided by Him with food in an unthought-of-way" (Maimonides 1963, 499). The king's sense of self-importance would thus be curbed by the acknowledgment that he, as provider, is supplanted by a higher provider; that the nourishment he supplies is superseded by another kind of food; and that a power which transcends him commands utter devotion. The allusion to manna directs the king's and the population's gaze elsewhere, to the true source of their sustenance. Second, it invokes the principal aim of charity - the eleva- tion of those on the receiving end from their state of "lowliness" (shefal</page><page sequence="14">102 Journal of Religious Ethics ruah), by way of nullifying any causes of class distinctions that engender feelings of inferiority or superiority. Discrepancies between individuals of the same species arise, Maimonides tells us, only accidentally and not essentially, and therefore "there in no way exists a relation of superiority and inferiority between individuals conforming to the course of nature ex- cept that which follows necessarily from the difference in the disposition of the various kinds of matter" (Maimonides 1963, 447). The manner of the collection of the manna, which resulted in a kind of miraculous equal- ized distribution among the people regardless of how much was actually recovered, suggests this principle: "And he that gathered much had noth- ing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating" (Exod. 16:18). This, according to Maimonides, vi- tiates the false conception that true imbalance is a function of material gain or lack: "He who has obtained these luxuries has not gained thereby an increment in his substance, he has only obtained a false imagining or a plaything. And he who lacks the superfluities of life is not necessarily deficient" (Maimonides 1963, 447). In fact, the Guide offers the king as the prime example of the most defective of perfections that are extant in man. Since the relationship between a man and his possessions is external and does not form part of his essence, it cannot be a measure of what distinguishes one individual from another; therefore, "when the relation referred to has been abolished, there is no difference between an individual who has been a great king and the most contemptible of men, though nothing may have changed in any of the things that may have been attributed to him" (Maimonides 1963, 634). Lowliness of class can only result if there is no awareness of this principle. Cognition of the essential equality of all individuals in a species precludes differentiation based on economics or politics. Exodus 16:8 speaks particularly to the king's standard of humility by raising the philosophical connotations of manna. There are no destitute or wealthy in the world conjured up by the symbol of manna. The human form (image of God) shared by all in- dividuals of the human species places them all on a level playing field in terms of their common human activity (intellectual) and common telos (the knowing of God) (Maimonides 1963, 21-23). 3.2 Nursemaid It is fitting that the other image cited from Moses's biography also relates to the manna. In this instance, however, there is a rejection of the manna by the people. The king is admonished to "tolerate their trou- bles, burdens, complaints and anger 'as a nurse carries an infant.'" The nursemaid image is culled from Numbers 11:12, Moses's indignant de- scription of himself in response to the people's contempt for the manna. The response reveals a frustration with the onerous responsibility with</page><page sequence="15">Maimonides on Kingship 103 which he has been delegated. By his appropriation of this image, Moses argues that he should not be expected to play the role of nursemaid, since he has not "conceived" or "given birth" to the nation. God accommo- dates Moses's rhetorical protestations against the assumption of unas- sisted political leadership with a diffusion of power among seventy elders (Num. 11:16). This power distribution is accomplished through the draw- ing of "spirit" from Moses that is then bestowed upon the group of seventy, resulting in a wide delegation of national authority. Critical to grasping the full significance of the nursemaid exemplar for the king is that its biblical context is also the source for the establishment of a quorum of seventy-one on the supreme court, known as the Sanhedrin (Maimonides 1998, vol. 22, 24-25 Sanhedrin 1:3, 6 and B. Sanhedrin 16b). Admonish- ing the king to adopt this model thus reminds him that his regime is not an autocratic one. Moses was right in one sense and wrong in another. The dangers of an autocracy are the kinds of anthropocentric conclu- sions which can ensue, and which are captured in the ideas of "conceiv- ing" and "giving birth" to the nation. The presence of other institutions such as judicial bodies is needed to dispel any such "misconceptions." On the other hand, the ethical posture that the nursemaid image engen- ders is endorsed in order to foster an internal sense of humility in the king. The nursemaid model is one which the king in fact shares with any- one who occupies a position of authority. Elsewhere in Maimonides's code, those in authority are exhorted to "tolerate the troubles of the commu- nity and their burdens just like Moses our master of whom it is writ- ten, 'just as a nurse carries an infant'" (Maimonides 1998, vol. 22, 231 Sanhedrin 25:2). Maimonides emphasizes the same model in particular for the judiciary, who are adjured to "tolerate the community 'just as a nurse carries an infant'" (Maimonides 1998, vol. 22, 231 Sanhedrin 25:2). The shared nursemaid ideal induces both the king and the judiciary to look to each other when administering their respective functions, as a constant check on their supremacy. It also induces them to look back toward the Mosaic inception of the ideal: (i) A rejection by Moses of totalitarian governance; (ii) A dispersion and sharing of power; (iii) A diffusion of power that is clearly generated by God.6 6 Adjudicatory pronouncements by the Sanhedrin are not made ex cathedra and are therefore fallible. A. Altmann argues that this is an essential distinction between the Sanhedrin of Judaism and the Church of Christianity: "The Sanhedrin is not a 'sacral authority' like the church It is rather . . . halakhic agency, receiving its sanction only through the single fact of being appointed by the Torah, but not through an actual pneu- matic relation to the word of God" (Altmann 1991, 46).</page><page sequence="16">104 Journal of Religious Ethics Once again, a state of lowliness is an instrumental motivation for nurse-like tolerance. Those who wield power may be tempted to assert that power without regard for those who are subordinate to them be- cause of their lower social status. Nonetheless, "although they are ple- beian and lowly (shefalim), they are the children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and the hosts of God who liberated them from Egypt with great power (koah gadol) and a strong hand" (Maimonides 1998, vol. 22, 231, Sanhedrin 25:2). Their lowliness is neutralized by common national ori- gins (when all were relegated to serfdom) and the acknowledgment of where real power {koah) is ultimately located. Both the king and the members of the court become historically and theologically submerged into the lowliness of their constituents. Elsewhere, Maimonides consid- ers the supreme court (Sanhedrin) to be the embodiment of "the assembly of Israel in its entirety," thereby expressing the national will in its deci- sions (Maimonides 1976, vol. 2, 308 Horayot 1:6).7 Prompting the king to reflect on the Sanhedrin therefore promotes an equalization of classes, since it is, in effect, another concrete instance of the identity between the governed and the governor. The model serves as a prototype for the req- uisite merging of hearts between the king and the people that we have noted previously. 3.3 Brother Another model for royal humility is the assumption of the demeanor of a "brother," as David did when delivering his parting speech; there he addressed the people as "my brothers and my nation" (1 Chron. 28:2). He then offered a rationalization for not having built a Temple for God during his tenure as king, and entrusts its construction to his son and suc- cessor, Solomon. For Maimonides, this gesture of humility also appeals to the philosophical problems raised by the absence of a Temple during David's reign. The Temple is a spatial focal point whose raison d'etre is the effacement of idolatrous notions of God and the establishment of "the existence and oneness of the deity" in its place (Maimonides 1963, 526- 27). In addition, as discussed above, the royal prerogative to construct the Temple was itself an act ofimitatio dei, in its quelling of the grand desires of those who would lay claim by violence to the Temple Mount to boost their own stature. Sharing space with the Temple also reflected the king's "lowliness of spirit" (shefal ruah). Dealing with the anthropomorphically problematic term "throne" (kisse), the Guide traces the evolution of this 7 G. Blidstein quotes other examples where the phrases "according to the opinion of the majority of Israel" and "according to the high court" are used interchangeably (Blidstein 1981, 247 n. 620). Rabbi J. B. Soloveitchik is credited as the source of this insight.</page><page sequence="17">Maimonides on Kingship 105 term from its meaning as a literal throne to a metaphorical one of rank by way of its association with people of "great authority such as kings" (Maimonides 1963, 34). Therefore, greatness and sublimity are what is intended by the term whenever it refers to God. "Throne," then, is a term which, though sharing a common notion of "rank," marks a clear divide between a king and God. The Sanctuary is called a throne in the Bible "because of its indicating the grandeur of Him who manifested Himself therein ..." and is a place "singled out to receive His light and splendour" (Maimonides 1963, 34). The reference to David's courteous salutation is not endorsed merely for its etiquette, but for its contextual implications. The Temple is the throne of God. The throne of the king is a concrete metaphor for that Being which occupies the highest rank in existence. Without the actual physical Temple, the king's throne is apt to be wrongly perceived as the seat of the highest authority. David's speech, in its ex- planation of the missing Temple, provides both the ethical and the philo- sophical precedents out of which the king must fashion his own image of humility. 3.4 Slave The next verse cited encourages the king to assume the posture of a "slave" vis-a-vis his subjects. The context is the advice offered to king Rehabam, the son and successor to Solomon, by his council of elders as to how to manage the royal office. Rather than an ironfisted approach, they urge him to be sensitive to the people's needs: "and if today you will be a slave (eved) to this people and serve them and respond to them and speak with them good words then they will be forever your slaves" (1 Kings 12:7). The mutual enslavement of king and people is reflected in the royal power to impose taxation. The obligation to comply with the king's taxation arises from the verse "and you will be slaves to him" (1 Sam. 8:17). However, that power is subject to the strict limitations dictated by the rule of law (Maimonides 1998, vol. 23, 260 Kings 4:1; vol. 17, 346-47 Theft and Lost Property 5:12-14). The slave model once again directs the king toward the adoption of "lowliness" when assert- ing his power over the people. In his codification of the laws of slavery, Maimonides offers a novel rationale for the law, not found in its original rabbinic source:8 a master must not treat a Hebrew slave (eved ivri) as a slave, but rather as a hired laborer. The traumatic effects of being sold 8 This idea is found biblically in Lev. 25:39-40; see also Sifra, Behar 7:2; B. Yevamot 46a; and B. Bava Metzia 73b. The slave reference is also a continuation of the "brother" reference. The Sifra picks up on the words of Lev. 25:39, "And should your brother become impoverished," as indicating that, though he is your slave, he remains your brother and is deserving of brotherly treatment.</page><page sequence="18">106 Journal of Religious Ethics as chattel are demeaning "because his soul has been lowered (nafsho shefelah) as a result of the sale" (Maimonides 1998, vol. 19, 226; Slaves 1:7). The contrast to the much harsher treatment permitted by Maimonides in the case of a laborer who has not been purchased is most instructive in determining precisely what it is that constitutes this feel- ing of despair captured by the phrase "lowliness of soul." Imposing slave- like demands on the laborer is sanctioned "because he performs this work of his own free will and knowledge" (Maimonides 1998, vol. 19, 226; Slaves 1:7). "Lowliness," then, is a consequence of the total loss of auton- omy and of the ability to control one's destiny, and the inevitable sense of utter dependence upon others. The adverse theological implications of being surrendered to the total control of other men are neutralized by regulations that prohibit capitalizing on the deeply felt "lowliness" of the slave. By projecting his own sense of enslavement to the people, the king promotes their sense of autonomy, and inhibits the anthropocentrism that would be fostered if he were viewed as an autocrat. 3.5 Shepherd Finally, it is the humility of a shepherd that is held out as the king's role model. Two verses are cited in support of the particular affinity between the shepherd and the king. One demonstrates that the Bible deemed the king a shepherd, and one defines what kind of conduct is to be expected by assuming the role of a shepherd. The former is a pastoral metaphor for the divine election of David to the throne, "to shepherd Jacob, His people" (Ps. 78:71). Since this excerpted part of the verse is preceded in its biblical setting by verses 70-71, "And He chose David His servant and He took him from the sheepfolds, from following ewes (alot) He brought him . . . ," Maimonides's prooftext has drawn the anal- ogy between the founder, and thereby the paragon, of the Hebrew monar- chy, and the shepherd, "one of the oldest appellations for kings in the ancient Near East" (Brettler 1989, 36-37). The verse accentuates the source of David's (and therefore the monarch's) authority by a threefold repetition of his investiture by God: He "chose," He "took," and He "brought."9 The king's subordinate status is conveyed by the refer- ences to his servitude to God (His "servant") and to his common origins ("sheepfolds"). The king's proprietorship over the people is denied by the acknowledgment of where ownership actually resides ("Jacob, His 9 The verse is the basis of a midrashic nexus between David's shepherding, and Moses as the archetypical pastoral leader in Exodus 3:1. Moses's humility is so extreme that it moves him to place an exhausted kid on his shoulders. See Shemot Rabbah 2:3.</page><page sequence="19">Maimonides on Kingship 107 people" followed by "Israel, His patrimony").10 Shepherding, according to Maimonides, has also been the historical occupation of Israel from its inception, "all of us being shepherds from fathers and grandfathers" (Maimonides 1963, 552). A metaphor and a verse have been deliberately selected to convey a sameness between king and people, which transposes their immediate political context of sovereign/subject into a theological one.11 Conduct that is emblematic of the shepherd is "explicated in the tra- dition," and can be determined by the final of the series of verses encour- aging royal humility cited at the end of Chapter 2 of the Laws of Kings: "Like a shepherd he shepherds his flock, he gathers lambs with his arm and carries them in his lap, he leads the ewes (alot)" (Isa. 40:11). What is critical about this prooftext is that it is a metaphorical representa- tion of God. Maimonides has seamlessly moved from a Davidic reference to a godly one, thereby constructing a divine standard of humility that the king must emulate. The gist of divine shepherding is extraordinary care for the weakest part of the flock, the ewes and lambs, conveyed by a threefold repetition of the tending they warrant: "gathers," "carries," and "leads." The shepherd simile articulates in pastoral imagery the ex- treme humility that we have seen is mandatory in behavior toward the lowly of spirit. The king is judged by the extent to which he has been able to manifest this behavior, which in turn is a reflection of a promi- nent trope of God as shepherd. As Brettler has shown, the metaphorical application of "shepherd" to God as king works to "reverse certain of the typical entailments of the shepherd sub-metaphor"; for example, the shepherd's crook, a symbol of royalty in Mesopotamian art, is an instru- ment of comfort rather than oppression in Psalms 80:4 (Brettler 1989, 37). The evocation of this image by the king's conduct prompts his sub- jects to follow the routes mapped out by the shepherd prooftexts which originate in God (He "chose," "took," "brought"), and lead back to the same source by its conception as a form ofimitatio dei. The figure of the mortal king is ultimately, for Maimonides, the model for behavior vis-d-vis God. Since the king commands great reverence, "he who chooses to achieve human perfection and to be in true reality a man of God must give heed and know that the great king who always accompanies him and cleaves to him is greater than any human individual, even if the latter be David and Solomon" (Maimonides 1963, 629). The king is useful insofar as he directs one's mind toward the Supreme King. 10 It is clear that the possessive suffix refers to God by virtue of v.62 of this psalm, as well as such verses as Deuteronomy 32:9. 11 In Psalms 78, God is first portrayed as a shepherd (v.52) rendering the concluding shepherding metaphor a model of imitatio dei. For other biblical representations of God as shepherd, see Gen. 48:15; 49:24; Jer. 31:7-9; Ezek. 34; Ps. 23; 80:2.</page><page sequence="20">108 Journal of Religious Ethics 4. Imperial Humility: An Existential Model of Imitatio Dei In his adoption of the Maimonidean guidelines for extreme humility, the king - in addition to constraining his own natural inclinations toward aggrandizement - acts as the existential model supreme for imitatio dei. Imperial governance, when filtered through the prism of Maimonidean humility, results in a regime that most closely resembles a divine one. Here, once again, the precedent of Moses is most instructive, especially in light of what Maimonides tells us he discovers at the very apex of hu- man enlightenment. Though Moses's request for a vision of divine glory (kavod) is denied (Exod. 33:18), his appeal to be shown the divine "way" (derekh) is granted (Exod. 33:13). Maimonides's distinction between the nature of these two requests is critical for our appreciation of the king's administration. The former, "apprehension of His essence," lies beyond human attainment, while the latter "way" consists of "pure attributes of action" (Maimonides 1963, 124). What is revealed to Moses is the man- ner in which God governs the world. That governance does not proceed from "moral qualities" or "aptitudes of the soul"; rather, "He performs actions resembling the actions that in us proceed from moral qualities" (Maimonides 1963, 124). 12 All those actions we normally ascribe to pas- sions such as mercy, grace, jealousy, or anger are all precisely and ob- jectively calibrated "in accordance with what is fitting" (Maimonides 1963, 126). Though Moses may have acted appropriately up until this point, his behavior may not have qualified as imitatio dei, since it might have been passionate behavior. From the moment God's way is revealed, his governance is more likely to be modeled on God's and he will act "as it behooves a governor of a city ... so that these actions may proceed from him according to the deserts of the people who are affected by them and not merely because of his following a passion" (Maimonides, 126).13 Moses, in effect, has perfected his monarchy and, at the same time, become the exemplar of that which Maimonides terms deot, or an ethics based on imitatio dei. This may account for the very word deot, coined by Maimonides in his legal compendium as the term of art for ethical traits. The traits Maimonides wants us to assimilate are those that were revealed to Moses as a result of his request in Exodus 33:13: "let me 12 S. Rosenberg notes a distinction between the Mishneh's discussion of the deot, which is "directed to people in general," and that of the Guide, which "encompasses the quality of judgment as well, in the context of the need to guide leaders" (Rosenberg 2001, 8 n. 21). Though I would agree, my analysis leads ultimately to collapsing of this distinction. 10 Even the expression of an emotion such as "hate" can be an act of imitatio dei; see Josef Stern's explanation of the mechanics of "hate" with respect to the nation of Amalek, an emotion with which the king in particular must inspire his subjects to battle (Stern 2001, 394-99).</page><page sequence="21">Maimonides on Kingship 109 know (hodieni) Your way that I may know You." The term he uses to characterize the laws of moral virtues is quite strategically a term that is based on the same root as the term "to know." We now know why. Moral virtue is associated with the internal psyche, not with the ex- ternal act. Ethical traits that truly emulate God's attributes of action constitute the knowledge granted to Moses in response to his entreaty to know. Passionless activity can only arise when there is no self to be impassioned, and that is the function of the self-effacement demanded by extreme humility. By tempering his governance with humility the king in some way fashions his administration along the lines of Moses and the Patriarchs, whose focus was solely on God even as they "engaged in increasing their fortune . . . while they tended their cattle, did agricul- tural work, and governed their household . . ." (Maimonides 1963, 624). 14 All these activities that are normally perceived as motivated by self- interest are transformed into disinterested acts calculated to galvanize "a religious community that would know and worship God" (Maimonides 1963, 624). When his subjects observe him, the king is a beacon of ethics that are intellectually grounded and God-oriented, transforming even "increasing fortune" into an integral aspect of emulating God. That ob- servation, in turn, will inform their own ethics, raising them from simple, albeit commendable, moral qualities, to the imitatio dei contemplated by Maimonides's deot. 5. The "Way" to the Utopian King The legacy of the "golden mean" is what links the inception of Jewish history by Abraham with its consummation by the messianic king. Maimonides assigns the phrase "the way of God" (derekh YHVH) to the teaching of the ethical mean, since God himself is scripturally charac- terized by those attributes which comprise the median path (compassion- ate, merciful, holy, etc.) "and it is what Abraham taught to his children" (Maimonides 2001, 67 Ethics 1:7).15 It is that very teaching which will mark the culmination of Jewish history, with its dissemination by the 14 Lawrence Kaplan, in his analysis of this state, argues convincingly that Moses's "authorship" of the Law constitutes an act of imitatio dei par excellence, in that Mosaic Law "is a perfect imitation in political terms of the ideal cosmic law cognized by Moses. Through this act of legislation Moses governs the people, his political governance of the community imitating God's divine cosmic governance of man" (Kaplan 1990, 139-40). 15 "Since the Creator is referred to by those terms which constitute the middle way in which we are obligated to walk, this path is called the "way of God" (derekh YHVH)" The verse from which the command of imitatio dei is derived is "And you shall walk in His ways" (Deut. 28:9), which Maimonides equates with the "median" (benonim) characteristics (Deut. 1:5). Therefore, the "way of God" refers to those "ways" of Deut. 28:9.</page><page sequence="22">110 Journal of Religious Ethics messianic king "who will arise from the seed of David, possessing more wisdom than Solomon, who will be almost as great a prophet as Moses, and therefore will teach the entire nation and instruct them in the 'way of God' (derekh YHVHf (Maimonides 2001, 214 Repentance 9:2). All of Jewish history between these two critical junctures consists of a contin- uous series of the same teaching, beginning with Isaac and then Jacob, whose final legacy to his children shortly before his death was to "admon- ish them as to the unification of the Name and the 'way of God' (derekh YHVH) in which Abraham and Isaac his father walked . . ." (Maimonides 1998, vol. 2, 21 Reading of Shema 1:4). The intellectual and ethical her- itage of the patriarchs is then passed on by Jacob to all his sons; but in particular, it is Levi and his descendants who are commissioned "to teach the 'way of God' (derekh YHVH)" in perpetuity (Maimonides 2001, 218 Idolatry 1:3). Each king anticipates the ideal messianic king through the manner in which he rules his kingdom. By adopting the ethics of extreme humility he preserves the transmission of the core teaching of "the way of God," which conveys an ethical imitatio dei that is anchored in intellection. A royal ethic, which neutralizes grandeur and dominance with lowli- ness, will naturally culminate in the Utopian administration of the mes- sianic polity, which minimizes control and maximizes freedom. As Franz Rosenzweig has incisively commented, it is precisely a moment of hu- miliation that brings to David "who just then is for the first and only time in his life addressed as 'Messiah' (2 Sam. 19:22), the realiza- tion that he is finally and in truth 'king over Israel'" (2 Sam. 19:23; Rosenzweig 2000, 167). The notion that rabbinic and prophetic yearning for the messianic era was fueled by visions of domination is emphatically dispelled by Maimonides in a pointed denial of any such motivations. Their messianic longings arose "... not in order to rule the entire world, and not so that they would subjugate the nations, and not so that the na- tions would exalt them . . . but in order that they would be free to pursue Torah and its wisdom" (Maimonides 1998, vol. 23, 355-56 Kings 12:4). What nurtures this freedom is an environment in which all the social, eco- nomic, and geopolitical factors normally necessitating a king are absent, for "in that time there will be no hunger and no war and no jealousy or rivalry, goodness will be abundant and all luxuries will be as common as earth" (Maimonides 1998, vol. 23, 356, Kings 12:5).16 The ethics of king- ship intended to counteract the theological perils of dependence on the 16 For similar descriptions of the Utopian messianic polity, see Maimonides 1963, 341; 1976, vol. 2, 223-24, Eduyot 8:7 and Halkin 1985, 222-23. Joel Kraemer asserts that "Maimonides perceived a correlation between normalcy, tranquility, political freedom, and relief from the burdens of Exile on the one hand and intellectual splendor on the other" (Kraemer 1984, 139).</page><page sequence="23">Maimonides on Kingship 111 king reach their zenith in the messianic era, where the king can virtually be dispensed with. Kingship has weaned itself out of existence. I do not mean here that the office of the king will become vacant during the mes- sianic period, but only that the ideal king is one who presides over a king- dom in which there are no political concerns, only religious/philosophical ones.17 The king is the most prominent exemplar of what is in essence the human condition. He must struggle to promote the integrity of his office while, at the same time, averting any public perception that the office is self-serving. Every stratum of the social spectrum, except the lowest, those halakhically designated by Maimonides as the "lowly of spirit" (shefal ruah), finds itself faced with the same struggle. Most vulnerable to the allure of power and grandeur is the king, who must look to the shefal ruah for guidance as to what constitutes the requisite degree of humility for counteracting that allure. By internalizing the posture of ex- treme humility emblematic of the shefal ruah class, he in turn becomes the existential model for a universal ethic of humility that trickles down through each successive level of society. It is only then that his king- ship can strike the proper balance between supreme power and supreme submission necessary to project an image consistent with the essential Maimonidean definition of a king "over whom no man from Israel can exercise any authority and above whom there is none in his kingdom ex- cept the Lord his God" (Maimonides 1998, vol. 14, 364 Unintentional Sin 15:6). Every gaze downward is a reflex of a gaze upward. This ideal of monarchic governance is captured by the rabbinic legend of David wak- ing each night at the stroke of midnight, and then studying Torah until the break of dawn, at which time he would attend to the affairs of state (B. Berakhot, 3b). Considering the Maimonidean ethics of kingship, we have examined he would have cited with approval Emmanuel Levinas's epitomization of this tradition as a portrait of "a double life in order to remake the unity of life. The political action of each passing day begins in an eternal midnight and derives from a nocturnal contact with the Absolute" (Levinas 1994, 181).18 17 Gershon Weiler similarly argues that the messianic kingdom is not a "sovereign" one, but a "holy" one. The state of universal political calm is considered by him to be nothing short of miraculous and he thus concludes, "The Messianic age, although politically conceived, serves no political ideal" (Weiler 1988, 161). 18 On this statement of Levinas, I quote a most perceptive comment by an anonymous reader of this paper: "The 'double life' which Levinas mentions here isn't simply the dou- ble life of war and Torah, but also the double life of the practical and the theoretical as- pects of human perfection, in which the individual (by virtue of extirpating psychological characteristics) can simultaneously contemplate God and govern."
