<plain_text><page sequence="1">Scientific-Technological Change and the Role of Women in Development. Pamela M. D'Onofrio-Flores and Sheila M. Pfafflin, eds. Boulder: Westview Press, 1982. xvii + 206 pp. $25.00 (cloth). June Nash City College of the City University of New York This collection of articles on women in scien- tific and technological change is the product of an "informal" research group organized by the United Nations Institute for Training and Re- search. The tone and language of the publica- tions are characteristic of most United Nations publications, particularly in the introduction by Davidson Nicol proclaiming the success of UNITAR in getting conferences going and plans drawn up, and the penultimate chapter on consciousness raising in international forums. In these chapters we find the excessive use of hortatory injunctions, the tendency to hypostatize the Third World/First World dichotomy, and the invocation of a New Eco- nomic Order and a World Community without making reference to monopoly capitalism or the dynamic of capital accumulation. Included among the working papers, how- ever, are some insightful commentaries inter- spersed with succinct summaries of investiga- tions that have focused on women that make it worth pursuing. The papers differ in theoretical orientation regarding development, but most agree that development has had a negative im- pact on women. The leading article by Pamela M. D'Onofrio-Flores objects to the develop- mentalist assumption of progress inherent in sophisticated technology that disregards an equitable distribution of rewards. Maria Bergom-Larsson shows that even in Sweden, which many people consider the most advanced industrial country in its welfare programs, economic policies fail to take account of women's reproductive roles, and women have not participated in the critical decisions concerning technology. Zenebeworke Tadese pursues this theme of the failure to integrate women one step further: she questions whether development even succeeds in integrating men. Mangalam Srinivasan objects to the prevalent national ideology of Mexico which regards science as neutral without considering the systematic exclusion of women from jobs in the advanced scientific and technological in- dustries. The consensus on the negative impact of technology is not maintained, however, in the authors' analyses of why it has come about. D'Onofrio-Flores relies on the explanatory force of dependent development. She draws upon Madeira and Singer's book, Estructurado Em- pregoe Trabalho Feminino Brasil (CEBRAP 1975) with its three-stage analysis of female par- ticipation in the labor force. This approach tends to crystalize past trends as necessary stages, ignoring historical particularism and the dialectical process. While it is true that women and children were the majority of the work force in England and the United States as well as some other developing countries such as Brazil, it is not predictive for all cases. It does not help us when we look at Zambia, where Karen Hansen's article, "The Urban Informal Sector as a Development Issue" (Urban Anthropology 1981), shows that women are excluded from most wage employment including the service sector at the take-off point in development when they should be most engaged. Nor can we appreciate the dilemma of women in Botswana, as Ducomin explains in an article in Women at Work (ILO 1980) or in Soweto, as Barbara Rogers shows in her book, White Wealth and Black Poverty (Greenwood Press 1976). In both these areas, women are abandoned in reserva- tion areas, working in a declining subsistence economy, as their men are forced to migrate to the mines and plantations. Contrasts in the ways in which women participate in the work force even within a region sharing many cultural premises about women's roles indicate the danger of reifying past trends as necessary laws. In the Middle East, for example, the participa- tion of women in industry varied widely in dif- ferent nations and among different economic</page><page sequence="2">152 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [85, 1983] classes within the same nation, despite shared ideological premises about the segregation of the sexes. Lower-class women comprise the ma- jority of textile workers in Egypt; in Turkey, women are in the forefront of export processing production; while in Mauritania, girls are still fattened up for marriage. The kind of reasoning implicit in the Madeira and Singer model as modified by D'Onfrio-Flores (p. 19) is a devel- opmental imperative that "causes a large number of people to leave localized community and home production and at the same time there is a migration from rural to urban areas which tends to cause the number of women in productive activities to decrease." This in turn is followed by a third phase when there is an in- crease in the tertiary sector. To which one can only respond Sometimes and in some places it does and sometimes not, and the interesting questions would revolve around the cases which conform to the model and those which fail to respond as predicted. The tendency to freeze a particular phase of an historical process in one country or even several countries experiencing similar rates of capital accumulation will not help us answer these questions. The third phase in Madeira and Singer's model, that of an increase of women employed in the service sector, has already been surpassed by a fourth trend in the export production in- dustries employing predominantly young women. Srinivas examines this phase in her critique of Mexican national policy. Border in- dustrialization absorbs a young, female labor force in such a way as to distort "traditional family roles" without integrating women in an employment cycle that lasts beyond their mid-20s and provides few transferable skills. However, even in this notable attempt to deal with the current situation, the analysis falls into a technological determinism that obscures the processes at work: It is a generally accepted proposition that domination has come to Mexico not only through technology but as technology. "Mod- ernization" and technology have assigned a limited, residual role to women in work. (p. 119) Such anthropomorphic reasoning about tech- nology obscures the power relations in produc- tion. As Noble, in his book America by Design (Oxford 1977) and others have shown, technol- ogy is designed to reinforce dominance by the lites. Furthermore, Srinivas's limited appraisal of the literature reduces the impact of her analysis. To say that "the analysis of the (ma- quiladora) situation is rendered especially dif- ficult due to the lack of any kind of concepts, hypotheses, or theories on the question of women in production" (p. 133), is to reveal the failure to incorporate a very large and growing body of literature. M. Patricia Fernandez Kelly's thesis on the runaway shop sets the phenomenon in a national and international context. The work of Rachel Grossman, Linda Lim, Robert Snow, and many others (see cita- tions in June Nash and M. Patricia Fernandez Kelly, Women, Men and the International Divi- sion of Labor, SUNY Press, forthcoming) has shown the cumulative effects of offshore sourc- ing. Others, notably Frobel, Heinrichs, and Kreye, in their book The International Division of Labor (Cambridge 1978) have put the emerg- ing pattern in global perspective. This literature was available when the book being reviewed was in production and more is developing each day. Another problem emerges in the provocative piece by Bergom-Larson. Following a very strong and telling indictment of Swedish in- dustrial policies in its heavy commitment to ex- cessive capital costs, she moves on to an analysis of male and female culture that confuses both the concept culture and the qualities inherent in gender. The opposition of these "two cultures faced off against each other, the one designed by the demands of the production apparatus, and the other grown out of reproduction," ex- plains, she maintains, "why women have had such a hard time holding their own in the world of work and policies." The antithesis of male and female culture negates the historical pro- cess by which gender roles developed. It denies the possibility of a solution within a bisexual production system. Her analysis of change in the "reproductive activities" of nursing and education as they became dominated by "male" bureaucratic institutions could, if cast in another theoretical framework, illuminate the contradictions in production for exchange and profit; instead it is limited to an excoriation of men and technology. The question of what is true of women as women and what is true of people caught up in an industrial mode of production is better handled in Tadese's article, "Women and Tech- nology in Peripheral Countries." She points out that while women bear a greater share of the burden of malnutrition, high infant mortality, unsafe water, lack of health services, and abject poverty, these are endemic in underdeveloped societies. She turns to historical explanations to</page><page sequence="3">APPLIED 153 explain the particular features of the incorpora- tion of the periphery into the world market. Her hypothesis "that expansion in industry exerts a preferred demand for male labour while female employment continues to be concentrated in tertiary employment" (p. 94) tends to freeze a trend that is already changing as a determined stage. The exciting thing about the scholarship focusing on women was that it opened up an in- quiry into the dialectics of power relationships in a constantly changing world. This anthology, insofar as one can generalize about it, fails to maintain the theoretical level reached by earlier inquiries. By reifying concepts and crystalizing trends as stages, the articles fail to clarify the processes whereby dominance hierarchies, whether of gender, class, or ethnicity, are generated and maintained.</page></plain_text>
