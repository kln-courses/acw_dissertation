<plain_text><page sequence="1">WOLFGANG YOURGRAU AND ALWYN VAN DER MERWE DID ERNST MACH 'MISS THE TARGET'? During visiting hours at St. Joseph's Hospital in Denver, Colorado, where George Gamow was confined for several months, we discussed with him - under his prodding and to cheer him up ! - some recalcitrant issues in current theoretical physics and cosmology. One day, after the medical crisis was over and followed by days of wonder, gratitude, and optimism, Gamow remarked, in a biographical aside, that he had tried time and again to apply Machian ideas (especially Mach's Principle), but found that they simply did not work. This seemed like an apposite moment to raise the question whether Mach's renowned definition of mass was merely a historical curiosity, signifying nothing more than an interesting imagi nary experiment, or whether indeed it represents a logically superior, as well as practically (physically) significant, improvement over Newton's admittedly inadequate definition. We argued pro Mach and contra New ton as best we could without prior preparation, but Gamow, proving a formidable lawyer for the defence, remained unimpressed. We retreated to our offices, there to brood on the more precise nature of our convic tions, which turned out to be as partial to Mach as ever. In committing our conclusions to paper, for this symposium, we remembered for your amusement an isolated remark of Gamow that 'mach' (or maybe it was a word sounding like it) means in Russian: to fail in an attempt, to miss the target ! This, it had to be explained, is the background for the rather puzzling title we have chosen for our paper. A. MASS IN NEWTONIAN MECHANICS To set the stage for a proper appreciation of Mach's achievement later on, we shall in the first part of this paper briefly examine the fashion in which mass enters into the Newtonian formulation of the principles of classical mechanics. In the opening paragraph of his Principia (1687), Newton stated his definition of mass as follows1: 234 Synthese 18 (1968) 234-250. ? D. Reidel Publishing Co., Dordrecht - Holland</page><page sequence="2">DID ERNST MACH 'MISS THE TARGET'? The quantity of matter is the measure of the same, arising from its density and bulk [volume] cojointly. Newton apparently regarded density as a fundamental physical quantity, which, like the remaining fundamental quantities length and time, could be ascertained by some independent procedure - but which remains a mystery. In truth, it must be admitted that we know of no way of defining density other than as mass per unit volume. It is therefore clear that Newton's definition is circular and in consequence of no value whatsoever. The need for an operational definition of mass is pressing in mechanics because of the appearance of this quantity in Newton's second 'axiom' or 'law of motion' ; without a definite prescription for measuring mass, this law loses its potentiality for accurately predicting the motion of planets and other classical bodies it purports to describe. From the Principia1 we quote: LAW II: The change of motion [momentum] is proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed. In the customary notation of modern texts, this law can be written as F=d(m\)/dt, or, if non-relativistic velocities are presupposed, F = mr. Newton believed the acceleration r to be measured relative to absolute space - now a thoroughly discredited concept. In updating Newton for the purpose of our discussion, we stipulate that r is measured relative to an inertial frame of reference, where the latter, if it exists, is taken to be defined by Newton's first law of motion1: LAW I : Every body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed on it. In other words, an inertial frame of reference is one in which bodies not acted on by forces will move with vanishing acceleration ; and we shall leave aside here the question how the absence of forces is to be inferred. From the time of Newton until the present day, many authors, while realizing the futility of defining mass as 'quantity of matter', attempted none the less to save the integrity of Newtonian mechanics - which, after all, had been applied with such spectacular success to the motions of bodies in our solar system - by turning to the second law for an implicit definition of mass. One may indulge in the following speculation. Assume, 235</page><page sequence="3">WOLFGANG YOURGRAU AND ALWYN VAN DER MERWE for the sake of argument, that both the acceleration r (a purely kinematic quantity) and the force F have been defined independently; then the second law allows us to define the mass m as the ratio of force to acceler ation. On this view, the same observations that would lead one to con clude that F is proportional to r, would also enable one to compute the mass, so that mass definition and acceleration law become inextricably linked with one another. This is a sound argument. But is its main premiss, to wit, that force is understood and has been independently defined, tenable? A favorite method of settling this point, particularly in text books for beginning students of mechanics, originated with Andrade.2 It takes the qualitative anthropomorphic idea of force as a push or pull exerted by muscles, and tries to render it quantitative by measuring the elongation it calls forth in a thread or spring. Imagine, to be more definite, a massless spring whose one end is attached to the body being studied. On the other end of the spring a hand pulls with enough strength to extend the spring by any multiple N (not necessarily integral) of some small length x0 (arbi trarily chosen to represent unit force). Then a force Nx0 is said to act on the body. Now, obviously, a spring of zero mass does not exist, and the measure ments of extension are liable to lack precision. But more serious than such practical objections are the following considerations of a fundamental na ture. First, the assumption that every force exerted by the hand is transmit ted without change to the body, tacitly rests on Newton's third law1 - LAW III: To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or, the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts. - which is thus stripped of its status as an experimental truth and made part and parcel of the definition of force ! Secondly, forces, to be meas urable, must be communicated to the bodies they act upon through identical springs, or springs that have been calibrated in terms of these: and yet we know that most forces - gravitational, electromagnetic, etc. - are not transmitted in that fashion. It must be concluded that the 'thread school'3 fails to come up with an independent (of Newton's laws) and generally applicable definition of force and thus with a universal definition of mass. 236</page><page sequence="4">DID ERNST MACH 'MISS THE TARGET'? Other teachers of mechanics, more concerned with experimental efficiency than with logical development of their subject, have believed that a satis factory definition of mass can be found by weighing with an analytical balance. Their prescription is : on its left-scale pan place the body whose mass m is desired, and balance it against known fractions or multiples of a standard body (chosen to represent the unit of mass) on its right scale pan; m will then equal the combined mass m0 of the bodies on the right-scale pan. Their reason for using this method is as follows. The weights W and W0 of, respectively, the body on the left-scale pan and the bodies on the right-scale pan, are related (by virtue of Newton's second law) to the vertical accelerations z and z0 these systems would suffer if permitted to fall freely, in this manner: W=mz and W0 = m0z0. It is moreover known, as a venerable empirical fact (Galileo, etc.), that z == z0 = g, at any fixed location on the earth, so that W/W0 = m/m0. Hence, one may conclude that m = m0 when the balance is in equilibrium (W=W0). This procedure is, no doubt, highly precise and an easy one, but it is unsatisfactory from a methodological point of view for several reasons. It fails to do justice to the notion of mass as a measure of inertia, or tendency to resist acceleration, and to consider those bodies (such as the planets) which cannot be accommodated on scale pans. Note further that, as in the thread method, mass is not given an independent meaning, but is defined simultaneously with a particular force (here weight), by in voking the second law of motion. The most important objection to the weighing method, though, is perhaps that it relies on the apparently fortuitous proportionality of weight and mass (W=mg, g = const, for fixed location), and that it makes mass appear to be dependent on the properties of the earth instead of being inherent in the body alone. The fact is - as will now be obvious - that the definitions of mass which sympathetic interpreters of Newton have sought to read into his axioms do not furnish an ideal one. True, their attempts vastly improved on Newton's empty definition, since they make quantitative assertions which enable us to predict with rather impressive precision the motions of bodies susceptible to weighing and other laboratory manipulations. But they are not at all uniform operational definitions of cosmic scope ! In the light of the foregoing, one might well ask this question. Given the circumstance that Newton in no way properly defined mass and force 237</page><page sequence="5">WOLFGANG YOURGRAU AND ALWYN VAN DER MERWE or time and position in space - "I do not define time, space ... as being well known to all"1 - how come that his theory was initially so successful and continued to enjoy great popularity for nearly three centuries? The explanation is, to begin with, that ever since analytical balances and clocks, of ever improving accuracy, have been at our disposal, the quantitative determination of mass and time has ceased to be a problem as far as terrestrial bodies are concerned. The masses of celestial bodies cannot, of course, be thus determined. But, far from allowing this to become an obstacle, astronomers were and are still satisfied, as was New ton, to infer the masses of bodies in our solar system from a comparison of theoretically computed orbits with the orbits actually observed. It should furthermore be realized that, in a coordinate frame attached to the sun, the masses of the planets and comets (assumed not to influence one another) no longer play a role in determining their orbits, as the mass m of the orbiting body will cancel out in an equation of motion that employs Newton's law of universal gravitation, F=GmM/r2. Turning next to the problem of force (in the equation of motion F = mx), one should understand that it is, in the final analysis, not solved by meas urements, but by intelligent guesswork. In any particular instance, one is led by one's reasonableness to give tentatively some simple expression for the force function F, and afterwards judge the pragmatic value of this hypothesis by examining whether or not this F - on insertion into the equation of motion - leads to the state of motion (or equilibrium) actually observed. If agreement is not found, one somehow amends the function F and repeats the matching of theory and observation - until the agree ment is perfect. Therefore, it is for example certainly reasonable to assume, on symmetry grounds, that the force between two particles is central, that is, directed along the line joining the particles and a function only of their separation. This was, no doubt, the preliminary consideration that led Newton to hazard the brilliant guess embodied in his law of gravitation. Coulomb, experimenting more than 100 years later with electrical attractions and repulsions between spherical charges was proba bly guided by the same preliminary consideration and by the analogy with the gravitational law, when he formulated his inverse square law. After all, the torsion balance he used was so crude that experimental confirmation of his law was possible only with an accuracy of a few per cent. There is another example of our contention as to the origin of the 238</page><page sequence="6">DID ERNST MACH 'MISS THE TARGET'? notion of force. In dealing with systems exhibiting equilibrium config urations, it is common practice to expand the potential energy function (from which the force is derived) as a Taylor series in the particle dis placements and to retain as many of its terms as are needed to furnish an empirically vindicated theory. The simplest illustration of this proce dure is Hooke's law, in which only quadratic terms are retained. Finally, the choice of a proper reference frame seems to be crucial to the success of Newtonian mechanics. Closer examination reveals, how ever, that, crucial or not, it is in any event not the urgent problem as we may assume at first sight, compare the achievements of Galileo and New ton as well as those of some of their famous successors, all of whom operated without benefit of an inertial frame of reference. What holds for the force function, also holds for the reference frame: No immutable choice is demanded of us at first, since the corrections to be introduced will always suggest themselves as we proceed with the application of our theory. Provided one does not resort to a reference frame that is a priori unlikely (such as a tossing ship or a spiralling airplane), successive ap proximation is apt to lead us eventually to the discovery of a frame that is uniquely suitable - as far as the precision of our measurements is able to differentiate. This frame will for most terrestrial experiments be geo centric (attached to the earth), as Galileo and Newton early assumed, while for the celestial bodies in our solar system it will be heliocentric - as Newton, thanks to the discovery of Copernicus, was easily able to conclude. It should be added that a suitable frame of reference (ap proaching an inertial frame, if not coinciding with it) is traditionally con sidered to be one in which all forces required for the law of motion are simple functions of the positions and velocities of identifiable objects in the environment of the body under study. This criterion is seen to exclude, as not 'inertial-like', coordinate systems in which centrifugal and Coriolis forces are detected. B. MASS IN MACHIAN MECHANICS In his epoch-making classic entitled The Science of Mechanics*, Ernst Mach offered the first serious criticism - in 200 years ! - of some of the main ideas underlying Newtonian mechanics, especially that of mass. In developing mechanics from first principles, Mach adopted, as his method 239</page><page sequence="7">WOLFGANG YOURGRAU AND ALWYN VAN DER MERWE ological device of greatest consequence, a proposal to allow in science only those concepts that correspond to actual (or potential) data of ex perience, and to exclude from it all a priori and metaphysical speculations. This empirical attitude led him to reject outright Newtonian absolute time (which "of itself, and from its own nature, flows equably without relation to anything external") and absolute space (which "in its own nature, without relation to anything external, remains always similar and im movable") - since both were non-observable. Acceptable were only relative space and time. For, "when we say that time flows on in a definite direc tion or sense, we mean that physical events generally ... take place in a definite sense". And, as for space, "all our principles of mechanics are ... experimental knowledge concerning the relative positions and motions of bodies". Mach reserved, however, the gravamen of his criticism for the New tonian concept of mass.5 The expression "quantity of matter", he claimed, was lacking in clarity and of no help in actual operations with masses. He upheld this view despite efforts by some of his contemporaries to metricize 'quantity' by the counting of atoms. After all, the triumphs of Boltzmann's kinetic theory notwithstanding, these "hypothetical atoms" were imperceptible and thus inadmissible in the empiricist schema. Mach conceded that, when a number of similar chemically homogeneous bodies are put together, one can associate some clear idea with 'quantity of matter', as well as observe that the inertia of bodies increases with this quantity. But the moment chemical heterogeneity obtains, justification is required for the assumption that there is still something, measurable by the same standard, which may be called 'quantity of matter'. Mach was confident that a definition of mass based on the motions of perceptible bodies alone, and therefore faithful to empiricist precepts, can be formulated in the following manner. Consider, to start with, an isolated system of two arbitrary bodies, numbered [T] and jj[] for ai a2 ?-?m? &lt;??[!] convenience, interacting in any manner, and let the accelerations re sulting from their mutual actions be ax and a2, respectively. (See diagram; either the 'solid-line' or the 'broken-line' accelerations occur.) 240</page><page sequence="8">DID ERNST MACH 'MISS THE TARGET'? In the special case that the bodies are similar in all respects, symmetry alone leads us to expect that these accelerations will be equal in magnitude and oppositely directed along the line joining the bodies. It is possible that the equality a1 = ? a2 is predetermined by the sameness of: shape, chemical constitution, or any of the other properties the identical bodies are known to have in common; and if so, the equality deserves no further attention. If however, it should appear that the properties enumerated do not determine the accelerations, there must be an independent prop erty that does. This property may be called mass, denoted by m, and con veniently said to have the same value for any two bodies producing in each other equal but opposite accelerations. We examine the presupposition on which the tentative introduction of mass is based and devise a method for metricizing it by probing into the general situation in which bodies \T\ and \T\ can differ from one another to any extent. Now there is no principle whatever by which one can infer beforehand what the accelerations ax and a2 will be. And thus experiment alone can bring enlightenment. In this way we find, as Mach in effect claims, that - regardless (1) of the nature of the interaction (be it electric, magnetic, elastic, or arising on impact); (2) of the velocities of the bodies; (3) of their distances apart; and so on - these accelerations are always oppositely directed and such that the ratio ? aja2 is the same positive number. To express this remarkable observation, he states that the body PH has ? ax/a2 times the mass of the body [T]&gt; or "tne ratio of the masses is the negative inverse ratio of the counter-accelerations". In symbols, m2/m1=-a1/a2. (1) This equation recovers the important special case of equal masses when ai= -~a2- Should one assign unit mass to some body labelled pT|&gt; say, chosen to serve as mass standard, then Equation (1) is seen to imply that the mass of any other body is m if it imparts to the standard mass an acceleration a0 which is ? m times the acceleration a which the standard imparts to it. Thus : m = ? a0/a. A further point has to be elucidated before the new mass concept can be considered satisfactory. According to the above agreement, to every particle is allotted a mass relative to the standard. The question now arises: If in an interaction with the standard, body [7] exhibits the mass m\ and body \T\ the mass m\, will the interaction between Q] and [T] 241</page><page sequence="9">WOLFGANG YOURGRAU AND ALWYN VAN DER MERWE be described by a mass ratio m2/mi the same as m2/m?? No logical necessity exists for masses to show this behavior, but experience informs us that they do indeed. In consequence, the masses discovered for any collection of bodies through their interactions with the standard, strangely enough also characterize the interaction between any two members of the collection. One must therefore conclude that the mass of any body is an inherent property thereof, in no way dependent upon the properties of the environment with which the body might be interacting. This summarizes the bare statement of Mach's definition. Mach emphasized the point that the manner in which he introduced mass renders unnecessary the separate statement of Newton's third axiom, since it would amount to formulating the same idea twice. Indeed, the very definition of mass asserts that two interacting bodies impart to one another opposing accelerations in an inverse ratio to that of their masses; which, as will become clear below, is nothing but the principle of reaction as understood today. Also, according to Mach, the fact that mass can be measured by weight is deducible from his definition. Let bodies [T] and [T], having accel erations a1 and a2 in opposite directions due to the sole action of some external agency, be joined by a string. Then, if equilibrium sets in after wards, it must mean that these accelerations are exactly balanced by the interaction between the two bodies, so that m1ai=m2a2. And this yields m1=m2 when a1 = a2, as will be the case for bodies falling under gravity at the same geographic location. His argument furnishes the rationale for weighing with an analytical balance, provided one agrees that it is im material whether bodies are caused to interact either directly (with anti parallel accelerations) through the medium of a string, or indirectly (with parallel accelerations) by placing them on scale pans. After having scrutinized Newton's definition of mass and rejected it, on the grounds that it contains a "manifest circle", and having demon strated the redundancy of Newton's Law III, Mach was able to assail Laws I and II as well. He realized that the definitions IV-VIII, on which Newton premissed his laws, already defined force as an action that (a) tends to accelerate a body and (b) is measured by the acceleration; and nothing is added apparently to these statements by Laws I and II. Mach therefore branded these laws as dispensable tautologies, belonging to the same category as Law III. With Newton's laws exposed as a pleonasm 242</page><page sequence="10">DID ERNST MACH 'MISS THE TARGET'? and the classical mass definition repudiated, Mach decided that it was preferable to replace Newton's 'canons' by what he deemed to be a much simpler as well as more satisfactory set of propositions. Since these propositions revolve around Mach's mass concept and are germane to our subsequent critique, we cite them here in full.6 a. Experimental Proposition. Bodies set opposite each other induce in each other, under certain circumstances to be specified by experimental physics, contrary accelerations in the direction of their line of junction. (The principle of inertia is included in this.) b. Definition. The mass-ratio of any two bodies is the negative inverse ratio of the mutually induced accelerations of those bodies. c. Experimental Proposition. The mass-ratios of bodies are independent of the character of the physical states (of the bodies) that condition the mutual accelerations produced, be those states electrical, magnetic, or what not; and they remain, moreover, the same, whether they are mediately or immediately arrived at. d. Experimental Proposition. The accelerations which any number of bodies A, B, C,... induce in a body K, are independent of each other. (The principle of the parallelogram of forces follows immediately from this.) e. Definition. Moving force is the product of the mass-value of a body into the acceleration induced in that body. We shall make the reasonable assumption that these propositions, which originated in experience with small but finite bodies, may be extrapolated to particles, that is, to bodies of negligible dimensions. If a12 is the acceler ation induced in such a particle mx by a particle m2, then Mach's second definition allows us to call mln12 the force exerted by m? on m2. In sym bols we write F12 = m1a12. (2) The force on m2 due to m? is, analogously, F21 = m2a21. (3) Appealing to Equation (1), we can see immediately that F12=-F21, which is exactly Newton's Law III. These mutual forces will depend on the relative positions of the two particles involved and possibly even on their relative velocities and the time. If several particles act on a particle of mass m and position r, they will jointly impart to m an acceleration r 243</page><page sequence="11">WOLFGANG YOURGRAU AND ALWYN VAN DER MERWE that, by virtue of Mach's third experimental proposition, (d) is simply the vector sum of the accelerations these particles would induce if they were permitted to act on m individually. The total force F=F(r, r, t) operating on m is then given by F=wr - which agrees with Newton's Law II. C. CRITIQUE OF THE MACHIAN CONCEPT Mach, through his insistence that mechanics be developed only from a foundation of definitions and empirically testable propositions, achieved 'parsimony of thought' - his version of Ockham's razor - that is striking compared to that of the Principia. More essentially, however, Mach's method purged mechanics of the anthropomorphism, undue reliance on intuition, and metaphysical obscurities immanent in Newton's axioms and definitions. By concentrating on the kinematical behavior of bodies, it brings into relief what positive content remains in Newton's all-im portant second axiom after it has been shorn of its unjustified claims. To our way of reasoning (as elucidated in the later paragraphs of Section A) that content is this : While the orbit and velocity of a particle P can in general not be described in a simple fashion, we are fortunate that in many instances its acceleration can. It is given by a relatively simple function r = r(r, r, t) of the time and the particle's position and velocity. Since this acceleration is generated by the action of bodies surrounding P, it is convenient (and in agreement with our sensations of pull or push in cases where if is due to muscular action) to call "r times some particular constant m" the force exerted on P by its immediate environment. Mach regarded as one of Newton's main discoveries, which he retained (with greater emphasis) in his definition of mass, the realization that m is an intrinsic property of P, thus different from its weight, and that the quantity m measures the inertia of P in relation to that of other particles supposedly acted on by the same force F. When we remember that Mach achieved logical clarification of the foundations of mechanics without modifying any of Newton's compu tational procedures (of proven worth), then there can be little doubt that the method of Mach represents a vast improvement over that of Newton. We hasten to add, though, that our preference for Mach is not without reservations. Not only does his presentation suffer from some vagueness, 244</page><page sequence="12">DID ERNST MACH 'MISS THE TARGET'? but one can also detect serious lacunae in his method, especially from our present viewpoint. In the subsequent comments, we shall identify a few of these and try to remedy them within the framework set by Mach. After all, should an estimation of Mach be any less fair than that accorded to Newton by his apologists? It is often held against Mach - as one of the oldest objections to his definition of mass - that he omitted to specify the frame of reference with respect to which the accelerations in that definition should be measured.7 That the question as to the proper reference system is a crucial one, can be demonstrated by the following considerations. Let S be a frame of reference chosen such that, relative to it, the accelerations of two inter acting particles [T] and [T] are always oppositely directed along the line joining them and, moreover, have a ratio a2/ai=m12 being positive and constant in time. Then, according to Mach, m12 is to be interpreted as the mass of [T] relative to [T]. It is, however, a simple matter to show8 that if S' is another reference system moving relative to S with an acceler ation a parallel to the direction [!]"-*[!]&gt; the accelerations of the particles with respect to S' will also be parallel to the connecting line: such that their ratio ?2/fli ^s time-independent and equal to an arbitrary number m\2, provided only that a0 is chosen to be a0 = (m'12 - m12)/(m12a2 x + m'12a^). (4) The mass ratio of two particles depends therefore on the frame of refer ence; and the mass concept will not be unique unless one specifies some reference system as the standard. This necessary condition, for some reason, Mach neglected to state explicitly, that is, as part of his set of fundamental propositions - or did he hint at it perhaps in the cryptic phrase, "under certain circumstances to be specified by experimental physics", appearing in his first propo sition? But it is hard to believe that Mach, with his superb insight into the relativity of space and time, would be oblivious of the relativity of accelerations and their ratios ! We find it more plausible to suppose that Mach tacitly operated with an inertial frame, which for him was given by the average positions of the distant stars or by the center-of-mass system of the two interacting particles. The equivalence of the latter two refer ence frames was a consequence of the absence of external forces (isolation) 245</page><page sequence="13">WOLFGANG YOURGRAU AND ALWYN VAN DER MERWE postulated for the pair of particles. Indeed, Mach was highly appreciative of the fact that Newton was guided (starting with the fifth corollary of the Principia) by the demands of empirical investigation to conceive of "a momentary terrestrial system of coordinates, for which the law of inertia is valid, held fast in space without any rotation relatively to the fixed stars".9 And later on we find in Mach's exposition the statement: There is, I think, no difference of meaning between Lange and myself... about the fact that, at the present time, the heaven of the fixed stars is the only prac tically usable system of reference, and about the method of obtaining a new system of reference by gradual correction.10 Thus, in regard to a frame of reference appropriate to experimental propositions, Mach's intention seems to us quite evident. The main premiss of Mach's definition of mass is that the imaginary observer, performing the operations implicit in the definition, may assume the system of two bodies to be isolated, that is, excluded from the influ ences of the observer or any other third body in the universe.11 Now, it is trivially true that perfect isolation is never realized. One might therefore well ask (as critics of Mach have done): What good is an operational definition if its premiss is not satisfied in physical reality?12 The reply to this objection is in part that Mach's definition involves ultimately a thought experiment - as rigorous formulations of definitions and laws in physics generally do.13 Such an experiment, although a ficti tious one (arrived at by extrapolation of actual experimental results), is a sound operational device, provided its implementation is possible in principle. By this we mean that its premisses should not conflict with any known physical law14 or apply only if one envisages the undesired or unlikely disruption of the system under investigation. We are now able to treat the question of isolation, at least as far as it concerns terrestrial bodies, in this simple manner. Since, as a rule of experience, the motion of a given body tends to be less affected by distant than by near objects, we may with a high degree of confidence neglect the effect of remote stars on the kinematic behavior of a system of two terrestrial bodies. The influences of the close-by objects, which we may conveniently call the system's environment, are not so easily disposed of. Still, here we may have the advantage that one can either deliberately change the relative configurations and motions of the system and its environment, or wait 246</page><page sequence="14">DID ERNST MACH 'MISS THE TARGET'? until they have changed on their own. In this way, one may effectively eliminate outside influences or, if that is not feasible, allow for them quantitatively, so that the only unique influences remaining will be those internal to the system. In the case of celestial bodies, any manipulation is obviously ruled out. It would thus seem at first that Mach's method is applicable only to effectively isolated binary-star systems, each of which consists of no more than two bodies - unless one is prepared to wait for the improbable event that two bodies, whose masses one wishes to know, split off from the many-body celestial system to which they belong! But this is too pessimistic a conception: In many instances it will be possible to apply the Mach method, albeit indirectly, even to the members of an effectively isolated system consisting of more than two bodies, such as our solar system. This becomes evident if one writes down the equations of motion for every body in the system (involving the two-body forces additively, as required by Mach's third experimental proposition) together with the six equations expressing the conservation of the system's linear and angular momenta, and compares the number of equations thus found with the number of unknown mass and force parameters. Except for special cases, this leads to the conclusion8 that the mass ratios of the bodies can be determined from measurements of their accelerations alone, provided these measurements are repeated a sufficiently large number of times, more than (l/6)(n? 1) for a system of? bodies. As a final and legitimate point of criticism, let us mention the fact - and Mach must be exonerated for his ignorance in regard to it - that the defining Equation (1), that is, the law of action and reaction, m{tx ? ? m2r2, (mt and m2 positive constants) (5) does not hold (beyond the lowest approximation) for interactions between (a) particles having velocities sizable in comparison with that of light and (b) slow as well as fast charged particles.15 The same argument applies to Mach's third experimental proposition. It is however possible to bring these two cases within the compass of a modernized version of Mach's definition: We simply replace mr in Equation (5) by the time derivative of a properly chosen linear momentum. This momentum, as we know from relativity theory, is given for neutral 247</page><page sequence="15">WOLFGANG YOURGRAU AND ALWYN VAN DER MERWE particles by m0v(l? v2/c2)~*. Accordingly, Equation (5) in the form ??o? jt Oi (1 - vjlc2)-^ = -m02jt [t2 (1 - vllc2)-^ (6) defines the ratio m01/m02 of the rest masses of particles [T] and |~2~|. In dealing with charged particles, one has to supplement the foregoing mechanical momentum with a momentum of electromagnetic origin. This yields the action-reaction law16 -r OoiVi(l - v\lc2Y* + Gh^c2)^-1 + Vi-nrr"3)] at = - 1 bn02y2{\ - vile2)'* + (qiq2l2c2) (v.r"1 + v2-rrr-3)] . (7) at Here qx and q2 are the charges of the particles and r the vector locating the second particle relative to the first. Equation (7), which includes Equations (5) and (6) as special cases, determines rigorously the rest masses of particles, whatever their speeds and charges, while duly taking into account electromagnetic inertia along with the inertia of matter. And this broadening of Mach's definition, it should be stressed, is achieved without any violation of its purely kinematic character. Mach did, of course, not envisage the application of his principles to atomic particles, whose existence he in fact disavowed - and neither do we. If we were to (gladly !) disregard Mach's injunction never to operate with intangible objects, and try to rescue in the atomic domain the kinematic nature of the mass definition, we would be immediately con fronted with stubborn facts such as these : Pairwise isolation of atoms or molecules is hardly feasible, their accelerations are unobservable even in principle, and the additivity of forces does not, by necessity, obtain. The failure of the Mach approach in this important domain cannot be denied. We have neither attempted to defend any of Mach's concepts not covered by his propositions, nor his positivism in general, especially where it minimizes the cognitive value of hypotheses and theories and sometimes even relinquishes them altogether. Who could seriously deny that philos ophy of science has advanced beyond radical empiricism and that devices such as theories and hypotheses are of utmost heuristic importance in modern science? Indeed, even Mach was not quite as dogmatic in his opposition to hypotheses as some authors suppose. 248</page><page sequence="16">DID ERNST MACH 'MISS THE TARGET'? Observation only leads in the first place to the conjecturing of laws of motion, which ... are presupposed as hypotheses. ... Only if these hypotheses have shown themselves to hold good in many simple and complicated cases, do we agree to keep them.17 What we do maintain, and hope to have demonstrated in this terse cri tique, is the indubitable superiority of Mach's concept of mass and related physical ideas over those of Newton. Further, we intended to prove the intrinsic value of his theory once it is properly refined and divorced from some of the naive dogmas of empiricist philosophy. Mach certainly did not 'miss the target' ! And although he did not score a bull's eye either, we are convinced that in essence he came closer to it than any other physicist in the history of mechanics. University of Denver REFERENCES 1 I.

Since a perfectly reversible engine (although not forbidden by any law of thermodynamics) cannot be constructed in practice, precise temperature measurements are never made calorimetrically, but 249</page><page sequence="17">WOLFGANG YOURGRAU AND ALWYN VAN DER MERWE with the aid of gas thermometers.
