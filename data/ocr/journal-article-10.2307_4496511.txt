AUSTIN Coastal Exploitation, Land Loss, and Hurricanes: A Recipe for Disaster ABSTRACT Southern Louisiana occupies a dynamic landscape, marked by coastal wetlands interrupted by both natural and human- made levees, and vulnerable to both the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers and major storms coming off the Gulf of Mexico. It is also a region into which, for centuries, exiled and threatened populations have moved and found refuge. Systematic and dramatic changes along the entire reach of the Mississippi River coupled with activities within the region's wetlands such as levee construction, canal dredging, and petroleum extraction have contributed to both pollution and extensive coastal land loss. In this article, I discuss the recent hurricanes in light of the relationship between Louisiana and the rest of the United States and the environmental and community degradation that has occurred along the coast. I focus on petroleum development, the most recent and extensive natural resource to shape southern Louisiana's wealth and economy. [Keywords: political ecology, United States, petroleum impacts, coastal erosion] ON SUNDAY, AUGUST 28, 2005, news and weather stations across the United States were focused on the path of Hurricane Katrina and discussions of the storm's im- pact. As weather forecasters predicted that Katrina would make landfall as a Category 5 storm, confirming predic- tions of an above-normal 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, I listened to Louisiana State University oceanographer Joe Suhayda (2005) describe what would happen if New Orleans received a direct hit. His predictions-that floodwater levels would reach 20 feet, that levees would be topped, and that several hundred thousand people, including the hundred thousand or so without automobiles, would be stranded in the city-were based on research he had done and com- puter models he had developed over the past decade. He had shared them many times before. Indeed, since the Septem- ber 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center, U.S. pre- occupation with disaster meant that the causes and conse- quences of a major hurricane hitting New Orleans-which both the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the American Red Cross had identified as among the worst and most likely potential disasters to strike the United States-had received coverage in both popular and aca- demic media.' As recently as 2004, FEMA had addressed just such an event in its "Hurricane Pam" simulation exercises (FEMA 2004). Katrina followed very closely the path that Hurricane Betsy took 40 years earlier, but her impacts, both physical destruction and human casualties, were much worse than those of her predecessor. Although there are many reasons for the differences, among the most significant and long lasting are the environmental changes that have occurred in the region during this period. These have not been accompanied by substantial improvements in the physical and social conditions that would enable communities or their institutions to reduce or manage the threat posed by such a storm. To the contrary, they have been exacerbated by an assortment of factors that virtually guaranteed destruction. Indeed, evidence that Louisiana is in trouble has been amassing for decades and the signs of problems have not been limited to the numerous reports that the New Orleans levees would be unable to withstand a storm of such magnitude.2 SOUTHERN LOUISIANA AT THE PERIPHERY We've been telling this since 1990. This was in- formation gathered at the start of the estuary pro- gram. It's 2005! They said, "We can't afford to restore Louisiana." ... We've sacrificed a lot to provide oil to this nation. Now our communities are destroyed.... It could be a callous attitude toward people in the Deep South. What is it? We just don't deserve the same? Look at our efforts to get our fair share of the offshore royalties. What are we doing wrong in trying to get our message out? ... We have no elevation. Everything we have is covered with water. We don't even know what will happen when AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST, Vol. 108, Issue 4, pp. 671-691, ISSN 0002-7294, electronic ISSN 1548-1433. ? 2006 by the American Anthropological Association.

They reflect the confusion, frus- tration, and anger expressed by southern Louisianans at the lack of awareness or understanding of their plight and their inability to effectively communicate their needs to their fellow U.S. citizens. When Katrina struck, few outside the region were aware of the conditions under which people of southern Louisiana were living and how those were linked to benefits that accrue to people far away from the bay- ous and wetlands of the state.3 Anticipating Katrina, and in the hours and days immediately following it, national me- dia addressed one concern-how the hurricane would affect the price of gas for heating and transportation-but ignored critical links among petroleum exploration and production, coastal land loss, and flooding. Analysis of Hurricane Katrina will continue for decades and contribute to studies of disasters, involuntary migra- tion, and the impacts of petroleum development. Never have all of these been considered at the same time and rarely have U.S. communities been the focus of scrutiny. Yet, southern Louisiana is a valuable site at which to study the totality of anthropogenic environmental change on a specific landscape to understand the environmental present (Fisher and Feinman 2005). The aim of this article is more modest. Remembering Roy Rappaport's admonition "to grasp people's understanding of the difficulties they are fac- ing and to help those people make those understandings explicit to themselves and intelligible and audible to oth- ers" (1993:302), my goal is to shed light on the situation in which southern Louisianans, especially those living out- side New Orleans, presently find themselves. After a brief historical review, I focus on oil and gas development and its legacies. This article is based on ethnographic fieldwork, archival research, media analysis, and oral history interviews con- ducted between 1997 and 2005.4 Additional information is drawn from numerous phone calls and e-mail communica- tions in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and an 11-day visit to southern Louisiana in early November 2005. Photos were donated by participants in the Offshore Oil and Gas History Project (OOGHP), a study funded by the U.S. Minerals Management Service (MMS) and by the Morgan City Archives, Morgan City, Louisiana. In many respects, petroleum development in southern Louisiana appears unremarkable; the state is easily recog- nizable at the periphery, driven by the needs of the core. The money and power associated with industrial devel- opment have transformed the state's social, political, and natural environment such that, despite incredible wealth in natural resources, the state ranks at or near the bottom on most measures of social well-being. In health care, for ex- ample, Louisiana has ranked 50 of 50 states for 13 of the past 15 years (United Health Foundation 2005). Indeed, viewed in light of the criteria advanced by Raymond Bryant and Sindad Bailey (2000), southern Louisiana provides almost a textbook case for political ecologists. For decades, state- sponsored industrial development has emphasized resource extraction for export and been linked to pollution arising from manufacturing. Corporations have been attracted to the state by a relative lack of political controls and inex- pensive labor. State and business leaders have enjoyed a close and symbiotic relationship. Corruption among politi- cal leaders has been legend, and it has been in neither their economic nor political interest to promote environmental protection. During the mid-1980s, the state was forced to pay attention to mounting environmental crises within its borders. Pressure from outsiders, especially NGOs, to strike a balance between economic development and environmen- tal concerns combined with growing pressure for change from within the state's borders to impact the policy process. The groups demanded new policies based on social justice, local empowerment, and environmental conservation. Yet, there is a certain irony here. Bryant and Bailey write about Third World nation-states in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Louisiana is a state within the federalist system of the United States, arguably the wealthiest and most power- ful First World nation-state in the world today. Louisiana is not, however, simply a site of internal colonialism: a process of unequal exchange between the territories of a given state that occurs either as a result of the free play of market forces, or of economic policies of the central state that have intended or unintended distributional conse- quences for regions ... that are simultaneously econom- ically disadvantaged and culturally distinctive from the core regions of the host state. [Hechter 1999:xiv] Louisiana's situation is more complex, reflecting a social and political evolution spanning more than 300 years since the initial occupation of the region by both French and Spanish colonial governments and its incorporation into the United States in 1803. Why, then, do such conditions persist? As Rappaport (1993) reminded anthropologists, dif- ficulties in so-called core societies are generative of diffi- culties in others and warrant attention. Rappaport's mal- adaptation, denoting "those disorderings of structure that in their nature both generate troubles and impede the ca- pacities of social systems to respond adaptively to them" (1993:300; see also Rappaport 1977, 1979), is particularly apropos. In this article, I carefully examine the relation- ship between southern Louisiana and the rest of the United States and consider the development of petroleum, the most recent and extensive natural resource to shape the state's wealth and economy. Anthropologists have paid considerable attention to petroleum; the product fuels the global economy, so it is</page><page sequence="3">Austin * Coastal Exploitation, Land Loss, and Hurricanes 673 let,:i -: 1-i1- ... --- :::::_ i:: ke::i: ._-:-iii ::::i:::4IM Y:_:\~:i?: :::Ow~s ?Ww :n W, o .

The focus has been primarily on the relationship of multinational corporations to nation- states-Ecuador and Nigeria, for example-with issues such as relationships among corporations, investment, environ- mental protection, and human rights receiving attention (see Ferguson 2005; Sawyer 2004; Watts 2001). Of special note, in contrast to the circumstances in places like Ecuador or Nigeria, the development of petroleum resources in Louisiana, which began over 100 years ago before petroleum occupied a critical place in world affairs, has never been marked by violence or even significant social outcry. Early efforts by shrimpers to thwart the initial exploration for off- shore oil and gas were memorialized in the film, Thunder Bay (Mann 1953), starring Jimmy Stewart; these, however, were localized efforts-shrimpers worked with political leaders to develop mechanisms through which they would be com- pensated for damages.s Even today, many individuals and communities within the region define themselves through their relationship to the industry. Louisiana's relationship to oil, and to the rest of the country, well illustrates "the essential complexity of the interests of actors as they interact with each other and with the environment" (Bryant and Bailey 2000:188; see Figure 1). Not only is it critical to understand the actors and their interests, it is imperative to understand as well the relationships among the regions from which they come. Southern Louisiana has played a particular role in the U.S. economy and polity, one that has persisted for more than two centuries. Processes such as the destruction of forest, soil, and wetlands have been consequences of that role and have increased the vulnerability of the state's environ- ment, economy, and society to disaster. In this analysis, I will address these three interconnected features, noting especially the interdependence of economy and labor, ed- ucation, and environmental impacts; I will then consider how they have evolved and changed in response to national social movements and policies and how they affected the region. Warranting attention as well is the changing makeup of southern Louisiana's population. Local interests are neither homogenous nor static, especially as people move in and out of the area. Some southern Louisianans trace their ties to the region to the 1700s, others come for a few years and then move on, and still others live only part time in the re- gion or spend long periods on offshore platforms or vessels. As a region within a nation-state whose laws protect trans- portation, commerce, and communication throughout the nation and prohibit control of migration across intrana- tional borders, Louisiana illustrates the importance of both</page><page sequence="4">674 American Anthropologist * Vol. 108, No. 4 * December 2006 ---------- WAS"OTO FBJCXAM.;I ST* ANO &amp;M ~ CS~~ Ji~;~~ST, TAAMAW-a ?b)?? ~IZ~ ~~P~SI ~.01 5~Iwo FIGURE 2. Southern Louisiana. isolation and permeability to analyses of relations among regions (see also Ferguson 2005). A BRIEF LOOK BACK An obvious starting point for understanding Louisiana's evolution and its relationship to the rest of the United States, framed in the familiar context of South versus North, is the Civil War. For some in southern Louisiana, the "War Between the States" remains the defining moment in their history. However, many residents recognize that the dis- tinctive position of Louisiana, and especially that of the southern part of the state, derives from events that took place much farther back in time and in which both geog- raphy and topography were paramount (see Figure 2). As became evident in the faltering attempts to rescue and pro- vide relief to victims of first Katrina and then Hurricane Rita, in southern Louisiana, defined loosely as the region south of Interstate 10, New Orleans is distinguished from "everywhere else." The dominant environmental features of the eastern region are the coastal wetlands bounded on the east by the Mississippi River and on the west by the Atchafalaya River and broken by natural levee deposits of loamy soil and broad, interdistributary clay flats (McKenzie et al. 1995). Affected by both the rivers and storms off the Gulf of Mexico as well as underground faults, the system is highly dynamic. Humans, too, have played a significant role in creating the landscape (Kidder 1998). The river sys- tem has been systematically and dramatically altered along its entire reach, affecting delta growth and decline. In addi- tion, since at least European contact, Louisiana's wetlands have been perceived both as wastelands and as systems ca- pable of endless regeneration and renewal, sealing their fate. French explorers entered southern Louisiana in 1698. Scarcity of dry land and difficulty of access kept many peo- ple from venturing into vast stretches of the region before the 1700s, initially restricting development to the banks of rivers and bayous where hunting, fishing, and farm- ing supported Native Americans of the Chitimacha groups (Goins and Caldwell 1995; Kniffen et al. 1987). For the Europeans, though, the harsh environmental conditions- exacerbated by floods, hurricanes, and disease-bearing microorganisms-were outweighed by the need for access to the productive estuaries and open waters of the Gulf of Mexico and to the Mississippi River, a transportation cor- ridor to the interior of the continent. Thus, within this</page><page sequence="5">Austin * Coastal Exploitation, Land Loss, and Hurricanes 675 generally sparsely populated region, in 1717 New Orleans was established by French engineers on the highest ground along the Mississippi's natural levees as a gateway to the river and strategic location for commerce. As the city ex- panded, property owners were required to construct and maintain their own levees to protect their investments. When Louisiana became part of the United States, main- taining navigation along the Mississippi continued as a fed- eral government priority. Flood control remained a local land use concern and lands were ceded to local levee boards to achieve it (see Houck 2006). Outside the city, isolated land masses extending through swamps and marshes like fingers into the Gulf of Mexico defined where people could live. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, exiled and threatened populations moved into the region and found refuge. Beginning in the 1700s, Native American groups such as the Houma were driven down into the Louisiana bayous to escape both Na- tive and Euroamerican hostilities.6 The population of the region changed significantly as new arrivals-including sev- eral waves of French immigrants, Canary Islanders (Islefios), African and Caribbean slaves, German farmers, Slavic mer- chant mariners and fishermen, and Chinese immigrants- moved into the region to escape persecution or poverty (White 1997). The various groups lived in relative isolation, intermingling and marrying among themselves but having limited contact with outsiders until the 1800s when the expansion of the sugar industry led to the first large-scale environmental and social changes. Prior to the development of the sugar industry, the largest group of immigrants to southern Louisiana was comprised of Acadians (Cajuns) who were exiled from Nova Scotia and then France and arrived in the region in successive waves over a 20-year period beginning in 1765 (Brasseaux 1992; Dormon 1983). The Cajuns occu- pied two distinct niches: one group engaged in subsistence farming and small-to-medium scale cattle ranching toward the west, and the other established dispersed water-based settlements along the bayous to the south and east. Al- though the Cajun and Native American populations inter- acted with one another, and both groups assimilated oth- ers into their communities, they remained distinct. Even at the end of the 20th century, for example, Houma tribal elders still spoke the conservative French dialect anthro- pologists had recorded at the beginning of the century, rather than the Cajun French of their neighbors (Wallace et al. 2001). With the rise of the sugar industry, the demographics of southern Louisiana changed dramatically. From the early to mid-1800s, federal tariff protection and a growing demand for sugar first led to a rapid increase in the number of Anglo- Americans drawn to the region by the prospect of achiev- ing great wealth and second extended sugar across central and western parts of southern Louisiana where much of the land had been perceived to be worthless. Although a few Ca- juns became successful planters, most were small landhold- ers who were largely displaced from the most valuable and productive land by midcentury (Dormon 1983). The sugar producers depended on large numbers of black slaves, and the rapid importation of those slaves resulted in a rural pop- ulation outside New Orleans that was majority black by a ratio slightly more than three to two (Highsmith 1955). The burgeoning sugar market, accompanied by fear of Cuban and West Indies sugar producers, led planters to inten- sify cultivation, enlarge production facilities, and modern- ize grinding equipment to maximize yields (Follett 2000, 2005). Because of a tenfold increase in production, by 1853 Louisiana planters were producing one-fourth of the world's sugar and were among the south's wealthiest slaveholders (Rodrigue 2001). The rapid expansion of the sugar industry, concen- tration of wealth, and arrival of large numbers of blacks created new social divisions. The industry also established conditions for work and education. Steam-operated mills increased efficiency and economic success and set the pace of work to unbending regimes as cultivation had to keep up with mill processing. Educational attainment was negatively impacted as planters generally provided their children with private education and invested little in public education. Slaves, of course, were denied education. Groups such as the Cajuns and the Islefios had long viewed school- ing with suspicion; their penchant toward practical knowl- edge and its transmission via mentoring, coupled with a general distrust of outsiders, led many parents to keep their children out of schools. Lack of resources and the need to move to earn a livelihood were also key factors. The end re- sult was that few residents received much formal education beyond the elementary grades. The Civil War marked the end of the period when "plantation slavery reached its apogee as an economic insti- tution and its nadir for those enslaved in the cane world" (Follett 2005:8). During the war, federal military authori- ties imposed a monthly wage-labor system, and laborers' rights gradually expanded. At the end of the war, in Septem- ber 1864, Louisiana's constitution was amended to formally abolish slavery. Two years later, freedmen became legally eligible to acquire and settle on public land. Implemen- tation was subject to political abuses, bureaucratic inepti- tude, and burgeoning racism (Lanza 1990), but this law, combined with the settlement of many former slaves on the plantations where they continued to work, contributed to the establishment of black communities across the region. Although the Civil War ended slavery, it did not lead to a signification redistribution of wealth. After the war, planters used scrip payments and wage withholdings to maintain control over their laborers (Rodrigue 2001). In the wake of the national financial crisis of 1873, their attempts to reduce wages and recruit workers from cotton regions led to the first unions, strikes, and eventually violence (Gould 1984; Hair 1969). Scarcity of cultivable land and planters' re- luctance to sell to small purchasers limited the reallocation of land (Highsmith 1955). Although several large planta- tions were broken up and sold off to former Union soldiers</page><page sequence="6">676 American Anthropologist * Vol. 108, No. 4 * December 2006 and land speculators, concentration of land ownership re- mained roughly what it had been in the antebellum period, with slight increases in some areas. The system of large land- holding based on controlled labor directly financed by New Orleans capital and indirectly supported by race-conscious small farmers survived the war and reconstruction (Highsmith 1955; Schmitz 1976). Northern capital triggered significant social and envi- ronmental changes as northerners bought land, invested in rail lines and steamships, established schools, dredged channels, and renamed local communities, but it did little to reduce income inequality. Indeed, although people of southern Louisiana had long constructed their livelihoods around the area's natural resources, the stereotypical "Cajun" lifestyle was born in the economic hard times following the war when bayou residents survived through lumberjacking, trapping, hunting, moss gathering, and fishing, supplemented by small-scale agriculture. With the family as the primary social unit, large families were common, and knowledge and skills were passed down through mentoring. The desperate situation of planters caused some to turn to timber and attracted northerners who bought property for the timber rights. In 1876, Congress broadened oppor- tunities for the transfer of public lands beyond homestead purposes, the effect of which was to open up vast tracts of yellow pine and cypress swamp lands in Louisiana and put virgin cypress timber into market for as little as 25-50 cents an acre (Norgress 1947). State officials supported the transfer and argued the state would benefit from the in- creased revenue derived from both sales and taxation. Vast acreage was passed from the public to private domain, and political power remained in the hands of the large land- holders who used their positions to ensure their continued success. Lumber companies established camps and commu- nities to house their workers, mostly blacks and Cajuns, who received low wages for long hours and hard work.7 Scrip payments were common, and workers frequently remained indebted to the company store. Sawmill work was equally difficult and dangerous. Lumbermen occupied key positions in local banks, city and state government, and ship channel companies, and used their positions to their advantage. Fallen cypress trees were removed by pull boats and skidders, leaving spider-web trails where the trees had been dragged through the swamp. Within this context, there was little room for public dissent. Most logging occurred on private land. Timber workers had few other options for making a living, those working in the forests were widely dispersed, and the violence associated with the organizing attempts by sugar workers had resulted in severe crackdowns and negative public sentiment toward labor organizing (Gould 1984). Another factor that inhibited social protest against the industry was the speed with which it tore through the re- gion. Companies moved quickly from one stand of trees to another, and many started up and were gone within only a few years. The industry experienced several up and down cycles through the early 1900s. As they exhausted their supplies of lumber, companies liquidated; by the early 1930s little more than one percent of the cypress forests remained, and the industry was almost completely gone (Norgress 1947). Rapid exhaustion of the cypress forests with limited benefits to the state led to a 1910 Constitutional Amend- ment to impose a license tax on the privilege of severing nat- ural resources from the soil. Severance taxes were initially hard to enforce and easily evaded, so the state Constitution was again amended in 1921. Although too late to allow the state to gain much benefit from the removal of cypress, the taxes would have a tremendous impact on the state's econ- omy as the oil and gas industry gained prominence. Commercial shrimping became a major economic force for coastal communities in the 1930s when large quantities of jumbo shrimp were discovered off of Louisiana's coast. As former timber workers lost their jobs, families moved away, and those residents who remained were eager for new economic opportunities. Shrimping brought a new wave of outsiders to the area and attracted local fishermen who built and acquired wooden boats. Public sentiments in favor of habitat preservation de- veloped to some extent during the early 1920s when the negative impacts of tree cutting, the draining of marshes, and digging of canals became obvious. However, these were abruptly replaced by the urgency of flood control af- ter the Mississippi River flood of 1927, which inundated over 150,000 homes, displaced 600,000 people in seven states, and spurred increased public investment in levee construction and maintenance (Barry 1997). Billions of fed- eral dollars were authorized for levee construction, eventu- ally channeling the massive river along its entire length, following a pattern that had begun in 1879 when Congress created the Mississippi River Commission to engage the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in preventing destructive floods. The 1936 passage of the Flood Control Act launched an unprecedented era of federally funded water development projects and strengthened ties among Congress, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and lobbyists for real estate and industrial development in southern Louisiana (see Houck 2006). Flood control became secondary to such projects- dams, drainage canals, pumping stations, and levees-and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, industry lobbyists, and local levee boards became the new power brokers. Between the 1940s and 1970, along the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley, 500 square miles of wetlands were lost each year to agriculture, levees and other flood control measures, and flood plain development (Streever 2001). The combined ef- fects of levee construction, channel construction, draining of wetlands, and subsequent development within the flood plains of both the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers not only drastically altered the flow of the rivers and reduced de- position of sediments in the estuary system but also brought more people and infrastructure within high risk areas,</page><page sequence="7">Austin * Coastal Exploitation, Land Loss, and Hurricanes 677 virtually guaranteeing public pressure for ongoing invest- ment in engineered protection measures. THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY The sugar, timber, and shrimping industries, along with the water development projects created to protect them, set the stage and established the actors for the next major economic development phase in southern Louisiana. Some land development companies bought cutover cypress land at very low prices because the owners did not want to pay taxes on it. Elsewhere, the discovery of oil in the region prompted timber companies to hold onto the land and lease it for exploration. In all, much land remained in the hands of a few. Even areas that had proven too wet for agriculture or timber removal were potentially valuable for what lay below their surface. The 1901 discovery of a huge field at Jennings launched commercial oil exploration in Louisiana. The value of petroleum increased during World War I because of its use as fuel for trucks, planes, and ships, and by the 1920s oil de- velopment was moving into the state's swamps, marshes, and inland lakes. In 1921, the state of Louisiana issued the first coastal zone oil lease and land development companies began acquiring huge tracts of swampland. Initial efforts by outsiders to purchase or lease land, especially swamp- land and cutover timberland, went unchallenged. Few rec- ognized that the Louisiana Land and Exploration Company, organized in 1926 as a Maryland Corporation and responsi- ble for exploring over half of Louisiana's 2,000,000 available acres by 1928, was not a Louisiana company.8 In 1928, the Louisiana Land and Exploration Company entered into a contract with the Texas Company (later Texaco), guaran- teeing the latter an exclusive right to prospect, drill for, and produce oil, gas, and sulfur on its properties in Louisiana. Although language barriers, low literacy, and segregation of the local population initially inhibited communication, soon stories of land acquisition traveled up and down the bayous by word of mouth. Alongside the large tracts of private land, some land re- mained in smaller parcels held by families who had been in the region for many decades. The oil companies hired locals who could speak French to convince their neighbors to allow seismic crews access to their property for explo- ration. When oil was discovered, the need to allocate roy- alty payments sometimes required realignment of property lines, often to the detriment of the least educated and pow- erful of the residents. At times when residents resisted sell- ing their properties, some unscrupulous operators promised them they were only signing lease agreements. Resident protest was impeded by pride, lack of English fluency, and an inability to read. Long-standing isolation of the region from other parts of the United States meant few outsiders were aware of what was taking place. Petroleum exploration and production continued through the Great Depression, and by the latter part of the 1930s pioneers had marched steadily through the Louisiana ,. . " 1 1 I I I . I .

Even coming on the heels of the massive damage and displacement caused by the sugar and timber industries, the early activity was highly disruptive ecologi- cally, socially, and politically. Although wells were drilled throughout communities, locals on adjoining properties neither expected, nor received, any compensation from oil companies. For example, when a well located just off High- way 1 and close to the high school in Golden Meadow blew out in 1939, sending oil shooting into the air (Figure 3), families had to leave the area for several weeks until the water in their roof cisterns, which had become contami- nated with oil, was flushed out. Residents organized their own transportation out of town and utilized the one tele- phone in the community to determine when it was safe to return. Because of its size and labor needs, the oil and gas industry attracted experienced oilfield workers, initially many from Texas, Oklahoma, and northern Louisiana, all of whom were locally referred to as "Texiens." Companies worked to gain local support through meetings and public relations campaigns.

(Source: Russell Poiencot, Offshore Oil and Gas History Project, 2001) Parish, the companies built camps to house the workers they brought in from outside. Although the "Texiens" were at first reluctant to work with French-speaking Cajuns, as the industry moved into the woods and later into the swamps and marshes, select trappers, lumber workers, and other lo- cals with intricate knowledge of the terrain were recruited to guide seismic crews, lay roads, and carry equipment (Fig- ure 4). Many locals first tried to avoid the outsiders and new industry, but soon, overwhelmed by their numbers and lured with financial rewards for participation, they em- braced opportunities to benefit from the outsiders' pres- ence. Accustomed to employing diverse livelihood strate- gies adapted to both natural and economic cycles and driven largely by forces beyond their control, locals sim- ply incorporated oil industry jobs into their seasonal oc- cupational patterns (see also Gramling 1989). As in the post-Civil War years when even dangerous timber indus- try jobs appeared attractive to poor men with few options, the arrival of relatively high-paying oil-related work was a boon for many. In contrast to the timber industry, though, the petroleum companies did not initially utilize the black population. Movement into the Gulf of Mexico attracted the at- tention of both government and industry leaders. Simply moving existing technologies out over open water proved insufficient when structures were exposed to the hurricanes common to the region, and engineers started to experiment with new designs.9 Between 1934 and 1936, the restructur- ing of the oil industry became a central objective toward fulfilling a national goal of establishing a regulatory state (Priest 2004). In 1937, as part of his efforts to establish na- tional control over production of oil and gas, Secretary of Interior Harold Ickes initiated a shift in executive policy re- sulting in a congressional resolution to declare lands under the marginal seas of all the coastal states to be part of the national public domain. Then came World War II. Oil was recognized as vital to national security and young men who worked on the seis- mic and drilling crews were kept home to continue their work. Some young men expressed resentment at being pre- vented from fighting alongside their relatives and neigh- bors, but the message that oil-and those who made it available-was vital to the nation helped bind workers to the industry. Although the war and the presence of German sub- marines in the Gulf of Mexico temporarily halted explo- ration there, oil and gas development accelerated after the war when the materials and labor that had been diverted to the war effort could be directed toward the expanding industry.10 A series of Supreme Court decisions validated</page><page sequence="9">Austin * Coastal Exploitation, Land Loss, and Hurricanes 679 Al.

Laying a pipeline through the marsh alongside a board road. (Source: Jerry Shea, Offshore Oil and Gas History Project, 2001) national claims to the outer continental shelf, and new leg- islation authorized federal leasing and regulation offshore beyond the three-mile limit of state jurisdiction. Offshore exploration and development picked up once again with federal soon exceeding state production." When the initial wells were drilled in southern Louisiana, companies used barges to transport the oil, but after 1942, when the Texas Company laid the first pipeline in the region, pipelines became the primary mode of transport (see Figure 5). Offshore activity caused fewer direct impacts than onshore exploration and drilling, but pipeline canals still required significant dredging. One fam- ily first purchased land in Golden Meadow in 1895 and still possesses a copy of a right-of-way agreement with the Texas Pipeline Company, dated October 14, 1953, and pur- chased for five dollars. Neither the man who signed the agreement nor his son could read or write, and they did not initially grasp the significance of granting the com- pany permission to "lay, construct, operate, maintain, in- spect, repair, replace, change the size of, and remove a pipeline, in whole, or in part, for the transportation of gas, oil, petroleum, or any of its products, water, and other substances, and such other underground equipment and appurtenances as may be necessary or incidental for such operations" (field notes, July 28, 2001). The canal across their property has remained in place for more than 50 years, increasing in width because of ongoing erosion from the banks. The stage was set for rapid expansion, and petroleum and oilfield service companies rapidly came to dominate local economies. At the heart of the new offshore in- dustry, these communities saw unusually rapid growth during the 1950s and experienced a demographic shift toward younger residents. In 1956 and 1957, two large hurricanes passed through the Gulf in areas where numer- ous offshore platforms were located and began to raise industry awareness of the potential for storms to disrupt operations (Pratt 2004). Hurricane Audrey went ashore at Cameron, Louisiana, killing more than 400 people, and be- came one of the costliest storms on record. Oil and gas industry personnel used boats, cranes, and other equip- ment belonging to their companies to undertake rescue ef- forts.

At work on the Louisiana Delta rig. (Source: Kenneth Viator, Offshore Oil and Gas History Project, 2001) matured, developing specialized service sectors comprised of fabrication and shipyards; boat, helicopter, and truck- ing operations; and pipeline and wireline companies. All required land bases and spread both positive and negative impacts across coastal Louisiana and into Texas and Missis- sippi. Significant numbers of locals found wage labor work in the industry, although it was not until the late 1970s that they were hired into supervisory positions; in addition, newcomers arrived from increasingly distant places to set- tle in the area. External interests maintained active control of the offshore industry, but local workers developed and introduced new equipment, techniques, and processes to improve their work environments and increase production. As the industry expanded, southern Louisiana began to experience broader economic impacts, marked by increases in manufacturing, trade, finance, insurance, real estate, and other businesses. Rapid population growth led to further draining of wetlands, conversion of agricultural land, more levee construction, and the development of housing and infrastructure.12 Although clearly linked to the demands of the offshore industry for workers and facilities, they were not the direct result of petroleum exploration or produc- tion and therefore not considered environmental impacts of the industry. Industry jobs were still perceived to be among the best in the region, although work on offshore rigs was recognized as being particularly arduous (see Fig- ure 6). The burgeoning offshore industry-which permitted workers to settle in one community rather than move from place to place, as was common in onshore oilfields-again increased the number residents. Lack of sufficient housing, schools, and public infrastructure continued to plague the region. The 1960s was marked in the United States by efforts to improve the social conditions of poor and marginal- ized groups and respond to the negative environmental impacts of development and industrialization. A century after Louisiana formally abolished slavery, passage of fed- eral Civil Rights legislation brought more changes to the re- gion. The rapidly expanding demand for laborers, coupled with national pressure for desegregation, started to open the doors of many companies in the oil and gas industry to blacks and Native Americans (see Figure 7). Resistance to in- tegration was high; blacks, even those with college degrees, were initially hired as laborers to fill onshore positions va- cated by whites who were taking more lucrative offshore jobs. Lack of formal education proved to be an additional barrier that prevented many from taking advantage of new opportunities.

African. American laborers at a fabrication yard in Amelia, Louisiana. (Source: Dolores Henderson, Offshore Oil and Gas History Project, 2003) in southern Louisiana schools meant separate schools for whites, blacks, and Native Americans; limited opportuni- ties for nonwhites to attend school beyond the eighth grade; and few employment options. Houmas, accustomed to working on the water, found employment on oilfield ves- sels and remained involved in fishing and trapping. A distinguishing feature of the oil and gas industry dur- ing this time was the fierce company loyalty of its employ- ees; at service companies and on rigs and platforms, work- ers maintained thick social ties and related to their com- panies as to family (see Gardner 2002). Employees were loyal to their companies, occupations, and the industry as a whole. That loyalty was derived from a sense of gratitude and pride, and was enforced by company policies about pur- chasing products from or communicating with employees of other companies. At the same time, the Deep South re- mained distinct from elsewhere in the United States, and the separation was exacerbated by the violence and hos- tility associated with the Civil Rights era. Several attempts at organizing oilfield workers failed, reflecting local distrust of outside organizers, ongoing antiunion sentiments, fear of union effects on the relationships between petroleum workers and companies, and active antiunion campaigns by industry leaders. Onshore and offshore activity peaked by 1970, al- though development continued at a frenzied pace. Demand for labor outpaced supply. Initially the presence of relatively high-paying jobs that did not require any formal education contributed to high dropout rates, but by the 1970s the la- bor needs of the oil and gas industry hastened the push for schooling and contributed to changes in local language and culture. Local chambers of commerce and companies seek- ing workers devised various advertising schemes for finding workers and drawing them in. The national recession of the late 1970s pushed people from across the United States to the region. A relatively permanent class of labor was created to fill the least desirable positions, such as tank cleaning and sandblasting. Workers were recruited via vans that drove through the poor neighborhoods of New Orleans;13 some were loaded onto boats and delivered offshore while others</page><page sequence="12">682 American Anthropologist * Vol. 108, No. 4 * December 2006 . . .......

Lillian Miller, first female to work outside the galley in the Gulf of Mexico, on a production platform in 1978. (Source: Lillian Miller, Offshore Oil and Gas History Project, 2004) were housed in labor camps established in the communities located at the center of the industry activity (Higgins 2005). Residents' concerns about the labor camps led to local or- dinances and the relocation of camps outside city limits. Exploration and production moved farther offshore during this period, accompanied by the adoption of new technologies, changes in work scheduling, and recruitment of workers from greater distances.'4 The offshore industry spurred the development of specialized boats and vessels to transport people and equipment to rigs and platforms. Highly skilled Cajun mariners, many with little formal ed- ucation, became critical within the Gulf region and were soon recognized worldwide as offshore fields were devel- oped in the North Sea and elsewhere. Few Cajuns attained great wealth or power, but the entry of large numbers into well-paying jobs and the special recognition they received, at a time when Cajunism was undergoing a revival, fur- ther strengthened ties between southern Louisiana and the industry.15 With the rise of the industry, regional economic and political power shifted from the plantation to the oil field, although decision making remained largely in the hands of a small number of wealthy individuals. Women had played significant roles in the indus- try since World War II, but they remained largely hid- den in offices and clerical positions until the 1970s when companies were forced by federal civil rights laws and guide- lines to begin hiring women in offshore jobs (see Figure 8). Still, throughout the offshore industry, even in support sectors that evolved locally, industry leaders and workers reinforced stereotypical notions of southern women and distinguished between men's and women's work. Despite myriad women who worked in the fields, on traplines, and on fishing vessels and demonstrated otherwise, the south- ern image of the helpless female was fostered within the industry and persisted (see Austin 2005). In the mid-1980s the petroleum industry suffered a severe downturn. The Gulf of Mexico came to be called "the Dead Sea" by petroleum industry insiders. Downsiz- ing, bankruptcies, and layoffs were common; many work- ers were forced to take severance packages only a few years before reaching retirement age.16 Workers recruited from outside the region and even many Louisiana residents were forced to leave the state in search of jobs elsewhere; the ex- odus of both skilled and unskilled laborers led to a host of other social problems (Gramling and Brabant 1984; Laska et al. 1993). In addition to the loss of jobs, both the state and local governments were affected by a decrease in tax revenues. To counter low and declining oil prices, the state</page><page sequence="13">Austin * Coastal Exploitation, Land Loss, and Hurricanes 683 raised sales, corporate franchise, and gasoline taxes. In 1986, some exemptions for food, drugs, and utilities were lifted, making Louisiana's tax structure more regressive (Davis 1988). Since the 1980s, the oil and gas industry has been subject to a series of downturns affecting price and de- mand. Industry restructuring during the 1980s and 1990s reduced the number of workers at all levels and consolidated managerial and engineering functions in Houston, moving them away from southern Louisiana and even New Orleans and reflecting Louisiana's relative weakness within the in- dustry. New exploration technologies renewed the search for inland and nearshore deposits. By the mid-1990s, the level of activity in the Gulf of Mexico increased significantly with the passage of royalty relief measures and the rapid ex- pansion of offshore deepwater development. Today, ultra- deepwater facilities operate in waters more than 5,000 feet deep, and the Gulf of Mexico supplies more than 20 per- cent of the natural gas and almost 30 percent of the crude oil produced in the United States. Analysts estimate that the U.S. outer continental shelf contains about 19 percent of the nation's proven natural gas reserves and 18 percent of its proven oil reserves. When Hurricane Katrina struck, there were 5,851 active platforms operating in the Gulf of Mexico on a total of 1,356 leases (OCS Bulletin Board System; www.ocsbbs.com). In an era of soaring company profits, some have questioned the continued application of royalty relief (Andrews 2006a, 2006b), but demands for change are rare (see Houck 2006). Through the boom of the 1960s and 1970s, downturn of the 1980s, and industry reorganization of the 1990s, the social and political landscape of oil and gas development across the nation changed little. A key issue in the 2000 pres- idential race was the promise-made by both candidates- to extend moratoria on offshore development off the coasts of Florida and California to protect them from the possi- ble negative consequences of offshore drilling. Yet, none of the political leaders in either party suggested that Louisiana might deserve the same consideration. Louisiana politi- cians, long tied to the oil and gas industry, continued to promote exploration and production; although they sought increased revenue sharing of monies already collected by the federal government, they showed no support for efforts to increase the amount companies would pay or to demand that the companies pay directly for damage caused by their actions. On September 2, 2005, of 96 rotary rigs drilling in U.S. offshore waters, 81 were located off the coast of Louisiana, ten off of Texas, four off of California, and one off of Florida. THE LEGACY The legal distinction among onshore, nearshore, and off- shore regions has had huge consequences for Louisiana's economy and ecology. State authority extends to on- shore and nearshore properties; leases there have brought taxes and royalties directly to state coffers. Struggles have ensued between the agencies responsible for natural re- sources development and the various offices and programs that emerged to protect the environment. Offshore is the province of the federal government. Revenues collected by the U.S. MMS flow directly to the federal Office of Manage- ment and Budget where some are redistributed to the states. States can only tax the pipelines flowing across state prop- erty and the onshore properties associated with offshore activity, such as fabrication yards and waste disposal facil- ities. From labor to environmental practices, the offshore industry is governed by laws and regulations developed for the entire nation, and influenced by states such as California where environmental protection is afforded rel- atively high status."7 Economics Oil and gas brought untold wealth to some in southern Louisiana-indeed, most long-time residents relate stories of the days when communities there boasted the largest per capita ownership of Rolls Royces in the country-but not everyone benefited from the industry. Critical analyses have included the extraction of tax concessions, environmental pollution, and wetlands destruction as economic costs of the industry, and they have examined efforts to diversify and strengthen alternative economic sectors (ECONorth- west 1997; Louisiana Economic Development [LED] 2003). Louisiana's ethnic and racial minorities have borne the brunt of income, education, and health care deficiencies within the state. Even with large-scale improvement dur- ing the 1960s and 1970s, educational attainment has lagged behind most other regions of the country. In 1990, the 12 parishes of south-central Louisiana in which oil and gas ac- tivity has been extensive had the state's lowest high school completion rate at 60 percent (Schafer and Brown 2004), compared to a national rate that fluctuates between 85 and 87 percent (Kaufman et al. 2001). The surge in oil and gas activity during the mid-1990s was a result of technological and corporate changes, coupled with a steady increase in the global demand for oil. However, a significant consequence of the industry restructuring and new development in federal offshore wa- ters has been a decline in the positive benefits to Louisiana. Petroleum revenues, which comprised half the state's bud- get in the 1970s, now account for only about 20 percent of the total gross state product (LED 2003). During the 1990s, despite the increase in oil and gas industry activity, growth in oil- and gas-related employment levels continued to be low (Deseran and Tobin 2003). Workers' confidence in the oil and gas industry as a reliable source of money and employment in southern Louisiana has waned; no longer are offshore jobs deemed superior to other forms of employ- ment, neither are such positions seen as desirable by many. The diminished industry presence in the coastal commu- nities was notable following Katrina and Rita. In contrast to prior storms, neither the employees nor equipment of energy and service companies were central to rescue efforts.</page><page sequence="14">684 American Anthropologist * Vol. 108, No. 4 * December 2006 With local benefits reduced, who has gained in recent years? Energy companies and their stockholders are the biggest winners. Oil and gas prices, already high prior to the hurricanes, reached record levels afterward. Corpora- tions such as Exxon Mobil and Shell reported huge earnings during the past several years and announced record profits in 2005. Also, the U.S. government is highly dependent on rev- enues generated offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. The U.S. MMS collects royalty payments from the rigs and platforms located on the outer continental shelf on behalf of the fed- eral government.18 State officials argue that Louisiana does not receive revenues commensurate with offshore industry impacts and have tried for an increase in revenue sharing based on those effects. At the same time, the state relies on revenues from both onshore and offshore development. Be- tween 1986 and 2002, Louisiana received nearly $1 billion of the $127 billion disbursed (MMS 2003). Today, southern Louisiana's agriculture and fishing are also in trouble. Sugar plays a reduced role in southern Louisiana's economy and is heavily reliant on government subsidies. Slow growth rates of cypress trees and inability to farm the species prevented a return of the timber indus- try to the southern part of the state. Commercial fishing is also under pressure. The price of shrimp has been in de- cline since the early 1980s; in 2003, Louisiana shrimp prices were, in real terms adjusted to the Consumer Price Index, less than they were in 1950 (Marks 2005). There are many causes of the price collapse, but shrimpers argue the most important is a flood of imported shrimp, much of it farm raised, into the U.S. market. Confronting the Environmental Changes Equally devastating for southern Louisiana has been the en- vironmental legacy left by the sugar, timber, and, petroleum industries, with direct contamination and coastal land loss among the leading negative impacts. Oil- and gas-related impacts are widespread and, because of common industry practices such as dredging and the use of shallow open pits for waste disposal, even if political leaders demonstrated the will to hold industry officials accountable, it would be challenging to identify responsible parties. Such challenges are exacerbated by the selling and reselling of companies and leases; the major energy companies and the larger in- dependent ones have divested themselves of onshore and nearshore properties, leaving them in the hands of smaller independent firms with limited financial backing. Even prior to Katrina, Louisiana faced significant problems associated with environmental contamination. Widespread pollution associated with the petroleum and petrochemical industries contributed to the state's active and growing grassroots environmental justice movement, although the focus has been on downstream activities at refineries and waste facilities rather than upstream explo- ration and production (see Austin 1999; Camacho 1998; Roberts and Toffolon-Weiss 2001). Although toxic releases to the environment have declined significantly since the late 1980s, when the state led the nation on many nega- tive environmental indicators, the legacy of past practices remains.19 Connections among industry leaders and local, state, and federal politicians, although challenging to sort out, are of major significance in explaining Louisiana's on- going relationship to the oil and gas industry (see Sherrill 1968; Williams 1969). A brief look at oilfield waste pol- icy is illustrative of how power relations and inequali- ties, which are at the intersection of local and national concerns, have affected natural and social processes over time. Initially, with little direction or guidance from the fed- eral government, states established laws and policies to govern waste generated in the exploration and production phases of petroleum development, generally moving from unregulated discharge of wastes directly into the environ- ment to efforts to create surface disposal pits and finally procedures for injecting the wastes into the earth through abandoned oil and gas wells.20 Louisiana began to regulate the drilling and production of oil in gas in 1939 and signif- icantly amended the regulations on several occasions (see Austin and McGuire 2001 for details). Yet, scientists, poli- cymakers, and activists have argued that despite adequate laws, the widespread use of exceptions and lack of enforce- ment of regulations have failed to protect the environment and human health from the consequences of oilfield waste disposal. In the 1970s, when many in the United States were establishing environmental protection laws, policies, and practices, Louisiana's Governor Edwin Edwards was ac- tively promoting the use of southern Louisiana for haz- ardous waste disposal (see Berry 1984). In 1980, Congress amended the nation's waste law, and under pressure from industry officials, specifically exempted from regulation as hazardous all wastes "associated with the exploration, development, and production of crude oil and natural gas or geothermal energy," regardless of their composition (Section 3001[b] [2] [A]) of the 1980 Amendments to the Re- source Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Congress deferred regulation of exploration and production wastes to state authority. Despite several efforts to incorporate these wastes in the nation's hazardous waste regulatory frame- work, they remain largely exempt under federal regulation. A major exception is waste produced in offshore oil and gas exploration and production activities, which must be brought onshore for treatment and disposal and ends up in commercial facilities in Louisiana and Texas (see Austin and McGuire 2001 for details). Responding to growing concern about the environ- ment, in the mid-1980s, Governor David Treen established the Department of Environmental Quality as a separate de- partment to operate the state's environmental protection programs. The Department of Natural Resources retained responsibility for overall regulation of oil and gas facilities, but some of the key industry supporters were transferred to the new department.21 The reorganization nevertheless</page><page sequence="15">Austin * Coastal Exploitation, Land Loss, and Hurricanes 685 provided a new institutional structure under which regula- tion of oilfield waste could occur. Between 1988 and 1992, after the severe downturn in the offshore industry, Governor Buddy Roemer pro- moted greater regulation of industry and allowed the state's Department of Environmental Quality to pursue policies aimed at increasing environmental protection, making him an anomaly among Louisiana leaders. Working with grass- roots, trade, and environmental organizations, state admin- istrators galvanized citizens to action and received support for the regulation of oilfield wastes, as well as other envi- ronmental protection regulations. Such actions generated significant response by national oil and gas interests (see Austin and McGuire 2002). For example in 1990, in re- sponse to a decision to regulate produced water, a class of production discharges that had been studied extensively for more than 50 years and was regulated in most oil-producing states, the Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of En- ergy requested that the state delay action until the agency could complete a study. The following year, a coalition of the American Petroleum Institute, Independent Petroleum Association of America, and Mid-Continent Oil and Gas As- sociation created the Alliance for a Strong Louisiana Econ- omy to challenge the regulation of oilfield waste and later oppose taxes on oil and gas. The Roemer administration had several successes, but with the 1992 election of a new governor and replacement of key administrators, regula- tions that were not overturned were ignored. Since then, some progress has been made in waste management, but the larger problem of widespread contamination has not been addressed. An estimated seven million gallons of oil were spilled as a result of Hurricane Katrina (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] 2005), and ar- senic, volatile organic compounds, and other toxics were spread across the region (McElduff 2005). Coastal land loss poses even greater challenges for those seeking solutions. Although astute observers had been try- ing to call attention to coastal land loss since at least the 1920s (Viosca 1928), and local residents had been watch- ing their fields and orchards disappear for decades (Davis 2001), it was not until the 1980s that the problems be- gan to get widespread attention. In contrast to toxic sites, which can be readily observed, land loss is difficult to see and even more complicated to address. Shifting patterns of river deposition and erosion, underground faulting, ongo- ing subsidence of coastal lands, and unpredictability related to the size of hurricanes and where they make landfall all created a sense of uncertainty among residents and fostered a sense that change was inevitable and that ecosystems and communities could be devastated and then rebuilt. Large- scale human-induced changes, such as the construction and destruction of levees, demonstrated that not all im- pacts were natural or random, but across much of southern Louisiana it remained difficult to verify loss and attribute responsibility.22 Southern Louisianans did not widely embrace the pop- ular environmentalism that took hold across the United States during the 1970s. Trappers were angered by the de- crease in fur demand related to environmental campaign- ing, and commercial fishermen opposed efforts to impose environmental regulations in the Gulf. With both the fish- ing and oil industries booming, the environmental conse- quences of dredging pipeline canals and disposing of oilfield waste were generally accepted as externalities of the busi- ness. Still, responding to national policies of the decade, including requirements for coastal zone management, the state legislature established a commission on coastal and marine resources, and the first comprehensive assessment of coastal erosion in Louisiana was undertaken. Through- out the decade, resources were devoted to scientific research at unprecedented scales, and the definition of coastal zone impacts in Louisiana was broadened to include both on- shore and offshore impacts of outer continental shelf activ- ity. The more the issue was studied, the greater the problem appeared to be. Yet, little action was taken until the late 1980s, when the oil and gas industry was suffering and wetlands loss was linked to increased hurricane threat and to the loss of important estuary functions. In 1987 a federal-state part- nership of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Louisiana Geological Survey convened a panel to study coastal erosion; unsurprisingly, the panel's final report noted that the problem of coastal land loss had been rec- ognized for 20 years but had generated no comprehensive solutions (Louisiana Wetland Protection Panel 1987). The report's authors also observed that, although additional sci- entific research would be needed along the way, sufficient information was available to commence the development of a plan for saving Louisiana's wetlands. The panel called for federal, state, and local governments and the private sec- tor to join forces to address the loss of Louisiana's wetlands. Also in 1987, Congress established the National Estu- ary Program with the goal to protect estuaries' public water supply; shellfish, fish, and wildlife populations; and recre- ational opportunities for estuary residents. In 1990, the BTNEP was established in Louisiana as a coalition of gov- ernment, private, and commercial interests, and a year later it published a comprehensive conservation management plan designed to safeguard the estuary for future genera- tions (BTNEP 1991). Also that year, Congress passed the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act (CWPPRA) to fund wetland enhancement projects nation- wide, with approximately $50 million designated annu- ally for work in Louisiana. Concerns about the continued high rate of land loss and whether CWPPRA funds were be- ing spent most effectively led to Coast 2050, a statewide planning effort comprised of elements of previous efforts, along with new initiatives from private citizens, local gov- ernments, state and federal agency personnel, and the sci- entific community. Prior to Katrina, only a fraction of the $14 billion outlined in the Coast 2050 Plan as necessary for restoring natural drainage along the coast and moving sediment to the marshes has been acquired. Scientific and policy debates over both causes and solutions continue.</page><page sequence="16">686 American Anthropologist * Vol. 108, No. 4 * December 2006 Despite mention of oil and gas extraction in the 1987 panel report, attempts to link coastal land loss to the oil and gas industry have drawn quick criticism from industry officials and their government allies. Gene Turner's (1997) argument that canal dredging was responsible for the vast majority of wetland loss was criticized by the president of the Louisiana Land and Exploration Company as well as scientists (Streever 2001). Several years later, arguments that oil and gas extraction was responsible for extensive subsidence-and therefore major wetlands loss-in south- ern parishes were similarly criticized by industry leaders.23 Oliver Houck summarized Louisiana's relationship to the oil and gas industry: Here is the elephant in the room. It is sitting very qui- etly. We have an understanding. We don't make it mad. We'll get along just fine. ... We let the largest party in coastal destruction walk away from the table without pay- ing, while we in turn pay no end of public subsidies for people to build and live in the hurricane zone. [2006:17, 30] The complex relationship between the oil and gas in- dustry and southern Louisiana communities, further com- pounded by their fluctuating populations, has complicated local response to both contaminated sites and coastal land loss. Many people find work offshore or in supporting industries. Oil development has meant money for infras- tructure, roads, schools, and jobs. Consequently, coastal communities entered into an interdependence with the in- dustry that complicates community "stakeholder" interests. Then, when locals have found spaces within which to con- test industry practices, national interests have intervened. With natural gas prices high, energy companies are reevaluating the coastal wetlands and their potential for giving up even more oil and gas. Despite the evidence of the linkages among subsidence, land loss, and oil and gas extraction, there is little public or private interrogation of new development. A recent proposal to dredge a channel to move Mississippi River water into the wetlands was pro- moted by a consortium of companies from the offshore industry and supported by President George W. Bush; how- ever, it was rejected by ecologists as an effort by industry leaders to get a new and deeper navigation channel. As the loss of wetlands is threatening structures, pipelines, and more, some energy companies have begun to pay attention. Shell is the lead partner in America's Wetlands, a program to save Louisiana's wetlands. Prior to installing a new pipeline a few years ago, BP (once known as British Petroleum, but which now exclusively goes by "BP") consulted with ecol- ogists about least damaging place to lay pipe within the Barataria-Terrebonne estuary. Still, in the midst of national policies to gain control of and develop petroleum supplies wherever possible, there is no serious discussion of chang- ing priorities. U.S. citizens and political leaders from else- where maintain an interest in how conditions in region will affect the price they pay for oil and gas, but little else. Water development programs, with their well- entrenched promoters from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Congress, and industry, operate as they have for decades. In the aftermath of one of the worst disas- ters to befall the United States, despite evidence of the deficiencies of existing structures (Roth 2005), pressure for new engineering solutions was at its peak. Thus, even amid heightened concern about land loss and recognition of the ultimate fallibility of levees and their need for high levels of maintenance, state legislators sought-and won-an amendment to the Louisiana Constitution to include hurricane protection (e.g., levees) as an authorized expenditure of the state's Wetlands Conservation and Restoration Fund. In the end, cries for coastal restoration had been overtaken by calls for more levees. Within local economies, the continued exploitation of offshore fields, coupled with the ongoing development of new technologies for locating reserves onshore, has stymied recognition of the end of the petroleum era and the need for alternatives. Even with acknowledgement of the problems of dependency on oil and gas, and awareness by at least some community leaders that the former prosperity is un- likely to return, local leaders vie for new dredging projects to deepen channels for the new generation of larger off- shore vessels headed for the huge deepwater projects. They see few alternatives. Adapted to an industry that provided hundreds of jobs at large facilities, economic development staffs have had a hard time envisioning anything else. THE VAST REACH OF SEEMINGLY LOCAL PROBLEMS Southern Louisiana's landscape has been highly manipu- lated for centuries, and the present conditions can only be understood in light of the processes and changes to which it has been subjected. Early settlers sought the isolation of- fered by natural ridges separated by vast expanses of wet- lands. Planters moved in and amassed large landholdings; their investment in levees, drainage ditches, and naviga- tion channels enhanced their position with New Orleans merchants and helped secure their social and economic sta- tus while bringing about significant environmental change. Planters' participation in the slave trade brought large num- bers of blacks; later planters also recruited immigrants from Europe and Asia. Timber and early oil development main- tained wealth in the hands of a few, expanded the dredging of canals, and accelerated the erosion caused by their use. Federal land distribution policies, coupled with water de- velopment projects that dammed, pumped, and channeled wetlands, sped the conversion to private land. They also distributed enough benefits across the region to keep every- one happy. Onshore oil development brought a new wave of capitalists and hoards of oilfield workers. Until petroleum development moved offshore, the pat- tern of exploitation of land and labor was similar to that of places across the globe where outsiders came in and gained control over both natural resources and labor processes. Fed- eral and state officials were linked to their interests. The</page><page sequence="17">Austin * Coastal Exploitation, Land Loss, and Hurricanes 687 offshore oil and gas industry extended participation in the petroleum industry beyond the elite classes, facilitating its acceptance. The emerging industry depended on the in- genuity and hard labor of the local workforce and was at the same time the vehicle through which this workforce flourished. Yet, the industry, like its predecessors, has been steadily contributing to large-scale environmental changes. In the transition from sugar to timber and then to oil, capitalists were able to trade off one resource for another with the value measured only in dollars and no accounting for per- manent loss of wetland resources and benefits. Within the past decades, local residents whose families trace their ar- rival in the region to the 1700s have watched their orchards, fields, and farms disappear, associated with the dramatic in- crease in surface area caused by canal dredging and the in- creased subsidence because of oil and gas extraction. As the resources on which their wealth depended disappeared-- first the plantations, then the forests, and now the oil and gas-many of those who made money have left the region. For those who remain, the building of levees, cutting of trees, digging of canals, drilling of wells, and contamina- tion from well fields have created long-term environmental changes that preclude a return to past livelihood strategies. Yet, as evidenced by the vehement opposition to sugges- tions that their communities will not be rebuilt, the south- ern Louisiana residents who remain will not readily leave their homeland behind. Louisiana's approach to economic development mir- rored that of other southern states, and of Third World countries, and it presents a tragic example of failure to balance the state's role as developer and steward of its re- sources (Bryant and Bailey 2000). The state's wetlands have provided free-and critical-ecosystem services. As a buffer from storm surge and a sink for wastes, they have helped mitigate the problems caused by industrial development. With their disappearance, development costs rise. Under other circumstances, the decline of the plantation econ- omy might have resulted in the abandonment of levees, canals, and other features (Fisher 2005). However, the need to access, acquire, and move timber and then oil and gas- accompanied by the desire to protect the growing human population that moved into the region-assured the main- tenance and expansion of these structures. Their concomi- tant contribution to the destruction of the coastal wetlands was not anticipated or recognized. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita exposed the social, po- litical, and environmental problems in which southern Louisiana communities have become mired. Even before the abject failure of the federal, state, and local governments to adequately construct and maintain New Orleans's levees was made public, locals expressed disappointment in the in- ability of their own elected officials and other U.S. leaders to respond effectively to these immense storms. By Novem- ber, residents and local leaders had been dealing with the storms' impacts for two months and their exhaustion and frustration threatened to overwhelm even the most func- tional of the systems that remained. Those experienced with hurricanes recalled how they usually moved through three phases: evacuation, waiting out the storm, and then clean- ing up and getting back to normal. What had become ob- vious even then was that there would be no return to any- thing they would recognize as "normal." More than half a year later, visitors continued to be struck by how little has actually been done; local trust in government, which was never great, has plummeted. In the public debate about the future, Louisianan's voices are notably absent. Louisiana's ecology and social problems will not be readily fixed; corrective action must involve the af- fected populations working through institutions that have demonstrated the ability to incorporate a wide range of divergent interests and opinions. Yet, leaving southern Louisianans to themselves to address their problems is un- just, especially in the absence of the resources and finan- cial wealth that were extracted from the region and in the presence of inadequate systems of governance. Local gov- ernment and industry policies to promote inland drilling operations, advance dredging, and limit regulation of oil- field waste facilities have contributed to the legacy. So, too, have national policies to construct levees on the Mississippi River, promote oil and gas development in Louisiana, and exempt oilfield waste from federal regulation. Although land degradation problems have frequently led scholars to focus almost exclusively at the local scale, southern Louisiana's predicament is a stark reminder that even ap- parently local problems have regional and global roots. Seriously engaging southern Louisianans will not be easy. Many people fled the hurricanes and have been unable or unwilling to return. Government and public responses to the recent hurricanes have not inspired confidence in those who remained. Few planning commissions have made any room at all for local participants. Over the past decade, ed- ucational opportunities have increased at the same time young people have witnessed their parents' struggles to sur- vive in petroleum industry-related jobs and thus have been discouraged from working in oil and gas. Confronted also with vast negative environmental and social legacies, many have chosen to leave. As these young people establish ties outside the region, they support the movement of their fam- ily members as well. Future hurricanes are likely to further the out-migration of younger residents who can escape. But where should they go? Louisiana's problems are particular to its geology, topography, and natural resource base; the consequences of its massive environmental dam- age are obvious; and its position vis-a-vis more powerful regions of the United States have contributed to its degra- dation. Still it is not unique as a site where anthropogenic change has reduced the capacity of the environment to sup- port its human population. Across the arid southwest, cities are slowly sinking into spaces once occupied by groundwa- ter. Throughout the United States, aging infrastructure- dams, roads, and pipelines, to name a few-require enor- mous investment and yet receive little serious attention. Problems in Louisiana and other places at the periphery are</page><page sequence="18">688 American Anthropologist * Vol. 108, No. 4 * December 2006 the most readily apparent, but the core, too, is headed to- ward collapse as it becomes increasingly incapable of draw- ing in resources from ever-more-distant places. During my November 2005 trip to southern Louisiana, I interacted with many people who had come to the re- gion to offer assistance, often with good intentions but lit- tle knowledge of what was needed. One man arrived with a truckload of supplies from his community and only a vague notion of where he was, but he took the time to participate in discussions about local issues and the problems the com- munities were facing. As he neared the end of his stay and was preparing to head home, he asked me to explain coastal land loss so he could go home and share the information with his neighbors. With the help of a napkin and pen, I diagrammed rivers and sediment flow and talked about sur- face area and subsidence. I explained the connections to canal dredging, oil and gas extraction, and more. As I fin- ished talking, he remarked that he had driven 700 miles to deliver his unsolicited truckload of goods. He looked at me, paused, and then said, "I guess I'm part of the problem." He has plenty of company. DIANE E.

The research on which this article is based was supported by several contracts between the MMS and the Uni- versity of Arizona. I served as principal investigator and Thomas McGuire as coprincipal investigator. I gratefully acknowledge over a dozen team members whose data and ideas contributed to the research studies and this article, and I thank the editor of Ameri- can Anthropologist and several anonymous AA reviewers for their insightful comments. Special appreciation goes to the residents and leaders of southern Louisiana who willingly participated in the studies and served as gracious hosts to the research team, and to the staff of the Morgan City Archives for their continuing as- sistance. Dr. Harry Luton championed and supervised the studies in the Gulf of Mexico Region, MMS, New Orleans. Dr. Rodney did likewise at the agency's headquarters in Herndon, Virginia. Both are to be thanked for their unwavering support. The findings, how- ever, do not necessarily reflect the views and policies of the MMS. 1. For example, Suhayda was featured on a NOVA television broad- cast in September 2002 (Public Broadcasting Service 2002). Similar predictions were repeated by Greg Brouwer (2003) in Civil Engineer- ing, by Joel Bourne Jr. (2004) in National Geographic, and by many others. Yet, as Oliver Houck noted, "Detailed reporting in local pa- pers, science colloquiums, National Geographic, NOVA, and gov- ernment planning sessions predicting this very storm in this very way with these very results were tossed away like so many Mardi Gras beads" (2006:3). 2. Every two miles of wetland reduce storm surge by about a half a foot. Louisiana has lost nearly 2,000 square miles of wetlands since the 1930s. 3. Modern problems that are deemed "environmental" reflect fail- ures in dominant economic, social, political, and value systems; they emerge from environmental change of a nature and scope that renders existing knowledge inadequate and requires decision mak- ing under conditions of complexity and uncertainty (Austin 2004). Of particular concern, those who benefit from activities that result in environmental damage are often far removed from the negative effects and ignorant of them. 4. My first work in Louisiana was as a member of a team conducting a baseline study of the impacts of oil and gas development on the U.S. outer continental shelf (OCS) on communities along the Gulf of Mexico (Wallace et al. 2001). Later I helped design and conduct more focused studies of the impacts of working offshore on work- ers, families, and their communities (Austin et al. 2002; Austin and McGuire 2002); the effects of oilfield waste disposal policies and practices on southern Louisiana (Austin and McGuire 2001); and the history and evolution of the offshore oil and gas industry and its effects on southern Louisiana (Austin et al. 2004). More specific in- formation concerning methodology, data, and results can be found in those publications. Shortly after Katrina struck, in response to friends in southern Louisiana who were frustrated by their inability to communicate with those outside their communities, I organized a group of University of Arizona colleagues and students to put to- gether a website providing background information on southern Louisiana. That website contains considerably more detail than can be provided here (see http://gulfstorms.org). 5. Oyster fishers were even more successful in securing reparations; see McGuire, this issue. 6. The history and ongoing struggle of Native Americans in south Louisiana is complex and highly politicized. At the time I began work in the region, most people self-identified as Houma Indians and were members of the United Houma Nation, a state-recognized tribe. I refer to people ever associated with that group as Houmas. In the mid-1990s, the tribe's petition for federal recognition was de- nied; several tribal members withdrew and organized new groups, which subsequently petitioned for federal recognition. In 2004, the Louisiana state legislature acknowledged the Native American an- cestry of the members of several of these groups so their members could gain access to federal programs designated for American In- dians. Lack of awareness of the complex situation led to significant problems for hurricane response as federal and private agencies were confronted with what appeared to be multiple tribes request- ing assistance. 7. "The cypress lumber industry witnessed the death of many un- named and unknown victims of the lurking dangers of the swampy forests-the felling of the stately trees, the axe of the woodsmen, the treacherous drifts of rivers and bayous, and last, the perils of disease-malaria, known as swamp fever" (Norgress 1947:1000). 8. The company expanded from its status as a land and explo- ration company and grew to be one of the largest independent oil and gas exploration companies based in the United States, the owner of about one-seventh of the wetlands in coastal Louisiana (Reier 1990). The company merged with Burlington Resources in 1997 to create the first "super-independent" oil company in the United States (Anonymous 1997). Burlington Resources merged with ConocoPhillips in March 2006 (Anonymous 2006). 9. The impacts of hurricanes on offshore oil and gas development in the Gulf of Mexico have been carefully chronicled by historian Joseph Pratt (2004). 10. Surplus equipment brought back from the war proved vital to early offshore efforts, from PT boats that companies such as Shell and Kerr-McGee converted for use as seismograph vessels to land- ing ship, tanks (LSTs) that were taken into the Gulf and used as living quarters for those working on drilling rigs. Key technologies and equipment developed during the war jump-started the new off- shore industry and remained vital to the industry for more than a decade. The war also affected men's attitudes; they learned to work under dangerous conditions, take orders without questioning their superiors, and rely on their superiors to look after their safety (see Penney 2006). 11. In 1954, 13 million barrels of oil were produced in state waters and three million on the federal OCS; by 1969, the year the Na- tional Environmental Policy Act was passed, 67 million barrels of oil were produced in Louisiana state waters and 300 million on the outer continental shelf. 12. Between 1930 and 1990, Louisiana's population doubled, from 2,101,593 to 4,219,973. Several southern parishes nearly tripled their populations. Onshore development accounted for the boom in some places. For example, Houma experienced a 96 percent in- crease in population between 1950 and 1960.</page><page sequence="19">Austin * Coastal Exploitation, Land Loss, and Hurricanes 689 13. This pattern was followed in the search for post-Katrina labor, though, with the emptying of many New Orleans neighborhoods, vans and buses traveled to cities such as Atlanta to find workers, many of whom were immigrants. 14. Work scheduling is among the most researched aspects of off- shore oil and gas work (see Shrimpton and Storey 2001 for a synthe- sis). Two facets of offshore work schedules have received attention because of their impacts on work-family relationships: work be- yond the 40 hour week and work other than the 8-to-5 work day. Common schedules include 12-hour workdays of seven days on and seven days off, 14 and 14, and 28 and 28. In some sectors, such as commercial oilfield diving, workers are on-call seven days a week, 24 hours a day (see Austin 2003; Austin et al. 2002). 15. Despite the lack of Cajun legal autonomy, the establishment of the Cajun mariner crystallized what Hechter has termed a "cultural division of labor" (1999:9). However, this occupational specializa- tion by ethnicity occurred not within a population of recent immi- grants but in one that continually adapted to changing economic conditions. 16. This was a particular problem for many blacks who were hired during the 1960s and had not yet reached retirement age with their companies. 17. California was a site of active coastal oil and gas development in the early 20th century, but by the 1970s, stimulated by the Santa Barbara oil spill of 1969, widespread resistance to oil and gas devel- opment had curtailed the offshore industry there (see Freudenburg and Gramling 1994). 18. Almost $4.3 billion per year, on average, is collected and dis- tributed by MMS from bonuses, rents, and royalties from Federal offshore mineral leases (MMS 2003). Of these funds, $3.2 billion per year go to the U.S. Treasury and the states, $900 million per year go to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and $150 million per year go to the National Historic Preservation Fund. 19. Louisiana reported 153,041,482 pounds of toxics to the EPA in its Toxics Release Inventory program in 1994 versus 947,552,623 in 1988 (www.scorecard.org/env-releases/state.tcl?fips-state-code= 22#datasummary). 20. This aspect of U.S. environmental policy, devolving as much authority as possible from the federal government to the states, results in environmental degradation related directly to power in- equality among states (Boyce et al. 1999). 21. A reporter for the capitol's alternative press observed, "Natural Resources had the reputation of being more of an industry apologist than watchdog, and cooperation with industry is still [Department of Environmental Quality director] Dale Givens' preferred way of doing business" (Adamo 1987). 22. Plaquemines and St. Bernard parishes were deliberately flooded by breaking levees during the 1927 flood, ostensibly to protect New Orleans (Barry 1997). 23. Wetland conversion in Louisiana reached its peak between 1960 and the late 1970s when coastal marshes disappeared at an average rate of 30 to 40 square miles per year (Morton et al. 2005; Morton et al. 2002). Removal of oil, gas, and produced water caused a drop in subsurface pressure, activated underground faults, and resulted in slumping. In his popular National Geographic article, "Gone with the Water," Joel Bourne Jr. brings the technical data from the geological analyses to the general public and observes, "The oil industry and its consultants dispute Morton's theory, but they've been unable to disprove it" (2004). K. Shinkle and Roy Dokka (2004) argue that the high rates of sinking correspond to un- derground faulting, and that subsidence along the entire coast has occurred because of both natural and anthropomorphic factors- oil and gas extraction being only one of several factors.
