On March 31, 1995, représentatives of the Guatemalan government and members of the Revolutionary National Union of Guatemala (URNG) signed an agreement in Mexico-City dealing with the identity and rights of the Maya in Guatemala. According to this agreement, the Guatemalan government is obliged to reform various elements of the Constitution a to sign a variety of new laws to guarantee equal rights for Mayas and Ladinos. Ethnie discrimination will be prohibited explicitely in the Constitu tion. Further aspects are concemed with the Maya languages and religion. The Constitution will acknowledge Guatemala as a multiethnic, multilingual and multicultural State. Bilin gual éducation will become the norm. Whether this ambitious agreement will in fact be realized is not certain as it still has to be ratified by the congress. Furthermore, the changes will only be realized within the framework of a final peace treaty. This still dépends on the solution of five other topics conceming land reform and the position of the army. Maya hieroglyphs discovered in a Guatemalan cave GRAZ (Karl H. Mayer). On March 2nd, 1995, Nikolai Grube of mexicon was informed by Benjamin Granados, an employ ée of the Guatemalan Instituto de Antropología e Historia (IDAEH), that he had discovered a cave with a "carved monkey" eight years ago when he was living in the small village of La Cobanerita, south of Flores, the capital of the Guatemalan department of Peten. This cave is actually one of several caves near La Cobanerita. One large cave containing Precolumbian findings, was reported by Eduardo Cuc, the alcalde auxiliar of La Cobanerita, to the Guatemalan author ities (SEGEPLAN) and has been inspected a few times by personell of IDAEH. The exact history of this particular cave has yet to be written. On March 3, 1995 a trip was organized to visit the cave région. Members of this trip included Oscar Quintana Samayoa and Wolfgang Wurster of the Guatemalan German archaeological Triangle Project, Don Benjamín as the guide, and Nikolai Grube. La Cobanerita is a small Q'eqchi' speaking Community situated only a few kilométrés west of the main road leading from Flores to La Libertad, connected by a small dirt road. In La Cobanerita Eduardo Cuc joined the group and guided it to three caves in the karst région east of the village and about 3 kilométrés west of the junetion at the Flores-La Libertad road.</page><page sequence="2">rectangular frame. Recently, somebody has scratched over the painting using a pointed instrument, but no severe damage has ocurred. Grube observed that the glyph shows a highly styl ized version of the sign T819, a human eye representing the word il "to see, to witness, visit". The scrolls in front of the main sign are a standard component of the sign also carved in stone inscriptions. The same glyph is very common in the painted texts of the cave of Naj Tunich in the Peten of Guatemala and has been interpreted by Barbara MacLeod and Andrea Stone as a reference to the various visits to the cave, where the visitors may have witnessed sacred Underworld rituals. Grube was told by Eduardo Cuc and Don Benjamín, that a figure was painted on one of the stones to the left of the block with the glyph. If this painted figure really existed, it must have been destroyed before the cave was inspected by Quintana, Wurster, Grube, and Mayer. In one of the halls in the northeastern section of the Cueva de Galón, on a vertical rock surface facing east, there is a large painted hieroglyphic text, designated as Mural 2 (Fig. 2). Fig. 1.
