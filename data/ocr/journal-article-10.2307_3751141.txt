<plain_text><page sequence="1">Freedom and Human Nature ANTONY FLEW Our hope that freedom is not going to be ultimately destroyed by the joint pressure of totalitarianism and the general bureaucratization of the world, and indeed our very readiness to defend it, depends crucially on our belief that the desire for freedom ... is not an accidental fancy of history, nor a result of peculiar social conditions or a temporary by-product of specific economic life forms . . . but that it is rooted in the very quality of being human. -Leszek Kolakowski (Sometime Professor of Philosophy in the University of Warsaw) The present paper is an attempt to show that Kolakowski's contention is fundamentally correct. But Part I begins by distinguishing, as here he does not, two very different senses of 'freedom'. In one freedom is a possible but not a necessary condition and objective of human activity: it is a condition which may or may not obtain on particular occasions; and an objective which particular people may or may not choose to pursue. In the other freedom is indeed inescapably 'rooted in the very quality of being human'. So the remainder of Part I is devoted to the elucidation of this second sense, and to showing that any study of human behaviour which is to deserve the diploma description 'science' must start by recognizing rather than denying this definitive fact of our nature. It is argued that no one would be able even to understand such a denial unless they were equipped with premises sufficient for a demon- stration of its falsity. Part II goes on to make an example of a widely read work by a leading behavioural scientist. The author starts by insisting, contrary to the contentions of Part I, that any true science of human psychology must presuppose the truth of that denial. He then proceeds to make it clear that, in consequence, he himself places no value upon freedom in the first sense. I (1) The first and crucial distinction is: between, on the one hand, political freedom or political liberty; and, on the other hand, what is customarily but misleadingly called freewill or the freedom of the will. In the first of these two understandings people are correctly said to be free or at liberty in as much as, and in so far as, they are neither confined as prisoners nor constrained by formidable threats. Philosophy 66 1991 53</page><page sequence="2">Antony Flew Certainly it would be the diametric opposite of the truth to say of anyone who is 'a prisoner and in chains'1 that he or she is free and at liberty. But it would also be false to say of people who are not in any way prisoners, much less in chains, that they are free or at liberty to do particular things either when the doing of those particular things is legally forbidden or when it is reasonably feared that their doings would incur serious penalties imposed either non-legally or even legally. It is because those who are not prisoners or in chains may still be in many respects unfree, and because too almost everyone is free in at least some respects although in at least some others not free, that it becomes best usually to speak of liberties or of freedoms in the plural, and to begin pedantically to particularize whenever clouds of confusion loom. When it is claimed that God gave freewill to those of His creatures who are made in His own image, and that in consequence we are free agents, or when in a secularized idiom it is said that freedom 'is rooted in the very quality of being human', then the words 'free' and 'freewill' are being used in the second and more fundamental of the two under- standings which we are now distinguishing. The intended reference is to the familiar fact that, always throughout our waking lives, we are all of us agents; although the scope of that agency varies not only from individual to individual but also in one and the same individual from time to time-whether in sickness or in health, whether in maturity or in senility. Necessarily, as agents, we can and cannot but make choices. Equally necessarily as agents, in a sense shortly to be elucidated, we always could do or could have done other than we do do or did do. What makes the use of the words 'free' or 'freewill' misleading here is the logical fact that all agency is not, as such and necessarily, free agency. For the man who receives from The Godfather 'an offer which he cannnot refuse' is in a crucially different case from the errant mafioso who is without warning gunned down from behind. As the latter collapses into a pool of his own blood he simultaneously ceases both to live and to act; in that very collapse he is no longer an agent at all but purely a patient. Cdntrast the unfortunate who is told that within thirty seconds either his signature or his brains will be on the document surrendering his property. Although in this transaction far from a free agent, nevertheless he remains throughout an agent still. He remains throughout an agent still because, although the signing is most certainly not done of his own freewill, nevertheless-in the more fundamental senses still to be elucidated-he did have a choice and he could have done other than he did. Certainly, in the less fundamental but more common senses of these expressions, we do say that people 1 D. Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, P. H. Nidditch (ed.) (Oxford: Clarendon, 1975), 95. 54</page><page sequence="3">Freedom and Human Nature really had no choice or that they surely could not have done other than they did when it is our belief that, although in those more fundamental senses they did or they could, nevertheless there were in fact no alternative courses of action open to them which they could reasonably have been expected to adopt-in either the descriptive or the prescrip- tive interpretations of 'expect'.2 These correct and idiomatic usages, like the philosophical abuses of the terms 'free' and 'freewill', are seriously misleading. For they draw our attention away from the essen- tials of agency. (2) The better to appreciate what these essentials are, we need now to refresh our memories of Locke's great chapter 'Of Power'.3 It is as certain as without direct testimonial evidence this sort of thing can be that Hume had this chapter most in mind, perhaps even open before him, when in both the Treatise and the first Enquiry he composed his enormously yet not always happily influential sections 'Of the Idea of Necessary Connexion' and 'Of Liberty and Necessity'.4 From a critical re-examination of this seminal chapter in Locke's Essay we can obtain two vitally important trophies. First, that study should be sufficient to show us that we all have the most direct and the most inexpugnably certain experience: not only of both physical (as opposed to logical) necessity and physical (as opposed to logical) impossibility; but also of both being able to do other than we do do and of being unable to behave in any other way than that in which we are behaving. Second, once we are seized of these insights, we should be ready to recognize that there is no way in which creatures neither enjoying nor suffering experiences of both these two contrasting kinds could either acquire for themselves, or explicate to others, any of the corresponding notions. If this is right, then no one could be in a position to assert that the entire Universe is subject to the same universal and inexorable physical necessitation without at the same time being in a position to know that any such assertion cannot but be false. If the very ideas both of physical necessity, and of the ability to do other than we do do, both are, and can only be, acquired by reference to our abundant experience of the two contrasting kinds of reality to which these ideas refer; then who but the most bigoted and the most dogmatic necessitarian ideo- 2 A.

Anyone inclined to doubt either the first or especially the second of these two promised findings should be challenged to excogitate their own explications of all the various notions in the kinds distinguished- including the intellectually indispensable concept, not so far explicitly mentioned, of the contrary-to-fact (conditional). In their attempts to meet this challenge without any reference to our abundant experience of phenomena of the two contrasting kinds, as they are required to do, these dissidents should be discouraged with the reminder that it was his failure to locate suitable parent 'impressions'-'experiences' as later empiricists would say-which led Hume himself to deny the legitimacy of either of the two corresponding sorts of 'ideas'. (Parenthetically: Hume's failure here resulted, surely, from his misguided Cartesian insistence upon thinking of himself as an incorporeal pure observer; rather than as the flesh and blood observer-cum-agent which he was, and all of us are?5) (3) In his chapter 'Of Power' Locke was solely concerned with the sort of power which can be predicated only of people-or of such other putative, quasi-personal beings as the theist God, the Olympian gods, angels, devils, and assorted disembodied or permanently bodiless spir- its. Let us, therefore, attach to this prime kind of power the label 'power (personal)'. In another sense, which is the only sense in which the word can be applied to inanimate objects and to most of animate nature, a power simply is a disposition to behave in such and such a way, given that such and such preconditions are satisfied. Thus we might say that the nuclear device dropped at Nagasaki possessed an explosive power equivalent to that of so many tons of TNT, or that full-weight nylon climbing rope has a breaking strain of (a power to hold up to) 4,500 pounds. Let us label this secondary sort of power 'power (physical)'. A power (personal) is an ability at will either to do or to abstain from doing whatever it may be. Thus we might say that in his heyday J.V. Stalin had the power of life and death over every subject of the Soviet Empire, or that a fertile pair of people of opposite sexes have the power to start a baby. Locke in three characteristically vivid passages not only explicates both this idea and the contrasting concepts of physical neces- sity and physical impossibility but also demonstrates that there can be no question but that all these ideas have abundant application. It is regrettable that in the third of the passages following Locke mistakes it that he is explaining what is meant not by'an agent' but by'a free agent': 5 Compare Flew, 1986, Ch. 6 and Flew, The Logic of Mortality (Oxford: Blackwell, 1987), passim. 56</page><page sequence="5">Freedom and Human Nature This is least I think evident, that we find in ourselves a Power to begin or forbear, continue or end several actions of our minds, and motions of our Bodies . .. This Power . .. thus to order the consid- eration of any idea, or the forbearing to consider it; or to prefer the motion of any part of the body to its rest, and vice versa in any particular instance, is that which we call the Will.6 Every one, I think, finds in himself a Power to begin or forbear, continue or put an end to several Actions in himself. From the considerations of the extent of this power of the mind over the actions of the Man, which everyone finds in himself, arise the Ideas of Liberty and Necessity.7 We have instances enough, and often more than enough in our own bodies. A Man's Heart beats, and the Blood circulates, which 'tis not in his Power . . . to stop; and therefore in respect of these Motions, where rest depends not on his choice . . . he is not a free agent.

For even 'Not to choose is, in fact, to choose not to choose'.9 Much earlier-indeed earlier by all of a quarter of a millennium-that Existentialist conclusion had been anti- cipated, and the argument which sustains it had been spelt out, in that same classic chapter 'Of Power': For it is unavoidably necessary to prefer the doing or forbearance, of an Action in a Man's power ... a Man must necessarily will the one, or the other, of them; upon which preference, or volition, the action, or its fobearance, certainly follows, and is truly voluntary: But the act of volition, or preferring one of the two, being that which he cannot avoid, a Man, in respect of that act of willing, is under a necessity... 10 6 Locke, Essay, II (xxi) 5,236. 7 Ibid., II (xxi) 7,237. 8 Ibid., II (xxi) 11, 239: the Latin means'St. Vitus' dance'. 9 J-P.

Its centrepiece was an attack on the notion of 'autonomous man'. This, Professor B.F. Skinner argued, notwithstanding that it is presupposed by all traditional ideas of choice, responsibility and human dignity, can have no place in a truly scientific psychology. So any reference to any of these antique and supposedly outdated ideas must be unscientific. His most catastrophic misguiding principle is that, to be authentic- ally scientific, any study of man must eschew all anthropomorphic notions. The explicit and authoritative statement of this grotesque assumption is possibly more important than anything else in the entire book. For Skinner is saying outright what others more cautious leave implicit. He begins: 'We have used the instruments of science; we have counted and measured and compared; but something essential to scien- tific practice is missing in almost all current discussions of human behaviour'.11 It appears that what is missing is, awkwardly, the absence of certain notions which Skinner insists can have no place in any truly scientific discourse. For, he continues: Although physics soon stopped personifying things ... it continued for a long time to speak as if they had wills, impulses, feelings, purposes and other fragmentary attributes of an indwelling agent . . .All this was eventually abandoned, and to good effect. Nevertheless, and deplorably, what should be 'the behavioural sciences still appeal to comparable internal states . . . '2 We are, therefore, required to regret that: Almost everyone who is concerned with human affairs-as political scientist, philosopher, man of letters, economist, psychologist, lin- guist, sociologist, theologian, educator, or psychotherapist-con- tinues to talk about human behaviour in this prescientific way.'3 Certainly such discourse about people is prescientific, in the obvious but purely temporal sense that it was going on long before there was anything which deserved to be called science. Yet Skinner clearly takes it to be not only, innocuously, prescientific, but also, damagingly, unscientific. He takes it that it must be as much a superstitious mistake 11 B. F. Skinner, Beyond Freedom and Dignity (New York: Knopf, 1971), 7. This work was also published in the UK, and later Pelicanned. 12 Ibid., 8. 13 Ibid.,9. 58</page><page sequence="7">Freedom and Human Nature thus to try to explain the actions of an actual person by reference to his will, impulses, feelings, and purposes; as it undoubtedly would be to personify some inanimate object, and then to undertake to explain its movements in the same sort of way. The reason, however, why the latter enterprise would be super- stitious and a mistake is, simply, that inanimate objects are not people or even animals; and hence do not and cannot have wills, impulses, feelings, purposes, or any other such attributes. But the former under- taking is, by the same token, neither superstitious nor a mistake. The actual mistake, which is made by Skinner himself, is to misconstrue the expulsion of such anthropomorphic notions from physics as the repudiation of essentially superstitious ideas, rather than as the rejec- tion of misapplications of ideas which are, in their proper and peculiar area of application, appropriate and indispensable. What is so egregiously and so memorably preposterous is thus to have insisted that the development of any genuine science of man must presuppose the abandonment of all distinctively anthropomorphic notions. (3) Skinner's second misguiding doctrine about the essential nature of science is that 'A scientific analysis shifts both the responsibility and the achievement to the environment'.14 Consequently, in his view, to maintain that anyone ever effected anything is unscientific. Hence certain unnamed Freudians are rebuked for recklessly 'assuring their patients that they are free to choose among different courses of action and are in the long run the architects of their own destinies'.15 For Skinner the true causes of all human behaviour are, and can only be, environmental. (i) One source of this,doctrine is the very understandable feeling that professional psychologists ought to be seeking and finding explanations of conduct which are somehow fuller and deeper than any of those offered and accepted by laypeople as adequate and satisfactory. Thus Skinner writes: 'If we ask someone, "Why did you go to the theatre?", and he says, "Because I felt like going", we are apt to take his reply as a kind of explanation'.'6 Indeed we are. And why not, since it may satisfactorily eliminate some more puzzling alternative previously entertained. What of course such a response will not do is answer the further and deeper questions why I have a taste, and this particular taste, for the theatre? But it is such deeper questions which Skinner wants to press: 'It would be much more to the point to know what has happened when he has gone to the theatre in the past, what he heard or read about the play he went to see, 14 Ibid., 25. 15 Ibid., 20-21. 16 Ibid., 12-13. 59</page><page sequence="8">Antony Flew and what other things in his past or present environments induced him to go . . .17 (ii) The other and much more important source of this second doctrine is that Skinner sees any alternative as involving the black beast notion of 'autonomous man'. This he believes to be the main basis of the to him equally repugnant concepts of human freedom and dignity: Two features of autonomous man are particularly troublesome. In the traditional view, a person is free. He is autonomous in the sense that his behaviour is uncaused. He can therefore be held responsible for what he does, and justly punished if he offends.18 (4) To come to terms with this contention it is essential to make a far too rarely made distinction between two senses of 'cause'. For there is an absolutely fundamental difference: between, on the one hand, ensuring that some person will act in one particular way by providing them with some strong incentive so to do; and, on the other hand, making some purely physical phenomenon happen by bringing about causally sufficient conditions for its occurrence. That absolutely funda- mental difference is that, whereas sufficient (physical) causes neces- sarily necessitate their effects, correspondingly sufficient causes of the other (moral) sort do not. If, for instance, I convey to you some splendid news-news which, if you decided to celebrate, you and everyone else would point to as the cause of (your reason for) initiating that celebration-then I do not by so doing ensure that you must, willy- nilly, make whoopee. But if, by contrast, I press down the plunger of a detonator, then this (physical) cause makes it (physically) impossible for the consequent (physical as opposed to psychological) explosion not to occur. (i) Now, applying this distinction to Skinner's statements about 'autonomous man', we have to say that, whenever someone's behaviour constitutes the action or actions of an agent, then that behaviour necessarily cannot have been (physically) caused. It cannot have been thus causally necessitated, because whatever we do as agents we neces- sarily could have refrained from doing. From the fact that such agent behaviour cannot have been (physically) caused, on the other hand, we cannot deduce: either that it must have been (morally) uncaused; or that questions of responsibility cannot appropriately be raised. If, for instance, some person (or set of persons) 'necklaces' another person then presumably he does (or they do) this because they want to make that other person suffer abominably for his abominated dissidence. That (scarcely moral) desire is the (moral) cause of his (or their) action 17 Ibid., 13. 18 Ibid., 19. 60</page><page sequence="9">Freedom and Human Nature (or actions), and that action (or those actions) must be the (physically) uncaused (physical) causes of the victim's sufferings. (ii) Given that first, fundamental distinction between two senses of 'cause'-a distinction as essential to as it is regularly neglected in the philosophy of the social sciences'9-it at once becomes clear that we need also a parallel distinction between two corresponding senses of 'determinism': the one implying physical necessitation; and the other not. Events which are determined in a sense of this second sort may be in principle or even in practice predictable without being on that account physically necessitated. For instance: all of us who are acquainted with Jack and Jill may be in a position to know both that they will marry and what the (moral) causes of this joint action will be. In refusing to admit the necessity of physical causes, and by giving similarly denecessitated accounts of laws of nature, Hume and sub- sequent Compatibilists-of whom, I confess, I used for many years myself to be one-have scored too easy triumphs. Hume's own 'recon- ciling project' goes through only and precisely because his proud new conception of necessity is not a conception of necessity at all; but, instead, of mere regularity. The same is true of Hume's modern fol- lowers. Thus one famous Compatibilist essay would reduce nomo- logicals to a sort of statements of simple succession and constant conjunction: 'But, I repeat, the fact is simply that when an event of one type occurs, an event of another type occurs also, in a certain temporal or spatio-temporal relation to the first. The rest is only metaphor'.20 (5) So far we have attended only to what Skinner takes to be the presuppositions of a science of psychology. But his main concern both in Beyond Freedom and Dignity and in his earlier utopian novel Wal- den Two is with the application of that science; which nowadays he writes as if we already have-or, at any rate, as if he already has. Thus Beyond Freedom and Dignity begins with a review of 'the terrifying problems that face us in the world today'. It then proceeds to argue that to solve these 'we need to make vast changes in human behaviour'; so that 'what we need is a technology of behaviour'. He eventually con- cludes, 'A scientific view of man offers exciting possibilities. We have not yet seen what man can make of man'.21 We should recognize, what is not perhaps immediately obvious from this latest statement, that Skinner's programme is both elitist and authoritarian; although it is among such programmes in our time 19 Contrast Flew, Thinking about Social Thinking (Oxford: Blackwell, 1985). 20 A. J. Ayer, 'Freedom and Necessity' in his Philosophical Essays (London: Macmillan, 1954), 283. 21 Skinner, op. cit., 3, 4, 5 and 215. 61</page><page sequence="10">Antony Flew unusual in owing nothing to Lenin. The crux is to appreciate that the words 'we' and 'man', upon which so much depends, are not always used to refer to exactly the same collections of individuals. Earlier in Chapter XXXI of Walden Two, Skinner's mouthpiece Frazier had made exactly this point, with characteristic frankness: 'When we ask what Man can make of Man, we don't mean the same thing by "Man" in both instances. We mean to ask what a few men can make of mankind. And that's the all-absorbing question of the twentieth century. What kind of world can we build-those of us who understand the science of behaviour?' (i) Any democratic or liberal inhibitions against the implementation of so authoritarian a programme-inhibitions which may have been introjected by his environment in the USA-Skinner succeeds in dis- sipating by collapsing all the crucial distinctions. Thus he refuses to recognize any relevant difference between a set-up in which abortion is illegal and one in which it is not. In the latter case: 'The individual is "permitted" to decide the issue for himself [sic!], simply in the sense that he [sic!] will act because of the consequences to which legal punishment is no longer to be added'.22 Well yes, I suppose, precisely in that sense; and exactly that is what it is all about. Skinner has already shown the same doctrinally determined scotoma with regard to the difference between having or not having criminal laws forbidding people to 'gamble, drink, or go to prostitutes'.23 (ii) Again, Skinner considers 'the practice of inviting prisoners to volunteer for possibly dangerous experiments-for example, on new drugs-in return for better living conditions or shorter sentences'. He asks, rhetorically, 'but are they really free when positively re- inforced .. .?'24 Since positive reinforcement is precisely and only his peculiar way of referring to the offer of the promised rewards, the correct answer is, clearly, 'Yes'. The contrast is, for instance, with those prisoners in Belsen and Dachau who were made subjects for medical experimentation willy-nilly. (iii) Then again Skinner asserts: 'A person never becomes truly self- reliant. Even though he deals effectively with things, he is necessarily dependent upon those who have taught him to do so'.25 But what self- reliance actually excludes is helplessness, not having been educated to be self-reliant. (It is disturbing to reflect that a great many of those employed to teach and practice educational psychology in the USA belong to Skinner's strange, blinkered, illiberal, Harvard school.) 22 Ibid., 97. 23 Ibid., 91. 24 Ibid., 39. 25 Ibid.,91. 62</page><page sequence="11">Freedom and Human Nature (iv) Yet again, Skinner refuses to allow any important difference: between, on the one hand, the uncoercive giving of evidencing reasons26 and, on the other hand, other and more forcible methods of mind- bending. "'Brain-washing" is proscribed by those who otherwise con- done the changing of minds, simply because the control is obvious'.7 But the issue does not concern what is overt and what is covert. It is, rather, a matter of giving or not giving what are, or are thought to be, good evidencing as opposed to motivating reasons; and the receiving and considering of reasons can scarcely proceed without at least the receiver being aware of what is going on. (v) Politically libertarian hopes rise a little when we read: 'Permissive practices have many advantages'. Such hopes are soon dashed: 'Per- missiveness is not, however, a policy; it is the abandonment of policy, and its apparent advantages are illusory. To refuse to control is to leave control not to the person himself, but to other parts of the social and non-social environments'.28 This is on two counts obnoxious. First, Skinner's contention that leaving control to the person himself is an illusion is supported simply by his insistence that the true causes of human behaviour are, and can only be, environmental; which, as we have seen, in turn depends upon the refusal to admit the distinction between (physical) causes, which necessitate the occurrence of their effects, and (moral) causes, which do not. Second, even if I have got to be controlled either by a person or by impersonal forces, still the difference between these alternatives mat- ters enormously. If, for instance, I suffer something painful I am much less upset if I believe this to be the result of blind forces than if I believe it to be someone's intention to do this to me. (This is one reason why a moment's thought makes the ideal of a totally planned society so repellent to all but those who see themselves as the total planners; and, correspondingly, so endlessly enchanting to actual or aspiring members of such self-appointed power elites.)
