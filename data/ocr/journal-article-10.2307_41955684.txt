<plain_text><page sequence="1">A SOURCE FOR DIEGO RIVERA'S HANDS OF DOCTOR MOORE AT THE SAN DIEGO MUSEUM OF ART Ariel Plotek Diego Rivera's Hands of Doctor Moore (Fig. 1) entered the collection of the San Diego Museum of Art by bequest in 1970.1 One of approximately ten portraits executed by the artist in 1940, The Hands of Doctor Moore is among Rivera's most thoroughly documented private commissions. Along- side correspondence relating to the sitter and his wife's visit to Mexico, the museum pos- sesses photographs of Doctor Clarence Moore posing for Rivera in the artist's studio in Coyoacán, as well as the canceled check with which the painting was purchased. Nevertheless, the origin of the work's un- usual iconography has never been ade- quately explained. The influence of the artist's wife, Frida Kahlo, may account for the painted scroll at the bottom of the picture, reminiscent of a Mexican retablo. This inscription serves to explain the work's symbolic program: the surgeon's hands, we are informed, trim an anthropomorphic tree of life. The uncanny female figure of the tree can be likened, in turn, to elements of Kahlo's personal iconography.2 Rivera had shown a preference for promi- nent hands before, as in his 1938 portrait of Lupe Marin (Museo de Arte Moderno, Mex- ico City). More relevant still, a pair of hands representing Surgery had appeared in Rivera's 1933 mural commission Detroit In- dustry, on the south wall of the Detroit Insti- tute of Arts (Fig. 2). These hands hover supernaturally in an upper register. The hands of the surgeon, it seems, have supplanted those of God. In marked contrast to this, in The Hands of Doctor Moore the artist explic- itly identifies his flesh and blood model. A probable source not previously consid- ered in discussions of Rivera's widely pub- lished picture was suggested by the recent loan of Francisco de Goya's Self-Portrait with Doctor Arrieta (Fig. 3) to San Diego's Timken Museum of Art. In terms of subject and symbolism, the two works present strik- ing similarities. The hands in the foreground of the paint- ing by Goya belong not to the attending physician, but to the artist himself. Never- theless, The Hands of Doctor Moore may be viewed as a literal transcription of this detail, so alike are the hands that grip the surgeon's tools in the painting by Rivera and those in the lap of the ailing artist in the Self-Portrait with Doctor Arrieta. That the Goya - a gift of gratitude from the artist to his doctor - may have inspired Rivera's Hands of Doctor Moore is supported also by Goya's inscrip- tion in the manner of an ex-voto. In the bot- tom register of the double-portrait, we read: Goya, in gratitude to his friend Arrieta: for the compassion and care with which he saved his life during the acute and danger- ous illness he suffered toward the end of the year 1819, in his seventy-third year. He painted it in 1820.3 As if echoing the words of the Spanish mas- ter, whose art he had studied closely in</page><page sequence="2">33 Fig. 1 Diego Rivera, The Hands of Doctor Moore. 1940.

NOTES 1 . A bequest of Mrs. E. Clarence Moore, the paint- ing was given to the Fine Arts Gallery of San Diego (now the San Diego Museum of Art) together with archival materials pertaining to the commission. 2. Rivera was particularly inclined in this period to recognize anthropomorphic forms in plants and their roots, as in his Symbolic Landscape of 1940 (San Francisco Museum of Modern Art) and his Temptation of Saint Anthony of 1947 (Museo Nacional de Arte, Mexico City). 3.

From the collection of Dr. Eugenio Garcia Arri- eta, the painting had passed by 1860 to J. J. Martinez Espinosa, also of Madrid. It is recorded next with M. A. de Ajuria Temple, of Paris and Mexico, and by 1910 with Doctor Edwards-Lucas-Moreno. 6. The painting was first published and illustrated in the journal Los Sucesos (23 May 1867) in connec- tion with the exhibition at the Academia de San Fer- nando in Madrid.</page></plain_text>
