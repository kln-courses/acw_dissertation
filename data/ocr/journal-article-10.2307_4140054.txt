<plain_text><page sequence="1">PERFORMANCE AND SCIENCE Johannes Birringer CYBERNETICS AND RHYTHMS y the end of the last century, it was apparent that the impact of media and digital technologies on the performing and fine arts proffered some of the irreversible evolutions Nam June Paik, who died earlier this year, had already anticipated in the 1960s. As Paik envisioned the electronic superhighway and, for example in Global Groove (1973), pioneered many of the techniques of morphing and collaging moving images which are the common language of digital multimedia today, he not only helped to engineer new tools, such as the Paik-Abe Synthesizer, but insistently probed the instrumentalities and properties of a medium. Magnet TV strikes us today as a microscopic scan of the cathode ray, exposing the interior flesh and the arteries of electric energy. In the exhibition "Cybernetics Art and Music" at the New School for Social Research (1965), Paik's experiments with electronic signals and feedbacks anticipated the infra-sound and image manipulations so pertinent to the digital culture of the re-mix described in Paul D. Miller's (DJ Spooky) audio recordings and his recent book, Rhythm Science. What's surprising about DJ Spooky's tracks is that they mix music with early modernist writers or Dada artists (James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Kurt Schwitters), and his recent video installation ReBirth ofa Nation provocatively combines D.W. Griffith with other "found objects" from history. The "science" he thinks of is a methodology of cultural engineering on an aesthetic level of sampling and re-recording poignant enough to crystallize dialectical images, constructive moments of re-cognition, in the manner in which Walter Benjamin thought of modern technology's complex reorganization of the visual. Though less fraught with the ethical quandaries encountered in the debates on genetic engineering, nevertheless the "rhythms" in question are deeply connected to inquiries into cultural knowledge and cognition, and the DJ's "science" is a filtering of sounds, beats, movements and torsions amidst a raving biopolitics of information-processing systems. DJ Spooky works with the mobile, performative aura of tracks and iPods, channeling the listener's rage against the machine. My concern here is not with styles of re-mixing and recombination as a phenomenon of the digital media or a superficial reflection of science in art (sci-art), but with 22 0 PAJ 85 (2007), pp. 22-35. @ 2007 Johannes Birringer.</page><page sequence="2">the underlying history of the interrelations between performance and computer science/engineering. Cybernetics offered explanations of phenomena in terms of information flows and feedback loops in mechanical and biological systems. Its influence on composition and the aesthetic concern with the regulation of a system (homeostasis) has expanded, while computer models of information processing and artificial intelligence merged with experimental studies in physics, molecular biol- ogy, and neuroscience. This raises questions about the arts as partners in scientific research, engineering and tool invention. It also invites us to ponder the kinds of work processes necessary for sustained laboratory experiments that can yield new art works, new inventions, and new knowledge. Rather than looking at a theatrical play (e.g., Michael Frayn's Copenhagen) or choreography (Rambert Dance Company's Constant Speed) thematizing modern mathematics or evoking a scientific hypothesis through a particular abstract compo- sitional aesthetic (e.g., Robert Wilson/Philip Glass's Einstein on the Beach), I want to ask how performance might use an instrument of analysis or generate a conceptual system to analyze the organization and structure of the system, its metabolism and its boundary. Regarding dance, for example, it is indicative that choreographers like Alejandro Ahmed (director of the Brazilian company Cena 11) speak of research into "behaviors" and modes of adaptation. Rather than inventing movement phrases, his work deeply probes physical conditions for the re-organization of the body, for example in the company's extensive work on patterns of falling (involving gravity, weight, muscular strength, pressure, etc.), and specific instances in which changes emerge in states of stillness and movement. Addressing this research at the 2006 IN TRANSIT laboratory in Berlin, Fabiana Britto used analogies with quantum theory to emphasize the dancers' attention to probabilities of interconnections between the patterns. THEATRE AND ENGINEERING Today, with interdisciplinary research widely established at universities in many parts of the world, professional training at theatre, dance, music and art schools does not always acknowledge the significance of modern science for the arts, but at the postgraduate level one at least finds crossovers supporting the mutual implication of artistic and scientific thinking. In the experimental era of the1960s, we can also locate an interesting precursor to current art and technology courses in the academy or to the many hybrid performances and installations created by artists in all media. Robert Rauschenberg and Billy Kliiver, a Bell Telephone Laboratories engineer who had developed friendships with artists working in New York, organized meetings for artists and engineers to devise large-scale collaborative performance works. Their 9 Evenings: Theater andEngineering, held at New York City's 69th Regiment Armory in 1966 and involving many of the Judson Dance Theater artists, including Yvonne Rainer, Steve Paxton, Deborah and Alex Hay, and Lucinda Childs, as well as John Cage, David Tudor and Robert Rauschenberg, was not entirely recognized at the time for the daring co-laboratory it founded. The 9 Evenings event initiated the establishment of Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.), directed by Kliiver BIRRINGER / Performance and Science U 23</page><page sequence="3">as an organization to help research collaborations between scientists and artists. It was a superb model which we can look to both as a reference point for past new directions in the arts and for others still to evolve.' HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERFACES Let's examine a few contemporary areas where scientific observation and experi- mentation overlap with performance to the extent that they take varying bodies, living beings or physiological/cognitive processes as the medium of inquiry. In the UK, for example, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council supports PLAN (Pervasive and Locative Arts Network-Enhancing Mobile and Wireless Technologies for Culture and Creativity), a network of computer scientists and artists interested in developing mobile and interactive media that are directly embedded into the world around performers or "creative users." Performance groups such as Blast Theory, Igloo, or Active Ingredient have explored the boundaries of perva- sive media using innovative locative games played on mobile phones in outdoor locations or deploying avatars in redesigned computer game worlds. Scripts, the textual term we once used in the theatre for written dialogue and stage directions, here become programming code, and neural networks the metaphor for algorithms which define the functional behaviors, actes sans paroles, of the actors involved in such transductive telecommunicational scenarios. In many cases these functional behaviors have to do with motion/gesture. When Steve Benford, director of Mixed Reality Lab and scientist-collaborator on Blast Theory's roaming urban performances, speaks of system input and expressive latitude, he is referring to design strategies for Human-Computer Interfaces (HCI). He classifies "public interfaces" according to the extent to which movements and gestures, i.e., a performer's manipulations of an interface and their resulting effects, are hidden, partially revealed, fully revealed, or even amplified for spectators. Such taxonomies of a design interaction system, which tend to apply to perfor- mances in everyday life, also have implications for artistic design decision and the iterative stages of prototyping now increasingly prevalent in interactive art processes that involve wearable computing (e.g., sensors or conductive fibers in intelligent garment design), biofeedback, and the programming or orchestration of responsive environments.2 Computer scientists borrow the musical term "orchestration" from Brenda Laurel's writings, Computers as Theatre (1993), an earlier attempt at explaining interactive experiences in terms of the methods in which actors and technical crew monitor and intervene in ongoing interactions in order to subtly shape an unfolding experience. In regard to museums and the digital curating of new media artworks, such orchestration can also involve participatory strategies designed to manage visitor flow or interactive behavior of the spectators. The museum, in this case, is analyzed as a system ofvisitability, attention management, flow, etc. But this is also a response to changes in art production itself. A conference at the Tate Modern last year focused on immaterial systems and raised the issue of how curating could respond to new forms of self-organizing and self-replicating systems, databases, programming, net art, software art, and generative media. If the language of the debates echoed systems 24 U PAJ 85</page><page sequence="4">bd ""' .. ~es~ `~~ ~. \T i --- ?

The scientific approach, I suggest, was owed to the recognition that the idea of the "system" is crucial in this context in that it not only refers to the physical site of curatorial production, the computer and the network, but also to the technical and conceptual properties of what constitutes the curatorial object and the "operating system" of art. What new models of curatorial practice are required to take account of shared, distributed, and collaborative objects and processes? DANCE GESTURES, REAL-TIME CAPTURE, ANIMATION Another significant change we see today in interaction design for artistic perfor- mance is the care given to the subtleties and nuances of gestural quality. Troika Ranch, the New York-based dance company, recently performed their new piece 16 (R)evolutions almost as an allegory of this development of gestural control and refinement of motion tracking within the programming environment they have cre- ated (combining tracking camera, their own custom-built Isadora software, infrared lighting). Rather than deploying a high-end multi-camera motion capture system for real-time graphic animation, as it was used initially in Trisha Brown's how long does the subject linger on the edge of the volume ... (2005), Troika Ranch designed a small inexpensive system that can easily travel, combining Isadora with a motion capture software (Eyesweb) created by Italian scientists at the Genoa Laboratorio di Informatica Musicale. It allows a particular gesture analysis here used for the trans- formation of points in space, contours, lines, and motion energy or direction into animated graphics. It is tempting to call this a process of translation. The dancer onstage moves and activates the graphic shapes and their relations in projected timespace, which is also a computational environment: the movement-action directly results in media images. The points in space, recognized each second almost as in Etienne-Jules Marey's or Eadweard Muybridge's chronophotography a hundred years ago, are here transformed instantly in real time. They generate a trail of successive movements in fluid continuity to form a Gestalt. At this historical point in the development of motion tracking, animation, real-time motion capture/rendering, the interactivity is no longer focused on direct mapping of gesture (gesture to sound, gesture to video), or understanding the dancer as a musical instrument, but on the creation of complex "action paintings," calligraphies of human gesture translated into image-flows. (In the late 1990s, we saw the begin- nings of such work in Merce Cunningham's and Bill T. Jones's collaboration with Paul Kaiser/Shelley Eshkar, and Biped and Ghostcatching were milestones on this research path; interestingly Eshkar and Kaiser have now become more interested in simple, pedestrian movement!) Mathematically, the procedure remains identical: Isadora (and its movie-input camera) tracks motion and analyzes the bodily data. The software functions as a measuring tool or tool of observation. Depending on the values, filters, and modifiers assigned to the data, the program analyzes slight changes in the motion gesture-observing the "living state" or properties of such movement (four categories: straight, curved, lateral, complex). Recognizing change of direction, speed, dynamics and velocity of movement within these categories, 26 U PAJ 85</page><page sequence="6">the program then renders the media output in real time, and we can perceive the three-dimensional dance and the projected 3-D worlds of colors and shapes. Again using a musical analogy here, one could argue that the software program observes "tonal" qualities of the dancer's movement.3 Another level of critical analysis would then have to be applied to the particular choices the artist-designers make for the visualization of the data. Numerous researchers in the hard sciences, including molecular biologists working on cellular dynamics and chemical transformations, are currently preoccupied with visualization technologies, and here an exchange of knowledge between fields of observation appears relevant, even if the aesthetic or political questions about the meaning and affect of gestures may address different concerns from those of the cell biologist. Perhaps it is worth dwelling a bit more on our procedures, on the ways in which we construct categories for observation. The computer, for example, cannot "feel" the gesture in the way in which the human audience will sense the weight or import of a particular movement behavior and movement quality of expression. Mark Coniglio, who wrote the Isadora software, admits that he wouldn't know himself where a gesture begins and ends. The software reacts to properties of the motion and is set to modify the Gestalt of the image we see projected continuously (color changes, change in size, rotation of planes to effect a more three-dimensional and topsy-turvy feeling of the images). The images themselves can have various tactile characteristics connected to the "gestural-ness" of drawing and painting (sinewy) or the more architectural look of geometric, polygonal shapes. In one scene of 16 (R)evolutions, a meshwork of lines (vertical and horizontal) appears all over the floor and back projection which is pulsating and constantly moving/growing/decreasing/turning/evolving (rendered here through particle systems programming). In another, a meshwork of more densified criss-crossed lines and architectural Gestalts gain polyphonic complexity in motion, and in rotations that defy Euclidian space. Choreographer Dawn Stop- piello suggests that such current explorations in motion tracking and visualization emphasize highly subtle manipulations of visual and aural qualities, correlated to new concepts of dynamic systems or semi-chaotic systems whose philosophical and scientific thought-models are derived from research in biology, a-life, computer sci- ence and the cognitive sciences (Maturana/Varela, Prigogine/Stengers, Kauffman, Iberall, and others). No longer based on notational systems (Labanotation) but on computational analysis and mathematics, "description of movement" is rendered as image-movement, yet the fuzzy logic in the chaotic state of the system reminds us how difficult it is to speak of a digital aesthetics. The digital medium itself is indif- ferent to movement poetics or authorship. ROBOTICS AND TISSUE CULTURES Interaction designers, in other words, now reflect on what could be called the psy- chology of spontaneous, intuitive, unpredictable or ritualized behavior in "traversable interfaces" which allow fluid transitions between spectating and performing. The difference from earlier studies of role play by social anthropologists (Victor Turner, BIRRINGER / Performance and Science m 27</page><page sequence="7">Erving Goffman) lies in the fact that performance is here always understood to take place in relationship to system-design which often encloses performer and interface within a physically traversable projected display or immersive environment. In the case of performers such as Stelarc or Marcel.li. Antfinez Roca who work with robot- ics, the language of object manipulation (actuators) also enters the scene, creating a fascinating and complex re-orientation of our anthropomorphic assumptions about performance and agency. When the performer is tethered to the interface, as it has been the case in numerous performances by Stelarc (e.g., Fractal Flesh, 1995-98, or more recently, Exoskeleton, a pneumatically powered 6-legged walking machine actuated by arm gestures), the effects of an interface act directly upon the performer. In extreme cases the system is actively and perhaps autonomously controlling the performer's body. In Fractal Flesh, Stelarc and his engineering partners developed a touch-screen interfaced Muscle Stimulation System, enabling remote access, actuation and choreography of the body through a series of electrical impulses, triggered by spectators. In Requiem, Antuinez hangs in an exo-skeleton that is capable of executing most of the movements of the human body. The robotic engine reacts to spectators by optical sensors which activate the machine and registers the random movements. In performance, Antunez becomes a dancer whose movements are imposed by the spectators. Research in robotic performance has found fascinating manifestations in such works and others by Louis-Philippe Demers, Bill Vorn, Simon Penny, Eduardo Kac, etc., and the engi- neering focus on the nature of the robot's behavior (autonomous, semi-autonomous, responsive, interactive, organic, adaptable, telepresent, etc.) again points to qualities of a work residing in the manner in which machinic embodiment is capable of specific responses to differing stimuli in the environment. Collaborations between Louis-Philippe Demers's robots and dancers have yielded two remarkable new works recently, Devolution (Australian Dance Theatre) and kubic's cube (Ventura Dance Company), the latter more radical as the robot is the only mover in the interactive choreography. The London-based Arts Catalyst organization, fulfilling a similar role as E.A.T's in advocating research that connects the arts and sciences, has been particularly interested in aspects of such machinic embodiment which illuminate and critique the manipulation of living systems from an informed practical perspective. Such components of their recent Biotech Art and Wetware workshops (featuring, for example, Portuguese bioartist Marta de Menezes and the Australian bio-researchers Oron Catts and Ionat Zurr of SymbioticA) included DNA extraction and finger- printing, genetic engineering, selective breeding, plant and animal tissue culture, and basic tissue engineering techniques. The relevance of the robotic imagination to such bio art practices becomes clearer if we look at how the notion of "living artworks" drives spatial, sculptural, and kinetic experimentation through engineering/software programming on the one hand, and transgenic plants, animals, and tissue cultures through the manipulation of biological organisms on the other. Both strategies cen- ter on bio-technological procedures as a medium of expression, and the trajectory from body art to working with living cells or skin cultures is evident particularly 28 U PAJ 85</page><page sequence="8">in performative exhibitions that establish interrelationships between modifications of bio materials at small levels (cells, proteins, genes) and their economic, political, legal, and philosophical framework conditions. While there is growing interest among philosophers (e.g., Giorgio Agamben, Alphonso Lingis) to debate the political and economic definitions of being human/being animal, of life/consumable meat, and thus to call into question the differentiations among species, the notorious "biotech" projects of the CAE (Critical Art Ensemble) have drawn attention to the molecular research of corporations and their genetic modifications of plants and food. CAE, whose member Steve Kurtz was arrested on suspicion of bioterrorism in 2004, refers to their contestational biology as a form of "reverse-engineering" operating at the intersections between the "performativities of science and theatre" (&lt;http://www. critical-art.net&gt;). When the provocative critical elements are foregrounded and even spectacularized, as in Kac's glowing rabbit, SymbioticA's semi-living "Worry-Dolls," or Stelarc's recent effort to use tissue culture to grow a surgically constructed "Extra Ear" as an additional facial feature, the scientific knowledge produced is much less convincing. HABITATS We can conjecture, however, that performance of science here delves into its biomedi- cal tradition: it manufactures or contrives experimental variations on the evolution of the human, testing the limits of the body or what we know of it, rehearsing an unimaginable condition which also can be considered a predictable adaptation once a corporeal and cognitive challenge is posited. How do we move on planet Mars? Scientists at the NASA Haughton-Mars Project on Devon Island in Nunavut (Canada) are testing it (&lt;http://www.marsonearth.org&gt;). Olympus donates the epifluorescence miscroscope for endolithic microbiological analysis. Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Insti- tute provides the "Hyperion" rover for autonomous traversing of the imagined Mars. Coincidentally, the New York-based Builders Association, in their new multimedia production Invisible Cities, collaborate with the developers of Mobile Augmented Reality Systems (MARS) at Columbia University to develop a special interface for the performance, which involves Brooklyn teenagers of color in the creation, design, and development of a game that critically comments on virtual racism. Invisible Cit- ies, the Builders Association's homepage claims, refer to the imaginary cities of the future and of the past, and to cities within cities. MARS, appropriately, combines augmented reality, in which 3-D displays are used to overlay a synthesized world on top of the real world, and mobile computing. Increasingly, small computing devices, linked by wireless networks, are used while roaming the real world, but in the end, we are told, "content from workshops with the teens will be transferred to the MARS software along with texture-mapped models of performance event locations in lower Manhattan." The teenagers won't return to the hood, it seems, but will be biometrically "mapped," and thus undergo the image surveillance and compositing techniques already strikingly employed in Alladeen and SUPER VISION. The Build- ers seek to combine a "modeling software with the MARS interface that would take a photo of the participant and merge averaged ethnic and racial characteristics of a typical NYC native in 2105 with the participant's existing facial features. ihe new BIRRINGER I Performance and Science U 29</page><page sequence="9">composite image will become an avatar representing the participant's game persona" (&lt;http://www.thebuildersassociation.org&gt;). This, admittedly, sounds rather more alienating to me than the fun-loving scientist crew on Devon Island, whose chief physicist Stephen Braham is a space networking specialist as well as a cunning Buster Keaton-like metteur-en-scene of "arctic survival demos." And how would we adapt to living under water? Australian diver/performance artist Sarah Jane Pell will test it next year in a performance at the Roundhouse, London, where she will spend a week submerged in a human-scale aqueous bioreactor con- nected to a satellite of semi-living aquanauts in self-contained mini biospheres. Her project, SUB CULTURE, proposes to test duty of care issues as well as an understanding of such "medium" states or systems ("actual," "symbolic," "symbiotic," and "simulated" and/or "real" systems) by investigating the various relationships between subject/object, inside/outside, host/body, and entity/non-entity through various strategies of cognition and communication applicable across multiple living systems and new media practice. Her exploration activity, partly administered by SymbioticA, will be Webcast live on the Net. BRAIN DANCE How have performances contributed to our knowledge of the mind, of cognitive states? The significance of movement for human development surely was never in doubt. In evolutionary terms, we gathered from Charles Darwin and Stanley Kubrick that dance is as vital for the survival of the species and its expressions in ritual, social, and theatrical contexts as it is for the evolution of the Hollywood film industry. Movie images encapsulate popular stereotypes and icons, revealing the roles of gender, race, fashion, economic and political force. There are movies playing in our minds all the time-images of objects, images of spatial organization, motor processes, memory, body maps, etc. In science fiction we can step into the brain room and switch off the automated technology when it becomes too threatening. In reality, it has proven to be more difficult to grasp how the brain inside the human organism engenders mental patterns-how it moves, in other words. The Cartesian idea of a disembodied mind had an enduring impact on the philo- sophical history of reason in Western culture, on our thinking about thinking and the rational instruments of human behavior. Philosophical, artistic, and religious speculation on the mind have shaped our notions of consciousness, ethics, and the human condition. The neural processes of the brain, which had attracted Professor Hans Berger's curiosity when he invented the EEG (electroencephalography) in a neuropsychiatric clinic in Jena (1929), were not a common subject for the humani- ties and the arts. I first encountered brain waves in a dance workshop at Hellerau in 2000, when a neuroscientist attached electrodes to my head and made an EEG spectral analysis of my brain activity while dancing, using a measuring software that allowed the frequencies to be processed as real-time data for sound generation. To my disappointment, the music of my brain was not as good as I would have liked it to be. Today, such "biofeedback applications" are commercially available-you can buy them on the Internet, and digitally record, store, process, and work with brainwaves 30 U PAJ 85</page><page sequence="10">using a computer to "create displays, sounds, or other effects" (&lt;http://www.future- health.org/brainmas.htm&gt;). These recordings, however, explain very little about why someone is unable to lift a leg or move a hand, for example, when the connections between the thalamus, the basal ganglia, and the motor cortex are damaged. Explaining behavior and the mechanisms of life has been the domain of the sciences. Remarkably, the mind was in fact neglected in Western biology and medicine, as medical research focussed on the physiology and pathology of the body proper, developing ever more specialized areas of internal medicine. Neurology as the study of brain diseases developed relatively late in the course of the last century. Eventually, over the past few decades, a growing interest in the nervous system and the mind has led to the current wave of research in the "embodied mind" and the"neural self" (Antonio Damasio). But how did the "neural self" and the "dancing brain" meet? As Corinne Jola (Insti- tute of Cognitive Neuroscience, London) and Fred Mast (Zentrum fur Neurowis- senschaft Ziirich) suggest, experimental dance science has only recently become possible through interdisciplinary university programs, while research in dance previously "focused mainly on philosophical, historical and aesthetical questions as well on physical problems, such as frequent injuries in dance. Much less is known about the mental processes associated with dance."4 Similarly, the use of performing arts to study the brain doesn't have a long history. When you ask researchers in the sciences, they'll say that it's a very competitive field and easier to get funding for hard core science that yields findings useful to industry and the medical health sectors. Why would governments spend money on dance research when neurological study can discover improvements for patients suffering from trauma, epilepsy, or Parkinson's Disease? Scientists need to publish results or gain patents that are considered significant contributions to knowledge in their fields, rather than offering a service (and some scientific visualizations) to the arts, as it has been very superficially proposed in recent trends to promote neuroaesthetics. Warren Neidich's symposium at London's Goldsmiths College (&lt;http://www.artbrain. org/&gt;) last year claimed that artists have begun to investigate the brain, neuroaesthetics being a dynamic process through which questions of neuroscience are made "ready- mades." Concepts such as sensation, perception, memory, and, recently, networks, plasticity and sampling incite artistic experimentation. While this may be true, neuroaesthetics strikes me as parasitic and, like my experience at Hellerau, quite banal. It's easy today to use biofeedback devices and body scans to generate visual images or sound for performance, as it was done in Otmar Gendera's and Dieter Heitkamp's BrainDance project (2004), Jennifer Monson's BirdBrainDance (2005), MorrisonDance's Inside (2005), or numerous other performances reaching back to the 1990s when Diane Gromola (with Yacov Sharir) explored virtual real- ity and immersive design using manipulated "objective" MRI data of her body to "move inside" them. Gromola's Dancing with the Virtual Dervish may have been a stunning experience, but it would not have yielded the knowledge that Jola/Mast, BIRRINGER / Performance and Science n 31</page><page sequence="11">I- ?r- CFC~n~ 1.~?-.?i ., r 1 rC- I ra:?k?i~ ittl ~s : 4 =r ??( 'li f 21 c, ._ ~i 5s?? ;t- ?*?. --~?'? ?:?I ~~~i?l~i"?";.? r '!CL.

" ,A 32 1 PAJ 85</page><page sequence="12">Beatriz Calvo-Merino, Annette Hartmann, Catherine Stevens, Phil Barnard, Steven Brown, Scott deLahunta, and other scientists and dance scholars today are thinking of when they initiate collaborative research to investigate brain activity in the mir- ror system (mirror neurons) during action observation or compare brain activation during execution and observation of specific motor skills. When choreographer Wayne McGregor (Random Dance Company), along with Scott deLahunta, received science funding to work with experimental psychologists at the Cambridge University Department of Neuroscience, the "Choreography and Cognition" project (&lt;http://www.choreocog.net&gt;) opened up a new platform for dance studies and cognitive science-not because McGregor later composed Ataxia and based it on his research experience, but because dancers and neuroscientists worked together over an extended period of time exchanging hypotheses and methodologies. The ground was thus prepared for testing representations of kinematic properties, looking at the tools of research and the framework of observation, questioning the notion of "mental images" (the movie in your head while you dance may not only be visual but involve various complex somatosensory contributions to spatial cognition, coordination, proprioceptive processing, etc.). Perhaps even questioning the transac- tions of knowledge, namely what exactly is considered of value or significance as a professional outcome within different communities of practice. Similarly, William Forsythe and Ivar Hagendoorn convened an international symposium on "Dance and the Brain" (Frankfurt 2004) which revealed the extent to which neuroscientific investigation-for example, of the motor repertoire and the recognition of possible or impossible movement-is based on neuroimaging technologies (PET, MRI) which seem to have evolved alongside very sophisticated digital tools and scanning/capturing techniques choreographers recently began to use for sensory "measuring" of action and qualities of gesture. The shared tools and technologies of observation are one common platform for productive transactions between artistic, educational, and scientific communities. Mental training (often cited in regard to sports), health issues, and cultural assump- tions about bodymind and mental maps of bodies provide ample ground for research, and current neurobiological interest in emotions and feelings, similar to psycho- acoustic research in music, offers provocative questions about representation. At the 2004 Monaco Dance Forum, a team of dance and media artists, acoustic and technology experts, as well as psychologists specialized in kinesiology studied such neuroanatomical representation by testing how interactive technologies give a high degree of fidelity to registering positions, speed, direction, and intensity of small and big movements. Armando Menicacci, director of the Mediadanse Lab in Paris, was able to demonstrate there the significance of "pre-movements" in the abdomi- nal musculature which cannot be perceived by the naked eye. The recent software developments, deLahunta noted, make it possible to work with a high resolution of data and to trace sound, lightlimage, and even "haptics" effects which allow the instantaneous recording in the field of the consciousness of the movement. BIRRINGER / Performance and Science U 33</page><page sequence="13">This is an exemplary avenue of shared study which promises the more sustained "rencontres entre le monde del'art et la recherchd scientifique" envisioned by the 2005 science lab at the Grenoble Festival des Imaginaires. It involves collaboration on a global level, as was demonstrated at the recent Digital Cultures Lab (&lt;http://www. digitalcultures.org&gt;) when Rachel Zuanon (Brazil) spoke about her cross-cultural research in a presentation entitled "Co-evolutionary Interfaces: the communication among brain, computer, and body that dances." Jayachandran Palazhy (India) pre- sented his extraordinary Nagarika DVD-an integrated information system on Indian Physical Traditions which delves deeply into the subjects' extended consciousness and memory of dance forms. Palazhy is not a scientist explaining the neural basis of Bharat Natyam, as Steven Brown tried to do in his experiment with tango dancers in Texas. But the master teachers in his DVD explain eloquently (and demonstrate) what happens in the form and how they know the feeling of what is happening. Steven Brown's PET scan provides objective, comparative data; the Indian masters tell comparative stories of dancing practiced nearly their entire lives. The objectives of each project are different, yet the methods, stimuli, and tasks demonstrated by the dancers indicate shared possibilities for dance and science collaborative research. The study of mental imaging for the execution of complex, polyrhythmic move- ment (e.g., in African and Latin dance) or the analysis of specific motor skills to enhance execution seem of obvious relevance to dancers. The reciprocities between dance or music improvisation and cellular movement, now increasingly recognized in the study of dynamic, self-organizing systems, suggest the kind of inquiries into time consciousness (temporality, sequencing) and the physical biology of flow that were anticipated in Kenneth King's writings on dancing perception-the scanning of detail and pattern recognition.5 THE SINGING DETECTIVE Cynthia Hopkins's multimedia operetta, Accidental Nostalgia, may not reflect the laboratory-based approach to art and science, but she and her band Gloria Deluxe exquisitely remind us of the theatrical power of a charged performance that claims its introspections into the mind, in song and visuals, as a poetic journey filled with superb ironies. These are journeys exceeding computational analysis. The qualities of her gestures are infused with dark humor and the ambiguous smile of the cabaret chanteuse, making us ponder how to interpret the inflections of her voice, the musi- cal arrangements, and the perplexing micro-video vignettes, created right there on the stage by her media designers and co-performers, Jim Findlay and Jeff Sugg, who use a small spy camera to great effect, for example in the scene where Hopkins's character returns home to Georgia to the house where she thinks she might have killed her father. On a miniature set, stage right, Hopkins steps into the "street" that leads to the "door" of the "house"-dramatic real-time video shots created inside a little puppet theatre box. On the surface, Accidental Nostalgia takes off as a research lecture into memory pro- cesses, amnesia, and the after-effects of incestuous abuse. Medical slides depict the struggle over the possibility of blocking out and later retrieving repressed memories of traumatic events. But then Hopkins performs her journey through amnesia, 34 U PAJ 85</page><page sequence="14">surreal rememberings, self-observation, speculation, and dreams, and the scientific imagination is translated into the artistic. She ends up transforming herself, undress- ing/redressing as her mother/herself in Morocco, now partly veiled and beginning a life reborn as a daughter whose disappeared father's confession finally reaches her via a video letter, brilliantly staged for us. The reading of a testimony performed by the father in front of the camera is simultaneously performed, adopted, and ironically subverted by the daughter. At its most imaginative, such performance is like opera, a heightened concentration of many perspectives, rhythms, voices, and polyphonic energies, sustained for hours. In Accidental Nostalgia, the science of the brain is refracted as continuous transfers between film, dance, music, and computer-assisted montage-live digital art at its best, reviving narrative traditions. My nostalgia for opera is growing stronger now, after all these years of having writ- ten on technology and media in this journal. I hope this won't be a paradox, but a continuous effort to observe how digital performance can distill and exceed the laboratory experiments and incomplete prototypes, and-like Monteverdi's Orfeo and L'incoronazione di Poppea marking the beginnings of modern opera-come into its own or, rather, into its own complex interactions. When Poppea sings about lust and ambition, is she, like Hopkins in Accidental Nostalgia, not singing about a body's mind performing with someone else's programming? The body, Stelarc would argue, has become a host for remote and multiple agents. In the performance ethos of the scientific era, this body is being re-engineered in all the terrains of our digital cultures. NOTES 1.
