<plain_text><page sequence="1">Literature &amp; Theology, Vol. 16. No. 2, June 2002 JOHN TERPSTRA AND THE SACRAMENTAL IN URBAN GEOGRAPHY Deborah Bowen Abstract Contemporary Canadian poet John Terpstra comes from a Christian Reformed background that emphasises the value both of nature and of human culture. Since God indwells, sustains, and renews the creation at every point, God is present not only in the natural world but also in the humanmade world of shopping mall and suburban street. From an understanding that all place is holy because upheld by God, Terpstra shows how the sacred inhabits the everyday even in contemporary urban space, working with the rocks, trees and water that undergird the city itself. I. THE MATERIAL LOCATION OF THE SACRED Flannery o'connor once wrote, 'The writer operates at a peculiar crossroads where time and place and eternity somehow meet. His problem is to find that location.'1 Thus O'Connor, a Roman Catholic, positions the creative writer on the borders of what has been called religious geography, whose concern is 'the geography and cosmology that are in the mind of the religious man, the way in which, informed by his faith, he sees his world and his place in it'.2 The Christian writer's search for a 'location' will likely also include the desire to situate the often uneasy realities of the present in the context of a traditional religious history and sensibility. Among poets of the last half-century in Canada, this particular search of faith has proven more productive than a cursory glance at the poetry anthologies or the criticism might suggest.3 Northrop Frye's conclusion to the first edition of the Literary History of Canada (1965) described Christianity as 'a major—perhaps the major—cultural force in Canada' until well into the first half of the twentieth century.4 In the literary and academic circles of the late twentieth- and early twenty-first centuries, in Canada as elsewhere, Christian faith has often been dismissed as untenable and unrespectable, well-replaced by the scepticisms of post structuralism and the empiricisms of neo-Marxism. Nevertheless, David Kent has pointed out in the Introduction to his anthology of Christian Poetry in © Oxford University Press 2002</page><page sequence="2">DEBORAH BOWEN 189 Canada (1989) that Christianity in fact 'continues to be a hidden, often unacknowledged reality in Canadian culture'.5 Undoubtedly the best-known contemporary Christian poet in Canada is Margaret Avison (b. 1918), who has been called 'one of [Canada's] finest but least prolific poets'.6 Her writing spans almost half a century; it is dense and elusive, philosophically complex but, particularly after her conversion to Christianity in 1963, sensuously vivid. Because of her consummate craftsman ship, Avison is highly respected by her readers, whether or not they share the 'location' she has found in her faith, and significant work has been done on her poetry.7 Of her peers there is none who has written with her intensity of Christian faith, though perhaps the meditations on Judaism in A.M. Klein (1909—72) and Eli Mandel (1922-92) and the more recent spiritually-oriented poetry of Leonard Cohen (b. 1934) carry a comparable weight of authenticity. Of the better-known Canadian writers of the last half-century in the Christian tradition, Jay Macpherson (b. 1931) has produced some significant work, though inspired more by Judaeo-Christian mythology than overtly by faith; Joy Kogawa (b. 1935), though probably most widely-known as a novelist, has written some finely crafted and lyrically magnetic poetry explicitly out of her Christian faith perspective. Among more recent poets, Patrick Friesen (b. 1946) and Di Brandt (b. 1952) have written, not always positively, out of their Mennonite backgrounds, and Bernadette Rule (b. 1950) much more positively out of her Roman Catholic one; Maggie Helwig (b. 1961) has written some fine faith-inspired poetry out of a mystical sensibility. But to find a Canadian poet of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century whose work is informed through and through by Christian conviction combined with levels of poetic intensity and material awareness even approaching Avison's, I would say we must turn, albeit while recognising a very different poetic sensibility, to John Terpstra (b. 1953). I want to propose that the problem that O'Connor described, that is the writer's problem of finding the location 'where time and place and eternity somehow meet', is a problem to which Terpstra has found his answer, and that the answer can be couched in terms of Northrop Frye's comment on Canada's 'famous problem of identity'. Frye argued in 1971 that Canadian sensibility is 'less perplexed by the question "Who am I?" than by some such riddle as "Where is here?" ' Frye's formulation is in tune with contemporary questions of cultural geography, questions that reach beyond the narrow confines of interpreting landscape and analysing ecological process to a consideration of 'imagery and symbolism, value and meaning, conflict and compromise'.9 As Gareth Griffiths has written recently, 'Land, and its extensions into theories of the construction of space and place, has emerged, alongside studies of the colonial body, as one of the most important recent sites for articulating contemporary cultural concerns.'10 Terpstra's work explores the relationship</page><page sequence="3">190 JOHN TERPSTRA AND URBAN GEOGRAPHY of the material and the spiritual in contemporary urban space. He asks, 'Can a person have an experience of Nature with a capital N in an urban environment?'11 A reading of Terpstra's work, particularly Naked Trees (1990), The Church Not Made with Hands (1997), and his present work-in-progress, will show that his answer is, clearly, Yes, and that this experience of urban Nature can be as profound and lifegiving as any of those journeys to distant lakes and forests more traditionally associated in the Canadian imagination with access to the transcendent.12 In fact, Terpstra might respond to that question about the location of the crossroads of time, place and eternity by declaring, in the middle of the city, 'Here is where.' The two books I have mentioned above are set in and around Terpstra's home town of Hamilton, Ontario, which happens also to be mine. Terpstra comes out of the Christian Reformed tradition and is now a Presbyterian with Anglican connections. He has a fine reputation as a poet in Canada, and has won numerous awards for his poetry, including first prize in the annual Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio Literary Competition in 1992, and two book awards in Arts Council competitions in 1995 and 1997. In September of 2000 he was 'Artist of the Month' on the webpage of Image magazine, a prestigious and beautifully-produced journal of the arts and religion in the United States.13 His name itself, like those of so many Canadians, signals what one might call his displacement: he is a first-generation Canadian whose family came from Friesland in the Netherlands after the Second World War. Thus he writes out of a very wide personal sense of place—a sense that crosses the North Atlantic and encompasses the land each side of it, even as it centres on the particularities of Hamilton and south-western Ontario. He also writes, unavoidably, from the always-given of his faith in God. In a forthcoming essay called 'Falling, Not Far From the Tree,' he says, 'Perhaps it [belief] is in my bones. My Frisian forebears killed and purportedly then dined on the first missionary who challenged their ways, St Boniface, after which the message he was delivering seems to have entered into their collective bloodstream.'14 His early volume Forty Days and Forty Nights (1987) treats specifically of the uprooting and resettlement of Dutch immigrants to Canada, when 'we had no names, just places we were sent/ like mail from overseas',15 but were still able eventually, after all the hardship of moving rocks and felling trees and living in shacks, to 'show his [God's] glory, not displaced/ in people who'd been moved from there to here'.16 Perhaps in part because Terpstra is also a cabinetmaker by trade, his consciousness of the materiality of place is very acute. I want to suggest that the material world for Terpstra is profoundly sacramental—that is to say, that the material world, even under duress, con stantly stands as 'an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace', as my childhood catechism taught me to say of the Christian church's</page><page sequence="4">DEBORAH BOWEN 191 sacraments.17 Or, as Gerard Manley Hopkins once wrote in Victorian England, 'The world is charged with the grandeur of God./ It will flame out, like shining from shook foil.' Although in different language, Terpstra would, I think, agree. In his book Locations of the Sacred: Essays on Religion, Literature, and Canadian Culture (1998), William Closson James describes traditional Christianity as having an otherworldly view of what he calls the sacred, which is 'customarily assigned' to a domain beyond the earth. Consequently he argues that '[according to the prevailing Western religious view, regarding nature as numinous is idolatry'.18 According to this view, the natural world cannot be seen as a location of the sacred,19 because it is provisional, 'a temporary arrangement before the establishment of a new order and the final revelation of God's purposes'."11 On the other hand, James acknowledges that some recent Canadian fiction has suggested the reality of a sacred dimension beyond the dailiness of life, so that there has been a move to relocate the sacred as a this worldly transcendence experienced in the moments of crisis that disrupt the ordinary. But for Terpstra, writing from his roots in a Christian Reformed tradition that rests on a Neo-Calvinist base, the 'sacred' is profoundly and intrinsically implicated in this world to begin with, so that there is no need of heightened or extreme moments for the presence of the divine to be apparent. In the European Reformation of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, reflections on God's handiwork in creating the earth and its inhabitants led to an understanding of geography as a theologically oriented discipline, 'the science of the visible side of the Divine revelation'."1 Moreover, for someone raised in the direct line of the Christian Reformation, not only is the natural world sacramental, in the sense of manifesting the glory and presence of God, but so too, potentially, are the humanmade cultures that have grown up upon and within it. Terpstra's particular gift is to attest to the presence of God in the interrelationship of the natural and the cultural in the simple and sacred light of everyday. II. THE LEGACY OF IMMIGRATION Neo-Calvinism, as it developed in the Netherlands in the late nineteenth century, contradicts the popular idea that Calvinism is inherently anti-artistic. The Cambridge theologian Jeremy Begbie, in his 1991 book Voicing Creation's Praise, points out that one of Calvinism's deepest drives is 'a consuming desire to activate the Church [i.e. the body of believers] into a thorough engagement with every field of culture'.22 The founding father of Neo-Calvinism, Abraham Kuyper, cried, 'There is not a single inch of the whole terrain of our human existence over which Christ ... does not exclaim, "Mine!".' In one of his famous Stone Lectures on Calvinism, delivered at Princeton in 1898, Kuyper declared, 'Understand that art is no fringe that is attached to the</page><page sequence="5">192 JOHN TERPSTRA AND URBAN GEOGRAPHY garment, and no amusement that is added to life, but a most serious power in our present existence.' The 'cultural mandate' of Genesis i calls on human kind to cultivate and subdue the earth; 'culture', then, consists in drawing out what is implicit in creation, and actualising its latent potential. Though there has been much criticism in the last half-century of the imperialistic excesses apparently authorised by this mandate, there has developed a strong counter voice from within the Christian church that emphasises instead the biblical call to wise stewardship of creation." Indeed, one of the first writers to critique the hubristic behaviours of Christian anthropocentrism under modernity, Lynn White, called at the same time for a revolutionary 'alternative Christian' care of creation, arguing that, 'Since the roots of our trouble are so largely religious, the remedy must also be essentially religious, whether we call it that or not.'25 For the Neo-Calvinist, this stewardly call extends beyond the natural world to what is broadly understood under the rubric of 'culture'. Begbie puts it like this: for the Neo-Calvinist, he says, 'the history of human culture is the story of the myriad of ways in which men and women have sought to open up creation through interacting with the natural world and with each other'.26 Here, then, is the aspect of Calvinist theology that justifies a wholehearted cultural involvement, which manifests itself as an emphasis on the incontro vertible value both of nature and of human culture. Since God indwells, sustains, and renews the creation at every point, God is present not only in the natural world, but also in the humanmade world of downtown street and shopping mall, created by those who, though they have fallen and though they are sinful, nevertheless retain the mark of God's image. Place is holy, in the sense that it is sustained by and witnesses to God; we are rooted to it, acculturised into it, given our conditions of being by it, and thus it plays a significant part in defining our relationship not only to the socio-political but also to the divine. Closson James cites in his book the arresting point made by Peter Slater, an Anglican theologian at the University of Toronto, that there is no English Canadian equivalent to American civic religion, founded on a sense of God's guiding the history of the new Promised Land. Slater suggests that '[w]hen we look for traces of transcendence and saving power in Canadian experience, we must look more to the land than to our divisive history'.27 Geography is certainly vitally important for Terpstra, because he is centrally concerned with the problem of human beings learning how to live in symbiosis with their environment. George Grant's Technology and Empire, writes Closson James, implies that 'the historical legacy of European immigration to North America dooms non-native Canadians to continuing alienation from the natural environment, to a lack of spiritual connection with the landscape'.28 Terpstra is an exception to this posited rule, because what his Neo-Calvinist 'legacy of immigration' has made possible for him is not only a recognition of the sacramental in the physical geography of the natural environment,</page><page sequence="6">DEBORAH BOWEN 193 but also a recognition of the inescapably religious nature of the social and humanmade geography that depends upon it. The book for which Terpstra won the CBC literary competition, Captain Kintail, is about precisely these relationships: a group of people, adults and kids, spend a wet spring weekend out of town, by the lake, and create in a dilapidated camp a community as harmonious with the natural world as they are able to do—at one and the same time as otherworldly as that of the first men on the moon, and as earthy as those of First Nations peoples." Indeed, there is something about this community that is also a communion with the earth, something that is 'holy': the word recurs. And this linkage of physical and spiritual geography has other roots for Terpstra, older than Neo-Calvinism, as well: he has been profoundly affected by the ancient British notion of the earth as a sleeping giant or king, a notion which was overlaid with Christian symbolism as the sleeper came to be identified both with Christ, and with the church as the body of Christ before the final resurrection. It was in his 1982 article on 'The Sleeping Lord', a long poem by the twentieth-century Welsh poet David Jones, that Terpstra spelled out the connection in Jones that is also in Terpstra, between the land, the people, and the culture. He writes of Jones's poem that '[tjhe lord who sleeps is the embodiment of a whole people and their culture, and this embodiment includes their physical landscape'.30 III. URBAN GEOGRAPHY For these very reasons, then, in writing about contemporary culture, Terpstra's is as often as not an urban geography. I first met his work ten years ago, when I was asked to review Naked Trees, a collection of prose poetry, for the Journal of Canadian Poetry.31 I found it a refreshing surprise in a number of ways. For a start, it is a book about city trees, composed in reaction to the discovery that, for the City Works Department: 'This is the year they're taking down the trees.' Hamilton, though its reputation is as a steel city, is also a city of tall and abundant trees, a feature often remarked upon by visitors both from the windswept prairie provinces and from the less temperate regions of eastern Ontario and Quebec. Terpstra describes these Hamilton trees as dignified companions and helpmates along sidewalks and surrounded by highways, more able to contain contradiction than people are, living in tension with them, and open, like people, to abuse. One of the doomed trees is a silver maple which is first introduced like a person, living 'across the street and five doors down, eighty-four years old'. The tree names are as present and familiar as those of the people on the street: the old woman whose father planted the silver maple '[kjnowjs] the ones who grew from seed. Hayes, Butternut. The transplanted ones. Locust. Ash. Dorman. The ones you have to watch. Ryan. Box Elder.' The trees have more grandeur, perhaps more life, than the people, so that their felled trunks have the forceful appearance of 'Someone else's altar. Who</page><page sequence="7">194 JOHN TERPSTRA AND URBAN GEOGRAPHY doesn't live here anymore'. Later passages identify trees with Christ, insofar as they have laid down their timber to help humankind, 'cradle to coffin' ('Transpiration'), even to the point of humiliation where they bear the mark of the cross as utility poles spanning the country ('Utility Poles'). The epigraph to the book declares that 'Naked trees extend their complicated praise/ branches sway, in/ a sort of unison/ not agreed upon'; the final entry, 'Yes,' concludes that 'A tree is an act of affirmation.' Thus the book is a homage to trees in their dignity and variousness, a declaration of their quasi-priesthood in taking an 'intercessory role' that provides 'a continuity from heaven to earth to the waters under the earth' ('Indifference'). Terpstra has here enlivened and elevated the pathetic fallacy with such eloquent conviction as almost to cast serious doubts on its fallaciousness. The Church Not Made With Hands, published seven years later, takes up the theme of the sacramental in trees in a sequence of poems called 'This Orchard Sound', first written for performance with jazz accompaniment in church on Good Friday, and roughly based on the traditional 'stations of the cross'. The sequence concerns Terpstra the carpenter seeking out a tree from which to make a cross for the church, and his experiences of being the tree's betrayer and murderer, in an orchard in Burlington 'located near a six-lane highway/ in an area zoned for ... light industry'. The name of Burlington, a town on the main highway along the edge of Lake Ontario between Toronto and the United States, functions as a kind of Ontarian code for the suburban sprawl that Terpstra most dislikes; he writes elsewhere in this book that 'I badmouth Burlington so strongly/ my daughter now complains of headaches/ when we're driving through.' " What is wrong with urban sprawl, he has said in conversation, is what it does to the land: there is no sense of symbiosis, or of living in harmony with the earth; rather, urban sprawl represents out-and-out conquest, the worst aspects of an imperialist mentality." But in 'This Orchard Sound', he feels unwillingly complicit. He drags a tree branch home from the mutilated orchard, and when he has prepped the branch, 'pried/ under skin,' he leaves it: Cleaned, and naked, propped outside for time to let the living water locked within surface abandon the body, dry like bone34 The woundedness of both tree and earth are constant cries in this series of poems; but what Terpstra has to say is that his being implicated as the killer, his guilt, is inevitable, and paradigmatic of the human condition, and that the wounds, which produce the church's cross, are, paradigmatically, the wounds of love.</page><page sequence="8">DEBORAH BOWEN 195 This kind of material and geographical specificity which both embodies and then symbolises a spiritual truth is typical of the way Terpstra thinks and writes, about more than trees. 'Flames of Affection' opens: I walked to the end of Dundum Street, to the quiet hind of a busy road, where the bus loops. I walked to the foot of the escarpment and looked up, way, way, up, at all those stairs. The conversational voice here speaks particularly to me, because I happen to live where the bus loops, just off Dundurn, at the foot of those stairs. But the voice also speaks easily to contemporary urban dwellers in other cities, other places. And what it says is, in the same way, specific as to place and time, but also huge in its spatial and temporal displacements, or, better, in its trans cendence. The line of thought that proposes that cultural geography cannot and must not deal with the personal religious experience seems to me profoundly wrongheaded at this point: Terpstra's experience is personal, but also grounded in a particular religious tradition, and spacious enough to appeal to readers of a wide range of faith perspectives. Even from a non-sectarian perspective, Lily Kong argues that this kind of 'personal religious experience with place' can and should be explored for the light it sheds on 'broader cultural geographical trends which seek after environmental experience and sense of place'.35 The point of Terpstra's climb up the stairs is that it is a climb up the three hundred and fifty million years of rock deposit and formation of the Niagara escarpment, as it curves its way through Hamilton and around the Dundas Valley after leaving Niagara Falls. And when the evening lights come on 'like/ the lively little tongues of lovers/ in the flame of affection' all over the city below, the scene reminds the narrator of Pentecost, 'kind of. And then this whole scene becomes an image for a more immediately personal scenario: the light years of distance between people who hold tenaciously to mutually exclusive belief systems and cannot communicate, for whom Terpstra wishes new tongues of fire to erase their difference: If only the window would blow open once, and the conversation catch, like fire, so that we're both, we're all consumed, and the room isn't big enough anymore, and we take to the street, and talk and talk, and the languages we've learned to cultivate exhaust themselves, so we have to dig deeper and break out other mother tongues, and get a bit drunk, spilling words</page><page sequence="9">196 JOHN TERPSTRA AND URBAN GEOGRAPHY we never said before, didn't know we knew ...36 and this language is so contagious that others join in, and the face of the earth is changed. 'But here,/ today', the poet takes home a stone chip from the top of the cliff, to remind himself and those near to him with whom he can't communicate 'how hard it is./ How long it's taken to get here'. IV. TIME, PLACE, AND ETERNITY As 'here' and 'today', place and time, by a process of synechdoche become universals as well as specifics in this poem, so the slippage between time and eternity, place and all space, is a constant in Terpstra's poems. A second poem for Pentecost in this volume, 'Explicable as the Centre Mall', considers the common sight in this part of the world of a group of retired old men from Eastern Europe gathering cheerfully in a shopping mall to walk, to chat, to play chess, as 'a kind of evangel' among the sour 'boys and girls who tend the shops/ ... in their dolled cages', but concludes that 'the confusion of tongues and cultures' in the mall was too complicated for him to interpret, 'bested my glossolalia, simple as wine'. There is another poem in this section, 'Uncarved Totems', that talks about something as daily as telegraph poles being analogous to the dead who keep our lives together, who 'line the way, stand by/ to haul our messages .../ ... to bear/ our sometime recognition, grief and memory,' because these 'barkless columns of pine' are also the dead 'who go,/ who also stay'. This poem was written for All Saints' Day. Like 'This Orchard Sound' it harks back to the concerns of Naked Trees. I will never again see in the same way those telegraph poles that I pass every day along Aberdeen Avenue by Longwood Road, the very ones about which Terpstra is writing. And so Terpstra's version of Kuralek's paintings in A Northern Nativity is 'The Little Towns of Bethlehem', a poem in which he sees the birth of every child all over Canada as the birth of the Christchild; it is both specific to particular locations right across Canada ('An angel of the lord appears in the night sky/ over Rankin Inlet, over/ Iqualuit' [sic]) and universal ('and nativity is given/ every name'). In a similar way, Terpstra's cycle of poems for Lent is set in that one specific overgrown and abandoned orchard a few kilometers from Hamilton, along Harvester Road outside Burlington, but it is an orchard that represents every fall from paradise and every sin of humankind that has been paid for by Christ on the felled tree of the cross. The epigraph to the book, taken from the same song as the book's title, is 'she is everywhere and no place', which initially I took only in its universal aspect; as I read Terpstra's poems more carefully, I realised he meant me to take the 'everywhere' quite literally, and therefore quite specifically.</page><page sequence="10">DEBORAH BOWEN 197 Not only may any child's birth parallel that of the Christ-child, but any living creature's activity may suggest the activity of God. Terpstra's vision of God is sometimes radically other than what might be considered usual in the Christian tradition; his God can be more subversive, more playful, more wily— almost the trickster figure of North American Indian mythology. For instance, in 'To God, as a Small Pest', a poem in the 1998 Devil's Punch Bowl collection, Terpstra imagines God as one of the boldly ubiquitous black Ontario squirrels, 'scrambling, light-as-air, over the roof': I believe, now, you have no pride; an imagination that ranges wildly, seizing any shape that fits, adopting what'll do, with a relentless playfulness, and your insidious intent; and I resist this recognition, as strongly as the gnawing at my fascia, soffit, that I imagine comes next, and tense and listen for. Here Terpstra's concern is not so much 'to maintain or to restore the equilibrium inherent in nature', which is George Grant's understanding of the purpose of religion for First Nations people.38 Rather, he is interested in the myriad and unexpected ways in which the grandeur of God will flame out in the world that we inhabit every day; he is interested in God's myriad ways of being present in his creation, in God's signing of his name in every place we look, even with signatures that we resist. It is for reasons such as these that, as Terpstra pointed out in an email to me, he has not used God's name: 'Thus far, the God in question has not required a three-lettered presence. The three lettered-presence is implicit in all the other letters, words, and sentences of , ,39 the poems, anyway. V. FALLING INTO PLACE Terpstra has just completed a new venture—a book of sustained non-fictional prose, the first forty pages of which were published a year ago in the beautifully-produced Nova Scotian journal Gaspereau Review, and were entitled 'Falling into Place'. These pages comprise an essay about the sandbar under the highway on the west side of Hamilton Harbour at the westernmost tip of Lake Ontario. Terpstra considers its history, its metamorphoses, its interactions with the people of the area, and the fact of his attachment to it: 'I am attached to a piece of geography, in an urban setting,' he writes, and then counters with the surprise that his own pronouncement arouses in him. He shows and tells the ways in which this 'piece of geography' is attached to the people around</page><page sequence="11">198 JOHN TERPSTRA AND URBAN GEOGRAPHY it: 'Like many of us who live around, beside, and atop this feature of the landscape, the stuff it's made of comes from elsewhere. Pushed and dragged all the way, the sand and gravel and pebble and cobble were deposited here by ice age glaciers as unceremoniously as an immigrant ship discharging its cargo of humanity.'42 Since everyone in Canada, with the exception of the First Nations people, is a relatively recent immigrant, this relationship between the land and the people is not merely sentimental, or fanciful, or metaphorical. 'Come, let us anthropomorphize the landscape. The story here is about bodies—human, liquid, and that one called earth—about where and how they meet, and what happens then.'43 There is an interdisciplinarity inherent in Terpstra's vision—sociology, psychology, history, biology, geography are connected words: 'The words begin to form in my mind: I am attached to how the lines are drawn here. Geo graphis. I am attached to what is written. Inlet, shoreline, sandbar, ravine.' His interest in the relationship between these interdisciplinary bodies has been present from his earliest work. In Forty Days and Forty Nights, there is a poem called 'A Ceremony, To Dedicate a Tree and the Backyard it One Day Hopes to Dominate' which reads like a prospectus of the interests Terpstra will explore in his future work. The trees are there, of course, but also the local and human history of urban settlement, the relationship of trees to buildings and to people, and the only-half-fanciful parallels between the three: 'this is to the oddball angles and curves, indoors and out/ and to living geometry'. So in this latest project Terpstra spends time, both in the library and on the site, exploring the rich history and geography and biology of the sandbar across the area called Burlington Heights, and comes to the conclusion that 'there may actually be more to receive, and to give, here where the sandbar's arm lies broken and the bodies are buried, where the inlet's mouth is closed and landfill meets the saddened water, than can be dreamt of on starry nights by northern lakes'.46 The revitalisation of the dead metaphors of anthropomorphic terminology has by now become a Terpstra trademark. This is not mere romanticism for Terpstra—it is a statement about the interrelatedness of material things, the relationship of people and trees and rocks and water and highways and cars and houses and shopping malls and stairs up the escarpment. The 'bodies [that] are buried' are in this case literal human bodies, in a cemetery that lies along the bar, and past which every visitor to Hamilton must drive as he or she enters the city; but they are also, by a kind of transference, the bodies of the sandbar and the water. When Terpstra ends this piece '[s]itting in a car on a sandbar in a slow motion through time',47 there is an almost dizzying sense in which we as readers experience that peculiar crossroads of which Flannery O'Connor spoke, 'where time and place and eternity somehow meet': we too are 'attached to a piece of geography, in an urban setting'. Poetry has this cohesive</page><page sequence="12">DEBORAH BOWEN 199 ability; it can enable the reader to experience attachment without fully understanding it. Considering the interface between geography and religion, Kong writes, 'The functionalist's understanding of religion as having a manifest function (of explaining that which is outside humankind and mysterious to it) as well as a latent one (as a socially cohesive force) has been neglected by geographers and merits attention.'48 This manifest function energises and infuses Terpstra's poetry of urban geography. Years ago now, in an interview with Calvinist Contact, Terpstra said, 'I would like to be given the grace to enjoy God enough so that the way I write would give that same enjoyment to others.' As we pay attention to 'how the lines are drawn here', in these most recent pages of Terpstra's, experientially we learn something profound not only about the interrelationship of nature and culture, not only about our own geosocial context, wherever that may be, but also about our humanness, and our fallenness, and about a charge to the world that I think can best be described as sacramental.
