<plain_text><page sequence="1">LITERATURE Prepared by Sidney Glazer, Near East Section, Library of Congress With contributions from: Nabia Abbott, Elizabeth Bacon, G. L. Della Vida, John Dorosh, Richard Ettinghausen, Carl Ginsburg, Sidney Glazer, Harold W. Glidden, Harvey P. Hall, Cecil Hobbs, Herbert J. Liebesny, George C. Miles, Leon Nemoy, William I. Preston, C. Rabin, and Benjamin Schwartz. Note: It is the aim of the Bibliography to present a selective and annotated listing of peri- odical material dealing with the Middle East roughly since the rise of Islam. In order to avoid unwarranted duplication of excellent bibliographies already dealing with certain aspects and portions of the area, the material included will cover only North Africa and Moslem Spain, the Arab world, Ethiopia and Eritrea, Turkey, the Transcaucasian states of Soviet Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Turkestan, and India. The ancient Near East, Byzantium, Zionism and Palestine I are excluded; in the case of India; only material dealing with history and the social sciences since i6oo will normally be considered.2 An attempt will be made to survey all periodicals of importance in these fields, with the exception of those published in the languages of India. 1 Palestine, Zionism; the Jews of Palestine, etc. are omitted only because of the existence of a current, cumulative bibliography devoted to this field, i.e. Zionism and Palestine, a publication of the Zionist Archives and Library in New York. 2 Art and archaeology, language and literature, etc. are well covered by the following: Kern Institute. Annual bibliography of Indian archaeology (Leiden); George M. Moraes. Bibliography of Indological studies 1942-, (Bombay), Konkan Institute of Arts and Sciences.

The obj ects unearthed are regarded as among the most ancient ever discovered on the territory of Soviet Central Asia. Toprak- Kala was the site of the most important excavations. Evidence was discovered pointing to active relationship between Khwarazm and the land of the Khazars. I134 \'OLGIN, V. P. "A trip to India." (in Russian) TVestnik Akad. Nauk SSSR I7/5 ('47) 46-69. A detailed account of a trip to India made in January 1947 by the delegation of the USSR Academy of Sciences to attend the congress of scien- tists. The author, who headed the Soviet delegation, found a good deal of interest in the USSR on the part of the intellec- tual classes of India, but also what he calls "misunderstanding," even of such documents as the Stalin constitution.

Britain and the East 63 (Ag '47) I 39-40. Some of the considerations facing Hyderabad and Travancore as they ponder the choice of affiliating with Pakistan or India, or of remaining independent. 1I139 "Oil on the Middle East chessboard." Gt. Brit. and the East 63 (S '47) ME 42-3. Britain's lead in Middle Eastern affairs does not meet with as much disapproval as Zionist propaganda might suggest. This applies both to oil and, presumably, to the handling of the Egyptian situation, also treated in this article. 1140 "Palestine and the Middle East -an intro- duction to the problem." Nation i65 (0 4 '47) 353-4. "Persons unacquainted with the Middle East are likely to apply to the area political concepts to which they are accustomed at home." This short ar- ticle corrects some of the prevailing mis- conceptions. II41 "IV. Revindication of the principle of legal equality of states, 187I-I9I4." Polit. Sci- ence Quart. 62 (Je '47) 258-86. Details of the Conference of Algeciras, 1906, are given on p.275ff.</page><page sequence="3">io6 THE MIDDLE EAST JOURNAL 1142 "Valediction to India - the last phase of the British Raj." Round Table No. I48 (S '47) 330-8. India is a rich field for constitutional experiment, particularly in regard to protection of rights of minori- ties, the development of means to achieve collaboration for specific common pur- poses not federalized in the ordinary way (e.g., railroads between Pakistan and India). The author does not deplore the passing of English rule, since only the Indians can effectively enforce agrarian reform, uproot or modify ancient social customs and religious usages, and defeat the forces of communism. 1143 "Victims of communal hatred in India: Muslim refugees at Delhi." Illust. Lon- don News 121 (0 4 '47) 367-9. Series of photographs of massacres at Delhi and some of the four million refugees in the Punjab. 1144 AHMAD, QAZI MUKHTAR. "Was Bai- ram Khan a rebel ?"

Dil ve Tarih-Cografya Fakiultesi Dergisi (Ankara) 5 (My-Je '47) 29I-309. The breakdown of the Jan- issary system is seen as resulting from the admission to Janissary status of large numbers of Turkish mercenaries, ca. I559, during the contest for power of Selim and Beyazid. The monetary inflation that rendered the Janissaries' living allowance insufficient is also cited as a reason. With German summary, pp. 310-I3. 1146 ALSOP, JOSEPH and STEWART. "Red Star over the Middle East." Sat. Eve. Post 220 (S 20 '47) 25ff. This article, like most of the writings of its authors, is long on adjectives, luridness, and imagi- nation, but short on facts. The paragraphs on Daniel Solod, Soviet Minister to Leb- anon and alleged master of the spy and propaganda network, reveal nothing new. They recommend implementation and prompt execution of the Bevin "People not Pasha" memorandum as the only means of thwarting Soviet plans for the Middle East. II47 ALTRINCHAM, LORD. "Les problemes du Moyen-Orient." Politique Etrangere (Paris) I2 (Jl '47) 261-74. Supports the thesis that Britain's security depends on the stabilization of the Middle East, to be effected by raising the intellectual, social and economic levels of the peoples as pro- claimed by the leaders of the Arab League. Advocates, naturally, the closest Anglo- French "human collaboration." 1148 AMERY, L. S. "The prospect in India to- day." Gt. Brit. and the East 63 (Ag '47) I 4I-2.

II56 CAHMAN, WERNER, J. "The Jews of North Africa." Jewish Frontier (New York) I4 (Jl '47) i6-I8. There is a strong possibility that reprisals will be taken against the sso,ooo Jews living in North Africa should there be an anti- Arab solution in Palestine. No matter what happens, the plight of the Jews there will remain critical. II57 CASTELLANO, VITTORIO. "Le orig- ini della colonia Eritrea e i tentativi di colonizzazione agricola." Affrica (Rome) 2 (JI I5 '47) I23-4. The first of a series of articles. 1158 CENSONI, DOMENICO. "La diversa risoluzione dei mantari internazionali nei territori del vicino oriente." Oriente Mod. (Rome) 27 (Ap-Je '47) 8i-6. Prncipally a review of the steps by which Syria and Lebanon gaine(d their independence.</page><page sequence="4">BIBLIOGRAPHJY 107 1159 CHAD, CARLOS. "Lendemains d'elec- tions au Liban." En Terre d'lslam 3/39 (3e trim. '47) 2II-6. A critical estimate of the upshot of the parliamentary elec- tions of May and June I947. ii6o CHARLES, H. "Les nomades de Syro- Mesopotamie et leur islamisation." En Terre d'Islam 3/39 (3e trim. '47) 17I-89. Points out that in this period of Islamic conquest, religious aspects received far less attention than during the previous conquest of Mecca and central Arabia. ii6i COLOMBE, MARCEL.

A detailed and documented account of the political events of these two years, with a particu- larly valuable section on the labor move- ment and the methods used to combat it.

"India- past, pres- ent and future." Polit. Science Quart. (New York) 62 (Je '47) 295-304. Dis- cusses a number of things, including Neh- ru's Discovery of India and the Chatham House report, British Security. II64 DEIGHTON, H. S. "Les relations Anglo- Egyptiennes." Politique Etrangere (Paris) I2 (Mr '47) 23-50. The central fact in re- cent Egyptian history is the rivalry between the palace and the Wafd party, which is interestingly related in this article. Some light is thrown on the still somewhat ob- scure developments in Egypt between 1939 and 1944. The author is not too optimistic about England's future in the Middle East. ii65 DYAKOV, A. "The new British plan for India." New Times (Moscow) No. 24 (J e 13 '47) 12-I5. The political dismem- berment of India will create new obstacles to her full liberation and will fail to bring about the economic, social and cul- tural reform necessary to ensure India's progress. iI66 FALLS, CYRIL. "Aftermath of war: the future of the Gurkha troops." Illust. Lon- don News 12I (Ag 23 '47) 206.

"France's dilemma in the Arab west." (in Arabic) Al-'A1am al-'Arab! (Cairo) I (Jl '47) 4-5. France's policy in North Africa is a defense re- action against Soviet communism and the American drive for the liberation of small peoples and the improvement of their standard of living. The author is a prominent leader in the Moroccan nation- alist movement. ii68 FERRO, MAURICE. "Egypt's bid for power." Nation I65 (0 4 '47) 362-4. A review of recent history. King Farouk does not want England's complete with- drawal from the Middle East because of his fear of communism. He looks upon the Arab League primarily as a tool to serve Egypt's objectives-rapid political and social evolution and union with the Sudan. II69 GHALLAB, 'ABD AL-KARIM. "The nationalist campaign in Morocco." (in Arabic) Al-Rssalah (Cairo) 620-2. A brief review of the Moroccan nationalist movement, beginning with the revolt of Mulay 'Abd al-Hafiz in I907 and ending with the activities of the present-day Hizb al-Istiqlal. 1170 GIANNINI, AMEDEO. "La societa degli stati arabi." Oriente Mod. (Rome) 27 (Ap-Je '47) 73-80. A detailed and able examination of the Pact. The mere fact that it could have been concluded has vital political significance. The League's future is still obscure. 117I GOKBILGIN, M. TAYYIB. "The Leba- non question and the Druzes from I840 to I86I." (in Turkish) Belleten Io (0 '46) 64I-703. A study based on official sources. 1172 HAINES, C. GROVE. "The problem of the Italian colonies."

Argues that the French influ- ence on Egyptian culture did not begin with the Napoleonic expedition, but much later. 1175 AL-HASRT, SATI'. "The French expedi- tion and the Egyptian renaissance - part 4." (in Arabic) Al-Thaqafah (Cairo) 9 (Ag 12 '47) 7-10. The final article in a</page><page sequence="5">1o8 THE MIDDLE EAST JOURNAL series designed to show that the idea of any connection between Napoleon's expe- dition to Egypt and the Egyptian renais- sance under Muhammad 'Ali is the prod- uct of the imagination of French writers and has no foundation in fact.

"Russian diplomacy and the Armenian question in the 80's of the eighteenth century." (in Russian) Voprosy Ist. 6 ('47) 94-I05. The author traces the efforts of Russian diplomacy from I78I to I785 to settle the Persian question as a part of the settlement of the whole Eastern problem. In the process it was planned by Russia to establish an Ar- menian state which, together with an "in- dependent" Georgia, would serve as a buffer against Turkey. France made dip- lomatic efforts to counteract the Russian moves. In I785 a change in the political set-up in the Caucasus forced the project to be shelved. I1I78 JAMES, SIR FREDERICK. "India: the transfer and after." Asiatic Rev. 43 (Jl '47) I93-202. A series of detailed pre- dictions of things to come, the most in- teresting being (i) many of the sched- uled castes will be tempted to improve their social and economic status by be- coming Moslems; (2) communal conflict will gradually diminish, but communism will gain in power.

Montagne brilliantly allalyzes the British plan for Near East stability, as detailed in the Chatham House report "British Security", concluding that</page><page sequence="6">BIBLIOGRAPI-Y lO9 it is contradictory and the difficulties in the way of fulfillment insurmountable. Particularly interesting is his explanation of the significant influence exerted on the formation of British policy by such "tech- nicians of local political action" as Freya Stark, Glubb, etc. II91 MURTY, P.

Rev. de la Mediterranee 4 (Jl-Ag '47) 436-65. Russia's history has been largely bound up with her relations with the peoples of the Orient. This fact plus her geographi- cal situation has been largely responsible for the early and sustained interest in Oriental studies. From I880-I920, many Russian scholars were the outstanding world authorities in the various disciplines. This excellent study details the pre-revo- lution history of Arabic and Islamic stud- ies, not only in the several universities and institutes, but in the ecclesiastical schools, museums, libraries, and the Academy of Sciences. 1377 RYCKMANS, G.
