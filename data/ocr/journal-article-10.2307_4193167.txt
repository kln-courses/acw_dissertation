<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME REFLECTIONS ON ANGELOMORPHIC HUMANITY TEXTS AMONG THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS CRISPIN H.T. FLETCHER-LOUIS University of Durham, UK Scholarly discussion of ancient Jewish angelology has, hitherto, largely assumed that angels are entirely suprahuman: angels are angels and men are men and each belong to a distinct order of being. In this respect discussion of angels among the Dead Sea Scrolls has reflected the wider discussion of the angelology of the period. It is generally recognised that humanity can share a community with angels (an En- gelgemeinschaft) and it is widely supposed that human life and reli- gious practice was thought at this time to mirror on earth the activity of the angels in heaven. Indeed, the communion between the righteous and the angels in the literature of the Qumran community is well- known and has been thoroughly investigated.' One feature of late second temple angelology that has only recently come to the fore in modem discussion is the way in which the right- eous are themselves regarded as angelic. Texts where humans are angelomorphic-angelic in status or nature, though without necessar- ily having their identity reduced to that of an angel-have been the subject of a flurry of studies in recent years, partly because of their potential significance for the understanding of early Christology.2 The principal purpose of this present article is to focus in particular on the I See, e.g., H.-W.

In doing so I return to a well-known Cave 1 text in which the high priest is compared to an angel (lQSb 4:24-28) and I also offer some fresh analysis of a recently released Cave 4 Moses text (4Q377). In several other places I have surveyed the evidence among the Scrolls for an angelomorphic portrayal of the righteous.3 For the purposes of this essay it is worth orienting our discussion with a cursory examination of those angelomorphic texts known to the Qumran community which will be relevant for our analysis of 4Q377 and IQSb. Pre-Qumran Angelomorphic Humanity Texts in the DSS Library Aside from those texts in the Hebrew Bible which already evince an interest in an angelomorphic understanding of kingship (e.g., 1 Sam. 29:9; 2 Sam. 14:17, 20; 19:17; Zech. 12:8 and cf. Ezek. 28:14, 16) the Qumran library contained a number of near non-sectarian composi- tions, known to be in use by non-Essene Jews, in which the righteous are described as angelic. In the zoomorphic allegory of 1 Enoch 89:1 Moses' transformation from a bull to a man represents his exaltation from the human to the angelic level of being.4 Such a transformation is spelt out in clearer terms by the priestly Sirach. The Greek transla- tor of Sir. 45:2 says that God "made [Moses] like unto the holy ones in glory (86di &amp;yiov), and made him great, to the terror of his ene- mies." We can be sure that the translator thought Moses had a specifically angelomorphic glory here because the Hebrew text (Geniza MS B) has the word D'fl'T where the Greek has "holy ones." Sirach is an important text for the understanding of Qumran literature since his priestly language and theology in many ways anticipates that of the community. Far more than Moses, Sirach is interested in the high priest. As C.T.R. Hayward has recently shown, the Hebrew author of the text describes Aaron in terms of the divine warrior.5 In Sir. 45:7 it is said of Aaron that God "girded him with I Luke-Acts, 185-98 and "4Q374: A Discourse on the Sinai Tradition: The Deifi- cation of Moses and Early Christology," DSD 3 (1996) 236-52, esp. 240-42. 4 The parallel transformation of Noah from a bull to a man in 1 Enoch 89:1 is miss- ing from the Qumran version of the Enoch collections (cf. 4QEne 4 i 13-14) pre- sumably because it conflicted with the tradition that Noah was born angelic further on in the Enochic corpus (1 Enoch 106). Noah's angelomorphic birth was evidently of some significance for the Qumran community, occupying cols 2-5 of the Genesis Apocryphon and evidently recorded in another Cave I text (1Q19). I C.T.R.

Again, the language of v. 8 echoes that used in the Psalms (esp. Ps. 29:1 and 97:6: "ascribe to the Lord glory and strength") for Israel's God.6 In this portrayal of the priest it is really unclear whether the epithet "angelomorphic" would do justice to the degree of exaltation in view: by virtue of his clothing (Exodus 28) Aaron is identified with Israel's one God. A similarly remarkable anthropology is developed in chap. 50 where Sirach pens a hymn in praise of the high priest Simon son of Onias. In Sir. 50:6-7 we are told Simon is: Like the morning star among the clouds, like the full moon at the festal season; Like the sun shining on the temple of the Most High, like the rainbow gleaming in splendid clouds. Whilst the astral language of v. 6 is broadly coterminous with an angelic identity-for "the morning star" compare Job 38:7-the sec- ond half of v. 7 portrays Simon in terms of the anthropomorphic form of God's Glory seated on the chariot throne in Ezek. 1:26-7. In Ezek. 1:28 this Glory is also "like the bow in a cloud on a rainy day."7 A, by comparison, more sombre account of the priestly vocation is given in Jub. 31:13-15 where Isaac blesses his grandson Levi: And he [Isaac] turned to Levi first and began to bless him first, and he said to him: "May the Lord of all, i.e., the Lord of all ages bless you and your sons in all ages. May the Lord give you and your seed very great g/Glory. May he make you and your seed draw near to him from all flesh to serve in his sanctuary as the angels of the presence and the holy ones. May your sons' seed be like them 6 The Greek text is different and some have doubted the authenticity of the Hebrew. For arguments in favour of the originality of the Hebrew see B.G. Wright, No Small Difference: Sirach's Relationship to Its Hebrew Parent Text (SBLSCS 26; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1989) 171-73 and Hayward, Jewish Temple, 65-66. 7 For a fuller discussion of the theological anthropology of Sirach 50, see M.

May he make them great in every age. And they will become judges and rulers and leaders of all of the seed of the sons of Jacob. Biblically, the closest parallel to this elevation of Levi to a service offered in God's sanctuary "as the angels of the presence and the holy ones" is Mal. 2:5-7 where the prophet proclaims that "the lips of the priest should guard knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the angel (messenger) of the Lord of hosts (tW.-I MnAM i7V7 JKtO) "8 Whatever Malachi meant by these words, the author of Jubilees has taken them as an unequivocal statement of the angelomorphism of the Levites in their worship.9 Again the theme of glory that we encountered in Sir. 45:2, 8 and 50:7 is present in this text. Although it is not explicitly stated whose glory Levi is to pos- sess, comparison with the Sirach passages would suggest both an angelic glory and that of God himself. The Divine and Angelic Humanity at Qumran Sirach and Jubilees are close literary relations of the Dead Sea Scroll texts, all being the product of a distinctively priestly scribal creativity. We should not be surprised, then, to find that the divine (or angelo- morphic) high priest and lawgiver is a picture that is developed in the Dead Sea Scroll corpus. And, indeed, we do discover close literary and conceptual parallels between Sirach 45, 50, Jubilees 31 and several Qumran texts. However, these views of Moses and the (high priest are representative of a wider phenomenon in the late second temple period.'0 Such a view of the high priest and Moses is also reflective of a more fundamental theological anthropology. Josephus says that Moses was a "divine man" (OFeio; &amp;vfip, Ant. 3:180) who was "ranked higher than his own (human) nature (TOv 6v8pCt 7CEItOifiKE T1 atXtTOi pUo KpEUttOVa voRieaOxt)" (Ant. 3:320). 8 For the inspiration from Malachi 2 for Jub. 31:13-17 see the various treatments of the latter text by J.C. VanderKam, "Jubilees and the Priestly Messiah of Qumran," RevQ 13 (1988) 353-65; The Book of Jubilees: Text and Translation (CSCO 510-1 1; Scriptores Aethiopici 87-88; Leuven: Peeters, 1989) 2.205; "Jubilees' Exegetical Creation of Levi the Priest," RevQ 17 (1996) 359-73 and "Isaac's Blessing of Levi and his Descendants in Jubilees 31," The Provo International Conference on the Dead Sea Scrolls (eds D.W. Parry and E. Ulrich; STDJ 30; Leiden: Brill, 1999) 497-519. 9 There is no warrant for a distinction between a functional ("serving as priests") and ontological ("being priests") interpretation of this text. '?

FLETCHER-LOUIS Josephus has not simply idealised the Jewish lawgiver as a distant hero of old. He says much the same thing of the Essenes as a whole in a somewhat neglected passage where he says that Herod the Great upheld a widespread popular view when he had "a higher opinion of them than was consistent with their merely human nature (ge6COV Tt (ppovCOV ei' aroi; Kat T OiTiv ip'otv)" (Ant. 15:372)." That this is, in fact, how the Qumran community saw themselves is confirmed by the Scrolls. It has long been recognised that in the Hodayot the righteous have been raised from the depths of human existence to the heavenly heights where they share the lot of the angels and experience the life of eternity, new creation, subsequent upon forgiveness of sins.'2 That the Qumran community members experience a specifically angelic life also appears now to be in view in 4QInstruction, otherwise known as 4QSapiential Work A, a text extant in at least six copies and evidently of some value to the move- ment as a whole because it is written for the laity as much as the priesthood.'3 In his recent discussion of this text D.J. Harrington has noted how a number of passages reflect the community's aspiration for the angelic life as "their ideal mode of existence on earth."' 4 In a closer analysis of a particularly difficult passage (4Q417 2 i 16-18 = 4Q418 43 13-14) J.J. Collins has argued that the statement that God "gave it [i.e., the Vision of Hagi and the Book of Remembrance] as an inheritance to Enosh [or, "man"] together with a people of spirit, for according to the pattern of his holy ones is his fashioning" should be taken to mean that the true humanity which follows the wisdom of the text is created in the image of the angels.'5 Collins further suggests that this view of humanity is derived from a reading of Genesis 1 I See also Ant. 19:345 where the people who acclaim Herod Agrippa I a god say that "yet henceforth we agree that you are more than mortal in your being (&amp;kXi toiv-TEWev KPEittOVa ae Ovnti; (PrOExS OgO&gt;YOUgEV)." 12 See, esp.

Ezek. 28:12-16). For the Dead Sea Scroll community, however, we can be sure that an angelo- morphic view of (the pre-lapsarian) Urmensch was related to a more exalted view of Adam as one created to bear God's Glory. In the first day's prayer for the weekly liturgy of the Words of the Heavenly Lights (4Q504, 506) there is a remarkable retelling of the creation story according to which Gen. 1:26, the creation of Adam "according to the likeness (nMIni:)" of God, is fused with Ezek. 1:28, where the anthropomorphic form of God occupying the throne in Ezekiel's vision is described as (mFri7' r 71 rn"D nerl). The result is a prayer of thanksgiving to God that he has created "Adam our falther, in the likeness of [your] Glory (in:]z1nl: nmrnnnl i 1n- 'u[t -n1)" (4Q504 8 recto 4). In another part of this liturgy it is Israel who recapitulates the true Adam as the bearer of God's Glory (frags 1-2 iii 2-4: "you have created us for your Glory [M)nfl - ?]"), over against the nations who are nothing but a manifestation of the tohu (wabohu) of the pre-creation chaos. If the Qumran community thinks of itself as the true Israel and true Adam, which is created to bear God's Glory it is not surprising that they should believe that, at times, their own identity is angelic. Whilst some have assumed that at Qumran there was a clear distinction between angels and humans,'7 there is enough here to suggest that a more flexible theological anthropology was acceptable. Indeed, a longer study would demonstrate the ubiquity of this view among the Dead Sea Scrolls. In the rest of this essay I confine myself to an examination of the Qumran view of the angelomorphic Moses and high priest. 16 For other interpretations of this difficult passage see, e.g., T. Elgvin, "The Mystery to Come: Early Essene Theology of Revelation," Qumran between the Old and New Testaments (eds F.H. Cryer and T.L.

FLETCHER-LOUIS An Angelomorphic Moses in Qumran Texts There are now extant a couple of texts in which Moses is angelic or divine: 4Q374 2 ii and 4Q377 1 recto ii. The first of these I have discussed in detail in an earlier article in this journal.'8 In 4Q374 2 ii, Exod. 7:1 ("See, I have made you [Moses] God to Pharaoh [o'r fl3Y r]") is expanded ("and he made him as God [vm"tR'] to the mighty ones and a and a cause of reeli[ng] to Pharaoh" (line 6) and then related to the glorious transformation of Moses at Sinai (Exod. 34:30).1' The statement in Exod. 34:30 that "when Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face was shining, and they were afraid to come near him" is developed in the lines that follow (lines 7-8). Moses is so transfigured that, like Aaron in Sir. 45:7-8, his effect on the people ("they melted and their hearts trembled and th[ei]r inward parts dissolved," line 7) is that of the biblical divine warrior (cf. Ps. 107:6-7). Such is his visual transformation that the people do not recognise him (line 9)-a tradition attested also in Pseudo-Philo's Bib. Ant. 12:1.20 Moses' shining face then restores them, in much the same way that an angel might restore any mortal overcome with the numinous power of its presence. Line 8 says, "and when he caused his face to shine upon them for healing, they strengthened [their] hearts." This is per- haps a deliberate evocation of Num. 6:25, that part of the Aaronic blessing where it is God himself who makes his own face shine upon the people for their well-being. If so, then God's face is now mirrored in Moses' face. The second Moses text is a poorly preserved manuscript written in Herodian script (4Q377 I recto ii). Sufficient text of the second col- umn of the recto can be made out for an angelomorphic Moses to be clearly read: 2. they understand the precepts of Moses 3. And he answered you [and] said: "Helar,] congregation of YHWH, and pay attention, all the assembly [ ] 4. to a[Il his] wor[ds] and [his] rulin[g]s. vacat Cursed is the man who does not stand (n103u') and keep and carry [out] Ix See Fletcher-Louis, "4Q374: A Discourse on the Sinai Tradition."

Like the deification of Moses in 4Q374 the scene is again Mt Sinai. In a patchwork of biblical language and allusions drawing on mate- rial in both Exodus and Deuteronomy the text describes the giving of the Torah through Moses' mediation.2' Moses' angelomorphism should not be limited to a functional similarity in speaking God's words. It is related specifically to his being covered by the theophanic cloud (Exod. 24:18; 33:7-11), which is therefore indicative of Moses' pecu- liar identity. The cloud reminds us of the angelomorphic "one like a son of man" in Dan. 7:13, the Glorious and theophanic high priest Simon in the clouds in Sir. 50:6 and, in particular, the transfigured Jesus who is in so many ways a new Moses (Mark 9:2-13 and paral- lels).22 Again Moses' being sanctified (inpil7, line 11) speaks of his peculiar identity and although this is not explicitly stated it probably has in view his becoming a "holy one (tp)" (cf. Sir. 45:2). Pressing beyond these cursory observations, however, the text raises questions and problems. (1) First, we are bound to ask whether the text has any literary coherence. Is the angelic description of Moses in any way integrated into its literary context? Is the text as a whole no more than a pastiche of biblical language, or does the choice and structure of biblical language serve any clear conceptual purpose? (2) Secondly, and as a specific instance of this literary question, it 2' For a thorough discussion see J. Zimmermann, Messianische Texte aus Qumran (WUNT 2.104; Tubingen: Mohr, 1998) 332-42. 22 See also 4Q369 I ii 8 and (the priestly) Enoch in I Enoch 14:8.</page><page sequence="9">300 CRISPIN H.T. FLETCHER-LOUIS is not clear who the subject of the standing in line 8 is meant to be.23 The immediately preceding subject of lines 5-7 is "the God of our fathers, who commanded us from the mountains of Sinai," who "has spoken with the assembly of Israel face to face" and who has ap- peared to Israel in a burning fire (lines 5b-6a). There is no grammat- ical indication of a change of subject at the beginning of line 8 ("And upon the earth he stood [-In l r- 1], on the mountain.. ."), but rather the last of a string of paratactic clauses sharing the same divine subject. The image of God standing on the mountain is unusual, though not entirely without precedent since in Exod. 17:6 God says to Moses: I will be standing (-nnS) there in front of you on the rock (nn) at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it, so that the people may drink. The reference to Horeb could be read as an account not simply of Moses striking the rock at Massah and Meribah (Exod. 17:7), but a forward glance to the theophany at Sinai, and it is noteworthy that rock language appears for God a couple of lines later in the Qumran text (line 8). However, there are good grounds for thinking that it is Moses, not God, who is described standing in line 8. From line 5 it is Moses who could be the subject not only of the phrase "who commanded us from the mountains of the Sinai" (5b-6a), but also the statement that "he stood on the mountain to teach...." Because this teacher teaches that there "is no God apart from him and no rock like him" this might imply that he is, in fact, someone other than God. That it is in fact Moses who is the one described as standing is further suggested by the fact that in lines 6-8 the text probably has in mind Deut. 5:4-6: The Lord spoke with you face to face (-nZ DI]= 0'!) at the mountain, out of the fire (0tvt1 flino). (At that time I [i.e., Moses] was standing between the Lord and you to declare to you the words of the Lord; for you were afraid because of the fire and did not go up the mountain). And he said: I am the Lord your God,... you shall have no other gods before me We can be fairly sure that lines 6-9 of 4Q377 1 recto ii are based directly upon Deut. 5:4-7 as the following examples show: A He has spoken (lf1) with the assembly of Israel face to face (~'t% a oD'e 0')E) (Deut. 5:4a), as a man speaks to his neighbour, (Exod. 33:1 1). B And as a man sees light he has caused us to see in a burning fire (OD: inrn.VD) (Deut. 5:4b, cf. Deut. 4:11; 5:23), C from above, from heaven, and on the earth he stood on the mountain (Deut. 5:5c) 23 As Zimmerman (Messianische Texte, 338) has noted.</page><page sequence="10">SOME REFLECTIONS ON ANGELOMORPHIC HUMANITY TEXTS 301 D to teach us that there is no God apart from him. (cf. Deut. 5:7: "you shall have no other gods before me" etc.) and no rock like him. E And all the assembly ... answered, and trembling seized them (Deut. 5:Sd: "for you were afraid") before the Glory of God (i.e., the fire of Deut. 5:5d?) and the wonderful thunders F and you stayed at a distance (Deut. 5:5d "and did not go up the mountain," cf. Exod. 20:18) Although the text does not cite Deuteronomy as though it were a pesher or some kind of midrash, that biblical text has provided the structure upon which all its parts are hung. The language of the Exodus version of the Sinai theophany has been introduced at a num- ber of points. There are several biblical passages where God speaks face to face with Moses (Exod. 33:11; Num. 12:8; Deut. 34:10), and the expression "speaking face to face as to a neighbour" (lines 6-7) comes specifically from Exod. 33:11. Lines 9b-lOa have come from Exod. 20:18: "When all the people witnessed the thunder (lnlprl) and lightning, the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking, they were afraid and trembled and stood at a distance (prfrn Ylwn1 ). '24 But otherwise the Exodus account of the Sinai theophany does not have the precise structure of these lines of the Qumran text. So if Deut. 5:4-6 has provided the literary and conceptual structure of the text then that would suggest that it is Moses' standing, not God's, that is in view since in Deut. 5:5 it specifically Moses who is said to stand. Furthermore, were our text interested in the standing of a human being rather than God this would cohere with two other instances of the use of the verb l7 ("to stand") in the immediate context. As we have just seen, line lOa refers to the assembly of the people standing at Sinai and line 4 would already appear to look forward to this scene when it says "cursed is the man who does not stand (nla') and keep and do... ."' Although the people trembled, they did not fall but remained standing. Whilst these two instances of the verb 'rrx do not necessi- tate a reference to Moses standing in line 8, they at least suggest that the standing theme is important for the text as a whole, which further accentuates the need for the interpreter to make sense of the ambigu- ity between God and Moses in the main body of the text. (3) Thirdly, another oddity arises from this latter problem. There is no doubt that line 6b cites the statement in Deut. 5:4 to the effect that God spoke intimately with the whole people of Israel at Sinai. Further, the introduction of the expression "as a man speaks to his neighbour" from Exod. 33:11 suggests that our author is reading Deuteronomy 24 The "burning fire" will have been introduced from Deut. 4:11 and 5:23.</page><page sequence="11">302 CRISPIN H.T. FLETCHER-LOUIS with one eye to Exodus. But it is precisely at this point that there is generally reckoned to be a tension between the two biblical Sinai accounts. Whilst Deuteronomy has direct contact between God and the peo- ple (cf. Deut. 4:12, 15, 32-33, 36; 5:19; 10:4), Exodus is quite clear that intimate communication between God and the people is reserved for Moses, whilst the people are kept at bay, unable to ascend the mountain let alone have communion with God "face to face," as do friends. Does the citation of Exod. 20:18 (cf. Exod. 19:16) in lines 9b-lOa mean that our author is oblivious to the differences between the two accounts? If not, how can he have the people both standing at a distance and interacting with God "face to face, as a friend to a neighbour"?25 In wrestling with these problems I suggest that each supplies the answer to the other and the author is deliberately, though somewhat allusively, combining different parts of the biblical text in order to resolve possible tensions inherent within it and in order to make a specific theological point. The distinction between God's standing and that of Moses is deliberately blurred because 4Q377 wants to say that in Moses' standing there is God's standing. This then facilitates a res- olution of any perceived tension between Deut. 5:4 and Exodus 19 because it also means that in Moses' speaking to the people, there is a mediation of God's speaking to the people face to face. As is per- haps the case in 4Q374, where Moses fulfils Num. 6:25, God's face is seen in Moses' face. What God has been to Moses, Moses is now to the people.26 On this reading, the statement in line 11 that Moses "spoke as an angel through his mouth" sums up the "argument" of the preceding section: because Moses is God's angel, his words are those of his master. Because Moses is shrouded by the cloud, his pres- ence is really God's presence. The people did not ascend the moun- tain, but, although they remained at a distance, they had a face-to-face encounter with God because in Moses' face they encountered God's face. As in 4Q374 frag. 2, the author perhaps here has in mind the shining of Moses' face in Exod. 34:30. 25 There are many ways in which the natural meaning of "face to face" in Deut. 5:4 can be avoided so as to pass over any tension with Exodus 19, as rabbinic tradition testifies (see, e.g., Pesiq. R. 21:6). But with the addition of "as a friend speaks to his neighbour," 4Q377 leaves no doubt that the communication between God and Israel is to be regarded as analogous to that between Moses and God. 26 Indeed, this way of resolving the perspectives of Deuteronomy and Exodus is perhaps anticipated by Deut. 5:5 itself which qualifies the direct contact between God and the people in the previous verse with reference to the mediation of Moses (cf. M. Weinfeld, Deuteronomy 1-11 [AB 5; New York: Doubleday, 1991]) 240.</page><page sequence="12">SOME REFLECTIONS ON ANGELOMORPHIC HUMANITY TEXTS 303 The description of Moses as an angel in the cloud may also be intended to align the lawgiver with the Angel of the LORD tradi- tion according to which Yahweh has an angelic persona which is a manifestation of his own being. As J. Fossum has shown, there is ample evidence within Samaritan tradition that Moses (or the Mosaic) prophet could be so identified with the Angel of the LORD.27 Already in the biblical text (Zech. 12:8) the Davidic king is aligned with the tradition of the Name-bearing angel attested in Exod. 23:20-21. In this case the people in 4Q377 will be like Gideon who saw "the angel of the LORD face to face" (Judg. 6:22). The suggestion that the ambivalence between God's standing and that of Moses is deliberate might receive specific support from the use of Deut. 5:5 in Philo, Samaritanism and proto-gnostic thought sur- rounding Simon Magus. Philo regards Moses' Deuteronomic stand- ing as an indication of his immortality.28 Fossum has pointed to the parallel phenomenon in Samaritan texts where Moses is known as "the (immutable) Standing One" (Memar Marqah 4:12), as was Simon Magus in Simonian gnosis (Pseudo-Clementine Homilies II 22:3-4; 24:6-27).29 In the Samaritan and the rabbinic traditions this standing posture is generally indicative of the angelic life.30 Such an interest in standing as a posture symbolising immutability is already attested in the second century BCE author Aristobulus (frag. 2 [Eusebius Praep. Evang. 8.9.38-8.10.17] 9-12) and so we can be sure it was an idea to which the author of 4Q377 was potentially exposed. One of Philo's treatments of this theme, in fact, deserves to be cited in full since it offers a number of intriguing parallels to the Qumran text. In the second volume of his work On Dreams 2:221-30, Philo writes: "Here I stand there before you, on the rock in Horeb" (Exod. 17:6), which means, "this I, the manifest, Who am here, am there also, am everywhere, for I have filled all things. I stand ever the same immutable, before you or anything that exists came into being, established on the topmost and most ancient source of 27 J.

And Moses too gives his testimony to the unchangeableness of the deity when he says "they saw the place where the God of Israel stood (0TAKCeI)" (Exod. 24:1 0),1' for by the stand- ing or establishment he indicates his immutability. But indeed so vast in its excess is the stability of the Deity that He imparts to chosen natures a share of His steadfastness to be their richest possession. For instance, He says of His covenant (tLa%xn) filled with His bounties, the highest law (vo6go;) and princi- ple, that is, which rules existent things, that this god-like image shall be firmly planted with the righteous soul as its pedestal32. .. And it is the earnest desire of all the God-beloved to fly from the stormy waters of engrossing business with its perpetual turmoil of surge and billow, and anchor in the calm safe shelter of virtue's roadsteads. See what is said of wise Abraham, how he was "standing in front of God" (Gen. 18:22), for when should we expect a mind to stand and no longer sway as on the balance save when it is opposite God, seeing and being seen?... To Moses, too, this divine command was given: "Stand here with me" (Deut. 5:31), and this brings out both the points suggested above, namely the unswerving quality of the man of worth, and the absolute stability of Him that IS. For that which draws near to God enters into affinity with what is, and through that immutability becomes self standing.... Thus he [i.e., Moses] says: "And I stood between the Lord and you" (Deut. 5:5), where he does not mean that he stood firm upon his feet, but wishes to indicate that the mind of the Sage, released from storms and wars, with calm still weather and profound peace around it, is superior to men, but less than God.... The good man indeed is on the border-line, so that we may say, quite properly, that he is neither God nor man, but bounded at either end by the two, by mortality because of his manhood, by incorruption because of his virtue.3 There are enough parallels between Philo's discussion here and our Qumran text for us to wonder whether he is reliant on something like the latter. Like Philo, 4Q377 is working with Deut. 5:5, the giving of the Torah, and perhaps Exod. 17:6. Both texts think standing is a pos- ture indicative of a transcendent identity in which the righteous can participate and of which Moses is the pre-eminent example. With the stability of standing is contrasted the corruptibility of motion, turmoil and storms, which is perhaps reflected in the tension between Israel's "standing" (lines 4 and 10) and her "trembling" (line 9) before the Glory of God in the Qumran text. Whether this and other similar pas- sages in Philo (cf. esp. Sacr. 8-10; Post. 27-29) are genetically related to 4Q377 is not certain, but remains a possibility. There is nothing specifically Essene or sectarian in this text. Indeed the freedom with which the divine Name is used points away from 3' Here Philo is reliant on his Septuagint, since the Hebrew lacks any reference to God's "standing." 32 This difficult image is then supported and developed through a citation of Gen. 9:11. 31 Modified from Philo V (trans F.H.

However, it is perfectly consistent with the Essene veneration of Moses and belief in his suprahuman identity. It is quite possibly both pre-Qumranic and the original possession of a wider movement, perhaps the Hasidim of 1 Macc. 2:42; 7:14 and 2 Macc. 14:6, from which Essenism may have emerged.34 If the reading of 4Q377 suggested here is on the mark then this Qumran text would confirm Fossum's contention that here, as elsewhere, Philo, Samaritan theology and early gnostic thought derives from an older "orthodox" Jewish milieu in which Moses is regarded as an angelic or divine being.35 According to Josephus the Essenes held Moses in high regard, judg- ing any slander of the lawgiver as tantamount to blasphemy (War 2:145; cf. 2:152). Such a high regard for Moses in the Qumran com- munity is now reflected in these two texts (4Q374 and 4Q377): it is easy to appreciate how, if Moses is regarded as C1m5tR and a 7xtm, slandering him might be tantamount to blasphemy (cf. esp. Exod. 22:28). Indeed, it is possible that lines 4b-6a of the 4Q377 fragment, "cursed is the man who does not... keep and carry out... all the laws of YHWH by the mouth of Moses his anointed one" reflects the embracing of God's principal mediator under the prohibition of blasphemy. The Angelomorphic and Glorious Priesthood at Qumran As we have seen in the pre-Qumran- material Sirach and Jubilees the priesthood figures prominently as the angelomorphic bearer of God's Glory. In as much as the priesthood represents the people and at Qumran it is the people themselves who are bearers of God's Glory (4Q504), it is hardly surprising that this Glory should be intensified in those who mediate between God and his people. Given the character- isation of the priesthood in the Hebrew of Sir. 45:7-8; 50:7 and Jub. 31:14-15 on the one hand, and the priestly orientation of the Qumran community on the other, it is hardly surprising that this theme is developed in Qumran literature. Indeed, some important connections between these texts and those from the caves examined thus far present themselves. The way in 3 Cf. Zimmermann, Messianische Texte, 341-42. 3. It is worth noting the way in which the ability to stand before God is related to worthiness and immortality in the Hodayot (see IQHa 12:21-22 [4:20-21]; 18:11 [10:9]; 20:30 [12:27]).</page><page sequence="15">306 CRISPIN H.T. FLETCHER-LOUIS which the priest acts as divine warrior in Sir. 45:7-8 is taken up by Moses in 4Q374. The theme of g/Glory in both Sirach and Jubilees recurs in the anthropology of the Words of the Heavenly Lights. In particular the way in which the creation of Adam is fused with the vision of God's anthropomorphic form in Ezek. 1:26-28 has an impor- tant precursor in Sir. 50:7 where the high priest is described in terms of Ezek. 1:28. That there is some liturgical and conceptual connection between the two passages is highly likely given that, as C.T.R. Hay- ward has shown, in Sir. 49:16-50:1 Simon the high priest himself is set up as the true, or second, Adam, uniquely bearing the first Adam's beauty.36 There are now a number of instances where texts peculiar to the Qumran library evince the belief that the priests in general, and the high priesthood in particular, are angelomorphic or divine. 4Q511 (Songs of the Sage) frag. 35 describes the community's priesthood as the holiest of the holy ones (cf. I QS 8:5-6, 8-9; 4QMMT B 76-79) who have been separated by God in order to be "an everlasting sanc- tuary" (line 3). As such they shall be "priests, his righteous people, his host and servants, angels of his glory (line 4: IC! l DM ) n'flD rnn: Drz: Unmvm)).37 In general terms this reflects the angelomor- phic priesthood tradition established in earlier texts. Once more the language is doxological. To call the human priesthood God's "host," that body of heavenly beings that accompanies the divine warrior, is to generalise from the characterisation of Aaron as the divine warrior (Sir. 45:7-8) to the priesthood as a whole. To describe the angelo- morphic priesthood as "servants" is in accord with Jub. 31:14 where the Levites are "to serve" in God's sanctuary as the angels of the pres- ence. Whereas in Jubilees, Levi is to serve "in his sanctuary," now in 4Q511 35 the priests are themselves to be that sanctuary. Again the designation of the priesthood as super-sanctified holy ones reflects an intensification of the older tradition according to which the angelomorphic priests serve as holy ones (Jub. 31:14). Elsewhere, I have attempted to show that this understanding of the human priesthood at Qumran is present in a thoroughgoing liturgical form in the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice, where, contrary to the con- sensus among modern interpreters, it is the human worshippers, not suprahuman angels, who are the elohim, (angelomorphic) ministers, 36 Hayward, Jewish Temple, 44-46. -1 For a justification of this translation and a rejection of others see Fletcher-Louis, Luke-Acts, 190-92.</page><page sequence="16">SOME REFLECTIONS ON ANGELOMORPHIC HUMANITY TEXTS 307 priests, chiefs, and the like.38 This priestly self-perception is also reflected in a number of more fragmentary Qumran texts. For exam- ple, since a passing comment by J.T. Milik first introduced the text, a fragment of 4Q543 (4QVisions of Amram), which says, "you will be God (or, "a god") and an angel of God you will be ca[lIed (mnn tA mrpJnn btR JRml has been read as an address to Aaron.39 This is possible, since the text may be part of a visionary Testament of Am- ram (4Q543 1 1-4 = 4Q545 1 i 1-4 = 4Q546 1 1-3) when a predic- tion of Aaron's ordination to a new office would be a fitting moment for him to receive a heavenly title. Also worth noting is 4QTLevid 9 i, a passage which has been much discussed for its possible use of the Suffering Servant song of Isaiah 53 to describe a heavenly high priest. Whether or not Isaiah 53 has contributed to the depiction of this high priest's suffering he is indisputably heavenly since "his word is like the word of the heavens" and "his eternal sun will shine; and its fire will burn in all the comers of the earth.. ." (lines 3-4). The one Qumran text that is without a doubt a description of an angelomorphic priesthood is IQSb 4:23-28 which reads as follows: 'u03 (24) nr - nn r ,:... n:[. 7-I]m] n:nvi o'i-ip vi-n nttvl (23) ji.uo n'in st0n_- (25) rintv in-u-i wtn[ ...]n 1-r -i -: m*in 5m nsYu niD5rz (26) 5D,nm n-iom n,,no ri[n ... nijs::; nEt -nnzDb o-ip K,D nzo nq,? or:n u nu [5 . .. ] -n, nxvi c')e mv5 DD n): t'Dni n,-nr tnn [...] -nxn', 1imv [v]nip nDr'u' iDo[o 'iD n:J (27) 1MD:nI * 7[upn inMM] .':) O'D-np 1 rnp', -M [...] (28) =-I 'D -rnKn~ I'Vn1PI Inv (23) and to raise up at the head of the holy ones, and your people to ble[ss...] yourl... .]brt in your hand (24) the men of God's council and not by the hand of a prince yd[.... by each man for his fellow.

FLETCHER-LOUIS Opinions as to whether this blessing was already in use for the Qumran Community are divided. In the light of the texts already dis- cussed, however, there is no reason to think that its distinctively angelomorphic understanding of the priesthood is the product of a future transcendent eschatology: even if this blessing was reserved for the future, that future is a thoroughly this-worldly, historical one, and, in any case, this priest's vocation is for the most part a reflection of texts where there is no doubt that the angelomorphism of the priest- hood already serving is in view. In particular, we may discern here the influence of the ordination of the Levites to their angelomorphic priesthood in Jubilees 31. Like the angelomorphic Levites in Jubilees the priest in IQSb is to serve in God's sanctuary (esp. lines 25, 28) as "an angel of the face (or, 'presence')." Both passages emphasise the themes of glory and holi- ness. In Jub. 31:15 Levi is to bless all the seed of the beloved, pre- sumably with the Aaronic blessing of Num. 6:22-27. lQSb 4:23 may also refer to the high priest's role as blesser of his people, though the context is broken.40 Num. 6:22-26 plays a pivotal role in the rest of the Blessings Scroll as it does in other DSS texts.4' Several commen- tators have also seen the influence of Num. 6:25 "May the Lord make his face to shine upon you, and be gracious to you" on line 27 where the priest himself is "to give light [ ] for the world in knowledge and to illuminate the face of the Many."42 Both statements of the priesthood's angelomorphism are also made in blessings upon the priesthood: in Jubilees 31 Isaac blesses Levi, whilst in 1QSb the maskil blesses the high priest (see ':Izv7 in 1:1; 3:22; 5:20). In Jubilees 31 the blessing of Levi precedes that of Judah (18-20), just as in lQSb the blessing of the high priest (4:24-28) pre- cedes the blessing of the (royal) prince of the congregation (5:20-29). In 4:28 the priest is to glorify God's Name. There are only a few bib- Ruprecht, 1994) 85-87. Beyer's reconstruction is used in F. Garcia Martinez and E.J.C.

The high priest here is both functionally and ontologically angelic. In line 26 he is to "cast lot with the angels of the presence." In the context of the Rule Scroll (lQS-IQSa-lQSb) this casting of lots should probably be understood in relation to the covenant renewal cer- emony (1QS 1:18-2:26) and the Two Spirits discourse (IQS 3:13- 4:26), where the Priests' and Levites' blessing and cursing ensures the wicked are assigned to their lot (2:17) and the righteous within the community are placed in theirs (2:23), in a way that reflects the divi- nely ordained cosmic dualism between the sons of light and the sons of darkness in their respective lots (see esp. 4:26). As the cultic representative of the sons of light, the priest, perhaps echoing the role of the prince of lights (lQS 3:20, cf. 3:24), is to give light to the righteous. If Num. 6:25 is in the background in line 27 then it is as though God's shining of his face has been delegated to the priest. This would then pick up the two Moses texts already discussed, where, in each case, there is the impression that Moses' face is God's own face. Indeed, in 4Q374 2 ii 8 we have already seen how Num. 6:25 has contributed to a statement of human divinity in this way. In this light to say that the priest is as "an angel of the face" is to say that he himself is to bear something of God's own face and, therefore, his presence. Divine embodiment comes more prominently to the fore in line 28 where the high priest is to glorify God's Name and his holiness. What does this mean exactly? This language is easily given an entirely tran- sitive sense: the high priest glorifies God by praising him verbally or otherwise directing the people's attention to him. However, numerous considerations must mean that in this text the verb "to glorify" carries a certain reflexive sense: the high priest is to glorify God's Name by virtue of the fact that he embodies it and gives it substantial pres- ence-real presence-within the community. The context makes no mention of the high priest verbally praising God and so it is unlikely 43 Cf. the psalmist in Ps. 86:12, the nations in Ps. 86:9 and God giving glory to his own name in Ps. 115:1. The glorious nature of God's name is widespread (e.g., Ps. 66:2; 72:19; 96:18; Neh. 9:5).</page><page sequence="19">310 CRISPIN H.T. FLETCHER-LOUIS that his giving Glory to God's Name is meant in that sense. We have already seen how in Sirach 50 the high priest embodies the Glory of God and how Jubilees 31 and the Words of the Heavenly Lights again take up this rhetoric of Glory. When in Sir. 50:11 it says that Simon "glorified (1nT1,7r E80taacv) the court of the sanctuary" it means that by his presence (and his action) he filled the sanctuary with God's own Glory. The force is probably similar in our text. In lQSb 4:28 there is a reference to "a diadem (rnT) for the holy of holies.""" This must be a reference to the holy diadem (V7pfl ntM) worn by the high priest according to Exod. 29:6; 39:30 and Lev. 8:9. A ref- erence to this diadem is highly fitting in the context given that the high priest is to glorify God's Name and it is upon this diadem that the Name is inscribed. When the text refers to "a diadem for the holy of holies" it must be talking about the high priest who alone enters the innermost sanctuary (cf. m. Yoma 5:1-4; 7:4).45 Whilst some translators have recognised the reference in line 28 to this diadem, there seems to be a temptation to take the meaning meta- phorically and restore "may he make you] a diadem of holy of holies."46 I see no reason for this non-literal reading. Rather, I would suggest that lines 26-28 as a whole are concerned first and foremost with the high priest's garments and their theological and cosmological func- tions. Whilst line 28 is devoted to the diadem bearing the divine Name, lines 26-27 are interested in the breastpiece of judgement and the Urim and Thummim. This is most clearly seen in the priest's role as the giver of light in line 27, since the Urim and Thummim car- ried or worn by the high priest are almost universally interpreted in the late and post-biblical period as a light-giving oracle, by virtue of the (perceived) etymology of the word Urim (D'nt4) from the root -nt1, "light." It is not clear exactly how this light-giving oracle was be- lieved to work, but certainly at Qumran, for Josephus and for other Jews, the Urim and Thummim were somehow identified with the stones of the high priest's breastpiece (Exod. 28:9-30).4' That breast- Milik rightly perceived that -nt is a distinct and separate word.

The reference to the high priest casting @trB) lot in line 26 may also anticipate the Urim and Thummim language in line 27. In 1 Sam. 14:40-42 Saul casts (*lDn) lots to discover the source of sin within the Israelite camp.48 The Septuagint, which perhaps preserves the original and fuller form of the text, understands this lot-taking as inquiring of the Urim and Thummim. Indeed, modern scholarship has regularly ventured a psephomantic interpretation of the Urim and Thummim. So, in this blessing the statement that the high priest is to be as an angel of the presence is followed by a focus on two of the most important aspects of the high priest's garb; his gem-studded breast- piece and his headgear bearing God's Name. All this is important because it strengthens our conviction that in line 28 the glorification of God's Name is by virtue of the high priest acting as the real pres- ence for the Glory of the Name: this real presence is expressed in terms of sacred clothing and its various theophanic functions. The high priest brings Glory to God's Name by virtue of his capacity as bearer of that Name and its visible manifestation. It is worth contrasting this with what is said about the prince in col. 5. In 5:28 it is said God "will strengthen you [i.e., the prince] with his Holy Name (7m7= 10Vl;M mon)." Whereas the high priest acts for the Name of God as the one who gives it Glory, the prince is passive in as much as he is a recipient of the Name's power. Presumably, also, this difference reflects the liturgical and theocratic relationship be- tween the two, with the high priest acting as the divine mediator and guide for the king: to say that God will strengthen the royal leader with his Holy Name, is to make him a subordinate recipient of the high priest as one who manifests that Name both liturgically and, in particular, through the juridicial or salvific power of the Urim and Thummim. Although the blessing of the high priest in lQSb belongs in a par- ticular literary trajectory of priestly ideology which is anticipated in witnesses C. van Dam, The Urim and Thummim: An Old Testament Means of Revelation (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1993). 48 See the discussion of this passage in van Dam, The Urim and Thummim, 194- 214.</page><page sequence="21">312 CRISPIN H.T. FLETCHER-LOUIS one proto-Essene text (Jubilees 31), its view of the angelomorphic priesthood in IQSb is reflective of a wider late second temple prac- tice and belief. It seems, in fact, to have been a widely held belief that by virtue of his glorious garments and the light-giving stones Israel's chief priest was an otherworldly being. The Letter of Aristeas 97-99 describes the high priest as follows: On his breast he wears what is called the "oracle," to which are attached "twelve stones" of different kinds, set in gold, giving the names of the patriarchs in what was the original order, each stone flashing its own natural distinctive colour- quite indescribable. Upon his head he has what is called the "tiara," and upon this the inimitable "mitre," the hallowed diadem having in relief, in the middle of the forehead, in holy letters on a golden leaf the Name of God, the fulfilment of Glory [8o?ti (some MSS: 86on) ncnXnpwgEvovj.... Their appearance makes one awestruck and dumfounded: a man would think he [either the high priest or the viewer] had come out of this world into another one (i1Si a0p.p6vEta toi)xcOV ?UnOtEl cOp71oV Kal tapaXI'Jv, irTE VogtiEIV it; ETEpOV iXUX)0Evat iKTO; TOD KOgOt)). The language is not identical, which is not surprising given the dif- ference in genre and audience (Aristeas is written for a Hellenized readership), but the basic ideology is the same. As in lQSb 4 it is the oracular, refulgent breastpiece, and the Name-bearing tiara which is distinctive of the high priest. With the statement in difficult Greek that the high priest's garments, in particular the diadem bearing the Name, are the "fulfilment of Glory" we should compare the equally pregnant language of 1QSb 4:28 where the high priest is to "make Glorious (God's) Name." Where Aristeas speaks of the wearer of these garments in terms of the other-worldly, there can be little doubt that he has trans- lated the angelomorphism of the Qumran text into terms suitable for his Hellenistic readership.</page></plain_text>
