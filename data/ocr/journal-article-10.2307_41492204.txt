<plain_text><page sequence="1">The "PALANG", its History and Proto-History in West Borneo and the Philippines by Tom Harrisson This somewhat complex theme has involved extensive and at times faintly esoteric research over a wide area. Most of the information now to be pre- sented is either new or has Iain unnoticed (even deliberately hidden) for a long time. The present paper reviews some of the more relevant literature and folk- lore for west Borneo (where the palang is a living reality) and the sexually linked Philippines. Later, the author will deal with related island data east- ward through Kalimantan and Celebes to Malekula in Melanesia; parallels back into prehistory on the Asian mainland; fieldnotes on modern practices, physical and cultural implications, based on direct observations in Sarawak, Kalimantan and lately also in the Philippines. For despite both deliberate suppression and a more vague "conspiracy of silence," this type of sexual device has antiquity, persistence and indeed power over a wider area than is generally appreciated; it has even spread inside Borneo during the past fifteen years. Introduction I have elsewhere defined the palang in the following terms: a cross-piece driven through the male penis .... The basic opera- tion simply consists of driving a hole through the distei end of the penis; sometimes, for the determined, two [or more] holes at right angles. In this hole a small tube of bone, bamboo or other material can be kept, so that the hole does not grow over and close. It is of no inconvenience once the initial pain of the operation - always done by experts from the lowlands - has been overcome. When the device is put into use, the owner adds whatever he prefers to elaborate and accentuate its intention. A lively range of objects can be so employed - from pig s bristles and bamboo shavings to pieces of metal, seeds, beads and broken glass. The effect, of course, is to enlarge the diameter of the male organ inside the female. And so to produce accentuated points of mobile friction. ( World Within , London, 1959, 59-62). In west Borneo, the palang today exists among Kayan, Kenyah, Kelabit, Iban 162</page><page sequence="2">Part 2, 1964. The "Palan g" in W. Borneo and the Philippines and some other groups, with an erratic distribution. For the Kelabit, how- ever, the palang is a recent innovation; for the Sarawak Iban, relatively so. I have here chosen the term palang as the most widespread of the in- digenous Bornean terms ( cf. utang , etc. ) and also the one known over parts of the outside world. "Penis-pin" is a term sometimes used but inadequate. "Penis-bar" is only slightly more suitable, but not fully comprehensive. This is not, in fact, a device which lends itself readily to western classification, any more than to Saxon practice. It has to be faced that the subject matter, whlie grotesque and even disgusting to some, is one which has for centuries been taken for granted as a proper part in living among some of the liveliest people in Borneo, the Kayans, Kenyahs and others subsequently influenced by them. And equally so in the beginnings of known history amongst millions of the inhabitants of the Philippines. Largely because of past reticence this is one of the features of South- east Asian ethnology of which we remain most completely ignorant. The literature is light. The normal approach is well signified in that invaluable compendium The People of Sarawak and British North Borneo, published at the ripe height of Victorian English prudery (1896). As author H. Ling Roth put it there, KAYAN MUTILATION Particulars of the Kayan sexual mutilation have been deposited in the British Museum ( Op.cit , 11:81). Subsequent correspondence with the British Museum authorities in 1961- 1963 failed to produce these particulars. Some early West Borneo references One of the best early references is in the remarkable paper by Robert Burns ( grandson of the poet ) based on his pioneer expedition into the Kayan interior of Sarawak. I have previously discussed Burns' work - before he came to a sticky finish, beheaded by pirates - in some detail and have re- printed his notes in full; here is the relevant passage, from field observations of 1847, The above cited various customs are common to other tribes of Borneo and also to other countries, but in the extraordinary custom universally adopted by the male Kayans, they differ from all other tribes of the Archipelago . It is said, however, that a like custom is practised by some 163</page><page sequence="3">Tom Harrisson JMBRAS, VoL 37 of the inhabitants of the west coast of South America. On males arriv- ing at the age of puberty or more commonly before marriage, the Utang is adopted and without this marriage does not take place. It consists of a round pin (frequently two or three ) of wood, bone, brass or gold, about an eighth of an inch in diameter passed horizontally through the gland of the generative organ, and projects about a quarter of an inch on each side; when more man one is used they are placed transversely. ТЪе Utang is adopted through all the divisions of the Kayan tribe, but with its purpose or origin they appear to be unacquainted. (S.AÍ.J.*, V, 1951, 3:451-486). The practice was also earlier mentioned for the Kayans in south-east Borneo (Kalimantan) by Dalton (cf. Moors Notices of the Indian Archipe- lago). The other great early explorer of west Borneo (Sarawak), Spenser St. John, writing in 1863, elaborated on Dalton, while deliberately disregard- ing the account of Burns - for personal and political reasons which I have made clear in the article cited (SM J., V, 1951,3). St. John, who saw much of the Sarawak Kayans, wrote, [Dalton] was disbelieved by many at the time, but it is undoubtedly true: the rich men using gold, tne poorer silver, bones of birds, and even hard wood. The doctor of the Semiramis steamer carefully examined a great number of Kayans, and expressed his astonishment that no injury resulted from this extraordinary practice. A German missionary has accused the Southern Kayans of certain gross usages, but I heard nothing of them, and do not credit his account - his mistakes arising, most probably, from his want of knowledge of the language. ( Life in the Forests of the Far East, London, 1863,1:122) Since the middle of the last century the serious literature of the palang has been feeble - and most of it is misleading, presented as semi-erotic. For instance, the description of palang penetration by blowpipe given in a sensational book called The Children of Lilith by Lui Piazzini, translated from the French and published in London by Hodder and Stoughton, 1959 (p. 177). On the other hand, the spoken folklore, the proto-history of the palang, , is rich. The Kayan Root? It is not my intention at this stage to attempt a deeper analysis of how and why the palang developed and became popular in Borneo (and elsewhere). For the immediate purpose, it is safest to take the people nowadays called Kayans and some of the Kenyahs closely associated with them as the main west Borneo palang users in proto-historical times. In regard to prehistory, we have one indication of early use in the Niah caves; but this is so far no * Sarawak Museum Journal, new series, 1949. 164</page><page sequence="4">Part 2, 1964. The "Palang" in W. Borneo and the Philippines more than an indication and cannot be taken as proven. Offsetting this, none of the early rock paintings (at Niah and nearer Kuching) and none of the prehistorical megalithic rock carvings ( in the Kelabit uplands and the Sara- wak River delta) show any palang hints - for what little this is worth as negative evidence (cf. Iban textiles below). The popular Kayan "explanation" of the palang is usually in the form of a secular story with a logical cause and even a ridiculous undertone. Here is the version most recently (1961) heard from one of our most scholar- ly and reliable Kayan informants in the Belaga district - in his recorded (translated) words: At one time a number of girls slept together, naked. As they slept, a dog came and saw them all naked. The dog licked the parts of one of them which she (the girl) felt most sensitively. She rose up to see the dog standing nearby. She drove it away. Shortly afterwards the dog came again, the same girl asked it to lick her again and again. She found tnis so enjoyable, she did not tell it to any of her friends. While she was sitting alone in the house next morning, the same dog came again. She dragged its head to lick her. The dog refused. A day later, as she slept at day time, the same dog came in. She dragged its head to lick her again. The dog turned its head away. As a result, she began to think of the sensitive feeling, while being licked by the dog two days before. As she thought over the matter seriously, she went out of the house to collect leaf, which she rolled and put very carefully into her. When she had done this, she felt the effect. She did this daily in the loft of the house. When someone called her to ask what she was doing, she simply sstid she was busy. One day when she put the leaf in, two girls peeped through at her, to see what she was up to. They then asked Tier why she was doing this thing. She shamefully told them that, by doing so, she got a very sensi- tive feeling. She also explained she must do it regularly, everyday. The two girls asked her more about the actual feeling. She assured them it was wonderful, beyond description. On hearing this the two girls each put a leaf in for themselves. As they felt the effect, they agreed. From that day on, these three girls habitually put in leaf. After some years in the habit of doing this, they fell in love. One night, as a young man was having intercourse with One of them, the girl told the young man that his action was no better than being driven with a leaf! 165</page><page sequence="5">Tom Harrisson JMBRAS, VoL 37 The complaint of the girl upset the young man. He said he had treated his other girl friends in tne same way, in the past, without com- plaint. The young man was thoroughly ashamed of the girl's words. In the morning he thought it over carefully. Finally he decided the only way to please her was to place something at the tip of his own organ. He went into the nearby forest, in due course, and made a tiny hole, to pierce a rod through it! After he had fixed this at the tip, he had further intercourse with her. Now she said she was very satisfied indeed. It is due to this that the palang ever came to being among us Kayans. Iban and other "borrowing" inside Borneo It is too difficult to believe that the inland Kayan of protohistorical times invented the palang independently from others using similar devices else- where in Asia. The ancestors of these early Bornean peoples who took to the far interior of the Apo Kayan and adjacent uplands carried on an older tradition, which had earlier reached the west coast of Borneo and the Bisaya stock around and behind Brunei Bay. During this century, the palang has become best known as a speciality of the Iban (Sea) Dayaks. Recent medical information for Sarawak (vari- ous doctors to the author, 1956-63)) shows that quite a high proportion of elderly Iban males do have palang now; and that numerically they were the most frequent palang carriers in west Borneo in the past decade. Yet Ibans at all levels strongly deny any credit for invention or origin. This reminds one of the way the English attribute rubber sexual devices used by their men to the French, and by women to the Dutchl The usual Iban story quotes the same version of the Kayan tale already cited, but goes on to be more specific about how the young male made up for his deficiencies. For instance, in a Balleh version (1962), a girl drew the attention of her boy to the spikes on the baong fish. Unanimously Ibans claim that it is only since the recent north-west expansion of the Ibans up the Rejang and else- where in present-day Sarawak, and the pacification of the Kayans and Ken- yahs into friendly neighbours (sometimes intermarrying with Ibans), that the palang has become known to them. It should here be added that most modern opinion is strongly opposed to the device among Ibans. Despite help from the late Mr. George Jamuh, Mr. Benedict Sandin and others, I have not been able to find any relevant satisfactory "old Iban" folk- lore. The attribution to others is indirectly strengthened, a*beit again only negatively, by the notable absence of palang themes in the earlier examples 166</page><page sequence="6">Part 2, 1964. The "Palang" in W. Borneo and the Philippines of traditional Iban ikat textiles, preserved in the Sarawak Museum and else- where. In particular the large series of Iban ikat and other woven materials collected by the late Professor A. C. Haddon F.R.S., in Sarawak before 1899, or photographed then by him in the Sarawak Museum collections (many since lost during the Japanese occupation ) does not show the palang theme. This is fully illustrated by Dr. Haddon and L. E. Start. Iban or Sea Dayak Fabrics and their Patterns (Cambridge, 1936), where the only approach to anything of the kind is a curiously organed "anthropomorph" (fig.20, at p. 40) which is said by the authors to show a manang ("witch-doctor9), who acts as a woman. Yet in modern Iban ikat , the palang is one of the common themes, both in symbolic and in directly representational form. The Kelabits of the northern Sarawak (and north-western Kalimantan) uplands equally attribute the palang to Kayan and ( in their case ) more parti- cularly Kenyah influence from the Bahau branch of the Apo Kayan, which border on the northern edges of the Kelabit country (see map in Geo graphi- cal Journal , 114, 1949: 129; also G.J . 125, 1959: 302 and 1964, in press). Until fifty years ago, outsiders who penetrated the Kelabit uplands were normally either enslaved or killed on the spot. There was a strong prohibi- tion on sexual intercourse with outsiders; they were a people who preferred themselves to trade outwards - carrying 'their' naturally iodised springsalt, damar and tobacco over mountain passes which the uninitiated could not find from outside. But after the first Brooke officer, R. Douglas, at last pene- trated the area in 1911, this position rapidly changed. At the long-house of Pa Main the story tells how, about 1925, a party of visiting Kenyahs from the Bahau River arrived to barter for salt ( main means salt, and several of the many upland salt springs are there, though the best are over in the headwaters of the Kerayan across the Kalimantan border). An aristocrat Kenyah youth was accepted for the night by the daughter of the Kelabit chief. She enjoyed the experience. But next day she died of an internal haemorrhage. At that time, the Kelabits were (they claim) not really aware oř the palang and its implications, although the Ken- yahs are about the least secretive of Borneans regarding their "private parts" ( they are "modest," by western standards, but other groups are almost obsess- ively so). Indeed, it was this tragedy, not at orice linked by effect to cause, which helped start an awareness leading later to the introduction of the apparatus among a small minority of Kelabits themselves. By 1945, it had become the fashion for the more enterprising of the Kelabit upper-class aristocracy to have the palang operation done on visits 167</page><page sequence="7">Tom Harrisson JMBRAS, Voi. 37 to the riveline lowland Kenyahs and Kayans. Thus the quotation from World Within with which I opened this discussion. Early Literature from the Philippines The first European chronicler of the Philippines ( and Borneo ) was Anto- nio Pigafetta, who accompanied Magellan on the first circumnavigation of our world. In 1521 A.D., of the island of Segbu (= Cebu ) and the people called Sugbuhanon (- Cebuanos = Visayans etc.), he wrote, These people go naked, wearing only one piece of palm cloth over their privies [literally, "over their shame"]. ( The males ), large and small, have pierced their member near the head from one side to the other with a device of gold or of tin as large as a goose quill; and on one end and on the other of the same device, some have what resembles a star with point at the end; and others tne head of a cart nail. I often asked many, both old and young, to see their penis, because I could not believe it. In the middle of the device is a hole through which they urinate. The device and star always stay firm. They say that their women want it this way and that if they did otherwise would not copulate with them. When the men wish to copulate with their women, they themselves in- sert not in the usual way, but very slowly they begin to put it inside, first the (one) star on top and then the other. When it is inside it takes the usual position; and thus it always stays inside until it becomes soft, because otherwise they cannot pull it out. These people use this because they are of a weak nature.* Writing about 1582 for the "Pintados" of the Bisayan Island (probably the modern Hiligaynon people) Miguel de Loarca observed (my italics), They have a very abominable custpm, ( in that) they have the genital member pierced; and through the hole they put a dowell of tin on which they put a ring like a spur, which is a large palmo in circumference and which, some of them, are more than half a libra of tin. They use twenty kinds; to discuss them would be immodest. With these they copulate with their women. The people of the mountains, however , do not use * For assistance with this and the following translations I am indebted to a leading Philip- pine scholar who wishes (for private reasons) to remain anonymous. The present texts are based on, but do not necessarily correspond exactly with, the standard and normally most acceptable translations by Emma H. Blair and James H. Robertson in their great The Philippine Islands : 1493-1898 (Cleveland, Ohio, 1903-9J. There the character of the paíang has not always been understood and the resulting English consequently unclear. The present item is from the Blair and Robertson Spanish original of Piga- fetta's "Primo Viaggo Intorno al Mondo;" Ambrosiana m.s. (in В &amp; R, XXX, 171, 173)» during which he later gives the first written account of Borneo (Brunei) - though he did not note the palang there. West Borneo's early European literature is much poorer than for the Philippines; refer- ences in early Chinese and other texts are often obscure topographically and in other vital respects. 168</page><page sequence="8">Part 2, 1964. The "Palang" in W. Borneo and the Philippines them . Yet all generally circumcise themselves; they say that they do it for their health and cleanliness NN (" Rebecion de las Islas Filipinias," Panay, 1582; Blair &amp; Robertson , V, 116). Similarly in 1578, Diego Lope Povedano, in "The Ancient Legends and Stories of the Indios jfarayas, Jiguesinas and Igneines which Contain their Beliefs and Superstitions * (reproduced by Rebecca P. Ignacio, The Pove- dano Manuscript of 1578 , Philippine Studies Program, University of Chicago, 1954), In the house of a chief in my encomienda named Manapula my curiosity was aroused when my eyes beheld some rings which were tied with a string. These were or flattened metal about a palm in cir- cumference, which were hanging near the place where they retire. These rings had holes in the middle and were as big as Spanish gold coins. He told me that these articles were called duguan. My interpreter, having afterwards conversed with the chief, told me that they used them during the act of fornication so that they may not be like pigs, dirtied in the act (op. cit, pp. 39-40). Povedano's encomienda (right to collect tribute) was apparently held over the rivers and villages of Inabangan and Adelinte, with their uplands, on the Hiligaynon-speaking part of Negros. Over the same period, the Englishman, Francis Prettys, record of his journeys in the southern Philippines is more readily available through the Hakluyt text of 1927, as, "The admirable and prosperous voyage of the Worshipfull Master Thomas Candish (Cavendish) of Trimley in the Countie of Suffolke Esquire, into the South Sea, and from thence round about the circumference of the whole earth begun in the years of our Lord 1586, and finished 1588," (in Richard Hakluyt, The Principal Navigations Voyages Trafiques &amp; Discoveries of the English Nation . . ., London, 1927, VIII, p. 242). We roade for the space of nine dayes about this island of Capul .... These people use a strange kinde of order among them, which is this. Every man and man-chilae among them hath a nayle of Tynne thrust quite through the head of his private part, being split in the lower ende and rivetted, and on the head of the nayle is as it were a crowne: which is driven through their privities when they be yong, and the place grow- eth up againe, without any great paine to the child: and they take this nayle out and in, as occasion serveth: and for the truth thereof we our selves have taken one of these nayles from a sonne of one of the kings which was of the age of 10 yeares, who did wear the same in his privie member. This custome was granted at the request of the women of the countrey, who finding their men to be given tp the fowle sinne of Sodomie, desired 169</page><page sequence="9">Tom Harrisson JMBRAS, VoL 37 some remedie against that mischiefe, and obtained this before named of the magistrates. Moreover all the males are circumcised, having the foreskinne of their flesh cut away .... Finally, in 1609 the Spanish Historian Antonio de Morga commented, in his Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas , Mexico, 1609 (here translated from the Retina edition published in Madrid, 1910; cf. Blair &amp; Robertson, XVI, 130): The natives of the Pintados Islands [the Visayan Islânds], especially the women, are very licentious and sensual; and the wickedest among them, the women and the men, have discovered lewd ways of copulat- ing. From childhood, they become accustomed to one way: the males cleverly make a hole in their virile member at the end, ana they insert into it a small head of snake or of metal, or of ivory; and they pass a peg of the same through the hole so that it cannot come out. With this device, they copulate with women, without being able to withdraw for a long time after. They are addicted to and delight in this method; for although they shed much blood and receive other injuries, they ignore them. These devices are called sagras; and there are very few (left), because now that they are becoming Christians, care is taken to get rid of ( such ) and not to let them use them, so that ( this practice ) has been remedied to a great extent. The variety of these clearly more or less authentic and usually "eye wit- ness" accounts further indicate the range, - both geographical (including Panay, Negros, Bohol, Cebu, Minadanao and Leyte) and technical, - of palang - type devices in the Philippines four centuries ago, long before any detailed historical records are available for west Borneo. The general tenor of the Philippine historical evidence is towards placing such devices mainly in the south and among the coast-dweJers rather than among inland peoples. This could in pact be tied up with those pre-Spanish cultural movements from Borneo which have been the subject of extensive reports in a series of previous S.M.J, issues (S.M.J., 1954-60). In particular, early European descriptions should be read in conjunction with the two Maragtas bamboo texts published, and with Mr. John Carroll's long analysis of proto- historical links between the Bisayas and related peoples of north-west Borneo, and those of the Visayan island in the southern Philippines (S.AÍ.J., IX, 1960, 15); this may be taken more broadly in context with my general survey of North Borneo Bisayas in the Journal of Sabah Society (Jesselton, 1962). The only known early Philippine illustration Through the courtesy of Professor Charles Boxer, I have been able to examine his famed "Boxer Codex," (cf J.R.A.S., 1950: 37-49), with its beau- tiful gilt-inset marginal drawing in the original text, of a Philippine palang, 170</page><page sequence="10">Borneo P alang types in the author's Collection.</page><page sequence="11">Facsimile Page from the "Boxer Codex", 1590; Palang to left (in gilt on original) I1 ¿Wteffy fa mãúínkaqttti ¿^¿tie ce^Ljlfìb** te&amp;t'Crû §^4$Ьл /î* jto i O ftVHÍfn. /л^«Х ùe^a *J" t &lt; ¿tí» .(jíl V« j m ňW/Wfi* &gt;0^ШШУ; **$ à h eut пес ÇúJ '• l^á^OlTÍ't^fÁí^'rteMi /&gt;«' ¿¿Л . н, __ ,*iV&gt; J W Л'Мм 'q ^'jkírw f^řío £yH W &lt; ni rt * ť w£/fci5j ¿^mutft iff*y rt% Л n j í) J Ö // &lt;.|1&lt;/*rrv/p./&lt;t nt4Mrtn&lt;q««&gt;q4Ä ^йД£^^(М^^ЛалА7 3x&gt; i^ipá^míí« •?* f/řru . tt iW&gt;c^4*J|^ itr« ?tá w* п}ща/.*/*2 J-í/rt feři, «&gt; f M&lt;V- &lt;у'"С"ЧОДЧ*£ ti&gt;no^%jn¿0 I P jjfa«- &lt;%# Г^г?

Borneo and the Philippines of the "star' or wheel type described by several early authors. This part of the Codex, which probably dates to 1590, has been discussed and translated by my friends Carlos Quirino and Mauro Garcia ( Philippines Journal of Science , 87, 1958, 4: 325-449). It is about the most important Spanish account of Philippine native life in general and the Bisayas in particular, to survive from the sixteenth century. Drs. Quirino and Garcia also produce the illustrations, though rather inadequately ( poor reproduction ) . I had already deduced that their Plate 16, which is from a photostat of the palang - bearing page in the original text, was misleading - owing to a fold line obscuring the general effect. I asked Charles Boxer to allow me to study the orginal; after doing so, I further asked him to be so kind as to have a new photo made (here reproduced). The translated text at this point in the Code is particularly informative (Quirino and Garcia text): Finally, in the sin of the flesh, they are used to a thing which is the newest and never hitherto seen nor heard - which seems to be the guide to vice and bestiality that they have in this particular. The men com- monly place on their genital member and ordinarily carry in it a certain wheel or ring with round spurs in the form (drawn) on this margin, which they make of lead or brass and some of gold. They have holes in the round part of the wheel or ring, one in the upper and the other in the lower part; through which they put a small pin or nail of the same metal as the ring, and with which they pierce the lower part of the prepuce, and thus the wheel or ring is placed on the very genital in the same way that a ring is put on the finger. Thus they have access with the women, with whom they remain for a day or a night in the way dogs do a similar act, after completing which they remain immensely satisfied, specially the women. Some wheels or rings are very large, there being more than 30 kinds, each with a different name, and in general a name sacred in their language. The Spaniards have had special care after coming among these people to abolish this abominable and bestial custom among the natives, punishing with beatings those who wear them, and in spite of this they continue to wear them and make them; and it is very common for them to carry the comb or nail which enters through the holes of the wheel or ring, and placing ( the nail ) in the member of the man continuously therein, so that the hole may not close or in order not to be bothered with the time in putting the ring or wheel - a custom invented by the devil so that men may offend more with this vice our Lord God. This wheel bar type was clearly not the only one in use in the Philip- pines some 400 years ago; as other accounts (however incomplete) show ( Povedano s "hygiene rings" from the island of Papos particularly relate here ), nor is any such circular solid device in use now in Borneo, where the re- markable range of palang technique includes quite elaborate appendices equiv- alent to the Boxer drawing, but not a complete "ring" round the outside of 171</page><page sequence="13">Tom Harrisson JMBRAS, VoL 37 the penis, inserted with the ordinary (for Borneo) cross-bar. However, it is noteworthy that some observe the courtesies by forgoing the palang as an operation , but fitting a circle of stiff wire or other material over the head of the penis - with the wire ends protruding at two or four points (see 2 lower items in Plate). It is far from unlikely that more formal "ring types* of palang did occur in Borneo in the past - a subject to which we must return in connection with palang surgery in a later article. An Ancient Chinese Connection? The best attested link is, indeed, with the interesting penis ring of ancient China - whence so much influence was exercised upon Bornean culture, at least as far back as thirteen centuries ago. What is known of those devices in China has recently and admirably been summarised by the former Netherlands Ambassador to the Federation of Malaya ( His Excellency, Dr. R. H. van Gulik). These include winding a silk band tightly round the penis base before the sexual act; attaching a white band soaked in a so-far- unidentified "medicine," yao-chu po-tai-tsu (possibly birds nest gelatine); and the use of a jade ring kept in place by a silk band, passing between the legs and then fastened round the waist. His Excellency, in his Sexual Life in Ancient China (Leiden, 1961) illustrates his own collected specimen of a similar ring made in ivory (his Plate XV), decorated with the traditional theme of dragons contesting "the pearl that shines in the dark," yeh-ming-chu, a "fertility symbol" commonly found also on valued small Chinese pots in the Borneo interior. Such aids are well documented in early Ming literature, when Chinese influence still remained strong in northern Sarawak, Brunei and Sabah, as well as the southern Philippines - the Chinese traders not only bringing many things and ideas but taking others back to China. Much of early Chinese "SexualisnT at the "cult" level has earlier roots and was, in important respects, strong under the Mongol Khans in the Yuan dynasty (1279-1367 A.D.), when contact with Borneo extended widely and deeply. The Mongols glorified "Female Energy." Kublai Khan surround- ed himself with Tantric Buddhists who developed certain aspects of sex to an astonishingly public degree. The dynastic history of the period describes some of the palace? rituals in detail, including the dance of sixteen concubines with "eight males," pa-lang - the females naked but holding "cups made of human skulls ( Kapala )." Dr. van Gulik, although the foremost linguist and scholar in this field, is frankly puzzled by terminology and procedure at this point, and has two successive footnotes stating that he cannot "trace 172</page><page sequence="14">Part 2, 1964. The "Palang" in W. Borneo and the Philippines the term pa-lang, eight males" (his subsequent attempt to explain the mean- ing is - as he admits - barely plausible). He further notes (referring to a second account, 14th century), "Whereas the description stresses the Tantric character of the dance, it gives no information about the pa-lang " (p. 260). While it would be impertinent indeed for me to enter into the field of Chinese linguistics, I do notice in another footnote on the same page, His Excellency states that two other puzzled western scholars have sought Mongol readings for some of this texts terms. And while I am one of the last to favour "word games" in the chaotic etymology of Southeast Asia, yet the possibility that these Yuan rites reflect some other element and are connected in symbolic language, might deserve the further attention of my scholastic betters. I have recently discussed this problem in some detail with Dr. van Gulik himself; we may be able to get fresh further light in the future. Meanwhile, with his permission, I re-print here the most relevant passage of his recent book ( Sexual Life in Ancient China , 1961: 260), "He (i.e. Ha-ma) also presented the Emperor (i.e. Hui-tsung, 1333-1367 A.D.) the Tibetan monk Ka-lin-chen, who was an expert in the secret (Tantric) ritual. That monk said to the Emperor: 'Your Majesty rules over all the .Empire, and owns all riches within the four seas. But Your Majesty should not think of this life only. Man's life is brief, therefore this secret method of the Supreme Joy (that ensures longevity) should be practised.' The Emperor thereupon practised this method, which is called "Discipline in Paris". It is also called yen-ťieh-erh , and "secret." All these practices refer to the Art of the Bea-chamber. The Emperor then summoned Indian monks to direct those ceremonies, and conferred upon a Tibetan monk the title of Ta-yuan-kuo-shih, "Master of the Great Yuan Empire." They all took girls of good families, some four, some three, for these disciplines and called mat "to sacrifice" (kung-yang). Then the Emperor daily engaged in these practices, assembling for the purpose great numbers of women and girls, and found his joy only in this dissolute pleasure. He also selected a number from among his con- cubines and made them perform the Dance of the Sixteen Dakini and the Eight Males.* The brothers of the Emperor and those men who are called "Companions" all engaged in front of the Emperor in these lewd embraces, men and women being naked. The hall where these things took place was called Chieh-chi-tvu-kai , which means in Chinese "Every- thing without obstacle." Ruler and statesmen thus displayed their lewa- ness, and the crowd of monks went in and out of the Palace, and were allowed to do anything they liked." A good deal in Bornean sex and associated rites, especially among the * Pa-lang. 173</page><page sequence="15">Tom Harrisson JMBRAS, Voi. 37 peoples of the islands north-west, links back into the great Tantric develop- ments of this period, imprinted at third hand and in some ways heavily "secularised" by the time they reached far inside Borneo. But to pursue this further at present would be to go ahead of the demonstrated data in such an especially intricate, intimate, ethnologically difficult field.
