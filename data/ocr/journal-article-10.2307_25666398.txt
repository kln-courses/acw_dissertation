Conner Abstract Pictograph panels in central Mon tana reported containing masked an thropomorphic figures with symbolic arms and geometric chest designs; shield-bearing-anthropomorphic fig ures in panel with horse. Distribu tion of characteristics set forth. Possibly artists identified. Con clude that shield-bearing-anthropo morphic motif survived introduction of horses on Plains. The Fish Creek Pictograph Site Introduction The Fish Creek Pictograph site, 24 WL401, consists of 2 panels of painted pictographs about 65 feet apart on sand stone, rimrock cliffs on the east side of Fish Creek in Wheatland County, Mon tana. The locale is rolling prairie coun try in the drainage of the Musselshell River. While the landowner, Lester T. (Ted) Cavill, has known of the site since 1913, the first known attempt to record the site was made in the summer of 1959 byHarlinH. Lucas, of Harlowton, Mon tana, who learned of the site from Ted Cavill, and the writer. The pictographs are situated in the S 1/2 NW 1/4 of sec tion 24, township 6 north, range 18 east of Montana Principal Meridian. The panels appear just above the talus at the base of the rimrock cliffs. Arrows point to the location of the 2 panels in Figure 3A. Fish Creek is at the base of the talus along the cliffs. Method of Inscription No pecking or rubbed grooves appear in either panel. The figures in both panels are drawn with lines the width of a man's finger. With the exception of the 6 dots in the southern panel, the paint throughout is a dull, now faded, red. Southern Panel Figure 3C is a scale drawing of the southern panel made by tracing enlarged photographs. A few inches at the left end of the panel have been eroded by water dripping down the face of the cliff. The figures in the panel are between 7 and 8 1/2 feet above the present ground level and occupy approximately 4 feet between lateral extremities. The southern panel faces west and is generally exposed to the prevailing wind and weather although receiving some pro tection from a slight overhang of the cliff. The panel consists of the following fig ures and designs: (1) the silhouettes of 2 human right hands measuring 5 inches from heel to finger tip; (2) three simi lar anthropomorphic figures side by side having snouts, animal-like ears, mus taches or beards, square torsos, symbo lic arms shown by solidly colored cir cles at shoulders, legs with pants-rolled up effect below which protrude stem-like legs, feet shown as inverted "T's1', an arrow shaft butt protruding downward from the lower left corner of each figures1 torso, similar but not identical designs on torsos consisting of short horizontal, parallel lines, circles, a rec tangle and a T, oblique and vertical lines depending from round and football-shaped eyes, hair bristles on head, bodies shown full view with heads in profile; (3) a skirted anthropomorphic creature with simi-circular protrusions at its knees, legs in profile, headdress sloping to one side with tassel hanging from its top, symbolic arms shown by outlined circles at the shoulders, "L" shaped feet, facial features represented by one circle only, there being no design on the body; (4) an anthropomorphic representation with 24</page><page sequence="2">25 buffalo-like horns, rectangular body, slightly sloping, squared shoulders, no legs, no nose, eyes and mouth shown as circles, hair bristles on head, fingers outstretched on one hand with only thumb and 3 fingers shown. The figure holds in its left hand an object which consists of a generally horizontal line bending toward the ground at its outer extremity and from which depend short, parallel lines like the teeth of a lawn rake. The object terminates in an indistinct figure somewhat resembling a fish; (5) a de sign above the horned figure appears to be a bow with a somewhat similar curved object against it. The other object has no bow string and its ends look like har poon points; (6) between the central and southern snouted figures are 6 dots, each approximately the width of a finger, ar ranged in 2 horizontal lines of 3 each. The pigment in these dots is a brighter, more orange hue than the paint used in the other figures in both panels. The snouted figures average 12 inches from head to toe and their torsos aver age 6 inches in width. The other figures in the southern panel are a little smaller. Figure is a photograph of the southern panel. Northern Panel Erosion has nearly obliterated the northern panel except for a drawing which is on a horizontal surface and therefore well protected. Two faint figures are barely visible on the vertical face of the cliff. All that can be seen of one are shoulders that slope downward medially, solidly colored circles for arms, and parallel sides. The other dim figure is the head and upper torso of a snouted figure with bulges at the neck similar to those in Figure 3C.These dim figures were reported by Maynard Shumate (Shumate 1960:11-14). Addition ally, there are parallel smear marks where\ the artist apparently wiped 4 fingers in several places upon the cliff. The horizontal surface upon which the painting is drawn is approximately 7 1/2 feet above the present ground level and well protected from the prevailing weather. The figure is a snouted head bearing much resemblance to the snout ed figures in the southern panel. The snout, eyes, ears, as well as the hair lines on top of the heads are similar in the 2 panels while the protrusions on the throat and back of the neck are some what similar to the hair-like designs on the back of the heads and necks of the 3 snouted figures in the southern panel. The figure in the northern panel is about 3 times as large as the heads of the southern panel figures, and the end of the nose of the figures in the northern panel is represented by a circle as in the case of the 3 snouted figures in the southern panel. However, the end of the nose has been eroded because of an imperfection in the surface of the sand stone, and the edge of the imperfection, an irregular dark band, should not be confused with the end of the nose. Distribution of Characteristics Hand Imprint The imprint of the human hand with fingers outstretched is a common motif in aboriginal paintings of central Mon tana, appearing with other figures or simply as a series of hand prints. The hand print is so common in Indian pic ture writing as to require no further enumeration of examples, except to men tion that it occurs in Fremont picto graphs (Taylor 1957:80). Horned Headdress The writer has also observed several anthropomorphic designs with horned headdresses in the Plains area of Mon tana. Taylor and Wormington both men tion horned headdresses among charac teristics of the Fremont culture picto graphs in the Fremont sites (Worming ton 1955:176). Neck Portrayal of the neck as the same width as the head appears on page 130 of Mulloy*s publication and at a Fremont culture site (42Gr275) in Utah, although the Utah figure is more than life size and colored solidly rather than merely a line drawing (Gunnerson 1957:75).</page><page sequence="3">26 Rake-like and Fish-like Objects No other example of the object held in the horned figure's left hand is known, but Gunnerson mentions one Fremont pictograph, not portrayed in the publi cation, in which the left arm of an anthro pomorphic figure terminates in a rake like extension. The 2 designs may be similar (Gunnerson 1957:43, site 42Un76). Bow The design above the object held by the horned figure resembles an Indian bow. No other designs of this precise nature are known to the writer. Arrows fre quently appear in Montana pictographs; Pictograph Cave had several pictures of bows and arrows (Mulloy 1958:130, 133), minus the extras which had been added to the bow in the Fish Creek picture. Perhaps something entirely different than a bow was intended, or possibly the accessories are feathers, wings, or other decorations. Snouted Anthropomorphic Figures The snout which is so prominent in both the northern and southern panels appears in no other aboriginal picture writing known to the writer. The leg and foot styles of the. 3 snouted figures in the southern panel, as well as the geo metric designs on the torsos, the ear style, the indications of a mustache or beard, and the hair on back of head or neck are peculiar to this site. The head and skirt styles of the knobby kneed anthropomorphic figure likewise are not known to have been utilized elsewhere, although the"L" shaped feet are common. Eyes Mulloy reports oblique or vertical lines depending from the eyes to be com mon in the central Yellowstone country, the next drainage south. He also cites locations in Colorado, Utah, Oregon, and California where the technique was uti lized (Mulloy 1958: 123, 127, 130). Wormington shows 2 pictograph panels from Dry Fork Canyon near Vernal, Utah, which have oblique lines depend ing from eyes of human representations. She adds that lines below the eyes sug gest Fremont work (Wormington 1955: 144, 145, 174). Knees Projections at the knees, designated as knobby knees, appeared at Pictograph Cave, but there the anthropomorphic figures with knobby knees were solidly painted so that the knees appeared to be autochthonous rather than outline addi tions as in the case of the knobby kneed figure at Fish Creek (Mulloy 1958: 126, 128). The knobby kneed figures of Picto graph Cave are all shield-bear ing warriors. Arms A motif known only at this site and the Grinnvoll Rock Shelter Pictograph site reported below is that of arms represent ed by circles at the shoulders. Prehistoric Population The MacHaffie site 100 miles to the west, near Helena, Montana, revealed Folsom and Scottsbluff cultures; and the top layers of excavation disclosed arti facts resembling Signal Butte 11 (Forbis and Sperry 1952:131). Pictograph Cave, approximately 60 miles to the southeast, was occupied more or less continually from about 1000 B.C. (Mulloy 1958:220). The Hagen site near Glendive, Montana, 240 miles to the east, may have been a late prehistoric Crow or Hidatsa site (Mulloy 1942). Mulloy described a num ber of later aboriginal sites in southern Montana in his publication on Pictograph Cave (Mulloy 1958), and an earlier camp site near Red Lodge, Montana, with material culture much like the earlier stages of Pictograph Cave (Mulloy 1943: 179). Malouf has stated that the Flat head (Salish), Pend d' Orielle (Kalispel) and the Kutenai Indian tribes were living east of the continental divide before his toric times (Malouf 1957a: 101). The site is about 150 miles east of the conti nental divide. It is also possible that the Kiowa and the Athabascans, such as the Apache and Navaho, dwelled in Montana in earlier times (Malouf 1957a: 101).</page><page sequence="4">27 Historic Aboriginal Population Both Piegan Blackfeet and Crow tribes are known to have visited the Musselshell River valley, and both tribes probably claimed the area at various times in the early and mid 1800's. (Ewers 1958:41, 46, 50, 53, 54, 60; Schultz 1907: 19, 21, 71, 86, 197; Grinnell 1961: 84; Malouf 1957a:104; Malouf 1957b:41; Denig 1961: 139; Hewes 1948: 50, 51; Hodge 1907: 367, 368; Nelson 1942: 266; Mathews 1877: 39; Mulloy 1942; Bradley 1896: 177). Other Montana Plains tribes include the following: Atsina (also called Gros Ventres, but not to be confused with the Hidatsa who were likewise known as Gros Ventres) who were only a couple of days ride on horseback to the northeast (Malouf 1957a: 419, 106, 107; Malouf 1957b: 41, 49; DeVotol953: 419; Ewers 1958: 60; Schultz 1907: 21, 52, 197; Assiniboine (sometimes called Stonies), who lived east of the Atsina and probably within 2 or 3 days ride of the pictographs (Malouf 1957a: 41, 49; Malouf 1957b: 104, 107, 108; Ewers 1958: 51, 60; Schultz 1907: 206); the Northern Cheyenne whose territory was about the same distance but to the southeast (Malouf 1957a: 104, 107; Malouf 1957b: 41, 48, 49; Vestal 1934: 172); Sitting Bull1 s Hunkpapa Sioux band controlled the Yellowstone River south and east of the site in the 1870's before the Battle of the Little Big Horn, and is known to have traveled the Mussel shell River (Vestal 1934: 159, 168, 178). A number of the tribes from the moun tain country of Western Montana and Ida ho occasionally visited the south-central Montana Plains country in small groups or as tribes. Spring and autumn buffalo hunts on the Plains attracted the Nez Perce (DeVoto 1953: 419, 420), Flathead Salish (Malouf 1957b: 41, 44; Abbot 1939: 35), Shoshoni (Abbott 1939: 35; Malouf 1957b: 41, 45, 46, 47), and Bannock (Replogle 1956: 35), from the mountain country to the west. The Musselshell county was good buffalo country (Nels Voldseth - interview by the writer September, 1959) as was the country to the north, east^and south. The Shoshoni may have had a free run of south-central Montana in earlier times. While no references have been found in support, the Kutenai and Pend d1 Oreille (Kalispel) tribes lived in western Montana and could also easily have traveled to the locale of the site of buffalo hunts. The Nez Perce also made rendevous with the Crows in 1873 on the Yellowstone River about 75 miles to the southeast (Vestal 1934: 172). In 1877 the band under Chief Joseph must have passed close to the site on its way to defeat in the Bearpaw Mountains. Between 1860 and 1880 the mixed blood peoples referred to locally as the Red River half-breeds arrived in Montana. These people were a mixture of Cree, Chippewa (Ojibway), and French and are sometimes called the Metis (Malouf 1957 b: 50; Dusenberry 1958: 26 et seq.). Most of these groups settled in northern Montana, but a few took up residence in Wheatland County (statement of Rene La brie to writer, 1960). The Canadian Red River half-breeds occasionally traded with the Sioux on the latter's home ground in the 1860's and early 1870's and their route might have been near the site (Vestal 1934: 235). FACTORS IN INTERPRETATION Paint The paint used at the Fish Creek site in the 6 dots (Fig. 3 C) differs from the paint in the other figures, and therefore may not be contemporaneous with the latter. The orange hue of the dots is similar to the paint used in Owl Canyon Pictograph and in the Dale Western Pictograph site in Musselshell County, Montana. The dull, faded red paint appears to be of the same composition as most of the older paints in Pictograph Cave in Yellowstone County, Montana, which Mul loy described as a hematite mixture (Mulloy 1958: 118). The finger marks on the cliff at the northern panel leave little question as to the nature of the paint ap plicator used. Comparison with Fremont Culture Pictographs One of the important factors noted in connection with the Fish Creek picto graphs is the similarity to pictographs attributed to the Fremont culture in Utah.</page><page sequence="5">28 There are, however, a number of points of dissimilarity. Wormington lists characteristics of Fremont pictographs as follows: trape zoidal bodied anthropomorphic figures; curved projections from head which often resemble horns; decoration on chests; fingers often outspread; some figures with crownlike headdresses reminiscent of feather headgear found in Castle Park and the Fremont area; human figures carrying what appear to be human heads; human figures carrying large circular or oval shields with designs, some with horned or antenna-like headdresses; circles with designs which probably represent shields; animals, mountain sheep, and deer most common; hunters with bows (Wormington 1955: 176). Taylor lists diagnostic characteristics of Fremont pictographs observed by him as trapezoidal anthropomorphic figures, costumed men with elaborate horned headdresses, shield-like devices, animals and snakes (Taylor 1957: 126). Gunnerson speaks of Fremont anthro pomorphic designs as square shouldered (Gunnerson 1957:43). Gunnerson (1957: 75) has a photograph of site 42Gr275 showing a pictograph panel of a row of similar anthropomorphic figures side by side. The middle figure resembles the Fish Creek horned figure in style of head dress, head, neck, torso, shoulders, but is completely colored and not just outlined as at Fish Creek. It is a little larger than human life size. It is to be noted that the Fremont pictographs also have panels in which similar anthropo morphic figures are drawn side by side (Taylor 1957:80). There are notable variations in tech nique between the Fremont and Fish Creek styles. Several of the common Fremont characteristics do not show up in the Fish Creek panels, just as they do not all show up in any one Fremont panel. Some obvious points of dissimilarity are the following: 1. Leg styles. 2. Feet styles. 3. Size of anthropomorphic fig ures, Fremont being closer to life size; Fish Creek, about one foot. 4. While chest designs often ap pear in Fremont drawings, none have come to the atten tion of the writer that are similar to those on the 3 an thropomorphic figures side by side in the southern panel. (Of course chest designs do not appear on all Fish Creek human representations or on all Fremont anthropomorphic figures). 5. Arm styles, in that the sym bolic arms are not character istic of Fremont panels. 6. Headdress styles, although some Fremont figures ap parently have the buffalo horn style found in one Fish Creek figure. 7. No trapezoidal bodies appear at Fish Creek. 8. The snouted, animal-eared heads peculiar to Fish Creek do not appear in the Fremont sites. The Fremont culture existed in Utah and northwestern Colorado for not less than 250 years terminating before 1200 A.D., but may have developed as early as 500 A.D. The Fremont culture pro bably grew out of the generalized culture of the Great Basin, the earlier manifes tations of which are referred to as the Desert culture (Taylor 1957: 146-148; Gunnerson I960: 377, 378; Wormington 1955: 176 et seq. ). Fish-like Object One representation often used for rain or snow by Plains Indians was a horizon tal line from which short, parallel lines depended like the teeth of a rake. The object held in the left hand of the horned figure at Fish Creek is such a design. At first glance it reminded the writer of a fish. While the Fremont people were hunters and agriculturists, fish hooks found at Fremont sites suggested to Wormington some dependence on fishing. (Wormington 1955: 173). The curve of the rake-like object and the fish-like ob ject at the end do resemble a fish on a fishing pole. However, Thomas F. Kehoe, Curator</page><page sequence="6">29 of Archaeology of the Saskatchewan Museum of Natural History, reminded the writer that the Plains Indians have traditionally disliked fish and fish eaters. Certainly no representations of fish are known to the writer in pictographs in the Plains area of Montana. Hand Imprints The hand imprints - both right hands - suggest the probability of a true hand im print rather than a hand being outlined and colored in. The size of the hand im print is that of a 6 to 8 year old child rather than the usual adult,male -sized hand prints in Montana pictographs. Based upon (assumed) relationship with sign language, the significance of the human hand imprint differed with the several Plains Indian tribes. Sometimes in sign language it meant "do" or "did" or signified action. Among several Indian tribes a black hand meant the wearer had killed an enemy. The Hidat sa and Arikara used it to show bravery. To some Sioux a red hand meant the wearer had been wounded, and a black hand that the wearer had slain an enemy. A red hand across the mouth meant the wearer had tasted the lifeblood of a foe to some Arikara. To the Teton Dakota, a hand signified the wearer had engaged in a hand to hand struggle with an enemy (Mallery 1888-1889: 711). Snouted Heads and Chest Designs The more arresting feature of the Fish Creek pictographs is the snouted heads motif. The literature disclosed nothing similar had been found elsewhere in the Plains. The particular chest de signs, too, are apparently peculiar to this location. All the snouted figures were drawn with a precision lacking in other known Montana pictographs. These pictures may have been closely related to the ,Kmedicine" or religion of the artist. The heads may represent masks; the chest designs seem to adhere to a well defined plan. Kehoe hypothesized that the snouted figures might represent a cult or cult dance. The uniform appearance of the 3 figures side by side certainly sug gests an organizational influence;and the minor differences in chest designs may indicate individuality which would allow each his own separate identification or medicine. Dating Factors No information is available to the wri ter which makes dating possible. Only a few broad suggestions can be made and some questions raised. It would seem the artist intended to show a bow in the southern panel, and there can be no mistaking the arrow shafts protruding from the 3 figures. This at least dates the drawing after the adoption of bow and arrow. The effect of legs with pants-rolled-up is so striking and such a departure from the bare-legged anthropomorphic figures normally pictured that it is impossible to overlook the idea that the artist intended to convey that precise effect although the 3 snouted figures do contain much of the symbolic. The pants-rolled-up effect suggests to some degree that the artist was intimately familiar with white men's trousers. If the indistinct figure at the end of the rake-like object is a fish, 3 alternatives are suggested: (1) the pictographs pre date the Plains Indian;(2) the panel was drawn by those of another culture; or (3) Plains Indian artists lost their an tipathy toward fish on this occasion. The difference in size between the Fish Creek pictographs and the Fremont pictures may be of no help in dating as only a small fraction of the pictograph and petroglyph designs in the Plains area of Montana approach the size of the Fre mont pictographs. It is noted there are no figures at Fish Creek which clearly indicate either white contact or great antiquity. It is the writer's opinion that the Fish Creek pictographs were not drawn by Fremont peoples, even though the south-central part of Montana has apparently been oc cupied by Indian tribes and their ances tors for several thousand years. The Owl Canyon Pictograph Site The Owl Canyon pictograph is an abo riginal painting on a sandstone cliff which depicts a warrior behind his large shield. Owl Canyon itself is a usually dry canyon</page><page sequence="7">30 in prairie country in Wheatland County, Montana. Its entire length is not over half a mile, but in the vicinity of the site the canyon must be 50 feet deep. The south side of the canyon, and the north side, except for a 5 to 15 foot rimrock cliff at the top, are in the shape of a "V" and meet at the dry stream bed which is 3 to 5 feet wide. The canyon walls have a scattering of pine trees. Two hundred yards below the site the canyon empties into a prairie of lower altitude. The site has been assigned site number 24WL402 by the Billings Archaeological Society from the block of numbers made available by the Smithsonian Institution. HarlinH. Lucas, of Harlowton, Montana, introduced the writer to the site on May 23, 1959. The site is situated in the NE 1/4 of section 34, township 6 north, range 18 east of Montana Principal Meridian. Eugene E. Tabor of Ryegate, Montana, owns the land. The painting is 5 feet above the ground on a horizontal surface of the sandstone cliff on the north side of the canyon where the base of the rimrock cliff is indented. The painting itself is well preserved due to the protection afforded by the over hanging cliff. Its orange color (without pecking or incision) is due to* the great amount of yellow pigment added to the hematite base. In fact, the paint is similar in hue to that used for the 6 dots placed between 2 of the snouted figures in the previously described Fish Creek pictographs. Apparently the paint ap plicator was a finger or a tool of ordi nary finger size, and the only noticeable variation in line width is to be found around the exterior of the shield and the outlined squares which are especially heavily traced (Fig.3B ). The figure is 13 1/2 inches high and 10 1/4 inches wide. Only the warrior's head and legs, and an object which pro trudes obliquely upward from behind the shield at 11 o'clock, are not hidden by the shield which is, itself, decorated with small lines radiating from circumference in the manner of a fringe. The "fringe" at the top of the shield is black; the re mainder red. The other exception to the use of red in the painting is the eye, which is black. The object protruding from the shield has been partially obliterated by water action. An elbow or bend in the object is discernable. The figure's right eye is not clear, but a dim circle appears where the eye should be. There are 4 pairs of matching square or rectangular outlines, 1 pair at each of the 4 quad rants just inside the edge of the shield. In the center of the shield a circular space is decorated with a design con sisting of 2 eyes with short lines extend ing upward and a wide, indistinct line below in the approximate position of a mouth. The design in the center of the shield is imperfect due to a fault in the rock. The legs and feet of the warrior are shown in three-quarter view. The shield-bearing-warrior design ap pears frequently in central Montana. It has been observed at the Grinnvoll Rock Shelter Pictograph site reported below, at Pictograph Cave near Billings (Mulloy 1958: 120 et seq.), and the writer has seen a petroglyph of this motif on the east side of Rock Creek near Joliet. Se crist has reported a considerable num ber of shield-bearing warriors at Bear Canyon and Atherton Canyon in Fergus County (Secrist I960: 7, 8, 9, 11, 15). Wormington and Taylor have reported shield-bearing warriors in pictograph panels attributed to the Fremont culture in Utah (Wormington 1955: 80, 82, 16, 5-170, 176; Taylor 1957: 120). In speaking of the pictures in Pictograph Cave, Mulloy stated that 5 of the figures of men almost entirely obscured by large circular shields had objects which extend ed upward obliquely on the right side from behind the shield (Mulloy 1958:121). The object might have been a spear or a club, but it always had something depend ing from its end. The protruding object at Owl Canyon is on the opposite side from those just described and is partially obliterated so that it is impossible to determine whether something depended from its end or not. However, it may well correspond to the oblique object mentioned by Mulloy at Pictograph Cave. Wormington is the source for the state ment that Morss was inclined to believe that the pictures of individuals bearing large shields, as well as actual speci mens of large hide shields found in the Fremont area, were of more recent ori gin. However, further evidence indicated</page><page sequence="8">31 that they are a part of the Fremont com plex. Wormington reported that such pic tographs are found consistently in areas where there are Fremont sites; and al though in some cases they are associated with pictures of horses and mounted riders, they do not seem to be of the same age (Worm ington 1955: 165, 166). The aboriginal resi dents of the area are described in the Fish Creek report above. Grinnvoll Rock Shelter Pictographs Site The Grinnvoll Rock Shelter pictographs are aboriginal paintings of shield-bearing war riors, a horse and possibly a rider, and an anthropomorphic figure with symbolic arm depicted by a circle at the shoulder. The site is located in a rock shelter on the north side of the Middle Fork of the Judith River in a picturesque box canyon on the eastern edge of the Little Belt Mountains which are the western boundary of the Plains in Judith Basin County, Montana, and in the Lewis and Clark National Forest. The canyon walls are vertical and from 25 to 75 feet high. While the river now flows in an al most straight line, there was a tendency in the past for it to meander, creating a number of in dentations in the form of house-size rock shelters at the foot of the Madison lime stone cliffs on alternating sides of the stream. Access to the box canyon may be gained only by wading in the stream from above or below. This was easily accomplished in late June, 1960, since the water was crystal clear, the river bed composed of small pebbles, the water knee deep, and the current reason able. In front of each rock shelter is a grassy area with small trees and bushes. The Grinnvoll Rock Shelter is approxi mately 1/3 mile downstream from the mouth of Yogo Creek. Maps and surveys are in apparent conflict, but the site is near the north boundary of the SE 1/4 of section 34, township 13 north, range 11 east; the site has been designated 24JT401 by the Smithsonian Institution. Unquestionably trout fishermen have seen the pictographs; but as far as can be determined their discovery by Barney K. Grinnvoll, of Harlowton, Montana, on June 25, 1960, was the first time they had been known to amateur or profession al archaeologists. The site was investi gated by Grinnvoll and Harlin H. Lucas of Harlowton, and Denes G. Istvanffy and the writer, of Billings. The limestone on which the pictographs are located is pitted and rough, and consti tutes an inferior surface for paintings. The panel is on 3 adjacent rock faces, 2 of which are parallel to the stream, the other being perpendicular to and connect ing the former. The rock faces consti tute the rear wall of the rock shelter. The overhang affords protection from direct assault by the elements although water obviously drips down the rock faces from above. The paint used is black and cannot be eroded by rubbing with a wet finger. Pecking or incision was discovered in only one instance. The lines in the pictures are from less than finger width to approximately double finger width, but the wider lines suggest repetitious drawing rather than single strokes. The larger rock face is on the down stream end. From (the observer's) right to left are the following figures: (a)an anthropomorphic figure with trape zoidal body, (b) a four-legged phallic animal with a vague representation of a "rider, " (c)four anthropomorphic figures side-by-side, three of which are shield bearing, (d) another anthropomorphic figure, this on the perpendicular rock face, with shield. The body is showing but it has no arms and no weapons. The final figure (e) is located on the face of the limestone parallel to the river up stream from the perpendicular surface. It is another shield-bearing, anthropo morphic figure. The bent knees of the larger anthropo morphic figure are different from the knobby knees of the skirted figure at Fish Creek, but some of the difference may have resulted from the roughness of the rock surface. The anthropomorphic figures with the circles around their bodies fall within the shield-bearing-warrior category it seems, but the bodies showing through the shields represent a departure from the more common technique. The writer's view, based upon examination of the site, is that the bodies show through the shields because of lack of care or so phistication on the artist's part rather than from an intent to show a shield bearing-warrior from the rear, and this</page><page sequence="9">32 in spite of the lack of facial features. It is possible the shields were added as an afterthought. The smaller representa tion may be a child, and if so, the 4 to gether might be the males of one family unit, or those on a hunting party. The horizontal lines connecting the anthropomorphic figures side by side at neck level might conceivably represent the arms of the figures, although the re semblance to arms is slight. Although a break in the rock surface makes it un certain, the termination of the horizontal line at the horse's nose may represent the larger anthropomorphic figure's right arm and hand, or a rope held in the right hand. The indistinct splashes of paint at the horse's nose may represent a human hand or a knot in a rope around the horse's head or jaw. The animal un doubtedly depicts a horse and it is the writer's opinion that the object on the horse's back is a human representation. As the color of the paint is black, char coal or ashes likely provided the pig ment; and the indelible character may have resulted from mixing the basic sub stance with grease. The paint seems to be applied with a rigid applicator such as a wooden stick or bone because the depressions in the surface of the rock are without coloration. The lines are of differing widths too, as if different ap plicators were used. The lines of the various pictures in the larger panel were not sufficiently dark to register on a photograph taken from the distance necessary to include the en tire panel. The scale drawing was made by tracing projected images from 3 colored transparancies of the various figures in the panel. Every care was taken to insure that the scale and rela tive positions were preserved in the com posite picture, but because of photo graphic distortions, very slight errors of size and position may exist in Figure 3C At this writing, there is no way to check the accuracy of the scale drawing. The distribution of the shield-bearing warrior motif is set forth in the Owl Can yon pictograph report in this publication. The circle at shoulder appears to be a symbolic arm. The same technique ap pears in the southern panel of the Fish Creek pictographs reported in this pub lication. It does not appear uncommon to show 3 or more anthropomorphic figures side-by-side, the convention having been used at Fish Creek and in Fremont culture sites (Taylor 1957:80). An examination of the site revealed no evidence that the different figures were not executed contemporaneously. As far as has been determined, the Grinnvoll Rock Shelter pictographs con tain the first reported instance of shield - bearing warriors appearing in the same panel as horses. Prior to this discovery, and based on the absence of such occur rence, it was suggested that the shield bearing warrior was restricted to pre horse times, at least in the Fremont area (Wormington 1955: 165, 166). Fur ther reasoning was that the shields were too large for horsemen and obviously ex ceeded the size of shields known to have been used on the Plains. It should be mentioned that horses were ac quired by the Blackfeet, who inhabited the area when white men first arrived, the last half of the 1700"s. (Ewers 1955: 15-19 ; Grinnell 1961:241.) That the Blackfeet (Wis - sler 1911:38, 39) and Crows (Lowie 1935:211) have both used 1, 2, and 3 feathered head - dresses in their picture writing is also of in terest. Although the historic territory of the Crow Indians is 200 miles southeast of this site, the Cluny Earthlodge Village near Calgary, Alberta, may have been a Crow village in the first half of the 18th century ( Forbis and Huscher 1961:101). CONCLUSION In spite of considerable difference in the quality of representation, the Grinn voll and Fish Creek sites have one un usual characteristic in common - the symbolic arm. Because of the wider dis tribution of the shield-bearing-warrior motif, its appearance in the Owl Canyon and Grinnvoll sites does not necessarily signify common antecedents. However, since characteristics of the painting at the Grinnvoll site also appear at the other 2 sites, there is a possibility that the same group painted the pictographs at all 3 sites. Great age does not seem indicated in any of the 3 sites. The Grinnvoll pictographs were painted after the artists were acquainted with</page><page sequence="10">33 horses, although they were still utilizing what undoubtedly originated as a pre horse motif, the shield-bearing warrior. Irrespective of the identity of the artists, the pictographs at the Grinnvoll site would seem to require a date not earlier than the 18th century. The chief residents of the area, the Blackfeet, ap parently neither owned nor knew of horses before that time. The Fish Creek and Owl Canyon sites are not so clearly defined in time, but by reason of the similarities in character istics with the Grinnvoll site they are probably within a few generations of the date of the Grinnvoll site. Although the Blackfeet controlled the area in which the Grinnvoll site is lo cated after they became skillful horse men, the Grinnvoll pictographs, having both pre-horse and post-horse character istics, may have been made at the time horses were first being used by the Black feet or the departing tribes. The pictures do not seem to be those of the vanquished, however. Relying upon the discovery of the Grinn voll pictographs and the frequency and state of preservation of the shield bearing-warrior design in Montana, the author submits that while the motif un doubtedly originated in pre-horse times, it did persist after the introduction of the horse. The artists, having used the standardized design over a protracted period, may have had it so well implanted in their minds that they did not change the relative size of the shield in picto graphs even after they adopted smaller shields for actual use. In the Fish Creek Pictographs, some primitive religious expression may be involved, at least in the snouted figures. The points of similarity between these 3 sites and the Fremont sites, despite the dissimilarities, suggest common heritage or transmission of art techni ques north or south on the Plains just east of the Rocky Mountains.
