<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW As to the relation of theology to science, Dr. Tennant writes: "At one time the religious could look upon science as if it were a black art; and, nearer to our own day, there were representatives of science who would grant to religious faith only the realm of nescience in which to expatiate. Today theology has no concern with doctrine of a double truth, as if what is true in its sphere could well be false in that of science; with a system of bookkeeping by double entry, with water-tight com- partments, or with mutual irrelevancy. It is perhaps equally impatient of compromise, accommodation, and reconcilation. Without servility, it would establish positive relationships with science. It would find the unifying bond, in Reason: the differentia, in diversity of operations on the same data. At least this is how theology is here conceived, whatever different estimations of its nature and attitude may obtain elsewhere. Hence theology's interest in science's limitations. Conscious of her own, she yet indulges the hope that her research may prove supple- mentary to that of delimited science" (p. 362). Emphasizing the limitations of science, philosophy and theology, in the view of Tennant, "would not offensively fling a tu quoque at science, deserved as it would be if science persisted in arrogating to itself the epithet 'positive,' but would rather establish brotherly relations in virtue of a common humanity or anthropism, and by division of labour to a common end. There is more than one sort of intelligibility. And though neither kind is possible at all, without some tincture of the other, either may be preferentially pursued, legitimately and fruitfully, with a view to the final adjustment and comprehension of both" (pp. 363-4). THEOLOGY OF JUDAISM ACCORDING TO JOSEPHUS2 THE revived interest in Josephus continues. To the numerous studies of the first century historian Prof. Schlatter contributes a valu- able analysis of the religious ideas reported in his writings. Schlatter considers this testimony more revealing than that of a Philo, an Akiba or the author of the Ezra Apocalypse. Even his rationalizations of Judaism after the Greek fashion are symptomatic of the thought currents of the significant era in which he lived. Schlatter's concern 2 Die Theologie des Judentums nach dem Bericht des Josefus. Von Prof. D. A. SCHLATTER. Giitersloh: VERLAG VON C. BERTELSMANN, 1932. Pp. viii+270. 152</page><page sequence="2">JUDAISM ACCORDING TO JOSEPHUS-COHON with Josephus is that of a student of Christian origins, but his treatment leaves nothing to be desired in the way of objectivity. Without imposing upon Josephus a preconceived system, Schlatter interrogates him on the following phases of Jewish belief and practice: (1) The Creator of Nature; (2) The Lord of Humanity; (3) God's People; (4) Piety; (5) Righteousness; (6) Liberalism; (7) The Pharisaic Movement; (8) The Gnostic Ferment; (10) The Relation of Israel to the Nations; (11) The Future. To each of these a special chapter is devoted. A few chapters contain more than the titles indicate. For example, the section of God's People includes Josephus' conception of Torah, Prophecy, the Canon, Tradition, the Samaritans, etc. While the multiplicity of details treated makes for a certain looseness of arrangement, there is always a soundness of judgment. The author consistently distinguishes between the personal creed of Josephus from the theology of Palestinian Judaism on the one hand and from Alex- andrian conceptions on the other, and repeatedly calls attention to New Testament parallels. Josephus' own position is presented as that of an attenuated Phari- saism, actuated by apologetic motives. His dealing with the Pharisees and ignoring the Rabbis indicate that he was interested in their political activities rather than in their theological contributions. His own polit- ical aspirations rendered him an opponent of the Rabbis. From his Apology it is hard to infer that at the time of its writing the Rabbis established the Patriarchate in Jabneh and thereby took over the government of the people in their hands. In his attitude toward the Rabbis, Josephus reflects the view of the activistic elements which resented their withdrawal into the house of study and confining their theology to saving men from sin. As a priest, Josephus may have also regarded the Pharisees as competitors. Of their writings he made very little use. In his Apology and Antiquities he utilized only Hellenistic sources. However, though he gives no information regarding detailed Pharisaic decisions, his picture of Pharisaism is complete, for he himself was a Pharisee, even though a disenchanted one. His ardor was tem- pered partly by his renunciation of the immediacy of the messianic advent and partly by his contact with liberal Jewish tendencies in consequence of settling in Rome and studying Hellenistic Jewish literature. Nonetheless, what he professes and teaches is Pharisaic, despite its Hellenistic coloring. Thus he requires no other explanation of creation beside the active will of God, differing thereby from the theology of Hellenistic Judaism 153</page><page sequence="3">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW with its Logos theory. The unity of God accounts for the unity of all creation. All things proceed from God and exist for Him. He is the beginning, middle and end of all. Schlatter points to a Grecian note in Josephus' reference to God as "the Father and Parent of the universe" (Ant., VII, 380) as well as in his use of megalistes (greatness) rather than hagiosyne (holiness) to express God's transcendence. God's character is described by means of negative attributes. He is in need of nothing; He is unbegotten, unchangeable, indestructible, self- sufficient and all containing. A Greek note is detectible also in the reference to God as "the blessed Being or Nature." Under Greek influ- ence the word cosmos suggested itself to designate the all created by God. This word had no less important consequences for the develop- ment of thought than the term nature which was borrowed from plant and animal life. The beginning of this usage goes back to Aristobulus. Josephus employs the word cosmos in the sense of the Hebrew Olam, to designate both mankind and nature of which it is a part. Olam appears also as the equivalent of aeon or eternity. Josephus seldom refers to God under the figure of "heaven." He uses the word "heaven," in the singular, for the visible space filled with stars. As for Aristobulus so for Josephus no special limitations exist for God. The Merkabah, so prominent in rabbinic literature, is absent from his vision of the Divine (cf. Wars, V, 214). His world picture is considerably enlarged. He knows of air between earth and heaven, and counts it with earth, sea and fire among the four elements. From Greek thought he derived the concepts of element and of matter. Man receives his special place in nature by virtue of his soul, which is the Divine in man. It originates not with the body, but comes to man from the outside. Despite his advanced views, Josephus has not wholly escaped anthropomorphism. "The God of the Law appeared to man as a kindred I" (p. 23). Schlatter possibly confuses anthropomorphism with personality. Like nature so humanity derives its being from God. He is the Father of mankind and His will determines its destiny. By the word Father, Josephus expresses the idea of God as giver of life. Humanity's dependence upon Him is covered by the word Lord. In Pharisaic theology man's dependence upon God manifests itself through nature and providence. His inner life is autonomous. Within it freedom holds sway. Thus the distance between man and God is preserved. Sonship of God in the literal sense is considered blasphemy (Ant., VII, 93). Humanity like nature forms a unity because its Lord and Father is one. He is brought into relation with man through the ethical 154</page><page sequence="4">JUDAISM ACCORDING TO JOSEPHUS-COHON elements of goodness, grace, retribution, etc. From the Greeks the Jews received not only the idea of nature but also of destiny or fate. What is the relation of tyche to Providence? Though Josephus occa- sionally speaks of the two as distinct, he generally identifies them (Ant., XIX, 347; Wars, IV, 622). This makes for fatalism. To account for evil, Josephus admits of demonic action by the side of God, though he mentions neither evil angels nor Satan. With the recognition of fate no room is left for the activity of angels. The unity of God furnishes the ground also for the unity of the Jewish people (Ant., IV, 201; V, 112). As God cannot be localized, His relationship is not with the land but with the people of Israel. This gave the Jew unlimited freedom of movement. While personal invoca- tions of God are not wanting, it is generally of the God of Israel that Josephus speaks. The idea of God as King of Israel represents theocracy. Israel in turn is God's servant. Though recognizing that this usage appears as a distinction of honor, Schlatter contrasts it with the Christian way of speaking of man as God's son rather than His slave. Rabbinic literature deprives this contrast of all reality (see Abot 3.18). The unity of the Jewish people fills Josephus with pride. In his Apology he passes over the divisions of Jewry and presents it to the world as a harmonious whole. In the histories he deals with the different sects only because he cannot avoid it. At that he keeps back many things, like the differences between the Shamaites and Hillelites, in order not to mar the picture of Jewish unity. The unity of God, the unity of humanity and the unity of the Jewish people become visible in the unity of the Temple (Ap., II, 193; Ant., IV, 201). The rise of the Samaritan Temple and that of Onias endan- gered the unifying force of the sanctuary on Mt. Zion. Even after the destruction of the first the breach was not healed. The Egyptian Temple did not affect Judaism in the same manner, for Alexandrian Jewry honored the Temple of Jerusalem. Josephus even speaks of the Egyp- tian Temple with respect as having been intended to strengthen Juda- ism and to be of service to the Ptolemies (Ant., XIII, 67). The unity of the Jewish people grows out of their common history, going back to the patriarchs, and to their natural cohesion as belonging to the same race. Hence the prominence of genealogies, particularly of the priests and of the kings. Above all Jewish unity was cemented by the Torah, whereby they were distinguished from all other nations (Ant., XVI, 158; cf. XVII, 158). The belief that the Torah was to be shared also by other people inspired the missionary endeavors of all 155</page><page sequence="5">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW parties in Judaism and of men as different from one another as Herod and Banus. As Jewish politics rested upon the Torah, it coalesced with theology and ethics. The demands of religion Josephus expresses by eusebeia or piety toward God and dikaiosyne, righteousness, toward man. Both subjects are treated exhaustively by Schlatter. This distinction he contrasts with the view of Jesus which summarizes the Torah in the two com- mands to love God and to love man and derives the latter from the former. As Luke 10.25-7 puts this doctrine into the mouth of a Pharisee rather than of Jesus, and as it was preached by Jewish masters before Jesus (e.g., Testament of the XII Patriarchs; Dan. 5.3; Issach. 5.1, 7.6; Zebul. 5.1-3, etc.; Philo, De Decal., XXIII) the contrast drawn by Schlatter is of no significance. The light of the unity of God irradiates all forms of Jewish piety and righteousness and the relations of the Jewish people to the rest of mankind. It gives meaning not only to the Jewish past and present but also to the Jewish future. God being both the beginning and end, His people has both a past and a future, and the distinguishing character of the future is that it is God's work. Furthermore, as God's Law cannot pass away, so Israel to whom the law was entrusted cannot disappear. It is the Law that governs Jerusalem and makes it a holy city. Though the city and Temple were bound up with the people, the existence of the people were not dependent upon them. Their destruc- tion did not mark the end of history. There is hope for their rebuilding (Wars, V, 19). As Josephus sought the naturalization of the Jews in the Roman world, he did not press the hope of the restoration of the Temple and the holy city. While he lamented the fall of Jerusalem, in the War, he makes no mention of this calamity in his Apology. Having departed from the Pharisaic doctrine of Messianism, Jose- phus deviated also from Pharisaic eschatology. Instead of conceiving of it as a national hope, he limits it to the individual. As Eleazar's speech to the garrison at Masada (Wars, VII, 323 ff.) shows, escha- tology was transformed into a doctrine of the soul and Messianism was replaced with the belief in personal immortality. Schlatter might have pointed out that Josephus' fascinating reduc- tion of Judaism to four unities (to which might have been added the fifth unity of the Torah) displays Greek love of system. More attention might have been paid to his testimony regarding Messianism, and a more detailed study made of his relation to the beginnings of Chris- tianity. The reason which Schlatter gives for the popular indignation 156</page><page sequence="6">JUDAISM ACCORDING TO JOSEPHUS-COHON against Aristobulus I, when he set himself up as king and later against the Herodians, is hardly convincing (pp. 177 ff.). The cause of irri- tation was not so much their setting themselves up above all human jurisdiction as their not being of Davidic descent. Neither is Schlatter convincing in his explanation of the silence of Josephus regarding Christian origins. Inasmuch as Josephus taught that no offense should be given to other people by blaspheming their gods (Ant., IV, 207; Ap., II, 237), Schlatter argues that "Josephus's silence grows out of the judgment, which the Palestinian Rabbinate shared, that Christianity was abodah zarah." (p. 255, n. 2). It must be noted that despite his admonition against reviling the gods and religious customs of the neighbors, Josephus did not hesitate to denounce the shortcomings of idolatry (Ap., II, 238 ff.). Furthermore, no proof is extant that Chris- tianity was classed by Jewish masters of the first century as abodah zarah. Whatever Josephus may have thought of early Christianity, he could not have overlooked its birth within the Jewish community and recognized it as part of his province of Jewish history. It is more tempting to explain his silence on the same ground on which he passed over and soft pedaled other divisions in Jewry. Even if Christianity had grown sufficiently important for the aristocratic historian to take notice of its development, he may have desisted in order not to accen- tuate the divisions and thereby spoil the picture of Jewish unity which he endeavors to paint.
