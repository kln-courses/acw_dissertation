<plain_text><page sequence="1">1 Early Oracular Practice: Inspiration by Divination В. С Dietrich Glaukos, the infant son of king minos of Knossos and Pasiphae, fell into a pithos filled with honey and drowned. After a long vain search his father found the body but only with the help of divine prophets or Apollo himself. Glaukos was eventually restored to life by the famous seer Polyidos. The popular myth, which provided the plot for two lost tragedies by Sophocles and Euripides,1 was very old, although the first extant version was recorded as late as Apollodorus.2 In his Sather Classical lectures over half a century ago Persson explained the myth as a paradigm of the annual death and rebirth of nature which he believed to be central to Minoan and Mycenaean cult and reflected in contemporary glyptic art.3 His thesis may be too global for modern tastes, but his reading of the myth's central theme remains compelling today. The tale's basic elements of death, disappearance and renewal are undeniable,4 indeed some versions substituted Asclepius for the seer Polyidos as a more fitting agent to restore Glaukos to life. But a curious rider to the myth confirms Polyidos' status as the boy's saviour. It is said that Minos would not release the prophet until he had taught his mantic art to Glaukos. On returning to his home in Corinth, however, or possibly Argos according to some, Polyidos craftily took the gift away again by spitting into the child's mouth. The seer and his trick were later additions to the myth implying the existence of linguistic oracles. They also imply incidentally that the oracles originated from an anthropomorphic god speaking in the first person through a prophetic medium, just like the procedure at Delphi in fact.5 'Nauck, Frg.

The same Polyidos, or his namesake, is the qeron aqathos, the goodly sage in the Iliad who tried to prevent his son Euchenor from sailing to Troy.6 His office is comparable to others in Homer like Calchas, the only professional seer in the poems, and the family of Melampus, represented by Theoclymenus in the Odyssey, who traced their ancestry to Pylian Nestor but as seers and warriors belonged to the epic world of archaic Greece.7 The Thebaid described Amphiaraus, great grandson of Melampus, as "both seer and able warrior."8 It is difficult to determine when the prophet became involved in Glaukos' myth, but it is unlikely to have been pre-archaic. The perception of his function is epic, and he had acquired his special skill by divine grace like the poet. Though apparently distinct in Homer, both professions were the same in archaic Greek thought, "Make your prophecy, Muse," said Pindar, "and I shall be your interpreter."9 In Hesiod's Theogony both the Muses and the poet have knowledge of "things present, future and past," precisely like Calchas in the Iliad.10 The blind minstrel Demodocus in the Odyssey was taught either by the Muses, we are told, or by Apollo.11 Both prophet and poet claimed knowledge of the truth by divine inspiration. This notion becomes a commonplace,12 and also the fact that both prophet and poet were concerned more with present and past than with the future. In that latter more modern sense of oracle only Teiresias really qualifies as a prophet in Homer, because he describes future events to Odysseus in the Nekyia. But he does so in order to further the plot and accordingly fulfills a practical rather than traditional function in this passage as a kind of poetic device.13 6//. 13, pp. 663-79; cf., Ε.

The one as old as religion itself concerned with renewal through divine contact, and the other a form of direct communication with the god through the medium of a professional seer and interpreter of divine will. The melding of both illustrates the curious, sometimes haphazard, manner in which religious tradition evolved. The process was continuous and is instructive to anyone enquiring after the origins of Greek oracular practice. Inspirational prophecy, like poetry, was a product of the archaic period with its fervent desire for oneness with the gods which was also echoed by the telestic ritual of the emerging Bacchic mystery cults. Plato classified all three under the same heading of mania, madness or divine possession, etymologizing mantike and manike as identical terms.14 It was in reaction to this view, which runs counter to the romantic faith in Greek rationalism of the 19th and early 20th century, that Rohde and Nietzsche separated Apolline religion from the ecstatic, irrational and consequently non-Greek cults of the so-called intruder god Dionysus who "forced the Pythia on Delphi."15 Their arguments remain orthodox dogma to this day;16 but Dionysus was no more or less of an intruder than Apollo, and both gods in one form or another appeared on the Greek scene before the Bronze Age had been rung out. Plato's account reflects aspects of Bacchic maenadism of the 5th century from which perhaps arose the tradition, so joyfully taken up and reinforced by the Christian apologists, of a laurel chewing, drugged and raving Pythia at Delphi. The image has been shown up as false:17 the Pythia, when inspired by Apollo, was no more frenzied than seer or poet in Homer, or for that matter Cassandra herself who had not yet developed her supernatural gift or special relationship with Apollo.18 Oracular and poetic frenzy was a post-archaic, late classical, phenomenon and not the same as the earlier "Phaedrus 244A-245A. 15Dodds, Greeks, p. 68. 16E.

Epic oracular activity more directly operated through Zeus and his oldest oracle at Dodona,20 while Apollo acted as a kind of intermediary, the "vicar on earth of the heavenly father" making known to man the will of Zeus.21 In this epic context Delphi plays a less than minor role. Pytho is mentioned four times in Homer and in only one late passage, which may have been borrowed from Cyclic epic, specifically refers to an oracle there.22 Apollo in Homer does not inspire the seer but grants him his skill or knowledge as in the case of Calchas (II. 1,72) and Melampus together with his descendants (Od. 15,252: Polypheides). But this knowledge is far from specialized: ideally it can be acquired by any hero in epic who may act as his own seer. So Telemachus says to his mother, "I see all these things in my heart and know them, the good and bad alike" (Od. 18, 228-29). The hero relies on intelligent conjecture, experience and a measure of intuition for the knowledge in his thymos. Anyone can know the past, according to the proverb and Menelaos in the J/w&lt;f,23but even Calchas* professional skill of knowing present and future (J/. 1,72) can easily be matched by the wise layman Halitherses who counselled the slain suitors' kin in the Odyssey.24 There is no Pythia in Homer, frenzied or sober, no ecstatic Cassandra possessed and inspired by Apollo, in short no unambiguous trace of "Inspirationsmantik."25Theoclymenus* lurid prediction of the suitors' immi- nent fate is no exception, nor a "Vorform" of intuitive mantic,26 but a reasonable deduction that the gods will punish them for their sins, for, as he says, "I have eyes and ears and an understanding mind" (Od. 20, 365-66).

The variety of these signs in epic is considerable, including lightning, sudden sounds, a rainbow or falling star like Athena descending from the sky (II 4, 74-9). They are terata, that is dread and wondrous portents, usually of war in epic poetry, but they are always directly visible.28 It is important then to distinguish between the machinery of prophecy and epic divine Parousia. The one is not related to the other, indeed the close physical proximity of gods to men in Homer turns out to be epic literary convention rather than the survival of prehistoric Aegean religious beliefs. On the face of it divine epiphany in Homer seems reminiscent of earlier religious practice. Matz and Nilsson have enshrined epiphany as the central factor of Minoan and Mycenaean religion on the strength of the surviving iconography.29 It has in fact recently been argued from the art and architecture of the New Palace period that two distinct types of epiphany obtained in Minoan cult: one ecstatic, i.e. the vision by worshippers of an anthropomorphic divinity, and the other consisting in ritually enacted epiphanies in special areas of the palace.30 The evidence for invocatory titles of Minoan and Mycenaean deities further enhances the impression of constant divine proximity and the expectation of their physical presence at religious ceremonies.31 The concept of intuitive, divinely inspired prophecy seems closely related suggesting perhaps that a few incidents like Penelope's dream in Od. 19,32or indeed certain objects such as Teiresias* golden staff,33 were direct survivals from the prehellenic past. However, there were no Minoan/Mycenaean inspirational oracles, no links between Delphi and the prehistoric past. The oracle's legendary foundation myths and responses, including the prescription of an annual tribute to king Minos of Knossos by the city of Athens, were later classical 27Il. 7, pp. 4-45. "Not by the outer ear, but by his power as soothsayer," (Leaf) conveys the main idea. 2HFor a list of examples in Homer with references to the relevant modern literature see Vermeule, Götterkult, pp. 118-20.

The latter story occurs in Ovid, Hyginus and still in Pausanias without reference to Delphi,34 and did not in fact predate Oenomaeus* collection of oracles.35 There is no archaeological evidence for fixed Minoan/Mycenaean oracle sites. Pasiphae's sanctuary at Thalamae with its incubation oracle was an archaic institution.36 Other sources are not particu- larly compelling either, including Linear B, although it is tempting to search for some sort of indication in the vocabulary of the tablets. Opetereu/opetoreu, for example, which appears on three Pylian documents, has been interpreted as the title of an official "who sees into the future," "a prophet,"37 wetereu as "he who sees in the flesh," "a diviner,"38 and keretao, which occurs once in the Pylian documents,39 as the genitive of a word meaning "he who gives oracles."40 The arguments have been accepted by some,41 despite linguistic problems.42 But they are based, one suspects, on preconceived notions of prehistoric oracular activity. In other words, classical procedure has been projected back on to an unknown Bronze Age context without any real corroborative support from other sources. The classical chresterion was a place where one "uses" or "consults the god" - chresthai theo, whose pronouncements become ineluctable law, hence the impersonal form ehre meaning "necessity." The term describes a specialized concept of oracles which cannot be paralleled from the Bronze Age. A better case can be made out for qerasija/qerasijo in Linear В which, if it has been deciphered correctly, links up with Homer and indeed with what is archaeologically shown to have been common oracular practice in prehistoric times. The title has been translated by "augur," on analogy with the Homeric teras meaning "portent" in the form of a "meteorological 34Ovid, Met 7, pp. 456-60; Paus. 1, 27, 10; Hygin., Fab 41. 35H.W.

Divination and the priestly office of seer have been attested in Mesopota- mia from very early times. Babylonia and Assyria practiced many forms of oracle by the second millennium B.C., but in the main they depended on the observation of visible signs, that is predominantly mechanical devices like the flight of birds, abnormal human and animal births, the entrails and liver of sacrificial animals, various forms of lecanomancy, and so on.46 The same means were familiar to the Homeric poets, of course, but they were also known to the Mycenaeans who in fact only left evidence of this kind of purely practical oracular activity between the 14th and 12th century B.C. They adopted the forms of prophecy of their oriental neighbors in areas of close physical contact. Thirty-two clay models of the liver have been found in Mari with oracular formulae concerning the fate of the rulers of Akkad.47 They predate the Hammurabi dynasty, but they served the same purpose as an inscribed bronze votive liver from the Mycenaean Temple II at Kition in Cyprus of the 12th century B.C.48 Other examples of similar ritual livers have turned up in the House of the Human Priest on the slope of the acropolis of Ras Shamra together with Ugaritic mytho- logical texts and Mycenaean rhyta of the 14th/ 13th century.49 The city was a famous Mycenaean station at the time and the archaeological remains point to forms of divination which had obtained in the east since history began and which continued as the mainstay of epic augurs who in turn 43See above n. 28; A.Furumark, "Ägäische Texte in griechischer Sprache," Eranos 51 (1954): 103-20; 52: 18-60; Ventris and Chadwick, Documents, p. 303. 44Cf.

However, no clear signs survive of concurrent intuitive inspirational prophecy in Minoan/Mycenaean culture. The Glaukos myth confused mediumistic prophecy with rebirth and renewal. The expectation of the periodic renewal of life was fundamental to Minoan and Mycenaean religious thought: it evidently formed the point of contact between the Bronze Age and historic "Inspirationsmantik" leaving a remarkably deep imprint on the myth associated with the latter and on every aspect of oracular procedure. The indicators of the enduring tradition are furnished by three symbols in particular: the bee, tripod and the cave. In different combinations these appear in oracular legend and performance so consistently as to convey the impression of an unbroken tradition stretching back to the prehistoric Aegean. All three have been discussed elsewhere, so that the evidence need not be rehearsed again in detail.50 Bee, like butterfly, with its peculiarly distinctive life cycle symbolized the expectation of renewal since time immemorial.51 The Nymphs at Delphi ate honey before uttering their prophecies.52 The Pythia herself was called melissa by Pindar,53 and of course our Glaukos drowned in ajar of honey: in his case the symbol of his eventual return also became the instrument of his death.54 The tripod cauldron was the standard implement for the ritual of renewal through fire and boiling. Arkas and Pelops were "renewed" in this manner, and Medea's skill at performing a similar service is well known. At Delphi it stood in the adyton of the temple,55 and the Pythia sat on it during the oracular session. Quite possibly the awkward perch was intended to suggest her own periodic renewal,56 as some modern scholars claim, but certainly the principal message is never in any doubt. It equally accounts for the partnership of Apollo and Dionysus at Delphi and their complex one, three and eight year festal cycles. That is a rather more likely reason for their association than any political move by the priesthood to bring Dionysus to Delphi in the 6th century.57 His 50BICS 25 (1978): 5-7. 51This point was treated most recently by R.

In art and literature, beginning with the Eumenides of Aeschylus, the emphasis is on his affinity with nature, with caves, the Corycian Cave in particular, and with the Nymphs.58 The god's seasonal aspect as Divine Child also comes across much more strongly at Delphi than any sophisticated Nietzschean notion of polarity between the two gods.59 In Orphic legend the Titans tore the young god apart, boiled his limbs and buried them beside the tripod. Dionysus' tomb there is mentioned by Philochorus and Callimachus,60 his rebirth by Philodemus.61 The Orphic account is reflected in similar stories told by Callimachus and Euphorion proving that it was part of a well known tradition with wider currency than Orphic myth.62 The child's dismemberment may well be what Plutarch describes as the "unspeakable sacrifice," which the Hosioi performed in the shrine, and part of a ceremonial complex culminating in the Thyiades "waking" Dionysus again in the liknon or winnowing basket.63 Apollo's regular disappearance and return were equally seasonal: he shared that characteristic with his divine partner.64 Originally the Pythia dispensed oracles only once a year, namely in spring on the 7th day of Bysios when the god returned to his sanctuary and was "renewed."65 The important role of the cave reinforced the signal: in Delphi it remained an essential element in the literary convention until Roman times,66 and else- where a cave also featured at many other Apolline oracles including Klaros in Asia Minor.67 However, the particular message contained in this religious assemblage of cave, bee and tripod seems wholly uncharacteristic of Apollo's primary nature: he was no "Jahres gott"68 or deity of vegetation. The connection surely lies in the specialized form of inspirational oracles. Not 58Aesch., Eum. 22; 24; cf. Soph., Ant. 1126; Eur., Ion 550-53, pp. 714-18, 1125; IT 1243; Phoen. 226 and schol.

Hence the desperate efforts of myth to establish a link between Apollo and nature spirits like the Nymphs, who taught the art of prophecy,70 Pan,71 and the Muses. The latter were associated with Apollo only at Delphi, where in the time of Simonides they enjoyed a cult near the sanctuary of the Earth goddess.72 They functioned as nature spirits, too, but their closest links with Apollo were forged from different metal.73 Plutarch neatly combines all three aspects of poetry, music and mantic skill by ascribing to the Muses the introduction of verse in the oracular responses.74 Chthonic oracles were of a different kind,75 but in form they profoundly affected Delphi giving rise to the tradition of a chasm or cavern in the temple's adyton to which the Pythia and consultants were said to descend for an oracular session. The technical vocabulary for this procedure includes the verbs katabainein, katerchesthai and katienai,76 although archaeologists have searched in vain for subterranean structures in the sacred precinct.77 Attention briefly focused on the Corycian Cave, some seven miles distant, as the presumptive first seat of the oracle. But cult there began relatively late and not before the 7th century B.C.78 in response to the tradition rather than as its founder, because the cave moved into prominence only during the centuries of the oracle's greatest influence. At Klaros, which looked to Delphi for its origins, the identical tradition took hold and the cave remained central to the consultation of its oracle, from the 7th century B.C. at least until the time of Tacitus.79 But chthonic signposts like chasm and spring became features of many Apolline oracles from Ionian Didyma to the Boeotian oracles of Apollo Ptoios, Tegyraios, Thuraios and others 69Fontenrose, Delphic Oracle, p. 228. 70Thriae, Horn.

Nevertheless Delphi's oracular history became contaminated with the myth of earlier tenancies by Ge and her daughter Themis, of an intrusive Apollo violently wresting control from the primordial earth-powers.81 In other versions the transfer occurred more peacefully,82 but generally with an underlying sense of succession from the chaotic old to a new order.83 However, the case for previous owners at Delphi is weak at best: the oldest accounts agree on Apollo as first comer and tenant,84 while votives in the sanctuary area and the earliest peribolos wall indicate a foundation date not before the 8th century B.C.. The oracle, if oracle there was from the beginning, must have been in the open until the construction of the first temple over a century later.85 It had always functioned by direct divine inspiration: arguments for other and older forms of prophecy in the sanctuary, including the much debated lot oracle, generally depend on the same misleading blend of traditions.86 Prophecy was an acquired skill for Apollo: he did not bring it with him from the east when he first arrived in Cyprus, Mycenaean Greece and in Crete before the end of the Bronze Age.87 So his particular style of prophesying through direct inspiration also was a secondary development and not an imported oriental practice, as some have supposed.88 He came to this function through his qualities as healing and purifying deity, as has 80A.

The curative magic chant accounts for his office as Musagetes,90 linked him with poetry91 and ultimately explains the lyre as the characteristic attribute of his anodyne classical image.92 Apollo's primary purificatory function remained conspicuous in Delphic myth, but it became submerged in his subsequent brilliant rise to eminence as the most representa- tive god of classical Greek values. He owed his ascendancy amongst other reasons to contemporary social circumstances. In the age of colonial expansion the oracle mediated between gods and men and established Apollo's authority in the countless settlements of the Greek oikists. That story is well known as an important signal of the Greek renaissance.93 Inspirational prophecy, too, was a product of the age and clue to contemporary religious thought which was deeply conscious of the need for absolute purity in its striving to communicate directly with the gods.94 In this respect the idiosyncratic oracular method functionally related to the emergent mystery religions which equally promised divine union to the faithful band of followers. Both had much in common, and the period produced many itinerant purveyors of oracles who are hard to tell apart from the contemporary charismatic initiator to private mysteries with similar services on offer, but always through the strict observation of purity. (There is no doubt that the Sibylline oracle should also be counted among the symptoms of the same archaic phenomenon. The ecstatic prophetess and her male counterpart Bakis pose some specific problems of their own which can not be addressed here. Their names most likely began as titles but of obscure, non-Greek, etymology, and their oriental origin further obscured their history in the west. In fact the Sibyl's arrival in Greece was not pre-archaic: it can be timed by her close link with epic poetry and myth, although the name H9Amandry, Mantique, pp. 129-30; Parke, Delphic Oracle I, pp. 8, 190; U.

As author of theological texts for Dionysus' mysteries and as initiator himself to his own rites, Orpheus played a part in an archaic tradition which accounted for his presence in the Argonaut saga. There perhaps as leader or member of a band of initiates, but certainly as magical singer and dispenser of oracles, Orpheus linked up with Apollo no later than the 7th century B.C.97 The will to possess or be possessed by the god furnished the driving force for all the archaic movements, for inspirational mantic as much as for mystery cults. It is a curious phenomenon of Greek religion, which constantly looked back to the past, that both were felt to be rooted in the prehistoric practice of renewal with all its ritual paraphernalia. Common origins do not lead to the same destiny, least of all in religion. In the case 95On the Sibyl see A. Bouché-Leclercq, Histoire de la Divination dans l'Antiquité (терт.

In fact, Dionysus was secondary to Apollo at Delphi, in his Thracian oracle (HER. 7, 111, 2), and at the oracle in Phocian Amphikleia (Paus. 10, 33, 11), cf. J. Defradas, Les Thèmes de la Propagande Delphique (Paris, 1954), p. 117. Dionysus' involvement in the myth of the see* Melampus is manifestly late (on Melampus' relationship with Apollo and Zeus in Homer see Vermeule, Götterkult, p. 118), tracing back to the Melampodeia epic in which Dionysus replaced Hera as the divine agent inflicting madness on Proteus' daughters from which they were healed by Melampus (first told by Hesiod, Cat, M.P. Nilsson, The Mycenaean Origin of Greek Mythology [Berkeley, 1932]), p. 62; on West's ed. of Hesiod, Theogony, [Oxford, 1966], p. 16). The tradition had become firmly established by the 5th century B.C. because, according to Herodotus (2, 49), Melampus was the first to introduce the name and rites of Dionysus into Greece. The version of Dionysus' death at the hands of frenzied Maenads also belonged to the 5th century and is first attested in Aeschyluys, Bassarae (frg. 82 mette); cf. M. L. West, BICS 30 (1983): 64-67; F. Graf, "Orpheus a Poet among Men," in Interpretations of Greek Mythology, J. Bremner ed. (London, 1987), p. 85. 97The tradition of the oracular head of Orpheus was well established by the 5th century in art and literature, Eur., Ale. pp. 966-72. The conflict with Dionysus, which led to Orpheus' death by the maenads (see n. 96) is explained in myth through his function as seer who introduced the worship of Apollo, S. Spencer, Mysticism in World Religion (London, 1966), p. 126. But Orpheus was no professional manitis in the Argonautica; his connection with Apollo was as singer, source of magic and healing oracles, according to Graf, "Orpheus," pp. 92-95, 99 and suggested, of course, by the chorus of the Alcestis.</page><page sequence="14">20 GREECE &amp; THE MEDITERRANEAN of Delphi, historical circumstance, good fortune and political astuteness of the resident priesthood combined to bring worldwide influence to the oracle ensuring Apollo's rise to the status of most luminous figure in the Olympian pantheon. "Deus . . . non Cassandra loquitur," as Cicero put it,98 that is, the god spoke directly to the enquirer not through his medium. The special relationship between god and man created a famous public institution at Delphi as well as a model for the civilized world, while mystery religion essentially remained a private form of worship, a self- indulgent escape from the hardships of the real world." Both began and determined their future in the archaic age of Greece. 98Cicero, div. 1, 66. "Cf. Burkert, Ancient Mystery Cults, p. 114.</page></plain_text>
