<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARK JARMAN Memory's Household In The Stranger at the Crossroads, the second part of James McCon- key's trilogy Court of Memory, he describes Keflavik, a town in Iceland totally surrounded by a fence. He writes that after visiting friends there, "I thought I could be happy if I could live forever in that fence-enclosed town my friends had come to." For the past thirty years, McConkey has attempted to make time stay still in such fenced-in enclosures. The latest installment of this occasionally puz? zling, but more frequently moving project, the third and final part of Court of Memory, has just been published.1 As with the previous two parts of his trilogy, McConkey uses animals and music as constant points of reference. Stories of My Life with the Other Animals also continues to deal with the present circumstances of McConkey's life, his family life in particular, as these actually surround those spots of time, those fence-enclosed events that make the past. McConkey returns often to the same events, and anyone who has read the previous parts of the trilogy will know what to expect in the third. But each revisit reveals more, partly as an updating, a where-are-they-or- we-now, but most affectingly as further understanding, as if after so much elapsed time he can tell us things he did not think or dare to in previous versions. When McConkey began to write his autobiography over thirty years ago it was in the shadow of nuclear annihilation. In "Crossroads" he confesses, "I no longer have tl^e desire, on this immense and silent winter's night, to dissemble, to fabricate tales." Thus he turned to telling stories that featured himself and his family members, his friends and acquaintances, in which he would not have to dissemble or fabricate. But without the fictional drive, that lost desire to make things up out of whole cloth and the fabric of experience, McConkey depends on a handful of key events. They are the divorce and remarriage of his parents, his service in Europe during World War II, his six years as a young college teacher in Morehead, Kentucky, his ascent to the Ivy League at Cornell, the death of his brother in a traffic accident, life with his wife Jean, and sons, Larry, Cris, and Jimmy, and his purchase and renovation of a Greek revival farmhouse and its acreage outside of Ithaca, New York. Possibly the energy of fiction has 1 STORIES FROM MY LIFE WITH THE OTHER ANIMALS, by James McConkey. David R. Godine. $19.95.</page><page sequence="2">332 THE HUDSON REVIEW gone into the perseverance of revelation. One reads the first two parts of Court of Memory, for example, learning that when McConkey was a pre-teen his father, a restless, unsuccessful entrepreneur, left his wife for a woman in Texas, abandoning his family in Little Rock, Arkan? sas. But it is not until Stories from My Life with the Other Animals that we learn that his mother Grace was thirteen years older than her husband Clayton, that they were married when he was nineteen, and that when Clayton left Grace she thought at first it must be because she had never had a missing front tooth replaced. McConkey points out that when his brother lost teeth in an accident, his mother insisted on having a bridge made for her son; her own lack of vanity was self-denial. McConkey also reveals that shortly after his parents were reconciled, his father again wished to divorce his mother but he, now a grown man, intervened, taking her to the hotel where his father was staying and presenting her to her husband. The process of the trilogy has been something like the unfolding of psychoanalysis. The parts or chapters are less like stories than essays, less like essays than poems, and finally most like pieces of music, partitas for solo violin. The title chapter of Stories from My Life with the Other Animals serves as an example of McConkey's technique. It is in eight sections, each relating some story about an animal or animals in order to arrive at some larger truth, while at the same time showing a fiction writer's care for the details, where God resides. Section I, "Americans in Italy," features a spaghetti-eating cat named Monster who amuses the McConkeys but dies of worms and neglect. On one occasion the youngest McConkey son sees a man kill a rabbit for the family's dinner by driving a pointed stake through its eye. The author is also appalled that the Italians shoot and kill songbirds to eat. Finally he observes that they do not treat animals as comrades and that the value he himself places on animals has to do with his own culture. Section II, "My Bird," deals with a mockingbird, one of a couple, that perches on his study chimney to sing, but his cat Lucifer kills the male and the female mourns for his passing. McConkey's distress over this event makes him wonder if the Italian attitude toward animals isn't prefer? able to his own. The next section, "Anthropomorphism," returns to one of his central themes, his father's desertion, and he makes this spot of time shine with numinosity. He contrasts the grief his horse Smoky exhibits when his long-time paddock partner dies with his own grief the summer his father deserted his mother. During that summer he developed a deep friendship with a German shepherd named Bruin. He gladly admits that his love of animals is a form of anthropomorphism and that its source was Bruin. Another ongoing story of the trilogy is the attempt of his middle son, Cris, to make a success of a goat farm on the property of McConkey's farmhouse. Section IV, "Goats as a Test of Human Character," shows the storyteller's eye for detail. Frustrated with a newborn kid and ex? hausted from work, his son throws the baby animal against a wall,</page><page sequence="3">MARK JARMAN 333 injuring it. When they arrive at Cornell's clinic for large and small animals, McConkey provides the following scene: A mixture of rain and soft snow was falling, making it hard to see. The doors of the clinic were immense enough to permit the entry of the largest truck. Inside, it seemed a gigantic and immaculate barn, brightly illuminated. For some reason, a veterinarian, his white coat stained with blood or manure, was marching a cow back and forth. A blue-jeaned young woman was sleeping on some hay outside a stall; apparently the crisis with her horse was over, for the animal was peacefully munching. From another stall, a bull gazed at us. He was as immobile as the bronze memorial statue of a horse enclosed by a fence I once had seen in a Kentucky pasture. It turns out that acts of frustration like his son's are not uncommon among animal breeders, and the goat survives without a handicap. The following section, "Spiritual Love," includes another memory of Bruin, the Little Rock German shepherd. He tells the story of how Bruin, after a long absence, recognized him after sniffing his pants: "Excretory odors are the agents of memory in dogs, no doubt for Odysseus' Argus as well as my childhood companion." But remem? bering that act of recognition touches the wound of knowledge. It is clear that St. Augustine's Confessions serve as a model for McConkey's autobiography; the difference is that McConkey has no God to report to, to question and beseech in urgency as St. Augustine does. Still, because he feels "the ebbing of the once insatiable wanting that sometimes makes an unholy?and perhaps uniquely American? trinity of soul, sex, and possessions," he feels compelled to identify qualities that we would otherwise associate with religious feelings, spiritual love, and the soul. About the ag?d Bruin, his childhood friend, he writes, At sixty-nine, I know that the soul is a name for our unobtainable desires, and that as a child I made of Bruin a repository of a vast wanting that included my absent father but went beyond that to reach the stars?a mighty wish to reach a spiritual truth beyond my limited self, one that could end my isolation by merging me with the natural world and the mysteries of the universe. Section VI, "Wrath," relates McConkey's confrontation with a poacher who has set traps on his property that have resulted in injuries to two of his dogs and his cat. The poor poacher explains that he cannot afford Havahart traps and tells a story of personal loss that is miserable. Yet this section also includes an episode in which a friendship between a black labrador named Gandy and a three-legged cat, Grabber, comes to an end through no human fault. The penul? timate section, "The Road to the Veterinary Hospital," deals with the</page><page sequence="4">334 THE HUDSON REVIEW same labrador, this time a victim of a hit-and-run in front of their house. On the road once again to Cornell's animal hospital, McCon? key and his wife ride in the back of a truck with the injured animal. How strange it was, to be floating through the air like this in a pickup truck driven by a son, to be a white-haired professor kneeling next to an animal that might be dying, while one's wife for forty-five years knelt by the animal's other side, her hair blown back by the wind! Strange, but romantic, too. While on their way through the night they pass the place where a Columbian couple had run a goat farm until the barn caught fire and they left America, meeting fates full of pathos that mystify their neighbors. The dog does not die but only loses a leg, and the writer and his wife experience the evanescence of life. The final section of the piece tells of building a pond house and swimming with the accompaniment of the three-legged Gandy who "[l]ike the rest of us ... is as happy as she knows how to be." The 1982 preface to Court of Memory states, "We are what we are." It appears to be the truth that McConkey strives to come to terms with, as St. Augustine strove not to be what he was (a vile body), but what God made him to be. McConkey's stoicism is pragmatic, though it lacks St. Augustine's universality. Yet in his renderings of others, when McConkey steps out of the enclosure of his idylls, he achieves something on the order of his master, Chekhov. One of the motifs running through the trilogy which has a further resolution in Stories from My Life with the Other Animals is of a picnic with friends in Morehead, Kentucky, after McConkey had been hired at Cornell and knew that he and his family would be leaving. The friends include a man named P.C, the head of the theater depart? ment, and his wife. On the drive home, McConkey takes a country side road on a whim and finds a small church on the bank of a shallow stream which he fords. Inside the church, which is empty, the friends find a piano and P.C. plays while they sing hymns. It is a moment of serenity and fellow feeling. Yet the transcendent experience that McConkey records has to have been affected by the knowledge that he was soon to escape the grind of teaching at Morehead. In an earlier paragraph he captures the drudgery and camaraderie of life teaching English at a small state college where most of one's students are marginally literate. As the friends sang, the liberated McConkey felt, "I was nothing but a voice that merged in melody with other voices." The final chapter of Stories of My Life with the Other Animals is entitled "An Ode for St. Cecilia's Day" and expresses much of McConkey's feeling for music, including the story of singing in the country church. But after recalling that scene, McConkey sticks with the fates of the people there, especially P.C. and his wife. P.C.'s wife Linda suffered from hypertension and died after a series of strokes. A son</page><page sequence="5">MARK JARMAN 335 she had given birth to suffered from a defect that stunted his growth. Semi-retired from teaching, McConkey and his wife take a trip to Florida to escape the tension of the Gulf War and visit their old friend P.C. and his son, who themselves long ago departed Kentucky. The two live most of the time in a womblike inner room of their house where the son weaves and the father reads and they watch TV. P.C. tells the McConkeys the story of his wife's strokes and her eventual death. After her first stroke he managed to teach her to speak again by singing to her. When she regained some rudimentary ability to speak, she could do so only if she sang. More strokes robbed her of the capacity to do even this, except to be able to sing her own name, on her deathbed. Now P.C, an elderly man like McConkey, living alone with his handicapped son, must look forward to his son's entrance into puberty, long delayed by his growth defect. The mystery and richness of life and the steadfastness in the face of adversity that McConkey tries often to put on the page achieve an ultimate success in this story. The greatest puzzle or paradox, since it is not to be resolved by me, is the sense of scale in this book and in the trilogy of which it is a part. The title of the trilogy comes from the tenth book of St. Augustine's Confessions, where he states, "All this takes place in the huge court of my memory." There is an epic dimension to the Confessions as St. Augustine tries to discover the fit between finite man and infinite God. McConkey also makes claims for the large scale of memory; for example, he writes in "Crossroads," For we grow by accretion?a pile of joy here and a pile of desolation there. The irrational intensity of our feelings in middle age comes from the awful size of the piles, and we're lucky if we can find in our minds some cathedral grand enough to hold them both. But what McConkey has found is not a cathedral but a house, the Greek revival farmhouse he bought in 1962 where he hoped to live out what he calls "the dream of rural sanctuary." There he has learned, since he does not seek a justification between himself and some infinite being, that "tonight is as far into the future as one's hopes or worries reasonably ought to go." Stories from My Life with the Other Animals and Court of Memory as a whole are moving for their human dimension, their finite size, but puzzling, too, because of an element of restraint that seems to limit their passion and urgency while at the same time speaking in larger terms. "Memory," McConkey believes, "is the human soul." And the human soul in these stories is not epic but domestic, manageable, and fits inside a house.</page></plain_text>
