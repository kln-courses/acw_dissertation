<plain_text><page sequence="1">Late Hïnayâna Buddhism and the Transition to Mahâyâna: A Study of the Early Buddhist Samgha and the Buddha Figures at Kanheri SURAJ A. PANDIT THE Kanheri caves, the more than one hundred caves situated in the vicinity of Mumbai，are one of the major monastic cave sites in western India. The site一with its architectural grace, epigraphical glory, and sculptural master pieces一tells the history of the Buddhism as existed there for more than a mil lennium. The history of Kanheri begins in the first century B.C.E. and is divided into three different phases based on the dynastic control there, as drawn from the epigraphical data from the site: Phase I: First century B.C.E. to fourth century C.E. Phase II: Fifth century to sixth century. Phase III: Seventh century to ninth century. During Phase One, the area was under the control of the Sâtavâhana dynasty. Phase Two can be labeled the Traikutaka-Maurya period.1 During Phase 1 Owing to the discovery of a copperplate mentioning the Traikutaka rule, this phase can be labeled as the Traikutaka period; however, there is some debate about the era in which the copperplate was produced. This is the period (i.e., the late fifth century C.E. [after the decline of the Vakatakas in Vidarbha] and early sixth century C.E.) allotted to the Konkan Maury as by some scholars. In light of this, the author has chosen to label this phase as the Traikutaka Maurya to avoid any controversy. 222</page><page sequence="2">PANDIT: LATE HÎNAYÂNA BUDDHISM Three, this region was mainly under the rule of the Râstrakutas and later the Silâhâras. Kanheri is surrounded by various ancient sites like Sopara, Kalyan，Thane, and Bassein. Chaul is also not far from Kanheri, on whose periphery we can see cave sites such as Magathane, Jivadhan，Lonad, Ambivali，and Kondivate (Mahakali). Only a few of these places are mentioned in the epigraphical sources from Kanheri. During the Sâtavâhana period, Sopara and Kalyan were the two main commercial centers，2 though the decline of the former as a port had already started due to the silting of ks waters, which in turn left Kalyan as the alternative port. These two centers were linked by a trade route, which proceeded to Junnar, Nasik, and then on to Paithan.3 There was another route from Sopara towards the fertile lands of the Ganga-yamuna and the north west region, via Bharuch. At one time, Kanheri was on an island adjacent to the Sopara region, known as Salsette (Sashti) Island, and was isolated from the mainland by the Bassein River. Kanheri was neither on an ancient trade route like the caves at Bhaja, Karle, Karad, nor was it in the vicinity of any particular trade center like the caves at Junnar. The main caitya {stùpà), i.e., Cave 3 at Kanheri, is located near the entrance of the site and is one of the most important caves in the whole complex. Architecturally, this cave represents a continuation of the tradition found at Karle and dates from the middle of the second century C.E. This date can be ascertained from an inscription by the donors, the two brothers Gajasena and Gajamitra, who donated the cave to the spiritual teachers of the Bhadrayânîya school. The inscription is one of the most important inscriptions that refer to a later Sâtavâhana king, Yajnasri Sâtakarni.4 Additionally, on a pillar in the courtyard outside this cave, there are two unique examples of Buddha figures in the Mathura style from the Kusâna dynasty, which are thought to be the earliest depictions in southern India of the Buddha in anthropomorphic form. The study of the rise of Mahâyâna as reflected in the art and architecture of western Indian Buddhist caves has been undertaken by various art histori ans. Nagaraju (1981) and later Dhavalikar (1984) have pointed out several 2 References to Sopara are found in the inscriptions in Caves 3，7，and 86; Kalyan is referred to in the inscriptions in Caves 32, 72，74，75，and 98 at Kanheri. 3 Nasik was an early capital of the Sâtavâhanas before Paithan. Reference to Paithan can be seen in an inscription in Cave 3 that dates from the second century C.E. 4 The reading of the line in the inscription is as follows: .. Ceti (ya...) âcâriyânam nikâ (yasa ... Bhâdâya) nîyânam." This reading is from Gokhale 1991, p. 51. 3 2 2</page><page sequence="3">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXVII,1 &amp; 2 changes in the cave architecture of this period. The latter has labeled this archi tectural phase as “late Hïnayâna," although it is difficult to relate it to a par ticular school or ideological revolution. The culture of the Deccan region is a synthesis of southern and northern Indian cultural streams, and this has added to the confusion as to where Mahâyâna originated. Traditionally, it is believed that the Mahâsânghikas promoted Mahâyâna concepts. However, the term Mahâsânghika was used in the inscriptions in western Indian Buddhist caves to denote a particular group of schools, and thus there are no inscrip tions that give us clues to the existence or location of an individual Mahâsânghika school. It is believed that there were two schools, each with its own system of logic, that brought drastic changes to Buddhist thought— the Sarvâstivâdin and the Ekavyâvahârika.5 There are no specific references to these two schools in any of the inscriptions in western Indian Buddhist caves in the early years of the Common Era, and therefore we are unable to understand the exact process of transition from Sthaviravâdin to Mahâyâna. However, Kanheri, being one of the major cave complexes in India, preserves some data that can shed light on this issue. In this paper, I will focus on the above-mentioned inscription that refers to Yajnasrï Sâtakarni. I will also cover the Bhadrayânïya, a Sthaviravâda school, and the two Buddha figures found in Cave 3, which are from the same peri od as the inscription, and their appearance in southern India is striking. Here, therefore, an attempt will be made to clarify the transition from early Buddhism to “late Hïnayâna" Buddhism at Kanheri. During the lifetime of the Buddha, attempts were made to divide the samgha by monks like Devadatta.6 With the death of the Buddha, the samgha lost not only its spiritual teacher but also an able leader (samgha-pramukha). This unstable time compelled the monks to begin to make changes in the rules and regulations for the samgha resulting in the convening of the First Council. There, the tripitakas were compiled under the supervision of elder monks. The Second Council, held at Vaisâlï one hundred years after the death of the Buddha, was important in the course of the development of Buddhism and the Buddhist schools. Here, the first split of the samgha into the orthodox Sthaviravâda school and the liberal Mahâsânghika school occurred. The 5 Encyclopedia Indica, vol.27, pp. 554-6. 6 See "Culla-vagga" and "Samghabheda-khandhaka" of the Vinayapitaka. 224</page><page sequence="4">PANDIT: LATE HÏNAYÀNA BUDDHISM Council, which was formed to settle a dispute over the ten precepts in the Vinaya, took place between the 500 monks at Vaisâlî—liberal monks known as the Vajjiputtakas—and the monk who led the event, Yasa.7 Immediately after the Council, the monks of the Mahâsânghika also compiled their own tripitaka by making a few changes to the original literature.8 Later, these groups divided into various sub-groups. The ten controversial points were as follows:9 1.Singilona-kappa: The practice of carrying salt in a horn for use when needed, which, according to one view, contravened the rule against the storing of articles of food. 2. Dvangula-kappa: The practice of taking food after midday. (Literally, when the shadow is two digits wide.) 3. Gamantara-kappa: The practice of going to a neighboring village and taking a second meal there the same day, thereby committing the offence of overeating. 4. Àvâsa-kappa: The observance of uposatha in different places within the same parish. 5. Anumati-kappa: Doing an act and obtaining permission for it after wards. 6. Âcinna-kappa: Considering a teacher's word more authentic than the Vinaya. 7. Amathita-kappa: The drinking of milk after meals. 8. Jalogi-pâtum: The drinking of fermented palm-juice that has not yet turned to alcohol. 9. Adasakam-nisïdanam: The use of an unhemmed sheet to sit on. 10. Jâtarûpa-rajatam: The acceptance of gold and silver. Others, such as Dutt, also attribute this first rift in the samgha to Mahâdeva's “five articles of faith," which devalued the level of enlightenment attained by arhats.10 7 A detailed account of the Vajjiputtakas of Vaisâlî, their opposition to the precepts, and their arguments following the Second Council also appear in the "Culla-vagga" in the "Sattasatika-khandhaka" of the Vinayapitaka (Kaushalyayana 1994，pp. 548-58). 8 Dïpavamsa (Sinh 1996a，p. 71). 9 Ibid., pp. 66-67, and also Dutt 1980，p. 125.

Until the Maury an dynasty, a further sub-division can be seen. The Vàtsïputrïyâ school divided into Dharmottara, Bhadrayânïya, Channagirika, and Sâmmitïya schools. The Mahïsâsaka school divided into the Dhar maguptaka and Sarvâstivâdin schools. The Sarvâstivâdin school further divided into the Kâsyapïya, Sankatïya, and Sautrântika schools. The Kaukulika school also later divided into the Prajnaptivâdin, Bahusrutïya, and Caitika schools. According to the Mahâvamsa, after the third century B.C.E., six more schools appeared in India: the Haimavata, Râjagiriya, Siddhâthika, Purvasaila, Aparasaila, and Vajiriya schools.11 As stated above, the schools that were offshoots of the Mahâsânghika school are not mentioned individually in the Sâtavâhana inscriptions from Nasik and Karle. We now move to the division of the Mahâsânghika school as given by the northern Indian tradition. As we saw from the information in the Mahâvamsa, the Mahâsânghikas divided into the Kaukulika and Ekavyâvahârika schools. The Kashmiri tradition gives us a different division, with the Mahâsânghika school dividing into the Lokottaravâdin, Aparasaila, Purvasaila, and Uttarassaila schools.12 After comparing the Mahdvamsa and the northern Indian account, Dutt makes the following classification:13 A comparison of the different lists of schools shows that their groupings are largely consistent. The Mahâsânghika branches may be classified into two groups: The earlier (or the first) group comprised the original Mahâsânghika, Ekavyâvahârika, and Caitika一or Lokottarâvadin一schools. According to Târanâtha [a priest-scholar born in Tibet in the sixteenth century], the Ekavyâvahârikas and the Mahâsânghikas were almost identical. The chief center of their group was at Pâtaliputra. The later (or the second) group came into existence long after the Mahâsânghikas_ they became widely known as the Saila一or Andhaka—schools14 11 See the Mahàvamsa (Sinh 1996b), vols.11 and 12. 12 Dutt 1987, pp. 48-49. 13 Ibid., pp. 48-56. 14 According to the Kathàvatthu, the Vetulyakas and the Hetuvâdins should be added to the Andhakas. 226</page><page sequence="6">PANDIT: LATE HlNAYÀNA BUDDHISM and made their chief center at Amarâvati and Nagarjunikonda. The Bahusrutïya and Prajnaptivâdin schools may be placed in this group, as they agreed more with the doctrines of the Saila rather than the Mahâsânghika schools. In addition to these two groups, Dutt also notes three others:15 The third group is formed by the earlier Mahïsâsakas, the Sar vâstivâdins，and the later-period Mahïsâsakas, Dharmaguptakas, Kâsyapïyas, Samkrântivâdas or Uttarâpathakas or Tâmrasatiyas. The fourth group comprised the Vâtsïputriyas, along with the Dharmottara, Bhadrayânïya, Channagirika, Sâmmitïya, and Kaurukullaka schools. In this group, practically all the schools merged into one school, namely, the Vâtsîputriya school, otherwise known as the Sâmmitïya school. The fifth and last group, but the earliest in origin, was the Sthaviravâda, which, as Vinitadeva says, formed a group with the Ceylonese sects, namely, the Jetavaniyas, Abhayagirivâsins, and Mahâvihâravâsins.16 In addition to the controversy over the Vinaya, there are other factors that may have contributed to the split of the samgha. After the death of the Buddha, his followers gathered around noted elder monks. The Buddha in fact had encouraged this.17 These elders were known for their attainment in certain aspects of the Dharma. For example, Sâriputra was known for his high attain ment of wisdom, and Mahâmaudgalyâyana was known as the foremost pos sessor of miraculous powers.18 In time, the followers of these elder monks formed their own groups. Interestingly, these groups are mentioned in the epi graphical data from the western Indian caves. According to Gokhale,19 an inscription in Cave 3 at Nasik records information about the followers of Mahâmaudgalyâyana and refers to the cave as the "Cave-monastery of the Possessor of Miraculous Powers." The copperplate found at Kanheri refers to the name of Sâriputra, and the site reveals the presence of a succession of teachers there in the form of memorial stupas. Gokhale has also pointed out 15 Ibid. 16 Ibid., pp. 48-56. 17 In the Vinayapitaka, the Buddha established rules regarding the number of students under âcâryas. See Kaushalyayana 1994，pp.110 ff. 18 Ibid, p. 112. 19 Gokhale 2004, pp. 298-310. 227</page><page sequence="7">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXVII,1 &amp; 2 that Cave 3 at Nasik comprises twenty cells, which suggests that the site had a bhikkhu samgha capable of performing all the official acts specified by the Vinaya.20 Gokhale has attributed the cave sites in Nasik and Kanheri to the Bhadrayânïya school, as epigraphical data from the sites seem to suggest the existence of the school in that area. In the case of Kanheri, however, there is a gap of at least three centuries between the inscriptions that refer to Sâripu tra and the inscriptions that refer to the Bhadrayânïya school. And in the case of Nasik, the presence of a sizable samgha, which Gokhale notes, is not restricted to only the Bhadrayânïya school. The word "mahiddhika" is significant here，21 as it appears in the same inscription from Nasik where the term Bhadrayânïya is found. As we saw in the split between the Sthaviravâdins and the Mahâsânghikas, one of the major points of contro versy was considering one's teacher's words more authentic than the Vinaya. It is quite possible that this was due to the influence of the Mahâsânghikas in the Deccan region. As we know from the Karle inscription by King Gautamiputra Sâtakarni (grandfather of Yajnasri Sâtakarni), royal patronage was given to the Mahâsânghikas during his reign. One of the Nasik cave inscriptions records the donation by a lay follower of a cave for memorial stupas (caityas)}1 which suggests that the Mahâsânghikas were popular in that region. The lineage of teachers must have become important under the Mahâsânghikas. In a later period (c. the second century C.E.), we can see monolithic memorial stupas of teachers in the stiipa gallery at Bhâjâ. After the rise of Karle, Bhâjâ, which is not far from Karle, was a prominent Mahâsânghika center in the first century C.E. The same tradition existed at Kanheri. There, Cave 4，which can be stylistically and paleographically dated to the second century C.E.，contains a stiipa donated by the lay follower Sivapâlitanikâ to the âcârya Dhammapâla. Socio-political forces hindered the division of the samgha during the Mauryan period. The Asokan edicts on the pillars at Sârnâth, Kausambi, and 20 Ibid., also see the Vinayapiîaka, Mahâ-vagga, Campeyya-khandhaka (Kaushalyayana 1994，pp. 303-5). 21 This word occurs in an inscription at Nasik by the Sâtavâhana king, Vâsisthiputra Pulumavi. The cave is known as devi lena. Another inscription in the same cave records the donation of the village Sudarsana to the Bhadrayânïya samgha. Mirashi (1979，pp. 44-46) translates this word as “precious.，， 22 Luders’ list no. 1130. 228</page><page sequence="8">PANDIT: LATE HÎNAYÀNA BUDDHISM Sânchi prohibit causing division in the samgha. The translation of the minor pillar edict at Sânchi is as follows: Whoever causes the sangha to divide, whether monk or nun, shall be compelled to wear white garments and to live in a non-residence {anivâsi i.e., where there is no residence). It is my desire that the sangha be united and endure for ages.23 The unity of the samgha during the Mauryan period might also have been due to the popularity of Buddhism itself. The rise in the popularity of Buddhism among the masses created a necessity to maintain the image of the samgha. Another important development in Buddhism during this period was its transition towards a new phase, i.e., the early Mahâyâna of Nâgâijuna. Early Buddhist philosophy had taken in new liberal elements during its process of sectarian development一the whole philosophical foundation was on the eve of a new interpretation. We have seen in the inscriptions from Nasik and Karle how the Sâtavâhana king, Gautamiputra Sâtakarni, gave patronage to the Mahâsânghikas. How ever, not a single inscription of this king refers to a specific Mahâsânghika school. Reference to the Bhadrayânïya school can be seen in the Nasik inscrip tion by King Vâsisthiputra Pulumavi. The lack of references to tms school suggests that it was not so popular in western India after the Sâtavâhana dynasty. The Bhadrayânïya school is also referred to in the inscriptions in Caves 3 and 50 at Kanhen/4 The Bhadrayânïya school appears as a sub-sect of the Vâtsïputrïyas, which was under the Sthaviravâda tradition. A northern Indian text of Bhâviveka mentions the sect by name.25 The dcârya Bhadrâyana was said to be its founder, and the sect was named after him.26 It is said in the Dïpavamsa that tms school arose during the two centuries after the Buddha's death.27 According to the Mahàvamsa and the Dïpavamsa, the Bhadrayânïya school originated around the same time as the Andhaka school, and both 23 Srinivasa and Aiyangar 1951, pp. 120-25. 24 The donor of Cave 50 was an inhabitant of Kalyàn，and by comparing his inscription with one in Cave 98，we can see that the donor was the bhojiki (wife of a provincial governor) of Konkan. 25 Shastri 1965. 26 Nagaraju 1981, pp. 33-34. 27 Mirashi 1979，p. 122. 229</page><page sequence="9">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXVII,1 &amp; 2 existed during the Mauryan period.28 Although there is little information about this school, we can infer that it was popular in the Deccan region in the early centuries of the Common Era and that it received considerable royal patronage under the Sâtavâhanas. However, there is no reference to this school in Fa-hien's or Huen-tsiang's accounts. Cave 3 at Kanheri, which is the main caitya at the site, was under Bhadrayânïya influence. Here, we can see the ways in which the Buddha was revered in symbolic form. On the tops of the pillars in the main hall, the Buddha is depicted in the form of footprints, a stùpa, and a seat. The cave itself contains a large stùpa, as it is a caitya cave. This cave also contains one of the earliest images in western India of the Buddha in the Mathurâ style of the Kusâna dynasty.29 These two images are on a pillar in the outside courtyard. One other figure once stood on a pillar in the main hall of the caitya, as there are two broken attendant figures there similar to those in the courtyard. Owing to the weathering of the rock, the fig ure inside no longer exists. The figures in the courtyard are placed on the col umn of the pillar, which is divided into two horizontal parts by an abacus-like base of the upper figure. The lower figure is in a standing posture (sthânaka), while the upper one is in a seated posture (àsana). The fact that a similar place ment of pillars was found in the courtyard of the caitya cave at Karle suggests that this was an important feature in caitya architecture. The pillar at Karle is reminiscent of the great pillars of Asoka. Why were so many pillars erected, and what was their symbolism? Numerous panels from various sites depict the worship of the Buddha in the symbolic form of a pillar. Many of these panels offer interesting evidence of the use of "Dharma wheels" (dharma-cakra) for the crown of the pillar. The Asokan and Karle pillars also belong to this same tradition. In the caitya cave at Karle, one of the pillars is a small replica of a pillar on which a wheel is depicted. This wheel has a depiction of the Three Jewels on it, which rep resents the Dharma wheel. The pillars in the courtyard at Kanheri are inferior copies of the Karle pil lars. Here, the pillars have capitals depicting lions and dwarves. Although nothing remains on the tops of these pillars, we can speculate that Dharma wheels一possibly made of wood一were placed on the capitals. All these ele ments suggest the significant position of the pillars in the plan of the caitya cave at Kanheri. 28 Davids 1978. 29 Leese 1970, pp. 83-93. 230</page><page sequence="10">PANDIT: LATE HlNAYÀNA BUDDHISM Artists must have traveled to Kanheri through the Ksatrapa territory, as the art in the caves reveals an affinity for Shaka art. The region also had contacts with Mathurâ, as the Buddha figures are in the Mathurâ-Kusâna style. A depiction of Bactrian camels can be seen on the capital of the first pillar in the main hall, as well as on the railing at the entrance to the cave一thus con necting this region to the Silk Roaa in the northwest. Kanheri was accessible only through Mathurâ, which was a major political and economic center in India. At that time, the Mathurâ region was under the influence of various Mahâsânghika schools. The Mahàsàfighikâs，with the royal patronage of the Sâtavâhanas, had already been successful in establishing their school in northern Konkan (Aparânta).30 It is believed that the Mahâsânghikas were responsible for introducing idol worship into Buddhism. In this period, Buddhism became a religion of the common people. Religions often become ritualistic when this happens, as it is difficult to convey more profound philosophical teachings to all classes of society. Buddhism divided into a religion of intellectuals一which was more focused on the Buddha's teachings and their philosophical interpretation一and a religion of the masses, which was more ritualistic. The focus on ritual might have introduced the "devotional" (bhakti) element into Buddhism, thus leading to the rise of image worship. It cannot be just a coincidence that the two Buddha figures at Kanheri were found in the same cave as the inscription that refers to the Bhadrayânïyas. This Sthaviravâda school might have accepted the practice of idol worship, which is thought to have been spread by the more liberal Mahâsânghika school. Indeed, it is quite likely that the Sthaviravâda and Mahâsânghika schools influenced each other. Another important thing we know about the inscription is that it is the last known inscription referring to the Bhad rayânïyas. As this school started accepting liberal ideas—likely due to the demands of the masses—it might have merged with another school, most like ly the Mahâsânghikas. An important feature of the samgha at Kanheri in the second and third centuries C.E. was its preservation of the lineage of teachers in the form of memorial stupas. There are other inscriptions referring to donations of caves, cisterns, etc. by nuns to the samgha, and they specifically state the names of tneir teachers in these inscriptions.31 As noted in Part One of this paper, 30 See the inscriptions of Gautamiputra Sâtakarni from Nasik and Karle. 31 See the inscriptions in Caves 22, 54, and 65 (Gokhale 1991). -- 3 2</page><page sequence="11">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXVII，1 &amp; 2 considering one's teacher's words more authentic than the Vinaya {âcinna kappa) and the acceptance of gold and silver {jatarupa-rajatam) were two main points of controversy between the Sthaviravâdins and the Mahâsânghikas. At the Second Council, the elder Yasa and 500 liberal monks known to us as the Vajjiputtakas debated these points. In a later period, the orthodox Sthaviravâda (yisuddha theravâda) split into a branch called the Vâtsîputrîyas (Vajjiputtiyas). The Bhadrayânïya school is one of the sub schools of the Vajjiputtiyas. Is it a coincidence that the second split in the samgha was due to the Vajjiputtiyas, whose name is similar to the Vajjiputtakas, or did the name Vajjiputtiya have some other significance of which we are unaware? The Dharmottara is another school that belongs to the Vajjiputtiya group. There are two pillars at Karle donated by Bhayanta Dharmottara of Sopara. Were the Vajjiputtiyas prominent here in this region, which was surrounded by the Mahâsânghikas? All three sites一Karle, Nasik, and Kanheri—that mention the Vajjiputtiya schools in their epigraphs also mention the Mahâsânghikas. Is this just a coincidence or was there some relationship between these two schools? Is there any information about the rise and development of the Mahâsânghikas at the site of Kanheri? The Mahâsânghikas were popular among both royal families and commoners, and their presence in the region might have influenced the Bhadrayânîyas. It is believed that the Mahâsânghikas were responsible for the rise of the Mahâyâna, as they were more liberal. It is quite possible that the Bhadrayânîyas might have accepted the practice of idol worship on a practical—not philosophical一level. The inscription at Kanheri about the Bhadrayânîyas is the last epigraphical evi dence of this school. Except for in historical texts like the Dïpavamsa and the Mahàvamsa, there is no reference to this school in other literature. It is pos sible that they merged with the Mahâsânghika schools that became prominent here in later years. In the following period, the Mûlasarvâstivâda school became popular at the site.32 This school brought about revolutionary changes in Buddhism; however, these changes were made possible by the Bhadrayânîyas. 32 Although there is no epigraphical evidence referring to this school, there are numerous data that hint to its popularity in the region. 232</page><page sequence="12">PANDIT: LATE HÎNAYÂNA BUDDHISM Buddhist Schools Referred to in the Inscriptions of the Western Indian Caves The Mahâsànghika School Karle inscription of Gautamiputra Sâtakarni (first century C.E.).
