Based on in-depth interviews with intimate partner violence victims, I argue that believers accomplish monotheistic theodicy by performing imaginary face-work - or protective face-work on the behalf of significant imagined others - that saves God's face as a morally perfect being. Believers perform this imaginary face-work by con- structing accounts that portray God as morally innocent of their suffering. These accounts fall into three main types: (1) fidelity to a higher principle, (2) ultimate benefit, and (3) shifting blame. These accounts serve as new cognitions that resolve the cognitive dissonance and concomitant negative emotions believers experience because of their suffering. Overall, the findings and analysis contribute to sociological theory by further extending the concepts of face and face-work to imagined others. KEY WORDS: accounts; belief; culture; imaginary face-work; religion; theodicy. INTRODUCTION Suffering is a ubiquitous part of life. No matter people's personal characteris- tics or location in the social structure, they cannot escape experiencing some sort of suffering at some point in their lives. This suffering comes in many forms, from unexpectedly losing one's job despite years of hard work to losing loved ones to senseless acts of violence. Experiences of suffering trigger the need for those who hold religious beliefs to undertake theodicy. Coined by the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz in 1710, theodicy is the act of reconciling the existence of suffering with one's religious beliefs (Leibniz 1998[1710]; Trakakis 2005). Given the prevalence of suffering, accomplishing theodicy is an important task for members of most religions (Berger 1967; Weber 1978). However, accomplishing theodicy can be especially difficult for believers in a monotheistic God because, as Berger (1967:73) states, "if all rival or minor deities are radically eliminated, and if not only all power but all ethical values are ascribed to the one God who created all things in this or any other world, then . . .monotheism stands or falls with its capacity to solve the question of theodicy, 'How can God permit. . .?'" (see also Weber 1978:519). In other words, if a single 1 I would like to thank all the participants in this study and the domestic violence organizations that helped in recruiting them.

Theodicy was an important topic for early sociological theorists such as Weber (1978) and Berger (1967), and theodicy has garnered interest from some contempo- rary scholars (e.g., Hunter 1982; Moschella et al. 1997; Musick 2000; Simko 2012). Existing theory and research on theodicy primarily focuses on documenting abstract theodicean thought and its consequences. For example, both Weber (1978) and Berger (1967) focus on delineating "ideal types" of major strands of theodicean thought found in the various religions of the world, Hunter's (1982) work focuses on the theodicean thought found in evangelical Christian mass market texts, and Simko's (2012) recent work documents the theodicean thought used to make sense of the events of 9/11. Moreover, Berger (1967) highlights the importance of theodi- cean thought for sustaining a meaningful subjective existence for individuals, and Moschella et al. 's (1997) and Musick's (2000) works investigate how individuals' endorsement of particular types of theodicean thought are related to their health and subjective well-being, respectively. While knowledge of abstract theodicean thought is important for understand- ing theodicy and its consequences, the focus on this thought has taken attention away from understanding the active cognitive processes involved in performing the act of theodicy. Previous scholars tend to conflate theodicean thought with the- odicy itself; however, theodicy is an act. It is important to distinguish theodicean thought - which consists of fixed arguments and knowledge claims that are often abstracted from personal experience - from the act of theodicy - which is the dynamic, deliberate, and conscious cognitive actions individuals undertake to rec- oncile their religious beliefs with experiences of suffering. Theodicean thought is the outcome of the act of theodicy, and thus theoretical understanding of how individu- als accomplish theodicy contributes understanding as to why theodicean thought takes the particular forms that it does. In this article, I apply Goffman's (1967) ideas about face and face-work to the cognitive realm to explicate the active cognitive processes involved in accomplishing the act of monotheistic theodicy. I argue that individuals accomplish monotheistic theodicy by performing what I call imaginary face-work. Imaginary face- work consists of cognitive acts of protective face-work - or actions taken to save the face of others - on the behalf of imagined others. I further argue that "accounts" - or arguments that justify or excuse face-threatening conduct (Scott and Lyman 1968) - are the means by which believers carry out this imaginary face-work. Using various ideas and concepts from popular American religious culture - such as the ideas of God-granted free will, sin, and the figure of Satan - believers construct accounts that portray God as morally innocent of their suffering, thus saving God's face as a morally perfect being. The outcome of this imaginary face-work is new cognitions - in the form of face-saving accounts - that help believers reestablish cognitive consistency and thus provide relief from the cognitive dissonance elicited by their suffering. Using data from an in-depth interview project in which I asked intimate partner violence victims how they reconciled their experiences of abuse with their continued belief in God, I find that the accounts believers use to perform</page><page sequence="3">Monotheistic Theodicy 875 the imaginary face-work of theodicy fall into three main types: (1) fidelity to a higher principle , (2) ultimate benefit , and (3) shifting blame. Overall, the findings and analysis not only advance understanding of the phenomenon of theodicy, but also theoretically extend Goffman's concepts of face and face-work to the cognitive phenomena of imagined others. FACE-WORK, THEODICY, AND SAVING IMAGINED OTHERS' FACES Surveys show that most Americans believe in God and regularly interact with this deity through prayer (Chaves 2011; Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life 2008). For many, God is an other who provides them with a variety of actual and perceived benefits, such as existential security, meaning to life, religious identity, subjective well-being, emotional support, worldly rewards (e.g., financial windfalls), and "otherworldly" rewards (e.g., eternal life) (Baker 2008; Berger 1967; Chong 2006; Norris and Inglehart 2004; Pollner 1989; Sharp 2010; Stark and Finke 2000; Weber 1978). Because of the benefits individuals receive through their belief in God, it is subjectively very important to maintain their belief in such a deity. Personal experiences of suffering, however, represent a cognitive challenge to the continued belief in a God who is supposedly omnipotent and morally perfect. Believers respond to this challenge by accomplishing theodicy, which they do by performing imaginary face-work. Face , Face-Work, and Accounts Goffman (1967:5) defines "face" as the "positive social value a person effectively claims." In other words, face refers to the positive view an individual wishes others to have of her. For example, the face of a college professor is one of intelligence and mastery of the knowledge of her field. According to Goffman (1967:19), face is a "sacred thing," with individuals performing a variety of ritualis- tic and strategic actions in order to sustain their faces. Individuals are "in face" when the face they claim is consistent with their actions and when others honor their face. Faces are "only on loan" from others, however, and others can withdraw this loan, so to speak, if they receive information that conflicts with or discredits an individual's face (Goffman 1967:10). When this occurs, individuals are "in the wrong face." For instance, if a college student discov- ers through questioning during a lecture that a professor does not actually know the material she is teaching very well, the professor is in the wrong face. When individuals are in the wrong face or experience the threat of being in the wrong face, individuals perform "face-work," or corrective actions that help individuals remain in face. Goffman (1967) distinguishes between "defensive" and "protective" face-work. Defensive face-work is face-work individuals perform to save their own face, while protective face-work is face-work individuals perform to save another's face. According to Goffman, individuals will perform face-work even for other individuals who are in the wrong face or at risk of being in the wrong face yet take no actions to save their own face. As Goffman (1967:27) writes,</page><page sequence="4">876 Sharp When a face has been threatened, face-work must be done, but whether this is initiated and primarily carried through by the person whose face is threatened, or by the offender, or by a mere witness is often of secondary importance. Lack of effort on the part of one person induces compensative effort from others. According to Goffman (1967:10), individuals engage in protective face-work on behalf of others because of "emotional identification" with those who are in the wrong face; when individuals experience negative emotions such as embarrassment due to being in the wrong face, copresent others also feel these emotions. As Goffman (1967) and other scholars (e.g., Hunter 1984; Scott and Lyman 1968; Stokes and Hewitt 1976) have shown, individuals have a variety of tools and strategies at their disposal to accomplish protective face-work. One such tool - and the one most important for the present analysis - is "accounts." According to Scott and Lyman (1968), an account is an argument individuals construct to mitigate or neutralize the impact face-threatening conduct has on individuals' faces. Scott and Lyman differentiate between two general types of accounts: "excuses" and "justifi- cations." Excuses, on the one hand, are arguments "for mitigating or relieving responsibility when conduct is questioned" (p. 47). Justifications, on the other hand, are arguments that "neutralize an act or its consequences when one or both are called into question" (p. 51). While individuals use accounts to lessen the impact of questionable conduct on their own faces, individuals also use accounts to save the faces of others. For instance, one might try to account for a respected coworker's recent lack of productivity as due to lack of sleep caused by caring for a newborn child (an excuse) or because the coworker has decided to devote less time to work so that he can devote more time to his family (a justification). Imaginary Face- Work Goffman's analysis of face and face-work focuses on concrete, human actors in social interactions. Here I argue that concepts of face and face-work also apply to the cognitive realm in the case of "imagined others." Recent theoretical trends in social psychology have brought attention to the importance of imagined others - such as cherished television and movie characters; admired celebrities and public figures one has never met; deceased relatives and friends; and, most importantly for the present analysis, deities and other supernatural beings - for individuals (e.g., Cerulo 2009; Epley and Waytz 2010; Sharp 2010). According to several scholars, individuals treat imagined others as they do concrete, human others. Individuals' interactions with imagined others often mimic interactions with concrete others (Caughey 1984; Cerulo and Barra 2008; Giles 2002; Horton and Wohl 1956; Sharp 2010), and individuals believe that imagined others have similar motivations, goals, emotions, and other mental states as concrete others do (Barrett 1998; Barrett and Keil 1996; see Cerulo 2009 and Epley and Waytz 2010 for reviews). Given that individuals act toward imagined others as they do concrete others, I argue that individuals will treat imagined others as if they have and wish to maintain face. Thus, when receiving information that threatens the faces they have of imagined others, individuals will reconcile this information by performing pro- tective face- work on behalf of these imagined others. To distinguish this face- work</page><page sequence="5">Monotheistic Theodicy 877 from protective face-work on behalf of concrete others present in face-to-face social interactions, I call this imaginary face-work. As with concrete others, individuals act toward imagined others as if they have face. The faces of imagined others consist of individuals' beliefs and ideas about the positive ways these others would want to be or should be viewed. Individuals' cog- nitions about the faces of imagined others come from a variety of sources, such as memories of previous interactions with the now imagined other (e.g., a deceased spouse), observations of the imagined other (e.g., watching a television interview with a favorite celebrity or cherished politician), and cultural socialization (e.g., deities). As with protective face-work on behalf of concrete others, emotions provide the motivation for undertaking imaginary face-work. However, for imagined oth- ers this motivation does not come from "emotional identification" but from expe- riences of cognitive dissonance (Festinger 1957; see also Harmon-Jones and Mills 1999; Tavris and Aronson 2007). When individuals receive information that threatens the faces they have of imagined others, they experience cognitive disso- nance and concomitant negative emotions such as anger, agitation, and embar- rassment. To relieve this dissonance, individuals will perform protective face- work on behalf of these imagined others. Individuals perform this face-work by con- structing accounts that neutralize the impact face-threatening information has on these imagined others' faces. Consequentially, these accounts act as new cogni- tions that reestablish cognitive consistency and thus provide relief from cognitive dissonance. For instance, consider a deceased wife who has a loving, kind, and caring face in the mind of her widower. If the widower hears rumors that his wife's employees viewed her as uncaring because of the way she treated them, this will cause the widower to experience cognitive dissonance and concomitant nega- tive emotions because such information threatens the face he has of his wife. To alleviate these feelings, the widower constructs accounts that neutralize the impact this information has on his deceased wife's face, such as telling himself that his wife's role as boss forced her to act uncaringly toward her employees. By saving his deceased wife's face by creating an account for her face-threatening behavior, the widower has created new cognitions - in the form of accounts - that relieve him of the cognitive dissonance caused by the reception of the face-threatening information. The Imaginary Face-Work of Monotheistic Theodicy Most believers in God believe that this being should be viewed as a morally perfect being who would not let individuals suffer needlessly or unjustly. Survey responses bear this out; for instance, the Baylor Religion Survey (2005) finds that around 82% of believers in God report that the adjective "just" describes God somewhat or very well (see also Greeley 1989; Kunkel et al. 1999; Noffke and McFadden 2004; Spilka, Armatas, and Nussbaum 1964). This belief is due to cul- tural and religious socialization; the Bible contains several passages that highlight God's moral infallibility (e.g., "There is no God apart from me, a righteous God" [Isaiah 45:21]), and socialization agents such as parents and religious leaders teach</page><page sequence="6">878 Sharp individuals that God should be viewed as morally perfect and as the ultimate source of human morality. Personal experiences of suffering represent information that threatens God's face as a morally perfect being, causing believers to experience cognitive dissonance. To relieve this cognitive dissonance, believers perform imaginary face-work that saves God's face as a morally perfect actor. Using various ideas and concepts from popular religious culture - such as the ideas of God-granted free will, sin, and Satan - believers carry out this imaginary face-work by constructing accounts that either portray God's allowance of their suffering as morally legitimate or relieve God of responsibility for their suffering. The upshot of this imaginary face-work is that individuals create new cognitions - in the form of accounts - that restore cognitive balance and thus alleviate believers' experiences of cognitive dissonance. STUDY PARTICIPANTS, METHODS, AND ANALYSIS Study Participants I use data from an in-depth interview project that explores the impact religion has on the lives and experiences of intimate partner violence victims to develop the theory of monotheistic theodicy as an imaginary face-work accomplishment. I inter- viewed 62 women from a variety of religious affiliations and backgrounds who cur- rently or formerly experienced intimate partner violence perpetrated by their male partners or husbands. The interviews occurred between 2004 and 2008. My overall sampling strategy was "maximum variation" sampling (Lofland et al. 2006; Miles and Huberman 1994). The goal of this sampling strategy is to achieve maximum variation of types of personal religiosities to theorize if and how religious beliefs, practices, and values influence, and are influenced by, the experiences, decision making, and perceptions of victims concerning their abusive experiences. In this regard, I sought out maximum variation of religious affiliations common in the Uni- ted States. The overall sample is diverse along several dimensions. The average age of par- ticipants is 40.5; the youngest participant is 19 and the oldest is 72. In terms of race and ethnicity, 38 of the participants are white, 20 are black, 2 are Hispanic, and 2 are Asian. The social class status of participants, as measured by educational attain- ment, varies tremendously: 9 have less than a high school degree, 15 have a high school diploma or equivalent, 8 have an associate's or technical degree, 12 have completed some college (including some who are currently in college), 13 have col- lege degrees, and 5 have graduate or professional degrees. Five participants were still in intimate relationships with their abusive partners, while the rest had left or were in the process of leaving their abusive partners. In terms of religious affilia- tion,3 20 are evangelical Protestant, 10 belong to historically black Protestant churches and congregations, 6 are mainline Protestant, 10 are Catholic, 2 are Mor- mon, 10 claim no particular religious preference but claim religious and spiritual beliefs (including belief in an omnipotent and morally perfect God), and 4 have no 3 The typology of religious affiliations I use are based on those of Steensland et al. (2000) and Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life (2008) typologies.</page><page sequence="7">Monotheistic Theodicy 879 religious beliefs in particular and/or are avowed atheists. All names used for partici- pants in this article are pseudonyms. The participants in this study provide an excellent case for exploring how believers in an omnipotent and morally perfect God accomplish theodicy. Except for the atheists and agnostics in the sample,4 all of the participants believe in a God who is omnipotent and morally perfect. The participants who believe in God learned God had these attributes during their upbringing and reported having these beliefs before their experiences of intimate partner violence. Also, all the partici- pants experienced suffering in the form of physical, emotional, and/or sexual intimate partner violence. Participants admitted that they initially had trouble rec- onciling their experiences of violence with their beliefs about God, reporting that they asked themselves some variant of the question "Why did you let this happen to me, God?" The participants all "answered" this question in some way which allowed them to maintain their beliefs about God despite their experiences of suffer- ing. Thus, the answers participants developed for the question of why God allowed them to experience abuse provide rich data for exploring how individuals accom- plish theodicy. Methods I recruited participants from the middle Tennessee (n = 15), southern Wiscon- sin (n = 20), southern Alabama (n = 14), metropolitan Boston (n = 3), San Francisco Bay (n = 2), New York City (n = 6), metropolitan Philadelphia (n = 1), and Minne- apolis/St. Paul (n = 1) areas to ensure variety in the demographic and religious char- acteristics of the potential participant pool. I recruited participants (1) through domestic violence shelters and agencies, (2) by a research flyer, and (3) by having participants give the contact information of the author to other potential partici- pants. I used the last technique the least because using it as the main way to recruit participants would have made it difficult to achieve maximum variation of religiosi- ties. I informed the participants that I was a researcher who wanted to find out more about how their religious beliefs, practices, and institutions affected their experiences of intimate partner violence and, conversely, how their experiences of violence influenced their religious beliefs, practices, and relationships with religious institutions. I told participants that I was affiliated with a state university and that I was not affiliated with any religious organization or particular religious congrega- tion. Although I cannot provide an accurate response rate because of how I recruited participants, achievement of maximum variation of religious affiliations occurred using these recruitment techniques. I conducted semistructured in-depth interviews with all the participants of this study. I conducted face-to-face interviews with participants in southern Wisconsin, middle Tennessee, and southern Alabama, and I conducted telephone interviews with participants from metropolitan Boston, San Francisco Bay, New York City, 4 The atheists and agnostics in the sample are not included in the present analysis because all of these individuals did not believe in or questioned the existence of God before they entered their abusive rela- tionships. As such, these individuals did not experience a conflict between a belief in an omnipotent and morally perfect God and their experiences of suffering and thus felt no need to undertake theodicy.</page><page sequence="8">880 Sharp metropolitan Philadelphia, and Minneapolis/St. Paul. I noticed no appreciable dif- ferences in the detail, candidness, and overall quality of interview data between the face-to-face interviews and the telephone interviews. The interviews consisted of a variety of questions that assessed the participants' demographic and religious characteristics, childhood history, abuse history, per- sonal religious beliefs, and the various ways that their religious beliefs and institu- tions influenced their perceptions, experiences, and decisions regarding their abusive situations. The interviews also addressed their experiences with religious and secular domestic violence agencies and solicited advice for individuals currently experiencing partner abuse and for domestic violence agencies. To ensure the safety, confidentiality, and comfort of participants, face-to-face interviews occurred in a variety of locations of participants' choosing. These included public libraries, domestic violence shelters, fast-food restaurants, and the homes of participants. Face-to-face and telephone interviews occurred at various times chosen by partici- pants. I allowed participants to choose interview sites and times that would be the most convenient and safe for them. Most importantly for the present analysis, I asked participants questions about their beliefs about God and their experiences of reconciling their beliefs about God with their experiences of violence. In terms of beliefs about God, I asked participants to describe some of the characteristics they attributed to God; despite some variations in the personality traits they ascribed to this deity (e.g., loving, caring), all of the participants that are the focus of this analysis reported that they believed in a single God who is all-powerful and morally perfect. Later in the interview, I asked participants why they believed that God allowed them to suffer abuse. Stating the question in this general way (i.e., by referring to God without the use of adjectives such as morally perfect or omnipotent) ensured that participants' responses were not influenced by the question phrasing. Participants' responses to this line of questioning provide the data I use in the present analysis. Analysis I used qualitative inductive coding (Lofland et al. 2006; Strauss and Corbin 1998) to analyze the interview data. This method of data analysis is inductive in that it allows the researcher to develop theory from data rather than using data to test the merits of any particular theory. Although I created concepts to under- stand the data by adapting the preexisting theoretical concepts of face and face- work, I did not use these concepts to guide the collection of data. Rather, these concepts emerged as the best way to interpret the data during the coding process. Coding consists of sorting data "into various categories that organize it and render it meaningful from the vantage point of one or more frameworks or sets of ideas" (Lofland et al. 2006:200). I began coding by reviewing the interview tran- scripts for pertinent data concerning how participants reconciled their suffering with their belief in an omnipotent and morally perfect God. After pooling this data, I performed open coding, which consists of giving each segment of interview tran- scription a term or phrase that connotes a particular concept or theme. After this</page><page sequence="9">Monotheistic Theodicy 881 open-coding phase, I then focus coded the data. During focused coding, I identified the various properties and dimensions of the concepts and integrated them into the overall theoretical framework of imaginary face-work. SAVING GOD'S FACE The intimate partner violence victims I interviewed all experienced intense suf- fering through the actions of their intimate partners, whether it was hurtful physical violence, heartbreaking emotional violence, or horrific sexual violence. Despite these experiences of suffering, victims nevertheless retained their belief in an omnip- otent and morally perfect God which they held before they experienced abuse. Given that victims' belief in God gave them emotional support, existential security, and sense of worth during their abusive experiences (see Sharp 2010), it was impor- tant for victims to maintain their belief in such a God. Victims were able to retain their beliefs despite their suffering by performing imaginary face-work that saved God's face as a morally perfect being. They per- formed this imaginary face-work by using three different types of accounts: (1) fidel- ity to a higher principle, (2) ultimate benefit, and (3) shifting blame. Below I describe these accounts, explain how the logics behind them helped victims save God's face, and discuss what popular religious ideas and concepts victims drew upon to construct these accounts. Fidelity to a Higher Principle The idea that one of the most important gifts God has bestowed on humanity is the ability to make free choices that can influence the outcomes of one's life became a popular part of the American religious imagination during the Second Great Awakening in the first half of the nineteenth century (Butler, Wacker, and Balmer 2011; McLoughlin 1965). Most Americans today believe that people have free will (Nisbett 2003; Swidler 2001). For instance, the 1998 General Social Survey (GSS) found that around 61% of Americans believed that people "make their own fate" and only around 12% believed that people "can't change the course of their lives" (Smith et al. 2011). Many victims used the popular notion of God-granted free will to construct and use the fidelity to a higher principle justification to save God's face as a morally perfect actor. With this justification, victims told themselves that God had to allow them to experience suffering because to take actions to prevent this suffering would have caused Him to violate His commitment to a higher principle; in these cases, this higher principle was God-granted human free will. Victims who used the fidelity to a higher principle justification see God adhering to a particular hierarchy of eth- ics, with preserving free will higher in this ethical hierarchy than preventing individ- uals from suffering. Although victims believed that God did not want them to suffer, His hands were tied, so to speak, by His moral obligation to respect the free will He has granted to all humans. Consequentially, victims were able to justify God's inaction as morally appropriate because they believed that if God had taken</page><page sequence="10">882 Sharp actions to stop their suffering, He would have negated a human's ability to make free choices. There were two logics to the use of the fidelity to a higher principle justifica- tion. With the first logic, victims argued that God could not prevent their suffering because to do so would mean violating the free will of others, which in these cases were victims' abusive partners. For example, consider Janine, a 45-year-old white Church of Christ member. Janine experienced a great deal of suffering in the form of physical and emotional abuse by her husband. Despite these experiences of suf- fering, Janine retained her belief in a just God, a belief she learned during child- hood. She maintained this belief by developing a fidelity to a higher principle justification that saved God's face: We have free will. He gave us that a long time ago, Adam and Eve, you know. They had free will and they chose to pick from the tree in the Garden [of Eden]. And we pick and choose and make decisions in our life, and sometimes they're not always the right decisions. And, uh, my husband chose the wrong decision to abuse and physically mistreat and emotionally mistreat me. Marianne - a white Southern Baptist in her early 50s - also used the fidelity to a higher principle justification to save God's face. Marianne experienced almost two decades of physical and emotional abuse by her husband. Despite these experiences of suffering, Marianne still believed in the Judeo-Christian God she learned about during childhood. Marianne accomplished this by telling herself that even though God did not want her to suffer, He was unable to do anything to alleviate this suffering because to do so would violate her husband's free will: I believe that if He had, you know, His choice in it, that He would have never, I don't believe He wanted me to be abused. I don't believe He wanted my ex[-husband] to slap my children. I believe that was totally not what He wanted. But it did happen the way it did. . .because He's given, He's put us in a world of free choice. The second logic of the fidelity to a higher principle justification was that God could not prevent victims' suffering because He could not violate their free will. In these cases, victims believed themselves responsible for their suffering because they freely made decisions that eventually led to their suffering; in particular, victims argued their free choice to begin and/or remain in relationships with abusive part- ners is what caused their suffering. According to this logic, God cannot intervene in preventing individuals from making choices that will bring suffering upon them- selves because to do so would violate their free will. For example, Bella - a white Catholic in her mid-50s - saved God's face as morally perfect by claiming that she made the free decision to be with her abusive husband, a decision that God could not override: "I'm the person who put herself in it [the abusive relationship], because I'm the one who married the guy [abusive husband] and, things between us were deteriorating. That wasn't God." Celeste - a 23-year-old Hispanic Catholic - also saved God's face by using the fidelity to a higher principle account. While Celeste claims that she did not choose to be in an abusive relationship, she does claim that she made the free choice to remain in the relationship after the abuse began:</page><page sequence="11">Monotheistic Theodicy 883 As much as I believe that, that God is a higher power and that He does, like, oversee everything, we're still, I believe that I still have control over my own life, and I was depressed and I was in that relationship because I made a choice to be that way. You know, I didn't necessarily choose an abusive relationship, but once I was in it, I chose not to leave, you know. So I couldn't question, I can't question God for that, 'cause it was my own choice. For Celeste, God is morally blameless for her suffering because it was her own choices that led to her suffering, and God could do nothing to cause her to choose differently because to have done so would have been to violate her ability to have "control over" her life. According to Celeste, God has granted humans free will and has a moral obligation to respect it, even at the cost of individuals' suffering because of the poor choices they have freely made. Ultimate Benefit The idea that God allows individuals to suffer for a greater good is a common motif in popular religious culture. Several popular religious narratives exist wherein God allowed people to suffer for a greater good, such as the wandering of the Israel- ites in the wilderness after leaving Egypt, the blinding of Saul on the road to Damascus, and Jesus of Nazareth's crucifixion. Some victims drew upon this motif to construct another type of account to save God's face as a morally perfect actor: the ultimate benefit justification. This justification consists of the idea that God allows individuals to experience suffering because these experiences are ultimately beneficial in some way. Just as a physician sometimes has to inflict pain on a person for her physical well-being, God has to allow people to experience suffering because these experiences will be beneficial to either themselves or others. This justification works to save God's face by arguing that sometimes the most appropriate moral choice God can make is to allow individuals to experience suffering. There were two main logics behind the ultimate benefit justification. The first, and the most common, logic is that God allowed victims to suffer because it was beneficial to them in terms of personal maturation or emotional fulfillment. For example, consider Ariel, a 41 -year-old white Catholic. When asked why she believed God allowed her to suffer intimate violence, Ariel said that her experiences were a "test" from God that would make her a "stronger person": "I think [my suffering] was a test. . .it's made me, it's made me a stronger person. It's, um, I, I was too pas- sive before. Got to stand up for your rights. Got to stand up for yourself. Don't let people walk all over you." According to Ariel, she was too passive of a person before she met her abusive ex-husband. Her abusive experiences forced her to "stand up" for herself to protect her physical and emotional well-being, transform- ing her from a passive person to one who actively stands up for herself and for what she believes. For Ariel, this perceived positive transformation of her personality was the result of God letting her experience suffering, a belief that portrays God's allow- ance of her suffering as morally justified. Nancy - a 45-year-old Church of Christ member - also saved God's face by arguing that God allowed her to experience suffering in the form of violence because this suffering was an unfortunate side effect, so to speak, of a benefit God had bestowed upon her. Unlike Ariel, Nancy believed that her suffering was part of, as</page><page sequence="12">884 Sharp she put it, the "packaged deal" of being married to her abusive partner. When I interviewed Nancy, she was still married to her abusive husband. Despite her expe- riences of physical abuse at his hands, Nancy believes that God brought her abusive husband into her life for her benefit, in particular to provide her with a committed relationship that gave her emotional fulfillment: [My husband] was the one who made a commitment to marry me when there were, there was no one (sighs), I guess because of my, I don't know, something wrong with me. I didn't know who I was or what I was. But I couldn't somehow match up with somebody who was willing to make a permanent commitment. He was. And whenever there wasn't permanent commit- ment, it was like I was walking around lost, uh, emotionally, relationally. Uh, I desired that . . . I was this little girl in a grown-up body who didn't know what to do to fulfill herself. . . . Uh, you know, it's, it's not all roses. Uh, but it [the relationship with my husband] certainly stabi- lized me, and I didn't know what else would have done that. I was headed in a bad direction, a, a direction toward unhappiness - 'Cause (sighs) I was this little girl in a grown-up body who didn't know what to do to fulfill herself. The career wasn't doing it. I had a good one. I had no real substantial relationship I mean, our relationship's not all negative . . . According to Nancy, she was unhappy before she met her husband, and God responded to this unhappiness by bringing him into her life. Even though she admits that her relationship is "not all roses" because of the abuse, Nancy claims that her relationship with her abusive husband makes her happy and gives her ful- fillment by providing her with a "permanent commitment" that she had lacked before the relationship. The upshot is that Nancy believes God was morally justified in bringing her abusive husband into her life - thus saving His face as a morally per- fect being - because the relationship is ultimately beneficial for her because it makes her happy and gives her personal fulfillment despite the abuse. Estelle - a white evangelical in her mid-40s - also used the ultimate benefit jus- tification to account for why God allowed her to suffer. Estelle experienced both physical and emotional abuse perpetrated by her husband. During one particularly violent episode with her abusive husband, Estelle suffered a compound fracture in her leg that caused her a great deal of pain, and took years and many surgeries to heal. For a time, Estelle did not understand why God would allow her to suffer in this way, and she admitted to feeling angry toward God at times for these experi- ences. However, Estelle was able to maintain her perception of God's face as a mor- ally perfect being by telling herself that God allowed her to experience suffering to teach her that she needed to start relying on Him and not on herself: I just kept, I couldn't understand why, why He was letting me go through that, why He wouldn't heal my leg, you know. Yeah, I'd get angry. . .but I, what I know now, what He was teaching me is to rely on Him instead of me. Because as soon as I quit relying on myself, that's when life got better. Whenever I try to do my life the way I want it, it gets messed up and it's painful. But if I do it the way God wants it, and to His glory, then He blesses me for it in my life. According to Estelle, she was living a life not for God - which she believes now brings her many blessings - but rather for herself. Because of this, God allowed her to suffer so that she would start living a life for God. The second logic behind the ultimate benefit justification is that God allowed victims to suffer for the future benefit of others. In these cases, victims believed that God allowed them to experience suffering so that they could use these experiences</page><page sequence="13">Monotheistic Theodicy 885 of suffering to help others in the future, in particular, other victims of intimate part- ner violence. For example, consider Rhonda, a black Pentecostal in her mid-40s. Rhonda lived with her abusive boyfriend for over 10 years. Throughout the rela- tionship, Rhonda experienced a tremendous amount of unpredictable physical and emotional abuse. Rhonda's partner also threatened her with death on numerous occasions. According to Rhonda, these experiences of suffering were part of God's plan for her to become a supporter of intimate partner violence victims and to advo- cate against this violence, which was her career at the time of the interview: I feel that God spared my life for a reason. And I feel that my witness has to be, it has to be told All that I endured, all that I went through, I mean, it was nothing for me to get up and he'd be shouting in my face I believe that God brings us to a point in our lives so that we can reach back and help somebody else. Thus, Rhonda saved God's face as a morally perfect being with the account that God allowed her to suffer to help others. Shifting Blame The final account developed by victims to save God's face was the shifting blame excuse. The shifting blame excuse relieves God of the responsibility for indi- viduals' suffering by placing the causal blame for this suffering on some actor other than God. Overall, victims shifted blame for their suffering onto one of two actors: themselves and Satan. Several victims believed that they were responsible for their suffering because of perceived moral transgressions they had made in the past. According to this logic, God punishes people for their moral transgressions, or sins, by allowing them to suffer, a common motif in American religious culture. Just as it is not the execu- tioner but the executed who is the ultimate cause of an execution, it is the sufferer herself, rather than God, who is the ultimate cause of any suffering experienced. This excuse saves God's face as a morally perfect being by arguing that God's allowance of suffering is morally appropriate because suffering is a just penance brought on by the immoral behavior of the sufferer. Victims who shifted blame for their suffering onto themselves because of their moral transgressions cited several types of transgressions they committed for which God allowed them to suffer. For example, Georgia - a 42-year-old black Baptist - said that God allowed her to suffer because she "figured this was a punish- ment in my life." She followed by saying that God was punishing her by allowing her to experience abuse because of sins she had committed in the past, particularly misdemeanor crimes she committed during childhood. Helga - a 22-year-old mainline Protestant - and Desiree - a 60-year-old black Pentecostal - expressed a similar belief. Both Helga and Desiree believe that their experiences of abuse were a punishment from God because they had been neglecting their children and other family members. Shelia - a mainline Protestant in her mid-60s - believed that God allowed her to suffer abuse as punishment for an abortion that she had earlier in life. Finally, a small portion of victims saved God's face by shifting blame for their suffering onto the imagined other of Satan. Satan (or the Devil) is a key figure in</page><page sequence="14">886 Sharp Judeo-Christian mythology, often epitomizing evil and thought to do harm to indi- viduals in the empirical world. According to the GSS, about two-thirds of Ameri- cans believe in Satan (Smith et al. 2011). Victims drew upon this popular figure in the American religious imagination to save God's face when they experienced suf- fering, arguing that it was not God but rather Satan who caused this suffering. By placing the blame on Satan for their suffering, victims were able to reconcile their suffering with their perception of God as a morally perfect being. Amelia - a 40-year-old white Church of Christ member - saved God's face by shifting the blame for her suffering to the Devil. When asked why God allowed her to suffer physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her husband, Amelia stated, "The Devil's the one who does the punishing. The Devil's the one who puts the, uh, temptations in front of you, and, uh, the bumps in the road." For Amelia, these "temptations" and "bumps in the road" consisted of the urge to remain with her husband despite his abusive behavior. Joanna - a 44-year-old black Missionary Baptist - also used this account to save God's face. When asked why God allowed her to suffer, Joanna explained she thought the Devil brought her abusive partners into her life, not God. Thus, for both Amelia and Joanna, the idea of the Devil provided them with a figure on which they could place the blame for their suffering. By doing so, these victims shifted the blame for their suffering away from God, thus saving His face as a morally perfect being. DISCUSSION Heretofore, the cognitive process involved in accomplishing monotheistic theodicy has been relatively unexplored. In this article, I theorized and presented evidence that the cognitive process of monotheistic theodicy is one of imaginary face-work, or protective face- work on behalf of imagined others. Individuals accomplish imaginary face- work by constructing accounts (Scott and Lyman 1968) that neutralize face-threatening information. In the case of monotheistic theodicy, face-threatening information consists of experiences of suffering, and believers neutralize the impact this information has on God's face by constructing accounts that portray God as morally innocent of their suffering. Consequentially, these accounts serve as cognitions that alleviate believers' experiences of cognitive dissonance elicited by their experiences of suffering. To understand how believers in an all-powerful and morally perfect God accomplish theodicy, I applied Goffman's (1967) ideas about face and face- work to imagined others. Several theorists argue that interactions and relationships with imagined others such as God should be taken seriously. These scholars argue that interactions and relationships with imagined others have the same sorts of features, dynamics, and consequences for individuals as relationships and interactions with human, concrete actors do (e.g., Caughey 1984; Cerulo 2009; Epley and Waytz 2010; Sharp 2010). The analysis presented here supports this recent scholarship by arguing that individuals will often perform protective face-work on behalf of imag- ined others when these individuals receive information that threatens these others' faces.</page><page sequence="15">Monotheistic Theodicy 887 While the present analysis focuses on how individuals save God's face, I would argue that individuals also perform imaginary face-work when they receive infor- mation that threatens the faces of other important imagined others. For example, avid viewers of television programs often come to cherish the characters on these programs (cf. Giles 2002; Horton and Wohl 1956). When a cherished television character performs actions on the program that threaten the face viewers have of this character, fans of the character often perform imaginary face-work to save the character's face, such as telling themselves that the character performed the face-threatening action for the benefit of other characters on the program. The many Internet message boards devoted to particular television programs where avid viewers post the accounts they develop to justify particular characters' actions and decisions evidence this phenomenon. For another example, consider the President of the United States, an impor- tant imagined other for many individuals (the President is an imagined other for many because most people have never met and have no relationship with the President). Avid supporters of the President will often create accounts that justify and excuse information that threatens the face they have of the president, such as shifting the blame for a Democratic president's lack of promised progressive legislation onto a Republican-controlled Congress or accounting for his use of questionable military tactics to neutralize enemy combatants as due to his com- mitment to the higher principle of protecting American citizens. It is my hope that future researchers will evaluate if and why the imaginary face-work individu- als perform when receiving face-threatening information about other types of imagined significant others is similar and different to the imaginary face-work of theodicy. Goffman's (1967) work on face-work focuses on how individuals perform such work in face-to-face social interactions on behalf of themselves or others who are copresent in the interaction. However, given the "sacredness" of face and the social obligation to maintain it for self and significant others, individuals will also perform face-work on behalf of concrete significant others who are not immediately copres- ent in a particular social interaction. I argue that the psychological dynamics and processes of protecting the faces of nonpresent concrete others is the same as the psychological dynamics and process involved in protecting the faces of imagined others. During face-to-face interactions, individuals sometimes receive information that threatens the face of a concrete significant other who is not copresent in the interaction. Receiving this information causes individuals to experience cognitive dissonance and concomitant negative emotions, and these experiences elicit protec- tive face-work on behalf of the nonpresent concrete other. This protective face-work consists of constructing excuses and justifications that neutralize the impact the face-threatening information has on the nonpresent concrete significant other. For instance, if an individual hears unflattering comments about a cherished sibling dur- ing an interaction with a coworker, this individual will construct and perhaps vocal- ize excuses and justifications that attempt to neutralize the impact these comments have on her sibling's face. In short, the cognitive dynamics at play in regard to imaginary face-work may also apply to protective face-work on behalf of nonpres- ent concrete significant others.</page><page sequence="16">888 Sharp Recent work in the sociology of religion has called for scholars of religion to investigate religious beliefs and practices of everyday believers outside the confines of religious institutions (e.g., Ammerman 2007; Bender et al. 2012; McGuire 2008). This article heeds this call by explicating how believers accomplish theodicy in everyday life. Theodicy, to paraphrase Froese and Bader (2007), is not simply the concern of intellectual elites; rather, as my analysis demonstrates, it is also the con- cern of everyday believers. Due to the ubiquity of suffering, most ordinary believers will have to reconcile their belief in an omnipotent and morally perfect God with their personal experiences of suffering at some point in their lives. Thus, under- standing how everyday believers accomplish theodicy reveals an important aspect of the religious lives of these individuals. Several important characteristics of how believers accomplish theodicy in everyday life bear discussion. The first characteristic is how the accounts all focused on saving God's face as a morally perfect being. This reflects everyday believers' taken-for-granted assumption of the omnipotence of God, since it is not God's lack of power that they feel the need to account for but rather His moral standing. How- ever, the accounts that save God's face as a morally perfect actor seemingly chal- lenge God's omnipotence. For instance, a highly trained philosopher might point out that the account that God allows suffering because of His commitment to respect free will logically contradicts God's omnipotence because it limits the actions that He can accomplish. Also, an academic theologian might point out that blaming Satan for suffering logically begs the question of why God could not or would not stop Satan from causing this suffering. The formal rationality and logic of the accounts believers use to save God's face, however, is of little importance to believers; rather, what is important is that these accounts provide cognitively satis- fying explanations for their suffering that allow them to save God's face as a mor- ally perfect actor and thus maintain their belief in God. As Swidler (2001) argues, whether the accounts actors use to achieve a goal are formally illogical matters little to individuals; rather, what is important is that accounts help individuals achieve their particular goals. The second characteristic of how believers accomplish theodicy in everyday life is the heterogeneity of the accounts used to save God's face. Rather than construct- ing and using the same account, the participants of this study constructed and used several different types of accounts to save God's face as a morally perfect actor. This heterogeneity is due to the "ragbag" (Wuthnow 1996) character of American religious culture. Rather than being a whole cloth of unified beliefs, American reli- gious culture is a "ragbag" of discrete and diverse beliefs. Individuals often stitch together these rags in creative ways to make their own patchwork quilts of religious beliefs (cf. Roof 1999; Wuthnow 1998, 2010), but experiences of suffering often cause tears in these quilts. Due to the ragbag nature of American religious culture, however, believers can strategically and selectively use other rags that make up this culture - such as the ideas of God-granted free will and Satan - to repair these tears by constructing accounts that save God's face as a morally perfect actor. Thus, rather than making continued belief in American religious culture difficult, the dis- unified and ragbag nature of this culture actually facilitates the continued belief in this culture.</page><page sequence="17">Monotheistic Theodicy 889 A third characteristic of how believers accomplish theodicy in everyday life is the personalized nature of the accounts believers use to save God's face as a morally perfect being. That is, rather than trying to save God's face by account- ing for the existence of suffering in general, believers saved God's face by accounting for their own personal experiences of suffering. That believers tailored face-saving accounts to their own specific situations, personalities, and biogra- phies evidences this personalized focus. For instance, the participants who now had careers helping intimate partner violence victims accounted for their experi- ences of abuse by arguing that God allowed these experiences so that they could help others in the future. Also, several participants who had taken previous courses of action that they now regretted (e.g., getting an abortion) used this component of their biographies to shift blame away from God for their suffering by placing blame onto themselves. By incorporating their personal situations, personalities, and biographies into the excuses and justifications they use to save God's face, believers created accounts that are personally resonant and thus more cognitively satisfying than abstract theodicean explanations for the existence of suffering. Understanding how ordinary believers accomplish theodicy contributes to understanding why and how religious beliefs remain relatively stable over the life course (e.g., Bengtson, Putney, and Harris 2013; Dillon and Wink 2007; Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life 2008; Sherkat 1991,1998; Stark and Finke 2000). While several explanations have been given for this trend, scholars have generally neglected the crucial role that accomplishing theodicy plays in the maintenance of religious beliefs over the life course. Experiences of suffering challenge individuals' beliefs in the Judeo-Christian God. If they could not successfully accomplish theod- icy, believers very likely would resolve their cognitive dissonance by disavowing their belief in God, as well as other attendant religious beliefs and identities. That so many individuals maintain their belief in God despite the ubiquity of suffering indicates that many do successfully accomplish theodicy, and thus to understand theodicy is to understand an important cognitive mechanism that at least partly accounts for the general stability of religious beliefs. The analysis presented in this article is limited in four major respects. The big- gest limitation of the analysis is that I only offered a theory about how believers accomplish monotheistic theodicy. I hope that future scholars will investigate how individuals who belong to polytheistic or nontheistic religions accomplish theodicy, as well as members of other faiths who also believe in a single omnipotent and mor- ally perfect God (e.g., Muslims). Second, I based my analysis on data from individ- uals whose suffering came as the result of others' actions. Further research should investigate the processes of theodicy elicited by experiences of natural disasters, ill health, or other natural phenomena. Third, because of the qualitative nature of my sample I could not and did not make any claims regarding associations between religious, sociodemographic, psychological, and biographical characteristics and the tendency to use one type of account over another. Using quantitative survey data to explore these associations is a project that I hope researchers will carry out in the future. Finally, my data do not allow me to investigate why some individuals maintain their belief in an omnipotent and morally perfect God after they</page><page sequence="18">890 Sharp experience suffering and why others disavow this belief. If my analysis of how individuals accomplish theodicy is correct, then it would seem that individuals who ultimately reject the existence of God after experiencing suffering do so because they are unable to develop cognitively satisfying accounts that allow them to save God's face as a morally perfect actor. It is my hope that this article stimulates research on why some believers maintain and others reject the notion of an omnipotent and morally perfect God after experiencing suffering. CONCLUSION For centuries, the scholarly study of theodicy has largely been the province of philosophers and theologians. For the most part, these thinkers have focused on evaluating, refining, and creating various theodicean ideas that reconcile particular religious beliefs (in particular, the supposed existence of an omnipotent and morally perfect deity) with the existence of suffering. However, this article and the work of others (e.g., Berger 1967; Hunter 1982; Moschella et al. 1997; Musick 2000; Simko 2012; Weber 1978) demonstrate that theodicy is not only a concern of academic philosophers and theologians, but a concern of social scientists as well. Social science has contributed substantively to the academic study of theodicy and theodicean thought by outlining the cognitive processes involved in accomplishing theodicy, as I have done here, demonstrating the social and individual consequences of ascribing to particular theodicean thought (e.g., Berger 1967; Moschella et al. 1997; Musick 2000; Simko 2012), and showing how social forces influence the adoption and dissemination of particular strands of theodicean thought (e.g., Hunter 1982; Simko 2012; Weber 1978). Social scientists should continue to investigate theodicy and theodicean thought, since social science has analytical concepts and methodological tools well suited for understanding how theodicy and theodicean thought influence and are influenced by individuals' social experiences and large-scale social forces.
