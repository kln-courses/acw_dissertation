<plain_text><page sequence="1">GEORGE STEINER'S RELIGION OF ABSTRACTION Christopher J. Knight If Steiner's religious thinking were to be reduced to a sentence, it might well be Jesus' command, "Be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect" (Matt. 5.48). This commandment is, as Geza Vermes argues, solidly based in "Jewish teaching on the instability of God's loving-kindness and the duty to follow him" (204), and, as such, is one more testimony to the merit of seeing Jesus as part of the Jewish tradition. In 1935, Thomas Walter Manson wrote, "We are so accustomed... to make Jesus the object of religion that we become apt to forget that in our earliest records he is portrayed not as the object of religion, but as a religious man" (Vermes 184). Steiner himself sees Jesus this way, as a religious man, specifically a Jew, compelled by an extraordinary idealism that should be intolerable to most. In his novel The Portage to San Cristobal of A. //., Steiner has Hitler say of Jesus, Demand of human beings more than they can give, demand that they give up their stained, selfish humanity in the name of a higher ideal, and you will make of them cripples, hypocrites, mendicants for salvation. The Nazarene said that his king- dom, his purities were not of this world. . . . Ask of man more than he is, hold before his tired eyes an image of altruism, of compassion, of self-denial which only the saint or the madman can touch, and you stretch him on the rack. Till his soul bursts. What can be cruder than the Jew's addiction to the ideal? (165-66) Here, Hitler says nothing that Steiner himself has not said elsewhere, albeit in a more modulated tone. Steiner identifies Jesus with the summons to perfection, a way of life that sets itself in aggressive contradistinction to the lives of ordinary men and women. The desire is to escape reality's dross and to move toward the Ideal. In Bluebeard's Castle, Steiner writes: R&amp;L28A (Spring 1996) 49</page><page sequence="2">50 Religion &amp; Literature The Books of the Prophets and the Sermon on the Mount and parables of Jesus which are so closely related to the prophetic idiom, constitute an unequaled act of moral demand. Because the words are so familiar, yet too great for ready use, we tend to forget or merely conventionalize the extremity of their call. Only he who loses his life, in the fullest sense of sacrificial self-denial, shall find life. The kingdom is for the naked, for those who have willingly stripped themselves of every belonging, of every sheltering egoism. There is no salvation in the middle places. For the true disciple of the prophets and of Jesus, the utmost ethical commitment is like common breath. To become a man, man must make himself new, and in so doing stifle the elemental desires, weaknesses, and claims of the ego. Only he who can say with Pascal, "le mm est haissable" has ever begun to obey the Gospels1 altruistic imperative. (42) Steiner views the summons to perfection not only as articulative of "the religious element" in its essence (TD 329), but also as particularly identifi- able with Judaism. In the first instance, it might be noted that as a non- practicing Jew, Steiner's references to religion have generally been non- parochial. In his first book, Tolstoy or Dostoevski, he urges his reader to understand his references to religion "in its most spacious connotations" (329). This conception of religion as an expression of larger, abstract purposes has held good throughout his career. Still, as his work has increasingly discussed the Shoah, it has also increasingly made reference to his own Jewishness. This has not really altered his sense of the religious impulse as broad-based, though it has resulted in an increasing identifica- tion of Judaism not only with the murdered victims of German hatred and the world's indifference but also with the challenge of Abstraction. Moses was the first, Jesus was the second and Marx was the third of three Jews, each of whom demanded that the world reform itself, that it put aside its suspect practices and gods and attend to the call of the Ideal: "Three times, Judaism has confronted Western man with the merciless claims and exactions of the ideal. Three times - in its invention of monotheism, in the message of the radical Jesus, in Marxism and messianic-socialism - Israel has asked of ordinary men and women more than human nature wishes to give; more, it may be, than it is organically and psychically able to give. Nothing is more cruel than the blackmail of perfection" (LLM 59). Steiner finds severed reasons for identifying Judaism with the realm of Abstraction. First, there is the reason of its God, this Presence who, after Mount Sinai, has been most notable for His Absence, an absence which has been the central fact of Judaic history, though perhaps never so noticed and painful as in the period of the Shoah. "In post-Shoah Judaism," Steiner states, "the question of the language of prayer - how can it be anything but cynical, accusatory or despairing? - is radically posed" (LLM 143). How can one pray to a God who has abandoned one? This is</page><page sequence="3">CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT 5 1 the question that every post-Shoah Jew must struggle with, though the question is not, in Jewish history, without antecedent, for it was heard earlier on Golgotha: "Eli, Wma sabach-tha'niT (Matt. 27.46). Belief here makes extraordinary demands, as it always has, for how does one orient one's life toward that which appears seldom more palpable than the most ancient testimony and the most suspect intuition? "The demands made of the mind are, like God's name, unspeakable. Brain and conscience are commanded to vest belief, obedience, love in an abstraction purer, more inaccessible to ordinary sense than is the highest of mathematics" (BC 37). By contrast, the Christian's core of beliefs seems absolutely physical. Steiner remarks on this, noting how difficult it must have been for the ancient Israelites to hold to what, at the time, would have seemed a fantastic notion (i.e., one God). He says that Christianity, in effect, found a way to make the demands on the imagination less arduous by offering a blend of monotheism and polytheism, a blend of abstraction and house- hold saints: "it allowed scope for the pluralistic, pictorial needs of the psyche. Be it in their Trinitarian aspects, in their proliferation of saintly and angelic persons, or in their vividly material realization of God the Father, of Christ, of Mary, the Christian churches have, with very rare exception, been a hybrid of monotheistic ideals and polytheistic practices" (BC 39). The more stringent monotheistic ideal predates Christianity, and it still seems unmindful of human needs, originating as it does from this "jealous God," who visits "the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation" (Exodus 20.5). This may be one more reason why the God of Moses must have received from the early Israelites only a lukewarm welcome. Or as Steiner writes: "What we must recapture to mind, as nakedly as we can, is the singularity, the brainhammering strangeness, of the monotheistic idea. Historians of religion tell us that the emergence of the concept of the Mosaic God is a unique fact in human experience, that a genuinely comparable notion sprang up at no other place. The abruptness of the Mosaic revelation, the finality of the creed at Sinai, tore up the human psyche by its most ancient roots. The break has never really knit" (BC 37). Another reason for identifying Judaism with the realm of Abstraction connects with the Mosaic God's commandment against "graven image [s]." In The Critique of Judgement, Kant wrote that there was perhaps "no more sublime passage in the Jewish Law" than this (I 127), his reason being that it forced the Jewish people away from the commonplace idols of more primitive communities, and instead forced them to stretch their imagina- tions and to reach out to the realm of the sublime:</page><page sequence="4">52 Religum &amp; Literature The fear that, if we divest this representation of everything that can commend it to the senses, it will thereupon be attended only with a cold and lifeless approbation and not with any moving force or emotion, is wholly unwarranted. The very reverse is the truth. For when nothing any longer meets the eye of sense, and the unmistakable and ineffaceable idea of morality is left in possession of the field, there would be need rather of tempering the ardour of an unbounded imagination to prevent it rising to enthusiasm, than of seeking to lend these ideas the aid of images and childish devices for fear of their being wanting in potency. (I 1 27-28) Steiner agrees. "To all but a very few," he writes, "the Mosaic God has been from the outset, even when passionately invoked, an immeasurable Absence, or a metaphor modulating downward to the natural sphere of poetic, imagistic approximation. But the exaction stays in force - im- mense, relentless. It hammers at human consciousness, demanding that it transcend itself, that it reach out into a light of understanding so pure that it is itself blinding" (BC 38). Images may be inescapable, but we can resist, thinks Steiner, the temptation to caress and worship them, and to think that they are all there is and that there is no copula between the realm of images and the meanings of meaning. It is why he is so hostile to poststructuralism and its celebration of a linguistic indeterminacy, for he fears that it leaves us mired in the detritus of language, with our backs turned away from the source of our being. In a discussion comparing Derrida and Levinas, Steiner writes: "When Derrida postulates that se- mantic markers can be ascribed decidable and eventually stabilized sense only if 'the sign is taken to look to God,' he is in total accord with Levinas. But for deconstruction, of course, such an assumption is an absurd atavism and a ludicrous quest for beginnings, for an auctoritas that never was. For Levinas, no less self-evidently, a theory and practice of sense is underwrit- ten by that very turn towards the 'face of God"' ("Levinas" 244-45). For Steiner, theology entails a grammar, a closed system: "Grammatical postulates and demonstrations of God's existence. . . can have validity only inside closed speech systems" (RP 57). The system either finds its valida- tion in the Deity, or it does not find it at all. But the sense is that all things, when understood in the light, or invisible center, which is God, acquire meaning, a meaning more measurable than that locatable in an indetermi- nate system driven by forces that are as rapacious as they are blind. And this, says Steiner, helps to explain the necessity of taboos, not only the Judaic taboo against graven images but also more general religious restric- tions against blasphemy, or any other action which would invert the hierarchy of the divine and the mundane through making God's name one name among others. The "depth of the Judaic prohibition on the enuncia- tion of the name or, more strictly speaking, of the Name of the Name, of</page><page sequence="5">CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT 53 God," says Steiner, relates to the fact that once this name is spoken, it "passes into the contingent limitlessness of linguistic play, be it rhetorical, metaphoric or deconstructive," where it finds "no demonstrable lodging" (RP 57). But this restriction exacts a price, for it makes the Jewish God appear all that much more abstract and inaccessible, a God almost more wisely addressed, or acknowledged, through silence. Certainly, Steiner encourages the view that silence is the most fitting response to Divinity. He even imagines prayer as passing through into silence, as the supplicant is forced to adopt the language of his Interlocutor, "the silence of live meaning" (BC 106). Language, thinks Steiner, severs us "from the silences that inhabit the greater part of being" (LS x). Silence, on the other hand, gives us "access" to "the categories of felt being" (RP 103). It need not be a dead-end, and may be an avenue toward the Light (LS 21); and for those who are most attentive to the world's unspoken articulacies, silence can be a form of active answering (PR 7). Still, to make silence the primary avenue by which God may be known furthers, again, the sense of His abstractness. Nor does it escape the charge of being rhetorical, for a polemics on behalf of silence remains a gesture lodged in language. Even when silence's gestures appear most pure, they still constitute a kind of language. This does not mean that we cannot imagine a realm outside the bounds of human linguistics. We can, and we do well to if we wish to avoid a spiritual impoverishment. For Steiner, the prohibition against graven images was a reminder of the need to seek out meaning even in the midst of a sea of images. In his essay "Graven Images," he celebrates a host of Jewish art historians - Adolph Goldschmidt, Fritz Saxl, Erwin Panofsky, Meyer Schapiro, Max Friedlander, E. H. Gombrich, and Aby Warburg - precisely for their ability to search out the meanings of meaning, which even if it did not offer itself plainly, did evidence itself in shadow, in the symbolic iconography of a Flemish canvas that if one, such as a Panofsky, knew how to read it, could make the world seem luminescent with mean- ing. That these men were able to read as well as they did Steiner partly attributes to the Hebraic prohibition against graven images, a prohibition which helped teach them, as Kant would have it, the power of the imagination: The question leaps to mind: Why this dominance of a veritable galaxy of Jewish talent in art history and art interpretation? A possible answer... lies to hand. Prohibited throughout its earlier religious and ritual history from the making and contemplation of graven images, emancipated Judaism turned to the study of Western art with a peculiar thirst but also with a vehement, if perhaps subcon- scious, bias. The art to which it turned had to be "meaningful" - it had to be subject to intelligible readings and, ultimately, to rational analysis, as were the</page><page sequence="6">54 Religion &amp; Literature canonic texts in the Judaic tradition. There was in Warburg's obsession and in the great library that he gathered and handed on more than a touch of the Talmudic. But so there is, he would point out, in the assemblage of occult symbols, in the unwavering posture of intellectual and moral inquiry that Dttrer delineated in his representation of human sorrow. (98) Steiner's allusion to the Talmud also calls forth another reason for identifying Judaism with Abstraction, and this has to do with its being such a remarkably text-based religion. Of course, the Talmud calls up an image of a text that has taken on a life of its own, and Steiner admits the fact: "Dialogue with the ultimately, but only ultimately, unfathomable text is the breath of Jewish history and being. It has proved to be the instrument of improbable survival. At the same time, the Talmudic genius and method have, very possibly, generated within Judaic sensibility certain philological- legalistic sterilities and circularities. The dance turns never-endingly on itself" (RP 41). This image of the Talmud as emblematically textual has not gone unnoticed by commentators sympathetic to the poststructuralist point of view. Susan Handelman, in The Slayers of Moses: The Emergence of Rabbinic Interpretation in Modern Literary Theory (1982), is most identified with the theory that finds a strong rabbinical element in poststructuralism's celebration of textuality, for her thinking here is both the most developed and presumptive. But other critics, including Frank Kermode and Hartman, have also promoted the thesis that Talmudic commentary's strength lies in its offering a way of reading that accents "revision, rather than more violent ways of denial, or trying to start de novo" (Hartman in Salusinszky 87). Steiner would not dispute the point, but at the same time, it has been his contention that this method is different from deconstructive readings in that it assumes a theological order. In "The CriticV'Reader,'" he writes: "the rabbinical exegete or Calvin on the Gospels can proceed without apology or rationalizing metaphor, 'as if the real presence were unam- biguously operative in his text. He can, in short, make explicit the assump- tion, implicit in all true reading, that the warranty of meaning, that which finally underwrites the capacity of language to have sense and force beyond sense, is of a theological order" (GSR 90). Here, Steiner does not distinguish between Jewish and Christian commentary, conceiving more similarity than difference in the methodologies. Ten years later, in Real Presences (1989), however, his shading acquires a different hue. In Real Presences and other recent work, Steiner demonstrates greater readiness to make strong distinctions between Jewish and Christian prac- tices, including the difference in commentary styles. He still views Talmu- dic practice as predicating a theological order, but he also seems to be borrowing something from poststructuralism in general and Handelman</page><page sequence="7">CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT 55 in particular, most notably the latter's view that "Paul and the Church Fathers after him replaced the prolonged Rabbinic meditation on and meditation of the Text with the pure unmediated presence of Jesus, who resolves all oppositions, stabilizes meaning, provides ultimate identity, and collapses differentiation" (Cunningham 399). For instance, compare this statement to the following in Real Presences: Note the radical difference between Catholic and Judaic textuality. There is no temporal singularity, no enigma of historicity ("why in this one place, why at that one time?") in the Judaic sense of the Creation and of the Mosaic reception and transmission of the Law. There is a strict, utterly mysterious temporality in the coming and ministry of Christ. Being so naturally, if inexplicably, immersed in actual time, the meanings of that coming, the normative consequences of the sayings of Christ and of the writings of the Apostles, must, as it were, be stabilized in eternity. The Torah is indeterminately synchronic with all individual and communal life. The Gospels, Epistles and Acts are not. (44) The antithesis, while not unhelpful, seems a little too pat. We know of Christ, like we know of Moses, through narratives handed down, some- times lost and then later found, redacted, translated, and filtered through commentary, conflict and ritual. We make a mistake if we think that all the Christian needs to do is go back to the source, the Gospel narratives, themselves a form of commentary, or textuality, written decades after Jesus' death and often at odds with one another as to even the basic facts. As Valentine Cunningham says in response to Handelman, "What, I wonder, would Lancelot Andrewes have made of being dismissed as one not meditating on the text in prolonged ways or of accepting the a- textually 'unmediated presence of Jesus'!" (399). Textuality is textuality, whether it be Jewish or Christian, though we perhaps force the matter when we compare Jewish texts of law to Christian texts of revelation. As Vermes writes: "If Judaism is described exclusively on the basis of such legal or near-legal documents as the Mishnah, the Talmud or the Shulhan Arukh, it will appear more legalistic and casuistic than spiritual; but so would Christianity if seen one-sidedly mirrored in the codes of canon law, penitential books or manuals of moral theology of the various churches" (195). These texts announce their secondarincss, their textuality, in a way, for instance, that neither Genesis nor Mark does. And yet we would be naive to think the latter narratives transparencies. They are not. Steiner knows this, of course; but it does not stop him from wishing to make a distinction that places Christianity on the side of time-stopping revelation and Judaism on the side of textuality (and, by extension, on the side of Abstraction). As he writes in "Our Homeland, the Text," "whether they are seen as positive or negative, the 'textual' fabric, the interpretative</page><page sequence="8">56 Religion &amp; Literature practices in Judaism are ontologically and historically at the heart of Jewish identity" (7), of an identity that "scorn [s] the natural sphere" in favor of "its extreme commitment to abstraction, to word and text" (6). Crucial to Steiner's identification of Judaism with textuality is the downplaying, even rejection, of a Messiah. That is, while Steiner is keenly aware of the messianic elements in such historical movements as Chris- tianity, Marxism, Zionism and even Judaism proper, he thinks the concept of a Messiah a bogus one, whether understood in the frame of Jewish longing or Christian remembrance and promise. In the instance of Juda- ism, he believes that its messianic tenets have always been ambivalent, and that, in the period of the post-Shoah, they must be simply set aside, as something now widely recognized as unrealizable: "The Old Testament and the Talmud, rabbinic teachings and Jewish historicism are unques- tionably brimful of the messianic promise and of the awaiting of the Messiah in moods both anguished and exultant. But does the Jew, in psychological and historical fact truly believe in the coming? More search- ingly: does he truly thirst for it? Or is it, was it perhaps from the very first, what logicians or grammatologists might designate as a 'counter-factual optative,' a category of meaning never to be realized?" (TGD 37). It is not that radical an opinion, actually, even among more committed Jewish thinkers. Gershom Scholem, for instance, thinks that while the personal Messiah "is undoubtedly connected with the historical origins of the messianic hope," "[i]t has become immaterial for wide circles of Jews, even for some who harbor strong religious feelings" {On Jews and Judaism 287- 88). Here, even as Scholem thinks of himself as a messianist, he sees the Messiah surviving mainly as a symbol, "as a summation of everything implied by the messianic ideal" (288). This is the way things should be thinks Steiner, believing the ideal too anti-historical, too much a threat to the delivery of tomorrow's "morning paper": Given the choice, the Jew prefers tomorrow's news, however grim, to the arrival of the Messiah. We are a people unquenchably avid of history, of knowledge in motion. We are the children of Eve whose primal curiosity has modulated into that of the philosophic and natural sciences. In denying the messianic status of Jesus, in subverting early Christian beliefs in the proximity of the eschatological, the Jew gave expression to the genius of restlessness central to his psyche. We were, we remain nomads across time; (TGD 37-38) Scholem once wrote that "[a]ny discussion of the problems relating to Messianism is a delicate matter, for it is here that the essential conflict between Judaism and Christianity has developed and continues to exist" {The Messianic Idea 1). The statement reflects both his temperance and</page><page sequence="9">CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT 57 wisdom. On the matter of messianism, however, Steiner steers a different course. In "Through That Glass Darkly," the oppositions he celebrates mostly entail a far from delicate dismissal of Christian messianism. Again, his point is that Christianity would have stopped time - though it is not clear how - had it not been for the refusal of the Jews to recognize Jesus as the Messiah: "The Jewish rebuke to Christ prevents the coming of the messianic realm. It pries and forces open the ravenous jaws of history" (41). This forgets that Christians imagine their existences as situated between a First and Second Coming (or Parousia), and thereby see them- selves historically. History and Logos co-exist, even as the former is imag- ined as living in and moving toward the latter. It is true, as Scholem writes, that what for Judaism "stood unconditionally at the end of history as its most distant aim was for" Christianity "the true center of the historical process" (The Messianic Idea 1); and that this has had consequences in the way the two theologies conceive this Ideal. Notably, says Scholem, Jews have long "maintained a concept of redemption as an event that takes place publicly, on the stage of history and within the community," whereas Christians have tended to imagine "redemption as an event in the spiritual and unseen realm, an event which is reflected in the soul, in the private world of each individual, and which effects an inner transformation which need not correspond to anything outside" (The Messianic Idea 1). Also, says Scholem, the experience of the messianic has, for Jews, long been associ- ated with the state of exile; and that whereas Christians know Christ as a historical person, the Jewish image of the Messiah is necessarily abstract and entails no longing backward but only a looking forward: "Thus in Judaism the Messianic idea has compelled a life lived in deferment, in which nothing can be done definitively, nothing can be irrevocably accom- plished. One may say, perhaps, the Messianic idea is the real anti-existen- tialist idea" (The Messianic Idea 35). Clearly, then, there are differences, but to push these differences, as Steiner does, to the point where Christianity's embrace of Logos is seen as all-in-all, and Judaism's embrace of History is also seen as all-in-all, is to distort matters too much. Here, Judaism seems less anti-existential than quintessentially existential. "In what measure, at what level of consciousness," Steiner asks, "was the Jewish refusal of Jesus, at the time and thereafter, a symptom of radical psychic commitment to historical freedom, to the creative daimon of existential destiny on a chang- ing earth?" (TGD 38). We are expected to answer that the refusal of Jesus' messianic claim was a conscious, profound and sound affirmation of history over telos, even over Judaism's own form of messianism. Or as Steiner himself says: "We Jews have said 'No' to the claims made for and, in certain opaque moments by, the man Jesus. He remains for us a spurious</page><page sequence="10">58 Religion &amp; Literature messiah. The true one has not come in his stead. Today, who but a fundamentalist handful awaits his coming in any but a formulaic, allegoric sense, a sense bitterly irrelevant to the continuing desolation of the human situation?" (TGD 49). For Steiner, this rejection of Jesus the Messiah is not a rejection of Jesus the man, or his teachings. About the latter, Steiner's views parallel Vermes's, that the Sermon on the Mount and other such teachings are continuous with Judaic practices of the time, particularly "the charismatic Judaism of wonder-working holy men such as the first-century BC Honi and Jesus' younger contemporary, Hanina ben Dosa, modelled on the biblical proph- ets such as Elijah and Elisha" (Vermes 4). These teachings can, says Steiner, be found to "correspond very nearly point for point with cardinal tenets of the Torah and with the ethics, unsurpassed, of the Prophets, most especially Isaiah. Where there are departures from the canonic norm, in respect, for example, of the need to keep company with the publicans and the sinful, or in regard to the primacy of healing and salvational acts over the sanctity of the Sabbath, such dissents do not go signally beyond queries and challenges to Pharisiac observance as we find them among other Jewish 'liberals' or apocalyptics at the time" (TGD 34). Steiner views Jesus as a paragon of virtue, the mouthpiece of "a purified, humanly resourceful and compassionate Judaism" (TGD 34), who summoned men and women to live not by their appetites but by an ideal of self-sacrifice and love for one another. That the message got distorted, suggests Steiner, is less the fault of Jesus than of Paul, John and those who came after. He should probably agree with Vermes, when the latter writes: "Today as in past centuries, the believing Christian's main New Testament source of faith lies, not so much in Mark, Matthew and Luke and their still sufficiently earthly Jesus, as in the centuries of speculation by the church on the theological Gospel of John with its eternal Word become flesh, and perhaps, even more on the letters of Paul with their drama of death, atonement, and resurrection. The Christ of Paul and John, on the way toward deification, overshadows and obscures the man of Galilee" (2 1 0). Certainly, Paul comes across as the villain in Steiner's accounts, the one most responsible for the early Chris- tian sect's separation from the larger Jewish community. In Paul, Steiner detects element of Jewish self-hatred, a flaw that found its tragic denoue- ment in the Shoah, as hatred originally directed inward found itself, after the divorce of communities, directed outward: "The beginning of the macabre history of Jewish self-hatred is inextricably inwoven with those of Christianity. ... [T] he thought presses on one that Christianity is at funda- mental points a product and externalization of just this Jewish self-hatred" (TGD 40). Whether this be true or not, Steiner believes the Shoah has its</page><page sequence="11">CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT 59 roots in those passages (he names Romans 9-11, Ephesians 2, and 1 Thessalonians) wherein Paul appears to blame the Jews for Christ's cruci- fixion. In "Through That Glass Darkly," he writes: "1 Thessalonians, 2, 15, proclaims the Jew to be a deicide, a slayer of his own Prophets and, therefore, one 'contrary' or 'enemy to all men.' Vatican II sought to attenuate or even cancel this sentence of death in the troubled light of modern squeamishness and the Holocaust. In view of the 'final solution' which this Pauline verdict determines. But the text is not accident: it lay, it continues to lie, at the historical and symbolic roots of Christendom" (49- 50). Here, Steiner's vehement rejection of Paul contrasts with Vermes's more equitably managed view: To be fair, it has to be said that Paul, despite the many harsh polemical comments against Judaism, shies off in the end from damning his people for ever. His inventive poetic mind imagines that the rejection of Christ is a dreadful but only temporary lapse. The apostle of the Gentiles by attempting to graft the whole converted non-Jewish world on to the Jewish stock, thus making them the heirs of all the divine promises granted to Abraham and his posterity, secretly hoped that the elevation of the Gentiles would excite the jealousy of the Jews, and bring them to teshuvah and submission to Christ so that "all Israel" might be saved. (212-1 3) In short, Steiner blames the split between the Christian and Jewish communities on 1) self-hatred among the early Christians for their own antecedents; 2) Paul's placement of blame upon the Jews for Jesus' crucifix- ion; 3) the Jews' refusal to acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah; and 4) Christianity's later inclination toward political power. About this last point, I have as yet said nothing. But it is an important point for Steiner, and explains not only his dislike for the Church, but also his discomfort with the state of Israel, particularly as it presents itself as both a religious and political entity. In the first instance, Steiner says that "[i]t is altogether possible that Judaism would have lost its identity, would have diffused itself in Christianity, if the latter had been true to its Judaic catholicity. Instead, Christendom became, itself, a political-territorial structure, prepared, on all practical counts, to serve, to hallow, the genesis and militancy of secular states" (OHT 21). The suggestion that Judaism would have been absorbed into Christianity had the latter remained outside the political matrix is plausible, I suspect, given the interrelation between Christianity's under- standing of Jesus' messianic dimension and the coercive force of the First Council of Nicaea and the First Council of Constantinople, respectively convened by the emperors Constantine I and Theodosius I. But whether or not this might have happened, Steiner's main point is that no corporate entity like a Church can do justice to the anarchic energy of a Jesus, to the intolerable demands that his teachings make upon us. "Can," he quotes</page><page sequence="12">60 Religion &amp; Literature Dostoevsky, "any established church house the Galilean trouble-maker?" (SR 59). He thinks not, not this prophet who, in the spirit of Amos (7. 14), demanded of his disciples that they go out into the world taking "nothing for their journey except a staff; no bread, no bag, no money in their belts; but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics" (Mark 6. 8-9). To seek the homeland which is God requires that we not put down roots, that we remain restless searchers. To do otherwise is to convert the unearthly imperative into something much more tame - forms and rituals, empty of meaning and force: For the majority of "practicing" Christians - and what does "practicing" entail in this concept? - the Crucifixion remains an unexamined inheritance, a symbolic marker of familiar but vestigial recognitions. This marker is reversed and invoked in conventional idiom and gestures. Its concrete status, the enormity of suffering and injustice it incarnates, would appear to have faded from felt immediacy. How many educated men or women now hear Pascal's cry that humanity must not sleep because Christ hangs on his Cross till the end of the world? A "rationalized" Christianity hovers between an untenable literalism and symbolic insubstantiality, in the indistinct spaces of fitful imagining which we call myth. (SR 62-63) There is, then, something implacable about Steiner's project, for which he makes no apologies. Instead, when pressed to adopt a more liberal posture, he becomes more goading, telling us, for instance, that "[t]he death of Socrates outweighs the survival of Athens" (GSR 196). Or that the nation of Israel has become "a death trap": "The messianic vision was, precisely, that which strove to overcome the homicidal tribalism that inhabits man. Having to be peregrine on this earth, the Jew developed that inward restlessness, those antennae for danger to which he owes his survival. For the Jew, the nation-state is not a fulfillment but a death trap" ("A Jew's Grief," 20). This last analysis has not won Steiner very many friends, certainly not among Jewish intellectuals. Morris Dickstein speaks of The Portage to San Cristobal of A. H.9 and its theories about Israel in its relation to nationalism and the Shoah, "as a sideshow distraction from the serious business of thinking through the unspeakable horrors of the Nazi era" ("Alive and 90," 21); and Lionel Abel writes that "no Jew, religious or secular, can follow George Steiner, nor can Steiner follow himself. He still has to decide how it is possible to secularize the Torah and yet regard it as true, or how to make sacred the untrue text. Without bringing off one or the other of these impossible feats, there cannot be Homeland for him" (371). Steiner is, of course, obsessed with the question of homeland, but he thinks, unlike Abel and even unlike Scholem and Levinas, whose thinking he clearly respects, that the Jew's true homeland is not to be found in a</page><page sequence="13">CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT 6 1 piece of property alongside the Mediterranean, no matter how imbued with Jewish history, but rather in the text: "In post-exilic Judaism, but perhaps earlier, active reading, answerability to the text on both the meditative-interpretative and the behavioural levels, is the central motion of personal and national homecoming. The Torah is met at the place of summons and in the time of calling (which is night and day). The dwelling assigned, ascribed to Israel is the House of the Book. Heine's phrase is exactly right: das aufgeschriebene Vaterland. The 'land of the fathers,' the patrimonie, is the script" (OHT 5). Abel has reason to worry that Steiner's allegiance to the text extends beyond Jewish sacred texts, and that these latter texts do not receive an attention distinctive enough to make clear their specialness. Steiner has long postulated a connection between literary texts and the spiritual, and his interest has been more with secular than sacred texts. Still, in "Our Homeland, the Text," Steiner makes a concerted attempt to deal with the issues of text and textuality as they pertain to Jewish experience and longings - specifically the longing connected to the aliyah. He begins by drawing a connection between Judaism and the text as they both bespeak the condition of exile. It is easy, given the long history of the Diaspora, to understand the first connection; the second, however, needs spelling out. Steiner starts off by proposing the possibility that the Torah itself "is a place of privileged banishment from the tautological immediacy of Adamic speech, of God's direct, unwritten address to man" (OHT 5). Here, the condition of something being written already confers on it the status of exile, of that which has traveled a distance from its first home. God's Word has an immediacy or originality about it which escapes transcription and confers a secondariness even upon sacred writings. Among the Hebrews, no less than the Greeks, says Steiner, there is "a distrust of the written word, a critical regret at the passing of orality" (OHT 8). For them, "the written is always a shadow after the fact, a post-script" (OHT 8). Nor does Steiner stop at writing. He also attributes a quality of belatedness and exile to reading, particularly in relation to praxis: "Reading, textual exegesis, are an exile from action, from the existential innocence of praxis, even when the text is aiming at practical and political consequence. The reader is one who (day and night) is absent from action" (OHT 5). Writing and reading, then, are noticeably textual, locatable in their own diaspora. This diaspora, argues Steiner, is not so unlike the Jewish people's own Diaspora, for their situation has historically also been one of textuality. Or as Steiner writes: "The 'textuality' of the Jewish condition, from the destruction of the Temple to the foundation of the modern state of Israel, can be seen, has</page><page sequence="14">62 Religion &amp; Literature been seen by Zionism, as one of tragic impotence. The text was the instrument of exilic survival; that survival came within a breath of annihi- lation. To endure at all, the 'people of the Book' had, once again, to be a nation" (OHT 5). Steiner, however, rejects the Zionist conclusion. He acknowledges that Jews are divided by their "unhoused at-homeness in the text" (specifically the Hebraic text) and "the territorial mystery of the native ground" (OHT 5), but he sees no reason for thinking that Israel as homeland is preferable to the Book. This conviction has only been strengthened by the events of the previous decades, events which, thinks Steiner, have demonstrated that an Israel conceived along the lines of nineteenth-century nationalism will invariably fall into all the traps - the inequities, the militarism, the bureaucratic subterfuge and liming of brutalities - included in the terri- tory. Looking back to Theodor HerzePs Judenstaat, a founding document in the Zionist movement, Steiner is struck by how much "the language and the vision are proudly mimetic of Bismarckian nationalism" (OHT 22), and what an ominous foreshadowing this was of present-day Israel: Israel is a nation-state to the utmost degree. It lives armed to the teeth. It has been compelled to make other men homeless, servile, disinherited, in order to survive from day to day (it was, during the millennia, the dignity of the Jew that he was too weak to make any other human being unhoused, as wretched as himself). The virtues of Israel are those of beleaguered Sparta. Its propaganda, its rhetoric of self-deception, are as desperate as any contrived in the history of nationalism. Under external and internal stress, loyalty has been atrophied to patriotism, and patriotism made chauvinism. (OHT 22) The homecoming has been a disappointment, at least to the extent that Zionism provoked a messianic promise which it has, so far, failed to keep. The future may change this, and it may be perverse to suggest that Israelites, any more than other people, should prefer the abandon of the nomadic life to the comforts and pleasures of material at-homeness. Steiner does, in fact, think Jews remarkably different from other people, even to the point of promoting a racialism that, among late twentieth-century intellectuals, is almost unheard of: "if one is a Jew, one has quite extraordi- nary experience, perhaps illusory, perhaps not, of going down a street in a distant land, even where one does not know the language, and the other Jew in the street is one one recognizes by the way he walks. I know this to be true of my own experience" (IT 393). Still, whether or not this is the case, Steiner thinks that the Jew's religion and proud heritage must make him or her a partisan of transcendence, in a way foreign to the majority of</page><page sequence="15">CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT 63 non-Jews. He cites here Hegel's description of Abraham as seeking an "almost autistic intimacy with God," and as one "radically uninterested in or even hostile to other men, to those outside the covenant of his search" (OHT 6). The search is the most important thing, and others are not expected to take a like interest in it. From the Jew's perspective, thinks Steiner, they do not: "More than any other people, Jews claim, indeed they seem to achieve, nearness to the concept of God. They do so at the suicidal cost of mundane renunciation, of self-ostracism from the earth and its family of nations" (OHT 6). Steiner still seems to be speaking in the voice of Hegel here, though it is not clear. He does concur with Hegel's descrip- tion, but not his conclusion. The reason is that while Hegel found the Jews an exceptional people, he also thought them the victims of "an awesome pathology, a tragic, arrested stage in the advance of human consciousness towards a liberated homecoming" (OHT 7). Steiner thinks otherwise, believing this same movement away from the world and toward transcen- dence a sign "of the Jewish genius and of its survival" (OHT 7). He may be right, but the cost has been great. Still, there remains the question that if the Jew is not to think of Israel as his or her homeland because its model is conventional nationhood, why should this person think better of the text, which, as we have seen, is also equated with exile? Steiner has an answer, though it seems to entail an evasion. I say this because Steiner, as we have seen, has long railed against the essential parasitism of commentary, imagining such activity as occlud- ing that which should be held primary. And yet, when it comes to Jewish commentary upon the Torah, he takes a somewhat different stance, ap- proving what before he previously scorned (and sometimes still does). The point is, in "Our Homeland, the Text," he demonstrates a readiness, perhaps influenced by Handelman and other poststructuralists, to see commentary not as a killing of the thing one loves, but as a way to keep it alive in people's hearts. Or as he writes: "The text is home; each commen- tary a return. When he reads, when, by virtue of commentary, he makes of his reading a dialogue and life-giving echo, the Jew is, to purloin Heidegger's image, 'the shepherd of being.' The seeming nomad in truth carries the world within him, as does language itself" (OHT 7). Without commentary, texts - original and incarnated - would be forgotten and, in effect, die. The sacred would wither away into anthropology. Yet so long as the holy books "are read and surrounded by a constancy of secondary, satellite texts," their authority cannot be abrogated, and we can say of the second- ary texts that they "rescue the canon from the ebbing motion of the past</page><page sequence="16">64 Religion &amp; Literature tense, from that which would draw live meaning into inert and merely liturgical monumentality" (OHT 7). Everything that Steiner says in "Our Homeland, the Text" suggests a privileging of sacred writ over all else, though with Steiner one never quite knows whether it is he or the rhetoric that is speaking. This is not to accuse him of dishonesty. It is, rather, to acknowledge the brilliance of his writing and to wonder whether this brilliance does not, at times, reverse the order of horse and cart. Dickstein puts this matter more harshly than I would, but because I think he is on to something, I will quote him: "Mr. Steiner's writings often have this hollow feeling to them, as if his language were running away from him, and as though this gifted rhetorician were treat- ing the blood and bone of history as a literary text, a conceptual challenge, an occasion for ingenious exercises in interpretation" (13, 21). This comes from the review of Steiner's controversial novel, and the statement's harsh- ness is undoubtedly connected to that fact. But there is a strong element of truth in it, and in an essay like "Our Homeland, the Text," the rhetorical performance is of such an extraordinary caliber that even Steiner, near its conclusion, must pull back and confess that "this, of course, is only a part of the truth" (OHT 22), that while it makes wonderful poetic sense to identify Jews as the people of the Book, thirsting for transcendence, it must be acknowledged that "[t]he overwhelming majority of Jews... seek nei- ther to be prophets nor clerics deranged by some autistic, otherworldly addiction to speculative abstractions and the elixir of truth" (OHT 22-23). Then, in a statement that seemingly has forgotten from whence the matter originated, he writes: "What mandarin fantasy, what ivory-tower non- sense, is it to suppose that alone among men, and after the unspeakable horrors of destruction lavished among him, the Jew should not have a land of his own, a shelter in the night?" (OHT 23). This, of course, is to grant the opposing view its legitimacy, not to acquiesce to it. And in the remain- der of the essay, Steiner returns to his theme, albeit in a more modulated, even chastened - "Personally, I have no right to this answer" (OHT 23) - tone. I raise this matter of rhetoric now because, as suggested above, Steiner's preference of the homeland of the text over that of the state employs rhetorical strategies - i.e., the drawing of a line of inheritance that connects Jewish sacred texts back to the Word of God - that could be used just as well to justify the excellence of the state; and that have, in fact, been so used, as for instance by Levinas, when he argues that the state of Israel achieves its "true sovereignty" through its institutionalizing the</page><page sequence="17">CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT 65 justice of God, the justice that makes it possible "for a man to see the face of an other" (Hand 260-61): Like an empire on which the sun never sets, a religious history extends the size of its modest territory, even to the point where it absorbs a breath-taking past. But, contrary to national histories, this past, like an ancient civilization, places itself above nations, like a fixed star. And yet we are the living ladder that reaches up to the sky. Doesn't Israel's particular past consist in something both eternal and ours? This peculiar right, revealed by an undeniable Jewish experience, to call our own a doctrine that is none the less offered to everyone, marks the true sovereignty of Israel. It is not its political genius nor its artistic genius nor even its scientific genius (despite all they promise) that forms the basis of its majority, but its religious genius! The Jewish people therefore achieves a State whose prestige none the less stems from the religion which modern political life supplants. (260) For Levinas, there is the homeland of Israel, for Steiner, that of the text, sacred and secular (political, artistic, scientific). Both scholars employ an argument that begs the question, and begs it in a similar way, so it is perhaps wrong for Steiner to promote the text over the state by claiming that the text is articulative of something - i.e., divinity - that a state can never be. Which text? Which state? Not Israel, thinks Steiner, but maybe its texts. That is, while he argues that all texts have a quality of the secondary, of the exilic, about them, some texts - most notably, sacred texts - exhibit a greater sense of recognition, of a recall of a mystery which, in our postlapsarian condition, escapes too rapidly into the crevices of our quotidianness. Before the Fall, things were otherwise. Then, "[t]hings were as Adam named them and said them to be. Word and world were one" (OHT 8). But "[a]fter the Fall," says Steiner, "memories and dreams, which are so often messianic recollections of futurity, become the store- house of experience and of hope. Hence the need to re-read, to re-call (revocation) those texts in which the mystery of a beginning, in which the vestiges of a lost self-evidence - God's 'I am that I am* - are current" (OHT 8). For someone whose Jewishness has been described as "secular" (RGS 267), this predicates a lot of argument on what almost amounts to a literal reading of the Bible. Steiner knows this, and undoubtedly does not wish to proceed too far this way, but he is almost obliged to, given the emphasis placed on the textuality of Jewish experience. By claiming that Judaism "holds Christianity, and, indeed, mankind... hostage," that its rejection of Christ "has condemned man to the treadmill of history" (TGD 41), Steiner is in danger of making too much of Jewish textuality, to the point that his blueprint threatens a permanent exile to the people of the</page><page sequence="18">66 Religion &amp; Literature Book. He is proud of this textuality, proud that "[i]n Judaism, the letter is the life of the spirit" (OHT 1 7), and proud that "the God to whom the Jew would stand so near is, by virtue of implacable abstraction, of the unfath- omable elevation attributed to Him, furtherest from man" (OHT 6). But unless there be some reversal of direction, away from an argument that has so much poststructuralist coloring about it, there can be no real talk of homecoming. Textuality will have won out. In his later work, Steiner moves in seemingly contradictory directions. He likes opposing Jewish textuality to Christian a-textuality, and suggest- ing that this shows the greater fortitude and wisdom of the Jewish people. But by composing a binary grounded in an antithesis, something is also lost, not only as far as Christianity (now opposed to History) is concerned, but also as far as Judaism is concerned. That is, by placing Christianity on the side of Logos, and Judaism on the side of History, Steiner threatens to cut off Jewish experience from what first makes it meaningful: the claim to be God's chosen people. Steiner is ambivalent about this claim, and has angered many Jews by the linkage made, in The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H., between it and the claim of Nazism. (Hitler: "My racism was a parody of yours, a hungry imitation. What is a thousand-year Reich com- pared with the eternity of Zion? Perhaps I was the false Messiah sent before. Judge me and you must judge yourselves. Ubermenschen, chosen ones!" [164]) Still, without this claim, and without some credence in it, the propensity to see both Jewish and Christian Scripture as sacred would quickly lose its valency. Steiner is not yet ready to give up this much. Still, his general ambivalence makes his appeal to Genesis and the Fall seem forced, and makes his argument that between God and the Jews "the concepts of contract and of covenant are not metaphoric" (OHT 8) seem rhetorical. Nevertheless, Steiner chooses not to abandon the Jew to a textuality that is all post-script, and he or she is said to act out a "pre- script," "to inhabit the literal text of his [or her] foreseen being" (OHT 1 2). More fully, Steiner writes: No other community in the evolution and social history of man has, from its outset, read, re-read without cease, learnt by heart or by rote, and expounded without end the texts which spell out its whole destiny. These texts, moreover, are felt to be of transcendent authorship and authority, infallible in their /&gt;r*-diction, as oracles in the pagan world, notoriously, are not. The script, therefore, is a contract with the inevitable. God has, in the dual sense of utterance and of binding affirmation, 'given His word.' His Logos and His bond to Israel. It cannot be broken or refuted. (OHT 12)</page><page sequence="19">CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT 67 It is because Jews conceive of their relation to God as contractual, says Steiner, that they have cultivated a clerical mode, attentive to the conserva- tion and dissemination of the contract as well as the obligations enjoined by it: "The mystery and the practises of clerisy are fundamental to Juda- ism. No other tradition or culture has ascribed a comparable aura to the conservation and transcription of texts. In no other has there been an equivalent mystique of the philological" (OHT 1 7). All this has impor- tance to Judaism's doctrinal demands and more general Zeitgeist. Steiner is more interested in the latter, in the consequences ensuing from the Jewish people's subservience to the Book. For him, there is, as noted, something exilic about books. They also encourage our own separation from the activity and commotion about us. Reading a book, we step out of the "real" world, and into an extraterritorial space. This departure, or chosen exile, often increases our detachment regarding the world as found. We become more disinterested. It is this relation between bookishness and detachment, or disinterest, that helps to explain, says Steiner, the Jewish character, particularly as it has been shaped by its long, historical relation to the Book: "It is because he lives, enacts privately and historically, a written writ, a promissory note served on him when God sought out Abraham and Moses, it is because the 'Book of Life' is, in Judaism, literally textual, that the Jew dwells apart" (OHT 1 2). Jewish bookishness, however, does not stop with the Bible; it carries over into a more general respect for books, and this respect, in turn, has dialectically molded and distinguished the Jewish character. Thus Steiner speaks of "the sometimes hallucinatory techniques and disciplines of attention to the text, the mystique of fidelity to the written word, the reverence bestowed on its expositors and transmit- ters, concentrated within Judaic sensibility unique strengths and purities of disinterested purpose" (OHT 1 7). For Steiner, it is this latter phase - where would-be clerics, raised in the tradition of the Book, begin to take an interest in secular texts - that has always most interested him. It is a phase that only begins to acquire bulk in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, after the processes of assimilation (itself related to the factors of urbanization and the growth of the middle class) made it possible for Jews to participate in the larger intellectual life of Europe and North America. Earlier, I mentioned Steiner's conviction that Jewish intellectual life experienced something like a golden age during this period. If it were so, it is, he says, because Jewish clerical traditions easily adapted themselves to the disciplines of humanistic schol- arship, mathematics, and science. The accomplishments were not, at first,</page><page sequence="20">68 Religion &amp; Literature as significant in the arts because the Hebraic restrictions regarding mime- sis discouraged them ("Graven Images"). This, however, has changed in the present century, as witnessed by the extraordinary achievements of Kafka, Proust, Chagall, Celan, Schoenberg, Mandelstam, Gershwin, Rothko, Bellow, Roth, et al. In any event, this history of bookishness, first religious and then less so, must be credited with placing a disproportionate number of Jewish intellectuals at the forefront of modern culture: "The 'bookish' genius of Marx and of Freud, of Wittgenstein and of Levi- Strauss, is a secular deployment of the long schooling in abstract, specula- tive commentary and clerkship in the exegetic legacy (while being at the same time a psychological-sociological revolt against it). The Jewish pres- ence, often overwhelming, in modern mathematics, physics, economic and social theory, is direct heir to that abstinence from the approximate, from the mundane, which constitutes the ethos of the cleric" (OHT 1 7). Steiner can be, as his readers know, chauvinistic about this achievement. It is, for instance, a little disconcerting to find that he thinks there is little in United States culture that merits attention once the contributions of the Puritans and the Jews have been accounted for. Or as Steiner says in regard to post- War American culture: "Think away the arrival of the Jewish intelligentsia, think away the genius of Leningrad-Prague-Budapest- Vienna and Frank- furt in American culture of the past decades, and what have you left? For the very concept of an intelligentsia, of an elite minority infected with the leprosy of abstract thought, is radically alien to the essential American circumstance" (AE 73-74). This kind of thinking, so captive to ethnic and cultural stereotypes and the partisanship that goes with them, has a tragic enough history already, so it is a little dispiriting to see Steiner participating in it. In any event, this clerical tradition, that first engaged sacred and later secular texts, carried with it not only an expertise in hermeneutics, but also the faith - or maybe just the hope - that the text sui generis remains somehow valuable and sacred. It is faith which initially probably cannot imagine the text as existing other than a conduit of first meanings. Later, when it can imagine this, it must change its relation to texts, either by dramatically narrowing down the range of texts thought worthy of serious investigation or by changing its strategy vis-a-vis texts. This might mean moving away from a hermeneutics that engages texts ontologically and toward one that engages them otherwise, for instance ethnographically, historically, psychologically, sociologically, etc. The fact is, current criti- cism has thought it best to pursue the second avenue, to alter its strategy vis-a-vis texts. Steiner, however, still thinks it worthwhile, even important,</page><page sequence="21">CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT 69 to pursue the first avenue. He knows that this means ignoring the majority of texts, though it is not clear that he has fully weighed the consequences of this exclusion. Those critics who have chosen otherwise would no doubt find his selectivity this way neglectful and elitist. He, in turn, would fault them for prematurely withdrawing from the most important of investiga- tions: the pursuit of the meanings of meaning. Steiner knows that one cannot here make the claim - as it has been made for sacred texts - that secular texts issue from the very first source of meaning. But if they are not this - i.e., God-spoken - they may still be understood as participating in the sacred, to the extent, or in the sense, that this is identified with Order in its most transcendent, and thereby Divine, manifestation. If God has spoken Himself in the world, either through the prophets or the world itself, then we must assume that the voice is distinctive enough that those who seek it out, who are receptive, and honest with themselves and others, can hear it, if not all the time, at least some of the time, and that what they hear concurs, more or less, with what others of like attentiveness also hear. It is the assumption that underwrites religious life in general; and while artists ostensibly pursue other purposes, they have long been identified with a similar attentiveness or hearing, though this history seems to be coming to a close. It has closed for many, if not the majority, of artists working in the West. This latter fact helps to explain Steiner's own disen- chantment with contemporary Western art - "God, look at our literature in free Britain. Mountains of trivia and pretentiousness!" (RI 180) - particularly when compared to its Eastern European and Russian counter- parts. The point is, Steiner's interest as a critic specifically addresses that ambit of art that makes claims, if seldom explicitly, for what might be imagined as a largely unheard music, of a divine presence underwriting the world's dailiness. Here, "[w]hat is implicit is the notion of and expres- sion of 'real presence'" (GSR 85). This leads the critic, or reader, to proceed "as if the text was the housing of forces and meanings, of meanings of meaning, whose lodging within the executive verbal form was one of 'incarnation.' He reads as if - a conditionally which defines the 'provi- sional' temper of his pursuit - the singular presence of the life meaning in the text and work of art was 'a real presence' irreducible to analytic summations and resistant to judgement in the sense in which the critic can and must judge" (GSR 85). Steiner's most eloquent statement this way is found in Real Presences (1989), a book that must be thought of as near, if not the, pinnacle of his work so far, so beautifully does he articulate the argument that inscribes not simply art but all meaning in an Absolute. The book's success partly</page><page sequence="22">70 Religion &amp; Literature follows from the fact that, unlike some of the earlier books, Steiner achieves a less acrid, more conciliatory, tone. Of course, there is enough acridity for those who want it - e.g., "[t]he entire notion of research in modern letters is vitiated by the evidently false postulate that tens of thousands of young men and women will have anything new and just to say about Shakespeare or Keats or Flaubert" (35) - and by ordinary standards, there should seem a lot. Still, on the whole, the book is a more measured and thoughtful effort than his previous work in cultural criticism, In Bluebeard's Castle. Included among its strengths are not only the lucidity of the analysis but also the willingness to front the embarrassment that holds forth in the academy with regard to questions about ultimate meaning, and particu- larly about the Deity. He is perfectly cognizant that ours is a time "in which embarrassment terrorizes even the confident" and that the prevailing criticisms prefer to "'play it cool'" (RP 1 78), avoiding those risks that might easily be confused with intellectual naivete. Steiner is not immune to these embarrassments, yet he thinks the question of meaning - i.e., of what we take, or do not take, to be the foundation of what we say and do - is of such extraordinary importance that it is worthwhile to put fears momen- tarily aside. Thus in Real Presences, Steiner proposes what only a neophyte or a provocateur would dare to suggest - that is, "that any coherent understanding of what language is and how language performs, that any coherent account of the capacity of human speech to communicate mean- ing and feeling is, in the final analysis, underwritten by the assumption of God's presence" (RP 3). It is a daring thesis, and Steiner does not imagine it attracting many sympathetic readers among academicians. Toward the end, he says as much and offers a reason: "I know that this formulation will be unaccept- able not only to those who will read a book such as this, but also to the prevailing climate of thought and of feeling in our culture. It is just this unacceptability which characterizes what I have called a time of 'epilogue,' an immanence within the logic of the 'afterword'" (RP 228). By this, he means that in the present, after the lessons of Mallarme, Stein, Joyce and Derrida, our current paradigm of meaning is less transcendent than self- reflexive, of words calling forth other words calling forth other words, in an unending round robin of textuality. And it is not only words which are imagined as operating this way, but so are events, including the events of our lives, mired in a history that moves nowhere except further into the recesses, or black holes, of contingency. There are stoics among us who are not threatened by such a paradigm, and who tend to pooh-pooh the expressed misgivings of those who are. There are others who, while less</page><page sequence="23">CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT 7 1 stoical, view matters as out of their hands, and who resign themselves to whatever scenario appears most aggressive and powerful. Forcefulness here gets identified with things as they are, or as they are entropically predetermined to be. Steiner himself is cognizant of this, and knows that the scenario he offers may, to the present generation and its heirs, appear passe, or nostalgic, something better sloughed off like an old skin. If this happens, as it already is happening, then, believes Steiner, the whole nature of our thinking about aesthetics will change dramatically: "It may well be that the forgetting of the question of God will be the nub of cultures now nascent. It may be that the verticalities of reference to 'higher things/ to the impalpable and mythical which are still incised in our grammars, which are still the ontological guarantors of the arcs of metaphor, will drain from speech. . . . Should these mutations of consciousness and expres- sion come into force, the forms of aesthetic making as we have known them will no longer be productive" (RP 230). It is almost a truism, something that those on both sides of the debate can agree on: our definition of aesthetics is crucially intertwined with the way we understand the meanings of meaning. Things only get contestable when we try to fill in the equation. In the present climate, Steiner's conviction that all things, aesthetics included, lean either toward or away from an Absolute, the determinant of their worth, is almost quarrelsome. No matter, he thinks, for while it may be possible to imagine the universe as something like an unending, directionless flux, the fact that this scenario offers so little in the way of human consolation, so little to offset the blunt fact of death - not only our own but that of those nearest to us - almost forces us to imagine things otherwise. Steiner's religiosity is never less than tentative, yet he still thinks a Pascalian wager almost required. In Real Presences he writes that a "wager on the meaning of meanings, on the potential insight and response when one human voice addresses another, when we come face to face with the text and the work of art or music, which is to say when we encounter the other in its condition of freedom, is a wager on transcendence" (4). The wager is that these interactions not only mean something (for contingency theory says nothing less), but that they are reflections of a larger meaning, underwriting and reinforcing them to the degree that they are truthful. The wager, then, predicates not only meaning but meaningfulness. Steiner writes: "This wager - it is that of Descartes, of Kant and of every poet, artist, composer of whom we have explicit record - predicates the pres- ence of a realness, of a 'substantion5 (the theological reach of this word is obvious) within language and form. It supposes a passage, beyond the fictive or the purely pragmatic, from meaning to meaningfulness. The</page><page sequence="24">72 Religion &amp; Literature conjecture is that 'God' is, not because our grammar is outworn; but that grammar lives and generates because there is the wager on God" (PR 4). The reference to grammar has a Wittgensteinian ring to it, particularly the Wittgenstein of the Tractatus, wherein the philosopher postulates an invisible form, or grammar, that conjoins representations and their ob- jects: "It is clear that however different from the real one an imagined world may be, it must have something - a form - in common with the real world" (35). Steiner himself believes this, believes that what we say and do - even our skepticisms and stoicisms - postulates a "tenor of trust' (RP 89) whereby we take for granted all sorts of benevolent facts about the world, including that of its logicality and our ability to imitate this. Also included is our belief, affirmed each time we write or speak a sentence, that words, singular or networked, can refer (even with startling accuracy and beauty) to things beyond themselves, and thereby make sense to others. "There would," Steiner sensibly says, "be no history as we know it, no religion, metaphysics, politics or aesthetics as we have lived them, without an initial act of trust, of confiding, more fundamental, more axiomatic by far than any 'social contract' or covenant with the postulate of the divine. This instauration of trust, this entrance of man into the city of man, is that between word and world" (RP 89). To say otherwise only throws us into the paradox of the Cretan calling all Cretans liars, whereby we would have to imagine that while all claims to speak the truth of things are essentially specious, this one claim must be thought otherwise. It makes for a spissatus- like truth. Thus, it seems wiser to grant the "Hebraic-Hellenic copula," so syntactically crucial to the history of our thought and language, a continu- ing centrality (RP 119). Here, Steiner argues that every time we join subject to predicate with the purpose of putting sense in a form recogniz- able to others, we also do something else: we affirm our belief in an equation which transcends the strict grammars of language and nature; we affirm our belief that the world holds together. Steiner quotes Derrida to the effect that "[t]he age of the sign is essentially theological" (RP 1 19), but whereas Derrida launches a revolt against this knowledge, Steiner wants to build on it. "The archetypal paradigm," he says, "of all affirmations of sense and of significant plenitude - the fullness of meaning - is a Logos- model" (RP 1 19). Things originate with the Logos. We do not call on it so much as it cadis on us; it summons us. Steiner writes: "That which comes to call onus - that idiom... connotes both spontaneous visitation and sum- mons - will very often do so unbidden. Even where there is a readiness, as in the concert hall, in the museum, in the moment of chosen reading, the true entrance into us will not occur by an act of will" (RP 1 79).</page><page sequence="25">CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT 73 For Steiner, the relation between sacred and secular texts of the highest sort is, as noted, an overlapping one. Distinguishing them both is this quality of summons, though one assumes the summons will be greater in Isaiah than in Henry James. In one sense, Steiner accepts this, which leads him to recoil from the whole premise of The Literary Guide to the Bible, with its implicit embarrassment regarding the claims that sacred texts, including the Hebrew and Christian Bibles, make: "The separation, made in the name of current rationalism and agnosticism, between a theological- religious experiencing of Biblical texts and a literary one is radically factitious. It cannot work" ("The Good Books," 97). In a second sense, however, he finds the distinction hard to make, for it is precisely this imputation of summons that he believes characterizes art work at its most profound. He writes: "The relations between the sacred and the legally or ethically prescriptive ('the worded5) on the one hand, and the poetic or fictive on the other, have always been vexed. What matters is that literary invention should be regarded, be it with welcome or with mistrust..., as one of the foundational triad. In the poem, in the prayer, in the law, the reach of words is made very nearly equivalent to the humanity of man" (RP 189). Steiner seeks here to offer a definition of civilization, not to chart the difference between the sacred and the aesthetic, but even from this, it is clear that he imagines an unusual intimacy between the two. They both summon us to an experience that is thought to originate not only outside of ourselves but also outside of our world. Or as Steiner, making more explicit the relation between the aesthetic and the theological, writes: "The ascrip- tion of beauty to truth and to meaning is either a rhetorical flourish, or it is a piece of theology. It is a theology, explicit or suppressed, masked or avowed, substantive or imaged, which underwrites the presumption of creativity, of signification in our encounters with text, music, art. The meaning of meaning is a transcendent postulate. To read the poem re- sponsibly ('respondingly'), to be answerable to form, is to wager on a reinsurance of sense" (RP 216). The suggestion is that while not all texts reputed to be sacred are so (i.e., command our full-fledged respect), not all aesthetic texts - which of course make no overt claims of inspiration - need be thought as existing outside the realm of the sacred. In the first instance, Steiner grants that "much in the Old Testament burns with tribal folly" and brutality (SR 69), while, in the second instance, he argues that art, when it appears (in Joyce's words) "grave and constant," may well be thought of as sacred, or at least religious:</page><page sequence="26">74 Religion &amp; Literature I am arguing that the "gravity" and the "constancy" are, finally, religious. As is the category of meaningfuJness. They are religious in two main senses. The first is obvious. The Oresteia, King Lear, Dostoevsky's The Devils no less than the art of Giotto or the Passions of Bach, inquire into, dramatize, the relations of man and woman to the existence of the gods or of God. It is the Hebraic intuition that God is capable of all speech-acts except that of monologue which has generated our arts of reply, of questioning, and counter-creation. After the Book of Job and Euripides' Bacchae, there had to be, if man was to bear his being, the means of dialogue with God which are spelt out in our poetics, music, art. The gravity and constancy at the heart of major forms and of our understand- ing of them are religious in a second, more diffuse sense. They enact... a root- impulse of the human spirit to explore the possibilities of meaning and of truth that lie outside empirical seizure or proof. (RP 225) Crucial to Steiner's grasp of the religious element in our texts, be they sacred, judicial or aesthetic, is the suggestion of dialogue. They begin in response to a summons, to something larger than ourselves requiring us to bend toward it, to give answer. The summons may, as in Scripture, have the force of God's impress, or it may, as in the art of a Schoenberg, Rothko or Kieslowski, have a lesser force, more akin to intuition than revelation. Still, whether it be one or the other, a response appears called for. This response may take the form of a respectful silence, the sort advocated by Wittgenstein and often spoken of approvingly by Steiner: "For the Tractatus, the truly 'human' being, the man or woman most open to the solicitations of the ethical and the spiritual, is he who keeps silent before the essential" (RP 103). Or the response may take the form of the poet's or the musician's most expressive articulation of what it means to be human, what it means to be unhoused, to dwell apart from, and largely ignorant of, the source of our being: "Serious painting, music, literature or sculpture make palpable to us, as do no other means of communication, the unassuaged, unhoused instability and estrangement of our condition" (RP 139). In the latter instance, the artist's work can also function as a summons to others capable of responding to that which in the art transcends its own bound- aries and somehow gives voice to the source of its inspiration. Thus it is, says Steiner, that "[t]he encounter with the aesthetic is, together with certain modes of religious and of metaphysical experience, the most 'in- gressive,' transformative summons available to human experiencing.... [T]he shorthand image is that of an Annunciation, of 'a terrible beauty' or gravity breaking into the small house of our cautionary being'" (RP 143). At this level, art is both a response and an enticement to a response, implying a dialogic equation that makes our relation with the Creator more than simply a passive experience. William James, in The Varieties of Religious Experience, once wrote:</page><page sequence="27">CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT 75 The religious phenomenon, studied as an inner fact, and apart from ecclesiastical or theological complications, has shown itself to consist everywhere, and at all its stages, in the consciousness which individuals have of an intercourse between themselves and higher powers with which they feel themselves to be related. This intercourse is realized at the time as being both active and mutual. If it be not effective; if it be not a give and take relation; if nothing is really transacted while it lasts; if the world is in no whit different for its having taken place; then prayer, taken in this wide meaning of a sense that something is transacting, is of course a feeling of what is illusory, and religion must on the whole be classed, not simply as containing elements of delusion, - these undoubtedly everywhere exist, - but as being rooted in delusion altogether, just as materialists and atheists have always said it was. (465) Steiner, I think, would agree. We pray and we make art because we anticipate a response. We imagine an Other, a Deity, whose investment in us is not unlike our investment in Him. We assume that the world's final shape is not predetermined and that we can make a difference. If this be not the case, then the purposes of religion and art (as conceived here) must appear terribly empty. But we - or many of us - proceed as if this is the case. We see this in the rabbi's unending dialogue with the sacred texts; and we see this in the artist's assumption of authorship, a model taking the Creator as its inspiration. "I take the aesthetic act," says Steiner, "the conceiving and bringing into being of that which, very precisely, could not have been conceived or brought into being, to be an imitatio, a replication on its own scale, of the inaccessible first fiat' (RP 201). The reasons for this imitation can be complicated. The motivation can be one of emulation, or it can be one of rivalry, of an attempt to provoke God, to make Him step out from behind the plane of His invisibility. In either case, the gesture postulates that we are not mere passive adjuncts to reality but that we ourselves can author our own responses: "A Lagw-aesthetic and hermeneutic is one of reference to authorship, to the potential of 'authority' contained within that word and concept. All mimesis, thematic variation, quotation, ascription of intended sense, derives from a postulate of creative presence" (RP 101). Inherent in this postulate is the sense that our authored re- sponses to the world, our answering to the Deity, entail the demands of responsibility, of answerability. Question and answer here bespeak the same equation. "There can be," writes Steiner in Heidegger, "no life-giving precision, no responsibility when question and answer do not relate, where they do not spring from a common ontological center" (31). The artist engages in a back-and-forth dialogue with the universe, and with the Author of this universe. And yet, whatever confidence the artist places in this dialogue, he or she cannot escape the fact that we dwell apart from the home of being and are unhoused:</page><page sequence="28">76 Religion &amp; Literature It is poetics, in the full sense, which informs us of the visitor's visa in place and in time which defines our status as transients in a house of being whose foundations, whose future history, whose rationale - if any - lie wholly outside our will and comprehension. It is the capacity of the arts, in a definition which must, I believe, be allowed to include the living forms of the speculative (what tenable vision of poetics will exclude Plato, Pascal, Nietzsche?), to make us, if not at home, at least alertly, answerably peregrine in the unhousedness of our human circumstance. Without the arts, form would remain unmet and strangeness without speech in the silence of the stone. (RP 140) For Steiner, men and women are unhoused, but often do not know it. The artist knows it, and this puts him or her in alliance with the rabbi or priest. They each seek to find the way home, be it through sacred texts, moral action or aesthetic form. For the artist, it is mostly via the last of these that he or she works, attempting to seduce us into a recognition of what has been lost but might be recovered. The work will mean nothing for us, however, if we ourselves "do not redefine, if we do not re-experi- ence, the life of meaning in the text, in music, in art" (RP 49-50). This life has nothing to do with newness or with originality as generally conceived; rather, it has to do with something like a return to first being. "Originality" in art, says Steiner, "is antithetical to novelty. The etymology of the word alerts us. It tells of 'inception' and of 'instauration,' of a return, in sub- stance and in form, to beginnings. In exact relation to their originality, to their spiritual-formal force of innovation, aesthetic inventions are 'ar- chaic.' They carry in them the pulse of the distant source" (RP 27). This is why art, at its most powerful, must be conceived as a form of anagnorisis, of recognition in its fullest and most transcendent sense: "We must come to recognize, and the stress is on re-cognition, a meaningfulness which is that of a freedom of giving and of reception beyond the constraints of imma- nence" (RP 50). This is the way toward homecoming, the way toward what Steiner, in "Our Homeland, the Text," refers to as the "'Israel' of truth- seeking" (OHT 19). This is not a physical place, not a state alongside the Mediterranean, but that tropos which signifies the place wherein all contra- dictions vanish, and the universal reigns. Of course, religions can and have pointed the way. Steiner gives credit to Judaism for its invention of mono- theism and the primacy its bestows upon the Book; and he probably would agree with Vermes when he credits Christianity, or better yet Jesus, for "the underlying universalism" of his "doctrine of imitatio Deiy a God whose providence includes all, and his primary concern for the individual, thus permitting an easier dispensation from the mostly communal and social aspects of the Law of Moses" (213).1 But Steiner's religiosity feels ulti- mately uncomfortable when housed in doctrine. He cannot quite accept a</page><page sequence="29">CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT 77 Judaism that, in its orthodox manifestation, "continues in its often jejune formalism, in its feverish atrophy in ritualistic minutiae," that, in its Zionist manifestation, encourages the state of Israel's "savagery and corruption," and that, in its liberal manifestation, seems spiritually and metaphysically inert (TGD 48). Nor can he accept a Christianity, which since the Shoah, is "sick at heart" and "lamed, possibly terminally, by the paradox of revela- tion and of doctrine which generated not only the Shoah but the millennia of anti-Jewish violence, humiliation and quarantine which are its obvious background" (TGD 47). In the end, for Steiner, there can be "no syna- gogue, no ecclesia, no polis, no nation, no ethnic community which is not worth leaving' (IT 397). It is a melancholy conclusion, predicated on his belief that a nation, in time, will always act in an unacceptable manner, and that "[a] synagogue will one day excommunicate Spinoza, it must" (TT 397). It is better, he thinks, to place one's trust directly in the Absolute, and to distrust all those instances wherein two or more are gathered in the name of some cause, or lord: "Personally, I believe that anarchy is one of the ideals and hopes and Utopias of anyone who wants to do serious thinking and work. It is when you find yourself agreeing with another person you should begin to suspect that you are talking nonsense. I repeat: there is no community of love, no family, no interest, caste, profession, or social class not worth resigning from" (TT 397-98). For me, there is something too hubristic about Steiner's stance, about the suggestion that one's salvation is an individual matter, unrelated to the good works and faithfulness of others. William James once noted that "[o]ur faith is faith in someone else's faith, and in the greatest matters this is most the case." It is difficult to believe in anything, not to mention something invisible, without some form of concurrence. As is his wont, Steiner prefers to go it alone, to conceive of the Deity as an abstraction characterized as much by its absence as by its presence. This sense of absence is heightened by the Shoah, when so many Jews experienced "the dark of God's absence" (LS 167). And while this emotion is, obviously, not to be discounted, there also seems something personal about Steiner's stress on God's absence. Or maybe I am misreading him here, and his stress on God's absence has more to do with the fact that there is some- thing almost archaic about the Hebrew Bible's God, making it easier to imagine Him in the past tense. Even before the Shoah, this God, says Steiner, seemed notably absent. In Bluebeard's Castle, he writes, "To all but a very few the Mosaic God has been from the outset, even when passionately invoked, an immeasurable Absence, or a metaphor modulating downward to the natural sphere of poetic, imagistic approximation" (38). This is the</page><page sequence="30">78 Religion &amp; Literature way Steiner imagines Him: an unfathomable First Cause and Principle of Perfection, almost more tellingly revealed in the work of the greatest artists than of those more ostensibly religious. "Above all," he writes in "Lan- guage Under Surveillance," "it is in art and literature that the Messianic challenge, the potential of human ripening and deliverance, is enacted and transmitted across time" (36). Free from the matrix of power, and working in isolation, the artist here feels, as few others do, "responsible toward the claims and provocations of the ideal" (36). The demand on the artist is to acknowledge the Ideal, that place which counts as home. In Antigones, Steiner speaks of the "co-ordinates of Idealism" as "exile and attempted homecoming" (14). Until one completes the journey of becoming (which, by definition, never ends), a person exists as an exile from being. Mindful of this, the artist, more than others, holds to the path. But as described by Steiner, it is a rather solitary adventure, not suitable for those of a social or non-intellectual temper. Thus, he praises Benjamin for withdrawing from life (R 38) and Lukacs for making a homeland of the mind (MH 67). And when Steiner considers his own demise, he thinks that "[a] man need not be buried in Israel. Highgate or Golders Green or the wind will do" (LS 154). In the interim, Steiner is increasingly drawn to music, thinking it an embodiment of the Ideal. "Personally," he writes in the "Introduction" to his Reader, "I find myself needing music more and more. The number of books one feels one must read diminishes; it is re-reading that matters. Music, on the contrary, grows indispensable, as if it had become the elect companion of identity, the homecoming to that inside oneself which time has in its keeping" (GSR 18). It is a thought that he has expressed throughout his writings, though in the fullness of the claim, it also harkens back to his statement, in Bluebeard's Castle, that music increasingly served him and those he knew as a substitute for a religion no longer thought tenable: one does know of a good many individual and familial existences in which the performance or enjoyment of music has functions as subtly indispensable, as exalting and consoling, as religious practices might have, or might have had formerly. It is this indispensability which strikes one, the feeling (which I share) that there is music one cannot do without for long, that certain pieces of music rather than, say, books, are the talisman of order and of trust inside oneself. In the absence or recession of religious belief, close-linked as it was to the classic primacy of language, music seems to gather, to harvest us to ourselves. (BG 1 22) For me, the stance mistakenly conflates two things - religion and music - which, whatever their affinities, need, more importantly, to be under-</page><page sequence="31">CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT 79 stood as separate. If the consolations that music offers do not seem pale in comparison to those offered by this or that religion, then the religion must itself be weakly imagined. To return to James's suggestion, if the practice of religion changes nothing in the world, if everything is as it was found, and if there be no felt experience of real conversation between oneself, or - selves, and the Deity, then yes, music can be compared to religion, for the consolation that each offers, in this instance, is of a largely psychological, or therapeutic, nature; it is a consolation enwrapped in the individual's own estimation of self, and its "harvest" may well be understood reflex- ively, as a homecoming "to ourselves." Steiner would, no doubt, resent this representation of his thinking, but his extolling of music to the point that it becomes something akin to an object of worship forces us to ask, if not to Whom, then to What are we answerable, and in exactly what way? In Real Presences, he writes that "music puts our being as men and women in touch with that which transcends the sayable, which outstrips the analysable. Music is plainly uncircumscribed by the world as the latter is an object of scientific determination and practical harnessing. The meanings of the meaning of music transcend. It has long been, it continues to be, the unwritten theology of those who lack or reject any formal creed. Or to put it reciprocally: for many human beings, religion has been the music which they believe in" (218). It is an extraordinary rhetorical flight, but once it is over, what are we left with? Are we to worship music? mathematics? or the Abstraction that they imply? Steiner comes close to suggesting that we are to do just this. This view, for instance, is implicit in the praise that he bestows on the "Jewish abstractionists," by whom he means Lukacs, Bloch, Benjamin, Adorno, Marcuse, Wittgenstein and others. In an essay on Lukacs, he writes: Unhoused, peregrine, domestic in ostracism, he is one of that tragic constellation - Ernst Bloch, Walter Benjamin, Adorno, Herbert Marcuse - of Jewish abstractionists, possessed by a messianic rage for logic, for systematic order in the social condition of man. Lukacs's Marxism is, in essence, a refusal of the world's incoherence, of the murderous stupidities whereby men and women misconduct their lives. Like the other Jewish self-exiles whose radicalism out of Central Europe has so incisively marked the century, Lukacs is an heir in immanence to the transcendent absolute of Spinoza. (MH 67) And it is implicit in his monkish, but not monkish, fantasy about a temperate clime, distant from the "hellish" world, where one can indulge in the pursuit of abstraction for its own sake: It is perfectly conceivable that there is a small strip on the world's map (this was Herodotus's view, also Thucydides', also Plato's) where the climate is more or less</page><page sequence="32">80 Religion &amp; Literature bearable, temperate, where there is enough protein to eat, where there are slaves - that is, subject peoples who allow you to get on with the business of thinking, which means that you can spend your day doing something fantastic, like examining the geometry of conic sections (which is what Archimedes dies for), that you can do this quite insane and obsessive thing - to give your life to abstraction, to a speculation, to pure mathematics. Perhaps there is one part of the earth that produces complex theorems, algebraic theorems, of a very involved and difficult and totally useless nature, that produces not religious faith but that immense luxury we call metaphysical speculative systems. (TT 396) This happy "strip" where abstraction is indulged appears more a temp- tation than an answer. Throughout his career, Steiner has reminded us of the cost of abstraction, of the cry more soundly heard when it originates in a novel rather than next door. And in the passage just quoted, Steiner ends by saying that "[climatically, foodwise, survival-wise, this is not open to everyone" (TT 396). Still, the temptation has always been a particularly seductive one for Steiner, and it colors what he has to say about "real presences" underwriting the text. He makes reference to God often enough, but it is a God lacking in warmth and other, decidedly anthropomorphic, characteristics that we like to attribute to "Him": caring, mercy, justice, etc. Instead, Steiner's God easily slips into the dress of abstraction, identi- fied in terms - e.g., Being, Logos, Presence - more likely to warm the hearts of a convention of philosophers than a congregation of ordinary men and women seeking something, or rather Someone, to place their trust in. Steiner's critics have noted this. Robert E Carroll, referring to Real Presences (where "the question of God [is addressed] more fully than in anything else" Steiner has written), says that its God is likable to "'tran- scendence,' that is, the undefined, unknown God, rather than the overdetermined, overdefined God of traditional Jewish religion and Chris- tian ecclesiastical creeds" (RGS 266). And Harold Fromm, taking a harsher view, says that "his God is not really God, his transcendence has no literal characteristics he can clearly name apart from his own feelings, his religion has no tenets or contents" (402). Finally, Graham Ward notes that Steiner's "ontology of reading is described in distinctly Catholic (Heidegger's theo- logical background) terms: 'transubstantial,' 'real presence,' 'sacramental,' 'incarnation,' 'icon,' and 'revelation'"; but that much is also unresolved here for the reason that "he is attempting to interlace a sociology and an ontology of literature" (RGS 1 92). In short, says Ward, Steiner's "wants a synthesis of the ontic and the ontological, and it is all too easy to create the synthesis by being 'eloquent of God'" (RGS 92).</page><page sequence="33">CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT 8 1 Steiner's theology finds itself drawn away by other interests. It invokes the terms of theology, but in the end it is really about other things. It is about literature, music, philosophy, rhetoric, and the Shoah. But it is also about longing, and this I find its most interesting aspect and greatest strength. That is, what I find so attractive about Steiner's work here is just how emotionally involved he is in wanting the world to make sense, to hold together. It is true that this is not necessarily a religious project, but the asking of such questions is, it seems to me, at the heart of theology, particularly a theology that thinks the asking of questions one of the most valuable things we can do. Steiner has suggested that Judaism is itself a- theological, that its textuality makes it ill at ease with the construction of answers that are inherently a-historical. In "The Long Life of Metaphor," he writes that "the very notion of 'theology,' in the post-Pauline, post- Johannine, and post-Augustinian sense, has no real counterpart in Jewish religious feeling. The most authentic and lasting strength in Jewish sensi- bility is not a reflection or metaphysical discourse on the nature and attributes of God, but a 'living in His presence'" (55). Again, for Steiner, Judaism's relation to God is thought more dialogic, and Christianity's more duty-bound. It is, as said earlier, a hard antithesis to maintain, dismissing (among other things) the importance of the Torah in the life of the observant Jew and the importance of prayer in the life of the observant Christian. It is better to admit the importance of questioning to both religions, something that Steiner himself does, in effect, when in "Anglican Inadequacies," he approvingly quotes the Protestant theologian Donald MacKinnon: "If Christianity survives it will be in part at least because the lonely figure, dying in agony upon the cross, crying out in dereliction to the Father, whom he believes to have forsaken him, remains ceaselessly inter- rogating men and women, outside as much as within the Christian churches, concerning his significance and that of his supreme hour. 'What think you of this man?'" (1238). In truth, George Steiner has, as Robert Carroll points out, always combined a "knowledge of things Jewish with a sensitiv- ity to things Christian" (RGS 269), and it is this, rather than what Ward describes as an inexplicable "Christocentric" imagery, that best explains the beautiful closing passage in Real Presences: But ours is the long day's journey of the Saturday. Between suffering, aloneness, unutterable waste on the one hand and the dream of liberation, of rebirth on the other. In the face of the torture of a child, of the death of love which is Friday, even the greatest art and poetry are almost helpless. In the Utopia of the Sunday, the aesthetic will, presumably, no longer have logic or necessity. The apprehensions</page><page sequence="34">82 Religion &amp; Literature and figurations in the play of metaphysical imagining, in the poem and the music, which tell of pain and hope, of the flesh which is said to taste of ash and of the spirit which is said to have the savour of fire, are always Sabbatarian. They have risen out of an immensity of waiting which is that of man. Without them, how could we be patient? (RP 232) True, Steiner employs an Easter allegory, but he also intersects it with the Jewish Sabbath, and it is the Sabbath - the Saturday characterized by waiting for the "Utopia of Sunday" (the release day from history's bond- age), as well as the art and music composed in this period - that is the reality in place: "ours is the long day's journey of the Saturday." It is an image that might be critiqued for the way it sets Judaism and Christianity in opposition, but it is also one that quite beautifully yokes them together. In doing so, it also calls forth all Steiner's own longings and doubts, which, as I say, need not be thought of as a-theological, and are certainly not thought of so here.

This is where Marx is most profoundly a Jew - while at the same time arguing the dissolution of Jewish identity. He believed that class and economic status knew no frontiers, that misery had a common citizenship. He postulated that the revolutionary process would abolish national distinctions and antagonisms as industrial technology had all but eroded regional autonomy. The entire socialist Utopia and dialectic of history is based on an international premise. (LS 153) WORKS CITED Abel, Lionel. "So Who is to Have the Last Word?
