Malloy and Stergios Botzakis France International research correspondent, Jacques Fijalkow In his report, research correspondent Jacques Fijalkow presents research into variations of reading motivation related to students' socioeconomic status (SES), age, and gender. Three of these studies were presented at an international colloqui- um in Huy, Belgium, in 2002 and later published in a special issue of Caractkre in 2003. In the first of these studies, the 2000 Programme for International Student Assessment was used to assess the reading performances of 15-year-olds as well as their reading habits and attitudes (Lafontaine, 2003). A composite index of en- gagement and reading profiles was built by using cluster analysis, which identified four different profiles ranging from highly diversified to poorly diversified and longer to shorter text. The proportion of students in each profile varied widely among the countries that participated in the study, and gender and reading profiles were found to be closely linked. Females were found to be more numerous in the profile category identified as "diversifiedpreferring longer texts," whereas males were more numerous in the profile named "diversifiedpreferring shorter texts." Students in the two more highly diversified profiles revealed better reading performances than those in the less diversified profiles. Engagement for reading was also found to vary among countries. For example, it was high in all of the Nordic countries and Japan but quite low in many European countries such as France, Belgium, and Germany. Another finding was that engagement strongly correlated with reading per- formance and gender. After background variables such as gender and SES on indi- vidual and institutional levels were controlled for, engagement was shown to have the third highest correlation with reading performance following grade level and immigration status. The results also illustrated that strong reading engagement seemed to compensate for an underprivileged background. Students from less priv- ileged backgrounds who were highly engaged in reading performed better than stu- dents from equivalent to somewhat more privileged backgrounds whose engagement in reading was weak. The aim of the second study (Chouinard, Theoret, Van Grunderbeeck, Cartier, &amp; Garon, 2003) was to compare the self-perceptions of, and value accord- ed to reading by, boys and girls of low SES and to investigate the change in these variables during the first years of secondary school. To this end, a self-report ques- tionnaire was administered in a three-year survey to 78 French-speaking students of low SES (28 girls, 50 boys) from three schools in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Analysis of variance using repeated measures showed that boys reported lower en- 514</page><page sequence="2">International Reports on Literacy Research 515 couragement from significant social agents, such as teachers, family, and peers, and higher anxiety levels when they read. Furthermore, boys displayed lower achievement goals and less interest in reading than did the girls who responded. Analyses revealed no variations of these results over time. In the third of these related studies, Schillings (2003) used a longitudinal design to investigate the development of intellectual and social competencies for reading comprehension in adolescents. Funded from 1999 to 2003 by a French-speaking commu- nity in Belgium, the study was designed to examine the transition from childhood to adolescence in a sample of 370 students. Whereas a range of skills was studied, the author was responsible for explor- ing the development of reading comprehension skills. Based on a theoretical framework of reading engagement outlined by Guthrie and Alvermann (1999), this study explored the links between moti- vation for reading (Baker &amp; Wigfield, 1999), metacognitive reading awareness (Jacobs &amp; Paris, 1987), and reading achievement. Subjects were test- ed at the end of grade 6, which is the final grade lev- el in primary school. An analysis of structural equation modeling revealed a statistical validation of the process of engagement adapted from Guthrie and Alvermann. In addition, recent research in France has in- vestigated issues of gender in children's literature. For example, Dafflon (2002a) conducted a study aimed at building an inventory of heroes and hero- ines in Francophone children's literature published in 1997. As a result, notable quantitative differences were found to exist between the central main char- acters of both sexes. Male main characters systemati- cally outnumbered female main characters regardless of the nature of the characters or their age. Books written for the youngest children were found to contain the greatest number of disparities between male and female central roles, primarily in books written by male authors. These findings echo those of comparable studies of Anglo-Saxon children's literature. Another study (Dafflon, 2002b) was carried out to further examine gender stereotypes in Francophone children's literature. This time, the au- thor analyzed stories with anthropomorphic heroes that appeared in Francophone journals for preschool children during the 1999-2000 school years. Results highlighted important quantitative and qualitative asymmetries existing between representations of both genders, often to the detriment of females. Males outnumbered females and were more often represented in the central role. Furthermore, females were more often depicted in stereotypical ways, such as being homemakers, and played less varied profes- sional roles than males. Females were also less repre- sented in the illustrations than males. These asymmetries were discussed in terms of how they in- fluence children's construction of gender identity as well as their development of self-esteem and future aspirations, particularly for girls. In a more recent study, Dafflon (in press) used a different methodology to gain insight about boys' and girls' expectations of gender roles in stories. The research questions were (a) What are the children's expectations regarding main character gender and (b) Do these expectations begin to skew toward the stereotypical roles presented in literature and, if so, when? Two hundred and two children, ages 8 to 12, were asked to invent stories when given the prompt "Which heroes and heroines would you like to be?" The majority of the children invented a main char- acter of their own gender, although the choice of a hero or heroine of the opposite gender was more fre- quent among girls than boys. Dafflon found that children's portraits of invented female characters were richer and more positive than those of male characters, and boys and girls told stories with dis- tinctly different content and themes, regardless of the gender of the main character. The study con- cludes with a discussion of children's internalization of gender role representation. REFERENCES BAKER, L., &amp; WIGFIELD, A. (1999).

An intriguing and consistent finding of previous studies is that English-speaking children tend to acquire ear- ly literacy skills, such as word decoding and spelling, more slowly than do children speaking most other comparison languages with alphabetic writing sys- tems (Bruck, Genesee, &amp; Caravolas, 1997; Caravolas &amp; Bruck, 1993; Cossu, Shankweiler, Liberman, Katz, &amp; Tola, 1988; Durgunoglu &amp; Oney, 1999; Wimmer &amp; Goswami, 1994). Current theories put forth to explain why English-speaking children fare poorly in these comparisons involve the relative complexity and inconsistency, or "depth," of English orthography. Philip Seymour of the University of Dundee, Scotland, and his colleagues in 12 European coun- tries (Seymour, Aro, &amp; Erskine, 2003) conducted cross-linguistic studies of foundational levels of liter- acy, working within the EC COST Action A8 net- work. Results revealed that English-speaking children in their first two years of schooling in the United Kingdom (UK) have the poorest outcomes regarding familiar word identification and nonword reading when compared with children from other countries tested. In addition, children learning other relatively complex orthographies, such as French, Danish, and Portuguese, also tended to perform less well on foundational-level skills, although not as poorly as the English-speaking children. These find- ings are consistent with an orthographic depth hy- pothesis, which posits that children's development of early literacy skills is strongly tied to orthographic complexity. The authors estimated that the rate of foundational literacy development for English-speak- ing children is twice as slow as that of children learn- ing relatively shallow orthographies such as Finnish, Greek, and German. In a related question, researchers sought to de- termine whether orthographic complexity also influ- ences the cognitive components and processes that underlie normal literacy development on the one hand, and the profile of cognitive deficits in dyslexia on the other hand. For example, according to one hypothesis, the highly consistent letter-sound map- pings in shallow orthographies required less intricate phonological awareness and decoding skills than would more complicated orthographies. Whereas speed of word naming and reading fluency have been shown to be important indicators of reading proficiency throughout the primary years (Wimmer, 1993), a recent study by researchers at the University of York, UK, and the University of Amsterdam, Netherlands (Patel, Snowling, &amp; de Jong, in press), found that in a comparison of English (deep orthog- raphy) and Dutch (relatively shallow orthography) primary school children, phonemic awareness was a significant predictor of reading ability in both lan- guages, whereas naming speed was not. A related study conducted through the University of Liverpool, UK, and Charles University in the Czech Republic (Caravolas, Volin, &amp; Hulme, in press) found similar results for English and Czech primary school children. The Czech children, whose language is orthographically shallow, revealed more advanced literacy skills; however, differences in ability were more consistently predicted by phonological aware- ness skill rather than naming speed.

Brazil International research correspondent, Renata Junqueira de Souza Renata Junqueira de Souza writes to report on research carried out by members of the Faculty of</page><page sequence="4">International Reports on Literacy Research 517 Science and Technology of the Department of Education at Sao Paulo State University. They exam- ined the teaching of poetry in Brazil's elementary schools (Departamento de Educacao da Faculdade de Ciencias e Technologia, Universidade Estadual Paulista, 2000), interviewing 53 teachers of third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade students. Teachers in Brazil are required to use an official textbook to teach read- ing at each grade level, but they are free to choose supplementary books. The teachers interviewed used only 12 different books in their classrooms. Of the 12 books, 82% of the material was described as nar- rative and 18% included poetry. The teachers' choices of poems presented in class did not appear to be based on well-developed criteria because the teachers did not demonstrate a strong background knowledge of poetry, nor were they able to direct discussions that would lead to an investigation of critical and social perspectives. Although they explored the structure of the genre, the teachers did not focus on meaning or interpreta- tion. The frequent use of the official textbook alone was identified as a limiting factor in the meaningful exploration of poetry, because reading texts tended to restrict their focus to the structural analysis of how stanzas and verses were organized. When limit- ed to such presentations, students may come to un- derstand poetry as a kind of text with particular forms, but they may miss the power of the writing to make connections to themselves and the world, which could bring deeper meaning to the poems. The textbooks that were analyzed offered in- structional activities for exploring comprehension, grammar, and spelling as well as an occasional writing task to follow readings. These tasks included copying the poem, answering comprehension questions, com- pleting grammar and spelling activities, and writing a prose response. Teachers frequently used these meth- ods after reading poetry, and they did not engage their classes to create their own poetry. The teachers involved in this study did not in- dicate that they received a methodological prepara- tion for poetry study beyond the activities suggested in the textbook. For example, they did not attempt to improve their students' development as readers by introducing questions that would help students in- teract with the text or lead them to think critically about the social implications or the intentions of the authors. In spite of these apparent pedagogical short- comings, the participants reported that they enjoy teaching poetry. They referred to poems as "good texts" and "easy to work with" or "texts that deal with the feelings of the students." However, their presentations of the material continue to be seen as superficial and lacking in symbolic comprehension and acknowledgment of the ideologies that are avail- able for exploration. Furthermore, the teachers did not indicate value in presenting the power of poetic words that could guide children through the range of the literary sense of poetic language by which words could be always new, take on fresh meanings, and reinvent the literary structure of the world (Paes, 1990). In view of this finding, the researchers felt a need for teachers to bring to their students a concep- tion of poetry as "something made of magic words, which lead them to a specific reality-art, where everything which does not exist is possible to be said by the poet" (Trevizan, 1995, p. 37). The researchers noted that some of the teachers involved in the study received their credentials prior to the enactment of the New Law of Bases on National Education (Nova Lie de Diretrizes e Bases da Educaglio Nacional) in 1996 and were required to hold a Specific Teaching Ability license or a univer- sity diploma. At the time of the study, a teacher who held a Specific Teaching Ability credential and a uni- versity diploma in physical education, for instance, could teach any subject in an elementary school. However, the New Law of Bases requires teachers to hold a diploma in the subject area they will teach. As this new requirement is enacted, it is hoped the teaching of poetry and literature in Brazilian elemen- tary classrooms will improve.

Editors' note In volume 39(2) of Reading Research Quarterly, we presented Christine Garbe's research report from Germany on adolescent reading. We unfortunately omitted a portion of Garbe's report, leaving out a substantive reference to the work of Cornelia Rosebrock. We include it here to counter any sugges- tion that we were privileging others' work. "What remains?" is the question at the center of Rosebrock's research project concerning the remem-</page><page sequence="5">518 Readiing Research Quarterly OCTOBER/NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2005 40/4 brances of literature instruction in the media prac- tices and in the reading histories of 17- to 18-year-old students who have completed secondary modern school (Hauptschule). The project's aim is to gather data about the reading habits of this age group as well as to document the history of those reading habits. A second goal is to develop criteria that can be used to determine the functions of reading within the entire- ty of an individual's media use. The data examined in this project came from a qualitative content analysis of the quantity and quality of the participants' read- ing, plus semistructured interviews on their biograph- ical and academic background and on the place of reading within their media use as a whole. The published results (Pieper, Rosebruck, Wirthwein, &amp; Volz, 2004) suggest that the current ways literature is taught in the Hauptschule feature some alarming shortcomings in terms of preparing students for life- long literacy use. This book promises to fill an impor- tant gap in the literature pertaining to adolescent readers in Germany. For more information, contact c.rosebrock@ em.uni-frankfurt.de.
