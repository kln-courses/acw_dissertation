McRae' and Williams v. Zbaraz2 that the Constitution compels neither the federal government nor the states to finance medically necessary abortions for indigents.3 Many viewed these decisions as substantial and alarming encroachments upon a woman's free- dom to terminate her pregnancy,4 a right that the Court had first recognized in * Professor, Washington University School of Law. A.B. 1970, Vassar College; J.D. 1973, University of California, Berkeley. My colleagues, Professors Jules B. Gerard, D. Bruce La Pierre, and Ronald M. Levin, provided valuable comments on an earlier draft of this Article. 1. 448 U.S. 297 (1980). 2. 448 U.S. 358 (1980). 3. In McRae, the Court rejected constitutional and statutory challenges to the various versions of the "Hyde Amendment," concluding that it does not impinge on protected personal liberties or fundamental rights. See 448 U.S. at 312-18, 322. The Amendment severely restricts the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program, see 42 U.S.C. ?? 1396-1396k (1976 &amp; Supp. II 1978), for all abortions except those performed under expressly delineated circumstances. The first version of the Amendment, named for Representative Henry Hyde of Illinois, prohibited, during fiscal year 1977, the use of federal funds for abortions "except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term." Pub. L. No. 94-439, ? 209, 90 Stat. 1418, 1434 (1976). Subsequent versions contained additional exceptions for "instances where severe and long-lasting physical health damage to the mother would result if the pregnancy were carried to term when so determined by two physicians," Pub. L. No. 95-205, ? 101, 91 Stat. 1460 (1977); Pub. L. No. 95-480, ? 210, 92 Stat. 1567, 1586 (1978), or "for such medical procedures necessary for the victims of rape or incest, when such rape or incest has been reported promptly to a law enforcement agency or public health service," Pub. L. No. 96-123, ? 109, 93 Stat. 923, 926 (1979); Pub. L. No. 96-86, ? 118, 93 Stat. 656, 662 (1979); Pub. L. No. 95-480, ? 210, 92 Stat. 1567, 1586 (1978); Pub. L. No. 95-205, ? 101, 91 Stat. 1460 (1977). All versions withhold financial assistance from some "medically necessary" abortions. See note 22 infra. Plaintiffs had argued that title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. ?? 1396-1396k (1976 &amp; Supp. 11 1978), requires states participating in the Medicaid program to pay for all medically necessary abortions for eligible recipients, see 42 U.S.C. ?? 1396a(a)(10)(A), 1396a(a)(10)(C)(1976), notwithstanding the unavailability of federal funds for these procedures. Emphasizing the "cooperative federalism" underlying the Medicaid program, the Court con- cluded that title XIX does not require state funding for those medical services for which Congress has withdrawn federal reimbursement. 448 U.S. at 306-11. The Court found that the Hyde Amendment does not impinge on the personal liberty protected by the due process clause of the fifth amendment, id. at 318; that, despite its congru- ence with some Roman Catholic teachings, it is not an "establishment of religion" prohibited by the first amendment, id. at 319-20; and that it satisfies the equal protection command embodied in the fifth amendment's due process clause through its rational promotion of the legitimate governmental interest in protecting potential life, id. at 321-25. The Court invoked the same statutory and equal protection analyses in Zbaraz to validate under the fourteenth amendment an Illinois statute prohibiting state medical-assistance payments for all abortions except those necessary to preserve maternal life. See 448 U.S. at 368-69. 4. See, e.g., Goldstein, A Critique of the Abortion-Funding Decisions: On Private Rights in the Public Sector, 8 Hastings Const.

Wade5 as an individual liberty shielded by the due process clause6 and had begun to limit in its 1977 opinions upholding refusals to subsidize non- therapeutic abortions.7 Others were plainly delighted that the Court that creates the right to obtain an abortion8 can also confine it.9 The Court's decisions in McRae and Zbaraz clearly refine the contours of the constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy, but even more significantly, they provide a new analytical focus for all fundamental-rights cases. By articulating an "impingement" requirement'0 that attaches new importance to the character of any challenged state action, McRae and Zbaraz may portend a dilution of the Court's protection" of all individual constitutional rights. In addition, these cases mark the rejection of the constitutional "welfare-rights" thesis that Professor Frank I. Michelman'2 has discerned in the Court's "wealth discrimination" decisions.'3 McRae and Zbaraz unequivocally con- Was Plainly Wrong in the Hyde Amendment Case: A Brief Comment on Harris v.

The Roe Court considered privacy, maternal health, potential life, and state authority over these matters. Its now-familiar timetable reflects the balance it struck: during the first trimester of pregnancy private medical judgment governs; during the subsequent trimes- ters the state may regulate the abortion procedure through restrictions designed to promote maternal health; after the fetus reaches viability, the state may impose limitations that regulate or proscribe abortion if designed to promote "the potentiality of human life," except where such limitations threaten maternal life or health.

Roe'8 and the other 1977 cases suggest a new requirement in fundamental-rights analysis. State action now must constitute an "impingement" before the Court will subject it to the strict scrutiny typically afforded in fundamental-rights cases. That conclusion is reinforced by the unsuccessful lower-court efforts to limit the reach of the 1977 decisions; all of those efforts necessarily failed, as did the reasoning of the McRae dissents, because they misunderstood the impingement require- ment. With this fresh perspective, however, the apparent difficulties of McRae and Zbaraz disappear, and the majority opinions emerge as restate- ments and clarifications of a new fundamental-rights methodology. Part II of the Article examines the impact of these developments upon fundamental-right analysis in general, and Part III upon the constitutional welfare-rights thesis in particular. These inquiries reveal the importance of McRae and Zbaraz for all substantive due process and equal protection adjudication. protection compels state to provide indigents with counsel for single appeal as of right); Griffin v.

Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970) (due process requires hearing prior to termination of welfare payments). 14. "Protection" is used here as Professor Michelman uses it, to cover not simply protection from governmental action but also protection from the ravages of poverty itself. See Michelman, Welfare Rights, supra note 12, at 677; Michelman, Protecting the Poor, supra note 12. 15. Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. at 326 (in a democracy, policy choices to be resolved by legislature). Zbaraz implicitly extended to state legislative decisions McRae's deference to federal legislative decisions. Williams v. Zbaraz, 448 U.S. at 369. 16. This Article analyzes the due process and equal protection questions that McRae and Zbaraz share with earlier abortion and abortion-funding decisions of the Supreme Court, e.g., Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973); Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464 (1977). It does not consider the first amendment issues raised by those cases, i.e., the claims avoided or rejected in McRae, that the Hyde Amendment infringes the first amendment guarantee of the free exercise of religion, 448 U.S. at 320-21, and that such "pro-life" legislation violates the establishment clause by impermis- sibly reflecting the views of the Roman Catholic Church, id. at 319-20. Cf. Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. at 160-61 (Catholic view that life begins at conception); Tribe, supra note 6, at 22 (establishment clause, though not invoked in Roe, "strongly supports the basic allocation of roles mandated by Roe"). 17. Although Roe itself has provoked sharp criticism, see, e.g., Ely, The Wages of Crying Wolf: A Comment on Roe v. Wade, 82 Yale L.J. 920 (1973), and one may ask whether subsequent applications of Roe are truly supportable, see, e.g., Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379 (1979); Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52 (1976), such problems lie beyond the scope of this Article. It examines the abortion-funding question in light of these precedents, whatever their merits. 18. 432 U.S. 464 (1977).</page><page sequence="4">724 COLUMBIA LA W RE VIEW [Vol. 81:721 I. THE LIMITS OF REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE A. The 1977 Abortion-Funding Cases In 1973, the Supreme Court decided in Roe v. Wade'9 that the constitu- tional "right of privacy . . . is broad enough to encompass a woman's deci- sion whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. "20 Four years later a major- ity of the Court concluded in Maher v. Roe2' that a state may elect to fund medical services incident to pregnancy and childbirth without providing finan- cial assistance for elective or nontherapeutic22 abortions.23 Invoking what Justice Marshall has called a "relentlessly formalistic catechism"24 for testing equal protection challenges,25 the majority26 rejected the argument that the 19. 410 U.S. 113 (1973). 20. Id. at 153. 21. 432 U.S. 464 (1977). 22. Maher concerned a refusal to finance only those abortions not deemed "medically necesssary." See id. at 466. Throughout this Article the terms "elective" and "nontherapeutic" will be used interchangeably and in contrast to "therapeutic" and "medically necessary." But see note 97 and accompanying text infra. 23. In companion cases, the Court decided that title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. ?? 1396-1396k (1976 &amp; Supp. II 1978), does not require states participating in the Medicaid program to fund nontherapeutic abortions when they fund medical procedures incident to childbirth, Beal v. Doe, 432 U.S. 438 (1977), and that cities may bar nontherapeutic abortions in public hospitals, Poelker v. Doe, 432 U.S. 519 (1977) (per curiam). 24. Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. at 341 (Marshall, J., dissenting). This so-called catechism is the Court's "two-tiered" equal protection analysis, which subjects challenged classifications to one of two standards of review: strict scrutiny-dispelling the usual presumption of legislative validity and almost certainly resulting in a finding of unconstitutionality-or the rationality test-carrying a presumption of, and more likely producing, a determination of, validity. But see note 67 infra. The former applies only to classifications predicated on "suspect" criteria or interfering with "fundamental rights" and burdens the government with a requirement of demon- strating a "compelling state interest" that cannot be promoted by "less drastic means." See San Antonio Indep. School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 16-17 (1973). See generally Gunther, The Supreme Court, 1971 Term-Foreword: In Search of Evolving Doctrine on a Changing Court: A Model for Newer Equal Protection, 86 Harv. L. Rev. 1 (1972); Developments in the Law-Equal Protection, 82 Harv. L. Rev. 1065, 1087-1131 (1969). The latter standard, applicable to all other classifications, requires a successful challenger to show either the absence of a legitimate state purpose or an irrational means of promoting a legitimate goal. See City of New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. 297, 303 (1976); Bennett, "Mere" Rationality in Constitutional Law: Judicial Review and Democratic Theory, 67 Calif. L. Rev. 1049 (1979). Recently, the compelling-state-interest test has been transplanted to substantive due process challenges to infringements of protected rights and liberties. E.g., Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. at 312; Carey v. Population Servs. Int'l, 431 U.S. 678, 686 (1977); Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 154-56 (1973). See also 410 U.S. at 173 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). See generally Lupu, Untan- gling the Strands of the Fourteenth Amendment, 77 Mich. L. Rev. 981 (1979). 25. Although Maher addressed questions concerning the abortion right (a due process issue under Roe, 410 U.S. at 164), the Court employed equal protection analysis because the Connecti- cut program allegedly discriminated between indigent women seeking abortions and those choos- ing to carry their pregnancies to term. Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. at 469-70. In a companion case, Poelker v. Doe, 432 U.S. 519 (1977) (per curiam), the Court acknowledged another basis for its equal protection inquiry: "the contrast between nonindigent women who can afford to obtain abortions in private hospitals and indigent women who cannot." Id. at 520. Justice Brennan, dissenting in Maher, preferred a due process approach. 432 U.S. at 484. See Perry, The Abortion Funding Cases: A Comment on the Supreme Court's Role in American Government, 66 Geo. L.J. 1191, 1195 (1978). 26. Justice Powell's opinion was joined by Chief Justice Burger and Justices Stewart, White, Rehnquist and Stevens.</page><page sequence="5">19811 ABOR TION-FUNDING CASES 725 poor women denied free abortions by this policy were members of a constitu- tionally suspect class, entitled to strict judicial scrutiny.27 It then reasoned that the criminal prohibitions and accompanying penalties challenged in Roe had interposed absolute obstacles to the fundamental right of private deci- sion28 and therefore called for strict judicial scrutiny. In contrast, when a state has simply failed to subsidize the exercise of that right, the rationality stan- dard controls.29 Under Maher, then, the Constitutioii does not require the state to furnish any medical care for the poor.30 Maher and its companion cases,3' however, did not present challenges to the simple refusal to subsidize abortions. The statutes and regulations in question provided free medical assistance incident to childbirth.32 Several critics have observed that the union of this state action and inaction, favoring childbirth and disfavoring abortion, infringed a woman's private choice in a way that pure governmental passivity never could.33 The public funding of one alternative resolution of pregnancy-child- birth-but not the other-abortion-was the crux of the problem in Maher. Individual choice in reproductive decisions is arguably the heart of the privacy right recognized in Roe and related cases,34 and governmental facilitation of one of two mutually exclusive alternatives presumably will tend to influence such choices.35 The pregnant woman cannot decide to choose neither path or to postpone decision indefinitely;36 every pregnancy must culminate in one of these two resolutions. For the pregnant woman, no neutral stance regarding the governmentally favored and disfavored options is possible. Indeed, an indigent pregnant woman who delays decision ultimately makes a reproduc- tive choice by default-childbirth.37 27. 432 U.S. at 470-71. See note 24 supra. 28. Id. at 471-74. 29.

Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 410 (1975) (no due process violation where individual is merely delayed in, but not deprived of, exercise of constitutional right). Every hour that she is unable to obtain an abortion brings her closer to the officially favored alternative, childbirth. 37. See Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U.S. 622, 643 (1979) (plurality opinion) (abortion decision, if postponed, "will be made by default"); Roe v. Norton, 522 F.2d 928, 941 (2d Cir.) (Mulligan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("the pregnancy of the mother, absent miscarriage,</page><page sequence="6">726 COLUMBIA LAWREVIEW [Vol. 81:721 The uniqueness of pregnancy, however, did not alter the Maher Court's view of the applicable analysis,38 and it found that choice-influencing, or even choice-determining,39 state action combined with inaction warrants the same restrained review as complete governmental passivity.40 The Court repeatedly distinguished this action-plus-inaction-variously described as a "value judg- ment,''41 "state encouragement,' '42 or "policy choice' 43 favoring one out- come of pregnancy (childbirth) over its alternative (abortion)-from the sort of "penalty,"44 "direct burden,"45 "absolute obstacle,"46 or "unduly bur- densome interference with [the] freedom to decide whether to terminate [a] pregnancy"47 it had struck down in previous cases. Only the latter kind of inevitably and biologically terminates in the birth of the child"), on remand, 408 F. Supp. 660 (D. Conn. 1975), rev'd sub nom. Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464 (1977). 38. Only one of the analogies invoked by the Maher Court to support its reasoning shares any of the special features of the pregnancy situation: compulsory education laws that require parents to select public schooling or nonsubsidized private education for their school-age chil- dren. 432 U.S. at 476-77. But in the schooling context, rich and poor alike are subject to extensive state control that diminishes the differences between the public and private options. See L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 933 n.77 (1978). Cf. Farrington v. Tokushige, 273 U.S. 284 (1924) (Constitution prohibits only unreasonable governmental regulation of private schools). More- over, governmental sponsorship itself makes schooling public and its absence makes schooling private-but both systems (at least try to) provide education. See Survey, supra note 33, at 175. A more accurate analogy to the Court's private vs. public school example, therefore, would have been privately vs. publicly funded abortion (or childbirth). Even this analogy is an imperfect one, however. Those able to afford private medical attention must pay for it, see 42 U.S.C. ?? 1396a(a)(10)(A), 1396a(a)(10)(C) (1976); children from all socioeconomic groups may attend public school. But see Poelker v. Doe, 432 U.S. at 524 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (in small communities, closing public hospitals to abortion may affect rich as well as poor). Selective funding in the pregnancy context thus differs significantly from other governmental programs that may appear at first glance analogous. Although that fact does not necessarily compel a different doctrinal result for pregnancy and other situations (if any) in which people must make choices, it substantially undermines the Court's efforts to anchor the Maher result to analogies instead of to explanations. See note 56 infra. 39. The majority in Maher conceded that for some poor women abortions would be impos- sible without financial assistance. 432 U.S. at 474. 40. The majority had cautioned at the beginning of its equal protection analysis that "when a State decides to alleviate some of the hardships of poverty. . ., the manner in which it dispenses benefits is subject to constitutional limitations." Id. at 469-70. Nevertheless, it ignored its own warning, emphasizing the absence of a constitutional guarantee of medical care for indigents. See id. at 471-74 (explaining why challenged program did not obstruct right recognized in Roe). The dissenting Justices disagreed with the result, but they, too, approached the issue largely as a simple failure to subsidize abortions. See id. at 484-90 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (finding in funding denial infringement of right recognized in Roe); Beal v. Doe, 432 U.S. at 454-55 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (governmental actions impose moral viewpoint that Roe held constitu- tionally impermissible); id. at 462 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (majority allows indirect subversion of Roe by denying realization and enjoyment of abortion right). All of these analyses would apply with equal force to complete governmental passivity, e.g., refusal to provide medical assistance for both abortion and childbirth.

For example, both Missouri's ban on abortions performed by saline amniocentesis, invalidated in Planned Parenthood v. Danforth,5' and New York's regulation of the distri- bution of contraceptives, overturned in Carey v. Population Services Interna- tional,52 fell short of posing "absolute obstacles" to unimpeded procreative choice.53 Those measures restricted access to abortions or contraceptives without barring resort to them altogether.54 But the Court differentiated the restrictions on access imposed by criminal or financial penalties55 from the restrictions on access resulting from denials of public funding. And, in fact, the two types of restrictions on access are not identical. In those earlier cases, the Court never addressed whether the states must distrib- ute abortions or contraceptive devices at their own expense, and Maher 48. See id. at 474-78. 49.

The Court struck down the restriction, in part, because an alternative method of abortion after the first twelve weeks (prostaglandin instillation) was not readily available. 52. 431 U.S. 678, 686-91 (1977). A majority of the Court invalidated the "restriction on access," id. at 686, created by New York's prohibition against the distribution of nonmedical contraceptives except through licensed pharmacists. Justice Brennan's opinion for the Court stressed that "the same test must be applied to state regulations that burden an individual's right to decide to prevent conception or terminate pregnancy by substantially limiting access to the means of effectuating that decision as is applied to state statutes that prohibit the decision entirely." Id. at 688. In other words, for purposes of constitutional analysis, the two kinds of state action may be deemed equivalent. 53. Whatever the merits of Planned Parenthood and Carey, they are assumed here to be among the "givens" against which Maher may be examined. See note 17 and accompanying text supra. 54. Indeed, Justice Brennan recalled the reasoning of Planned Parenthood and Carey in his dissent in Maher. 432 U.S. at 485-87. 55.

Once the Court distinguished the refusal to subsidize private reproductive choice from the infliction of a criminal or financial penalty on that fundamen- tal right,56 it determined that such inaction must meet only the more permis- sive rationality standard.57 The Court concluded in Maher that Connecticut's refusal to subsidize nontherapeutic abortions met that test by rationally fur- thering legitimate state interests, particularly the "interest in protecting the potential life of the fetus,"58 sometimes characterized as the state's "interest in encouraging normal childbirth,"59 which, though under Roe less than compelling before fetal viability,60 remains "strong and legitimate" through- out pregnancy.6' 56. 432 U.S. at 474 n.8. See Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 386 n.7 (1979) (criminal penalties are direct obstacles); Frug, The Judicial Power of the Purse, 126 U. Pa. L. Rev. 715, 780 (1978) (denials of all welfare funds to those exercising a constitutional right-as distinguished from merely refusing to pay for the exercise of the right-impermissibly "penalize" the right). The Maher Court invoked numerous examples to make its point. Compare 432 U.S. at 474 n.8 (withdrawal of all welfare benefits from those exercising the right to travel); id. at 475 n.9 (state laws compelling an electoral candidate to meet certain requirements to have his name appear on the ballot); and id. at 476 (criminal prohibitions on the teaching of foreign languages and criminal laws precluding parental selection of private school) with id. at 474 n.8 (refusal to pay bus fares of indigents desiring to travel); id. at 475 n.9 (refusal to provide public funds for some electoral candidates); and id. at 477 (state prescription of limited curriculum in public schools and state funding of public but not private schools). The illustrations provide imperfect support in the abortion-funding context, however, because of the unique nature of pregnancy. See text accompanying notes 34-38 supra. 57. See text accompanying notes 29 and 48 supra. 58. 432 U.S. at 478. 59. Id. (quoting Beal v. Doe, 432 U.S. at 446). The Court used the two descriptions of the state interest interchangeably ("protecting the potential life of the fetus" and "encouraging normal childbirth"). 60. 410 U.S. at 163-65. 61. 432 U.S. at 478. See also Beal v. Doe, 432 U.S. at 445-46 (similar funding scheme "reasonable" under Social Security Act). The Court itself proposed these state interests. Neither Pennsylvania (Beal) nor Connecticut (Maher) had asserted these interests, presumably because Roe seemed to foreclose them by holding them less than compelling before fetal viability. A state, however, need not show a compelling interest unless the Court applies strict scrutiny. The Court identified several other possible interests rationally furthered by the legislation challenged in Maher. A state might seek to address its "legitimate demographic concerns," 432 U.S. at 478 n. 1; see generally Appleton, The Abortion-Funding Cases and Population Control: An Imaginary Lawsuit (and Some Reflections on the Uncertain Limits of Reproductive Privacy), 77 Mich. L. Rev. 1688 (1979) [hereinafter cited as Appleton, Abortion-Funding Cases]. In addition, all funding decisions-whether or not they implicate constitutional rights-appropri- ately reside in the people and their electorally responsible representatives, see Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. at 479-80; Poelker v. Doe, 432 U.S. at 521, and a state might choose to use the distribution of welfare benefits as a forum for expressing its value judgments and policy preferences on politically charged issues such as abortion, Poelker v.

See also Butler, The Right to Medicaid Payment for Abortion, 28 Hastings L.J. 931 (1977) (pre-Maher analysis). 64. Maher's deference to the political process, see note 61 supra, seemed to flout Roe's rejection of the abortion restrictions enacted by the democratically elected legislatures of almost every state. See J. Choper, Judicial Review and the National Political Process: A Functional Reconsideration of the Role of the Supreme Court 118-19 (1980). 65. But see Maher v.

See also Ely, The Supreme Court, 1977 Term-Foreword: On Discovering Fundamental Values, 92 Harv. L. Rev. 5, 12 (1978). But see 432 U.S. at 471 ("'every denial of welfare to an indigent creates a wealth classification as compared to nonindigents who are able to pay for the desired goods or serv- ices"). Despite the Court's disclaimers, the facts of Maher seemed to fit perfectly the paradigm for presumptively unconstitutional wealth discrimination, i.e., wealth discrimination requiring strict scrutiny, spelled out in earlier opinions: complete (as distinguished from relative) depriva- tion of a right already classified as fundamental. See San Antonio Indep. School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 17-26, 29-39 (1973). 67. See Perry, supra note 25, at 1192. In the past, the Court has invalidated state action that fulfills its purpose only in a limited class of cases. For example, in Rinaldi v. Yeager, 384 U.S. 305 (1966), the Court found violative of equal protection a New Jersey statute requiring indigent, unsuccessful criminal appellants confined to prison to reimburse the state for the cost of necessary transcripts without imposing that financial burden on other indigent, unsuccessful criminal appellants. The Court conceded the legitimacy of the state's asserted fiscal objective but found invidious-and thus irrational-the singling out of appellants on the basis of a trait (confine- ment) totally unrelated to the fiscal objective. Id. at 308-10. The only other purpose the Court could discern, the deterrence of frivolous appeals, failed for the same reasons to support the distinctions contained in the statute. See Bennett, supra note 24, at 1087 (Court meant in Rinaldi that statute achieved its objective only to a minor degree). Cf. Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 390 (1978) (statute conditioning right to marry on satisfaction of prior support obligations is, inter alia, "grossly underinclusive"). The same analysis can be applied to the situation presented in Maher. The state's interest in protecting potential life or encouraging normal childbirth, however legitimate, does not necessar- ily support a law that singles out the poor for that goal's promotion. The essential-and</page><page sequence="10">730 COLUMBIA LAW RE VIEW [Vol. 81:721 Understandably, the Maher Court's characterization of the "nature and scope of the fundamental right recognized in Roe"68 engendered perhaps the greatest analytic confusion.69 Roe had found fundamental70 "a woman's decision whether or not to terminate a pregnancy,'"7' and the Maher Court placed particular stress on the word "decision"72 -implying that poor women are free to decide to obtain abortions even if they cannot effectuate their decisions.73 This new emphasis convinced some observers that the Court had preserved the skeleton of Roe while carving away its flesh.74 Much of this criticism is misdirected. A closer study of Maher reveals that the opinion did not necessarily recharacterize the Roe abortion right in this way. An equally plausible reading-and, ultimately, the only sensible one in light of Roe-reveals that the focus of the Court's analysis is not the right at stake but the nature of the official action (or inaction)75 claimed to subvert that right. When the Maher majority "conclude[d] that the Connecticut [funding] regulation does not impinge upon the fundamental right recognized in Roe," 1 76 it may have addressed only the nonoccurrence of an "impingement"-whatever that may be-without compelling any revision of Roe or the fundamental character of the right recognized in that case. The importance of Maher, then, would lie not in its elaboration of protected privacy but rather in its efforts to define "impinge."77 From this ultimately critical-difference between the cases is, of course, that in Rinaldi the statute ex- pressly, actively, and intentionally classified, while the poor in Maher were "singled out" only by the law's effect. See notes 106-12 and accompanying text infra. The imperfection of the means- end fit reflected by the law upheld in Maher seemed accentuated by the Court's observation, 432 U.S. at 474, that even the indigent could circumvent the goals justifying the policy-so long as they could find the money to do so.

Reaching a fuller understanding of the meaning, the mechanics, and the consequences of this distinction requires careful anal- ysis of the Supreme Court's own refinements in McRae and Zbaraz as well as the lower courts' efforts to interpret Maher. B. "We are thus not persuaded that the Hyde Amendment impinges on the constitutionally protected freedom of choice recognized in [Roe]. McRae and Zbaraz arguably invited the Supreme Court onto new consti- tutional terrain. Although Maher and its companion cases had concerned funding denials only for elective, nontherapeutic abortions,80 McRae and Zbaraz addressed attempts by Congress81 and the states82 to withhold funding from "medically necessary"83 abortions-except when pregnancy endangers maternal life and, sometimes, when it results from rape or incest.84 Some commentators believed that this difference would be determinative; they con- 78. See notes 41-48 and accompanying text supra. 79. Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. at 317. See also id. at 318 ("We conclude that the Hyde Amendment does not impinge on the due process liberty recognized in [Roe]."). 80. See Beal v. Doe, 432 U.S. at 444-45 ("Although serious statutory questions might be presented if a state Medicaid plan excluded necessary medical treatment from its coverage, it is hardly inconsistent with the objectives of the [Social Security] Act for a State to refuse to fund unnecessary-though perhaps desirable-medical services."). Maher then upheld the constitu- tionality of such state action. Only Doe v. Poelker cast doubt on the narrow scope of the 1977 holdings. The Court validated a hospital regulation that "prohibited the performance of abortions in the city hospitals except when there was a threat of grave physiological injury or death to the mother." 432 U.S. at 520. Some medically necessary abortions, e.g., those sought to prevent psychological injury or physical injuries falling short of "grave," were implicitly encompassed in the prohibition. None- theless, the Court characterized the constitutional issue as "identical in principle" to that pre- sented in Maher. A few lower courts relied on Poelker to infer that the funding restrictions on "medically necessary" abortions attacked in McRae and Zbaraz were constitutionally valid. See, e.g., Freiman v. Walsh, 481 F. Supp. 137, 145-46 (W.D. Mo. 1979), rev'd sub nom. Reproductive Health Servs. v. Freeman, 614 F.2d 585 (8th Cir.), vacated and remanded mem., 449 U.S. 809 (1980); Woe v. Califano, 460 F.

This penalty,86 so the argument might continue, constitutes a direct interference with personal privacy amounting to a punishment-or impingement-and hence requires strict judicial scrutiny.87 The McRae majority never explicitly addressed the question whether the impairment of health resulting from the Hyde Amendment impermissibly 85. See, e.g., N.Y.U. Note, supra note 84, at 139-40. See also Reproductive Health Servs. v.

Wis. 1979) (maternal health conse- quences require application of strict scrutiny here, as distinguished from Maher), remanded mem., 631 F.2d 734 (7th Cir. 1980). 86. Viewed from a slightly different perspective, the decision to fund all necessary medical services except medically necessary abortions "penalizes" the indigent pregnant woman who exercises her consitutional right to choose abortion because it deprives her of the subsidized medical care to which she would have been entitled had she chosen to bear the child. See Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. at 336 (Brennan, J., dissenting); id. at 345-46 (Marshall, J., dissenting); Brief for Appellees at 46-50, Williams v. Zbaraz, 448 U.S. 358 (1980); Goldstein, supra note 4, at 30-31; 8 Pepperdine L. Rev. 861, 880 (1981); 12 Tex. Tech. L. Rev. 483, 496 (1981). The logic of this version of the penalty argument is troublesome, however, at least with regard to the indigent women who decide to accept the government's financial incentives and carry to term. The women who ultimately elect childbirth, albeit as the result of official influence, do not in the end choose abortion and they do receive subsidized medical care. How, then, are they penalized? Cf. Steward Mach. Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 589-90 (1937) ("to hold that [providing financial] motive or temptation is equivalent to coercion [of states] . . . is the accept- ance of a philosophical determinism by which choice becomes impossible"). But see note 117 infra. For the class of women who ultimately choose childbirth, then, the "health penalty" analysis presented in the text makes better sense. 87. See note 24 supra. The "health penalty" argument figured prominently in Justice Stevens's dissent in McRae, a particularly significant opinion given his alignment with the majority in Maher. Justice Stevens wrote: Because a denial of benefits for medically necessary abortions inevitably causes serious harm to the excluded women, it is tantamount to severe punishment. In my judgment, that denial cannot be justified unless government may, in effect, punish women who want abortions. But as the Court unequivocally held in Roe v. Wade, this the govern- ment may not do. 448 U.S. at 354. He appended in a footnote: "in this respect, this case is entirely different from Maher, in which the Court repeatedly noted that the refusal to subsidize nontherapeutic abortions would merely result in normal childbirth. Surely the Government may properly presume that no harm will ensue from normal childbirth." Id. at 354 n.7. But see Regan, Rewriting Roe v. Wade, 77 Mich. L. Rev. 1569, 1579-82 (1979). See also 448 U.S. at 343 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (Hyde Amendment presents indigent woman needing therapeutic abortion with "two grotesque choices"-illegal abortion posing "a serious threat to her health and even her life" or childbirth "significantly threaten[ing] her health" and eliminating her opportunities for self-determination). Cf. Carey v. Population Servs. Int'l, 431 U.S. 678, 694 (1977) (plurality opinion) (unreasonable to assume state has prescribed pregnancy and birth as punishment for minors' fornication); id. at 715-16 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (increasing risk of unwanted pregnancy and venereal disease is unacceptable way for state to disapprove minors' fornication and violates due process).</page><page sequence="13">19811 ABORTION-FUNDING CASES 733 penalizes.88 Instead, to support its finding of "no impingement,"89 the Court tried to explain its concept of penalty-as it had in Maher90-by illustration, recalling here Sherbert v. Verner,9' where it had found a constitutional viola- tion in the denial of "all unemployment compensation benefits [to] a claimant who would otherwise be eligible for such benefits but for the fact that she is unwilling to work . . . on her Sabbath."92 This reasoning suggests that if state action deprives an individual of something that otherwise belongs to him, he has been penalized. Criminal penalties, the most familiar examples,93 often exact a fine or a price in personal freedom. All of these deprivations, according to the Court, are analytically distinguishable from "mere" refusals to subsidize protected ac- tivity.94 One could, of course, lengthen the list of examples, but providing illus- trations of what is or is not a penalty in other contexts does not answer the challenge that the detriments resulting from the Hyde Amendment are penal- ties-on the theory that they deprive an indigent woman of something that otherwise belonged to her, sound health.95 Of course, if that is the test, the legislation upheld in Maher also imposed a "penalty." Although the women unable to procure abortions in Maher may not have paid a price in health, they suffered other judicially recognized detriments. Indeed, the Court in Roe had offered a comprehensive catalogue of impairments attributable to the 88. The Court came closest to addressing the issue in a footnote, where it reasoned that the Hyde Amendment does not "penalize" because, under Maher, refusals to subsidize do not "penalize." 448 U.S. at 317 n.19. It then provided the example discussed in text accompanying notes 91-92 infra. 89. See note 79 and accompanying text supra. 90. See note 56 and accompanying text supra. 91. 374 U.S. 398 (1963). 92. 448 U.S. at 317 n.19. In the words of the Sherbert Court: "[T]o condition the availability of [governmental] benefits upon [one's] willingness to violate a cardinal principle of her religious faith effectively penalizes the free exercise of her constitutional liberties." 374 U.S. at 406 (emphasis added). Maher had distinguished Sherbert as "inapplicable" on the basis of the first amendment's requirement of governmental neutrality toward religion. 432 U.S. at 475 n.8. 93. Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. at 474 n.8; see Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. at 386 n.7. 94. 448 U.S. at 315-18 &amp; n.19. See notes 183-217 and accompanying text infra. These "mere" refusals also differ from deprivations of unrelated benefits because of abortion activity. On the same day it announced McRae and Zbaraz, the Court summarily affirmed Planned Parenthood v. Minnesota, 612 F.2d 359 (8th Cir.), aff'd, 448 U.S. 901 (1980), finding unconstitu- tional a statutory provision that denied all prepregnancy family planning grants to certain nonprofit agencies performing abortions but not to hospitals or health maintenance organizations offering such treatment. Although the decision rested on a determination that the classification was irrational, a penalty analysis works equally well: the disadvantaged agencies were not simply denied subsidies for the abortions they perform, but instead for all prepregnancy family-planning services.

How, then, could the Court conclude that the state's refusal to subsidize abortions for indigent women does not inflict a penalty or impinge upon the constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy recognized in Roe? McRae's language of "entitlement" 98 (language that did not appear in Maher) suggests that it was applying implicitly a "positive"/"negative" rights analysis.99 96. E.g., 410 U.S. at 153 ("a distressful life and future," "distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child," "the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically and otherwise, to care for it," and "the additional difficulties and continuing stigma of unwed motherhood"). 97. See Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. at 215 (Douglas, J., concurring) (Georgia statute constitu- tionally infirm because it "limits the number of reasons for which an abortion may be sought," unduly restricting "a decision sheltered by the Constitutional right to privacy") (quoting Doe v. Bolton, 319 F. Supp. 1048, 1056 (N.D. Ga. 1970)). The Court itself has indicated that the line between health and "life-style" concerns often blurs. Cf. Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. at 192: "[A physician's] medical judgment [whether or not to perform an abortion] may be exercised in the light of all factors-physical, emotional, psycholog- ical, familial, and the woman's age-relevant to the wellbeing of the patient. All these factors may relate to health." Of course, it is difficult to distinguish the truly aberrational pregnancy-related health detri- ments from the ordinary course of pregnancy and childbirth-a "normal" process that in today's society is typically accompanied by medical assistance and attention. See Appleton, The Abor- tion-Funding Cases, supra note 61, at 1699-1700 &amp; nn. 1-2, 1709; Butler, supra note 63, at 955-59 (concluding that, therefore, all abortions are "medically necessary"). See also Regan, supra note 87, at 1579-82. But see Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. at 349 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (unlike challengers in Maher, challengers in McRae meet "neutral [statutory] criterion of medical need"). Accord, Note, The Supreme Court, 1979 Term, 94 Harv. L. Rev. 75, 100-01 (1980). Cf. note 22 supra (contrasting "medically necessary" and "elective" abortions). 98. The Court stated that Maher had presented the issue whether the freedom recognized in Roe "included an entitlement" to funds for elective abortions, 448 U.S. at 313; that it does not follow from Roe "that a woman's freedom of choice carries with it a constitutional entitlement to the financial resources to avail herself of the full range of protected choices," id. at 316; that the liberty accorded substantive due process protection in Roe "does not confer an entitlement to such funds as may be necessary to realize all the advantages of that freedom," id. at 318; that whether constitutionally protected freedom of choice "warrants federal subsidization is a ques- tion for Congress to answer, not a matter of constitutional entitlement," id; and that a physi- cian's "entitlement [to funding] . . . is no broader than that of his patient," id. at 318 n.21. 99.

I prefer the negative/positive right distinction to the Court's language of entitlement, see note 98 supra, because the latter is ambiguous. We often say, for example, that the fifth amendment entitles us to freedom from compulsory self-incrimination. But that statement de- scribes a negative right, see text at note 100 infra, despite the use of the word "entitles." Cf., e.g., Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78, 85 (1970) ("Nothing in the Fifth Amendment privilege entitles a defendant as a matter of constitutional right to await the end of the State's case before announc- ing the nature of his defense, any more than it entitles him to await the jury's verdict on the State's case-in-chief before deciding whether or not to take the stand himself.")

L.J. 145, 153 (1977-78) (writing of "entitle- ments which translate into claims not to be assaulted, enslaved, trespassed upon, robbed, de- frauded"). Moreover, a right-entitlement dichotomy smacks too much of the outmoded right-privilege contrast. See, e.g., Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 360-61 (1976) (plurality opinion) (although valuable governmental benefit may be characterized only as a "privilege" and not as a "right," denial of benefit "may not be used by the government for the purpose of creating an incentive enabling it to achieve what it may not command directly"). Though some commentators have perceived in Maher a "resurrection of the right-privilege distinction," Rubin, supra note 62; see Goldstein, supra note 4, at 320-21, I think that the abortion-funding context is distinguishable. The abortion-funding cases held that the state or federal government need not pay for the abortion of one too poor to pay for it herself-i.e., need not subsidize the exercise of an indigent's constitutional right. By contrast, the cases that repudiated the right-privilege dichot- omy did not concern direct subsidization of the constitutional rights in question; rather they invalidated conditioning a government benefit on the sacrifice of one's constitutional rights. See, e.g., Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963) (first amendment protects Seventh Day Adventist's observance of Sabbath so that privilege of receiving unemployment compensation cannot be conditioned on sacrifice of that religious practice; case did not concern right to a subsidized Sabbath observance); Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589 (1967) (first amendment protects Communist Party membership so that privilege of teaching cannot be conditioned on nonmembership; case did not concern right to subsidized Communist Party membership, e.g., government payment of membership dues). The Court itself underscored this difference when it attempted in Maher and McRae to contrast the failure to subsidize abortions with Sherbert, Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618 (1969), and Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County, 415 U.S. 250 (1974). See Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. at 474 n.8; Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. at 317 n.19. Two special features of the abortion-funding cases contribute to the occasional inability to make the distinction. First, although welfare reimbursements for abortion provide the focus of the abortion-fund- ing controversy, welfare payments are, theoretically, fungible. An indigent woman who cannot obtain a government-subsidized abortion may use other welfare benefits to procure an abortion. See 448 U.S. at 346 n.7 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (poor will have to divert food and clothing money to get lawful abortions). That situation begins to resemble the deprivation of "unrelated benefits" struck down in Shapiro and Memorial Hospital, where the challengers were equally capable-or incapable, depending upon the degree of poverty and the costs in question-of diverting the money saved through the benefits in question (subsistence and medical care, respec- tively) to the exercise of the asserted constitutional right (travel). Cf. Planned Parenthood v. Minnesota, 612 F.2d 359, 361 (8th Cir.) (state, seeking to defend its withholding of all prepreg- nancy family planning funds from agencies performing abortions, argues that those funds would "free-up" agencies' own monies for abortion services), aff'd mem., 448 U.S. 901 (1980). Second, absent illegal abortion, an indigent pregnant woman denied abortion assistance must carry to term, see text accompanying notes 34-37 supra, whether or not medical assistance for childbirth is available to her. No active sacrifice of her right to terminate a pregnancy in exchange for a governmental benefit is necessary for this result to follow. But cf. Perry, supra note 25, at 1196, 1199 (state encouragement must be recognizable as something other than discouragement of constitutionally protected activity). 100. See C. Fried, supra note 99, at 110-14, 132-34. 101. See id. at 108-31. See also Bounds v.

Positive-rights analysis, even if not so denominated, inevitably creeps into a discussion of whether the poor have been unconstitutionally denied access to a particular good or service through official failure to eliminate, or assist in meeting, a payment require- ment that they are unable to meet themselves.'02 Theoretically, every constitutionally cognizable interest could be pro- tected by negative and positive rights. To borrow an example offered in Maher, the interest in interstate travel could be accorded protection as a negative right-the right to travel free from governmental inhibition-or as a positive right-the right to affirmative state assistance for those unable to travel by their own means.103 The Court thus far has recognized only the former.'04 The abortion right readily lends itself to the same parsing: Roe National League of Cities: The New Federalism and Affirmative Rights to Essential Government Services, 90 Harv. L. Rev. 1065 (1977) (using term "affirmative rights"). 102. See C. Fried, supra note 99, at 114-30; Michelman, Welfare Rights, supra note 12. See also J. Ely, Democracy and Distrust 162 (1980). 103. 432 U.S. at 474 n.8. Still, the Maher Court's use of the example, particularly in light of its reliance on phrases such as "direct burdens," id. at 475 n.9, remains confusing. In the cases cited by the Court, Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618 (1969), and Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County, 415 U.S. 250 (1974), durational residency requirements for the receipt of welfare benefits were struck down as unconstitutional "penalties" on the right to travel. See 432 U.S. at 474 n.8. But that interference with the negative right to travel was hardly a "direct burden"; the indigent remained free to travel, albeit at some sacrifice. The situation in both cases differs significantly from, say, a state's erection of a roadblock at its border. 104. See 432 U.S. at 474 n.8. With respect to other rights, particularly those relating to court access, the Court has held that the Constitution guarantees the positive as well as the negative right. The criminal-appeal cases are notable examples. Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353 (1963) (state must furnish counsel to indigents for single appeal as of right); Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12 (1956) (state must furnish necessary transcripts to indigents for appeal). Likewise, Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371 (1971) (state must waive divorce fees for indigents), concerned access to judicial procedures. The Maher majority distinguished all three cases from the abortion-fund- ing situation on the basis of governmental "monopolization." 432 U.S. at 469 n.5; id. at 471 n.6. One cannot obtain a divorce or appeal a criminal conviction through any alternative route, the Court explained. The government does not, however, monopolize the abortion process. Id. at 470 n.8. Another case that fits comfortably within this analysis is Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817 (1977), decided only a few months before Maher. The Court held in Bounds that the fourteenth amendment's guarantee of meaningful access to the courts requires prison officials "to shoulder affirmative obligations," id. at 824, and to "assist inmates in the preparation and filing of meaningful legal papers by providing prisoners with adequate law libraries or adequate assistance from persons trained in the law," id. at 828. The right thus has a clearly recognized positive dimension, but Bounds is consistent with Douglas, Griffin, and Boddie to the extent that, through imprisonment, the government has "monopolized" the inmate's whole world. Cf. Note, Inmate Abortions-The Right to Government Funding Behind the Prison Gates, 48 Fordham L. Rev. 550, 558 (1980) (despite Maher, prisoner has right to governmentally funded abortion because "the indigent inmate, unlike her free counterpart, is completely dependent on the state for all medical treatment"). It is intriguing that Chief Justice Burger, a supporter of the majority opinions in Maher and McRae, dissented in Bounds on the narrow ground that statutory rights, as distinguished from constitutional rights, are "merely negative." 430 U.S. at 834; see id. at 835. He clearly implied that, if he had perceived the right at stake (collateral attacks on state convictions) to be rooted in the Constitution, he readily would have joined the Bounds majority in recognizing a positive right. That reasoning, followed to its logical conclusion, should have aligned him with the dissenting Justices in Maher and McRae, where the right at stake was concededly constitutional.</page><page sequence="17">1981] ABORTION-FUNDING CASES 737 recognized the negative right to obtain abortions without government interfer- ence; Maher, McRae, and Zbaraz rejected the positive right to obtain them at the government's expense. Once McRae is poured into the negative right/positive right mold, the "health-penalty" problem evaporates.105 Even if refusals to fund therapeutic abortions result in impairments or detriments, those impairments are not inflicted by the government. For example, if a woman's diabetes, aggravated by continued pregnancy, results in blindness,'06 that is not equivalent to the government's putting her eyes out. Indigency, the Court explained, is not created by the government,107 and neither is a woman's pregnancy nor the special risks and problems that it poses. In short, when the government does not act-when it maintains its "hands-off" stance-it cannot "impinge"108 on a fundamental right. In fact, "the purely quiescent state"'09 cannot im- pinge at all. Under this analysis, then, the form of the governmental program, rather than its effect, becomes determinative."10 Constitutional challenges to inequi- ties caused "de jure" will more likely succeed than those to inequities emerg- ing "de facto";"'I moreover, a state will be saddled with remedial responsibili- ties only to the extent that it has participated actively in a constitutional violation. 112 105. See notes 85-95 and accompanying text supra. 106. See Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. at 353 n.5 (Stevens, J., dissenting). 107. See Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. at 471, 474; Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. at 314-16 (both distinguishing government's failure to remove the obstacles of indigency from government's imposition of obstacles). This "obstacle" analysis offers an alternative rationale for the "govern- mental monopolization" cases, see note 104 supra, and Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817 (1977). When the state controls the only avenue of access to constitutionally protected activity-or when, through imprisonment, it controls an individual's entire environment-it has imposed "obsta- cles" that may give it remedial responsibilities, affirmative duties to facilitate the exercise of essentially negative rights. Indeed, the imposition of the "obstacle" is an interference with the negative right. Cf. Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374 (1978) (statute conditioning permission to marry on satisfaction of prior support obligations violates equal protection). 108. See note 79 and accompanying text supra. 109. The description is Professor Michelman's. Michelman, Welfare Rights, supra note 12, at 685 n.128 ("purely quiescent state" can violate equal protection clause "only with an obvious strain on usage"). See Michelman, Protecting the Poor, supra note 12, at 17 (deprivations contemplated by due process clause "cannot occur by mere default"). 110. But see Reproductive Health Servs. v. Freeman, 614 F.2d 585, 595 (8th Cir.) (the ultimate test of "impingement" on constitutionally protected interests is not the form of state interference, but its effect), vacated and remanded mem., 449 U.S. 809 (1980); Van Alstyne, Cracks in "The New Property": Adjudicative Due Process in the Administrative State, 62 Cornell L. Rev. 445, 446 (1977) ("It is now clear that the manner in which government trammels an otherwise sheltered constitutional right is wholly inconclusive of whether the affected party may nevertheless be able to state a claim."). Freeman's holding and reasoning have, of course, been repudiated by McRae and Zbaraz. See also note 220 and accompanying text infra. 111. For definitions of these terms, as they have developed in the school-desegregation context, see J. Nowak, R. Rotunda &amp; J. Young, Handbook on Constitutional Law 567-72 (1978). 112. Cf.

The careful development of these concepts in the law of racial discrimination may be usefully transplanted to this inquiry. See J. Ely, supra note 102, at 162 ("wealth discrimination" usually arises de facto from failures to alleviate poverty, failures supported by nondiscriminatory fiscal objectives); Michelman, Protecting the Poor, supra note 12, at 10. And yet, the analogy is imperfect, because in the race context, the Court has identified the intent to discriminate as the decisive criterion for unconstitutionality. See, e.g., City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 66-67 (1980) (plurality opinion); Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265 (1977); Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239-48 (1976). By contrast, in all of the abortion-funding cases, an official intent to discriminate against abortion-that is, to make childbirth the more attractive or feasible alternative-is cited by the Court as a demonstration of rationality, and hence, constitutionality. See Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. at 474, 478-80; Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. at 314-15, 325. See also id. at 325 (abortion "inherently different from other medical procedures"). 113. Id. at 315-17; see notes 31-48 and accompanying text supra. 114. See 448 U.S. at 315-17 (majority opinion); id. at 334 (Brennan, J., dissenting) ("It matters not that in this instance the government has used the carrot rather than the stick."). 115. It is the unequal treatment of abortion and childbirth that raises equal protection issues in these cases. Justice Brennan clearly appreciated this point in his opinion in Beal v. Doe, 432 U.S. 438, at 449-50 (1977) (Brennan, J., dissenting). Indeed, the McRae dissenters were prompted to reassess earlier views that failure to fund abortion without more violates due process and to conclude instead that it is the unequal funding that violates the Constitution. Compare 432 U.S. at 455, 461-62 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (regulations have practical effect of preventing poor from aborting, in violation of Roe); id. at 462 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (Court undercuts Roe by distinguishing existence and realization of right); id. at 484-88 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (in addition to equal protection problem, failure to subsidize abortion impinges on privacy protected by due process clause) with 448 U.S. at 330 &amp; n.4 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (concluding "not that the State is under an affirmative obligation to ensure access to abortions for all who may desire them [but] that the State must refrain from wielding its enormous power and influence" by funding one of two alternatives); id. at 345, 348 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (unlike regulation upheld in Maher, classification imposed by Hyde Amendment singles out for exclusion one category of medically necessary expenditure); id. at 348 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (joining dissents of Brennan and Stevens). Justice Stevens, a member of the Maher majority, saw McRae as an equal protection case challenging a "special exclusion of women." Id. at 350 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Justice Brennan in McRae compared the Hyde Amendment to the government's providing free transportation to the polls for citizens voting for Democratic candidates but not for citizens preferring Republicans. Surely, he wrote, that is not a mere failure to subsidize protected activity, but rather an unconstitutional penalty. Id. at 336 n.6. But see Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976) (holding constitutional Subtitle H of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, which provides financial assistance to some (but not all) candidates); Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. at 474 n.9 (relying on Buckley to support selective abortion funding). 116. See notes 99-104 and accompanying text supra. 117. Another answer may be that, despite the compelling nature of pregnancy, "impinge- ment" on the protected choice is defined not solely by the form of the state action but also by its</page><page sequence="19">1981] ABORTION-FUNDING CASES 739 reproductive choice,"8 but instead several discrete constitutional rights"9- for example, to procreate,'20 to use contraceptives,'2' and to obtain an abortion'22 -then failure to subsidize the exercise of the right to obtain an abortion is no more than governmental passivity,'23 and the subsidization of other activities is irrelevant.'24 If the abortion-funding cases recharacterized or narrowed the right recognized in Roe, they did so not so much by trans- forming it into a hollow right to decide'25 as by analytically severing it from other reproductive options. Conceptualizing a string of discrete rights in the contraception-abortion- procreation-family privacy area is not inherently illogical.'26 Nothing in the intrusiveness. See notes 36 &amp; 99 supra. Under this analysis, some active state interference with constitutional rights might be found not to impinge on those rights if the degree of interference is only slight. Selective funding may not present the degree of intrusion upon individual choice that the "impingement" test requires. Compare Steward Mach. Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 585-93 (1973) (economic incentives do not coerce states in violation of tenth amendment) with United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1, 70-72 (1936) (Agricultural Adjustment Act coerces farmers and states; "[a]t best it is a scheme for purchasing with federal funds submission to federal regulation of a subject reserved to the states").

The Roe Court held that, despite the silence of the constitu- tional text, the fourteenth amendment protects a woman's private right to choose abortion, see Ely, supra note 17, and the Court outlined the boundaries of that right. Certainly the language of the due process clause itself suggested neither the trimester timetable nor its accompanying constraints on the abortion right announced in Roe. 410 U.S. at 162-65. Yet commentators supporting abortion freedom did not fault the Court for setting temporal limits to circumscribe the right. See Perry, Abortion, the Public Morals, and the Police Power: The Ethical Function of Due Process, 23 U.C.L.A. L. Rev. 689, 733-34 (1976); Regan, supra note 87, at 1643; Tribe, supra note 6, at 27-28. And if the Court could establish those limits, why could it not also conclude that the abortion right is only a right to decide, see notes 69-74 and accompanying text supra, a negative right, see notes 99-104 and accompanying text supra, or one analytically distinct from the right to procreate, see notes 113-25 and accompanying text supra? Cf. 0. Holmes, Collected Legal Papers 168-69 (1920) (law is whatever the judges decide that it is). 129. Interestingly, some commentators who have found the abortion and abortion-funding cases flatly irreconcilable have chosen to ignore the strong pull of legal realism here. See L. Tribe, supra note 38, at 933 n.77; Perry, supra note 25. Professor Ely winks at it. Ely, The Centrality and Limits of Motivation Analysis, 15 San Diego L. Rev. 1155, 1157 n.10 (1978) (Maher is an outrageous, but inevitable, compromise given the Court's unprincipled value judgment in Roe). Yet, despite his condemnation of Roe, Ely seems to conclude that both lines of cases should march together toward or away from abortion freedom. Compare Ely, supra note 17, with J. Ely, supra note 102, at 162 n.*, 246 n.38. The Court's shifting perceptions of the judicial and legislative functions confirm that the Justices themselves-and not the constitutional text-determine the "rules" to be followed. Although the Roe majority explicitly weighed state and individual interests, notwithstanding the different balance struck by state legislatures, see 410 U.S. at 162-66, the McRae majority observed: After conducting an extensive evidentiary hearing into issues surrounding the public funding of abortion, the District Court concluded that "[t]he interests of . . . the federal government . . . in the fetus and in preserving it are not sufficient, weighed in the balance with the woman's threatened health, to justify withdrawing medical assistance unless the woman consents . . . to carry the fetus to term." In making an independent appraisal of the competing interests involved [in the Hyde Amendment], the District Court went beyond the judicial function. Such decisions are entrusted under the Consti- tution to Congress, not the courts. It is the role of the courts only to ensure that congressional decisions comport with the Constitution. * * * It is not the mission of this Court or any other to decide whether the balance of competing interests reflected in the Hyde Amendment is wise social policy. 448 U.S. at 325-26. Professor Perry attempts to avoid legal realism by rationalizing the Court's abortion deci- sions as expressions of "conventional moral culture." Perry, supra note 128, at 733.

Of the courts reaching the constitutional issue finally resolved by the Court in the 1980 cases,'30 only four correctly applied Maher and concluded that the government could constitutionally refuse to subsidize some medically necessary abortions.'3' The others invalidated such refusals on equal protec- tion or due process grounds, notwithstanding Maher.132 Remarkably, nearly all of these courts distinguished Maher on different bases-a phenomenon attesting as much to Maher's ambiguity as to judicial ingenuity. The district court in Zbaraz'33 applied the rational-relationship test dic- tated by Maher,'34 but concluded that Illinois's subsidy of only those abor- tions necessary to preserve maternal life was irrational in its failure to pro- mote fiscal frugality'35 and in its preference for nonviable fetal life over maternal health.'36 In Doe v. Percy,'37 the level of governmental intrusion was indistinguish- able from that in Maher.'38 Nevertheless, the district court invalidated Wis- consin's statutory limits'39 on the ground that the involvement of maternal health demanded strict judicial scrutiny.'40 In Reproductive Health Services v. Freeman, '4' the effect-rather than the form'42-of the state action was held to require more than a showing of "minimal rationality." 143 The Mis- 130.

Maher, 149 where the district court explicitly applied "middle-tier" scrutiny'50 to Con- necticut's funding limits'5' and rejected that state's asserted goals of encour- aging "normal childbirth," 152 favoring fetal life over maternal health,'53 and conserving limited public resources. 54 All of these lower court efforts to limit Maher faltered on the same critical point. Identifying this error is of more than historical importance: the same analytical flaw infects the McRae dissents'55 and has already begun to produce considerable misunderstanding of the 1980 decisions.'56 All of these lower courts failed to differentiate between a woman's own interest in her health, which, under Roe, the state may never subordinate to its interest in fetal life,'57 and the state's interest in her health,'58 which becomes sufficiently compelling after the first trimester to justify abortion regulations designed to further that interest. 159 144. The Missouri regulation itself did not contain that exception, but instead funded abortion only where the attending physician believes and certifies that "a full-term pregnancy and childbirth would cause cessation of the mother's life."

Id.</page><page sequence="23">1981] ABOR TION-FUNDING CASES 743 Although Roe determined that a woman's interest in her own health always outweighs the state's interest in fetal life,'60 it did not compel any particular ordering of priorities among the state's own possible interests. Indeed, the Roe Court characterized as constitutionally permissible rather than constitutionally compelled'6' those state interests that it identified, im- plying that a state is free not to entertain them.'62 For example, a state presumably remains free to legalize all abortions, whenever performed, and to disregard the resulting detriment to fetal life.'63 Similarly, a state may, if it chooses, assert no interest in safeguarding maternal health. It follows, too, that a state may embrace one interest and not the other. Each of the lower courts that tried to limit Maher by finding impermissi- ble an official decision to accord greater weight to potential life than to maternal health'64 overlooked this difference.'65 Yet, once the Court in Maher concluded that funding restrictions do not impinge upon an individ- ual's protected privacy right'66 (or the component interests underlying that right, including maternal health'67), the only remaining question is the manner in which a state elects to order its own interests. The regulations challenged in the post-Maher cases were condemned for exhibiting a state interest in mater- nal health subordinate to that in fetal life.'68 As the majority opinions in 160. The Roe Court did not specify whose interest in maternal health it contemplated at each step of its analysis: "If the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. " Id. at 163-64 (emphasis added). But the absolute nature of this exception, together with the language of permissibility regarding state interests, see note 161 and accompany- ing text infra, indicates that here the Court must have been addressing the woman's interest in life and health. 161. The Court stated that after the first trimester a state "may regulate the abortion procedure" to protect maternal health, "if it chooses," id. (emphasis added) and "may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion" after viability, subject to the maternal health exception noted earlier, id. at 164-65 (emphasis added). 162. Similarly, a pregnant woman is free not to entertain the possible interests the Court ascribes to her. See id. at 153. For example, she may choose to forego an abortion in order to protect the potential life of the fetus she carries, notwithstanding the possible health risks posed by continued pregnancy and childbirth. Cf. Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. at 472 n.7 ("A woman has at least an equal right to choose to carry her fetus to term as to choose to abort it."). 163. See generally Appleton, The Abortion-Funding Cases, supra note 61. 164. See, e.g., D.R. v. Mitchell, 617 F.2d 203, 205 (10th Cir.), vacated and remanded mem., 449 U.S. 808 (1980); Reproductive Health Servs. v. Freeman, 614 F.2d 585, 597-99 (8th Cir.), vacated and remanded mem., 449 U.S. 809 (1980); Women's Health Servs., Inc. v. Maher, 482 F. Supp. 725, 734-35 (D.

So, too, did the McRae dissenters, particularly Justice Stevens, the sole convert from the Maher majority. 166. 432 U.S. at 474; see text accompanying note 76 supra. 167. See notes 118-29 and accompanying text supra. 168. Of course, one may question the wisdom of this ordering of state interests. But surely Maher and its companions foreclose the conclusion that the protection of nonviable fetal life is per se illegitimate. See note 61 and accompanying text supra. Perhaps the post-Maher lower court decisions, e.g., Zbaraz v. Quern, 469 F. Supp. at 1219 (Illinois's "interest in promoting the life of a nonviable fetus in a woman for whom an abortion is medically necessary" held illegitimate), intended to suggest that failure to subsidize medically necessary abortions is an irrational means of promoting the state's legitimate interest in fetal life, in view of the cost to another legitimate</page><page sequence="24">744 COLUMBIA LAW RE VIEW [Vol. 81:721 McRae and Zbaraz confirm, a woman's interests in her own health are not "impinged" by selective subsidies,'69 and the state is free to disregard its own possible interest in her health if it chooses.'70 This same error pervades Justice Stevens's dissent in McRae, which consistently confuses state health interests with individual health interests and assumes that the state interests identified in Roe are mandatory rather than permissible.'7' Similar analysis reveals the flaw in the lower court opinions and in the McRae dissents'72 that attempted to distinguish between official efforts to encourage normal childbirth, approved by Maher, 173 and more restrictive medical assistance programs that arguably promote only "abnormal child- birth."''74 Again, it is a state's prerogative to identify and order its own state interest, maternal health. See 469 F. Supp. at 1220 ("We cannot hold that the state has a legitimate interest in preserving the life of a non-viable fetus at the cost of increased maternal morbidity and mortality among indigent pregnant women.") Because considerations of cost seem more appropriately subsumed under an inquiry into the rationality of the means selected than the legitimacy of the end, see generally Bennett, supra note 24, at 1062-69; see also Michelman, Politics and Values or What's Really Wrong with Rationality Review?, 13 Creighton L. Rev. 487, 500-01 (1979), one again confronts the conclusion drawn in the text: given several legitimate and permissible (but not compulsory) state interests, a state may rank them in any order it sees fit. 169. 448 U.S. at 317-18. As Justice White intimated in his concurring opinion in McRae, the question was one of "legislative preference" that Roe had left unresolved. Id. at 328. 170. The district court in Zbaraz suggested that to subordinate maternal health to fetal life is irrational unless the fetus has reached viability. See 469 F. Supp. at 1219-21. If a fetus is not capable of extrauterine survival-"meaningful life outside the mother's womb," Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. at 163-the inaccessability of abortion to a mother whose health is at risk might lead to the death of both mother and child. See also Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. at 340 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (under Hyde Amendment "federal funding is unavailable in cases in which it is known that the fetus itself will be unable to survive"). But a state has other interests besides fetal life and maternal health. And the district court completely overlooked the possibility that a state might use its selective funding policies to serve a legitimate expressive function-communicating the electorate's preference for childbirth-even if some fetal as well as maternal life is lost in the process. See note 61 and accompanying text supra. See also 469 F. Supp. at 1218 (quoting state Senator Lemke, sponsor of Illinois's restriction: "My people don't want abortions being per- formed with their money."); Yudof, supra note 61, at 894 (official speech as means of accom- plishing social policy objectives). Cf. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 19 (1976) (expenditure restrictions infringe free expression). Thus, the state's ordering of its interests to favor fetal life over maternal health need not signal irrationality or overinclusiveness simply because the life of the fetus may not be saved. Of course, the state cannot favor its interest in fetal life in such a way as to impinge on an individual's interest in her own health. But as first Maher and then McRae and Zbaraz determined, the mere refusal to subsidize abortions does not constitute such impinge- ment. 171. See, e.g., Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. at 350 ("The competing interests are the interest in maternal health and the interest in protecting potential human life."); id. at 352 ("Roe v. Wade squarely held that the States may not protect [potential life] interest when a conflict with the interest in a pregnant woman's health exists."); id. at 352 n.4 ("Since Roe v. Wade squarely held that the individual interest in the freedom to elect an abortion and the state interest in protecting maternal health both outweigh the State's interest in protecting potential life prior to viability, the Court's 'equal protection analysis' is doubly erroneous."). 172. Justices Marshall and Stevens assumed that a state interest in abnormal childbirth would be impossible or illegitimate. See 448 U.S. at 344 (Marsnall, J., dissenting); id. at 351 n.3 (Stevens, J., dissenting). See also 12 Tex. Tech. L. Rev. 483, 497 (1981). 173. 432 U.S. at 478, 479. 174.

Supp.</page><page sequence="25">19811 ABORTION-FUNDING CASES 745 interests; and although Maher suggested that Connecticut's interest lay in promoting normal childbirth,'75 the Court never excluded as illegitimate or unreasonable other possible state concerns that different jurisdictions (or Connecticut itself) might entertain.'76 Even "abnormal childbirth" may be among those interests.'77 The Eighth Circuit's analysis of the effect of the rape-incest exception in Reproductive Health Services v. Freeman'78 founders on similar grounds. Absent "impingement," a state may choose its own interests and determine their relative importance. A non-impinging state is never required to subordi- nate its interest in potential life, although it may elect to do so in cases where it has determined that its other interests-such as the psychological well-being of rape and incest victims79 -are paramount. Moreover, although the Court of Appeals faulted the exception for its underinclusiveness-that is, that the goal of protecting fetal life would be furthered only erratically'80-in fact the system operates no more "irrationally" than the program validated in Maher, with its impact only on the poor and with the ability of some members of that class to circumvent its mission.'8' For similar reasons, Justice Marshall's McRae dissent, criticizing the imperfect fit between legislative means and end,'82 misses the mark. In short, the Court has held that the mere refusal to subsidize abortion does not create an impingement, and thus any state interest not plainly irrational will suffice to make the refusal constitutional. 725, 734 (D. Conn.), vacated and remanded, 636 F.2d 23 (2d Cir. 1980). But see Doe v. Mundy, 441 F. Supp. 447, 451 (E.D. Wis. 1977) (argument rejected). 175. See notes 58-59 and accompanying text supra. 176. In Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379 (1979), the state asserted its interest in one sort of "abnormal childbirth": the birth of certain congenitally defective infants. See id. at 390. 177. In addition, selective medical assistance that results in "abnormal childbirth" may promote a state's demographic or expressive goals as effectively as assistance that results in "normal childbirth." See notes 61, 168 and 170 and accompanying text supra. Of course, another rejoinder is that Maher may have sought simply to contrast pregnancy to term and childbirth (the "normal" outcome of a pregnancy) with induced abortion (an "unnatu- ral" or "abnormal" outcome). See Appleton, The Abortion-Funding Cases, supra note 61, at 1699-700 &amp; n.l. Cf. Horan &amp; Marzen, supra note 99, at 567 (discussing official promotion of "natural childbirth" over abortion). Maher's language, including its occasional references to "childbirth" not modified by "normal," 432 U.S. at 479, carried no intimation that its conclu- sion covered only those pregnancies free from extraordinary medical complications. Cf. Regan, supra note 87, at 1579-82 (cataloguing physical burdens imposed by "normal" pregnancy and childbirth). 178. 614 F.2d 585 (8th Cir.), vacated and remanded mem., 449 U.S. 809 (1980). See note 145 and accompanying text supra. 179. A state may, then, elect to fund the abortions of rape and incest victims as an exception to its otherwise restrictive abortion funding.

THE LIMITS OF FUNDAMENTAL-RIGHTS ANALYSIS: CONSEQUENCES OF THE IMPINGEMENT REQUIREMENT In 1945, the Supreme Court stated that "it is the character of the right, not of the limitation, which determines what [judicial] standard governs the [legislative] choice."'83 Maher and McRae, taken to their logical conclu- sions, turn that principle on its head and inject a new element into substantive due process adjudication and ordinary two-tiered equal protection review.'84 They apply the special constitutional protection of strict judicial scrutiny'85 only to fundamental-rights cases that challenge "impinging" state action.'86 Any official restriction that falls short of "impingement" calls for the consid- erably less demanding rationality test.'87 Even before Maher, recitations of the criteria for strict scrutiny routinely included an impingement requirement. However, the Court often appeared equally ready to apply that test to less intrusive conjunctions of state action and individual fundamental right. Thus, the nature of the individual interest asserted apparently triggered strict scrutiny even if that interest was only ''affected, 9 188 ''involved,' 189 ''abutted,' 190 "touched upon, ''9 "impli- cated,"'992 or "at stake."'193 "Impingement" served not as a discrete substan- tive requirement but rather as one synonym for the presence of any state action.'94 Until at least the early 1970's, identifying those rights deemed 183.

Rodriguez, 197 an unsuccessful "wealth-discrimination" challenge to the inequities of Texas' public-school financing system. Although the case is most often cited for its determination that education is not a fundamental right,'98 in retrospect Justice Powell's majority opinion contains telling language. In explaining the fundamental-rights branch of the test for strict judicial scrutiny, Justice Powell distinguished Rodriguez "from any of the cases in which the Court has applied strict scrutiny to state or federal legislation touching upon constitutionally protected rights." 199 He then sug- gested that "touching upon" is not enough: "Each of our prior cases involved legislation which 'deprived,' 'infringed,' or 'interfered' with the free exercise of some such fundamental personal right or liberty."200 By contrast, the challenged Texas law extended and improved education, albeit unequally.20' In the language of Maher and McRae, the state action did not "impinge" on the asserted right, fundamental or not. Although Justice Powell continued to probe the nature and quality of the state action challenged in subsequent cases,202 the other members of the Court tion of a compelling state interest). See also L. Tribe, supra note 38, at 1002 ("inequalities bearing on fundamental rights" may penalize exercise of protected right or impinge directly on access to right); Karst, Invidious Discrimination: Justice Douglas and the Return of the "Natural-Law- Due-Process Formula," 16 U.C.L.A.

If the Court considered the character of the state action in these cases, it did so at a different point in the analysis. After determining that strict scrutiny applies to protect fundamen- tal personal rights, the Court sometimes examined the burdensomeness of the action undertaken to further the government's asserted compelling interest. Then, according to one commentator, the Court would generally uphold slight burdens on the individual right but would strike down substantial ones, if alternative, less burdensome means were available. See generally Note, Of Interests, Fundamental and Compelling: The Emerging Constitutional Balance, 57 B.U.L. Rev. 462 (1977). By contrast, Maher and McRae dictate that the character of the state action chal- lenged will determine whether strict scrutiny applies at all. 197. 411 U.S. 1 (1973). 198. See, e.g., J. Nowak, R.

Population Services Interna- tional,204 where Justice Powell disagreed with the majority's application of strict scrutiny to state action that he found merely to "implicate" sexual freedom.205 Misunderstanding Powell's point and therefore focusing on the right at stake rather than the state action challenged, the majority disclaimed having decided whether the Constitution protects private sexual conduct.206 In Maher, decided just after Carey, a majority expressly embraced Powell's view,207 although without entirely dispelling the confusion.208 Finally, in McRae the doctrine found another spokesman in Justice Stewart.209 The impingement requirement has solid textual roots in that the four- teenth amendment bars only "deprivations" and "denials."'210 Of course, to the extent that that is true, the Court has never explained why non-impinging state action must meet even the rationality test. If the fourteenth amendment does not address the passive state, why must any constitutional standard of review apply?21' The impingement requirement is also a useful analytic tool, laying a sound theoretical foundation for clearly underinclusive ameliorative programs 203. See notes 188-94 and accompanying text supra. A closer look reveals some arguable exceptions to this generalization. See notes 227-29 and accompanying text infra. Cf., e.g., Hill v. Stone, 421 U.S. 289, 299 (1975) (if challenged classification imposes "no real impediment" to voting, it serves no rational purpose); McDonald v. Board of Elec. Comm'rs, 394 U.S. 802, 807 (1969) (lack of absentee ballots for prisoners has no impact on right to vote because the right to vote is not "at stake" here). 204. 431 U.S. 678 (1977). 205. The Carey majority found strict scrutiny as applicable to restrictions on access to the means of exercising a fundamental right as to direct prohibitions. 431 U.S. at 688; see note 52 supra. Mr. Justice Powell, concurring in part and dissenting in part, disagreed: Neither our precedents nor sound principles of constitutional analysis require state legislation to meet the exacting 'compelling state interest' standard whenever it impli- cates sexual freedom. In my view, those cases make clear that that standard has been invoked only when the state regulation entirely frustrates or heavily burdens the exercise of constitutional rights in this area. 431 U.S. at 705 (emphasis added). 206. Id. at 688 n.5. 207. See notes 75-78 and accompanying text supra. 208. Justice Marshall, dissenting in Maher and its companions, accused the majority of "legal legerdemain," by which a "fundamental right is no longer at stake." Beal v. Doe, 432 U.S. at 457. A better analysis, I believe, is that a fundamental right is at stake, but that being "at stake" is no longer enough. Impingement must be shown. 209. By this time, the dissenting Justices had identified the issue more precisely. See 448 U.S. at 329 (Brennan, J., dissenting, joined by Marshall, J., and Blackmun, J.): "I write separately to express my continuing disagreement with the Court's mischaracterization of the nature of the fundamental right recognized in Roe . . . and its misconception of the manner in which that right is infringed by . . . legislation withdrawing all funding for medically necessary abortions." (Em- phasis added; footnote deleted.) 210. Similarly, the fifth amendment forbids "deprivations" of liberty, and the first amend- ment bars "prohibitions" of the free exercise of religion and "abridgments" of the guarantee of the free speech. See note 227 and accompanying text infra. 211. In Maher and McRae, after refusing to apply the compelling-state-interest test to state action that does not impinge on the fundamental right recognized in Roe, the Court applied the rationality test. 432 U.S. at 475-78; 448 U.S. at 324-26. See note 24 supra.</page><page sequence="29">1981] ABORTION-FUNDING CASES 749 such as those upheld in Rodriguez and the abortion-funding cases, whatever the character of the right "involved.'"212 Before the Court formulated the impingement requirement, it often upheld such underinclusive reform mea- sures by applying a one-step-at-a-time approach: the Constitution does not compel the state to "strike at all evils at the same time" ;213 legislative reform "may take one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute.'"214 Because the Court has invoked this slogan in the absence of evidence that the government contemplated additional amelio- rative steps,215 the Court's rationale may more closely resemble wishful think- ing than empirically supported reasoning. The impingement requirement vali- dates the same measures but obviates the need for judicial fantasies. Similarly, the impingement requirement provides a plausible rationale for the otherwise baffling holdings in the pregnancy-discrimination cases.216 It 212. See notes 188-93 supra. 213.

For example, in Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484 (1974), California had offered no evidence that it planned, in the future, to extend its disability insurance program to include benefits for disabilities accompanying normal pregnancy and childbirth. 216. Nashville Gas Co. v. Satty, 434 U.S. 136 (1977) (upholding as nondiscriminatory, under title VII, employer's refusal to award sick-leave pay to pregnant employees but striking down as illegal sex discrimination employer's denial of accumulated seniority to employees returning to work after disability caused by childbirth); General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125 (1976) (sustaining against allegations of illegal sex discrimination, prohibited by title VII, employer's exclusion of pregnancy-related disability benefits from employee disability plan); Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484 (1974) (upholding against an equal protection challenge California's disabil- ity insurance system excluding disabilities accompanying normal pregnancy and childbirth); Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. LaFleur, 414 U.S. 632 (1974) (finding a due process violation in the 4"conclusive presumption" that every pregnant teacher becomes physically incapable of continu- ing her job when she reaches the fifth or sixth month of pregnancy). Although some of these cases concern the funding policies of private employers, not subject to the constraints of the fourteenth and fifth amendments, assume, for heuristic purposes, a rough equivalence between title VII, 42 U.S.C. ? 2000e (1976 &amp; Supp. 11 1978), and those constitutional provisions, see General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U.S. 125, 133 (1976). All three of the policies the Court upheld (the disability exclusions validated in Geduldig and Gilbert and the sick-pay denial approved in Satty) were refusals to subsidize an employee's pregnancy and childbirth. In other words, they were all failures to pay for the employee's exercise of her right to procreate, see notes 119-20 and accompanying text supra. By contrast, the Court struck down two policies (the mandatory leave in LaFleur and the withdrawal of accumulated seniority in Satty) that "penalized" or "impinged" upon the exercise of that right by depriving the woman of something to which she was otherwise entitled-several months of employment or seniority that was already hers. In fact, the Court in LaFleur expressly noted that "[b]y acting to penalize the pregnant teacher for deciding to bear a child, overly restrictive maternity leave regulations can constitute a heavy burden on the exercise of constitutionally protected freedoms." 414 U.S. at 640 (emphasis added). Justice Powell, concurring in the result in LaFleur, on the ground that the challenged policies created irrational classifications, disagreed that the incidental deterrent effect of a mandatory leave policy amounted to a "penalty" on childbearing; in his</page><page sequence="30">750 COLUMBIA LA W RE VIEW [Vol. 81:721 also illuminates two first amendment challenges to funding disparities in which the Court upheld failures to accord equal financial support to one of two (constitutionally protected) alternatives.217 The impingement requirement, however, is likely to have more far-reach- ing and problematic consequences. Just as decreased individual protection resulted from the Court's decision to emphasize the "liberty" and "property" requirements in procedural due process challenges,218 the same result may follow from the new insistence on "impingement" in fundamental-rights cases. The doctrine may reach beyond demands for what amount to positive rights,219 to uphold-without the demonstration of a compelling state inter- est-active state interference producing only (so-called) "slight" intrusions held not to constitute "impingements" on protected negative rights.220 Maher, McRae, and Zbaraz might fit within this "slight"-intrusion cate- gory if the assertion that selective funding-state action plus inaction-ac- tively "affects" reproductive choice proves unanswerable.22' Even if govern- mental refusals to subsidize abortion are analytically inseparable from the funding of childbirth222 (and therefore cannot be viewed as "passive"), the resulting degree of interference with protected choice might nevertheless fall short of true impingement.223 Although this approach to the cases departs from McRae's language of "entitlement"224-with its clear suggestion of the view, financial incentives designed to discourage procreation do not violate the Constitution. Id. at 651-52. See Appleton, The Abortion-Funding Cases, supra note 61, at 1713-16 and authorities cited therein. Efforts to reconcile these cases on their own terms, particularly after Satty's conclusion that pregnancy-based discrimination is sex discrimination in the sick-pay context but not in the seniority context, have led commentators to describe the Court's reasoning as "unconvincing and sometimes incomprehensible." Kirp &amp; Robyn, Pregnancy, Justice, and the Justices, 57 Tex. L. Rev. 947, 954 (1979). A footnote to the footnote: In 1978, Congress amended title VII to prohibit explicitly discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and childbirth. 42 U.S.C. ? 2000e(k) (Supp. 11 1978). 217. Buckley v.

See notes 113-29 and accompanying text supra. See also Buckley v.

See note 101 and accompanying text supra. When challengers seek to extend an amelio- rative program, they are claiming, in effect, a positive right; they are trying, for example, to establish a constitutional right, through the equal protection guarantee, to additional education (San Antonio Indep. School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1 (1973)), or to welfare benefits (Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471 (1970)). 220. If this hypothesis is correct, the effect of the challenged state action would be as significant as its form. But see note 110 and accompanying text supra.

The im- pingement requirement may, by providing a coherent-though imprecise and open-ended230 analytical framework, support additional compromises of in- dividual rights.23' Indeed, in the abortion context alone, courts have already 225. See notes 99-109 and accompanying text supra. 226. Ironically, because of the difficulties posed by the uniquely compelling nature of pregnancy, see notes 34-37 and accompanying text supra, and the Court's emphasis on private choice, see, e.g., Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. at 313-17, the abortion-funding context provides a singularly shaky foundation for this reading of the "impingement" requirement. 227. See Young v. American Mini Theaters, Inc., 427 U.S. 50, 60 (1976) (regulation of location of adult theaters has no "significant deterrent effect" on first amendment rights); id. at 70-71 (plurality opinion) (regulation falls short of total suppression); Village of Belle Terre v.

Although cases of complete governmental passivity may be easy to decide under the impingement requirement, it will be considerably more difficult to make principled distinctions between "slight" interference and true impingement.

THE ABORTION-FUNDING CASES AND THE LIMITS OF THE WELFARE-RIGHTS THESIS Despite the ultimate congruence of questions posed by Maher, McRae, and Zbaraz for abortion law and fundamental-rights litigation,239 the Court's 1980 opinions address one question Maher did not raise. That question asks to what extent the Constitution guarantees every person minimal subsistence. The answer seems to be not at all. Over the last decade, Professor Frank Michelman, in waging a constitu- tional war on poverty,240 has offered several detailed and forceful, though does not "dilute" anyone's vote). See also United Jewish Orgs. v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144, 165 (1977) (plurality opinion) (New York's use of racial criteria in redistricting did not "unfairly cancel out white voting strength"). 236. For example, San Antonio Indep. School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1 (1973), arguably announced new limits on the types of interests the Court will consider to be "fundamen- tal rights." See id. at 110 (Marshall, J., dissenting) ("Court now suggests that only interests guaranteed by the Constitution are fundamental for purposes of equal protection analysis"). See also Gunther, supra note 24. In addition, the Court may now also require purposeful impingement as a precondition of strict judicial scrutiny for even concededly fundamental rights. See City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 112-22 (1980) (Marshall, J., dissenting). See also Baird v. Department of Pub. Health, 599 F.2d 1098, 1101 (1st Cir. 1979) ("Since Roe, the Supreme Court has made it clear that reasonable state regulations not designed to impinge upon the abortion decision may be applied to first trimester abortions.") (emphasis added). Cf. Ely, supra note 129, at 1160-61 (motivation analysis appropriate only for claims of improper discrimination, not denials of protected rights). Compare Califano v. Jobst, 434 U.S. 47, 58 (1977) (no demonstration of congressional antago- nism to marriage) with Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361, 382 (1974) (Congress may make armed service more attractive than alternative service by conscientious objectors). Whatever its signifi- cance elsewhere, this analytic development has uncertain relevance for the abortion-funding context because the Court has cited with favor governmental efforts to discriminate against abortion. See note 112 supra. See also H. L. v. Matheson, 101 S. Ct. 1164, 1173 (1981). 237. By imposing one more criterion that may be found wanting in any given case, the impingement requirement will afford the Court another opportunity to reject each individual constitutional challenge. 238. See Calvert v. West Virginia Legal Servs. Plan, Inc., 464 F. Supp. 789, 791 (S.D.W. Va. 1979) (court need not "decide whether divorce is a fundamental right or something less, for Defendant's policy in no way, directly or substantially, interferes with Plaintiff's right to seek a divorce and, therefore, does not rise to the level of an impermissible interference"). The Supreme Court has used similar evasions in deciding difficult procedural due process cases. It avoids deciding whether the requisite liberty or property interest is present by assuming its presence and then finding that existing safeguards provide all the process that is due. E.g., Parham v. J. R., 442 U.S. 584, 600 (1979); Board of Curators v. Horowitz, 435 U.S. 78, 84-85 (1978); Smith v. Organization of Foster Families for Equality and Reform, 431 U.S. 816, 847 (1977). 239. See text accompanying notes 96-97 supra. 240.

See sources cited in note 12 supra. 242.

The primary problem is that Michelman has had to redefine the term "constitu- tional right" to tie his welfare right to existing state action. See id. 250. The nature of the initial state action will dictate the content of the specific welfare right, thus simplifying the judicial task.

Professor Michelman concedes that it is a right limited to satisfaction of "basic wants'' 255 or "minimum protection,"256 but he insists that it is a judicially recognized right nonetheless. Consequently, he can rely as much on the unsuccessful challenges as he does on the victories.257 For example, in San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez,258 the Court declined to equalize educational opportunities among rich and poor school districts, seemingly undercutting Michelman's claims.259 Nevertheless, because the Court cautioned that the Constitution might well compel provision of a minimum "quantum of educa- tion,"260 he invokes the case to support his hypothesis.26' He cites other successful due process and equal protection challenges to reinforce his argu- ment262 and marshalls the apparent defeats not to illustrate temporary judicial blindness, but to provide clues about the precise scope of the right.263 In an earlier article, I suggested that the 1977 abortion-funding cases presented a host of difficulties for Michelman's theory,264 for I found the Court's decisions incompatible with his attempt to discover in the case law judicial recognition and enforcement of a constitutional right to minimal subsistence for the poor. The Maher Court's refusal to characterize the chal- lengers as a "suspect class,"265 its inability to discern any cognizable "wealth discrimination,"266 its deference to majoritarian choice in matters of wel- 252. See Michelman, Welfare Rights, supra note 12, at 662-64. 253. E.g., Douglas v.

L.J. 83 (1978) (citing recent first amendment decisions as evidence of Court's concern for the poor's access to basic needs). 263. Again, an example proves illuminating. Although the Court has required evidentiary hearings prior to terminations of Social Security benefits necessary for subsistence (AFDC payments), Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 264 (1970), it has refused to hold that the Constitu- tion compels that protection for welfare benefits not so plainly essential for sheer survival (disability payments), Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 340-43 (1976). See Michelman, Welfare Rights, supra note 18, at 688-93. 264. Appleton, Commentary, supra note 61, at 724-29. See also id. at 719 n.37. 265. Maher v.

I also speculated that later cases raising the questions Maher left unanswered-the questions McRae and Zbaraz in fact presented-would more accurately test the validity of Michelman's position.269 Maher, because it concerned the denial of financial assistance only for elective abortions270 -by definition, less essential to sound health, and sometimes to bare survival,27' than the medically necessary abor- tions in McRae and Zbaraz272 -arguably lay at the periphery of Michelman's welfare right. By contrast, McRae and Zbaraz go to the heart of Michelman's welfare right. Indeed, these cases are ideal vehicles for enforcing one component of the welfare right: basic health care.273 Professor Michelman claims that the Constitution guarantees necessary health care and that the Court recognized this positive right in Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County.274 In that case, the Court invalidated Arizona's durational residency requirement for free nonemergency medical assistance for the indigent, in terms that emphasized the importance of essential health care.275 Reading Memorial Hospital along with other challenges to residency requirements276 and other welfare litiga- tion,277 Michelman finds persuasive reinforcement for his thesis.278 But if he once believed that the Court would invariably find a constitutional basis for providing all necessary medical services, then surely McRae and Zbaraz have proven him wrong. Necessary health care was unquestionably at stake,279 the initial state action required to trigger the welfare right280 was certainly 267. See id. at 479-80. 268. See id. at 474. 269.

In McRae and Zbaraz a majority of the Justices held that whether or not the state will provide the indigent with some of the goods and services they need to participate in the political process is a question to be decided by that process itself.287 The Court has refused to find the welfare right in the Constitution. CONCLUSION As this Article has shown, most analyses and applications of the abor- tion-funding cases have been misdirected. The Supreme Court suggested in Maher and confirmed in McRae and Zbaraz that governmental refusals to subsidize abortions for the indigent do not impair the right to private auton- omy recognized in Roe v. Wade-the purely negative right to obtain (at a woman's own expense) an abortion, free from state interference. So inter- preted, however, the holdings in the abortion-funding cases reach well beyond 281. Under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. ?? 1396-1396k (1976 &amp; Supp. 11 1978), Congress and participating states provide some necessary medical care to eligible individuals. Indeed, even under the Hyde Amendment and its state counterparts, some abortions are subsi- dized. See notes 3, 80-84 and accompanying text supra. Two of the McRae dissenters pointed out that it was the initial governmental action accompanied by the exclusion of one class of aid recipients that caused the constitutional problem. See 448 U.S. at 348 (Marshall, J., dissenting); id. at 356 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Although the Maher majority had emphasized the constitu- tional limitations upon a state's selective alleviation of "the hardships of poverty," 432 U.S. at 469-70, the McRae majority took refuge in the reminder that equal protection "is not a source of substantive rights or liberties," 448 U.S. at 322. 282. Professor Perry's criticism of Maher is persuasive on this point. None of the abortion- funding cases asked the Court to increase the state's fiscal burden because abortions are cheaper than childbirth; nor did the Court have to struggle to identify a new "fundamental right" because Roe already recognized the abortion right. Moreover, Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494 (1977), clearly endorsed the use of substantive due process as a vehicle for recognizing previously unidentified constitutional rights. The abortion-funding cases, therefore, pose no significant problems of judicial manageability, authority or competence. Perry, supra note 25, at 1238-40. 283. See note 3 supra. 284.

The Court has interposed an "impingement" requirement between individual litigants asserting their fundamental rights and the strict judicial scrutiny they seek. This new overlay on substantive due process and equal protection adjudication, not logically confined to the abor- tion-funding context, invites greater judicial tolerance of state action bearing on all fundamental rights.288 Moreover, McRae and Zbaraz repudiate deci- sively the welfare-rights thesis. The Court has announced that the indigent must look to the political process-not to the courts or the Constitution-for the satisfaction of some of even their most basic needs. 288. "Inequalities bearing on fundamental rights" is Professor Tribe's phrase, remarkably equivocal and therefore perhaps prescient of the new importance of impingement. L.
