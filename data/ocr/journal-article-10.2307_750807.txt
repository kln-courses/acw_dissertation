<plain_text><page sequence="1">LATE-ANTIQUE INFLUENCES IN SOME ENGLISH MEDIAEVAL ILLUSTRATIONS OF GENESIS By George Henderson The foremost authority on the history of Biblical illustration in mediaeval England, Dr. M. R. James, believed that an illustrated late-Antique Biblical manuscript lay behind the picture-cycles in two Anglo-Saxon manu- scripts, the Caedmon MS. in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, MS. Junius I I, and Aelfric's Paraphrase of the Pentateuch and Joshua in the British Museum, Cotton MS. Claudius B. IV.1 More recently a third manuscript, the fourteenth- century Egerton Genesis, British Museum Egerton MS. I894, has been brought forward as a possible descendant of the same late-Antique archetype, which, it is suggested, contained a cycle of illustrations belonging to the Cotton Genesis tradition.2 In this paper I will discuss some of the evidence that the illustrators of the Caedmon, Aelfric, and Egerton MSS. depended for the creation of their picture-cycles on a source or sources containing Biblical illustrations of a kind current in the late-Antique period. I will try to discover whether the English MSS. can be made to yield any very precise information about ancient source materials preserved in this country in the Middle Ages. I will begin by pointing out certain features in our three manuscripts which tend to contradict the stimulating hypothesis, referred to above, that all three manuscripts may descend from a common archetype belonging specifically to the Cotton Genesis tradition. On page 9 of the Caedmon MS. God is repre- sented bending over Adam and removing a rib from his side.3 God is repre- sented removing Adam's rib in the cycle of Genesis mosaics on the vestibule domes of San Marco, Venice, a primary source, of our knowledge of the Cotton Genesis tradition, and consequently this method of illustrating the process of the creation of Eve, which follows literally the text of Genesis ii. 21, 1 M. R. James, "Illustrations of the Old Testament", in S. C. Cockerell, A Book of Old Testament Illustrations of the Middle of the Thirteenth Century, Roxburghe Club, 1927, pp. 21-22. The large number of illustrations in the Anglo-Saxon MSS. and their repre- sentations of "the burials of the antedilu- vians" reminded James of the Cotton Genesis, but he does not actually suggest that the archetype of the Anglo-Saxon MSS. was a late-Antique MS. belonging specifically to the Cotton Genesis tradition. He states his opinion in quite a general way. Thus of the Aelfric MS. he writes: "I am persuaded that . . . in this Hexateuch we have some sort of reflection of the classical age of Christian art." 2 See O. Picht, "A Giottesque Episode in English Mediaeval Art", this Journal, VI, I943, pp. 64-65. Pacht considers that seven illustrations in the Egerton MS. are related significantly to their counterparts among the Genesis mosaics at San Marco, Venice. As is well known, these mosaics were based on miniatures in a late-Antique MS. of the Cotton Genesis type. For the first demonstra- tion of this, see J. J. Tikkanen, Die Genesis- mosaiken von S. Marco in Venedig und ihr Verhdltniss zu den Miniaturen der Cottonbibel, Helsingfors, I889, passim. Pacht makes a tentative suggestion that the Cotton Genesis- type features which he recognizes in the Egerton MS. were copied from the hypo- thetical late-Antique model of the two Anglo- Saxon MSS., but he also, with admirable impartiality, points out that the artist of the Egerton MS. could equally well have ob- tained his knowledge of the Cotton Genesis tradition in Italy.

Gollancz, The Caedmon MS. of Anglo-Saxon Biblical Poetry, Oxford, 1927. 172</page><page sequence="2">LATE-ANTIQUE INFLUENCES IN SOME ILLUSTRATIONS OF GENESIS 173 is recognized as one of the essential features of the Cotton Genesis tradition.4 It is found with slight variations in all the MSS. which have been singled out at different times as mediaeval representatives of the Cotton Genesis tradition, namely the ninth-century Tours Bibles, and the twelfth-century Millstatt Genesis and Hortus Deliciarum.5 The Caedmon MS., then, contains on page 9 an indisputable reflection of the Cotton Genesis tradition. The Aelfric and Egerton MSS., on the other hand, represent the 'Creation of Eve' quite differently. Eve herself is raised from Adam's side.6 So, at a point where we might well expect to find a clear indication of the existence of a Cotton Genesis archetype common to all three manuscripts, we in fact draw a blank. No better result, so far as a common Cotton Genesis archetype is concerned, is obtained if we tackle the question from a different direction, by first isolating those compositions and motifs which do actually correspond in the Caedmon and Aelfric MSS., and in the Caedmon and Egerton MSS. The only occasion on which the picture-cycles in the Caedmon and Aelfric MSS. approach really close to one another is in the two consecutive illustrations, found in both manuscripts, of 'Noah's Ark floating on the waters of the Flood'. There the Ark is represented as a high- ended Viking ship carrying on its hull a tall stepped superstructure, and, in the case of the Caedmon version, entirely surrounded by tossing waves, not, as in the Cotton Genesis tradition, as a box-shaped vessel set against the horizon line of a calm sea.7 The only illustrations in which some measure of agreement is apparent between the Caedmon and Egerton MSS., namely the scenes of God creating the world and its contents while seated above on a rainbow, and the scenes of Lamech's wives and children, either run directly counter to the Cotton Genesis tradition or are unrecorded in the extant repre- sentatives of that tradition.8 4 Reproduced in S.

The contradictory nature of iconographical types found in the Caedmon MS. is only one problem. Many other problems confront us in the Aelfric and Egerton MSS. In the Aelfric MS. there is one illustration which agrees strikingly in composition and iconography with its counterpart in the Cotton Genesis tradition. This illustration is on fol. 27, after verses I2-17 of Genesis xv, and represents the content of these verses, Abraham asleep (verse 12), receiv- ing two visitations from God, the verbal message (verses I3-16) (Pl. 33a), illustrated by the manus dei stretched down towards him, and the vision of the smoking furnace (verse I9).9 In the Cotton Genesis verse I2 of Genesis xv concludes the text contained on the second of the detached Bristol leaves, while verses 13-17 are contained on the present fol. 22 of British Museum Cotton MS. Otho B. VI.10 Above the text of verse 13, on fol. 22, the left half of a miniature survives, showing Abraham asleep and the manus dei above his head (P1. 33b). Presumably the vision of the furnace was represented in the lost right upper portion of the miniature. The intimate connection between the Aelfric and Cotton Genesis versions of the scene is obvious at a glance. In both Abraham lies on a palliasse, with his head at the left of the picture-space. He rests his head on his right hand. The manus dei, un- naturally large in scale, descends vertically above the sleeping patriarch."11 It is unfortunate that the illustration on fol. 22 of the Cotton Genesis is the only record of how Genesis xv. I2-17, was represented in the late-Antique period. If the same scene had been illustrated among the fifth-century mosaics at Sta. Maria Maggiore12 or in the Greek Octateuch MSS., which though themselves of eleventh-, twelfth-, and thirteenth-century dates, preserve intact a late-Antique cycle,13 it would have been possible by comparing the Cotton Genesis version with a version belonging to a different recension of Genesis illustrations to specify what compositional or iconographical features were pls.

In the case of 'Abraham's vision of the furnace' this cannot be done. Although the close resemblance between the Aelfric and Cotton Genesis version proves that the Anglo-Saxon illustrator copied his picture from an earlier set of Genesis illustrations, it does not neces- sarily mean that his model was a manuscript of the Cotton Genesis type. The same difficulty arises in the case of the illustration on fol. 13 of the Aelfric MS., which represents the giants mentioned in verse 4 of Genesis vi (P1. 33c).14 This picture of the giants is strikingly like the picture of the giant son fol. 54b of the Octateuch MS. in the Seraglio at Constantinople (P1. 33f). But does it necessarily follow that the model used by the artist of the Aelfric MS. contained the cycle of illustrations belonging specifically to the tradition recorded in the Octateuchs? Unfortunately not. The beginning of verse 4 of Genesis vi, containing the reference to the giants, ended a leaf of the Cotton Genesis which was already missing when Grabe made his collation of the text.15 The following leaf was subsequently lost, in the disastrous Ashburnham House fire of 173I when the Cotton Genesis was reduced to its present ruined condition.16 It seems probable that this destroyed leaf had a picture of the giants on its recto, since even at the most generous estimate the text which it contained would only be sufficient to cover one side of the leaf.17 The fact that the Cotton Genesis may well have contained a picture of the giants detracts somewhat from the significance of the resem- blance between the versions of this subject in the Aelfric MS. and the Seraglio Octateuch. It is not easy to see how the illustrator of the Cotton Genesis could have designed a picture of the giants differing in any marked respect from the Octateuch version. Again it would seem that the artist of the Aelfric MS. based his illustration on an earlier model, but again it is not clear to what recension of Biblical illustrations that model belonged. We appear to be on rather surer ground in the case of an important icono- graphical feature which occurs not only in the Aelfric MS. but also in the Egerton MS. The Aelfric and Egerton MSS. agree in representing the three visitors whom Abraham entertains in the plain of Mamre (Genesis xviii) as men, one of whom is distinguished from his fellows by a cross nimbus, a divine attribute.18 In the mosaics at Sta. Maria Maggiore Abraham's visitors are men, and one of the three is distinguished by a mandorla.19 In Vatican cod. gr. 747, which Weitzmann takes to be the purest representative of the ancient cycle of illustrations recorded in the Octateuchs, Abraham's visitors are shown as men, one of whom, in the scene of the meal, has actually a cross nimbus.20 In the Cotton Genesis tradition, on the other hand, Abraham's 14 In the Vulgate this passage reads: "Gi- gantes autem erant super terram in diebus illis." 15 See H. Owen, Collatio codicis Cottoniani Geneseos cum editione Romana a viro clarissimo Joanne Ernesto Grabe jam olim facta, London, 1778, p. 4. 16 See the synopsis of contents in Gotch, op. cit., p. ix. 17 Gotch wrongly assumes that verses 4-I of Genesis vi were contained on this missing leaf. It cannot in fact have contained more than verses 4-7, since verses 8-1o must have appeared in the lost upper half of extant fol. 9. 18 B. M. Cotton MS. Claudius B. iv, fol. 29b and Egerton MS.

Woodruff, The</page><page sequence="6">176 GEORGE HENDERSON visitors are represented as winged angels, not as men.21 Thus the versions of the hospitality of Abraham in the Aelfric and Egerton MSS. would appear to reflect an old pictorial tradition quite opposed to that of the Cotton Genesis.22 This leads us to the difficult question of the kind of source material avail- able to the artist of the Egerton MS. Does his version of the hospitality of Abraham supply independent evidence about an ancient model employed three centuries before by the artist of the Aelfric MS., or is he merely copying the illustration in the Aelfric MS.? There is one illustration in the Egerton MS. which is worth considering in detail for the light which it sheds on this question as to whether we can rely with any confidence on the Egerton MS. for evidence of the existence of a body of late-Antique pictorial material in this country throughout the Middle Ages. This is the illustration of the 'Dream ofJacob' on fol. 15 of the Egerton MS. In it God is shown actually climbing up the ladder (P1. 33d). The normal posi- tion of God in illustrations of the dream of Jacob is floating above the ladder, bust-length in a segment of heaven, thus avoiding total anthropomorphism.23 The source of the unusual iconography of the Egerton version would seem cer- tainly to be the Aelfric MS. The artist of the Aelfric MS. had a definite penchant for representing God poised on a ladder. This motif was perhaps suggested to him by an illustration of Jacob's dream like the one on fol. 50 of Vatican cod. gr. 747, where the three nimbed angels climbing on the ladder have no wings.24 A wingless nimbed angel could easily be changed to the figure of God. But the motif of God on the ladder can also be explained by reference to the text of Genesis in three places, chapter xi at verse 5, chapter xvii at verse 22, and chapter xxviii at verses 12-13. In the Vulgate this last, which is the account of Jacob's dream, reads as follows: "Viditque in somnis scalam stantem super terram, et cacumen illius tangens caelum; angelos quoque dei ascendentes et descendentes per eamrn et dominum innixium scalae . ." Aelfric's Anglo-Saxon version keeps close to the Vulgate: ".... Godes englas upp stigende 7 nyber stigende on Iaere. 7 he geseah Drihten on ufeweardre paere hlaeddre ..."25 Here God is associated with a ladder.

Weitzmann, op. cit., p. 122, argues that the version in the Millstatt Genesis is connected with the Cotton Genesis tradition, but to demonstrate this connection he has to strip the Millstatt version of all its positive features. 23 For example on fol. 6 of the Lambeth Bible, reproduced in T.

The text of the Vulgate at Genesis xi. 5, referring to God's intervention at Babel, reads: "Descendit autem dominus . . ." The text of the Vulgate at Genesis xvii. 22, referring to God's departure after an interview with Abraham, reads: ". .. ascendit deus ab Abraham." At these points Aelfric's version reads: "Witodlice Drihten astah nyber . . ." and "God pa astah up fram Abra- hame . . ."26 The verbs used in the Vulgate and the Anglo-Saxon versions to describe God's coming and going coincide with the verbs used for the perambulations of the angels on the ladder in Genesis xxviii. 12. The artist of the Aelfric MS. puts God on the ladder along with the angels in his illustra- tion of Jacob's dream (P1. 33e), and also stations God on a ladder in his illustrations of the two other passages in the text where God is said to descend and ascend. In the illustration of Jacob's dream on fol. 15 of the Egerton MS., then, we find proof that the Egerton artist knew and copied the Aelfric MS. Where both manuscripts reproduce the same recognizably ancient motifs, as for example in their versions of the hospitality of Abraham, we cannot take it for granted that the Egerton artist provides independent testimony to the content of a late-Antique model. While we may suspect the existence of such a model in the Anglo-Saxon period, we cannot tell if it was still available in the four- teenth century. The general situation is further complicated by an extraordinary alteration which the Egerton artist makes to the type of God on the ladder borrowed from the Aelfric MS. In the Egerton MS. the figure of God has no head. Instead, a cross nimbus rests on His shoulders.27 In the illuminated initial to Psalm cix in an early thirteenth-century psalter in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge, MS. B. I I. 4, God the Father is represented with a cross nimbus occupying the place of His head.28 This motif is so impressive, and so uncommon in English mediaeval art, that a direct connection between the Trinity College Psalter and the Egerton MS. would have to be assumed, were it not that the omission of the heads of sacred personages is a recognized feature of a group of illuminated manuscripts standing strictly outside English, and also outside Christian mediaeval tradition. This group of manuscripts is Jewish. In a representation of God in the Hebrew Mahaz6r in the Bodleian Library the face is left blank.29 On fol. o of the Haggadah of Sarajevo Jacob's ladder is climbed by two angels who have wings where their heads should be.30 The omission of the head of God is not the only motif of Jewish origin to be found in the Egerton MS.31 And once we recognize the existence 26B. M. Cotton MS. Claudius B. IV, fols. i8b, 28b. See Crawford, op. cit., pp. I I, 127. 27James, op. cit., p. 34, assumes that it is merely the angle at which God's head is placed that produces this effect. God is, how- ever, set sideways on the ladder, like the angel on the lowest rungs of the ladder, whose head is seen in profile, and not like the angel im- mediately below God, whose back is turned to the spectator. 28 Reproduced in P.

One of the marked features of mediaeval Jewish iconography is its faithful retention of extremely archaic forms which if they cropped up in a mediaeval English manuscript might well lead us to assume direct contact with an early Christian source.32 It will be clear even from this brief survey of a limited (but, I think, fair and representative) selection of illustrations in the Caedmon, Aelfric, and Egerton MSS., that it is not at all easy to generalize about the type or types of late-Antique source material accessible to artists in this country in the Middle Ages. One means of imposing order upon the bewildering complexity of the English iconographical material is to establish the precise way in which an individual subject was represented in, say, the Cotton Genesis recension, and then to compare any version of the same subject in the English MSS. with that late-Antique version. I propose to deal in this way with three subjects, the 'Tower of Babel', the 'Disembarkation of Noah', and the 'Rescue of Lot from the Sodomites'. I have chosen these subjects because the nature of the evidence for establishing the specific content of the Cotton Genesis versions differs in each case. In the case of the 'Tower of Babel' both San Marco and the Cotton Genesis itself contribute direct pictorial evidence. In the case of the 'Disembarkation of Noah' San Marco alone provides direct pictorial evidence, and in the case of the 'Rescue of Lot' this evidence is provided by the Cotton Genesis alone. I. THE 'TOWER OF BABEL' (a) The Cotton Genesis Tradition: In order to avoid confusion between the Cotton Genesis tradition and the Cotton Genesis itself, I will refer to the head on top. Cf. the representation of Lot's wife on fol. I 9b of a I3th-century Hebrew Bible, B. M. Add MS. 11639, and on fol. 7 of the Haggadah of Sarajevo, reproduced in Miiller and von Schlosser, op. cit., II. Before the use by the Egerton artist of this type of Lot's wife, it had appeared in English art in a Psalter illustration by W. de Brailes, for which see H. Swarzenski, "Unknown Bible Pictures by W. de Brailes", The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 1938, fig. 4. Cf. the similar type of Lot's wife at Vienne, and in a I5th- century woodcut, reproduced in R. A. Koch, "The Sculpture of the Church of Saint- Maurice at Vienne, the Biblia Pauperum, and the Speculum Humanae Salvationis", Art Bulletin, June 1950, pp. 151-55, figs. 9 and Ii. In the version of the 'Disembarkation of Noah' on fol. 4 of the Egerton MS., for which see text, one of Noah's sons lowers a sheep by its hind legs over the edge of the hull of the Ark. Cf. the figure lowering a sheep from a tower in the illustration of the fifth plague of Egypt on fol. I2b of a Jewish Haggadah, B. M. Add. MS. 27210. It is also possible, perhaps, that some connection exists between the back- turned figure of Abraham with flowing hair in the illustration of Abraham going to sacri- fice Isaac on fol. 12 of the Egerton MS. and Jewish representations of the 'Sacrifice of Isaac' where Abraham's back is turned and his face hidden. See Leveen, op. cit., pl. V, 2 and p. 23 and n. 4, P. 23- 32 For the existence from early times of a consistent body of Jewish pictorial material, see Leveen, op. cit., pp. 123-25. For the preservation in mediaeval Jewish iconography of ancient types, cf. the 'Creation' scenes on fols. I and 2 of the Haggadah of Sarajevo with the illustrations of the 'Creation' in the Greek Octateuchs, for which see Uspensky, op. cit., pls. IX, X, I1-22.

XV, 51.</page><page sequence="9">LATE-ANTIQUE INFLUENCES IN SOME ILLUSTRATIONS OF GENESIS 179 manuscript as D, the letter by which its version of the Septuagint text is known to textual scholars. To estimate accurately the relationship of the Cotton Genesis tradition to our mediaeval English representations of the tower of Babel, it is of course essential to know the specific iconographical content of the Cotton Genesis tradition. At San Marco, Venice, there are two mosaics representing the tower of Babel (P1. 34a). It is natural to assume that the Cotton Genesis tradition is defined by these two mosaics. But are they, in fact, reliable records of that tradition? This fundamental question arises when the two San Marco mosaics are compared with the fragmentary remains not of two, but of three, miniatures in D. In the first of the San Marco scenes the tower is being built by a large company of workmen, who are shown preparing mortar, climbing ladders, and laying bricks. Above the very tall tower God and His angels, enclosed in a segment of heaven, look down on the work. In the second scene the work has been abandoned. God and His angels are now suspended in the air in front of the tower, as if in the act of descending to the earth, while the children of men are shown dispersing in four groups, two groups being arranged one above the other on each side of the tower. Now consider the evidence of D. The account of the building and aban- donment of the tower of Babel is contained in Genesis xi, I-9. The surviving fragment of fol. 14 of D contains four lines of text, from verses 4-5 of Genesis xi, followed by the upper left quarter of a miniature.33 Verse 4 refers to the plan to build the tower, verse 5 refers to God coming.to see the tower. The miniature following these verses should correspond to the first mosaic of the 'Tower of Babel' at San Marco. In part, it does correspond to it. The minia- ture consists mainly of blue sky, but at the top right-hand side is the beginning of the curved segment of heaven which at San Marco contains God and His angels watching the building of the tower, and at what is now the bottom of the miniature a partially visible figure corresponds to the stooping workman who appears near the top of the tower at San Marco. These points of agreement with the San Marco mosaic only serve to emphasize the dissimilarity of the two compositions. In D nearly half of the available space was used up before the figure of the stooping workman was reached. Below him the miniature extended for the equivalent of only twelve lines of text. Therefore the tower of Babel on fol. 14 of D can have been only about half the height of the tower at San Marco, and the miniature cannot have included the large number of figures or the quantity of genre detail found at San Marco. 33 Grabe's collation of the text of D records the loss of a leaf containing the text of Genesis from verse 13 of chapter x up to almost the end of verse 4 of chapter xi; see Owen, op. cit., p. 9. The text written on the recto of the fragmentary leaf now numbered as fol. 14 begins where the missing leaf left off, so that it is clear that the surviving fragment of fol. 14 represents part of the top of a leaf. For the text on fol. 14, see Tischendorf, op. cit., p. o101. Since there is no break in sense between the text on the recto and the text on the verso, it follows that there was no more text on the recto below the miniature, that is, the minia- ture must have occupied all the remaining space, equivalent to 24 lines of text. What survives occupies the equivalent of only 12 lines of text, and it is also torn away at rather less than half the original width.</page><page sequence="10">I80 GEORGE HENDERSON On fol. I4b of D are the remains of seven lines of text, followed by part of a miniature. This miniature must originally have been smaller than the one on the recto, since it occupied the equivalent of only twenty-one lines of text. The text which it illustrates comprises verses 6-7 of Genesis xi, which say that God resolved to confound the language of the builders of the tower. The surviving fragment of the miniature consists entirely of blue sky, so that sky must originally have occupied a considerable part of the picture- space. Any representation of the tower on fol. I4b must have shown it as even smaller than the tower on fol. 14. Judging from the position of the miniature in the text it seems likely that it showed God descending to put a stop to the work. It is quite possible that the group of God and His angels in front of the tower at San Marco is derived from a composition like the one originally on fol. I4b of D, but it is certain that the San Marco version of the abandonment of the work cannot be taken as a whole to represent the authentic Cotton Genesis tradition on this point, since the San Marco version includes the scattering of the children of men, a subject illustrated separately in yet another miniature in D. This miniature appears on fol. 15. Only part of two figures, lacking heads, survives at the left of a small portion of the tower of Babel. These figures agree with the dispersing crowd at the bottom left of the tower in the San Marco mosaic. Fortunately more of the miniature than is now extant is recorded in an engraving published in the 1747 volume of Vetusta Monumenta. The miniature occupied the equivalent of twenty-six lines of text, since it has only two lines written above it. The full extent of the tower is shown in the engraving (P1. 34b). It is a short and evidently narrow structure, confirming the small scale of the tower in the other two miniatures in D. On top of the tower there is a large bust-length figure of a man, leaning out over the edge with one arm outstretched, as if addressing the dispersing crowds from a tall pulpit. This man is not recorded at San Marco. If we assume that the archetype of the San Marco mosaics was either D itself or a source substantially like D, it follows that the mosaicist has con- siderably modified the authentic Cotton Genesis tradition. He has conflated D's second and third scenes. He has removed the mysterious gesticulating figure from the top of the tower in the scene of the dispersion, and has dupli- cated the dispersing groups of figures on either side of the tower. He has greatly heightened the tower in both his scenes, and in the scene of the building of the tower has added many figures of workmen and genre details such as the long ladders, for which there was no room in D. These differences between San Marco and D can reasonably be accounted for by the special circum- stances of San Marco, the smaller number and greater size of the spaces avail- able for representations of the tower of Babel. This discovery that in the 'Babel' scenes San Marco represents a considerably modified version of the Cotton Genesis tradition proves the importance of consulting D wherever possible. D must naturally be regarded as our standard for the authentic Cotton Genesis tradition. (b) The Caedmon MS.: I will now turn to the English material.

God stands in the top left corner, addressing four men, two of whom turn towards Him, while the other two gaze towards the right. Below God and this first group of the children of men are two other groups, moving left and right, separated from one another by jagged ground-lines, and below these two groups is a fourth group of figures, whose feet touch the bottom frame. This fourth group moves towards a building in the right bottom corner of the picture-space. Above this building is the tower of Babel, standing on its own jagged ground-line. It is a small narrow structure. A man, visible to the thighs, occupies the top of the tower, stretching his arms out to the right and holding an axe. At a lower level a second man leans out from behind the tower, holding a pick. Three features of this drawing are of particular interest. The small scale and narrowness of the tower, retained despite the architectural elaboration of its fabric, is untypical of mediaeval representations and agrees with the tradi- tion of D. The figure of the man with outstretched arms on top of the tower also agrees with a peculiar feature of the miniature in D illustrating the dispersion. The axe held by this man in the Caedmon version may perhaps be regarded as an attempt to rationalize the function of the gesticulating figure on the tower, which is obscure in the miniature in D. The two compact groups of the children of men, moving left and right on a level with the base of the tower agree with the two groups at the foot of the tower in D. The duplication in the Caedmon drawing of the authentic two groups, paralleling the modifi- cation later found at San Marco, is justified by the text of the Anglo-Saxon Genesis, which speaks of the sons of men scattered in four ways in search of land. Although read as a whole the Caedmon drawing is very far from being a pure representative of the Cotton Genesis tradition, it does nevertheless appear to contain quite specific references to Cotton Genesis iconography. (c) The Aelfric MS.: The same cannot be said of the illustration of the build- ing of the tower of Babel on fol. 19 of the Aelfric MS. (P1. 34d). The large broad-based tower is swarming with workmen, who hammer door-fittings and roof-tiles, hoist up, and lean down for, loads of brick, and ascend a ladder propped against the right side of the tower. A second, longer ladder, inclined towards the tower at the left, is occupied not by workmen but by God, at whose shoulder an angel is hovering. Bands of cloud stretch across the top of the picture-space. If the representation of the 'Building of the Tower of Babel' at San Marco had proved to be an authentic record of the Cotton Genesis tradition, then we would of course be able to connect the Aelfric version of the scene very closely with that tradition. But precisely those features in which the Aelfric version corresponds to the San Marco version, the large number of workmen, their varied activities, the high ladders against the sides of the tower, and the grand scale of the tower itself, are, as I have pointed out, alien to the authentic tradition represented in D. The resemblance between the Aelfric and San Marco versions of the 'Building of the Tower of Babel' is perhaps the result of their dependence on mature Italo-Byzantine tradition, represented for example in the twelfth-century Sicilian mosaics.34 34 See O. Demus, The Mosaics of Norman Sicily, London, 1950, pls. 32B, 102.</page><page sequence="13">182 GEORGE HENDERSON (d) The Egerton MS.: In the Egerton MS. the tower of Babel is shown twice, once under construction, once abandoned, as at San Marco (Pls. 34e and f). The first illustration, on fol. 5b, is full of genre detail and agrees very well with the scene of the building of the tower at San Marco. Such features as the great height of the tower, and the ladders against its sides, ascended by workmen carrying loads of bricks, come particularly close to the San Marco version. In the second scene, on fol. 6, the children of men are not shown dispersing, as they are at San Marco. The crumbling tower stands quite alone in the picture- space, which occupies the left half of the page. However, in the right half of the page there are two compartments, the upper one containing a crowd of figures representing the descendants of Shem, and the lower one containing figures identified by inscriptions as Abraham, Nahor, Haram, Iscah, and Lot. All these people appear in the genealogical list which immediately succeeds the account of the dispersion of the children of men in Genesis xi. The dis- persing children of men at the right of the tower at San Marco are arranged in two compact groups, one above the other. If we disregard the frames separating the right-hand compartments on fol. 6 of the Egerton MS. from one another and on the tower of Babel, a marked resemblance in layout between the Egerton illustration and the San Marco mosaic of the dispersion becomes apparent.35 On fol. 5b of the Egerton MS. God and His angels are not, as they are at San Marco, looking down from the tower. They appear instead in the second illustration of the tower, on fol. 6. Whereas in the second scene at San Marco, God and His angels are apparently descending to earth in front of the tower, in the Egerton MS. they remain up above in the clouds, but interrupt the work violently by blowing down the top of the tower. A shower of bricks is falling at the right of the tower. At San Marco the tower is not destroyed but simply left incomplete, which agrees with the text of the Vulgate inscribed above the mosaic of the derelict tower: ". . . et cessaverunt aedificare civi- tatem". The idea that God confounded the tower along with the language of its builders, which has left its mark on the iconography of the Egerton MS., is alien to the Cotton Genesis tradition but does occur in a very different tradition, that recorded in the Octateuchs, where the tower collapses, crush- ing the masons.36 There is, however, no need to seek for a pictorial source for the falling tower in the Egerton MS. The source of this image is ultimately the Historia Scholastica, where we read: ". .. Dii vero ventos immittentes everterunt turrim ..3."3 The precise content of the text being illustrated by the Egerton artist results in his use of pictorial motifs not found at San Marco. None the less, the resemblance of the illustrations on fols. 5b and 6 of the Egerton MS. to the two San Marco mosaics of the 'Tower of Babel' is very striking. This resem- blance does not warrant the conclusion that the illustrations in the Egerton MS. were derived independently from a Cotton Genesis-type source. Rather 35 It should however be noted that the Octateuch tradition represents two super- imposed groups of the children of men in separate framed compartments on either side of the collapsing tower of Babel. 36 See, for example, fol. 65b of the Seraglio Octateuch, reproduced in Uspensky, op. cit., pl. XIV, 43. 3 See James, op. cit.</page><page sequence="14">LATE-ANTIQUE INFLUENCES IN SOME ILLUSTRATIONS OF GENESIS 183 it suggests that the Egerton artist knew the San Marco mosaics. The features in which the Egerton scenes correspond with those at San Marco, the pair of tall towers, the wealth of genre detail in the first scene, the superimposed groups of figures at the right of the derelict tower in the second scene, are the peculiar characteristics of the mosaics and are additions to and modifications of the authentic Cotton Genesis tradition as recorded in D. II. THE CDISEMBARKATION OF NOAH' (a) The Cotton Genesis Tradition: The 'Disembarkation' at San Marco is a large composition, twice the height of the other scenes illustrating the history of the Flood (P1. 35a). Animals, newly released from the Ark, run about the rocky ground at the base of the composition. The ground swells up into three pinnacles of rock, the two tallest of which support the box-shaped Ark at its extreme ends, at the left and right. The rest of the Ark is unsupported, suspended like a bridge across a ravine. Noah is engaged in releasing the animals. To the left of Noah the members of his family, the men in front, the women partially visible behind, stand in a row, facing forward. None of the figures has any ground to stand on. They are suspended above the ravine on a level with the Ark, as if on an invisible platform. At the top of the picture- space a rainbow sweeps over the heads of Noah and his family, and cuts off the top corners of the Ark. The account of the disembarkation of Noah is given in Genesis viii. 15-19. In D a large section of the text, between Genesis viii. 9 (end of fol. 12b) and ix. 15 (beginning of fol. 13), along with the accompanying illustrations, has been lost. Thus we cannot obtain from D any direct evidence about the pictorial content of the authentic Cotton Genesis tradition of the 'Disembarkation'. Important indirect evidence can however be obtained by inquiring how the text was distributed on the missing leaves, and by comparing the San Marco 'Disembarkation' with a similar composition on fol. Iob of D. By analysing the evidence of Grabe's collation of the text of D, it becomes clear that there must once have been a full-page illustration of the 'Disembarkation'.38 Only one other individual scene from the history of Noah was allowed a full-page miniature in D, namely the scene on extant fol. iob, probably representing 38 The contents of the recto of a leaf which originally followed extant fol. 12 are recorded in an engraving in Vetusta Monumenta, pl. LXVII, X. The recto contained verses Io-Ii of Genesis viii. We know from Grabe's colla- tion that a leaf containing verses 20-21 was already missing before the fire of 1731, see Owen, op. cit., p. 7. It follows that the un- recorded verso of the Vetusta Monumenta leaf, unrecorded because it consisted of unillus- trated text (presumably 28 lines), contained verses i2-19, that is, the passage in which Noah's disembarkation is described. We would expect an illustration of the disem- barkation to have occurred on the recto of the immediately succeeding leaf, that is, on the leaf whose loss is noted by Grabe. This leaf contained only a brief portion of text, which as written out by the scribe of D can only have amounted to some I lines. Assuming a 28-line page, there will have been space for one full-page illustration and one illustration equivalent to 17 lines of writing. Since verses 20-21 describe the sacrifice offered by Noah after his release from the Ark, we may take it that these verses were written out at the top of the verso of the missing leaf and that they were followed by a miniature representing the 'Sacrifice of Noah' corresponding to the San Marco version of this subject. The full- page miniature will have been on the recto, and will have illustrated the 'Disembarka- tion'.</page><page sequence="15">184 GEORGE HENDERSON God ordering Noah to embark. This scene is omitted from the San Marco cycle. Thanks to the collation we are able to confirm that the unusual size of the San Marco mosaic of the 'Disembarkation' reflects the authentic Cotton Genesis tradition. The 'Disembarkation' is the only one of the San Marco 'Noah' scenes whose counterpart in D was a full-page miniature. Apart from the question of the overall size of the composition, D provides evidence about two of the internal features of the San Marco 'Disembarkation'. These features are the rainbow, and the gap between the rocky landscape and the Ark. Regarded generally, the illustrations of Genesis belonging to the Cotton Genesis tradition tend towards the literal illustration of specific verses and keep carefully to the order of events set out in the scriptural narrative. The large number of illustrations allowed to each chapter precludes, as a rule, the sort of pictorial conflation of incidents which was the common practice in mediaeval Biblical illustration. The presence of the rainbow in the San Marco mosaics of the 'Disembarkation' is therefore puzzling. The rainbow, the token of God's covenant with Noah, is not referred to until Genesis ix. 13-16, whereas the account of the disembarkation is contained in Genesis viii. 15- 9. Thus the San Marco mosaic combines two subjects which in the text of Genesis are set widely apart, and which the nature of the Cotton Genesis tradition would lead us to expect to have been illustrated separately. On this question the evidence of the collation is especially valuable. The proportion of text to pages indicated by the collation together with surviving portions of the manuscript suggests that after the miniature of Noah's sacrifice, illustrating Genesis viii. 20-21, no further illustrations can have been inserted in the text of D before extant fol. 13, which contains a miniature illustrating the story of the drunkenness of Noah narrated in Genesis ix. 20-23. 9 So if the illustrator 39 Between the leaf containing Genesis viii, 20-21, whose loss was noted by Grabe, and extant fol. 13, 15 complete verses, together with the end of verse 2I of Genesis viii and the beginning of verse 15 of ix, were destroyed in the fire of 1731. If we count the number of letters contained in this portion of the Septua- gint text, and allow an average of 28 letters to a line, we obtain an estimate of 54 missing lines, just two short of the number required for two complete text pages. The sense of the missing portion of text must be noted. In verses 21-22 of Genesis viii God vows that He will never again destroy mankind; in verses 1-3 of ix God blesses Noah and his sons, and gives them dominion over the earth; in verses 4-6 God forbids the shedding of blood; in verses 7-12 God announces that He will establish a covenant with Noah and his sons; in verses 13-15 the rainbow is set in the cloud as a token of this covenant. Extant fol. 13 con- tains the end of verse 15 and verses I6-23 of Genesis ix. For the text on fol. 13, see Tischendorf, op. cit., p. IoI. The rainbow is still being spoken about in verses 16 and 17. Fol. I3 is entirely occupied by text, and fol. I3b by a miniature, divided into two compartments, illustrating the drunkenness of Noah. If the missing portion of the text between Genesis viii, 21 and ix. 15 was illus- trated, it cannot have contained more than two illustrations, since the content of the verses yields at most two subjects capable of illustration, namely God blessing Noah and his sons, and the rainbow set in the cloud. Assuming the existence of a maximum of two illustrations, how were they related to the text? We have to imagine two lost leaves, each with a full page of text and a full-page miniature. A miniature of the rainbow would have to be placed on the verso of the second missing leaf, since only thus could it be close enough to the text which it illustrated, part of which appears on extant fol. 13. The scene of God blessing Noah and his sons would then appear on the verso of the first missing leaf. But this is an unsatisfactory reconstruction of the missing portion of D. Full-page minia-</page><page sequence="16">LATE-ANTIQUE INFLUENCES IN SOME ILLUSTRATIONS OF GENESIS 185 of D wished to make any pictorial reference to the important subject of the rainbow he could only have done so by inserting it into the 'Disembarkation' miniature. This fact is sufficient confirmation of the authenticity of the rain- bow in the San Marco mosaic. The authenticity of the curious gap between the Ark and Noah's family in all the upper part of the San Marco composition, and the elaborate rocky landscape below, seems more doubtful. D provides some indirect pictorial evidence tending to conflict with San Marco. On fol. Iob of D is part of a full-page miniature, probably representing God ordering Noah to embark.40 Only the right half of the miniature survives. Part of the Ark is seen at the top. Reading down the page the Ark occupies the equivalent of fourteen lines of writing. The Ark rests on the ground, which fills the remaining picture- space, equivalent in height to ten lines. There are traces of a figure standing in the lower part of the miniature. This composition, with the Ark above and the ground below, is very similar to that of the San Marco disembarkation. This miniature is admittedly fragmentary and badly rubbed. But its scale alone makes it improbable that the landscape in the lower part was treated in anything but a quite general way. The San Marco 'Disembarkation' was presumably modelled on a miniature similar in scale and finish to the sur- viving miniature on fol. Iob of D, and judging by that standard, it seems a necessary conclusion that the mosaicist has gone far beyond the possible scope of his model in his detailed description of the rocky landscape below the Ark. On fol. Iob of D the ground meets the Ark and supports it. This ought to happen also in the San Marco 'Disembarkation'. The position of Noah and his family in the San Marco 'Disembarkation' only makes sense if they were originally intended to rest their feet on solid ground. The gap which opens beneath their feet introduces a violently irrational element into the composi- tion, alien to the naturalistic treatment of space customary in D. The gap must surely be a modification of the original composition introduced by the thirteenth-century mosaicist. He did not, however, invent but merely bor- rowed the picturesque motif of the gap. In the twelfth-century mosaics of 'Noah's Disembarkation' at Palermo and Monreale the hull of the Ark is supported at prow and stern by a rock or hillock, so that in the middle it hangs clear of the ground, spanning a valley, just as at San Marco. The gap below the Ark is therefore presumably an Italo-Byzantine motif, introduced at San Marco to add interest and variety to the lower part of the composition, but hopelessly at odds with the old disposition of Noah and his family copied directly from the Cotton Genesis archetype. tures occur infrequently in D. Three full- page miniatures in succession, counting the miniature on fol. 13b, would be exceptional. Furthermore it would seem much more natural to make a single illustration out of the intimately related subjects of God's blessing and the rainbow, as for example on fol. III of the Vienna Genesis, reproduced in F. Wick- hoff, Die Wiener Genesis, Vienna, 1895, pl. 6, where Noah and his sons see the blessing hand of God in the sky as well as the rainbow. Yet a single illustration cannot be reconciled with the amount of text to be accommodated in the missing portion of D. The only alterna- tive to two illustrations is no illustration at all. In that case a single leaf, entirely given over to text, would be missing between Grabe's lost folio and extant fol. 13, and D would have afforded no space for a separate illustration of the rainbow. 40 Reproduced in Weitzmann, Die Illustra- tion der Septuaginta, pl.

On page 73 of the Caedmon MS. are twelve lines of text. God tells Noah that the Flood is passed, and commands him to disembark. Noah leads his family and the animals out of the Ark. In the lower portion of the page is an unframed drawing of the 'Disembarka- tion' (P1. 36a). This drawing contains many curious features. Looking at it, we might suspect that the second of the two artists responsible for the illustra- tions in the Caedmon MS., who at this point takes over from the first artist,41 has copied his illustration from a model which he did not fully understand. The lower part of the Ark recalls the incomplete structure of the Ark on page 65 of the Caedmon MS., drawn by the first artist, but the upper part of the Ark is humped, so that the whole vessel resembles a huge lemon. The second artist may have referred to the drawing on page 65 for help in interpreting an obscure model. There are two clear indications that this model was a miniature belonging to the Cotton Genesis tradition. The first feature which indicates the influence of the Cotton Genesis tradition is the position and shape of the doorway of the Ark. On page 73 the doorway is a small rectangular opening placed high up on the front of the Ark, with a door which swings out towards the left. This exactly corresponds to the doorways of the Arks in the San Marco mosaics and in D. Even more significant, the surface of the Ark on page 73 is ornamented with a panel-work of squares, each square being divided into four triangles. The ornamentation of the Ark with an all-over geometrical pattern at once recalls the peculiar, specifically late-Antique, treatment of the Ark in two consecutive miniatures from D, recorded in the engraving in Vetusta Monumenta of the recto of the leaf which originally followed extant fol. 12. The ornamentation of the Caedmon Ark is particularly close to that of the Ark in the second miniature, which is a very complex pattern of hori- zontals and diamonds, some of them blocked in.42 There is, incidentally, no trace of this kind of surface decoration in the Arks at San Marco. The position and shape of the doorway and the ornamentation of the Ark on page 73 of the Caedmon MS. agree so well with known features of the Cotton Genesis tradition that we may be justified in pressing the comparison still further. In the scene of 'Disembarkation' at San Marco Noah's sons are represented standing in front of the Ark at full length. The women of the family are grouped in between and behind the men so that only their heads and shoulders are visible. If we assume that the Anglo-Saxon artist was attempting to copy a picture like the San Marco 'Disembarkation', then one of the most curious features of his drawing becomes more intelligible. The bodiless row of female heads in the region of the doorway of the Ark will have been displaced from in between the full-length figures of the sons of Noah, in an attempt to simplify the row of figures standing outside the Ark. In the 'Disembarkation' scene at San Marco the rainbow curves across the top of the Arc, cutting off the upper corners of the roof. A similar rainbow will have appeared in D. We might tentatively suggest that the extraordinary 41 See Gollancz, op. cit., pp. xix, xlv. 42 See note 38. For a discussion of an alternative ornamentation of the Ark in D, see W. R.

The bands of colour in the rainbow would then be represented by the inner lines which follow the contours of the Anglo-Saxon Ark. In the 'Disembarkation' in the Caedmon MS. the Ark is supported on a level terrain, and Noah and his sons walk on this terrain in front of the Ark. If the Caedmon 'Disembarkation' was copied from a Cotton Genesis-type miniature, this feature would tend to confirm my suspicion that in the authentic Cotton Genesis tradition the whole of the Ark, and Noah's family, was supported on solid ground. (c) The Aelfric MS.: The upper third of fol. I5b of the Aelfric MS. is occu- pied by the text of Genesis viii. I o-8, the sense of which is as follows: Noah sends out the second dove, which returns bearing the olive leaf. Noah sends out the third dove, which does not return. Noah removes the cover of the Ark and looks out. God commands him to disembark with his family and the animals. He does so.43 The lower two-thirds of the page are occupied by a picture (P1. 35c). Across the bottom is a band of rock, which rises up at the centre to form a short pinnacle, and at the extreme right and left rises to form very tall narrow pinnacles on which the Ark is precariously balanced, high above the ground-line. Noah's family stands in a row on the left half of the ground-line, and a crowd of beasts, in pairs, stands on the right half of the ground-line, facing left. Large birds, also in pairs, fly out of the Ark in both directions, over the heads of the people and the beasts. The Ark is of a type common to the Aelfric and Caedmon MSS., with the hull of a Viking ship and a stepped superstructure. Noah is shown to the waist in the upper storey of the Ark, looking out and raising two narrow planks jointed together, representing the covering of the Ark. To the left of Noah the second dove is shown flying back with the branch in its beak. At the right of Noah God stands on one of the steps of the superstructure of the Ark, addressing Noah. The general composition of the Aelfric 'Disembarkation' is strikingly like the San Marco version, with the Ark suspended on two high pinnacles of rock over a great gap, with a third shorter pinnacle rising up at the middle of the lower half of the picture-space. It must be observed, however, that in all other respects the iconography of the Aelfric version of the 'Disembarkation' disagrees with San Marco. The Aelfric version shows the return of the dove with the branch, Noah opening the cover of the Ark, and God speaking to Noah, none of which appear in the San Marco 'Disembarkation'. The Ark in the Aelfric version bears no resem- blance to the box-shaped Arks of San Marco and D. The rainbow is not included in the Aelfric version of the 'Disembarkation', but instead is made the subject of an independent illustration on fol. I6b (P1. 35b), a clear sign that some relationship exists between the Aelfric cycle and the cycle of illus- trations recorded in the Octateuchs, where a very similar composition repre- senting Noah and his sons beneath the arch of the rainbow is to be found.44 43 For the Anglo-Saxon text, see Crawford, op. cit., pp. 104-05. 44 See e.g. fol. 62 of the Seraglio Octateuch, reproduced in Uspensky, op. cit., pl. XIII, 39.</page><page sequence="20">188 GEORGE HENDERSON In the Aelfric 'Disembarkation' the beasts do not run about in various direc- tions all over a broad landscape, but are kept to the very base of the picture and walk in pairs in procession, a feature of the 'Disembarkation' in the Vienna Genesis.45 Noah's family also is placed on the low ground-line at the base of the composition, instead of high up on a level with the Ark, as at San Marco. Only the position of the Ark, supported at each end on pinnacles of rock over a ravine atthe centre of which a lesser pinnacle rises, connects the Aelfric 'Disembarkation' with the version at San Marco. I have suggested that this feature of the San Marco version is suspect. It may perhaps be an interpola- tion by the mosaicist, under the influence of fully evolved Italo-Byzantine tradition. The common factor in the Aelfric and San Marco 'Disembarkations' would then have a Byzantine origin, and from this it might follow that the Aelfric version, lacking as it does any other features which can conceivably be connected with the Cotton Genesis tradition, was derived in its entirety from a Byzantine source. (d) The Egerton MS. : On fol. 4 of the Egerton MS. there is a full-page illustra- tion of the 'Disembarkation' (PI. 35e). The Ark rests on a hillock near the top of the picture-space. Noah looks out of a window and gazes up at God who leans out of a cloud at the top left corner of the picture. The rainbow crosses the gap between the Ark and the left-hand frame of the picture. Three youths are represented clambering out of the Ark, and another youth lowers a sheep to the ground over the edge of the hull. A dragon flies out of the Ark at the left, towards a group of long-stemmed trees which grow up at the left of the hillock. Various animals disport themselves on the slopes of the hillock in the lower half of the picture. It has been suggested that this version of the 'Disembarkation' "finds an astonishingly close parallel in the mosaics of S. Marco in Venice".46 The similarity is indeed very striking, and the reader may well feel that no further inquiry into the source of inspiration of the Egerton artist is needed. There are, however, a number of points which it may be worth making. First, the position of the rainbow: I have shown that it is probably an essential charac- teristic of the Cotton Genesis tradition that the rainbow is represented in the 'Disembarkation' scene. But judging from the San Marco mosaic it would also seem to be an essential part of that tradition that the rainbow cuts across the front of the Ark, enclosing the Ark in its arch. The rainbow in the Egerton MS. curves away from the Ark at its left side. The best parallel for this position of the rainbow is found in the mosaic at Palermo, which contains a number of different incidents in the history of the Flood conflated, the raven eating carrion, God instructing Noah to leave the Ark, the disembarkation of the animals, and God's covenant symbolized by the rainbow curving away from the Ark at the right-hand side of the picture-space. Since the Egerton In the Octateuchs Noah stands alone on one side of the picture-space, facing his sons grouped at the other side, with a gap in between. In the Aelfric version this general composition recurs, but the single figure facing the group has become God. "5 Fol. IIb, reproduced in Wickhoff, op. cit., pl. 5- 46 See Pacht, "A Giottesque Episode", p. 62.</page><page sequence="21">LATE-ANTIQUE INFLUENCES IN SOME ILLUSTRATIONS OF GENESIS 189 version shows the rainbow curving away from the Ark at one side, not en- circling the Ark, the connections of the Egerton version will be with the Palermo type as opposed to the San Marco, Cotton Genesis, type. This is confirmed by the fact that God appears in the Egerton version, instructing Noah, who looks up at Him from a window in the Ark, exactly like Noah at Palermo. The Egerton 'Disembarkation' is not a 'Disembarkation' of the special late-Antique Cotton Genesis type, but a mediaeval combination of three subjects, 'Noah ordered to leave the Ark', the 'Disembarkation' and the 'Covenant'. The figures of Noah's sons clambering out of the Ark are not found in the Cotton Genesis tradition. They have their best parallel in the other Sicilian cycle of mosaics, at Monreale. In the Monreale 'Disembarkation' Noah and one of his sons step out of the Ark. Noah has one leg over the hull of the Ark, like one of the figures in the Egerton MS. Noah stretches down towards a lion which he has evidently just deposited on the ground, and his son stoops over a sheep, helping it to go down a ladder. In the Egerton MS. one of Noah's sons is dropping a sheep over the side of the Ark. Palermo and Monreale offer better parallels than San Marco for certain aspects of the Egerton 'Disembarkation'. But what of the composition as a whole? I would like to suggest that the version of the embarkation in Queen Mary's Psalter is worth consideration as a possible alternative to the San Marco version47 (P1. 35d). It shows the Ark resting on top of a hill in the upper half of the picture-space, and rather to one side, just where the Ark is situated in the Egerton 'Disembarkation'. The short deep hull of the Egerton Ark is remarkably like that of the Queen Mary's Psalter Ark. In Queen Mary's Psalter a tree grows up at the left of the hull, exactly where the trees grow in the Egerton MS. The lower half of the picture-space is occupied by a large area of ground on which animals are playing, just as in the Egerton MS. A lion appears at the bottom left corner and at the bottom right corner is a doe lying down. A lion and a bull lying down appear in the bottom left and right corners of the Egerton 'Disembarkation'. In Queen Mary's Psalter one of the animals on the hill-side is a dragon. A dragon flies out of the Ark in the Egerton MS. The boy clambering down from the Ark beside the dragon in the Egerton MS. agrees in general posture and proximity to the Ark with the figure of Noah on the ladder in Queen Mary's Psalter. All these similari- ties make it probable, I believe, that the 'Disembarkation' in the Egerton MS. is a free adaptation of an earlier English model, the picture of the 'Embarka- tion' in Queen Mary's Psalter.48 47 B. M. Royal MS. 2. B. vii, fol. 6b. For this MS. see Sir G. Warner, Queen Mary's Psalter, London, 1912. 48 The immediate sources of inspiration of the Queen Mary's Psalter artist would also appear to be English, namely the sculptured relief of 'Noah entering the Ark' at Salisbury Cathedral Chapter-House, reproduced in A. Gardner, English Mediaeval Sculpture, Cam- bridge, 1951, fig. 206, where we find a prece- dent for the motif of the head of Noah thrust out of sight into the interior of the Ark, and also the picture on fol. 7b of the Holkham Bible, reproduced in W. O. Hassall, The Holkham Bible Picture-Book, London, I954- This contains two representations of the Ark, one above the other, the upper Ark resting on a hillock and the one below framed by the hillock and approached by Noah up a short ladder. By omitting the lower of the two Holkham Bible Arks and running the im- mensely long ladder (an awkward feature 3</page><page sequence="22">190 GEORGE HENDERSON The Egerton 'Disembarkation', therefore, appears to show signs of in- debtedness to some source akin to the twelfth-century Sicilian mosaics, and also to earlier fourteenth-century English iconographical tradition,49 rather than to the Cotton Genesis tradition. III. THE RESCUE OF LOT FROM THE SODOMITES (a) The Cotton Genesis Tradition: The San Marco mosaics illustrate the history of Abraham but omit the later history of Lot recorded in Genesis xix. The only source of information about the Cotton Genesis pictorial tradition at this point in the Genesis narrative is D itself. Fortunately D is unusually complete at this point.50 The fourth of the leaves from D formerly at Bristol, now restored to the British Museum, contains the text of Genesis xix, verses 4-Io on the recto and verse i i on the verso, followed by a miniature. The sense of these verses is: the men of Sodom surround Lot's house. They order Lot to hand over his guests so that they may abuse them. Lot goes out to reason with the mob, and makes a verbal offer of his daughters as substitutes for his guests. He is attacked by the mob, and is pulled back into his house by the angels who strike the Sodomites blind.51 The miniature on Bristol fol. IIIIb is a literal illustration of the content of verses io-II.52 In the Old Latin version these verses read as follows: "Extendentes autem viri manus adtraxerunt Lot ad se in domum et ostium domus cluserunt. Viros autem qui erant ad ostium domus percusserunt orbitate a minimo usque ad maximum et defecerunt quaerentes ostium." In the miniature the crowd of Sodomites is seen at the right. Two of them at the front of the crowd reel backwards and throw up their right arms as if to shield themselves as blindness strikes them. Two others have fallen down in the foreground. Lot stands at the left of the crowd. His head is turned in profile towards the Sodomites but his body is seen from in front. His right arm is bent and raised towards the left, and has been seized at the wrist by one of the angels. The engraving of this miniature in Vetusta Monumenta preserves more of the left part of the composition than is now extant (P1. 36d). It is clear from the engraving that two hands, a left hand and a right hand, belonging to one of the angels, were thrust out of a doorway at the left. The which shows poor editing of his source by the artist) up to meet the upper Ark, the Queen Mary's Psalter artist exposes the whole of the hillock, and changes it from a mere device to accommodate two distinct subjects in one uni- fied picture-space into an essential, properly iconographical, feature of the composition. The curious motif of Noah and the members of his family carrying the animals into the Ark on their backs, which occurs in the Eger- ton MS., provides further evidence of the close relationship of the Egerton MS. to the earlier Queen Mary's Psalter (where Noah carries one of his sons on his back) and the Holkham Bible (where Noah carries animals in a basket on his back). 49 But great caution must be exercised here, in view of the contrary opinion of Pacht, op. cit., p. 6o. 50 The only leaf containing text of Genesis xix (verses 27-29) that is completely lost was already missing when Grabe made his colla- tion of the text. The six surviving leaves, fol. 27, Bristol fol. IIII, fol. 28, fol. 29, fol. 30, and fol. 31, contain the remains of seven illustrations of the story of Lot of which three are in fairly good condition, and all but one of the others are legible. 51 For the text, see Gotch, op. cit., pp. 8-9. 52 The miniature itself is reproduced in E. Kitzinger, Early Medieval Art in the British Museum, London, 1955, pl. 12. Contrast fol. 3Ib of the Smyrna Octateuch, for which see Hesseling, op. cit., pl. 66.</page><page sequence="23">LATE-ANTIQUE INFLUENCES IN SOME ILLUSTRATIONS OF GENESIS 191 figure to which the hands belong was not visible, since the doorpost cuts across the hands just beyond the wrists. The right hand grips Lot's arm, and the left hand, which is placed higher up in the dark space of the open doorway, is held out in a gesture of command, striking the Sodomites blind. As the leaf now stands, and as it is recorded in the Vetusta Monumenta engraving, there are the remains of two lines of text, from verse i i, above the miniature. Between the word at the right end of the first line and the single surviving word in the second line, which is placed at the left of what remains of the leaf, six letters are missing.53 These six letters will have been written at the left of the single extant word in the second line. It follows that the miniature will have continued for a width equivalent to six letters beyond the doorpost which cuts off the hands of Lot's rescuer. This extra space presum- ably afforded a view of the exterior of Lot's house, since only the closed exterior wall would give point to the representation of the rescuing hands extended from the doorway, the sole means of access to the house according to the text. (b) The Caedmon MS.: I will now turn to the English material. The first two of our manuscripts can unfortunately be dealt with only too quickly. The text of Genesis xix is paraphrased on pages I I11-23 of the Caedmon MS. The text is not illustrated. It is however interspersed with picture-spaces which were never filled.54 The position of these picture-spaces in the narrative give some indication of the subjects which were originally intended to be illustrated. The scene of the rescue of Lot should presumably have appeared in the picture-space at the top of page I14, which is followed by the matter of Genesis xix. 9-1 i, or in the picture-space on page I15, which follows a reference to the angels' punishment of the Sodomites. We can say nothing about the specific iconographical content of the intended illustrations. It may however be significant that the programme of illustrations to Genesis xix planned in the Caedmon MS. is more extensive than that of D, and that the position of the illustrations within the narrative does not coincide with D.55 (c) The Aelfric MS.: The story of the Sodomites' attack on Lot's house, the rescue of Lot, and the blinding of the Sodomites by the angels is omitted from Aelfric's version of Genesis xix. A brief note explaining the suppression of verses 4-I i is inserted between verse 3 and verse I2.56 Consequently the Aelfric MS. contains no illustrations of the dramatic incidents described in verses 4-I i, and we have therefore no record of how these incidents were represented in the archetype of the Aelfric MS. The archetype must certainly have contained illustrations of the suppressed passage, since all the rest of Genesis xix is illustrated in the Aelfric MS. with unusual thoroughness. The 53 The missing letters are TECTHN. 54 For these, see Gollancz, op. cit. 55 In D there will have been io miniatures illustrating Genesis XIX; extant miniatures on fols. 27b, Bristol fol. IIIIb, 28, 29, 29b, 31; remains of the frame of a miniature on fol. 3ob; to these we can add 2 miniatures on the leaf lost between fols. 29 and 30, and a miniature on fol. 30. In the Caedmon MS. there are 12 picture-spaces on the extant leaves, and two leaves, with the matter of Genesis xix. 14-17, and 31-32, are missing. The original intention may have been to have as many as 16 illustrations. 56 For the text of this note, see Crawford, op. cit., p. 132.</page><page sequence="24">192 GEORGE HENDERSON cycle is more extensive than the one contained in D.57 Lot does not merely greet the angels at the gate of Sodom, as on fol. 27b of D, but is also shown sitting in the street before the angels' arrival, in literal illustration of verse I. Incidents not illustrated in D, such as the meal prepared by Lot for his guests, and Lot warning his sons-in-law of the imminent destruction of the city, are represented in the Aelfric MS. The archetype from which this dense array of narrative illustrations was borrowed clearly represented an old tradition inde- pendent of the Cotton Genesis tradition. We have no reason, therefore, to suppose that the archetype of the Aelfric MS. contained an illustration of the rescue of Lot and the blinding of the Sodomites at all like the illustration in D. (d) The Egerton MS.: In the top left-hand compartment on fol. Iob of the Egerton MS. there is an illustration of Genesis xix. 4-1 i (P1. 36b). At the left of the picture-space is Lot's house. A blinded Sodomite is spreadeagled against the side wall of the house, searching vainly for the door. Beyond him, towards the right, is the front of the house, with a round-headed door from which an angel emerges. The head of a second angel is partially seen, beyond the head of the first. The foremost angel seizes the arm and robe of one of Lot's daughters, who stands with her sister immediately outside the house. Beyond the daughters, towards the right, is Lot himself, confronting a group of Sodomites placed at the extreme right of the picture-space. Lot is shown in the very act of offering his daughters as substitutes for the angels. According to Genesis xix. 8, Lot made a verbal offer of his daughters to the Sodomites, but did not actually bring out his daughters. The version of the scene which we find in the Egerton MS., where the verbal offer is pic- torially substantiated, might be assumed to provide a second example of the curious literal-mindedness of the Egerton artist pointed out by Pacht in the top left-hand compartment of fol. I8b, where the evil beast, invented by Joseph's brothers as an explanation of his disappearance, is actually repre- sented in the scene of the brothers preparing to dip Joseph's coat in the blood of a kid.58 But we cannot in fact attribute the presence of the daughters in the illustration on fol. Iob to the original invention of the Egerton artist. The daughters are represented in a number of earlier illustrations of Lot's interview with the Sodomites. The earliest example known to me is a miniature in the eleventh-century Byzantine Gospels in Paris, Bibliotheque Nationale MS. gr. 74, where Lot presents one of his daughters to the group of Sodomites.59 Both daughters are presented to the Sodomites in the English thirteenth- century Huntingfield Psalter, a psalter illustration by W. de Brailes, and the French Maciejowski Bible of about 1250.60 57 I scenes from Genesis xix are illustrated in the Aelfric MS., thus exceeding the num- ber illustrated in D, despite the omission of the story of the rescue of Lot. 58 See Pacht, op. cit., p. 66. 59Fol. 147, reproduced in H.

Perhaps the habit of representing the daughters of Lot is partly the result of the influence of the story</page><page sequence="25">36 ii:iii~iiiiiiii'i i:::i::ii: i:: : 0 S d lb~~~i;"':-::: i-i-i-i:i: ----:---:---:----:--- i i: - - iii:-ii-i--i :~i~i-: ---: : :::i(i~i::.i pyme ""Oev VNM''''r~f? ~ --; iiij-: -:-iiiiiiiii-~~~i:!-~'i iiiiiiiiiiii 'i~ii~i~i''iii:--:''' aiiiiiiiiiii-i~iiiiiiii''SIT-:-i eq:::-i~ii;: x ef T I 7 p tax:::-: . ::-:::-:::-::::::::::- :::::::::::iO h ytv-: - .iiii--iiii-i~::ie?ii~ii Ct* I-cttdul-ti~iiiiji ::::::::::::::::::::::: ::::: iiit t iiiiiiiiii.._iiii :+: I -" f flu.,-- iiiii~i i-i:: : -:ic:- : :. ::::::i-:::_::i:::::: iiiiiiiiiiiiii ~ iii'i~iiiiiiiii-ii~i :: .ii .. ;:~ii~''i'i'i: :::* :::::::: : :---i,:i:iiii-i:i::i::;- v I V-::::::?"Or::iii::iii'iii 47~iiii~iiiiiii:~i iii NI:i--i~iiiiii iiiiiiii------ ?4 4iii- iiliiiiii~ii :::: .-.i i i i -- ii -_ Miii~~ii~ii~ z~:i~iii ~ iiiliiiiiiii:~:::;:: ~ - -:: a-The Disembarkation of Noah.

In de Brailes' illustration (P1. 36c) the Sodomites are gathered at the left of the composition. Lot faces them, enfolding his two daughters with his left arm. The elbow of his right arm is thrust out towards the Sodomites, his right forearm is placed horizontally, and he indicates his daughters with the long forefinger of his right hand. In the Egerton MS. this highly specific position of arm and hand is exactly reproduced. Again, in de Brailes' version a single angel intervenes between Lot and the Sodomites. This angel has two heads on a single body.6e In the Egerton version only one angel is shown intervening between Lot and the Sodomites, but beyond his head part of a second head is visible. The gratuitous addition of this second head suggests that the Egerton artist knew de Brailes' peculiar figure of the two-headed angel. Once we have recognized the close connection between the de Brailes and Egerton versions of the scene the differences between the versions become all the clearer. First, the Egerton artist has reversed the composition. The Sodomites are now at the right and the angel at the left. Secondly, the angel seizes one of Lot's daughters by the arm and by the dress, pulling her round towards him. Thirdly, the angel does not stand wholly visible within an open- sided house, as in de Brailes' version, but is represented as emerging from a doorway. His back and most of his wings are still inside the house, and are concealed. Fourthly, the composition continues for some distance beyond the angel. The outside wall of Lot's house is represented, and spreadeagled against it is the blinded Sodomite. What is the significance of these alterations? By turning the composition round, the Egerton artist has returned to the order of the composition in the miniature of the 'Rescue of Lot' in D. The other alterations point emphati- cally to a picture like the one in D as the second main source used by the Egerton artist. In the Egerton MS. the angel stretches out his hands to the right. One hand is directly above the other, like the hands emerging from the doorway in the miniature in D. With one of these hands the daughter of Lot is seized told of the old man of Gibeah and "certain sons of Belial" in Judges xix. 17-28, which closely parallels the adventure of Lot at Sodom but in which two women are offered and one actually brought from the house and surrendered to the mob. This story is illus- trated on fol. I6 of the Maciejowski Bible. 61 This curious figure appears to have been modelled on the representations of 'God the Father' and 'God the Son' on fol. 6 of the Bury Gospels, Cambridge, Pembroke College MS. I20, and on fol. 4b of the Lothian Bible, New York, Pierpont Morgan MS. 791, re- produced in M. Rickert, Painting in Britain : The Middle Ages, London, 1954, pl. 92. De Brailes is justified in applying a pictorial formula evolved to express the unity of God the Father and God the Son to two of the three angels who in the Genesis narrative had shortly before been Abraham's visitors. We have already seen that in the Aelfric MS. one of Abraham's visitors was represented as God, and the three visitors are represented as God in Trinity in early I3th-century French and English iconography. See for example fol. 18 of Rylands MS. French 5, reproduced in R. Fawtier, La Bible historide toutefigure'e de la John Rylands Library, Paris, 1924, pl. XXVII, and one of the picture-leaves at the beginning of Cambridge, Trinity College MS. B.

The Egerton artist has achieved a perfect compromise between his two sources, the de Brailes version, showing the daughters, and a miniature like the one in D, where Lot is seized. The Egerton artist has added the figure of a blinded Sodomite at the left of his composition. An essential characteristic of the miniature in D is that it represents the blinding as well as the rescue. This reference in the Egerton MS. to the rare subject of the blinding in itself suggests that the artist was relying on a Cotton-Genesis-type source. I pointed out that a strip equivalent in width to six text letters is lost at the left side of the miniature in D. I sug- gested that this part of the miniature may have shown the exterior wall of Lot's house. Since the Egerton version of the rescue and the blinding reveals an accurate knowledge of the Cotton Genesis version of the scene it seems that the Egerton version may record the missing portion of D, that is, the miniature in D may originally have contained a figure at the extreme left, representing the vain search for the door by the blinded Sodomites. The presence of such a figure in the miniature in D would complete in a satisfactory way the pictorial representation of the sense of verses i o-i I. Where did the fourteenth-century artist of the Egerton MS. acquire his precise knowledge of the Cotton Genesis tradition? The fact that he combines Cotton Genesis elements with elements borrowed from an illustration by the English illuminator W. de Brailes might suggest that he found his late-Antique model in England. But we have also to take into account the fact that what evidence we have suggests that the Cotton Genesis tradition of the history of Lot at Sodom was not known to the eleventh-century illustrators of the Caedmon and Aelfric MSS.62 The Egerton artist could of course have picked up his knowledge of the Cotton Genesis tradition of the rescue of Lot in Italy, not from the mosaics at San Marco, where the history of Lot is not illustrated, but from the arche- type of the San Marco mosaics, which was presumably still available, or from a similar manuscript. It was from Italy that D itself was brought to England in the reign of Henry VIII.63 CONCLUSION In the preceding pages I have analyzed in detail the illustrations in the Caedmon, Aelfric, and Egerton cycles of three subjects from Genesis xi, viii-ix, and xix, in the light of our knowledge of the late-Antique Cotton Genesis versions of these subjects. I will now summarize the results of this analysis. A. The Caedmon MS. (i) The illustrations of the 'Tower of Babel' in the Caedmon MS. contain a number of features which would appear to be peculiar to the authentic Cotton Genesis tradition as we know it from D. 62 In this connection it is unfortunate that we have no record of the appearance of the late 12th-century wall painting at Bury St. Edmunds representing the men of Sodom attacking Lot's house, referred to in the list of 93 subjects "in choro et circa" contained in Arundel MS. XXX in the College of Arms, for which see M. R. James, on the Abbey of S. Edmund at Bury, Cambridge Antiquarian Society Publications, XXVIII, 1895, pp. 186- 203, especially p. 200. 63 See E. M. Thompson, Catalogue of Ancient Manuscripts in the British Museum, London, I881, pt. I, Greek, p. 2o.</page><page sequence="29">LATE-ANTIQUE INFLUENCES IN SOME ILLUSTRATIONS OF GENESIS 195 (ii) In the illustration of the 'Disembarkation of Noah' all the features are consistent with the authentic Cotton Genesis tradition. One feature above all, the decoration of the surface of the Ark with an all-over pattern, points to an actual late-Antique model of the Cotton Genesis type. (iii) On the other hand, so far as can be judged from the distribution of the picture-spaces within the text describing the history of Lot at Sodom, it would appear that the model being used at this point by the planner of the programme of illustra- tions in the Caedmon MS. did not represent the Cotton Genesis tradition. In my introductory survey I referred briefly to illustrations in the Caed- mon MS. which appeared to come from contradictory sources, the Cotton Genesis-type 'Creation of Eve' (Genesis ii) on the one hand, and on the other hand the scenes of the 'Creation of the World' (Genesis i), 'Lamech with his family' (Genesis iv), and the 'Ark on the waters' (Genesis vii), which cannot be connected with the Cotton Genesis tradition. It is interesting that the impression of the Caedmon MS. formed on the basis of these illustrations does not conflict with the conclusions drawn from my subsequent detailed analysis of the 'Tower of Babel', the 'Disembarkation of Noah', and the 'Rescue of Lot'. We may tentatively group the intended programme of Lot scenes along- side the quantity of non-Cotton Genesis material in the Caedmon MS. The kind of source or sources from which this material was borrowed still remains obscure. But grouping together the illustrations of the 'Creation of Eve', the 'Tower of Babel', and, most important of all, the 'Disembarkation of Noah', we have at least a basis for the belief that one of the models used by the illustrator of the Caedmon MS. was an accurate, even perhaps ancient, representative of the Cotton Genesis tradition. B. The Aelfric MS. (i) The illustration of the 'Tower of Babel' in the Aelfric MS. contains features which agree with the mosaic of the 'Building of the Tower of Babel' at San Marco. I have pointed out that these features of the San Marco mosaic do not represent the authentic Cotton Genesis tradition as we know it from D, but come probably from very much later sources, of the kind that lie behind the Sicilian mosaics. (ii) Again, the relationship of the Ark to the rocky landscape in the Aelfric illustration of the 'Disembarkation' agrees strikingly with the San Marco version. This single feature on which the Aelfric MS. and San Marco agree is probably not an authentic element of the Cotton Genesis tradition, but instead a borrowing from highly evolved Italo-Byzantine tradition. In no other respect can the Aelfric 'Disembarka- tion' be linked with San Marco or the authentic Cotton Genesis tradition. The omission of the rainbow from the Aelfric 'Disembarkation', and its separate illustration later, connects the Aelfric MS. with the tradition recorded in the Octateuchs. (iii) Although the Aelfric MS. contains no illustrations of the 'Rescue of Lot', the unusually extensive cycle of illustrations of the 'History of Lot at Sodom' proves that the source employed by the illustrators of the Aelfric MS. did not represent the Cotton Genesis tradition, but instead a quite independent tradition of recognizably ancient origin. In my introductory survey I referred to three illustrations in the Aelfric MS., namely the 'Vision of the Furnace' (Genesis xv), the giants (Genesis vi), and the 'Hospitality of Abraham' (Genesis xviii), whose iconography seemed</page><page sequence="30">196 GEORGE HENDERSON to point back to an early period in the history of Biblical illustration. I was able to associate the third of these Aelfric illustrations specifically with the tradition recorded in the Vatican Octateuch. If we now take into account the results of my detailed analysis of the 'Tower of Babel', the 'Disembarkation of Noah', and the 'Rescue of Lot', a not inconsistent picture of the source used by the artists of the Aelfric MS. begins to emerge. I suggest that it was an elaborate Greek source, preserving in it, despite an overlay of features of a mature type, an early cycle in some ways connected with the Octateuch cycle but far more extensive than the Octateuch cycle. Thus in addition to the Cotton Genesis-type model which is apparently reflected in the Caedmon MS. there may have existed in England in the Anglo-Saxon period a manuscript containing a great series of Bible pictures, in origin late-Antique but belonging to no known recension. If this interpretation of the evidence is correct, then the historical importance of the Aelfric MS. as a visual record of a unique model can hardly be exaggerated. C. The Egerton MS. (i) The pair of illustrations of the 'Tower of Babel' in the Egerton MS. resembles very closely the two mosaics of the 'Building' and 'Abandonment' of the tower at San Marco. Since the San Marco mosaics represent a radical modification of the authentic Cotton Genesis tradition we cannot interpret the resemblance of the Egerton illustrations to them as a symptom of the influence on the Egerton artist of an independent Cotton Genesis-type model. We should rather interpret the resemblance as proof that the Egerton artist had seen and copied the San Marco mosaics. (ii) The illustration of the 'Disembarkation of Noah' in the Egerton MS. contains certain features which can be paralleled best in the twelfth-century mosaics at Monreale and Palermo. The composition as a whole and a number of important motifs appear to stem logically from English mediaeval icono- graphical tradition, as this had been defined shortly before by the artist of Queen Mary's Psalter, rather than from San Marco or the Cotton Genesis tradition. (iii) The illustration of the 'Rescue of Lot in the Egerton MS. is also heavily indebted to English mediaeval tradition, in this case to the work of W. de Brailes. The motifs which must stem from de Brailes are, however, combined with other motifs which undoubtedly belong to the authentic Cotton Genesis tradition as we know it from D and from D alone, and the general composition of the scene also conforms with that of the version in D. We are forced to the conclusion that in this case the Egerton artist had access to a model representing the authentic Cotton Genesis tradition. It is not impos- sible, but by no means certain, that the model of the Egerton 'Rescue of Lot' was preserved in England. These conclusions with regard to the Egerton MS. may appear very strange and contradictory. Of the illustrations of the first subject I affirm that they relate directly to San Marco and not to the authentic Cotton Genesis tradi- tion; of the illustration of the second subject I deny that San Marco and the Cotton Genesis tradition exercise any direct influence at all; and of the illus- tration of the third subject I affirm the direct influence on it of the authentic Cotton Genesis tradition. Yet I believe that these are the conclusions suggested by the facts.</page><page sequence="31">LATE-ANTIQUE INFLUENCES IN SOME ILLUSTRATIONS OF GENESIS 197 In my introductory survey I referred to illustrations in the Egerton MS. of subjects taken from Genesis i, ii, iv, xv, xviii, and xxxv. I suggested that the Egerton artist knew and copied illustrations in the Aelfric MS., and was also influenced by Jewish iconography. How does this impression of the Egerton MS. tie up with the results of my detailed analysis of the 'Tower of Babel', 'Noah's Disembarkation', and the 'Rescue of Lot'? Unless we assume that the Egerton artist acquired his accurate knowledge of the Cotton Genesis tradition of the rescue of Lot from a highly conservative Jewish source, we have no means of connecting the results of the detailed analysis of three subjects with the kinds of source-material which I particularized in my introductory survey. It seems that we have to allow that the Egerton artist was a man gifted with a remarkably inquiring and acquisitive mind, who borrowed as he saw fit from pure Anglo-Saxon tradition, from English thirteenth- and fourteenth-century tradition, from Jewish and from mature Italo-Byzantine tradition, from the Cotton Genesis tradition as modified and interpreted by the thirteenth-century mosaicists at San Marco, and from the authentic Cotton Genesis tradition itself as recorded, perhaps, in some manuscript preserved in England or Italy. Since influences from outside England are apparent in the Egerton MS., it is not possible to state with any certainty how far it reflects late-Antique source-material actually available in England. A detailed analysis of every subject which one or other of the English cycles have in common with the Cotton Genesis cycle is beyond the scope of this paper. The analysis of three subjects set out above represents part of a very much wider study which I have attempted of the illustrations in the various cycles of all subjects from Genesis i up to the burial of Abraham in Genesis xxv; that is, from one half of the book of Genesis. I believe that the evidence which I have actually brought forward in this paper is typical,64 and 64 Cf. for example the case of the story of the drunkenness of Noah as represented in the Cotton Genesis recension and the Caedmon, Aelfric, and Egerton MSS. San Marco de- viates from D by adding a vintage scene before the authentic scenes of Noah mocked and Noah covered, part of which survive on fol. I3b of D. The San Marco scene of 'Noah judging his sons' is no doubt authentic, and will have appeared on the recto of a leaf lost from after extant fol. 13. At San Marco Noah sits at the left judging between his sons. In the Caedmon MS. three picture-spaces on pp. 76, 77, were intended to contain illustra- tions of the mocking, the covering, and the judgement, and the choice of these subjects indicates the influence of a Cotton Genesis- type model. The second picture-space follows immediately upon the first, which might well reflect an illustration like the one in D, where the scenes of the mocking and the covering are placed one below the other on the same side of a single leaf. Although the illustrator of this portion of the Caedmon MS. in fact chose to insert in pp. 76, 77, illustrations ir- relevant to the text, he filled a picture-space left vacant on p. 78 for the scene of Noah's burial (the subject which follows the judge- ment scene at San Marco) with an illustration corresponding closely in composition and iconography to the two scenes on fol. I3b of D. Therefore the influence on the Cotton Genesis recension at this point in the Caed- mon MS. is clear. The Aelfric MS. contains on fols. 17, I7b, 18 no less than six distinct scenes, three relating to the vintage and three to the actual events of Noah's drunkenness and subsequent judgement of his sons. Such a large number of scenes clearly indicates the presence of an ancient cycle, and the em- phasis on the subject of the vintage points to the Octateuch tradition. Noah judging his sons is not represented seated, as in the Cotton Genesis recension, but still lying on the ground, as in the scenes of his drunkenness. English 14th-century iconography of the story of Noah's drunkenness is deeply indebted to the Aelfric MS. The Holkham Bible Picture-</page><page sequence="32">198 GEORGE HENDERSON that the conclusions which I have stated tentatively on the basis of this evi- dence give a fair indication of the nature of the late-Antique influences found in the Caedmon, Aelfric and Egerton MSS. Book contains a copy of the Aelfric scene of Noah digging with a spade beside his vine. The Egerton MS. also reflects the Aelfric MS., since it shows Noah judging his sons while still lying on the ground. But the presence of the child Canaan in the judge- ment scene, as well as the figure of one of Noah's virtuous sons walking backwards with a cloak held up behind him, would appear, characteristically, to introduce a quite new influence, that of the Vienna Genesis! And other new influences also appear. In the Egerton MS. Noah is clothed and disarrayed, not naked. This motif is paralleled at Mon- reale and Palermo. The spilt wine in the Egerton MS. running down vertically from the overturned bowl and then forming a round pool, recalls rather curiously the shape of the long-necked round beaker which stands beside Noah in the Monreale scene of Noah's drunkenness. Thus again many influences, Anglo-Saxon and Continental, seem to be included in the Egerton MS.</page></plain_text>
