<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHYSICS AND METAPHYSICS OF MUSIC AND ESSAYS ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS. By Lazare Saminsky. (Martinus Nijhoff, The Hague, Holland, 1957, pp. 145, Glr. 10.45. ) We shall confine ourselves here to the first essay in this slim volume of philosophical reflection, occupying pp. 9-54, which we con- clude, from the publisher's blurb, is the summation of the author's long development as an artist and thinker. "This peripeteia of a very young and fanatical Kantian moving up in his most mature years to a provoking scrutiny of the fast flow of facts-or disputes-as to the new mathematics and cosmology, has its climax, or its 'revelation' in 'Physics and Metaphysics of Music'. In this work, of a kind which we believe has nothing comparable in the philosophical literature, the author has truly emerged into a high sphere of philosophy of art and linked his thought to a vigorously formulated view of the Ultimate Real. " What Mr. Saminsky is saying is a reiteration of the most ancient general theory of music, namely, that music is the image of the uni- verse. Although Mr. Saminsky never says this, or anything, for that matter, so simply, he makes it clear that he intends to define the na- ture of the universe and to show the relevance of music to it. For him, the universe consists of two "vortices. " "Its one aspect is the ever boiling, ever changing and crumbling, ever dying and rising outer world-the phenomenal world... The inner vortex is a calm 'wave'. Its nature we sense-even identify ourselves with, only at exceptional mo- ments-as aimless, changeless, subliminal.., this Ever Present is obscured by the flux and mirage of the phenomenal world. Yet it emerges in gleams of a peculiar vision. " The author's task is "to show that the instrumentality of music is spurred by that above mentioned peculiar vision; sparked in exceptional moments by the Major Self; and that the inner line of the musical order, that music's innate 'design', reflects a subliminal gleam, that of the Ever Present. " Mr. Saminsky finds "return" to be the essence of the subliminal. 226</page><page sequence="2">He seeks to demonstrate the reversibility of time, hence the feasibility of formal return as the structural basis for the musical image of the universe, the "Ever Present," as he prefers to term it. The most beautiful summary of his thesis is strangely reminiscent of the much more forcefully put fifth part of T. S. Eliot's Burnt Norton. Saminsky says: "What does one read in the eternal pattern of music? -To be- come, yet to be; to move, yet to stand still; to change, yet to remain the same thing. " This simple statement of the truth is the most telling line in the entire essay. What can one say about such an essay? It is an example of the purist expressionism, the highly personal reflections of a sensitive personality. But perhaps we are permitted to ask, since these personal maunderings have been broadcast through publication, whether they mean anything to anyone else. We are aware that the works of Mr. Saminsky are spoken of in awe by many significant musicians and think- ers but we find ourselves in the uncomfortable position of the small boy who was finally forced to say in hushed tones: "But the Emperor has no clothes!" We might speak of organization. One can but doubt the orderli- ness of any expression of thought that requires a new paragraph for virtually every sentence. The look of the page suggests formlessness. We might mention the embarrassment occasioned by the bizarre and self-conscious substitutions for the word God in every instance that God was obviously meant. Was this some sort of false modesty that prevented the author from mentioning so great a subject-matter direct- ly, or was it the natural reluctance of a pantheist, perhaps even an atheist, to suggest the existence of a God? We find ourselves shocked by the willingness of the author to warp even the work of a dear friend in order to make it fit his inflexible Procrustean bed of a universe. He observes, in the work of an artist friend, the pattern ABACAD, but, in order to make it fit his circular notion of the universe, he casually sums together the last two sections producing a more satisfactory form for his purposes, ABACA. But the core of the problem is the question of reversibility, par- ticularly when it is applied to time. The truth is, that the author, like most advocates of cyclicism, is confusing space with time. However, he saves the situation by postulating time, itself, as another dimension of space, for which notion he draws support from Einstein and others. But, since music is a succession of acoustical events in time, hence demonstrating no spatial aspect whatsoever, what advantage is gained by counting time another dimension of space? Nor does time, in any case, necessarily demonstrate all the properties of another dimension in space. We may invert a three-dimensional object in space, but, to do so, requires new time; we may hold an object up to a mirror and create its mirror-image, but, to do so, requires new time. A space, once defined, is recognizably mutable, provided we are granted the time to make the mutation. Time does not "return. " If a person walks in a circle in a forest and returns to his original starting point, no one 227</page><page sequence="3">becomes so confused as to imagine that he has returned to the same time of day as when he departed. Why do we make this mistake re- peatedly when we examine musical forms? Why do we speak of a "re- turn" of an idea when what we really mean is the reiteration of an idea? And, most of all, why do we insist upon defending the error with clouds of verbal mysticism that would seek to turn poor woodsmanship into a glimpse of eternity? Apart from the content of the essays, the presentation of them by the author and the printer suggest a considerable disregard for what the publisher claims to be their deep significance. Writings of such universal import should not contain various spellings of such words as "ontological" and "anthropomorphic" on the same page. There are even places where the confusion of em- and en-dashes results in a serious distortion of the author's meaning. DAVID KRAEHENBUEHL</page></plain_text>
