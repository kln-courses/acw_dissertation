<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVIS, CAROLINE FRANKS. The Evidential Force ofReligious Experience. New York: Oxford University Press, 1989. 268 pp. $49.95 (cloth). The Evidential Force of Religious Experience is a version, if not the exact text, of Caroline Franks Davis's D.Phil. thesis. This book contains analyses of various theistic and nontheistic accounts of religious experience, as well as an indirect defense of theism. Although Davis refuses to give a precise definition of what counts as a "religious experience," she presents an extensive survey of interpre- tive, quasi-sensory, revelatory, regenerative, numinous, and mystical experi- ences. Davis's main argument emerges as an extension of Richard Swinburne's "cumulative argument" for the existence of God-she offers an argument from cognitive religious experiences for theism (pp. 95-96). My criticism is that Davis relies-with only slight modification-on arguments of her contemporaries at Oxford. Davis's basically uncritical acceptance and brief exposition ofJanet Martin Soskice's "critical realism," Swinburne's "cumu- lative arguments," and Margaret Yee's "validity in theology" greatly restrict her position. Davis appears naive and reductive even as she writes that "Critical real- ism [the standpoint of Soskice which is presupposed by Davis] ... avoids both the naive realist's unsupportable claims about the primacy and incorrigibility of a particular model of God (together with possible dangers of anthropomorphism) and the non-cognitivist's radical programme of demythologisation, which reduces reports of religious experiences to poetically embellished statements about the human condition" (p. 14). Davis assumes this realist position but never considers the sense of the word "critical"-clearly it is not in the spirit of Kant! We read her reference to "the 129</page><page sequence="2">The Journal of Religion dangers of anthropomorphism," but, with her own empiricist bias, she comes close to the same dangers. (In this regard what about the challenge-since Davis is concerned with challenges-of Ludwig Feuerbach?) I am not persuaded that the reality-depicting function of metaphorical language works for references to God-a claim she assumes from Soskice (see p. 13). Also Davis makes a generali- zation about demythologizing without as much as a mention of Rudolf Bultmann or anyone who, as she claims, "reduces reports of religious experiences to poeti- cally embellished statements about the human condition" (p. 14). Moreover, when we consider Davis's chapter headings, which include "Experience and Interpretation," "Challenges to Religious Experience," and "The Conflicting Claims Challenge," it seems unacceptable to leave out not only Kant and Bultmann but also Marx, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, and any philosophers in the hermeneutic tradition. (Davis does refer to Freud on pp. 205 and 229.) I admit being involved in a post-Kantian tradition, especially in hermeneutics and debates concerning modern/postmodern philosophy. Thus I assume that Kant demonstrates conclusively the impossibility of theoretical proofs for the existence of God, although he may find the argument from design morally com- pelling. In this light Davis's survey of religious experiences remains helpful. Yet my view is that in the wake of claims concerning the end or transformation of philosophy Davis should be held accountable for more than her book exhibits.
