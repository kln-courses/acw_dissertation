Reviewed by Monni Adams In featuring the collections of the Musde National of Cote d'Ivoire, the 1989 Paris exhibition "Corps sculptes, corps pares, corps masques" repeated to a considerable degree one organized in 1969 in Vevey, Switzerland. Both exhibitions were official efforts on the part of the Ivoirian govern- ment in cooperation with European support- ers to acquaint the general public with the arts of the diverse peoples of Cote d'Ivoire. The Vevey exhibition was sponsored by Swiss business and financial institutions; French ministries of culture and develop- ment were the patrons in Paris. Many of the earlier pieces of Ivoirian art are now missing, but representative artworks were borrowed from the gold regalia collec- tions of prominent Akan chiefs, including President Houphouet-Boigny, and from regional Ivoirian, French, and other Euro- pean museums. The high quality of the Musee National examples in the catalogue to the exhibition is matched by the supplemen- tary selections, many of which bear early col- lection dates. Altogether nearly 300 art objects were displayed in two galleries of the Grand Palais, a large exposition hall in cen- tral Paris. Over 20,000 people attended. 105</page><page sequence="2">The presentation, as I recall from a brief visit, was formal; the objects were displayed in conventional glass boxes, some of which could be viewed in the round. But one has only to compare this 1989 catalogue with the one published in 1969 to see a great change in the way these arts are approached. The 1969 catalogue, titled Arts de la C6te d'Ivoire (Vevey: Arts et Lettres) was small (8V4"x51") with black-and-white photographs of uniform size, assembled in random order; each was accom- panied by a few lines prepared by Bohumil Holas, a European, then head of the Centre des Sciences Humaines in Abidjan. Docu- mentary information, such as size or date of acquisition, was ignored. Most of the items were wood sculpture, but a few brass and gold items were included. The 1989 volume is a product of a concen- trated effort to make the presentation of African sculpture as aesthetically rich and interesting as the style of presenting contem- porary art to a sophisticated urban public. It is large (113/4"x81/4"), with numerous color photographs illuminated by captions docu- menting size, provenience, and exhibition history. The objects are shown in ordered sequences according to the three formal divi- sions of the central theme announced in the title: the sculptured, decorated, and masked body. A few textiles, several examples of Lagoon figured potteries, and numerous Akan gold works add variety, but the emphasis remains on figural sculpture in wood. All the objects I recall seeing in the exhibition are illustrated. The keynote of the exhibition and cata- logue is the collaboration between French and Ivoirian scholars. The Ivoirian co-cura- tor, Savand Yaya, is the current director of the Musee National in Abidjan. The French co- curator, Etienne Feau, comes from the Musde des Beaux Arts in Angouleme, France, where he is responsible for African art. Interspersed among the objects are essays by a number of scholars of history, philosophy, ethnology, and history of arts-and this roster includes leading Ivoirian academicians such as Harris Memel-Fote, Georges Niangoran-Bouah, and Ang'le Gnonsoa. Postmodern in style, the design of the cat- alogue is eye-catching indeed. No consistent approach marks the visuals. Illustrations change size and angle frequently; often, full figures are shown in small size alongside a detail enlarged to make one aware of the form. An unforgettable highlight of the book is a double-page spread of a stunning scene, recently captured by one of the contributors, Marie-Noil Verger-Fbvre, of young men of the Niabwa Leopard Society, bodies decorat- ed, on their way to a ceremony (pp. 100-101). There are some excellent studio photographs of objects, not shrouded in shadow, but unfortunately the black objects are tinted blue and the brown ones are tinted pink. (Also, despite the inclusion of three maps of C6te d'Ivoire, some key locations in the texts are not indicated.) The freedom of computer-generated text is evident in the variations of font, of bold and light type, of narrow and wide spacing of lines and columns of print. The diverse arrangements of the illustrations and accom- panying explanatory text take account of the mutual relationship of the two facing pages of an open book, so that each turn of the page stimulates a fresh response. Due to the style of layout, this catalogue shares an impetus that art historians have pointed out for contemporary painting or sculpture: the viewer is impelled to make an effort to grasp the content. As for substance, there is a clear intent to give a broad introduction to the subject, start- ing with brief texts by a number of scholars, explaining the three divisions of the cata- logue topics, and going on to geography, his- tory of encounters with Europeans, regional groupings, and the current status of archaeo- logical endeavors and museum conditions in C6te d'Ivoire (pp. 14-41). Etienne Feau's intro- duction to the objects offers helpful com- ments, noting such things as the shallow age of wood sculpture, the kinds of wood, the closed structure of style, the varying status of the carver, and the continuing use of these arts (pp. 37-41). A few other points he makes-- such as affirming style differences according to the four major language groups, or contrast- ing figure sculpture as rarely seen outdoors with masks as readily appearing under the sun-could be debated, but perhaps these divisions offer the nonspecialist immediately accessible categories. Whether or not the general reader grasps the fine points scored in the essays, one reve- lation should come through strongly, espe- cially in the commentaries of Ariane Deluz, Eberhard Fischer, and Angele Gnonsoa: the flux of peoples and styles in C6te d'Ivoire and beyond. This is a welcome contrast to earlier notions of bounded ethnic groups endlessly repeating ancient types, notions that scholars have spread so widely among the public. Focusing on the theme of the body, the noted aesthetician Harris Memel-Fote expands on the institution of honoring the "beautiful man" found among peoples in the Lagoon and western zones, just where few human figures are sculpted in wood. Professor Memel-Fote finds moral, sociopolit- ical, and metaphysical implications in this favoring of beauty that aims to go beyond social inequalities and allows for individuali- ty and merit (pp. 96-99). In the longest contribution, Georges Niangoran-Bouah emphasizes various levels of meaning in the Akan use of drums (pp. 186-96)-as symbols of king and country and of age classes, as a means of communicating information and cultural knowledge--and in the Akan use of gold (pp. 224-34), which, since it resists disintegration, embodies divine essence. In the social sphere, gold serves as a kind of money; in the ritual realm its weights and other utensils, kept in a skin bag called a dja, symbolize economic power, a means of annual purification, and a sum- mary of family or community cultural memo- ry. He illustrates a number of proverb weights and explains how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide using linear weights. Angele Gnonsoa, a We-speaker who researches and teaches oral traditions at the Universite Nationalin Abidjan, contributes an essay on the shared naturalistic and expressionist styles of the We/Guere and Dan, showing that masks passed between the two peoples as booty of war and through marriages (pp. 110-14). Marie-Noel Verger- Fievre of the Ecole de Louvre adds stylistic attributions to Dan masks and rice spoons (pp. 117, 122-25, 176-79). Many of the entries for objects from diverse regions benefit from Eberhard Fischer's comprehensive knowl- edge of the literature and his years of experi- ence in COte d'Ivoire. In linking the cultures of the Guro and Yaur6, Ariane Deluz empha- sizes oral traditions, the shared masking complex, and symbolic intent (pp. 132-34). (Unfortunately her 1988 and 1989 references are missing from the bibliography.) The two essays on the Senufo (pp. 76-81; 151-52) by Noelle Aubry are based on published re- search by other scholars, a difficult task, marred in the "Ancient Mother" article by rather futile speculations. More than the other contributors, the African scholars con- vey the indigenous cultural values associated with the art objects. Much of the information presented in the essays and captions is known to Africanist scholars through earlier publications by spe- cialists. Nevertheless, as attached to the illus- trated objects the commentaries are useful to any reader. But some surprises were in store for me, at least. Deluz, an authority on the Guro region, points out that the Guro/Yaure men's social control group, whose key mask, Gye, should not be seen by women under pain of death, in fact collaborates secretly with the women's sodality, which uses the mask as a ritual object; in addition Guro masks can at times shift gender. Francine Ndiaye, curator at the Musee de l'Homme in Paris, says of a Baule libation vase donated in 1900 that it was part of the funerary furnishings that accompa- nied anthropomorphic statuettes modeled in the image of high-ranking ancestors and kept in sacred woods. According to this informa- tion, then, there are Baule ancestor figures. Regarding the large, upright Senufo bird stat- ue, long identified as a hornbill, a scholar named Diarrassouba Tiohana Moussa claims that the Senufo designate it only as "bird," and further that the elders never cited the hornbill in accounts of origin. Instead, the mythic birds were the ostrich and the grey pageais (Senufo: kalasireloni). A certain tension marks this catalogue, arising from the postmodern style of layout intermeshed with conventional scholarly con- cerns. Nevertheless, the quality of the con- tents will yield many hours of pleasure in contemplation of both refined and intense representations of the body and its enhance- ments as conceived by African artists; and the scholars' texts will refresh and enrich one's understanding of styles, usage, and his- torical relationships of early to mid-twenti- eth-century art in C8te d'Ivoire.
