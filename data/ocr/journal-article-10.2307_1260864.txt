<plain_text><page sequence="1">Folklore 112 (2001):47-63 RESEARCH ARTICLE "These Stories Will Not Lead You To Heaven": An Encounter with Two Simi Narrators Ann Helene Bolstad Skjelbred Abstract This article deals with a neglected narrative tradition-that of the largely nomadic Simi people of the northern regions of Norway, Sweden and Finland. In the past, when the stability of tradition was taken as necessary to an interesting and "authentic" culture, SAmi narratives were regarded only as "loans" from other countries through which the Simi passed, and of no intrinsic interest or value. Though nowadays such criteria are no longer considered either necessary or valid, there still has been no extensive study of SAmi narrative culture. This article attempts to begin to remedy this situation by discussing two Sami narrators and their stories. [1] Travelling North During the summer of 1997, I flew north from Oslo to Alta, a distance of approximately 1700 kilometres, and from there an interpreter took me on a four-hour car journey to Kautokeino, in order to meet Berit Anne Blind (born 1904) at the old folks' home there. It was a collection of Saimi tales, Lappiske eventyr og sagn (1928) by collector and scholar Just Knud Qvigstad, that inspired me to travel to Kautokeino to visit Berit Anne. While registering North Norwegian fairy tales for Tromso Museum, where Simi tales in Norwegian are also represented, I found that Qvigstad's youngest informant from Kautokeino was only twenty-six years old when the second of the four volumes was published. The young woman's name was Ellen Utsi (born 1902), and her repertoire of tales and legends is the largest in this volume. I wondered if there was a chance that some of her relatives could be found for interviews. Through contacts, Berit Anne Blind's name came up and it tran- spired that she was Ellen Utsi's younger sister. An interview was arranged with her. She had lived many years in Sweden and speaks Swedish fairly well, but the interview was undertaken in Sami with the help of an interpreter. In this article, I shall discuss Ellen and Berit Anne's background and their repertoire of stories. Ellen's repertoire exists in the printed volume of Qvigstad's collections, but Berit Anne's consists of the stories gleaned during the interview I conducted with her in 1997.

Two thousand inhabit the northern part of Russia, 5,000 live in Finland and 10,000 in Sweden (see Figure 1). They may be divided in four groups according to settlement patterns and way of life. The sea-Samis live by the Norwegian fjords and engage in fishing and some agriculture. The river- and lake-SAmis are settled along waterways in the interior of northern Norway, Sweden and Finland. The forest-SAmis inhabit Swedish Lappland and engage in agriculture, in addition to keeping some reindeer. The mountain-SAmis inhabit Norway, Sweden and Finland and their main occupation is reindeer nomadism, moving back and forth between summer and winter pastures. 0 6 Alta Nordreisa Tromso ,i 4E ARCTIC Skibotn O S k b Kautokeino C sKaresuando Troms Nordreita okaokeino RUSSIA *Karesuando S % SLAPPLAND 0 c Trondheim S Tronde FINLAND NORWAY Bergen SWEDEN "&amp;Helsingfors Oslo t o Stockholmr Figure 1 The Nordic countries and the section of the northern area where Ellen Utsi and Berit Anne Blind grew up and have lived.

In 1852, Russia, which had ruled Finland since 1809, closed the border between Norway and Finland, mainly to keep the Norwegian Saimis out. The border between Sweden and Finland was likewise closed in 1889. However, on both sides of the Swedish-Norwegian border, the right to pasture for reindeer, together with fishing, hunting and lumber rights, were upheld in certain districts. The Convention of 1972 guarantees Swedish Samis summer pastures for approximately forty thousand reindeer in Norway, while Norwegian Samis are guaranteed winter pasture for approximately ten thousand reindeer in Sweden. Attitudes to Sami Culture and Narrative Tradition Just Knud Qvigstad Just Knud Qvigstad (1853-1957) is a legend in the history of Norwegian academia, not only because he lived to be a great age but also for his extraordi- nary academic career. He obtained a PhD in both philology and theology and possessed great knowledge of both the SAmi and Finnish languages. He learned Sami in Kautokeino in 1878 and his teacher was one of the three men arrested for the Kautokeino rebellion in 1852 (see later). The teacher was condemned to death along with the other two men, but was pardoned because of his youth and was sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour instead. As a result of his good behaviour, he was released and worked in Kautokeino as a Bible translator for the Norwegian Bible Society. Qvigstad was also closely involved in mission- ary and humanitarian work among the Samis from the 1880s and was one of the founders of the Norwegian Sami Mission in 1888. Although it is not mentioned, it is not impossible that Qvigstad knew the grandfather of Ellen Johnsdatter Utsi-one of the storytellers profiled in this article-who was teacher and sexton in Kautokeino at the time Qvigstad stayed there while learning the Sami language. Qvigstad was primarily a linguist; one reason he collected folklore was to document Nordic loanwords in Sami. He published a series of books on the Sami language, names and folklore. In accordance with the prevailing evolution- ary way of thinking, he thought Sami folklore demonstrated that the Sami were at a more primitive cultural stage than the Norwegians, adopting Moltke Moe's term "naturfolk" to refer to them. [3] Though this word "naturfolk" is not as negatively loaded as "primitive," it still connotes a stage beneath "civilised." Moltke Moe Any collector [of tales] will have experienced that tales seep gradually into a region through many channels which often elude any research, through the migration of workers or travellers, in short, through any kind of association or contact with strangers. I have myself experienced this time and again (Moe 1925, 138). Like the Samis themselves, Sami tales were nomads through time and from</page><page sequence="4">50 Ann Helene Bolstad Skjelbred people to people. It was Moltke Moe's opinion that Samis had no narrative tradition of their own and that Sami tales were transmitted from other cultures. Thus, they were of value only in that they showed generally known motifs and themes in Sami attire. Loan is a key word in his evaluation of Sami narrative tradition. Moe gives one example of how such cultural loans happened and refers to an incident described by the Finnish Kalevala-collector, Elias LUnnrot. LUnnrot once asked a kven (a Finnish immigrant to Norway in historical times) where he had learned his repertoire of tales. The kven answered that for many years he had been fishing in the Arctic Ocean together with Russian and Norwegian fishermen. When the weather was too bad for going out in their boats, they spent the time telling tales. Even if he did not understand everything because of the language differences, he understood enough to be able to retell the tales for his own people at home, with his own additions and changes. The Primacy of "Stability" According to modes of thought prevalent in those times, stability was the factor which created a "genuine" tradition. The consensus was that folk literature is traditional narrative transmitted over time in an original, stable form. The fact that Sami storytelling was open to impulses from outside constituted an argu- ment against the existence of a genuine Sami narrative tradition and a reason for denigrating Sami culture. In his review of Qvigstad and Sandberg's Lappiske eventyr folkesagn (1887), Amund Helland, a leading academic of the period, wrote: One can review tale after tale ... and point out loan after loan from the neighbouring peoples, and often one can, in one single tale, find traits that are both Norwegian and Russian. Some have the strongest impulses from Russia, others from Norway, others again from Finland, while genuine, totally Finnish tales are, perhaps, the hardest to detect, the most genuine are, perhaps, the animal tales (Helland 1906, 2:381. Emphasis added). Moe goes further: the Samis have received a strong supply of tales from people who are their superiors in culture and cultural connections ... it is a fact that in general it is the more superior people who give, and the less developed who receive (Moe 1925, 138). Modern definitions of tradition as process not only rescue North Norwegian and Norwegian-SAmi storytelling from this sort of negative evaluation, but valorise it as a product of mobility over time and place and as a result of people coming together. From this point of view, LUnnrot's description of how the kven listened to, and retold, tales does not indicate a failure of tradition. Rather, it is a description of tradition in action, in continuous movement and change. Ellen and Berit Anne: Sdmi Storytellers Volume 2 of Qvigstad's voluminous collection of Lappiske eventyr og sagn is from Kautokeino, and Ellen Utsi is the narrator of eight international tales, four aetiological tales, and a number of legends in this volume. They were written down in Sami and translated into Norwegian by Qvigstad himself. The volume</page><page sequence="5">An Encounter with Two Sdmi Narrators 51 includes both new tales and variants of tales already known. As tales, they lack nothing when compared to Norwegian tales. Any attempt to categorise them as loans, in Moe and Qvigstad's sense, is irrelevant for contemporary folkloristics. Ellen's tales have a value of their own. They show coalescence and variation, both within a Sami repertoire and in comparison with a Norwegian repertoire. They form a cultural zone where Sami and Norwegian intermingle and frolic. The same is true for the repertoire of legends and personal experience stories. They are entitled to be placed on an equal footing with comparable Norwegian stories, and do not in any way fall short when it comes to content, significance or meaning. Ellen Johnsdatter Utsi and Berit Anne Blind were born in 1902 and 1904 respectively. [4] Their family was a respected one, the most notable member being their maternal grandfather, Morten Klemetsen, who was a third gener- ation teacher and served also as the sexton in the local church until 1905. His father had led the group of men who came to the support of those under assault during the Kautokeino rebellion 1852. This rebellion came about as a Sami protest against Norwegian supremacy. It was directed against the clergy, who represented Norwegian dominance in the language, style and content of re- ligion, and against the merchants, who far too willingly furnished the Sami people with hard liquor. The rebels belonged to Levi Laestadius's congregation, who even today have great influence in the Sami regions. This Lutheran denomination is characterised by the use of the Sami language, by its strong emphasis on revivals, and by a pietistic world-view. The Kautokeino rebellion ended with the killing of a merchant, three arrests, and two executions. The Swedish-Norwegian king, Oscar I, gave Klemet Gundersen, Ellen and Berit Anne's great-grandfather, a reward of 100 kroner (a considerable sum of money in the 1850s) and a silver medal for outstanding civic service. The year 1852 is a milestone in Sami history and is referred to by many Samis in one way or another. A recent example of its importance is as follows. Lately, there has been a heated ethical debate in Norway relating to the men executed during the Kautokeino rebellion. For many years, their skulls had been used as research material at the Institute of Anatomy at the University of Oslo, a practice dating from the time when physical anthropological research, based on the anatomic differences between races, was at its height. During the 1990s, descen- dants of the executed men demanded the return of the skulls so that they could be buried in Simi land. After a long, and at times heated, debate involving the Norwegian Parliament, the Simi Parliament, and the University of Oslo, the skulls were returned and buried in their home region in a simple, but significant, religious ceremony. Berit Anne's references to her family, her grandfather's position as a teacher, references to the family's connection with the Kautokeino rebellion in the work of the biographer Adolf Steen (1992), and the religious background of the family are all important factors in their self understanding. Because reindeer husbandry is the traditional occupation, the Sami people live a mobile life, moving across the border between Sweden and Norway. Sami people have relatives in both countries, and not infrequently in Finland too. Though not all Samis are nomads, even those who are predominantly farmers or fishermen have relations across the Norwegian border. There are Samis also in Russia-a fact worth noting, especially when it comes to comparative studies</page><page sequence="6">52 Ann Helene Bolstad Skjelbred and the indexing of Simi folk literature. Ellen's and Berit Anne's background is typical in this respect. They have family in two countries, Norway and Sweden. Their paternal grandfather moved to Karesuando, which is located on the Finnish border in Northern Sweden, but returned later to Norway and Kau- tokeino. Their father was born in Karesuando but settled in Kautokeino where he owned reindeer. During the summer, the family moved to Nordreisa in Northern Norway, but during the winter they stayed in Kautokeino where the children went to school. The inhabitants in Kautokeino were predominantly S mis at the turn of the century, and they still are. "When I was a child, I lived here in Kautokeino. I'm baptised here and confirmed," Berit Anne told me. A mobile life such as this implies a variety of scenes, contacts and exchanges of experiences and stories. In a magazine interview from 1981 when she was seventy-nine years old, Ellen Utsi stated that the family lived with the maternal grandfather when they stayed in Kautokeino during the winter and went to school there for three months. Berit Anne revealed that she was a good pupil and never had to stay in after school finished in the evening. At that time, it was the custom that the children of the reindeer nomads attended school from New Year for twelve weeks; the next twelve weeks were for the children in permanent residence. "We probably didn't learn much," Ellen Utsi told the journalist, "but I'm not so sure that the teachers had much competence either." It is a fact that there was a lack of suitably qualified teachers in the whole of Northern Norway at the time, and most notably in the Saimi regions. According to Berit Anne, her sister Ellen was very competent in the Norwegian iii~i, i i  ii~~iiii-i;i.-i " ":::: ::  ,S ,I::: :..:....... iiii:::::: :.. :-_::-:: : :--?::-.:? ??: iiii~i~iiii:_i::?_-i ; i-i~ii~: iiiii ~i-:-ii:? ii i.ii ~ ]i-ii-i:-? i i: -: iijl::':i?:.--:_.: :7 -::::.:::: ::::-: ::::: :::: ::i :)~ - :iiii: ;:;:i::::::::i~ii~:i~ !i;ii !iiiiiii iii iiii !ii ~_l:~i~' -:- -i- --::: ? _i: -: - :--i : :;:: : :i::)::iii--_i:ii:ii---------------------- ::iii:: :: !i;!;ii;iN; -:-:-::-:::-::HIM AND two,:;~ ..: iieiiiiiiii-iiiiiiiiiijiii NUNi I~:~lgPl~s~~;ii:i ij~i~ji~iiSii:i~lii 14'i ~iiiiii- :.fiiiiii~iiiiiiiiiii ~iiiiii-~iii"M illiliiii ---: -:-::---::-.:-::_----:--::-Alum~-:-- Jig:: : ~-::--::-:?:- - -------:-:---:~ii:~ i~ '::::::''~::::::~: --- :i---:--::-:I--:-: . -:-:__:::::_:-,i -:A Ami-.a:,I::::~ :j::::: :i:::j ::i::: i ::: ::: :I:::--:::: ::_-::::::-::::::::;-:::: :---:--. ... . . . ... .....c~s 8:~- :: . . . . . . . . . . . . . -:::::::: 1: 1-:r;-_'i:'- ..........----:_-::-:-::::-:::----:l i-~~ Figure 2 Ellen Utsi at the age of seventy-eight.

Perhaps that was how she came in contact with Just Qvigstad, who was the principal of Tromso-gymnasium. Ellen herself said in 1981 that it was while she was in hospital in Tromso that she met him. As she recalled it, as a small girl of only four or five years, she was taken ill. There was no doctor in Kautokeino, but her grandfather studied medical books translated from German to find out what was wrong with her. In addition, they had to rely on other people's experiences. "But no one in the region knew of any remedy. They knew of similar ailments, but had no other name for it [Ellen's illness] than 'the new ailment.' Later, a nurse came wandering over the mountains to Kautokeino and told them that it was polio." It is not clear when Ellen was hospitalised in Tromso for this condition, but one can presume that she must have been an adolescent. Berit Anne did not remember it that way. She told me that Ellen went to Tromso to meet a quack to get some help for her ailment. Whether Ellen met this quack or not Berit Anne did not know, but she got better. However, it seems that she limped. It was during this trip to Tromso that she met Just Qvigstad. "This rector actually knew Sami better than I did, although he was Norwegian and not Sami," Ellen had told the journalist in 1981. He put her in contact with Konrad Nielsen, a renowned collector and researcher of the Sami language and a publisher of a Sami-Norwegian dictionary. Konrad Nielsen sent Sami words for Ellen to translate. Some time during her earlier years, Ellen went to Alta to perfect her knowl- edge of the Norwegian language, and to learn home economics and sewing. The Lutheran minister there advised her to get some further education, but since this implied that she would have to live away from her family, she declined and returned to Kautokeino where she earned her living as a seamstress. Both Ellen and Berit Anne herded reindeer in their youth. In 1944 Ellen, Berit Anne and their mother were evacuated to Sweden. Their father had died that same year. Ellen married a Swede, Hugo Mattsson from Uppsala, and Berit Anne married a Swedish Sami, Jonah, whom she refers to in her narratives. Ellen told the journalist that when Hugo proposed to her, she warned him that it might not be a good idea for him to marry her since she was Sami and he was not. But they married in 1946, returned to Kautokeino and lived there for the rest of their lives. Berit Anne stayed in Sweden and returned to Kautokeino only when she was widowed in 1970. Ellen died in 1988. In the remainder of this article, I shall first discuss and list the tales in Ellen Utsi's repertoire as indicated by her contribution to Lappiske eventyr og sagn (1928), then describe the stories which her sister Berit Anne told me during my interview with her (1997). Ellen Utsi's Repertoire of Sdmi Tales There is no information about where Ellen learned her tales or from whom. Important contextual questions, therefore, can no longer be answered. It is conspicuous, for example, that she contributed the only known (indexed) Sami variants of AT 590A, 766, 777 and 1245. The geographic distance between Ellen's variants and the Norwegian variants of AT 561, 766 and 1245 is another salient trait. Her sister Berit Anne was asked if she knew from where Ellen got her tales,</page><page sequence="8">54 Ann Helene Bolstad Skjelbred but she was unable to answer the question. Though there are literary parallels to some of her stories, this indicates only that the stories belonged to a common Sami repertoire. In Qvigstad's collection of tales and legends from Kautokeino, Ellen's narra- tive style does not differ from that of the other informants. Her repertoire is not markedly feminine in respect of the length of her stories, or the earnestness of her descriptions of characters, or the plots (see Merkelbach-Pink 1939). Nor, with the exception of AT 403, The Girl Who Jumped Overboard and Became a Golden Duck, do Ellen's tales of magic primarily have heroines (Holbek 1987, 161). There are female leading characters in the religious tale AT 766, The Seven Sleepers, and in the jocular tale AT 1245, but there is nothing heroic about these leading characters, rather the opposite. Moltke Moe evaluates some of the Sami tales in his introduction to Qvigstad and Sandberg's edition of Simi tales and folk legends from 1887, by categorising different motifs as loans from either Finnish, Russian or Norwegian. He com- ments about one of the tales in this collection that its only noteworthy trait is its genealogical final remarks! In our understanding of tradition as process and the value of tales as migrants, it would be meaningless to evaluate Ellen Utsi's tales only as loans from other people. As narratives they can, without a doubt, defend themselves magnificently. 1. International Tales Miraculous Tales [5] * AT 403 + 403A: The Girl Who Jumped into the Water and Became a Golden Duck. This is a variant of the Cinderella tale, which is not found in Norwegian tradition but occurs in eight Sami variants. Of these, six are Norwegian-SAmi, one is from Russia, and one from Sweden. There are different variants of the tale in Swedish, Finnish and Russian, and several other languages. * AT 561: The Boy and the Lantern is the tale about Aladdin. There are three written Norwegian-Sami variants, and four Norwegian variants from the southern part of the country. There are also Swedish, Finnish and Russian variants, in addition to several European ones. * AT 509A: The Brother and the Devious Sister. This particular tale is not found in Norwegian tradition but is a variant of AT 590 collected under the name of "The Blue Band." AT 590A has parallel variants in Finnish and Russian, and in several European languages. Qvigstad did not include this story in his index of Sami tales, with the result that it is not noted in the Aarne and Thompson catalogue (1973). Religious Tales * AT 758: The Various Children of Eve. Qvigstad indexed this tale as a legend. This happens fairly regularly in Norwegian tradition because the story is usually found as a legend about the fairies. * AT 766: The Seven Sleepers. Orally, one variant of this tale has been noted in Norwegian tradition. There are Finnish-Swedish and Finnish variants of the</page><page sequence="9">An Encounter with Two Sdmi Narrators 55 same tale, in addition to those found in other European languages. The one S~mi variant in the index must, therefore, have been told by Ellen Utsi. * AT 777: The Wandering Jew. Five Norwegian variants of this tale have been noted. There are also Swedish and other European variants, but there is only one Sami example, which must also have been told by Ellen. Novelle (Romantic Tales) * AT 930: Anders Buhara, a variant of "The Prophecy," which is not, it appears, represented in Norwegian tradition, but which has Finnish-Swedish, Swedish and other European parallels. There are, however, three Norwegian-Sami examples. Numskull Stories * AT 1245: Sunlight Carried in a Bag into the Windowless House. There are five Norwegian variants from the southern part of the country. Ellen Utsi's variant is the only Sami one. But there are also Finnish, Finnish-Swedish, Swedish and Russian examples. 2. Aetiological Tales * Why the Grebe Has His Feet So Far Back. According to this tale, the grebe wanted red feet like the goose. When God denied him that he flew away in anger. As he passed by, God placed black feet in his rump. There are four Norwegian variants of the tale from the southern part of Norway. There are also a number of Sami variants from Sweden and Norway. * The Origin of the Wild Reindeer. The theme of this narrative is that the ill-treated reindeer becomes wild and reduces its owner to poverty, whereas the well- treated reindeer becomes domesticated and brings wealth to its owner. The tale is found in many Sami variants. * The Origin of the Wolf. According to this tale, the wolf was created by the Devil, who failed to give it life. The Devil, therefore, placed the wolf on the road where God would have to pass by. To clear the road, God had to give life to the wolf. This tale has several Swedish-Sami variants, but the only Norwegian-Sami example is that narrated by Ellen Utsi. * Animals' Ancestress. Every species has an ancestress, the story tells. When the frog and the dung beetle are killed, the ancestress will punish those who have killed them. 3. Legends Moltke Moe characterises Sdmi legends as the most independent part of Sami transmission of folk culture, and evaluates them as a main source of Sami spiritual life. Ellen Utsi's repertoire of legends and memorates is quite rich. Three of her legends are migratory (Christiansen 1958). I shall briefly present the remainder, which are set within a frame of Simi folk life, reindeer husbandry, and local nature.</page><page sequence="10">56 Ann Helene Bolstad Skjelbred * Infants Killed Before They Were Baptised (ML 4025). Ellen Utsi has four variants of this legend-type, "a cycle of stories told about such happenings, but told as actual experience, without any distinct epic pattern" (Christiansen 1958, 65). In the Sami stories, the murdered child is recognised because of its distinct call, which resembles that of the partridge. Sometimes it becomes a crying, naked child trying to overtake a person on the road, but it is hindered by open water or an innocent child. Ellen Utsi's grandfather told her about a murdered child who ran between a man's legs and clung to the man's back. He asked the child who his parents were. The man lost his "power" and died. * Ghosts. Ellen has four stories about unnamed mysterious apparitions. She got one such story from her father who had the experience himself as a young man. The three others refer to her own experiences while she herded reindeer as a young girl. * Revenants appear in one story about a named girl who "came back" because she had been unfairly treated. * Death Omens is the topic of one story about a man who had a premonition about his own death. It scared him so badly that he died. * Fairies and People Underground is the theme of five stories. One such story is a migratory legend (ML 5090: "Married to a Fairy Woman"). Another story is about two boys who gained a fairy cow by throwing a knife over it (ML 6055). When the fairy woman asked to have it back, one boy refused to release the cow while the other gave it back to her. She thanked him by giving him a ring, and as long as he wore the ring, he prospered. When he took it off, he became poor. Three stories reflect Ellen's personal experiences of seeing and meeting reindeer and fairy girls while she was out herding reindeer. Since no one else had seen the fairy girl, the conclusion was that it must have been one of Adam's hidden children, a variant of AT 748. * Fishing in the Fairy Lake (ML 6065). Ellen's variant is told about a local lake. The story goes that this lake has a double bottom, but with a hole in it so that the fish can jump up. * Legends about Hidden Treasure (ML 8010). This is a personal experience story. Ellen was herding reindeer when her foot was caught in a hole. She heard a ringing sound and saw a small box, but before she had time to look into it, she had to run after her reindeer, and when she came back the following day, she could find neither the hole nor the box. * Healers and Omens of Illness are the themes of one story about the Spanish flu. In the story, the flu appears in anthropomorphic form as a group of human beings who are heard discussing where they ought to go next to contaminate other people. All of these stories have parallels in Norwegian tradition; what distinguishes them is the distinct Simi setting. However, Ellen Utsi has some stories that are more characteristically Simi. * Sdmi Shamans (Noaidies) and Sdmi Magicians are the themes in four of Ellen's stories. In one of them, two shamans argue about who is the strongest, in another, they argue about inflicting evil on another person in the form of revenants as revenge for grievances, and in a third, about killing with poison.</page><page sequence="11">An Encounter with Two Sdmi Narrators 57 * Sacrificial Stones is the topic of three stories. Such stones play an important role in Sami religion. * Wars of Former Times (ML 8000). This legend tells how a Sami guide, forced by the enemy to show the way, endangers his own life to lead the enemy army corps to destruction. Although this legend is told in many places in Norway, it is favoured among the Sami people and features the enemy as the Russians, Swedes or just plain robbers. Ellen has three variants of this legend. * Stallo Tales. The trickster Stallo punishes children who make a nuisance of themselves during Christmas or other church holidays when one is supposed to be quiet. Ellen has one such story. Altogether, Ellen Utsi's repertoire contains twenty-nine legends and memorates. Ten of them are personal narratives, retelling her own, her father's or her grandfather's experiences. This indicates that stories were traded and shared in Ellen's family environment. Berit Anne Blind's Repertoire Ellen's sister, Berit Anne, is a beautiful old lady with a vivid personality which shows through when she tells her stories. While narrating, she gesticulated, pointed out of the window, laughed in exhilaration at her memories, or shook her head in disbelief over something she could not understand or did not like. To be photographed, she put on her Sami cap: "I'll put on my cap so that I get to be a Sami," she said. While doing so, she sang a Finnish hymn (see Figure 3). Berit Anne did not know where Ellen got her stories from. Their father was a good storyteller, she said, but she herself did not remember any of these stories. "I don't think such stories are true, for they are not of God. People made them up, they are not in the Bible," she told me. "Therefore I don't think that they are true stories." I asked her whether it is sinful to tell or read such stories, and she replied, "Well, it must be sinful since they are not words of God. It is not right to tell stories and tales that are not God's own words. One does not get to heaven with these stories." Berit Anne is deeply religious and reads her Bible regularly in spite of her considerable age. "I know the Scripture so well that I know what it says," she asserted. She expressed strong opinions on right and wrong and what the correct understanding of the Scriptures is. In this context, for example, she is strongly opposed to remarriage. She has interpreted some stories in her repertoire in accordance with her Christian faith, notably stories about revenants, evil spirits, and magic. According to her Christian world-view, it is of primary importance that folk tales are not from God, and she declined to comment further on Ellen's repertoire. In answer to the question of whether the young Ellen was a true Christian, she replied evasively that she probably was. Folklorists use the word "stories" as a collective term for folk tales, legends, memorates, and personal narratives. But for Berit Anne, the word "stories" means folk tales and she underscores that they are not true.

To avoid confusion, I shall use the word "narrative" to cover both categories while discussing Berit Anne's reper- toire. Narratives about Ghosts and Revenants Ellen's repertoire had included four personal narratives about ghosts, one from her grandfather and three from her own experiences; she also had one narrative about a girl who came back from her grave because she had been unjustly treated. So I asked Berit Anne if it was true that dead people can appear to the living. In her answer, and in the examples she gave to support her opinion, she</page><page sequence="13">An Encounter with Two Sami Narrators 59 appealed to faith in God. She created meaning, and interpreted experience, within the framework of her Christian faith, which was the core of her world- view: Many people have experienced seeing dead people, but God does not show them to everyone, because one has to be mentally strong ... It is scary to think that a person who shows him or herself after death cannot be a child of God. It must be the Devil's spirits who show him to the living ... the Devil's spirits, because the dead person is not able to show himself for others, because his body is decomposed ... It is the Devil's spirits. It seems that Berit Anne believes that God decides who is strong enough to see the dead, but that it is the Devil's spirits who actually show the dead to the living. She also thinks that people who have lived an indecent, ungodly life are prone to experience ghosts and revenants: "Ungodly people are those who do not live according to God's will and words," she said. Neither the interpreter nor I probed deeper into Berit Anne's "theology," but let her narratives and opinion about the experiences speak for themselves. In connection with another question concerning knowledge of how to inflict evil on others with the help of magic, she gets back to the question of "ghosts," which she defines as the appearance of a dead person's spirit: One should not take fright when one sees a balddonas [Saimi word for ghost]. If one takes fright, the ghost will scare even more. They used to tell at the Heights, and Isak and Mattis used to be there too. He [Isak] used to tell that they heard ghosts, but Isak was not afraid, never. But Mattis, he would have taken fright if he had been there alone, he would have run away, he said. This Isak, he did not get scared, he was brave even if he heard some- thing ... and that's right, I say, and my husband Jonah said so too, one should not give room for the fright. Because he [Jonah] used to see things, and he told that once when he was wandering along the road there was a sick person in the vicinity. And all of a sudden there was a lot of people in front of him, many of them. They call them "overtakers." But Jonah did not give them any room on the road, he did not move out of the way, and they used to say that one should not give them any room or let them pass. To the question of who they were, Berit Anne replied that they were evil spirits: Because there was a sick person around there, and probably it was his spirits, and Jonah used to say that one should not give way when one sees something incomprehensible or frightening. If you do, they will scare you so much that you will run right into death. The late Mattis said so too, they [Isak and Mattis] were in the vicinity of this mountain when they heard the ghost. Mattis got so scared that he tried to run away, but Isak detained him. Mattis said himself that he was so scared that he could easily have run away, he felt that quick-footed. The interplay in this narrative demonstrates how an orally transmitted story strengthens world-view: a personal experience narrative which clearly belongs to family lore is strengthened by her own husband's experiences. Experience and story are interpreted according to her Christian faith, which in its turn is strengthened by the experience and story. To Inflict Evil and Release from Evil Magic Ellen Utsi had had a couple of narratives about Sami shamans, noaidies, so Berit</page><page sequence="14">60 Ann Helene Bolstad Skjelbred Anne was asked if it was a fact that some people had the ability to inflict evil on others. "Oh, yes, but those are noaidies, regular people have no knowledge of this." "But how do they do it?": about Sara they used to say that she knew how to inflict evil on others through beverages. She could destroy people. But that is entirely wrong and such people will never get to Heaven ... Sara, she used to when she poured coffee, never to do it right there at the table. Not even from the milk jug. No, she brought every single cup with her into the next room and poured the milk there. That's how she was. Berit Anne got quite agitated when telling about Sara and her powers and had many narratives to tell about her and about people she had hurt with her black magic; one narrative was followed by another. The interpreter complimented her on her narratives and her competence as a narrator. She answered by evaluating her narratives within the context of her Christian faith: It is terrible to think that people do such things, it is inhuman to inflict evil on other people. By doing so they ruin themselves as well, because they sell their soul to the Devil-and by doing that they can never get to Heaven. Unburied Children In other narratives, however, the dominant context is not her Christian faith. She had, for instance, several narratives about the ghost of an unburied child: In former times there were many such ghosts. My grandfather saw one once. A narrative Britt once told was that while they were picking cloudberries, one of the children pointed in the direction of an old and abandoned reindeer sleigh and somebody started crying. That was a ghost of an unburied child. This Berit and her children started walking towards Kautokeino while the screaming ghost followed. But when the church tower came into sight, the crying stopped. This narrative was one of the family repertoire. Ellen had told the same story to Just Qvigstad, without any reference to their grandfather. Her story is more elaborate in detail, but the content is the same. She and Berit Anne had another story, likewise from their grandfather. In a third narrative from their common repertoire, she gives advice about how to deal with the ghost. The best method is to baptise the murdered child by saying the Lord's Prayer backwards, otherwise any person who meets the ghost will be bewitched. Berit Anne commented, "But who can say the Lord's Prayer backwards when you're scared? It's so difficult ... the Lord's Prayer backwards." She had a clear opinion of why there were so many ghosts of unburied children in the olden days. Instead of a religious frame of reference, she is now giving a social perspective: The laws were so strict at that time, that when a woman had a child out of wedlock, they put her in jail while the men went free. That is why the women buried their babies in the woods to avoid jail. But many were imprisoned, the laws were that strict. Stories About the Fairies "Is it possible to get to see the fairies?" I asked. "Oh yes," she retorted:</page><page sequence="15">An Encounter with Two Sdmi Narrators 61 I saw the fairies once when I herded the reindeer. I was together with a friend who had gone to retrieve some of the herd that we had lost. All of a sudden I saw a herd of reindeer coming over a hill, only the horns were visible over the edge. I thought it was my friend coming back and started running to meet him. But when I got there, the herd of reindeer had disappeared. Ellen had once also seen a herd of reindeer, and she knew that they belonged to the fairies because of their large horns and ears. This herd disappeared too. Her evaluation was that both herds belonged to the fairies. This type of narrative is confusingly similar to narratives in Norwegian tradition about beasts, horses, sheep and goats. That the animals belong to the fairies is clear from their colour and size or because they are better fed than their own. Berit Anne had another narrative about a man who threw his knife over a fairy cow, and then it was his: Later the fairy came to him and accused him of ruining her cow because he had milked it with an iron bucket instead of a wooden bucket. And she took her cow with her. This narrative is not identical to Ellen's story about the fairy cow. The bucket motif may indicate a poignant difference between the Norwegian farmers and the Samis. The fairy justifies and upholds Sami tradition; she retrieved the cow because it was milked in a non-Sami bucket. Narratives about Spirits To the question whether it is a positive experience to hear or see a vardoger, an apparition of a living person as a premonition of the person's actual coming, in contrast to the negative experience of seeing the spirit of a dead person, Berit Anne expressed doubt, but told a personal experience story: I was lying in our tent when I heard Nils walking right outside. The tent canvas rattled and I even heard him joik [semi-vocal chant]. For a while I didn't hear anything at all and did not understand ... After a while Nils came in, he touched the tent canvas with the same sound as I heard before and he even joiked. Berit Anne was of the opinion that those who saw such spirits were not destined to live a long life. Yet, her sister Ellen had seen such a spirit and she had lived till she was eighty-six years old. Conclusion-Ellen and Berit Anne: Narratives, Language and Context The repertoires of the two sisters differ in some respects and are similar in others. The main difference is, of course, that Ellen's repertoire contains a relatively large number of folk tales, which are not part of Berit Anne's repertoire. Even if she had remembered them, she would not have transmitted them because they were not "true," and therefore not in accordance with the Scripture. When it comes to personal stories, however, their repertoires coincide to a high degree, which surely indicates that these stories were told, heard and transmitted in their family circle. Family narratives, confirmed by the life events of both sisters, were defined as experiences, not just "untrue" stories like folk tales. There is a difference, too, in the style and context of the sisters' narrations.</page><page sequence="16">62 Ann Helene Bolstad Skjelbred Oral performance gives Berit Anne's narratives colour and depth. Ellen's per- sonal style of narrating is not known. Members of her family relate that she had an impish way of telling stories, [6] but this characteristic is not reflected in the printed texts. The style seems prosaic and indicates a distance from the original oral narrative style. The stories were originally written down in Saimi and then translated into Norwegian, and presented by Just Qvigstad. There is no significant difference between the narrative style in which Ellen's stories are presented and that of stories told by other informants in Qvigstad's collection. They all have the collector's mark. Above all, when compared to those of Berit Anne, Ellen's stories lack context. Thus, there are few clues for an understanding of Ellen's personality and how she evaluated her own stories. This is all the more obvious when we consider the various contexts in which Berit Anne places her stories-religion, social life, her opinions as to how and why some people show themselves as spirits, and how others have the ability to see what is hidden. For Just Qvigstad and other collectors of his time, the informant and the informant's opinions were of no interest. Tradition was not a tool to understand the informants' world-views, or their evaluations of themselves or life in general. The effect of this is that, while Ellen herself is silhouetted rather anonymously against her rich repertoire of tales and stories, Berit Anne's opinions of her stories, and her reflections on life in general, come distinctly forward through her stories. Above all, her constant refrain, "these stories will not lead you to heaven," together with her thoughts on right and wrong, place her in a religious context. Likewise, her personal experiences of ghosts, spirits and fairies tell something about Berit Anne as an individual and the role her stories play in her understanding of life.
