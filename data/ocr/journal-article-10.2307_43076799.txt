Madrid, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, 2000. xvii-764 p. 17,2 x 24,8. Several works are available on wine, vines, grapes, and other associated prod- ucts in the Ancient World, especially the Ancient Orient. The present author, J.- A. Zamora, has produced such a monograph in respect of Ancient Ugarit in the Late Bronze Age. Some articles exist on particular aspects of these matters, but this is the first comprehensive monograph, entitled Vine and wine in Ugarit. The book consists of Contents and Abbreviations (pp. ix-xii), Preface (pp. 1-8), Introduction (pp. 9-48), and five chapters: I. The vineyard (pp. 49-182); II. The vine and its fruits (pp. 183-225); III. Vintage and wine production: Must, wine and vinegar (pp. 227-322); IV. Handling wine: Storage and circulation (pp. 323-502); V The uses of wine: Consumption and ideology (pp. 503-645). Then follow the Summary and conclusions (647-686). The very large Bibliography is given on pp. 689-734 and the Indices are on pp. 725-764. The text has illustrations taken from vine-growing, wine-producing, and wine-drinking scenes from Ugarit, Mesopotamian and mostly Egyptian stelae, paintings, and other il- lustrative material. Note that every chapter can be treated as a separate monograph, with its own concerns and discussions. From the Preface we learn that all existing text editions from Ugarit are famil- iar to the author, and the book proper begins with the Introduction. Here Zamora deals with the general history of viticulture, as well as the origins of wine making, concluding that in the Syro-Palestinian area it began no later than in the fourth mil- lennium BCE. He also writes about the vine in Ebla, Mari, and Emar in the second millennium bce in addition to Ugarit. This was connected with the terracing of the hill slopes in the Eastern Mediterranean. But as Zamora points out, the bulk of the written information comes from Ugarit. In the first chapter the author deals with the geographical background of the kingdom of Ugarit, although a very important work on viticulture (J. Weullersse, Les pays des Alaouites , Tours 1940) is missing here. In general, Zamora covers the area where the annual rainfall is between 400 and 800 mm. The high value and price of the vineyards, as the author points out on p. 54, are evident from the bibli- cal passages 1 Kings 21 and Isaiah 5:1. In the Ugaritic texts, the vineyard is designated by the word krm, the terraces by the word šdmt (p. 62). In Akkadian the vineyard is designated as a.šá g,šgeštin = eqel karãni, as we see from PRU IV, 18.01:5. But other terminological variants exist also, for real as well as mythological vineyards figure in the respective texts. As for non-literary writing, the author investigates the administrative and economic texts dealing with vineyards and wine. A number of maps are added to the book, showing the hortological situation. In treating the distribution of the vineyards and wine the author notes various villages of the kingdom, with frequent mention of Riš, Akkad. Ri/e-šu (Index, p. 739). The author always reads the name as Ra'šu, which is contrary to the Uga- ritic and Akkadian spelling. (For the Ugaritic texts we follow the numeration of M. Dietrich, O. Loretz, and J. Sammartin, The Cuneiform Alphabetic Texts from Ugarit [2nd ed., Münster 1995], which are designated KTU or CAT and coincide with Zamora's desig-</page><page sequence="2">322 Recensiones nations.) We cannot always accept the author's interpretation of the Ugaritic terms, an example being the word gt , which is translated "finca", "estate". This term, and its Akkadian counterpart dimtu, has a broader sense. It is an oil- or winepress, but also an elementary unit of the royal estate, dispersed over the kingdom; also, in in- dividual cases gt-dimtu may be a building for various economic purposes (M. Heltzer, " Dimtu- gt-pyrgos: An Essay about the Non-Etymological Sense of these Terms", JNSL 1 [1979] 31-35; Heltzer, "Again about the gt in Ugarit", UF 31 [1999] 193-198). Nor do we concur with the author when he treats the verb ř rb on- ly as a "guarantee". Accordingly, in KTU 4.103:45 we read [ tlť'.šdm.d.n'rb.gt.npk , which Zamora translates "[three] fields, which were given as a guarantee to the es- tate of the spring". It seems to be more simple: "[three] fields which entered the gt of Napaki(ma) (the 'spring' or 'source')". The meaning is that three fields given for royal service were bound to a certain gt , and they had to deliver their produce for storage and further processing for this gt. Another question concerns the im- portant term ubdy/updt , which is always connected with fields and vineyards. Among others, we find this term associated with vineyard in the tablet KTU 4.244 (this form also appears in other texts concerning fields: šdm). The term is of Hittite (or Hurrian) origin, and mostly designates land allotments for certain service to the authorities. But Zamora treats it as rented land (pp. 85 ff.) (M. Heltzer, "Zum Steuersystem in Ugarit (pilku-ubdy und Ähnliches)", AfO Beiheft 19 [1982] 112- 120). On pp. 91 ff. and in the whole monograph the term kbd is not to be under- stood as "heavy", as it was many years ago, but according to M. Liverani (note 286) as a connection or a summing element. Zamora does not consider the more recent explanation of the term by P. Bordreuil ("Kbd 'ensemble' dans les textes al- phabétiques d'Ugarit", SEL 2 [1985] 89-92), namely that it means "together" and is a kind of summing-up, especially in economic texts. Yet we must agree with Zamora (p. 102 and throughout the monograph) when he repeatedly states that there was an effective system of administrative control over the possession and ownership of the vineyards and their production, as there was over the distribution of the produce of this branch of economy. The author states that krm "vineyard" is also the sense of a land measure (pp. 110-120). In KTU 4.282 and 4.642 the terms šd krm , liter, "field of vineyard", appear, and in certain texts the word šd "field" means a measuring unit. The same applies to the land-measuring units sir and kmsk. The present state of our sources does not allow the calculation of any exact figures for the size of these plots. Finally, mlth is not a land measure, but a unit of capacity, as it is seen in several texts. For example, KTU 4.337 shows the mlth to be a part of kkr "talent" (also KTU 4.304, 4.778:7, etc.). The author is quite right in stating that vineyards, like other land plots, were distributed as service-lands for various bnš mlk "royal (service) men" (pp. 127-138). Sometimes lands, including vineyards, were sold too, but we cannot calculate the size of the vineyards nor their price. We know also, as Zamora notes, that at the gť s, i.e. units of the royal estate, there were also vineyards and we know about the work on them. The Ug. unt = Akk. unuššu(-pilku) was the service obligation (p. 127), including delivery of wine from individual vineyards to royal stores, and also exemptions from this obligation by the royal authority in certain cases. The author of the book writes about the division of the produce for local and palace consumption.</page><page sequence="3">Recensiones 323 The production of alcoholic drinks was not limited to wine; there were also varieties of beer (šikaru) (pp. 145-149). The vineyards are also mentioned in inter- national documents; there were disputes over them with Siannu and Beruta (p. 149). Still, the material is sparse, but from nowhere else in the Ancient Orient do we have even this information about vines and wine that we possess from Uga- rit. Naturally, Zamora uses the biblical material, as well as Egyptian paintings, Hit- tite texts, the Mari archive, and some material from classical Greece. The author begins Chapter II with a general introduction to the Ancient Ori- ent, and then turns to the vine ( gpn ) and grape ( ģnb ) (p. 190-192). He uses the data from the literary texts of Ugarit. The book sets forth a number of supposed terms concerning work with the vine, but only the term bnš gt "men (pl. st. estr.) of the gf speaks about the work- ing personnel of the royal estates (pp. 204-205). Then we read about various prod- ucts obtained from grapes. Besides those such as smqm "raisins" there is aqhr "ice" (p. 218), which remains doubtful, ft, translated as "dried figs", we know now to be ša-i-tu in the Akkadian of Ugarit, and it is a unit of measure, possibly of Egyptian origin, originally Vn of a deben. But in Ugarit it was a larger amount than 8.5 grams, and was used for liquids (M. Heltzer, "Trade between Egypt and West- ern Asia: New Metrologici Evidence", JESHO 37 [1994] 318-321). Chapter III starts off with wine and must, and Zamora skilfully combines the terms in Ugaritic and Akkadian documents, giving parallels about wine-making from other Ancient Oriental countries (pp. 229-240). We do not know exactly if trt is "fresh wine" or "juice" or "must", but in fact everything is connected with yn , Canaanite ye-nu. The respective terms in Akkadian are analyzed, including the Greek oinos &lt; ( w)oinos . As the author points out (pp. 274-76), the vine and wine- making were important elements of the culture of the peoples of the Caucasus, Eastern Anatolia, the Levant, and the Aegean area. Regarding quantities of wine, the real capacity of the measuring units has to be noted, not only that listed in the texts from stores and presses where wine was preserved. In fact, the measuring unit of liquids was the Ith . This is important for understanding the whole problem of the measures of grain, flour, and wine. KTU 4.751 tells us that the mdrģlm- guards received for a special meal "one lamb" (line 3 : š ahd) and a Ith of flour {Ith qmh ), and this proportion coincides with the proportions of the biblical offering, where for the consumption of one lamb 1 * issa - rõn of flour is given. The ř issarõn is V'o of a bat or kad. The Hebrew and Phoe- nician kd had the capacity of about 22.5 liters. Likerwise the ř issarõn , as well as the Ugaritic Ith , had the capacity of about 2.2 liters (M. Heltzer, "The Ugaritic Ith and the Biblical f issarõn ", Shnaton, An Annual for Biblical and Ancient Oriental Studies 7-8 [1984] 159-162 [Hebrew, Engl, summary]; idem, "Der ugaritische Text KTU 4.751 und das Festmahl(?) der Dienstleute des Königs", UF 12 [1980] 410- 412; idem, "Some Questions of Ugaritic Metrology...", UF 21 [1989] 195-208 with all literature concerning the Ith and kd and the early Greek amphorae). All considerations about the quality of the wines are naturally mostly spec- ulative, and their being indicated in other countries and cultures does not help much (pp. 286-290). Some terms, such as yn tb "good wine", yn Itb "not(?) good wine", yn hlq "spoiled wine", yn msb "stored wine", or possibly "old wine", are indubitable. But others have no satisfactory or certain interpretation. Possibly hmr was an alcoholic drink (p. 308), and this word may be connected with fermentation, as well as kaš.geštin, which means a fermented drink or a certain kind of beer(?).</page><page sequence="4">324 Recensiones One of the products of wine is vinegar, Ugaritic hms. Sometimes vinegar ap- pears in ration lists ( hpr ) for workers, who were bnš mlk (st. estr. plur, "royal men") (pp. 131-320). Various wine-products, together with other ingredients and salt {mlh), were also used for medico-magical purposes (KTU 1.175 :6). Chapter IV deals with the storage of wine and its products. First appear the amphorae, and apart from the excavated wine-vessels we know of labels inscribed on clay tablets, sometimes added to the amphorae (KTU 6, 11). Zamora states that there were wine-cellars, with facilities for stacking and preservation. Giving a num- ber of examples about the storage of wine, mostly from Egypt, the author con- cludes that in Ugarit the place was the É geštinmeš (p. 337) "House of wine". Of the administrative and economic documents of Ugarit, 58% (pp. 339 ff.) concern the villages of the kingdom. Among them KTU 4.279 speaks only about the distribution of jars {kd yn st. estr. plur.) of wine. Such texts in the royal stores were written more or less at the moment of their delivery, but from this and other texts Zamora concludes that the store-houses were royal ones. Another text pre- sented by the author lists "jars" ( kd) of wine together with personal names, but also with the names of two villages (Šbn and Amy). This is not the delivery to the store but the receipt by the store. Everything is measured by the kd , but, as we know, this is equal to the Hebrew bt , and in the seventh century bce the word kā- dos entered Greek and the Greek world too. As stated above, the kd is taken to measure approximately 22.5 liters. But not all capacity measures are clear to us, nor are they to Zamora, for example the sp, kwt and others. The hbr (KTU 1.23: 76) may indeed be a "vat", but its sizes remain unknown (DLU 1:72, hbr II). Still, the distribution of wine was clearly individual, collective (by various groups), and religious (for offerings and cultic banquets). In KTU 4.93 ( spr ytnm) at least 113 persons are named; the other figures show that the number of the kds of one individual was 1-4 and the total amount of wine was 448 jars (dug g,šgeštin). Yet it is not clear if the people received the wine or delivered it to the royal stores. But here too Zamora reduces the volume of the kd = dug. The same applies regarding the other Ugaritic texts on the distribution of wine to various group of professionals. The author may well be translating the word mštt (KTU 4.230:5) correctly, comparing it to the Hebrew mišteh (p. 375) "drinking feast". In fact, KTU 4.123 concern deliveries by various persons of oil, wine, and other products, but on its second register (lines 16-23) has words not always con- nected with wine but rather designating garments (nps), a small vessel (spi), and possibly a pair of pincers ( mqhm ). The author occasionally exaggerates when speaking about wine. PRU III, 10.44 is most likely a damaged text about tithe payments from vari- ous villages of the kingdom to the royal stores, including grain, wine, and oxen. It can be compared with KTU 4.400 (p. 418), which is a store-list of various gť s with diverse products, including wine. This list was compiled by the central author- ity of the royal estate to know the state of the store at least for five gť s. One of the most important texts for learning about the amount of wine in the royal stores of Ugarit is KTU 4.213 concerning 12 gť s. The number of the jars of wine of various qualities, as Zamora calculates, is 1881. Taking ajar as 22.5 liters, we find more than 4500 liters, and not the figure given by the author. Even if we assume that wine stores were not located on every gt, their number was certainly</page><page sequence="5">Recensiones 325 many more than 12 nevertheless. We may suppose that tens of thousands of liters were in annual circulation in Ugarit. The closing register of this text shows that at least a portion of this wine was given for offering dbh (line 24) and for mdrģlm - guards (line 29) and (sheep)-shearers ( gzzm ) (line 30) (pp. 424-431). As Zamora notes further, this text provides rich material for other conclusions and observa- tions. The author devotes space to determining which months were connected with wine-making and other operations with wine (pp. 467-71). At the end of the chap- ter Zamora tries to localize the "wineries" and (p. 473/4) adds two maps of the royal palace of Ugarit and the Ras-Shamra tell, showing the places presumably connected with wine. An important section of the book concerns commerce in wine (pp. 475 ff.). The author reviews the places where the wine of Ugarit could be exported to, namely the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean. The river route of the Eu- phrates was also used. The author takes into consideration the underwater excava- tions of the Gelidonia, Ulu-Burun, and the deep-water eastern Mediterranean wreck, where the intricate excavations are in their primary stage. He sets out the texts on navigation, some of which, describing the ships' cargoes, could be about wine. The tamkars of Ugarit - merchants and mostly royal trade-agents - played a very important role in international trade, as the author points out. The recently discovered archive of Urtenu (p. 485), which is yet to be published, will afford us much additional information. The internal wine-trade is not overlooked. From KTU 4.219:1-10, Zamora con- cludes that one kd "jar" of wine had the price of 2/i of a shekel, namely less than 3 gr of silver. Despite the existence of other texts about the wine trade (pp. 495-497), there is no way to calculate the prices. The author indeed agrees with the opinion expressed independently by Liverani and Heltzer that everything concerning wine was under centralized control, and mostly concentrated at the royal gť s. The use of wine in connection with ideology is discussed in the last chapter (V). Archeology adds a great deal here. The rhyta attest to drinking banquets, and the word msk means "mixing" of wine; the example is taken by the author from Greek civilization. But the question still remains open (p. 510). The author analyzes at length the meaning of the words designating various drinking vessels (pp. 514- 534). On the following pages we read about the service-personnel at the drinking banquets. Hardly anything linked to the drinking of alcohol and banquets escapes the scrupulous attention of the author. He has much to say about drunkenness at the banquets at Ugarit (pp. 539 ff). He speaks in general about the symposia in early Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Assyria, using the iconographie material of these coun- tries. Then he turns to the banquet in Ugarit, known from literary sources. The main text here is KTU 1.114, where we read that even the chief god of Ugarit, II (//w), was drunk at the feast meal of the gods. The culmination of the feast meal was the sacrifice ritual. The gods appear at the banquet in an anthropomorphic im- age. Intoxication at the banquet (drinking feast) is considered a normal feature. But the banquet is also deemed a social event in several aspects. Women, as we see from the mythic and epic texts, had their role in preparing the banquet, as well as participating in it. Another social factor is the hospitality connected with banquets and drinking. In the Aqht ( Dnil) epic (1,17:1, 25-33) we read that Dn'il needs the help of his son (heir) in his drunkenness.</page><page sequence="6">326 Recensiones Wine drinking was also connected with love and sex. The author shows that also in Egypt we know of drunken women. Again, some incidents coincide with the Greek symposia , but in Rome sometimes the drinking feasts ended with mur- der. Diplomacy was often accompanied by drinking (p. 592), but sometimes the vineyards of two states, in this case Ugarit and Siannu, caused diplomatic conflicts (PRU IV, 17.344, p. 593). The cult of wine is also connected with the fertility be- liefs. Iconography and glyptic, according to the author, attest to this from the third millennium bce, in the Middle Bronze period, in Ugarit also. Also indicated are cultic associations mrzh , known throughout the Syro-Pal- estinian region until Roman times; these too are connected with drinking alcohol. In all these matters the author provides numerous examples from Ugarit and the Ancient Near East in general. In his Conclusions (pp. 647-686) Zamora sums up the whole book, which may be called the real opus magnum , concerning not only the vine, the vineyard, wine- making, its by-products, wine consumption, and all the cultic acts, but also the reli- gious significance of wine. The philological analysis is accurate, despite the fact that unfortunately we have no definite answer to some obscure terms. But the main shortcoming of the book is its treatment of the metrology, which is not based on any actual findings of the work of a number of scholars. We would like to hope that the author will correct this omission. None of this belittles the major positive impact of this book, which should as- sist all scholars in the fields of Ugaritic studies and the Ancient Orient in general to clarify and understand many question in the economic, social, literary, and reli- gious life in the area in the given time.
