<plain_text><page sequence="1">Review Article Long-Run Lamentations: Braudel on France* Steven Laurence Kaplan Cornell University Fernand Braudel treats the history of France incidentally in his celebrated La Mediterrane'e et le monde mediterraneen a l'epoque de Philippe 11 and in his Civilisation materielle, economie et capitalisme and directly in his recent L'identite de la France, part of which appeared posthumously. He came to the latter project with both delectation and trepidation. His history of France was the first major enterprise that Braudel freely chose to undertake: the other works were commissions in one sense or another.1 Inspired by a sense of civic duty and a kind of filial piety, intensified by the guilt accruing from his half-century of intellectual expatriation,2 this project was the chance for him to demonstrate his love of France, "a demanding and complicated passion" that he compared to Michelet's. But this very passion provoked malaise in the historian. Passion was, to be sure, one mode of approach. The native son "understands his history almost instinc- tively, the detours, the twists and turns, the originalities, the weaknesses."3 This visceral demarche was, however, replete with pitfalls: complaisance, superfici- ality, trivialization. Braudel aimed to write first as a professional historian preoccupied with the exigencies of the craft and only afterward as citizen and patriot.4 Yet it is clear that he himself worried about sustaining the separation- witness his reiterated renunciations and antiseptic engagements (e.g., "For I mean to speak of France as if it were another country"), undercut repeatedly by his tendency to cast the world in binary terms: nous vis-a-vis the others, a bit like the sportscaster of an international match unable to conceal in myriad small ways his predilection for his nation's team.S As a professional historian celebrated for codifying the new history, Braudel had other reasons to fret about doing a history of France.

Nations per se were abstrac- tions if not accidents, radically disjointed and epitomized versions of an infinitely more complex whole. Economically and culturally, Braudel had repeated time and again, it made no sense to speak of France outside the context of Europe, of a given world economy, of a larger system of relations. For Braudel, "there is only global history." How could one "totalize" within the confines of the hexagon whose ramparts Braudel had so ardently campaigned, Joshua-like, to tear down?6 It goes without saying that Braudel would have been intellectually and morally incapable of isolating France from the larger constellations and systems to which I adverted. The identity of France is to be sought in a European framework ("Europe is our family, our condition of being"), even if Braudel occasionally regrets the high cost of France's "total opening to Europe" ("we are its prisoners") and steadfastly acknowledges a tension between national and Euro- pean interests.7 But the crucial buffers and/or compensations for the risks of parochialism are methodological: first, an "interscientific" mode of attack, Braudel's conception of history as an inherently interdisciplinary undertaking incorporating anthropology, sociology, political science, psychology, mentalites, economics, demography, geography;8 second, and decisively, an articulation of the investigation across the long run. A geohistory in the style of La Mediterra- nee, L' identite de la France nevertheless pivots on time even more than on space. Braudel's long run permits us to distinguish "the essential from the accessory," opening the true path to an understanding of identity. A history of "the very slow changes that demand centuries to be realized" -twenty thousand centuries in Braudel's modest compass-the long run is the only "history in real depth, which the habitual chronicles obscure." But the long run is as much a history of continuities as one of change-indeed, in many ways much more so. The real key to the past lies in uncovering the "regles tendancielles" and the "repetitions" that mark the unfolding of social experience.9 The long-run purview has important implications, epistemological and philosophical without question, but perhaps also political and cultural. First, the dense imbrication of past and present-or perhaps past, present, and future.1o The long-run vantage reveals how intimately linked are present and past (the remote past even more so than the recent);" it enables and, indeed, even requires one to overcome the "obstacles, the hills, the mountains, the ruptures, the differences." To understand the vocation of the "second market" in 1983, Braudel traces the rivalry between Lyon and Paris back to the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. From the fairs of Champagne in the thirteenth century, he effortlessly shifts to the farmers-general of the late seventeenth century, to the Rothschilds of the nineteenth century, to the merchant 6 Ibid., 1:12; Ewald and Brochier, p. 19.

To take the measure of the ongoing disparities between north and south, Braudel returns to the seventh millennium. 12 The past "aggresses" the present so brutally that in some ways the proper relation of the past to the present is one of oppression rather than progression. Nevertheless, the past helps to demystify the present, to render it both more intelligible and less threatening, in part by underlining its relative ephemerality or likely tentativeness and its profound incompleteness. 13 This perspective permits a certain optimism about vexed issues such as the immigration-racism code of nationality dilemma; or about France's apparent future inability to support the increasingly crowded ranks of the aged because of a dearth of young people;14 or about the deeply dislocating and disturbing cultural change and iconoclasm that seem to menace Western civilization and that provoke commensurately extreme and dangerous reactions. 15 Over against the bleak scenarios extrapolated from the recent past Braudel urges a more probing, longer, more sober look across history, across the vast cycles of ebb and flow that warrant more sanguine projections. (Yet the deep past also reinforces a strain of pessimism about the future-in particular, Braudel's anguished sense that the current economic crisis, much more intensely felt for the last decade in France than in the United States, is fundamentally different from previous ones, such as the "Hiroshima" of the fourteenth century, despite its familiar Malthusian pall.)16 Reciprocally, Braudel grants that the present influences-indeed, shapes-one's relation to the past. His own life abounds in specific encounters-with Algeria, Brazil, Lucien Febvre, etc.-and more broadly felt experiences-the great depression, the development of the welfare state, fascism, decolonization, medical breakthroughs, technological innovations (from the first automobiles and airplanes to the first nuclear plants, computers, and robotized factories), the staggering pullulation of the tertiary sector, the stubborn resistance of the "peasant economy" and its apparently abrupt demise a short time ago-that impinge upon his reading of the past. 17 Second, the long run offers the devastating yet strangely soothing realization of our relative helplessness. It teaches that the die has long been cast, that in many domains, regardless of one's "voluntarist" and Panglossian illusions, France's destiny was "irreversibly" fixed.'8 History is repetitive, laconic, unfair, and above all, intransigent. Though contemporaries then and later had no inkling of this in most cases, they had become mere spectators in the great contests. "This history comes from so far off . . . doesn't it limit (I do not say suppress) both the liberty and the responsibility of men?" asks Braudel rhetorically. The idea of the 12 Ibid., 1:262; 2:27. 13 Ibid., 1:94.

In the last sentence of the last volume of his history of France that we are to have, in tones more priestly than merely avuncular, Braudel offers us reassurance and absolution for our existential derisoriness: men "hardly make history, it is history, above all history, that makes them, and in so doing exonerates them."'19 "History is man," expounded Lucien Febvre. Braudel departed from his mentor in a significant way: history, he believed, "is man and [all] the rest." It seemed to him that "the rest" tended to overwhelm man, but there was a constant tension in his mind between man and the rest, between a kind of free will and a sort of historical fatalism. Braudel envisioned his history of France in four parts. The first two, both of which were published, he called Espace et histoire and Les hommes et les choses. They treated geography, demography, and economic structure and practice. This was the history clearly dominated by "the rest." It was "France held in tow . . . in a word, the France which is subjected to [or suffers]" forces beyond the ken and control of French men and women. The second part was to deal with "State, Culture, Society" and with "France beyond Its Own Borders" (or "France above and beyond Herself"). This is presumably where Braudel would have redressed the balance somewhat and restored a large draft of voluntarism, the past in which man resisted and even dominated, partially and provisionally, the rest.20 What precise route Braudel intended to navigate between Scylla and Charybdis we will never know, for he did not complete the last two segments of the project. We are "condemned," as Braudel might have phrased it, to reflect on L' identite de la France that is truncated, amputated, unbalanced. Of all the qualities that constitute Frenchness for Braudel across the long run, the most striking are a genius for missed opportunities and a gift for (relative) failure. France experienced missed opportunities and failures in virtually every domain, but they were especially telling in the economic sphere. Economic growth is the overarching preoccupation of Braudel's lifetime of research. Predictably, it is at the very core of his quest for the identity of France-the scholar's fascination reinforced and quickened by the citizen's bedevilment. For Braudel the Frenchman-like so many others in his generation and most of those that have ensued, on the Left as well as the Right of French society-is obsessed by the process of growth, by the remorseless imperative to develop in order to survive. In this regard more than in any other, past, present, and future are inextricably intertwined. Society's primal task is to grow: there is no salvation outside a vigorously expanding GNP. To succeed, a society must somehow infiltrate or be swept up into capitalist development, a vortex that is politically and nationally disincarnate, autonomous, inexorable despite flux and reflux. It is the sole vector of progress, the only sure way out of the past. 19 Ibid., 3:431. Compare Ewald and Brocher, p. 21: "Marx se trompe plus qu'a moitie quand il dit que les hommes font l'histoire; c'est plus suirement l'histoire qui fait les hommes. Ils la subis- sent." And "L'histoire volontariste, c'est une illusion, une goutte d'eau dans l'ocean" (p. 21). 20 L'identite, 1:19; Ewald and Brochier, p. 19.</page><page sequence="5">Long-Run Lamentations: Braudel on France 345 Capitalist development is a puissant force of liberation and construction, but it is also cruel and Darwinian. Cities and states cannot engender or control it.21 At best, they can favor or inhibit it, and both of these postures impose a hefty price. Yet Braudel's calculus, predicated upon a long-run accounting, is inclined to privilege one category of cost over the other. He is by no means indifferent to the brutal and sordid visage (and outcomes) of capitalism, but he observes dispas- sionately that the price of underdevelopment, globally reckoned, is more exorbitant than the price of exploitation. Exploitation is innate in social life, regardless of the mode of production. Out of the state of nature-for Braudel, a state of primitive self-sufficiency-society is perforce hierarchical, and hierarchy implies domination and subordination.22 But to be passed over by capitalism is to be consigned to the limbo of history-the abode of souls barred from heaven through no (corrigible) fault of their own-but subject nevertheless to certain features of purgatory: the torment of perpetual frustration, unrequited appetite, ulcerating second-guessing, and unremitting humiliation. Now, Braudel's startling command of the long run enables us to see phenomena and relations that would otherwise have escaped our notice. But the by-product of this long-run mastery is the evacuation of essential contingencies. The long run casts the shadow of the "final" outcomes across the whole trajectory of historical experience. From the start, we know the results. Counterfactual speculation seems too painful for Braudel and is in any event an otiose exercise. His discussion bears a heavy telic weight, like a Sisyphean stone that can never attain the summit. Thus Braudel was concerned above all with locating signs of "the modernity of the economy" and with inventorying obstacles or impediments to modernity/modernization. He was not very much engrossed in exploring practices or relations or beliefs or institutions for their intrinsic, lived interest, to see how they worked and how they were perceived and experienced. Sectors and areas that conquer aspects of modernity are styled "progressive," a highly charged label with a political edge and a moral tinge.23 But how does one know that an institution or a way of thinking or doing is an obstacle? Tautology becomes the accomplice of teleology: it is an obstacle because it did not generate or contribute to modernity.24 The whole thrust of Braudel's reading of the past depreciates the role of choice, even of deliberate policy. Thus Colbert's efforts to compensate for a lack of capitalist dynamism are necessarily futile, for he is working with an "insufficient" industrial base.25 Insufficient according to what criterion and for what end? Insufficient vis-a-vis rival entities and vis-a-vis the unfolding long-run timetable; and insufficient to permit Colbert to redress the balance-to catch up with history. 21 On the "exigencies and necessities" of getting into the economic boom, see L'identite, 3:323, and Civilisation, 3:258. 22 L'identite, 1:235. "One ne peut pas etre sans que certains commandent et que d'autres obeissent."

In an eroticized image perhaps meant to suggest the obdurately and perversely chaste bent of France, excessively sage and already vieille fille in the flower of her voluptuous youth, and to underline the necessarily passive and supine relation of the she-society to the virile torrent of capitalist development, Braudel writes that "France was not penetrated by the model, by the requisite passions, by the frantic taste for profit."26 France had moral defects that in another context might easily have passed for graceful virtues. Thus in the sixteenth century Braudel reproaches the French aristocracy, ill programmed for intemational competition, with being "too enamoured of silk, luxurious velvets, pepper and other spices, marble."27 Today as in the past-what bittersweet flattery!-France resembled China too much and Japan not enough.28 The division of the world was fashioned without France, "at her expense."29 While others flourished in its embrace, France was "disadvantaged by the capitalist economy."30 In the early sixteenth century France "botched her imperial career at its very beginning," Braudel notes, because of "her still backward economy, perhaps too because of her tempera- ment. "31 Braudel is not able to decide whether France's marginality is at bottom its own fault or the result of factors and forces that had nothing to do with its desires or intentions. On the one hand "France failed to insert herself into the privileged geography of European capitalism"; on the other hand, European capitalism "neglected" or "excluded" her.32 Of course, France faced redoutable rivals whose prowess cast its own capitalist "immaturity" into stark relief.33 In the seventeenth century France "was literally subjugated by the minuscule [Dutch] Republic of the North," a state of affairs that vexes Braudel only slightly less than it did Louis XIV.34 France could not escape the Dutch yoke for want of a national fleet, a more diversified industrial base, and a powerful capitalist network. It suffered longer and more harshly at the hands of the English, successors to European capitalist hegemony. Braudel writes about the English with the ambivalence of Voltaire: he admires their achievements, which he wishes France had anticipated or emulated, and at the same time he deplores them, for he feels somehow that they endowed the English with an unfair (i.e., an excessively long) comer on world economic domination. In its comforting insularity, England was "sheltered" whereas France was always "vulnerable" in its "openness to Europe."35 Predatory and single-minded, England took advan- 26 Ibid., 3:420. 27 Civilisation, 2:186. 28 Ibid., 2:526. 29 Ibid., 3:276-77. 30 L'identite, 1:20. 31 La Mediterranee, 2:9. 32 L'identite, 1:253. 33 Civilisation, 2:398-99.

But England was no mere bully: it was a virtuoso player, "always a step ahead of the continent" in finance and com- merce.36 At the beginning and end of the eighteenth century, the French revealed themselves to be far less skillful financiers than the English. England had its John Law paroxysm in the South Sea bubble, but the English economy was able to absorb the shock, and the government bailed out the foundering company, while in France "everything disappeared in a single stroke," testimony for Braudel of the underlying problem-an economy "backward in its habits."37 At the end of the century, with a debt bloated but not unreasonably out of proportion to the GNP, the French skidded into error and revolution for want of management skills d l'anglaise.38 Historians commonly point to Trafalgar and Waterloo as marking France's abandonment of the "merchant-exploitation of the world" to England, but Braudel locates the gap much earlier. The contest had been unequivocally decided before the French Revolution, whose importance as a watershed Braudel challenges. France had lost all hope of winning before 1762 (loss of India and Canada), before 1713 (loss of access to the New World attendant upon the War of Spanish Succession), and perhaps as far back as the Elizabethan stabilization of the pound sterling.39 Cultural triumphs always seemed to indemnify France for its economic failures. Thus Parisian art, fashion, and ideas captured London more or less definitively beginning in the eighteenth century, even as they had governed Venice in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, consoling France "for not holding the scepter of the world." Braudel is less proud of these accomplishments than he has a right to be, perhaps because he suspected that this cultural supremacy generated a sort of mystification of self-satisfaction, blinding France to its grave economic inadequacies.40 Long before England's ascendancy, France had a formidable chance to seize control of the world economy and to alter drastically the subsequent pattern of development. This was the episode of the Champagne Fairs in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Braudel insists upon it in all of his works with a poignantly nostalgic sense of missed opportunity. For the "first and last time" in history, France was the "economic center of the western world." Fleetingly France possessed this "treasure" and then lost (squandered?) it, unaware of the long-term significance of the transformation. What a propitious moment for France, whose universities evinced worldwide admiration, whose Gothic style had launched its European conquest, whose monarch had annexed the crusades. Paris at a stone's throw from the European center of gravity! "Had the economic life of Europe been frozen forever at that moment [of French primacy around 1270]," Braudel fantasized tremulously, "there would have resulted a dominant French space 36 L' identite, 3:396. 37 Ibid., 3:405. 38 Civilisation, 3:263. 39 Ibid., 3:38; L'identite, 3:226, 296, 369-70. 40 La Mediterran&amp;e, 1:202-3; Civilisation, 3:53.

But capitalism quickly bypassed France, preferring new sea and land routes from the Mediterranean to the north. Henceforth France was disconnected, encircled, largely hors jeu, destined for "a long eclipse.'"41 An apparent advantage, France's mammoth size, in fact handicapped it in the economic arena. Whereas England was "big enough to form a nation [yet] small enough to unify its economy spontaneously," France was "a monster," "a continent," for centuries "condemned to pay the price of its immensity." Assets such as the Rhone, which ought to have served to pass "the electric current" from north to south, became imperceptibly "frontier, separation, division, obstacle, enemy." Instead of describing the "limits of the possible," France's geography seems to have favored defeat and defeatism, constituting a structure of the impossible. Its size relentlessly strained France's political, military, and financial resources. "France" was hard to domesticate, to organize, to integrate, to protect, to make one. Its sprawling expanse dramatically slowed the emergence of a veritable national market, measure and guarantee of cohesion, which Braudel first placed at the end of the eighteenth century and later postponed till the early railroads.42 Geography was not, however, the sole determinant of the shape of the market system. If a "centralizing political will" was a likely prerequisite, Braudel did not esteem it a sufficient condition. As always, the political ceded to the "deeper" and more compelling etiology-in this instance the "conjuncture." Audacious political/institutional reforms such as the suppression of internal customs spawned "no acceleration of economic life," whereas "when the conjuncture is favorable . . . the economy . . . surmounts all the obstacles." Slipping into a recurrent tautology, Braudel concludes in the end that "economic growth alone was the decisive factor in the extension and consolidation of national markets," which were themselves indispensable agents of economic growth.43 A cause and a consequence of the lagging development of a national market was the persistent north-south cleavage, one of the great leitmotivs and stigmata of French history. Braudel detects the origins of the bifurcation thousands of years before Christ. Apparently as a result of differences in climate, agricultural technology and practices, language, family type, legal custom and jurisprudence, etc., the north industrialized more rapidly and more deeply, urbanized more swiftly and fully, built more and better roads, enjoyed a higher rate of literacy, and earned more income in all sectors (per hectare, per capita, etc.). These disparities continued to burden the state. The north should have experienced even greater industrial development in the nineteenth century, but the state felt constrained to make a political choice that dampened its growth in order to promote national unity by investing in infrastructure (education, communication, administration).44 41 L'identit, 2:132-35, 141; Civilisation, 3:93-94, 276; La Mediterranee, 1:203. An analogous early missed opportunity was France's failure to seize "sea power, the scepter of the world," on the basis of the talent and experience of thousands of Norman and Breton sailors (L'identite, 3:65, 425). 42 L'identite', 1:165, 240, 253; 3:154, 225, 269, 279; Civilisation, 3:247. 43 Civilisation, 3:246-49. 44ELidentite', 1:52, 63, 72, 75, 84, 89; 2:27, 130-31; 3:73, 164, 304.</page><page sequence="9">Long-Run Lamentations: Braudel on France 349 In a voice redolent of the epoch of American sectional strife, Braudel castigates the arrogance of northerners, reminding them that it was not their virtue that accorded them superiority. What was it, then? "History, and history almost on its own," responds Braudel-history as prodigious independent variable, as person- age, as both player and game, as signifier and signified, as structure and structurante.45 Like size, population should have worked in France's favor, and, in fact, for a very long while it did. For centuries France was Europe's most populous state. Braudel regards population as the most critical (and reliable) single indicator in taking stock of a society. His great-cycle schema is articulated in part around mighty demographic swings.46 He consecrates some of his finest and most impassioned prose to the description of the spectacular recovery after the Black Death. He views population as a cause and not merely an effect. Yet he assimilates it to the conjuncture, estranging it from intentionality, apprehending it aggrega- tively, discerning in it a momentum of its own and an autoregulating disposition. Sustained growth from 1450 to 1850 guaranteed France a certain human triumph even if its economy never really took off, for the victory over death was "the major fact . . . of modernity.' 47 Yet in this domain, too, France failed to profit optimally. It betrayed its own interests by rebelling against and deceiving nature: by turning to contraception. In this practice France was for once too early rather than too late; and its precocity tended to aggravate its tardiness elsewhere, with the result that, although France had 15 percent of the European population in 1800, a century later it barely accounted for one-tenth. Over the long run this reaction does not really surprise Braudel, for France had experienced overpopulation as early as the sixteenth century (echoing a strain it had already known in varying degrees in prehistory and in antiquity) and an adjustment was surely ineluctable. Braudel prefers a material to a cultural explanation for the breathtaking decline in fertility. Whatever the causes, the loss of population has been a "catastrophe" for France, "biologically broken down" well before its industrial rivals. In evoking contraception Braudel deploys an image of pathology that bespeaks the intensity of his own feelings: birth control "spreads like a disease" across Western civilization.48 The deficit of population first damaged French competitiveness and later obliged it to import human capital, setting the stage for dire social problems. The formation of human capital depended on carrying capacity. For that reason, grain "was always the dominant personage of our past.' 49 For failing to tame and use this personage efficiently, French society seriously compromised its prospects 45 Ibid., 1:93. Elsewhere Braudel suggests alternatives and corrections to the two-France vision-an east and a west as well as a south; a tripartite split into interior, parts, and north/east cities; and another triple division into a western zone of demographic stagnation stretching from Brittany toward the Jura mountains, and southern and northeastern zones of expansion (Civilisation, 3:287-89, 293). 46 L'identite, 2:12, 122-23, 151. 47 Ibid., 2:153-54. 48 Ibid., 2:171-73, 175, 182-83. 49 Braudel delights in anthropomorphic imagery. The Rh6ne is another "personage." Cities and states "act, in truth, like individuals," like "men." History is personified in several forms (L'identite', 1 :208, 241, 280) .</page><page sequence="10">350 Kaplan for economic growth-though here, too, it is not clear to what extent this failure actually could have been avoided. Cereal dependence constituted France's long-run Bastille, severely limiting its options. Despite magnificent natural resources, agriculture remained backward longer than necessary, and cereal production languished at tragically insufficient levels. Agricultural stagnation extracted an extravagant human cost, hampered political maturation, and sub- verted industrial expansion. So the hoe and the spade retained prestige in France long after they should have lapsed into discredit and desuetude, and France remained an obdurately rural and peasant society until the onset of the "thirty glorious years" after the end of the Second World War.50 The English comparison highlights France's weakness in dealing with money, a point that Braudel stresses again and again. The failure is both public and private, linked to state and institutions on the one hand and to social structure and mentality on the other. France did not develop public institutions of credit until very late in the game. It depended on financiers rather than bankers-that is to say, on court-entrenched agents who tended to wield more or less "archaic" or "traditional" tools and to share in the musty values of the aristocracy. (In this category of obsolete comportment Braudel unfairly confines the "horrid" Paris brothers, a family of financiers far more modem, or Neckerian, than he realized.) At several junctures, with the Protestant megalomaniac Samuel Bemard and the Scottish adventurer-projector John Law, France hovered on the brink of endowing itself with a national bank. Each time "it botched the job" or "lost the chance."'51 In part because the state had manipulated the value of currency opportunistically for hundreds of years, the public was deeply suspicious of any financial "innovation." For this reason the French continued to "accept with some reluctance" the bills issued by the Bank of France during the first part of the nineteenth century.52 That same malaise, fortified by a dreadful fear of impending economic disaster that the state should have been adroit enough to overcome, resulted in gargantuan accumulations of idle money. Replete with "hidden treasures" already in the eighteenth century, by the nineteenth century France had become a veritable "necropolis of precious metals." Despite, or because of, the existence of these huge (passive and sterile) savings, France suffered chronically over the centuries from a dearth of cash and a permanent penury of investment capital. "Of what use," Braudel wonders pathetically, "is blood that does not circulate?"53 Lack of confidence in the state buttressed the aversion to risk inculcated by the value system on which the society reposed. Like Voltaire, Braudel deplores the anticapitalist biases in the social structure, though he recognizes that they were easily surmounted by small numbers of vanguard entrepreneurs of both noble and common stock. The problem was not hierarchical organization: not only is 50 Ibid., 3:10, 11, 13, 118, 156-57, 159, 182-83.

The problem was rather one of ethos. The French taxonomy was built on values that favored investments in land and venal offices-investments that Braudel regards, quite arbitrarily, as retrograde, barren, and spineless. A bit like the physiocrats, Braudel shifts easily from the economic to the moral register of evaluation, and he tends to believe, given the unalterable direction that "History" had taken, that only capitalist activity was truly productive-that is, capable of begetting significant and sustained growth. Braudel could not conceal a mixture of anger and contempt for the French elite, especially the sanior pars of the capital, who also bungled the opportunity to modernize precociously and decisively. Paris failed to pick up where Lyon, celebrated international financial center, left off in the sixteenth century in large measure because "Parisian wealth was mal engagee . . . the proprietor classes [were] too caught up in offices and land, operations socially rewarding, individually lucrative, economically parasitical." For having failed to act in the nation's long-term interests, Braudel administers a world-historical, teleological rebuke. 4 Deeply invested in the system of distinction that regulated French social stratification, the state was equally guilty in Braudel's eyes for failing in its historical responsibilities. Like the elite, the state followed practices he esteems nonproductive or antiproductive. He judges its taxing policies to be inimical to economic development, though recent research is much less pessimistic on this count.55 Moreover, he claims that none of the money drained by the state was reinjected into the "active economy," a contention that strikes me as drastically overdrawn and as testimony to his lack of intimate familiarity with what the state did day-to-day.56 To be effective the state needed to unify the nation, but Braudel chastises it for "too much greediness" in devouring all the cities that might have developed, favored by relative autonomy and the leaven of competition, along Dutch or Italian lines.57 Yet the lack of propulsive urban elan seems to have been due as well to flaws inherent in the cities, defects in attitude and behavior they shared with the nobility.58 On the one hand Braudel reproves venality, quintes- sentially unmodern (and un-Weberian), while on the other he regrets the permanently unfinished character of the state which is understaffed and underad- ministered.59 If Braudel correctly accuses local and regional venal officials of frequently undermining royal will, he errs, in the narrow and reductive fashion of the traditional political/institutional history that he excoriated, by attributing their 54 Civilisation, 3:280; La Mediterranee, 1:199; 2:75. 55 Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, L'etat royal, 1460-1610, Histoire de France-Hachette (Paris, 1987). 56 L'identite, 3:223. Perhaps because he counted on dealing with the state at length in a subsequent volume, Braudel indulges himself in trite generalizations that in other areas he would never have ventured. For example, "La monarchie de Louis XIV est une machine tout a fait au point" (ibid., 1: 176). 57 Ibid., 3:193. 58 Ibid., 3:205, 211. 59 Civilisation, 2:490-91.</page><page sequence="12">352 Kaplan conduct simply to vanity and self-interest.60 Still, the state ought to have performed better, for as early as the thirteenth century it was "already the biggest political enterprise on the continent." Given its wealth and might, somehow it ought to have been able to nudge France toward the center of the European world economy. Another missed opportunity.61 Finally, in his inventory of the forces responsible for France's developmental failures, Braudel indicts capitalism. Capitalism blamed for capitalism's lethargy? Another ostensible tautology, the logic is compelling, however, if one remembers Braudel's preferred understanding of capitalism, his microcosmic representation: capitalism is the superstructural arena of economic activity, the theater of the elite where a very small number of unusually talented, aggressive entrepreneurs, investors, and risk takers wheel and deal. By their nature, capitalists are as a rule not particularly wedded to place or patrie. Still, in his Frenchness, Braudel is a bit shocked that the capitalists of France abandoned their country so frequently across time. Too often, French (and French-based) capitalists preferred the lure "of the world," of adventure abroad. For want of capitalists and bankers, French industry grew more slowly than it could have. Capitalism was "guilty"; but by dint of its general indifference to and sometimes shabby treatment of capitalists, France probably deserved the treatment it received.62 Let us not end without an allusion to a success story-but, as always, a story with painful counterpoints. I mean les trente glorieuses-the great surge of expansion and proliferating prosperity that followed World War II. The glory of those years is now partially obscured and marred by the on-going economic crisis, which dates from the early seventies, and by its bitter political and social aftermath. It is a fitting issue because it engages Braudel as both scholar and citizen (measured in neutral long-run terms, he spent a disproportionately large amount of time on it in L'identite) and because it threatens to culminate in yet another missed opportunity if not an outright tragedy. The success of the thirty glorious years was built partly on the ability to mobilize human capital on short notice. This sort of immigration, Braudel affirms, "is inherent to all capitalist societies."63 But it occasioned a vast immigration of foreign workers, many of them of different colors, religions, and civilizations-a dose that the French are having a hard time swallowing now that harrowing contraction has set in.64 Braudel does not underestimate the gravity of the problem, paying this time as much attention to the hot "representational" or psychological factors as to the colder "objective" ones. France has always lived in a tension between a pluralistic, accommodating inclination and a juggemaut-Jacobin propensity geared to impose unity and crush particularism. If France is a dazzling rainbow of 60 L'identite, 1:68. 61 Civilisation, 3:276. 62 L'identite, 3:304, 420; Civilisation, 3:42. On the law of small numbers, see L'identite, 3:416-19. 63 L'identite, 2:188. 64 The numbers are not certain. Estimated at 3.7 million in 1976, the immigrant population is almost certainly much larger today, despite various efforts to coerce and to lure immigrants to return to their countries of origin (ibid., 1:187).</page><page sequence="13">Long-Run Lamentations: Braudel on France 353 "diversity," an enriching and creative trait, it is also "division" incarnate and more or less permanent "civil war." Unity is only "an envelope, a superstructure, a wager."65 Yet Braudel adduces reasons for reassurance, at least insofar as the peopling of the hexagon is concerned. Today's French have over a billion ancestors, and they represent a radical inter- and crossbreeding, a composite of different peoples.66 Viewed across the long run, we are "all sons of immigrants," muses Braudel.67 The long run invites a certain optimism, since until now the French have never had trouble absorbing outsiders. (Braudel makes the point in an unfortunate set of comparisons in which the "too numerous immigrants who worry France today" take their place vis-a-vis prior "invaders" from the Celts through the barbarians of the fifth century.)68 The problem today arises in part because, unlike the previous waves who landed "without making too much noise," large numbers of today's immigrants are not assimilating rapidly and completely enough, in Braudel's judgment.69 He censures the racist reactions of many of his countrymen, but he understands the fear that these outsiders are hurting French economic well-being and gorging the social safety nets. Those "immigrants who have been in our midst for some time" have fully earned their chevrons as Frenchmen because "they contributed to French [economic] growth," a title akin to that of decorated war veteran. About the others, especially the more recent ones and the illegal ones, Braudel is somewhat evasive. For him, in the current state of friction, "as always, the wrongs are on both sides." Racism emerges from both camps: "rejection is reciprocal and is nourished by this reciprocity.'"70 Immigrants today have no choice: "they must choose" -to be French, or to be an enduring source of trouble for themselves and for others, a peril for the economy and the society. Braudel calls for "tolerance, and for more tolerance." But he regards "assimilation" as the ultimate criterion "for immi- gration without pain.'"71 Without pain for whom? It is not surprising that Braudel's very last page is devoted to the long run. He earnestly hopes that the reader-Braudel is reaching out in L'identite far beyond his usual audience-has become used to "its particular language." Only the long run, Braudel reminds the reader, gives access to "a deep history, whose movement entails and commands the set of successive Frances of the past."72 The long run is the open sesame to the discovery (or the construction) of identity. Will the reader have the patience and the foresight and the abnegation to follow Braudel? To share his faith in life, one must also share his faith in the long run, its surest guarantee. Of all the demands that Braudel makes upon his reader, this may be the most difficult. 65 Civilisation, 3:240; L'identite, 1:33, 103-4. 66 L'identite, 2:9, 57-61, 104, 192. 67 Ibid., 1:192. 68 Ibid., 2:61. 69 Ibid., 2:192. 70 Ibid., 2:192, 197. 71 Ibid., 1:185; 2:199.
