<plain_text><page sequence="1">COLERIDGE'S METACRITICISM BY HOWARD H. CREED I BORROW metacriticism from J. H. Muirhead, who has described Coleridge as combining "a genius for criticism" with "the metacritical craving for a theory of aesthetic."*1 And I am aware that the framework of critical "modes" into which Coleridge is fitted in the essay that fol- lows is quite an arbitrary one; how arbitrary is readily shown by a glance at a recent anthology of critical writing edited by Mark Schorer, Jose- phine Miles, and Gordon McKenzie.2 Coleridge appears there alongside Aristotle as a critic who emphasizes the "form" of poetry rather than its "source" or "end." I have used the same kind of triple relationship to define "poetry," although I have called the relationship that of Poet, Poem, and Reader rather than Source, Form, and End. But I have pre- ferred to treat Coleridge as a "romantic" critic who attempts a synthesis of Aristotelian form and Platonic end by placing his critical emphasis on the source of poetry in the poet's creative imagination. I As a literary critic seriously concerned with aesthetic theory, Coleridge made his start with the doctrine of "organic unity," a doctrine put to- gether from so many sources that scholars are still untangling them. Ac- cording to his own testimony, he substituted organic unity for isolated "beauties" as his chief criterion for poetic excellence shortly after 1800. "I shall die soon, my dear Charles Lamb, and then you will not be vexed that I had bescribbled your book," he writes at the close of a volume of Donne's Poems belonging to Lamb, dating the note 2 May 1811. One of the notes "bescribbled" in the margin beside the "Canonization" reads: "As late as ten years ago, I used to seek and find out grand lines and fine stanzas; but my delight has been far greater since it has consisted more in tracing the leading thought thro'out the whole. The former is too much like coveting your neighbour's goods; in the latter you merge yourself in the author, you become He."3 By 1802 his theory and practice have begun to mature into something of a system; his critical strategy is that of the * This essay appears in its present form as a result of some leisure time given me by a grant-in-aid from the Carnegie Foundation and Birmingham-Southern College: I grate- fully acknowledge the pleasant terms of the grant. 1 Coleridge as Philosopher (New York, 1930), p. 213. The relevance of Coleridge's philosophy to his criticism has been clearly stated more recently by Herbert Read, "Cole- ridge as Critic," Sewanee Rev.

Creed psychologist, investigating the human faculties that produce works of literary genius and that allow good readers to experience something of the same pleasure which originally motivated the creations. He dis- cusses with Southey a proposed essay "Concerning Poetry," which is to deal with the characteristic merits of contemporary poets: "The object is not to examine what is good in each writer, but what has ipso facto pleased, and to what faculties, or passions, or habits of the mind they may be supposed to have given pleasure."4 A notebook entry dated the same year suggests the usefulness of recognizing the combinations of faculties as a critical device: "Great injury has resulted from the sup- posed incompatibility of one talent with another, judgment with imagi- nation and taste, good sense with strong feeling, &amp;c. If it be false, as assuredly it is, the opinion has deprived us of a test which every man might apply."5 At times Coleridge may seem to be almost entirely the historical critic: his remarks on literary history in the "Progress of the Drama" suggest, in a sense, historical generalization in the manner of Gibbon and Taine. His criticism of the University classicists, for instance, is that they accept ancient rules with no "critical collation of the times, origin, or circum- stances";6 and he observes in Lecture x of the 1818 series that "the man who reads a work meant for immediate effect on one age with the notions and feelings of another, may be a refined gentleman but must be a sorry critic" (Misc. Crit., p. 167). When he uses the historical approach, how- ever, it is only a necessary preliminary to his real critical method, which, as he describes it in Lecture Iv of the 1811-12 series, is "a psychological, rather than a historical mode of reasoning."7 And this "psychological mode," it can be argued, results from Coleridge's attempt to bring to- gether two older critical modes. "In the only accurate sense of the term, there neither are, have been, or ever will be but two essentially different Schools of Philosophy: the Platonic, and the Aristotelian," Coleridge said in 1820, identifying him- self with the Platonic school, which finds ideas constitutive and actual rather than regulative only.8 He might have added that the two schools of philosophy have also furnished two opposing schools of criticism, two modes that have their historical beginnings in the critical remarks of Plato and Aristotle. For a history of criticism could be written in terms of the oscillation from one to the other of the critical poles Plato and 4Letters, ed. E. H.

Griggs (New Haven, 1933), II, 264-265. 1161</page><page sequence="3">Coleridge's Metacriticism Aristotle represent in their modes of literary discussion. At one polar extreme the critical strategy is to look for a poem's symbolic truth, with little attention to the poem's structure as a criterion for excellence; Plato, when he turns the Dialogues toward an evaluation of literature, is always close to this extreme. At the other extreme is a formal poetic that con- cerns itself with internal structure, without explicit comment on the poem as a symbol of truth; closest of anything in criticism to this pole is Aristotle's Poetics, for here Aristotle attempts to justify everything in a poem in terms of its internal relationships. Plato's mode always moves outside any given poem. His critical ques- tions are: How in this poem are ideas communicated? And are those ideas in keeping with the moral interests of the reader or public audience? Plato asks of poetry that it reveal ideal truth; he is attracted by poetic form, but he is skeptical of what he considers third-hand copies of the ideal. All too often distorted truth is a poem's content, and the appealing form serves only to make false ideas attractive: poets must be banished from the perfect kingdom. Plato's approach to poetry is made with an emphasis on truth, his truth; structural analysis does not enter into his practice as critic. Aristotle's theory of poetry is diametrically opposed to that of Plato. Aristotle is the biologist, dissecting the poetic drama to see what it is made of. He collects poetic specimens and finds in all of them an artificial pattern that he calls imitation; but Aristotle's "imitation" is not Plato's "copy." For Aristotle, art is no mere reflection of objects either real or ideal; he treats the artist as "maker," a maker who may work with bor- rowed forms and prepared matter but whose artistic product is something not in nature, a new form no longer that of the imitated objects. The business of the literary artist is to make his newly-created form seem natural to his matter: spectacle, song, diction, thought, character, and plot are linked together in the competent tragedy by an inner necessity that makes it impossible for the completed whole to be anything other than what it is. Aristotle's focus is not on the audience's relationship to extrinsic truth, but on the drama itself and the way its parts are put to- gether to form an organic whole. In the Aristotelian mode the critic's explicit discussion of the communication of truth, the effect of a poem on a reader, has little of the importance given to it by the Platonic mode. There is, of course, the term catharsis which, as John Crowe Ransom has observed, "reflects the patronizing view of certain natural scientists, who have strenuous programmes in view for humanity, and tolerate the arts only for medical or sanitary reasons, and in consideration for the present weak state of the racial mind."9 It may well be that Aristotle does merely tolerate the arts, and with noticeable coldness; yet he cannot withhold 9 The World's Body (New York, 1938), p. 193. 1162</page><page sequence="4">Howard H. Creed approval of an exhibition of expert technical skill, even when the per- formance is that of an artist rather than that of a scientist. In the Poetics Aristotle first defines his theory of imitation, adds a brief account of the history of the Greek drama, and presents his formal definition of tragedy; from then on his analysis is of the constituent parts of a tragedy. Plot provides the "probability" for character; character provides the proba- bility for thought; thought provides probability for words, which are the poet's "means," the medium with which the literary craftsman works. And the Poetics includes a careful examination of "style": a command of metaphor, for instance, is pointed out as the true mark of genius. This, however, is not to separate poetic form from content; Aristotle is not treating words as ornaments, but as functional parts of a fused whole that in reality has no parts. When Aristotle examines a poem (the Oedipus Rex, for example), he investigates its parts and their relationships; his critical method is concerned first with the imitation, not with the truth it symbolizes. His crucial question is: How in a given poem is there or- ganic "wholeness"? and he has little need to look beyond the poem itself for the unity he seeks. The major English critics have quoted Aristotle oftener than Plato, but their critical practice proves them Plato's men. There is Sidney, for example: "Poesie therefore is an arte of imitation, for so Aristotle termeth it in his word Mimesis, that is to say, a representing, counterfeiting, or figuring forth: to speake metaphorically, a speaking picture: with this end, to teach and delight."10 But this is not exactly what Aristotle said; nor is there authority in the Poetics for Sidney's "Platonized" portrait of the poet monarch, who comes "with a tale which holdeth children from play, and old men from the chimney corner. And pretending no more, doth intende the winning of the mind from wickednesse to vertue" (p. 416). Dryden, too, however authoritatively he may quote Aristotle, has none of Aristotle's objectivity. "The Grounds of Criticism in Tragedy," prefixed to Troilus and Cressida, begins with Aristotle's definition of tragedy as interpreted by Dryden, and the conclusion drawn from the ex- amination of the definition is this: "To instruct delightfully is the general end of all poetry."" Dryden does on at least one occasion move toward Aristotle and the pole of structural analysis; toward the end of the "Es- say of Dramatic Poesy" he speaks of rime and introduces a principle of diction which includes internal unity,12 but it is not Dryden's usual criti- cal method to look for the unity of the parts of a poem; more often he is searching for the truth he feels the poet must teach. Likewise Dr. John- 10 "An Apologie for Poetrie," in Criticism: the Foundations of Modern Literary Judgment, p. 410. n Essays, ed. W. P. Ker (Oxford, 1926), i, 207. 12 Ibid., I, 96. 1163</page><page sequence="5">Coleridge's Metacriticism son, with a bow to Dryden as "the writer who first taught us to deter- mine upon principles the merit of composition,"'3 shows an occasional inclination toward the Aristotelian mode. He speaks, for instance, of the "integrity of design" in Paradise Lost and, following Addison, makes a brief analysis of fable, characters, episodes, sentiments, and diction. Yet his heart is not in the search for the kind of unity that interested Aris- totle; when he comes to the real praise of Milton's performance, it is "that in reading Paradise Lost we read a book of universal knowledge" (I, 183). When Johnson attacks Gray, he can find structural defects enough in "The Bard" to condemn it, but his most crushing indictment is that he cannot see that it "promotes any truth, moral or political" (III, 436). This is the tradition, and Coleridge is a part of it. He is aware, how- ever, to a greater extent than his predecessors among the English critics, of "organic unity" as a criterion by which to judge the products of art. The lesson of close poetic logic learned from the Reverend James Boyer at Christ's Hospital-"that Poetry, even that of the loftiest and, seem- ingly, that of the wildest odes, had a logic of its own, as severe as that of science"'4-is a lesson he never forgets. He makes the principle a part of his critical approach to Shakespeare: Shakespeare "never avails himself of the supposed license of transposition merely for the meter. There is al- ways some logic either of thought or passion to justify it." Shakespeare's conceits not only "rise out of some word in the lines before, but they lead to the thought in the lines following" (Shaks. Crit., I, 16-17). And when Coleridge phrases his definition of poetry in Chapter xiv of the Biogra- phia, he makes the distinguishing element "such delight from the whole, as is compatible with a distinct gratification from each component part." He is, in other words, genuinely interested in a criticism that takes into account the internal relationships of a poem. He accepts the Aristotelian doctrine of imitation, and a great part of the metaphysics introduced in the Biographia as an explanation of the faculty of imagination can be read as an attempt to develop a psychology for the special kind of imi- tation that is poetry. Yet, beginning with his earliest critical exercises, Coleridge cannot es- cape the Platonic mode. A sonnet on Fielding, sent in 1792 to the mother of Mary Evans along with a copy of Fielding's Amelia, is criticism in the manner of Plato. Fielding displays, according to Coleridge, Each social duty and each social care; With just yet vivid colouring portray'd What every wife should be, what many are.15 13 Lives of the English Poets, ed.

Coleridge (Oxford, 1912), I, 37. 1164</page><page sequence="6">Howard H. Creed By 1799 and "Satyrane's Letters" Coleridge would perhaps argue that this is also Aristotle's manner, since Aristotle "required of the poet an involution of the universal in the individual" (Biog., II, 159). Aristotle had said that "poetry tends to express the universal, history the particu- lar," but he had added, by way of definition, that universal means "how a person of a certain type will on occasion speak or act, according to the law of probability or necessity."16 There is little in the Poetics to indicate that Aristotle felt it the business of either poet or critic to point out what any universal should be. Having quoted Aristotle in "Satyrane's Letters," Coleridge remarks immediately upon a difference between mathematics and poetry: "In geometry it is the universal truth itself, which is upper- most in the consciousness, in poetry the individual form in which the truth is clothed.""7 He is summarizing here the essential difference be- tween the two modes of criticism that have been under discussion, and the difference is one of emphasis. Plato chooses to talk about universal truth. Aristotle chooses to talk about individual form and how it obeys necessary poetic laws; he chooses, in brief, to talk primarily about poems rather than about poets and readers and their relationship with truth. Coleridge often chooses with Plato to talk about truth. He uses the term "platonizing" for poetic symbolism "where more is met than meets the ear," and he recognizes that Plato "considered fiction as profane un- less where it is consecrated by being emblematic of some truth" (Letters, I, 406). From Bristol in 1795 he writes George Dyer that he is endeavor- ing "to disseminate Truth"; he quotes from Thomson's "Castle of Indo- lence" to illustrate that "pleasures, which we receive from rural beauties, are of little Consequence compared with the moral Effect of these pleas- ures-beholding constantly the Best possible we at last become ourselves the best possible" (Unpub. Letters, I, 30). He writes in the second essay of the general introduction to The Friend: "Having myself experienced that no delight either in kind or degree is equal to that which accompanies the distinct perception of a fundamental truth, relative to our moral being . . . there arose a soothing hope in my mind that a lesser public might be found, composed of persons susceptible of the same delight, and desirous of attaining it by the same process" (Complete Works, ii, 26). "To convey important Truth is my main object," he advises Pym Nevine on the mar- gin of a prospectus of The Friend; he wishes "to seek from above those Impulses, which can be given only from above; and of which all that the highest earthly Eloquence can affect, is to convince the mind of its need! 16 Poetics, trans.

Letters, I, 441). It is the function of "earthly eloquence" to lead to reflection; words, Coleridge explains in the preface to the Aids to Reflec- tion, are "living powers, by which the things of most importance to mankind are actuated, combined, and humanized" (Complete Works, I, 16). Early in his attempts to formulate a poetic theory Coleridge makes clear that he is using poetry only as a springboard to something more in- clusive. He writes Sir Humphrey Davy in 1801 that illness is preventing him from doing what his heart "burns to do, that is, to concentre my free mind to the affinities of the feelings with words and ideas under the title 'Concerning Poetry, and the nature of the Pleasures derived from it.' I have faith that I do understand the subject, and I am sure that if I write what I ought to do on it, the work would supersede all the books of meta- physics, and all the books of morals too" (Letters, I, 347). And in the 1820's, sending paternal advice to Derwent at Cambridge, he substitutes philology for poetry as a disguise for the larger truth; he advises Derwent to pursue his studies "under the guidance and in the light of Philology, in the original and noblest sense of the term, in which it implies and is the most human, practical fructifying Form, and (what is of no small mo- ment in the present state of society) the most popular Disguise, of Logic and Psychology-without which what is man?"18 Coleridge is never con- tent to be merely a literary critic; like Carlyle's Transcendentalist, he is "Professor of Things in General." At the same time, Coleridge is always impatient with obvious and ap- parent moralizing in poetry. He identifies the "chief fault" in The Ancient Mariner as "the obtrusion of moral sentiment so openly" (Misc. Crit., p. 405). Writing Southey concerning the Thalaba, he counsels the substitu- tion of Allah for God: "the so frequent Repetition of that last word gives somehow or other a sermonic cast to a Poem" (Unpub. Letters, I, 126). He is finally alienated from Bowles, his first love among the poets, be- cause of Bowles's "perpetual trick of moralizing everything" in the later poems. "Never to see or describe any interesting appearance in nature without connecting it, by dim analogies, with the moral world proves faintness of impression," he writes Sotheby in 1802. "Nature has her proper interest, and he will know what it is who believes and feels that everything has a life of its own, and that we are all One Life" (Letters, I, 403-404). Pilgrim's Progress, Coleridge believes, succeeds "in spite of" Bunyan's attempts "to form the allegoric purpose on the reader's mind 18 Quoted in I. A. Richards, Coleridge on Imagination (London, 1934), p. 20. 1166</page><page sequence="8">Howard H. Creed by his strange names"; Bunyan's "piety was baffled by his genius, and the Bunyan of Parnassus had the better of the Bunyan of the conventi- cle" (Misc. Crit., p. 31). A poem is an instrument for truth, but it is a subtle instrument; it is a microcosm, revealing the secret of the macro- cosm, but the revelation is not to be made in a sermon. "The common end of all narrative, nay of all, Poems," Coleridge tells Cottle in 1815, "is to convert a series into a Whole: to make those events, which in real or imagined History move on in a strait Line, assume to our Understandings a circular motion-the snake with it's Tail in it's mouth" (Unpub. Let- ters, II, 128-129). Poetic truth is like the snake with its tail in its mouth: the poet's truth is relative, not absolute; it is the point in the circle constantly tak- ing a direction and never having one. A poem teaches the relationship of subjects and objects more subtly than the metaphysician; in some future "blessed time" it may be that "truth itself shall be pleasure, and both shall be so united, as to be distinguishable in words only, not in feeling," but until that time comes "it will remain the poet's office to proceed upon that state of association, which actually exists in general." If all men were philosophers, Coleridge is saying with Sidney, they could take their phi- losophy "straight"; but men being what they are, they must be instructed by first being "delighted." "The communication of pleasure," he declares in Chapter xxII of the Biographia, "is the introductory means by which alone the poet must expect to moralize his readers." As for the poet's "moral," it is the nature of reality itself: that the universe is not "a mass of little things," as the "rationally educated" believe; that objects (in- cluding poems) are never merely objects, but counterfeits and symbols of infinity (Letters, I, 16-17, 228). This is the function assigned to poetry throughout Coleridge's Shakespearean criticism; it is a function that makes an impossibility of conceiving of Shakespeare's genius as "wild" and "irregular," since Shakespeare is "a nature humanized, a genial un- derstanding directing self-consciously a power and an implicit wisdom deeper even than our consciousness." Shakespeare is poet and philoso- pher, clothing logic in rhetoric to "convey profound truths in the most lively images." He spontaneously creates "in correspondence with na- ture" an organic form, while lesser poets like Beaumont and Fletcher, who do not have the degree of imagination that checks "any intuition of an inward impossibility," produce a mechanical form which lacks the higher unity that is nature's law. And Coleridge insists that readers must learn to recognize the difference between a mechanical and an organic unity: "The form is mechanic when on any given material we impress a pre-determined form, not necessarily arising out of the properties of the material, as when to a mass of wet clay we give whatever shape we wish 1167</page><page sequence="9">Coleridge's Metacriticism it to retain when hardened. The organic form, on the other hand, is in- nate; it shapes as it develops itself from within, and the fullness of its de- velopment is one and the same with the perfection of its outward form" (Shaks. Crit., I, 224). The organic form Coleridge is defining is that of an Aristotelian imita- tion, but he is not following Aristotle's critical practice when he seizes every opportunity to point to the universal law of nature miniatured in any poem worth critical consideration. He is the platonizing critic when he views Hamlet as exhibiting a moral truth ("action is the chief end of existence"); so he is again when he interprets Cressida as a portrait of vehement passion, contrasted with Troilus, who represents profound affection, "alone worthy the name of love." Shakespeare, for Coleridge, is true moralist as well as true poet and philosopher; though he may some- times be gross, his worst passages are always "grossnesses against the deg- radation of our nature" and not, as in modern plays, "delicacies directly in favor of them" (II, 266). Shakespeare portrays love in its true meaning, as Plato and Coleridge would have it; sensuality, Coleridge recalls from Plato, must first be raised to affection, affection to love, and love to "the pure intellectual delight by which we become worthy to conceive that infinite in ourselves, without which it is impossible for man to believe in God" (II, 143). The function of poetry comes ultimately with Coleridge to be identical with the function of religion, and it is their common object to improve the nature of man: "They bid us, while we are sitting in the dark at our little fire, look at the mountain-tops, struggling with dark- ness, and announcing that light which shall be common to all, in which individual interests shall resolve into one common good, and every man shall find in his fellow man more than a brother" (II, 147-148). Yet, in spite of the preponderance of platonizing in the criticism, Cole- ridge never loses sight of the principle of structural unity. A letter to William Sotheby written in 1829 speaks of poetic beauty as something "more than unity," but Coleridge insists on the unity: "Piu nel uno is Francesco de Sallez' brief and happy definition of the beautiful, and the shorter the poem the more indispensable it is that the Piu should not overlay the Uno, that the unity should be evident." Nor is he engaged here in mere theorizing; he is revising a poem of his own composition. "Love, Hope, and Patience in Education" is the poem under revision, and lines 24-26 were struck out, he explains, not because they were "bad lines in themselves . . . but because they diverted and retarded the stream of the thought, and injured the organic unity of the composition." And, he adds characteristically, "to sacrifice the gratification, the sting of pleasure, from a fine passage to the satisfaction, the sense of complacency arising 1168</page><page sequence="10">Howard H. Creed from the contemplation of a symmetrical Whole is among the last con- quests achieved by men of genial powers."19 "Extremes meet" is Coleridge's favorite proverb.20 And out of his at- tempts at a reconciliation of the opposing critical modes of Plato and Aristotle comes a Coleridgean theory that is a critical mode in its own right. (I am not arguing, of course, that Coleridge consciously formulated his theory in these terms.) In the three-way relationship of Poet-Poem- Reader that defines "poetry," the Platonic critic emphasizes the reader and his responses to ideas; the Aristotelian critic places his emphasis on the poem. Coleridge gives his primary attention to the poet. Investigat- ing the source of pleasure that accompanies the reading of poetry, he ar- rives in Chapter xiv of the Biographia at a definition that attempts to distinguish a poem from scientific discourse: "A poem is that species of composition, which is opposed to works of science, by proposing for its immediate object pleasure, not truth; and from all other species-having this object in common with it-it is discriminated by proposing to itself such delight from the whole, as is compatible with a distinct gratification from each component part." But, the unity of the human mind being what it is, he discovers that the definition needs qualification. Truth must somehow be united with the pleasure given by structural perfection: "The first chapter of Isaiah (indeed a very large portion of the whole book) is poetry in the most emphatic sense; yet it would be not less ir- rational than strange to assert, that pleasure, and not truth, was the im- mediate object of the prophet." The combination of these two passages has led Allen Tate to charge Coleridge with responsibility for most of the confused thinking in recent criticism: Coleridge cannot "make up his mind whether the specifically poetic element is an objective feature of the poem, or is distinguishable only as a subjective effect."21 As critic, Coleridge seems concerned with two kinds of "pleasure": a pleasure from internal relationships within a poem, and a more perma- nent pleasure that results from transferring the nature of poetry to the reader himself. There is, to begin with, a reasonable relationship of part to whole within the poem: this is Aristotelian imitation; it is in the poem, according to Coleridge's theory, because the poet has produced a true work of the imagination. The good reader, who like the poet has creative imagination, finds pleasure in the internal structure of the poem. This pleasure brings contemplation and a reason for a more permanent pleas- 19 Complete Poetical Works, i, 481 and note. 20 Cf. Alice D.

Coleridge is involved in a definition of poetry that concerns itself with both struc- tural analysis and symbolic truth: It is the nature of poetry to be an Aristotelian imitation; it is the function of poetry to teach a Platonic truth. Such a complex fusion of the nature and function of poetry invites the charge of obscurity, yet it is an obscurity which is perhaps under- standable if Coleridge is placed in the critical tradition which he inherited and tried to unify. II Coleridge's choice of emphasis in his literary criticism has sometimes been treated as a matter of indifference. Gordon McKenzie, for example, has remarked that "Coleridge sees that 'poetry' is a larger term than 'poem' and so makes an attempt to describe its nature. However, he shifts his ground a trifle by asserting that the answer to 'What is poetry?' is so nearly the same as the answer to 'What is a poet?' that he will con- cern himself only with the latter question. The shift in ground is not im- portant, for the discussion refers directly to the secondary imagination which is essential to his theory."22 Yet Coleridge's emphasis on the poet provides a key to his critical method, since the questions asked by a critic always limit the discussion he finds necessary in developing a theory and, moreover, define the mode of criticism that will regulate his manipulation of literary materials. Coleridge's basic question concerns the poet; it is a question that is fundamental to his whole theory of poetry. "The com- position of a poem is among the imitative arts," he says in Chapter xvIII of the Biographia; but "imitation, as opposed to copying, consists either in the interfusion of the Same throughout the radically Different, or of the different throughout a base radically the same." Poetry is an imita- tion, but it is an imitation in the Aristotelian sense. And Coleridge wants a sanction for the definition that goes beyond the mere empirical investi- gation that was Aristotle's sanction. He finds the sanction in the mind of the poet: poetry is the imitation that the poet's act accomplishes, and Coleridge goes behind the act to investigate the underlying psychology. His critical questions become: What is the poetic act? and Where in a given poem do we find evidence of it? His investigation centers, then, on the imagination as the faculty which makes possible the kind of Aristo- telian imitation that is art. At the same time, Coleridge is the critical Platonist, looking toward the ultimate function of poetry as the dissemination of truth; and if poetic truth is to be acceptably valid, Coleridge believes that the validity of all knowledge must first be proved. So Chapters v to xIII of the Biographia 2 Organic Unity in Coleridge, Univ. of Calif. Pub. in Eng., vII (1939), 72. 1170</page><page sequence="12">Howard H. Creed are given over for the most part to a discussion of philosophy and philoso- phers, although he has announced in the first chapter that his subject is poetry and criticism. The survey of philosophy is included not as mere space-filler (as is obviously the case with "Satyrane's Letters" and the "Critique on Bertram") but as an entry for the faculty of imagination: the results of the philosophical survey are to be "applied to the deduction of the Imagination, and with it the principles of production and of genial criticism in the fine arts" (Biog., II, 180). Coleridge's interest in logic and ethics, which accompanies (or perhaps precedes) his interest in aesthetics, explains the heavy load of philosophy that the literary criticism carries. His discussion of the nature of poetry begins with the proposition that all knowledge rests on the coincidence of a knowing subject and a knowable object, and in reaching his final ex- planation of the relationship between subject and object he passes through several levels of philosophical development. He says in Chapter ix of the Biographia that he "successively studied in the schools of Locke, Berkeley, Leibnitz, and Hartley, and could find in none of them an abid- ing place." But he is notoriously careless with dates, and even such a simple chronology as this appears to be untrustworthy. A likelier develop- ment would perhaps begin with Descartes, Locke, and Hartley; continue through Berkeley, Spinoza, and Leibniz; and arrive finally at Kant, Fichte, Schlegel, and Schelling-all within a transforming framework of neo-Platonism. Coleridge brings together the procedures of the sensationalist and the transcendentalist in his solution of the problem of subject and object. Sensationalism works from object to subject: examining the laws of natural philosophy, the sensationalist finds reason appearing, and reason leads to a self. Transcendentalism, on the other hand, works from subject to object: the complex activity of the knowing I or Ego gradually intro- duces an objective world. Coleridge posits that "during the act of knowl- edge itself, the objective and subjective are so instantly united, that we cannot determine to which of the two the priority belongs. There is here no first, and no second; both are coinstantaneous and one." In each in- vestigation the other also develops; what appear to be contradictory positions are resolved by recognizing that a knowledge of a self is "the ground of all other certainty" and is its own sufficient guarantee of its be- ing. The supposition of the existence of things external to a self is uncon- sciously involved in the necessary supposition that the self exists: "the former is unconsciously involved in the latter"; "it is not only coherent but identical, and one and the same thing with our own immediate self- consciousness" (Biog., I, 174, 177-178). The self is its own reason for be- ing: "It is a subject which becomes a subject by the act of constructing 1171</page><page sequence="13">Coleridge's Metacriticism itself objectively to itself; but which never is an object except for itself, and only so far as by the very same act it becomes a subject. It may be described therefore as a perpetual self-duplication of one and the same power into object and subject, which presupposes each other, and can exist only as antitheses" (p. 183). The knowing process, Coleridge finally argues, is a process in which the subject finds what is assimilable in itself in the object; it is a creative process, because the subject changes in the act of knowing. The "third somewhat" does not exist until the unity of opposites occurs, and the uni- fication occurs through the imagination. In Kant's system the external world comes into contact with the inner world of the self-the world of sense is fused with the world of understanding-through the medium of the imagination. But Coleridge elaborates Kant by positing two kinds of imagination: "primary imagination," which performs the unification spontaneously in any experience; and "secondary imagination," which is the primary imagination under the control of the will (the will, however, does not interfere with the spontaneity of the imagination's "synthetic and magical power"). The secondary imagination is the faculty toward which Coleridge is maneuvering throughout all of the philosophical dis- course in the Biographia, for the secondary imagination makes possible the conscious act of the poet. Coleridge's careful distinction between the two types of imagination is found in the well-known passage in Chapter xiII of the Biographia: The Imagination then I consider either as primary, or secondary. The primary Imagination I hold to be the living power and prime agent of all human percep- tion, and as a repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of creation in the infinite I Am. The secondary Imagination I consider as an echo of the former, co- existing with the conscious will, yet still as identical with the primary in the kind of its agency, and differing only in degree, and in the mode of its operation. It dissolves, diffuses, dissipates, in order to recreate; or where this process is rendered impossible, yet still at all events it struggles to idealize and to unify. It is essentially vital, even as all objects (as objects) are essentially fixed and dead. Knowing is anthropomorphism: The primary imagination, universally and unconsciously exercised among men, makes it possible for all men to know, in the sense that they treat as reality external objects which are mere modifications of their own self-consciousness. The secondary imagi- nation, possessed in a high degree only by superior minds, turns mere ob- jects into real objects and allows the genius who possesses it at its highest level to see into the inner harmony of the universe. "Form is factitious being, and thinking is the process," Coleridge notes in Anima Poetae: imagination is "the laboratory in which the thought elaborates essence into existence" (p. 186). 1172</page><page sequence="14">Howard H. Creed Primary and secondary imagination differ in degree and in mode of operation. "Fancy," as Coleridge defines the term, differs from imagina- tion in kind: "Fancy, on the contrary, has no other counters to play with, but fixities and definites. The Fancy is indeed no other than a mode of Memory emancipated from the order of time and space; while it is blended with, and modified by that empirical phenomenon of the will, which we express by the word Choice. But equally with the ordinary memory the Fancy must receive all its materials ready made from the law of association" (Biog., i, 202). The distinction between imagination and fancy is the basis for Coleridge's distinction between genius and tal- ent. Genius makes use of the creative imagination in addition to other lower faculties; talent, which lacks creative imagination in the highest de- gree, makes use of fancy, which appropriates and applies ideas but with no organizing idea, so that the result is a mechanical combination. Men of talent exercise "the faculty of appropriating and applying the knowl- edge of others"; between them and men of absolute genius, who "rest content between thought and reality, as it were in an intermundium of which their own living spirit supplies the substance, and their imagina- tion the ever-varying form," are men of "commanding" genius. These latter "must impress their preconceptions on the world without, in order to present them back to their own view with the satisfying degree of clear- ness, distinctness, and individuality." Coleridge makes this distinction in Chapter II of the Biographia, which is concerned with the "supposed ir- ritability of men of genius." His point is that men of talent and men of commanding genius are responsible for the popular misconception about the restlessness and fanaticism of geniuses; the true genius, the "ab- solute" genius (and Coleridge mentions Chaucer, Shakespeare, Spenser, and Milton in this discussion) is calm and tranquil. Absolute genius is self-sufficing, and for human kind must remain an ideal; but a Shake- speare, in Coleridge's view, comes close to realizing the ideal. The differ- ence between God and Shakespeare is that God can really be "absolute" in self-sufficiency; God needs no outside world, while a Shakespeare must depend upon the world for external impressions. Yet Nature speaks di- rectly to Shakespeare and other relatively absolute geniuses; the com- manding geniuses must torture Nature to get at her truths. The senses, the fancy, the imagination, the understanding, the will, the reason-Coleridge builds up a list of mental faculties as a background for a critical theory of poetry, insisting always that the faculties are inter- dependent. "I laboured," he declares in Chapter I of the Biographia, "at a solid foundation, on which permanently to ground my opinions, in the component faculties of the human mind itself, and their comparative dig- nity and importance." There may be a kind of poetry on the level of the 1173</page><page sequence="15">Coleridge's Metacriticism senses with a certain appeal to some minds; there may be a poetry on the level of fancy with its own appeal; but what Coleridge is finally looking toward is the poetry of the absolute genius, the poetic fusion accom- plished by the secondary imagination, which makes a true imitation. For the Plato of the Republic the nature of art is to be a copy of the ideal, and poetry ends in triviality because the copy is pale and third-hand. Its func- tion is to teach truth, but it fails in its function because, except for a few hymns to the gods, it appeals not to the intellect but to vicious and des- picable emotions. For Aristotle, on the other hand, it is the nature of poetry to be not a copy but an imitation, a made thing which is organic and whole in a way reality can never be; the nature of poetry is fused with its function, which is to present general concepts in the concrete par- ticulars of "poetic reality": Aristotle sees no need of laboring the point of the poet's truth, which is implicit in his definition of what an imitation is. Coleridge, like Aristotle, emphasizes the organic nature of poetry; he departs from the early Plato in believing that poetry can and does teach its truth. At once building up a theory of poetry, rejecting the mechanical asso- ciationism of Hartley and the later school of taste, and refuting the skep- ticism of Hume and Kant, Coleridge must prove that the mind is active, not passive, and that ideas are realities. He needs a psychology that will explain the imagination as a creative faculty; he needs a metaphysics that will explain the attraction the works of imagination have for men.23 He works out a psychology by resolving the procedures of the sensation- alists and the transcendentalists, and he arrives at what is for him a satis- factory explanation of an active, creative imagination. For the meta- physics that will explain the importance of the works of the imagination he turns to the Platonists; and even in his earliest Hartleyan period his ontology is that of Cudworth, More, Shaftesbury, and the Platonists. All the universe participates in a God that unifies through the "forming" spirit; and Coleridge will have the ideas of God, the World, and the Self, which Kant had called regulative only, constitutive and real. If the head cannot prove them, the heart will show them true: "Believe me, Sou- they!" Coleridge writes in 1803, "a metaphysical solution that does not instantly tell you something in the heart is grievously to be suspected as apocryphal." Nor will he grant that this is mysticism; it will be alto- gether understandable to "those short-necked men who have their hearts sufficiently near their heads-the relative distance of which . . . deter- mines the sagacity or stupidity of all bipeds and quadrupeds" (Letters, I, 342, 428). A poem, with a unity that results from the fusing power of 23 Cf. Muirhead, p. 198. 1174</page><page sequence="16">Howard H. Creed creative, "secondary" imagination, is an expression of the unity of the universe, a unity that is the expression of God. Poetic beauty, like all beauty, is "the shorthand hieroglyphic of Truth-the mediator between Truth and Feeling, the Head and the Heart."24 Coleridge's doctrine of the imagination has been called esoteric by later critics who find the function of imagination in imitation no different from its general psychological function. But Coleridge's secondary imagina- tion is a good deal more than the universal primary imagination; it is more than Kant's reproductive imagination. It is a productive imagina- tion, continuous not merely with the understanding (as in Kant) but also (as in Schelling) with the divine, infinite intelligence. The poet who has creative imagination masters "the essence, the natura naturans, which presupposes a bond between nature in the higher sense and the soul of men."25 The poet, by an act of the will, unites thought and thing- subject and object-in a creative revelation of the living spirit in the uni- verse. The good reader, who is something of a poet himself inasmuch as he too is endowed with secondary imagination in a high degree, recog- nizes the product of the poet's free creative act and finds pleasure in con- templating both the unity of the poem and the unity of the universe sym- bolically expressed in the poem. Coleridge's answer to the question "Does poetry have first claim on intellect or feeling?" is implicit in his theory of the imagination. The critic, like the poet, has imagination and reacts im- mediately to the product of imagination; the immediate reaction is emo- tional. But the critic must communicate with other readers, and the philosophical critic must attempt an explanation of the source of pleasure in poetry that has pleased. Poetry has final claim, then, on intellect, if aesthetic silence is to be articulated into criticism. III Examining the Greek drama in one of the early lecture courses, Cole- ridge is struck by the fact that the unities of the Greeks "were to a great extent the natural form of that which in its elements was homogeneous, and the representation of which was addressed preeminently to the out- ward senses." He continues: "Though the fable, the language and the characters appealed to the reason rather than to the mere understanding, inasmuch as they supposed an ideal state rather than referred to an exist- ing reality-yet it was a reason which was obliged to accommodate itself to the senses, and so far became a sort of more elevated understanding." As opposed to this type of drama, he describes the "romantic poetry" of the Shakespearean drama, which "appealed to the imagination rather 24 MS. Semina Rerum; quoted in Muirhead, p. 195. 25 "On Poesy or Art," Biog., II, 257. 1175</page><page sequence="17">Coleridge's Metacriticism than to the senses, and to the reason as contemplating our inward nature, and the workings of the passions in their most retired recesses" (Complete Works, iv, 35-36). The reference to fable, language, and characters sug- gests Aristotle's interest in the "parts" of the drama and their relation- ships; but it is plain that Coleridge's interest is mainly in discovering the faculties of the mind to which the parts make their appeal. The active, creative faculties of the critic are, Coleridge believes, those same faculties which have operated in the poet to produce the poetry. And arriving at the constellation of faculties responsible for great poetry means that Coleridge must make a catalog of the human faculties. His catalog varies from time to time; his most complete enumeration is in- cluded in an article "On the Soul and Its Organs of Sense," contributed to Southey's Omniana in 1812 and partially reproduced in Chapter XII of the Biographia. He lists the senses, "as the eye, the ear, the touch, &amp;c."; the imagination, "or shaping and modifying power"; the under- standing, "or the regulative, substantiating and realizing power"; the speculative reason, "or the power by which we produce or aim to produce unity, necessity, and universality in all our knowledge by means of prin- ciples a priori"; the judgment, "the faculty of choice"; and the will, "or practical reason." He is not concerned here, of course, with a "faculty psychology" in any literal sense: "A living body is of necessity an organ- ized one," and he believes the sophism of Plato's Republic to be that it forgets "that the human faculties, indeed, are parts, and not separate things"; it would be impossible to find "chiefs who were wholly reason, ministers who were wholly understanding, soldiers all wrath, labourers all concupiscence, and so on through the rest. Each of these partakes of, and interferes with, all the others" (Shaks. Crit., i, 152). The will and the intellectual powers (the judgment, the understanding, and the reason) are sometimes treated as abstractions, separate from the poetic powers (the feeling, the fancy, and the imagination). But in ideal perfection the various faculties operate as one, and the synthesizing power at work in the mind of genius could as well be labeled "higher reason" as "secondary imagination." The complete genius possesses feeling under control of the will, fancy and imagination under the control of judgment and the under- standing: all operate together to give reality to the ideas of the reason. It is to the poetic powers, however, that Coleridge ordinarily gives his closest attention. When he identifies in a lecture of 1808 the hierarchy of faculties that makes Shakespeare the nearest approximation of the ideal poet, he begins with the feelings "under the command of his own will"; moves on to the fancy, "considered as the faculty of bringing together images dissimilar in the main by some one point or more of likeness dis- tinguished"; and, "still mounting," comes finally to the imagination, "or 1176</page><page sequence="18">Howard H. Creed the power by which one image or feeling is made to modify many others and by a sort of fusion to force many into one" (Shaks. Crit., I, 212-213). The will and the understanding "put into action" the creative imagina- tion, and it is "retained under their irremissive, though gentle and un- noticed, controul" (Biog., ii, 12). The function of the will and under- standing, it should be emphasized, must be unnoticed: the creative imagi- nation performs spontaneously; genius cannot be forced.26 Throughout the Shakespearean criticism Coleridge puts the psycholog- ical mode to practical use. Hamlet, the play which Coleridge says first turned him to philosophical criticism (Shaks. Crit., I, 18), offers an ex- ample. Coleridge begins his discussion of Hamlet with comments on dic- tion, plot, and characters. He comments almost immediately on the dic- tion: "The language is familiar: no poetic descriptions of night, no elab- orate information conveyed by one speaker to another of what both had before their immediate perception ... yet nothing bordering on the comic on the one hand, and the striving of the intellect on the other. It is the language of sensation among men who feared no charge of effem- inacy for feeling what they felt no want of resolution to bear" (p. 20). He comments on the preciseness of the information presented in the open- ing scene, designed to establish the probabilities for later action. He notes the carefulness with which Shakespeare makes the ghost of the elder Hamlet credible ("Hume himself could not but have faith in this ghost dramatically"). He comments on the unobtrusive way in which the young Hamlet is introduced, on the relief provided by changing the scene quickly to the royal court, and on Shakespeare's trick of introducing sub- ordinate characters before more important ones. He observes the skilful matching of speeches to characters, such as Ophelia's short and general answer to the long speech of Laertes in the third scene of Act I, a speech showing "the natural carelessness of innocence, which cannot think such a code of cautions and prudences necessary to its own preservation." He comments on the psychology of Hamlet's treatment of Ophelia: "Ham- let ... discovers that he is watched, and Ophelia a decoy. Even this in a mood so anxious and irritable accounts for a certain harshness in him; and yet a wild upworking of love, sporting with opposites with a wilful self-tormenting irony is perceptible throughout." But what Coleridge is finally working toward is the character of Hamlet as a supreme illustra- tion of "Shakespeare's mode of conceiving characters out of his own intel- lectual and moral faculty in morbid excess and then placing himself, thus mutilated and diseased, under given circumstances." Coleridge is, as 26 Cf. Robert Penn Warren, "A Poem of Pure Imagination: An Experiment in Reading," The Rime of the Ancient Mariner ... With an Essay (New York, 1946), pp. 121-122, n. 29. 1177</page><page sequence="19">Coleridge's Metacriticism usual, examining the mental faculties which add up to genius-the intel- lectual and the moral faculties and their cooperation with the high poetic faculty, the creative imagination. Since Shakespeare has the full constellation of faculties necessary for the production of great poetry, Coleridge's Shakespearean analyses never emphasize the powers exhibited by separate faculties. He finds the right combination of powers in Shakespeare's earliest work; his analysis of "Venus and Adonis" and "Lucrece," in Chapter xv of the Biographia, is made in terms of the potential strength displayed in the productions of immature genius. And his attempts to establish a chronology for Shake- speare's plays are based on the same principle of the increasing powers of a proper constellation of faculties required for writing the kind of "roman- tic drama" that is at the top of his hierarchy of genres (p. 235). Coleridge may pause to notice the laws of psychology illustrated by the actions and speeches of the dramatic characters-Lear, Macbeth, Othello, Richard II are subjected to the same kind of psychoanalysis Hamlet is given-but his final interest is in the mind of the poet who can display such truths. He observes in the dramas, of course, a "law which all the parts obey"; but his concern for "parts" is largely confined to proving that they con- form "to the outward symbols and manifestations of the essential princi- ple"; dramatic "probability" is to be found in a transcendental ideal, the universal in the poet's mind. IV To summarize: Coleridge's critical inheritance is a tradition that has two polar extremes, an "Aristotelian" mode of formal structural analysis and a "Platonic" mode that limits itself for the most part to an examina- tion of poetry as symbolic truth. Coleridge turns to a psychological mode of criticism that attempts a synthesis of the two extremes by making the poet-rather than the poem or the reader-its focal point. Having set up a transcendental standard of poetic excellence, an ideal "organic unity" toward which poets strive, he reads poetry for evidences that a proper combination of faculties has operated to produce a true poetic imitation. His criterion for excellence involves both pleasure and knowledge. His theory of poetry is meant to prove that delight and truth, properly un- derstood, are one and the same thing; and he makes use of his reading in the philosophers to make this proof. The psychological method of the "new" philosophy, which began with Descartes and took such variant directions as Hume's skepticism and Kant's transcendentalism, attracts him as a method. He refuses, however, to discard the ontology absorbed at an early age from the neo-Platonists: he believes in a unity in the uni- verse, a unity that is the expression of God. And he believes that poetic 1178</page><page sequence="20">Howard H. Creed beauty, with a unity that results from the fusing power of poetic imagina- tion, is also an expression of the universal unity. His constant critical question is: where in a given poem is there evidence of the power of the creative imagination, that faculty of genius which can symbolize the unity of the universe in the unity of a poem? The "romantic drama," which he defines as a poetry "the interests of which are independent of all historical facts and associations, and arise from their fitness to that faculty of our nature, the imagination I mean, which owns no allegiance to time and place" (p. 131), is Coleridge's high- est poetic genre because it best affords the freedom the creative imagina- tion requires. It is the poetic form that most easily allows the poet to transfer from his "inward nature" the kind of human interest that will convert the reader to "poetic faith," and a Shakespeare uses it to ac- complish the highest creative act possible among men-a fusion of the subjective and the objective effected by the secondary imagination. It must be kept in mind, however, that Coleridge is always concerned with the ideal poet, who has no more real existence than does the ideal, trans- cendental standard of perfect unity that is somehow in every man. The poet described in Chapter xiv of the Biographia, who "brings the whole soul of man into activity, with the subordination of its faculties to each other," is the poet "described in ideal perfection." Shakespeare is almost the ideal, the poet "in general"; and Coleridge will only grudgingly admit imperfections in his approximate ideal. He will grant that "some of his conceits . . . detract sometimes from his universality as to time, person, and situation"; but usually, as in the instance of the "low porter solilo- quy" in Macbeth, he simply refuses to admit as genuine the Shakespear- ean passages he finds unsatisfactory. Coleridge's insistent metaphysical approach to criticism leads him all too often to a discussion of principles rather than poems, as has been pointed out by R. S. Crane,27 who is a considerably stricter "Aristotelian" than Coleridge. Yet it is not altogether fair to Coleridge to make the gen- eralization that he completely loses sight of the particularity of a poem in his search for universals, or that he believes that an isolated passage is an adequate substitute for a whole poem in passing a literary judgment. Measuring a poem by a standard that is an ideal means that Coleridge's method always demands an extremely close reading, an analysis that will show just where the performance falls short of the ideal. The advice he gives Sotheby in a letter of 1802 is an essential axiom of the Coleridgean mode: "Be minute, and assign your reasons often, and your first impres- sions always, and then blame or praise. I care not which, I shall be grati- 27 Univ. of Kansas City Rev., vIII (Spring 1942), 199-202. 1179</page><page sequence="21">1180 Coleridge's Metacriticism fied" (Letters, I, 402). At the same time it is true that, whatever else it may mean, the "romanticism" of a thinker like Coleridge would seem to mean essentially a belief in the "Oneness" of everything and, quite as important, a belief in the peculiar power of imaginative genius to resolve the world's ambiguities in a poetic symbol. Such beliefs do not lend them- selves to easy explanation: to talk about anything is, for Coleridge, to talk about everything. For that reason, Coleridge can confuse and infuri- ate an impatient reader quicker than any of the other great critics. For the same reason he can be the most rewarding of critics; perhaps Saints- bury was not being entirely whimsical when he indicated his willingness to "disestablish" the professors of English in the universities and use the savings in salary to provide students with copies of the Biographia Liter- aria.28 BIRMINGHAM-SOUTHERN COLLEGE Birmingham 4, Alabama 28 A History of Criticism (New York, 1900), III, 231.</page></plain_text>
