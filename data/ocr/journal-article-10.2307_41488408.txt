Historian Erika Milam opens her new book on the history of sexual selection with the provocative question: "How does a hen decide whe- ther she is in the mood for sex?" (p. 1) This question sets the tone for her inquiry which ranges from the 19th century through the end of the 20th, encompassing the thoughts, claims, experiments and ideas of a wide range of biologists. This is no small task. As Milam deftly demonstrates, Darwin's idea of sexual selection (which was briefly presented in the Origin then fully elaborated in 1871 in Descent of Man) raised a plethora of contentious scientific, philosophical, political and even experimental issues. Milam's goal here is to illuminate the constantly shifting topography of the biological research on animal behavior and evolution and to investigate and describe how the myriad applications of scientific knowledge of courtship behavior in animals served as a "biological basis of human courtship" (p. 6). One can immediately surmise that this research therefore bears on some of the most sensitive and controversial issues about the divide between humans and non-human animals, about the biology of sex and gender, about the boundaries between instinct and learning and about the fuzzy line between biology and culture. Milam is also working on a historiographical project here. In the course of the book she demonstrates that the history previously written on the subject of sexual selection theory and, more specifically and importantly for her project, female choice, has underrepresented the distinction between sexual selection research and research on mate choice and has subsequently assumed that as interest in sexual selection theory waned in the 20th century so too with mate choice. She suc- cessfully demonstrates that the "recovery of those forgotten elements of history of sexual selection merit inclusion and consideration," while at the same time, "changing conceptions of animals' minds affected not only the scientific reception of sexual selection and female choice as theories but also the ways in which the histories of these theories have been negotiated" (p. 3).</page><page sequence="2">366 BOOK REVIEW The book is comprised of six brief but entirely engaging chapters beginning with Darwin and Wallace and their divergent views on the topic of mate choice and concluding with a fantastic chapter "Selective History: Writing Female Choice into Organismal Biology." This, the penultimate chapter, describes the impact of Robert Trivers' work, especially his 1972 paper "Parental Investment and Sexual Selection," that reinvigorated the debate and reconnected the issue of female choice with the broader theoretical issues in evolutionary theory that had been raised by the work of W.D. Hamilton, John Maynard Smith and George Price. The influence of this paper is succinctly and convincingly presented by Milam and its impact explained as "convenient one-stop shopping; he synthesized the complex mathematics of John Maynard Smith and William D. Hamilton with the experimental evidence of Claudine Petit and Lee Ehrman, illustrating how they could be applied to field research, in a short, easy-to-read form" (p. 141). In this chapter, the connection between mate choice and the most fundamental ques- tions in evolutionary biology are made completely manifest. Trivers' work formed the backbone of Dawkins' Selfish Gene and Wilson's Sociobiology and Milam describes these connections exceedingly well. This chapter is also the site of Milam's strongest and most interesting historiographical arguments. In the section "Constructing the History of Sexual Selection," she places the recent work on female choice and sexual selection in the context of the ongoing struggle between molec- ular and organismal biology. She argues compellingly that the success of Trivers' 1972 paper along with the growth of the field of animal behavior studies there developed "a new historical authority, wiping out a more interdisciplinary picture of the history of female choice" (p. 151) which her own work recovers. Indeed, Milam suggests that "the eclipse history of sexual selection is an exemplary case of the practicing biol- ogists' fascination with the history of their discipline and reflects the disciplinary affiliations of sexual selection in the 1980s" (p. 157). As I flipped back through the chapters I found myself completely convinced by this argument. Milam's work provides insight into the myriad modes biologists employ in the pursuit of their research including the con- struction of disciplinary histories. One could not end this review without including some discussion of a persistent and significant theme that runs through the entire book and that is the role of both anthropomorphism (imbuing animals with hu- man qualities) and zoomorphism (interpreting human behavior as a complex form of animal behavior). Here again Milam demonstrates a nuanced and careful historian's touch. She repeatedly demonstrates the</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEW 367 significance of these theoretical frameworks but more importantly, she emphasizes their changing significance as the scientific and social con- texts shift. If there is one difficulty I had with the book it was the lack of a clear narrative arc. This is hardly the author's fault as her range of characters and ideas is incredibly broad. Nevertheless, I found some- times difficult to draw the connections between the various individuals, research communities and ideas they were engaging. Finally, I suspect this book will find its way into many a graduate seminar on the history of evolutionary theory in the 20th century and that many a graduate student will benefit from that. I also think this book could be read with great profit by biologists currently working on sexual selection and mate choice. I'm convinced, Milam's book only solidifies that conviction, that thinking about the varied invocations and investigations of a theory over time leads to better biological research, but as a historian perhaps I'm biased.
