This is a multiple index; that is, an item may be indexed in two or more places, to ensure access. Entries in the first part are keyed to sections of the Title index, as follows: A, articles; F, features; L, letters to the editor; E, editorials; and P, abstracts of papers. The number tells the issue number (no.) and page in the journal. You may go directly to the page, of course, or you may consult the Title index to discover whether the item is the one you are seeking. The second part of this subject index groups books reviewed in this volume by title. Authors and editors of books, not the reviewers) are mentioned in parentheses preceding the issue-and- page reference. Initial articles (a, an, the) of book titles have been dropped; that is, a title begins with its first sub- stantive word. 566 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, DECEMBER 1976</page><page sequence="2">Chemistry 6:368 P Choices pertaining to land pyramid 6:342 A Citations of BSCS materials 2:79 A Citizen responsibility 6:373 P role in environmental preservation 3:168 A Class size and individualization 9:546 F Class work, during January terms 5:297 F Classification 6:388 P Classroom activities 6:357 F;
