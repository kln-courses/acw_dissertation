<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Cognitive Bases of the Problem of Evil Abstract The problem of evil is a central issue in the philosophy of religion, for countless believers and skeptics alike. The attempt to resolve the dilemma of positing the existence of an omnipotent, omnibenevolent, creator while recognizing the presence of evil in the world has engaged philosophers and theologians for millennia. This article will not seek to resolve the dilemma but rather to explore the question of why there is a problem of evil. That is, why is it that gods are conceived in ways that give rise to this dilemma? The topic will be approached using insights into the religious mind being developed by the disciplines contributing to the Cognitive Science of Religion. The thesis to be developed is that this problem is a product of natural cognitive processes that give rise to god-beliefs, beliefs that are shaped by evolved moral intuitions. * * * For there are gods, and the knowledge of them is manifest; but they are not such as the multitude believe. . . . For the utterances of the multitude about the gods are not true preconceptions but false assumptions; hence it is that the greatest evils happen to the wicked and the greatest blessings happen to the good from the hand of the gods. - Epicurus Letter to Menoeceus 7. Introduction While not the more famous saying attributed to Epicurus on the gods, this passage makes two important claims relevant to religion: 1) that belief in the existence of gods, or supernatural agents in general, is "manifest" to, or comes naturally to, humans, and 2) that these supernatural agents are readily assumed to be morally interested beings who distribute rewards and punishments, accordingly. Belief in supernatural agency, whether in the form of gods, spirits, revered ancestors, ghosts, demons, "The Cognitive Bases of the Problem of Evil" by John Teehan, The Monist , vol. 96, no. 3, pp. 325-348.

It is, as Scott Atran puts it, "the most culturally recurrent, cognitively relevant, and evolutionarily compelling concept in religion" (Atran 2002, 57); and these supernatural agents are regularly understood to behave in ways that are significant for human welfare. Leaving aside the question of the existence of such agents, which Epicurus affirms, or the accuracy of this common moral assumption, which Epicurus rejects, the question that concerns us here, and which was of great concern to Epi- curus, is why humans so readily interpret their gods in morally-relevant ways. Why did the rumbling of the earth or the thundering of the sky drive our ancestors to devise rituals of appeasement? Why did Agamemnon believe that only his daughter's death could sate Artemis 's anger? And why would Abraham so readily accept that any god could demand a child as a burnt offering? A significant achievement of the several disciplines that contribute to the cognitive science of religion (CSR) is the develop- ment of a cognitive model that explains both the origin and the ubiquity of god-beliefs, and this model can shed light on moral assumptions about the gods and their responsibility for evil. Drawing on the findings of this field, I will argue that the problem of evil is generated by the cognitive processes that give rise to god-beliefs, as those beliefs are informed by evolved-moral intuitions. The 'problem' arises independent of doctrinal or theological teachings - its origin derives from the natural workings of our evolved social-brain. Before proceeding we first must clarify what I mean by "morally-relevant." In thinking about morality and the gods it would be inappropriate and inaccurate to use the monotheistic traditions as the default model. In these traditions there is an intimate connection between the nature of God and morality, but this understanding of gods is a relatively late and theologi- cally sophisticated development. It would be just as much a mistake, however, to assume that the gods of the older, polytheistic traditions were not morally significant. It is true that not all gods were viewed as moral role models, or even as interested in the moral behavior of humans. In fact, gods could be seen as malicious beings for whom humans held no moral worth. Still, even these gods may be morally-relevant. By 'morally- relevant gods' I mean supernatural beings whose actions impact on the welfare of humans and who can, in turn, be influenced by the actions of humans, whether through rituals, sacrifices, prayers, offerings, or by adher-</page><page sequence="3">THE COGNITIVE BASES OF THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 327 ing to a moral code. This establishes the rudiments of a relationship that generates moral expectations: the gods have demands of humans, when humans fulfill those demands they then expect the gods to act in a way that either benefits, or at least does not harm, human well-being. What the gods demand of us may not be morally good or right, as seen within some ethical framework - it may even seem cruel and unjust - but, be that as it may, meeting that demand creates an expectation of how the gods ought to respond, and their failure to do so is judged in moral terms, i.e., they have not acted rightly. Given this definition, even malicious spirits can be morally-relevant. It does not follow from this that every supernatural being need be morally-relevant. We can imagine supernatural beings that may be con- nected to natural processes having no direct impact on human welfare, as well as beings that perform their divine functions totally oblivious to the human consequences, or beings who cannot be influenced by human actions. These are all conceptually possible gods, but they will be irrelevant gods, not only in the sense of not fitting into the category of 'morally-relevant gods' but in the sense of not being of any concern to humans. The gods that become part of religious systems are the ones that are morally-rele- vant, and every religious tradition we know of contains such beings, and it is beliefs about these gods that lead to the problem of evil. Epicurus, of course, looms large in the history of this perennial problem in the philosophy of religion as he is credited with originally for- mulating the problem:1 if god is omnipotent, he can abolish evil, if he is omnibenevolent, he would want to abolish evil, since he is claimed to be both omnipotent and omnibenevolent, unde malum - whence evil? This remains one of the most challenging problems in religion, not only to philosophers and theologians, but to both believers and skeptics, alike; and the attempt to answer it, to develop a theodicy, has occupied the minds of some of the greatest thinkers in Western history. I believe that a cognitive scientific approach to evil has a contribution to make to the lit- erature on theodicy, but here we will address a more basic question: why is there a problem of evil at all? This is not a philosophical or theological question, but rather one of religious psychology - why is it that people come to view their gods in morally-relevant ways? We can only have a problem of evil if we first have a conception that god cares about human welfare and acts in a way that we can somehow recognize as just, or at</page><page sequence="4">328 JOHN TEEHAN least justifiable, and this appears to be a cross-culturally recurrent feature of beliefs about supernatural agents; but why should we conceive of gods in this way? Epicurus explicitly denounces this as superstitious thinking that results from projecting our needs and fears onto the gods. To Epicurus, the gods as divinely blessed beings cannot be disturbed by petty emotions and so can be neither angered nor pleased by the doings of humans. They are not morally-relevant beings and therefore the problem of evil does not arise, or rather it arises from a misconception about the nature of the gods. Once we clarify our conception of the gods, the problem of evil disap- pears. The gods neither cause nor allow evil to happen as a punishment, for the gods are completely beyond any concern with human existence. This is a neat solution to the problem but it is not one designed to appease the minds of believers as it effectively neutralizes the gods in relation to humanity - they have no relationship to human beings at all. The Epi- curean gods might as well not exist as far as humans are concerned, hence the charge of atheism against Epicurus (despite his very clear statement that the gods exist and we can have knowledge of them). Epicurus's solution, however, has been more palatable to skeptics. Belief about the gods is here a product of human fear and ignorance; it is a species of anthropomorphism and the problem of evil is a by-product of this anthropomorphism. While this may count as a credible attempt at a psychology of religion in the third century bce it is not much of an expla- nation. Even if our attribution of moral interests to the gods is an exercise in anthropomorphism, it leaves open the questions of why we anthropo- morphize in the first place, and further, why we should conceptualize these super-human beings as having moral concern with such inferior beings as humans. It is here that developments from CSR allow us to con- struct a more nuanced, and empirically grounded, naturalistic account of belief in morally relevant gods. We need to first examine the cognitive processes that underlie belief construction to learn how such processes, under particular but common circumstances, generate god-beliefs. These cognitive processes are themselves intertwined with processes that give rise to evolved moral intuitions, which imbue these beliefs with moral import. Then, by exploring the structure of our evolved moral psychology we will be able to identify the source of our moral expectations about gods.</page><page sequence="5">THE COGNITIVE BASES OF THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 329 2. The Construction of God-Beliefs CSR sees beliefs in gods as by-products of various mental tools2 which evolved to serve survival/reproductive needs. As Justin Barrett puts it, "belief in gods arises because of the natural functioning of completely normal mental tools working in common natural and social contexts" (2004, 21). One key foundational tool is referred to as an Agency Detection Device (Boyer 2001; Atran 2002; Barrett 2004; Atran and Norenzayan 2004; Tremlin 2006). Human cognition is hypersensitized to the presence of agents in the environment as agents (beings that act with intent) are often a source of mortal danger. Surviving in a dangerous and uncertain world, a world of predators and prey, requires that we be prepared to respond appropriately to possible signs of danger, and so evolution would favor a cognitive strategy that leads to a preponderance of false-positives (mistakenly detecting the presence of an agent) over false-negatives (failing to detect the presence of an agent). When the rustling in the bushes, or the undistinguished object ahead, may be a predator it is much better to be safe than sorry. The value of this cognitive strategy is such that this tool has become hair-triggered, it is in Barrett's terms, hyperactive (2004, 31-32). Identifying a potential agent is a vital first step, but not a sufficient one. We need more information about that agent in order to determine the proper response to it. The detection of agency triggers other mental tools; of particular importance is the Theory of Mind tool (ToM) which leads us to ascribe mental states to the agent (Boyer 2001; Tremlin 2006): it has desires, interests, intentions. Indeed, to perceive the presence of an agent involves the engagement of our ToM - that the underdetermined object is acting with intent is what leads it to be categorized as an agent. Deter- mining the particular mental state of an agent is essential to devising an appropriate response. This step is aided by further categorizing the agent by placing it into an ontological category. Ontological categories function as files of general information about different types of objects regularly encountered in the environment, e.g., Tool, Plant, Animal, Person. By placing an object into an ontological category we access the store of general information that generates intuitive expectations about that object (Boyer 2001; Barrett 2004; Tremlin 2006). For example, in categorizing an underdetermined object as Animal we gain automatic access to intu-</page><page sequence="6">330 JOHN TEEHAN itions about animals, e.g., they can be dangerous when disturbed, they can be predators, they can be sources of food, they track movement and sound in their environment, they can be hungry, they can be aggressive, etc. We do not need to walk up to the object and poke it with a stick to see what it will do (which could be an evolutionarily disastrous, not to mention per- sonally painful, move). In determining how to best categorize an object, sometimes the envi- ronmental setting provides clues but sometimes it does not. In such situations, Stewart Guthrie has argued that the best move is to overinter- pret the situation, i.e., to bring to bear the most significant model available. For humans, this model is that of Person. This, argues Guthrie, is the origin of anthropomorphism (Guthrie 1993). We interpret the world in human terms not because of egoism, or comfort, or familiarity, but because Persons are the most significant beings in our environment. Other humans present the potentially most dangerous and most beneficial agents we encounter. Also, since humans can act at a distance (through the use of traps and weapons) and can make themselves functionally invisible (through the use of deception and disguise) you can never rule out the presence of another human (Guthrie 1993, 85-89). Given the competive- ness, the power, the deceptive abilities of humans, in the face of underdetermined stimuli the strategy that often provides the most signifi- cant information in determining a course of action is to categorize the agent as Person. So when Epicurus, anticipating a host of other projection theorists, argues that our (mis)conceptions about the gods are born out of fear and ignorance, he is correct - in a sense. The mental tools that give rise to god- beliefs evolved as adaptations to provide humans with strategies to respond to the dangerous and uncertain world of our environment of evolutionary adaptation. This claim, however, seems to imply a criticism that people came to believe in the gods due to a lack of proper courage or education - that it was a failure of either moral or intellectual virtue. But note, the fear was well founded, there was much to be afraid of in the world; and a certain amount of ignorance was unavoidable given the complex, dynamic nature of that world, and given the need to act quickly in an environment populated with underdetermined, yet potentially fatal, stimuli. The virtu- ous Paleolithic hunter who strode bravely up to the underdetermined</page><page sequence="7">THE COGNITIVE BASES OF THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 331 object and examined it carefully in a spirit of intellectual curiosity had a much better chance of ending up a predator's lunch than did his compa- triot who ran away on the intuitive inference that the object was a tiger. It is essential to keep in mind that these mental tools are not con- sciously employed. They work at a prereflective level, generating quick, automatic, and compelling intuitions. One of the most significant findings coming out of cognitive science is that this prereflective level of cognition constitutes the greater part of our mental life, and that the slower, more deliberative cognition we associate with rationality is relatively weak in comparison (Haidt 2001; Greene and Haidt 2002; Barrett 2004; Kahne- man 2011). Evolution favored the actor over the thinker in situations of urgency and uncertainty, and those actions are motivated by these prere- flective mental tools. The mental tools discussed thus far set the grounds for the origin of god-beliefs. God-beliefs can be seen to arise as recurrent false-positive attributions of agency, categorized as Persons, in response to underdeter- mined stimuli in situations of urgency. In categorizing gods as Persons a set of intuitive expectations of what those gods are like is generated. Specific beliefs about gods need not be explicitly taught but arise naturally based on these categorical expec- tations; and studies suggest that doctrinal teachings about the gods which work against these intuitions are at a distinct disadvantage in terms of memorability and transmission (Barrett 1999, Slone, 2004). But of course, a god is not just any Person. Gods are distinct from typical members of the category Person by fact of violating certain expec- tations. Atran argues that "gods and other supernatural beings are systematically unlike us in a few general ways - more powerful, longer lived, more knowledgeable... - and predictably like us in an enormously broader range of usual ways" (2002, 93). For example, when we apply the intuitions generated by our ToM, relative to Persons, to our concep- tions of the gods we intuitively understand the gods to have intentions, goals, desires, etc.; but we also attribute to gods special mental abilities. In regard to natural persons we assume limited access to the mental content of other minds, which is why it is possible to successfully lie to others, but supernatural persons, i.e. gods, are often conceived as having access to important information unavailable to humans. This is not to say</page><page sequence="8">332 JOHN TEEHAN we conceive of gods as omniscient, nor do we attribute such ability to all gods (some gods can be deceived) but being a "full access strategic agent" violates the intuitive expectations of Persons, and marks the agent so con- ceived as a supernatural being (Boyer 2001; Atran 2002; Barrett 2004; Tremlin 2006). This has been but a sketch of the evolved-cognitive bases of god- beliefs, still it should suffice to provide the foundation to make sense of our moral assumptions about gods. What we need to take from this is that beliefs about supernatural beings are grounded in pancultural mental tools that generate nonreflective, automatic intuitions about gods that provide the template cultures work with to flesh out their particular god-beliefs. These intuitions derive from categorical expectations about Persons, but involve violations of that category. Therefore, if we can identify those intuitive expectations relevant to morality we will uncover how moral assumptions about the gods are generated. 3. Evolved Moral Cognition and the Gods From an evolutionary perspective morality is understood in terms of pro-social behavior/cooperation. For cognitive tendencies toward pro- social behavior to be favored by evolution such behavior must tend to contribute to inclusive fitness. For creatures, such as humans, who pursue inclusive fitness within stable social groupings, behavior which con- tributes to the success and survival of the group may contribute to long-term inclusive fitness of the individual members by contributing to an environment in which such pursuits may be successfully carried out. Humans not only evolved as social beings, but evolved from an even more ancient lineage of social animals. It follows that this has given rise to a set of mental tools that facilitates social exchanges. There is a large and growing literature on the evolution of the moral mind,3 but it will suffice for our purposes to set out some of the key components of our evolved moral psychology. Social cooperation is a risky business. It often entails making an investment in the group as a whole, or contributing to the welfare of an individual member of the group. This constitutes a cost, as the resources invested in others could have been used to promote the inclusive fitness of the cooperator. This cost can be mitigated, however. If others in the group make similarly costly investments in society's welfare then no individual</page><page sequence="9">THE COGNITIVE BASES OF THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 333 is put at a relative disadvantage; furthermore, the more members who invest in the group, the greater the chance of group success, which func- tions as a return on my investment. In terms of contributing to the welfare of a particular individual, this cost is neutralized if that contribution is rec- iprocated, either directly from the person receiving the contribution, or indirectly from the group.4 This calculus of social cooperation underlies two prominent aspects of our moral mind: fairness and reciprocity. Despite generations of economists who have asserted that humans are rational actors seeking to maximize gain and minimize loss, work from several disciplines is demonstrating that humans often act against their interests (understood strictly in terms of cost/benefit ratios) and act instead on an innate sense of fairness. Humans will often forgo a benefit, and incur a cost, if they perceive that they are being treated unfairly. Some of the evidence for this is provided by behavioral economic experiments employing the Ultimatum game. In the Ultimatum game two subjects have to split a sum of money. One subject - the proposer - is instructed to determine how to divide the money with the second subject - the responder - who in turn has the option of accepting or rejecting the offer. If the offer is accepted then both individuals receive the sums proposed, but if the responder rejects the offer, neither one gets anything. This is a one-shot interaction and the sub- jects do not know each other. What should happen? If both are rationally self-interested, then the proposer should offer a small cut of the money to the responder, who should accept it; but in fact this is not what typically happens. Instead responders regularly reject what they consider to be unfair offers, with studies showing "a robust result . . . that proposals giving the responder shares below 25% of the available money are rejected with a very high probability." Furthermore, the proposers seem to intuitively anticipate this response as the most common proposal in these games is close to 50/50 (Fehr and Fischbacher 2003, 786). A cross-cul- tural study of the Ultimatum game involving participants from fifteen diverse cultures found that while there are "substantial differences across populations" there is also "a universal pattern, with an increasing propor- tion of individuals from every society choosing to punish [i.e. reject offers] as offers approach zero" (Henrich, et al. 2006, 1769). Individuals act in ways that lead to a loss of benefits out of a sense of fairness. Inter- estingly, this phenomenon is not restricted to humans. A study of capuchin</page><page sequence="10">334 JOHN TEEHAN monkeys demonstrates that these animals will also refuse rewards when compatriots are arbitrarily given superior rewards for completing the same task (Brosnan and deWaal 2003). Related to this innate sensitivity to fairness, humans also are sensi- tively attuned to those who fail to reciprocate acts of social investment, i.e., cheaters or defectors. Given the importance of social cooperation, and the costliness of being cheated in social exchanges, being able to detect and discourage cheaters is a vital skill and our cognitive evolution has equipped us with tools to facilitate successful social exchanges. Indeed, it has been proposed that the need to manage social exchanges within large, complex, social settings was a significant factor in the evolution of the human brain (Dunbar 1997; Whiten and Byrne 1997). Numerous mental tools have been suggested as playing a role in facilitating social exchange, including one referred to as a cheater detection module (Barkow, Cos- mides, and Tooby 1992). In one relevant study researchers took snapshots of participants in a one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma Game at the moment they were making their decision to cheat or cooperate. These photos were then shown to subjects who were told nothing about the conditions under which the photos were taken and were asked to predict which individuals were likely to be cooperative. Subjects accurately labeled the actual cheaters as potential cheaters at a significant level. To control for possible implicit biases toward particular facial features, the researchers took snap- shots of their Prisoner's Dilemma participants prior to their playing the game and presented these "neutral" pictures to a group of subjects, asking them to predict who would be cooperative. In this case photos of individ- uals who would later cheat were no more likely to be labeled a potential cheater than those who would later cooperate. The researchers concluded that subjects were cueing in on subtle facial signals of cheating rather than responding to some standard facial features (Vanneste, et al. 2007; Ver- plaeste, Vanneste, and Braeckman 2007). Humans are not only sensitized to signals of cheating/defection, we are also prepared to punish such behaviors (Boyd and Richerson 1992; Fehr and Gachter 2002), primed to act by a suite of moral emotions that are triggered by acts of defection from established/perceived standards of fairness (Frank 1988; Nesse 1990; Haidt 2001; Greene and Haidt 2002). Researchers have even discovered neurological correlates of this emotional distaste for cheaters. Studies show that socially cooperative behavior acti-</page><page sequence="11">THE COGNITIVE BASES OF THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 335 vates reward systems in the brain, while violations of the social code trigger negative emotional brain responses (Rillings, et al. 2002; Seymour, Singer, and Dolan 2002; Spitzer, et al. 2007; Buckholtz, et al. 2008). One study showed that not only does cooperative behavior activate the brain's reward systems but witnessing cheaters suffer can also be neurologically rewarding (Singer, et al. 2006; see also Singer 2006). While our evolved moral psychology is more much complex than presented here, we now may gain some insight into the moral psychology of the gods. The gods are understood in terms generated by our intuitive expectations of Persons. A vital aspect of those expectations involves our moral intuitions, that is, those intuitions about how Persons perceive and respond to the rules of social exchange. This is not some minor subsystem of the category but is central to the survival and fitness goals of social beings. Knowing what to expect of others, who can be trusted and who can not, how they are likely to respond to our behaviors, what they expect of us, and how these expectations apply to different individuals, are key to successful social negotiations, and this is true whether those others are humans or gods: what do the gods expect of us? How will they respond if we fail to meet those expectations? What can we expect in return from the gods? Again, these issues need not arise in regard to all supernatural beings; it is possible that there are gods who are believed to occupy a place in the pantheon that does not concern human beings, but such gods will be of little concern to us. The gods that matter, those that interact with humans or control aspects of the universe significant to human existence, will invariably trigger these questions, and the answers to these questions will be informed by the intuitive moral expectations we have of Persons : failure to give to a Person what he perceives as his due prompts moral outrage; failure to give to a powerful Person what he demands prompts anger and revenge; give to Persons what they need or desire and we can expect a more positive outcome, be it gratitude, reciprocation, or at least to be left alone. As it is on earth, so it is in heaven. Of course, these sorts of human-divine interactions do not necessar- ily paint the gods as moral beings - what they want or expect may be prompted not by moral concern but from less exalted motivations - but it does present them as morally-relevant beings. Our behavior can prompt a response from the gods that in turn impacts on our well-being, and not just our well-being but on the welfare of our family and our society. Accord-</page><page sequence="12">336 JOHN TEEHAN ing to Epicurus the common assumption about the gods was that "the greatest evils happen to the wicked and the greatest blessings happen to the good from the hand of the gods." Now we can recognize that this assumption is so common, and so compelling, because it follows from the way the mind constructs god-beliefs. Of course, how to define "wicked" and "good" so as to determine what it is that people have done to deserve their treatment is open to great variation, and here cultural factors come into play. This role played by culture is significant; it provides an expla- nation of the differences between religious moral practices, but it is one of fleshing out intuitions rather than a strictly determinative role. What the gods want and expect is not wholly arbitrary or culturally relative. 4. Morally Concerned Gods The model presented here of the construction of god-beliefs works from the position that such beliefs are by-products of mental tools that evolved to serve survival and reproductive challenges faced by our ances- tors. This by-product position is open to debate, although it appears to me the more compelling explanation of the ultimate origins of god-beliefs. However, once such beliefs become a cultural resource for a group they come to assume a significant role in human evolution (whether this is to be understood in terms of cultural evolution or biological evolution is also open to debate).5 As we have discussed, solving the problem of cooperation is essen- tial for the success of any group. The suite of moral intuitions and the powerful emotional responses to those who violate these intuitive moral expectations makes cooperation possible. Still, the temptation to gain a personal advantage by defecting from norms of social cooperation is an ever-present danger to social cohesion and this danger increases as group size increases (since the ability to keep track of who is or is not cooperat- ing becomes more difficult in larger groups, as does the potential to cheat undetected). Gods possess valuable traits that make them uniquely suited to assume a moral role in society. Gods have access to information typi- cally unavailable to humans and they may be watching you at any moment. Studies show that cooperative behavior increases, and defection from cooperation decreases, in situations in which the behavior is being observed. In fact, humans are so sensitive to their reputations for being fair and cooperative that even images in the shape of eyes have an impact</page><page sequence="13">THE COGNITIVE BASES OF THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 337 on behavior (Haley and Kessler 2005). One study found that simply men- tioning that a testing room is rumored to be haunted by a spirit resulted in a decrease in cheating (Bering, et al. 2005). A culturally shared belief in powerful beings that watch over the group and respond in morally rele- vant ways functions to promote cooperation within the group and discourage cheating, thus facilitating the growth of larger and more complex groups, which is the hallmark of our species (Johnson and Kruger 2004; Johnson 2005; Johnson and Bering 2006; Teehan 2010). The belief in morally-rel- evant gods concerned with the behavior of members of the group goes hand in hand with the development of human civilization. Just how far back the conjunction goes is uncertain, but clearly by the time of our ear- liest settled communities gods (or spirits, or revered ancestors, etc.) had come to play a central social-moral role in all civilizations for which we have records. What will these morally concerned gods be concerned with? They will primarily be concerned with the behavior of the members of the in- group. Why? Because human morality develops as an adaptation to facilitate social exchange with those individuals with whom I must inter- act on a regular basis and whose behavior can impact on my inclusive fitness - i.e., the in-group. This sets the contours of our intuitive morality and so sets our intuitive expectations of the gods (HÃ¤rtung 1995; Teehan 2010). They will respond with anger and seek to punish those who cheat or defect from the social contract; they will be pleased with and reward those who follow the group's norms, and those who sacrifice for the good of the group. How do we know these things about the gods? These are, of course, teachings common to all religions but they do not have to be taught. What specifically we must do to uphold the social contract between ourselves and to maintain the bond between our group and the gods is largely culturally determined and must be taught, but the general moral psychology of the gods does not. It flows naturally from our intu- itive expectations about Persons, which is the foundation of our intuitive beliefs about the gods. Those are wicked who act in ways that violate the social contract or who disrupt the bond between the group and the gods, and the gods will punish the wicked because they are concerned about these bonds. We are almost ready to turn to the problem of evil, but first there is one more preliminary issue to consider.</page><page sequence="14">338 JOHN TEEHAN 5. "What Are Human Beings, That You Make so Much of Them?" (Job 7:17) We now have the cognitive grounding for understanding the problem of evil. The common misconception that Epicurus decried turns out to be our cognitive default position in regards to the gods - they punish the wicked and bless the good. But this is not some trivial "misconception." For example, theologians argue that the attribution of physical character- istics to God, such as gender, is a misconception of the divine nature, one that seems impossible to eradicate. Yet even this ubiquitous and intractable misconception pales in significance compared to the error Epi- curus claims to have identified. The idea of a god who is neither male nor female may be intuitively difficult to grasp but its truth bears little practi- cal significance in the lives of believers. But a god who does not punish the wicked or reward the good, who is not concerned with our behavior, is either a mind-numbing terror or wholly irrelevant. Let's consider these two options. While belief in morally-relevant gods can be comforting, providing a sense of security against the dangers of both social and existential chaos, it can also be terrifying. In fact the opening quotation from Epicurus comes from a letter to a disciple summarizing his philosophy on how to live a good life. The first thing one must do, Epicurus tells Menoeceus, is to recognize the true nature of the gods, which is that they are imper- turbable and so beyond concern with human doings. This recognition of divine indifference frees one from the fear of the gods, which Epicurus sees as a major impediment to human happiness. While it appears that those who embraced the Epicurean philosophy were able to integrate this corrected view of the gods into their pursuit of the good life, the more common reaction was rejection and vilification. Perhaps more than any other ancient thinker, Epicurus drew the impassioned ire of opponents, both philosophic and religious, in his own time and throughout the ages. The source of much of that ire was this view of the gods. Epicurus makes the gods irrelevant: a god who is wholly unconcerned and uninvolved with human affairs might as well not exist. On pragmatic grounds, Epicu- rus 's philosophy is atheistic to the core, despite his affirmation of the gods' existence, and atheism is a cognitively demanding position. A key implication of the evolved-cognitive model of religion is that belief in supernatural agency comes naturally, and compellingly, to humans,</page><page sequence="15">THE COGNITIVE BASES OF THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 339 grounded as it is in innate and powerful nonreflective processes. Atheism requires the suppression of those intuitive processes via deliberative cog- nitive processes that operate at a relatively disadvantaged position (Barrett 2004). Atheism, also, does not enjoy the cultural reinforcement that reli- gion does, further hindering its acceptance and resiliency. Even in the modern, technologically advanced, scientifically sophisticated, Western world only a fraction of the population rejects belief in all supernatural beings. Belief in supernatural agents is the default position for human minds and these beliefs are generated by intuitive expectations about Persons, intuitions that are inextricably bound up with moral expectations. To believe that there are gods, or a god, but believe that the gods are not morally relevant beings is deeply dissonant - it is, on cognitive grounds, the functional equivalent of atheism, and so it too will be at a tremendous disadvantage in competition with more intuition-friendly god-beliefs. This may explain why if people believe in gods they believe those gods to be morally-relevant. But why believe that they are morally just? Why not accept that the gods intervene in human affairs but in an arbitrary or inscrutable way? One answer is that such a belief would also create cogniti ve/emotional challenges. To believe that there are supernatural agents who regularly act in ways that significantly impact on our well- being, even our survival, but that we have no way to understand, anticipate, or affect those actions, that we are utterly impotent in the face of possibly malicious forces that surround us and all those we love, is a source of fear far greater than that provoked by the god-beliefs Epicurus sought to combat. Not only would such a belief induce terror, it would also be at odds with the very processes that generate god-beliefs in the first place. The attribution of agency, and so intentionality, is a basic cognitive strat- egy that enables us to formulate a response. The perception of supernatural agency is a further application of that cognitive strategy. To formulate a belief in a god is to attribute agency and intentionality; to attribute intentionality is to bring into play our ToM, that is, to generate expectations about the agent in question; and when the agent in question is a god, this means to generate expectations based on our intuitive expec- tations about Persons, and these include moral intuitions. Humans also appear to be cognitively predisposed to interpret events in teleological terms. We seek out patterns and order because such regu- larities in our environment may provide significant strategic information;</page><page sequence="16">340 JOHN TEEHAN and the tendency to see intent behind such regularities gives us a frame- work for understanding that strategic information. Deborah Kelemen finds this predisposition to read purpose and design into the world to be so robust that she sees our natural stance toward the world as one of "promis- cuous teleology" (Kelemen 1999, 2004; Kelemen and DiYanni 2005). If terrible events happen we expect there to be a cause because we are cog- nitively biased to interpret the world in teleological terms. If these terrible events are not clearly the work of natural agents, supernatural agents can supply the causal explanation. Agents cause harm to others when they are angry at the victim's behavior, or as a way of signaling some form of displeasure. By deter- mining the cause of that displeasure we gain some traction on how to respond; but whatever the cause, we intuitively recognize that the gods punish the wicked - those that have displeased them through acts of com- mission or omission - and bless the good either by a reward or by withholding punishment. The panoply of religious rituals, rites, and sac- rifices expresses this basic cognitive strategy: the gods mete out rewards and punishments and we can affect those actions by discerning the inten- tionality behind those acts and responding accordingly. Now, of course, the intentions motivating these divine acts need not be morally motivated; many acts of the gods seem simply to be displays of power designed to extract the proper obeisance from humans. But as god-beliefs become more closely intertwined with social interactions, the intentionality of the gods is conceived in more distinctly moral terms - the gods punish those who violate moral expectations, either by not giving the gods their due or by breaking the social contract. It is at this point that the problem of evil can arise. 6. Unde Malum? The problem of evil, in its most basic terms, arises when there is a perceived disconnect between the behavior of the individual or society and the actions of the gods, i.e., when the gods punish those who do not deserve it. To intentionally cause or allow harm to someone who has not offended moral expectations is to violate the basic intuitions that allow us to make sense of the gods, and consequently the world we live in. In a polytheistic tradition there may be some gods who are evil, who do not</page><page sequence="17">THE COGNITIVE BASES OF THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 341 adhere to any recognizable moral code, but such a god is not the god who oversees the moral bonds of society. In polytheism the problem of evil only arises when the perceived violation of moral intuitions involves the morally concerned god who oversees the in-group, but the problem of evil does arise in polytheistic systems, as ancient literature from both Egypt and Mesopotamia attest (Laato and De Moor 2003). However, it becomes more acute in monotheistic traditions when any appearance of evil refers back to the actions of the one and only god. The possibility that God, whether understood as the "one, true god" or as the high god who oversees society, inflicts harm on the undeserving undermines a cognitively basic understanding of god. It is a challenge to the very core of god-beliefs, not simply as theological doctrine but as products of our evolved-cognitive minds, and it is a challenge that demands a response. The response need not be theologically or philo- sophically sophisticated, indeed many theodicies are not, it only need fit with our intuitive moral expectations about Persons (we might refer to such a defense of god as a folk theodicy). For example, consider the Bib- lical flood narrative. Here, God inflicts devastating punishment on a global scale, which prima facie might count as an example of evil, yet this narrative is often used as an example of God's moral outrage; not as his violation of morality. We are told, Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight, and the earth was filled with vio- lence. And God saw that the earth was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted its ways upon the earth. And God said to Noah, "I have determined to make an end of all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence because of them; now I am going to destroy them along with the earth." (Gen. 6:11-13) Noah, however, is to be spared, because he was "a righteous man, blame- less in his generation" (Gen. 6:9). In other words, God is meting out rewards and punishments on recognizable moral grounds: the corrupt and violent suffer, the righteous are rewarded - our moral intuitions are satisfied. Of course, our reflective, deliberate mind may not be as easily convinced; one could certainly question the moral justness in meting out punishment to the countless children who would undoubtedly be washed away in the flood. This seems a fair point. However, here, as with many of our religious beliefs (and not just religious beliefs, but with our intu- itive, nonreflective beliefs in general) when there is a conflict between</page><page sequence="18">342 JOHN TEEHAN deeply held intuitions and empirical facts, a solution that preserves those intuitions is going to be privileged over any reflective doubts. At other times, however, those empirical facts may be too numerous or too undeniable to be readily incorporated into intuitions about divine justice, and a more sophisticated defense is called for. We have a wonder- ful dramatization of this in one of the earliest and still most powerful explorations of the problem of evil: the Book of Job. The Book of Job, as it has come down to us in its final form, presents the problem of evil in its most challenging variety: a clearly innocent man suffering grievously at the hands of God for no morally justifiable reason. We know this is the case as the prologue to the book tells us just this. Of Job we are told, "There is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man who fears God and turns away from evil" and we are told this by God himself (Job 1:8). God then allows Satan to visit all kinds of evil upon Job. His children are killed; his possessions are destroyed; he is infected with loathsome sores (Job 1:13-19, 2:7) and all of this is unde- served - we know this and Job knows this, but his friends who come to "comfort" him do not. This sets up an extended deliberation on the justice of God. Job's friends recognize him to be a good and righteous man; they can find no fault with his behavior or character, yet when Job claims that he is suffering unjustly they rebuke him. They reject their own experience with Job, they repudiate the testimony of their revered friend, and defend God. First his friend, Eliphaz, offers up the standard theodicy: "Think now, who that was innocent ever perished? Or where were the upright cut off? As I have seen, those who plough iniquity and sow trouble reap the same. By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger they are con- sumed" (Job 4:7-9). Even though neither Job nor Eliphaz can identify any fault in Job, there must be a fault or else the whole project collapses. In the face of apparently damning evidence against God, his friends resort to the inscrutability of God's moral standards: "Can mortals be righteous before God? Can human beings be pure before their Maker?" (Job 4:17). Later in the debate Zophar picks up this theme: "Know then that God exacts of you less than your guilt deserves. Can you find out the deep things of God? Can you find out the limit of the Almighty?" (Job 1 1 :6-8). This is an interesting and not uncommon move in developing a theodicy: God's ways are beyond human comprehension, therefore our</page><page sequence="19">THE COGNITIVE BASES OF THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 343 inability to recognize the justness of God's ways constitutes an intellec- tual fault on our part, not a moral fault on God's. But notice, in this argument God is not totally inscrutable. Job's friends still know some- thing about God's nature and his ways - that they are just, i.e., they meet the demands of our moral expectations. We may not know why God allows suffering, we may not be able to grasp the moral standard God applies to humans, but we can know that whatever his reasons, or what- ever his standards, they are just. How do we know this? Here is where admonitions to faith often come in, a move that offends the rational demands of the skeptic. Cognitive science allows us a different insight into this move. When deeply grounded cognitive intuitions are challenged by empirical facts, it is not simply rationality that is challenged. It is a set of intuitive, often deeply felt, expectations about how to understand the world that is challenged; and the psychological demand to satisfy these intuitions is more powerful than the psychological demands to satisfy our rationality, at least in many cases. This is one of the things that makes the Book of Job so fascinating. It seems to reject the demands of our moral intuitions in favor of a ratio- nally satisfying defense, and when it becomes clear to Job that there is no such rational defense he rejects the justness of God: "It is all one; there- fore I say, he destroys both the blameless and the wicked. When disaster brings sudden death, he mocks at the calamity of the innocent. The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; he covers the eyes of its judges - if it is not he, who then is it?" (Job 9:22-24) And as we have discussed, such a realization fills him with terror so that all he can hope for is a quick death. Before he dies, however, he has one last wish: he wants to meet God face-to-face and have him defend his actions, and here perhaps the great- est twist in Biblical literature occurs. God comes down to speak with Job, but rather than "justifying the ways of God to man" God viciously berates Job for thinking that he can apply human standards to the deity; and even more shocking, God does not side with Job's friends who claim that humans simply cannot understand the grounds of divine justice. He goes further and asserts that humans have no grounds for having any moral expectations of God. In fact, God is angered at Job's friends, who spent much of the book defending God's justice, for this very error. This is a startling conclusion to God's self-defense against the charge of evil, as it seems to put God completely outside the bounds of moral expectations,</page><page sequence="20">344 JOHN TEEHAN without making the Epicurean move of denying God's culpability for human suffering; and such a God, as I have argued, provokes the kind of terror Job experienced. Interestingly, however, while God's speech ends there, the book does not. In the final section God restores all he had taken from Job, and more; then the book concludes on the optimistic note that "Job died, old and full of days" - a Biblical formula indicating a good life. Ultimately, Job's faith is rewarded, his suffering recompensed: the demands of our evolved moral cognition are satisfied.6 7. Conclusion The cognitive scientific study of religion offers a powerful approach to the project of naturalizing religious belief, and is one of the most sig- nificant developments in the study of religion. Attempts to offer naturalistic explanations for religious beliefs go back at least as far as Epi- curus. But all such attempts, regardless of how compelling the evidential arguments proffered in their support may have seemed at the time, were hindered by the fact that they are based on a prescientific view of the mind - and this is just as true of Freud as it is of Epicurus. It is only recently that we have come to the verge of a true science of the mind, as advances in, e.g., neuroscience, evolutionary and cognitive psychology, and behavioral economics open up a deeper and more empirically ver- ifiable model of human cognition. This is not to disparage or reject those earlier attempts, as indeed many were quite insightful and remain so. However, a sound naturalistic account of religious belief requires a sound naturalistic account of human cognition, and therefore such a project needs to be grounded in contemporary cognitive science. Of course, the conclusions drawn about the naturalistic origins of religious beliefs are only as strong as the cognitive theories upon which they are based, and as stated we are merely on the verge of a sound science of the mind. Still, enough has been accomplished in this endeavor to allow us to begin the project of applying the findings of cognitive science to issues in the philosophy of religion. Promising efforts have been made, for example, to uncover the cognitive bases of the teleological and cosmo- logical arguments (De Cruz and De Smedt 2010; De Smedt and De Cruz 2011) and there is a robust interest in questions of the justifiability of reli- gious beliefs in the light of CSR (Schloss and Murray 2009).7</page><page sequence="21">THE COGNITIVE BASES OF THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 345 By expanding the cognitive study of religion to incorporate the findings of the cognitive study of morality, we now have the tools to develop a nat- uralistic account of religious morality. Understanding how our evolved moral cognition shapes our beliefs about god's moral nature can open new paths into numerous issues in the study of religion. Uncovering the cog- nitive grounds for the problem of evil is just one example of such a project; however, given the significance of this problem to religious belief the ramifications of such a project may be far ranging. This is not the place to develop specific implications but allow me to conclude with a general claim that if religious beliefs can be successfully naturalized, grounded in a sound cognitive science, then the attempt to rationally justify faith must begin anew and grapple with the findings of this paradigm. John Teehan Hofstra University Notes 1 . We do not find this in any of the extant works of Epicurus; the tradition of attribut- ing this to Epicurus seems to originate with the 4th century Christian apologist, Lactantius, who may have had access to such documents. 2. What the most apt metaphor is for the mental processes being discussed is an unre- solved issue. I will use the term "mental tools" to refer to specialized mental functions for processing environmental information that are proposed to underlie various species-wide cognitive and behavioral strategies. 3.

Scholars believe that this epilogue to the Book of Job, along with the prologue, come from a distinct document that was added to frame the long disquisition on evil. It is interesting to speculate that ancient editors of the Bible opted for this ending as it was more consistent with our moral cognition, perhaps recognizing on an intuitive level that the god that confronts Job just will not serve as a morally concerned deity. This must remain speculation, of course, particularly given the uncertain dating of the composition of Job. 7.
