Memes, Intelligent Design, and Chapter 4 Nabokov1 He told me about the odours of butterflies — musk and  vanilla; about the voices of butterflies; about the piercing sound given out  by the monstrous caterpillar of a Malayan hawkmoth, an improvement on  the mouselike squeak of our Death’s Head moth; about the small resonant  tympanum of certain tiger moths; about the cunning butterfly in the Brazilian  forest which imitates the whirr of a local bird. He told me about the incredible  wit of mimetic disguise, which was not explainable by the struggle for existence  (the rough haste of evolution’s unskilled forces), was too reflned for the mere  deceiving of accidental predators, feathered, scaled, and otherwise (not very  fastidious, but then not too fond of butterflies), and seemed to have been  invented by some waggish artist precisely for the intelligent eyes of man...

According to  this strategy the artist must be able to observe and name the phenomenal  world like the naturalist, the naturalist must be able to integrate different  planes of reality like the artist, and somewhere in between — is it random?  is it conscious? — an event takes place that is profoundly creative. VN’s  creations, like the fantastically tinted and drawn-to-perfection butterflies,  many with real genera but playful, imaginary species, that he conjured  out of thin air to inscribe first editions of his work to Vera, all bear the  imprint of his “ludic logo.”3 Of VN’s many commentators, Brian Boyd has  had the most to say on this topic, with others like Stephen Blackwell  and Victoria Alexander adding to and refining our knowledge. Be that as  it may, the subject is by no means exhausted, nor is it likely to be any  time soon. In the pages to follow I would like to join in the conversation. First of all, let us restate the givens. Nabokov is a one-of-a-kind phenomenon;  that is, in his terms, which he insisted upon with his playful arrogance, a  128. cunning butterfly in a Brazilian forest that can imitate the whirr of a local  PART I bird.

If one describes VN’s case not metaphorically but  supposedly factually, objectively, he is a genius.

To those of us who read his novels, chess  problems, and lepidopterological studies the man’s phenotypic presence  on earth between 1899 and 1977 seems not only a stroke of genetic and  environmental good luck.4 We want to believe there is more, perhaps a  kind of unnatural selection. This notion of uniqueness, “chosenness,”  simultaneously partakes of the romantic poet as genius figure (poet  bozh’ei milost’iu) going back to Pushkin in the Russian tradition, another  thing of which VN was keenly aware. Such arch classification, where the  exhibit is not merely homo sapiens, but some marked subspecies of the  latter (homo scribens, homo ludens), may have been VN’s point, at least  publicly, but can we really say with intellectual honesty it is the point now,  in the time-space in which the man’s creations continue to exist after  his passing? On the one hand, we have the cultural (here high cultural)  argument: genius is noticed, mediocrity is invisible. The “meme” that is a  robust VN idea and the “memeplex” that is a VN novel are then replicated  (obviously not faithfully!) in our brains as “patterns of neuronal wiring- 129. up” that get passed on via cultural transmission.5 On the other hand, Chapter 4 we have the scientific argument: the information from genetic material  travels only in one direction, from the DNA-bases (ACGT) and codons that  specify a certain amino acid or code for (or against) protein synthesis  frequently in scientific literature “memeplex” and has attempted to before they understand what it is  to describe how memes “cooper- address them in his subsequent they are learning) is not the same  ate” with each other (by analogy essays and books: 1) that the as that involved in understanding,  to genes) in order to construct fidelity present in the replication and using, a system that seems,  more elaborate cultural systems of a very complex cultural artifact in its complexity, to model life  which then protect and preserve is understandably rather low itself.

Phenotypes cannot speak back to (chemically code  in reverse) genotypes.6 What if, though, simply for the sake of argument we placed VN and his thinking  about the art-science divide back into the evolutionary process, but the  evolutionary process writ large. By “writ large” I do not mean sociobiology,  which as brilliantly as it is presented by Wilson still has a clear scientific  bias and does not — cannot? — do justice to the linguistic complexity of  a Nabokov novel or a Mandelstam poem. Rather what I have in mind is  attempting to understand terms like “reproductive viability,” “survival,”  and “fitness” both literally and figuratively, in the sort of broad sense that  would do justice to the most complexly constructed cultural artifact. It is  a truism but one worth repeating: scientific discourse, which is primarily  metonymic, and poetic discourse, which is primarily metaphoric, are  always already at odds. Their ways of framing the world cancel out  each other. If we mix the integrative aspect of poetic language with the  130. classificatory precision of scientific language, as VN does in the famous  PART I Dar passage, what we get is a new subspecies of discourse, one that may  be enchanting, but one which we already know beforehand practicing  scientists will not accept as probative. Such language is never proving  one thing, unless that one thing is many things, many ways of looking  at and experiencing and mentally processing the world, at once. And yet,  this may not be an obstacle. It could be an evolutionary stimulus. Here  I suspect Dawkins is a more trustworthy guide than Wilson: “We are built  as gene machines and cultured as meme machines, but we have the  power to turn against our own creators. We, alone on earth, can rebel  against the tyranny of the selfish replicators.”7 Is there a way to look at  this “rebellion” as itself potentially evolutionary? In this respect, VN’s  way of thinking may be “memetically wired-up” to survive, and to help us  survive, which is presumably the same thing. It is a question that is in  the hands, or brains, of the cultural replicators. Culture and biology co- evolve, only cultural evolution takes place much faster and can happen  within one generation and in Lamarckian (horizontal) as well as Darwinian  (longitudinal) ways. When poets like Mandelstam and Brodsky talk about  the warp speed of their metaphorical thinking they are really talking about  how cultural evolution is happening inside them — they feel like they are  the vessels for their “immortal memes” just as we, a` la Dawkins, are the  mortal shells for our immortal genes.8 I will return to these issues of 6 As Daniel Dennett Dennett, “From Typo to Thinko,”  the meme and memeplex as they cleverly frames it, genetics can, in Stephen C.

Scientists regularly use metaphors to explain their  theories without necessarily acknowledging that the linguistic transfer  at the heart of metaphor (this = that) is poetic in provenance. It is a  knight’s move, as VN might say. When a ID biochemist like Michael Behe  argues for the “irreducible complexity” of the flagellum that appears on  certain bacteria to propel them around, he claims that the 40-different- proteins-selected-in-the-exact-sequence come together to produce a  miniature “outboard motor.”9 His point against hard-core Darwinism is  that the flagellum as it exists is a distinct functional advantage and that  to miss any part of it or to select that part out of sequence would result  in no functional advantage at all — hence how can that flagellum come  into existence gradually, through random selection (i.e. the so-called co- option theory, where one organ or body part can take up an alternate 131. function)? This would seem to be the old argument, now writ small, about Chapter 4 the human eye, which William Paley famously compared to an intricately  designed watch: isn’t it simpler, more logical, to see here the handiwork of  a higher power than the organ’s incremental evolution — what functional  advantage is there to possessing part of an eye? — from a light-sensitive  freckle?10 Behe would counter by saying that he has broken the cell down  to such a submicroscopic level of irreducible complexity that the only  way to understand what is revealed to be inside Darwin’s “black box” is  through the presence of an external agent (or Agent). But whether or not classical Darwinism has a response (it does) is again  at some level irrelevant, because Behe and his colleagues revert to a  metaphor (outboard motor), and a mechanical one at that (since what  is mechanical always seems less “soft,” less “poetic”), to convince the  audience that the flagellum must have been intelligently designed. This  8 Mandelstam gives his And indeed, imagine an airplane nance and part of the flight itself,  version of the speed and “launch- that in full flight designs and and no less a condition of its  ing” quality (its sense of slingshot launches another airplane (disre- poss ibility than the manipulability  reversibility) in the following pas- garding the technical impossibility of the steering unit or the unim- sage from “Conversation about of this).

Rather, the crux of  the issue always comes down to whether the flagellum is “designed” (i.e.  God put it there, which assertion if accepted creates its own real problems  in terms of how to discuss these matters in school curricula) or whether  it randomly “happened,” through vast periods of time we can scarcely  wrap our minds around and through countless genetic false starts and  “homologous” moves that finally resulted in this tiniest of motors. For  the neo-Darwinians the power the ID crowd calls God is a force they see  continually making mistakes, some of which become useful in different  contexts. Functionally advantageous body parts are not always perfectly  ticking watches; they can also be something more ad hoc and tentative,  like Stephen J. Gould’s panda’s thumb — an appendage that works “just  132. well enough” given the circumstances. PART I This debate gets even more interesting, and for us more relevant, if we proceed  deeper into the thickets of the great Darwin-Mendel synthesis of the  1940’s. One of the most powerful theories in the history of evolutionary  study involves another metaphor, Sewall Wright’s notion of “adaptive  landscape.” Although Wright is usually grouped with famed population  geneticists J.B.S. Haldane and Ronald Fisher, his primary area of expertise  was physiological genetics. Focusing less on how the selection of beneficial  genes increases their frequency among large, genetically varied populations  and more on how complex genetic interactions take place within small,  genetically restricted populations, Wright arrived at the idea, in a 1932  paper, that an organic population is best conceived as a landscape with  hills and valleys, the higher points being areas of greater Darwinian  fitness and the lower points or valleys being areas of declining fitness.  Put simply, Haldane’s and Fisher’s sophisticated mathematical models  plotted the paths toward greater fitness in a dominant population in a  given environment. Wright’s special insight, on the other hand, addressed  what happens when smaller populations located along the downslopes  and border areas of fitness “hills” branch out into other groupings and  descend into “valleys” of diminishing viability. In Edward Larson’s telling, Natural selection should drive populations up toward  peaks of fitness... but could not fully account for one species  argument is found on 69–73. 10 See Edward J. Larson, 11 Behe, Darwin’s Black  Frank Sherwin, for example, calls Evolution (New York: The Modern Box, 71. the flagellum a “constant-torque, Library, 2004), 91–92, 207. liquid-cooled, proton-motive  force-powered rotating motor.”  See www.icr.org/article/3465/. </page> <page sequence="7"> The Evolution of Evolution: Genes, Memes, Intelligent Design, and Nabokov branching into many. Branching would require subpopulations  of organisms to travel down from their current peaks of fitness,  across valleys of relative unfitness, and back up other peaks of  fitness — all through a process of incremental genetic variation...  If the subpopulation were small enough and subject to intense  inbreeding (which stimulates genetic interactions and brings out  recessive traits), then selection might not operate to maximize  its adaptive fitness. In his [Wright’s] metaphor, the subpopulation  would move downhill and begin wandering across the valley.  Wright called the phenomenon “genetic drift.”12 Clearly, Wright is not suggesting that something other than natural selection  is drawing these subpopulations into valleys where there is less chance of  future group survival. Nor is he implying that increased inbreeding along  with the production of more recessive traits is in any way purposeful.  Still, what is important here is that it is again a metaphor that is used  to explain the otherwise unexplainable. Presumably no actual hills and  valleys are involved in the selection of genes for greater fitness. 133. It is factors closer to home, however, that make the metaphorical logic at Chapter 4 the center of Wright’s theory possibly pertinent for the Nabokov of the  1930’s. First, it was the Russian geneticist and evolutionary biologist  Theodosius Dobzhansky, who emigrated to America in 1927, that became  enamoured by Wright’s adaptive-landscape metaphor when hearing  him at a genetics congress in 1932 and that, thereafter collaborating  with Wright and developing his ideas further, may be a missing Russian  link underlying aspects of the scientific thinking in Dar and “Father’s  Butterflies.”13 And second, the notions of an “adaptive landscape” and  “genetic drift” sound very reminiscent of, and close in chronological  inception to, the “lawless fantasy” advanced by Konstantin Kirillovich in  “Father’s Butterflies: Second Addendum to Dar” (see below). Dobzhansky’s  first major book, Genetics and the Origins of Species, appeared in 1937,  as VN was completing The Gift but before he wrote “Father’s Butterflies.”  Not only was he one of the major players (the so-called “four horseman”)  in the evolutionary synthesis of the 1940’s, Dobzhansky was a world  leader in refining the concept of “species” through greater taxonomic and  morphological precision — one of VN’s keenest interests once he joined  the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard in the 1940’s. By the  same token, Dobzhansky’s signature stance of foregrounding the vast  genetic diversity within a given species, so that recessive genes and alleles  12 Larson, Evolution, 230. hidden reservoirs of genetic  13 Before emigrating diversity within populations on  from Russia Dobzhansky was which selection can act when  influenced by the great Moscow conditions warrant” (Larson,  geneticist Sergei Chetverikov, Evolution, 232). These ideas seem  pioneer of the principle that also to have played into VN’s  “recessive mutations create thinking. See below. </page> <page sequence="8"> Russian Literature: Background, ForegroPunudsh, kin the Poet, Pushkin the Thinker Reading Russian Writers Reading  Creative Cognition Themselves and Others become significant in their own right in explaining aspects of speciation,  would surely have appealed to the VN opposed to the domination of the  predictably unfit by the predictably fit (“the rough haste of evolution’s  unskilled forces”). Both deeply believing in a Russian Orthodox Christian  worldview and insistent that anti-evolutionary arguments made from a  position of Protestant creationism were wholly unscientific, Dobzhansky  was the sort brilliant, original, seemingly paradoxicalist yet no-nonsense  thinker respected by VN. Indeed, having an intuition that there is a force  “on the outside” guiding our moral impulses (cf. the “to whom it may  concern” of VN’s speculations) yet unwilling to use that intuition to distort  the evidence “from the inside,” Dobzhansky and VN seem epistemological  kindred spirits. That the “other world” worked through the rigorous laws  of evolutionary science in ways that could not be fully parsed was not a  problem for either of them. VN corresponded with Dobzhansky in 1954  (how much previous to that he knew the celebrated scientist’s work we  can only speculate).14 Dobzhansky was nominated for a Nobel Prize in  134. 1975, shortly before his death, but did not receive it. PART I Creative Thinking in VN’s  Version of ID To return now to the citation with which we opened this essay, VN-Fyodor tells  us that some butterflies have “voices,” which is a more anthropomorphic  way of saying that they can communicate by sound. Another butterfly is  “cunning.” The psychological trait belongs to the insect, and regardless  of whether the speaker is being playful or serious or both, it forces us  to think.15 Gathering narrative momentum, VN-Fyodor claims that the  “mimetic disguise” which is a butterfly’s means of protecting itself against  predators possesses “incredible wit,” another attribute of a sophisticated  consciousness. Then he comes to the argument from design, that is,  to the point in the telling where the only logical conclusion, if we take  into account the value added of the design’s potential for conveying  information vis-a`-vis a predator’s possible awareness of the information it  needs to capture its prey, is that the scene “seems to have been invented  [note the seems to have been] by some waggish artist for the intelligent  eyes of man.” Now, an up-to-date expert on evolutionary theory, say a  Stephen J. Gould, would characterize VN’s logic here is as “quaint” and  14 This correspondence 15 Dawkins, on the other is not primarily a poetic/artistic  is cited in Boyd et al., eds., Na- hand, will provocatively call a gene text; in this respect, it never tries  bokov’s Butterflies, 332.

We  don’t have the necessary fossil evidence, Gould would submit, but if we  did, and if we could take into account all the possible mutations over  many millions of years, statistically speaking we would have a better  chance of coming to the “waggish artist’s” version of the butterfly’s wing  than we would by claiming it is the work of a higher intelligence. Simple  systems develop into more complex systems, not the other way around.  At the same time, to repeat, an ID creationist like Behe might assert that  the design was put there by God (which is indeed one way of reading VN’s  logic) and that getting to this point, so seemingly pregnant with meaning  to our eyes, through a process of random selection is perversely “secular.” I suspect something else is going on here that falls between Gould and Behe.  The space for creative thinking that VN was carving our for himself over  his entire life depended neither on a narrowly Christian God nor on a 135. strictly Darwinian gradualist evolutionary trajectory. The metaphysical Chapter 4 speculation in “Father’s Butterflies” about “spherical speciation” (Kon- stantin Godunov-Cherdyntsev’s “daring” theory — see below) need not  be correct in a probative scientific sense for it to be correct in a creative  one. What do I mean here? I do not mean that VN was ever in favor of  sloppy thinking. This we know. He famously preferred the bottom-up  approach to cognizing when it came to making formulations about what is  “real” in reality, as he says in Strong Opinions: “As an artist and a scholar  I prefer the specific detail to the generalization, images to ideas, obscure  facts to clear symbols, and the discovered wild fruit to the synthetic  jam.”16 Be that as it may, it does not follow that VN’s vaunted ability  to observe precisely was itself flawless: witness the cases, reversed by  subsequent lepidopterists, where his overly refined categorizing fervor  split subspecies of “Blues” into incorrect new species. Brian Boyd, who  knows more about how VN thought in time and about time than anyone,  writes in his Introduction to Nabokov’s Butterflies that “It seems likely  that, had [Nabokov] begun serious work on mimicry, he would have  found sufficient evidence of purely physical explanations to be forced  to abandon his dearly held metaphysical speculations.”17 What I believe,  however, is that the “purely physical explanations” we have at our disposal  now would have caused VN to revise, to think further, but not necesaarily  and writing in “Postmodernism 17 Brian Boyd, “Nabokov,  Disrobed,” A Devil’s Chaplain, Literature, Lepidoptera,” in Na- 55–62. bokov’s Butterflies, ed.

Sometimes mistakes can be creative — the happy, chance  “mutations” that push cognition further. On a scientific level, what would a non-gradualist, non-Christian creationist  evolutionary development look like? And second, what relationship would  this sort of development have to the artistic structure (the “memeplex”)  of a work like The Gift? As Victoria Alexander has recently argued, VN’s  core interest as a scientist was more in the laws of biological form that  explain a species’ drive for symmetry than in naming the “intellig ence” (or  random lack thereof) that put that drive there in the first place. (In gene- ral, if it could be put this way, VN was more concerned in seeing the  “form” of life through its “content” rather than the other way around.)  As an aside, today’s scientists can identify the chemical make-up of the  genes (the serotonin transporter [SLC6A4] and the arginine vasopressin  receptor 1a [AVPR1a]) that appear more often among dancers, and we  know in the distant past dance was one of the first forms of “culture”  136. and that, through analogy with the animal world this activity was linked  PART I to mating ritual.18 However, to say that today’s “memetic” transmission  of dance somehow plays a signficant role in reproductive viability is  a long stretch indeed, just as linking any truly sophisticated cultural  production, in a classic Freudian manner, primarily with an individual’s  childhood traumas involving biological parents, is cripplingly reductionist.  Among the forms that most intrigued VN were the ones he called “non- utilitarian” — again, think of the dewdrop marking on the Blue’s wing —  which as we know is another way of saying “artistic,” or, in terms of  The Gift, “non-Chernyshevskian.” Furthermore, it was the “reverse cause”  situations, where the function of something is understood after the fact  of its appearance, and where that appearance could not be predicted  beforehand, that most fired his imagination. Thinking about “purpose”  from all sides even if there is no purpose is a mind-expanding exercise.  (This, as I will explain, also had important ramifications for VN’s work as a  creative writer.) Thus, according to Alexander, VN was in the “phylogenetic”  company of nineteenth-century Kantian teleomechanists (those studying  how parts shaped wholes) that then morphed into twentieth-century  scientists, among them D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson, Alan Turing, Brian  Goodwin and lepidopterist Frederik Nijhout, who investigated “the laws  of biological form and pattern formation” and who “offered alternatives  to an exclusively adaptationist evolutionary program.”19 For our purposes,  18 See www.plosgenetics.

These are those knight moves (“nature’s rhymes”) that so  appealed to Nabokov the artist. Among them we might find the following:  1) changes that are nonutilitarian within a genus (i.e. viceroys and  monarchs that have come to share formal characteristics supposedly  through a “convergence” — so-called Batesian mimicry — that confers  adaptive advantage to the copying viceroy because it looks like the bitter- tasting monarch, except in this instance both the monarch and the viceroy  are unpalatable to predators); 2) changes in gene sequences that could  have arisen suddenly, through environmental factors such as heat shock  (i.e. the similarity between a dead-leaf and a certain butterfly “phenocopy,”  where the lookalike remains a member of its original species and carries 137. the genotype of its parents); and 3) changes that possess a resemblance Chapter 4 across phyla but also serve no apparent purpose (i.e. the hummingbird  and the hummingbird moth do not need, in a Darwinian sense, to look  alike to promote reproductive viability or to avoid predators).21 VN’s best  example of a Darwinian natural selection process that does not take  place when we expect it to and that eventuates still in survival is the  caterpillar of the Siberian Owlet moth that is found on the chumara plant,  only the coloring of the insect’s fetlocks and dorsal shape appears at  the end of summer while the shrub blooms in May. Following the logic of  adaptation, “nature [has] defraud[ed] one of the parties.”22 Thus, “natural  selection alone could not,” summarizes Alexander, “create a mimetic form  by gradual fine-tuning. The form would have to appear suddenly as a  definite resemblance since a non-resemblance that was an earlier stage  for the resemblance would not be selected because of what it would  eventually resemble.”23 Whether demonstrating how heat shock can affect  genetic selection and hence pattern design even within one generation, or  establishing a nymphalid “ground plan” that operates as a kind of Platonic  starting point for controlling the stochastic process of pigment diffusion  across a wing surface,24 it seems there is sufficient scientific evidence to  suggest that the nature/nurture, “blind watchmaker”/“waggish artist”  debate is not yet dead.

It simply means that for  some a purposefulness cannot be fully ruled out. In the second half of this essay I would like to speculate on some of the ways  VN’s artistic strategies in The Gift might mimic his scientific writing and  stimulate creative cognition. First, there is Fyodor’s connection to Pushkin  through his father and through his own study and contemplation of the  poet.25 “Pushkin entered his blood. With Pushkin’s voice merged the voice  of his father.”26 All three examples of unique individual are aligned through  the notions of poetry, love, mortality, and chance. These three figures are  linked through different “bloodlines” — one hereditary (genetic), the other  cultural (memetic) — but Fyodor is the living example — the phenotype as it  were — attesting to each bloodline’s reality. The “Godunov” in the double  surname could be attributed to the family’s place in Russian history, but  it could also hark back to Pushkin’s play about dynastic succession and  impostorship — a more likely scenario given the context. (Indeed, by  138. analogy to earlier aristocratic families, like the Musin-Pushkins, VN has  PART I placed his hero in a genealogical force field between Pushkin on the one  hand [Godunov], and the non-poetic Chernyshevsky [Cherdyntsev], on  the other.) What Fyodor’s father calls “nature’s rhymes” and what Fyodor  himself is searching for when he comes down with rhyming fever early in  the book belong to a common weave.  Let me stop here for a moment to insert Dawkins’s central metaphor for how  one’s genes together with one’s responses to environmental pressures  work together to create meaning, or at least the next move in a life one  is trying to make meaningful: Think of the body as a blanket, suspended from the ceiling  by 100,000 rubber bands, all tangled and twisted around one  another. The shape of the blanket — the body — is determined by  the tensions of all these rubber bands taken together. Some of  the rubber bands represent genes, others environmental factors.  A change in a particular gene corresponds to a lengthening or  shortening of one particular rubber band. But any one rubber  band is linked to the blanket only indirectly via countless con- nections amid a welter of other rubber bands. If you cut one  rubber band, or tighten it, there will be a distributed shift in  tensions, and the effect on the shape of the blanket will be  complex and hard to predict.27 25 On the Pushkin- 140–58, and Maria Malikova, 26 Nabokov, The Gift, 4.

But what is missing  are precisely the “memes.” One’s responses to environmental factors  are, the more our species develops cognitively and linguistically, bound  to translate into memes, those replicatable cultural patterns that we  use to push farther and farther out not only into the space of the outer  world but into, whether it is “virtual” or not, the inner space of the  mind. Note that Dawkins stays on this side of the scientific divide by  leaving the organization of environmental factors as something given,  not developed further in his metaphorical logic. VN, and other “poets”  and poetic thinkers, would take the metaphorical logic further. For VN,  the blanket hanging from the 100,000 genetic and environmental rubber  bands becomes a magic carpet that he propels backwards (memory)  and forwards (imagination) to time- and space-travel in his “more real”  virtual world. What facilitates (causes?) this sensation of being in many  places and times at once is the metaphorical fabric of the language.  Dawkins’s metaphor must go only in one direction — it needs to preserve 139. the semblance of Popperian falsifiability; VN’s metaphor goes in multiple Chapter 4 directions simultaneously — it only has to prove itself to itself. And if it  proves itself to itself with sufficient success there is a good chance it will  find itself in someone else’s brain, via memetic “virus.”28 To return to VN’s text, the very structure of The Gift, with its blurring in  and out of the “I” and “he” narrators and its tying-up of the plot by an  Onegin stanza, itself a pseudo-genetic map for creating infinite meanings  out of a single string (rhyme scheme), challenges us to understand it  as “open” or “closed.” Is this structure an optical illusion a` la Escher, a  Moebius strip modeling space as “outside” and “inside” at the same  time (memetics)?29 Or is it, through some ancient deep-seated psychic  trace, the visual reproduction of that double helix of chemically paired  on-off switches whose codes and mappings cannot transcend themselves  (genetics)? Or is it some time-in-a-bottle encapsulation of the two? Do  the spirals and spheres that imbed themselves in VN’s speculations  about sudden bursts of creativity trace back to Bely and the Symbolists’  notions of revolutionary time, to Bergson’s cloud of “creative evolution,”  or are these natural archetypes whose function in thought is akin to the  “nymphalid ground plan” as starting point in wing design?30 Pushing the  analogy further, are rhyme words the memetic equivalent of genes, are  their endings, which may not be meaningful in their own right, but which  29 The Moebius strip ty 6–7 (1981): 378.

This is where Dawkins, Dennett,  Blackmore et al., despite the great attraction of memetics, cannot do  justice to a complex cultural artifact as the latter is presently undertood  in the scientific literature. A religion or a political ideology, with their  various ideas, rituals, and cultural inculcation processes, create memes  and memeplexes that as a rule do not generate new information, do not  spur cognitive discovery. They are learned, repeated, personalized. What  they do is compactly replicate tradition as something closed and provide  strategies (coping mechanisms) for surviving in a given environment. VN’s  kind of writing (which is actually inaccurate to call it a “kind” because it  is a class unto itself) provides coping mechanisms (although “coping” is  a timid word for what it engenders) for surviving on the planet in general,  if not beyond. Fyodor says of his father’s prose, which he gets closer to  by reading Pushkin, “the very body, flow, and structure of the whole work  [i.e. Butterflies and Moths of the Russian Empire] touches me in the  140. professional sense of a craft handed down. I suddenly recognize in my  PART I father’s words the wellsprings of my own prose: squeamishness toward  fudging and smudging [note Jakobson’s poetic function], the reciprocal  dovetailing of word and thought... and I doubt that the development of  these traits under my frequently willful pen was a conscious act.”31 The  process is presented as virtually physiological. Indeed, it may turn out  some day in the not too distant future that the “body, flow, and structure”  of a cultural construct are not simply figures of speech. As animal be- haviorist N.K. Humphrey puts it, Memes should be regarded as living structures, not just  metaphorically but technically. When you plant a fertile meme  in my mind you literally parasitize my brain, turning it into  a vehicle for the meme’s propagation in just the way a virus  may parasitize the genetic mechanism of a host cell. And this  isn’t just a way of talking — the meme, say, for “belief in life  after death” is actually realized physically, millions of times  over, as a structure in the nervous systems of individual men  the world over.32 In “Father’s Butterflies” we learn that Fyodor is fascinated by the exceptional  flora and fauna of Russia that gets left out of popular German editions of  butterfly atlases. The fact that Konstantin Kirillovich fills this lacuna with  The Butterflies and Moths of the Russian Empire, itself a fiction, is VN’s  31 Boyd et al., eds.,  Nabokov’s Butterflies, 210. 32 Cited in Dawkins, The  Selfish Gene, 192. </page> <page sequence="15"> The Evolution of Evolution: Genes, Memes, Intelligent Design, and Nabokov way of saying that the dumbing-down of history that was the Soviet regime  and the tragedy that was the death of Fyodor’s father (and VN’s father) is  undone by the life’s work that lives on. “The bitterness of interrupted life  is nothing compared to the bitterness of interrupted work: the probability  that the former may continue beyond the grave seems infinite when com- pared to the inexorable incompletion of the latter.”33 The future is secretly  embedded in one’s work: that is why the latter is so crucial and that is  what memetic time-travel in its most developed forms can feel like. There  is, Sukhoshchokov tells us, “something seductive” in Pushkin’s “fatal des- tiny”; he has a “special reckoning with fate”; his poetry is born out of his  “tragic thought about the future”; “the triple formula of human existence —  irrevocability, unrealizability, inevitability [again, the poetic function] —  was well known to him”; “one could not find any other poet who peered  so often — now in jest, now superstitiously, or with inspired seriousness —  into the future.”34 VN is implying here, in a medium (novelistic prose) that  permits it, that Pushkin’s art is not only about how consciousness imagines  the future, but how such a consciousness also is the future, and that 141. this special knowledge comes from the fact that the poet’s life is always Chapter 4 already fatally marked. The death sentence (think of Pushkin’s fears about  marriage, his earlier challenges to cuckolded husbands in The Gabrieliade  [Gavriiliada], etc.) unleashes poetic thinking — the most obvious example  of this being the condemned Andre ́ Che ́nier who calls forth both Pushkin in  his great poem but also Cincinnatus in VN’s novel.35 Similarly, Konstantin  Kirillovich, presumably sensing that he is marked in a way that his hero is,  has a “secret” and a special “solitude”; he “go[es] off on his journeys not  so much to seek something as to flee something, and... on returning, he  realiz[es] that it [is] still with him, inside him, unriddable, inexhaustible.”36  Fyodor’s father senses powerfully he is going to die prematurely, and the  seemingly foreordained ways his life intersects his work and his work his  life seems to prove this. Not for nothing does Fyodor imagine his father  walking in and out of a rainbow and Pushkin seeing Othello (his signature  Shakespeare play) at sixty; only art could create these other lives, with  alternative futures, since life in history too often rules otherwise. So much of what we have been discussing thus far relates to the idea of  randomness, happenstance, and how one interprests the latter. In Russian,  sluchai (chance, accident) and sluchainost’ (randomness) can replicate  themselves as coincidence or providential design through memetic, if not  genetic, patterning. Here too Nabokov took his cue from Pushkin, who  33 Ibid., 234. 1995), 488; and A. Dolinin, 36 Nabokov, The Gift, 109. 34 Nabokov, The Gift, 95. “Pushkinskie podteksty v romane  35 See Sergej Davydov, ‘Priglashenie na kazn’,” Instinnaia  “Nabokov and Pushkin” in zhizn’ pisatelia Nabokova (St.  Vladimir Alexanrov, ed., The Petersburg: Akademicheskii  Garland Companion to Vladimir proekt, 2004), 214–30. Nabokov (New York: Garland,  </page> <page sequence="16"> Russian Literature: Background, ForegroPunudsh, kin the Poet, Pushkin the Thinker Reading Russian Writers Reading  Creative Cognition Themselves and Others was obsessed with the relationship between fate and chance in the last  decade of his life. The hareskin coat that sets a “miraculous” sequence  of events in motion in Pushkin’s novel (and that Fyodor’s mother wears  as she goes to look for her husband on one of his expeditions37) can just  as easily be a negative, fatal coincidence in Pushkin’s history (History  of Pugachev): for example, the cannon that Major Kharlov fires to raise  the morale of his troops at Nizhne-Ozernaia Fortress scares off the allied  troops coming to the rescue and allows Pugachev and his band to take  the fort easily and continue to spread death and mayhem.38 Pushkin  sees sluchai as the single most defining trait of a Russian history which  is otherwise misunderstood or ignored (much like the flora and fauna of  the Russian Empire that Konstantin Kirillovich undertook to rescue in  his lepidopterological studies). As Pushkin writes in his second review  of Polevoy’s History of the Russian People (Istoriia russkogo naroda) in  one of those prose passages Fyodor’s tuning fork (kamerton) responds  to in order to capture perfect pitch: 142. Guizot has explained one of the events of Christian his- PART I tory: the European Enlightenment. He discovers its embryo,  describes its gradual development and, removing all that is  separate, all that is extraneous, random, he delivers it to us  through the dark, bloody, rebellious, and, finally, enlightening  centuries. You [Polevoy] have understood the great merit of the  French historian. But remember this as well: Russia has never  had anything in common with the rest of Europe; her history  requires a different [type of] thought, a different formula from  those drawn out by Guizot from the history of the Christian West.  Don’t say “It could not be otherwise.” If that were so, then an  historian would be an astronomer and the events in the life of  humankind would be predicted in calendars, like solar eclipses.  But providence is not algebra. The human mind, according to  popular expression, is not a prophet, but a guesser; it sees the  37 Nabokov, The Gift, раллели к теме судьбоносного  100.

One of the shrewdest men of the eighteenth century predicted  the Chamber of French De puties and the potent rise of Russia,  but no one predicted Napoleon or Polignac.39 VN plays constantly with the interweaving notions of chance, coincidence,  and providence in The Gift. Konstantin Kirillovich’s favorite line from  Pushkin is “Tut Apollon ideal, tam Neobeia — pechal” (Here is Apollo —  ideal, there is Niobe — sadness),” which comes from one of the poems  (“To the Artist” [“K hudozhniku”]) Pushkin wrote during the last year of  his life, when he sensed more than ever that his fate was now upon him,  and which is filled with a mood of “happy sadness” and “sad happiness”:  “Grusten i vesel vkhozhu” (Melancholy and merry I enter) and “Veselo  mne... Grusten guliaiu” (I feel jaunty... Sad I stroll).40 The poet is pleased  to walk among the sculptor B.I. Orlovsky’s beautiful statues but he misses  his friend Del’vig, who helped him get started on his life-long quest to, 143. a` la Pygmalion, bring verbal statues to life. Now, in Konstantin Kirillovich’s Chapter 4 mind, and in Fyodor’s experience of the butterfly hunt, the cultural nexus  of Pushkin’s original words (statues, Greek myths) morphs into the  naturalist nexus of the precisely observed “russet wing and mother-of- pearl of a Niobe fritillary” and “the small black Apollo.”41 Art and science  come alive as cognitive extensions of each other. Quoting Pushkin, but also rephrasing him, prodding his words onto another  level of awareness, Konstantin Kirillovich says to an unidentified in- terlocutor in the closing lines of “Father’s Butterflies,” “Yes, of course  it was in vain that he [Pushkin] said ‘by chance’ [sluchainyi], and by  chance that he said ‘in vain’ [naprasnyi].”42 The poem alluded to here  (Gift futile, gift random [Dar naprasnyi, dar sluchainyi]), composed on  the poet’s birthday (May 26, 1828), was one of the saddest, most self- lacerating confessions in Pushkin’s fully and fiercely lived creative life.  39 A.S.

Konstantin  Kirillovich’s words trail off right at the moment when he is about to tell  the interlocutor how his unparalleled knowledge of the plant and animal  world dovetails with the “clergy’s” (Metropolitan Filaret’s) response to the  poet’s cri de coeur, this also a poem, but now in the form of an affirmation  of the gift, when “Gift futile, gift random” first appeared in print in 1830.  “The awaited final stress [udare ́niia] did not come,” the son says of the  father’s utterance. This beat is the second element in the rhyme pair for  which we are always searching. Indeed, as Alexander Dolinin has pointed  out, the dar in the Russian word for “stress” is precisely where the beat  does not fall.43 And yet the second shoe does drop for VN, as it had  for his precursors, in the last words of “Father’s Butterflies”: “and now  144. I have suddenly remembered the title of the book.”44 The title of the book  PART I remains nameless, for it is Fyodor’s (or rather VN’s) business. This book,  which is “difficult and strange” and whose “pages [seem] out of order,”  is Fyodor’s companion as he thinks back to a world where his mother  and father are still in the picture and he is growing as a conscious entity.  My guess is this tome, the rhyme partner for which Fyodor has always  and will always be waiting, is the book of life:45 How is it conceivable, in fact, that amid the huge jumble  containing the embryos of countless organs (of which up to  forty-three are currently represented), the magnificent chaos  of nature never included thought? One can doubt the ability  of a genius to animate marble, but one cannot doubt that one  afflicted by idiocy will never create a Galatea [NB. the Pygmalion  theme]. Human intelligence, with all its limitations and rights,  inasmuch as it is a gift of nature, and a perpetually repeated  43 A.

It may,  in that dark storehouse, differ from the species in sunlight as a  marble god is distinct from the convolutions of the sculptor’s  brain — but still it exists.46 Final Thoughts Biological evolution works by trial and error. Cultural evolution seems to as  well. The difference is that there is a feedback system in cultural evolution,  and what we may call a “memotype,” which by analogy to the phenotype  is all the cultural patterns and meaning-generating structures collected  in an individual at a given moment, can do a lot of “evolving” even in  one lifetime. We are the mortal carriers of potentially immortal memes  and memeplexes, but it is by no means simple replication that we do  when we try to combine rigorous scientific logic (and evidence) with a  linguistically sensitive, “poetic” logic that sees and experiences various 145. levels of cognition simultaneously, all the while remaining open, rather Chapter 4 than closed, to the lure of new information. Let us close this discussion  with some final speculation about where VN was going with “Father’s  Butterflies” and how the “mistakes” he made in his thinking there turn  out to be “true” in a way that is, memetically speaking, useful for our  survival, broadly defined. The issue comes down to the strikingly close  metaphorical parallels between the Wright-Dobzhansky concepts of  “adaptive landscape” and “genetic drift” and Godunov-Cherdyntsev pe`re’s  theory of speciation (what biologists now refer to as “species concept”).  First VN’s text, which I have to quote at length because its “weave” is too  dense to disentangle otherwise: By “species” he [Konstantin Kirillovich Godunov-Cher- dyntsev] intends the original of a being, nonexistent in our  reality but unique and definite in concept, that recurs ad  infinitum in the mirror of nature, creating countless reflections;  each one of them perceived by our intelligence, reflected in the  selfsame glass and acquiring its reality solely within it, as a  living individual of the given species. An aberration, or chance  deviations are but the consequence of less “faithful” areas of  the mirror, while the recurrent falling of a reflection on one  and the same flaw may yield a stable local race, the idea of  46 Boyd et al., eds.  Nabokov’s Butteflies, 219. </page> <page sequence="20"> Russian Literature: Background, ForegroPunudsh, kin the Poet, Pushkin the Thinker Reading Russian Writers Reading  Creative Cognition Themselves and Others which tends toward the periphery of the circle, the center of  which, in turn, is the idea of species. These races remain on  the circumference of the species insofar as the spatial link (i.e.,  one with a locus on earth at a given point in time) between  the type (i.e., the most precise sample at a given moment) and  a local variant is supported by intermediate variations (that  can manifest themselves as local races or chance deviations),  in other words, so far as the species circle remains unbroken.47 What is fascinating about this passage (and those immediately following for  several pages) is that we are witnessing the mind of genius who is trying  to get to the future via metaphor but does not yet have the scientific  knowledge and terminology to put that future into words. He is feeling his  way toward the “hills” of fitness and the “valleys” of unfitness that Wright  first brought to the world’s attention as genetic landscape. Obviously  his initial stab at defining species has problems, as the “original of a  being, nonexistent in reality” sounds too much like a Platonic idea. But  146. what he is trying to express, presumably, is something like the nymphalid  PART I “ground plan” cited earlier. On the other hand, he seems to get some  important things right: those individuals with traits that mutated (“chance  deviations”) tend to migrate to the periphery of the circle (Wright would  say they “drift” into “valleys”). And the “spatial link” joining peripheral  members to the “original” in the cent er (i.e. the members closest to the  ideal for VN, but simply more “fit” for Wright) through “intermediate  variations” is also not that far off. The “mirror of nature” with its “countless  reflections” sounds like some Naturphilosophie hocus-pocus, but here too  we can give the author a partial passing grade because he is trying to come  up with a more vivid, less pedestrian sounding version of “replicate.” The  main impasse arises, however, from the very meaning of species. Species  can be defined typologically (taxonomically) and biologically, but trying  to define the term by using both methods at once is verbally impossible,  something like trying to write at the speed of light, or seeing waves and  particles at the same time. Evolutionary biologists have split many hairs  trying to ascertain precisely, in terms of an individual’s phenotypic traits,  where one species crosses the line into another. But if they forget the  naming and focus on which groups can interbreed with one another  they have a good pragmatic way to move forward. In the above passage  VN, then, is attempting to use what he knows, his own temporally and  spatially confined “memotype,” to come up with something similar to  47 Boyd et al., eds.,  Nabokov’s Butterflies, 216. </page> <page sequence="21"> The Evolution of Evolution: Genes, Memes, Intelligent Design, and Nabokov “adaptive landscape” and “genetic drift.” Whether he knew Wright’s and  Dobzhansky’s work is a tantalizing fact for us scholars, yet ultimately it  is beside the point. The main message of the passage, its “meta-memetic”  gist if you will, is that VN’s metaphors, at this point in spring 1939, are too  precious, too skeletal, to get as close as he needs to sense that some new  rung in the (genetic-memetic) evolutionary ladder has slipped in place and  he is ready to climb further. Here we might say that metaphorical thinking,  if it tries to leap forward without sufficient experiential and probative  ballast, ends up being ambiguous without being necessarily meaningful. In exactly the same way, the repetition of individual  reflections in time (limited by the span during which a given  species conserves its basic identity) may, if the process lasts  long enough, generate certain modifications that, however, are  just unachored spatial variations, with which they may even  coincide if we have come upon the species in its ideal period, i.e.,  at the moment of full harmony among its radial components.48 This is not the VN we know and love. Abstract, clanky and sprawling, these 147. words as memetic replicators come painfully close to the postmodernist Chapter 4 mumbo-jumbo scientists like Dawkins and Alan Sokal make fun of. Cultural  evolution also works by trial and error. The final point is: to what extent are we programmed by our memes the way we  are programmed by our genes? What does Dawkins’s provocative sentence  “We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of selfish replicators”  mean? It really means what it always has: genetics determines chemically  aspects of our makeup, but those 100,000 rubber bands holding up the  blanket that is “me” and twisted around each other in myriad ways are  made not only of genetic material and “environmental factors.”49 Those  environmental factors contain our acquired learning, which itself contains  the “neuronal wiring up” of our memes and memeplexes. Those memes  can act on us and through us when we reflexively buy what others have  (simple replication), or watch a repeat on tv rather than read a new book  (also simple replication), or use religious or political ideology to advance  our version of reality, usually at the expense, sometimes lethal expense,  of rival populations (simple replication yet again). Looked at this way,  memetic replication could easily eventuate in the extinction of Homo  sapiens, only in this instance we, and not a natural catastrophe, will  have made ourselves dinosaurs. But what the best of VN’s thinking in  something like The Gift encourages us to do is add productive (literally  48 Ibid., 216–17. 49 Dawkins, The Selfish  Gene, 125. </page> <page sequence="22"> Russian Literature: Background, ForegroPunudsh, kin the Poet, Pushkin the Thinker Reading Russian Writers Reading  Creative Cognition Themselves and Others mind-expanding) change to replication, to try to see as much of the  world as we can in all its vertical and horizontal, scientific and poetic,  dimensions. Statues are butterflies, poets are lepidopterists.  Brilliant evolutionary biologists like Gould tell us that evolution is horizontal  not vertical: humans are not “at the top” of the evolutionary ladder, but  merely one species on one of the branches of the Darwinian tree that  grows sideways. Likewise, some species can evolve into simpler, not more  complex, forms (parasites). We may have superior symbolizing power (and  larger brains) than the apes, but we do not exist separate from them in  an evolutionary sense; we sit on contiguous branches — we ourselves  are just another version of ape. This is not reason to despair, however.  Quite the opposite in fact. In the nineteenth century philosophers of  a certain type (Vladimir Solovyov is the most vivid example) tried to  imagine what love, and more broadly, creative behavior, would be like  without biology, without procreation. Obviously there is a quixotic element  to such thinking that would elicit nothing but laughs from a sceptical,  148. empirically driven, western educated twenty-first century audience. Yet  PART I perhaps what Solovyov was about was hurrying on cultural evolution (he  of course wouldn’t call it that), trying to see if the energy that goes into  biological mating and the preservation of kith and kin could be somehow  channeled into an expansion of mind and spirit. Most people today don’t  care to imagine how to live without biology. But is there a higher form  of (pro)creation, and if there is what would it look like scientifically? Just  as important, would it help our species to think there is, or think there  could be? Is evolution truly the tyranny of the selfish replicator, genetic  and memetic, or could it be a continual remaking and retesting of the  rubber bands (again, replication plus change, i.e. one’s own memotypical  input): not that from which we only hang, as blankets, but that with the  help of which we fly, metaphorically speaking, through time and space,  through biology and culture, on a magic carpet of words, mind, and desire?  </page> </plain_text>
