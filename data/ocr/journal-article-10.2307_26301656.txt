<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Interpretation of the Symbolism of Medusa by Arthur A. Miller, M.D. The symbolism of the Medusa head and some aspects of the mythology related to it have engaged the interest of psychoanalytic writers (Ferenczi3, Freud5&gt;6, Flugel4, Jones,9 Coriat2 and Reik10). The features dealt with in this literature have been the appearance of the head - a horrible face with writhing snakes instead of hair - and the fact that if one looks directly at it he is turned to stone. The trend of inter pretation related to these features has been concerned with the castration complex and polyphallic symbolism. Regarding the castration complex the particular aspect dealt with has been the absence of the penis in the female and the psycho logical consequences deriving from this fact Although in the literature there are slight variation from this general theme, the interpretations of the Medusa symbolism are in the main connected with this facet of psycho-sexuality. In the course of therapy with a 23 year old single woman who had been in treatment slightly over two years for an anxiety hysteria of moderate severity, there appeared dream material and associations bearing on the Medusa head and features of the related mythology. This material did not ap pear to be directly concerned, in the context in which it ap peared, with the castration complex and polyphallic symbol ism. The material which presented itself seemed more to focus on the theme of competition between women. This stimulated a survey of the pertinent psychoanalytic literature and the related mythology. The mythology in regards to the</page><page sequence="2">390 Arthur A. Miller, M.D. origin of Medusa proved to be of considerable interest, par ticularly in view of its apparent relationship to the presenting clinical material. It suggested an interpretation of the signifi cance of Medusa which might be considered as being supple mentary to the interpretation previously delineated in the psychoanalytic literature. To demonstrate this particular facet of the interpretation of the significance of this element of mythology, this paper will deal with 1) a survey of the related psychoanalytic literature, 2) presentation of the clini cal material, and 3) a discussion of the significant features of mythology. In 1923, Ferenczi (3) published a brief note, "On the Symbolism of the Head of Medusa." According to his inter pretation, the head of Medusa is the terrible symbol of the female genital region, displaced from below upwards; the serpents which surround the head - by representation by the opposite - signify die absence of die penis ; the fear aroused by it is the frightful impression made on the child by the penis-less (castrated) genital; and the fearful and alarming starting eyes of die Medusa head have the secondary meaning of erection. In his paper, "The Infantile Genital Organization of the Libido," Freud (5) pointed out that depreciation and loath ing of the woman derive from a final conviction of woman's lack of a penis. He stated his agreement with Ferenczi's tracing back the "mythological symbol of loathing - the head of the Medusa - to the impression made by the female genitalia devoid of a penis." He added that it is the genital of the mother that is represented and that in the myth by wearing the head of Medusa on her shield Athena becomes unapproachable, the woman at the sight of whom all sexual desire is stifled. Freud (6) wrote a paper specifically devoted to the symbolism of the head of Medusa1. He expressed the idea 1. This was written a year before the publication of the above cited reference but was published posthumously in 1940. This brief paper is considered to be a sketch for a more extensive work.</page><page sequence="3">An Interpretation 391 that the terror of Medusa is a terror of castration that is linked to the sight of something - such a terror as is expe rienced by the little boy who had hitherto not believed in the threat of castration and then sees the female genitalia. The snakes on the head, he states, though frightening, serve to mitigate the horror by replacing the penis. The fact that the sight of the head of Medusa causes the beholder to be come stiff with terror and turn to stone offers consolation - that he still possesses a penis - that is, the stiffening means an erection. Flugel, (4) in a paper on polyphallic symbolism and the castration complex, refers to the connection between the Medusa head (a polyphallic symbol because of its snaky locks instead of hair) and the castration complex - that is, that aspect of the castration complex related to the absence of the penis in the female. He agrees with Ferenczi's inter pretation. In addition he views the polyphallic symbolism of the snaky locks as a compensation or corrective for the fear of castration, as negation of the absence of the penis, by representation through the opposite. Another function of polyphallic symbolism such as in the Medusa head is that it inspires disgust of the object (the female exhibiting the polyphallic symbolism), the object being a projection of the sexual desires of a man in whom these desires are inhibited. Jones (9) states that, according to a later representation of Medusa (in Aristophanes), this figure represents a con densation of phallic and fecal fertilizing elements. Coriat (2) reports a patient's fantasy related to the mytho logical idea that one turns to stone at the sight of the head of Medusa. He interprets this in his patient "not as usually assumed, a reinforcement of masculinity - but a form of punishment for the forbidden incest wish arising from the intensity of the Oedipus complex." In addition to psycho analytic writers, he cites Richard Paine Knight, a writer on Greek mythology, who refers to the head of Medusa as being symbolic of the female generative or reproductive power having double significance of destruction and repro duction.</page><page sequence="4">392 Arthur A. Miller, M.D. A patient of Reik (10) presented dream material analo gous to the mythological Medusa. The interpretation of the dream revealed a modern counterpart of the Medusa. This modern variation of the mythological form of the Gorgon's head represented this young male patient's castration fears. Reik remarks that we conceive of myths as of dreams of the masses, collective productions of the people in which their unconscious wishes or fears are expressed. This patient's dream's latent material is drawn from the same source which produced the myth of the terrible head of the Gorgon. In a paper on the symbolism of the octopus, Schnier (13) compares the octopus with the Medusa head. He sug gests that the octopus provided the first prototype or in spiration for the creation of the figure of the Medusa head. He interprets the meaning of the octopus symbol as being a defense against the fear of castration, a defense for guilt feelings originating in powerful oral impulses, and, for women, a means for resolving in fantasy the resentment arising from the lack of a penis. The clinical material cited in the above papers refers to male patients, except one case cited by Flugel. The present p√¢tient is a female. The Medusa symbol might have a vary ing significance, depending on the sex of the individual. Early in the third year of therapy this patient presented the following dream : I was here in the office. Everything was gray. I was lying all curled up like a fetus. Before introducing the dream she remarked that she had some conflict about going back to work at the place where her former roommate was going to work. She recently had become increasingly aware of her competition with this wom an. She associated to the dream : Everything was gray. This brings to mind the three gray ladies in mythology. I think everything appeared gray to them. Perseus went to them to get the one eye they had between them to help him to defeat the Gorgon. I remember reading about this in the Tanglewood Tales. Everything appeared gray to them. The Gorgons. There was a head of a woman with snakes on it.</page><page sequence="5">An Interpretation 393 If you looked at it you turned to stone. There were three of them. Medusa was one. Snaky locks. Maybe because I didn't wash my hair. The three Gorgons make me think of mother, my aunt, and myself. It is a strange fantasy that if people look at you they will tum to stone. When I think of someone who is particularly dangerous to everyone around her I think of my mother. The context in which this hour and dream occurred seems important for clarification of its significance. The patient had quit two jobs in the past year when she was on the verge of being promoted to a more responsible capacity because of her excellent work. Also, at each of these places, a man was beginning to show some interest in her. Not having lived at home for 5 years, she had moved home with her mother several months before. Much work had been done in the therapy in relation to her regressive defensive position of infantile submissiveness to other women in avoidance of competitive strivings with these women. During the past two months the therapy dealt not only with her re gressive defensive position but also, more directly, with com petitive strivings. For instance, she recalled memories of a struggle with her mother about whether or not the patient was to wear lipstick during her teens, at a time when she was attracted to a male cousin. She also became aware of being pleased that a recent roommate had broken with her boy friend. She realized that this rivalry about the boy friend, who subsequendy showed interest in the patient, played a part in the patient's retreat in moving home with her parents. She had become active in a church youth group, where, be cause of her being one or two years older than the other girls and because of her professional training, she was in a re spected position. Here she recently had met a young man, considered the desirable man in the group, and there was a mutual attraction between them. In the transference, there was a struggle between her erotic longings and regressive defenses against them, that is of being the controlled child of a woman. There were associations to competition with other girls in grade school as well as associations to her</page><page sequence="6">394 Arthur A. Miller, M.D. father's kindness and attention to her. It is to be noted that up to this point in the treatment, the father remained a more or less nebulous figure, he patient presenting him as an object of indifference, in contrast with the more current expression of her fondness for and attraction to her father. In the hour preceding that in which the dream appeared, she was quite pleased in reporting that her aunt and mother asked her about things related to her work. They listened to her, not as a favorite child reciting, but as someone who knows something. Her mother had been talking to her about the patient's eventually marrying and having children. She let the patient work in the garden, whereas she had always reserved this as her own right. During this hour she was ' ' up set as well as pleased" at the prospect of growing up. In the hour following the dream, she . mentioned the current novel Bonjour Tristesse (12) and to this she associated that in the story an 18 year old girl manipulates her father and the woman with whom he was involved, causing the woman to commit suicide. She thought of her paternal grandmother who was killed in an automobile accident and recalled that she was almost happy when this occurred; that she hated this grandmother; that this was the one person she could hate as a child without disapproval because her mother disliked the grandmother. She wondered if perhaps she was concerned about rivalry with her mother for her father. She remembered stories her mother told her about herself (mother) as a child and she recalled that she always felt that she was competing with mother, not with what mother was but what mother said she was. During this hour she stated that she felt angry enough to cry and there was obviously much affect connected with the foregoing associa tion. She always felt that she could never win with her mother or other females but that she was winning now. In subsequent hours, she stated that it seemed that every body had to forfeit their individuality in relation to her mother. She was planning to move out of the parents' home and to take a job which held the promise of professional advancement as well as increasing responsibility. She ex</page><page sequence="7">An Interpretation 395 pressed her increasing fondness for the young man she had met in the church group. Considering how her mother might be thought of as dangerous, she felt that it was because her mother was not permissive enough. In one hour she stated that her mother felt it improper for the patient to walk around the house in shorts or a bathing suit. This followed her associations to her growing sexual interest in her current boy friend. The predominant focus of the material of the four months of therapy, in the context of which the above cited dream material appeared, seems to be along the following dynamic lines. Preceding the dream there seemed to be increasing references to competition with other women accompanied by working through of her regressive defensive trends, i.e., of childlike submissiveness to other women. In the hour pre vious to the dream there seemed to be a pinpointing of her self-assertive strivings in relation to her mother and aunt. In the hour in which the dream appeared there seemed to be a reference to some fear of the dangers of her assuming a more directly feminine role, along with indications of projection of her hostility onto her mother. Subsequent to this hour there appeared an efflorescence of the theme of competition with other women. This became increasingly related to her mother. She became more aware of her destructive inclina tions toward other women and a fear of her mother's restric tive attitudes, with concomitant movements away from her defensive regressed position. As was mentioned above the features of the Medusa myth dealt with in the psychoanalytic literature mainly relate to the hideous appearing head of Medusa with the snaky locks instead of hair, the beheading of Medusa, and the fact that the sight of this head turns the beholder to stone. These features are perhaps most generally thought of in relation to Medusa. We might consider, however, the significant as pects of the total myth (1, 7, 11) - in particular regarding the origin of Medusa, - which will be seen to be consonant with this clinical material. Medusa was formerly a mortal maiden, who vied with</page><page sequence="8">396 Arthur A. Miller, M.D. Athena as to her beauty. She was, consequently, punished by being turned into the hideous creature. Other versions of the myth state that the punishment was for Medusa's hav ing sexual intercourse with Poseidon in the temple of Athena. The element of competition between female was strikingly apparent as a component of the Medusa myth on a re-examin ation of this fragment of classical mythology. Since Athena appears as Medusa's irate rival, some con sideration must be given to her. She was born of Zeus, hav ing sprung from his head (note, without a mother). She was the virgin goddess of wisdom and the arts and sciences. She apparently was given to competition, for there are several stories of her contests. Pertinent to our theme is the contest Athena had with Arachne. Arachne was a mortal maiden who was very proficient at the art of weaving and embroider ing. She would not acknowledge Athena's superiority or hav ing learned her art from Athena. Arachne's failure to heed Athena's warnings resulted in a contest between them. It is noteworthy that in this contest Athena depicted her contest with Poseidon, and on the borders of her tapestry she de picted incidents illustrating the displeasure of the gods to wards presumptuous mortals who dare to contend with.them. Arachne undertook to illustrate the failings and errors of the gods. (There is to be noted that the scenes she depicted were those of Danae and the Shower of Gold, Leda and the Swan, Europa and the Bull. These are all stories in which Zeus engaged in sexual relations with mortal women, in the disguise of the shower of gold, the swan, and the bull.) Because of Arachne's presumption and impiety, Athena made her feel guilty. As a consequence, Arachne hung her self. Athena then took pity and decreed that Arachne would continue to live, but she and her progeny would eternally hang. She then changed Arachne into the spider. (Note that the spider can be considered a "polyphallic" figure resembl ing that of the head of Medusa.) In the story of the Trojan War the actual events of the war are preceded by a contest between Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite who vied with one another on the basis of who was the most beautiful.</page><page sequence="9">An Interpretation 397 The origin of Medusa is seen to be rooted in the theme of competition between women, ‚Äî goddess and presumptu ous mortal (mother - daughter!). The foregoing references to mythology relate to Olympian theology in which the gods reflect human passions and human relations. There are antecedents of this form of Greek re ligion which are less an anthropomorphic theology and are more rituals for the aversion of evil. This religion is charac terized by a deep and constant sense of evil to be removed and of the need for purification for its removal. It consists of a demonology rather than a theology, the rites being ad dressed to sprites, ghosts, and bogeys rather than articulate gods who reflect human passions and human relations. The three Gorgons, of whom Medusa is the most important, figure in this pre-olympian religion. Harrison (8) believes that the essence of Medusa is her head; that "she is in a word a mask with a body later ap pended." The primitive Greeks' ritual included a horrid being called a Gorgoneion, - a grinning mask with glaring eyes and protruding beast-like tusks and pendant tongue. This figure derives from a ritual mask. Such masks are part of the appliances of most primitive cults, - "natural agents of a religion of fear and 'riddance'." Harrison says, "The function of such masks is permanently to 'make an ugly face' at you if you are doing wrong, breaking your word, robbing your neighbour, meeting him in battle; for you if you are doing right." Such figures have as their object "the aversion of ill-will." The Gorgon, she says, wgs a sort of incarnate Evil Eye. We have seen that this patient was in conflict over the hostile implications of her competitive strivings. These im pulses could certainly be characterized as "ill-will!' and "evil," which give rise to the fear of mother's retaliation. The "ugly" facial expression of maternal displeasure might be represented in the Medusa head. It can be viewed as a projection onto the mother of the patient's ugly, evil, hostile impulses. The ugliness of the figure might also be an ex pression of the competitive wish, i.e., that in the contest over</page><page sequence="10">398 Arthur A. Miller, M.D. feminine charm mother should be ugly. CONCLUSIONS : The symbolism of the mythological figure of the Gorgon, Medusa, has been of interest to several psychoanalytic writ ers. In general certain elements of the total Medusa myth have been dealt with, i.e., the horrible appearance of the head of Medusa, the decapitation of Medusa by Perseus, the snaky locks instead of hair, and the idea that gazing upon her face turned one to stone. The existing interpretations have been mainly in terms of this figure's signficance as a representation of the castration complex, in particular the absence of the penis in the female and the psychological con sequences deriving from this fact. In this paper there is presented clinical material in which context reference to the Medusa appeared. In view of the consideration that the castration complex did not seem to be the main dynamic trend and focus in this material, but instead competition between females seemed to be the dom inant focus, the classical myth of Medusa was re-examined. Consideration of the total myth points up features which ap pear to be relevant to the presented clinical material. The origin of Medusa appears to be rooted in the theme of com petition between females - goddess and mortal maiden. Existing psychoanalytic interpretations of the myth do not focus on the origin of Medusa. Such a figure as the Medusa can well be considered to represent the condensation focus for more than one psycho sexual current. The fact that according to the myth Medusa came into being as a consequence of rivalry between her and Athena is of course as much a part of the total myth as are those elements relating to the appearance and the effect of Medusa once she came into being and to the experience of Perseus in regard to the slaying of Medusa. It appears that in the psychoanalytic literature, the latter have received more attention than the former. Consequently it is suggested that the present case points to other determinants of the symbol</page><page sequence="11">An Interpretation 399 ism of the Medusa figure ; the theme of competition between females. Possibly, the theme herein presented reflects a significance of the symbolism of the Medusa figure more in keeping with the psychosexual complexes of the female; and to the male it is more likely to have a greater relation ship to the castration complex. The present interpretive ef fort is offered as a supplement to the existing interpretations of an apparently multi-determined symbol. 664 N. Michigan Ave. Chicago (11), Illinois BIBLIOGRAPHY 1.
