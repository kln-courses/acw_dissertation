I think everybody should be a machine. -Andy Warhol Introduction In this article I explore "metal performance"--robot performances and art- works, and cyborgic performances featuring human bodies with metal pros- theses-through a close analysis of the work of artists including Guillermo G6mez-Pefia, Istvan Kantor, Laura Kikauka, Chico McMurtrie, Mark Pau- line, Marcel-li Antfinez Roca, Stelarc, Momoyo Torimitsu, and Norman White. I argue that metal performances belie deep-seated fears and fascina- tions associated with machinic embodiments, and that these are explored by artists in relation to two distinct themes: the humanization of machines and the dehumanization (or "machinization") of humans. I also examine how metal performances frequently dramatize a return to nature and the animal. Donna Haraway's essay "The Actors Are Cyborg" (I991a) explores notions of the cyborg as a performative "monster" and "boundary creature"; and Ca- nadian artists Norman White and Laura Kikauka's performance Them Fuckin' Robots (1988) features two robots that violently and comedically copulate. Themes concerning the monstrous, the transgressive, the violent, the sexual, and the humorous have each been applied to cyborgs and mechanical anthro- pomorphic figures. To these I would like to add the term "metallic camp," which reflects a particular ideology and aesthetic at play within metal perfor- mances. My central argument posits that the robot and cyborg body in performance is commonly depicted in ways that closely correspond to the politics and aes- thetics of camp. In proposing the hypothesis that metal performance is often camp, or at least manifests itself in a way that fits easily within discourses of The Drama Review 48, 4 (T184), Winter 2004. ? 2004 New York University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 15</page><page sequence="2">1 6 Steve Dixon camp, I would emphasize points made by three of camp's most prominent the- orists: firstly, Susan Sontag's ([1964] 1994) assertion that camp can be both de- liberate and accidental; secondly, Richard Dyer's ([1977] 1999) contention, that camp can be both gay and straight; and thirdly, Fabio Cleto's (1999) asser- tion that camp should not be seen as a negative or derogatory term, unlike, for example, the term "kitsch." In my use of the term "metallic camp," the word "metallic" denotes not only the physical substance that the artists employ, but also its contemporary connotations within popular music and culture as sig- nifying loud, aggressive, and resistant expression. This is juxtaposed with the knowing irony and pleasure of camp, which Susan Sontag defined as "love of the unnatural: of artifice and exaggeration" ([1964] 1994:275). The composite expression "metallic camp" further suggests a distinct place or ideological grouping (as in a "base camp" or "the anti-war camp") where people share a position or affinity. In metal performance, this relates equally to a common resistance to, and a common belief in, metal as symbolic of a desirable evolu- tionary process via cyborgism to ultimate machinic embodiment. I would stress that I do not consider all metal performance to be camp. Sur- vival Research Laboratories, for example, creates extremely butch robot battle performances waged by darkly surreal machines: combinations of dead ani- mals, junkyard scrap, and industrial and construction-site debris animated into life. The machines' designs are generally derived either from the animal king- dom: monstrous birds, worms, crabs, insects, and running legs; or from indus- trial and military models: huge and menacing cannons, tank vehicles, walking flamethrowers, crane structures, and industrial arms with snapping jaws and swinging demolition balls. But even in these brutal, crowd-pleasing battles, some elements of camp are apparent. Leonardo Da Vinci's painting of the Last Supper is parodied with the disciples as camp, life-size moving mannequins, A Brief History of Robots and Automata Although the word robot has been used to describe many machines and me- chanical devices that are not computer controlled, stricter definitions place computational operation to the fore. Ken Goldberg broadly defines a robot as "a mechanism controlled by a computer" (2001 17) and Eduardo Kac maintains that "robots are advanced computer-controlled electromechanical appliances" (200 1 a: 77). The Czech word "robota," variously translated as "work," "serf," or "forced labor," was adopted in the English-speaking world as "robot" di- rectly through the title of Karel Čapek's 1921 expressionist play R.U.R. (Ros- sum's Universal Robots). The play concerns the supplanting of humans by robots, and has been widely discussed both as a warning against Franken- steinian scientific hubris, and as an allegory of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, with the oppressed masses "recast" as robots. Its story presents an early and po- tent theatrical vision of the humanization of machines. On an island factory, hyperintelligent worker-robots are developed, and eventually rebel and take over, murdering their inventors and calling for the destruction of all human- kind. In the final act, the celibate robots fear they will die out, and Alquist, the only human they have spared, prays to God, pleading that if there are no hu- mans left anywhere in the world, the robot, as "the shadow of man" should be</page><page sequence="3">Metal Performance 17 which are stabbed and decapitated by one robot, and then shot into flames by another. A large, kitsch clown's head, dangling in the air with a happy grin, receives similar treatment. Robots are not ipso facto camp: for example, robotic industrial assembly lines, "smart" weapons, and some robotic artworks perform computer- controlled tasks without a hint of camp irony or behavioral exaggeration. But some degree of camp seems inherent in almost all "performing" anthropo- morphic and zoomorphic robots I have seen. Their movements are one key to this. Since robots currently fail to accurately mimic human and animal move- ment, their exaggerated gaits and gestures emphasize the same sense of theat- ricality and artificiality in movement that we find in camp. The artificiality of robot movement mirrors the artificiality of camp. Robotics artist Bruce Can- non has reflected that "these machines' failure to transcend their artificiality is their most significant aspect. The pieces are not so much lifelike as referential to being, and what is missing is what resonates to me" (in Wilson 2002:397). Robotic movement mimics and exaggerates but never achieves the human, just as camp movement mimics and exaggerates but never achieves womanhood. Robot kinetics involves the same degree of performative self-consciousness as "camping about," and often visually resembles it. When an anthropomorphic robot moves or when a person camps about, it is highly calculated and coded (however ingrained and natural the human camp behavior may have become). Although robots may not yet be self-aware, they are quintessential^ "self- conscious" entities, calculating and computing their every move. When a hu- manoid robot moves, just as when someone camps about, it is a knowing and self-conscious performance; its coding, artificiality, and difference from the norm is emphasized. Camp thus becomes a central, even determining aspect of anthropomorphic robot performance. able to survive and procreate. The play ends with a young male and female robot developing caring and sexual feelings for one another as Alquist declares "Go, Adam, go, Eve. The world is yours. [...] At least the shadow of man!" (Capek 1923:166). R.U.R. sends complex and mixed messages about the humanization of ma- chines. The robots are first presented as the unjustly oppressed, then as the un- feeling, evil oppressors, and finally as the sensitive, empathetic heroes and heroines of the piece offering a vicarious or deferred salvation for humanity. Contemporary robot artworks and performances have a long historical line- age, which Bruce Mazlish relates back to the Hermetic story of creation, where "man is given permission [...] to create and animate artificial beings [...] or, in my terms, machines." Mazlish notes that throughout history automata have prompted fears, since they pose "an 'irrational' threat to humans, calling into question their identity, sexuality (the basis of creation?), and powers of domination" (2002). Rodney A. Brooks notes the pneumatically operated au- tomata of Hero of Alexandria around 100 ce (2002:13), and Jeff Cook quotes Pindar from 520 все: The animated figures stand Adorning every street</page><page sequence="4">1 8 Steve Dixon Them Fuckin' Robots and Executive Machinery Intercourse For Them Fuckin' Robots, the artists agreed on some technical specifications and then worked separately to create two mechanical robots. Laura Kikauka's "female" machine included bedsprings, fur, a sewing machine treadle, a squirt- ing oil pump and a boiling kettle; Norman White's anthropomorphic "male" robot comprised metal arms and legs, gauges, assorted rotating or pumping appendages, and rapidly flickering addenda. The artists came together on the day of the first performance and assembled the joint artwork in front of the audience, connecting different pipes, pistons, and mechanical parts from one robot to the other. The robots were then activated and proceeded to "have sex," the male machine responding to the female organ's magnetic fields, which increased its movement rates and charged a capacitor. The robots per- formed to the accompaniment of a comic, cheesy organ soundtrack punctu- ated by a robotic voice incanting the words "abnormal sex behavior." According to one audience member, it was "a fun performance [...] pretty ab- surd stuff" (Jones 2001). A videotape shows an apparently delighted prome- nade audience smiling broadly at the pumping metal pistons and laughing raucously at a climax comprising exploding electrical sparks and gooey fluid oozing out of one of the robot's tubes in intermittent spurts. The pun within the phrase "them fuckin' robots" holds significance for the consideration of the contemporary context of metal performance. Beyond de- noting the literal sense of copulation, it plays on the increasingly suspicious or hostile human stance toward robots as a threat and as Other: a shout of bigotry against a hated minority. In its depiction of sexual activity, the performance presents a parody of the humanization of machines. At the same time there is recognition of the possibility of some kind of future robotic procreation. As Bernard de Fontenelle maintains: "put a Dog Machine and a Bitch Machine And seem to breathe in stone, or Move their marble feet, (in Cook 1997) Max von Boehn dates the first anthropomorphic automata back to the third century все and suggests evidence that small automata existed in Aristotle's time, citing his reference in Physics to a silver doll that moved like a living be- ing ([1929] 1972:8). Joseph Needham describes a vast array of mechanical fig- ures, animals, birds, and fishes constructed in ancient China, as well as mechanized chariots and a flying automaton that he dates circa 380 все (1975). The first clockwork automata were constructed in the 14th century, and clocks with automated figures became common on European cathedrals, in- cluding "crowing cocks, bears that shook heads, a king who turned a sand- glass, and the twelve apostles moving in a circle" (von Boehn 1972:10). Bowing royal figures were common features, including three kings at Stras- bourg Cathedral (1352) and seven bowing princes who passed before an au- tomaton of Emperor Charles IV at twelve o'clock at the Marienkapelle in Nürnberg (1361). The clock tower at Soleure, built in 1452, "depicts a warrior beating his chest on the quarter-hours, while a skeleton clutching an arrow turns his head to the soldier on the first stroke of each hour" (Sussman 1999:88). In 1509 Leonardo Da Vinci constructed a lion that could walk; a</page><page sequence="5">Metal Performance 1 9 side by side, and eventually a third little machine will be the result" (in La- queuer 1990: 155). Them Fuckin' Robots explicitly encapsulates what Claudia Springer (1996) identifies as our contemporary fascination with the conjunction of technology and sexuality. These quirky and humorous fornicating machines also perfectly embody the performance of metallic camp. Robot copulation features strongly in the work of The Seemen robotic performance group, who construct mon- strous metal creatures that do battle, often amid raging fires. The company suggest that the robots "poetically symbolize man's struggles and triumphs" (in Wilson 2002:437) while the flames are metaphors for a range of ideas, from purification to rivers and waterfalls, and male ejaculation. Performances fea- ture "trees armed with flamethrowers, underwater sea monsters spitting fire from watery depths, flaming robots fucking, fighting and lovemaking" (Spel- letich 2001). The sex acts between robots in performances such as Violent Ma- chines Perform Acts of Loue (1998) are often presented as caring and loving, their tender movements emphasizing the machines' humanization. In Istvan Kantor's Executive Machinery Intercourse (1999) another loud, ex- treme, and sexualized metallic camp performance is played out. Filing cabinets fill the space, their drawers pulled open and banged shut by different metal- armed hydraulic constructions, creating a cacophony of metallic noise. Kantor describes the mise-en-scène as follows: "The [...] monolithic file cabinet ma- chines are linked together by computers and integrated into a giant network that functions as both kinesonic machinery and an interactive monument serving the entire world with information" (2002). This metal monument to global information is then, in true camp style, well and truly "fucked." A number of filing cabinets stand alone, their drawers pumping out automatically without the aid of external machine arm devices. 16th-century automaton from Brittany performed a mechanical crucifixion scene; and during the 17th century, karakuri automata performed the tea- serving ceremony in Japan. During the 1 8th century a number of European "master" automata crafts- men emerged, such as Jacques de Vaucanson who built a robot duck that could waddle, quack, eat, drink, and defecate; and father and son Pierre and Henri Louis Jacquet-Droz who constructed figures that could draw and play the pi- ano. A female organ player, also by the Jacquet-Droz family, "simulated breathing and gaze direction, looking at the audience, her hands and the mu- sic" (Brooks 2002:15), and their boy automaton The Scribe (1772) sat at a desk dipping a quill into an inkpot and writing, among other things, Descartes's declaration "I think, therefore I am." Michel Foucault argues that the sophis- ticated automata of the 1 8th century were not simply animated illustrations of organisms, but more importantly "political puppets, small-scale models of power." He points out that Frederick the Great, "the meticulous king of small machines, well trained regiments and long exercises, was obsessed by them" (Foucault 1979:136). In 1807 Napoleon was defeated in a game of chess by an automated player dressed as a Turkish sorcerer and smoking a hookah, although its moves were decided by a man concealed in the box on which the figure sat, who viewed the board through a system of mirrors. Built by Wolfgang de Kempelen in</page><page sequence="6">20 Steve Dixon As the pneumatic drawers shoot in and out, live male and female performers writhe and gyrate against them in a display of determined and often violent eroticism; simulating high-energy sex with insistent, hard pelvic thrusts. Au- dience members are also invited to join in. The metal information monuments then fuck back, faster and faster. It is a true meat-and-metal cybernetic system of stimulus and response, data exchanges and feedback. A line of four video projections (each running the same image) fills the back cyclorama, playing frantically speeded up i950s-style black-and-white pre- recorded footage of performers engaged in machine sex. A young woman dressed like Marilyn Monroe with blonde wig and a Seven Year Itch- style white dress gyrates against the relentlessly thrusting drawers, panting orgasm- ically; an office secretary fucks the cabinets enthusiastically while conducting an intermittent and furious row with her boss. The performance juxtaposes a Bacchanalian orgy with a Kafkaesque nightmare of the office machine gone mad. It shares with Them Fuckin' Robots a delight in "comic pornography," which Cleto identifies as a common characteristic of camp within queer aes- thetics (1999:3 1), and what David Bergman terms camp's "self-conscious eroti- cism that throws into question the naturalization of desire" (1993:5). The pneumatic filing cabinets are more athletic than the human performers: they are fitter machines. But the human copulatory movements emphasize the fluid anatomies and sensual choreographies of the human body in contrast to the rigid straight lines and sexually unsophisticated "in-out" action of the cab- inet drawers. The performance manifests the difference between soft, sensual, impulsive, and easily exhausted flesh and hard, repetitive, robotic metal. It also emphasizes the link between "the sculptural system of the file cabinet [... and] the mutating human body, eroticized and abused by technology" (Kantor 2002). 1769, the automaton is described by Mark Sussman as "a dramaturgical hybrid of theatre, magic, and science" (1999:93), and was invoked by Walter Benja- min as an allegory of the mythical "wish-image," symbolizing a historical ma- terialist thrust that reifies progress yet conceals its inner workings. The "little hunchback, who was an expert chess player" sits hidden within the machine conjuring a type of magic like an alternative "theology, which today, as we know, is wizened and has to keep out of sight" ([1950] 1999:245). In recent years, Artificial Intelligence has replaced the concealed human expert in the box, and in 1997 IBM's "Deep Blue" became the first chess supercomputer to defeat the grandmaster Gary Kasparov over a six-game series. In his 1948 exposition of cybernetics, Norbert Wiener reflected at length on the history of the automaton as a simulacrum that reflects both the tech- nology and the ideology of its age: This desire to produce and study automata has always been expressed in terms of the living technique of the age. In the days of magic, we have the bizarre and sinister concept of the Golem, that figure of clay into which the Rabbi of Prague breathed life. [...] In the time of Newton, the automaton becomes the clockwork music box, with the little effigies pirouetting stiffly on top. In the nineteenth century, the automaton is a glorified heat engine, burning some combustible fuel instead of the gly-</page><page sequence="7">Metal Performance 21 The Machinization of Humans and the Humanization of Machines The sexual themes oí Them Fuckin' Robots and Executive Machinery Intercourse articulate two closely related contemporary anxieties related to "unnatural co- ition" between humans and machines. These center first on the increasing humanization of machines, and second, on the gradual dehumanization of hu- mans in the face of technology. These two forces are seen as prompting hu- mans toward a gradual evolution into machines and metallic embodiments by virtue of their increasing faith in, affinity with, and psychophysical transfor- mation by machines. This second concept of the dehumanization of humans may therefore also be expressed as the mechanization of humans. But, given the negative connotations of the word "mechanization" in relation to people (suggesting a zombie-like workforce performing repetitive actions), I will use the term machinization, since cyborgic metal is (in theory) intended to sensi- tize and expand human physical and mental capabilities rather than to desen- sitize and reduce them. As early as 1954, Norbert Wiener proposed a radical machinization of hu- mans, suggesting that "we have modified our environment so radically that we must now modify ourselves in order to exist in this new environment" (1954:46). In his earlier groundbreaking work Cybernetics ([1948] 1961) Wie- ner also considered at length the humanization of machines, maintaining that the question of whether machines could be considered to be alive or not was largely semantic. For Wiener machines were alive because they were physi- cally animate and operationally active. The idea of human transformation into metal reaches its logical conclusion with Hans Moravec's (1988) assertion that by the middle of the 21st century it will be possible to download one's entire consciousness into a computer. In The Universal Robot (1991), Moravec dra- matizes this notion into a Frankensteinian surgical operation where the con- cogen of human muscles. Finally, the present automaton opens doors by means of photocells, or points guns to a place at which a radar beam picks up an airplane, or computes the solution of a differential equation. ([1948] 1961:39-40) Notable mechanical automata of the early 20th century included Elektro, the Moto-Man and his mechanical dog Sparko which aroused enormous excite- ment at the 1939 New York World's Fair, despite being "nothing more than a bunch of gears and motors capable of doing simple movements" (Stark 2003). Twenty-five years later, the New York World's Fair hosted the first appearance of one of the most famous and celebrated performing anthropomorphic ro- bots, Disney's "Audio-Animatronic" figure of Abraham Lincoln (1964). The- Lincoln robot, which became the star attraction at Disneyland the following year, was the most advanced anthropomorphic figure of its time, and was de- cidedly, if unintentionally, camp: America's 16th President stood up to deliver a monologue composed from edited highlights from patriotic speeches in a high-pitched, mechanical voice. The Lincoln robot, which features as the fi- nale of a part film, part live performance Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln (1965), has continued as a major Disneyland attraction ever since, and was re- designed and upgraded in 2003 .

Your suddenly abandoned body dies. For a moment you experience only quiet and dark [...]. Your perspective has shifted [...and] reconnected to a shiny new body of the style, colour and material of your choice. Your meta- morphosis is complete. (1991:25) Moravec suggests that humans can either "adopt the fabulous mechanisms of robots, thus becoming robots themselves, or they can retire into obscurity" (1988:87). Metal performance reflects this techno-zeitgeist, which senses a gradual but inevitable merging of flesh and metal. There are thus two routes * to the robot, which are perceived as operating simultaneously: one via AI, building artificially intelligent, sentient beings; the other through cyborgism, adapting the human form to a supposedly "superior" robotic and computa- tional physiognomy. The camp aesthetics that I associate with metallic perfor- mance derive equally from artists who largely affirm and embrace such metamorphoses, and from those who are skeptical or oppositional. Performances by the proponents of flesh and metal symbiosis can be sited frequently within the aesthetics of camp by virtue of their theatrical and com- putational codes of high-artifice and excess, and through their celebration of "monstrous" transgression. Robotic and cyborgic embodiments relate per- fectly to the camp sensibility, particularly in relation to gay camp, which dis- tinguishes and celebrates difference and otherness as a coded or blatant affront to straight society's notions of what is subversive or alien to the norm. While expressions of opposition to the mainstream characterizes many avantgardě forms, the use of camp as an aesthetic device in metal performance is quite a ioo-year-old automaton of a bird in a gilded cage, which proved the inspi- ration for Disneyland's first audio-animatronic attraction: a collection of sing- ing birds that filled the Enchanted Tiki Room, which was opened in 1963. Disney's "Imagineer" technologists have continued to develop sophisticated and often kitsch or camp performing anthropomorphic and zoomorphic ro- bots ever since, from Disney characters and sword-fighting pirates to their most recent high-tech creation, Lucky (2003). Disney's first "walk-alone" an- imatronic character, Lucky is a nine-foot-tall and twelve-foot-long green di- nosaur with a propensity to hiccups, designed to roam and intelligently interact with visitors. In the same year that the audio-animatronic Lincoln made its first appear- ance, Nam June Paik and Shuya Abe created Robot K-456 (1964), a life-size, 20-channel remote control female humanoid that walked through the New York streets. It flapped its arms, excreted beans, and played John F. Kennedy's inaugural address through a speaker in its mouth. A dynamic, humorous, and camp creation with a large square head and "junkyard" body parts including toy airplane propeller eyes and rotating Styrofoam breasts, Eduardo Kac sug- gests it is more a "caricature of humanity" than "a cause of fear (of lost jobs, of erased identity)" (200ia:78). In 1982, Robot K-456 was involved in a staged ac- cident when it was hit by an automobile as it ventured off the sidewalk in a performance entitled The First Catastrophe of the Twenty-First Century.</page><page sequence="9">Metal Performance 23 specific to its particular form of transgressive rhetoric, what Mark Dery calls its "rituals of resistance" (1996:150). Camp preens and shows off, it uses narcissism to define and express its on- tology of difference, and to draw attention to itself. It exaggerates physical and vocal expression to "stand out," the meaning of one of its various etymologi- cal origins, the Italian verb campeggiare (Knights 2003). Its French root, se camper , translates as "self-conscious posturing" (Ross 1989:157), while its Indo-European origin, kamp , reflects the physical shapes and movements of camp's postures: curved, flexible, articulated (Cleto 1999:29-30). Gay camp is also a "fuck you" stance, sticking a finger up at the conformist social perfor- mance of normative male heterosexuality, and ridiculing machismo posturing. It registers membership in an exclusive, even superior club. Just as the cyborg signifies an advanced or evolved form of the human, a metamorphosis that separates it from the crowd, so too males who "camp about" register and dis- play to the outside world that they have undergone their own specific evolu- tion. They have developed, among other things, an understanding of their feminine side, ironic wit, aesthetic sensibility, and sexual self-knowledge. Metal performances by artists resistant to, or skeptical of, the bio-metallic fusion utilize similar camp high-theatrics, and, additionally, harness the self- parodic, barbed humor of camp to point at the inherent comedy, absurdity, and danger of metallic embodiments. The latter approach is evident in Brian Frisk's Wearerobots.com website (Frisk 2002) which features animations of ro- bots with human temperaments and emotions. The machines' similarities with humans and their struggle with their feelings is darkly comic; Sad Robot grap- ples with his sense of identity, wailing that "some people don't even know I'm a robot, they think I'm Puerto Rican, but just really good at math." The ro- bots betray human aspirations, but more particularly human emotional weak- nesses and failings. One depressed robot pours out his heart in group Robotic art developed slowly but significantly during the 1960s alongside interactive kinetic sculptures by artists such as James Seawright, whose Searcher (1966) and Watcher (1966) moved and emitted different sound patterns in re- sponse to movements and light changes going on around them. Seawrighťs work was featured in the seminal 1968 Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition at Lon- don's Institute of Contemporary Arts, which included a number of robots and kinetic sculptures considered marvels of their time. Edward Ihnatowicz's SAM (Sound Activated Mobile, 1968), for example, was "the first moving sculpture which moved directly and recognizably in response to what was going on around it" (Zivanovic 2002). A vertebrae-like construction with a flower-like head, it used miniature hydraulic pistons to twist, turn, and move in the direc- tion of visitors' sounds. Reflecting back on the Cybernetic Serendipity exhibi- tion 30 years later, however, Mitchell Whitelaw reminds us that these early art machines act "as a quaint, slightly humorous reminder of the humble origins of the field: daggy plotter graphics, clunky lights and sounds, crude sensing 'robots' [...,] a caricature of late-sixties science-dag" (1998). In recent years Japan has become the focus for some of the most advanced anthropomorphic robotic developments, and it is important to note that there are significant cultural differences in perceptions of the robot in the East and in the West. Popular attitudes toward robotics are highly enthusiastic in Japan, in part as a result of a cultural history of positive images such as "Mighty</page><page sequence="10">24 Steve Dixon therapy; another becomes increasingly furious during a telephone call when only humans are available to speak to: "It's impossible to get through to a ma- chine these days!" he curses. The robots also transgress human protocols by directly speaking their minds, like Angrybot, a schoolteacher who tells his stu- dents that their homework is to go home and kill themselves. The animations express deep-seated anxieties about the humanization of machines. They point to the recognition that as technology advances there is a gradual diminution of the differences between human and machine. Robots become more human-like through developments in artificial intelligence, and humans become more robot-like as they grow more alienated and remote from their own and others' humanity through their increasing reliance upon technology. Norman White, one of the artists behind Them Fuckin' Robots , subverts the idea of artificial intelligence by designing robots which he imbues with what he calls "artificial sanity." He has designed a number of "contrary" and antisocial robots, such as Facing Out, Laying Low (1977) which stops inter- acting with audiences when it feels bored or is given too many competing stimuli. His Helpless Robot, or H LR (1988) speaks but does not move, and dis- plays a distinctly camp bitchiness in its dealings with gallery visitors, whose stupidity it berates, whatever they may do. White describes it as "the classic 'hustler' For instance, it might initially enlist human cooperation with a polite "Excuse me. ..have you got a moment?", or any one of such unimposing phrases. It might then ask to be rotated: "Could you please turn me just a bit to the right... No! not that way... the other way!" In such a way, as it senses cooperation, it tends to become ever more demanding, becom- ing in the end, if its human collaborators let it, dictatorial, (in Rokeby 1999) Atom" (known as "Astro Boy" in the U.S.), an iconic cartoon robot of the 1950s and '60s. Japanese robotic artist Kenji Yanobe is one of many to discuss the differing East- West attitudes toward robots, also noting the more recent cute and friendly robots depicted in Manga comics (Wilson 2003:443). In the West, by contrast, the robot more commonly has been perceived as a threat: both to jobs and to human beings themselves. Literary and cinematic fiction is filled with robots who turn on their makers or run amok, including HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), the robot played by Yul Bryner in Westworld (1973), and the replicants in Blade Runner (1982). In 2002, Robodex, the world's largest robot exhibition in Yokohama, Southwest of Tokyo, brought together 90 different robots. These included a troupe of Seiko Epson's miniature Monsieur II-P, which performed a robot bal- let, and Sony's latest entertainment robots, SRD-4X which, according to a BBC report "wowed the crowds with their dancing performances." Zoomor- phic robots for domestic use included Sanyo's robot guard dog and Tmsuk's Banryu , a $14,000 home security robot dinosaur, which walks around the house detecting intruders or smoke, whereupon it contacts the emergency services and owner. But the highlight of the exhibition was Honda's Asirno, the world's most advanced humanoid robot in 2002. Asimo can walk forward or backward, climb stairs, and make turns as it walks (previous robots had to stop before they could turn). The four-foot-</page><page sequence="11">Metal Performance 25 New York- based Japanese performance artist Momoyo Torimitsu's robot Miyata Jiro (2001) encapsulates both the humanization of machines and the machinization of humans. Miyata Jiro is a realistic, life-size, balding business- man that crawls on its belly along the streets of the financial districts of major cities, while Torimitsu walks behind and tends it, dressed as a nurse. A satirical commentary on the humiliating conformity of Japanese "salaryman" culture, the robot presents a cowed and hyperrealistic counterpoint to the camp heroic excesses of many robot performances. Fears of enslavement associated with dystopian predictions of machines superseding human beings are short- circuited in a stark and parodie reversal. In replacing the human form, Miyata Jiro merely serves to expose the degree to which human beings are already on their knees and enslaved to cultural conformity, the work ethic, and capital. The medical sustenance to the humanized machine provided by Tori- mitsu's caring nurse character is elaborated in Eduardo Kac and Ed Bennett's A-Positive (1997), where the dual notions of human machinization and robot humanization are even more starkly depicted. A performer is connected to a robot through an intravenous needle, and actually "feeds" the robot (or "biobot") with blood, which flows visibly through a clear tube connecting the human body and the machine. The robot extracts oxygen from the blood and uses it to sustain a tiny and erratic flame, while reciprocating the fluid ex- change and completing the sense of human-machine symbiosis by sending an intravenous drip of dextrose into the human body. The visual symbolism mixes medical imagery, cybernetics, and Gothic horror. The piece is calm and understated but distinctly unsettling. It is at once a peaceful and uncompli- cated image of body-machine connection, literalizing a circular biological life-flow between human flesh and metal robot, but it also conjures vividly the dark, fearful myths of Frankenstein and Dracula. Flesh is penetrated to give succor to the non-human, "undead" machine and human oxygen is breathed high humanoid is a smaller version of Honda's P3 robot, and has six degrees of freedom on each limb, incorporates 26 servo motors, and moves and walks with remarkable balance and smoothness. It also has a photographic memory, remembering everyone to whom it is introduced, and addressing them by name on subsequent meetings. Asimo has become a celebrated robot per- former, appearing in television advertisements, amusement parks, and high- tech stage shows during a long North American educational tour of science museums and institutions from 2003/04. In Japan's Fukuoka Dome Stadium in 2002, Asimo played soccer in one of 188 robot teams from 29 countries competing in "RoboCup 2002." Coinciding with soccer's human World Cup, robot five-a-side teams played 20-minute games in the knockout tour- nament, most of which were drawn at full time, and were decided on penalty shoot-outs. While Asimo is designed in a classic I950s-style vision of a "metal-man," with robot body and astronaut helmet-head, anthropomorphic realism is de- veloping rapidly in research centers such at the Tokyo Science University. Fu- mio Hara has created female humanoid robot faces made of translucent silicone rubber, which can approximate human expression changes using a range of systems and materials including "Shape Memory Metals." -SD</page><page sequence="12">26 Stcc Dixoni 1. 2.

The machine is directly humanized, pumped by corporeal fluid, while the human body beside it is machinized, its own life-blood in- vaded and fed by technology.' Increasingly, both medical science and art practices imbricate flesh with ma- chine technologies, and it is pertinent to note in relation to A-Positih'c the words of an early heart transplant patient in 1969, who reflected on both the wonder and the significant psychophilosophical anxiety involved in his opera- tion: Seeing my blood outside of my body running through coils of synthetic tubing is deeply distressing [...a] miraculous [...] powerful monster [...] with an almost frightening hold on my life [...,] reducing me to a "half- robot, half-man." (in O'Mahony 2002:81) Robotics is now making an important impact within medical surgery, where robotic arms such as "robodoc" are used to make precision bone incisions. NASA, eager to demonstrate that their space hardware research has impli- cations closer to home, has funded and collaborated on a number of robotic surgical appliances. These include the Automated Endoscopic System for Op- timal Positioning (AESOP), developed by Computer Motions Inc., a robotic arm whose precision exceeds human dexterity. Using AESOP's intelligent voice-recognition system, the human surgeon controls all the robot endo- scope's movements and operation by simply talking to it. Robots known as "Nursebots," which can monitor and dispense medication, and detect emer- gencies such as falls using video-recognition systems, are being developed by researchers at Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh Universities to act as caregivers in the homes of elderly and disabled people (O'Mahony 2002:00o-02).</page><page sequence="13">Afetal PCerforallll e 27 Sociable Robots Simon Penny's robot artwork Petit M1al (i1995) takes its name from neurol- ogy, meaning "an epileptic condition, a short lapse of consciousness" (Penny 2001) and its inspiration from artificial-life technologies. According to Ste- phen Wilson it is "a landmark attempt to create robots with genuine auton- omy" (2002:427). The robot is visually unimpressive-a thin, three-foot-high robot mounted on bicycle wheels-but its intelligent behavior and fluid dance-like mnovements are sophisticated as it pursues and engages visitors in subtle physical interactions. Penny's goal was to create the first truly autono- mous robot artwork, which possessed charm and wit, and which was "neither anthropomorphic nor zoomorphic, but [...] unique to its physical and elec- tronic nature" (in Wilson 2002:346). In his paper "Embodied Cultural Agents" he describes Petit Mal as: the construction of a seemingly sentient and social machine from mini- mnal components, the generation of an agent interface utilising purely kinesthetic or somatosensory modes which "speak the language of the body" and bypasses textual, verbal, or iconic signs.

The robot becomes a new form ofso- cial being, a creature of charm, sensitivity, and kinesthetic intelligence, able to act and respond autonomously in relation to people and situations around it. Charm and sociability characterize many of the robots of Amorphic Robot Works, directed by San Francisco robotics artist Chico McMurtrie. The promenade performance The Ancestral Path through the Amorphic Landscape (2000) features some 60 digitally controlled humanoid and animal robot fig- ures ranging from about two feet to over thirty feet high. They emerge from a massive hydraulically inflated landscape from where many are "birthed," tear- ing through and rising up from inside the fabric and rubber surface. During the performance the landscape grows robotic trees, expands, contracts, and changes shape, creating hills, mountains, and caverns for the robots to move through and inhabit. The performance is a loud, chaotic, and magical metal menagerie. Some ro- bots are powerful and God-like figures; some are sinister hybrid animal crea- tures, such as the "dog-monkeys" that patrol the space; and others are comic, camp, and dysfunctional caricatures of humans. Small, stick-like anthropo- morphic robots shake and scuttle around a cave complete with waterfall, their metal penises rotating through 360 degrees. Skeletal metal figures perform ac- robatics, play kettledrums and beat bongos, and frantically draw charcoal scribble pictures on canvas. Benign, gangly humanoids wobble and amble around comically, while others climb up and down ropes, surveying the scene below.</page><page sequence="15">Metal Performance 29 The humanization of the robot is emphasized skilfully through the robots' distinctly human personalities, foibles, and failings. One robot fails to catch a ball, and its frustration leads to animated gestures of annoyance, which leads to limb-flailing anger, which finally leads to what appears to be the very human act of male masturbation. The robots appear and disappear, communicate and interact, and play vibrant and complex percussion "symphonies" together, mixing African drums, xylophones, and industrial noise. But also, they fail, and then fail again, and again; like the "Tumbling Man," a heavy, life-size ro- bot made of thick metal piping and powered by compressed air, which repeat- edly performs forward rolls in an ultimately vain attempt to stand up. Here, the company presents a Beckettian aesthetics of anthropomorphic robot impo- tence and failure. McMurtrie describes how the robots' actions "depict the most primal as- pects of the human condition: elegant, strong, and threatening and at the same time, weak and pathetic. [...T]hey form a unique and vulnerable society, af- fected by technology, and the environment in which they are placed" (2001). The Ancestral Path through the Amorphic Landscape is an ecological fable, a hu- manist statement, and a robotic performance tour deforce which transfixes au- diences. Its great charm and humor, its empathetic force, and its emotional power come not only from the sophistication of the robots, but also their idi- osyncratic personalities, which are drawn from acute observation of human quirks and foibles. The company's computer systems designer and program- mer, Rick Sayre, suggests that the machines are "less like industrial robots and more like puppets. [...T]heir puppetlike quality makes them harder to control, but it also makes you empathize with them because they appear to be strug- gling" (in Dery 1996:I 35). As Jason Spingarn-Koff points out, most of the ro- bots are "benign, even cute. [...T]he machines' earthly qualities-organic form, movement, music-are most exceptional. The fact that these machines possess such vivid, living sensibilities is amazing and frightening" (1997). McMurtrie describes the performance as "a study of the human condition in sculpture and movement" (20oo) and tour director Mark Ruch reflects that: As there is beauty and elegance in movement itself, there is equally po- tent experience in watching a machine (human or organic in form) struggling to stand, attempting to throw a rock, or playing a drum. These primal activities, when executed by machines, evoke a deep and sometimes emotional reaction. It is the universality of emotional experi- ence which intrigues us, and it is the contrapuntal use of machines as ar- tistic medium and organic movement as form which, perhaps ironically, combine to provoke these reactions most readily. (2001) Amorphic Robot Works' performances extend and "make flesh" early avant- garde experiments around the image of the mechanized body-from Foregger's machinic tafiatrenage dance training and Meyerhold's robotic biomechanic movements to Oscar Schlemmer's Bauhaus performances and Gordon Craig's call for the replacement of the actor by the Ubermarionette. Margaret Morse (1998) has reflected how robots come to resemble their creators, and how their creators see themselves in them. This certainly appears true in McMurtrie's case. When we spent a day filming the performance and interviewing him for the Digital Performance Archive,2 he treated the robots like human progeny, constantly concerned for their health and temperament, and offering them what I can only describe as unconditional maternal love and care. The idea of anthropomorphic robots being a form of male procreation has been put for- ward by Jeff Cook, who describes a "patriarchal dream of parthenogenesis" which escapes the "the indeterminate and unreasonable realm" offlesh, nature,</page><page sequence="16">30 Steve Dixon 4. &amp; 5.

In Stelarc's cyborgic perfor- mances the body is extended and modified to physically incorporate technology and function within electronic worlds and spaces. (?

He reflects that there has been surprisingly little com- mentary on the notion of male procreation at play within developments in artificial intelligence, artificial life, and robotics. Robots and Animals Stelarc's Exoskeleton (1998) is a large and imposing six-legged pneumatically powered robot, which Stelarc stands on top of, on a rotating turntable. Stelarc wears an extended robotic left arm, and moves around the space, his body swinging from side to side as he controls the robot's spider-like walking move- ments via computer-translated arm gestures, amidst a deafening "cacophony of pneumatic and mechanical and sensor modulated sounds" (Stelarc 2000:572; original italics). Though created and performed with no conscious camp irony whatsoever, Exoskeleton nonetheless constitutes a monumental piece of metal- lic camp. As well as conforming to the sense of inherently camp robotic move- ment I have outlined, it also epitomizes what Cleto calls "the camp obsession with images of power" (1999:3 I) and what Sontag terms camp's "fascinating fascism" (I98O). Stelarc's cyborgic performances underlie his concern to develop ways in which the body can be extended and modified to physically incorporate tech- nology and effectively function within electronic worlds and spaces. This re- verses conventional metaphors and views of a disembodied body operating in virtual space. In Stelarc's version, the body does not leap out and float serenely in cyberspace; it demands instead that technology and the matrix of cyber- space be brought into the body in order to advance and reconfigure its cor- poreal physiology and ontology. During the 1990s, in performances such as Fractal Flesh (I995), Ping Body (1996), and ParaSite (I997), Stelarc wore a per- spex and metal robot "third arm" and connected his body via a mass of cables to a computer. Through different interface systems, signals sent via the inter- net remotely stimulated muscles in different parts of his body via electrical sensors, activating a startling and macabre physical performance. Here the de- humanization and machinization of the body by technology is taken to ex- tremes, with Stelarc's body reduced to little more than an empty shell: a human cadaver to be jerked like a puppet in some macabre human-computer game. Exoskeleton uses a reverse paradigm, with Stelarc firmly in control of the tech- nology and celebrating the powerful solidity of the metallically enhanced body. Stelarc is thus a paradoxical figure who plays both the supplicant and the visionary warrior in relation to new technologies. His performances symbol- ize the inadequacy of the human form in the face of technology, but simulta- neously encapsulate the will to harness its powers toward an actual evolution and transubstantiation of the body. It is significant that in the evolutionary technological vision of Exoskeleton, Stelarc returns to nature and the animal kingdom, making literal De- leuze and Guattari's ([1980] 1988) theoretical con- struct of "becoming animal." Deleuze and Guattari's discourse stresses that "becoming animal does not consist in playing animal or imitating an animal [...;] becoming is never imitating" ([1980] 1988:238, 305). Rather, much like Exoskeleton's cybernetic system "a man and an animal combine, neither of which resem- bles the other, neither of which imitates the other, each deterritorializing the other. [...] A system of re- lay and mutations through the middle" (306). Many scientists believe that following a catastro-</page><page sequence="17">Metal Performance 31 phe such as a global nuclear war, insects will survive while mammals will not. Stelarc's choice of spider's legs thus marks an important choice in his metallic evolutionary vision. Ten years earlier, in 1988, one of the most advanced robots of its time was Rodney A. Brooks's six-legged insect robot, Ghengis. Brooks reflects on the peculiarly lifelike qualities the robot exhibited, unlike any he had made or seen: [I]t came to life! It had a wasplike personality: mindless determination. But it had a personality. It chased and scrambled according to its will,</page><page sequence="18">32 Steve Dixon not to the whim of the human controller. It acted like a creature, and to me and others who saw it, it felt like a creature. It was an artificial crea- ture [...]. Of course, software is not lifelike itself. But software organized the right way can give rise to lifelike behaviour-it can cross the boundary from machinelike [...] to animal-like. (2002:46) Zoomorphic robots have been a staple within metal performance, and the first computer-controlled robot artwork, Edward Ihnatowicz's The Senster (1971), took its form from the animal kingdom. A large, metal construction like a lobster's claw, it moved toward still and quiet observers and shrank back from loud or animated ones. The observers' movements and sounds were monitored by motion-detectors and microphones and fed into a digital Philips minicomputer, which processed the data and activated the robot's kinetic re- sponses. Zoomorphic robot performances often present ecological messages as seen, for example, in Amorphic Robot Works' events, and in Brett Gold- stone's Bird Land (1990). Bird Land is set in a Los Angeles parking lot against a mural background depicting rock formations composed of petrified human corpses. Large, skinny mutant bird robots, ingeniously crafted entirely from recycled Dumpster junk, roam a contaminated "postapocalyptic wasteland" flapping their steam powered wings, pecking at garbage, and eating tin cans. A pair of spindly, disembodied legs move stork-like across a man-made pool of water, then fall and twitch in death throes as gallons of oil turn the water jet black (Dery 1996:137-38). Other notable zoomorphic performances include a collaborative animal ro- bot project, Zoo des Robots, which was exhibited in Paris between 1986 and 1991; and Joe Davis's solar powered Desert Crawler (1986) robot slowly roamed the desert making animal-like tracks in the sand. Matt Heckert's hybrid insect-horse-bird The Walk-and-Peck Machine (1985, with Survival Research Laboratories), moved on beetle-like legs and spiked wheels, attacking other robots with its bird-beak. Louis-Philippe Demers and Bill Vorn's At the Edge of Chaos (1995) involved four robots that fight like animals over a metal cube as though it is a piece of meat (Kac 2oo00ib). Two opposing ideologies operate in metal performance's recurrent theme of the return to nature and the animal. One rages at the inherent "blasphemy": portraying or satirizing the robotic body's sinister and alien relationship to the natural, and stimulating the types of psychological fears that Sigmund Freud discusses in relation to automata as symbols of "the uncanny" ([1919] 1985).3 The other emphasizes the metal body's kinship with nature, as a creature born of the natural evolutionary process. David Rothenberg describes how tech- nology "imitates nature in its matter of operation, but completes what nature alone has only hinted at [...It] represents the human penchant to go beyond nature, completing our place in the natural world" (1995:7-8). In these terms, the metal body simultaneously imitates and reaches beyond the natural world, signifying a new and dominant survival-of-the-fittest figure, using (or abus- ing) the laws of "natural evolution" to complete the Darwinian project. The first Futurist manifesto of 1909 equated an automobile with a shark, celebrated the machine as a new animal form, and declared that in the man-machine union "We're about to see the Centaur's birth" (Marinetti [190o9] 1996:289). The "becoming animal" of the metal body resonates both with Descartes's ([1637] 1975) much-contested theory of the soulless animal-automaton, and with Donna Haraway's notion of the cyborg as a creature transgressing "the boundary between human and animal" which is unafraid of its "joint kinship with animals and machines" ([I9851 1991b:I152). The contemporary human urge to return to the animal reflects a postmod-</page><page sequence="19">Metal Performance 33 ern consciousness that senses a denaturing, a spiritual erosion, and a loss of the real in the face of technology. Ironically, both in Haraway's seminal discourse on cyborgism and in metal performance, technology is seen as a route to re- establish human connections with nature and the animal. As Don Ihde argues in Technology and the Lifeworld: From Garden to Earth (990o), there is a double attraction to both technology and nature within contemporary postmodern society. But the juxtaposition of robots and real animals in metal performance has also created fearful and macabre images of cruelty and violence. A robot de- capitated frozen pigeons in Mark Pauline's Machine Sex (1979), and Chris Csikszentmihalyi's Species Substitute (1996) brought together live ants and a ro- bot that systematically fed them and then killed them. Conjunctions between animals and machines, in effect creating contemporary metal-animal "mythi- cal creatures," have similarly produced disquieting results. For Rabot (I98I), Pauline attached a robot exoskeleton to a dead rabbit to produce a sinister hybrid robot-rabbit that walked backward; and in Piggly- Wiggly (1981, with Monte Cazzaza) he mounted a cow's head and pig's feet and skin onto a me- tallic creature. Further grotesque metal and dead animal combinations featured in the first performance by Pauline's Survival Research Laboratories company, A Cruel and Relentless Plot to Pervert the Flesh of Beasts to Unholy Uses (1982). These in- cluded a "Mummy-Go-Round" carousel of mummified, dissected animals, and a part metal, part dog-cadaver robot mounted on a remote-controlled cart. The dog-robot lunged around the space, its jaws set open in a fierce snarl and its whole dog head spinning in circles on a spindle neck "in ghoulish im- itation of cartoon violence" (Dery 1996: 118). Pauline suggests the use of dis- sected dead animals reminds his audiences of "the delicacy of the human form turned inside out" and ensures they do not consume his performances as they would the fake gore of Hollywood or Disney-style mechanical puppet shows (in Dery 196: 118). Pieces of pig skin, hand sewn with wide stitches around its joints, cover the metal exoskeleton of Sergi Jorda and Marcel-li Antiinez Roca's robot oAn, l'Home de Carn (JoAn, the Flesh Man, 1992). A naked humanoid figure with a large flaccid penis and wide eyes staring through a Zorro-style half-mask, its grotesque patchwork body of pigskin pieces stitched at each joint recalls pop- ular cinema images of Frankenstein's monster. It is interesting to note that Mary Shelley's original novel Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus ([T818] 1994), the precursor of numerous novels and films about artificial or robotic beings, is said to have been inspired by a 19th-century message-writing clockwork-human automaton (Malone 1978). Although Frankenstein is part of a long lineage of mythic creation narratives such as Pygmalion, Prometheus, and the Golem, as Catherine Waldby points out, "what distinguishes Fran- kenstein from these earlier narratives is that the life conferred on the figure is generated through technical instruments and scientific procedures" (2002:30). In medical research focused on Hybrid Brain-Machine Interfaces to enable paralyzed patients to control computer cursors and interfaces through their brain waves, neurobiologist Miguel Nicholelis has developed neural implants, which he has tested by insertion into animal brains. In a series of experiments, an owl monkey known as Belle transmitted neural signals to a robot that trans- lated the data in real time to imitate the monkey's arm movements. In com- plementary research at Northwestern University in Evanston, the living brain of a lamprey, an eel-like fish, was suspended in salt water and connected to a robot. The brain activated the robot's movements toward light sources, mir- roring its behavior in its natural habitat. Marie O'Mahony observes that "as an</page><page sequence="20">34 Steve Dixon 6. &amp; 7.

Within feminist techo-theory, a number of writers have promoted the image of the patriarchal vampire as central to the convergence of machines and humans (Stone 1996, Haraway 1997, Kember 1998). For Sarah Kember, the vampire represents the unconscious masculinist fear and desire for the monstrous female other; vampirism: is the irrational monster myth which is (the stake) at the heart of the supposedly rational convergence of biological and computer sciences. [...T]he myth of the vampire exposes the unconscious investments in making biology and technology converge and creating the technological organism. (1998:134) The vampire acts as a metaphor for "the kind of transformation in knowledge, power and subjectivity which Western rationalist culture articulates only as horror and monstrosity" (9).

He dances with industrial robots and activates video and animated sequences of Ulysses' epic journey, directly controlling all the scenic elements via an array of finger, arm, and body sensors attached by an umbilical cable to an offstage computer. Four robots share the stage: a metal trashcan drum beats out insistent rhythms with its mechanical drumstick arms, and three other industrial robots jerk and lurch, emitting synthesized sounds and musical phrases in response to Roca's movement signals. Roca coaxes and goads the machines like a psy- chotic street fighter egging on his opponents, and they respond sonically and kinetically to his violent and taunting "come and have a go" gesticulations. It is a cybernetic dance of stimulus-response feedback communication, but also a type of machismo status game where Roca asserts his cyborg-Ubermensch as the all-powerful master conductor, the one in control. Roca's kinetic signals activate the imagery on the approximately 20 x I5 foot screen behind him. He controls panning camera effects across beautifully designed and rendered computer graphic landscapes and oceans by rocking on his feet and gesturing with his arms, to create the effect of Ulysses' journey. His messianic control is highlighted as he raises and lowers his arms to prompt graphical planets to ascend and descend, and shakes his body to distort, mutate or explode animated faces, landscapes, and buildings. Playing both the Homer narrator onstage and the Ulysses protagonist onscreen, he travels over land and</page><page sequence="23">Metal Performance 37 (using swimming movements) graphical oceans beset by tornadoes. The ani- mations, designed by Roca and Paco Corachan, are striking, often hyperreal computer collages, montaging still photographs and video imagery of charac- ters with animations and computer graphic backgrounds. A brass bedstead with a photographic image of Roca's yellow, naked Ulysses on board moves like a ship through the Japanese print-like animated waves, as distant cartoon volcanoes erupt. He travels past an animation of Bruegel's painting of the Tower of Babel, and past Circe's theranthropes: composite graphical images of animals on all fours, with the photo-realistic faces of men.6 The screen imagery comes fast and furious. Stunning black-and-white car- toons depict cosmic explosions and psychedelic apocalypses, and a stick-figure horse gives birth to six dancing, human children. The land of the Sirens is a computer animated island landscape composed entirely of disembodied breasts, their nipples sprouting milk. In the blackness of outer space, Roca's videated disembodied head looms, God-like, surrounded by a graphic cloud- like halo, with white typhoons of steam spraying out of his ears. He spits a white, milky liquid. The heads of other performers, smaller but similarly ha- loed and spitting milk, buzz around the central image like celestial flies. In Afasia, Roca exerts total control over his symphonic performance envi- ronment like a demonic master-composer and conductor, gesturally activating the robots and screen imagery. By contrast, in Epizoo (1994), the metal tech- nology controls him, with audience members using touch-screen computers to activate robotic manipulations of his body. Roca stands on a revolving turn- table dressed only in a G-string, with pneumatic metal moulds and hook de- vices attached to his head and body, which pump up and down against his buttocks and chest, wiggle his ears, and pull his mouth and nostrils open and shut. The audience's interactive computer screens show composite photo- graphic and graphical images of Roca's naked body, which are also relayed on a projection screen behind the live Roca onstage. Roca's screen body is out- lined in black and set against vibrantly colored graphical backgrounds, recal- ling the Day-Glo figure paintings of British artists Gilbert and George. As spectators press different parts of the computer body, the screen image mu- tates: his buttocks become huge and inflated, and eggs are laid from the anus which turn into human heads; his penis changes to a female pudenda, and his male chest gives way to round, pink breasts. Cartoon knives stab, hammers hit, and fists punch the buttocks and head, while pincers and pliers tweak the nip- ples. The performance presents a literal and savage machinization of the help- less, dehumanized body and illustrates how humans can use technology to electronically torture others at a distance. But although on one level disturb- ing, Epizoo is also camp: parodying the sexually fetishized conjunction of hard metal and soft flesh in a humorous floorshow of bouncing buttocks and pec- torals, violently wiggling ears, and a darting, licentious tongue. In both Epizoo and Afasia, Roca's work is camp. But how does Roca's per- formative persona with its high levels of testosteroned machismo jibe with Richard Dyer's statement that "camp is not masculine. By definition, camping about is not butch" ([1977] 1999:1 Io)? The answer lies in Roca's physical per- formance: its irony, sexual ambivalence, and high-camp gestural theatrics. Al- though Roca performs the cyborg in Afasia as a butch "muscle-man," like numerous wrestlers of America's World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), it is exaggerated to the degree of camp self-parody. Roca's costume beneath the metal appendages, a tight-fitting, all-in-one undergarment, cut high to the crotch, also echoes the WWE wrestlers' macho-camp look. There is deep irony in his expansive, often obscene, and sometimes ridiculous and physical gestures. In Afasia, Roca's masculinized movements at times reach Neander-</page><page sequence="24">38 Steve Dixon 1o.

At times he stands still as though bored, casually rocking his pelvis and swinging his arms limply from side to side, like a female disco dancer. In Epizoo, as his computer screen figure transforms from male to female, the face offers a camp sign of surprise with wide eyes and an exaggerated kiss-like purse of the lips, while onstage Roca wiggles his G-stringed buttocks at the audience, like a fe- male striptease artist. While Dyer argues that camp is not butch, he also recognizes that camp is not the exclusive domain of gay culture, reflecting that "camp is so beguiling that it has been adopted by many straights these days" (I 15). A number of the most popular presenters of current British light-entertainment television se- ries attest to this notion, including the flamboyant David Dickinson who fronts an antiques program, and Laurence Llewelyn Bowen, a presenter of a popular television series on domestic interior design. Bowen, a straight man who dresses and performs like a contemporary version of a stylish I7th- century fop, epitomizes the ironic wit and postmodern laissez-faire of straight camp. He regularly comments affectionately on the aesthetics of camp as he garishly transforms people's houses in the BBC's Changing Rooms series, and in one program in 2003 offered his own concise definition: "If it's too much, it's camp." Guillermo G6mez-Pefia similarly performs a machismo cyborg, but with a</page><page sequence="25">Metal Performance 39 knowing and conscious sense of camp that is in line with George Piggford's definition of camp as "behaviour that mocks and ironizes gender norms" ([1997] 1999:283-84). In performances such as The Museum of Fetishized Iden- tity (2000), G6mez-Pefia mocks and ironizes notions of gender and of cyborg- ism. The cyborgic armplate he wears is not metal, but silver-painted plastic. It signifies the pastiche superman, the pretend cyborg. His "metallic" arm is an ironic tattoo: a satirical sign rather than an evolutionary prosthesis. His cyborg is merely a new form of "alien," another sociopolitical outsider, a new victim of the reactionary postcolonial capitalism that G6mez-Pefia has critiqued throughout his work. As an evolutionary vision, G6mez-Pefia's "ethno-cyborg" is a deeply mocking and ironic one: a corseted transvestite who lives in a wheelchair and smokes too many Marlboros. His El Mexterminator persona, an "illegal bor- der crosser [...with] Jalapefio phallus &amp; robotic bleeding heart" (G6mez-Pefia 2000:44), performs the preening narcissism of the cyborg, applying beauty products and slowly brushing his hair. His collaborator Roberto Sifuentes's CyberVato persona explores the technological sadomasochism of meat and metal symbiosis. He injects his tongue with a horse syringe, self-flagellates, and strangles himself with cords, which he then binds in tight coils around his head, contorting his face grotesquely. The metallic metaphors here are sar- donic representations of cyborgic vanity and machinic pain. G6mez-Pefia's pill-popping, wheelchaired El Mexterminator character embodies Baudril- 11.

(Photos by Steve Dixon)</page><page sequence="26">40 Steve Dixon lard's conception of the docile technologized subject as "a spastic, probably with a cerebral handicap too" (Baudrillard 1987:18). This pessimistic view of the cyborg asserts G6mez-Pefia's view that high technology is "intrinsically dehumanizing" and that a critique of technology overlaps with a critique of capitalism (2ooo:174). G6mez-Pefia's camp, cruel, and humorous depiction of the cyborg reflects the recent reevaluation of the technological "revolution" following its failed projects and time frames. Despite the hyperbolic rhetoric of the I98os and '9os, AI research has plateaued amid myriad complications, the dotcom boom went bust, and domestic internet users cannot yet even access high-quality video let alone achieve bodily transcendence. Other performance artists have similarly used humor to mock the claims of the supposed "exponential" de- velopments in technology: Roca's first action in Afasia is an ironic flick of a large, distinctly analogue on-off switch on the front of his cyborg suit. In Toni Dove's interactive installation, Artificial Changelings (1998), a voiceover tells how the futuristic cyborg Lileth "reached in back of the apparatus that wrapped around her body like recycled mutated paniers and tugged on the recycled fishnet bustle. 'This thing is so clunky.' " In The Museum of Fetishized Identity, the metallic cyborg signifiers coexist with diverse clashing signs: crucified skeletons; dead chickens; video projec- tions; Mexican flags; Native American headdresses; "sacred" objects from primitive cultures; and artifacts from an obsessionally commodified and kitsch contemporary America. The vivid, beautifully staged dioramas bathed in shafts of colored light are exquisite; sumptuously manifesting camp's sense of "semiotic excess [...] and gratuitousness of reference" (Cleto 1999:3, original italics). The hypnotic rave music, mock-American Indian dancing, a naked green butoh "alien" (Juan Ybarra), and the visual luxuriance of the smoke- machine bathed Blade Runner-in-Tijuana mise-en-scene present an expres- sion of playful and deviant camp, corresponding to what Cleto describes as: a convergence between the camp scene and Bakhtinian carnivalesque, for the two share hierarchy inversion, mocking paradoxicality, sexual punning and innuendos and-most significantly-a complex and mul- tilayered power relationship between the dominant and the subordinate (or deviant), and finally the whole problem of how far a "licensed" re- lease can effectively be transgressive or subversive. (32) Conclusion Metal performance frequently highlights a postmodern concern to return to nature and the animal, and often celebrates an eroticized sexuality of metal, with "them fuckin' robots" both fucking (signaling the humanization of ma- chines) and being fucked (signifying the machinization of humans). Metal per- formances exalt in the conjunction of the hard and the soft; the natural and the technological; the metal and the meat. They are also characterized by funda- mental tensions and contradictions that also exist within camp, combining "the polarities of seriousness and play, cynicism and affection, (self)mockery and (self)celebration" (Cleto 1999:25). Both camp and metal performance share the notion of exclusiveness, what Sontag calls "esoteric-something of a private code, a badge of identity even" ([I964] 1999:53). Within queer theory, the appreciation and celebration of camp is articulated as a defining exclusivity of taste and sensibility working outside and against the mainstream. In the same way, the tastes and sensibilities of metal-culture pro- ponents-metal performers, body-piercers, techno-theorists, and would-be</page><page sequence="27">Metal Performance 41 cyborgs-define a similar exclusiveness of aesthetic expression and ideologi- cal transgression. Like camp, its delicious nonconformity relies upon its very difference from the status quo: it "is only recognisable as a deviation from an implied norm, and without that norm it would cease to exist, it would lack definition" (Britton [1978] 1999:138). Metal performance operates with the theatrically of camp in exploring what Andrew Britton describes as "the thrill of 'something wrong' " (141). In a rapidly evolving technological age, despite its supposed deviance and peculiarity, metal performance already seems strangely familiar. This too it shares with camp, the key to which, according to Mark Booth, "lies in reconciling its essential marginality with its evident ubiquity" ([1983] 1999:66). Finally, metal performance relates to the profound fears as well as the camp fascinations of the humanization of machines and the dehumanization/mach- inization of humans. Jay Bolter argues that "by making a machine think like a man, man re-creates himself, defines himself, as a machine" (1990:13) and Hugo de Garis (2001) has predicted that human evolution will ultimately lead to what he terms "Gigadeath." Coition with and immersion and transforma- tion into metal reaches its logical conclusion with Hans Moravec's projec- tion-mentioned above-that by 2050 it will be possible to transfer one's entire consciousness into a machine. Running parallel to such predictions and visions of the machinization of humans are developments in robotics and Ar- tificial Intelligence, which herald the advanced humanization of machines. Roboticist Rodney A. Brooks holds that humans have already begun an irre- versible evolutionary process through the use of bodily technological prosthe- ses, and that the simultaneous emergence of the intelligent robot will lead to a situation whereby: As these robots get smarter, some people will worry about what will happen when they get really smart. Will they decide that we humans are useless and stupid and take over the world from us? I have recently come to realize that this will never happen. Because there won't be any of us (people) for them (pure robots) to take over from. (2002:ix) The shiny new bodies and mythic metamorphoses enacted in metallic per- formance art celebrate but also forewarn of the gradual disappearance of the human body. Intelligent and conscious machines in the future may take their origin from humans, but they may equally originate from other sentient ma- chines. George Dyson suggests that: "In the game of life and evolution there are three players at the table: human beings, nature and machines. I am firmly on the side of nature. But nature, I suspect, is on the side of the machines" (in Levery 2001:152). In appreciating the camp excesses of metal performance, we might therefore reflect, as Britton observes in relation to gay camp, that it may signify only "a kind of anaesthetic, allowing one to remain inside oppressive relations while enjoying the illusory confidence that one is flouting them" ([1978] 1999:13 8). Notes i. In an essay about his work, "Art at the Biological Frontier" (1999) Eduardo Kac suggests A-Positive: probes the delicate relationship between the human body and emerging new breeds of hybrid machines that incorporate biological elements and [...] meta- bolic functions. [...] This work proposes that emerging forms of human/ma- chine interface penetrate the sacred boundaries of the flesh, with profound</page><page sequence="28">42 Steve Dixon cultural and philosophical implications. A-Positive draws attention to the con- dition of the human body in the new context in which biology meets computer science and robotics. (I999:91-92) 2. The Digital Performance Archive, codirected by the author and Barry Smith, docu- ments and analyzes performance activities that incorporate computer technologies. See &lt;http://art.ntu.ac.uk/dpa&gt;. 3. Freud's discussion of automata includes reference to E.T.A. Hoffman's dancing doll Olympia ([i 817] 1982). In 19th-century literature, the woman-machine became a locus of eroticized male fantasy, most notably with Hoffman's Olympia and Jean Villiers de l'Isle-Adam's creation, Hadalay. The mechanical doll Olympia features prominently in the first act of Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann (1881) and was played by Moira Shearer in the film version directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger in 1951. Olympia's name was also taken as the title for Petra Kuppers's performance company The Olimpias (using the German spelling). Kuppers's art foregrounds metal in relation to disability, with works such as Geometries (2000) highlighting the aesthetic beauty and graceful kinetic patterns of wheelchairs, which are gently and erotically caressed. 4. Afasia is a condition where cerebral disturbance leads to a loss of speech. In the perfor- mance, Roca does not use language but instead makes use of growls, shouts, and screams. Roca's website describes Afasia as "a reflection on the unstoppable encroach- ment of the image as opposed to written language in our culture, and attempts to give an example of the consequences of this situation" (Roca 1999). 5. Marcel-li Antfinez Roca was one of the founders of the seminal Spanish performance group La Fura Dels Baus, and left the company in 1990. 6. In a later sequence, shot on video, one of these creatures, now played by a human per- former with large false ears, is ritually sacrificed by Roca, who slashes its throat. Other theranthropic images include the sea-nymph Calypso as a kitsch Barbie doll with a mer- maid tail. References Baudrillard, Jean 1987 "Le Xerox et l'infini." Traverses 44/45 (September): 18-22.
