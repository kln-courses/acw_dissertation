<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHARLES HARTSHORNE Some Theological Mistakes and Their Effects on Modern Literature What I mean by theological mistakes will emerge in this essay and is more extensively discussed in my book Omnipotence (1984). Theological mis takes are not easily distinguished from mistakes by philosophers. Most philosophers have indulged in theologizing or in criticisms of theology; and the important theologians have mostly been philosophers as well. By literature I mean poems and novels or other works of fiction. A poet or novelist deals mostly with more concrete topics than a philosopher. Theology, so far as it deals simply with the question of the existence and essential nature of deity, is on the same abstract level as philosophy, or as that part of philosophy called metaphysics. Poets and fiction writers, so far as they or their characters have religious concerns, or concerns with a metaphysical aspect, often express or imply philosophical beliefs. It is such beliefs as expressed in literature that I wish to discuss. Since we are dealing with abstract aspects of otherwise largely concrete writings, let us look briefly at the human condition in its concreteness. An animal species, unique on this planet in its great symbolizing power, has spread over the surface of the planet as has no other species. More and more, the use of this symbolic power for scientific inquiry and technological applications of resulting discoveries is changing our environments and our ways of thinking about ourselves and our universe. Yet pre-scientific ways of thinking are also widely influential. Philosophy and theology are the mediators between science and religious beliefs, meaning by such beliefs those implicit in our fundamental goals or ideals.

There are basic reasons why philosophers and, therefore, theologians are likely to make mistakes. First, to be an animal, even though a human animal, means the following. An animal feels itself at the center of the cosmos, or at least it feels its group at the center. If not egocentric it is group-centric. We all incline to be either of the me or the us generation. Perhaps it is better if it is us rather than me; still, group conceit issuing in will to group dominance can be our deadliest danger. It also inclines us to underestimate the nonhuman creatures. Second, an animal feels itself subject to momentum coming from the past and threatened by dangers looming in the future. With the highest animals the anticipated future may be far ahead and include the individual's own eventual death. Several philosophical questions arise from the foregoing. One of these is, How far does the momentum coming from the past determine what hap pens? This is the problem of causality and freedom. Long ago a few thinkers declared that conditions in the past strictly determine what happens now. In that sense there is, for such thinkers, no freedom. What we say we decide was in fact decided, or at least determined, settled, long ago. That we could not have done otherwise will obtain, whatever we do. Some philosophers claim that this still leaves us all the freedom we need, or at any rate all we can have. So far as we do what we wish or will to do, without interference by others or control by habits that we would like to overcome, we are free. Freedom is simply voluntariness. This is the deterministic view of freedom. It is a definite abstract theory, and an extreme one. Like all extremes it has an opposite, which is that, whatever has already happened, anything conceivable could happen next. No animal can live by that notion. Nevertheless, to some minds in love with simplicity, it seems that we must choose between a pragmatically hopeless notion of chaos, "anything may happen, regardless of what has already occurred," and the opposite ex treme, "what has already occurred entirely predetermines what happens next or is now done." In strict logic there is no need to limit the options for belief to the two extremes just stated. Yet early modern science, like some ancient Greek science and the Stoic philosophers, adopted the deterministic extreme. Some modern theologians and many modern philosophers, with medieval precedents, applied the scheme even to human behavior. Spinoza and</page><page sequence="3">THEOLOGICAL MISTAKES AND MODERN LITERATURE 57 Jonathan Edwards are classical cases, but Hume and Kant also fell into the trap of seeing nothing between determinism and sheer chaos. I say that the adoption of determinism, however it may for some cen turies have helped science, was for philosophy and religion a definite mistake, a lapse from rational method. That one extreme, "the past has no influence on the present/' is obviously untenable does nothing to justify adopting the opposite extreme, "the past settles everything." Yet where in the literature of the subject was any other and more valid argument given for unqualified determinism? Some transparent special pleading is all that I at least find. It is time to consider a literary example of determinism. I take the following from one of the great satirists of all time, Thomas Love Peacock.1 In Headlong Hall, Mr. Escot has saved Mr. Cranium, the phrenologist, from drowning. Some time later Squire Headlong tries to settle a dispute be tween Escot and Cranium by asking the latter, "Who fished you out of the water?" "What is that to the purpose?" asks Mr. Cranium. "The whole process of the action was mechanical and necessary. The applica tion of the poker necessitated the ignition of the powder: the ignition necessitated the explosion: the explosion necessitated my sudden fright, which necessitated my sudden jump, which, from a necessity equally powerful, was in a curvilinear ascent: the descent, being in a corresponding curve ... I was, by the necessity of gravitation, attracted, first, through the ivy, and secondly through the hazel, and thirdly through the ash, into the water beneath. The motive or impulse thus adhibited in the person of a drowning man, was as powerful on his [Escot's] material compages as the force of gravitation on mine; and he could no more help jumping into the water than I could help falling into it." "All perfectly true," said Squire Headlong, "and, on the same principle, you make no distinction between the man who knocks you down and him who picks you up." "I make this distinction," said Mr. Cranium, "that I avoid the former as a machine containing a peculiar catabillitive quality, which I have found to be not consentaneous to my mode of pleasurable existence; but I attach no moral merit or demerit to either of them . . . seeing that they are equally creatures of neces</page><page sequence="4">58 CHARLES HARTSHORNE sity. ... I no more blame or praise a man for what is called vice or virtue, than I tax a tuft of hemlock with malevolence or discover great philanthropy in a field of potatoes. ..." "Yet you destroy the hemlock," said Squire Headlong, "and cultivate the potato. ..." "I do," said Mr. Cranium, "because I know that . . . the potato will tend to preserve . . . my animal republic; and that the hem lock . . . would necessitate a great derangement ... of my cor poreal mechanism." "Very well," said the Squire, "then you are necessitated to like Mr. Escot better than Mr. Panscope?" "That is a nonsequitur," said Mr. Cranium. "Then this is a sequitur," said the Squire: "Your daughter and Mr. Escot are necessitated to like one another; and unless you feel necessitated to adhibit your consent, they will feel necessitated to dispense with it." Mr Cranium fell into a profound reverie. . . . The foregoing passage will be criticized by "soft determinists," who do employ ethical terms. Mr. Cranium is what is now called a "hard determi nist." I hold that both are making essentially the same mistake about causality, the truth being that determinism makes neither ethical nor unethical sense. It tells us nothing upon which we can act. Absolute predictability, given absolute knowledge of the past, is irrelevant to our problems since only God could have absolute knowledge. And many theologians now think that divine knowledge of the past would still leave the future open for God since God knows that creatures have freedom. As Lequier said, God "waits to see" what creatures do. Karl Popper, perhaps the greatest living philosopher of science, suggests that God, supposing the divine existence, would find a world with open future vastly more interest ing than one whose future was already settled.2 The contention of soft determinists that the doctrine does no harm to our ethical conceptions or our essential values is not in agreement with the way many great poets and fiction writers have viewed the matter. I do not think these writers have been as stupid as soft determinism implies. I have in mind Thomas Hardy, Robinson Jeffers, Robert Frost, Ambrose Bierce, and Mark Twain. All of these, with the possible exception of Frost, were determinists. (If Frost was not, he did not say so.) Not one of these writers, in my opinion, gave us a livable philosophy of life. Yet all wrote wonderful</page><page sequence="5">THEOLOGICAL MISTAKES AND MODERN LITERATURE 59 literature. I incline to include also in this list Wallace Stevens, who, in one passage, seems to imply determinism. He gives us neither a religion nor (here I agree with an essay whose author I have forgotten) a viable substitute for a religion. The case of Hardy is well known. His determinism leads him to a distorted view of life and a satirical metaphor of God as President of the Immortals who mismanages the world. That Jeffers was definitely committed to determinism is as clear as genius could make it. In "Meditation on Saviors," we read: "The mountain ahead of the world is not forming but fixed." Whatever happens is subject to "the iron consistency."3 And Jeffers is one of the few great recent poets with a clearly religious belief. The poem "Triad" ends with: "God, who is very beautiful, but hardly a friend of humanity." In "Self-criticism" we find: "If only you could sing / That God is love." And the reply is: "I can tell lies in prose." So the God of Jeffers does not love us; neither, it seems, does Jeffers. His misanthropy is grandiose. Of course, one cannot consistently live such a doctrine. It is clear that determinism is a chief source of this grim theology. In "At The Birth of an Age," The Hanged God declares, "I torture myself to discover myself." In "Meditation on Saviors," we read: "He brays humanity / to bring the savior." Life?including divine life, Jeffers tell us?without conflict and suffering is impossible, or would be hopelessly lacking in intensity. Since there is no freedom in the proper sense of creaturely determination of what is left undetermined by deity, it must be divine will that selects our sufferings and our joys. God is the supreme sadist?but also masochist, for our sufferings become elements in the intensity of the divine life. It seems that even a child (but not some theologians and philosophers) could see the alternative: God does not, and logically could not, simply determine what creatures do. To be is to act, to determine what otherwise is not fully determinate. If we exist, and not God alone, then we and not God decide some aspects of our lives. I have found only one poet who makes it sun-clear that he believes in human as well as divine freedom. This is Sidney Lanier. To the idea that if he writes a poem praising God it is really God who determines the content of the poem, he replies, "It is not true, it is not true," and insists that he, "and not another, God nor man," makes the poem. See Individuality, a philosophical title indeed.4 The poem also raises the question, If an inanimate object, say a cloud sending rain and lightning, does harm, is the object to be blamed for the damage? He replies in the negative, saying of his cloud, "There is no thee." The cloud is not an individual, an active being.</page><page sequence="6">60 CHARLES HARTSHORNE What clouds do, he seems to think, is really divine action, the reasons for which we cannot penetrate. How close yet how far from the open secret! The poem's title suggests that we must suppose either that the nonhuman, inanimate world does not consist of individuals (what then?) or that, since a cloud is not an individ ual, it must be a group, an assemblage of individuals, perhaps atoms or molecules. If individuals are free, then atoms or molecules have some freedom. (Epicurus and Lucretius thought so long ago, but did not con vince the world.) Even God, then, does not fully determine what they or their assemblages bring about. Moreover, if human beings and other animals are individuals acting individually (how else?), then the conjunc tion of human behavior with the lightning or rain is partly a matter of chance intersections of free creaturely volitions, not of divine volitions alone. Lanier leaves his problem in the middle, but he makes the right start. To be as an individual is to act individually, not fully determined by anything else, divine or otherwise. What one must do is generalize this for creatures as such, so far as they are individuals rather than mere collectives. To work this into an impressive cosmology has never been possible until quite recently. Statistical laws of gases first, then quantum theory, have shown that the religious alternative to absolute order need not be absolute chaos, but may be freedom, individual creativity, sufficiently influenced by a divine vision of cosmic order to make what happens partially predictable, but not wholly so even for God. A group of philosophers, Charles Peirce, Henri Bergson, William James, A. N. Whitehead, Karl Popper, and others in Germany, France, and Italy, have worked on such a philosophy, and many physicists now believe that determinism had best be given up or qualified so that freedom in the radical sense is not excluded. Frost seemed to think that the problem of religion was how to reconcile mercy and justice in an idea of God. But he also seemed to think that God could only be conceived as determining the details of events in the world. At least, he never takes up the question of how divine action leaves any genuine scope for creaturely decision or determination. If justice means appropriate rewarding and punishing, how is this to be brought about? Either the creatures decide nothing of what happens to themselves and others, or God does not decide everything that happens. In the former case, does the idea of deciding make sense? (What could we mean by deciding if another power decides all?) In the latter case, how can our</page><page sequence="7">THEOLOGICAL MISTAKES AND MODERN LITERATURE 61 rewards and punishments, our joys or sufferings, be dealt out precisely by deity? It seems obvious that it is other creatures that help or harm us. Wordsworth had a theistic view, but he never discusses the relation of freedom and causality. He felt God in everything but cannot help us much to think out what this means in conceptual terms. He did feel that the agents in nature must have their own feelings. By similar arguments they must have their own freedom. Epicurus was opposite to Wordsworth. He was confident that he had freedom and so did atoms; but his materialism prevented him from making the other parallel inference. We know our selves and others as individuals in terms of feeling as well as of freedom. Hence whatever is individual in nature must have both aspects. Putting Epicurus and Wordsworth together in their positive views, one has what is needed. If we can (vaguely) imagine freedom different enough from human freedom to apply to atoms, why can we not also imagine feeling different enough from ours to apply to them? Unimaginative persons will hardly accomplish either generalization. A Peirce or Whitehead can do both. I have given the argument for the Wordsworthian procedure in a previous article.5 Whatever his limitations, I regard Frost as the greatest Anglo-American poet of this century (almost the very words of T. S. Eliot about him).6 Frost does give us some help regarding religious problems. To see this we need to return to the fact that we are the animals that foresee the inevitability of our eventually dying. This means that we either renounce any long-run permanence for our achievements or adopt some metaphysical belief. What is called social immortality will not do; for no empirical observations can establish that our species is immortal, and, if possible, still less that what we do well will always have a good influence on posterity. For this reason alone, though it is far from the only reason, I hold with Bergson that our species, no matter how its science progresses, will always need some metaphysical belief. There are two principal metaphysical options. We may suppose that death is not the end of a person's career, which goes on forever to additional experiences in some supernatural form, or in reincarnation in a natural form. In the posthumous parts of our careers we may hope to reap perma nent results for ourselves from our earthly activities. The other option is to believe in God, not as the means to our own posthumous careers, but as the one who will everlastingly possess whatever beauty of experience we and other creatures have enjoyed or helped others to enjoy. This is Whitehead's</page><page sequence="8">62 CHARLES HARTSHORNE "immortality of the past" in "the Consequent Nature of God." God is taken as the ultimate heir of our achievements, the ultimate posterity whose permanence is guaranteed, or whose power of survival is invincible. Frost does not give us the idea of God just referred to, but he does take a stand against its chief alternative, the idea of posthumous human careers. "Earth's the right place for love /1 don't know where it's likely to go better" ("Birches," in The Mountain Interval). This is only one of several ways in which he makes clear that he believes in no heaven where we will "go up ... to live" ("A Steeple on the House," in A Spire and Belfry). On the negative side he supports the Whiteheadian solution that in the main is also mine. The positive side he at least leaves open. I hold this to be no mean service. Otherworldliness in my view makes us rivals to God in the infinity of our future careers. It also distracts us from our real problems, which are to live well for self and others and finally for God while we live on earth, or at least in this solar system. In another way Frost is helpful to a philosopher. He knows that the power of human thinking depends on analogies, or what he calls meta phors. He knows also that "every metaphor breaks down somewhere." Consider the idea of God. It is an analogy or partial similarity between something primordial, everlasting, cosmically efficacious, and infallibly wise and good and a human or high-level animal individual that is not primordial, not everlasting (at least, not obviously so), only very locally efficacious, and fallible in wisdom and goodness. Thus God is to us as ideal ruler is to ruled, leader to led, parent (not, I implore you, merely father) to child. This interpersonal analogy, or metaphor, is the one most writers have had in mind, and this includes most poets. The analogy breaks down in some ways rather badly. Unless we have another one, strong or clear where this one is weak or unclear, we are in trouble. There is another analogy, going back to Plato, than whom no greater philosopher is known. It is the soul-body analogy. We as conscious subjects are in some sense or degree rulers in our psycho-physiological systems. This is a more intimate relation by far than that of child to parent (especially male parent!). When Whitehead refers to God as "the fellow sufferer who understands," he fails to note that this applies to the relation one has to one's bodily cells. We feel their healthy functioning as our good and suffer their injuries as our bad. We even seem to feel their feelings. Consider physical pains and pleasures. Nothing in these experiences seems to con flict with the idea that there is cellular suffering in the pains and cellular pleasure in the pleasures. How else could we derive suffering and enjoy</page><page sequence="9">THEOLOGICAL MISTAKES AND MODERN LITERATURE 63 ment from cells if they had nothing remotely similar themselves? But we can partly understand cells, which can scarcely understand themselves. I am quite unconvinced that the significance of the cellular constitution of our bodies, unknown to Plato and Aristotle, has yet dawned on most philosophers or theologians. Alas, even Whitehead scorns Plato's analogy, apparently because of the way it was used in Neoplatonism. He overlooks here the possibility that Plato is, in important ways, including this one, wiser than most of the platonists. He also overlooks the fact that as Plato puts the analogy in the Timaeus it is not inconsistent with the doctrine of the Consequent Nature of God. It also makes more sense with modern than with ancient physiology. If Whitehead missed the point here, following in this mistake most of his predecessors in philosophical theology, why should not Frost miss it also? And what did Frost think about freedom and causality? Obviously, we do not completely determine our cells' behavior, and it is bad philosophy to suppose that they completely determine ours. Some neurophysiologists reject this assumption.7 So far I have mentioned only one writer of fiction as on the right side of a metaphysical issue?Peacock. I wish now to consider two others who at least do not say wrong things on the subject. Jane Austen and Anthony Trollope are among the superb geniuses of the novel. They both, especially Trollope, have a good deal to say about clergymen but rather carefully avoid metaphysical problems about God. They do not quarrel with tradi tional ideas about heaven or hell, but their work can be taken to support the proposition that these ideas are of little relevance. Neither seems to feel that their characters are living for the sake of avoiding hell and getting to heaven, or getting their friends there either. They seem to live for the sake of what Austen regards as rational happiness on earth. Trollope seems to me essentially the same in this, even though he is more concerned with the clergy. The notion that people must be threatened with everlasting punish ment or attracted by visions of everlasting bliss, a disgusting doctrine at best, as Berdyaev says, gets no impressive support from either of these wonderfully penetrating observers of human affairs. Is it any different with Fielding, Thackeray, Peacock, Dickens? It remains a serious question whether or not rational happiness can flourish without something like the belief in God or in something more permanent and relevant to the meaning of our lives than empirical science can provide us with. The Japanese, it seems clear, though apparently without an explicitly theistic religion, live with remarkable freedom from the vicious violence that disfigures many Western societies (alas, including</page><page sequence="10">64 CHARLES HARTSHORNE our own). Most Japanese lack a definite idea of God. However, Japanese Buddhism is not a merely empirical doctrine, nor is Shinto; in both there are metaphysical overtones. It is seldom entirely clear that Buddha is or was merely a human animal. The scholar Suzuki said that he was not sure that Buddhism was nontheistic. Wallace Stevens said that he had substituted man for God. He seems to have an idealized view of the essence of humanity, something like Feuer bach's virtual deification of our species. This is also the Marxist approach. Is it enough? The problem of mortality is still there. What eventually do we accomplish or achieve? This was William James's question. Whitehead, not James or Stevens, has clearly answered it. So far we lack the poet who does justice to this answer, as Dante did to the other religious solution. I wish to consider three more literary figures, all poets, whatever else they may have been. One of these, Edgar Allan Poe, famous as a poet and writer of fiction, also wrote a long essay called Eureka, in which he stated his religious beliefs. He called it "a poem," although it is entirely in prose. It is scarcely philosophical as philosophers go at their work. Nor are philosophers or theologians the writers who are referred to or cited. Rather they are natural scientists, especially astronomers. However, something is said about God, and a solution of the problem of our mortality is implied. Poe insists that we are not unequal to God and suggests that it is inappropri ate to worship God as essentially superior to us; indeed, in a sense that is left vague, we seem to be God. So, somehow, we are immortal. Is this a livable philosophy or theology? Poor Poe, he had tragic misfortunes and was unable to control his alcoholism. A genius, yes indeed; but a wise man? If Poe rejected determinism?unlikely since it was the belief of most scientists at the time?he did not, I think, say so. As the reader knows, my belief is that determinism is mistaken in principle, and that the mistake is not harmless in its effects on life and literature. Jeffers was wrong to accept it, and Lanier right to repudiate it. In ignoring the problem, Frost, Stevens, and Poe limited their resources. I have two more poets in mind, both also remarkable in other ways. These are Edward Fitzgerald, translator from the Persian, and Omar Khay yam, the Persian original. In many ways the relationship of these two men of genius is startlingly unique. Omar was not a self-proclaimed poet but a scientist of distinction, in an Islamic country, who circulated his poems among friends. A modern Islamic scholar has shown that the skeptical philosophy for which the poem in Fitzgerald's version (The Rubdiydt of Omar Khayyam) is so famous is essentially the philosophy of the original.8</page><page sequence="11">THEOLOGICAL MISTAKES AND MODERN LITERATURE 65 What is harder to ascertain is how the two writers compare, not as philosophers but as poets. Frost's trenchant dictum, "poetry is what gets lost in translation," here receives its most notable apparent refutation. For, of middle-length poems, what other in English is more haunting, more magical than Fitzgerald's? Perhaps Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mari ner," but what else? Perhaps a few more. Are the translated and the original Persian poem two equally good but quite different creations? My guess is that the translation is even more poetical than the original, but certainly different poetically. Nothing is clearer than that the ground of the skepticism is the baldly proclaimed theological determinism. Omar himself: Today is nothing but a make-believe; Tomorrow all will be as it was planned. It's all arranged . . . Tomorrow's plans were settled yesterday. Fitzgerald: With earth's first day they did the last man knead, And there of the last harvest sowed the seed: And the first morning of creation wrote What the last dawn of reckoning shall read. Other verses in both versions make the same point. Omar's "We are the pawns and Heaven is the player" is far from his only other variation on the theme, and the same can be said about Fitzgerald's "Impotent pieces of the Game He plays." Frost's equation of poetry with the untranslatable fits highly philosophical poetry less well perhaps than it does some other forms of poetry. Still, one at home in medieval Persian and also in modern English would have two quite distinct aesthetic experiences in reading or listening to the two poems. However, two classes of things would be common to the two experiences?the images (lion, lizard, wild ass, bub bles that burst, wine, and many others) and certain abstract ideas (death, birth, life, individual, God, sin, responsibility, and freedom, or rather the lack of it). And the same sense of meaninglessness, assuming theological determinism. In my opinion, the medieval type of theism, all too similar in the Islamic and Christian versions, scarcely deserved to survive the ridicule to which Omar and, many centuries later, Fitzgerald subjected it.</page><page sequence="12">66 CHARLES HARTSHORNE What the two poets show is how, from theological catastrophe, art can wring human value, not ethical or positive religious value, but aesthetic value?not goodness or wisdom, but beauty. For life as a whole, however, goodness and wisdom are also needed, even by poets as well as their readers. Fortunately, there are wise and good poets as well as wise and good writers of fiction. Two American writers, born twenty-six and thirty-three years after Fitzgerald's birth in 1809, reacted to the type of theism made fun of by Omar and his English imitator and reached a similar conclusion. These were Ambrose Bierce and Mark Twain (Samuel L. Clemens). Unlike Omar, the Americans, especially Bierce, almost made careers by exploiting the absurdity to which such a theism seems to reduce life and the universe. They were existentialists before Sartre! Omar had something that these writers of fiction, especially Clemens, largely lacked even secondhand acquaintance with: a disciplined and informed intellectual life of scientific and philosophical inquiry. Omar was highly educated by the world stan dards of his time. Bierce and Clemens were not, by the standards of theirs. True, many of those for whom they chiefly wrote were not much better- or as well-off. The postwar nineteenth-century life in this country, at least in the Western part of it in which the two spent much of their lives, was only beginning to pass beyond the crudities of the pioneer days. One difference between Bierce and Clemens, as Hartley Grattan puts it, was that whereas Bierce was crushed (and embittered) by rejection, Clemens was crushed by acceptance. Born to poverty and a grim Calvinist father (who gave him a library to read in and very little else), Bierce? self-educated, witty, intellectually penetrating, courageous, defiant?en countered many difficulties, including a hopelessly flawed marriage (by whose fault seems to be unknown). He may have died by suicide some where in Mexico. Clemens, in contrast, had a successful career, including a happy marriage into a respected family in a cultured Eastern society with whose religious foundations he had little sympathy but which he did not wish to offend. Bierce suffered from, but also intensely enjoyed (at least in retrospect), participation, as an imaginative, sensitive young man, in the Civil War, which was one of the early examples of the ever-increasing degradation of warfare into the utterly hopeless, wholesale carnage it now threatens to become. Bierce's complete acceptance of strict determinism is made plain in his story "Missing in Action." What happened to the hero?and he is de picted as truly heroic?was, the author says, to the last detail settled ages</page><page sequence="13">THEOLOGICAL MISTAKES AND MODERN LITERATURE 67 ago by "The divine, eternal plan." A Darwinian, Bierce combined the worst aspect of Darwin's thought (his rejection of genuine chance, which is an essential aspect of creaturely freedom) with the worst in the theological tradition. How close to Omar or Fitzgerald is the following from The Devil's Dictionary: "Howe'er your choice may chance to fall / You'll have no hand in it at all"! Note the ironical use of "chance" by a complete mechanistic determinist. I will try to make very clear what troubled these two heirs of the Middle Ages. Countless theologians had committed themselves, either ambigu ously or unambiguously, to the following proposition: "There is a Being who enjoys absolutely free and complete control over all other beings." From this it follows that the other beings have no freedom at all if "free" means able to decide without being completely determined in one's deci sions or actions by another being or set of beings. In short, we are offered absolute freedom in one being and zero freedom in all others. The proposi tion is doubly absurd: absolute freedom is meaningless or contradictory, for it would imply an agent dealing only with itself or mere puppets of itself; and the idea of mere puppet, or agent wholly controlled by another agent and thus with a zero of self-determination, is similarly empty of positive, coherent import. All freedom, and indeed all meaning, is social, involving a plurality of agents influenced, but not wholly determined, by others. Freedom must be shared; it cannot be monopolized. Plato came close to seeing all this, and we know why he could not quite see it all. Being, he said, is activity or power; soul, or whatever thinks, feels, or desires, and the like, is "self-moved" (not wholly determined in its motions or changes by another); souls move, have power over, other souls and also (Plato thought) over what is soulless?inanimate matter. What Plato did not know (but Epicurus shrewdly guessed) was that the idea of absolutely inert, not self-moving matter is an illusion of our sense percep tions, as modern physics has discovered. Atoms, particles, radiation waves, are not inert, and matter consists of them. They need not be soulless, a zero of freedom or a zero of mind. The zero of activity cannot be distinguished from the zero of actuality. Plato must have known, but he grossly understressed, what Aristotle noted: that a soul in knowing anything is influenced by what it knows. This means that no being can both unilaterally influence (not to say fully control or determine) another being and also know it. Hence the traditional pair of terms, omnipotence (as often construed) and omniscience, form a contra diction. That is why Aristotle's supreme soul, his God, knows only self, not</page><page sequence="14">68 CHARLES HARTSHORNE any other. Absolute freedom, as traditionally conceived, defines no deity worth discussion. The only literal truth of this kind of theology is the historical truth that many did hold it, or at best failed to distinguish what they believed from it. William James in his "Dilemma of Determinism" shows admirably clearly that the only way to defend freedom is to admit chance as a genuine though negative aspect of reality. That an action is not fully determined by anything prior to itself, either temporally or logically, has, as its positive bearing, that the act is an addition to the definiteness of reality as it was without this act. In each free act we add something to the definiteness of the universe and to any deity that knows this universe. Determinism would deny this, for deity, knowing the causal antecedents, would know all about their predetermined effects. This is just what causation cannot be if it allows some self-determination. Chance is not the whole of freedom but is its necessary negative aspect, the absence of any fully determining pre condition. The positive aspect is creativity, the form of forms. To be is to create. Each creature is in some degree a creator. No being is zero, and no being is simply absolute or self-sufficient, in freedom. It does not follow that no being can be divine. Although divine freedom is not in every respect unlimited power, it is power whose only "limitations" are those included in sharing freedom with others. The others have further and radical limitations. In scope they are localized to a fragment of the cosmos, whereas deity is cosmic in scope. In quality the others are both self-surpassable and surpassable-by-others; deity is in one respect surpassable but by self only. These differences define deity; they are great enough to make the idea difficult?so difficult that we have no right to despise those who cannot believe it makes sense, but also so difficult that easy charges of anthropomorphism are misplaced. All our thought is human thought; we have no other basic model of individual reality than ourselves (and other animals). Plato is relevant in one more respect. As already noted, he thought God was analogously related to us as each of us is to the parts of his or her own body. Deity is the World Soul, the mind of the cosmic body. I follow Cornford's scholarship here. I have argued elsewhere that the weaknesses of the interpersonal analogy (God as parent or ruler), or the artisan or artist analogy (God as carpenter or sculptor), are partly overcome by stressing the mind-body (or mind-nervous system) analogy. All of this becomes non sense if combined (as in Spinoza and the Stoics) with causal determinism, the denial of creative freedom.</page><page sequence="15">THEOLOGICAL MISTAKES AND MODERN LITERATURE 69 Unlike Peacock, or even Trollope, Bierce was blatantly anti-feminist; he also glorified war and disparaged peace. Yet he was cynical about professed war aims and saw hypocrisy in President McKinley's war. He did not, I suspect, foresee what Peacock virtually did foresee: the ultimate doom to which unqualified reliance on military means of settling group disputes seems to condemn us. It is hard to think of any writers of the past who help us much in this new trouble. Kant perhaps, or Royce, but not Hegel or Marx. The rational animal must, it seems clear, become more rational, or more wise, generous, and strenuous in the pursuit of the common good than most of us seem to be at present, if our species, or perhaps much of the beautiful web of earthly life that Darwin so deeply and rightly admired, is to survive. The species has become not only its own worst enemy but the primary threat to the value of the only inhabited celestial body we individu ally know of as yet?though I refuse to suppose it is anything like the only one there is. For that dismal conclusion there is no evidence that seems convincing. Samuel Clemens's success, like that of Frost, was deliberately and sagaciously sought. He became, through pen and lecturing voice, a public entertainer comparable to Bernard Shaw. But he reserved his religious heresies largely for posterity, in the posthumous publications The Myste rious Stranger and Letters from the Earth. (See also What Is Man?, published in 1905, five years before his death.) I agree with Edgar Lee Masters that Clemens was not knowledgeable enough to make a serious contribution to philosophical or religious thought. I have another instance to add to the one from Sidney Lanier of an American poet expressing what I regard as a theological truth. Richard Hovey clearly anticipated one of the implications of Whitehead's "objec tive immortality." Having described a desperate military situation, There is no escape by the river, There is no flight left by the fen, We are compassed about by the shiver Of the night of their marching men . . . He comes to his conclusion: God has said, uYe shall fail and perish But the thrill ye have felt tonight I shall keep in my heart and cherish</page><page sequence="16">70 CHARLES HARTSHORNE When the worlds have passed in night." Give a cheer! For our hearts shall not give way. Here's to a dark tomorrow and here's to a brave today.9 I also like to remember his tribute to a forest: For here there is lilt in the quiet And calm in the quiver of things.10 I can understand why Frost did not greatly admire this poet; he was too deeply convinced that "every metaphor breaks down somewhere" to like so positive an approach to life as Hovey's. But there is room for both ap proaches. Like Frost, Hovey appreciated the value of fidelity in sexual relations. Like Frost also, he regarded patriotism as an extension of self-regard. Unlike Frost, but like Bierce, he exalted war and depreciated peace. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the war to end the Spanish rule of Cuba and the Philippines. He did not seem to realize how shamefully we treated the Philippine people after the Spanish surrender. Like nearly everyone in his time, he failed to realize how technology was beginning to degrade war, a process the ultimate limit of which was what we now face, the prospect of ending war by ending humanity itself. However, Hovey, very unlike Bierce, was in advance of his time in his appreciation of the rights of women and the obsolescence of the patriarchal family. The life of Hovey was a tragic one, with a good deal of frustration and an end in early middle age. How far the cause was bad luck and how far it was bad management?lack of sagacity on his part?seems obscure. His goal was to be a great playwright; he did not achieve it. An intensely idealistic individual, he failed to relate sufficiently to the real world. Frost's sagacity and practicality were in clear contrast. But in my view (and also, I have been pleased to find, in Karl Popper's), worldly success is "mostly a matter of luck." The awful nuclear dilemma referred to above was, so far as I know, not anticipated very long before by any philosopher or any scientist. It was, however, virtually anticipated by the novelist Peacock in 1860, using only facts open to such use by any number of writers. A character in Peacock's Gryll Grange, the Reverend Doctor Opimian, replies to another character's praise of the benefits of science by pointing to the way explosives keep</page><page sequence="17">THEOLOGICAL MISTAKES AND MODERN LITERATURE 71 getting more and more powerful. Who knows, the doctor suggests, they may get so powerful that their employment could "exterminate the human race." Given ever-increasing power to destroy, either the upper limit to this terrible power is low enough, taking human folly into account (as Peacock always did), to make the continuance of human life a reasonable proba bility for at least a long future, or the upper limit (if any) is so high as to make this continuance rather improbable. Peacock really faced the situa tion eighty years before the first chain reaction. Who else did? In general, philosophers and scientists have failed to see that all freedom involves risk, that science increases the scope of human freedom so that scientific and technological progress magnify the dangers. Consequently, only an in crease in human wisdom and virtue can offer much hope for the long future. I explain the failure to think this matter through by the historic fact that philosophers, scientists, and even theologians have scarcely believed in freedom in the causal sense of decision-making by individuals whose behavior is not fully determined by anything other than or prior to their actual deciding. Providence cannot?logically could not?substitute for the decisions of creatures. To be a creature is to be a nondivine form of freedom. As a great inventor, Arthur Young, has said, in spite of Einstein God does "throw dice," by "taking a chance on what free creatures may do." "Free creatures" is tautologous; the idea of a wholly unfree creature is contradictory or meaningless. That disbelief in freedom in the libertarian or causal sense is harmless is unfortunately a momentous falsehood. It distorts everything. A final tribute to Hovey: he believed in God but not in heaven and hell. I add his testimony to that of Frost on the point. Another poet, called great by many but difficult for me to assimilate, has expressed a similarly this-worldly standpoint by these six words in "Sunday Morning": "Death is the mother of beauty."11 As usual with Stevens, there is some enigma as to just how this statement is to be taken, but I think it fair to say that the meaning includes this consideration: by viewing a human life as definitely bounded by birth and death, the definiteness, which is the gift of finitude and is essential to beauty, is enhanced. Vague suppositions of survival, what Stevens calls "chimeras of the grave," tend to rob life of its vividness. Any number of beautiful things are around us; let us attend to them. I heartily agree. But without some cosmic power to preserve our experiences, what in the long run do they amount to? Here I think Hovey, anticipating Whitehead, gives us the other side of the story of life's value.</page><page sequence="18">72 CHARLES HARTSHORNE What is needed is not some vague afterlife, but the preservation of this definite, finite life of ours here and now. Without the permanence of that, Stevens gives us nothing much by way of a substitute for religion. Each of the poets and writers of fiction referred to in this essay gives us truth, but only taken together do they come close to the whole essential truth about life's meaning or value. And only by including and completely generalizing Lanier's point, the reality of liberty, can the various half truths, some or other of which every great poet sees, be united in a coherent faith by which one can genuinely and wisely live.

Since Frost's character as a person has been severely, and I think excessively, attacked by his most detailed biographer, Lawrence Thompson, I want to go on record as siding emphatically with the view of Frost taken by W. H. Pritchard in Frost: A Literary Life Reconsidered. I find Pritchard's quotations from Thompson concerning Frost's supposed motivations meanspirited and presumptuous. They remind me of what the psychiatrist Sullivan said in one of his books: "There are some people whose attitude seems to be, 'If I cannot be great, by God there shall be no greatness!'" Two can play at the game Thompson undertakes of imputing motives. Pritchard sees some limitations in Frost but shows how to deal with them without losing sight of his own limitations and of Frost's genuine humanity as well as superb genius. 7. See R. W.
