Price 25s. This book contains a series of twenty short essays on subjects ranging from colonial hy- droids to human societies, and including three essays on aspects of plant life. Animal societies are described as having three things in common (a) a need for food, (b) a method of reproduction and (c) a means of co-ordination and the way in which these requirements are met forms the main theme of the book. Lucidly and clearly written, the individual chapters are very good popular science. Perhaps they are most successful in describing the activities of the higher animals, like monkeys, since the concepts are akin to those of our own lives. The danger is, of course, one of excessive anthropomorphism which Dr. Bonner is careful to avoid. When describing the activities of the lower animals, the processes involved are</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 623 so different, that analogies can be misleading and misunderstanding result. Here, Dr. Bonner succeeds as well as anyone; he is careful not to go too deeply into the subject, and knows when the lay mind has had enough. However, he does use terms like 'permeability', 'gene' without defining them, and assumes his readers know their meaning. On the other hand the trained biologist will read the chapters perhaps too easily, and feel the book tells him little. There are few mistakes of fact; the accounts of the nitrifying bacteria and also of the corals are misleading if not inaccurate. c. T. PRIME</page></plain_text>
