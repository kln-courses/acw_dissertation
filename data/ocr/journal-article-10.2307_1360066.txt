University of Chicago Press and John Murray, 1983. ?25. One cannot but read Professor Alpers's book with a sense of great excitement. To race through it on a first reading is an exhilarating experience. But the sight of undergraduates new to the subject of Dutch art history eagerly taking turns to read library copies, hoping that this book will be a reliable guide to a bewildering seventeenth-century world can only provoke a sense of unease in the specialist. This is not an introductory book. Neither is it simply a monument of coolly and objectively reasoned scholarship, though the erudition displayed is considerable. Rather it is a polemical declaration effectively forming part of a continuing debate which divides the international ghetto of Dutch art-historical studies. Like Baudelaire's ideal critic, Professor Alpers is partial and impassioned. She uses every imaginable rhetorical device to justify her inter- pretation of Dutch art as an art of visual description, as opposed to narration and the representation of concep- tions. The prime cause of her indignation is that the study of Dutch art has been crippled by the orthodoxy pervading the entire discipline in which Italian Renais- sance art is placed in a position of unquestioned supremacy. This might not be objectionable but for the fact that all other western art tends to be examined according to canons which strictly speaking only apply to Italian and Italianate products. I would agree wholeheartedly with Professor Alpers that the accept- ance of a bias which has coloured the study of art for centuries is now unforgivable. That it is still perpetuat- ed in much art-historical writing and teaching is a matter for regret. Professor Alpers deserves unreserved support in her attempt to point out diversity within the European artistic tradition. To assume that this tradi- tion is Italocentric is no longer sustainable. In her book Professor Alpers helps to destroy this myth, though her tendency to over-simplify the character of Italian art will justifiably annoy some whose interests lie south of the Alps. The existence of this Italophile bias is not simply due to educational conservatism and national chauvinism. It is largely a consequence of the primacy of the written word. Most Italian - or more accurately, academic - art appeals to texts, or gives rise to texts, or both. It is characterized by a constant interplay of texts: biblical and classical on the one hand and Renaissance theory and biography on the other. In the constant translation from word to image and back again the art historian, as a manipulator of words, finds little difficulty in interjecting himself. As Professor Alpers points out, much Dutch art is independent of and at a distance from language. There are few theoretical writings and those there are appear to deal with issues largely peripheral to what concerned most Dutch painters. Few Dutch artists defined their work theoret- ically -at least before the 1670s. They practised a craft, mastery of which required a minimum of textual interference. Professor Alpers's major contention is that the predominant character of this craft was that it was an art of description for a culture in which information could be perceived, assimilated, used and enjoyed in purely visual terms; that is, without the interposition of language. Her almost insuperable difficulty, of course, is that without the interposition of language there can be, and indeed there virtually are, no texts which can be used directly to support the theory. Inevitably she must rely heavily on inference and analogy. Professor Alpers has not been alone in finding herself in this difficult position. Michael Baxandall had to deal with a similar problem in his examination of early sixteenth-century German limewood sculpture. Similarly faced with an absence of texts he argued by inference and analogy from the characteristics of composition by the Meister- singers and of contemporaneous calligraphic practice in an attempt to illuminate the formal conventions to which florid limewood sculpture might also have conformed, thereby rediscovering what he terms "the period eye". The rhetorical strategies of the two scholars, however, are quite different, though Professor Alpers acknowledges both general and specific debts to Professor Baxandall. Whilst the latter remains reserved, reticent and almost casual, promising little and there- fore apparently (- and actually -) delivering a lot, Professor Alpers appears to promise the answer to the riddle of Dutch art; a promise which, given the nature of the evidence, no one could fulfil. There is a great danger in arguing by analogy. If one establishes that one thing is like a second because analogies can be drawn between them, there is a possibility that the fact that the first has characteristics which it does not share with the second will be obscured. In her first two chapters Professor Alpers establishes that northern picture making is analogous to the fall of light on the screen in the camera obscura, or on the retina of the eye, according to Johann Kepler's conception. The Dutch took for granted the apparent disparity between the relative sizes of objects which subordination to the picture plane entailed, in contrast to Italian Renaissance perspective, and also accepted the fact of distortion inherent in the use of lenses, including that of the eye. This acceptance, she suggests, lies at the root of Dutch fascination with pictorial illusionism, or trompe N'oeil: an acceptance that the eyes play tricks leading to a desire to trick the eyes. But Dutch painting was not essentially shaped by these observations; rather by craft practice which long preceded them. Huygens and Kepler appealed to picture making as a model in their discussions of lenses, the camera obscura and the eye. This choice of analogy is most illuminating; but to suggest that picture making was effectively limited to the exploration of the characteristics suggested by these analogies is quite unwarranted. The means of visual description which they suggest need not necessarily entail such description being invariably an end in itself. The basis of much Dutch art may well be descriptive rather than narrative and for this suggestion students of Dutch art stand indebted to Professor Alpers; but the foundations should not be mistaken for the entire edifice. Questions of projection theory are notoriously diffi- cult to handle. For this reason they are all too often tacitly ignored by art historians. Those who are bold enough to tackle them in the Dutch context, such as Arthur Wheelock, Walter Liedke, Rob Ruurs and now Professor Alpers in the second chapter of her book, deserve our gratitude. Dutch painters, especially of THE OXFORD ARTJOURNAL- 7:1 1984 57</page><page sequence="2">interior scenes, seem predominantly to have used the distance point, or binocular perspective system derived ultimately from Viator's De Artificiali Perspectiva and propagated by Vredeman de Vries, Samuel Marolois and most effectively by Hendrick Hondius in his Institutio Artis Perspectivae, a practical handbook first published in 1622 and many times subsequently. The main reason for this preference would seem not to have beerr a Dutch distrust or theoretical dislike of the Albertian Construzione legittima, so much as the greater simplicity, flexibility and ease of construction of the former system. By using two sets of receding planes, obliquely viewed objects and architectural elements can more easily be set in relation to one another convincing- ly than when Alberti's principle is employed. Further- more, the Dutch do not always seem to have been especially concerned with a need to relate pictorial elements to one another convincingly. This concern that "seeing" must involve "knowing" which, as John White has pointed out, was assumed in writings on perspective from the middle ages onwards-did not necessarily dominate Dutch painting practice. Cuyp and Potter could make the relative size of a cow and a church appear playfully absurd by not establishing a perspectivally demonstrable distance between them. Much the same may be said of the device of the doorkijkje (the view of a further room subsidiary to the main interior scene) developed by Maes and others. The Dutch may not necessarily have felt the need to "see" and "know" in this sense. On the other hand, some Dutch painters, especially the Delft architectural interior specialists, were evidently intrigued by and attempted to work out problems concerning spatial representation by means of artificial perspective em- ploying wide angles of vision and consequently a spectatorial view point very close to the picture plane. Pieter Saenredam was a master of disguising distortions resulting from this approach, often by combining a suitably adapted composition with a perspectival con- struction in which the view point is placed near the edge of the picture. Professor Alpers contends that by painting in this manner Saenredam reveals himself the direct heir to Vredeman de Vries's principles of the distance point method and the aggregate view; yet however attractive this notion may seem, one cannot help but suspect that she is trying to drive a wedge too definitively between southern and northern projection practice. Her anxious urge to differentiate Dutch notions from Italian ones may be too strong. By the seventeenth century Italian artists were using modified systems of artificial and synthetic perspective them- selves. Caravaggio's use of narrow angles of vision and a view point at a great distance from the picture plane is as "eccentric" in Albertian terms as is Saenredam's wide angle and close view point. In addition Professor Alpers's desire to discuss theory may have deflected attention from the exigencies of the craftsman's needs. The simplest form of legible perspective construction recommends itself to those not preoccupied with learned concerns, whether the painter be Dutch or Italian. In this context an examination of Hendrick Hondius's guide to perspective (which she does not mention) and its probable use by painters might have been illuminat- ing. From projection theory Professor Alpers turns to the Dutch craft of representation in a chapter which is full of challenging ideas and insights. She interprets the Dutch art of visual description as essentially taxonomic and compares it with Francis Bacon's non-mathemati- cal and observational bias in his project for a post- Aristotelian natural history. Not confining this principle to the analysis of straightforward representations, she suggests that one reason for the popularity of subject paintings, such as proverb illustrations by Jan Steen, amongst others, was that they were thought of as observations of the natural world: means of categoriz- ing, rather than analyzing, human behaviour. Although suggestive, this interpretation of the Dutch interest in proverb lore and vernacular emblems (the two being closely associated) does not tell us very much in itself. Taxonomies and lists are far from being intellectually neutral products. Their structures and the choices involved in their compilation alone can tell us some- thing of the ideological assumptions of those who used them. We should not stop short of seeing the world as being ordered according to conventions - which may contain unresolved contradictions - but which are broadly shared by those who partake of a given culture. They are the product of intellectual and social processes far more complex than simple observation and listing. Steen's proverb illustrations are not elements of a straightforward taxonomy of human behaviour, but function by means of essentially non-observational conventions, such as the comic stereotypes of adynata and topsy-turvydom. In a fascinating fourth chapter, Professor Alpers argues that the descriptive quality of Dutch art led it to be more closely related to map production and other means of conveying information visually (astronomical, geographical, genealogical) than to disegno, which is essentially concerned with rhetorical persuasion and the conveying of emotion. In the chapter which follows, she draws a further distinction between Dutch art and the characteristically Italian art of the expression of emotion. She describes many northern figures as "performative". They act out proverbs, or social ritual, sometimes with accompanying captions. She points out that this is a category into which many Dutch emblems fit and cogently describes "genre" scenes not as moral admonitions related to emblem literature, but as an "engagement with social ritual at the point where pictorial tradition and contemporary social custom meet". The essence of Professor Alpers's approach is to be found in the concluding sentence of her analysis of a drawing by Jacques de Gheyn II of a woman and a child with a picture book, previously interpreted by her old antagonist, Hessel Miedema. She states that we must "fix our gaze, as the Dutch fixed theirs, on the representation of the stuffs and makings in the world rather than searching beneath their surfaces". Although in the lengthy note appended to this statement she acknowledges that "the interpretive [sic] stance that contrasts realism and allegory is misleading, since there is no such thing as simple realism", her entire thesis is an elaboration of the belief that there is, and that in the Dutch case this realism has an epistemological signifi- cance. The nature of this significance is discussed in a well argued and illuminating appendix in which the author instructively takes to task the leading proponent of the emblematic approach to paintings, Professor E. de Jongh, for interpreting Dutch realism as being merely a veil obscuring hidden meanings. She rightly points out that such an apprehension is better suited to 58 THE OXFORD ARTJOURNAL- 7:1 1984</page><page sequence="3">the analysis of emblematic compositions in the Italian- for which one might substitute learned, or humanist- tradition. Dutch emblems deal predominantly with commonplaces and shared concepts, rather than with learned subtleties or secret wisdom. Professor Alpers is surely right - at least up to a point - when she states "it is not a notion of hidden meanings that produces such works, but rather the notion of a world that is understood in terms of an assemblage of visibly accessible meanings". Yet in the main text of the book the question of what meanings were made accessible by diligent visual representation is often left unexplored in favour of establishing the fact of the independence of visual representation itself. This effectively deprives the carefully crafted representational image of any allusive property and implies an acceptance of the view that locates such qualities beneath surfaces, which in turn is implicitly set in opposition to an interest in surfaces in their own right. The author is so concerned to establish the autonomy of visual description that the central problem of Dutch art - the nature of the relationship within it of the allusive with the descriptive - is evaded by effectively detaching the one from the other and assuming that the former is essentially "hidden beneath surfaces". In practice this implies an acquiescence in the transfer of the Renaissance Italian definition of visual arcana to the seventeenth-century Dutch situa- tion: a procedure the validity of which the author in theory denies. Furthermore, realism itself is more than a question of a "sincere hand and a faithful eye", as Professor Alpers would have it, adapting a phrase of Robert Hooke. There is more to visual description than mere ipso facto description. Realism inevitably involves choice and suppression as well as representation. To suggest that the individual representational elements of a realistic painting are immediately equivalent to those things they represent entails suppressing an examination of the interdependence of representational motifs by means of which they signify. It also ignores the painter's or draughtsman's feat of memory in overcoming the changing conditions which inevitably affect the appear- ance of the object while he is depicting it. Although some Dutch artists - for instance, Gerrit Dou - ex- ploited, meditated upon and allegorized trompe 1'oeil effects, the author ought perhaps to have pointed out more clearly that even pictorial deception depends on the acceptance of convention and the apprehension of ambiguity. In addition, although the painting is not the object it represents, neither is it a mere conglomeration of representational motifs. Rather, it is its re-creation in new terms and as such is also a creation in its own right. This common substantiality of both the object represented and its representation is presumably char- acteristic of iconic, as opposed to linguistic, forms of representation. Therefore, the more realistic the picture, the more there tends to be a subordination of its communicative aspect to what Louis Marin calls "the permanent power of sensual solicitation of painting". Professor Alpers is certainly aware of at least some aspects of this question: indeed she touches on it in an early note. Yet in spite of her claim to see Dutch pictures primarily as a means of recording and imparting information about the visible world, she would appear to have been seduced by their "power of sensual solicitation". The result is an imputation to the Dutch of an over-ridingly sensual and specifically visual preoccupation with the surfaces of the objects represent- ed. The author stresses this quality at the expense of attending either to the allusive qualities of images, or to their places in associative structures of knowledge. To demonstrate that realism cannot be said to stand alone, let us take as an example the work ofJacques de Gheyn II. Professor Alpers single-mindedly appeals to his realistic representational skills as manifesting "this restless, attentive eye with more persistence than any other Dutch artist" in the early seventeenth century. She cites de Gheyn's water colour drawings of entomo- logical specimens and his study sheets on which in one case a mouse and in another, a man's head, is depicted several times from a variety of view points, as a prime example of the Dutch visual preoccupation. with the attentive, unambiguous description of observed reality and the appearance of the surfaces - the textures - of things. Yet such an art entails choice and suppression. Ambiguity and the apparent lack of it are two sides of the same coin. De Gheyn was also preoccupied with the ambiguous qualities of surfaces. His design for a garden grotto to be seen in two drawings - one in the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York and a more finished and elaborate version in the British Museum, London- -makes considerable use of pictorial ambiguity. The grotto has the appearance of a gigantic head and further faces emerge from the juxtaposition of roots and rocks in the configuration of its structure. Similarly, sheets of drawings in the Pierpont Morgan Library and else- where and a number of related prints testify to the same exploration of the ambiguity of surfaces. These are studies of stones the surfaces of which are made up of grotesque heads and faces; in the case of one drawing and a print they are placed beside studies of an old woman's head. These works (generally ascribed to de Gheyn's namesake son and close follower, though reportedly accepted by the leading de Gheyn scholar, the late J.Q. van Regteren Altena as late works by the father) testify to the impossibility of erecting a bound- ary between a notional pure visual description and both the exercize of the imagination and an appeal to convention in either the examination of an object or its representation. De Gheyn's work includes examples not only of pictorial ambiguity, but of outright fantasy. Both he and his son are well known for their representations of witches' gatherings and rites in which fantastic creatures are regularly depicted. Professor Alpers illustrates the sheet in Frankfurt-am-Main in which witchcraft scenes peopled with fantastic creatures are set beside a detailed study of a hermit crab. Although she states that this juxtaposition demonstrates the complexity of the relationship between curiosity and imagination, she implies that a distinction was and can be drawn readily between the two. But in de Gheyn's work reality and fantasy elide more readily than is apparent from this drawing alone. His studies from two angles of a quadruped rodent standing erect by grasping a gnarled staff awakens a sense of ambiguity, for it might be a realistically portrayed emaciated flayed rat in an anthropomorphic posture, or a creature of fantasy. On the same sheet (in the Berlin print room) he includes three studies of frogs, while a study sheet in the Lugt Collection (Institut Neerlandais, Paris) con- tains similarly conceived and executed drawings of fantastic, frog-like creatures beside studies of books resting open on skulls suggesting motifs for his witch- THE OXFORD ART JOURNAL- 7:1 1984</page><page sequence="4">craft scenes. This all suggests that realism and fantasy are not so easily disentangled as Professor Alpers would have us believe for the convenience of the rhetorical fluency of her argument. Her ruthless distinction is between the "truth" of representational draughtsman- ship and the "folly" of what we label fantasy. To denigrate de Gheyn's witchcraft drawings as "question- able researches" and to state blithely in this context that "distinctions between truth and folly are not always easily made" reveals that an anachronistic sensibility has evaded the author's historical guard in a manner peculiarly ironic for one who claims inspiration from Michel Foucault and offers this book as a supplement to Les Mots et les Choses. To use Foucault's metaphor - repeated more than once in that book- Professor Alpers is in danger of undervaluing the importance of that part of the seventeenth-century grid of knowledge which does not coincide with our own, while exaggerating the significance of that part which does. The polemical conception of the book effectively limits its scope so that pictorial realism is never really satisfactorily explored as the "assemblage of visibly accessible meanings", for only examples which she argues reflect and reinforce her pre-occupation with visual description itself are analysed. Her attempt to pare Dutch art down to its basics and to force Dutch realism to stand on its own is like trying to balance a single playing card on its edge: more than one is needed if a structure - however fragile - is to be built. In spite of an imbalance resulting from its polemical conception this book is full of insights, many of which were achieved by the consideration of material in novel argumentative contexts. One can only regret that its partial and impassioned character makes it dangerous for those uninitiated in the field of Dutch studies. Although some will doubtless reject this book tout court preferring the less radical or demanding alternatives presently on offer, many specialists will doubtless incorporate some of her views into their own sets of basic assumptions about Dutch art. One can only hope that in the process some of the far-reaching implications of Professor Alpers's ideas are explored rather than repressed. The densely argued nature of the text, its many substantial notes and the fact of its being written in Californian English, the subtleties of which can easily elude the comprehension of British and European readers, may combine to discourage response at an appropriate level. Nonetheless, Professor Alpers has served the art historical community excellently by raising the intellectual stakes in the game of Dutch art history with a fascinating and highly exciting study.
