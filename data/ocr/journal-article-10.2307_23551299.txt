Introduction If we define history, in the sense of what historians do, as explaining change over time, then history interacts with theories such as Harvey Whitehouse's Modes of Religiosity theory in two important ways. First, history provides data, just as anthropological fieldwork and controlled laboratory experiments do, to test and refine the theory. Second, if a theory is logically coherent and empirically productive across a range of cases then it can be used to add plausibility to hunches where his torical data on particular cases are lacking, can point to fruitful research agendas, and can contribute to explanations of change for which his torians strive. Elsewhere I have written about the first of these two interactions, by considering whether or not the theory of modes of religiosity is sup ported by the historical test case of ritual practices in Reformation Europe (Vial 2004). I take this special edition of Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion to be about the second aspect of the interaction of theory and data, to consider the ways in which this theory may be useful to historians of religions. I will have a little to say about the first task below, since if the theory fails when tested by historical evidence, there is little reason to go on. Here I simply stipulate that with cer tain modifications the theory passes this first test, and so I move on to consider its uses. I begin with a discussion of Paul Ricoeur's distinc tion of structural and causal explanation. This is followed by a sum mary of Whitehouse's theory and the data from Papua New Guinea which inspired it. Some possible modifications of the theory are then considered, taking as a starting point Ukka Pyysiàinen's argument that there may be a third mode of religiosity. While the theory has been useful in my research and in Luther Martin's investigations of Mithraism, I will argue that it requires certain refinements in order to be useful broadly across the history of religions. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2004 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion Also available online - www.brill.nl 16, 292-300</page><page sequence="2">HISTORICAL RITUALIZED PRACTICES 293 2. Ricoeur on Explanation One of the reasons for the excitement surrounding cognitive approaches to religions in general, and Whitehouse's work in particular, is that it appears to offer a way around the tired impasse in religious studies between interpretation and explanation, hermeneutics and science. Whitehouse has made a genuine advance in our understanding of reli gious behavior by moving beyond just this impasse. I would argue that his work does this for two reasons. It is not only that it is based on theories of human cognition for which there is a growing body of empirical evidence with which to test and improve hypotheses; it is also because Whitehouse identifies a structure of human religious action that constitutes a real explanation. In an important essay Paul Ricoeur has argued that we can get past the humanities/science impasse precisely because meaningful human action shares certain features in common with texts (Ricoeur 1979). We need not recapitulate what these similarities are here. But if we accept Ricoeur's argument that we can stand in the same relationship to actions as we do to texts, this will have certain implications for what we mean when we claim to make sense of an action or set of actions. Having construed (an interpretive move) what we think is going on, there is then a structural moment to the process of making sense: It proceeds from the suspension ... of the ostensive reference. . . . According to this choice, the text no longer has an outside, it has only an inside. . . . On the basis of this abstraction, a new kind of explanatory attitude may be extended to the literary object, which, contrary to Dilthey, is no longer borrowed from the natural sciences. ... If some model is borrowed, it comes from the same field, from the semiological field. It is henceforth possible to treat texts according to elementary rules which linguistics suc cessfully applied to the elementary systems of signs that underlie the use of language (Ricoeur 1979: 94-95). To identify patterns or structures of actions is to offer a real explana tion—a structural one, which may be related to but is distinguished from the kind of causal explanation we associate with certain kinds of theories in the natural sciences. Whitehouse appears to have done this at two levels. First, he has identified certain clusters of ritual charac teristics that often appear together. These are the two modes. This is important but, as he acknowledges, not an entirely original observa tion. At the second level, however, he has identified a repeating pat tern of interaction between the modes. This constitutes a structural explanation of the religious behavior of the Pomio Kivung. If the same</page><page sequence="3">294 TED VIAL or other related patterns can be identified, then Whitehouse's expla nations will be useful to historians of various traditions. 3. Whitehouse's Modes of Religiosity Theory In one sense there is nothing new about Whitehouse's observation that there were two distinct modes of religiosity among the Papua New Guineans who were the subject of his ethnography in Inside the Cult. He noted roughly the same distinction that Max Weber captured with his distinction of charisma and routinization, or Ruth Benedict with her categories of Dionysian and Apollonian (Whitehouse 1995: 3). What is exciting about Whitehouse's theory is his proposal that these two patterns are common and commonly observed because they rely on universal cognitive structures of the human mind. Specifically, if a reli gious tradition, to survive, must at a minimum 1. cause participants to remember whatever it is that counts as the beliefs and rituals of that tradition, and 2. motivate them to remember and practice, then these two modes of religiosity are distinct because each relies on a different mnemonic strategy. The imagistic mode relies on what cognitive sci entists call episodic memory, the doctrinal mode on semantic memory. Episodic memory stores individual events that stand out because they are important or shocking or moving. Semantic memory stores events that are repeated. It stores them as scripts rather than as individual events. So, for example, you are likely to remember where you were and whom you were with when you experienced your first kiss, or heard of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. But if you are a regular church goer (or restaurant goer, or barbershop goer, etc.), you will probably be able to recall in general what likely happened at a church service last year, but not recall specifically who was in atten dance or what was said (unless something out of the ordinary occurred). To take religious examples, a clear case of the imagistic mode would be the Baktaman people of inner New Guinea described by Fredrik Barth, who practice their initiation rituals very infrequently (perhaps every twelve years), but who remember them because of their trau matic and shocking nature. One's own initiation would be stored in episodic memory. A clear case of the doctrinal mode would be a mainstream Protestant worship service in the United States. In White house's formulations, the two patterns look like this (Whitehouse 2002: 296-308):</page><page sequence="4">HISTORICAL RITUALIZED PRACTICES 295 Doctrinal mode 1. Repetition of doctrine. The ideas transmitted in the doctrinal mode tend to be a logically coherent, orally transmittable, rhetorically per suasive body of teachings. 2. Clearly marked leaders, who emerge based on their rhetorical abil ity to cast doctrines persuasively, and relevandy. 3. Orthodoxy checks, arranged by leaders to keep the doctrines stable. 4. A rigorous schedule of ritual occasions for the frequent rehearsal of this body of doctrine. Information repeated in this way is stored in semantic memory (as opposed to episodic memory). 5. Low rates of spontaneous exegetical reflection. Because the scripted rituals stored in semantic memory that are the occasions for the rehearsal of doctrine can be performed on autopilot, there is little occasion for people to feel the need to produce their own inter pretations of rituals. 6. Hierarchical and centralized leadership set up to enforce orthodoxy. 7. Membership in the group is defined by possession of this scripted memory. Thus these groups form an imagined community that can include people far beyond one's face to face acquaintances. 8. Patterns of rapid and efficient dissemination. Imagistic mode 1. Rituals are infrequently repeated and highly arousing. 2. Participants tend to reflect spontaneously on the meaning of the rit uals (in contrast to the reliance on official exegeses of the doctrinal mode). 3. This individual reflection leads to a diversity of religious represen tations. 4. Dynamic leadership is inhibited. 5. This lack of dynamic leadership reinforces a lack of centralization and orthodoxy. 6. The high arousal of the rituals fosters relatively small groups, but levels of group cohesion are high. 7. These groups form localized, exclusive communities. 8. It is difficult to disseminate imagistic traditions very far or wide.</page><page sequence="5">296 TED VIAL 4. Papua New Guinea The plausibility of Whitehouse's theory stems to a great extent from the brilliance of his ethnography, Inside the Cult. The rich and sensitive description of the Papua New Guinean villagers with whom he lived goes a long way towards demonstrating that his theory is not only coherent, but empirically productive. Such application to thickly described rich and messy historical groups is lacking from other theoretical work in the field of the cognitive study of ritual. Granted, other authors may have other contributions to make, but in the end it is with historical explanation that the rubber meets the road. In Papua New Guinea Whitehouse stumbled upon a fortuitous sit uation. He encountered each mode in relatively pure and distinct fash ion. The predominant religious tradition in the area he studied was the Pomio Kivung. This was a group that combined pre-contact cos mology with the doctrinal mode that apparently was not instanced in Papua New Guinea before the arrival of Christian missionaries. The ritual calendar was demanding and tedious: daily temple offerings; twice weekly offerings at a second temple; weekly offerings at a family tem ple; fortnightly garden meetings; and twice weekly public community meetings at which three different orators rehearsed the Pomio Kivung doctrines (Whitehouse 1995: 67, 75, 76, 79, 81). This regimen of ritual practice during which the "logically coherent, orally transmittable, rhetorically persuasive body of teachings" was rehearsed led to what Whitehouse has termed the tedium effect. It accomplished well the first necessary task of a tradition, which is to be inscribed in memory. But motivation was notably low among Pomio Kivung supporters, most of whom seemed bored. In this context a mil lennial splinter group emerged. This group centered on an innovative set of rituals that were, in comparison to the Pomio Kivung regimen, very imagistic, and increasingly so as they continued to try to bring about the return of the ancestors. When the ancestors failed to return, despite the increasing emotionality of the splinter group's rituals, the group collapsed. Most members returned to the Pomio Kivung. But, Whitehouse claims, they returned re-charged, with greater motivation. He has found evidence that such splinter groups break off every five years or so among the Pomio Kivung. This seems to be the pattern by which the Pomio Kivung maintains both memory and motivation over time. Whitehouse thus witnessed both modes side by side. In the years since then he has taken the admirable and absolutely necessary step</page><page sequence="6">HISTORICAL RITUALIZED PRACTICES 297 (unfortunately a rare one for theorists) of gathering teams of anthro pologists and historians to see if his theory pans out in other settings. In retrospect it seems to have been lucky that he did is fieldwork where he did, otherwise he may not have developed this theory of two dis tinct modes. But the upshot of this collaborative effort has been to show that, as we move through time and place, the situation in Papua New Guinea turns out to be a relatively stark one. These two modes rarely seem to appear so distinctly, side by side. Long standing, stable religious traditions often appear to be a kind of mix of the two modes. This raises the question of whether there is perhaps a third mode of religiosity. 5. Other Modes? The proposal for a third mode was first made by Ilkka Pyysiáinen (Pyysiáinen 2004): Since first presenting his argument for a third mode at a Modes Conference in Vermont, Pyysiáinen has dropped his pro posal and moved closer to examining the various ways Whitehouse's two modes may interact, as I propose below. He has suggested that there is great empirical evidence for a third mode of religiosity that stands somewhere between the two poles of doctrinal and imagistic. This third mode he defines as "people's actual beliefs and behaviors in a doctrinal context." Pyysiáinen draws on the research of Justin Barrett, who has shown that people who can give "theologically cor rect" answers to theological questions on surveys, when called upon to do real time processing, almost inevitably resort to anthropomorphic or "theologically incorrect" concepts (Barrett 1998). Pyysiáinen links theologically correct concepts to the doctrinal mode, theologically incor rect concepts to the imagistic, and argues that huge swathes of human religiosity employ both. As evidence he convincingly refers to revival movements, in particular the nineteenth-century Scandinavian Laestadian movement. I have my doubts that we ought to follow Pyysiáinen's move to a third mode for two reasons. First, to associate theologically correct (non anthropomorphic) ideas with the doctrinal mode and anthropomorphic representations with the imagistic mode is to fall unwittingly back into Protestant polemics. On an empirical level, the Australian religions described by Durkheim in the Elementary Forms of Religious Life are both non-anthropomorphic and imagistic (rituals are infrequent and effer vescent). In fact one could read much of my criticism of Whitehouse in the Theorizing Religions Past chapter as accusing him of just this confusion,</page><page sequence="7">298 TED VIAL which is based on an ambiguity in what it means to be "logically coher ent." In one sense of this phrase, it would mean passing muster with Enlightenment rationalism, all else being superstitious. But in fact few religious ideas pass this test, even in the most doctrinal of traditions. A trinity does not fare much better than an ancestor or witch. The question really is, according to Whitehouse's own definition of doctri nal, are these counter-intuitive ideas developed robustly and linked together coherendy with other doctrines? This second sense of logically coherent can be the only one that the modes theory can use if it is to apply to any religion. In Theorizing Religions Past I argue that medieval Catholic practices that Protestants polemically characterized as magi cal were in fact as doctrinal as Protestant theology. Secondly, and more importantly, the real advance of Whitehouse's theory is its grounding in cognitive mnemonic strategies. While it is certainly conceivable that we will discover new strategies or reconceive the way we think about human memory, for the time being we are left with the two major types of semantic and episodic. If these are what underlie the two modes, we must ask what kind of memory dis tinguishes Pyysiáinen's third mode from the other two. That said, Pyysiáinen's root observation is absolutely on target. As it stands Whitehouse's theory overlooks a great deal of religious behav ior. Rather than multiplying modes, however, I suspect that the more fruitful approach will be: to stick with the two modes as ideal types, but recognize that the pattern of interaction between the two found in Papua New Guinea is in fact a pattern that is rarely in evidence else where. By definition stable large religions, which encompass most of humanity, need to be doctrinal, yet find some way of tapping into the imagistic as a way around the tedium effect. One pattern is splinter group and reintegration, as Whitehouse experienced with the Pomio Kivung. What the modes theory needs now is to delineate other log ically possible patterns of interaction. These will be the structural pat terns that will count as explanation in Ricoeur's sense, and be useful to historians in trying to account for change over time. 6. Modes of Religiosity and History Has the modes theory shown its usefulness to date for historians? Early results lead to a cautiously optimistic yes. One example is Luther Martin's bold hypothesis about the ancient mystery cult of Mithras (Martin 2004). While there are ample artefactual remains from this cult, scholars have long been frustrated by the difficulty of patching</page><page sequence="8">HISTORICAL RITUALIZED PRACTICES 299 together a coherent account of the doctrines or beliefs of Mithraism. To a large extent the frustration stems from a lack of Mithraic texts. Martin has suggested that the search for such texts may be motivated by a faulty theory of religion, one which assumes that religions will be more alike than perhaps they are. Scholars from doctrinal backgrounds may not pick up on the differences in an imagistic tradition. Martin has suggested just this: from the physical evidence one can easily con ceive of Mithraism as an imagistic religion. If that is the case, the search for theological texts and the attempt to reconstitute a coherent set of beliefs from the physical evidence is as vain as the search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. 7. More Patterns can Help A more fruitful way to build on Pyysiáinen's insight is not to multiply modes, but to multiply patterns of interaction between the two modes. A tradition in the doctrinal mode that maintains motivation by spin ning off then reabsorbing imagistic splinter groups is but one pattern, the one found among the Pomio Kivung. A second pattern might be revivalism, which is not seen as a threat to the established group, but is welcomed and encouraged (Jonathan Edwards and the Great Awakening is a historical instantiation of this pattern). Another model is the one of pietism, which self-consciously institutionalizes the use of small motivational groups that remain part of the larger doctrinal tra dition. Other models might be drawn from medieval Catholicism, which seemed to achieve a degree of equilibrium by drawing on just enough imagistic characteristics to maintain motivation. The liturgical calendar that uses both daily and weekly schedules but also involves annual fes tivals and jubilee celebrations would seem to be relying on both modes at once, as does the increasing pageantry of the mass from the eleventh through the fifteenth centuries. If a limited number of such patterns of interaction of the two modes could be established, this would be of great benefit to historians of rel atively stable traditions. Each pattern is a kind of structural explana tion in Ricoeur's sense, which would account for certain aspects of the tradition, and could generate a research agenda for exploring less well known aspects of a tradition.
