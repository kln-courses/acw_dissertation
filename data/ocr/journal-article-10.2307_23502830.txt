<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH By JULIAN MORGENSTERN, Hebrew Union College, Cincinnati, Ohio. INTRODUCTION. r I AHE Decalogue in Ex. 34. 14-26 presents many difficult, interesting and significant problems. Ever since Goethe, with keen, critical acumen, compared this Decalogue with the better-known one in Ex. 20.2-17, and thereby established its independence and greater antiquity,1 this Decalogue has been the subject of careful and profound study by leading Biblical scholars, and hypotheses and conclusions regarding its origin and literary history of a surprisingly wide range have been advanced. In general scholars have assumed that inasmuch as the Decalogue of Ex. 20 is unquestionably of Elohist authorship, this obviously older and more pronouncedly ritualistic Decalogue in Ex. 34 must be the work of Yahwist writers; or, if not actually the work of Yahwist writers, themselves, then the work of writers, somewhat older than but so closely akin to the Yahwist school, that it has been incorporated into the J Code with such ease and thorough ness that it has become to all intents and purposes an integral part of that Code. This hypothesis is assumed gratuitously rather than proved conclusively by the marshalling of convincing evi dence. Accordingly Biblical scholars generally speak of this as the Older or J Decalogue. That this Decalogue is older than that of Ex. 20 is almost self-apparent.2 But the question of its origin 1 Zwo wichtige bisher unerortete biblische Fragen; 1773. * Eerdmans (Alttestamentliche Studien, III. 77-92) maintains that we have no Decalogue here, and also that the passage is of post-exilic origin. His evidence and argument are, however, gratuitous, apodictical and not at all conclusive. Pfeiffer ("The Oldest Decalogue," JBL, XLIII [1924], 294-310) also holds that the laws of Ex. 34 are comparatively young, and represent a modification of an older decalogue found at the end of the Book of the Cove nant in Ex. 23.12-19. 1 nant in Ex. 23.12-19.</page><page sequence="2">JULIAN MORGENSTERN and authorship, and in particular, whether it is the work of Yahwist or pre-Yahwist writers, is certainly worthy of renewed, careful, scientific investigation. Moreover scholars seem to have assumed, again gratuitously, that the ten laws themselves constitute a complete literary unit, and that if they be of pre-Yahwistic authorship, they existed originally entirely by themselves without any literary setting, introduction or conclusion, that consequently only these ten old laws themselves could have been incorporated into the J Code, and the narrative setting in Ex. 33 and 34, in which we now find these laws, is entirely the work of J, with, however, certain minor additions and slight alterations by D and P writers. It seems scarcely to have occurred to Biblical scholars that perhaps the narrative setting in Ex. 33 and 34, or at least a certain portion thereof, may have been from the very beginning inseparably associated with the ten laws, a part of the same little booklet or document, of which these laws formed a nucleus, and that when the laws were incorporated into J, the original narrative setting naturally was likewise incorporated with them, with however, as was to be expected, certain necessary and reasonable modifica tions, to make it accord better with the main J narrative. This question, too, merits careful scientific investigation. In a paper entitled "Biblical Theophanies"3 I discussed this question incidentally but at some length, and presented consider able evidence supporting the conclusion that a certain portion of the narrative in Ex. 33 and 34 and also Num. 10.29-32 formed the original narrative setting of the ten laws in Ex. 34, or rather a fragment of the original narrative setting, and that this narrative setting with the ten laws constituted a literary unit, an indepen dent document, the oldest in the Hexateuch. This document I ventured to call, because of the main thought underlying it, the Little Book of the Covenant, distinguishing it by the adjective from the related Greater Book of the Covenant in Ex. 20.23-24.8. And this Little Book of the Covenant I designated for the sake of convenience of reference C2, while the Greater Book of the Cove nant I labelled CI. ־ ZA, XXV (1912), 139-193, and XXVIII (1915), 15-60; cf. in particu lar XXV, 171-193.</page><page sequence="3">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OP THE HEXATEUCH Since then continued investigation has brought to light many new facts of great import, which not only fully corroborate the previous conclusion of the original independence and early author ship of the Little Book of the Covenant, but also make it possible to fix its date and determine the conditions and purposes of its composition with greater certainty and exactness perhaps than any other document of the Hexateuch with the possible exception of the Deuteronomic Code. And, in addition, new and increased light is shed thereby upon the history of Israel in two of its most critical periods, that of the Exodus from Egypt and the desert wanderings, and that of the time in which this document was composed ; and this in turn enables us to answer with far greater fullness and probability some of the most difficult and intricate problems of Israel's early history. For this reason the entire subject is worthy of being taken up anew, in a manner entirely independent of and in greater detail than the first and somewhat preliminary and tentative treatment in the paper on "Biblical Theophanies."4 Moreover, it has become evident that the label C2 is rather inept, since on the one hand it is easily confused with CI, the label for the Greater Book of the Covenant, and on the other hand it is misleading ; for, as I shall endeavor to show, the Little Book of the Covenant is older by more than a half century than the Greater Book of the Covenant, while just the opposite and the incorrect implication is conveyed by the respective labels C2 and CI. Furthermore, constant study has established the dominant 4 The literary history of this Decalogue has been investigated repeatedly by many of our foremost Biblical scholars, and conclusions with regard thereto of the most extreme and surprising range and variation have been reached. It would require a paper of considerable length merely to give a survey of the hypotheses which have been advanced and the conclusions which have been reached by these scholars, while a detailed and systematic consideration of these hypotheses and conclusions would in itself constitute a book of no mean size. Inasmuch as the present study is in every respect independent of all previous investigations and reaches conclusions all its own, and anticipated in no way whatsoever, so far as I can see, by any earlier Biblical scholar, I have deemed it inexpedient and supererogatory to attempt even a complete list of these pre vious studies, and refer only incidentally and as the occasion may arise to such as may require citation.</page><page sequence="4">JULIAN MORGENSTERN presence of a Kenite background and point of view in this Little Book of the Covenant. It is therefore both convenient and appro priate to designate it as the Kenite Document, and label it K, and to label the Greater Book of the Covenant simply C.5 II ANALYSIS OF EXODUS 33-34. Before considering the ten laws in detail, it will be well to make a thorough analysis of the narrative passages which we assign to K, in order to establish the correctness of this assign ment and to pave the way for further conclusions, which must be based upon this analysis. It requires but little consideration to realize the intricate composite character of the opening portion of Ex. 33. Elsewhere6 I have shown that vv. 7-11, which by almost all scholars are assigned to E, are utterly out of accord with the underlying literary and theological principles of that document, but accord fully with, and are in fact essential to the course of the narrative of J. They are beyond all possibility of doubt, in their present form at least,7 an integral and extremely valuable portion of the J Code. Moreover vv. lb-6 contain matter obviously emanating from J and E and RJE, yet so intricately woven together that it is extremely difficult to attempt a complete analysis with even a moderate assurance of correctness. Vv 5bc-6 are certainly E. Likewise the thought in vv. 2a and 3b that the Deity will not go up in the midst of Israel, but that instead He will send an angel to lead the people8 is certainly Elohistic, since the J Code tells 5 Probably the spelling Qenite, and the consequent employment of Q as the proper label would have been more in conformity with scientific usage. But inasmuch as Wellhausen many years ago {Die Composition des Hexateuchsנ [1899], 1) used Q to designate what has since come to be generally known as the Priestly Code, it is now expedient, in order to avoid confusion, to designate this Qenite or Kenite Document, K. For this reason, too, in this paper I employ the spelling Kenite rather than Qenite. 6 "The Tent of Meeting," J AOS, 38 (1918), 125-139. 7 But cf. below, p. 122, for a partial qualification of this statement. 8 Cf. Ex. 23.20ff.</page><page sequence="5">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH throughout that Yahwe does Himself accompany Israel upon its entire journey through the wilderness and reveal Himself to Israel directly and frequently in the form of the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night.9 On the other hand vv. lb-5a10 contain much material that is self-evidently Yahwistic, yet equally obviously not at all primary in character, and therefore most probably J2 or RJ. More than this cannot be affirmed with any certainty. We are now ready for the analysis of vv. 12ff. In the first place it must be noted that these verses exhibit manifest evidence of editorial revision and amplification. In v.15 פנים is used in a sense altogether different than and unrelated to its use in either v. 14 or v.23, a sense which in every way, as we shall see, disturbs the continuity of the main narrative. In the second place v. 13a is in part at least, if not entirely, a parallel to or anticipation of the same thought which is expressed in v. 18. There the request of Moses comes in its logical place and finds its proper sequence, as we shall see, in the continuation of the story. But the thought of v. 13a comes entirely too early and is altogether without sequence. Furthermore, the thought of v. 13b that Israel is already Yahwe's people, illogically anticipates the thought of Ex. 34, lOff. that Yahwe is about to establish a covenant with Israel. Not until this covenant has been established, can Israel, strictly speaking, be called so positively Yahwe's people. This thought here accords perfectly with the basic idea of the J Code, that already from the days of Abraham Yahwe had destined Israel to be His people and Himself to be their God. And that according to J this covenant between Yahwe and Israel had already been ratified, is apparent from the fragments of the J version of the revelation on Sinai in Ex. 19 and 24. But according to our main narrative here this covenant is still to be proposed by Yahwe and ratified by Himself and Israel. Consequently this statement in v.l3b, that Israel is already Yahwe's people and therefore already has an incontrovertible claim upon Yahwe's favor and protection and even His companionship upon its journey, accords not at all י Ex. 13, 2If. Cf. "Biblical Theophanies," ZA, XXV (1912), 153-158. 10 Omitting of course 2a and 3b&lt;ry.</page><page sequence="6">JULIAN MORGENSTERN with the thought of the main narrative. We must conclude there fore that v. 13b is secondary. Moreover, the same conclusion must apply to vv. 15 and 16, for here, too, the underlying thought is that Yahwe is already and completely Israel's God, and Israel is His people. For, as the two verses state, only Yahwe's presence in the midst of His people can distinguish Israel as more wonderful or powerful than all the other peoples of the earth. Likewise the use of אני here and also in v. 19, in contradistinction to the older אנכי, as used in the main narrative,11 is to be noted, and likewise the significant expression אני ועמך used twice in v.16, according to which Moses seemingly places himself before the people in the estimation of Yahwe. Now it cannot be accidental nor without import that in all these verses, which accord but ill with the main narrative, one expression and one underlying thought find constant repetition. It is the expression מצא חן, and the thought that Moses has found particular favor in Yahwe's eyes, favor so profound that it dis tinguishes him entirely and sets him completely apart in Yahwe's sight from the people at large. It is the same expression with exactly the same connotation which is found not only so fre quently in this passage" but also in Num. 11.11,15. Moreover, the statement in v. 12b that Yahwe has become so well-disposed toward and familiar with Moses as to know him by his own name, and that He has already told Moses that he has found favor in His, Yahwe's, eyes is entirely without direct antecedent in the narrative of Exodus. Nowhere previous to this do we find the record of any such statement made by Yahwe to Moses, in these exact words. The nearest approach thereto is in Ex. 32,7-14, when Yahwe singles out Moses from the rest of the people as the object of His favor, and proposes to make of Moses a great and separate nation, even while He destroys all Israel. This same thought is repeated in Num. 14, 1 Iff. Furthermore, in all these passages in which Moses, in significant contrast with the rest of Israel, is represented as the especial object of Yahwe's favor, one thing is particularly noticeable, viz. his temerity in venturing to " Ex. 34. 10, 11. » Ex. 33. 12b, 13a, 16, 17b; 34. 9.</page><page sequence="7">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH differ with Yahwe and argue against Yahwe's various proposals. Again and again Moses expostulates with Yahwe, and apparently sees more clearly than Yahwe the inglorious and unworthy con sequences of Yahwe's proposed actions; and in every case Moses' arguments carry the force of conviction and Yahwe allows Him self to be turned from His expressed intentions. All this is no mere passing thought and phrase. Rather it expresses a thought or theological principle characteristic of J2. The proofs of all this as well as other cogent reasons for assigning all these and other similar passages to J2 I have discussed fully elsewhere.13 In the light of these facts we may for the present, set down as as the work of J2 the following verses, 33.12b, 13,15, 16,17b; 34.9. Likewise in 34, vv. 1-5 clearly disturb the continuity of the main narrative, and accord not at all with its underlying thought. V. 1 states explicitly that Yahwe proposes to Himself write the laws upon the tablets, while vv. 27 and 28 state that Moses writes these laws at Yahwe's bidding. Moreover the verses contain numerous evidences of Yahwistic authorship. We may therefore, with practically all scholars, unhesitatingly assign them to J. 1,י 3־ "Moses with the Shining Face," HUCA, II (1925), 1-27. 1יי A moment's thought suffices to show that the verses are not entirely homogeneous. Thus in v.4 the subject משה occurs after the second verb וישכם instead of after the first verb ויפסל, where the change of subject takes place, and the explicit mention of Moses' name would normally be expected. (So also LXX, the Targumim and Pesh.) The present word order is awkward and suspicious. Moreover, the use of שני לחת אבנים in the second half of the same verse, without the article (with the possible exception of Pesh., all the versions, however, seem to have read האבנים), despite the fact that these tablets have just been mentioned in 4a, is also awkward and suspicious. The difficulty is obviated perhaps, if we set down vv.2-4aa as a redactorial insertion. And inasmuch as they are manifestly dependent upon Ex. 19.11-13 (J), we must regard them as the work of RJ. Vv. 1 and 4a07b-5a alone therefore in all likelihood belong to the main J narrative. That these verses are J rather than E, as Baentsch holds (Commentary, 280) is clear from a number of unmistakable J characteristics, such as the designation of the mountain by the name Sinai in 4a!8, and the fact that Moses is instructed to prepare the tablets, whereas, according to E in Ex. 32.16, the first tablets, and presumably therefore the second tablets also, were the work of God Himself. Likewise the expression שני לחת אבנים in contrast with לחת אבן (E) of Ex. 31.18 points to J authorship. And finally, the expression וירד יהוה בענן in v.5 is characteristic of all Yahwist theophanies. (Cf. "Biblical Theophanies," ZA, XXV [1912], 153-158, and</page><page sequence="8">JULIAN MORGENSTERN Other portions of 34 are also manifestly secondary. The analysis of these portions may, however, be advantageously deferred until we shall have completed the analysis of the main narrative. As possibly integral portions of this main narrative, there remain Ex. 33.1a, 12a, 14, 18-23 and 34.6ff. V. la tells of Yahwe's command to Moses to depart from this place, he and his people whom he had brought up from Egypt. Impliedly this is not yet Yahwe's people, but merely the people whom Moses himself had brought up from Egypt. The reason for Yahwe's command to Moses and Israel to depart from this place is not stated. Undoubtedly it was contained in the original K document, but has been suppressed by the J2 writers or editors in favor of their version of the golden calf story. What it may have been we shall attempt to determine later. But to Yahwe's command Moses replies directly, "Behold You have just commanded me,15 'Bring away this people' ;but You have not informed me whom You will send with me." The impli cations of this verse are significant. Moses has brought Israel to this spot. Presumably the starting point of their journey was Egypt, and this mountain, for we shall see that this is a mountain, and a sacred mountain at that, was the first goal of their journey. Moses was able to lead the people from Egypt to this spot, it is manifestly implied, because he knew the road thus far. And he could have known the road thus far only because he had himself travelled it previously at least once. But if he had made the journey only once, it could have been only from this spot down to Egypt, and would imply that Moses had been born in or near this spot. Such an implication is unlikely, since on the one hand, "The Tent of Meeting," JAOS, 38 [1918], 125-139.) On the other hand, Baentsch's grounds for ascribing these verses to E are altogether unfounded. He does so partly on the basis of a very questionable analysis of Ex. 32 and partly because he assigns the main narrative of Ex. 34 to J, and then realizing the incongruity of these verses with the main narrative, he naturally infers that these verses belong to E. But, as we have intimated, and shall soon prove, the main narrative of Ex. 33-34 must be assigned to neither J nor E, but to K. Vv.lVv.l 5,Vv.l 5, including the redactorial passage, must therefore be assigned to J. 5b is redactorial, as we shall see. 15 Notice the force of the participle.</page><page sequence="9">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH it has no parallel in any of the traditions of the other documents, and on the other hand, it would fail completely to account for Moses' strong interest in the people whom he brings out of Egypt and to this mountain. In other words, the full context of this verse implies that, just as the J and E documents, the K docu ment also must have told of Moses' original journey from Egypt to this mountain, of his return thither, and of his then bringing Israel out from Egypt to this mountain by the road with which he was now well acquainted, since he had thus gone over it twice before. The verse implies still more. Moses cannot lead the people farther, presumably because he has never been farther than this mountain, and so does not know the road, the location of the wells and springs of water in the desert, and the consequently necessary camping-places. If Israel is to journey farther through the desert, and is not to perish, another guide, fully acquainted with the country lying beyond this sacred mountain, is needed. And so Moses replies to Yahwe's command to leave the mountain, "Very well, but you have not yet informed me whom you will send with me to act as our guide through this unknown and there fore dangerous wilderness." Apparently Moses expects, not a supernatural nor divine guide, such as the angel of E, the pillar of cloud and fire of J, or the K'bod Yahwe of P, but only an ordinary mortal, who will guide the people through the wilderness beyond in the perfectly normal, human way in which Moses has guided it from Egypt hither. But still more is probably implied in this verse. For Moses' answer to Yahwe's command is something more than a mere, objective reply. It is by implication a demand and a question, a demand upon Yahwe to designate a guide to lead Israel through the desert, that it perish not, and a question, who will this guide be. But such a demand and such a question imply something further, that Yahwe Himself has a certain responsibility in the whole affair, that He had something to do with Israel's having come hither under Moses' leadership, and that for this reason, since He now bids them journey on, away from this spot, and since Moses is incapable of leading the people farther, Yahwe is Himself logically and morally obligated to provide a new and</page><page sequence="10">10 JULIAN MORGENSTERN competent guide through this unknown country. Even more than this, the implication seems to be that Yahwe's responsibility is due to the fact that Moses had probably brought Israel hither to this place at Yahwe's suggestion, anticipating perhaps that Israel would dwell here forever, in close proximity to this moun tain, and not knowing nor even suspecting that speedily, at Yahwe's command, it would have to wander onward; for had Moses known, or even suspected this, due advance provision would undoubtedly have been made for a competent guide from this spot onward, and Moses would not have been completely taken by surprise, as he clearly seems to be here, by Yahwe's command to lead the people away from this mountain ; nor would there have been any need for him to now demand by implication that Yahwe furnish a guide, and to inquire who this guide will be. Apparently therefore the original K document, again like both J and E, must have told, in the earlier portions suppressed by the J2 editors, that Moses had gone down to Egypt at Yahwe's bidding, to rescue Israel and bring it to Yahwe's sacred mountain out in the desert. But unlike J and E, the K document did not relate that Yahwe had announced to Moses in advance what His purpose with Israel was in thus delivering it from Egypt and bringing it to His mountain. This developed only later in the sequence of the K narrative, after Israel, under Moses' leadership, had arrived at the mountain. Then, to Moses' very logical and just objection, with its implied demand for a competent guide and question as to who this guide will be, Yahwe replies, "My Panim shall go and I will give thee rest," i.e. "I will thereby relieve you of the heavy responsibility and the grievous burden which the guidance of this people from Egypt hither has laid upon you. Henceforth this task of guiding the people shall rest upon My Panim, and you shall be relieved." The difficult question arises here, and must be answered in the course of this investigation, what is meant by "My Panim"? With the exception of the Peshitta16 and Vulgate,17 all the 16 Which, reading קךמיי !ל, probably emended פני ילכו to לפני לך, and inter preted the passage conditionally, "If you walk before Me, then I will give you rest." 17 Which translates literally, "faciès mea praecede te."</page><page sequence="11">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 11 versions and translations, both ancient and modern, interpret פני as meaning "I Myself;" i.e. Yahwe answers Moses, "I My self" or "My presence will go, and I will give thee rest."18 This same interpretation, with but slight modification, is given by all modern commentators without exception, so far as I can see. This interpretation is based primarily upon the expression in II Sam. 17.11, ופניך הלכים בקרב, where פניך certainly has the mean ing, "Thy presence," i.e. "Thyself." It is likewise supported by Deut. 4.37, ויוציאך בפניו, and by Is. 63.9, particularly as emended and interpreted by most scholars with LXX, לא ציר ומלאך פניו הושיעם, "Not angel nor messenger, but He Himself saved them." Moreover, in accordance with this passage, modern scholars are inclined to distinguish between the מלאך אלהים and the פנים or פני יהוהיהוה here by saying, quite gratuitously, that the former tended to develop into the "Angel of God," a theological concept, independent of the Deity, while the Panim always continued to be regarded as Yahwe Himself, or at least the form assumed by Him in contact with mortals.19 Moreover, it is an indisputable fact that the J 2 redactors in v. 15f. interpret פני to mean Yahwe Himself. This accords per fectly with the fact that פנים did come to mean "self," as in II Sam. 17.11. The only question, however, is not whether פני ילכו of v. 14. can mean "I myself shall go," but whether in this particular passage in the original K document, it actually had this or some altogether different meaning. Careful consideration of 33.15f. and 34.9 makes it perfectly clear that פני ילכו cannot at all have had the meaning in the original text, "I myself will go." For had it had this meaning, in 18 LXX renders Avtos irpoTropebcropod &lt;rov\ Targum, שכנתי תהך; so also Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Ramban, אני בעצמי אלך. Targum Pseudo-Jona than, interestingly enough, paraphrases and interprets, אמתין עד דיהכון סבר אפין דרונזא, "Wait until the appearance of anger has passed, and then I will give thee rest." Apparently it interpreted פני as "My anger;" in this it manifestly followed the opinion of Rabbi Jose b.Chalafta, a Tanna of the middle of the 2nd century (Ber. 7a). This was likewise the interpretation of Saadya, accord ing to Ibn Ezra to this passage. (For these last references and a number of valuable suggestions I am indebted to the kindness of my colleague, Professor Jacob Mann). " So Marti, Ceschickfe der israelitischen Religions, 78.</page><page sequence="12">12 JULIAN MORGENSTERN other words, had Yahwe from the very first expressed His willing ness or intention of going with Israel, then why should Moses have continued to present cogent reasons in vv. 15f. why Yahwe Himself ought to go in Israel's midst? For while it is true that the J 2 redactors who inserted these two verses here interpreted פניך as meaning "Thou Thyself," none the less the context shows that they had serious doubts whether Yahwe Himself was actually going up with Israel ; in other words, they were by no means cer tain that פני ילכו meant "I Myself will go." Nor does it help matters in the least to follow Graetz in his unwarranted reading of v.14, 20,הפני ילכו "Should I Myself go, and give thee rest?" This forced and false exegesis merely recognizes the inherent difficulty here, and the inconclusiveness of the many solutions hitherto proposed. Moreover, it is clear that in 34.9 Moses is still interceding with Yahwe to go Himself; nor is there the slightest intimation there that Moses has already received Yahwe's word that He would go, as would be the case if we accept the customary interpretation of 33.14. Nor will it solve this difficulty if we follow Marti and other modern scholars and interpret this verse as meaning that Moses is dissatisfied with Yahwe's Panim, the form in which He reveals Himself to mortals, but demands instead that Yahwe in His true, divine, to mortals incomprehensible form and being, accompany Israel, and literally "go in its midst." Such an interpretation would be sheer nonsense. Certainly this verse implies one thing and only one thing, that Moses has, as yet, received no promise from Yahwe, nor even the slightest intimation of a promise, that He will go in the midst of Israel. In other words, this verse establishes beyond all possibility of doubt, that פני in 33.14 can not possibly have had in the original K document the meaning "I myself." The traditional and generally accepted interpréta tion of פני is certainly incorrect. But the question as to its real meaning it still open and awaits answer. For the present, how ever, it will be well to pass it by, and return to it later, when further analysis of the narrative shall have provided additional material to work with. 30 Cf. Holzinger, Commentary, 108.</page><page sequence="13">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 13 Vv. 15-17, as we have seen, are the work of the J2 redactors. The continuation of the main narrative is found in v. 18. But a moment's consideration shows that this verse, too, has been revised slightly by a very late, probably Priestly, redactor. As it stands at present, it reads, "Let me behold Thy glory." The reference to Yahwe's glory is altogether without connection or application. Quite obviously, it is used here in the technical sense charac teristic of P; the Kebod Yahwe is the fiery form which Yahwe assumes, according to P, when He reveals Himself to mortals.21 What Moses asks for, seemingly, is not that he may behold Yahwe's glory, but that he may behold Yahwe Himself. כבדך is manifestly a substitute by some Priestly author for another, original word, probably objectionably anthropomorphic in char acter, which connoted, or seemed to connote, Yahwe Himself. This is proved absolutely by the LXX rendering of the verse, 'En&lt;pàv1a6v'En&lt;pàv1a6v /iol aeavrôv, "Show unto me Thyself." What could this original word, for which כבדך is the Priestly substitute, have been? The answer to this question is not difficult. That it must have been פניך, suggests itself immediately, and is proved abso lutely by a mass of evidence. Just as the J2 redactors of vv. 15-17 used פניך in v. 15 in the sense, "Thou Thyself," so LXX and also the late Priestly redactor of v. 18 understood this original פניך of v. 18 to mean "Thee, Thyself." Probably the manuscript from which the LXX version was made still retained the original פניך ; hence the LXX rendering aeavr&amp;v. But in another manuscript, from which our MT is descended, or even perhaps at some time after the LXX version had been prepared, some late Priestly writer, taking exception, in accordance with Priestly theology, to the gross anthropomorphism of the original פניך, substituted for it the regular, conventional, Priestly technical, theological term כבדך. But while we may be sure that פניך was the original reading here, it by no means follows that the interpretation of LXX and of the late Priestly redactor, "Thee, Thyself," was correct. On the Cf. "Biblical Theophanies," ZA, XXV (1912), 141-153.</page><page sequence="14">14 JULIAN MORGENSTERN contrary, understanding that v. 18 is the direct continuation of v. 14, the reading פניך there gives the verse an altogether new and significant meaning. In v. 14, Yahwe has said, "My Panim shall go, and I will give thee rest." Thereupon Moses replied, "Let me see Thy Panim." Clearly Moses has understood פני in v. 14 in its customary, physical sense, "My face," and immediately a thought has suggested itself to him. He does not stop to consider the incongruity of the idea as he has interpreted it, that Yahwe's face, in a physical sense, will go with Israel. His attention has been caught by the first word alone, פני, "My face." So he im mediately makes his request, "Let me see Thy face." The continuation of the narrative is found in v. 20. V. 19b, whatever its real meaning may be, is obviously the work of the J? redactors a variant expression of the characteristic J2 thought of Moses finding favor in Yahwe's eyes. V. 19a is equally obviously out of place, and should follow v. 20 instead of preceding it. For, v. 21 is the direct and logical continuation of v. 19a., just as v. 20 is the direct and logical continuation of v. 18. Why the J2 redactor in revising v. 19 should have transposed it to precede v. 20, it is difficult to imagine. Not impossibly this transposition may have been the work not of the J2 redactor, but of the late Priestly redactor, who substituted כבדך for the original פניך of v. 18, and who sought to reduce the objectionable, anthropomor phic character of this passage still further by removing the refer ence to Yahwe's physical face in vv. 20 and 23, since these could not be suppressed entirely, as far as possible from his כבדך in v. 18. In v. 18, Moses, misinterpreting the פני of v. 14 in a physical sense, has asked, "Let me see Thy face." Immediately the answer comes back from Yahwe, "Thou art not able to see My face, for man cannot see Me and live." Manifestly these words can have meaning here only as the answer to Moses' request to see Yahwe's face. Otherwise they would have no significance whatsoever. This is in itself final proof, if such be needed, that v. 18 must have read פניך originally for the present כבדך. That פנים is used here, and consequently also in v. 18 in its purely physical connotation, is proved by the continuation of the nar rative in v. 23, where Yahwe's face, the part of Him which may not be seen by mortals, is contrasted with His back, the part of</page><page sequence="15">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 15 Him which may be seen, at least by Moses. But it is equally clear that פני in v. 14 has not this physical connotation at all, but an altogether different meaning, and that with his first, hasty, impulsive, unreasoned thought, Moses has misunderstood the term פני. So Moses' request cannot be granted; he cannot behold Yahwe's face, as he has desired. Nevertheless Yahwe will do as much for Moses as possible, and grant as much of his request as He is physically able to do. The continuation of v. 20, is, as has been said, v. 19a. But here, too, as well as in 19b, the hand of the redactor is readily apparent. The present MTreads, "And I, I will cause all My goodness to pass before thee, and I will call upon (?) the name of Yahwe before thee," ואני אעביר כל טובי על פניך וקראתי בשם יהוה לפניך. In the first place, the use of the late אני, characteristic of J2 and Ρ is suspicious; it undoubtedly indicates revision by either the J2 or the Priestly redactor of the original text. Even more suspicious is the use of the colorless and alto gether late theological term טוב. LXX reads, 'Εγώ 7ταρ6λεύσομαι 7r7rpoTepos σου rf! δόζτ! μου; this probably represents a Hebrew אני אעבר על פניך בכבדי; and that this reading or one closely similar to it, must have stood in the Hebrew text, is proved by בעבר כבדי of v. 22. Manifestly כל טובי here is a very late and altogether theological substitute for an earlier כברי. But even this reading כבדי cannot be original; it must be the result of a late, Priestly attempt to reduce as much as possible an objectionable anthropo morphism in the original text, just as the Priestly כבדך in v. 18 serves the same purpose. What the original text must have been, it is not difficult to determine. In the first place, it is significant that instead of using the Hif'il, אעביר, as here, v. 22 uses the plain Kal, עבר. Moreover the Kal is used everywhere else, in v. 22b and in 34.6. Obviously the (כבדי or) אני אעביר כל טובי of v. 20 is a late, Priestly substitute for the original and extremely anthropomorphic, אעבר, or perhaps more fully אנכי אעבר. Moreover, v. 19ab presents a seeming thought which a moment's consideration shows must be in itself altogether mean</page><page sequence="16">16 JULIAN MORGENSTERN ingless, and can only be the result of a modification or mutilation of the original reading. What sense can it have, that Yahwe should pass before Moses and call upon22 the name of Yahwe? What in all the world can be the meaning of the statement that Yahwe will call upon His own name? Here LXX, while not entirely solving the problem, at least puts us on the right track. It reads και λαλήσω έττί τ φ ονόματι μου Kvpios kvavriov σου. In other words, it reads in Hebrew וקראתי בשמי יהוה לפניך, "And I will call upon My name, Yahwe, before thee." This, however, has helped in the solution of our problem only a little, and has not at all answered the question, what can it mean, that Yahwe should call upon His own name? Moreover, in the Hebrew text, as reconstructed from LXX, the presence of יהוה alongside of and seemingly in apposition with עמי, is, to say the least, awkward. All these difficulties are obviated and a positive and signifi cant meaning is given to the verse by three slight emendations of MT; the omission of יהוה and of the preposition ב in בשם, and the change of the resultant שם to שמי as LXX has it. This part of the verse will consequently read, וקראתי שמי לפניך, "And I will call out My name before thee." That this is the correct restoration of the original text is proved by the fact that, as we shall see, this is actually what does happen. Ex. 34,6 tells explicitly that, just as He has promised here, Yahwe passes before Moses and calls out His name before him. Accordingly we conclude that v. 19a must have read originally, אנכי) אעבר על פנ־ך וקראתי שמי לפניך). The implication of all this is that Moses does not yet know the true name of this Deity with whom he is conversing, and that Yahwe now prepares to reveal His true name to Moses for the first time. In other words, we have here, very obviously, an account of the revelation to Moses of the hitherto unknown divine name Yahwe, parallel to the Ε account of the same incident in Ex. 3.15 and the Ρ account in Ex. 6.2, and likewise independent of the J traditions that the name Yahwe was known already to Abraham,23 or even to the generation of Sheth.24 In other words, this narrative tells that, although Yahwe cannot allow Moses to see His face, He will 22 ?, or perhaps "worship," cf. 'קרא ב in Gen. 12, 8 and passim. *3 Gen. 12.8. 24 Gen. 4.26.</page><page sequence="17">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 17 still do for him all that He can; He will pass before him, and will, as the story goes on to say, make it possible for Moses to see His back, and He will also reveal to Moses His true name, hitherto unknown.25 Yahwe then gives, in w. 21-23, the details of the procedure. He says to Moses, "Behold here is a standing-place with Me, and you shall take your place upon the mountain. And when I pass by, I will put you in the cave of the mountain, and I will cover My hand over you, until I shall have passed by. Then I will remove My hand, and you shall see My back, but My face shall remain unseen." In v. 21, מקום must be understood in its simplest etymological meaning, "a place to stand."26 The use of the article with צור is significant; צור here means, not so much "rock," as "moun tain;"27 and the use of the article probably indicates that in the preceding and now missing portions of the K document, this mountain had been referred to so specifically that the article here was necessitated ; as we shall see, it was the well-known mountain upon which Yahwe was thought to dwell. In v. 22 for the present בעבר כבדי the original must have read, as we saw above, בעברי. In fact, we still find עברי in v. 22b. Manifestly the redactors carelessly forgot to make their custom ary emendation here, and so allowed the original עברי to stand. The fact that נקרת הצור is determined is significant. It is not that it is any chance cave or cleft upon the mountain, but a certain, definite cave. Of this cave we shall hear more specifically later. In this cave Yahwe will place Moses, and while He passes by will cover the mouth of the cave with His hand. Then when He will have passed by, and in consequence His back will be 25 Not impossibly the י in the original שמי, may have come to be regarded in time as an abbreviation for יהיה; then the resultant שם יהוה would almost of necessity require the preposition ב to give it meaning; in this way the present text, וקראתי בשם יהוה לפניך, may have arisen. Or it may be equally well that in order to harmonize this passage with the tradition that the name Yah we was known from of old, or at least had been revealed to Moses long before this, as both the E and P documents record, the original text here was purpose!}' modi fied or mutilated into the form in which MT now has it. 26 Cf. Barth, Nominalbildung,* 240ff. 27 So also Ibn Ezra to this passage.</page><page sequence="18">i8 JULIAN MORGENSTERN turned toward the cave, He will remove His hand, and Moses, standing in the mouth of the cave, will be able to see His back, while His face will remain unseen. Such is the entire procedure. The original narrative of the K document probably went on to tell, doubtless quite briefly, how Moses, obeying Yahwe's command, took his place in the mouth of the cave upon the top of the mountain. This has, however, been suppressed by the J2 redactors in favor of the amplified J passage in Ex. 34.1-5. The original K narrative is resumed in v. 6. That there is a distinct break between w. 5 and 6 a moment's consideration will show. V. 5 tells that Yahwe descends in Moses' presence from heaven in the cloud, in the manner characteristic of the J literary style and theology. The subject of ויתיצב in v. 5af3 is undoubtedly Moses; the use of the Hitpa el here, in place of the Nifal, as in Ex. 33.21, is striking, and perhaps further indication of variant authorship. The subject of ויקרא in v. 5b can be only Moses,28 and the passage can mean only, "And he (Moses) called upon the name of (i.e. worshiped) Yahwe." But this is not at all what 33.19 has promised. There it states explicitly, as we have seen, that Yahwe Himself will call out, or call upon His own name. The reading here, !ויקרא בשם יהוד, with Moses impliedly the subject of the verb in place of Yahwe, accords with our previous conclu sion that 33.19a/3 read originally וקראתי שמי לפניך, and that the present reading there, as well as the corresponding expression in 34.5b is the result of J2 redaction. Obviously these J2 redactors sought to suppress the motive of another, independent revelation of the divine name Yahwe, contained in the K document, by the insertion of the preposition ב before שם, and the endeavor to change the subject of the verb from Yahwe to Moses. In significant contrast to all this, v. 6 tells just what we expect to hear, that Yahwe passes before Moses, and calls out before him His true name, Yahwe. This verse obviously resumes the original K narrative. And in this verse, the first !יהוד must clearly be the subject, not only of ויעבר, but also of ויקרא, while the second as well as the third יהוה must equally obviously 28 However, Num. 14.17f., a late J2 passage clearly dependent upon this, makes Yahwe the subject of ויקרא, and by implication also then of ויתיצב; so also Ibn Ezra to this passage.</page><page sequence="19">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 19 be the object of 2.ויקרא« Only interpreted thus, can this verse agree with and carry out the promise of Yahwe to Moses in 33.19-23, that He will pass before Moses and call out His true name before him. To consider an understood משה as the subject of ויקרא, as is usually done, and as was seemingly intended by the J2 redactor here,30 may have been regarded by him as a theo logical necessity, but it is certainly a linguistic and literary mons trosity, while at the same time it utterly misdirects and destroys what is obviously one of the main points of the original narrative, and also needlessly repeats the thought of v. 5 b. The remainder of v.6 and all of v. 7 manifestly constitute a purely theological insertion by the J2 or even some later redactor. This lengthy statement of the attributes of the Deity does not at all accord with the statement of 33.19 that while He is passing before־ Moses, Yahwe will call out His true name before him. What we expect from that statement is exactly what we have when this long list of attributes is omitted, viz. the simple pro nouncement of the divine name Yahwe, just as we have it in the parallel E and P narratives in Ex. 3 and 6. This long list of attributes does not fit at all into Yahwe s own mouth even despite Num. 14.17f.; but if we understand that J2 redactors sought to construe an unexpressed משה as the subject of ויקרא in 34.5 and again in 34.6, and also inserted the preposition ב before שם in 33.19 and again therefore in 34.5, we can well understand the significance of this passage. Manifestly for J2 redactors just the solemn pronouncement of the divine name and the recitation of these divine attributes constituted the ritual act connoted by the expression קרא בשם יהוה. Moreover the theological implication of these attributes by no means fits the early date at which, we shall see, the original K document was composed. It accords with the theology of the later prophets who followed Jeremiah and taught that Yahwe was long-suffering and of abundant kindness to His people, and ever 2י Saadya, as quoted by Ibn Ezra to this passage, held that the second יהוהיהוה was the subject of ויקרא, and the third יהוה the object. Ibn Ezra, how ever, rejects this interpretation in favor of one practically identical with that which I have offered. 3" Though not in Num. 14.17f.</page><page sequence="20">20 JULIAN MORGENSTERN ready to forgive their sins, for His name's sake or some other equally cogent cause, even though through their own repentance or other merits they may not have actually deserved such grace.31 34,6b and 7 therefore must be regarded as the work of the J2 redactor, or perhaps in part of some even later writer. Clearly they take the place of the short statement of the original K document that, as Yah we passed by, He placed His hand over the mouth of the cave, in which Moses stood, and then, when He had passed by, and had called out His name, He removed His hand and thus enabled Moses to see His back, while His face remained unseen, even as He had promised. The continuation of the original narrative of the K document is, of course, v.8. Awed by the vision which he has just beheld, and the sound of the divine name, which he has just heard for the first time, Moses prostrates himself upon the ground and adores this august Deity. V.9 in its present form is obviously the work of J2. The expression מצאתי חן בעיניך in a, as well as the entire phraseology and thought of b indicate this. Moreover the plea of Moses that, even though Israel is a hard-necked people, none the less Yahwe ought to accompany them and forgive them and regard them as His peculiar possession, is characteristic of J2, but altogether out of accord with the thought of K. For it implies that Israel is 31 It is quite likely that this list of attributes is not a unit. Seemingly the statement of v. 7b that Yahwe does not hold (sinners) guiltless, but visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children's children unto the third and fourth generations, contradicts the statement of v.7a that Yahwe pardons iniquity, transgression and sin. Of course these two statements can be harmonized easily enough by theological reservations and dialectics; but on the face of it 7b does seem to contradict 7a absolutely. It is quite likely, therefore, that the original J2 list of attributes ended with 7a, and that 7b was appended still still later by some zealous dissenter, who refused to subscribe to the doctrine expressed in 7a of God's boundless love and pardoning grace, but insisted upon the opposite doctrine of divine retribution. Perhaps he was the same J2 redactor who repeated this passage almost verbatim in Num. 14.18. This is in part the same doctrine that is expressed in Ex. 20.5, but with an altogether different and more logical and restricted application. Clearly the expression of this thought in 34.7b is later than and dependent upon 20.5. Our hypothesis, that 34.7b is a late addition, designed to qualify the direct and broad expression of divine love, grace and pardon of 7a, therefore becomes increasingly probable.</page><page sequence="21">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 21 already Yahwe's people and therefore has a potent and undeniable claim upon Him for guidance and care and even for forgiveness, whereas, according to K on the other hand, Israel is not yet Yahwe's people, for the covenant between Yahwe and Israel has not yet been established, nor even proposed. However, the last word of this verse, ונחלתנו, seems to have a particular significance. The verb נחל has a twofold meaning, (a) to enter upon or take possession of something, and (b) to have or hold possession of something. Ordinarily the difference between these two meanings is slight and of no particular import. But such is not the case here. Of course the verb might mean here, "And do Thou have us," or "keep us as Thy possession," i.e. "do not cast us off from being Thy people, because of the sin which we have committed." Probably just this is the sense which the J2 redactor meant this verse to convey, for it is exactly the same thought which he has expressed previously with much the same argument in 33.13b. But equally well ונחלתנו could mean, "And do Thou take us as Thy possession," and so imply that Israel was not Yahwe's people, and that Moses now requests Yahwe to take Israel to Himself as such. Assuredly this was not the thought of the J2 redactor. But with almost equal assurance we may infer that v.9 in its present form is the J2 substitute for a verse or passage of the original K document, in which Moses made this very request, that Yahwe now take Israel as His people, and that perhaps ונחלתנו here was taken over directly from the original K verse. There, of course, it could have had only the meaning, "And do Thou take us as Thy possession." For v.10 is obviously Yahwe's answer to just such a request of Moses. Israel is not yet Yahwe's people, but עמך, "thy people," Moses' people, the people whom he had brought up from Egypt, just as in 33.1a. Now for the first time Yahwe pro poses, presumably in answer to Moses' request, to make a cov enant with Moses' people, a covenant by which they will now become His people and come under His direct and constant pro tection and enter into His worship. It is a further instance of the condescension and kindness which Yahwe has already shown Moses. He has promised,, at Moses' request, that His Panim shall lead Israel on the remainder of its journey. He has revealed</page><page sequence="22">22 JULIAN MORGENSTERN to Moses His divine name and permitted him to catch a fleeting glimpse of His back. And now He takes Moses' people as His people and expresses His willingness to enter into a covenant relation with them. Manifestly the thought of v.lOaa is in full accord with the course of the K narrative, and indicates quite conclusively that this brief passage is an integral part of the original K document. This conclusion is confirmed by the use of אנכי in this passage, in place of אני, the form of the pronoun which, we have found, was used regularly by the J2 redactor,32 and which is even used again by him in his continuation of this very verse. That v. 10a/3b is the work of the J2 redactor is proved likewise by the use of the word ברא; for, with the possible exception of Amos 4.13, ברא is not used by any Biblical writer earlier than Jeremiah33; and Amos 4.13 is generally regarded by Biblical schol ars as a late addition to the prophet's actual message. Moreover the thought of v. 10a/3b is too diffuse and out of harmony with the narrative of the original K document; for we expect here, not the present vaunting boast about the miraculous things which Yahwe is about to do in all the earth, but a simple statement to the effect that Yahwe will bless Israel, now about to become His people, and bring them to a good land in which they may dwell in safety, and protect and prosper them ever thereafter. In all likelihood the present v. 10a/3b is the substitute for some such state ment which stood in the original K document. It was suppressed by the J2 redactor in his endeavor to represent this, not as a new covenant, nor as an independent account of the old covenant, but merely as a happening incidental or supplementary to the J account of the solemnizing of the covenant between Yahwe and Israel. V. 11a, however, is again undoubtedly apart of the original K. This is indicated both by the use of אנכי and by the singular appropriateness of the thought of this half verse to that of the original K document at just this particular point. For after Yahwe has informed Moses that He will make a covenant with Israel, naturally upon the basis of a body of laws setting forth the w Cf. 33.16,19. 33 31.21.</page><page sequence="23">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 23 fundamental principles of the worship of Him by Israel, it is to be expected that the statement of these laws should be preceded by a charge to Israel to observe these laws punctiliously. But with equal certainty vv. llb-13 are not K, but the work of some Deuteronomic redactor. Both the language and thought are characteristically Deuteronomic. In particular the mention of the six nations, which, in itself might be either J2 or D, and the command not to make a covenant with the pre-Israelite inhabi tants of Palestine, but instead to throw down their altars, to shatter their sacred pillars, and to cut down their Asheras, are unmistakably indicative of Deuteronomic glossation.34 It can be easily demonstrated that, for perfectly obvious reasons, Deuter onomic writers manifested a keen interest in all Biblical legislation earlier than the Deuteronomic Code and took far-reaching liber ties in the way of glossation, and even of occasional revision and supplementation, of these earlier laws. We shall have convincing evidence of this in our discussion of the laws of the K document. Moreover, the command in vv. 1 lb-13 not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land is illogical and even meaningless without first a definite statement of what land it is to which Yahwe refers. Such a statement has not yet been made in the K document; for, as we shall see, even in the lost passage for which v. lOajSb is the J 2 substitute, the promise was apparently made in only the most general terms, that Yahwe would bring Israel to a good land, without, however, specifying what land this would be. But in the later J and E documents references to Canaan as the land promised from of old to Israel by Yahwe are so frequent, that the reference here to the inhabitants of the land by the Deuter onomic glossator is perfectly natural. This is final proof, if such be needed, that vv. llb-13 must be secondary. The immediate continuation of v. 11a in the original K docu ment was, as was to be expected, the statement of the first and presumably the most fundamental law of the worship of Yahwe by Israel. This we find in v.l4a. The introductory כי is, of course, redactorial, necessitated by the insertion of vv. llb-13 be tween v. 1 la and v. 14a. After this first law the other laws followed 34 Cf. Deut. 7.1-5; 12.1-3.</page><page sequence="24">24 JULIAN MORGENSTERN in uninterrupted succession in the original K document. Inas much, however, as the analysis of the present text of these laws in vv. 14-26 is attended by peculiar difficulties, and really consti tutes in itself a problem in most respects independent of the analy sis of the narrative portions of the K document, it will be well to defer its detailed consideration until later. Following, in the K document, the statement of the laws now found in vv. 14-26, came Yahwe's command to Moses, in v.27, to to write these laws down as the permanent record of the covenant which He is making with Moses and Israel. V.28a is undoubtedly J2,J2, for the reference to the forty days and nights upon the moun tain and Moses not eating during this period, is manifestly late and not original, and comes certainly from J2. In the original K narrative there was no obvious motive for such a long sojourn by Moses upon the mountain. Instead the implication of 33.1a and 12a seems to be that Yahwe had commanded Israel's immediate departure from the mountain ; and there is not the slightest impli cation that the making of the covenant had influenced Him in any way to change His decision in this respect. Furthermore, in v.28b the words על הלחת are in all probability editorial, inserted to harmonize the original K narrative as far as possible with the J2 insertion of vv.1-5. But whether the remaining words of v.28b, ויכחב את דברי הברית עשרת הדברים, were integral in the K document or are editorial, is a difficult question. The weight of evidence, however, seems to favor the conclusion that in the main they do come from the original K document. For, on the one hand, we would expect to find at this point in the K document just what these words do offer, a statement that Moses obeyed God's command and wrote down the laws, either on tablets, or more probably upon a scroll, just as in Ex. 24.4 and 7. And on the other hand, a simple compu tation shows that 34.14-26, to say nothing ofvv. 1 lb—13, contains certainly not ten laws, but either twelve, thirteen or fourteen, according to the manner of computation.^ It follows therefore 35 If vv.19-20 be counted as one law, the total number of laws will be twelve; but if v.19 be counted as one law and v.20 as a separate law, the num ber will be thirteen; and if v.20a be counted as one law and 20b as a separate law, the number will be fourteen.</page><page sequence="25">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 25 that the statement of v. 28b that these laws are ten in number either has no significance whatsoever and is a very late editorial gloss,3S or it records what may have been the actual number of laws in the original K document, and indicates, moreover, that these have been amplified by later additional laws and possibly also by rearrangement of the original laws. Only the complete analysis of these laws can determine which alternative is correct, and at the same time establish whether v. 28b was a part of the original K document or not.37 As I have shown elsewhere,38 w. 29-35 have no connection whatsoever with the K document. They are a piece of J2 writing, worked over and partially reinterpreted by a later Priestly editor. They were probably a J2 substitution for a passage of the original K document, presumably of rather brief extent, which told how Moses informed the people of Yahwe's decision to make a cove nant with them and to take them as His people and bring them to a good land, and of his reading to them the laws of the covenant which he had written down at Yahwe's bidding. Thereupon must have followed the account of the solemnization of this cov enant by the people. Without this there would have been an altogether incomprehensible lacuna in the K narrative. This whole account of the solemnization of this covenant, in all likeli hood, paralleled closely the similar account preserved in Ex. 24.3-8. This account, we shall see in the proper place, belongs to the Book of the Covenant, a document which has manifestly close relationship to K. 36 Designed to harmonize this account of the giving of the law with that of the giving of the ten commandments in Ex. 20.1-17, by representing this as merely the repetition of those laws, after the breaking of the first tablets, just as the J2 editor of 34.1-5 attempted to do. But in such case the simplest and most intelligent procedure would have been to make no mention of the "ten com mandments" here, since such mention was in no wise necessary, and any reader could see that it did not tally with the actual number of laws in the final form of this code, as we find it at present in vv. 14-26. 37 Cf. below, pp. 96 ff. 38 "Moses With The Shining Face," HUCA, II (1925), 1-27.</page><page sequence="26">26 JULIAN MORGENSTERN Ill SUMMARY. Here we may pause profitably for a moment in order to take stock of the results gained and to analyze further the contents of the original K document, as we have reconstructed it thus far. It is clear that what we have here is only a fragment of the original document, and that the remainder has been suppressed by the J2 redactor in favor of the undoubtedly closely parallel narrative of the J code. But what is preserved here is the very nucleus and heart of the original K document, containing as it does the K account of the establishment of the covenant between Yah we and Israel upon the basis of the laws of Ex. 34. Previous to this Israel was not yet Yahwe's people. Moses, apparently, stood in a certain relation to this Deity, although it was not sufficiently close for Moses to have been made acquainted with the Deity's true name. Upon what grounds this previous rela tionship of Moses with Yahwe rested, will be determined later. The missing portion of the narrative had told how Moses had brought Israel up from Egypt, through the desert, unto this mountain. This he was competent to do, as we have seen, because he must have made this double journey from Egypt to this moun tain and then back again, at least once before. Moreover, Moses had brought the people to this mountain, not by chance, but purposely. It had been the fixed goal of his journey from the moment when he, with the people, had come forth from Egypt. Now why should Moses have purposed thus to bring Israel all thé way from Egypt, through the desert, to this mountain? Apparently it was a barren peak in the midst of a sterile wilder ness, and it was almost a foregone conclusion that it could not be a permanent home for Israel. Why then should Moses have troubled to come to this barren mountain at all? We may sur mise that perhaps it was because this was the only road through the desert which Moses knew; therefore he led the people as far as he could, and trusted to chance or something else, that they would be enabled to journey in safety onward from this mountain until they should at last arrive at and settle down in some land suitable</page><page sequence="27">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 2 1 for permanent habitation. Undoubtedly there would be a certain measure 01 truth in this assumption. But far more probably Moses had a different and a larger and more immediate purpose in deliberately bringing the people all the long and painful journey through this desert unto this moun tain. Manifestly it was no ordinary mountain. In Num. 10.33a, which, we shall see, is a part of the K document, this mountain is called explicitly הר יהוה, "the mountain of Yahwe." It could have borne this name for only one reason, viz. because Yahwe was thought to dwell upon it. It must have been at, or in the immediate vicinity of, this mountain that Moses had himself personally come into previous contact with Yahwe, and now, quite plainly, he brings Israel to this mountain purposely, no doubt hoping and expecting that in some way he will be able to bring Israel under the protection of this Deity, who dwells upon this mountain. This conception of Yahwe originally dwelling upon a sacred mountain in the desert is by no means new or strange in the history of the religion of Israel. That it is a basic idea in the E code is clear from the E narrative of Ex. 3.39 Moreover in I Ki. 19, as we shall see, we again have the idea expressed very clearly, that Yahwe dwells upon a mountain in the desert, which is there, following the E terminology, called Horeb. Then, after Moses has brought the people to this mountain, for some reason, in all likelihood connected with some uncon scious and involuntary violation of the ritual sanctity of the place, probably stated in the original K document, but now lost, since that portion has been suppressed by the J 2 redactor in favor of the story of the golden calf in Ex. 32, Yahwe commands Moses to lead the people whom he had brought up from Egypt away from the mountain. Apparently Moses' hopes and plans have failed. 3י Cf. my "The Elohist Narrative in Exodus 3.1-15," AJSL, XXXVII (1921), 242-262. Also from the use of the term הר האלהים in Ex. 18.6 and from the epithet שכני סנה in Dt. 33.16; for, as Ex. 3. 1-4 shows, this סנה was conceived of as being upon a certain mountain in the desert. Furthermore, Deut. 33.2 and Jud. 5.4 likewise represent Yahwe as dwelling originally, not in Canaan, but in the desert of Sinai and in Edom, and as coming actually from Sinai and Mt. Paran.</page><page sequence="28">28 JULIAN MORGENSTERN He asks of Yahwe a guide through the desert beyond the moun tain, since he himself is no longer competent to lead the people, for the country beyond the mountain is entirely unknown to him. In response Yahwe promises that His Panim shall lead the people and relieve Moses of that grievous burden and responsibility. Moses at first misunderstands this term Panim, fails to realize that it is a technical term, a title, and interprets it in its ordinary physical sense. And so he asks, "Let me see Thy face." But immediately the answer comes back, "Thou canst not see My face, for no man can see My face and live." Nevertheless, Yahwe will make a further concession to Moses' importunity. Though Moses cannot behold His face, Yahwe will still permit him to see His back, and will also reveal unto him His true, divine name, hitherto entirely unknown to Moses. And so at Yahwe's bidding, Moses takes his stand in the cave upon the mountain. Yahwe covers the mouth of the cave with His hand as He passes by. Then when He has passed on, He removes His hand and Moses catches a glimpse of His back, while His face remains unseen. And at the same time Yahwe calls out His true name before Moses. Awed by all this Moses prostrates himself before Yahwe. But still he persists in urging his final petition. What this may have been we can easily surmise, even though the statement of the original K document here has been suppressed in favor of the J 2 statement of 34.9. There Moses again urges Yahwe to accom pany Israel upon its journey from this mountain. It is the same petition which J2 represents Moses as making in 33.15-16. But this petition could not possibly have stood in the K narrative, for it would have been illogical to have proposed that Yahwe leave His sacred mountain and accompany the people on its journey, without having first established the logical basis for such a peti tion and claim, viz. a covenant between Yahwe and Israel. Prob ably in the original K document what stood here was the urgent petition of Moses to Yahwe to enter into covenant relation with Israel. In fact just this seems to be implied in the use of the participle כרת in Ex. 34.10a. At any rate, the K narrative now continues with Yahwe's promise or consent to establish such a covenant. He will be Israel's God and will agree to protect and</page><page sequence="29">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 29 care for Israel, and bring it to a good land where it might dwell forever in peace and plenty; and in return Israel must obligate itself to worship Yahwe, and Him alone, in accordance with the principles of His worship as set forth in the laws which Yahwe now reveals to Moses. At Yahwe's bidding, Moses writes down these laws, in order, manifestly, that he may report them exactly to the people and also to preserve them for future reference. Then must have followed in the K narrative the account of the acceptance by Israel of these laws and the solemnization of the covenant between Yahwe and the people. And finally, as we shall see, there must have been the account of Israel's journey from the sacred mountain, led by Yahwe's Panim, and their final approach to, conquest of, and settlement in the good land, which Yahwe had promised to them as a part of the obligation imposed upon Him by the terms of the covenant. With this the K narrative and document may well have ended. Now, in this narrative as we have reconstructed it thus far, several significant facts stand out. First there is the fact of Yahwe Himself. He is here depicted as dwelling upon a certain mountain out in the desert. Appar ently He is inseparably associated with this mountain ; it is His permanent and unchangeable abode; for the story implies very clearly, even without the J2 amplifications, that when Israel finally does journey away from the mountain, under the leader ship of the Panim, Yahwe Himself does not accompany them, but remains behind upon His mountain, just as He had been before Israel's advent thither. For had the original K narrative not told, or at least implied, just this, the J2 revision could never have related that Moses twice urged Yahwe to journey along in Israel's midst; for the J code proper told consistently that Yahwe was not at all bound to a single desert mountain upon which He dwelt, but rather that He dwelt on high, apparently in heaven, and only descended from there occasionally in the form of the pillar of cloud to confer with Moses at the door of the "Tent of Meeting," and that He Himself was present with and led Israel on the entire desert journey from the Red Sea onward in the form of the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night. Clearly the original K document must have told, and it must</page><page sequence="30">30 JULIAN MORGENSTERN have told it very positively and explicitly, that this mountain in the desert was Yahwe's permanent abode, and that even after Israel, now His people, by reason of the covenant between them, had journeyed onward, He continued to dwell upon His sacred mountain. Even more significant is the conception of Yah we which is expressed in this K document. He has a face, a back, a hand, a voice and a name. He passes by the cave in a purely physical manner, and, so that Moses may not behold His face, He covers the mouth of the cave with His hand. Very clearly Yah we is here depicted in human form. It is perhaps the most thorough-going anthropomorphic representation of the Deity that we find in the entire Bible; perhaps the only other picture which may be com pared to it in this respect is that in Gen. 3.8, of Yahwe walking in His pleasure garden in the cool part of the day. Moreover Yahwe is here represented not only in human form, but also in human form of gigantic size, since His hand is sufficiently large to cover the mouth of the cave in which Moses is standing. But appar ently this human shape is inseparably associated with Yahwe, and He is powerless to change it at will for some other form less anthropomorphic and material, such as the pillar of cloud or fire of J or the K'bod Yahwe of P ; for when He wishes to reveal Him self to Moses, and yet at the same time keep His face hidden, the only procedure possible is purely physical, to cover Moses' eyes with His hand as he passes by, and then, when His face is no longer turned in Moses' direction, to remove His hand and let Moses catch a glimpse of His receding back, while His face remains at the same time invisible. Just why Yahwe's face may not be looked upon by mortals and why to do so means death, is not told; only the bald fact is stated, and we can only guess at the probable reason. Ex. 34, 29-35 implies that the reason for this was because of the unbear able radiance emanating from Yahwe's face. But, as we have shown, these verses are not at all a part of the original K docu ment, but are the work of J2, amplified by a later Priestly writer. And furthermore, the very thought of these verses contradicts the statement of the K narrative that Moses could not and did not see Yahwe's face, for they tell, or at least imply very clearly and</page><page sequence="31">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 31 positively, that the dazzling radiance of Moses' face, upon which Israel might not gaze, had been imparted to it by reflection from Yahwe's face, upon which Moses must therefore have gazed, according to this J2 account, while conferring with Yahwe. We must, therefore, infer that the reason implied in 34.29-35, that Moses could not look upon Yahwe's face, viz. because of the blind ing and killing radiance emanating from it, was not necessarily, and probably not at all, the reason conceived of by the authors of the K document for Yahwe's face being invisible to mortals. Possibly there was some idea of primitive taboo connected with it, but what this taboo may have been, we cannot even imagine. Significant also is the account here of the revelation of the divine name Yahwe. The implication is clear that, according to the K narrative, Moses did not know and had never before heard the actual name of this Deity of the mountain. Manifestly this is the K parallel to the Elohist account of the revelation of the divine name in Ex. 3, the Priestly account in Ex. 6, and the J conception of the divine name having been known since the time of Abraham40 or even since the time of Sheth.41 The K account here agrees with the accounts of both E and P that the divine name Yahwe was first revealed to Israel through Moses, and that before this time Israel had not known this name. It goes, how ever, one step beyond both E and P in this connection, and states very positively that not only had Israel not known the name of Yahwe before this, but furthermore, not having known the name, it could also not have worshiped Yahwe in any way before this time. In this the K document is far more logical than either E or P, and also in far greater conformity with the fundamental prin ciple of Semitic religion, that not until the true name of a deity is known can sacrifices and supplications be directed to him and his worship begin. And it is also more logical and consistent than these two documents in representing the revelation of the divine name, with its implication of the beginning of the worship of Yahwe, as immediately preceding the making of the covenant between Yahwe and Israel, and as the step indispensably requi site to the establishment of this covenant, whereas both E and P 40 Gen. 12.7. 41 Gen. 4.26.</page><page sequence="32">32 JULIAN MORGENSTERN represent the revelation to Moses of the name Yahwe as having been made before he went down to Egypt and several months before the solemnization of the covenant between Yahwe and Israel at Horeb-Sinai. That the Elohist writers felt the logic and the imperative need of a statement or re-statement of the divine name as the immediate precursor and natural introduction to the solemnization of the covenant and the declaration of the prin ciples of the worship of Yahwe by Israel, is evidenced by the formal repetition, seemingly as an official and conventional act, of the name Yahwe in Ex. 20.2, immediately preceding the Ten Commandments. Quite obviously the K account of the revela tion of the divine name is more natural and logical, and presum ably therefore also more original, than either the E or P account. Of equal interest and significance is the cave upon the mountain. As has been said, it is not a cave, a chance cave, in which Yahwe places Moses, used for this one occasion alone. It is the the cave, the well-known cave, "the cave of the mountain," apparently used regularly for some definite purpose. This cave is not the particular dwelling-place of Yahwe, for Yahwe does not come out of it nor go into it. Instead He passes by in the open space in front of the cave, while Moses, awaiting the vision of Yahwe's back and the revelation of the divine name, and what ever additional message Yahwe may choose to impart, stands in the mouth of the cave. What could this cave have been, and what purpose could it have served? Additional light will be thrown upon this problem, and the interpretation of the K narrative, as we have reconstructed it, will be strikingly confirmed by a careful analysis of I Ki. 19.3-14. IV I KINGS 19.3-14. In this chapter the first thing which strikes one is the fact that vv. 9b-llaa offer an unnecessary and tautological duplication of vv. 13a/3—14. Moreover vv. 9b-1 laa are improperly placed, come entirely too early in the narrative, while vv. 13a/3-14 are in their logical and proper position. Accordingly practically all</page><page sequence="33">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 33 scholars have, undoubtedly correctly, held these verses to be secondary.4' But if these verses be secondary, and so indicate late revision of the chapter, the possibility exists that other passages in the chapter may likewise be secondary. Now in this chapter the one thing that immediately arrests the attention of almost every reader is the remarkable theophany described here, with the wind, the earthquake and the fire as the majestic precursors of Yahwe; and then follows the sound of the soft whisper. The actual mean ing of this last detail is uncertain. Does it mean that this soft whisper is Yahwe Himself, that, in other words, Yahwe is here depicted in a manner so ultra-spiritualized, that in this respect it far surpasses anything else in the entire Bible; Yahwe so spiritual that He has not even the vaguest and thinnest form and sub stance, but is only a whisper? Not even the Kebod Yahwe of P, the fiery form enveloped in the cloud, which, according to P, Yahwe assumed whenever He chose to commune with mortals, a conception self-evidently the product of the strong and positive anti-anthropomorphic principles of the Priestly Code, can com pare with this in spirituality. And it would be futile to believe that at the time of Elijah, or even in the century or so imme diately thereafter, in which the nucleus of this story must have been written down, a conception of the Deity as spiritual as this could have existed. Certainly we may not interpret this as meaning that this soft whisper is Yahwe Himself, that He is here depicted as a whisper and nothing else. Presumably, therefore, this whisper is to be regarded as coming from Yahwe. In contrast to the roar, the tumult and the awfulness of the wind, the earthquake and the fire, Yahwe's voice is still and soft; yet this very quality of stillness and softness makes it more impressive and even more awful than the roar of the elements. Even this is indeed a grand and spiritual concept. Yahwe is here represented as the lord of the universe, the master and controller of all the elements. He is not the storm, nor the earthquake nor the fire, nor is He even in them ; but He is above them; He controls them, uses them for His own purposes,sends 42 Cf. both Benzinger and Kittel to the passage. Both scholars hold that 9-1 la, and not merely 9-1 laa, are secondary.</page><page sequence="34">34 JULIAN MORGENSTERN them ahead of Him as the heralds of His coming. This entire picture of Yahwe and the theophany here are conceived in broad and lofty, spiritual lines. But could it actually have been Elijah's conception of Yahwe, or even that of the author of the original form of this chapter, who probably lived within a century or so after the prophet's death? In the main, the answer to this question can be only sub jective. It is difficult indeed to imagine that before Amos, Hosea or Isaiah such a conception could have existed in Israel, and have found expression so clear-cut and positive, even at the hands of a religious and literary genius. Such a representation of Yahwe as the lord of all the universe, the master of all the forces and elements of nature, we find in no other passage of this earliest period of Hebrew literature. In itself it certainly accords much more perfectly with the universalistic thought and theology of an age considerably later than the 9th or the first half of the 8th centuries B. C. Moreover a moment's consideration brings to light a certain discrepancy or incongruity, a literary disharmony as it were, which seems to disclose a join or patch but inelegantly or imper fectly executed. If according to v. 12 Elijah, still within the cave, hears the whispering voice of Yahwe, we expect to learn then and there the words which Yahwe is speaking to him at that moment. But instead, v. 13 goes on to tell that when Elijah hears, though it does not tell what he hears, he first wraps his face in his mantle and then goes out and stands at the entrance of the cave, and only then does Yahwe speak to him. In other words, in its present context, the reference to the whispering voice comes a bit too soon. The narrative would have been more logically consecutive had it told that, attracted by the wind, the earthquake and the fire, which he recognizes as the precursors of Yahwe's coming, Elijah covered his face with his mantle, and went and stood at the entrance of the cave, and only then and there did he hear the soft, whispering voice of Yahwe speaking to him, "What dost thou here, Elijah?" And actually just this is what v.l3b does tell. There again we read that a voice calls to Elijah and asks, "What dost thou here, Elijah?" It is noteworthy that the article is omitted he!re, that it is a voice, and not the voice, not the "still,</page><page sequence="35">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 35 small voice" of v.12b; for had it been this, the article would have been absolutely indispensable. Unquestionably the soft whisper is a secondary element in this narrative, along with the wind, the earthquake and the fire. Moreover, it is noteworthy that when we omit the entire reference to the three elements and the soft whisper we get a simple and straightforward account of the theophany, with all the romantic and spiritualizing elements removed, it is true, but likewise with the above-cited disharmony completely obviated, and the whole altogether in accord with what was in all likelihood, the thought and theology of Elijah's own day and of the period immediately following. The resultant text, beginning with v.9a would then read ; ויבא שם אל המערה וילן שם : והנה יהוה עבר— ויהי כשמע אליהו ו'לט פניו באדרתו ויצא ויעמד פתח המערה והנה אליו קול ויאמר מה לך פה אליהו; ויאמר קנא קנאתי ליהוה כי עזבו בריתך בני ישראל. Nothing could be simpler, more complete and more direct than this. • And with this as the original text, it can be readily seen how easily the pas sage could have been expanded to its present form by the inser tion of vv. 9b-llaa and lla7~12. It is clear that this theophany here bears a striking resem blance, complete in practically every essential detail, to the theophany of the K document as we have reconstructed it. In the first place, the question arises, why does Elijah make this long and arduous journey through the desert to this moun tain? The answer is simple. With his life endangered by Jezebel's ceaseless persecution, discouraged and despairing of the success of his prophetic labors, Elijah feels the need of commun ing directly with Yahwe. How can this be done? In only one way. Again the procedure is purely and primitively physical. He goes directly to the mountain out in the desert, where, as he believed still in his day, Yahwe was actually dwelling. For Elijah Yahwe had not yet taken up His abode in the Temple at Jerusalem, nor even in the land of Canaan. He still resided on His sacred mountain in the desert, where Israel had found Him at the time of Moses and the exodus from Egypt. Elijah's point of view is still that of the half-nomadic shepherd from the east of the Jordan, or, as we shall see, of the likewise half-nomadic Kenite or</page><page sequence="36">36 JULIAN MORGENSTERN Rechabite of southern Judah, rather than that of the inhabitant of the settled, agricultural land of Palestine, particularly of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. And just because the Deity is thought to actually dwell upon this mountain, it is called in v.8 הר האלהים, "the mountain of God," the customary Elohist desig nation, just as the K document, as we shall see, calls it הר יהוה, "the mountain of Yahwe." The next fact of significance is the cave upon the mountain. Here too, just as in the K document, we have the sacred mountain upon which Yahwe resides, and upon this is the cave. Moreover, here too, just as there, this cave is not the actual spot upon the mountain in which in particular Yahwe dwells, but far rather it is the cave in which the ardent worshiper, awaiting a revelation from the Deity, remains, and at the entrance of which he takes his stand, at the actual moment of revelation, while Yahwe passes by in the open space in front of the entrance to the cave. Furthermore, here too, just as in the K document, this is no chance cave into which Elijah happens to enter in order to pass the night. Here too it is the cave, designated even at its very first mention as the cave, with the article, the well-known cave. It can hardly be doubted that the cave of the K document and the cave of I Ki. 19 are one and the same." Moreover, the facts that in both passages the cave is deter mined, i.e. is indicated to be the well-known cave, and that in both its use is identically the same, viz. as the place in which the expectant worshiper awaits, and at the mouth of which he receives the revelation from Yahwe, justify the inference that this cave was used for this purpose not merely upon these two occasions, but regularly; that, in other words, in the worship of the Deity of this mountain a kind of incubation was regularly practiced. All worshipers who desired direct communion with and revelation from Yahwe would pilgrim to this mountain and there, just as Elijah did, pass the night in the cave. Then, at the proper mo ment, Yahwe would pass by in the open space before the cave, « This, too was the opinion of the Rabbis (cf. Pesafiim 54a) and of the mediaeval Hebrew exegetes, Rashi and Kimfii.</page><page sequence="37">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 37 and the worshiper standing within the entrance of the cave would receive the revelation, just as he desired.44 Furthermore, in this narrative Elijah covers his face with his mantle. The reason for this, though not stated, is self evident. He does this just before he takes his stand at the mouth of the cave, preparatory to receiving the revelation from Yahwe, and just as Yahwe approaches and is about to pass by. Undoubt edly the motive is the same as in the K document ; no man may look upon Yahwe's face and live, Elijah no more so than Moses.45 But if no man can look upon Yahwe's face, then presumably here, too, we have the underlying conception of Yahwe conceived of in human form, with a face and a voice, and likewise with the other parts and members of a human body, just as in the K narrative. And finally, here too we have, in v.14, the covenant between Yahwe and Israel, the fundamental obligation of which upon Israel is manifestly that Israel shall worship neither Ba'al nor any god other than Yahwe. We shall see that this was the first law of the K code, and the primary obligation assumed by Israel in entering into covenant with Yahwe, as described in the K document.46 י" Ralbag, the mediaeval Jewish exegete, explains the article in המערה in v.9 by saying that this cave upon the mountain was there, or perhaps better, was known, from of old. It is strange indeed that modern Biblical scholars, apparently without exception, should have ignored completely the presence of the article in המערה in v.9, at the very first mention of the cave. Apparently this cave played a certain role in Mohammedan tradition. As-Sanhûrî tells that the cave of the prophet Shu'eib, i.e. Jethro, lay on the hag-route from Cairo to Mekka, the fifth station after 'Alfabat Aila, and all told twenty-nine and one-third hours journey from Akaba. (Cf. Fliigel, in ZDMG, 18 [1864], 529, and Meyer, Die Israeliten und Ihre Nachbarstamme, 314.) 45 Similarly Pirhe de Rabbi Eliezer, 33 tells that no woman could look upon the face of Elisha. Therefore, when addressing him, the Shunamite woman stood in the door of his room, upon the roof of her house, in order that she might not see his face. 46 Both Benzinger and Kittel would omit נריתן in v. 14, and instead read עז ברך ברך, on the ground that LXX omits it entirely in v.10, while in v.14 it read apparently both עזבוך and בריתך. This argument is cogent in a way; but inas much as all the other versions as well as MT read only בריתך, and that LXX too has this reading in v. 14, it seems better to abide by the reading of MT and</page><page sequence="38">38 JULIAN MORGENSTERN In other words this theophany in I Ki. 19, briefly described though it is, agrees completely in every essential and distinctive detail with the theophany of the K document as we have recon structed it. In both we have the same sacred mountain in the desert, upon which Yahwe dwells; in both Yahwe is conceived of in human form; in both we have the same, well-known sacred cave upon the mountain in which the worshiper awaits alone,47 and receives the desired revelation from Yahwe; in both we have the same procedure or technique of revelation; in both the wor shiper cannot look upon Yahwe's face and live; in both Yahwe passes by in the open space in front of the cave and calls out His divine word as He passes by; and in both we have the covenant between Yahwe and Israel, the primary obligation of which is that Israel shall worship no other god. This evidence, furnished by this analysis of I Ki. 19, corrobo rates fully the interpretation we have given of the theophany of the K document. Unquestionably the two narratives are closely related. The character of this relationship will be determined later. This much, however, seems certain, that the narrative of the K document tells among other things, how the knowledge of this sacred cave and its use was revealed to Israel. Moses was the first Israelite to have used it in order to secure a revelation from Yahwe. This, however, does not preclude the possibility that it may have been used for the same purpose by members of some other tribe or tribes even before Moses, for already to Moses it is "the"Ihe cave of the mountain." And after Moses this cave continued to be used by chosen devotees of Yahwe in Israel, such as Elijah, who pilgrimed thither in order to commune directly with Yahwe and secure an immediate revelation from Him. And according to both the K and J codes, as we shall see, when Israel journeyed away from the mountain of Yahwe, it took with it the "Tent of Meeting," an artificial reproduction of the sacred cave upon the mountain, in order to enable it to commune directly with its retain בריתך. Moreover, the alteration of an original עזבו בריתך to a later עז בי ך עז בי ך would be simpler and more comprehensible than the reverse process. 47 Hence the motive in I Ki. 19.3 that Elijah leaves his personal attendant behind at Beer Sheba and makes the remainder of the journey alone.</page><page sequence="39">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 39 Deity and secure revelation from Him. For just as at the sacred cave Moses or Elijah stood in the entrance to the cave, while Yahwe passed by in the open space in front, and while passing revealed His divine message to His devotee, so with the "Tent of Meeting" in the K and J codes, in no wise a place of sacrifice, but only of consultation of the oracle and of revelation, Moses, as the functioning oracular priest, stands in the door of the "Tent of Meeting," while Yahwe descends in the form of the pillar of cloud, and, of course while standing outside the "Tent," converses with Moses, and reveals to him His divine message.48 Having thus, by this analysis of I Ki. 19, justified completely our reconstruction and interpretation of the theopany of the K document, we may now return to the latter. VV num. 10. 29-33a. We have seen that the K document must have told of Yahwe's promise to Moses and Israel to be their God and to prosper them in every way and to bring them at last through the desert unto a good land as the goal of all their journeying. This was His part of the covenant obligation established between them. Moreover, He had promised to send His Panim as the guide to lead them onward from the mountain through the desert to the promised land. Obviously the K narrative would have been distinctly incomplete without the account of Yahwe's fulfillment of His promise in at least these two particulars. We have also seen already that what remains of the K docu ment in the Hexateuch is merely a fragment of what was origin ally a considerably larger booklet. The greater part of this has been suppressed by the J 2 editor who incorporated the remaining portions into the J code. He did this because, in the main, as we shall see, the account of the Exodus and the journey through the wilderness in the two documents were strikingly similar, and to have incorporated the entire K document would have meant only useless and weakening repetition of what was already •8י For a detailed discussion of this interesting subject, cf. "The Tent of Meeting," J AOS, 38 (1918), 125-139.</page><page sequence="40">40 JULIAN MORGENSTERN recorded in the J code. But it may well be that some additional fragments of the original K document have for one reason or another been preserved in the Hexateuch. It is our task now to consider this question. It is an established and almost universally accepted fact of Biblical Science that Ex. 35.1-Num. 10.28 constitute in their entirety a part of the Priestly Code. Consequently before the composition of the Priestly Code, and its combination with the older codes of the Hexateuch, Num. 10.29 ff. followed imme diately upon Ex. 34.35.49 Now it is significant that Num. 10.29-33a contains a fragment of a narrative which at first glance seems to stand entirely by itself and to have little or no connec tion with any of the main documents of the Hexateuch. The narrative tells that Moses turns to Hobab, his brother in-law,50 and says, "We are journeying to the place of which Yahwe has said, 'I will give it to you'; come with us, and we will treat thee well, for Yahwe has promised good concerning Israel." But he answered, "I will not go, but I will go unto my land and my birth-place." But Moses said, "Do not leave us, for just because you know how we must encamp in the desert, you shall be unto us as eyes ; and if you do go with us, then the good which Yahwe will do unto us we will share with you." Then they journeyed from the mountain of Yahwe for three days. Here the story breaks off very abruptly. Yet it is not at all difficult to reconstruct its conclusion with great probability, if not with absolute certainty. The story must have gone on to tell that Hobab hearkened to Moses' request and accompanied Israel on its journey and guided it safely through the desert until it reached the goal of its journey, the place which, as Moses said, Yahwe had promised to give them. For, had this not been the 49 Or rather upon the form which this passage had before its revision by Priestly writers: cf. "Moses with the Shining Face," HUCA, II (1925), 1 27. s° In another work, now in preparation, entitled Birth, Marriage, Death and and Kindred Occasions among the Semites, I have brought abundant evidence to prove that the original meaning of ד1תן was "brother-in-law" and not "father in-law," and that in the K document, unlike the later J and E codes, it still retains its original meaning. Accordingly Hobab was Moses' brother-in-law.</page><page sequence="41">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 41 sequel of the story, the point of the entire incident here, of Moses inviting Hobab to be their guide, would have been lost com pletely. And that this was actually the outcome of the story is proved by the fact that two passages, Judges 1.16 and 4.11 tell that the tribe of Hobab, the brother-in-law of Moses, was dwelling with Israel, and in close affiliation with them, although still main taining its old nomadic or semi-nomadic life. The former passage relates that the Kenites accompanied Judah upon its migration to the entrance into southern Canaan, while the latter passage states that Heber the Kenite had separated from the main body of his tribe, the followers of Hobab, the brother-in-law of Moses, dwelling presumably in the south, and had migrated northward in typical nomad manner, and had pitched his tent near Kedesh Naphtali. Moreover, I Sam. 15.6 records the tradition thât at the time of Israel's exodus from Egypt, the Kenites had shown kindness unto Israel. It does not state what this was, but in the light of the evidence already adduced, there cannot be the slight est doubt that this kindness was just the guidance of Israel through the desert unto the promised land. And from all this evidence we may conclude with absolute certainty that the original narrative in Num. 10.29-33a must have gone on to tell that Hobab allowed himself to be persuaded by Moses' importun ities, and that he and his tribe did accompany Moses and Israel on their journey through the desert, and guide them through the to Moses and Israel unknown country lying between the moun tain of Yahwe and the promised land; and they were indeed unto Israel, even as Moses had said, eyes in the desert,51 since they knew the country and its wells and the consequent camping places. But the question is still unanswered, are these verses, Num. 10.29-33a, a fragment of the original K document? It is clear that they cannot belong to either J, E or P, for they tell that Israel was guided from the mountain of Yahwe to the promised land by Hobab and the Kenites, whereas the P document told that Israel was led by Yahwe Himself in the form of the K'bod 51 It is interesting to note that Doughty (Arabia Deserta, II, 62) says of his Heteymy guides, "They were eyes to me in the desert."</page><page sequence="42">42 JULIAN MORGENSTERN Yahwe;Yahwe; the E document told that Israel was led by the Mal'ak Yahwe;Yahwe; and the J document told that Israel was led upon its entire journey from Egypt to the promised land by Yahwe Him self in the form of the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night.52 This fact alone is enough to indicate that these verses can belong to neither J nor E nor P, for they present a contradic tion to the narratives and to basic theological principles of all three documents which is absolutely irreconcilable. Either these verses must stand absolutely alone, independent of any connec tion with any other document or narrative of the Hexateuch, or they must be correlated with the K document and narrative. The former hypothesis is, of course, almost preposterous; the latter is simple and reasonable and has everything to corroborate it. In the first place, as we have seen, Num. 10. 29-33a formed in the period before the composition of the Priestly Code the direct continuation of Ex. 34. As a narrative it must have been the sequel, either of the J2 legend of Moses with the shining face, with which obviously it has not the slightest connection, or of the main K narrative. With this is accords in every detail. In Ex. 33.12a Moses says to Yahwe, "Behold You command me, 'Lead this people away,' but You have not told me whom You will send with me." It is almost impossible to translate את אשר by "what," or any word other than "whom." Seemingly Moses expects at first that Yahwe will provide a human guide to lead Israel onward from the mountain. Such would be the simple and natural procedure. For just as Moses in purely human manner has been able to lead the people from Egypt as far as this mountain, so the normal and expected thing would be to secure another human guide, who, knowing the country beyond the mountain, can lead Israel onward in precisely the same manner. Just this is the implication of v. 14 also, when Yahwe replies, "My PanimPanim shall go, and I will give thee rest." The weighty respon sibility of safe guidance, which has rested so heavily and weary ingly upon Moses thus far, will now be taken from his shoulders and be laid upon the Panim; he shall now bear the burden in quite the same manner as Moses has borne it thus far, i.e. in purely "Cf. "Biblical Theophanies," ZA, XXV (1912), 139-193, and XXVIII (1915), 15-60.</page><page sequence="43">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 43 human manner. This thought of human guidance for Israel through the desert beyond the mountain is in glaring contrast, as we have seen, to the varying, yet obviously related traditions of divine guidance of the J, E and P codes. But just this thought of human guidance for Israel is dominant in Num. 10. 29-33a. Moses requests his brother-in-law, Hobab, the Kenite, to be their guide through the desert lying between the mountain of Yahwe and the promised land; and he requests this just because Hobab is thoroughly familiar with this country, and, knowing how they would have to encamp at the wells in the desert, he can be to them for eyes, and locate these wells for them. Certainly in this motif of simple, human leadership Num. 10. 29-33a accords perfectly with the seeming thought of Ex. 33. 12a and 14, while at the same time it differs absolutely from every other docu ment and tradition of the Hexateuch. In the second place the allusions in Num. 10.29-33a to what must have been the course of the narrative of the K docu ment, are unmistakable. There, we are told that Israel is journey ing toward a definite goal, the place which Yahwe has promised to give to them, and that, moreover, Yahwe has promised to bestow good upon them. Just these, as we have seen, must have been the obligations which Yahwe assumed, as His part of the mutual covenant between Himself and Israel, as the original K document recorded. Here we have the explicit reference to the mountain by the name, "Mountain of Yahwe," i.e. impliedly the mountain upon which Yahwe dwelt, in the manner indicated in the original K document. And finally, we have in Num. 10.33a the beginning of the account of Israel's journey from the mountain onward through the desert, just as, as Ex. 33.12a tells, Yahwe commanded Moses. In view of all this very significant evidence, and the conse quent completeness of accord of the thought of these verses with the narrative of the K document, and in view also of the absolute divergence of the thought of these verses from that of any other document or tradition of the Hexateuch, we need not hesitate for a single moment in assigning these verses to the K document with a feeling of absolute certainty.</page><page sequence="44">44 JULIAN MORGENSTERN But this conclusion carries with it certain consequences of far-reaching significance. On the one hand, the K narrative tells that when Moses, evidently expecting a human guide, asks Yahwe whom He will send, Yahwe replies that He will send His Panim. That Panim is here used in a technical sense, we have already determined. Then in the sequel of the story, in Num. 10.29-33a, Moses turns, quite simply and directly, to his brother-in-law Hobab, and asks him to guide Israel through the desert, and Hobab does so. There can be only one conclusion from this; Hobab, the brother-in-law of Moses, must have been the Panim of Yahwe. But how could the term Panim have come to be applied to Hobab? In one respect the answer is not difficult ; but in another respect no definite answer can as yet be given. Both the J and E documents, which, as we shall see later, are in many of their details of the Moses-story dependent upon this tradition recorded in the older K document, tell that the התן of Moses was a priest, the כהן of his tribe, or as both the J and E documents put it, the "priest of Midian."53 Here כהן undoubtedly means, not pri marily the sacrificer as in the P Code, but rather the interpreter of the divine oracle, and consequently the mediator between the Deity and the people. As the כהן Moses' התן stood in unques tionably close and intimate relations with a deity, and functioned as the interpreter of the oracle of this deity and his champion in comparison or combat with other deities. Just this is the role which Jethro, Moses' התן, plays in Ex. 18 (E). On the one hand, he acts as the master of ceremonies when sacrifices are offered to Yahwe. Moreover, he rejoices exceedingly when he hears how Yahwe has discomfited and prevailed over the gods of Egypt; and in his joy he exclaims (v.ll), "Now I know that Yahwe is the greatest of all the gods." It is not the cry of a hitherto half convinced and hesitating convert to a new faith, but rather the exultant shout of an old and loyal worshiper and champion of Yahwe, proud of his God and His power, and glorying in His triumph over His rivals; and finally, it is Jethro who counsels ' Ex. 2.16 (J); 3.1 and 18.1 (E).</page><page sequence="45">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 45 Moses with regard to the general and extended use of the oracle of of Yahwe among the people, in order to decide cases at law. Man ifestly the designation of the התן of Moses as כהן is no mere idle or complimentary title, but rests upon a firm basis of historical and literary tradition. Moreover the god of whom the התן of Moses was the priest was, according to E, the deity of the mountain out in the desert called Horeb, or the "Mountain of God," '5.הר האלהים' It is the same mountain and the same deity which we encounter in I Kings 19 and here in the K document. We must conclude, therefore, that, even though in the fragments which are preserved, no explicit statement thereof occurs, none the less the K document, too, represented Moses' התן as the priest of the deity of this mountain, i.e. as the priest of Yahwe. We must therefore conclude further that Panim or P6ne Yahwe was the regular technical term and title for the priest of Yahwe, and that when Yahwe promised Moses that His Panim should lead the people, He had in mind His priest, Hobab. Therefore, when coming to comprehend his first misinterpretation of Yahwe's word, פני ילכו, and the true meaning of the term, Moses turns to Hobab and requests him to act as guide.ss 5454 EX. 18.5. 55 To some it may seem inconceivable that Moses should have married Hobab's sister and dwelt with him in his tribe for a considerable period with out having known Hobab's official title, P'ne Yahwe. Yet had he known this title, he would also have known with it the actual name of the Deity whom Hobab and his tribe worshiped, the same Deity with whom Moses and Israel entered into covenant at the sacred mountain, according to this K document, as we have reconstructed and interpreted it. But according to the K narrative, Moses did not know Yahwe's name until it was revealed to him by Yahwe Himself preliminary to the solemnization of the covenant. Therefore also he could not have known Hobab's title, P'ne Yahwe, previously to tnis. Of course it may at first thought seem strange that Moses should apparently have gone down to Egypt charged with the heavy task of bringing Israel out from there by a god whose very name he did not know. But this motif is not without its significant and convincing parallel. For the Elohist Code (Ex. 3. Iff.) tells prac tically the same thing, that Moses was charged to go down to Egypt by a god whose name, he did not know, and only in the course of the conversation at tendant upon this charge did he learn that the name of this Deity was Yahwe.</page><page sequence="46">46 JULIAN MORGENSTERN But how could Panirn have become the official title of the priest of Yahwe? To this question no definite answer can as yet be given, and only the very vaguest conjectures can be offered. It may be that in origin the term had some connection with the idea of Kibla, or turning the face toward the deity in worship. Or by some remote possibility the term may be equivalent in meaning to, and a contraction of an original Kenite equivalent of the Babylonian alik paniJ6 Or, perhaps, we might correlate the term Panim here with the oft-cited פן בעל and similar compounds of 57,פנים and interpret the word in such expressions as meaning "representative." Or, perhaps, we may correlate this title of the priest of Yahwe with the fact that, according to K, Yahwe's face might not be gazed upon by mortals. His priest then, upon whom alone mortals might look with impunity, would be His natural repre sentative and substitute, and might quite naturally bear a title suggesting that particular part of Yahwe which he replaced in contact with mortals. Perhaps some slight confirmation of this last conjecture may be found in the late J2 tradition appended to this K narrative in Ex. 34.29-35, that Moses' face shone with a radiance, as we have seen, impliedly like that which exilic and post-exilic traditions pictured as emanating from Yahwe's entire being, and certainly in this one tradition, particularly from His face. In other words, this tradition says practically this, that Moses' face was like Yahwe's face, dazzlingly radiant, and per There is nothing at all surprising or improbable in the thought that Moses, a member of a different tribe and merely a sojourner in the Kenite tribe under the conditions of beena marriage, should not have known the name of the Kenite tribal god, of whom his own brother-in-law was the priest. Among the primi tive Semites the names of their gods were powerful forces, with which potent, magical effects were produced; therefore they were not to be used too freely nor to be bandied about lightly, and least of all to be revealed to men of other tribes, even though sojourning in their midst. Accordingly both K and E agree that, even though he had dwelt among the Kenites for some time, Moses did not know Yahwe's true name until it was revealed to him by Yahwe Himself. Consequently, too, according to K he could not yet have known Hobab's official title. 56 Delitzsch, HWB, 531, "governor, officer." 5' Cf. Bertholet, Kulturgeschichte Israels, 58 note 3.</page><page sequence="47">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 47 haps also, by a slight extension of the figure, that Moses too was "the face of Yahwe." All the traditions and documents earlier than the Priestly Code agree in representing Moses as the priest of Yahwe in the desert period. Accordingly, in the K tradition he too, as the priest of Yahwe, may have come to bear the title of פני יהרה יהרה, and this title may in turn have eventually given rise to this late tradition of Moses with the shining face. All these, it must be admitted, are pure conjectures, rather far-fetched and with but the most absolute minimum of evidence to justify even their presentation. Yet they indicate that the title, "Face of Yahwe," for the priest of this Deity is not without the possibility of a reasonable explanation. But although lack of sufficient positive evidence does not enable us to determine just what the real origin of this peculiar title was, there is little reason to doubt that פני יהוה was the actual title of the priest of Yahwe, according to the K document, and that furthermore, when in 33.14 Yahwe says, "My Panim shall go," He has in mind His priest, Hobab, Moses' brother-in-law. Therefore, as soon as, on second thought, Moses comprehends the true meaning of Yahwe's promise, he turns to Hobab, with his request to lead Israel onward through the desert.58 How Hobab happened to be present so opportunely will be determined later. 58 In Num. 10.29, the words בן רעואל המדיני are undoubtedly a J2 gloss. Both Judges 1.16 and 4.11 speak of the ו1תן of Moses as the Kenite, and the latter calls him by name just as here; but it does not call him בן רעואל המדיני. According to this passage it is Hobab who is Moses' ]Oh and not Re,u'el the Midianite. On the other hand, Ex. 2.18 (J) gives Re'u'el as the name of Moses' חתן: while Ex. 3.1 ;.4.18; 18.1,5,6 (E) give יתרו (or יתר) as the name of Moses' ד1תן. Unquestionably these are three separate names, not to be har monized in any way. The name Hobab is characteristic of K. Consequently the words בן רעואל המדיני must be a gloss, introduced to harmonize the J statement that Re'u'el was the ד!תן of Moses with the K implication that his name was Hobab. According to Eduard Meyer, the name of Moses' father-in law must have been Kain, and the name of Hobab ben Re'u'el is the result of later harmonization [Die Israeliten und Hire Nachbarstdmme, 90). For another, altogether different and extremely far-fetched and fanciful interpretation of the name Hobab, cf. Haupt, "Midian u. Sinai," ZDMG, 63 (1909), 512. Moreover, in this sentence the words י!סן משה must refer to Re'u'el and not to Hobab, and</page><page sequence="48">48 JULIAN MORGENSTERN One other significant fact the assignment of these verses to the K document brings forth. Num. 10.33a says, "They jour neyed from the mountain of Yahwe a three-days' journey. . ." Here, as has been said, the K document, or rather, the fragment thereof which is preserved in the Bible, breaks off abruptly. What happened at the end of this three-days' journey is not stated, and can only be inferred. But one surmise lies so ready to hand that it cannot be avoided ; it seems so natural and probable. It is that at the end of three days of travel Israel reached the goal of its journey, the place which Yahwe had promised. One thing is certain, the K document knew nothing of a long wandering and a protracted sojourn, of forty years more or less, in the wilder ness. It clearly implied a direct and not very long journey from the mountain of Yahwe to the place which Yahwe had promised to give to the people. The place could not have been very far removed from the mountain of Yahwe, for after all, even though He had proved Himself a powerful deity, none the less He was still,still, according to the K document, a local deity, whose power at the most could reach out from the mountain as a center only over a territory of a certain restricted radius. He had proved Himself equally powerful against other peoples and nations and their gods at a like distance in all directions from the mountain. Just how far Egypt was from the mountain we cannot say» since the K document gives no indication of the location of the mountain other than this. But we may infer very safely that the mountain lay at a spot south of Palestine, apparently a three days' march from its southern border, and presumably almost equidistant from Egypt. This inference seems justified by the reference to the three days' journey in Num. 10.33a. Undoubtedly the K document therefore must be a part of the gloss; otherwise we would expect the simple ד1תנו. Furthermore, in both the J and E passages ד1תן has the meaning "father in-law," for Ex. 2.16-22 (J) states explicitly that Moses married the daughter of Re'u'el, the priest of Midian, while Ex. 18.5f. seems to imply this. On the other hand ד01ן as used in Jud. 1.16 and 4.11, and as implied also in Num. 10.29ff., has the older and more fundamental meaning "brother-in-law."</page><page sequence="49">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 49 must have told of the entrance of Israel, or at least of a part of Israel, into Canaan from the south, and consequently of the con quest of this southern part of the country by Israel and its settle ment therein. This tradition has its definite parallel in the later codes. In fact Num. 21.1-3 tells explicitly of the actual conquest of a district in the extreme south of Canaan, centering about Hor mah, by Israel, impliedly under the leadership of Moses. It relates that in the first battle Israel was defeated by the Canaanites, but that because of a vow Yahwe finally gave it victory over its enemies, as a result of which, Hormah, or Arad, as it had been called pre viously, passed into its possession. Nor was this a mere momen tary conquest, for Jdsh. 12.14; 15.30; 19.4, although, of course, ascribing the capture of Hormah to Joshua, none the less state explicitly that it became thereby a permanent possession of Israel. This is the implication of I Chron. 4.30 also. Moreover, Num. 14.45 and Deut. 1.44 tell that Hormah was the base of operations of Israel in its first, vain attempt to enter Canaan from the south. And most significant for this study, I Sam. 30.29f. suggests that at the time of David Hormah was immediately contiguous to that district of southern Judah in which the Kenites were dwelling, while Jud. 1.16f. records first, that the Kenites entered Canaan from the south in company with Judah and settled in the Negeb of Arad, and then that in company with its fellow-tribe Simon Judah conquered Hormah. Manifestly the Bible contains many ancient and unquestionably authentic traditions of the entrance of Israel, and specifically of the tribes of Judah and Simon, in com pany with the Kenites, into Canaan from the south and of their speedy conquest of and settlement in and about Hormah. On the other hand, Num. 14.39-45 (JE) records the tradition that the tribes of Israel did attempt to enter Canaan from the south, but because of the duplicity of the twelve spies and their own small faith, Israel forfeited Yahwe's protection, and so suf fered defeat at the hands of the inhabitants of the land, and was driven back. In consequence it was forced to go about the long way around Mt. Se'ir, and only after forty years of grievous wan</page><page sequence="50">50 JULIAN MORGENSTERN dering through the desert did it approach again and enter the country from the east. This tradition was repeated with certain minor modifications and embellishments by both D5' and P60. Very clearly this tradition of the defeat of Israel when it at tempted to enter Canaan from the south is late and had its origin in the endeavor of late writers to harmonize the old tribal tradi tion of an entrance, or, as they now put it, an attempted but frus trated entrance, into Canaan from the south under the leader ship of Moses with the nationally colored and generally accepted tradition of their day of the entrance of Israel into Canaan from across the Jordan to the east under the leadership of Joshua. They could maintain the latter tradition only by either ignoring completely the tradition of an attempted entrance from the south, just as P actually did, or by relating this attempted entrance but representing it as a failure and not as a success. Unquestionably the tradition of the faithless spies had its origin in just this forced attempt at harmonization.61 Manifestly the K document too told of the attempt of the tribes, or at least of certain tribes, of Israel, to enter Canaan from the south. But it knew nothing of Yahwe's anger against them and of their defeat on this occasion, but only of their complete victory under Yahwe's protection and favor. Unquestionably, the K document recorded the tradition in its original and more historically correct form.62 This is strong evidence of the relatively 59 Deut. 1.41-46. 60 Cf. the Priestly portions of Num. 13 and 14, which, however, apparently ignore completely the tradition of the actually attempted entrance of the tribes of Israel into southern Canaan and their humiliating defeat, and merely tell of the treachery of the spies, the little faith of Israel, and of the sentence of death in the desert imposed in consequence by Yahwe upon all who had come forth from Egypt, in order to motivate the tradition of the forty years' sojourn in the desert. 61 So also Meyer, Die Israeliten und Ihre Nachbarstamme, 134; Gressmann, MoseMose und Seine Zcit, 295. 62 Quite clearly this portion of the narrative of the K document must have paralleled the fragment in Num. 21.1—3 closely. This raises the question, whether these three verses may not be regarded as a fragment of the original K document. This is, however, not probable; for, on the one hand, as scholars have pointed out, the verses contain unmistakable stylistic indications of J authorship, and on the other hand, it is hardly likely that the K document,</page><page sequence="51">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 51 older date and greater originality and larger historical value of the K document in comparison with J and E.63 VI exodus 4. 24-26. One othei passage in the Pentateuch, very short, it is true, but of great significance in many respects, may be assigned to the K document with reasonable certainty. We have seen that only a fragment of the original K docu ment is preserved in the Pentateuch, and that the remainder has been suppressed by the J2 editor in favor of the closely parallel and related J narrative. The opening portion of the K document, we have learned, must have told among other things of Moses' journey from the vicinity of the mountain of Yahwe, where he had been sojourning with the Kenite tribe into which he had married, down to Egypt, in order to lead forth the children of Israel from there. Now in Ex. 4.24-26 a little incident is narrated, strangely archaic in character, and which has obviously no connection at all with the surrounding narratives nor with any of the main docu ments of the Hexateuch. In another work now nearing comple tion, I have treated of these three verses in detail, and need not repeat here all that is said there.64 The verses tell that on the journey at the circumcision,63 Yahwe attacked and sought to kill with its motif of Yahwe's absolute promise, as His part of the covenant, to bring Israel to and give it a good land, would have told of a first defeat of Israel by the Canaanites, and of its recourse to a vow to ensure Yahwe's favor and cooperation, as these verses do. According to Eduard Meyer (Die Israeliten und Ihre Nachbarstamme, 64, 91) the goal of this three days' journey was Kadesh. This is, however, merely a gratuitous assumption. It is self-evident that K, and probably the oldest J version of the desert wanderings also, knew nothing of a protracted sojourn at Kadesh, or for that matter of any sojourn there at all, but only of a direct march from the mountain of Yah we in the wilderness to southern Canaan and immediate entrance of the land at that point. 64 Birth, Marriage, Death and Kindred Occasions among the Semites. 6s 3ן!ל1ן, malôn, fratalân form from מול, and not a makfal form from לון (note also the article).</page><page sequence="52">52 JULIAN MORGENSTERN the young son of Moses and Zipporah. But Zipporah quickly took a flint and cut off the foreskin of her son and threw it at Yahwe's feet, while she said (to her son), "Verily thou art a blood relative unto me." Whereupon Yahwe left the child alone. On that occasion she said66 "Blood-relative" at circumcision. These versions are assigned by all scholars with practical una nimity to J. Moreover, almost all agree that the pronouns in this passage refer to Moses, that it was Moses' life which was threat ened by Yahwe, and which was saved by the prompt action of Zipporah in circumcising her son. We need not repeat here the detailed proof we have given elsewhere that it was not Moses' life, but that of the child, which was endangered, and that in these three verses Moses is not referred to in any way. But had it been Moses whose life was thus threatened by Yahwe, then it would be extremely difficult to account for the anomalous fact that according to J (Ex. 3.2-4a, 7-8, 16-4. 16, 19-20) Yahwe has sent Moses on this important and difficult misssion, and yet when Moses is barely started upon his journey Yahwe seeks to take his life, and thereby would frustrate completely His main plan and purpose. Were it Moses whose life was endangered by Yahwe, this fact alone would suffice to indicate that these three verses could not be the work of J, nor for that matter of E nor P either. This one difficulty is of course obviated when we understand that Moses is not referred to at all in these verses, and that it is the child's life which is here threatened by Yahwe. With this the main, concrete objection to assigning these verses to J is obviated. But on the other hand there is not the slightest ground whatsoever for assigning these verses to J any more than to E, for the use of the name Yahwe for the Deity is not characteristic of J alone, since, as we have seen, it is used constantly by K also.67 Nor is there present in these verses any other characteristic, stylistic or otherwise, of the J writers. On the other hand, these verses have not the slightest con 66 For the first time, and thereby impliedly inaugurated the custom of the mother reciting this formula at circumcisions. 6767 This leaves out of consideration the moot question whether, after his account of the revelation of the divine name in Ex. 3, E ever uses Yahwe for the Deity, or persists in using only ,Elohim.</page><page sequence="53">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 53 nection with the thought of either the J or E codes, and clearly disturb the continuity of the narrative. Ex. 4.27—3168 is mani festly the continuation of the J narrative in vv. 1-16. Vv. 17-26 contain unrelated fragments from different sources. Vv. 17-18, 20b and 27b are unmistakably E. Vv. 19 and 20a are equally obviously of J origin, yet at the same time not a part of the main J document ; instead they are patently secondary and harmonistic. Likewise vv. 21-23 are manifestly secondary and harmonistic, but whether RJ or RD as Baentsch suggests, it is difficult to determine. None of these verses contains a single new detail of the story of the Exodus. But vv. 24-26 are altogether different in character. They narrate an incident which is altogether new, and which has not the least connection with either what precedes or what follows, nor with any other incident or event of the exodus-story as we have it at present. There can, accordingly, be little, if any, more reason for assigning these verses to J than to E or P.69 Furthermore, since these verses tell that Zipporah cast the severed foreskin of her son at Yahwe's feet, they probably picture Yahwe in human form, just as the K document does. Certainly the gross and seemingly anthropomorphic picture of Yahwe here does not accord at all with the characteristic, spiritualized con ception of J, that Yahwe dwells in heaven and descends only opportunely to observe or commune with mortals. This incident would accord far better with the fundamental idea of the K docu ment that Yahwe, in a gigantic human form, dwells upon a certain mountain in the desert, close to which Moses and Zipporah chance to pass on their journey down to Egypt, and accordingly 68 Omitting 27b. 6» These verses do tell of Moses' journey, accompanied by his wife and child. This has been one reason for assigning these verses to J rather than E; for E (Ex. 18.2ff.) seems to have told that Moses had two sons at this time, and that they and his wife had remained with her father, while Moses went back to Egypt; on the other hand J told of only one child (Ex. 2.22); moreover 4.20a tells that Moses took his wife and his sons with him on his journey; but as we saw, this verse is entirely harmonistic and secondary; the fact that his wife accompanied him is probably borrowed from this narrative in vv. 24-26, while the reference to his sons, in the plural, is probably borrowed from the E tradi tion in Ex. 18 (unless we change to 1בנ [with Baentsch et al]).</page><page sequence="54">54 JULIAN MORGENSTERN Yahwe, for some reason, at which we can only guess,70 tries to take the life of their child, but is prevented by the act of Zipporah in in in quickly circumcising him and throwing the foreskin at Yahwe's feet. At any rate this much is certain, that this little narrative accords not at all in thought and theology with either the J, E or P documents, while it does seem to accord in its conception of Yahwe, in its general archaic character, and at least in the detail that Moses is on the journey down to Egypt, with the K docu ment. This is indeed scanty evidence, but that scantiness is very plainly due to the extreme brevity of this passage, but three short verses. There are ample reasons why these verses cannot be J, E or P.7' There are no reasons at all why they cannot be K; and there are some slight but positive indications that they must either be assigned to K or else be regarded as a fragment of some independent and otherwise altogether unknown and unevidenced source. In the light of all this argument it seems justifiable to regard these verses as a part of the K document, a short fragment of the opening, narrative portion of that work.72 VII THE LAWS Having completed the preliminary analysis of the narrative portion of the K document, we are now prepared to undertake a similar study of the laws. The problems here are complex and difficult. In the main they may be summed up as twofold, (1) whether there were ten original laws in this little code, or if not ten then just how many there were, and what these original laws may have been, and (2) what was the relation of this little code י° I have discussed this in detail in Birth, Marriage, Death and Kindred Occasions Occasions among the Semites. 1י Cf. also Luther, in Meyer, Die Israeliten und Ihre Nachbarstdmme, 114f. "2 Not impossibly v.26b may be the work of J2. The narrative would be complete without it; moreover the use of the word מולת for "circumcision" instead of 9ל1ן&gt; as in v.24, is suspicious. Furthermore, the passage has a very striking resemblance in thought and form and in the use of אז followed by the perfect, to Gen. 4.26b, undoubtedly the work of J2. The verse seems to tell</page><page sequence="55">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 55 of laws (a) to the code of laws in the Book of the Covenant in general, and in particular to certain laws of that Book with which these laws coincide almost word for word, and (b) to the code of ten laws in Ex. 20, 2-17. It will be well to consider the first half of the second question first, viz. the relationship of the laws in Ex. 34 to the parallel laws in Ex. 20.23-23.19. For before we can answer the questions whether there were in the K code of Ex. 34 ten original laws, and if so what they may have been, we must first determine whether these laws are in their original form, and also whether they are earlier or later than their parallels in the Book of the Covenant. This in itself is a most difficult and complicated problem ; and the answers given by Biblical scholars have been almost as many and as varied as the number of investigators themselves. In general scholars have assumed that in the main the K code of laws in Ex. 34 is the original and the older, and that the parallels in Ex. 20-23 are dependent and therefore younger. For the most part they have assumed this almost gratuitously or because of the fact that the laws of Ex. 34 are altogether ritual istic in character, while the corresponding laws in Ex. 20-23 are only a part of a much larger code of laws in which the ethical principle plays quite as important a role as does the ritualistic, if not even more so ; for they tacitly assume that in the course of the historical evolution of religion the ritualistic principle necessarily precedes the ethical; therefore, the purely ritual K code must necessarily be older than the combined ritual-ethical C code. But while, broadly-speaking, the assumption of the precedence of the ritual over the ethical element may be true in general, the conclu sion drawn from this by no means follows necessarily; and the originality and greater antiquity of the laws of K as compared with the corresponding laws in C, while hypothetically probable, is a matter still to be finally proved. that this incident narrated in vv. 24-25, marked, not so much the beginning of the rite of circumcision in Israel, as rather that of the custom of the mother of the child reciting at the circumcision the regular formula, כי חתן דמים אתה לי (Cf. Birth, Marriage, Death and Kindred Occasions among the Semites). Such interest in the origins of various rites and institutions is a marked charac teristic of J2.</page><page sequence="56">56 JULIAN MORGENSTERN On the other hand, Eerdmans™ has concluded that not only does Ex. 34 contain no decalogue, and that it is later than and dependent upon the laws in Ex. 20-23, but also that it must be of post-exilic authorship. He bases this conclusion upon several assumptions, a number of which are open to serious question, and upon a partial, and on the whole rather incomplete and one-sided analysis of some of the laws and a comparison of them with the corresponding laws of Ex. 20-23. The principle underlying this comparison is indeed sound. Indeed it is the only principle to be followed. But his treatment is by no means adequate, and, despite quite a number of correct and important deductions, his main conclusions are not in the least convincing ; in fact they give somewhat the impression of being unduly shaped to fit a fantastic, pre-conceived hypothesis. These views represent the extremes of opinion. Between them lie varying shades of conclusion, both positive and negative in character, constituting the contributions of scholars of high repute to the solution of this intricate problem. But these opin ions are of so wide a range, and the evidence upon which practic ally all of them are based so surprisingly scanty, that actually they have succeeded in accomplishing little more than to make "confusion worse confounded." It is, therefore, fitting indeed to take up the problem entirely anew, and with complete independence of all previous investi gâtions and conclusions. The unquestionable relationship existing between the laws of K in Ex. 34 and the corresponding laws of C in Ex. 20-23 becomes self-apparent when we place these laws alongside of each other in tabular form. For the sake of convenience, and since it is the basis of comparison, we arrange the laws in the order in which they occur in Ex. 34, and number them accordingly. But from this it by no means follows that this was the original number, order or grouping of the laws, or that this was the original content of the individual laws.

It is self-evident that 34.24, which has no parallel whatsoever in 23.17f., as might at first have been expected, is not a law at all, but purely a hortatory expansion which bears all the earmarks of Deuteronomic authorship. The same is true also of the hortatory expansion of the first law in 34.14a by the addition of vv. 14b-16. Here the Deuteronomic style and argu ment are even more self-apparent, as is readily acknowledged by all Biblical scholars. And not only in K, but also in C as well, is there evidence of late, largely Deuteronomic, redaction in connection with the laws there related to those in K. Thus 23.12b, giving for the obser vance of the Sabbath practically the same humanitarian reason that is found in Deut. 5.14b-15, is in all likelihood the result of Deuteronomic expansion. The same is probably true of v. 13a. Likewise in vv. 10b and 1 la/3b we probably have a Deuteronomic expansion of the original, simply stated law of the Sabbatical year. From this it is clear that for some reason or other Deuter onomic writers had a peculiar interest in these two codes of law, and did not hesitate to expand them here and there by character istic, hortatory insertions of considerable length. And if they did not hesitate to take this, to us seemingly considerable liberty, we may safely assume that likewise they did not hesitate to take corresponding liberties in the way of revision, at least of a minor character, of the original text itself. It is likewise worthy of note that in addition to these laws paralleling those in K, C contains two additional laws similar in ritual character and in form to the other laws, which have no parallels at all in K, viz. the law in regard to the altar in 20.24-26 and the law in regard to the Sabbatical year in 23.10-11. Moreover, while the last four laws of the two codes, as we have arranged them side by side, agree exactly in relative order and likewise fairly closely in wording, the other laws differ radically both in relative order and in wording. This is especially noticeable in the laws dealing with the three festivals. In C the laws for the three festivals are grouped together, naturally in the temporal sequence of the festivals in the course of the agricul</page><page sequence="59">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 59 tural year, with a common introductory clause שלש רגלים תחג לי בשנה. But it is significant that as the text stands now וחג הקציר and וחג האסיף in 23.16 are absolutely without any governing word, and are therefore literally untranslatable. The problem raised thereby will be discussed fully in the proper place. It suffices for the present merely to have shown that the laws as we find them at present in C are not, at least not all of them, by any means in their original form, but have undergone considerable revision of an internal as well as of an expansive character. When, on the other hand, we turn to the laws concerning the three festivals in K, we find far greater confusion. True, we do not have the difficulty of nouns standing without any governing word; grammatically everything seems to be in perfect order. But what is far more disturbing, the natural connection of the laws for the three festivals is broken, seemingly with utter lack of logic, by the insertion of the long and complex law dealing with firstlings and by the law of the Sabbath. This arrangement can certainly not be original ; it must be instead the result of internal revision. In short, neither code of laws is preserved in its original form. Both have manifestly undergone revision, and revision of a far larger character than is apparent at first glance. Our first task therefore must be to determine, as closely as is possible by careful and minute comparison of the laws as they stand at present in the two codes, their original wording and order. The task is difficult indeed, and in many cases an absolutely final answer to the various questions which will arise cannot be given. Since it is always expedient to begin with the simple and advance to the complex, it will be well to disregard the present order of the laws either in K or C, and commence with the com parison of those laws which are simplest in form and in which the divergences are slightest. Law XI is the same not only in these two codes but also in Deut. 14. 21b. There, however, it appears in a connection alto gether different from that in which it occurs in these two codes. In these not only is its wording identically the same, but its order with relation to the remaining laws likewise. The exact meaning of this law is a moot question. It is uncertain whether it refers to</page><page sequence="60">60 JULIAN MORGENSTERN the preparation of flesh for food in the ordinary sense, as it is usually interpreted, or whether it expresses a prohibition in con nection with sacrificial procedure, as Eerdmans maintains;74 nor is it possible with the present insufficient evidence to determine this matter finally. Nor can we gain any information of value for our own particular study, from a comparison of these two iden tical texts. Likewise law X is exactly the same in both codes. But the con sideration of it gives rise to two questions. On the one hand, the law in 22.28a, מלאתך ודמעך לא תאחר, seems to offer a partial parallel to this law, in that it commands the sacrifice at the proper time of the first-fruits of the oil- and wine-presses. On the other hand, the question arises, is not law X an unnecessary and tautological duplication of law Via, commanding the celebration of the festival called respectively קציר and שבעת? For both versions of law VI, at least in their present forms, make explicit reference to the first fruits; and the sacrifice of the first-fruits of the grain harvest was the basis and characteristic feature of the celebration of this festi val. It is impossible to conceive of this festival without the sacri fice of these first-fruits. Consequently we may well believe that the command to observe this festival carried with it and enjoined sufficiently the sacrifice of the first-fruits, and that therefore law X is altogether tautological and superfluous. The suspicion therefore becomes quite strong that law X is not a part of the original code, but is in both C and K the result of the same process of expansion by Deuteronomic writers which we have already noted. In such case בית יהוה אלהיך could mean only the one, single, central sanctuary at Jerusalem; and actually when we consider the expression carefully it is difficult to conceive that it can mean anything else, that it could refer to the many, local, pre-Deuteronomic shrines scattered throughout the coun try; these would surely have been referred to in some manner other than by the singular בית יהוה. We may therefore with fair assurance set law X down as a late, Deuteronomic insertion into the two codes. The same conclusion holds true of law VII, likewise identical I Op. cit., 89.</page><page sequence="61">THE THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 61 in both codes, with the single exception that in Ex. 34 the words אלהי ישראל are added. Obviously these two words are a gloss.75 The three occasions for the appearance of all the males in Israel before the Deity must have been, of course, the three great annual harvest festivals, as the position of this law here and again in Deut. 16.16, following immediately after the legislation for the three festivals, clearly implies. In fact, Deut. 16.16 states this very plainly. From its position and context therefore the verse seems to be not an independent law, but merely a summary or amplification of the legislation for the three festivals. Furthermore, from I Sam. 1 it is clear that in the early pre monarchic times, at least in Ephraim, festival pilgrimages to the large sanctuaries took place, not three times, but only once, during the year.7' Outside of these two verses in these two codes there is not in the entire Bible the slightest evidence of the prac tice of more than one annual pilgrimage to the large and im portant sanctuaries before the Deuteronomic period. Moreover, had the custom of pilgriming upon the three annual harvest festivals to the great national sanctuary, or even to the great local sanctuaries, such as Gilgal and Beersheba, of which the prophets speak, been firmly established at an early time, none the less these pilgrimages would have been only incidental to the main célébra tion of these three festivals, and no legislation would have been " LXX adds אלהיך in 23.17, just as in Deut. 16.16, and in both codes it omits, or rather suppresses, significantly enough, the rather surprising title of Yahwe, האדן, again just as in Deut. 16.16. 76 Perhaps from I Ki. 12.26-30 the inference might be drawn that by the time of the division of the kingdom the pilgrimage up to Jerusalem had become an important institution in the life of the people, and not improbably of more frequent occurrence than once a year. Yet this inference would scarcely be justified. For these verses obviously do not present the true reason for Jero beam's restoring the two great sanctuaries at Dan and Bethel. That was altogether a political and a practical, religious necessity. And the reason which the verses give smacks rather of a Deuteronomic point of view. It is not at all likely that even under Solomon the Temple at Jerusalem was the established, legalized center of the annual festival pilgrimage or pilgrimages of the people from all parts of the country, as these verses imply. The local shrines served this purpose instead. Therefore we must conclude that I Ki. 12.26-30 are altogether Deuteronomic in point of view and do not in any way evidence a three-fold annual pilgrimage to Jerusalem in the early monarchic period.</page><page sequence="62">6262 JULIAN MORGENSTERN necessary beyond the mere general command to celebrate the three festivals, which we have earlier in both codes. In fact, in the days of the local shrines, i.e. in the pre-Deuteronomic period, such a command as this would have been utterly without reason and incomprehensible. The local shrines lay so ready to hand, and, as I Sam. 1 shows, and as is amply attested by additional evi dence, the festival visits to these shrines were occasions of such rejoicing and mirth, that no particular command to visit the local shrines three times a year, could have been required. The very command here implies that the festival pilgrimage was a duty difficult and exacting, which the ordinary person, and particularly he who would have a long journey to go, would occasionally, if not frequently, seek to evade, were it not enjoined upon him in plain and imperative manner. In other words this very command here implies the pilgrimage to the single central sanctuary, just as is in fact plainly stated in the Deuteronomic version of this law in Deut. 16.16. Accordingly we must infer, not only that this is in itself no separate law, but also that it is of Deuteronomic origin, a Deuteronomic amplification of the legislation for the three festivals, just as we find it in Deut. 16.16, and that it is closely related in origin and character to Ex. 34.24, which for other suf ficient reasons we have already set down as the work of Deuter onomic writers.77 'ל Inasmuch as 23.17 and 34.23 are certainly Deuteronomic, it is difficult to account for the presence of the peculiar and striking title here applied to Yahwe, האדן. The term אדן with the article seems almost to point to the con ception of an agricultural deity of the Adonis-Tamuz type. That a later age came to regard this term as of non-Yahwistic, idolatrous origin is indicated by the omission of the term from Deut. 16.16 and from the LXX version of these two verses. This so consistent omission cannot have been accidental; it can be due only to a consciousness of non-Yahwistic, idolatrous association. In all likelihood the expression לראות את פני האדון (but whether to be read as a Kal or Nif'alNif'al it is difficult to say. Perhaps the Kal was originally read; and the change to the reading of the Nif'al here served a twofold purpose, to soften an other wise very gross anthropomorphism, and also to differentiate the expression by one additional degree, from its origin in the theoretically idolatrous practice of the local shrines. On the other hand, the fact that Deut. 31.11 and Isaiah 1.12 have the Nif'al punctuation, לךאת and I Sam. 1.22 has ונו"^ה [which could not possibly be vocalized as Ifal, since in such case we would expect וך$ה] speaks</page><page sequence="63">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 63 We turn now to the Sabbath legislation, law V, in 34.21 and 23.12 respectively. The differences between the two versions of the Sabbath law are slight, but not without significance. In the first place, there is a difference of one expression in the wording of the primary portion of the law; and in the second place, the conclusion of each version of the law is different. We have already inferred that 23.12b is a Deuteronomic addition to the original law, which in this version read simply ששת ימים תעשה מעשיך וביום השביעי תשבת. We may likewise conclude that 34.21b is similarly a later expansion of the original, simply stated law, although not necessarily, nor even probably, of Deuteronomic origin. It does not of course qualify the original law by stating that only in ploughing-time and harvest-time must the people abstain from work upon the seventh day, but rather that even in these two seasons, the busiest of the agricultural year, when every moment almost is precious, and the people might therefore be tempted to disregard the Sabbath, they must still observe the law punctil iously. Obviously the gloss at least applies the law to a civiliza tion in which agriculture is the dominant occupation. This is confirmed by the verbal difference between the pri mary portions of the two versions of the Sabbath law. 34.21 uses the term תעבד whereas 23.12 uses תעשה מעשיך. Assuming a direct relationship between these two so similar bodies of law, this difference in these two expressions can hardly be accidental or meaningless. תעבד implies agricultural activity par excellence, and is equivalent to the fuller expression תעבד את אדמתך. On the other hand תעשה מעשיך, particularly with the latter word used in the plural, implies a multiplicity of economic activities, commer cial in all probability as well as agricultural. From this we con elude again that the version of the law in 34.21 sprang from an environment in which agriculture was a dominant occupation, rather decisively for the Nif'al as the original.) was in the days of the local shrines the technical term for visiting the sanctuary. (In fact we might almost paraphrase I Sam. 9.9 and say, לפנים בישראל כה אמר האיש בלכתו אל המקום לכו וןךאה את פני האדן, probably adding the local name of the deity.) The expres sion was still used in Deut. 16.16 by the Deuteronomic writers for want of a better term. And later, as we have said, the grossness of the original term was softened by the omission of האדן.</page><page sequence="64">64 JULIAN MORGENSTERN and in which the people had scarcely passed beyond this stage of economic development, whereas the version in 23.12 was the product of an environment in which the people no longer followed a simple agricultural life exclusively or almost exclusively, but were likewise engaged in commercial or other economic activities, presumably of a fairly wide range. The version in 34.21 is there fore the product of the simpler and more primitive cultural envir onment, and is, accordingly, at least in a relative economic sense, the earlier of the two versions. Whether it is actually earlier in point of time remains to be determined. A similar conclusion may probably likewise be drawn from the two versions of law VIII. Here, too, the difference is slight, a a matter of but a single word. 34.25a uses the term תשחט where 23.18a uses תזבח. That the stem זבה was not unknown to the authors of 34.25a is proved by the use of זבחי. Yet again, assum ing a mutual relationship of the two versions of this law, the question arises, why does the one use תשחט and the other תזבח? At the most there seems to be but a slight shade of difference in meaning between שחט and זבח. Both words are used in Hebrew in the sense "to slaughter," both for profane and for ritual purposes. But between the two זבח seems to convey in Hebrew more of the idea of a ritual, and שחט more of that of a profane act. Since this law deals with sacrifice, the two words are used in the two versions respectively in a ritual sense. But it may well be that תזבח implies a more specific ritual slaughtering than תשחט, viz. slaught ering at the מזבח, the altar. We do know that in an early stage of Semitic religious practice sacrifices could be offered almost any where, or that at the most any suitable and convenient stone might be employed as the place or medium of sacrifice.78 The fixed and frequently elaborate altar was a later development in Semitic civilization, the product of the period of the more ad vanced culture of settled communities. That the laws in C are the product of just such a culture as this is proved by the elaborate regulations for the construction and use of altars in 20.24-26. It is still a comparatively early age and culture here depicted. The simple altar of earth is the stand 78 Cf. Gen. 28. 18ff. ; I Sam. 7.9ff. ; 14. 33-35, and Robertson Smith, The Religion of the Semites,338 נff.</page><page sequence="65">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 65 ard altar. There seems to be as yet no conception of priests as the sacrificers for the people, or as in any way necessary to the sacri ficial act; rather the people still seem to offer their own sacrifices, even at the fixed altar. But while the altar of earth is still en joined as the standard altar, the more elaborate altar of stone is by no means unknown or unsanctioned. Stone altars may be employed, subject to two restrictions; they may not be built of hewn stones, for, for some reason not stated, the use of iron instruments would defile them. Nor may they be built with steps, by means of which the sacrificer might ascend upon them. Now it is significant that 20.24 commands the offering of all sacrifices upon the altar. The implication seems to be indeed that sacrifices may be offered at no place other than such an altar. And this lends weight to the inference that the use of the verb זבח in 23.18a implies sacrifice, not in any place whatsoever, but only at the altar, the מזבח, etymologically "the place of sacrifice." On the other hand שחט, the term used in 34.25a, in no way implies the use of the altar, although, it must be admitted, neither does it exclude such use. In itself the word is non-com mittal. But in the first place, the fact that in ancient Israel, as among the primitive Semites in general, sacrifices could be offered in any place whatsoever, with at the most the use of a single rough stone or a rude heap of stones as a kind of altar, or, perhaps better, as the forerunner of the altar, and entirely without the necessity of a fixed altar, even though only of earth, may well justify the inference that the use of the verb שחט here implies sacrifice in any suitable place, without regard to presence or absence of an altar thereby. And in the second place, the complete lack of any altar legis lation in K parallelling the extensive altar legislation in Ex. 20.24-26 tends to corroborate this conclusion. The argument from silence here is significant. For, since the legislation in both the K and C codes manifestly states what was conceived by their respective authors to be the fundamental principles of the true worship of Yahwe, and since the authors of Ex. 20.24-26 found it necessary to include altar legislation in their statement of these principles, the absence of similar legislation in the K code can indicate only that its^authors felt no such need, that in other</page><page sequence="66">66 JULIAN MORGENSTERN words, in their scheme of pure Yahwe-worship the altar played no essential and indispensable role. And finally, assuming a direct relationship between the two versions of this law, we can readily understand why the common use of the altar in the environment from which 23.18a sprang, in contrast to the seeming absence, or at least the apparent dispen sability, of the altar in the environment from which 34.25a sprang, should have necessitated a change of the general and colorless term תשחט, "thou shalt slaughter," in the latter passage to the specific תזבח, "thou shalt slay at the altar," in the former. In other words, we can readily explain the change of an original תשחט to a later and more specific תזבח, whereas it would be difficult indeed to conceive of a satisfactory explanation of the reverse process. So here, too, in connection with law VIII, the grounds seem ample for regarding the K version as mirroring the more primitive practice and consequently also the earlier cultural environment. Much the same conclusion can be drawn from a comparison of the two versions of law IX. The verbal differences themselves are wide, but the implications thereof are even farther reaching. The version in 34.25b deals only with the specific sacrifice of the Passover festival. It commands that none of this sacrifice, no portion whatsoever, remain over until morning. The sacrifice is unquestionably offered just at nightfall and must be completely consumed before sunrise. It is exactly the same prescription which we have for the Paschal sacrifice elsewhere in the Bible.7' Its meaning is obvious and permits not the slightest latitude in interpretation. In contrast to this the version in 23.18b is rather ambiguous. The temptation is strong indeed to yield to the influence of the parallel in 34.25b and interpret חגי as the Paschal sacrifice. But it would be only this parallelism and naught else which would suggest this interpretation. And were this the meaning of 23.18b, why then should it use at all the vague and uncertain חגי, where 34.25b is so specific in its use of זבח חג הפסח? Moreover, as a rule whenever חג standing alone refers to any one festival, it is of " Ex. 12.10; Deiit. 16.4.</page><page sequence="67">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 67 course not the Passover, but always the Succoth-festival. Here it seems quite sure that חג does not mean "festival," nor refer specifically to any one single festival, but rather means "festival sacrifice." Certainly this law has to do, not with the festival celebration itself, but only with the disposal of the festival sacri fice. In other words, the term חג is used here in quite a general sense, and seems to imply that at all the three annual festivals one and the same conventional festival sacrifice was offered, and that at all three festivals a uniform procedure obtained with regard to the time conditions affecting it. The reference to the fat of the sacrifice permits no other conclusion. For unquestionably the ritual procedure for the Paschal sacrifices found in Ex. 12, even though a part of the late Priestly Code, none the less mirrors the ancient practice with regard to this sacrifice. It was offered at the home, and not at a shrine. The blood was smeared upon the threshold, lintel and doorposts of the home, and the flesh was consumed by the family gathered within. The sacrifice was offered just at dusk, and had to be consumed completely, fat and all, during the night by the inmates of the house. It was the only sacrifice of ancient Israel which was regularly offered after nightfall.80 Just this is manifestly the procedure with the Passover sacrifice prescribed in 34.25b. But the specific mention of the fat of the sacrifice in 23.18b implies something altogether different, that the fat of the sacri ficial animal alone was given to the Deity, and the flesh was dis posed of in some other manner; presumably it was eaten by the sacrificer and his guests. Now in the ritual of the Priestly Code the fat was the portion of the "peace-offering" which was burned upon the altar;81 this unquestionably records ancient ritual pro cedure. Obviously therefore this law of 23.18b implies that the specific festival sacrifice, offered at each of the three annual festi vais, was of that class of sacrifices, later designated by the Priestly Code as zebafj, s lamim. Even more, it implies seemingly that this festival sacrifice belonged to that particular category of this class of sacrifices which the Priestly Code calls by the specific 80 This subject too I have treated in detail in Birth, Marriage, Death and Kindred Kindred Occasions among the Semites. 81 Lev. 3.3,9,14.</page><page sequence="68">68 JULIAN MORGENSTERN term zebah todah, "thank-sacrifice," the fat of which had to be burned upon the altar and the flesh of which had to be consumed completely by the sacrificer and his guests upon the day of sacri fice; nothing might remain until the second day.82 Actually this law in Ex. 23.18b says no more than that the fat of the festival sacrifice might not remain over until morning, that, in other words, it had to be burned upon the altar upon the very day upon which the sacrifice was offered. It says nothing directly about the disposal of the flesh. This may justify the inference that the flesh could be eaten on the next day or even later. But this is improb able. True, Lev. 7.16f. provides that the flesh of the zebah flamim,flamim, if offered as a free-will offering or in fulfillment of a vow, might be eaten on the second day also, though not later. But certainly the mandatory, annual festival-sacrifices were neither free-will offerings nor given in fulfillment of vows. In all likeli hood therefore the more rigorous discipline obtained with regard to them; and therefore presumably not only did the fat have to be burned, but likewise the flesh had to be eaten upon the day of sacrifice. Just this was apparently the procedure of Elkanah at Shiloh, when he offered his annual festival-sacrifice.83 These con siderations at any rate make it quite certain that 23.18b records the ritual procedure with regard to festival sacrifices in general, whereas 34.25b deals with the specific Passover-sacrifice alone. Yet there can be not the slightest doubt that the two laws are closely related, and even that the one is dependent upon the other. Nor can there be any question as to which is the original and which the dependent law. We can understand here the development from the specific to the general, from the specific Passover-sacri fice to the general and conventionalized festival-sacrifice, whereas the reverse process would be altogether incomprehensible. Un questionably 34.25b is older than 23.18b, and also 23.18b is directly dependent upon and represents a conscious and purposed modification of 34.25b. It follows from this that 34.25b must have originated in an environment where the old, characteristic Passover-sacrifice, undoubtedly of nomad, desert origin, must have been still observed with but little modification of its primi יי Lev. 7.15; 22.29L 8ג I Sam. 1.4.</page><page sequence="69">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 69 tive nature and purpose. On the other hand 23.18b must reflect the practice of a different and culturally more advanced environ ment, in which for one reason or another the old, nomad Passover sacrifice had been outgrown and largely discarded, and the prac tice had developed of offering in its stead a conventional festival sacrifice, in every respect like the sacrifices offered on the other anual festivals, and of course no longer at home but at neighbor ing local shrines. This conclusion is borne out by one other consideration. As we have said, the reference to the fat in 23.18b implies that this was burned upon the altar at the local sanctuaries. The altar is absolutely indispensable to this sacrificial act. This confirms our previous conclusion that in the ritual procedure which lies at the bottom of the C code the altar plays an important and funda mental role, whereas it seems to be nowhere implied in the legisla tion in K. Certainly the legislation in 23.18b, with its implication of the use of the altar, is in complete accord with the legislation regarding the altar in 20.24-26, and with it is the product of an environment with a relatively advanced ritual practice. Turning now to law I, we note a number of matters of inter est and significance. First, the reference to אל אחר implies, just as we have seen, that a definite statement as to who the Deity of this covenant was, must have immediately preceded this law; for otherwise the term אחר would have been meaningless, and the law itself would have had no significance whatsoever. Just this statement was implied in the revelation of the divine name Yahwe in 34.6a and in its continuation in 34.10a, the announce ment of Yahwe that He would make a covenant with Israel. In quite the same way, the first law in Ex. 20, that Israel shall have no other god, necessitates and naturally follows immediately upon the statement that it is Yahwe, Israel's God, who gives these laws and establishes this covenant. Manifestly this like wise is the natural and proper first law in the K code, and states the first and basic principle of the covenant between Yahwe and Israel. On the other hand, it is significant that the C code contains no exact parallel to this absolutely indispensable law. True it offers two partial parallels, but neither quite partakes of the char</page><page sequence="70">70 JULIAN MORGENSTERN acter of this law in K. 22.19 reads, זבח לאלהים יחרט בלתי ליהוה לבדו.

But 22.19 does not directly and absolutely prohibit the worship of any other deity as does 34.14a; instead it conceives of this as quite possible and probable, and merely prescribes the proper punish ment for this offense, something which 34.14a does not even suggest. As we shall learn in time, this is a kind of law altogether different in origin, character and form from the law in 34.14a, and may in no wise be regarded as parallel to it, or as an integral part of the original C code. Another seeming parallel to the law in 34.14a is found in 23.13b. It reads ושם אלהיט אחרים לא תזכירו לא ישמע על פיך. In the first place, actually this law does not prohibit the worship of other gods, at least not in the same direct and unequivocal manner as does the law in 34.14a; instead it merely forbids the pronouncing of the name of any other deity. True this would probably render impossible indirectly the worship of other gods, for such worship without the utterance of the name of the deity to whom the wor ship is offered, is inconceivable. None the less, had the primary purpose of this law been merely to prohibit the worship of other gods and no more, this prohibition would certainly have been expressed in a manner quite different and more direct and abso lute than this, in fact in a manner very similar to 34.14a. Act ually 23.13b seems to be an expansion or elaboration of some such original statement or unexpressed principle. It says, or seems to say, that in addition to not worshiping other gods, Israel must not even mention their names, presumably in taking an oath. Moreover, the style of the law, if such we may call it, is too diffuse. The tautology between the first and second halves of the sentence is self-apparent. And the law itself so manifestly forms the continuation of what is obviously a hortatory statement, ובכל אשר אמרתי אליכם תשמרו, that the conclusion is unavoidable that the entire verse is not original, but is instead a hortatory insertion into C, probably, like other insertions already consid ered, of Deuteronomic origin and character. Certainly the extreme command not even to mention the names of other deities, accords perfectly with the rigorism of Deuteronomic thought and principle.</page><page sequence="71">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 71 Furthermore, such a law as this is entirely out of place in its present position. Just like 34.14a in the K code, and like 20.3 in the E code in Ex. 20, it too should, if original, come at the very beginning of the code of laws of which it is an integral part. For this reason, too, therefore, we must conclude that this law in 23.13b cannot have been a part of the original C code. Undoubt edly, however, this code must have originally■ contained at its very beginning some such law as that of 34.14a, probably expressed in language very similar, which has, however, been suppressed by the redactors, for some reason at which we can only guess. A comparison of law II in both codes likewise leads to inter esting conclusions. Not only is the version of 20.23 longer than that of 34.17, but it is unnecessarily and surprisingly repetitious. Moreover, if the present reading be original, the two halves of the verse must be regarded as in parallelism; no other explanation would be possible ; for אלה, כסף would have to be construed as the object of לא תעשון at the beginning of the verse, and אלהי זהב as the object of לא תעשו at the end of the verse. This would give two perfectly balanced half verses, it is true; but the effect of such a division of the verse and such parallelism would be, instead of to enforce the thought, to render it strangely weak and even absurd. Moreover the balance in thought would be more seeming than real ; for אתי of the first half of the verse is certainly not the proper parallel to לכם of the second half. It is true that LXX reads לכם for אתי, that Pesh. reads both אתי and לכם together, and that Vulg. omits אתי entirely and substitutes nothing for it. But this evi dences no morè than that אתי is original, and that the versions felt the difficulty and sought to help it as best they could. Moreover the position of the ,atnab in the verse is strange indeed ; nor does it solve the problem to shift the 'atnah to כסף. Undoubtedly the Massorites had good tradition behind them in placing the ,atnafi just where it is. But this suggests the simplest solution of the problem, viz. that the first three words of the sentence, לא תעשון אתי, are a gloss probably of Deuteronomic origin. But what the reason for the gloss, it is impossible to imagine.84 Accordingly we 8יי Dillman (Commentary, 246), Holzinger (Commentary, 79f.) and Baentsch (Commentary,(Commentary, 187) would supply אלהים אחרים before אתי, and thus reading לא תעשו! אלהים אחרים אתי, would make this an independent law and the parallel to</page><page sequence="72">72 JULIAN MORGENSTERN conclude that the primary reading of law II in 20.23 must have been אלהי כסף ואלהי זהב לא תעשו לכם. Not only is this a simple and natural reading, but its relation to the parallel law in 34.17 is clear. It employs the second person plural of both verb and pronoun where 34.17 uses the singular, and for אלהי מסכה of the latter passage it reads אלהי כסף ואלהי זהב. Inasmuch as without exception all the laws of this particular class in C as well as those in K use the second person singular, we must conclude that 20.23 too originally read תעשה and לך, and that the change to the plural was editorial, perhaps the work of the same editor or glossator who, for reasons of his own, prefixed לא תעשון אתי to the sentence. The only significant difference between the two versions of law II therefore is the reading אלהי מסכה in 34.17 and אלהי כסף ואלהי זהב in 20.23. It would be fruitless at this particular place to enter into a discussion of the moot question whether this law pro hibits absolutely all use of images in the worship of Yahwe, or whether it merely prohibits those made of molten metals, but by implication sanctions those made of wood, stone, clay or other materials. This question can be considered more profitably, and a more positive answer can be given to it, when we determine the historical background and purpose of each of these codes of law. For the present, therefore, we may defer this particular discussion. The only question we need consider at this moment is why the one version of the law should read אלהי מסכה, i.e. gods or images made of any molten metal, iron, lead or bronze, as well as law I in 34.14a. We have seen that the proper parallel to 34.14a is missing in C. But this missing law could hardly have read as these scholars would have it. For their version can mean only "Ye shall make no other gods with Me," and can not possibly be construed "Ye shall have" or "Ye shall worship no other gods;" for עשה has neither the meaning "to have" nor "to worship." Nor, without some questionable stretching of the word, can אתי be interpreted as "besides Me," equivalent to על־פני of Ex. 20.3. In other words, of the three words in the present text, which these scholars make the basis of their emended reading, the only one which lends itself without qualification to their interpréta tion is the negative לא. Of the remaining four words of their emended five word sentence, two must be supplied, and that entirely gratuitously, and into the remaining two meanings must be read, which they have neither ordinarily nor even exceptionally. This is textual emendation with a vengeance.</page><page sequence="73">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 73 silver or gold, while the other should apparently specify only gods of silver or gold. Even under the most favorable circumstances and at the most prosperous moments of Israel's history, idols of gold must have been exceedingly rare and precious, while idols of silver too were probably always the exception rather than the rule. The law which refers to idols of gold and silver, even though it prohibits them, must have sprung up in an environment of extreme economic prosperity, for otherwise it would scarcely have known of images made of the precious metals, especially gold, and the prohibition would have had neither occasion nor purpose. On the other hand the more general and modest אלהי מסכה of 34.17 probably mirrors an environment not quite so prosperous eco nomically, and likewise probably earlier in point of time, since, ordinarily at least, the normal development would be from the less to the more costly. It is true that this is not the invariable course of development, and under the force of historic circum stance the reverse process might also have transpired. None the less, tentatively at least, we may conclude that the version of law II in 34.17 seems to be the older and original, and the version in 20.23 the dependent and younger. This accords exactly with the results gained thus far from the comparison of the various parallel laws in the two codes. Having discussed all the other laws in K, we turn now to the consideration of the laws dealing with the three festivals and the sacrifice of firstlings. As we have said, these laws present the greatest difficulties in the task of analysis and classification. On the one hand, in the C code the laws for the three festivals undoubtedly constituted a unit, perhaps even a single law, for they stand in immediate and logical contiguity with each other, and without the unnatural and disturbing insertion of the laws for the sacrifice of firstlings and the observance of the Sabbath, which we find in 34.18-22. On the other hand, the reading of the festival law or laws in 23.14-16 can certainly not be original, for they offer many indications of extensive editorial revision. In the first place וחג הקציר and וחג האסף in v. 16 stand abso lutely without any governing word. They are neither subject nor object, and v. 16 is in its present form and position incapable of any exact or satisfactory translation. Unquestionably these</page><page sequence="74">74 JULIAN MORGENSTERN words have been dislocated from their original position and gov ernment. Moreover in the same verse the words באמפך את מעשיך מן השרה are certainly a late gloss. They have no parallel in 34.22; nor is any designation of the moment of the year when this festival is to be observed necessary after the very specific בצאת השנה. In all likelihood these words were added at a time when the term חג הסכת was beginning to supplant the older name חג האסיף, and were designed to explain the otherwise seemingly inexplicable older name of the festival. For quite the same reason we must conclude that the words בכורי מעשיך אשר תזרע בשדה in the first half of the verse are also a gloss inserted to explain the obsolescent name חג הקציר at a time when the later term חג שבעת was coming to supplant it. For as the sentence reads now, these words too have no government. They can hardly be the object of the verbal idea implied in the noun הקציר, nor yet can the construct relation exist between them and הקציר, since the latter word has the article. At the best they can be only in seeming and formal apposition with הקציר; but it is no real apposition, since בכורי מעשיך are neither identical with nor define הקציר, but merely designate the specific sacrifice offered at this festival. From this it follows that in v. 16 the most that can be original is וחג הקציר וחג האסף בצאת השנה. But still these words stand without any government. V.15 is manifestly equally overloaded with glosses. In the first place it is significant that the words ולא יראו פני ריקם have absolutely no relation either with what precedes or what follows, both as regards meaning and grammatical connection. If we construe פני as the subject of יראו the sentence becomes a correct grammatical unit ; but what its meaning would then be, and par ticularly in this context, it is impossible to determine. And if we make the subject of יראו an understood, impersonal "they," there is then not the slightest hint from the context here just who these "they" might be. In 34.20 these words לא יראו פני ריקם appear in an altogether different connection; they follow immediately upon the law of the sacrifice of firstlings and the redemption of first-born. In this context they seem to imply that in the ritual of redemption of first-born, the ceremony must be performed at the</page><page sequence="75">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 75 sanctuary of Yahwe, and that when the first-born do present themselves at or are brought by their parents to the sanctuary, in order to be redeemed, they must be careful to always bring with them a present for Yahwe. But while this would be the implica tion of the words in their present context in 34.20, it can hardly have been the meaning intended; for there is every reason to believe that the original ceremonies of sacrifice of firstlings and first-born, and the later redemption of the latter, with of course the substitute sacrifice of an appropriate animal, were performed, not in honor of Yahwe nor at a regular sanctuary, but in honor of the family or clan ancestral spirits, and at the home or in close proximity to the clan burial-place.85 Moreover, these words, regardless of what the subject of the verb may be, imply clearly a pilgrimage to the sanctuary, pre sumably a festival pilgrimage. But if this be their meaning here, then they are clearly out of place, both in 34.20 and in 23.15, fol lowing, as they do, the legislation for the Passover and preceding that for the other two festivals. For in the first place, the Pass over was originally a festival celebrated at and in peculiar relation to the home, and not until the Deuteronomic reformation did it become a festival celebrated at a sanctuary.86 And in the second place, since the Succoth-festival was the pilgrimage festival par excellence, one would expect these words to follow the legislation for all three festivals instead of being inserted in its present place in the middle thereof. At any rate, since it seems in both codes to be correlated with the legislation for the Passover, rather than with that for the other two festivals, and since, as has been said, the Passover did not become a pilgrim age festival celebrated at the (or a) sanctuary until the Deuter onomic reformation, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that these words, ולא יראו פני ריקם, are a Deuteronomic gloss, and therefore not a part of the original code in either 34 or 23. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that just this interpretation, which the natural meaning of these words suggests here, is given 85 The evidence for this is presented in full in Rites of Birth, Marriage. Death Death and Kindred Occasions among the Semites. 86 This question too is treated in full in Rites of Birth, Marriage, Death and Kindred Occasions among the Semites.</page><page sequence="76">76 JULIAN MORGENSTERN to them in Deut. 16.16. There they have no connection whatso ever with the redemption of first-born, as in 34.20, but are explicitly connected with the three annual festival pilgrimages to the central sanctuary. Every male in Israel is there commanded to make these three annual pilgrimages without fail, and on each occasion to present himself before Yahwe with a gift. We need therefore hesitate no longer in concluding that these words are a Deuteronomic insertion into both K and C.8' Furthermore, in 23.15 the words כאשר צויתיך and also their parallel אשר צויתיך in 34.18, are obviously editorial. Likewise the words שבעת ימים תאכל מצות are undoubtedly a gloss. There is no more reason for stating the duration of the Matzoth-festival here and the manner of its observance, than there is for a similar statement with regard to the Asif-festival in v. 16. It accords ill with the characteristic concise form of these laws, and is disturb ing. And the same judgment applies equally to the words כי בו יצאת ממצרים. These words too, giving the reason for the celebration of the festival at just this particular moment, parallel in thought and purpose באספך את מעשיך מן השדה in v. 16; and since we have pronounced those words a gloss, we cannot avoid the same conclu sion for these words in v. 15. Finally 23.14 is likewise a gloss. It is a summary anticipa tion of the legislation for the three festivals. That it has no parallel in 34 is indicative of its real nature. And that it is a gloss is proved further by the fact that, were it regarded as original, then the words וחג הקציר וחג האסף in v. 16 would still remain without any governing word, whereas, if it be omitted, they too become the object of תשמר in v.15. Either v.14, or תשמר in v.15 must be regarded as a gloss ; and between the two there can hardly be any question that תשמר, which occurs likewise in 34.18, is the original, and v.14 is secondary. This analysis establishes with great probability that the original festival legislation of C read very simply and concisely, and in full harmony with the manner of statement of the other 87 Why these words are not connected with 23.17 and 34.23, just as they are connected with the same sentence in Deut. 16.16, it is difficult to imagine. J ust this connection is what we would expect.</page><page sequence="77">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 77 laws, את חג המצות תשמר למועד חדש האביב וחג הקציר וחג האסיף בצאת 88.השנה But not only was this the original reading of the festival legislation in C ; equally it was the original of the same legislation in K. For a moment's consideration of the K code shows unmis takably that the legislation for the sacrifice of firstlings, the redemption of first-born, and the observance of the Sabbath are out of place and illogically interrupt the natural continuity of the festival legislation. There was probably a certain reason for inserting the legislation for the sacrifice of firstlings, in its original concise form, immediately after the law for the Matzoth-festival, but certainly no good ground can possibly be imagined for the Sabbath law in its present position. The logical place for it would have been just preceding the legislation for the three festivals, exactly where it stands in C. Regarding 34.19-21 as dislocated from its original position in the K code, and therefore excluding it from discussion here, a proper connection in the festival legislation of K is established. In this legislation, unlike that in 23.16, the words וחג שבעת and וחג האסיף have their own governing verb, תעשה. But inasmuch as 88 It might seem at first thought that something is missing here, that since both the Matzoth-and the Asif-festivals are dated exactly, an exact date ought have been given for the Katzir-festival also. Second thought, however, shows that such need not, and in fact could not have been the case. As I have shown elsewhere ("The Three Calendars of Ancient Israel," HUCA, I [1924], 22-64), both the Passover- and Succoth-festivals were celebrated in the pre-Deutero nomic period in conjunction with the two equinoxes. This fixed their dates exactly, and naturally made it mandatory to celebrate these two festivals at exactly these moments of the year. Moreover, as I stated in the same article (op.(op. cit. 59), the Matzoth-festival, or probably more correctly, the original Pesach, as separate and distinct from the original Matzoth-festival, was cele brated during the first new-moon night following the spring equinox, the new moon of Abib. (The significance of this I set forth in Birth, Marriage, Death and and Kindred Occasions among the Semites.) After the originally independent Pesach- and Matzoth-festivals were combined, both moments, the equinox and the following new-moon night, determined the exact time of the celebration of the festival. But in contrast to this the date of the Katzir-festival was relative, depending partly upon the moment of the celebration of the Matzoth-festival and partly upon the state of the crop, just as in Deut. 16.9. Consequently there was no need, and actually but little possibility, of prescribing the exact date of the Katzir-festival, as was done with the two other festivals.</page><page sequence="78">78 JULIAN MORGENSTERN this word, together with the following לך is missing in 23.16, just where it would have been absolutely indispensable, had it stood in the original version of this festival legislation, it must be regarded as editorial here. It was necessitated by the insertion of vv. 19-21 between these words in v.22 and their original governing verb, תשבו־,תשבו־,תשבר, in v. 18. Without the insertion of some appropriate verb, v.22 would have been absolutely untranslatable. For the same reasons that we regard the corresponding words in 23.15 and 16 as glosses, so also must we regard שבעת ימים תאכל מצות אשר צויו"יךצויו"יך and כי בר,דש האביב 'צאת ממצרים in 34.18, and בכורי קציר המים in v.22 as glosses. This leaves only two minor differ ences between the remaining festival legislation in K and that which we have established as the original of C, viz. the name שבעת for the festival in place of הקציר and the term תקופת השנה in place of בצאת השנה. Neither divergence offers the slightest difficulty of explanation. Unquestionably שבעת is a substitution by a gloss ator, probably Deuteronomic, for the original הקציר. Deut. 16.9 shows that this name, שבעת, had supplanted the older name, קציר, for this festival by the time of the composition of the Deuteron omic Code. But why this glossator did not at the same time substitute the younger name, סכת, likewise used in Deut. 16.13, for the older אסיף it is impossible to tell. תקופת השנה is practically synonymous with בצאת השנה in 23.16. As I have shown elsewhere,89 in the period before Ezra the Succoth festival was celebrated on the very last seven days of the year, immediately preceding the New Year's Day. This day was coin cident with the fall equinox. Consequently there is practically no difference whether the festival be dated at the end of the year or at the equinox. Between the two, the date, "the going out of the year," would seem to be a little more exact, since the equinox really marked the first day of the new year, whereas actually the Succoth-festival was celebrated on the last seven days of the out going year, even though its connection with the equinox and the New Year's Day was close and inseparable. Perhaps from this we may infer that the dating בצאת השנה was the original and that תקופת השנה was secondary; but the evidence is far from conclusive, 89 Op. cit.</page><page sequence="79">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 79 and the safest procedure would be to venture no opinion as to priority here; nor is this detail of any material significance for this study. We conclude from this that the original festival legislation was the same in both codes, and that with characteristic direct ness and conciseness it read simply, את חג המצות תשמר למועד חדש תקופת) השנה or) האביב וחג הקציר וחג האסיף בצאת. The last law to be considered, IV, deals with the sacrifice of firstlings. In some respects it offers the greatest difficulty in our investigation, since the two versions of the law in 34.19-20 and 22.28-29 differ so widely. The latter passage reads, מלאתך ודמעך לא האחד בכור בניך תתן לי : כן תעשה לשורך לצאנך שבעת ימים יהיה עם אמו ביום השמיני תתנו לי, "The first-fruits of thy wine-press and of thy oil-press thou shalt not delay (to sacrifice) ; the first-born of thy sons thou shalt give to Me; so shalt thou do with thy cattle and thy sheep ; seven days he (the firstling and first-born) shall be with his mother; on the eight day thou shalt give him to Me." It is to be noted that in this code the law of the sacrifice of firstlings and first-born is associated with a law dealing with the sacrifices of first-fruits. We have already discussed the latter and found that it is in all likelihood of secondary origin. It does not command directly the sacrifice of the first-fruits of the wine- and oil-presses, but only indirectly, in that it charges that these sacri fices be not postponed, presumably for the celebration of one of the great, annual festivals, as was the practice with the first-fruits of the different kinds of grain, saved up and sacrificed together at the Katzir- or Shabuoth-festival at the end of the grain harvest. Instead of such a practice, 23.28a takes the sacrifice of the first fruits of wine and oil for granted, and merely commands that this sacrifice be not deferred, but be offered immediately upon the conclusion of the pressing. It is by no means unlikely that a religious festival was celebrated on these two occasions; but it must have been a festival of minor character, suggested by the occasion, rather than furnishing the occasion, for these sacrifices. Such an event with its accompanying religious celebration is described in Jud. 9.27. With this law is associated the law of the sacrifice of firstlings and first-born. This association might be explained by the</page><page sequence="80">80 JULIAN MORGENSTERN assumption that inasmuch as first-fruit and firstling sacrifices have the same fundamental origin and purpose, and therefore belong to one and the same category of sacrifices, sacrifices offered for the removal of taboo,90 it is both natural and proper that these two laws should be thus coordinated. But the justification of this assumption would be more seeming than real, since, as we have just seen, v.22a does not specifically command the sacrifice of these first-fruits, but merely fixes the time when they should be offered, viz. without postponement or delay, immediately after the wine and oil have been pressed out. Careful consideration of vv.22b and 23 establishes that the law of the sacrifice of firstlings and first-born here has a similar purpose, even despite the seemingly absolute character of v.28b, בכור בניך חתן לי. This law seems to command, not so much the actual sacrifice of firstlings and first-born, but rather, just like v.28a, taking this sacrifice for granted, it commands that these sacrifices be offered upon the eighth day after birth; it implies thereby, just as v.28a states explicitly, that they may not be post poned until a later date. This interpretation is confirmed by a number of considéra tions. First, there is the fact just established, that thus inter preted, this law of the sacrifice of firstlings and first-born has a real and logical connection with the law of first-fruits in v.28a. In the second place, were the primary purpose of the law merely to command in absolute manner the sacrifice of all firstlings and first-born, then we must admit that it is poorly and strangely stated. We would expect a short, concise statement of the single, general principle governing the sacrifice of all firstlings and first born, such as the כל פטר רחם לי of 34.19a, instead of the detailed, diffuse and vague statement which we actually have. Moreover, we cannot be quite certain of the specific meaning of בכור בניך חתן לי. Does it command the actual sacrifice of first born children, at a time and in a manner similar to the sacrifice of firstling domestic animals, upon the eighth day after birth, or does it imply some process of redemption of first-born children, just as is explicitly commanded in 34.20? Actually there is not the 90 I have treated of the taboo-sacrifice also in great detail in Birth, Mar riage, Death and Kindred Occasions among the Semites.</page><page sequence="81">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 81 slightest implication of the latter in 23.28a; and were it not that the parallel legislation in 34.20 does command the redemption of first-born children, and thereby positively prohibits their sacrifice, and were it not also for the extreme unwillingness of Biblical scholars, from the mediaeval Jewish exegetes down to the present day, to believe that the sacrifice of first-born children was ever a recognized and sanctioned institution of Yahwe-worship, we would not hesitate for a moment to accept the literal interpréta tion of 23.28a, as commanding the actual sacrifice of first-born children. There is ample evidence that child-sacrifice, and particularly the sacrifice of first-born children, was once practiced extensively in Israel. This is indicated not only by the many prophetic denunciations of the institution, and by the manifest character and purpose of the original narrative of the sacrifice of Isaac in Gen. 22, but also by an immense mass of secondary evidence.91 In Yahwe-worship the sacrifice of first-born children was not original nor basic, but, as the prophets correctly perceived, was of strange origin. None the less, already in the earliest stages of Israel's religious evolution, the sacrifices of first-born children had been incorporated into Yahwe-worship as a common, and probably regular and important practice. Only slowly and with difficulty, and as the result of evolving and advancing religious thought and principle, due no doubt to prophetic teaching and agitation, was the institution eventually outgrown. And even after it was discarded in principle, and ceased thereby to be practiced in the ordinary course of events, not infrequently, at times of threatening national calamity and as an expression of the supreme sacrifice to a supposedly enraged deity, the institution of child-sacrifice was revived again and again, and thus became the 91 All this evidence I have presented, together with a full discussion of the institution of child-sacrifice among the Semites in general and in Israel in particular, in Birth, Marriage, Death and Kindred Occasions among the Semites. Moreover, I have shown there that this particular kind of sacrifice, as well as taboo-sacrifices in general, originated in the animistic state of the evolution of Semitic religion, and continued, though more or less as survivals, with a marked tendency toward modification and amelioration, in the various advanced Semitic religions, and even in the worship of Yahwe.</page><page sequence="82">82 JULIAN MORGENSTERN object of the repeated denunciation of the prophets, even in the early post-exilic period. The question here, therefore, is not whether the sacrifice of first-born children was ever regarded as a regular element of Yahwe-worship; for all the evidence shows that it was, and that in legislation framed at a fairly early stage of the evolution of Yahwe-religion, and preceding the period of main prophetic thought and activity, the institution might even have been sanctioned and commanded. The real question is, at what time and under what conditions did evolving Yahwe-worship reach that stage of cultural development, when it came to look askance upon and to forbid absolutely the practice of the sacrifice of first born children? Ex. 34.20 and the story of the sacrifice of Isaac alone can furnish the answer to this question. But the considéra tion may be deferred for a moment, until we come to the analysis of the law of the sacrifice of firstlings and first-born in 34.19-20. Regardless for the moment, however, what the answer to this question will be, it cannot be gainsaid that נתן לי is a peculiar expression to connote "sacrifice," in both vv.28a and 29b. It would scarcely be the expression used, were this an absolute law commanding the sacrifice of firstlings and first-born. Its use is much more comprehensible if we interpret the law, as we have proposed, not as commanding such sacrifices primarily, but, assuming that such sacrifices were offered regularly, as fixing the exact time for the performance of the rite. But if this be the real meaning of this law, and it can scarcely be doubted any longer that it is, it must be admitted that the law is poorly worded. In the first place, it presupposes another law stating the general and absolute principle of the sacrifice of first lings and first-born, similar to 34.19a; but no such law occurs in C. In In the second place, כן תעשה of 22.29 would refer better to לא תאחר of v.28a than to התן לי of v.28b. In fact v.28b seems to disturb the connection. And yet v.28b cannot be dispensed with, for some specific mention of בכור is necessary; otherwise the suffix of אמו and תתנו would be unintelligible; at the same time, however, the suffix of אמו would seem to refer to the firstling of cattle or sheep in v.29a rather than to בכור בניך in v.28b. Manifestly there is much carelessness and confusion in the statement of this law.</page><page sequence="83">THF. OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 83 Perhaps this can be best accounted for by the assumption that the entire law is not original and integral in this code, but is secondary and partially editorial, and was substituted for some older and more general law commanding the sacrifice of firstlings and probably first-born as well. This conclusion is strengthened by the peculiar position of this law in the C code. We have seen that without exception all the laws of this code which parallel the laws of K are found either at the very beginning or the very end of the code. This suggests that originally only these few laws constituted this code, and that all the other laws in C now intervening between these two groups of the original laws, are secondary and late insertions into this code. This hypothesis will be confirmed when we make our detailed analysis of the Book of the Covenant. But if so, then the fact that this one law stands apart from all the other laws parallel ing those in K, and almost in the center of the C code, strengthens the assumption that, in its present form at least, it is secondary in character. Consequently the legislation for the sacrifice of firstlings in Ex. 22.28b-29 offers no help whatsoever in the analysis of the corresponding legislation in 34.19-20. There the statement of this law is rather lengthy, and is complicated by some confusion of expression as well as by a number of exceptions. The confusion lies in the impossible תז;ר. That the confusion is of great antiqui ty is proved by the wide divergence of rendition in the various versions. Following LXX תזכר is usually emended to הזו; ר; but the emendation helps little, if at all. Manifestly the clause means to tell that only male first-born might be sacrificed.92 Regardless of how תז;ר be emended, this meaning of the clause is rendered certain both by the context and the parallel law of Ex. 13.12." ני If only the verb זכר, perhaps in the Pi'el, could mean "to sacrifice a male animal," the meaning here would be perfect; but of course there is no evidence whatsoever that the verb was ever used in either this conjugation or this meaning. « The masculine suffix of אמו and תתנו of 22.29 implies also that whatever the original legislation for the sacrifice of firstlings in C may have been, it too conceived only of male firstlings as being permissible for sacrifice.</page><page sequence="84">84 JULIAN MORGENSTERN Quite significantly both Holzinger94 and Baentsch95 regard all of vv.l9b-20 as secondary, although upon altogether arbitrary and inconclusive grounds. Yet careful analysis confirms this conclusion. For vv,19b/3 and 20a imply that the only reason why a procedure was followed with the firstling of an ass different from that with the firstling of sheep or cattle, was because the latter were animals regularly sacrificed upon the altar and in conformity with the principles of a highly developed cult, and presumably as the food of the deity. But on the one hand, as we have seen, the original legislation of K apparently did not regard the altar as essential to the worship of Yahwe, and consequently did not include in its system of ritual any ceremonial necessitating or centering about the altar. And on the other hand, presentation upon the altar, presum ably as the food of the deity, was by no means the original purpose or character of the sacrifice of firstlings and first-born ; instead it represented a giving back to the deity, or originally to some spirit, that which he was thought to have created and which was there fore really his property.96 In consequence in the oldest and simplest form of this sacrifice, no distinction was made between the manner of sacrificing the firstlings of sheep or cattle and that of sacrificing the firstling of an ass or a first-born child. Appar ently the throat of each victim was cut, usually in proximity to a sacred stone or some other similar sacred object or place, and the carcass was left lying on the ground to be consumed by strangers or birds and beasts of prey. Just this original and simple pro cedure seems to be implied in the general statement, כל פטר רחם לי of v.l9a. Unquestionably vv.l9b-20 picture a later stage in the development of firstling and first-born sacrifices, a stage identical in every way with that presented in Ex. 13.12-13. This corroborates the conclusion of Holzinger and Baentsch that vv,19b-20 are secondary and not improbably the work of editors identical with or closely related to the authors of Ex.13.12-13. We must accordingly conclude that the simple statement, כל 94 Commentary, 117f. 95 Commentary, 284. 96 I have treated this subject also in full detail in Birth, Marriage, Death and Kindred Occasions among the Semites.</page><page sequence="85">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 85 פטר רחם לי of v. 19a was the original legislation of the K code with regard to the sacrifice of firstlings. And unquestionably it im plied the sacrifice of first-born children as well. This is proved by the fact which we have just established, that v.20, containing the command for the redemption of first-born children, is secondary and late, and also by the original version of the narrative of the sacrifice of Isaac. For Gen. 22.14-22 is a secondary insertion by some late J2 writer. With these verses omitted, a simple story remains with obvious purpose. It told that Abraham believed that he had been commanded by Yahwe to sacrifice his beloved son Isaac, the first-born of his mother Sarah. But at the critical moment, just as his hand was upraised to slay his son, Yahwe intervened and commanded him to sacrifice instead a ram, opportunely caught by his horns in the neighboring thicket. The manifest implication is that Yahwe desires no human sacrifice, not even of first-born sons, but has ordained that in their stead a ram or some other appro priate animal be substituted. This is, of course, exactly the same procedure as is commanded in Ex. 13.13 and 34.20, with this difference, however, that in these two laws the redemption of a first-born son by means of a substitute animal was already an established institution, while in Gen. 22 it is clearly an innovation requiring a direct sanction from Yahwe. This story is contained in the Elohist Code, and was there fore probably composed in the Northern Kingdom, and at the earliest but little before the 8th century B.C. It probably repre sents a crystallization of prophetic thought which had been de veloping for some time before the actual moment of the literary composition of this narrative, but even so there is no reason to believe that this prophetic attitude to the institution of child sacrifice in Israel had begun to take positive shape much before the beginning of the 8th century B.C. And since we shall have to fix the dates of both the K document and the Book of the Cove nant as 899 and 842 B.C. respectively, we cannot escape the con elusion that neither code of laws forbade the sacrifice of first-born children. Instead, as we have seen, both codes sanction the insti tution as in their day regular and fundamental in the worship of Yahwe.</page><page sequence="86">86 JULIAN MORGENSTERN But if the original legislation for the sacrifice of firstlings and first-born was probably the same in both codes, a significant difference developed between them in course of time. For, as we have seen, secondary legislation in C fixed the time for these sacrifices, both animal and human, on the eighth day after birth." On the other hand 34.19-20 fixes no exact moment for these sacrifices; yet it is impossible to believe that the K code too did not contemplate some particular moment in the year when these sacrifices were to be offered. The proximity of this legisla tion to the law of the Matzoth-festival suggests that the K code contemplated the offering of these sacrifices at this festival. It is true, as we have seen, that the law of the sacrifice of firstlings and first-born is not in its original place in the K code. It probably stood originally near the end of the code, in juxtaposition to the closely related sacrificial laws still found there. It was transposed to its present place, where, as we have seen, it interrupts the primary unity of the festival legislation, by some editor, who, per haps in the face of the legislation of C in 22.28-29, wished to emphasize the fact that in his opinion, and probably because it was the regular practice in his part of the country, these sacrifices were and should be offered, not upon the eighth day after birth, but upon the great, annual Matzoth-, or rather Pesach-festival, in the early spring. This divergence between these two codes is of great signifi cance in determining their literary history and their significance as historical documents. In my frequently-cited work, Birth, Marriage,Marriage, Death and Kindred Occasions Among the Semites, I have had to consider in detail the origin and history of the Passover. On the basis of a good mass of evidence, collected from manifold sources, I have shown that the festival is of pre-Yahwistic origin, and goes back to animistic beginnings. During the three dark nights immediately preceding the first new-moon following the spring equinox, and culminating on the night of the new-moon itself, the spirits of dead ancestors, and particularly those who had « In Birth, Marriage., Death and, Kindred Occasions among the Semites I have likewise considered in detail the question why this and countless other similar rites of primitive Semitic religion endured for seven days and culmin ated on the eighth day.</page><page sequence="87">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 87 died within the year, were thought to be released from the nether world, their regular abode, and to be free to wander where they listed and to work mischief upon all whom they chanced to meet. In particular they sought to force their way into their old abodes and to injure their former relatives. To guard against their attacks each clan or family sacrificed a lamb, or probably in the earlier stages of the ceremony a camel, in honor of its dead ancestors. This sacrifice was slain upon the threshold of the tent or house, and in addition thereto, the blood was smeared upon the lintels and door-posts. Through this protective circle of blood surrounding the door-way, these spirits could not pass, and the inmates of the tent or house were thus guarded against their attacks. During the entire night, and until the protective light of dawn had come, no one ventured forth from the shelter of the home; all through the long darkness they kept watch-night in terror of the danger without. This was the origin of the peculiar Paschal sacrifice of ancient Israel and of the dafyîyyeh-sacrifice of the present-day Moslems. In the Bedouin form of this last sacri fice its original character is particularly apparent. But these ancestral spirits were not conceived of as altogether evil and mischievous. In some respects they were beneficent. Among other blessings supposedly emanating from them, they brought about all human and animal birth, and at a somewhat later stage of cultural evolution, they caused the earth to yield its produce. Consequently it was to them that the sacrifices of firstlings, first-born and first-fruits were originally offered. Under the conditions which have governed the existence of practically all Semitic nomads from the remotest times, domestic animals give birth at one season in the year, in the very early spring. It is just the time when, at the close of the rainy season, herbage is most flourishing, and animals are most plentifully nourished, and the udders of the mother animals yield abundant milk. It is expected generally that animals born either too soon or too late, in relation to this period, cannot live. Now for some peculiar reason animals were regarded as unfit, or rather not yet fit, for sacrifice or for any profane use until the end of a period of seven days after birth.98 The eighth day was 98 So also Lev, 22.27.</page><page sequence="88">88 JULIAN MORGENSTERN the first, and therefore the most appropriate day upon which firstlings and first-born sacrifices could be offered, although for any good reason, this sacrifice might be postponed until some later date, provided of course that the animal was during the interval regarded as sacred or taboo, and was not used for any profane purpose. The first new-moon night after the spring equinox fell as a rule approximately eight days after the vast majority of domestic animals had calved. It was therefore the most favorable and logical moment for the offering of these first ling sacrifices. And by a natural process of attraction it became the moment when all first-born male children, born during the year, were sacrificed, or, in later stages of cultural evolution, were redeemed, either by the sacrifice of an appropriate substitute animal or by circumcision. Obviously these beliefs and ceremo nies were rooted in pastoral life and religious observance. The advance of various Semitic peoples to agricultural and later to commercial life and culture naturally affected these prim itive beliefs and practices materially. On the one hand, the proper occasion for the sacrifice of first-fruits was determined by the seasons and the states of the different crops. This gave rise to festivals celebrated at various seasons of the year and with cere monies altogether different from the rites of the nomad Passover. On the other hand, under the conditions of agricultural life, where a limited tract of cultivable land yields a far larger food supply if used to raise crops than if employed for grazing, the tendency was naturally for the herds and flocks to diminish steadily in size and in economic importance. And with the consequent, steady decrease in the number of firstling animals to be sacrificed, much of the old, original significance of the Passover was lost.' Moreover, with advancing culture, the god-conception like wise evolved. In this process the expanding realization of the functions and processes of nature, both in regard to human and animal procreation and crop production, worked a far-reaching change. The belief in ancestral spirits gradually gave way to the conception of great gods, and eventually in Israel to that of a single God, Yahwe. The old Passover in consequence lost much of its original significance and continued to be observed largely as a survival, or was absorbed in the agricultural Matzoth-festival,</page><page sequence="89">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 89 celebrated at approximately the same moment of the year. This development unquestionably proceeded more rapidly in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, with its far greater extent of culti vable soil and its consequently far more developed agricultural life, economic prosperity and cultural progress, than in the South em Kingdom, where, due to the general comparative sterility of the soil, grazing continued to be a dominant occupation alongside of agriculture, and tended to foster and perpetuate with minimum modifications the old pastoral, or perhaps better, semi-pastoral, life, beliefs and cultural and religious practices. Just this divergence of background and content we find between the two codes. It is manifest in the conspicuous role which the altar plays in the ritual of C, particularly when con trasted with the apparent absence or insignificant role of the altar and altar ritual in the original form of the K code. But it is most apparent and significant in .the role played by the old nomad Passover-festival in the two codes. In both codes apparently the old Passover as a distinctive festival has died out and is no longer observed. C preserves and sanctions no reminiscence of it what soever ; for it the Passover is altogether a thing of the past, out grown completely, and almost, if not entirely, forgotten. But the K code, even though it does not prescribe the observance of the Passover as a specific festival, preserves two very strong reminis cences of, or survivals from, the old Passover observance. In the first place it commands the continued offering of the old, distinct ive Passover-sacrifice, presumably at the home, as the original manner of offering this sacrifice was, and apparently without relation to any festival. But, as we have seen, the C code has substituted for the law of this specific sacrifice, another law, some what similar in wording, but dealing with conventional festival sacrifices offered at the sanctuary. And in the second place, the K code still associates thesacri fice of firstlings and first-born with the festival in the early spring. But since the Passover itself was no longer celebrated as a dis tinctive festival, but had been absorbed by the agricultural Matzoth-festival, celebrated at approximately the same moment of the year, these sacrifices were now offered in connection with that festival, but still at the same season and moment of the year</page><page sequence="90">90 JULIAN MORGENSTERN as of old. This was perfectly natural; for in the pastoral or semi pastoral Southern Kingdom, there must have been so many first ling sacrifices to be offered, and all, as we have seen, at about the same moment, that the occasion for a festival celebration was still there, even though no longer to a degree sufficient to perpetuate the Passover as an independent festival. In consequence these sacrifices were now offered quite naturally in connection with and as an integral part of the celebration of the Matzoth-festival, into which the Passover had been absorbed. And with these sacrifices, of course, went the sacrifice of all human first-born, born during the year. The animal firstling sacrifices surpassed in number and significance, it would seem, the human first-born sacrifices, and so determined very properly, the time when the latter should be offered. But in the Northern Kingdom, with its agricultural and, to a certain extent, even commercial culture and religious practice, on the one hand the specifically agricultural character of the Matzoth festival was necessarily more pronounced than in the South, and on the other hand the number of annual firstling sacrifices was comparatively few. In consequence the human first-born sacri fices probably exceeded relatively in number and importance the animal firstling sacrifices. Consequently the natural tendency was to divorce these sacrifices from all festival connection what soever, and instead to reapply in literal manner the old, basic principle, that the proper moment for all such sacrifices was the eighth day after birth. Exactly this is the procedure prescribed in 22. 28b-29." None the less it is certain that 22.28b-29, being secondary legislation in C, must represent a modification of an earlier, more general and absolute, and at the same time a simpler and more directly stated law. This may well have read like its counterpart or original in K, כל פצר רחם לי. And this probably stood in the original C code in much the same position in which it first stood in K. יי Perhaps the fact that in this passage the reference to the sacrifice of first-born precedes the reference to the sacrifice of firstlings indicates that, just as we have maintained, in the Northern Kingdom, first-born sacrifices played a more significant role than did the sacrifices of firstlings.</page><page sequence="91">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 91 We have at last completed our comparison of the two par allelallel codes of law in K and in C. We have found that neither code has retained its original form, that many editors have taken far reaching liberties with both codes in the way of emendation, supplementation, addition of new laws, rearrangement of the original order of the laws, and reinterpretation to conform to the changing point of view of succeeding ages. The original content and order of the laws of the K code would seem, as the result of our analysis, to have been as follows : .לא תשתחוה לאל אחר I .אלהי מסכה לא תעשה לך II .ששת ימים תעבד וביום השביעי השבת.השבת III את הג המצות תשמר למועד הדש האביב והג הקציר וחג האסיף בצאת IV .תקופת) השנה or) .כל פטר רחם לי V .לא תשחט על חמץ דם זבחי VI .לא ילין לבקר זבח חג הפסח VII .לא תבשל גדי בחלב אמו VIII And not only was this in all likelihood the original form and content of the K code, but it is quite clear that the original C code was based directly upon this. The relationship is obvious and the character of dependence is readily determined. This original K code, manifestly emanating from the Southern Kingdom, was taken over by some group of Northern legislators, and, with a few slight modifications and the addition of two characteristic laws, was made to fit Northern conditions of life and religious practice. As we have seen, the C parallel to law I has disappeared, although unquestionably it must once have stood at the beginning of the C code.100 For אלהי מסכה of law II of the K code, the C code has substituted אלהי כסף ואלהי זהב, with its implication of greater wealth, resulting undoubtedly from extensive agricultural, and 100 Probably 20.22b has in some way come to take its place. Certainly the present v.22b is not the natural continuation of v. 22a. It is probably editorial, and aims to connect the account of the revelation on Sinai in Ex. 19.1-20.21, with its Ten Commandments, with the Book of the Covenant. The natural continuation of כה תאמר of v.22a would have been the statement of the laws of the original C code, with לא תשתחוה לאל אחר, or something very similar to it, as the first law.</page><page sequence="92">92 JULIAN MORGENSTERN probably even commercial activity. For תעבד of law III of K, C has substituted תעשה מעשיך, implying thereby a greater variety of occupations than in K, in other words, again extensive commer cial activity in addition to agriculture. For תשחט of law VI of K, C reads תזבח, probably suggesting thereby an altar sacrificial ritual, not necessarily implied in K. And for זבח חג הפסח of law VII of K, C, with a slightly different order of words, reads חלב חגי. By this slight rewording, as we have seen, C made the law deal, no longer with the specific, in the Northern Kingdom seemingly outgrown, Passover-sacrifice, offered at night and at home, but with the conventional sacrifice offered at all festivals, in the day time, and at the sanctuary and upon the altar. So far as can be determined, these are the sole differences between the original forms of the parallel laws of the two codes; and, as is apparent immediately, not only was the statement of the laws in K the original, and that in C the dependent, but also every departure in C from the original wording in K was purposed, in order to adapt the K legislation to the conditions of the Northern environment in which C was composed. This will account also for the two additional laws found in C, which have the same character as those laws of this code which we have already considered, and also as all the laws of the K code.101 These two laws deal with the regulations for the altar102 and the Sabbatical year.103 The latter law, it would seem, is out of place where it stands at present. Its logical position would be after the Sabbath law instead of preceding it, as it does; for the institution of the Sab batical year is unquestionably an extension of the primitive prin ciple of taboo associated with the number seven, which lies at the bottom of the Sabbath observance.104 Yet the institution of the 101 The technical name of this particular class of law was ך^ר. The proof of this and the consideration of its significance will be given in the analysis of the Book of the Covenant, which will constitute the sequel to this paper. 102 102 20.24-26. "3 23.10-11. 104 This matter too is treated in detail in Birth, Marriage, Death and Kindred Occasions among the Semites.</page><page sequence="93">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 93 Sabbatical year is unquestionably of great antiquity. And in a code of ritual laws, such as this of C, which conforms in the main to the conditions of a basically agricultural environment, a law prescribing the observance of the Sabbatical year would be prac tically indispensable. Unquestionably the present wording of this law is the result of considerable editorial expansion, probably, judging from its tone, Deuteronomic. In view of the character istic, direct, concise form of all these laws, we may safely infer that this law originally read simply, שש שנים תזרע את ארצך והשביעית תשמטנה. Its similarity in form to the Sabbath law, and its consequent dependence thereon, are self-apparent, and constitute another cogent reason for believing that originally this law followed directly upon the Sabbath law instead of preceding it. The analysis of the altar law offers somewhat greater difficul ties. Whatever may have been the original wording and meaning of 20.24b, unquestionably it and also v.24a/3 are the result of editorial expansion. It is difficult to avoid the impression that v.24aj3 implies a far more extensive sacrificial ritual than was con templated by the remainder of the code. And v.24b is really out of harmony with the code proper, for it implies that Yahwe's blessing flows out of His hearing His name mentioned in worship, whatever particular kind of worship may be understood here, whereas the very conception of a covenant between Yahwe and Israel, based upon this code of laws, implies that Yahwe's blessing was contingent solely upon Israel's punctilious observance of all the laws of the code. With these words omitted the nature and purpose of the law become a bit clearer. Manifestly this law does not command the institution of the altar as an indispensable object of ritual obser vance, where formerly no altar had been necessary; for had this been its purpose the law would surely have been worded differ ently. Instead the law is clearly restrictive in purpose; it was obviously framed in the midst of an environment where large and elaborate altars, probably built of hewn stone, were common, an environment evidently of economic wealth and relatively high cultural development. This law represents a reaction and protest against these elaborate altars, and denounces them, by implica tion, as not in conformity with the right principles of Yahwe</page><page sequence="94">94 JULIAN MORGEN STERN worship. In place of these elaborate altars it prescribes a simple altar of earth. This reaction against the more elaborate and costly stone altar and reversion to the older, more primitive, simpler and less costly earthen altar, is quite in the spirit of law II forbidding the manufacture of gods of gold and silver. It is like wise in full conformity with later prophetic protest against ritual extravagance and luxury as characteristic of Ba'al-worship, whereas simplicity and restraint characterize the true worship of Yahwe. Now vv.25 and 26 would not be out of harmony with this manifest purpose of this altar law; and in themselves they seem to be in every way compatible with the primary statement of this law in v.24aa. Certainly the prohibition against the use in the erection of an altar of stones cut with iron instruments reflects a superstition of great antiquity, older by far than the time of com position of the original Book of the Covenant; therefore it might, so far as point of time is concerned, have found its place in this code. But after careful consideration vv. 25-26 give the impression of a concession from the absoluteness of the original altar law in v.24aa to the point of view of a later and culturally somewhat more advanced age. V.26 is unmistakably a unit with v.25 rather than with v.24ao', for the simple, earthen altar would hardly have been so large or so elaborate that it would have necessitated that the officiant ascend upon it, or, even had this been necessary, that steps would have been required for this pur pose. Such a concession from and modification of the absolute ness of the principle expressed in the primary statement of the altar law has no counterpart at all in the other laws constituting the original C code, and is altogether out of accord with the uncompromising character of the covenant relation between Yahwe and Israel. Moreover, were vv.25-26 a part of the original altar law, its characteristic, direct, concise form would be lost entirely. These considerations point to the conclusion that this law read originally מזבח אדמה תעשה לי, and no more, and that vv.25-26 are a later addition. Yet they must have been added at a fairly early date, at a time when not only the ancient supersti tion with regard to the use of iron instruments had not yet been outgrown, but also trousers or similar undergarments had not yet</page><page sequence="95">THE THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 95 come into use, to cover the parts of the body beneath the skirt, otherwise exposed to the ground. The wording of the group of laws which constituted the original nucleus of the code of the Book of the Covenant thus seems to have been as follows: &lt;.לא תשתחוה לאל אחר) I .אלהי כסף ואלהי זהב לא תעשה לך H .מזבח אדמה תעשה לי m .ששת ימים תעשה מעשיך וביום השביעי תשבת IV .שש שנים תזרע את ארצך והשביעית תשמטנה V .את חג המצות תשמר למועד חדש האביב וחג הקציר וחג האסיף בצאת השנה VI (.כל פטר רחם לי) VII .לא תזבח על חמץ דם זבחי VIII .לא ילין חלב הגי עד בקר IX .לא תבשל גדי בחלב אמו x One final question remains to be discussed in connection with our analysis of the laws of K and their parallels in C, viz what was the original number of laws in each code ; or, more explicitly, is the statement of Ex. 34.28 that in the K code there were ten laws, correct and therefore original? Our analysis has established that the original nucleus of the C code consisted of ten laws, entirely ritualistic in character, designated in Ex. 24.4 and 8 as דברים. This is an important fact, nowhere intimated in the Book of the Covenant itself. But our analysis has also established the fact that seemingly the original code of K contained only eight laws, and not ten. However, it is difficult to escape the impression that this number ten and the arrangement of these laws basic to the cov enant between Yahwe and Israel in a group of ten, are not a mere accident. Not only have we ten דברים as the nucleus of the code upon which the covenant rested in the Book of the Covenant, but likewise the Elohist tradition in Ex. 20 records ten דברים as the basis of the covenant at Horeb; and this tradition has been bor rowed in full by Deuteronomy.105 And finally there is the explicit 105 The hypothesis frequently advanced by Biblical scholars, that the original legislation of the Holiness Code was arranged in groups of ten laws, or rather in double groups of five laws each, is still too unevidenced and uncertain</page><page sequence="96">96 JULIAN MOEGENSTERN statement of 34.28b that the K code did consist of ten דברים. Of course it might be argued that this number is editorial, the result of the addition of two secondary and amplifying laws, inserted perhaps purposely, just in order to increase the original eight laws to ten. The two secondary laws in 34.23 and 26a would seem to lend themselves well to this hypothesis. But a number of facts speak strongly against it and argue for the originality of v.28b and the number ten. In the first place, were we to admit that the original K code contained only eight דברים, whereas the original C code contained ten, and that the original eight of K were increased to ten by the purposed insertion of two additional and altogether duplicative laws, we would also have to admit that the practice of arranging these דברים in groups of ten sprang up at some time between the composition of K and C, and was in consequence of no great antiquity. This is by no means impossible. In fact it might well be that the original C code, consisting of ten primary דברים, was the first such code to contain this number, and that it, rather than the older K code, became the standard of all similar groups of דברים compiled later ; this consequently necessitated the supplementation of the original K code to make it conform to this standard. But against this suggestion is the fact that those very laws which, according to it, were added to the original K code in order to standardize the number of its דברים, are also found verbatim in the present C code,code, where not only there was no need to add to the original ten laws, but also such addition would upset the very standard of ten laws, to establish which they were supposedly added to the origi nal K code. More significant is the fact that if the עשרת הדברים of v.28b be regarded as secondary, it is difficult not to regard the entire verse as secondary. Certainly v.28a is editorial, as are also the words על הלחת of v. 28b, for they are manifestly designed to har monize the old K tradition with the younger J or JE tradition, a fragment of which, as we have seen, is inserted in 34.1-5. This leaves only ויכחב""את דברי הברית עשרת הדברים as possibly primary. It must be admitted that this is very little. But on the other to to be offered here in support of our theory. Nor need we consider here the question of the origin of the practice of grouping these laws in sets of ten.</page><page sequence="97">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 97 hand, v.27 certainly requires some such statement as this to complete its thought; otherwise the narrative would halt badly. Moreover in the parallel narrative of the Book of the Covenant, in Ex. 24.4-8, as we shall see in time, we have the expected and exact duplicate of this incident. There too Moses writes the "words" of the covenant in a book, presumably, although not explicitly stated, at Yahwe's command, and then makes use of this "book of the covenant" in the subsequent ceremony of the solemnization of the covenant. We have seen that the K docu ment too must have told of the solemnization of the covenant between Yahwe and Israel, the central ceremony of which must have been the formal reading or recital by Moses of the laws of K, the "words" of the covenant, and their definite acceptance by the people. For such a ceremony, and likewise for the permanent record of this covenant, it was essential that Moses have written the laws down in some form. In all likelihood the original K tradition told that these laws were written upon a ספר, a scroll, just as the C tradition has it, and not upon the more elaborate and monumental tablets, as the late J and E traditions tell. Moreover, in the later J and E traditions it is Yahwe who writes the laws, whereas here, just as in 24.4, it is Moses. This is, of course, the older and simpler form of the narrative, and has all the earmarks of originality. Unquestionably therefore the words of v.28b, ויכתב... את דברי הברית, are original, and with them, in all likelihood, though, it must be granted, by no means necessarily, the last two words, עשרת הדברים. Probably this read in full, ויכתב משה על ספר את דברי הברית עשרת הדברים ; or the statement may have been even somewhat more elaborate than this. It was of course the opening sentence of the K account of the solemnization of the covenant, paralleling in this respect Ex. 24.4a. This argument is by no means conclusive. The final and all determining test of its correctness must be of course the fixing of the ten original laws of the K code, There is only one way in which the eight laws, which we have established as the original of the K code, may be regarded as ten, viz. by counting the legis lation for the three festivals as three laws instead of one, i.e. one law for each festival. This is the only possible solution of this problem, and it must be admitted that it seems more logical to</page><page sequence="98">98 JULIAN MORGENSTERN regard this festival legislation as one law instead of three, particu larly since, as we have reconstructed the wording of the law, there is only one governing verb, תשמר, for all three nouns. These considerations compel us to leave the question unset tied and open. The original code of the K document may have been regarded as consisting of either eight "words" or ten. If the latter, then the words עשרת הדברים of v.28b are primary; if the former, then these words are secondary,106 and the practice of arranging the "words," which were believed to be basic to a covenant, in a group of ten must rest upon the model furnished, not by K, but by C ; for certainly in C the legislation for the three festivals must have been reckoned as one law and not as three. VIII THE DATE OF THE K DOCUMENT. We have completed our analysis of the laws of the K docu ment and their parallel laws in the Book of the Covenant. We have reconstructed what must have been, either exactly or ap proximately, the original form and content of the K code and of the corresponding laws of C. The next task is to determine the date and historic background of K, and eventually, although not in this paper, the date and historic background of C also. We have already established some facts with regard to the cultural background of the K document, which led us to conclude that it must have been composed in the Southern Kingdom. Further consideration of the cultural background of the code will confirm this conclusion and also bring out other facts of more than passing significance. Careful and repeated examination of the code, particularly in its original, simple, concise form, creates the strong impression that it is distinctively reactionary in character. Manifestly it !06!06 por v.28b LXX reads, ו'בתב את הדברים האלה על לחת הברית עשרת הדברים. Manifestly this reading is late, and was rearranged from the present MT in order to harmonize this verse with vv. 1-5. This fact, however, helps not one whit in determining whether the words עשרת הדברים are original in the verse or not, since clearly, even if secondary, they are older than the LXX version of the passage.</page><page sequence="99">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 99 sprang out of an environment partly agricultural and partly pastoral or semi-pastoral. The three annual festivals, Matzoth, Katzir and Asif, which marked respectively the beginning of the harvest season, the end of the grain harvest and the close of the entire harvest period, and likewise the Sabbath, are all institu tions rooted in agricultural life and practice, and altogether unknown and without significance in pastoral culture. The needs of sheep and goats for food and water daily are such that the Sabbath can be observed by shepherds only with extreme dififi culty, if at all ; certainly it could not have had its origin in pastoral life. On the other hand, the institutions of the sacrifice of firstlings and first-born, of the Passover-festival and its peculiar sacrifice, and the command not to boil the kid in its mother's milk, unques tionably had their origin and primary purpose and significance in the early stages of pastoral culture, or perhaps, in part at least, in a stage of cultural evolution even earlier than this. In this code, however, they give the impression of survivals of a partly outgrown culture and religious practice. The origin and primary meaning and purpose of the command not to boil the kid in its mother's milk are apparently entirely unknown, and not improb ably were not clearly understood even by the legislators who framed the K, C or D codes, in all three of which the command occurs. In all likelihood, as we have suggested, the practice had its origin in some early animistic belief or magical rite, dealing with the increase of the flocks. We have already seen that in K the Passover is well on its way to oblivion as an independent festival. Merely the Passover sacrifice survives in this code, but the festival itself has already been absorbed in the agricultural Matzoth-festival; and the sacri fice of firstlings and first-born, under the normal conditions of pastoral culture offered in connection with the celebration of the Passover, are here offered at the Matzoth-festival. In the C code even the Passover sacrifice has disappeared completely, while the sacrifice of firstlings has become a matter of secondary signifi</page><page sequence="100">100 JULIAN MORGENSTERN cance, and has, in consequence been dissociated from its connec tion with any particular festival celebration.107 Likewise the command not to offer animal sacrifices with leaven was clearly designed to maintain the old institution of animal sacrifice, intimately associated with the former pastoral culture, in much the ancient, traditional manner, free from all innovations of later agricultural life, such as the use of leavened bread. We have seen too that in the K code the altar, while by no means necessarily unknown, apparently was not as important and indispensable as in the C code. The Passover sacrifice, at least, was still offered at home, and in this rite the altar played no role whatsoever. The command, too, not to make molten images exhibits the same background. Regardless still of whether this command forbids the use of all images whatsoever, or merely those made of molten metal, it is clear that this code must have been compiled at an age when not only the art of molding images had reached a fairly advanced stage of development, but also the use of such images. These were probably made, occasionally at least, even of gold and silver, as well as of the less costly bronze, iron or lead. 10י It is interesting to note that the name פסח was revived by the Deutero nomic legislators. In Deut. 16.1-8 this is the only name given to the festival, and the name חג המצות, used by both K and C, is not mentioned once. More over the ceremony of eating matzoth is there made secondary and incidental to the eating of the Paschal lamb. This ceremony is of course performed at the central sanctuary, and no longer at the home, while other significant ritual changes are also introduced. The festival is reinterpreted, no longer primarily as a mere pastoral, or a combined pastoral-agricultural festival, but as a his toric, national festival, commemorating above all else the first significant event in Israel's national life, the exodus from Egypt. This interpretation naturally went hand in hand with the transfer of the scene of celebration of the festival from the homes or the local shrines to the national capital and sanctuary. Probably this fact, and also the consciousness that the Passover was primarily a desert, shepherd festival, and therefore presumably more intimately related to the true Yahwe-worship than the agricultural Matzoth-festival, influenced the Deuteronomic legislators in their revival of the old, and for a time almost outgrown and forgotten name of the festival, פסח. All this I have also discussed in detail in Rites of Birth, Marriage, Death and. Kindred Occasions among the Semites.</page><page sequence="101">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 101 Their use must have been so extensive as to rouse the strong and active opposition of some particular group of religious leaders and cultural reactionaries. This opposition found its expression in this law. The K code accordingly must have been composed in the Southern Kingdom at a time when the old pastoral life and cul ture and religious belief and practice were beginning to give way to a more advanced agricultural civilization, with its own peculiar religious institutions and ceremonies. But the old culture did not yield without a struggle. Many of its ancient beliefs and institu tions persisted, at least in certain circles, even though their original meaning and purpose had been largely outgrown. It had its strong and doughty champions, who manifestly proved them selves powerful enough to frame and establish as the norm for the Yahwe-worship of their day a code of laws, which, even though sanctioning the observance of a number of religious institutions of agricultural origin and significance, was none the less dominantly pastoral or semi-pastoral in character. These four agricultural institutions, the Sabbath and the three festivals, were so funda mental, and probably, by the time of the composition of the K code, had become so deeply rooted in the religious practice of the people, that their observance had come to be generally regarded as altogether natural and beyond question, and their incorpora tion into the religious system of this code must have been in con sequence half, if not completely, unconscious. This conclusion with regard to the cultural and religious background of the K document is borne out completely by its narrative portion. There we have the primitive picture of a deity in human shape, but of gigantic size, with a face, a back and hands. He dwells upon a mountain out in the desert. He is Yahwe; but He is still conceived of as a local deity, who has not yet taken up His abode in Palestine. According to tradition, as we have seen, this conception of Yahwe continued in force as late as the time of Elijah, and apparently was firmly believed in even by this great prophet in the second quarter of the 9th century B.C. Moreover, according to the K narrative, Yahwe was wor shiped first, not by Israel, but by the little Kenite tribe. During the historical period this tribe was intimately associated with</page><page sequence="102">1 02 JULIAN MORGENSTERN Israel, and particularly with the tribe of Judah; yet it apparently preserved its tribal identity and pastoral or semi-pastoral exist ence for a very long time, and was never, or at least not until very late, completely absorbed in Judah. Moreover, the K narrative tells that Yahwe became Israel's God only through the establish ment of a covenant between Him and Israel through the mediation of Moses. This narrative, with its primitive character and associations, harmonizes in every respect with the dominantly pastoral or semi pastoral tone of the code of laws associated with it. The purpose of the narrative is obvious; it is to represent the covenant entered into by Yahwe and Israel, on the basis of a small code of laws, setting forth the fundamental principles of Yahwe-worship ac cording to the conception of semi-pastoral, religious reactionaries in the midst of an evolving agricultural environment, as having been instituted long before by Moses immediately after the exodus from Egypt and on the occasion of the traditional first contact of Israel with Yahwe. This procedure gave to this code of laws a strong sanction in the mind of the people at large, which, as a mere contemporaneous document, it would not have possessed. Obviously it was the same procedure that was employed with the later C and D covenant codes. The question before us now is, just when and under what conditions was the K document composed ? There is just one moment in the early history of the Southern Kingdom which suggests itself in answer to this question ; it is the religious reformation of King Asa. The long and eventful reign of David had established Israel as the foremost state of Western Asia. He had in fact succeeded in founding a little Israelite empire, extending from the desert, or even from the Gulf of Akaba, on the south to the Euphrates on the north, and from the Mediterranean on the west to the desert on the east. His son Solomon continued this work of empire building. He organized it systematically into districts in order to facilitate its efficient administration, and centralized and unified its government in every way possible. His long reign was one of comparative peace and consequent internal quiet and prosperity. The nation itself was well unified, at least on the surface. It no longer had aught</page><page sequence="103">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 103 to fear from inter-tribal strife within or threatening enemy with out. A powerful standing army and royal body-guard.guaranteed security on all sides. For the first time in their history the people were free to devote practically all their time to various economic occupations, chiefly agriculture; and for the first time in their history they began to raise crops in quantities far larger than they needed for home consumption. There was only one way to dis pose of their surplus products, by barter for the products of foreign countries, with the Phoenician and other merchants, who now began to frequent the land in numbers far vaster than ever before. Not that there had never been such bartering previously, but never upon a scale as general and extensive as this. In conse quence within a comparatively brief space of time the whole mode and standard of living of the people had been greatly modified. Articles of wearing apparel, of food or of household equipment, which formerly had been the rarest of luxuries, now became indis pensable requirements of every day life. Contact with these foreign merchants and the news of the world which they brought and the tales which they told, broadened the horizon of the people and helped to raise their standard of living. But even more, it was not long before the people began to realize for themselves the economic advantage of commerce over against or supplementary to agriculture. Slowly but surely a small merchant class began to develop. Naturally not every man who gave up his former agricultural occupation to go into busi ness succeeded. Some failed ; and with the loss of property and ancestral estates, they had no alternative but to sell themselves and their families as slaves. Others, however, succeeded in busi ness, and in time, as was to be expected, became rich. And their wealth enabled them to live upon a scale of culture and luxury far surpassing, and no doubt greatly envied by, their less prosperous brethren. For the first time class distinctions manifested them selves in Israel's history. Solomon furthered this new economic policy and progress of his country in many ways. Realizing apparently that he could never hope to compete with the Phoenicians in the Mediterranean world, due both to their long-established and far-reaching com mercial connections there and to the complete lack of adequate</page><page sequence="104">104 JULIAN MORGENSTERN harbors along the Mediterranean coast, he attempted to exploit another and perhaps even richer commercial field, to which the Phoenicians had no ready access, but which he could easily reach through his control of the desert roads, the field of the Red Sea and the vast Indian Ocean. The friendly relations which he maintained with the Phoenicians, the Egyptians and other foreign nations furthered the commercial activities and prosperity of his people. These friendly relations he cemented in the traditional manner, by contracting marriages with numerous foreign prin cesses, particularly the princess of Egypt. These ladies naturally brought with them into Israel large retinues of native servants and attendants. For each one, or at least the most important, Solomon, in accordance with the then standards of propriety, provided her own palace or private quarters, where luxury reigned supreme. And for each foreign wife, with all her native retinue, and for the many visiting foreign merchants, opportunity had unquestionably to be provided to worship their own native gods with their own particular rituals. In various parts of the country, in all likelihood, but particularly in the Temple area in Jerusalem, the capital, little sanctuaries of countless foreign deities sprang up in a trice; and before the eyes of the people of Israel, with their own standards of living changing so rapidly, were unfolded the cults of all these strange gods, with rituals so different, and in most respects so much more elaborate than their own simple, half pastoral, half agricultural Yahwe worship. It was inevitable that the latter should be greatly affected thereby. Gradually strange modes of worship were in troduced into the Yahwe-cult, the use of incense no doubt, and idols of molten metal, even the precious metals, silver and gold, and the like. Not that the use of idols was unknown in Israel before, even idols of silver; but never upon the present scale and never idols representing so many strange deities. Furthermore the unprecedented prosperity of the people gave occasion for offering all manner of sacrifice on occasions and in quantities unheard of before. The forms and standards of Yahwe-worship were changing quite as rapidly and as largely as were the eco nomic and cultural standards of the people. And one further and very natural tendency, the drift from</page><page sequence="105">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 105 the country to the city, from the villages to the larger cities, and especially to the capital, Jerusalem. In the main it was of course the wealthy merchant class who were influenced in this way. In the cities, and especially in Jerusalem, they came in close contact and established warm relations with the military and administra tive groups. A kind of aristocracy was the natural development, with its apex of course in the royal court. During the long and prosperous reign of Solomon this de velopment continued and made great headway. But with his death, and the accession to the throne of the weakling Rehobeam and the ensuing division of the kingdom, the process came to a sudden end. Almost in a night the empire which David had built and Solomon had solidified, crumbled. The vassal states quickly declared their independence. To the north-east Damascus be came the center of a kingdom, composed of former little Aramaean tribal states, in quite the same manner as the kingdom of Israel had evolved out of the original independent tribes or tribal groups after David had thrown off the Philistine yoke. This new king dom of Aram was a constant thorn in the side of both kingdoms of Israel for one hundred and thirty-five years. Civil war likewise ensued quite naturally between the two Israelite kingdoms, with the result that once more the people were compelled to divide their time between military and economic activities. No longer therefore could they raise crops in amount larger than they needed for their own use. No longer could they barter upon the former extensive scale for foreign commodities. The merchant class no doubt struggled to weather the storm, hoping for an eventual return of prosperity. Some in all likelihood, with large resources, did succeed in adjusting themselves to the new conditions, and along with the court itself and the remaining aristocracy which survived the national catastrophe, went steadily upon their way of luxury and culture, with its foreign, non-Yahwistic institutions and practices, and with its garish display of wealth and extrava gance, much as before. Those merchants who were less fortu nate, succumbed. The majority must have lost everything, and now, in their turn, recruited the ranks of the discontented and embittered paupers and slaves. And outside of Jerusalem the middle class, formerly the only class within the nation, steadily</page><page sequence="106">106 JULIAN MORGENSTERN followed their old occupations of agriculture and, particularly in the south, sheep-raising. No doubt they blamed, secretly or openly, their rulers and the aristocratic party for the loss of their former national prosperity. And in all likelihood the aristocratic party in turn took little note and gave less concern to these developments. Manifestly a crisis was impending. It finally broke some thirty-three years after the division of the kingdom. In his fifteenth year, i.e. in 899 B.C., we are told in I Ki. 15.13, Asa, the great-grandson of Solomon, removed his mother Maachah from her high position as gbirah, probably queen-regent, because she had made an idol, for some particular reason designated as a mifleset, in honor of Ashera. The idol itself he burned in the Kidron Valley. This is the only specific detail of the reformation of Asa which this passage gives. The preceding verse tells, in a manner quite general and characteristic of the thought and style of the Deuteronomic authors of the Book of Kings, that Asa removed from the land the sacred harlots and the idols which his fathers had made. This statement has apparently no historical significance whatsoever; but it is equally certain that these Deuteronomic writers could not have fabricated the specific incident of Maachah and her idol, but must, instead, have culled it from some ancient source. Considerable additional light is shed upon this interesting incident by the parallel account in II Chron. 14.1-4 and 15.1-18. 14.1-4, quite in the Chronicler's characteristic manner, summar izes his account of the reformation of Asa by representing it as complete, final and conventional in every way. No specific inci dents are recounted here. Asa removes all the altars, high places, sacred pillars, and other objects essential to non-Yahwistic wor ship, and thus brings Israel back once more to the true worship of Yahwe. In contrast to this, the account of this reformation in 15.1-18 is less sweeping and more specific. Here the reformation is not as far-reaching and complete as in 14.1-4. The high places are not removed, and the reformation takes a particular direction. In this respect this account in II Chron. 15.1-18 agrees fully with the account in I Ki. 15.12-14; and in v. 16 it repeats the incident of the removal of Maachah and the destruction of her idol in</page><page sequence="107">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 107 language almost identical with that of I Ki. 15.13. But preceding this II Chron. 15.1-15 contains a number of specific details of this reformation of more than passing interest. It tells how this reformation was instigated by a certain Azariah ben 'Oded,108 upon whom the divine spirit rested. He appeared before the king and challenged him to reflect that Yahwe would be with Israel only so long as they would be with Him, that if they would seek Him truly, they would surely find Him, but if they were faithless to Him, He in turn would surely forsake them. Stirred by this unanswerable argument and by the prophetic message of Azariah, Asa summoned all the people to Jerusalem in the third month of his fifteenth year. There they offered sacrifices and entered into a covenant with Yahwe to wor ship Him truly and Him alone, and they sealed this covenant with an oath. Thereupon it was that Asa removed his mother Maachah and destroyed her idol. It is hardly likely that this tradition was the invention of the Chronicler, even though some of the editorial insertions in the chapter may well emanate from him. As we have seen, his account of this reformation is given in 14.1-4, and is not only quite con ventional,ventional, but also contradicts in a few details the account of 15.1-18. Moreover this narrative here, and particularly those details which are missing from the account of I Ki. 15.12-14, bear all the earmarks of antiquity and originality. It is significant that Azariah's representation of Israel's relationship to Yahwe is that of a covenant with perfect mutuality between the two contracting parties; so long as Israel worships Yahwe truly, Yahwe will pro tect and prosper Israel; but if Israel is faithless to Yahwe, and particularly, it would seem, if Israel worships other gods, and employs idols in its worship, and practices strange rites not com manded by Yahwe, then the covenant will automatically be abrogated, and Yahwe will in turn forsake Israel. It is true that this thought too is conventional; but it was the conventional 108 Both Lidzbarski (Ephemeris fiir semitische Epigraphik, III, 8, following Halevy), and Montgomery (JBL, 28 [1909], 69) suggest that עודד probably means "diviner", and is here an official title rather than a proper name.</page><page sequence="108">108 JULIAN MORGENSTERN thought only of the pre-exilic prophets; the post-exilic prophets had an entirely different dogma, viz. that despite Israel's sins and faithlessness Yahwe must still forgive and keep it as His people, whether for His name's sake, as Ezekiel taught, or to fulfill His divine purpose of world-wide salvation, as Deutero-Isaiah pro claimed, or for some other reason. Only Deuteronomic writers at the very latest could have conceived of the covenant idea in the manner of II Chron. 15.2. Manifestly therefore this narrative cannot have been invented by the Chronicler, but must have been drawn by him from some older, pre-exilic source. Likewise in v.3 the term כהן מורה, "oracular priest," and the use of תורה in its old sense, "oracular decision" or "revelation," indicate a literary origin Deuteronomic at the very latest. But the remaining details, the account of the solemnization of the cov enant and its sealing with a sacrifice and an oath, and the fixing of the exact date thereof, together with the account of the disposal of Maachah and her idol, are too specific to have been created by the fancy of Deuteronomic writers. We may posit this no more than we may posit that the Chronicler himself fabricated the entire story. The very fact that, with the exception of the single Maachah incident, this entire narrative is not found in I Ki. 15, is the best proof that the Deuteronomists did not invent the story ; for had they done so they would certainly have included it in their narrative in I Ki. 15. On the other hand, assuming that this narrative, or at least its nucleus, is of pre-Deuteronomic origin, we can easily understand the motives of the Deuteronomic authors of I Ki. 15 in omitting it from that passage. Its similarity, to the Deuteronomic account of the reformation of Josiah is self apparent; and in their partiality for their own reformation, they naturally minimized the significance of all preceding reformations, not only this of Asa, but also that of Elisha and Jehu and that of Hezekiah as well, as we shall learn in due time. Consequently in I Ki. 15. 12-14 they contented themselves with a mere general statement about this reformation of Asa, cited the one specific instance of the removal of Maachah and the destruction of her idol, and then added the to them all-important note that of course this was by no means a complete and final reformation ; the high places had not yet been removed, and in consequence much still</page><page sequence="109">THE THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 109 remained to be done in the way of the purification of the worship of Yahwe. These considerations indicate that the Chronicler drew his account of the reformation of Asa from some older, pre-Deutero nomic source, one to which the Deuteronomic authors of I Ki. 15 also had access, but from which, for reasons of their own, they culled only one incident, whereas the Chronicler drew far more generously upon this source, although, in his characteristic man ner, he elaborated his material freely. This is confirmed by one interesting fact; I Ki. 15.1.3 tells that Asa cut down the mifleset of MaachahMaachah and burned it in the Kidron Valley. II Chron. 15.15 employs exactly the same language with the addition of one little word. It tells that in addition to cutting down the image, Asa had it ground into dust before he burned it. This reminds us strongly of almost the identical procedure of Moses with the golden calf. Ex. 32.20 tells that Moses burned the calf in fire, then ground it into fine dust, which he strewed upon the surface of the water, and which he then caused the people to drink. The Deuteronomic version of this incident105 omits all reference to the people being compelled by Moses to drink this water, and tells merely that Moses strewed the dust of the image upon the stream which came down from the mountain. Manifestly this Deutero nomic nomic version of the disposal of the golden calf approximates the Deuteronomic account of Asa's disposal of his mother's image more closely than does the narrative in Ex. 32.20. Unquestion ably these two narratives are closely related. The Kidron Brook, flowing in the bottom of the Kidron Valley, could have provided the water upon which Asa might have had the ashes of the mifleset strewed, just as Moses strewed the ashes of the golden calf upon the water at the foot of the mourttain. Still another consideration points to the association of the story of the golden calf with this of the destruction of Maachah's mifleset.mifleset. Here we are told that this happened in the third month, at a time when the king had summoned all the people to Jerusa lem to solemnize this covenant. But we may be sure that in the original version of this incident the occasion of the people's 10« Deut. 9.21.</page><page sequence="110">110 JULIAN MORGENSTERN assembling in Jerusalem was not the mere command of the king, but, just as in II Ki. 23.21 the gathering of the people in order to observe the Passover gave the occasion for the solemnization of the Deuteronomic covenant, so here, the gathering of a large group of the people for the celebration of the Katzir- or Shabuoth festival in the third month furnished the occasion for the solem nization of the covenant of Asa. Now the story of the golden calf tells that while Moses was upon the mountain the people, assembled below, celebrated a hag or religious festival, at which the calf was the center of worship. Likewise Ex. 19,1 states that it was in the third month that Moses went up the mountain to receive the ten commandments; and tradition has steadily associated the giving of the ten com mandments and the solemnization of the covenant between Yah we and Israel on the basis of these with the Shabuoth-festival in the third month. Here then is another significant point of con tact between the account of Asa's destruction of his mother's miflesetmifleset and the story of the golden calf. And still a third point of contact between the two narratives may be seen in the fact that in both the destruction of the golden calf and the destruction of the mifleset are followed by the solem nization of a covenant between Yahwe and Israel. This is the crowning act of both narratives. Nay more; II Chron. 15.14-15 tells that the people seal the covenant in the reign of Asa with an oath. This is of particular significance. A covenant implies a compact, mutually obligatory upon both contracting parties, and with the conditions to be observed by each clearly stated, or at least clearly understood. We have seen just how these conditions were complied with and what the basis of the covenant in the K document was. We can hardly conceive of the covenant in the reign of Asa without pre supposing some parallel procedure and some formulation of the fundamental principles which the people obligated themselves to observe in their subsequent worship of Yahwe. We have also seen that the K document must have contained originally an account of the solemnization of the covenant, quite similar in every essential detail to the account of the solemnization of the covenant in C, found in Ex. 24.4-8. In particular it must have</page><page sequence="111">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 111 concluded with a formal acceptance of the covenant by the people by means of a declaration similar to that of Ex. 24.7b, "All that Yahwe hath said, we will do." Just such a declaration as this made the covenant binding and effective. And not only must the K document have contained some such statement as this, but likewise the covenant in the reign of Asa, and every similar cove nant between Yahwe and Israel, must have been similarly ratified. Consequently we may conclude that the reference in II Chron. 15.14-15 to the oath by which the people ratify the covenant in the reign of Asa refers to just such a declaration as this. This constitutes a further parallel between the narrative of the solem nization of the covenant in the reign of Asa and that recorded in the K document. We need therefore hesitate no longer in identifying the two incidents and in regarding the incident of the covenant in the reign of Asa as the original and the historical antecedent of the tradition of the covenant recorded in the K document. This implies, of course, some direct relationship between the K document, or rather the fragment of the K document preserved in Ex. 33 and 34, and the story of the golden calf in Ex. 32. This does not mean necessarily, however, that Ex. 32 or any part thereof must belong to the K document. Ex. 32 is one of the most difficult chapters in the Hexateuch to analyze satisfactorily, as a reference to any of the standard commentaries will show. This is due quite as much to the obscurity governing some of the details of the narrative, as, for example, the peculiar incident of the Levites in vv. 26-29, as to the fact that the chapter is manifestly a patchwork from several sources, and furthermore that it has been reedited more than once and from various points of view and for varying purposes. An altogether satisfactory analysis and interpretation of the chapter have probably not yet been offered. It would be futile to assert here that any part of this chapter was actually culled from K. It suffices to posit that K must have contained a tradition telling that at the mountain of Yahwe Israel did worship a molten image of some kind, similar to the golden calf here or to the mifleçet oi Maachah, and that because of this Yahwe commanded Moses to lead Israel away from the sacred mountain; this tradition gradually, through restatement and accretions from successive writers and editors, developed into</page><page sequence="112">112 JULIAN MORGENSTERN the present narrative of the golden calf. It is noteworthy that Ex. 32.4 and 8, Deut. 9.16 and Ps. 106.19 call the calf a massekah, a molten image; and whatever the image of the original K nar rative may have been, it too must have been a massekah likewise, just as the mifleset of Maachah no doubt actually was also. This circle of evidence and argument makes clear the full import of the first two laws of the K code, "Thou shalt worship no other god," and "Thou shalt make no molten idols." These two laws, which undoubtedly express the dominant spirit and purpose of the K code and narrative, have a twofold meaning when we under stand that, as introductory to them, the K document must have told that Israel had actually worshiped at the sacred mountain of Yahwe the molten image of some other deity. But they have even more than a twofold meaning if we realize that they sound the keynote of the first great religious reformation in Israel, directed against the image-worship of the Southern Kingdom in the fifteenth year of Asa, and particularly against the extraordi nary image, called specifically the mifleset, which Maachah, the queen-mother, had made.110 In all likelihood Maachah was the leader of the aristocratic, cultured, court party, which upheld with all their power the modes of life and worship which had been in vogue among them since the days of Solomon. The opposition to them must have been growing stronger with each passing day. The leaders of this 1,0 Perhaps we have here too the key to the explanation of the change of אלהי מסכה, "gods of molten metal," of 34.17 to אלהי כסף ואלהי זהב, "gods of silver and gods of gold," of 20.33. For, as we maintain, the C code was the product of the reformation of Elisha and Jehu in the Northern Kingdom in 842 B.C. Therefore, it marked the climax of the long period of agricultural, commercial and political prosperity of this Kingdom under Ahab and his dynasty. And in its reform purposes it combatted no doubt not only the many images of the Tyrian Ba'al and kindred foreign deities, whose cults had been introduced into Israel, but it was also directed in all likelihood against the golden Ba'al images in the form of a bull or a calf which Jerobeam had set up at Dan and Bethel (I Ki. 12.28). These and similar images made of the precious metals, probably comparatively common in the Northern Kingdom during this period of material prosperity, would be designated more specifically and aptly as "gods of silver and gods of gold" than as merely "gods of molten metal."</page><page sequence="113">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 113 opposition were undoubtedly the prophets of the day, reenforced by various elements, among others, as we shall see in time, by the very descendents of the Kenites, the Rechabites. Their program was the restoration of the old, simple worship of Yahwe and its purging of all foreign, idolatrous elements, particularly the use of molten images, such as the mifleset of Maachah. This must have seemed to them the arch-symbol of all that was non-Yahwistic and impure in their official state-religion ; it must have vexed and irritated them beyond all else, and against it in particular their iconoclastic rage must have been especially directed. Fortunately for them Asa seems to have come to the throne as an immature and impressionable youth, or even boy. This is to be inferred from the fact that his father had died after a reign of barely three years, and that his own reign endured for forty-one years. Not improbably his mother Maachah had acted as regent during his minority; for this seems to be the implication of the statement of I Ki. 15.13 that he removed her from the gbirah. The word itself can mean both "queen" and "queen-mother," and also designate the person bearing this title as the ruler. But in the capacity of queen or queen-mother alone Maachah could scarcely have been removed from her position. This could happen only if she had been acting as regent, and if at a certain time, when he became of age, as it were, or reached the age of maturity and responsibility, Asa deposed her from her high office and took the reigns of government in his own hands. The young king seems to have been, like his son Jehosaphat and other, later members of his dynasty, particularly amenable to prophetic influence. At any rate the narrative of I Ki. 15.13 and II Chron. 15.1-18 seems to imply that after fourteen years of nominal reign, in his fifteenth year, when he had reached probably the age of discretion, and was also no doubt influenced by his prophetic advisers, he turned against his mother and her party. He removed her from her high position and shore her and her party of all power. He destroyed her mifleset, and then introduced a far-reaching religious reform, directed chiefly against the elaborate image-worship of the day, and designed to restore, as far as this was possible, the true Yahwe-worship in all its pristine simplicity and purity, particu larly as conceived by the prophets of his day and their associates,</page><page sequence="114">114 JULIAN MORGENSTERN among others, the Rechabites. The program of his reformation was furnished, we believe, by the little code of laws of K. Certainly this code and the entire K document mirror well what must have been the conception of Yahwe and Yahwe-wor ship prevailing in that early day, particularly among the reaction ary group of prophets and their followers, the farmers and shep herds, the villagers and semi-nomads, of Judah. The conception of Yahwe depicted in the narrative portion of K, was still, as we have seen, the conception of the prophet Elijah a generation after this reformation. Still in Elijah's day, it is clear, the prophetic party believed that Yahwe dwelt, not in the temple at Jerusalem, but on His sacred mountain out in the desert, and in the cave upon this mountain His closest and most ardent devotee might hold communion with Him. Certainly too the cultural and economic conditions, which we have established as the background of the K code, obtained in the Southern Kingdom more completely during the reign of Asa than at any other time in its history. It was late enough for the old pastoral life and religious institutions to be largely, though not yet entirely, outgrown, for the Passover-festival to have been absorbed by the agricultural Matzoth-festival, but for the old Passover-sacrifice, offered for the protection of each home and its inmates, to be still observed. It was still early enough for other ancient, pastoral institutions to survive spontaneously, although without full understanding any longer of their original import, such as the custom of not seething a kid in the milk of its mother. First-born children were still sacrificed, and firstling animals were still offered in large numbers at the annual Matzoth-festival, which had come to take the place of the old, pastoral Passover. But other religious institutions of unmistakable, agricultural origin, such as the Sabbath and the three annual harvest festivals, had been celebrated for so long a period, that they had become firmly-rooted and beyond all suspicion as to their Yahwe-char acter in the practice of the people at large, even those of the prophetic party. This stage of development could hardly have been reached much before the time of Asa. And on the other hand, we can hardly conceive of the institutions surviving from the old, pastoral days still spontaneously having the force and</page><page sequence="115">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 115 validity which they clearly have in the K code, at a time much later than that of Asa. Moreover, the strongly reactionary character of the K code, which we have noted, finds its most natural explanation in the reformation of Asa. For that was essentially a reactionary refor mation, away from the unquestionably higher cultural standards of the ,aristocratic court party, with their roots in commercial activities, foreign contacts and royal, autocratic government, back to the old, simple, semi-agricultural, semi-pastoral stand ards of the prophet-people party. And finally, there is the significant fact of the Kenite origins and background of the K document. This can be accounted for, as has been intimated, only by the assumption of some form of Kenite interest or participation in this reformation. The depen dence of the little code which constituted the nucleus of the Book of the Covenant upon the code of the K document has been already established. In the sequel to this paper, in which we shall make a detailed analysis of the entire Book of the Covenant, and determine its literary history, we shall have to come to the con elusion that the original C code constituted similarly the program of a reformation, that of Elisha and Jehu, in the Northern King dom in 842 B.C. Of course we might account for the transmission of the K code, a half century after its composition, from the Southern Kingdom to the Northern Kingdom, and its reinterpre tation there to meet the conditions of that part of the country at that particular period in various ways, especially by the assump tion of close prophetic contacts between the two parts of the country. But a far more probable explanation suggests itself. II Ki. 10.15-16 tells of the presence of Jonadab ben Rechab in the Northern Kingdom just at the time of the Elisha-Jehu revolution and reformation, and of his participation therein. The nature of his participation is not clear, but it must have been active and significant to receive even this mention. Still in the days of Jeremiah1" the Rechabites were regarded as the faithful and uncompromising champions of the old pastoral life and simple '» Jer. 35.2ff.</page><page sequence="116">116 JULIAN MORGENSTERN worship of Yahwe. Their native abode must have been in south em Judah, but because their country was then overrun by the invading hordes of Nebuchadrezzar and other enemies, they had sought refuge in Jerusalem. They looked back to their ancestor of almost three centuries past, Jonadab ben Rechab, as the one who had established those standards of Yahwe pastoral life and simple worship for them. We can account for the presence of this very Jonadab in the Northern Kingdom, far from his native home, at the very moment of the Elisha-Jehu revolution and reformation, and for his contact with Jehu at the critical moment not as an accidental thing, but as purposed. He must have been an influential and active partici pant and leader in that reformation. And since he had come from the South, he it probably was who transmitted the Southern K code to his Northern associates. But his interest in this K code can be best explained by the assumption that he himself in his early days, fifty-seven years before this, or more likely his father or grandfather before him, had played an active and determining role in the reformation of Asa in the Southern Kingdom and in the framing of the K code then. But according to I Chron. 2.55 the Rechabites were descended from, or probably better were a clan of, the Kenites.112 Certainly the Rechabites' native home was just in that part of Judah in which Jud. 1.16 and 4.11 and I Sam. 15.6 represent the Kenites as dwelling. We can therefore best account for the strong Kenite tradition and background of the K document by the assumption that the Kenites, or more specifically the Rechabites, were active participants in the reformation of Asa in 899 B.C. as well as in that of Elisha and Jehu in 842 B.C., and that they made their own large and specific contribution to the content and character of the K document."3 112 Cf. Luther, in Meyer, Die Israeliten und, Ihre Nachbarstàmme, 132f. 113 This suggests a possible and plausible explanation of one question raised by this code, viz. that of the sacrifice of firstlings. We have seen that 34.19a undoubtedly commands the sacrifice to Yahwe of all firstlings and first-born children. This command is absolute. Yet it is by no means improb able that it too, like several other laws of the K code, is distinctly reactionary in character. It may well have been that the culturally advanced and progressive court party had largely outgrown the institution of child sacrifice already at this early date, and perhaps even practiced the substitution of an animal sacri</page><page sequence="117">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 117 On the basis of this by no means inconsiderable mass of evi dence we may conclude with reasonable certainty that the K code and document were composed in the Southern Kingdom in the fifteenth year of Asa, 899 B.C., by the leaders of the prophetic party in close association with the Rechabites of the Kenite tribe. Influenced by them, and with their little code of laws as his guide, Asa brought about the first great religious reformation in Israel. fice for that of children, 01־ in some other approved and conventional manner evaded the original grim and grievous sacrifice. But a movement whose aim was to reintroduce the old Yahwe-worship in all its original simplicity, even despite its primitive severity, particularly as it was believed to have been practiced in the former pastoral or semi-pastoral days, might well have gone so far as to insist upon the restoration of first-born sacrifices along with those of firstlings. Not impossibly they might have even justified their demand for this restoration by the theory that the various national calamities which had recently befallen Israel, had been brought by Yahwe, enraged and as a proper punishment, because He had been deprived of His proper due, viz. the sacrifice of first-born children. Such an argument and such a procedure would not be without exact parallel in Semitic religious history. Thus the Carthaginians accounted for the defeat of their armies and the siege of their city by Agathocles of Syracuse by the supposition that Saturn was angry against them because they had per mitted the sacrifice of other children, secretly bought and substituted for the first-born children of their noble families. Accordingly, to appease their enraged deity and save themselves and their city, they now sacrificed some five hundred of the children of their first families (Diodorus Siculus, 20.14.) Quite similarly the Bible tells that the king of Moab, besieged in his capital by Israel, and in desperate straits, sacrificed his first-born son, who was to become king after him, upon the wall of the besieged city in the sight of the armies of Israel. This sacrifice was undoubtedly designed to regain the favor of a deity, presum ably angered because this supreme sacrifice, which was his old, established due, had been withheld from him. Apparently the sacrifice was believed to have been efficacious, for immediately thereafter, and for 110 apparent reason what soever, the armies of Israel withdrew from the siege of the city (II Ki. 3.27). (This(This evidence might be multiplied considerably, were it necessary. I have discussed this subject in great detail in Rites of Birth, Marriage, Death and Kindred Kindred Occasions among the Semites.) In the light of these instances the hypo thesis becomes extremely plausible, and when considered in connection with the manifest reactionary character of the K code, even quite probable, that this law commanding absolutely the sacrifice to Yahwe of all first-born, like other laws of this code, was also reactionary in character, away from a more advanced and milder practice, and may have been due in considerable measure to the uncompromising, fanatical influence of the pastoral or semi-pastoral Rechabites.</page><page sequence="118">118 JULIAN MORGENSTERN Both in character and in the method of procedure this reformation of Asa became the model for all later prophetic reformations in fsrael, the reformations of Elisha and Jehu in 842 B.C., the refor mation in the reign of Hezekiah, likewise directed against idol worship, and specifically against the image of the brazen serpent,114 and the Deuteronomic Reformation in the eighteenth year of Josiah.115 In fact the parallelism between the reformation of Josiah and that of Asa is startlingly close. In both cases we have a king ascending the throne as a mere lad, coming under the strong influence of the prophetic party, and finally, after fifteen years in the one case and eighteen years in the other, induced by them to inaugurate a sweeping religious reformation, directed chiefly against foreign, idolatrous elements in the cult of Yahwe, and designed to restore the theoretically old, simple Yahwe wor ship, as the prophets conceived it to have been. Both reformations are carried out upon the basis of a code of laws, ascribed to Moses, the traditional founder of the worship of Yahwe, by Israel; each code of laws sets forth the fundamental principles of pure Yahwe worship, as its prophetic authors conceived them. It is not at all unlikely that the prophetic procedure in connection with the reformation of Asa suggested to the prophetic party in the time of Josiah the program which they followed in inducing Josiah to inaugurate his reformation. For in all probability it was just because already in the days of Asa the tradition was strong that Yahwe-worship in Israel began with Moses, that the prophetic authors of the K code repre sen ted their code as composed, not by themselves, but as coming from Moses and having been revealed to him by Yahwe. Un doubtedly the ancient traditions supported them in this, or rather furnished the grounds and the justification for this procedure. For no doubt they thought very sincerely, just as did the prophets after them, that they were originating nothing new, but were merely reaffirming and reenforcing the old and sacred principles of true Yahwe-worship, communicated of yore by Yahwe to Moses at the time when He first entered into covenant relation with Israel. The old traditions furnished them with most of the narra II. Ki. 18.4. "s II Ki. 22-23.</page><page sequence="119">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 119 tive framework and also the general content and the dominant spirit of their code. The rest was their own, largely unconscious creation, springing out of the formulation of the old traditions and traditional principles of Yahwe-worship with relation to the par ticular religious problem and crisis of their own day. In this way the K document came into being, the oldest document of the Hexateuch. IX OTHER POSSIBLE PORTIONS AND CONTENTS OF THE K DOCUMENT. Still two other passages of the Hexateuch must be closely correlated with the K document, both at least as to content and one as to literary form. The first of these is the account of the "tent of meeting" in Ex. 33.7-11. I have treated of this passage in great detail in a previous article,116 and have shown there that although the vast majority of Biblical scholars assign the passage to E, the evidence is ample and convincing that it must belong to J. Characteristic of J are the theophany in the pillar of cloud at the door of the tent in vv. 9f., the fact that Moses speaks to Yahwe face to face, and the youthful Joshua, the personal attend ant of Moses and his apprentice in the oracular priesthood, re maining constantly in the tent in order to receive the oracle whenever Yahwe should choose to communicate it. The tent appears here for the first time unexpectedly and without previous preparation. Despite this, upon this, its very first appearance it has the article, is already "the tent." Scholars have accounted for this by the assumption that the tent was made from the jewels and ornaments of the people referred to in vv. 5bc-6. This is, however, both a gratuitous and an unjustified assumption. In the first place, those two verses come from E, and not from J, as the reference to Horeb in v.6 indicates. They parallel the J account of the giving of their ornaments by the people to Aaron in order to make the golden calf, in Ex. 32.2-3. And on the other hand a tent such as this could hardly have been made from the jewels and other personal ornaments of the people; some more substantial material would have been required. Manifestly vv. 7-11 have no connection whatsoever with the verses immediately "The Tent of Meeting," AJSL, 38 (1918), 125-139.</page><page sequence="120">120 JULIAN MORGENSTERN preceding, nor at first sight apparently also with the fragment of the K document which follows. But, as I have shown in the afore-mentioned article, this "tent of meeting" was undoubtedly patterned after the sacred cave upon the mountain, of the K document. This tent too was primarily the place of consultation of the oracle, rather than the supposed dwelling-place of the Deity. Within the tent the oracu lar priest would remain, awaiting the coming of Yahwe with His impending revelation, and at the proper moment he would take his stand in the door of the tent. And there at the door he would meet with Yahwe. Hence the name, אהל מועד, "tent of meeting," the place where the people, through their representative, the oracular priest, would meet with Yahwe."7 The priest would stand within the door, and Yahwe, apparently, would stand or pass by in the open space in front of the door, and in the moment of standing or passing communicate His will and purpose to the priest. Unmistakably this "tent of meeting" was originally designed to be a representation of the sacred cave of Yahwe, one which the people could carry with them upon their journeyings. And in all likelihood, just because it was the replica of the sacred cave, this "tent of meeting" was, during the early period of their sojourn in Canaan, the place of oracular revelation, and the sacred shrine or palladium of the tribes who, under the leadership of Moses, entered the land from the south. To this tent Yahwe was thought to come, either when summoned in the traditional way by the oracular priest, or of His own free will. That this idea of the coming of Yahwe from His mountain abode in the desert in order to aid or to bring revelation to His people, is no gratuitous assumption, is proved by the specific references to this procedure in Deut. 33.2 and Jud. 5.4. We should perhaps interpret both 117 Even the Priestly Code preserves a strong reminiscence that the door of the tabernacle was the place where Yahwe met with the children of Israel (Ex. 29.42-43). In this same article I have suggested that the דביר of Solomon's temple and the holy of holies of the tabernacle of the Priestly Code were like wise wise patterned after the sacred cave. That this was a common institution of west-Semitic temples, and passed from them to the Greeks may be inferred from the fact that the sacred, oracular cave-chamber of the large Greek sanctu aries was called pkyapov, unmistakably a Hellenization of the Hebrew, and probably also Phoenician, מערה, "cave."</page><page sequence="121">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 121 these verses as referring, not to a single instance of Yahwe's com ing, but to the regular procedure of His coming; "Yahwe comes from Sinai, and shines forth unto them from Se'ir," and "Yahwe, when Thou comest from Se'ir, when Thou steppest forth from the country of Edom." And having this "tent of meeting" in their midst, and meet ing there with Yahwe frequently, through the mediation of their oracular priest, it was easy for the people to worship Yahwe, even though far from His permanent abode. They had no need of idol or cult object or any representation of Yahwe whatsoever; the "tent of meeting" sufficed for all their needs. Only on the rarest of occasions, when he felt an irresistible need and urge to com mune with Yahwe directly and in person, did His closest devotee pilgrim to the mountain in the desert where Yahwe was thought to dwell; this was the procedure of Elijah. But for the people at large and for all ordinary occasions the presence of the "tent of meeting" and of the oracular priest in their midst sufficed for all the demands of worship. It is clear from this that not only is this representation of the "tent of meeting" in perfect accord with the details of the narra tive of the K document, but also that the origin and true signifi cance of this "tent of meeting" can be understood aright only with the K narrative as its historic background. Nay more; this "tent of meeting" supplies an important and otherwise missing link in the K narrative and theology ; for it alone explains, on the one hand, how it was possible for the tribes of Israel settled in Canaan to worship Yahwe, dwelling upon a distant mountain, and on the other hand it alone accounts simply and naturally, for the otherwise unparalleled and inexplicable antipathy of the traditional Yahwe-worship to the use of images or idols. We must therefore conclude that the original K document contained the account of the making of this "tent of meeting" by Moses, cer tainly at Yahwe's command, and of the inauguration of its use. In the original K document this stood of course, not where we find it now, before the account of the covenant between Yahwe and Israel, but after it. In all likelihood it followed immediately upon the now missing account of the solemnization of the covenant. Its original position is now filled by the J2 narrative of Moses with</page><page sequence="122">122 JULIAN MORGENSTERN the shining face, in 34.29-35. But the original K narrative con tained matter of too great religious and historical significance to be discarded completely. Consequently the J2 editors, who incorporated the old K document with their own J code, rewrote the K tradition of the "tent of meeting" to accord with their own theology and conception of Moses and of divine revelation through him, and inserted it, no longer in its original place, since this was now filled by another tradition, but in the only place available, just before the K account of Yahwe's command to Moses to lead the people away from the mountain. That this position was illogical, in that it brought in the "tent of meeting" too soon and without the necessary preparation, apparently did not trouble them in the least.118 118 It is tempting indeed to regard 34.7-11 as taken over bodily from the K document; but this may not be. The evidences of J authorship mentioned above are too strong to permit this. Furthermore there is one very serious and altogether irreconcilable contradiction between this passage and the K nar rative, viz. that whereas the K narrative says explicitly, in 34.20, that no man, not even Moses, might behold the face of Yah we, v. 11 says with equal explicit ness that Yahwe would speak to Moses face to face, precisely as one man speaks to to another. This thought accords of course with the J2 narrative of Moses with the shining face. None the less it may be that just a slight nucleus of vv.7-11 is quoted literally from the original K account of the "tent of meeting." As has been pointed out, the use of the article in האהל in v.7 implies a previous statement of what tent this was. No such statement occurs in the present text of the Hexa teuch; it must therefore have stood in the original, and this original was of course K. Moreover, in this same verse the words הרחק סן הסחנה, following immediately upon מחוץ למחנה, seem awkward and somewhat tautological. Certainly the words אשר מחוץ למהנה at the very end of the sentence are alto gether superfluous and suspicious. Furthermore the words וקרא לו אהל מועד are, to say the very least, awkward; they suggest that the account of the build ing of this tent and explanation of its technical name אהל מועד had preceded v.7 in the original narrative, but having been omitted, the editor supplied the missing but indispensable information by inserting, though rather inelegantly, this little note. This implies though that the opening words of the sentence were quoted from the original K version. This probably read, ומשה יקה את (or perhaps האהל ונטה לו הרחק מן המחנה והיה כל מבקש יהוה יצא אל אהל נה&gt;מועד נשמה. This conclusion is corroborated by another consideration. The last part of this verse, particularly in this, its original form, tells that every one who wished to consult the oracle would go out to the "tent of meeting" at some distance from the camp. The implication is that the priest of the oracle, certainly Moses, remained at the tent all the time, jÉst as v.llb represents his</page><page sequence="123">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 123 But if the account of the construction and use of the "tent of meeting" was an integral part of the K document, as we maintain, then unquestionably this was not merely incidental and without specific import. In all certainty it is another and very significant expression of the dominant reactionary spirit of the K document. It represents a striking protest against the Temple at Jerusalem and the elaborate cult associated therewith, both in the worship of Yahwe and in that of the various foteign deities who had found place there. In this year 899 B.C. the Temple at Jerusalem was still a comparatively new institution, certainly not more than sixty-five years old at the very most. Despite the later traditions of Davidic preparations for its erection, this Temple was certainly an innovation of far-reaching character in the religious practice of Israel, and one which could scarcely have met with universal approval. It had been erected by Phoenician architects and artisans and after Phoenician models. Almost from the moment of its dedication the cults of foreign deities had found lodgment in it alongside of an elaborate Yahwe-cult, which had departed far from its pristine simplicity. Small wonder therefore if the advocates of this reform move ment, with its reactionary program and code, looked more or less suspiciously upon the Temple at Jerusalem and regarded it as the apprentice Joshua as doing. We shall have strong confirmation of this con elusion shortly. But the central thought of vv.8-11, the work of J2, is not that the people at large would go out to the tent to consult the oracle, but that Moses would go out there, and there, in the sight of all the people, would meet with Yahwe and speak to Him face to face; this is a motif of altogether different character and import; it is rather the motif of the narrative of Moses with the shining face, in vv. 29-30, likewise the work of J2. This told how Moses' face would shine with unbearable, divine radiance whenever he would return to the people in the camp, after conversing with Yahwe face to face at the door of the "tent of meeting." But this was certainly not a part of the original K account of the "tent of meeting." Moreover, if the "tent of meeting" had been located at a considerable distance from the camp, as v.7 states, it would not have been so easy for the people, standing at the entrances of their tents within the camp, to see what was going on at the door of the "tent of meet ing." For this reason we must assign the words הרחק מן המחנה in v.7 to the original quotation from K, and regard their parallel, מחוץ למנחה, as secondary. All this, however, makes quite probable our assumption that the above-cited words in v.7 are actually a literal quotation from the original K account of the "tent of meeting."</page><page sequence="124">124 JULIAN MORGENSTERN very center and stronghold of that form of worship which they were seeking to eradicate. What more natural therefore than that, in full accord with their program, they should by implica tion attempt to denounce and repudiate this elaborate, half foreign sanctuary, and offer as the proper place of worship in its stead the old, simple, primitive "tent of meeting," modeled after the sacred cave upon the mountain of Yahwe in the desert, the place, not of sacrifice nor of elaborate cult, but of the revelation of the oracle of Yahwe, so essential to Israel's welfare and progress. Along with the return of the old, simple, and to them the only true Yahwe-worship, they advocated most naturally a return to the old, simple, Yahwe-shrine, the "tent of meeting." This would account for the total absence of altar legislation in the K code, which we have noted, all the more significant because of the conspicuous role which this legislation plays in the parallel C code. It can signify but one thing, the complete disapprobation of, if not the absolute antagonism to the Temple at Jerusalem, of the authors and champions of the K code. And still more, it meant very positively that they did not regard the Temple at Jerusalem as the dwelling-place of Yahwe, nor believed that He had at all taken up His residence in the land. To them Yahwe still resided upon His mountain out in the desert, where Israel had first found Him at the time of the exodus in the days of Moses. There He might still be sought out by His most ardent devotees, and from there He came upon occasion to commune with His people and reveal His will unto them through the media of the "tent of meet ing" and the oracular priest.119 Hence the significance of the 1" Quite obviously there was only one "tent of meeting," and probably also only one oracular priest ministering therein. The tent which David set up in Jerusalem (II Sam. 6.17) was in alLlikelihood the old "tent of meeting" of his own tribe, Judah, which he had no doubt brought up thither in order to establish it as the national shrine or palladium of the new nation which he had called into existence. (So also Luther and Meyer in the latter's, Die Israeliten undund Ihre Nachbarstamme, 134ff. and 215). He caused the ark, as we shall see originally the cult object or palladium of Ephraim, to be deposited therein, and with it no doubt the ephod which Ebiathar had brought down to him, when he escaped from Nob (I Sam. 23.6), unquestionably originally the tribal cult object of Benjamin, and probably whatever other ancient tribal cult objects he could gather. He likewise had an altar erected in the tent (I Ki. 2.28f.), prob ably as a concession to other tribal cults. Thus he gave visible and concrete</page><page sequence="125">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 125 specific reference to the oracular priest, the כהן מורה, as a basic institution of the true Yahwe-worship in II Chron. 15.3, and the added statement there that for many years, i. e. since the erection illustration to the principle that Yahwe was now no longer a mere tribal god, but altogether the national god of Israel, the summation or composite, as it were, of all the old tribal gods. Probably David had in mind, at least at first, no national sanctuary beyond this. In fact II Sam. 7.6 states very explicitly, and probably in this records an ancient and authentic historical tradition, that Yahwe at first rejected the idea of a temple of wood and stone and expressed a decided preference for His ancient tent sanctuary. (Cf. Sellin, in Alttestamentliche Studien Rudolf Kittel zum 60. Geburtstag dargebracht, 172ff.) Later tradition, however, which came in time to recognize the Temple at Jerusalem as the established and legitimate national sanctuary, naturally represented this tent of David in Jerusalem as a mere temporary sanctuary, preparatory to the Temple itself. After the Temple had been erected by Solomon, and the original "tent of meeting" had in all likelihood been discarded, and probably had even disap peared, the several, ancient, tribal, cult objects originally deposited therein, and from there transferred to the new Temple, suffered various fates. The old ark of Ephraim came in time to be reinterpreted, first as the chest containing the two tablets of stone upon which the ten laws of the covenant were inscribed, and later, in the post-exilic Priestly Code, in addition thereto, as also the throne of Yahwe, upon which He dwelt in the holy of holies in the midst of Israel. Other original tribal cult objects no doubt gradually lost their significance and disappeared under the influence of developing national and later universalistic, religious thought. The brazen serpent, which was destroyed in the reforma tion of Hezekiah (I Ki. 18.4), and which probably played a role with relation to that reformation parallel in every way to that which the mifleçet of Maachah played with relation to the reformation of Asa, was in all likelihood just such an original tribal cult object. As late as the reign of Hezekiah, it would seem, it had retained something of its original aspect as a cult object and was still actually worshiped by the people at large. In fact a tradition had even grown up about it, accounting for its presence in the Temple and ascribing its origin, in characteristic manner, to Moses (Num. 21.4-9). Furthermore, the fact that seemingly all the tribes of Israel, with the single exception of Judah, had cult objects or idols such as these, whereas Judah had no cult object other than the "tent of meeting," in no sense an idol or repre sentation of Yahwe, tended in all likelihood to establish the principle, which became basic in the eventual national religion of Israel, that under no condition might Yahwe be represented by an image of any shape or kind. For unques tionably the tribe of Judah, the head of David's and Solomon's empire and of the subsequent Southern Kingdom, adjacent to whose territory the capital of the nation and the national sanctuary were situated, contributed the dominant characteristics to this national Yah we-worship, which evolved out of the</page><page sequence="126">126 JULIAN MORGENSTERN of the Temple at Jerusalem some sixty-five years before, Israel had been without a כהן מורה, of course because the old tent of meeting had been supplanted by the Temple. fusion of the various old tribal cults. In this development of the funda mental principles and institutions of this national Yahwe-worship the reforma tion of Asa and the K document were factors of primary importance. In this connection a striking Bedouin parallel to the "tent of meeting," as it must have been in its earliest form in ancient Israel, may be cited from Burckhardt {Nubia, 509, quoting Makrizi, History and. Description of Egypt). "They (the interior Bedja) adore the devil, and follow the example of their priests; every clan has its priest, who pitches a tent made of feathers, in the shape of a dome, wherein he practices his adorations; when they consult him about their affairs, he strips naked, and enters the tent stepping backwards; he afterwards issues with the appearance of a mad and delirious person, and exclaims, 'The devil salutes you, and tells you to depart from this place, for that a hostile party (naming it) will fall upon you.' If you ask advice about an expedition which you may be about to undertake against any particular coun try, he often answers, 'March on, and you will be victorious, and will take booty to such an amount, and the camels you will take at such a place must be my property, as well as the female slave you will find in such a tent, and the sheep, etc.' On the march the priest loads his tent upon a camel destined for that sole purpose, and they believe that the camel rises up from the ground and walks with great difficulty, and that it sweats profusely, although the tent is quite empty and nothing is in it." This account manifestly emanates from a loyal Moslem, one who was therefore not in sympathy with the institution which he describes, and which he in consequence associated with the devil. But making due allowance for this bias, the resultant account is strikingly illuminative of what must have been the similar practice in the oldest "tent of meeting." Both are places of consultation of the oracle and of revelation. In both a single oracular priest functions, and in both the priest stands within the tent to receive the divine communication. Perhaps even the ritual here of the priest being naked and entering the tent backwards at the time of revelation may have had its parallel in the oracular procedure of the old "tent of meeting." Certainly the fact that the oracular priest here came forth from the tent in a state of frenzy is paralleled by the J account (Num. 11.25ff.) of the seventy elders, gathered about the "tent of meeting" outside the camp, upon whom the divine spirit rested so that they became ecstatic. Perhaps even the fact that the Bedja tent was believed to be carried by its especial camel with extreme difficulty, manifestly because it was supposed to be carrying the deity of the tent at the same time, may have had its ancient parallel in the old "tent of meeting," and this might have sug gested the later Priestly tradition of Israel being led through the wilderness by the K'bod Yahive, so intimately associated in the Priestly narrative with the "tent of meeting."</page><page sequence="127">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCIi 127 But judging by the course of events, in this one respect these reformers failed of their purpose. For there is not the slightest evidence that the ancient "tent of meeting" was ever restored to its original role, or that the significance of the Temple at Jerusa lem as the center of the national religion of Israel was affected in the least by this reformation. But in their main purpose these reformers did succeed unquestionably, viz. the purification of the Temple cult of its most striking and objectionable foreign ele ments, and particularly idol worship. They made the Temple at Jerusalem in fact what it had previously been only in theory, the established center of the true worship of Yahwe as the national god of Israel. And with this they established firmly certain of the fundamental and unchanging principles of this worship. Their reformation marked the completion of the first stage in the evolu tion of the national religion of Israel, which David had begun. Still one other passage of the Hexateuch must be correlated with the K document, and probably consists in the main of a long extract therefrom, likewise removed from its original position, reedited, and then inserted in an altogether illogical and impos sible position, just as was done with Ex. 33.7-11. This passage is Ex. 18, the story, in its present form, of Moses' meeting with his father-in-law, Jethro, and of his appointment of the judges of the people upon Jethro's advice. A moment's thought makes it clear that even in its present form the story is out of place and comes too soon ; for it is impossible to presuppose the institution of the judges before the giving of the law. Moreover, the natural impli cation of the entire Sinai-Horeb narrative is that the first and chief thing to happen after the children of Israel had come thither was, not the visit of Jethro and the appointment of the judges, but the ascent of the mountain by Moses and the revelation of the law which, according to all the traditions recorded in the various documents, constituted the basis of the covenant solemnized at this mountain by Yahwe and Israel. The close connection of this narrative in Ex. 18 with the general content of the K document, as we have reconstructed it, has long been half recognized by Biblical scholars; and it was chiefly upon the basis of their interpretation of this chapter that the so-called Kenite hypothesis was evolved. The bases of this</page><page sequence="128">128 JULIAN MORGENSTERN hypothesis are the facts that in this chapter, just as elsewhere, the father-in-law of Moses is represented as the priest of Midian, that it is he who functions as the master of ceremonies at what is mani festly a covenant meal, eaten in the presence of Yahwe, that he rejoices to hear of Yahwe's victory over the Egyptian gods, and that he it is who counsels Moses to appoint the judges of the people and to lay the difficult, or perhaps better, the novel cases before Yahwe for oracular decision. From this they infer that he must have been the priest of Yahwe, versed therefore in the technique of the oracle of Yahwe, and that he must have in structed and initiated Moses therein, and thus have installed Moses as the oracular priest of Yahwe, and therefore as the founder of the worship of Yahwe in Israel. In part these conclu sions are correct and agree in the main with the far larger histor ical conclusions to be drawn from the entire K document, as we have reconstructed it, and of which apparently, these scholars had not the least intimation. As we have it now the narrative in Ex. 18 shows unmistak able evidence of editorial revision and expansion, although not upon a very large scale. The primary details of the narrative are as follows: the חתן of Moses hears that Moses and his people are encamped at the sacred mountain in the desert, and all that the Deity had wrought for them in delivering them from Egypt. Accompanied apparently by his own people, his clan or tribe, he comes to meet Moses. Moses comes out to welcome him. They greet each other in the warmest manner, and Moses conducts him into the tent. There Moses relates to him in detail all that Yahwe had done for them and how He had triumphed over the gods of the Egyptians. His חתן rejoices to hear all the good which Yahwe had shown unto Israel, and exclaims exultantly, "Praised be Yahwe, who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians; now I know that Yahwe is the greatest of all the gods." Thereupon Moses' חוזן prepares a sacrificial meal, of which the elders of Israel partake with him in the presence of Yahwe. Thereby a covenant is established between them and him. On the following day he sees Moses sitting, throughout the entire day apparently, to judge the people. He warns Moses that</page><page sequence="129">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 129 he cannot go on in this way indefinitely, for thereby he will only exhaust himself and render the people no permanent service. He counsels him instead to select capable men and delegate to them the actual task of judging the people. Only cases too difficult to decide, presumably because they are novel, and there is conse quently no law nor precedent for them, they shall bring to him, and he in turn, in his capacity as oracular priest, shall lay these cases before Yahwe for decision by the oracle. Impressed by the soundness of this argument, Moses follows the advice of his חתן. A number of significant facts stand out here. First, the people are called here Moses' people (v.l) or the people (v.10), where there was every reason for calling them Yahwe's people, had there not been some good cause for not doing so. In all the other codes of the Hexateuch this would have been done, because of their point of view that Israel was already Yahwe's people. Only in K, as we have seen, Israel does not become Yahwe's people, and therefore is not designated as such, until after the covenant is established between them. Moreover, in this narrative too, just as in K, the mountain where Israel is encamped is the "mountain of God," or, as it must have read originally, "the mountain of Yahwe." Furthermore, in v.7 Moses conducts his חתן into the tent. Of course this may mean Moses' own tent, in which he resided regularly. But the temptation is strong, in the light of the role which, we have seen, the "tent of meeting" played in the K narrative and of Moses' original relation thereto, to understand this as referring to the "tent of meeting." The incident of Moses' sitting all day to judge the people is of particular interest. Where does he sit, and by what methods or standards does he judge? There is not the slightest implication that these standards are one whit different after Moses has adopted the counsel of his חתן than they were before; only the method is different in part in that instead of Moses deciding all cases, the judges handle all the ordinary cases, for which there is already an established law or precedent, while Moses in his capacity as oracular priest, lays all the novel cases before the oracle for decision. Moses thus becomes the source of תורה or</page><page sequence="130">130 JULIAN MORGENSTERN oracular law, in Israel. But there is not the slightest implication here that Moses' חתן initiated him in the technique of the consul tation of the oracle. And if the tradition be correct, as we have interpreted it, that the "tent of meeting" was instituted by Moses at Yahwe's bidding, it carries with it the implication that Yahwe Himself, and not Moses' חתן, had revealed to him the full tech nique of the consultation of His, Yahwe's oracle, and therefore that the beginning of Yahwe-worship in Israel came through direct revelation from Yahwe Himself, and not from the Kenite priest. This technique of the oracle may have been known to Moses' חתן also, in his capacity as priest of Yahwe, but there is no need to imagine that he alone could have communicated it to Moses. It would be futile to conceive of Yahwe instituting the "tent of meeting" without at the same time communicating to Moses the full technique of the oracle. Apparently therefore all that Moses' חתן did was to give him the very sane counsel not to wear himself out by trying to bear alone the entire burden of judging the people, but to appoint capable assistants, and leave himself freer thereby to discharge that particular task which he alone could perform, viz. the consultation of the oracle. But if this assumption be correct, then we have the answer to our questions, where did Moses sit to give judgment, and by what standards did he mete judgment to the people? Manifestly he sat at the door of the "tent of meeting," the tent in which he, as oracular priest, remained constantly; and this was the tent into which he brought his חתן when the latter arrived at the camp of Israel. And Moses meted out judgment to the people by consult ing the oracle on their behalf, and imparting to them oracular decisions covering the cases which they laid before him. If it was a case for which there was a precedent in some earlier oracular decision, he applied this law to the case in hand. But if it was a novel case, for which there was no precedent, he laid the case before the oracle with the proper technique, and thus obtained a decision, and then communicated this to the people. Just this is the procedure implied in the statement of 33.7, which, we have concluded, stood originally in K, that every man who wanted to seek Yahwe, i.e. consult the oracle, would go out to the "tent of</page><page sequence="131">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 131 meeting" outside the camp. This was indeed a heavy task for one man to perform alone ; and the counsel of Moses' חיתן was sound indeed. All these considerations point to the conclusion, not only that this narrative is closely related to our K document, as the supporters of the Kenite hypothesis have unconsciously main tained, but even more, that it, or at least its original, constituted an integral part of the K document, and followed immediately upon the account of the preparation and inauguration of the "tent of meeting," and likewise preceded immediately the account of Israel's journey away from the mountain of Yahwe. Even more, assuming that the original of the narrative of Ex. 18 came at just this particular place in the K document, it fills completely what would otherwise have been a serious lacuna in the K narrative. As we have seen, the K narrative told that when Yahwe had answered Moses' request for a guide to lead the people onward from the mountain, He had said that His Panim would lead the people. But Moses had not understood this at first; nor does the narrative tell anywhere that Yahwe explained to Moses explicitly and positively just what He did mean thereby. He merely corrected the natural error into which Moses had fallen by asking to see Yahwe's face. But when Moses' תתן comes to meet him, Moses understands immediately just what Yahwe had meant. Apparently the ד1תן had come merely to visit Moses, since he was in his neighborhood, but had in mind no purpose beyond this. But now that he has come, and Moses now understands exactly what Yahwe had meant when He said that His Panim would lead Israel, he turns to his חתן and without further ado asks him to become Israel's guide through the desert. At first, as Num. 10.30 tells, Hobab demurs, and insists instead that he will return to his own land; but finally, upon Moses' insistence and cogent argument, he yields to Moses' request. Thus the assumption that the original of the narrative of Ex. 18 was an integral part of the K document, and came at just this particular point in the narrative, accounts in the first place for the presence of Hobab with Moses and Israel at the sacred mountain, and serves to connect the conclusion of the narrative in Ex. 34 with the fragment in Num. 10.29ff.</page><page sequence="132">132 JULIAN MORGENSTERN And one further consideration tends to confirm this assump tion. As the story stands now in Ex. 18, the visit of Moses' ד1תן has neither point nor purpose. He comes to spend a day or two with Moses and then go back home. Of course it may be argued, particularly by the advocates of the Kenite hypothesis in its generally accepted form, that the point of his visit was that he not only gave Moses the counsel which resulted in the institution of the judges, but also that he actually inducted Moses into the office of oracular priest; but, as we have argued, this last is an uncertain and unproved assumption ; and without it the present narrative in Ex. 18 is entirely without point. Nor could it have any point whatsoever were it a part of any of the Hexateuchal documents other than K, for all of them, as we have seen, have altogether different accounts of the way in which Israel was led through the desert from the sacred mountain to the Promised Land. Only K told that Israel was led by Hobab, Moses' jnh. This narrative can have point therefore only in K, for it explains how Hobab, who certainly had not participated with Moses and Israel in the exodus from Egypt and in the journey from there to the sacred mountain, none the less happened to be present with Israel and to be ready therefore to lead Israel onward.120 And still further corroboration of this conclusion may be 120 Perhaps one other difficult problem may be solved by the conclusion that both the narrative of the "tent of meeting" and that of the coming of Hobab to visit Moses belonged originally at this particular place in the K narrative. We have seen that the legend of Moses with the shining face has taken the place which these two narratives originally occupied. Whence could this strange tradition have come? Now if "face of Yahwe," was actually the ancient title of the oracular priest of Yahwe, as we have surmised, after the erection of the "tent of meeting" and the appointment of Moses by Yahwe as its oracular priest, he too must have borne the title, "face of Yahwe," quite as well as Hobab. Not improbably the original K narrative even spoke of him here by this title. But this title, no longer correctly understood by a later age, may well have suggested that Moses' face was like that of Yahwe, upon which ordinary mortals might not gaze with impunity. Once this idea was suggested, it would develop easily into the tradition of Moses with a shining face like that of Yahwe, just because he conversed with Yahwe face to face, as the ordinary man talks to his friend. Perhaps in some similar legend we have the explana tion of the oft-discussed Punic term, Tanit-pen-Ba' al.</page><page sequence="133">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 133 found in the words put into the mouth of Moses' חתן in v.23, that if Moses will but follow his advice, then not only will he be able to withstand the heavy demands which the leadership of the people must make upon him, but also the people will come to its place in peace. This last can refer only to the land promised to it by Yahwe. Of course J, E and P tell that Yahwe had long before this promised to give them the land of Canaan ; but this promise in these documents is almost too remote to have suggested such a thought to Moses' חתן at this particular moment. But in the K narrative this very promise, as we have seen, must have just been made to Israel by Yahwe, as a part of the covenant obligation resting upon Him, and this was the thought now uppermost in the minds of Moses and the people, preparing at Yahwe's command to journey onward from the sacred mountain to that good land which Yahwe had promised to them. In fact just such words as these in the mouth of his חתן would give Moses the desired oppor tunity to request, and even to demand, that he accompany them as their guide. The evidence is strong indeed that the narrative of Ex. 18 was once an integral part of the larger K narrative. The question now arises, whether any portion of the present text of Ex. 18 was borrowed by the editors literally from its original setting in the K document, or whether the entire present text is the result of editorial rewriting. The procedure of the editors was simple and is readily comprehended. Unquestionably the original of the K narrative called the חתן of Moses Hobab. In every case the editors naturally changed this original Hobab to Jethro, the name of Moses' father-in-law according to E. Simi larly, wherever necessary and possible they changed the original יהוה to אלהים, partly perhaps, if they were Elohists, because of their predilection for this designation of the Deity; but more particularly no doubt in order to soften the to them unwelcome suggestion that Moses' חתן was the original worshiper of Yahwe, and that it was through him, even though indirectly, that the worship of Yahwe passed to Israel.121 Moreover, remembering that m Still later, but in quite the same spirit, the Deuteronomist suppressed all reference to both Hobab-Jethro and the oracle and its consultation in his</page><page sequence="134">134 JULIAN MORGENSTERN the original K narrative had told that Zipporah had accompanied Moses down to Egypt, but that at least the majority, if not all,122 of the younger documents had no such record, they inserted vv.2-4 plus ובניו ואשתו of v,5, in order to harmonize the other wise conflicting narratives. But beyond this and one or two minor suppressions and a few characteristic interpolations, which gave the remodeled narrative a literary fullness and roundness, they found it unnecessary to make any insertions or changes whatsoever, except to add at the very close of the story v.27, telling of the departure of Jethro. These editorial interpolations we would set down as follows: vv.lb-4; in 5 everything except [6 ;ויבא אל משה אל הר [יהוה; in 8 everything after ולמצרים until 9 ;ויצילם יהוהb; 1 Oa/3; lib (prob ably); in 12 perhaps 20 ;16 ;אהרןa; in 21 everything after 123;חיל in 25 everything after 27 ;ישראל. This leaves as the original K text of Ex. 18 the following: (1) וישמע !חבב] חתן משה את בל אשר עשה [יהוה) למשה ולישראל עמו (5) ויבא אל משה אל הר ניחוח ! (7) ויצא משה לקראת חתנו וישתחו וישק לו וישאלו איש לרעהו לשלום ויבאו האהלה &lt;8&gt; ויספר משה לחתנו את כל אשר עשה יהוה לפרעה ולמצרים ויצילם יהוה (ואת אשר כרת יהוה ברית נגר ישראל) (9) ויחד [חבב! על כל הטובה אשר| עשה יהוה לישראל (10) ויאמר ברוך יהוה אשר הציל את העם מתחת יד מצרים (11) עתה ידעתי כי גדול יהוה מכל האלהים (12) רקח 1חבב] חתן משה זבח ל ויהוה] ויבא [אהרן ו )כל זקני ישראל לאכל לחם עם חתן משה לפני [יהוד,] (13) ויהי ממחרת וישב משה לשפט את העם ויעמד העם על משה מן הבקר עד הערב (1-1) וירא (חבב) חתן משה את כל אשר הוא עשה לעם ויאמר מה הדבר הזה אשר אתה עשה לעם מדוע אתה יושב לבדך וכל העם נצב עליך מן בקר עד ערב (15) ויאמר משה לחתנו כי יבא אלי העם לדרש ויהוה ] (17) ויאמר חתן משה אליו לא טוב הדבר אשר■ אתהאשר■ אתה עשה (18) נבל תבל גם אתה גם העם אשר עמך כי כבד ממך הדבר לא תוכל עשהו לבדך (19) עתה שמע בקלי איעצך ויהי ויהוה] עמך היה אתה לעם מול 1יהוה ]] והבאת אתה את הדברים אל ניהוה! (20) והודעת להם את הדרך ילכו בה ואת account of the appointment of the judges. Characteristically he made the idea of these judges emanate from Moses instead of from Hobab-Jethro, and repre sented Moses as settling the difficult cases through his own superior wisdom and judgment instead of by submitting them to the oracle (Deut. 1.13-17). "2 Ex. 4.20 is undoubtedly also editorial, designed to pave the way for the insertion of vv.24-26. 125 [וצרך ניהוה of v.23 probably means, "and if Yahwe sanction it."</page><page sequence="135">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 135 המעשה אשר יעשון (21) ואתה החזה מטל העם אנשי חיל (22) ושפטו את העם בטל עת והיה כל הדבר הגדול יביאו אליך וכל הדבר הקטן ישפטו הם והקל מעליך ונשאו אתך (23) אם את הדבר הזה תעשה וצוך mm ז ויכלת עמד ונם כל העם הזה על מקומו יבא בשלום (24) וישסע משה לקול חתנו ויעש כל אשר אמר (25) ויבחר משה אנשי חיל מכל ישראל (26) וישפטו את העם בכל עת את הדבר הקשה יביאון אל משה וכל הדבר הקטן ישפוטו הם. Now in this narrative there is not the slightest indication of the handiwork of any source other than K. It is true that outside of the matters already enumerated there is little to indicate K authorship. Yet these matters are so significant, and this narra tive as we have just reconstructed it is so simple, direct and com plete in every detail, and fits so exactly into the K narrative at just the place we have indicated, that we may regard it as extremely probable that we have here another fragment of the original K document. X FINAL SUMMARY. This completes our study of the literary history of the K document. We have, we believe, established our general thesis that it was a document of considerable magnitude, and that, composed in 899 B.C., in support of the religious reformation of King Asa, it is truly the oldest document of the Hexateuch. In its original and full form it must have told of the birth of Moses in Egypt, of his departure from there when grown to man hood and of his journey out into the desert. There he came into contact with the little Kenite tribe and married the sister of Hobab, the tribal chieftain and oracular priest. After a time, at the bidding of Yahwe, the Kenite tribal god, although without knowing His name, Moses returned to Egypt, accompanied by his wife and his son, who had just been born. On the way, Yahwe attacked the child and sought to kill him; but by quickly circumcising the boy Zipporah saved his life; thus, it seems, the K code accounted for the institution of the rite of circumcision in Israel. The exodus quickly followed Moses' arrival in Egypt. Of the attendant details nothing of the K account, at least so far as we can see at present, has been preserved. But manifestly it must</page><page sequence="136">136 JULIAN MORGENSTERN have been brought about through marvelous deeds on the part of Yahwe, which caused the discomfiture of the Egyptian gods, of a character to warrant the utterance of Hobab, when he hears about them, "Now I know that Yahwe is the most powerful of all the gods." After leaving Egypt the people were led by Moses speedily and directly to the mountain of Yahwe in the desert, upon which the Deity was thought to dwell. There in some way, the nature of which is not clear, but which had apparently to do with the worship of a molten image of some kind, the sanctity of the place was violated by Israel, and in His anger Yahwe commanded Moses to lead the people away from the mountain. Then fol lowed the incident recorded in Ex. 33-34, the details of which we need not repeat here. This culminated in the establishment of a covenant between Yahwe and Israel, through the mediation of Moses, a covenant whereby Israel accepted Yahwe as its sole god, and obligated itself to worship Him alone, on the basis of a little code of ritual laws, now revealed to it. And Yahwe on His side, promised to take Israel as His people, to protect and prosper it and to bring it to a good land, which should become its permanent home. In addition to this Yahwe commanded Moses to fashion a tent after the model of the sacred cave upon the mountain, to be known as the "tent of meeting." There, no matter where it might be, Yahwe would come from His sacred mountain, and meet with Israel, represented by its oracular priest, and there He would reveal His will and His law unto Israel. The entire technique of oracular revelation must with this have been communicated to Moses by Yahwe. Thus through self-revelation, with Moses as the agent thereof, Yahwe, originally the god of the little Kenite tribe, made Himself the God of Israel. And thus Moses became truly, not only the actual deliverer of Israel, or at least of certain tribes of Israel, from Egypt, but also the founder of the worship of Yahwe by Israel and of the institution of oracular law, or Torah, in Israel. Almost coincident with the erection of the "tent of meeting" and the institution of the system of oracular law and judgment by Moses alone, his brother-in-law Hobab came with his tribe to visit him. Moses recounted to Hobab all that Yahwe had done</page><page sequence="137">THE OLDEST DOCUMENT OF THE HEXATEUCH 137 for Israel, and Hobab, the old and ardent devotee of Yahwe, rejoiced to hear the wondrous tale. A covenant meal was eaten by Hobab and the elders of the tribes of Israel in the presence of Yahwe, and thereby a covenant relationship was established between the Kenites and Israel. The next day Hobab saw Moses sitting the entire day to judge the people. He warned him that this was an unwise procedure, and advised him to appoint capable assistants, who might adjudicate the ordinary cases, for which precedent had already been established in previous oracular reve lation. Moses himself should handle only those cases for which there was no such precedent ; and he should do so by laying each such case before Yahwe for decision, in accordance with the prin ciples of oracular technique, already revealed to him. Moses followed this wise counsel; thus Israel's judicial system was inaugurated. Thereupon Moses turned to Hobab, the priest, the old "face of Yahwe," and requested him, together with his tribe, to accom pany Israel and guide it on its journey through the desert, until it should come at last to the good land which Yahwe had promised to give it. At first Hobab refused; but eventually he was per suaded. Israel and the Kenites journeyed on together and at last forced their way into Canaan from the south. And there the tribes settled down permanently. Yahwe's promise had been completely fulfilled, at least in its first part. Israel was now eternally obligated to the true and pure worship of Yahwe, and of Yahwe alone. And it was indeed a simple worship, summed up in a few fundamental laws, and observed through but a few ritual institutions, notably the "tent of meeting" and an oracular priest. Such must have been the content and the implications of the original K document. Unquestionably it was excellently adapted to the purpose of religious reformation and restoration of the old, traditional, simple worship of Yahwe, which it was intended by its prophetic authors to serve. Only a few fragments of this original K document, so far as we can see, survive in the present Hexateuch, The remainder has been suppressed by later writers, particularly by the J2 editors who eventually, probably in the seventh century B.C. or even later, incorporated these fragments of the K document into</page><page sequence="138">138 JULIAN MORGENSTERN the J code. Obviously, however, much of the content of the nar rative of both the J and E codes has been borrowed, though with considerable amplification, from the older K narrative.. For this reason the suppression of the larger part of the original K docu ment by these later writers and editors was both easy and natural. It is by no means improbable that here and there, just as in the narrative of Ex. 18, they may have borrowed literally, and that some small, scattered portions of the Hexateuch, now assigned to J or E, may actually be assigned with greater propriety to K. Only future investigation can determine this. But significant as all this is, of far greater moment is the light which this document, thus isolated, sheds upon the history of Israel in its earliest period, upon the exodus from Egypt and the determination of the particular tribes which participated in that event, upon the life and work of Moses, and above all else upon the earliest conception of Yahwe and manner of His worship in Israel. But before we may proceed to the consideration of these questions, we must first undertake the analysis of the Book of the Covenant and determine its literary history in a manner similar to that of our present study of the K document; for we have already established its close historical connection with K; and, as we shall see in time, as a historical document also its significance is closely linked with that of K. We shall therefore, in the next stage of this study, and in a subsequent volume of this ANNUAL, make an investigation of the literary history of the Book of the Covenant. This will be followed in turn by a detailed considéra tion of the full significance of these two ancient documents for the early history of Israel.</page></plain_text>
