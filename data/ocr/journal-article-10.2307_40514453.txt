By tipping his view camera perfectly parallel to the ground, Siskind transformed the sand into an abstract picture plane, against which the sea- weed appears as lyrical calligraphy. In Gloucester the following summer he repeated this compositional technique to make a series of abstract still lifes; for his subjects he took weathered fragments of wood, stray bits of rope, an abandoned glove (Fig. 2).1 These photographs have been heralded as a water- shed in Siskind s career, marking his transi- tion from a representational documentary style to an abstract mode that has been widely identified with the form and spirit of abstract expressionist painting as it developed in the 1940s. Siskind s abandonment of the socially-conscious subject matter of his earlier work has been cast as disillusionment with the idea of art as a social weapon, implying that he turned away from his long-standing commitment to radical politics and social change.2 In this essay, I will argue conversely that Siskind s shift in subject matter and pic- torial style in fact enabled him to engage in cultural criticism still more profoundly. In departing from a mode where the agenda of social reform served as the obvious referent of his imagery, he moved on to a more challeng- Fig. 1 Aaron Siskind, M. V. io&gt; 1947.

Menschel. 1977.190.2 ing style that allowed him to address the fun- damental asymmetries of gender, race, and class in a more elemental way. Siskind's com- plex treatment of these themes in his abstract work can be seen as a continuation and expansion of his documentary practice. My 49</page><page sequence="3">goal is to bring his attention to these social issues more clearly into focus by examining the inscription of sexuality, ethnicity, and social class along two axes, looking vertically within individual photographs, and horizon- tally across Siskind s work as a whole. Both singly and collectively, the photographs reveal the complex interdependence of these cul- tural mechanisms. For example, images that at first glance open one s eyes to racial imbal- ances frequently reveal gender and class in- equalities when one takes a second look. While each of these categories is predicated upon a fixed social hierarchy, they are not simply analogous. As Siskind's photographs demonstrate, the forces of sexuality, ethnicity, and social class converge in such a way that each actively transforms the others. His pic- tures simultaneously reflect and participate in this process of transformation. In seeking to understand the complexity of Siskind's work, it is important to underscore Frederic Jameson s assertion that all art must be taken as a socially symbolic act and insti- tution, and that form should be understood not as narrowly formalist, but as historical and dialectical.3 According to his analysis of the interwoven cultural logic of the art world and the socio-political economy, the advent of high modernism comes hand-in-glove with the pervasive reification of life in gen- eral, as disenchantment and commodification penetrate every corner of our existence. Siskind's modernism must be seen not only as an expression of this reification, but also as a reaction to it- an attempt through sheer style to hold out against this alienation. We can begin to appreciate the richness and potency of both his documentary and his abstract styles by examining the photographs as a site where cultural meaning can best be decoded through the use of several different interpretive strategies. By analyzing these images dialectically, I hope to arrive at read- ings where such diverse methods as formal analysis, social history, feminism, Marxism, and psychoanalysis can be mutually illumi- nating. In so doing, I necessarily move beyond the conscious intent of the artist and rely on theoretical practices that have been developed more recently than the photo- graphs themselves. Recognizing that this is a risky and controversial endeavor, I hasten to emphasize that explications offered here are rooted in close analytical readings of the pic- tures themselves, and that my purpose in casting such a wide interpretive net is to give Siskind's work the full attention it richly deserves.4 Commenting on the abstract still lifes of 1944, Siskind himself underscored the method- ological connections between these pictures and his previous work. Describing them as "an out- growth of my documentary practice," he out- lined his meticulous sociological procedure: There is first the examination of the idea of the project. Then the visits to the scene, the casual conversations, and more formal interviews- talking, and listening, and looking. You read what s been written, and dig out facts and figures for your own writing. Follows the discus- sion to arrive at a point of view and its crystal- lization into a statement of aim. And finally, the pictures themselves, each one planned, talked, taken, and examined in terms of the whole.5 Siskind further noted that this had been his method in making Harlem Document (1937- 40), the most ambitious and impressive proj- ect he had undertaken as a member of the Feature Group of the Photo League.6 Associ- ation in the 1930s with the Photo League, an artists' group with ties to the Communist Party, represented a renewed interest in left- wing political activism for Siskind, who had been a member of the Junior Young People's Socialist League as a teenager. Through his involvement with the Photo League, the importance of the union of social and aes- thetic themes crystallized in Siskind's mind and work. The images from these years address key issues that resurface, in varied and subtle ways, in his later abstract work.

The photograph encap- sulates prevailing gender roles and racial stereotypes in such a way that each reinforces the other. The man s massive frame com- pletely envelops the woman's slight form as he performs a high-kicking step; he clearly leads, on the dance floor and in life. His wide-open eyes and mouth signal his visual and oral command of the scene, while the woman's largely obscured face reveals only a gleeful smile. Although the man is in obvious command, both dancers are subtly but distinctly disem- powered in relation to the dominant estab- lishment, figured indirectly by the aggressive presence of a white photographer in a Harlem club. Highlighting sensory gratifica- tion-sight and taste- rather than intelli- gence, the facial expressions of both figures fall within a prolific tradition of Stereotypie caricatures of blacks, dating back to the Civil War.7 The man's bulging eyts and gaping mouth recall the legion of images of poor Southern blacks feasting on watermelon, which circulated widely as postcards and car- toons in popular literature in the late nine- teenth and early twentieth centuries. By cap- turing both faces at an angle that accentuates their broad, flat noses and full lips, Siskind calls attention to precisely those features that had long been cast as evidence of black racial inferiority.8 The gendered division of power within the photograph is subtly reinforced by the danc- ers' clothing. The generously proportioned, even-toned suit covering most of the man's body insures that we read his form as a uni- fied whole. His bland, but proper, business- like attire signals his relative prosperity and conformation to established norms. The woman's garb, while on the one hand equally proper and up-to-date, on the other contri- butes to an appearance of fragmentation and vulnerability. Her form is visually cut in two not only by her partner's aggressively phallic, outstretched kick, but by her contrasting skirt and sweater. Short sleeves and slit skirt provide seductive glimpses of skin, while a tight fit emphasizes the shape of her body. Such fragmentation, in which discrete parts of the woman's body appear as individ- ual static icons, relates directly to her appeal as the object of an eroticized, pleasure-filled gaze.9 The bit of leg exposed above her dark stocking is particularly revealing, literally and metaphorically. As Abigail Solomon-Godeau has written, the erotic symbolism of stockings played an important role in nineteenth-cen- tury commercial photographs of dancers, actresses, and demi-mondaines, whose tights sculpted their fleshy legs into aestheticized objects of desire.10 Glimpses of the leg itself were permitted only in the context of the nude, or in the highly erotic gesture of removing or putting on stockings. By captur- ing the precise moment when the intersec- tion of stocking and leg is pointedly exposed, Siskind locates his subject within this icono- graphie tradition of eroticized nudes. But by showing this combination of skin and hose in the context of recreational dancing, he pro- vocatively extends the convention beyond the arena of professional entertainers, into the everyday lives of an American couple. In formal terms, the triangular area of exposed leg echoes the angle drawn by the intersection of the couple's raised arms. If we read these linked arms as an emblem of their union and her exposed leg as a symbol of the woman's status as a fetish object, then the visual rhyme can be read as a clue to the cen- trality of this form of fetishism within the dynamics of their relationship. The woman's eye-catching, white shoes play an important role in this regard. As Freud pointed out in his seminal essay on fetishism, the foot and shoe are frequently preferred fetish objects, owing "to the circumstance that the inquisi- tive boy peered at the woman's genitals from below" when he first discovered her lack of a penis.11 In a chance encounter of the real, the symbolic, and the formal- characteristic of the most compelling photographs - these prominent shoes draw attention to the 52</page><page sequence="6">Fig- 4 Aaron Siskind, Untitled - Harlem Document, ca. 1937-39.

While the eroticized objectification of the woman in Savoy Dancers is subtly embedded in the narrative of the pair s swing moves, other photographs of Harlem night life pre- sent the issue directly. In one series of pic- tures, Siskind traces the steps of an erotic dancer as she unveils her nude form beneath a gauzy white wrap (Fig. 4). Her body is fetishized not only as a treat for the male viewer, but also as a literal commodity: danc- ing naked is what she does to earn a living, and customers pay to see her do it. Signifi- cantly, Siskind's photograph provides telling glimpses not only of the dancer s body, but of her fellow performers and audience as well. All of the band members and dancers are black, but the spectators seated at the best table are white. While some night spots, like the Savoy Ballroom, admitted people of all races and social classes, many of the most famous and opulent clubs featured black entertainers for white eyes only.12 In this par- ticular group of photographs, the asymme- tries of gender and race converge upon the figure of the naked dancer. Hinting at a pos- sible mulatto heritage, her light brown skin literally casts her between the races. This mixed racial identity enabled her to serve more easily as an object of desire for both blacks and whites, increasing her employabil- ity on the Harlem club scene.13 In hindsight, however, we are also reminded of the colonial narrative of domination, which typically lurks beneath miscegenation. Siskind pictured the private side of this intersection of racism and sexism in an image from The Most Crowded Block in the World of 1940-41 (Fig. 5), a series which grew out of Harlem Document. The young black man stretched out, fully clothed, on top of a bed may be taking a brief nap or sleeping during the day after working a night shift. While we are left to speculate on the circumstances of his waking life, the photograph makes aggres- sive hints about the girl of his dreams. On 53</page><page sequence="7">the wall surrounding his dresser mirror is his personal gallery of movie stars and entertain- ers, composed of mass-produced images clipped from popular fan magazines. Most of the pictures feature glamorous white pin-up girls, fruit forbidden him by boundaries of race and class. Like the naked dancer, the women in these photographs have been provocatively cast as fetishized commodities, here styled to appeal to the male viewer with the barely concealed aim of enticing him to buy movie tickets. After he is lured inside the darkened theater, his erotic fantasies will be further nourished by the stars on the screen, seducing him to repeat the pattern of looking and consuming. This cycle is, of course, one of ultimate frustration, of sexual gratification perpetually deferred and denied in the service of capitalism. The paradoxical situation figured here is, on the one hand, symptomatic of the struc- tural contradictions inherent in the capitalist mode of production, where the use value and exchange value of commodities are unevenly balanced. Compounding these socioeconom- ic contradictions is an equally potent set of psychosexual paradoxes. The man in the pic- ture is symbolically "feminized" in important ways, as Siskind manipulates several visual conventions that have traditionally been lim- ited to eroticized representations of women.14 The man s passive position on the bed leaves him defenseless against the camera s aggres- sive gaze, occluded from both sexual and social power. In this way, the photograph emphasizes the impossibility of desire itself. In Jacques Lacan s formulation, "mans desire" is never his to own or control, but is always "the desire of the Other," imposed upon him from outside.15 While the desires of the man on the bed are hopelessly unquenchable, he fares still worse when Fig- 5 Aaron Siskind, Unfitted - The Most Crowded Block in the World, ca. 1940-41.

Extending the sexual dimension of pho- tography beyond the frame of a single image, Jane Gallop- a writer highly influenced by Lacan- locates the erotic charge not within the picture, but rather in the encounter between the picture and the viewer. In sketching out this "erotics of engagement,"17 Gallop draws a provocative analogy between the paradox of sexuality and that of photog- raphy in general: In sex the subject must desire, must fantasize y must imagine. Things must come from the mind and cause one to view the other as the object of desire. Yet, at the same time, there is also a wish to encounter the other as something real, out there, beyond ones fantasies.... Photography is art like sex is fantasy, desire, imagination. It is ones own ideas projected onto the world, shaping and distorting the world, framing the world and making it into an object of art or an object of desire. Photogra- phy is also something else. Besides being art, it seems to have some quite special relation to the real.18 Acknowledging photography's "special rela- tion to the real"- the seeming transparency that throughout its history has remained its most potent rhetorical device- Gallop nevertheless privileges the contrary role of desire in the creation of photographic mean- ing. Pointing to the equally paradoxical rela- tionship between projection and reality in sexual encounters, she hones our ability to see through the romantic mystifications com- monly ascribed to sexuality and photography. The romantic appeal of photography stems precisely from its ready disguise as an uncon- structed transcription of reality, making it seem as real and immediate as a sexual partner. In Siskind s photographs of Harlem, any notion of romance is purposefully given a back seat in favor of sociological discourse. Their razor sharp focus acts as a potent metaphorical device, underscoring their pre- cision as scientific description. These images can readily be seen as a reform-minded exposé of the manifold inequalities of race, sex, and class in operation in the neighbor- hood and the culture at large. But these clas- sic examples of the documentary mode also bear a more disturbing edge. Although the photographs discussed thus far are images of sympathetic commentary, they are equally instruments of surveillance and social con- trol. As John Tagg has argued, the rhetoric of documentary loses its progressive cachet when it is located within an extensive histori- cal tradition of observation and domination, dating from the mid-nineteenth century.19 The broad genealogy of Siskind s elegantly composed images of Harlem life can be traced to photographs of colonized peoples, criminals, psychiatric patients, and workers' housing- representations authorized and archived by the state to catalogue and often indict people on the margins of society, with the larger purpose of insuring the hegemony of the dominant class. Significantly, the documentary tradition includes precious few images of wealth and privilege. Since the usage of the term began in photographic practice and criticism in 1926, it has been em- ployed almost exclusively to refer to photo- graphs of people who are, in one way or another, on the down-and-out.20 Nearly all of Siskind's photographs, abstract as well as representational, fall squarely within this tra- dition, posing few challenges to the class- bound conventions of the documentary mode. While Siskind was probably unaware of the tainted ancestry of his documentary work, he was much more likely to have been conscious of decisive shifts within the prac- tice of documentary photography in the years following his final Photo League projects. From 1935 until 1943, the Historical Section- Photographic of the New Deals Resettlement Administration- renamed the Farm Security Administration (fsa) in 1937 - had served as 55</page><page sequence="9">the public standardbearer of documentary photography. Transforming images of the pri- vate strife of impoverished farmers into a lib- eral badge of public benevolence, it served the fsa's political agenda of relief and reform, despite the severe circumscription of the agency's material effectiveness by the larger paternal and corporatist motives of Roose- velt s program.21 The Photographic Section s less celebrated role as an instrument not of altruistic relief, but of governmental observa- tion and social control, was exposed in 1943, when it was transferred to the Office of War Information; its high-profile director, Roy Stryker, soon resigned in favor of a position with the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey. As the fsa lost its sovereignty as the arbiter of documentary style, the vacuum was rapidly filled by the photography department at the Museum of Modern Art, led first by Beaumont Newhall and, after World War II, by Edward Steichen. The aesthetic and polit- ical agendas promoted by Newhall and Stei- chen pointed in opposite directions, the former championing the cause of photogra- phy as a fine art, the latter emphasizing pho- tography's role as illustration and echoing the corporate values disseminated by popular glossy magazines such as Life and Look. The 1940s and 1950s also witnessed the rise of television, which eventually displaced pho- tography from its central position within mass culture. Such a constellation of forces conjoined to brand social documentary pho- tography a bankrupt genre: the form survived largely as an institutionalized artifact rather than a vigorous creative and political state- ment.22 This development was paralleled and reinforced by a contemporary shift in the interests of many American painters. In the late 1920s and throughout most of the 1930s, progressive developments in art and politics had been interlaced, as many leading painters dedicated their work to the expression of social protest. But by the end of the thirties, socially-conscious painting also seemed to go stale, leaving the gate open for the ascen- dance of abstract expressionism.23 In this context, it comes as no surprise that in 1943 Siskind would seek a new mode of photographic expression that would permit him to "see the world clean and fresh and alive."24 Siskind s interest in creating abstract pictures was also fueled by his ongoing con- tact with the New York art world and his friendship with several abstract expressionist painters, including Barnett Newman, Adolph Gottleib, and Mark Rothko. The photogra- pher's social and professional interaction with these painters, frequently mentioned in the literature, has been ably documented by Carl Chiarenza.25 But it must be stressed that the influence is likely to have operated in both directions, and that the formal parallels of Siskind's work with abstract expressionism address only a part of his artistic project. The dynamic, incestuous interplay among the forces of sexuality, ethnicity, and social class, which Siskind had invoked so elo- quently in Harlem Document and The Most Crowded Block in the World, is inscribed with equal force in his abstract work. The tremen- dous complexity of these relationships, as well as the subtlety of their encoding, can be revealed by examining their convergence upon one particularly resonant photograph, New York (South Street) ', 1947 (Fig. 6). As Chiarenza has noted, the formal interaction between the two abstract shapes in this work recalls Siskind's earlier documentary photo- graphs, where the communication between people is revealed through gesture and body language.26 Siskind himself obliquely acknowledged the pivotal role of communi- cation in this picture when he referred to its theme as a "conversation."27 But the "con- versational" aspect oí New York (South Street) extends far beyond its anthropomorphic resemblance to two talking figures. The shapes themselves are literally made from lan- guage, composed of torn scraps of a printed broadside, in which parts of individual words and phrases are clearly visible and decipher- able. The easy legibility of these typographi- cal elements at first seems to mitigate the inherent difficulty of making sense of the pic- 56</page><page sequence="10">ture s overall iconography. But our efforts to decode the image are ultimately foiled by the fragmentary condition of the poster and by the fact that its message was printed in several languages. Posted in a poor neighborhood, the broad- side was printed in Spanish and Italian as well as English so that it could be read by newly arrived immigrants. What remains of the printed message reveals that it included emergency medical instructions: "in case of accident... induce vomiting." While this information may at first seem neutral, it can also be read as a subtle form of class hege- mony.28 The threat of physical harm clearly implies that the neighborhood is in some way dangerous and vulnerable to chemical con- tamination, and as a result is likely to be inhabited by poor and working-class people. Furthermore, the authoritative tone of the instructions reinforces the prevailing struc- ture of the social order: the South Street locals are clearly intended to follow rules pre- scribed by the members of the dominant class. By establishing this pattern of behavior in the case of basic health matters, the ruling class insures that its word is likely to be taken as truth on other issues as well.

Gramsci was keenly aware that "every language contains the elements of a conception of the world," and realized that the prevailing vocabulary discourages the formulation of social alterna- tives, making it difficult for the dispossessed to remedy, or even fully recognize, their predicament.29 In light of Lacan s psychoanalytic theory, which accords a privileged position to the role of language in human development and sexuality, one can also interpret the image s text as a reflection of the language of a specifically patriarchal society. In brief, Lacan recasts Freud's Oedipal model to make the acquisition of language the decisive factor in the development of the child's sexual identity. This development is precipitated by the arrival of the Father, symbolizing social power, who splits the imaginary dyad of mother and child. The child learns to speak in order to articulate this painful loss of the Oedipal mother- the price he or she must pay for the ability to communicate and func- tion in society. At this moment, the child enters what Lacan calls the "Symbolic Order," wherein the system of language serves as a signifier for the metaphorical "Law-of-the-Father." Lacan distinguishes this order from the Imaginary, the preverbal regis- ter defined in essentially visual terms, and from the Real, a realm hovering precariously between the other two. Adapting Freud's concept of the castration complex, Lacan rewrites the presence or absence of the penis as possession of the Phallus (written with a distinctive capital "P"). Those individuals with power, those whose words are taken as truth, are said to have the Phallus because they determine reality; although its posses- sion is not anatomically determined, in a patriarchal society it is men who have it, or at least think they do. Lacan's notion of the Symbolic Order hence mediates between the categories of lan- guage and sexuality, providing a transcoding mechanism which allows us to consider both as part of the same structural fabric.30 The pivotal role of language in New York (South Street) can thereby be interpreted as a key not only to the class and gender issues embedded in the photograph, but also to the intersec- tion of the two. The hegemonic assertion of power on the part of the dominant class perpetuates a model of authority where men are clearly in command, in both theory and practice. The political implications of Lacan's theory of language extend logically from the analytic situation itself, where speech is the medium of treatment and cure.31 By fore- grounding the reciprocal relationship between patient and analyst - speaker and listener- the analytic situation heightens our awareness of the two-sided nature of any spoken act. This dimension of verbal interac- tion has been studied extensively by the Rus- sian linguist V. N. Volosinov, whose 1929 description of the word as a "territory shared by both addressor and addressee, speaker and interlocutor" seems to anticipate Lacan's later formulation.32 Volosinov's territorial concep- tion explicitly politicizes the psychoanalytic use of language, prompting one to question the boundaries of this territory, how it is gov- erned, and who legislates meaning within its borders.33 These are precisely the issues that Siskind eloquently addresses, in both form and content, in New York (South Street). In making the photograph, Siskind per- formed a double quotation, directly recapitu- lating the printed words still visible on the broadside, while at the same time recording its subsequent deterioration and destruction. His gesture can be fruitfully analyzed as an example of what Volosinov terms "reported speech."34 In explaining the active relation between an original speech and its subse- quent reporting by another voice, Volosinov underscores the importance of studying the impact of the broader social milieu on any 58</page><page sequence="12">given verbal or written communication. A reported message can never be preserved intact, but is necessarily transformed by the personal style of the second speaker and the larger context in which the utterance is made. The transposition of Volosinovs literary terms to the analysis of visual expression seems all the more appropriate when one recalls that the Russian linguist himself bor- rowed Heinrich Wölfflin s categories for styles of painting. Volosinov describes the linear style of reported speech as concise and clear-cut, minimizing the inflection of the author. The pictorial style, on the other hand, blurs the boundaries between the reported text and the author s voice, deftly carving out a space for commentary.35 In New York (South Street), Siskind incorporates both styles, using the latter as a trenchant comment on the former. The crisp block let- tering of the poster serves as an emblem of linear precision, while its ragged edges sym- bolize the indistinct line between the violence of its destruction and the allegorical content of Siskind s image. Taking advantage of the transcoding possibilities inherent to indirect speech, the photographer appropriates the ravages of decay and vandalism to register his own protest against the repressive comment of the original message. New York (South Street) functions as a shared enterprise, dependent on the work of the original cre- ator, the subsequent strokes of vandalism, wind, and rain, and the effort of the photog- rapher. Siskind unites these diverse gestures into a collective endeavor, recalling the col- laborative approach to photography stressed by the Feature Group of the Photo League in producing Harlem Documentarla other proj- ects. Interpreted as an allegory for collective life, the ultimate visual unity serves as a note of political hope within an otherwise bleak landscape. Siskind continued to explore the relation- ship between language, sexuality, and ethni- city in Chicago 59 (Fig. 7), one of a series of photographs made in the 1950s focusing on the storefront of a Chicago shoemaker.36 The Fig- 7 Aaron Siskind, Chicago 59, 1952.

Menschel. 1977.190.39 facade was covered with a dense pattern of painted words and phrases, interspersed with a few bold graphics. Written in both English and Lithuanian, these abbreviated messages signal the ethnic background of the shoe- maker, his clients, and the neighborhood. The picture offers a full menu of sensual delights: "home-cooking" promises to satisfy the palate and "getar muick" to please the ear, while the overall design of lettering and graphics captivates the eye. The sense of touch is indirectly figured in through the sug- gestive allusion to a female torso made by the stylized outline of the guitar, which encloses a written reference to a wedding.37 As sug- gested by a second reference to "honey-sveet- 59</page><page sequence="13">hert," the pleasures advertised here combine to preserve prevailing gendercodes: male desire is the referent for both the "home- cooking" and for the aural and sexual gratifi- cations promised by the gui tar-and- torso. At the same time that it confirms the cross- cultural dominance of a patriarchal order, however, the shoemaker s display exposes an underlying ethnic hierarchy whose exclusivity supersedes even male empowerment. The juxtaposition of English and Lithuanian words, linguistically dissonant, yet visually pleasing, casts the shoemaker as an outsider in American culture. Disorderly and discon- tinuous-replete with glaring misspellings and backward lettering- they signal as well the shoemaker s incomplete assimilation into the social realm figured by Lacan s Symbolic Order. Like the black residents of Harlem and the Spanish- or Italian-speaking South Street locals, he occupies a position within society that is distinctly other, one to be brought under surveillance and domination by the ruling class. In this regard, the letters painted back- ward, as if viewed in a mirror, are vital not only to the overall decorative quality of the facade, but to the political symbolism of the image as well. In psychoanalytic terms, these bits of type can be related to what Lacan has termed the "mirror stage" in human develop- ment. The mirror image represents the moment when the child is first introduced to an order outside itself, to which it will from then on refer, eventually through the Sym- bolic Order of language.38 The very sense of having experienced a decentered, fragmented body prior to the mirror stage is only formed retroactively from that moment; it therefore serves as a jumping-off point both for devel- opments to come and for the formation of the subject's own history.39 Victor Bürgin has argued that the mirror stage relates to the photography project in general in two key ways: first, because of the correlation between the formation of the identity and the forma- tion of imageSy and second, because the child s recognition of itself in the mirror is in fact a misrecognition.40 When one deciphers the representational content of a photograph to make sense of the image, one engages in the same sort of imaginary command of the situation, denying the rule of the frame and the ultimate authority of the camera and its controlling gaze.41 The seeming transparency of the medium in this way serves a potent ideological function, mystifying the viewer s understanding of the larger cultural forces that shape his or her life. Contributing to the decorative coherence of the facade, the reversed type in Chicago 59 serves as a figure for the visual unity per- ceived by the young child. Together with the Lithuanian fragments, it also allegorizes the inevitable fragmentation and alienation of the individual subject, while simultaneously signaling a broader set of political implica- tions. The Lithuanian words stand as rem- nants of a vanquished culture, vestiges of an ethnic identity in the process of being assimi- lated into mainstream American society. Like the mirrored fragments, they point backward to an earlier time, but also stand as building blocks for the future. Finally, the critical dimension of Chicago $9 can be further unveiled if we examine the image as a site where modernism and mass culture intersect. As Thomas Crow has con- vincingly demonstrated, modern art has been crucially dependent upon mass cultural forms throughout its history.42 Siskind s adoption of the amateurly-painted storefront as a sub- ject for his art stands squarely in this tradi- tion. Like the scraps of newsprint and frag- ments of headlines that figure prominently in many cubist collages, however, the vernacular forms in Chicago $9 retain their status as bits of commercial culture despite their aesthetic colonization by high art. According to Crow, modern art is able to function as cultural criticism not by transcending the culture of commodity embodied in popular forms, but by exploiting their inherent contradictions to a critical purpose.43 This is precisely what hap- pens in Siskind s photograph. By structuring its contradictions specifically around the 60</page><page sequence="14">Fig. 8 Aaron Siskind, Chicago 30, 1949 (from the j$th Anniversary Portfolio, 1979).

The intersection of sexual references, mass cultural forms, and language in Siskind s photographs was not lost on contemporary critics in the 1950s. This confluence can be readily seen in one of his most celebrated and often reproduced pictures, Chicago 30, 1949 (Fig. 8). When five critics were asked to re- spond to this image in a 1957 issue of Aperture, four linked it to virility: to Henry Holmes Smith it suggested a "headless rooster" and to Myron Martin [Minor White] "a medical diagram of male genitals," while both Walter Chappell and Sam Tung Wu [also Minor White] wrote of the picture in terms of fertilization.44 Three of the critics read the image as a fragmented "R" on its side, which two of them linked to the con- ventional repertoire of the sign painter. Chiarenza has since pointed to the "R" as a subtle reference to "Aaron," and has read the preponderance of the letters "A" and "R" in Siskind s iconography as an autobiographical gesture.45 By referring to the phonetic struc- ture of his own name within the context of a sexually-charged image, Siskind s photograph effectively conveys the centrality of language in the formation of the ego and the establish- ment of one's own sexual identity. Sexuality is located quite literally within language in another ravaged signboard Siskind photographed in the early 1950s, North Carolina 30, 1951 (Fig. 9). A central sec- tion of the most recent advertisement has been gouged out to reveal a suggestive frag- ment from the sign beneath it: a stolen glimpse of a highly eroticized pair of female legs hanging over the edge of a bed.46 This bedroom scene appears literally caught between the boldly lettered words "in" and "and," which in this context read as witty euphemisms for penetration and sexual union. The important distinction between the two words (and their sexual connota- tions) is emphasized by their physical separa- tion. The two are literally torn apart by the provocative bed scene; the picture once beneath them now comes between them. On one level, the message seems to be that there is more to sex than the penetrative "in." The more inclusive intimacy suggested by "and" can be interpreted in terms of Lacan s defini- tion of feminine sexuality as "the effort of a jouissance wrapped in its own contiguity."47 Suggesting an alternative gratification based on allover closeness and touching rather than intercourse, the notion of contiguity relates quite specifically to the female body, where 61</page><page sequence="15">Fig. 9 Aaron Siskind, North Carolina 30, 1951. Gelatin silver print, 35.5 x 32.4 cm. Courtesy of Aaron Siskind. erogenous zones are more dispersed and mul- tiple than in the male. In Siskind s photo- graph, the erotic appeal of touch is figured quite literally by the seductively tactile qual- ity of the print itself, which seems to invite the viewer to reach in and peel back more of the flaking poster. Sexual pleasure based on contiguity is not predicated on heterosexual coupling, but can just as easily be sparked between two women or between mother and child. In Lacan s for- mulation, feminine eroticism is aligned figu- rally as well as literally with a pre-Oedipal experience of sexuality, tied to the metaphori- cal closeness of mother and child. On the one hand this characterization participates in the exclusion of women from language and pow- er within the Symbolic Order. But on the other, it does posit an awareness of an alter- native sexual order, driven by feminine as well as masculine desire, wherein a return to pre-Oedipal silence symbolizes a way to evade, however momentarily, the linguistic structures of male-dominated culture. In the words of feminist theoretician Luce Irigaray, at times "the best plan is to abstain from 62</page><page sequence="16">all discourse, to keep quiet, or else utter only a sound so inarticulate that it barely forms a song"48 In North Carolina 50, the superior scale and stable, uppermost position of the "in" vehemently remind us that those who penetrate remain on top in contemporary so- ciety. But the smaller letters of "and" have survived with fewer rips and tears; rising en- ergetically on a diagonal, they seem to make a lively bid to gain equal billing for feminine sexuality. The representation of torn posters and graffiti continues as a major theme in Sis- kind s work of the 1960s and 1970s. During a trip to Mexico in 19 61, he exposed approxi- mately one hundred negatives of walls plas- tered with multiple layers of torn, weathered broadsides.49 Images such as San Luis Potosi, Mexico 16, 1961 (Fig. 10) feature collaged frag- ments of type and torn paper, repeating the now familiar dialogues between representa- tion and abstraction, legibility and illegibility, politics and aesthetics. While exploring the area of San Luis Potosi, Siskind found a wall covered with bold, random brushstrokes, which reminded him of the paintings of his good friend Franz Kline.50 This experience provided the germ for the extensive series of photographic homages to Kline that Siskind made in Mexico, Rome, Boston, and Peru between 1972 and 1975. Most of these images also include elements from Siskind s own favorite themes (the letters "A" and "R," the conversation, and the torn poster, for exam- ple) indicating that the series is truly as much about the photographer as it is about the painter.51 This juxtaposition of themes from his own work with motifs from abstract expressionist painting can also be read as a conscious comment on the place of photogra- phy within the fine arts. By incorporating his own signature motifs along with those of Kline, Siskind creates a clever equation between the two, quietly insisting that pho- tography be accorded equal standing within the artistic hierarchy. Siskind s homages to Kline also make oblique reference to the fact that certain of his own photographs from 1943-45 had predicted formal motifs that Kline would adopt in 1949- 50. 52 The subtle tension between painting and photography within the high-art context of 63 Fig. 10 Aaron Siskind, San Luis Potosi, Mexico 16, 1961.

Menschel. 1977.190.18 San Luis Potosi, Mexico 16 úso acts as a metaphor for the struggle between social classes, which literally created the content of the picture. Siskind himself has acknowl- edged that his homages to Kline are more raw and violent than the paintings that inspired them.53 Describing Siskind s works as records of an endless cycle of protest and repression, photography critic Ben Lifson has written that "the layers of previous lettering under- neath the white painted walls, are not just underpainting and collaged detail but past and present stages of a long battle between individual expression and the repressive state."54 The conversations in these pho- tographs are not between forms in space as much as between strokes in time, as the ges- ture of one class answers that of another by defacing the other s messages upon the wall. Siskind s fondness for the incomplete- for peeling surfaces, torn posters, and rundown facades - extends significantly to his repre- sentations of the human body. In occasional photographs of friends and models made during the 1960s and 1970s, Siskind frames their bodies as incomplete fragments that tellingly underscore traditional gender roles. Despite the extreme amputation in Bill Lip- kind 10 (Fig. 11), a i960 portrait of a life-long friend, Lipkind projects masculine virility. Resembling massive tree trunks, his hairy legs look strong and robust, in command of the landscape stretching out before them. Lip- kind s powerful legs recall those of the male dancer in Savoy Dancers, whose vigorous kick visually established his control over his part- ner. Siskind s images of the female body from these years also recapitulate the gender code established in Harlem Document. In the summer of 1974, at Marthas Vineyard, he took a series of photographs of a model posing naked in the woods. The fragmenta- tion of her body in Louise 30 (Fig. 12) - only a single breast is not in shadow - points to the same sort of fetishism that defined the role of the female partner in Savoy Dancers. 64</page><page sequence="18">Fig. 12 Aaron Siskind, Louise 30, 1974 (from the 75th Anniversary Portfolio, 1979).

Christopher Luce, b.a. 1972. 1986.143.11 Significantly, Siskind identified the photo- graph of his male friend by his full name, but referred to the female model by her first name alone, a signal both of her lesser status and of the male photographers aggressive intimacy with a woman he knows only pro- fessionally. During two extended trips to Rome in 1963 and 1967, Siskind continued to photo- graph fragmented bodies by training his lens on the ancient sculpture surviving along the Appia Antica, in museums, and on the Arch of Constantine. He was particularly drawn to statues marred by blighted surfaces and miss- ing heads, limbs, or other vital parts. When he did come across a sculptural body remain- ing largely intact on the Arch of Constantine, Siskind severed it with his camera, including only a fragment of the figure within the pic- ture (Fig. 13). His earlier portrait of Lipkind serves as a striking compositional precedent for this photograph of the isolated leg from the Arch of Constantine, while the ominous blacks of the pictures of Roman ruins more generally predict the somber key of Louise 50. These formal parallels reinforce the larger thematic connection between the two sets of images as depictions of the body in pieces, dismembered either by the ravages of time or the cutting frame of the camera. In this con- text, the figures represented in Bill Lipkind 10 and Louise 30 can be seen, along with the female partner in Savoy Dancers, as meta- phorical ruins. Buried beneath the surface of Siskind s persistent depictions of ruins, be they ancient or contemporary, one can discover the ori- gins of the fundamental social and political themes which appear throughout Siskind s photographs. While these themes are encoded into the images at a number of interpretive levels, in the broadest sense they constitute the allegorical dimension of his work as a whole. This allegorical function, in turn, finds its primary emblem in the ruin. According to Walter Benjamin, "allegories 65</page><page sequence="19">Fig. 13 Aaron Siskind, Rome: Arch of Constantine 10, 1963 (from the j$th Anniversary Portfolio, 1979). Gelatin silver print, 50.3 x 40.6 cm. Yale University Art Gallery. Gift of H. Christopher Luce, b.a. 1972. 1986.143.9 are, in the realm of thoughts, what ruins are in the realm of things."55 The form of the ruin comes to stand for the unavoidable pro- cesses of history itself, for the inevitability of destruction and decay. In his provocative analysis of literary allegory, Benjamin goes on to note that: In allegory the observer is confronted with the facies hippocratica of history as a petrified, primordial landscape.... this is the form in which mans subjection to nature is most obvi- ous and it significantly gives rise not only to the enigmatic question of the nature of human exis- tence as such, but also of the biographical his- toricity of the individual.56 Benjamin stressed the active role of the allegorist in imparting meaning to form. In contrast to the symbol, "which remains per- sistently the same," the allegory is "incapable of emanating any meaning or significance of its own; such significance as it has, it acquires from the allegorist."57 This casting bears striking resemblance, I think, to the active role Siskind adopted in framing his figurai subjects as fragments. Furthermore, the ulti- mate level of allegorical coding (termed the anagogie level by medieval theorists) has been provocatively linked by Jameson and Nor- thrup Frye to the emergence of the human body itself as the metaphorical reference: When we pass into anagogy.... Nature is now inside the mind of an infinite man who builds his cities out of the Milky Way. This is not real- ity, but it is the imaginative limit of desire, which is infinite, eternal, and hence apocalyp- tic. By an apocalypse I mean primarily the imaginative conception of the whole of nature as the content of an infinite and eternal living body, which, if not human, is closer to being human than to being inanimate. 5% If we accept Jameson s notion that the unity of the body must prefigure the organic unity of associative life, then Siskind s images of bodies in ruin (see Figs. 3, 9, 12, 13) can be seen as emblems of failed collectivity and the disjunctive character of modern life. 66</page><page sequence="20">This very concept was pointedly engaged by Benjamin when he cast the female prosti- tute-the ruined woman - as the modern allegory par excellence.59 Increasingly visible on the streets of the great industrial cities, the prostitute stood as the perfect emblem for the pervasive commodification of life in general. For Benjamin, these developments gave rise to the masculine desire to immobi- lize and fossilize the female body: "In the inanimate body, which can however, give itself to pleasure, allegory unites with com- modities."60 His casting of the commodified female as a petrified object finds a close parallel in the link between fetishized women and antique ruins in Siskind s work. Both the naked dancer in the Harlem club (Fig. 4) and the nude model in Louise 30 were women who earn their living by exploiting the erotic appeal of their bodies, locating them within the same economy of sex as Benjamin's prostitute. The pétrification Benjamin describes enhances the ability of the feminine body to serve as a fetish object in psychic as well as economic terms. Beyond its specific relation to Siskind's fetishized females, this link gains added resonance when one considers the larger significance of fetishism within the photographic project as a whole. As film the- oretician Christian Metz puts it, the "photo- graphic take is immediate and definitive, like death and like the constitution of the fetish in the unconscious, fixed by a glance in child- hood, unchanged and always active later."61 Metz goes on to posit that the process of framing a photograph results in a "definitive cutting off which figures castration and is figured by the 'click' of the shutter."62 In this light, photographs, especially those of indi- viduals loved and desired, are highly suited to serve as personal talismans, wallet-sized fetish objects carried around and saved to ward off castration anxiety. The gallery of pin-ups on the wall in Un titled- Most Crowded Block (Fig. 5) displays a variant on this pattern of behavior, which is importantly restricted to the male. As Mary Ann Doane has argued, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the female to assume the position of the fetishist, because her own body acts as an all too close and constant reminder of "the cas- tration which cannot be 'fetishized away.'"63 Siskind addressed the idea of castration in one of his most famous early abstractions, Gloucester iH of 1944 (Fig. 2), which features a worn work glove isolated against a back- ground of weathered floorboards. The dis- carded glove can be read metonymically as a severed hand and, by further extension, as a symbol of castration. The photographs pro- found sense of loss and absence - which, of course, is fundamental to the experience both of castration and of the wrenching of the child from the Oedipal mother at the thresh- old of the Symbolic Order- was eloquently described by Elizabeth Timberman in a review of Siskind's 1948 show at the Charles Egan Gallery: The absence of human beings and the austere composition with strong abstract elements, should not however, lead one to think of these pictures as just abstractions. The key in which they are set is romantic, nostalgic, conveying a sense of loneliness. It is as though human beings had departed from these objects, rather than that they had never been there. A brooding emotion carrying a feeling of loss seems to have found its visual counterpart in these abandoned isolated fragments of still life.64 Stiffened with age and disuse, the dis- carded glove's manifestly worn-out condition casts it quite literally as a ruined, nearly petrified object, metaphorically aligning it with Siskind's depictions of Roman ruins, torn posters, and female bodies. Captured in this state, it plays a role similar to that of cer- tain pivotal words in Lacan s theoretical vocabulary. As Gallop has suggested, the annoying recurrence of the words "phallus" and "castration" in Lacan s writing can per- haps be seen as an attempt, in his words, to "really use them up, really wear out these old words, wear them threadbare, use them until they're thoroughly hackneyed," and thereby 67</page><page sequence="21">ruin their exchange value by use.65 In its dilapidated state, Siskind s glove appears drained of both exchange value and use value. But through the magic of the art market, this exchange value is restored when the photograph of the glove is exhibited and offered for sale at the Egan Gallery. As Craig Owens has noted, the irony of this twist of fate is a regular variant of the allegorical impulse.66 The conversion of the ruined glove into an art object can be seen as another intersection of the forces of modernism and mass culture, wherein vanguard art is shamelessly depen- dent on common forms. The collapse of the codes of high art onto the order of the most basic material culture also triggers the ques- tion of the images status within the tradi- tional art-historical hierarchy of genres. By describing it as a still life, Timberman rele- gates Gloucester iH, to the lowest rung on the aesthetic ladder. But when cast as an intellec- tual abstraction, the image is raised to the most elevated realm within the modernist paradigm. This new footing is a precarious one, however, as the picture is quickly de- moted again by its status as a photograph. Photography's persistently indexical char- acter pulls it back to the arena of representa- tion, back to Lacan s realm of the Real - of history itself.67 Importantly, his conception of the Real-as-History straddles both the psy- choanalytic stress on the history of the sub- ject and the Marxist framework of historical materialism. It hovers uncomfortably between the Imaginary and Symbolic regis- ters, between pleasure and ideology. Echoing Volosinov s characterization of the word, the Real is a shared territory. Similarly, the pho- tographs considered here hover in a shared territory, both amongst each other and between themselves and the viewer. Regarded as isolated, individual images, many of these photographs seem to blatantly replicate the existing hierarchies of the social order. But when they are examinined collectively and within their cultural context, it becomes clear that Siskind consistently carves out a space where a wide range of social and aesthetic issues can be critically addressed. The binary oppositions between representation and abstraction, documentation and art are purposefully blurred, as Siskind reserves his sharpest focus for the cultural asymme- tries of gender, race, and class and their shared territory. 68</page><page sequence="22">Notes For helpful advice and hearty support in the preparation of this essay, I would like to thank Carl Chiarenza, Richard Field, Sheryl Freedland, Lisa Hodermarsky, Ainlay Samuels, Aaron Siskind, and Jonathan Weinberg.

The man in Siskind's photograph, however, is propped up on his side with one arm held protectively across his chest, and importantly, is fully clothed, making him appear less vulnerable than the typical painted courtesan. But his dreaming state serves as another signal of sexual availability, reminding us of Gustave Courbet's many depictions of highly eroticized sleeping women, such as Bather Sleeping by a Brook (1845, Detroit Institute of Arts), and The Hammock (1844, Oskar Reinhart Col- lection, Winterthur). 15 Jacques Lacan, "The Direction of the Treatment and the Principles of its Power," in Écrits: A Selection, trans.

Although the analyst is cast in the position of authority, generally the patients speak the most, taking the more active role in performing their own treatment through their own voice. 32 V. N.

A number of feminist theorists have ob- jected to the essentialism of the explications of femi- nine sexuality posed by Lacan and Irigaray, which fail to consider the body - female or male - as a cultural construction rather than a biological given.
