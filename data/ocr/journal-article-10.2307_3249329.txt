<plain_text><page sequence="1">Odette Viennot, Les Divinits Fluviales Gahga et Ya- mund, Paris, 9 64, pp. 2 o , pls. 7. 6 The two river goddesses, Gafigd and Yamuna, at the doors of the sanctuaries of India are the subject of this "essay on the evolution of a decorative theme". The latter, the subtitle of the book, is an understate- ment. By a judicious application of the comparative method of motifs initiated by Ph. Stern, Mme Viennot has not only written a history of the images of Gafiga and Yamund, but has laid the foundation for a history of sculpture in Northern India and the Northern Deccan under Vikdtaka-Gupta rule from the fifth to the tenth century, with particular relevance and exhaustive documentation for the first three centuries of this period. Indian sculpture from the fifth to the eighth century hitherto has been the fertile and often treacherous ground on which dates sprouted which shifted the single monuments by centuries from one publication to the other. The method rigorously and successfully employed throughout the book seems to be foolproof. It operates harmoniously taking account of certain se- lected and recurrent motifs in the theme of the river goddesses. By a comparison of their images the per- sistence or change of a characteristic motif is describ- ed alongside with the persistence or change (including emergence or disappearance) of other leit-motifs. This results in a closely knit framework. It comes alive with irreversible movements threaded through its terms of reference. They are balanced at each stage by motifs which subsist and represent the past as against the forward-pointing, changing motifs. The history of the theme of the river goddesses is thus seen in its making. A relative, and in its sequence firm, chronology results. It is based on thematic and not on stylistic evidence. Style as an aspect of Gestalt is based on the immediacy of its impact. In it many more factors than that of time are involved and these are not as definable as are changes of or within rele- vant single motifs. The motifs singled out in the essay on the river goddesses are: The river goddesses themselves, their positions [in relation to the door], attitude and where necessary, their attire; the attribute which surmounts them, tree, parasol or lotus; their vehicle; the object placed immediately below their feet as cushion, or support; finally, their assistants, dwarfs, adolescents, and guardians of the gate. Besides these motifs which are present throughout the development, "minor motifs" of temporary ex- istence only such as gandharva, hamsa, garland, pfrna kumbha and mithuna are taken into consideration. The book has three main divisions, dealing with the formation, maturity, and decadence of the theme. Each of these is organised in the same way. First of all the characteristic features are singled out. They are then compared with those of the preceding period. This makes apparent what continuity there is on the one hand and the innovations on the other. These observations are followed by a resume which in itself already constitutes a "relative chronology" of the monuments on which the motifs under consideration appear. Proceeding in this cautious way the continuity, trans- formation, and surcease of motifs within each of the three major sections demand subsections. These are dictated by the major innovations within the theme. There are four such sub-sections in each of the three main parts. In Part One for example, the four sub- sections are headed: A. The undifferentiated river goddesses are placed on the surcapital of the pilasters which form part of the door frame. B. The river goddesses, still undifferentiated, are placed in an extension on either side of the external moulding of the lintel. C. A capital with a brimming vase crowns the pilasters which flank the entrance. The river goddesses remain undifferentiated. D. The differen- tiation of the goddesses as Gangi and Yamuni takes place while their position remains unchanged. In each of these sub-sections, each of the accompany- 98</page><page sequence="2">ing major and minor motifs is observed in its own continuity, transformation, surcease, or replacement. It is, for example, in section D that the tree which hitherto had accompanied the goddesses is replaced by an umbrella. At the same time at the base of the door, where hitherto an anthropomorphic Ndga had been stationed, a Dvdrapdla in human shape is sub- stituted. He rests his arm on the breast of his assistant, a Gana. Now that the goddesses have been differentiated by their vhibanas, the makara and the tortoise, they occupy the bases of the door frames by the side of the guar- dians of the gate having the shape of man. The fate of the river goddesses unrolls before our eyes from phase to phase in the drama in which they play the leading parts together with their accompanying actors, while others play ephemeral roles until the river goddesses themselves lose their identity-which they had gained after considerable sculptural prepa- ration of their type (Part I, A-C) -in the final sections of Part III, by the end of the tenth century. In the closely knit presentation of the process of in- dividualisation and descent of the river goddesses and of the transformation of their companion figures, provision is made for exceptional cases. No dogma- tism encroaches on the strictly followed method. The book could be reduced to a tabulation of its contents. This would demonstrate the scientific nature of its method. While the thesis of the book is based on monuments in Northern Central India and the Northern Deccan, with regard to the formative shape, the second part of the book correlates the evolution of the theme of the river goddesses in the rest of India. An appendix on the numismatic and epigraphical do- cumentation in support of the results obtained by the method applied in the book, strengthens its results. An annex grouping the monuments in the order of discussion, which is also their chronological order, serves as a timetable for the various stages in the iconography of the river goddesses and for the chronology of the monuments on which the river goddesses figure. A few points require clarification. It is said (pp.23, 24) of the Galigi--(P1.6b, 7a, b) including one on the exterior entrance to cave XXVII Ajanta (P1.7a)-- that the makara is absent and that the external mould- ing shows a meander. P1.7a shows no meander but an unusually abbreviated, though very large, makara. With the Pgrvati temple at Nichna-KutharH begins a new section, that of the maturity of the theme when the river goddesses have descended to the base of the door. There, however, their figures are very small and precariously juxtaposed to the Dvdrapdlas, whereas the places which they have relinquished on top are occupied by large tree goddesses. A new iconographic scheme has here evolved with regard to the positions of the river goddesses, whereas the richer and more explicit door frame of Deogarh leaves the river goddesses in their positions at the top of the door frame. The Dvarapdla at the bottom and his large female companion figure are a unified pair. The dormer windows on the rooflet of the lintel corre- spond to those of the Vi'vakarmd cave temple of Ellora. This element would contribute towards the dating of the Da'dvatdra temple. Speaking of the motifs of the "flying attributes", i.e. umbrella and fly-whisk on some of the Pattadakal reliefs, the author considers and rejects the possibility of a Drdvidian importation of this theme into the Canarese country, no occurrence of flying attributes apparently being known in the South. The flying attributes, however, do occur in the South. In Mdmallapuram two attributes of Visnu Anantasayin are shown as flying dyudha purusas.
