<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 658 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 41 (2014) Gomel warns at the outset that Narrative Space and Time is not about sf, or fantasy, or postmodernism. It is a strange caution because her book is about precisely these things, and more. The book succeeds most of all as a wide- ranging fantasy and sf reference work—“a series of sketches,” as she suggests more accurately, “multiple snapshots exploring the emergence of what I see as the new narrative imagination of time and space” (37). This emergence might otherwise be described as the ascendance of the fantastic in narrative art, a process hugely accelerated in recent decades, though connected to the old rebellions against Newton, rationalism, despotism, God, and master narratives in general. Such an impressive assembly of critical “sketches” or “snapshots” devoted to Gothic, sf, fantasy, psychological, and sundry speculative fictions going back to the Victorian period deserves to find many avid readers. —Stephen Dougherty, University of Agder, Norway Proto-SF Media as Metaphor.

Dist. in the US by U of Chicago P, 2012.  David J. Jones’s Gothic Machine investigates popular visual media’s role as both metaphor and formal technique in Gothic fiction, exploring the way that Gothic literary texts and tropes influenced magic lanternists, phantasmagoria projectionists, and filmmakers during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The examination of Gothic influences is well-trod territory in visual media studies—as Jones notes, Robert Miles has posited a “deep-structural affinity” between the phantasmagoric and the Gothic (7)—but Jones pushes beyond Miles’s cautious proposal to argue that the two structures are actually inseparable, that “the term Gothic, as we know and inherit it, is the recurrent coalescence and subsequent collective operation of these media” (7; emphasis in original). Thus, up until they were assimilated into the film industry, pre-cinematic visual media and Gothic print media evolved together as constitutive parts in a “Gothic machine” of terror.  Beginning with the magic lantern craze in seventeenth-century Germany and ending with the release of Thomas Edison’s Frankenstein in 1910, which Jones cites as the moment when the “Gothic machine subset has been fully assimilated into the new medium (of film)” (17), Jones paints the history of Gothic machines with a broad brush, in the process surveying more than two centuries of British, German, American, and French literary traditions. Chapter One locates a “distinctly new cultural agglomeration” in Johann Griendel’s and Johann Schröpfer’s phantasmal shows (173-77), wherein the popularity of earlier motifs from German memento mori coalesced with new, wider access to scientific toys to create the preconditions for the magic lantern’s spectral occupation. Chapter Two moves to England, where Matthew Lewis’s The Monk (1795) initiated a number of Gothic “spin-offs and crossovers” (45) onstage and in print. Chapter Three takes us to Paris for Etienne-Gaspard Robertson’s immersive phantasmagoria, spectacles that appealed to both audiences’ preexisting “taste for all things Gothic” and their “fears engendered </page> <page sequence="2"> BOOKS IN REVIEW 659 by the Revolution” (49). In Chapter Four, Jones moves to Victorian England for a glancing survey of visuality in Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, Edward Bulwer- Lytton, and (even more briefly) Charles Dickens. Chapter Five connects writers of French Symbolist horror—Villiers de L’Isle-Adam and J.K. Huysmans—to early cinema by thinking about narrative “scope” as a visual concept; the chapter moves on to pinpoint the Gothic elements of irony, diabolism, and bodily fragmentation in Georges Méliès’s and Alice Guy’s films. In Chapter Six, Jones works against S.S. Prawer’s claim in Caligari’s Children (1980) that Robert Louis Stevenson’s Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886) predicted cinema, instead arguing, convincingly, that the text was a response to pre-existing proto-cinematic technology with which Stevenson had interacted. Jones performs a strong reading of the novella as a Gothic critique of consumerism, staged as a crisis of the fragmented body. Finally, in a forward-thinking but all-too-brief coda, Jones references what he calls “the most emphatically Gothic film ever produced in France,” Xavier Gens’s Frontière(s) [Frontier(s), 2007], which “exhibits a remarkably full and intense registration of forces which converged in its creation” (193), hinting that the film contains the afterlife of the Gothic machine. His gesture to this continuity between nineteenth century Gothic and New French Extremity suggests that film-studies scholars will find in this study some historical contexts for understanding today’s horror cinema. While Jones’s expansive approach seems appropriate for the study of a genre as enduring and widespread as the Gothic, Gothic Machine at times goes too far in sacrificing depth in favor of breadth, skimming over the surface of complex texts and contexts in a breathless recitation of titles and rarely settling into a generative close reading or sustained argument. His refusal to “simplify the extremely diverse cultural spectrum at any one time” (17) by making a too- cohesive claim results in a complexly knotted and rigorous history that could nevertheless benefit from smoother transitions and deeper exegesis. Jones does take the time for a more substantive analysis in Chapter Four, in a virtual walk-through of E.G. Robertson’s phantasmagoria show. Here, he offers a rigorous and insightful narration of the space, allowing us to imagine audiences “disoriented in a blind labyrinth” (64), witnessing religious statuary, simulated thunder and lightning, dead frogs revivified by electrical charges, and a blasphemous assemblage that mimicked and paganized the rituals of the Catholic Mass. The narration is accompanied by stills from Howard Wood’s digital reconstruction of Robertson’s performance space, which was itself based on Jones’s discovery of floor plans from the now-demolished cloisters where the phantasmagoria show was held.  It is worth noting that, in a significant sub-argument that runs throughout the text, Jones invests significant energy in rebutting influential work by Terry Castle. In The Female Thermometer (1995), Castle claimed that, by the nineteenth century, ghosts were “internalized and reinterpreted as hallucinatory thoughts” (80)—that is, that the supernatural was no longer an external spiritual presence but the product of mental disturbances. Jones refutes this, proving that “many of the people who viewed phantasmagoria shows, and </page> <page sequence="3"> 660 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 41 (2014) indeed many members of the literate classes who wrote about phantasmagoria and the existence of spirits, were anything but atheistic rationalists” (83). His complication of Castle’s thesis underpins his concept of the Gothic machine, since “hybrids of Gothic writing and phantasmagoriana ... relied heavily on a rich field of signifiers for the numinous, a potent and ongoing sense of external supernatural agency, for their full effect” (85). In pursuit of understanding how specific types of fear fueled the machine, Jones points out how the Gothic has interacted with period-specific cultural anxieties. Despite his stated disinclination toward the psychoanalytic, his occasional speculations about the anxieties and sensations that historical audiences would have experienced are among the more compelling moments in the text. I was intrigued by the way, for example, that he reminds readers of how Robertson’s show was fueled energetically by the residual historical traumas inflicted by Robespierre in the very site where it was staged, as well as the fear of these terrors reoccurring.  Sf scholars will find Chapters Five and Six, where Jones touches on the work of H.G. Wells and Jules Verne, particularly useful. Jones emphasizes Gothic thematics in sf, focusing on narratives that portray a superstitious fear of new technology rather than the idealism sometimes associated with the nineteenth-century scientific romance; in his words, certain “fin-de-siècle Gothic fictions ... dramatized the more menacing, unknown aspects of contemporary science, drawing on the language of visual projection” (179). For example, he claims that Wells used The Time Machine (1895) to “re- Gothicize recent developments in optical science” (178) by suggesting that the temporal mastery associated with Muybridge’s photographs, as with time travel, cannot forestall the threat of atavism embodied in the cannibalistic Morlocks. Jones’s discussion of Villiers’s L’Eve future [The Future Eve, 1886] interestingly reframes the sf trope of the female android by locating the creation of the novel’s robotic Hadaly among the fragmented (and, for Jones, Gothicized) bodies of early cinema, reading the fictionalized Thomas Edison, her creator, as a diabolical projectionist. Jones’s choice to read L’Eve future without reference to its bizarre gender politics is indicative of his larger tendency to avoid using texts as documents of class, race, or gender ideologies, instead opting to illustrate the complexity and specificity of the media environment that germinated new outgrowths. With its ambitious scope, excellent bibliography of current scholarship, and impressive conjuration of literary references both canonical and obscure, this study will serve as a valuable—if slightly unwieldy—sourcebook for anyone interested in the history of the Gothic or of popular visual media.—Mackenzie Gregg, University of California, Riverside Close Encounters Since the Cold War.
