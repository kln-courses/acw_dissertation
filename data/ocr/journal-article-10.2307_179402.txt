Indeed, systematic attempts even for the last hundred years have been made only recently. In general, more is known at present about the history of tropical forests in Asia and Southeast Asia than forests in Africa or South America.' This lack of knowledge is partly due to the fact that the causal factors behind the erosion of tropical forests area are particularly difficult to disentangle. However, important con- nections can be made between European expansion, the penetration of cap- italist economic forces, and the transformation of tropical environments.2 Above all, the spread of market relations in the tropics has served to encour- age the rapid clearance of forests for agriculture. The history of global defor- estation has probably been closely associated at many of its fastest stages with the dynamics of the forces of industrialisation and the expansion of a Euro- pean-centered world-system. Nevertheless, there have also been phases of I have benefited greatly in writing this paper from suggestions by William Beinart, Vinita Damodaran, Mariodi Gregorio, and Quentin Cronk. The research for it was generously supported by the Royal Society; Clare Hall, Cambridge; the British Academy, and the estate of J. C. Smuts. 1 See J. F. Richards, J. R. Hagen, and E. S. Haynes, "Changing Land-Use in Bihar, Punjab and Haryana," Modern Asian Studies, 19 (1985), 699-752. In some respects a reliance on official sources produced between 1870 and 1970 has led to a neglect of the critical but little understood period of forest clearance between 1780 and 1850, colonial perceptions of which led to the developments described in this paper. 2 For some initial attempts in this direction, see I. Wallerstein, The Modern World System (Academic Press, New York, 1974). There remain, of course, some major problems to be encountered in equating any expansion of the "European world system" with processes of ecological change. It is now well established that the activities of indigenous peoples in Australia and East Africa, for example, caused widespread ecological change long before the advent of the European. The same was true in many Pacific islands; see the chapter on Easter Island in Clive Ponting's A Green History of the World (London: Sinclair Stevenson, 1991). 0010-4175/93/2509-2384 $5.00 ?) 1993 Society for Comparative Study of Society and History 318</page><page sequence="2">CONSERVATION AND COLONIALISM 3I9 rapid change in zones as yet unaffected by the dynamics of capitalist transfor- mation as they are normally understood. The conceptual problem that arises has less to do with the difficulties of explaining the dynamics of rapid ecologi- cal change than with the problems entailed in using a monolithic and Euro- centric world system theory to describe patterns of proto-capitalist and indige- nous consumption. Thus, at various times the relatively rapid clearance of large areas of forest in much of the Pacific area, in tropical Africa, and in Northern India has taken place outside the context of the expansion of any world system. Significantly, some phases of non-European clearance have led to the development of important and ambitious state initiatives in forestry and environmental control, although very few have ever been properly inves- tigated. 3 Since the Second World War, tropical deforestation has taken place so rapidly that the prospect of the disappearance of the remaining core areas of continental forest has led to a widespread contemporary apprehension about its consequences. This is frequently expressed in terms of anxieties about global climatic change and the likely disappearance of a high proportion of existing species of fauna and flora. Such concerns are, in fact, not new and, in their essentials, constitute a re-statement of anxieties expressed for more than two centuries.4 Furthermore, interventionist responses to rapid forest destruc- tion have a long and coherent intellectual history. Many emerged from the specific circumstances of colonial expansion and associated ecological change, although there have been some important exceptions. In particular, western anxieties about the possible connections between deforestation and climatic change emerged quite specifically in the colonial rather than the metropolitan European context. This essay intends to identify, briefly, some of the main milestones in the history of early western conservationist responses to the ecological effects of the colonial transformation of the landscape and to the destruction of tropical forests in particular. Some historians have suggested that the environmentally destructive effects of colonialism were not only economic but had their roots in ideologically imperialist attitudes towards the environment.5 This does not seem an extraor- dinary thesis to advance, particularly because the evidence seems to indicate that the penetration of western economic forces (not all necessarily syn- onymous with colonialism) did indeed promote a rapid ecological transforma- 3 An outstanding exception is found in Conrad Totman's survey of forest conservation in Japan in the seventeenth century.

Indeed this notion apparently arose out of a misunderstanding about the contradictory, heterogeneous, and ambivalent nature of the colonial state's workings. Above all, a number of scholars have been generally unaware of the extent to which colonial governments were peculiarly open to the pressures of contemporary environmental lobby during the first half of the nineteenth century, a time of great uncertainty about the role and long-term security of the colonial state. Thus, although it undoubtedly promoted widespread ecological destruction, colonial enterprise also helped to create a context conducive to rigorous analytical thinking about the processes of ecological change and to the formation of a conservation ideology.8 Ironically, too, the colonial state in its pioneering conservationist role pro- vided a forum for controls on the unhindered operations of capital for short- term gain which, it might be argued, constituted a fundamental contradiction to what is normally supposed to have made up the common currency of imperial expansion and profit maximisation.9 Moreover, the absolutist nature of colonial rule made it possible to introduce interventionist forms of land management that would have been very difficult to impose in Europe, even though many of them provoked active indigenous resistance. Colonial expan- sion also promoted the rapid diffusion of new scientific ideas and environmen- tal concepts among colonies and between metropole and colony over a large area of the world. Such ideas sometimes acquired a potent momentum of their own independent of the apparatus of colonial rule while still exerting influ- ence on its actors. Conservation in its more modem sense has often been perceived as a phenomenon with antecedents in late nineteenth- or early twentieth-century North America. 10 This interpretation regards Henry D. Thoreau, John Muir, 6 For a useful survey, see R. P. Tucker and J. R. Richards, eds., Global Deforestation and the World Economy (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1983). 7 See R. H.

In contrast, scholars dismiss colonial conservation and forestry regula- tion, especially in India, as mere disguises legitimised by a subordinate colo- nial science for resource exploitation and land seizure by the state. 1I1 Although some elements of truth in such doctrinaire accounts are normally coupled with doubtful notions of pre-colonial Golden Ages of ecological balance, they have all tended to overlook the remarkably innovative nature of early colonial conservationism, the characteristics of which have been very much neglected until recently. They also tend to underplay the highly developed trend towards exclusionist forms of state forest control developed in pre-colonial states in South Asia, as well as the well-established history of rapid, and often state- sponsored, deforestation in the centuries before the onset of East India Com- pany rule in the sub-continent.'2 As a result the notion of North American primacy in conservation thinking has remained unquestioned. In fact, a good deal of evidence indicates that complex notions of state intervention in natural resource protection, many of them strongly connected with new and highly anthropomorphic valuations of the environment, emerged and were extensively promulgated in the colonial context more than a century before George Perkins Marsh published his famous Man and Nature in 1864.13 What is more, Marsh apparently drew much of his inspiration from a detailed knowledge of the history of important colonial experiments in environmental intervention. Indeed, the very speed of degradation induced by colonization helped to evoke such experimentation. 14 Colonial conservationism probably did emerge not so much because coloni- al annexation and capitalisation brought about extensive ecological changes as because the conditions inherent in early Dutch, French and British colonial rule promoted the rapid rise of a distinctive group of professional naturalists and scientists to disproportionate influence. Many of these early experts con- structed an effective critique of the environmental effects of colonial rule, often as a surrogate for more direct but less politically palatable social com- I I See especially R.

Pre-eminent among these professional natu- ralists, especially in India before the 1851 rebellion, were the medical sur- geons of the East India Company, whose relatively influential status permitted a very rapid diffusion of their environmental diagnoses and interventionist prescriptions. Their outlook was strongly influenced by Hippocratic and Physiocratic ways of thinking. Both of these medically based philosophies dealt implicitly with the relations between the external environment and the health of man. 15 Their impact was, in environmental terms, more keenly felt in the tropics than in contemporary Europe, where vegetational changes in more temperate conditions were generally much slower and less easily ob- served in their effects. Although the Hippocratic interpretation of environ- mental processes was innate to the training of all western physicians, the Physiocratic environmental critique (itself derived from medical antecedents), was much more narrowly confined, at first, to the response of French colonial science to tropical conditions in the late eighteenth century. By the 1760s in Mauritius (and a little later in India and the Cape Colony), these two environ- mental discourses had been translated into a set of highly interventionist conservation policies, preceding the emergence of conservationism in either Europe or the United States. 16 Thus, as early as 1840, one can clearly distinguish the emergence of fully developed environmental concerns and conservation policies strongly rein- forced by what were considered to be scientific interpretations of environmen- tal interactions. These interpretations were based largely on the writings of French and German Romantic scientists and, later, on the work of Alexander von Humboldt. 17 Such concerns had not developed in isolation. From the late eighteenth century, particularly in Mauritius (the Isle de France), environmen- talist theories developed in close association with political or even revolution- ary radicalism, anti-slavery, and overt anti-colonial sentiment, as well as with a naturalistic Orientalism. Such interconnections have been a characteristic feature of the early history of conservationism. Along with Alexander von Humboldt, other thinkers also serve to exemplify the apparent dualism of environmental and social reform in the critically formative years between 1770 and 1870. Pierre Poivre, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Ernst Dieffenbach, P. E. Strzelecki, Hugh Cleghorn, Edward Balfour, John Croumbie Brown, and Henry David Thoreau all stand out as exemplars of this phenomenon. 15 For an extended introduction to the evolution of Hippocratic environmental psychology see Clarence Glacken, Traces on the Rhodian Shore (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1969). 16 See R. H. Grove, "Conservation and Colonial Expansion," (PhD thesis, University of Cambridge, 1988, Ch. 5). It has to be said that the more utopian and transcendental elements in conservationism during the period were partly suppressed, for fairly obvious reasons. Neverthe- less a careful inspection of the writings of Hugh Cleghorn in particular indicates similar underly- ing preoccupations, reinforced by the Humboldtian antecedents of much of early conservation thinking in colonial India. 17 For a specific characterisation of this genre of science, see A. Cunningham and N. Jardine, eds., Romanticism and the Sciences (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990).</page><page sequence="6">CONSERVATION AND COLONIALISM 323 Only in its later stages of development did conservationism, as a highly bureaucratised justification for state control of land use, start to enforce its own inflexible and alienating logic. Moreover, conservationism then evoked widespread popular resistance in the context of the development of the more narrowly defined interests of late nineteenth-century imperialism.18 By then the original reformist ideologues of colonial conservation had almost all long since faded in influence. Their ideological successors were, instead, to be found at work far more in the metropolitan context, where state conserva- tionism developed much more slowly in response to the pressures of urban growth and industrialisation.19 EARLY EUROPEAN COLONIAL EXPANSION AND THE ORIGINS OF WESTERN CONSERVATIONISM The essential precepts of modern conservation actually arose from the condi- tions of colonial rule and colonial notions of the state's role. Indeed conserva- tionist ideas developed almost in tandem with the growth of the material demands of nascent capitalism, whether in its European form or in indigenous forms in, for instance, pre-colonial India, China, or Japan. The growth of market relations and urbanisation had, of course, long been associated with deforestation in Europe and the Middle East, particularly in the more southern margins of these regions.20 Indeed, it was in the course of the deforestation of classical Greece that Theophrastus of Erasia, an early ecologist, as well as the keeper of Aristotle's botanic garden and his archivist, first put forward his precocious theories of desiccation. These linked deforestation and declines in rainfall with the destruction of trees around the perimeters of the Greek city- states.21 In temperate northern Europe, anxieties about the impact of defores- tation developed much later than this and for reasons more straightforwardly connected with timber depletion. During early medieval phases of European expansion eastward into the forests of Germany and central Europe, some pioneer attempts were made to limit agricultural clearance under the German kings. Sometimes these involved very clear-sighted notions of sustainable timber use and, in very rare instances, an awareness of the value of forest 18 See Richard Grove, "Colonial Conservation, Ecological Hegemony and Popular Re- sistance; Towards a Global Synthesis," in J.

In particular, the mer- cantile and colonial expansion of Venice gave rise to a phase of very rapid and destructive deforestation in Northern Italy, Dalmatia, and Crete.23 The mili- tary and strategic demands of the empire implied a need for a continuous supply of wood for ship and barge building, most of which was carried out at the Arsenale in Venice itself.24 One of the first signs of the progressive deforestation of the Venetian hinterland, the movement of the barge-building industry inland from Venice, was well under way in the second quarter of the fifteenth century. During the 1450s, the high rate of deforestation apparently became recognised as a danger to the Venice lagoon because it increased the amount of silt brought down by the rivers. To prevent the lagoons from filling up, the Council of Ten ordered the re-planting of all cut over woods at the edges of streams of flowing water.25 A definite policy designed to conserve and increase the supply of oak from state woodlands was formulated between 1470 and 1492. Although innovative, these measures failed almost entirely to conserve or replenish the timber supply or to curb the ruinous destruction of the oak woods, which continued unabated until the sixteenth century. This failure contributed in no small measure to the decline of Venice and its trading and military displacement by maritime powers with easier access to relatively undepleted forests.26 However, while the Venetian experience of contending with soil erosion was certainly important, far more holistic or comprehensive speculations about the processes of environmental degradation were taking shape on the new European island colonies. These speculations eventually focussed on the connections between deforestation and climatic change. From the twelfth century onwards the Spanish and Portuguese colonisation of the Canary islands, Madeira, and, after 1492, the West Indies started to lead to a developing awareness of the capacity of the colonist to decimate both indigenous populations and forest cover. The high rate of deforestation in Madeira and the Canary islands was directly related to the remarkable growth in the emergent European urban market for sugar products and the oppor- tunities for profits presented by the development of sugar plantations. Faced with the consequences of deforestation and the loss of hydraulic storage 22 See E. Mummenhoff, Altnurnberg (Bamberg, 1890), 55-57. 23 Ellen C.

In particu- lar, Theophrastus' classical theories were circulated once more with the Re- naissance, while the publication of his works in Latin in 1483 assured their wider dissemination. 28 Christopher Columbus, for example, is reported by his son, Ferdinand, to have warned constantly of the dangers of forest clearance on West Indian islands, such as a decline in rainfall.29 Such notions may have arisen from the explorer's own observations of the acute water shortages in the Canary islands after the forests were cut over. These observations are likely to have been coupled with a knowledge of Theophrastus' theories. Thus on the earliest European island colonies the destructive effects of capital-intensive economic activity first became fully apparent and elicited an environmental critique. Significantly too, at about this time the classical idea of the island as an Eden or social refuge was revivified, much as The- ophrastus' ideas had received a new lease of life at the time of Columbus. Indeed the conviction that an Eden might be found across the ocean may have sustained Columbus in his transatlantic exploit.30 Long before this, in Pur- gatorio, Dante had already transferred classical notions of Paradise or the Hesperides to the Atlantic in the form of an "earthly paradise" or "a island in the Southern Ocean."'31 During the fifteenth century too, the developing Renaissance conception of the botanic garden as a symbolic location for the recreation of Paradise took firm root, displacing the simpler apothecarial connotations of the early medi- eval herbal gardens.32 In this way the Italians (and shortly afterwards the Dutch, French and English) adapted and elaborated upon Arabic, Persian, and Mughal garden models, thus structurally incorporating notions of Paradaeza (meaning, literally, in Farsi/Ancient Iranian, an enclosed garden) associated with the gardens of, for example, Mesopotamia and Moorish Spain. All these changes formed part of an important Renaissance shift in attitudes away from identifying earthly Nature with the fallen state of man and towards a new conception of nature as an intended and beneficent part of divine 27 R.

By about 1550, therefore, many of the major intellectual and meta- phorical themes had emerged which were later to form the infrastructure for a new kind of environmentalist response to evidence of the Europeans' destruc- tive capabilities in tropical climates. Although the conditions of European protocapitalism (with its nascent urban market for luxury products from the tropics) stimulated the onset of tropical plantation agriculture and the tropical timber trade, a new valuation of nature (symbolised at first in the re-creation of Paradise in the botanic garden and closely associated with the geographical search for the Garden of Eden) provided a philosophical and quasi-theological basis for an interventionist response to environmental destruction. As a part of this response, it is noteworthy that two European precedents for land manage- ment, new irrigation technology and the antecedents of the botanic garden, played a significant part. More important, the paradise metaphor, particularly in its stereotyped association with newly colonised and previously uninhabited desert islands, acquired a transitional symbolic role in the more complex use of the image of island as a device for representing religious or social utopias. Although Thomas More had pioneered the use of this utopic form as the basis for social critique, it received a new lease of life with the spread of a dis- tinctively Calvinistic willingness to perceive and create earthly paradises, a development reflected in the emergence of a whole genre of desert island literature in English and French. Bishop Francis Godwin's The man in the moone is a case in point. The book conceived of the island of St. Helena as a paradise and pointed to the limitations of its resources in sustaining visiting Europeans. By fictionally representing his hero, Diego Gonzales, as a man who moves physically away from island (a convenient metaphor for the world), circles the world in a flying machine, and then views the world from the moon, Godwin underlined the new physical and interpretative power of man relative to the world and the cosmos. Implicitly, then, Godwin portrays man as having acquired both a new capacity for destructiveness and a capaci- ty, in the terms of the seventeenth-century scientific revolution, to understand and control his actions. Appropriately, both these new capacities began to be displayed on St. Helena in the late seventeenth century. However, the devel- opment of a utopic, yet empirically based, literary genre became of great consequence in conceptualising the growing human impact, especially among the adherents of such utopian writers as Defoe and his devotee, Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The rapid expansion of European plantation agriculture in the West Indies did promote some attempts at conservation during the seventeenth century. Often, however, the response to environmental degradation involved a pro- gressive westward displacement from one Caribbean island to another as these environments were successively exhausted by plantation cropping. It soon became clear that the very destructive and visually dramatic impact of planta- tion agriculture on the soils of a tropical island required either outmigration and relocation of the whole plantation economy or the development of a</page><page sequence="10">CONSERVATION AND COLONIALISM 327 systematic conservationist response. Proximity to other islands and to South America meant that the former course was often adopted in the West Indies. The Dutch, for example, in a number of instances, shifted their plantation activities from island to island and then, eventually, to Brazil.33 As David Watts has recently shown, conservationist forms of soil erosion control did develop in the West Indies during the seventeenth century.34 However, they were devoted more to ensuring the continuation of plantation activity than the survival of any forest cover. Those colonial officials, such as the Governor of Barbados in the 1670s, who expressed more comprehensive concerns and plans for conservation, were generally ignored by their masters at the metropole.-35 The emergence in the seventeenth century of a new kind of capitalist structure, the joint stock trading company, as a new, flexible, and more capital-intensive element in European expansion helped to promote plantation and trading activities at a much greater distance from Europe than before. This provided, too, the conditions for further far-reaching environmental changes. The new companies, often reinforced by the growing ambitions of European states, began to transform some of the often uninhabited oceanic islands, earlier treated simply as stopping places for the ships of many nations, into the locations of more permanent kinds of settlement for military and plantation development, as well as timber extraction. By 1670 St. Helena, Mauritius, and Formosa had all been colonised by the Dutch or the English. It was on these islands, located along the main trading routes to India and China, that sophisticated forms of state conservation first emerged. In some respects the Cape of Good Hope can also be treated physiographically as an island, with a parallel and early growth in the state's awareness of environmental con- straints 36 The tropical island colonies were generally small and the consequences of deforestation, especially in terms of streamflow decline, could be quickly observed and thus acted upon. In this way insular environments stimulated both innovative interventionist responses and theorisation in environmental terms. The history of St. Helena illustrates this particularly well.37 Annexed by the English in 1659, the island was extremely isolated. This extreme 33 J.

Watts, Environmental Change, Slavery and Agricultural Development in the Caribbean since 1492 (Cambridge, 1985). 35 This stood in stark contrast to the official response developing outside the European do- main, particularly in Japan. Here, as Conrad Totman has recently revealed, rapid population increases, urban growth, and fuelwood demand had led to a widespread ecological crisis by the mid-seventeenth century. The Tokugawa Shogunate responded by initiating an elaborate forest conservation and reafforestation programme designed both to safeguard timber reserves and prevent soil erosion. These measures do, however, not appear to have become known to European contemporaries. See C. Totman, The Green Archipelago. 36 See Grove, "Early Themes in African Conservation," 21-39. 37 For an overall historical treatment, see P.

By 1700 St. Helena had become extensively deforested, and soil erosion and deep gullying were widespread. The history of this progressive degradation is recorded in minute detail in Company diaries and in correspondence between the governor and the EIC Court of Directors in London,38 which also elaborately record the story of the inno- vative early attempts made to impede further deterioration.3 In less remote locations the island would have been quickly abandoned. Indeed, in 1716, a newly arrived Governor of St. Helena canvassed the possibility of resettling the inhabitants on Mauritius, which the Dutch had recently vacated.40 The continuing importance of St. Helena to the Company as a replenishment point meant that this could not realistically be allowed to happen. Between 1670 and 1770, therefore, almost every successive governor on the island attempted to control the ecological changes which were taking place. The most ambitious efforts were those made by Governor Roberts in 1709, who set up forest reserves and afforestation programmes, introduced an irrigation system, and attempted to exterminate the goat population, which he had identified as peculiarly destructive.41 Furthermore, he and his successor attempted to transplant specimens of the increasingly rare St. Helena redwood in the fear that it was about to become extinct.42 The efforts of the Governors, amongst the earliest made in recognition of the likely extinction of an endemic species, were successful. Later Governors, particularly John Byfield in the 1730s, imitated Roberts' conservationist methods and philosophy.43 In so doing they found themselves constantly at odds, as Roberts had been, with the relatively unschooled opinion of the East India Company's Court of Directors. Indeed, throughout the eighteenth century the Company seemed quite incapa- ble of understanding the environmental consequences of introducing planta- tion schemes into the island and was especially unwilling to support the Governors in their efforts to regulate the environment of the island through protecting the forests and corralling animals. Each succeeding Governor quickly found himself siding with the settler freeholders against the Company on a wide variety of land-use issues, not the least being the recognition of the need for communal land-use practices, to which the islanders had consistently 38 For a detailed compilation of the St. Helena records, see H.

There, he as- serted, the Dutch colonists had made a "Paradise of a desert," while the Company had allowed the "Paradise" of St. Helena to "become a desert."45 The central difficulty for the Governor-conservationists of St. Helena was that they had to deal with a Company hierarchy that, before the 1790s, possessed no insights into the impact of European capital-intensive and slave- employing agricultural methods on a tropical landscape or into the destructive hydrological consequences of tropical deforestation. In direct contrast to the French state at the same period, the EIC had not at this stage yet developed any serious commitment to the commercial or practical cultivation of scien- tific expertise.46 A further problem related to the divergent traditions of the state's involvement in forestry in England and France. In England the state's role in forest regulation, particularly during and after the Commonwealth period, became severely restricted. As a result, that country was forced in- creasingly to rely upon timber supplies from the Baltic region and North America.47 In France, by contrast, the state itself acquired a more direct role in forest control under Colbert's direction.48 Thus in the period from 1660 to 1760, as a consequence of these differences, two quite separate models of tropical forest management developed on St. Helena and Mauritius respec- tively. A distinctive forest conservation system was also developed at the Cape but was cut short by the onset of British rule. In France, the provisions of the 1669 Forest Ordinance ensured that forest management was treated in conjunction with water management and adminis- tered by Inspecteurs des Eaux et Forets.49 Thus, from the outset, French approaches to the environment of Mauritius involved a well-developed awareness of the possibility of ecological regulation and control. The Dutch had already exploited intensively the ebony for the market in luxury island 44 Ibid., 105-6. 45 Sir Joseph Banks, diary entry, dt May 1771 in J. C.

Koenig had earlier held a post as "Naturalist" to the Nawab of Arcot. The much earlier instance of patronage by the Company represented by the sponsorship of Edmund Halley on his St. Helena expedition in 1676 should perhaps be discounted for this purpose. 47 J.

Indeed, the exclusively depletionary management of Mauritius seems to have been the exception to the general rule of Dutch caution. Deliberate and sys- tematic working of the teak forests in Java, on an apparently sustainable basis, had already been commenced by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1677.52 Such a policy clearly depended on a considerable degree of territorial control of a kind not yet achieved in Asia by the French or British during this period. When the French annexed Mauritius in 1721, the commercial rivalry be- tween Britain and France had begun to sharpen. This led directly to a intensive contest for control over sources of marine timber for the navies needed for the growing struggle for global trade and influence, particularly in the Indian Ocean.53 It was in this setting that the financial collapse of the Compagnie des Indes after 1763 elicited the direct intervention of the French Crown in the government of Mauritius and a more direct attempt at intervention in the control of the strategically important forests.54 The fact that the French pos- sessed no equivalent to the vast forests of North America, which were now accessible to the British, further stimulated a cautious attitude towards timber resources, particularly on Mauritius (the Isle de France) and Reunion (Bourbon). An analogous process had been taking place in India itself. From as early as AD 800 a gradual pattern of state forest control had been emerging.55 Rein- 50 J. R.

Thus, as early as the 1740s, the rulers of the Maratha empire had found it expedient to acquire control over large tracts of coastal forest and to set up plantations, both for shipbuilding and revenue.56 In Cochin and Travancore similar monopoly controls over forest were initiated.57 However, the most extensive pre-colonial programmes for afforestation and forest protection were carried on, between 1770 and 1840, by the Amirs of Sind.58 Such pre-colonial policies of state forest control in India are historically important, not least because the British used them extensively to legitimate new attempts at forest reservation in the Bom- bay Presidency during the 1840s.59 Thus, by about 1770, throughout many regions of South Asia, the Mas- carenes, and the East Indies, a widespread emergence of state forest controls had become clearly apparent. This phenomenon developed as relatively inte- grated forces of economic penetration began to respond to new levels of trade and demand, particularly in the search for timber to satisfy the increasingly complex demands of both western and indigenous navies and growing urban centres.60 In Mauritius the demands of the colonial state took a very dis- tinctive form. A continuing timber shortage in France and the growing size of the French navy meant that Labourdonnais, Governor of Mauritius after 1731, found it worthwhile to construct and repair ships locally, utilising Mauritius teak. A fleet of these ships was then used, successfully, to attack Madras in 1746.61 56 Report of the Bombay Forest Commission, 1887, vols. 1 and 2 (Bombay: Government Press, 1887). The taxation features of Maratha forest policy are an unexplored field in research terms; however, for a cursory survey, see H. B. Vashishta, Land Revenue and Public Finance in Maratha Administration, (Delhi, 1975, 138-46). 57 Until the end of the eighteenth century, the forests of Cochin were under the control of the feudal chiefs of Nadivazlis, who owed allegiance to the Rajah of Cochin. In 1813 a forest department was set up under a Mellei Melvicharappan [Mountain Superintendent]; see H.

Under Labourdonnais the ecological distortions that had developed in an island environment subjected to the demands of a plantation economy gave rise, as they had on St. Helena, to anxieties about the capacity of this climat- ically unreliable island even to produce sufficient food for its settler popula- tion and slave-labour force.62 These fears led Labourdonnais to develop a new botanic garden with the specific objective of breeding drought-resistant crops to tide the population over the leaner years. This type of institutional concept was later imitated and elaborated by Colonel Robert Kyd as justification for founding a botanic garden at Calcutta in 1786, an innovation which later became vital in providing the infrastructure for the scientific monitoring of environmental changes in India.63 The most significant intellectual departure in French environmental policy on Mauritius, the installation of a forest reservation system, was explicitly based on the fear of the impact of deforestation on rainfall and soil erosion. This was a direct consequence of the assumption of direct political control by the Crown and the rise to political influence in government, especially in the Navy ministry, of a group of men strongly attracted by Physiocracy, a political and economic philosophy which had originated in the writings of economist Richard Cantillon and physician Francois Quesnay. Significantly, it attached particular importance to the working of the "laws of nature" in economics.64 The political ascendancy of the Physiocrats facilitated the appointment of Pierre Poivre as Commissaire-Intendant of Mauritius in 1766. Poivre had evolved a conservationist approach to the environment essentially as matter of moral economy in a manner characteristic of the Physiocrats. A proper under- standing of the basis of the environmental moral economy which he advocated necessitates an appreciation of the antecedents of the man himself.65 Poivre was at one time a Jesuit priest and had first visited Mauritius in the 1740s. He then used the island as the base for a series of expeditions to collect spice tree specimens from the Moluccas.66 A primary part of this exercise involved attempts to transplant imported species of spices in Mauritian soil. This had 62 R. Toussaint, ed., Dictionary of Mauritian Biography, 154. See also; Grove, "Conserva- tion and Colonial Expansion," 88-102. 63 R.

He had become especially appre- ciative of the attempts made by the Dutch at the Cape in soil erosion preven- tion and in planting shelter belts.67 Poivre became very critical of what he saw as the profligate and destructive felling of trees on Mauritius, maintaining that the lack of control contrasted badly with Dutch practices at the Cape. Poivre had, furthermore, made him- self familiar, during a period of enforced detention in Canton, with Chinese horticultural methods.68 Later, too, he became acquainted at Pondicherry and in Malabar with indigenous Indian techniques for irrigation and planting trees and referred extensively to this knowledge in his writings.69 Poivre's return to France coincided with the rise in prominence of the agronome and a period of intense activity in Enlightenment science. After his arrival, he added to his unrivalled knowledge of tropical land-use practices in a wide-ranging survey of travel and scientific literature on the Americas in which he probably first encountered dessication theories.70 Significantly, many of his writings during this period contained biting critiques of the Europeans' treatment of indige- nous peoples in the Americas, and his extensive lectures on tropical land use and agriculture aimed particularly scathing criticism at colonial land-use methods.7' These criticisms soon came to the attention of the Physiocratic political circle surrounding the Duc de Choiseul, who was himself closely associated with Physiocratic thinking and attracted by a philosophy which set great store by notions of the moral superiority of agricultural versus financial prosperity and by the virtues of scientific agriculture versus short-term profit- making.72 The Duc de Choiseul had, however, found it politically impossible to assert his reforming Physiocratic zeal in any substantial way in France itself, so he increasingly turned to the colonies in the hope of exercising his reforming ideals, much as Lord Dalhousie did in India in the next century. The encounter with Mauritius gave both de Choiseul and Poivre the oppor- tunity to experiment with their ideas. Choiseul could exercise the role of the 67 Pierre Poivre, Travels of a Philosopher; or Observations on the Manners of the Various Nations in Africa and Asia (Dublin, 1770). 68 On the value of empirical observations of the Orient, see P.

"If the forests do not regenerate in the island," Choiseul wrote in his instructions to Poivre, rain will be less frequent, the over-exposed soil will be burnt by the sun. . . timber shall be your particular attention. . . Complaints have been made that this very important matter has not received all the care and attention which it deserves. Messrs Dumas and Poivre should hasten to control it with a good policy; they will exercise the existing regulations on the subject, study the exact conditions of the forests, exploit and utilise them in the most economical way possible and only allow people to cut them if they ensure their conservation.73 On his arrival in Mauritius in 1767 Poivre immediately made a series of speeches and proclamations to the French colonists, many of which specifical- ly emphasised the high priority attached to preserving the island forests.74 This, he asserted, would assure the colony a reliable level of rainfall. A morality expressed in land use, Poivre implied, would complement the re- ligious morality of the individual. These environmental homilies were later published as revolutionary tracts in Paris in 1797, probably less for their revolutionary environmentalism than for their class-based critique of colonial absentee landlordism.75 The desire to make a clean sweep of colonial conven- tions did not stop with plans for environmental reform. Poivre also took initial steps in a campaign to abolish slavery on the island, a cause which he was unable to carry through. Indeed, he experienced much opposition both in this respect and in his conservation programmes, not least from a succession of island Governors who felt threatened by his attempts to stamp out timber and property speculation by colonial officials for private gain. At the end of 1768 the departure of Governor Dumas, disgraced for his corrupt involvement in land sales, allowed Poivre to carry on his conservation programmes unhin- dered. The first Forest Conservation Ordinance, or Reglement Economique, passed in November 1769,76 proved to be a model of its kind. During the next century, its essential elements were incorporated in future statutes in, for example, St. Vincent (West Indies), the Cape Colony, Natal, and India.77 73 R.

Evidence of the diffusion of knowledge of Mauritius forest protection</page><page sequence="18">CONSERVATION AND COLONIALISM 335 In his pioneering conservation efforts, Poivre enlisted the aid of two men in particular, Philibert Commerson and J. H. Bernardin de St. Pierre. Poivre contrived to secure an appointment on the island as a government scientist for Commerson, who had arrived in Mauritius in November 1768 as the naturalist on the Bougainville expedition. Officially Commerson was intended to carry out a pharmacological and timber resource survey of the Mauritius forests .78 These surveys provided the justification for Poivre's far-reaching conservation legislation of 1769, who was also backed in his efforts against the anti- conservation interests on the island and in Paris by the Chief Engineer of the colony, Bernardin de Saint Pierre. Later better known as one of the first French romantic novelists and orientalists, Saint Pierre was a pioneer figure in campaigns against slavery, a practice which he had first witnessed on Mauritius .79 It was Saint Pierre who first pointed out to Poivre the extent to which deforestation on the island was contributing to the rapid siltation of the main rivers and harbours of the island. This observation led Poivre to develop the twin concepts of the mountain reserve and the river reserve, the intellec- tual antecedents of ideas which were widely applied in India after 1846. These steps were only partially successful in inhibiting the rate of deforestation on the island which, towards the end of the eighteenth century and increasingly during the nineteenth century, came under exceptional pressure as a result of the activities of sugar plantation owners. However, had Poivre not introduced his conservation system, there is little doubt that deforestation would have proceeded at a much more rapid pace. Even today the boundaries of some of the reserves established by 1800 can still be seen, particularly along the west coast of Mauritius, adjacent to Black River and Tamarin. Most of the conservationist initiatives taken by Poivre were essentially locally derived. The critical innovation contained in the new conservation measures, while based in a broad sense on Colbert's 1669 Forest Ordinance, consisted of the articulation of new insights into the relationship between forest cover, stream flow, soil erosion, and rainfall. Poivre's most effective argument to justify the sterilisation of forest capital as reserved land involved a conviction that deforestation would cause a decline in rainfall. However, in evolving a methodology for conservation in 1769, Poivre's precedents were only partly European. His tree-planting policies, for example, were based entirely on Indian precedents, and he utilised species imported from Malabar and Bengal, especially bois noir.80 regulations into India as early as 1844 is provided in W. H. Sleeman, Rambles and Recollections of an Indian Official (London: J. Hatchard, 1844), 450. 78 A certificate releasing Commerson to the service of Poivre's administration was delivered to him by Bougainville on 15 November 1768.

These fell roughly into two kinds: the scientific and botanical and the unashamedly utopian. The presence of one of the largest and most elaborate botanical gardens in the world, sometimes known as a "wonder of the East," and the presence of Commerson, one of the most experienced and well-travelled French botanists of the period, meant that the rich and endemic flora of the island was soon recognised as scientifically important in world terms, highly valued aesthetically and worthy of preserva- tion.81 This alone constituted a significant impetus for the embryonic conser- vation lobby. Further encouragement to protect the island in its natural state was provided by the individual predilections of St. Pierre and Commerson. Both were avid field botanists steeped in the writings of Rousseau (another contemporary botanist, who is better known in other roles).82 Both were also social rebels who valued the natural state of the island as integral to their conception of the colony as a practical and mental refuge from the political and, for them, moral turmoil of metropolitan France. As a member of Bougainville's expedition, Commerson had the opportunity to observe the inhabitants of Tahiti (which he called utopie) and believed their society idyllic in social and environmental terms. His writings indicate that by 1768 he was already very critical of metropolitan France and its prevailing social values. He had little desire to return to France and, indeed, never did so before he died on Mauritius in 1773. Bernardin de Saint Pierre, trained in botany by Poivre himself, returned to France to write Paul et Virginie and to become the main confidant of Rousseau, whom he had long admired and corresponded with. His manifestly ecological views were set out in three major texts, Journey to the Isle de France, Studies in Nature (in which Paul et Virginie formed the fourth volume) and Harmonies of Nature. Poivre, Commerson, and Saint Pierre all arrived in Mauritius at a time when the French preoccupation with the "Robinsonades" (imitations of Defoe's Robinson Crusoe) was developing into a fully developed cult or mythology of the South Sea tropical island. The desire of all three men to preserve an unspoilt utopian island environment necessitated some form of environmentalism, simply to ensure the continuity of the Rousseauian return to nature to which they were dedicated.83 None of these motivations would have been transmuted into the conservation policies pursued by Poivre had it not been for the opportunity which the Physiocrats 81 This valuing was of a very personal kind on Commerson's part: "My plants," he wrote, "my beloved plants have consoled me for everything; I found in them, Nepenthes, curare, dulce" (S. Pasfield-Oliver, The Life of Philibert Commerson [London, 1909], 202). 82 For details of Rousseau's botanical enthusiasms, see J. J. Rousseau, Letters on the Elements of Botany Addressed to a Lady, T. Martyn, trans. (London, 1782). 83 See Grove, "Conservation and Colonial Expansion," 154-82.</page><page sequence="20">CONSERVATION AND COLONIALISM 337 had provided to Poivre in political terms. This permitted him free rein to pursue his environmental programme and his innovatory state patronage of scientific expertise. The emergence of conservationism on Mauritius under Poivre might be considered of merely antiquarian interest, but it was not so. The Isle de France lay intellectually and geographically, as did Tahiti at the same period, at the very core of the outward-looking intellectual and Romantic projects of late- eighteenth-century France. One of the earliest major literary figures in the French Romantic reaction, Bernardin de Saint Pierre above all ensured that Mauritius became a central and symbolic focus of contemporary aesthetic and Orientalist-leaning perception.84 As a product of this intellectual climate, Poivre's conservationism itself left an intellectual legacy of environmental attitudes both in Mauritius itself (which remained in the forefront of conserva- tion ideas until the 1870s) and throughout a much wider colonial context.85 After Poivre left the island for France in 1772, his legislation for forest conservation was strengthened in 1777 and 1795, then much further elabo- rated in 1804, at a time when the colony had acquired effective political autonomy under Governor Decaen.86 Political isolation and naval blockade then encouraged the passing of additional pioneering environmental legisla- tion in the fields of water pollution, fishery protection, and safeguarding watersheds. As was the case much later in India, the state botanic garden set up by Poivre at Pamplemousses provided an essential part of the intellectual and technical infrastructure needed for these innovations. Furthermore the notion of the colonial scientific Acade6mie, first conceptualized in 1770 by Philibert Commerson, ensured a continuity of scientific tradition developed further in the form of the Royal Society of Arts and Sciences of Mauritius.87 Both in Mauritius and later in India and Southern Africa the existence of such local scientific institutions proved a critical stimulus to the formulation of colonial responses to environmental change and provided a platform for conservation propagandists, such as Louis Bouton in Mauritius and Edward Balfour in Madras.88 In contrast to the situation on St. Helena until the 1780s, 84 See B. de Saint Pierre, Studies of Nature, 5 vols. (London, 1796); Harmonies of Nature, 3 vols (London, 1815); Paul et Virginie (London, 1841); La Chaumiere Indienne (Calcutta, 1866). 85 For specific details of the links between Poivre's conservation policy on Mauritius and the environmental philosophy of Edward Balfour, the original proponent of forest protection in the Madras presidency, see IOL, V/27/568/107 [Correspondence files on trees and the incidence of rainfall]. 86 The main articles were Arrete of the 13th Messidor, Art. 111 (July 1795); and Arrete of the 14th Vendemiaire, Art XII (October 1804).

For Balfour's</page><page sequence="21">338 RICHARD GROVE the environmental analysis of the consequences of deforestation on Mauritius was based not only on local observation but on insights derived from a whole range of intellectual concepts developed in regions as diverse as France, the Cape Colony, China, and Malabar. However, Poivre had synthesized a co- herent body of environmental thought, stimulated largely by the specific conditions of colonial rule in the tropics. However, until the 1820s no com- parable intellectual development of an environmental consciousness had yet emerged in metropolitan Europe. The first application of Poivre's ideas outside Mauritius itself took place, perhaps not surprisingly, on St. Helena. Surveys carried out by Alexander Beatson, an army officer and subordinate of Arthur Wellesley in Mysore, on Mauritius in 1794 indicated that by then the scientific rationale behind forest reservation on Mauritius was becoming more widely known.89 Thus, in that same year the EIC somewhat belatedly instructed the St. Helena government to protect the forests on the island as a way of ensuring that the rainfall would not decline.90 The establishment of botanic gardens at Calcutta and St. Helena in 1788, which imitated the French establishment on Mauritius, may have heightened EIC sensitivity to the potential damage that dessication might cause. Certainly the famines in Bengal between 1770 and 1784 had been a major anxiety to the Company, particularly to Captain Robert Kyd, who persuaded the EIC to fund a Calcutta Botanic Garden specifically to breed and test drought-resistant crops .91 In 1808 Alexander Beatson was appointed Gov- ernor of St. Helena, where his programmes to plant trees and prevent soil erosion became well known through his own publications, particularly the Tracts on St. Helena (1816).92 Knowledge of this activity and the improve- ments made by Beatson's programmes to the hydrological state of the island became important when the foundations were being laid for forest protection in India during the late 1840s.93 views, see E.

This infrastructure relied not only on the diverse medical and botanical skills of the surgeons but on their high level of university education and the considerable social status conferred by the possession of medical knowledge in a disease-ridden tropical environment. In Mauritius, in a similar fashion, the ascendancy of the scientific lobby and its success in putting its preferred policies into operation was based primarily on the ability to demonstrate convincingly that uncontrolled deforestation might threaten the security of the state itself. The high status afforded to science by the French Physiocratic interest in government facilitated this development. On a much larger scale, but much more slowly, the views and influence of India's medical elite eventually acquires a similarly high status. Only gradu- ally did this scientific lobby come to concern itself with the effects of forest clearance. However, when the medical surgeons did finally come to define deforestation as a matter requiring serious policy initiatives and an expansion in the role of the state, their opinions carried considerable weight. This was partly due to the long history of the medical service's consultancy to the state on all matters relating to health, water supply, scientific botany, and forest resources. The tours of Dr. A. P. Hove in the Bombay presidency (1787-88) were an early exemplar of the performance of this consultancy role.94 More- over, as early as 1778 the Company had begun to employ eminent surgeon- botanists, such as J. G. Koenig, Patrick Russell, and William Roxburgh in official capacities as naturalists, with the active encouragement, after 1784, of Sir Joseph Banks, the president of the Royal Society.95 The subsequent sys- tematic development of links between the EIC medical service and the scien- tific and botanical establishment in Britain served to reinforce the authority of the surgeons as environmental commentators. By 1830 the vast majority of the 800 Company surgeons in India were Scottish.96 Many had been trained in botany by Professors John Hope in Edinburgh and William Hooker in Glasgow, both keen advocates of rigorous field observation, holistic approaches to nature, and tree-planting pro- 94 A.

As early as the 1820s some of the surgeons lobbied heavily against the deforestation taking place during that decade and argued in favour of plantation programmes. Nathaniel Wallich, the director of the Calcutta Botanic Garden, was pre-eminent among these early campaigners. "Unless speedy provision is made," he stated to a parliamentary committee in 1831, "for the renewal of timber, we shall, within a very short time, find a most painful falling off. I should say it is quite time that means should be resorted to, to preserve the forests that are remaining, and new plantations should be made."98 In spite of these early efforts, a direct connection between decline in forest area and apparent regional increases in desiccation in India was not put forward as an argument for controlling deforestation until the end of the 1830s. This delay can be partly attributed to a lack of evidence about rates of deforestation in India as a whole. Even so, throughout the 1820s and 1830s anxieties about deforestation were already frequently expressed. Bishop Heber, for instance, warned in 1824 that excessive deforestation, of the kind he had observed in the Siwalik foothills, might lead to a more general aridity.99 A second reason for the delay may have been the paucity of articles in sufficiently authoritative technical publications on the links between defor- estation and climate, despite the EIC's warning about desiccation to the St. Helena government as early as 1794. 100 Moreover, at this stage Mauritius's experience was still not widely known. In both colonies the essential limita- tions of resources on an island undergoing visually apparent deforestation and soil erosion stimulated action as well as theorisation. In contrast, no compara- bly coherent or comprehensive evidence of the human environmental impact was available at a sub-continental scale in India until the mid-1830s. Conse- quently, a more convincing body of evidence collected on an all-India basis was still required, as well as a theoretical basis for adjudging the likely consequences of deforestation. When a widely accepted analysis of the pos- 97 See I. H. Burkill, Chapters in the History of Indian Botany (Calcutta, 1965). 98 N.

The most potent was the linkage of the concept that deforestation would cause serious streamflow and rainfall changes with a political awareness of the occurrence of famine in the late 1830s throughout India. But there were other contributory develop- ments. By the mid- 1830s, the medical service became increasingly concerned about the rise in the frequency of episodes of serious disease taking place in the rapidly expanding cities, especially in Calcutta, the political capital, in part because of an increasing medical interest in epidemiology and the con- nections between water supply and disease transmission, an interest articu- lated rather earlier in India than Britain. Anxieties about the state's responsibility in this field were increasingly raised in moral and practical terms. In 1836 Surgeon Ranald Martin produced a pioneering report (which considerably preceded the comparable efforts of Edwin Chadwick in Britain) on the need for public health measures and the universal provision of clean water in Calcutta. 101 He further proposed the production of a whole series of medico-topographical reports on India by the medical service. 102 In this way the ambit of urban public health concern became much more widespread to embrace the whole rural topography of India, extending con- cerns about the provision of water in cities to include villages in regions known to be subject to drought. In this way Surgeon Donald Butter, in his Topography of Awadh, drew attention to the connections between the growing aridity of India and that which had taken place historically elsewhere.'03 Significantly, Butter relied heavily for his insights on Joseph Boussingault's translation of Alexander von Humboldt's work.104 These translations had recently appeared in scientific journals read widely by Scottish surgeons in India. After 1839 Humboldt's arguments linking deforestation, increasing aridity, and temperature change on a global scale were widely quoted by the medical service in India in its increasingly determined efforts to elicit govern- ment controls on deforestation and as part of a wider campaign for public health reforms. Furthermore, the publication of the medico-topographical 101 R. Martin, The Sanzitary Condition of Calcutta (Calcutta, 1836). 102 See discussion of Martin's campaigns in D. G. Crawford, A Historv of the Indian Medical Service, vol. 2, ch. 2. Further medico-topographical reports were compiled for Dacca (1840), Kumaon (1840), Jessore (1837), Assam (1837), Sora (1839). 103 D.

Ini- tially the Presidency governments, heeding the advice of the Revenue ser- vices, which stood to gain from agricultural clearance more than forest conser- vation, had ignored such warnings, particularly those of the early 1830s which had originated principally with the Rajah of Nilumbur in Malabar. The famines of 1838-39 finally put paid to this attitude, and government officials began to worry about the social instability which might result from famines exacerbated by deforestation. This fear was only distantly related to much less pervasive concerns about possible timber shortages.'06 During the 1840s, such concerns were considerably sharpened by a spreading awareness of the severity of Ireland's famine. Faced by this situation, the governments of the Bombay and Madras Presidencies began quite deliberately to seek relevant technical expertise, giving Company surgeons the opportunity to put them- selves forward as expert technical arbiters, a role that some surgeons readily accepted. In the Bombay Presidency, Dr. Alexander Gibson had already lobbied the government extensively on the subject of deforestation. In Madras, Assistant- Surgeon Edward Balfour had also started, by 1839, to try to persuade the authorities, on his own initiative, of the need for conservation. 107 However, Gibson's thinking initially carried the most weight, principally because he had already acquired a high reputation while a Vaccinator in Khandeish during the 1830s. 108 Furthermore, he had even received gold medals from the Company in recognition of his achievements in pharmacological and epidemiological research. In 1838 Gibson was appointed Superintendent of the Botanic Gar- den at Dapoorie, near Poona, a position carrying an equivalent weight to the post of Superintendent of the Calcutta Botanic Garden. This appointment meant that he became the obvious source of expertise for the Bombay govern- ment in 1839 on forest matters. During a series of subsequent government- sponsored tours through the Presidency, Gibson grew increasingly disturbed 105 E. P.

In March 1841, for example, he wrote to Joseph Hooker that the Deccan is more bare than Guzerat and the clefts of the Ghat mountains are the only situation where trees are to be found in any quantity and even they are disappearing fast under the increased demand for land for spade husbandry . . . they are too steep for the plough. It is a matter of regret for the naturalist [sic], perhaps also for the economist, that the woods are in such rapid progress of destruction.109 Together with two other surgeons, Hugh Cleghorn (stationed at Shimoga in Mysore) and Edward Balfour (stationed at Madras), Gibson was able to sys- tematically propagandise a forest conservation programme with the govern- ment. He backed it up consistently with the threat of famine and constantly inferred that the responsibility for future famines would be laid directly at the door of government, were it not to implement the conservationist prescrip- tions put forward by the medical service. The political dynamics of the transi- tion in the relations between scientists and colonial government which took place in India between about 1838 and 1847 (the latter being the date of the formal establishment of the Bombay Forest Department under the Conser- vatorship of Gibson) were complex. In practical terms and underlying the scenario of cataclysmic climatic change which the surgeons put forward, a fundamental debate opened up. In essence, this debate concerned the proper role of the state in environmental control and the extent of the legal right of government to assert control over forest tracts and the cutting of teak forest. The fact that state controls might pose a potentially decisive barrier to the activities of venture capital in the timber market, for which the state itself was the largest customer, was only admitted at a later date. In 1824 the state had definitively abnegated pre-colonial state forest con- trols on the basis of a private rights and laissez-faire orthodoxy favoured by Thomas Munro as Governor of Bombay."10 After 1837 the Company au- thorities changed course and sought instead to legitimate an increased degree of government intervention in forest control, arguing repeatedly that this new policy was supported by the powers supposedly exercised by pre-colonial Indian states over the forests of the Presidency. Alexander Gibson seemingly was largely responsible for the form of this initiative. He certainly foresaw the opposition to government controls from the new generation of largely indige- nous forest landowners and from the European interests benefiting from the lack of regulation of the timber trade between 1824 and 1838.

Consideration of this problem was stimulated by the developing conflict between the new environmental anx- ieties of the Company and the forest claims of the private landowners. The Bombay government, now increasingly reliant on the advice of the medical service and on that of Gibson in particular, moved steadily towards a solution involving the formal alienation of forests to Company reserves and the pro- gressive exclusion of private capital and shifting cultivation from the whole forest sector. This course of action soon brought Bombay into direct conflict with the wishes of the Supreme Government in Calcutta, which still favoured the protection of the rights of private landowners at all costs. Both sides tended to ignore the critically important needs of peasant users of the forest. They became a political football between government and commercial timber interests, especially in the neighbourhood of Bombay and later formed a core of popular resistance to British rule. I I I Although Gibson himself was well aware of the danger of alienating customary rights, his advocacy of peasant needs (specifically involving the setting aside of village forests) did not outlast his own personal influence with government or the imposition of the notori- ously unjust Forest Act of 1878. Indeed the new Conservator's own fears about the likely social consequences of restricting customary access to forests were vividly fulfilled in 1851 when he narrowly escaped death at the hands of a crowd of angry forest residents in Thana protesting the imposition of new forest regulations. 112 Between 1840 and 1846 the authorities in Calcutta continued to be most reluctant about funding the establishment of a formalised forest conservancy. They foresaw, quite correctly from hindsight, that such an establishment would imply a severe reduction in large short-term revenue income in favour of high expenditure on long-term and unquantifiable conservationist benefits. Gibson set himself the task of breaking this bureaucratic procrastination at the highest level of government by demonstrating that the penalty for further neglect of the forests could not be afforded politically or economically. Ini- tially he attempted to do this by emphasising the difficulties that deforestation was causing in supplying firewood for residents in urban areas. At one stage Gibson reported that in the city of Mangalore, "firewood, formerly so abun- dant, is now one of the chief items of expense to the poorer classes of people and is a deprivation severely felt by them."' 13 He had previously argued, in 1843, that "a careful examination of forests would disclose other productions of value . . . from a scientific point of view."" 14 Although the Bombay gov- 111 Richard Tucker, "Forest Management and Imperial Politics, Thana District, Bombay," Indian Economic and Social History Review, 16 (1979), 27. 112 This incident was recounted by Gibson in the Bombay Forest Report (1856) (Bombay: Government Printer), 13, par. 78. 113 Stebbing, Forests of India, 120. 114 Ibid., 111.</page><page sequence="28">CONSERVATION AND COLONIALISM 345 emnment was very ready to accept these ideas and was especially concerned about the firewood problem, none of the arguments were found convincing in Calcutta, where the Supreme Government continued to refuse to consider the cost of running a formal Conservancy. " 15 Significantly, arguments for conser- vation based either on local needs or long-term biological potential still proved to be politically ineffective in India itself in 1846. At this juncture Gibson decided, as a last resort, to use the "climatic threat" as an argument, not with the apparently hopelessly intractable Calcutta au- thorities but with the EIC Court of Directors itself. He was encouraged in this by a series of letters from Indian correspondents, including one in February 1846 from Mahabaleshwar, which stated the "common belief that with the removal of wood, the small streams . . . had dried up.""l 6 Gibson was in- clined to take the environmental knowledge of the indigenous population of the Western Ghats far more seriously than most non-medical officials. Thus the Mahabaleshwar letter of February 1846 made up his mind. By March 6, 1846, only a few days after receiving the letter, Gibson finished compiling a manuscript report on the destruction of forests in the Konkan in which he specifically mentioned the climatic and economic consequences of deforesta- tion. "A change of climate," he wrote, "is by no means limited to the mere district in which clearing has taken place, but its influence extends far in- land." Deforestation in the Ghats, in the headwards of rivers watering the fertile western coastal lowlands of the Presidency, would, Gibson felt, be clearly affected by such changes. Significantly, the Company attached a great importance to these regions at the time because of their extensive cotton- growing projects. The potentially formidable indirect disadvantages of defor- estation were therefore unmistakable. Gibson sent the finished report, dated March 6, 1846, directly to the Court of Directors in London in the form of a letter, thus bypassing the Bombay and Calcutta authorities altogether. He then used material contained within the report as the basis for a short but prominent paper published in the Transactions of the Bombay Medical and Physical Society, a journal with a considerable professional readership among officials in the medical service and in civil positions throughout India.117 The political significance of these unilateral actions cannot have been lost among officials in government circles in Calcutta. Gibson had appealed over the heads of both the Bombay authorities, more particularly the Government of India, directly to the Court of Directors on the one hand and the Indian scientific community on the other. This was an indicator, if one were needed, of the political weight which Gibson now felt that his professional scientific status conferred on him. Even so, the action was a gamble. However, it 115 ibid., 118. 116 MS Letter, written to Gibson from Mahabaleshwar (IOL V/27/560/107). 117 A. Gibson, "Report on Deforestation in South Conkan," Transactions of the Bombay Medical and Physical Society, 37 (1846), 11-22.</page><page sequence="29">346 RICHARD GROVE quickly paid off by forcing the decisive intervention of the Court, which compelled the Supreme Government in Calcutta to take serious heed of the advice of this new scientific service. Moreover, Gibson had backed the gam- ble by documenting his findings in detail among his own medical peers, in the specifically scientific forum of a medical journal. The Company was com- pelled before long to capitulate to the power of the medical lobby. Thus on December 17, 1846, the Government of India authorised "the employment of an establishment for the management of the forests under the Bombay Presi- dency, at a monthly charge of 295 Rupees." This enabled the Bombay Gov- ernment, on March 22, 1847, to appoint Gibson as Conservator of Forests, in addition to his duties as Superintendent of the Dapoorie Botanic Garden, and authorised him to "entertain the establishment which had been sanctioned by the Government of Bombay," for which he had long campaigned. However, the conversion of the East India Company authorities to the utility of the conservationist case actually went much further. A few months later, in July 1847, the Court of Directors issued a remarkable Despatch indicating an unprecedented official awareness of the global threat apparently posed by artificially induced climatic change. "The subject," the Despatch argued, is one having a strong practical bearing on the welfare of mankind and we are anxious to obtain extensive and accurate information in regard to it. We desire, therefore, that you will furnish us with any you may possess, and that you will institute inquiries in such quarters as may be likely to lead to the acquisition of particular facts bearing upon the question. It has been suggested that the circumstances of the district of Azimghur afford some illustration of the subject and we shall be glad to receive a correct report of any facts relating either to that district or others which may be calculated to throw light upon the subject of our enquiry. 118 By 1847, then, the supremacy of the medical service in its hold over government environmental policy had become well-established and was fur- ther institutionalised in Gibson's Superintendency of the Bombay Forest De- partment. This department was formed with the prime aim, not of securing a steady supply of timber (though this was still a pressing concern), but of inhibiting the whole range of environmental and social consequences which deforestation might cause. 119 The fear of these consequences, especially the fear of widespread climatic change, forced the colonial state to comply with a conservationist prescription. Although these environmental considerations were soon supplemented by other political and commercial claims, especially after the end of Company rule in 1857, the Hippocratic and Humboldtian 118 Despatch no. 21, Court of Directors, EIC, to Government of India, dated 7 July, 1847, quoted in Balfour papers, V/27/560/107.

If one seeks a particular historical turning point in the policies of the Company in this respect, the period from 1847 to 1850 is the most critical. The decisive turning point was probably reached when the Court of Direc- tors, as we have seen, followed up Gibson's report on the Konkan by cir- cularising a Despatch intended to try to establish direct evidence of deforesta- tion and rainfall change. The process culminated in January 1850 with a remarkable statement by Lord Dalhousie, made to the Agri-Horticultural So- ciety of India at Lahore. "During the last season," he wrote, I have traversed the plains of the Punjab. . . . There is one characteristic of the wide tract which could not fail to strike the least observant traveller. . .. I refer to the almost total absence of forest trees and of even fruit trees and of bushes leaving the whole territory unadorned by the foliage which is its natural cover, nor stocked with timber requisite for a thousand purposes in the everyday life of the people who dwell in it. .. This is a manifest and will shortly be felt to be an increasing evil unless some measures are taken to provide at present a remedy for the future . . . the Government should provide some means to that end and should bring them into operation without delay. . . . I feel strongly the urgent duty of endeavouring to give this country the clothing of forest trees from my knowledge of the well ascertained and beneficial effect which trees produce on the health and fertility of the tracts in which they are found. No power has been more clearly established than this salubrious and fertilising effect of foliage in an Indian climate. It has been the subject of much enquiry and demonstrated in every report submitted from different parts of India, many of which have passed through my hands, and one of which I forwarded to the local government in Punjab some time ago.... None of us can live to see the complete result of that which we now propose to commence. Few of us will gather the fruit where now we plant. But if we succeed in framing this design and advance it in some degree towards completion, we may at least enjoy the satisfaction of the feeling that we shall leave behind us an heritage for which posterity will be grateful. 120 This statement, an especially revealing one for Dalhousie to make, high- lighted the revolution in official perceptions that had occurred as a conse- quence of the medical service's determined lobbying. Indeed the Lahore memorandum represented, effectively, an unprecedented manifesto for forest protection and sustainable development. The notion of a monolithic state forest sector was clearly one that appealed to Dalhousie's undoubted interven- tionist and utilitarian ambitions. However, neither this nor the desire for a sustainable timber supply can account for the fundamental change in Com- pany forest policy continued under Dalhousie. Indeed, the roots of the Gover- nor-General's own interest in the forest question lie in his own very personal relationship with the increasingly powerful scientific, especially botanical, lobby. 120 "Minute by the most noble the Lord Dalhousie," read to the Agri-Horticultural Society of the Punjab on 20 February 1851, reproduced in G. Henderson, ed., Select Papers of the Agro- Horticultural Societv of the Punjab (Lahore: Lahore United Press, 1868).</page><page sequence="31">348 RICHARD GROVE As early as 1847 Dalhousie had come firmly under the influence of Joseph D. Hooker, who both accompanied him in his entourage on arriving in India in 1847 and constantly plied the Govemor-General with letters on the subject of forest conservation. 121 Hooker's main concern in India was to conduct a series of botanical surveys in the Himalayas. Forest conservation was an important secondary interest. He had, however, been firmly convinced since 1842 of a direct relationship between forest cover and rainfall incidence, mainly through his field observations on St. Helena and through his studies of the beneficial effect of Governor Alexander Beatson's plantations on the island hydrology. Hooker firmly believed, therefore, that afforestation and increased rainfall were closely linked. By 1850 Dalhousie had also become demonstrably convinced of the same phenomena, both through Hooker's in- fluence and by reading reports submitted by Edward Balfour and his col- leagues in the Madras government. Both in this respect, as well as in his voluminous correspondence with members of the medical service in India, Hooker had performed a decisive and persuasive part. Despite the significance of the interaction between Dalhousie and Joseph Hooker, a distinctive model of colonial forest conservancy had, in fact, al- ready been developed in Sind. This model was based firmly on an indigenous system, from which the installed colonial forestry system differed little in detail. Indeed the annexation of Sind by Sir Charles Napier had first provided an opportunity to set up an embryonic forest administration based directly upon the infrastructure of shikargarhs (forest and game reserves), which had been steadily built up along the Indus Valley by the Amirs of Sind since the 1750s. The shikargarhs were very extensive and served a multiplicity of state needs, including the widespread provision of a supply of firewood, for which the peasant population were required to pay heavily. The indigenous develop- ment of the shikargarhs in Sind and their influence on later colonial policy indicate that conventional historical interpretations of the primacy of Euro- pean colonial rule in environmental control and conservation need to be carefully re-examined, particularly in the context of contemporary thinking about the erosion of forests as pre-colonial common property. Thus the pre- colonial Sind forest system, like many others in India by the mid-eighteenth century, was by no means amenable to traditions of community or village use. Forestry was a subject which much interested Napier, and he had recom- mended the immediate assignment of an officer "with some knowledge of forestry" to gain as much information as possible about the system developed by the Amirs.122 The Amirs had, in fact, frequently carried out widespread 121 For detailed references to the correspondence on forest conservation carried on between Dalhousie and Hooker, see L.

After the annexation of Sind, these measures were deliberately relaxed by Napier to elicit a degree of popular support for the new government.123 Alongside these examples of both indigenous and scientifically reasoned strategies for forest protection, Dalhousie was soon provided with the expert advice of another member of the medical service, Surgeon John McClelland, an ardent enthusiast of natural history and an advocate of rare plant preserva- tion, in a survey of forests in Burma. This survey served as a further stimulus for action by the Governor-General, since McClelland specifically advised a rigorous system of state control to save the rapidly disintegrating forests of Pegu from private timber merchants. 124 Although the formal structure of an all-India Forest Department was organised in 1865 specifically to exclude the activities of private capital from the forests, the colonial environmental debate, in which state forestry origi- nated had already been going on in Southern India for three decades, was dominated by the conservationist thinking of the surgeons appointed to super- intend the first two Presidency Conservancies in Bombay and Madras. The Madras Forest Department, established in 1856, was headed by Surgeon Hugh Cleghorn, who had earlier agitated with Alexander Gibson for conser- vation measures to be taken during the 1840s.125 Cleghorn, later made first Inspector-General of Forests in India,'26 was, like Gibson, primarily a botanist and even an early environmental histo- rian.'27 Openly hostile to the kinds of development which promoted forest destruction, he campaigned against many of the contemporary plans for rail- way development in Southern India. In 1866 he also spoke out directly against the uncontrolled entry of plantation capital into the Nilgiris and Coorg, con- sistently claiming that the activities of European planters were far more de- structive than the long-established shifting koomri cultivators. 128 These kinds of opinions, not uncommon with some of the Scottish surgeons of the time, 123 Accounts of pre-colonial evictions and fuelwood fees are in E.

Burkill, Chapters in the Historv of Botany in India, 155. 125 Both of the new Presidency's Forestry Departments were run according to management methods based on the Sindhi, French, and Scottish models with which their medical founders were familiar. Additionally, Hugh Cleghorn was particularly interested in the history of Venetian attempts to control deforestation and soil erosion. In contrast the introduction of German forestry concepts constituted a much later development, and it was not until after 1878 that they were widely applied in India. 126 The appointment was made jointly with Dietrich Brandis, a German botanist. 127 An account of Cleghorn's activities in the early years of the Madras Forest Department is in H. Cleghorn's The Forests and Gardens of South India (Edinburgh, 1861). 128 Cleghorn, in "Discussion," following on the presentation of a paper by George Bidie, "On the Effects of Forest Destruction in Coorg," Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society (1869), 74-75.</page><page sequence="33">350 RICHARD GROVE marked by their anti-English flavour. Indeed, there are strong reasons for understanding the Scottish medical enthusiasm for protecting forests not only as a consequence of their enthusiasm for scientific natural history but as a surrogate for a far more direct kind of critique of English attitudes to India and even of English attitudes towards the Scots at home. The public basis of Cleghorn's environmentalism, however, was based primarily on a fear of the climatic and physical effects of tropical deforestation as part of a wider global problem. These fears are articulated both in his report to the British Associa- tion for the Advancement of Science in 1851, which was probably the first report in a scientific forum to warn of environmental degradation on a global scale, and in his later books and articles on the development of tropical forest protection. 129 CONCLUSION An examination of the motivations underlying the emergence of environmen- talism and conservation policies in the colonial context points to a heterodox legacy of Utopian, Physiocratic, and Hippocratic philosophical elements rep- resented in the discourses of an influential minority of scientists. These men were distinctively empowered by virtue of the high status assigned to science by the colonial state, and their environmental preoccupations were closely connected to a variety of agendas of social reform. In surveying the whole colonial context of conservation one needs to ask exactly why the colonial state was prepared to accept the highly unorthodox prescriptions of the early conservation lobbyists and, in particular, to accept their view of the need to subjugate short-term economic benefits to nebulous long-term interests. To date, most accounts of the early history of colonial forestry have explained colonial conservationism as a rationalisation for intensifying the direct exploi- tation of erstwhile "common property resources" to serve the needs of the colonial state and the metropole. As we have seen, such explanations can now be perceived as insufficient. Much of the early colonial conservationism was, in fact, directly related to a growing awareness that western processes for economic development were inherently destructive to the environment. It also becomes appropriate to re-emphasise the political significance of the basic insecurity of the early colonial state faced with the risks of a little-understood tropical environment. The ecological changes brought about by the forces of western capitalist development apparently threatened the very existence of the state itself. Faced by the threat of famine and social unrest, the state became 129 H. Cleghorn, F. Royle, R. Baird-Smith and R.

This may help us to explain how conservation as a state response to ecological crisis emerged first at an economic periphery rather than at the metropolitan centre. It was, in fact, precisely the insecurity of the state at the colonial periphery which allowed a sensitivity to the dangers of ecological change to develop so precociously. In writing environmental history and in reconstructing the histo- ry of environmentalism we will need, perhaps, to pay more attention in the future to the fundamentally innovative role of the colonial periphery in terms of its relations with the metropolitan centre. Such a priority, largely dismissed by historians hitherto, would require a radical re-assessment both of the history of conservation and of the state's role in the development of western environmental concern.</page></plain_text>
