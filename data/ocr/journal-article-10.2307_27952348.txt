<plain_text><page sequence="1">Our Mathematical Universe* By H. G. Ayre Western Illinois State Teachers College, Macomb, Illinois We are living in a wonderful civiliza tion, the greatest of all ages. The great learning and culture of the Greeks did not possess the dynamic characteristics of our twentieth century. The Roman civiliza tion in all its pomp and splendor had no concept of our scientific age with its rapid transportation, communication, factories, great cities, and modern skyscrapers. The purple robed nobility of the middle ages, attended by scores of servants, knew nothing of our modern conveniences. The ancient kings ruled over vast domains and had great power and wealth, but there were no electric lights, no toasters, no sweepers, and no electric washing ma chines. Telephone, telegraph, and radio were unknown. Our age is spoken of as the scientific age, but probably it would be more nearly correct to call it the golden age of mathematics, for mathematics is the foundation of all science. Let us fancy a picture?one so weird and ghastly that its existence as a reality would destroy the very civilization which we enjoy. Let us imagine that when we awaken tomorrow morning that there has disappeared from the earth all books on mathematics, all records pertaining to mathematics, every mathematical sym bol, and every computing and recording machine. In the wake of such a catas trophe our loud speaker would be silent, the telephone would have lost its number, we could not describe the location of our homes in the city and the thousands of books in our libraries would have lost their identity. All forms of measurement?fine precision instruments, yard sticks, speed ometers, electric meters, clocks, and cal endars?would vanish. All building would cease; all business shut down; the wheels * Radio address delivered over station WTAD, Quincy, Illinois, 2:30 p.m., June 1, 1939. of industry come to a standstill. Banks, exchanges, and stock markets would be no more, aviation would be paralyzed, and ships at sea would be hopelessly lost, be cause all of these things owe their exist ence to mathematics.1 We could continue this ridiculous pic ture, but it probably has already revealed the universality of the role of mathe matics in the development of a civiliza tion. In 66 a.D. a great light "hung over Jerusalem in the figure of a sword" and foretold the destruction of the city. One thousand years later a strange star ap peared just before the conquest of Eng land. In 1682 a bright comet was seen. Halley computed its orbit and behold, its path was an ellipse; therefore, had it been here before??Yes! Records revealed that in 1607 Kepler had mapped exactly the same orbit. What about earlier records? Yes, history gave earlier appearances. It appears probable that the strange omen that gave warning of the destruction of Jerusalem and the conquest of England was Halley's comet. The great mathemati cian Clairaut found that it would continue to appear once every seventy-five years. Many of you remember that astronomers knew the exact time and place of its ap pearance in 1910. The comet is now on a long journey, but the exact hour when some of you will see it in 1985 is known. A system of mathematics is the body of undefined elements, definitions, assump tions, and derived conclusions. The funda mental bonds of mathematics are number and form. Number implies integers, frac tions, rational, and irrational numbers, and real and imaginary numbers. The relation of number to civilization proves 1 D. E. Smith, The Poetry of Mathematics and Other Essays (New York: Scripta Mathe matica Library, 1934), pp. 16-17. 356</page><page sequence="2">OUR MATHEMATICAL UNIVERSE 357 that man is naturally mathematical and he can't help it. Mathematics is the one universal language; it is a part of civiliza tion. The early Egyptians developed enough mathematics to establish a cal endar. It seems almost certain that the development of mathematics antedates the origin of the known languages. Furthermore, there is some evidence that certain of the lower forms of life pos sess a kind of number sense. However, this peculiar faculty of number sense of the lower stages of development should not be confused with the higher mental proc ess of counting. Man alone has mastered the higher processes so essential to exact thought, communication, and co-opera tive living. When we consider form, the second of the fundamental bonds of mathematics, it is seen that in all plant and animal life there is a predominance of symmetry. An instinct of form is shown by some insects. It has been proved that the honey-bee encloses a maximum of space with a mini mum of wax.2 The numerous geometric forms in nature?the snowflake, crystal forms in minerals, the ammonite with the mathematically constructed spiral, the catenary in the spider web, the spiral nebulae, shape and motion of heavenly bodies?convinces one that nature is not haphazard or chaotic but governed by law and order. Whether on the earth or in the stars we find the same chemical ele ments, the same geometric forms, and the same fundamental laws. All forms of growth, governed by con stant environmental conditions, are repre sented by the same growth curve. The arrangement of leaves on the stem of a plant is represented by mathematical law. The divergence between leaves is shown by well-known number series. When the branch of a plant divides into smaller branches, it loses an energy which is im parted to the new branch. This relation ship in energy is expressed by a formula involving trigonometry. Fechner aston ished psychologists by showing that sensa tion and excitation in vision is described by mathematical law involving loga rithms.3 Scientists tell us that the motion of the planets is like the action within an atom where there is the nucleus surrounded by electrons moving about as satellites, only the atoms are infinitely small. But the laws are the same. It is demonstrated everywhere that number has certain properties, geometric figures have definite relationships, the physical universe is governed by mathematical laws and our mathematical systems based on number and form are significantly connected with our physical universe. Man no longer interprets the universe in anthropomorphic or mechanistic con cepts. It now appears that nature is inter preted through concepts of pure mathe matics.4 The pure mathematician is interested in creating a mathematical system that has a minimum dependence on experience. His work is sufficient unto itself?it is self satisfying. Like the artist and musician he creates to satisfy an inner compulsion. He has little thought of elaborating a theory of utilitarian value. However, it is almost invariably true that these theoreti cal creations prove to be the means pf ex plaining physical phenomena. The Greeks studied regular polygons. This lead to much of the geometry which enables the astronomer to explain the mo tions of the planets. They developed the theory of conic sections. Archimedes used principles of conies when he focused the sun's rays on the ships in the harbor at Syracuse and set them on fire. The head lights of every automobile use the theory of conies developed by the early Greeks, 2 George Wolff, "Mathematics as Related to Other Great Fields of Knowledge," Eleventh Yearbook, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (New York: Bureau of Publica tions, Teachers College, Columbia University, 1936), p. 225. 8 Ibid., pp. 221-222. 4 Sir James Jeans, The Mysterious Universe (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1931), p. 143.</page><page sequence="3">358 THE MATHEMATICS TEACHER and an auditorium with good acoustic properties is built on a parabolic curve, so that the sound rays originating at a focal point on the stage are reflected from the walls in parallel rays. Early in the sixteenth century Coperni cus proposed the theory of a universe with the sun as a center. A hundred years later Kepler found that if circular orbits were assumed there was a discrepancy in the mathematics. However, he was familiar with the Greek's theory of conic sections and made the startling discovery that the paths of the planets are ellipses with the sun at one focus. Sir Isaac Newton and others formulated the law of universal gravitation and invented the calculus, a most powerful instrument for explaining the physical universe. These were the tools of Halley and Clairaut in determin ing the facts about Halley's comet. For several centuries mathematicians tried to prove, or disprove, Euclid's parallel axiom. It was a little over a hun dred years ago that this problem was settled by the creation of non-Euclidean geometry, which proved to be one of the most momentus events in the creation of abstract thought. Later this system of thought was further developed by creating a calculus based on the same assumptions. It was thought that this new mathematics was absolutely innocent of any practical applications, because its axioms seemed to contradict man's experiences in the physi cal universe. However, from 1906 to 1915 when the theory of relativity was being developed it was found that this new sys tem of mathematics made clear new con cepts of the physical world. Similarly, the recent theory of infinite classes seems to contradict the axioms of Euclid, but it has been found to agree with experience and furnish a medium of precise concepts of time and space. Everyone listening to this broadcast knows that the use of copper wire is essen tial for the construction of his radio set, but many do not realize that the use of differential equations is equally as im portant. The whole wireless and radio in dustry of today had its inception in a few pages of mathematical analysis created by James Clerk Maxwell, who died about 60 years ago. Maxwell's electro-magnetic equations gave a very significant con nection between light, sound, and heat, and led to the discovery of radio and wire less. The physical universe is not governed by chance or explained by superstition. It is governed by law and order and its ex planation is inextricably bound by mathe matical formulas. Le verrier recognized this fact when in 1845 he undertook to account for the strange behavior of the planet Uranus. The orbit of Uranus had been cal culated, but within a certain region she would leave her course. What could be the cause? No one knew. Leverrier connected this behavior with the laws of gravitation. Could there be another planet causing this disturbance? Observations were taken, computations made, results checked, more computations and more checking of results until finally Leverrier was sure he had found the exact spot in the sky where the planet was located. He wrote to his friend in the observatory at Berlin to set his telescope at a certain place in the sky and be the first to see a planet never before seen by mankind. The astronomer tried it out that night, and to his great delight and amazement his eyes were the first to greet the stranger, but he was very cau tious and waited with anxiety and en thusiasm until the next night to make a check and found there was no mistake and the discovery of Neptune was announced to the world. After this discovery it was found that Uranus had further disturbances that were unaccounted for. The fascinating story continues, and nine years ago at Flagstaff, Arizona, was discovered the planet Pluto. But yet there remains the question to challenge the best intellects in mathematics and astronomy?is there an other planet beyond Pluto? Perhaps so. The depth of the future holds the answer.</page><page sequence="4">OUR MATHEMATICAL UNIVERSE 359 Centuries ago the shepherd on the hill side of Judea looked into the skies and thought the stars were mere points of light all the same distance of a few miles away. He was so impressed by the spec tacle that he exclaimed "The heavens de clare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork." In civilization's debt to mathematics man sees countless bodies of vast magnitude, some as near as four light-years, then, star cities far into boundless space separated by millions of light-years, all governed by order, obeying every traffic signal of the vaulted skies, while traveling at unbelievable speeds. Yet, the mind that encompasses these things is only finite and cannot understand the infinite plan of the Great Architect. One can only gaze with wonder that deepens into awe and admiration as he joins the Psalmist in his words, "When I consider the heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained, what is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man that thou visiteth him?" Evolution of the Number Concept To glance at a single phase of the matter, what can be found in the whole history of thought more humanistically edifying than the story of the evolution of the number concept, from the rudest beginnings in the primitive mind, long before men had learned even the first steps in the process of counting, to the great number-creations of the modern world? The concepts of Integers and Fractions, of Cardinals and Ordinals, of Positives and Negatives, of Rationale and Irrationals, of Reals and Imaginarles, of Algebraic and Transcendental, of Finite and Infinites, these great concepts viewed with the occasions of their rise, with their struggles for existence, their ultimate triumphs over stubborn opposition, their persistent hardy growth through the centuries, their countless diversifications and subtle refinements, the infinite network of their inter relations and their manifold, always increasing, practical and theoretical uses and applications, afford a series of scenes that, for any one who has once contemplated them, constitute a truly, unforgettable, and inspiring panorama of the march of mind.?

More Substantial Mathematics Until something more substantial than has just been exhibited, both practical and spiritual, is shown the non-mathematical public as a justification for its continued support of mathematics and mathematicians, both the subject and its cultivators will have only themselves to thank if our immediate successors exterminate both.?E.
