<plain_text><page sequence="1">BROWNE AND KING, COLLINS AND BERKELEY: AGNOSTICISM OR ANTHROPOMORPHISM? I Ν 1696 was published John Toland's Christianity not Mysterious. It was a direct negation of the idea of mystery in religion. Toland's position is summed up in his statement that 'we hold that reason is the foundation of all certitude . . . that nothing reveal'd, whether as to its manner or its existence, is more exempted from its disquisitions than the ordinary phenomena of nature . . . that there is nothing in the Gospel contrary to reason nor above it, and ... no Christian doctrine can properly be called a mystery'.1 Toland maintained that he based his position on the epistemology of Locke. '1 distinguish', he wrote, 'after an excellent modern philosopher, the nominal from the real essence of a thing.'2 'Nothing is a mystery because we know not its essence ... so that the Divine Being himself cannot with more reason be accounted more mysterious in this respect than the most con temptible of His creatures.'3 Anthony Collins, in his The Use of Reason in in Propositions, the Evidence whereof depends on Human Testimony of 1707, defended much the same point of view. He denied the possibility of truths above reason, or at any rate that such 'truths' could become part of a religious creed. According to him 'all propositions consider'd as objects of assent and dissent are adequately divided into propositions agreeable or contrary to reason, and there remains no third idea under which to rank them'.4 By 'agreeable to reason' it was clear from his book that he meant 'fully comprehensible by reason'. The three Persons of the Trinity were, therefore, either called 'Persons' by extrinsic denomination,5 there being only one God, not really distinguished by personal relations in any sense, or, he seemed to concede, at this stage in his career, the 'Persons' corresponded to some ideas in the mind of God, of the meaning of which we have no more idea than we have of the meanings of words in a foreign language.6 The propositions we frame, he held, 'stand for known ideas, or ideas that we are capable of forming; for if they stand for ideas that we know not, or want faculties to perceive, there are then no objects for the mind to exert itself upon'.7 This seems 1 John Toland, Christianity not Mysterious (London, 1696), p. 6. 2 Ibid., p. 83. 3 Ibid., p. 89. 4 A.

'The whole sum and substance of the Deists' and Freethinkers' reasoning may be resolved into this. You must grant, say they, that we can neither know nor believe anything but what we have some idea or conception of; and you must grant likewise that the Christian mysteries are incomprehensible, that is, that we have no idea at all of them; therefore we can neither know nor believe them.'2 The opponents of the Deists replied by the use of analogy. John Witty, one of the ablest of the critics of Collins, neatly turned the tables on him by the use of Locke's theory on real essences. If, he argued, we can frame propositions about real essences, at least to the extent of asserting their existence, even though we have no ideas about them at all, except as the unknown substrata of the sensible accidents which we can perceive, may we not legitimately frame propositions about the mysteries of Christianity ?ג Moreover, he said, by analogy, we can have some knowledge of these mysteries, just as a blind man can be taught something about sight, by analogy with his other sense perceptions, even though he has no visual sense perception at all.4 Peter Browne had used the same argument against Toland. By analogy with the sense of touch, he said, a blind man can learn that 'without the help of his stick' he could by sight 'know everything that lay before him', that 'by the help of this he shou'd there discern at once, a vast and almost infinite number of very pleasant bodies'. 'He wou'd think it [sight] very like feeling and perhaps call it by that name .. . and . . . wou'd conclude that those bodies he heard of must needs be wondrous soft and smooth.' The point he was making is a very valid one. One can learn a good deal by analogy. However, he had begun his argument with a statement that perhaps led him into trouble with George Berkeley. 'It is plain, that tho' we may be said to have ideas of God &amp; Divine things, yet they are not immediate or proper ones, but a sort of composition we make up from our ideas of worldly objects, which at the utmost amounts to no more than a type or figure, by which something in another world is signified, of which we have no more idea than a blind man hath of light.'

O'HIGGINS exposition of Browne's own epistemology. His theory of knowledge is of some considerable importance in evaluating his controversy with Berkeley, a quarrel in which Berkeley was to accuse Browne of being an agnostic and Browne to allege that Berkeley took an anthropo morphic view of God and the Divine attributes. In 1709 William King, Archbishop of Dublin, became almost acci dentally involved in the dispute. In a sermon entitled Divine Predestina tiontion and Foreknowledge, consistent ■with the Freedom of Man's Will1 he used the idea of analogy in an attempt to solve the problem with which the sermon dealt. There can be no doubt that in this attempt the Arch bishop retreated into agnosticism. As Browne himself pointed out he confused metaphor or extrinsic and intrinsic analogy.2 Anthony Collins, perhaps remembering Witty's reply to his Use of Reason, pounced on King. Collins was frankly anthropomorphic but he was equally able to demonstrate King's apparent agnosticism. King spoke of the appearance of design in the Universe. He did not, however, exactly say that this demonstrates the attribute of wisdom in God. He wrote, because we do not know what His faculties are in themselves, we give them the name of those powers, that we find would be necessary for us to produce such effects and call them wisdom, understanding and fore knowledge; but at the same time we cannot but be sensible that they are of a nature altogether different from ours and that we have no direct and proper notion or conception of them; only we are sure that they have effects like unto those, that do proceed from wisdom, understanding and foreknowledge in us.3 He went on to discuss the genuine use of metaphor in scripture—the ascribing of hands, eyes, and feet to God. But he went further and confused metaphor and intrinsic analogy. He said, 'and as the nature and passions of men are thus by analogy and comparison ascribed to God ... so in the same manner and by the same condescension to the weakness of our capacities, we find the powers and operations of our minds ascribed to Him'.4 He did say 'there is a power in God . .. equivalent to knowledge and understanding'. But he continued, It does not follow from hence, that any of these are more properly or literally in God after the manner, that they are in us, than hands and eyes, 1 (Dublin, 1709). 2 Intrinsic analogy is that in which there is a real foundation in the analogy for the reality which it describes. In theology it would be metaphor to speak of the hand of God but intrinsic analogy to compare his wisdom with that of man. For Browne's criticism cf. The Procedure, pp. 13 f. 3 W. King, Divine Predestination and Foreknowledge, consistent with the Free dorn of Man's Will (Dublin, 1709), pp. 6, 7. * Ibid., pp. 7, 8.</page><page sequence="4">AGNOSTICISM OR ANTHROPOMORPHISM 91 than mercy, love or hatred are, but on the contrary, we must acknowledge that those things which we call by these names, when attributed to God, are of so very different a nature from what they are in us . . . that in reality there is no more likeness between them, than between our hand and God's power.1 He said that we should consider the situation to be as if God had what we call foreknowledge and a fixed design. 'When God is said to pre determine and fore-ordain all things according to the counsel of His will, the importance of this expression is, that all things depend as much on God, as if He had settled them according to a certain scheme and design.'2 Analogy, he said, was not intended to teach us what God is, or anything about his nature, but how we should live our lives in accor dance with his wishes; 'to teach and oblige us to living reasonably, to perform our duties to God, our neighbours and our selves'.3 In this way he aimed at solving the problem of the reconciliation of man's free will and divine foreknowledge. God's foreknowledge and pre determination are not, he said, of the same nature as ours. And he used much the same words as Browne. 'We have no proper notion of them any more than a man born blind has of sight and colours and therefore ... we ought no more to pretend to determine what is consistent or is not consistent with them, than a blind man ought to determine, from what he hears or feels, to what objects the sense of seeing reaches.'4 It is true that any solution of the problem must lie in the different nature of God's knowledge and man's but King had fallen into genuine agnosticism and this in spite of the fact that towards the end of his ser mon he seemed to execute a partial retreat in the direction of something that bore some resemblance to the Scholastic doctrine of analogy. Here he said that wisdom and prudence are ascribed to God by proportion and analogy; that these perfections are not of the same nature but analogous to ours; that they 'yield Him all the advantages that these could give Him if He had them'; that they are infinitely superior to our perfections and called by the same names 'because we do not know what they are in themselves, but only see their effects in the world, which are such as might be expected from the most consummated reason, under standing and virtue'.5 In spite of the reference to analogy there is still an agnostic flavour about the passage. God is only called wise and prudent because we have no better words to hand and the infusion of a non-agnostic idea of analogy is more than counterbalanced by the agnosticism of the rest of the sermon. 1 Ibid., pp. 9, ίο. 2 Ibid., p. 11. 3 Ibid., p. 19· * Ibid., pp. 11, 12. 5 Ibid., p. 46.</page><page sequence="5">92 J. O'HIGGINS One might well question whether King really was an agnostic. It would seem that in his haste to solve one problem he slipped into agnosticism. As Berkeley caustically remarked this was certainly 'cutting knots and not untying them'.1 Anthony Collins, as has been suggested, perhaps mindful of John Witty's reply to his Essay on the Use of Reason, and certainly anxious to defend the position which he took up in that work, was quick to reply to King's sermon. In a brief pamphlet, A Vindication of the Divine Attri butes,butes, he denied the value of analogy as a means of adding to our know ledge, convicted King of being an agnostic, and, at the same time, demonstrated his own anthropomorphism. He made great play of King's saying that wisdom and similar attributes are no more in God than hands and eyes are and wrote, The idea I have given of his Grace's meaning, may perhaps shock the reader, who has always imagin'd, that the Scripture only spoke ana logically when it attributed parts and passions to God; but that when it gave Him such moral attributes as Wisdom, Justice and Goodness, and such natural attributes as will and foreknowledge, it was with design that we should take them to be really in God as they are in us, and of the same kind, only that He has them in the highest degree possible.2 There was a more powerful adversary of King and, later, of Browne, than Anthony Collins. George Berkeley was disturbed by King's sermon. In 1710 he wrote to Sir John Percival, I met with some who, supporting themselves on the authority of the Archbishop of Dublin's sermon concerning the prescience of God, denied there was any more wisdom, goodness or understanding in God than there were feet or hands, but that all are to be taken in a figurative sense; whereupon I consulted the sermon and to my surprise found His Grace asserting that strange doctrine. 'Tis true he holds there is something in the divine nature analogous or equivalent to those attributes. But upon such principles I do not see how it is possible to demonstrate the existence of God: there being no argument that I know of for His existence, which does not prove Him at the same time to be an understanding, wise and benevolent being in the strict, literal, and proper meaning of those words.3 In 1728 Peter Browne published his Procedure, Extent and Limits of of the Human Understanding. Five years later Berkeley attacked both King and Browne in the Fourth Dialogue of his Alciphron. The attack is put into the mouth of the young freethinker Lysicles, quoting his 1 The Works of George Berkeley, edited by A. A. Luce and Τ. E. Jessop (London, etc., 1948- ), iii, Alciphron, p. 164. 2 A. Collins, A Vindication of the Divine Attributes (London, 1710), p. 10. 3 Works, viii, p. 32, Berkeley to Percival, 1 Mar. 1710.</page><page sequence="6">AGNOSTICISM OR ANTHROPOMORPHISM 93 much-admired friend Diagoras. In Alciphron the name Diagoras is that which is usually associated with Collins and here it is plain that Berkeley was writing with the arguments of Collins's Vindication in mind. Clearly not everything said by the freethinkers Alciphron and Lysicles can be taken as representing Berkeley's own opinion but it would seem that he considered not only that King and Browne—the passage in Alciphron refers to 'divines', in the plural—had left themselves open to Lysicles' attack, but that he also agreed with the conclusion that he considered the latter was drawing from their opinions. One thing, however, should be noted. Berkeley assumed that Collins was a defender of atheism, at least to the extent that he held that the unknown first cause was not a personal God. 'How are things reconciled with the divine attributes' Lysicles was made to ask When these attributes themselves are in every intelligible sense denied, and, consequently, the very notion of God taken away, and nothing left but the name without any meaning annexed to it? . . . Now we have granted to you that there is a God in this indefinite sense, I would fain see what use you can make of this concession. You cannot argue from unknown attributes, or, which is the same thing, from attributes in an unknown sense. . . . Since, therefore nothing can be inferred from such an account of God, about conscience, or worship, or religion, you may even make the best of it. And not to be singular, we will use the name too, and so at once there is an end of atheism.1 Collins, however, did believe in God; or, rather, he considered he could prove the existence of God. In writing, in the Vindication, of the divine attributes, he virtually gave a proof of God's existence that, though he would hardly realize it, was ultimately drawn from the five ways of Aquinas, and he held to a personal God; to a very anthro pomorphic God. This can be seen in the brief quotation already given from the Vindication. Collins's aim was to show the uselessness of analogy, the wrong-headedness of the Archbishop, and that Divine and human attributes are of the same kind. He did say 'according to His Grace's notions, it is impossible for him to prove the existence of God against atheists'.2 But he was not an atheist himself. Berkeley appre dated his arguments but misunderstood his intentions, though he plainly saw to what conclusions Collins's arguments could lead. This misinter pretation, however, did nothing to lessen the vigour of Berkeley's attack. The 'speculative divines' who, he said, 'taught that the words knowledge,knowledge, wisdom, goodness, and such-like, when spoken of the Deity must be understood in a quite different sense from what they signify 1 Works, iii, Alciphron, pp. 164, 165. 2 A Vindication, p. 12.</page><page sequence="7">94 J· O'HIGGINS in the vulgar acceptation, or from anything that we can form a notion of or conceive',1 in his opinion left the way open to atheism in the manner which he described. When Alciphron was published King was some four years dead. The passage on analogy with its clear reference to his sermon and Collins's reply, was directed more at King than at Browne, but Browne, quite correctly, took it as a reflection upon himself as well. He devoted nearly two hundred pages of his Divine Analogy to a reply to Berkeley. He counter-attacked. He accused Berkeley of anthropomorphism. He wrote 'the very thing we justly charge upon this author and others of his strain is, that according to them the attributes belong to God in a sense altogether absurd and unintelligible; that is as they express perfections the very same in kind with those that are either natural or acquired in us, only infinitely greater in degree; which is, in plain words, as they express the same with infinite human perfections'.2 This was a constant theme in his reply to Berkeley and one has to ask the question as to whether Berkeley really was anthropomorphic. A fairly recent writer, G. E. Sillem, in his George Berkeley and the Proofs for the Existence of God,God, has come to the conclusion that he was, though not because of the analogy passage in Alciphron but because of the nature of his proof of the existence of God. He writes of Berkeley's account of causality that 'it treats the causal activity of all spiritual beings as being of one uniform pattern and that of God in the Universe as being the same in kind as the activity of human persons . .. the only difference Berkeley would allow was that God acts on a much vaster scale than man'.3 There is, however, no doubt that Berkeley, like Browne, believed in analogy. His attack on King and Browne was not caused by any personal animosity. Alciphron was a reply to the Deists. Berkeley had Collins very much in mind. A long passage in the seventh dialogue deals with the latter's Philosophical Inquiry Inquiry concerning Human Liberty p a deterministic work. In his Theory of of Vision Vindicated Berkeley says that the author of A Discourse of FreethinkingFreethinking—Collins's most notorious book, published in London in 1713—'in like manner appears to insinuate his atheism from the differ ing notions of men concerning the nature and attributes of God, par ticularly from the opinion of our knowing God by analogy, as it hath been misunderstood and misinterpreted by some of late years. Such is the ill effect of untoward defences and explanations of our faith; and 1 Works, iii, Alciphron, pp. 163, 164. 2 P.

Without naming Browne he writes, If there be any modern well-meaning writer, who (perhaps from not having considered the fifth book of Euclid) writes much of analogy without understanding it, and thereby hath slipped his foot into this snare, I wish him to slip it back again, and, instead of causing scandal to good men and triumph to atheists, discreetly explain away his first sense, and return to speak of God and His attributes in the style of other Chris tians, allowing that knowledge and wisdom do, in the proper sense of the words, belong to God, and that we have some notion, though infinitely inadequate, of those divine attributes, yet still more than a man blind from birth can have of light and colours.1 The question as to whether God can have knowledge and wisdom in the proper sense of the words, is a key one in the controversy and it is bound up with the epistemological theories of Berkeley and Browne. It would seem arguable that the passage above quoted was not a reference to the Divine Analogy but to the Procedure. In a letter to Samuel Johnson, the American philosopher, of 4 April 1734, Berkeley wrote, 'As to the Bishop of Cork's book, and the other book you allude to to . .. they are both very little read or considered here'—London—'for which reason I have taken no public notice of them.' However, he con tinued, 'To answer objections already answered, and repeat the same things, is a needless as well as a disagreeable task.'2 He might, therefore, be referring to the Analogy. The passage in The Theory of Vision Vindi catedcated is a brief one, perhaps hardly to be considered as a 'public notice', or, at least, as a reply. However there has recently been published in Mind Mind an anonymous letter, originally printed in A Literary Journal of Dublin, in 1745, which eminent authorities have concluded was in fact written by Berkeley to Browne.3 If indeed it were it would be a private reply written by the former to the Bishop. If it is to be taken as denying the idea of analogy itself it cannot be by Berkeley. It is clear from Aid phronphron that he believed in analogy, but in analogy rightly explained. However, on four occasions in the letter the writer refers to Browne's theory as 'your method', 'your scheme', 'your new method', and 'yours' and at the end, when he says that if Browne can answer his queries he is a 'convert to analogy', the word 'analogy' is in italics. It can be argued therefore that it was Browne's theory of analogy and not analogy itself which was the object of attack and the authorship could remain with 1 Works, i, The Theory of Vision Vindicated, p. 254. 2 Works, viii, p. 236. 3 J.-P.

Jessop.</page><page sequence="9">96 J. O'HIGGINS Berkeley. The contents of the letter demand further and later considera tion. Browne has long been declared to have been a genuine agnostic. Sir Leslie Stephen takes it for granted.1 More recently Anders Jeffner in his Butler and Hume on Religion writes, 'To satisfy the religious criterion, Browne has instead'—'of a known relation of causality and similarity between God and the world'—'to assume that the relationship between God and the world is unknown. With this the similarity of meaning between words as predicates of God and in their ordinary sense likewise becomes unknown.'2 R. H. Hurlbutt says that Browne confuses 'metaphorical conception, a sort of imaginal construct and, second, analogical inference as a type of induction' and that, in his works, discussions and arguments about how we are able to conceive of God's attributes are not 'arguments or inferences at all—they are metaphors'.3 On the other hand, A. R. Winnett, in his life of Browne, has no doubt at all that Browne was not an agnostic. He says he 'is treading a knife edge between those who hold God to be unknowable and those who claim a direct and immediate knowledge of Him, and it is not surprising to find him leaning now to one side, now to the other side, between the two positions'.4 In the case of both Berkeley and Browne their theories of knowledge have to be taken into account. It does not follow that their religious beliefs about the knowledge of God must be deduced with rigid logic from their epistemologies, but, in the case of both, the latter have a very important bearing on those beliefs. Both writers claimed that they held the analogical knowledge of God. Each maintained that the other misinterpreted it. Each showed a wide acquaintance with the Scholastic philosophers. Berkeley quoted Aquinas and Suarez, criticized the pseudo-Dionysius, to whom Browne referred in his Divine Analogy with some approval, and finally came directly to his own exposition of the theory itself. In spite of Browne's saying that Berkeley's explanation was a 'specious declaiming against the received and genuine notion of analogy and the crying up of another of his own in opposition to it, which will appear most absurd and imaginary',5 Berkeley followed with remarkable closeness Thomas de Vio, Cardinal Cajetan's work De Nominum Analogia. Analogy, he said, is derived from a Greek word signifying 'similitude of propositions'. 1 L. Stephen, History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century (London, 1881), i, pp. 114 f. 22 A.

Winnett, Peter Browne (London, 1974), p. 161. 5 Divine Analogy, p. 374.</page><page sequence="10">AGNOSTICISM OR ANTHROPOMORPHISM 97 From this it has been taken in a looser sense 'to signify all similitude of relations or habitudes whatsoever'. 'Hence', he went on, the Schoolmen tell us there is analogy between intellect and sight; forasmuch as intellect is to the mind what sight is to the body, and that he who governs the State is analogous to him who steers a ship. Hence a prince is analogically styled a pilot, being to the State as a pilot is to his vessel. For the farther clearing of this point, it is to be observed that a twofold analogy is distinguished by the Schoolmen—metaphorical and proper. Of the first kind there are frequent instances in Holy Scripture, attri buting human parts and passions to God. When He is represented as having a finger, an eye, or an ear; when He is said to repent, to be angry, or grieved; everyone sees the analogy is merely metaphorical, because those parts and passions, taken in the proper signification, must in every degree necessarily, and from the formal nature of the thing, include imperfection. . . . But the case is different when wisdom and knowledge are attributed to God. Passions and senses, as such, imply defect; but in knowledge simply, or as such, there is no defect. Knowledge, therefore, in the proper formal meaning of the word, may be attributed to God proportionately, that is, preserving a proportion to the infinite nature of God. We may say, therefore, that as God is infinitely above man, so is the knowledge of God infinitely above the knowledge of man, and this is what Cajetan calls analogia proprie facta. And after this same analogy we must understand all those attributes to belong to the Deity which in themselves simply, and as such, denote perfection. We may, therefore, consistently with what hath been premised, affirm that all sorts of per fections which we can conceive in a finite spirit are in God, but without any of that alloy which is found in the creatures. This doctrine, therefore, of analogical perfections in God, or our knowing God by analogy, seems very much misunderstood and misapplied by those who would infer from thence that we cannot frame any direct or proper notion, though never so inadequate, of knowledge or wisdom, as they are in the Deity; or under stand any more of them than one born blind can of light and colours.1 This passage serves at the same time to bring out the central point of difference between Browne and Berkeley and to give a fairly accurate account—taken from Cajetan—of one version of the Scholastic doctrine of analogy, that of analogy of proportionality. It does, however, hide the fact that there was more than one exposition of the doctrine of analogy. St. Thomas Aquinas never gave any definitive expression of his opinion. His theory suffered changes during his lifetime. It was generally agreed that the divine qualities and human could not be univocal; and— as Berkeley said but Browne denied—that qualities which implied an imperfection in their definition, because, for example, of their essential association with matter, could only be metaphorically predicated of 1 Works, iii, Alciphron, pp. 169, 170. J.T.S. I Η</page><page sequence="11">98 J. O'HIGGINS God, but that those such as goodness and wisdom, which implied in their definition no such essential limiting imperfection could be predicated properly but analogically.1 On this point turned the whole controversy between Berkeley and Browne. Cajetan's De Nominum Analogia, section 110, makes precisely this point and Cajetan was an eminently respectable Scholastic philosopher. He wrote that God and creatures can have some predicate in common. One can take the notion of wisdom and separate from it by means of the intellect whatever is imperfect. From the fact that what is proper to wisdom, taken formally, implies perfection without any imperfection, the conclusion can be drawn that the character of wisdom in God is not entirely diverse nor entirely the same, but the same proportionally, because the similitude between God and creature is not univocal but analogous.2 In spite of Browne's repeated cries of outrage at Berkeley's using the words 'formal' and 'proper' in this context, the latter had respectable authority for his usage. Cajetan favoured analogy of proportionality, the analogy by which it is said that there is a relationship of similarity—though clearly not mathematical—between, for example, the relation between God and His wisdom and man and his. However there is a second form of analogy, that of attribution. This Cajetan declared to be not proper analogy but merely metaphorical. It is not a four-term analogy like that of propor tionality but three-term. Two things are said to be analogous to one another because of their relationship to a third. The homely example, taken from St. Thomas Aquinas, is that urine and medicine are said to be healthy because of their relationship to a healthy animal. This is not quite the same as the metaphorical relationship by which a meadow is said to be smiling because of a human parallelism. Urine is called 1 For the opinion of Scotus cf. F. Copleston, A History of Philosophy (Lon don, 1950), ii, pp. 500 f. Scotus held that the concepts of being, wisdom, etc., are univocal for God and man. This, holds Copleston, is not, in Scotus, simply a logical concept, i.e. simply a subjective construct, but one for which there is an objective foundation, 'provided that one does not mean to imply that there is anything in extramental reality which corresponds to the concept'. For example, Scotus would hold that being can be predicated both of God and man in that they are both not-nothing but not-nothing in very different ways. Scotus, there fore, was not anthropomorphic, though his theory left him with many problems. It might, for example, be questioned whether the common characteristics he perceived are sufficient to justify a declaration of univocity. Schoolmen such as Cajetan and Suarez did not agree with his theory. He proposed it to escape what he considered to be the danger of agnosticism. Neither Berkeley nor Browne mentioned Scotus by name. 2 Cajetan, The Analogy of Names etc. (from the translation by E. A. Bushin ski in collaboration with H. J. Koren, Duquesne University Press, Pittsburg, 1953), n. no.</page><page sequence="12">AGNOSTICISM OR ANTHROPOMORPHISM 99 healthy because it is a sign of health and medicine because it is a cause. Suarez, however, favoured analogy of attribution and said that there could be an intrinsic analogy of attribution and not simply an extrinsic or metaphorical one. Man, he said, has the perfection of wisdom because he is the image of God and therefore mirrors His perfections. His wisdom is analogous to that of God and, like Cajetan, he would say wisdom can properly be predicated of God and man, allowing for the fact that man's wisdom is created, limited, and of a different kind from that of God.1 The passage in question was cited by Berkeley. Here was another gap between Browne and the Schoolmen. It has been said that Suarez held that being is univocal to God and man but, on the contrary, he expressly and repeatedly denied such univocity,2 while in fact he reduced the three-term analogy to one of two terms, implying that man's attributes are proportional and analogous to those of God because man is an image of God. D. Thorn, et Alex. Alens., et Scot, intelligunt ilia verba de his analogis, quae dicuntur ad unum tertium, ut dicuntur urina et medicina sanae, per habitudinem ad sanitatem animalis; et eadem ratione possunt ilia verba intelligi de his, quorum unum ad aliud dicitur; nam de his verum est dicere, ita se habere, ut aliud ad aliud dicatur; sic autem se habet creatura ad Deum in ratione entis.3 One objection to the theory of analogy of proportionality is that it leaves room for a degree of agnosticism. We may say that God's know ledge in relation to God is proportionable to man's knowledge in rela tion to man; but the difficulty could be raised that we do not know the nature of God or of His knowledge, nor do we know in any exact sense the proportionability of the relationship of God's knowledge to God to that of man's knowledge to man. It might seem that the idea of analogy of attribution could be added to that of proportionality and brought in to save the situation. Man is an image of God, his qualities are images of God's perfections, and if those perfections in their definition imply no imperfection they can properly be applied to God, although human intellect cannot grasp the perfection of God himself, nor is any single perfection found univocally in both God and man. One is left with some faint, but real, knowledge of God, what has been called a ,bat's eye view', and one can properly predicate of him justice, wisdom, and goodness.4 1 Francisco Suarez, Opera Omnia (Paris, 1877), xxvi, p. 170; Disputationes Metaphysicae, disp.

O'HIGGINS Berkeley was not entirely fair to Browne nor, for that matter, was Browne to Berkeley. Browne certainly gave room for suspicion of agnosticism. He spoke indeed, frequently, of the inconceivability and incomprehensibility of God's attributes, but so too did Berkeley, in his Three Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous. But Browne also, while he accused King of confusing analogy and metaphor, said that while the 'superstructure' of King's sermon was faulty, he was sound in 'the main scope and design',1 while, in a passage in which he was dealing with the pseudo-Dionysius, he wrote, 'we cannot have the least conception or idea of what goodness is in the real nature of God, nor of any of those moral attributes into which we branch it, according to our observation of the greatest moral perfections whereof we find our human nature to be capable'.2 Such a passage needs very careful and sympathetic reading if it is not to be taken as agnostic. Moreover there is his very bluntly worded statement that our ideas of God amount at the utmost 'to no more than a type or figure, by which something in another world is signified, of which we have no more notion than a blind man hath of light'.3 This statement he was to modify in the later part of his Divine Analogy Analogy to the effect that we have more knowledge of Divine things than this, although indeed one could say a blind man is not completely agnostic with regard to light, since by his other senses, which are analogous with sight, he can gain some knowledge of what it means to a a sighted man. Browne's original use of the words 'type or figure' had nevertheless been rather unhappy. However, there are repeated passages —and Browne was repetitious—which show him not to have been genuinely agnostic and to hold a theory of analogy that was a blending of analogy of proportionality and analogy of attribution. In The Proce dure dure he wrote, in Divine Analogy the Resemblance, or at least the Correspondency and Proportion is real and built on the very nature of things on both sides of the comparison. There is something really correspondent and answerable and proportionable in heavenly and spiritual beings, to those conceptions which are justly substituted to represent them. As for instance, there is certainly some inconceivable perfection in God answerable to human knowledge; which is obtained by the labour of thinking and the operation of matter and spirit in essential conjunction; goodness in God is an in conceivable excellency of His nature correspondent to what we conceive and express by the same word in human nature; and the similis ratio or 'Analogy of Being' by J. H. Crehan. This is a very useful article because of the chronological way in which it treats the subject—and, in particular, the thought of St. Thomas Aquinas. 1 The Procedure, pp. 16, 17. 2 Divine Analogy, p. 82. The Procedure, p. 4.</page><page sequence="14">AGNOSTICISM OR ANTHROPOMORPHISM 101 proportion proportion runs thus, what knowledge and goodness are in the nature of man,man, that some inconceivable but correspondent perfections are in the nature of God.1 The word 'substituted' is significant, as will be seen. God's perfections are inconceivable but they are referred to as 'correspondent' to those of man and the passage on the 'similis ratio1 shows the analogy of which he is thinking to be that of proportionality. In the Divine Analogy he says, What we affirm and contend for is this; that there is a true and real resemblance or agreement between knowledge in God and knowledge in man; and that there is such a fountain of similitude and analogy between them, both in the divine and human nature, that the conception we have of our knowledge stands in the mind to represent justly and usefully a correspondent and similar, but infinite and otherwise incomprehensible perfection in the divine nature. This foundation we affirm to be dis covered to us not by mere reason only, but more particularly by that express revelation wherein we are said to be formed in the likeness and after the image of God.2 Again the words 'stands in the mind' should be noted, but the passage represents the addition of the idea of analogy of attribution to that of proportionality. He goes on, We [i.e. Berkeley and himself] both do hold that there is real knowledge in God, but with this material difference; that he rejects all resemblance only or similitude and correspondency between this attribute, and that knowledge whereof we have a consciousness in ourselves; and will have them formally the very same in kind, and different only in degree. But we contend that the term knowledge, when applied to God, expresseth an in comprehensible perfection purely and entirely divine, whereof it is im possible for us to have any direct conception or consciousness.3 Browne, therefore, was clearly not an agnostic. When he used the word 'incomprehensible' he meant, in his own definition, 'that we have no idea at all of the real true nature of God'—and the word 'idea' needs explaining—'nor any direct or immediate perceptions in the mind, of His attributes and perfections in any measure: and that we are utterly incapable of any direct and immediate knowledge of Him, by the utmost efforts of sense or reason, or imagination'.4 With these latter sentiments the Schoolmen, whom he quoted, would have agreed. However, the matter is not quite as clear as it might appear. The remaining factor is Browne's theory of knowledge and the way in which, if he were logical, he would have to apply it to our knowledge of God. 1 The Procedure, pp. 137, 138. 2 Divine Analogy, p. 387. נ Ibid., p. 389. 4 Ibid., p. 64.</page><page sequence="15">102 J. O'HIGGINS Browne used three terms in his epistemology, 'idea', 'consciousness', and 'conception'. He wrote, I must desire the reader to recollect what I have already said of the use of the word idea, and that I think it ought to be confined entirely to our simple and compound ideas of sensation, in distinction from all the operations operations and affections of the mind, of which we have an immediate consciousness consciousness without the intervention of any idea; and from all those complex notions or conceptions formed by the mind out of its own opera tions and the ideas of sensation.1 These 'notions' were very concrete things. With regard to the 'concep tion' of charity—an idea which one would be inclined to consider rather abstract—he wrote, 'We put together the ideas of a man, of want or misery,misery, of an alms, the notion in general of our duty to God, of humanity towards our fellow creatures, and of the reward of another world to make up the complex idea of charity.'2 This conception would still leave him with the problem of finding a concrete 'notion' of the rather abstract ideas of humanity and duty, but he certainly wanted to express his 'notions' in the concrete.3 He had no time for abstract ideas. He wrote of 'ideas' of things becoming general 'by one of the particulars being made to stand for an indefinite number of things of the same kind, which is the true Abstraction'.4 Abstraction, therefore, could only mean making one particular thing stand for all others of the same kind. The fact that Browne spoke of things of the same kind could be argued to imply that unconsciously he was admitting general abstract ideas. But he had no such suspicion. The result was that when he came to speak of the divine attributes by way of analogy he had to apply the same principles. We substitute, he said, our own notion of our own personal thinking for the idea of knowledge in God.5 Here he would certainly differ from the Schoolmen whom he was quoting. They believed in abstract concepts and they were part of their theory of analogy. This should have presented him with a problem. Berkeley objected that, according to Browne's theory of analogy, the latter, in any syllogism which he used concerning the attributes or existence of God, would end with an invalid syllogism of four terms. It is worth noting that Cajetan, in the very passage which Berkeley used for showing that the word 'wisdom' could be predicated properly of God, had begun by raising an objection concerning a four-term syllogism. He put it thus: 1 The Procedure, p. 133. 2 Ibid., p. 125. 3 In Divine Analogy, p. 551, Browne uses the word 'concrete'. He says that for grace, of which we can have 'no immediate idea or conception' we 'substitute the clear, and distinct, and direct idea or conception of natural and human force or influence in the concrete'. 4 Ibid., p. 522. Ibid., p. 389.</page><page sequence="16">AGNOSTICISM OR ANTHROPOMORPHISM 103 If we assert that wisdom is analogically common to God and man in virtue of the fact that wisdom, as found in man, taken precisely according to its formal concept, indicates a simple perfection, we cannot conclude that thereafter God is formally wise, by arguing in the following manner Every simple perfection is in God Wisdom is a simple perfection Therefore [wisdom is in God] For the minor must be distinguished. If the word wisdom stands for the character of wisdom as it is in man, the argument has four terms; for in the conclusion wisdom stands for the character of wisdom as it is found in God, when we conclude that there is wisdom in God.1 His reply was that given earlier by Berkeley, that wisdom is a pure per fection which can be predicated properly of God and that 'wisdom in the minor does not stand for this or that notion of wisdom, but for wisdom which is proportionately one'.2 As he said earlier in the treatise: 'The concept of an analogous name does not abstract from what is absolutely many as something which is absolutely one, but as something which is proportionately one, i.e. as what is similar according to proportions.'3 Wisdom, in other words, can be properly predicated both of man and God but, in using the word, the fact that man's wisdom is not of the same kind as that of God, but only related to it by analogy of proportion, must be taken into account. This was Cajetan's reply, though one should remember he rejected analogy of attribution. Berkeley likewise considered wisdom could properly be predicated of man and God, but Browne rejected this. In replying to Berkeley's objection he took the syllogism. 'If knowledge is a perfection in an human mind, then there must be knowledge in God, But knowledge is a perfection in an human mind, Therefore .. .4י Browne attacked Berkeley for saying that wisdom can properly be predicated of God, as he took this to mean that God's and man's know ledge are of the same kind. His reply to Berkeley's objection was that there are not four terms in the syllogism he had chosen, 'because there are not two different ideas or conceptions annexed to that term in those different places; but one and the same idea or conception necessarily stands in the mind for both the divine and human knowledge1.5 However this 'conception' is, quite simply, human knowledge in the concrete which 'stands for' Divine. 1 The Analogy of Names, n. 105. 22 Ibid., n. hi. 3 Ibid., n. 50. 4 Divine Analogy, p. 484. 5 Ibid., p. 485.</page><page sequence="17">104 J- O'HIGGINS Were it possible for the mind of man to obtain two different ideas or conceptions conceptions directly from the two different kinds of knowledge in God and man; or, in other words, to affix two different conceptions to the term knowledge knowledge in the different parts of that syllogism, there would be four terms in it, and it would conclude equivocally; but since we can obtain no other conception for that sort of knowledge which is in God than what we have for our own, both the term and the conception remain unalterably the same.1 It is true that he says they are literally and directly in one part of the syllogism applied to man and in another analogically to God; but the fact remains that, if we keep strictly to Browne's epistemology, the con elusion 'There is knowledge in God' means in 'both the term and con ception' human knowledge, and that in the concrete, which only 'stands for' the Divine. The term 'knowledge' could be taken, from the point of view of Browne's epistemology, as an algebraic symbol standing for something totally unknown, and this suspicion could be reinforced by his refusal to allow the word 'knowledge', which he says we only know in concrete personal human experience, to be predicated properly of God. It is true that the Divine Analogy is a sequel to the Procedure and that there is a chapter on analogy in the latter. Browne's theory of analogy cannot be entirely divorced from his general theory of knowledge, but the two do not ride too easily together, and the theory of the Schoolmen did depend on the acceptance of abstract ideas. One can well see why the Bishop was so long under suspicion of agnos ticism. One can also understand why Browne accused Berkeley of anthro pomorphism. To him wisdom and knowledge in their proper formal sense meant the concrete conception of those attributes in one single human being—in fact, in oneself. To apply them in a proper formal sense to God meant, to him, to say that God's knowledge is really of the same kind as human knowledge for which the notion of knowledge and wisdom in oneself is made to 'stand'. The conclusion of his syllogism would therefore, in his opinion, taken in a Berkleian sense, be anthro pomorphic. However, is the charge of anthroporphism a sound one? In his criticism of Berkeley Browne is often very ill informed. He ridicules Berkeley's usage of the term 'metaphorical analogy' as though it were a personal absurdity. Yet both Cajetan and Suarez use the term. More important, he rejects the idea that wisdom can, as Berkeley says it can, be properly predicated of God. Yet Aquinas, Suarez, and Cajetan, all of whom he professes to respect, say that it can be so predicated.2 1 Divine Analogy, p. 486. 22 For Suarez and Cajetan cf. supra. For Aquinas cf. Summa Theologica, Ia q. XIII, a. Ill, ad Im.</page><page sequence="18">AGNOSTICISM OR ANTHROPOMORPHISM 105 But Browne, as has been seen, was not the only person to say Berkeley was anthropomorphic. In Alciphron he shows quite clearly that he holds to analogy; analogy, that is, expressed in what he considers to be a proper way. In the long passage already quoted an important sentence is: 'we may say, therefore, that as God is infinitely above man, so is the knowledge of God infinitely above the knowledge of man'. A great deal depends on the meaning of the word 'infinite'. If it means mathematical infinity, or, as Browne asserts, simply unlimitedly great, then Berkeley was saying, as Browne said he was, that God's knowledge is of the same kind as ours though much greater in extent, and he would be anthropomorphic. But if by 'infinite' he means totally without limit, outside limit in fact, and totally self-explanatory, he would not. Now Berkeley quotes Suarez through the voice of Crito in the Dialogue, and therefore presumably with approval. He gives Suarez as saying that knowledge is not to be found in God in the like imperfect kind in which it is found in the creatures.1 Therefore he is saying it differs in kind. Moreover he quotes Aquinas, saying 'knowledge in God is not a habit but a pure act',2—or, in other words, has nothing potential about it and excludes or rather is outside all limit. Again there occurs the passage: 'It was indeed a current opinion in the Schools that even being itself should be attributed analogically to God and the creatures. That is, they held that God, the supreme, independent, self-originate cause and source of all things, must not be supposed to exist in the same sense with created beings; not that He exists less truly or properly than they, but only because He exists in a more eminent and perfect manner.'3 Again he seems to sympathize with the statement. Taking these pas sages into account it would appear that, in his account of analogy, he did not look upon God anthropomorphically nor regard His knowledge as being of the same kind as ours. What of Sillem's opinion: that Berkeley treated God as a cause among other causes? In stating the arguments from order or from causality it is often true that the fact that God's causality is not of the same genus with other causes, or, in other words, is not univocal with them, is not emphasized. This will usually be an omission of careless ness and not a deliberate statement of God's univocity with His crea tures. Berkeley could have been guilty of such carelessness. What he says in the Principles of Human Knowledge is that we cannot know the existence of other spirits, otherwise than by their operations, or the ideas by them excited in us. I perceive several motions, 1 Works, iii, Alciphron, p. 168. 2 Ibid, and Summa, Ia, q. XIV, a. I, ad Im. 3 Works, iii, Alciphron, p. 169.</page><page sequence="19">106 J. O'HIGGINS changes and combinations of ideas, that inform me that there are certain particular agents like myself, which accompany them, and concur in their production. Hence the knowledge of other spirits is not immediate as is the knowledge of my ideas; but depending on the intervention of ideas, by me referred to agents or spirits distinct from myself as effects or con comitant signs. But he says that the far greater part of the ideas or sensations—this, or rather sensed objects, was what he meant by the term 'ideas'— perceived by us are not produced by, or dependent on, the wills of men. There is there fore some other spirit that causes them, since it is repugnant that they should exist by themselves. . . . Hence it is evident, that God is known as certainly and immediately as any other mind or spirit whatsoever, dis tinct from our selves. We may even assert, that the existence of God is far more evidently perceived than the existence of men; because the effects of Nature are infinitely more numerous and considerable than those ascribed to human agents.1 In Alciphron he wrote, I do not see Alciphron, i.e. that individual thinking thing, but only such visible signs and tokens as suggest and infer the being of that invisible principle or soul. Even so, in the self-same manner, it seems to me, though I cannot with the eyes of flesh behold the invisible God, yet I do in the strictest sense behold and perceive by all my senses such signs and tokens, such effects and operations, as suggest, indicate, and demonstrate an invisible God, as certainly, and with all the same evidence, at least, as any other signs perceived by sense do suggest to me the existence of your soul, spirit, or thinking principle; which I am convinced of only by a few signs or effects, and the motions of one small organized body; whereas I do at all times and in all places perceive sensible signs which evince the being of God.2 Do these passages put the causality of God on a par with the causality of other spirits ? Sillem says that Berkeley's 'opinion that we know the being of God in a way that is in principle exactly the same as that in which we come to know the being of other persons . . . does not really enable him to prove anything more than that there must be a mind immanent within the universe, a soul of the world which uses material things in the way in which we use our bodily members in our dealings with other people'.3 If a strict parallelism were to be observed between the way in which Berkeley said we know other spirits and the way in which we know God, since other spirits really, according to his theory, only move their own bodies, and since physical things are not capable of causative action, 1 Works, ii, pp. 107, 108. 2 Works, iii, p. 147. 3 George Berkeley, p. 213.</page><page sequence="20">AGNOSTICISM OR ANTHROPOMORPHISM 107 this would be true. In strict parallelism other physical things or 'ideas' would be the body of God. However, as one might expect, and from a very early date, Berkeley denied the idea of an anima mundi.1 Moreover physical things, or 'ideas', he said, are not part of the essence or sub stance of God 'who is an impassive, indivisible, purely active being'.2 However successful or unsuccessful was Berkeley's proof of the exis tence of God, it does not show that he considered God to be just another spirit, even one of immense power. Sillem continues, 'The God whose existence he proves is too much like human agents, and known in a way which is too much like that in which we know other men, to make it possible for us to identify Him with the God of trans cendent majesty and hidden splendour.'3 However, Berkeley clearly distinguishes between finite and Divine causation and makes the for mer dependent on the latter. He wrote, 'It is true, I have denied there are other agents besides spirits; but this is very consistent with allowing to thinking rational beings, in the production of motions, the use of limited powers, ultimately indeed derived from God, but immediately under the direction of their own wills, which is sufficient to entitle them to all the guilt of their own actions.'4 He referred to God as one 'Whom no external being can affect, who perceives nothing by sense as we do, whose will is absolute and independent, causing all things, and liable to be thwarted or resisted by nothing'.5 Finally he had Philonous say, 'God is a being of transcendent and unlimited perfec tions; His nature therefore is incomprehensible to finite spirits. It is not therefore to be expected, that any men, whether materialist or immaterialistimmaterialist should have exactly just notions of the Deity, His attributes, and ways of operation': and he made him talk of 'the inadequateness of our conceptions of the Divine Nature'.6 Here he was using words that were more familiar in the pages of Browne. But what is quite clear is that he did not consider God to be a spirit like other spirits, or even to be, as Sillem says, 'so accessible to men as to be all but experienced by them'.7 These passages show Berkeley plainly not to have been anthro pomorphic in his approach to God. However, as in the case of Browne, there still remains the problem raised by Berkeley's epistemology. Like Browne he did not believe in abstract general ideas. The term 'idea' meant to him a sensed object. For such things as will, love, hate, myself, spirit, justice, and virtue 1 Works, i, p. 76, Philosophical Commentaries, Notebook A, n. 617. 2 Works, ii, Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous, pp. 213, 214. 3 George Berkeley, p. 216. 4 Works, ii, Three Dialogues, p. 237. 5 Ibid., p. 241. 6 Ibid., p. 254. 7 George Berkeley, p. 216.</page><page sequence="21">108 J. O'HIGGINS he used the word 'notion'.1 An idea, he said, 'which considered in itself is particular, because general, by being made to stand for all particularly ideas of the same sort'.2 One might ask whether the word 'sort' did not imply something of the rejected abstract idea. With regard to 'notions' in the sense of the mental as objects, Berkeley considered them in the particular and, his own term, in the concrete.3 A word is a sign which 'becomes general by being made the sign, not of an abstract general idea but, of several particular ideas any one of which it in differently suggests to the mind'.4 This presumably is as true of 'notions' as of 'ideas', and he expressly rejected the abstract ideas of happiness or goodness.5 The question therefore has to be asked what could he mean by saying in the conclusion of Cajetan's syllogism that wisdom is in God, or in Alciphron that we have a 'direct and proper notion, though never so inadequate, of knowledge and wisdom, as they are in the Deity'. By 'direct' it is clear from his remark about the incomprehensibility of God, that he could not mean intuitive and immediate. But what could he mean by 'proper' ? The Schoolmen, who used the term, took abstract ideas for granted; but to Berkeley one not only is confined to knowledge of 'wisdom' in the particular and concrete but 'wisdom' in itself, in the abstract, is ruled out. One can perhaps say that Peter is roughly like John and James in many respects, say Peter stands for John and James, and use him as standing for a whole number of individuals approximately alike, and make him stand for the term 'man'. Even so, there are diffi culties in talking of the equal rights of men, and still more of those of men of different races, if men are only approximately similar. But how can one extend this process to a transcendent God and say that the term 'wisdom', which we only consider in the individual and in the concrete, in fact in ourselves, can 'properly' be extended to him? Or rather will we not be, at best, extending the term in an anthropo morphic sense? Berkeley's Scholastic theory of analogy seems to be running on the rocks of his anti-Scholastic epistemology. And yet he certainly held both the doctrine of analogy and his own immaterialist theory of knowledge. Here one can well consider the anonymous letter published in Mind. As has been said, it seems to attack Browne's theory of analogy, rather than analogy itself. If this is not the case it certainly cannot be by Berkeley. The unknown individual who published it first in A Literary 1 Works, iii, Alciphron, p. 292. 2 Works, ii, Principles, p. 32. 3 Works, iii, Alciphron, p. 304, in which he talks of 'force' being taken 'in concrete' and being, as such, what everyone knows and 'in abstract' as 'what nobody can comprehend'. Of grace and force he has been saying we have 'notions' but not 'ideas'. 4 Works, ii, Principles, p. 31. 5 Ibid., p. 84.</page><page sequence="22">AGNOSTICISM OR ANTHROPOMORPHISM 109 Journal Journal did not attribute it to Berkeley, but only said it was sent to Browne—and from the fact that he published it he can be seen to have been no friend to Browne. Nor does he seem to have been very reliable in his knowledge of the anonymous pieces he had published. In 1746 he sent to the same Journal a piece bearing the title 'Essay on the Being and Attributes of God', and said he thought it was by the writer of the earlier letter. According to Pittion and Berman it could not possibly have been by Berkeley.1 The writer of the letter asks Browne how he can conceive a medium between figurative and proper. This was precisely what Browne was trying to do. If the writer had implied that he was trying to find a medium between univocity and equivocity and that this was impossible, he would have been impugning analogy itself and he could not have been Berkeley. But this he did not do. There are two passages which seem to present the writer's own opinion. In the first he writes, 'Wisdom, says your Lordship, has but one determinate and proper meaning, no ways applicable to our Maker, and therefore when affirmed of Him stands only by parity of reason and analogy for something else different in kind, but similar and cor respondent to it. This, say I, is a tolerable description of metaphorical expressions, and the manner of applying them; and God therefore in your sense is only metaphorically wise.' This would be fair comment if and in so far as Browne was saying that wisdom could only be properly predicated of man and man's wisdom made to stand for an inconceivable quality in God. However, the writer continues, 'Have a care, replies your Lordship, the correspondency I mean is real and substantial, founded in the very nature of wisdom literal and wisdom analogical.' This corresponds to Browne's saying, for example, that analogy is founded on the very nature of the things on both sides of the comparison. The writer then asks, 'Are they therefore, as common logic would conclude, alike in essence and similar in kind, the same in their in separable properties, and different only in comprehensiveness, degree, or manner of exertion?' He has Browne reply, 'God forbid! They differ totally in kind, are in all essential properties distinct and in them selves, that is, if I mistake not, infinitely distant.' The writer ends, 'Good my Lord, have some mercy on poor reason, must it necessarily digest these contradictions, admit a real correspondency in essentials between things totally different in essentials, a similitude of nature consistent with an entire disparity of nature, at its first entrance into religion?'2 These are passages which present some problems. One might ask whether Berkeley, who did not believe in abstract general 1 Mind, op. cit., p. 376. 2 David., p. 388.</page><page sequence="23">110 J. O'HIGGINS ideas or, it would seem, genera and species,1 could talk of things being 'alike in essence'. But does it show that the writer considered that God's and man's wisdom were similar in kind and essence and different only in degree and manner of exertion ? This, if it were so, would be a very strong swing towards anthropomorphism. And if the letter is linked with the Fourth Dialogue of Alciphron it would seem to present a con tradiction that could hardly be acceptable in what was virtually one and the same treatise, even though inconsistencies in Berkeley's system as a whole, such as have been pointed out, can be more easily accepted. In Alciphron Berkeley was using the Schoolmen's doctrines as an argu ment against Lysicles. He was sponsoring their arguments, especially those of Cajetan. He quoted Pico della Mirandola as speaking ,like other men'2 when he talked of God's knowledge being of a different kind from that of angels and of men. He did not disapprove of Aquinas' saying that God's knowledge is not a habit but a pure act. Suarez again, as has been said, is quoted as saying that God's knowledge is not of the imperfect kind found in creatures, and the Schoolmen in general as saying that God must not be supposed to exist in the same sense with created beings. All this rides ill with a statement that God's wisdom is similar in kind to man's. It rides so ill that, if the latter opinion were that of the writer, there would be a very good reason to question whether that writer were Berkeley. There is one point to notice, however. The writer says 'as common logic would conclude'. This could mean not 'as common sense would conclude' but 'as logically follows from Browne's statements'. Whether this is a fair conclusion from the Bishop's books is another matter, but it would mean that the passage that follows is not necessarily expressing the opinion of the writer himself. Certainly Berkeley held that Divine and human knowledge differ in kind. Certainly he held that God's knowledge is infinitely above man's. It is hard to see how, given his epistemology, he could say they are alike in essence. One has a suspicion that the writer of the letter held that they are the same in essence. This would not be in accord with the Scholastic doc trine of analogy, as it would really make them generically univocal. But Berkeley, as has been said, did not seem to like the idea of genera. According to the Scholastic doctrine, such things as wisdom and being are not genera, even though they can be predicated properly of both God and creatures. They can be predicated properly but analogically. It might well be possible for Berkeley, while holding that God's 1 This would seem to be the conclusion drawn from Works, i, p. 86, Philoso phicalphical Commentaries, Notebook A, n. 703. It also should follow from the denial of abstract general ideas. 2 Works, iii, Alciphron, p. 168.</page><page sequence="24">AGNOSTICISM OR ANTHROPOMORPHISM ill knowledge is of a different kind to that of man, and therefore avoiding anthropomorphism, to say, using the word in what for him would be a very loose sense, that the essence of wisdom is the same in both God and man. But in saying this he would be departing from the purity of his epistemological principles. However, there is a passage in which the writer of the letter gives his own point of view. He criticizes Browne for asserting that 'wisdom is always relative to man' and says, Wisdom is with me more extensive in its meaning, and, instead of a mere human power, as your Lordship constantly describes it, stands in my sense of the expression, for a faculty, in whatever kind and of what ever being it be found, by which good ends, and suitable means of attain ing them, are discovered and pursued. I can thus speak with the same propriety of Divine wisdom as of human, understand my self, and convey explicit notions to another, while, in your contracted sense, we must labour every step we take, to keep inconsistencies together, and reconcile repugnancies. ... To use your Lordship's own description, when we regulate our conduct by just notions in choosing proper means to obtain a commendable end, we call that wisdom·, may we not therefore when we find another being regulate its conduct so as to choose proper means to obtain a commendable end, call that wisdom also, and may not the word wisdom wisdom indeterminately stand for any power which that being, or any being, has of thus regulating its conduct, without becoming unintel ligible.1 And he says that Browne's 'fundamental error' was a refusal to acknow ledge 'that undetermined words can convey true conceptions to the mind'.2 The idea that a word that does not express an 'idea'—in the Berkleian sense—such as power, or grace, may be significant is found prominently in the Seventh Dialogue of Alciphron. One is inclined to think, that in Alciphron it has a suspicious correspondence to the pro scribed abstract concept of a pure perfection such as that of wisdom or justice, and this in spite of Berkeley's express rejection of the notion. What is clear is that the writer is, with some justification, criticizing Browne's restricting the proper use of the word wisdom to human wisdom and that he is drawing a distinction, in kind, it would seem, between human wisdom and Divine. Perhaps there is a tendency, as Sillem pointed out in the case of Berkeley, to make this distinction rather too fine but, if the writer were Berkeley, the same texts that have already been quoted could be brought forward to qualify this tendency. In Alciphron wisdom was said to be capable of being predicated of God because there is no defect in its definition, because it is, in Cajetan's words, a simple perfection. In the letter it is predicated of Him because 1 Mind, pp. 390, 391. 2 Ibid., p. 391.</page><page sequence="25">112 J.

The conclusion of the whole matter would be again that, if the letter contradicts Berkeley's exposition of analogy in Alciphroti,Alciphroti, it cannot have been written by him, but that it is possible to reconcile the letter and the Dialogue and, in that case, Berkeley is still not anthropomorphic. Browne, therefore, was not agnostic. Berkeley cannot be proved to be anthropomorphic. But there are elements in the epistemology of each writer that are in conflict with the absence of agnosticism in the one and of anthropomorphism in the other. And in Berkeley's case this contrast is heightened by passages in his treatment of causality, and of the argument from design. Ά foolish consistency', wrote Emerson, 'is the hobgoblin of little minds',1 but consistency is a convenience for the commentators on the writings of philosophers. Browne has been much ill treated, though he was verbose. Berkeley was long misunderstood. But a greater degree of consistency in both would be of use for the treatment of their different doctrines of analogy. J. O'Higgins 1 W. Ε.
