<plain_text><page sequence="1">SLEEPING nir.TIDMAR o CO o m go" 00 o &lt; GO GO &lt; o CO nr NAnifl niirhiissfimI</page><page sequence="2">In an article about the late nineteenth-century African American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, Harryette Mullen writes that she does not claim him as one of her "consciously chosen ancestor poets," but also admits that this may be because "his poetry was an influence so pervasive in [her] upbringing" that there was no need to do so ("When" 277). Because she did not recognize him as a poetic ancestor after whom she could model herself, Mullen had no desire as a budding poet to experiment with a poetic dialect like Dunbar's, which, for her, "rep resented an archaic form of American English" ("When" 278). I will argue here, however, that the poetic elements with which Mullen most closely associates Dunbar — archaism and dialect — in fact drive her work. Since the Harlem Renaissance, readers have rejected Dunbar's invented dialects and the high poetic diction in his non-dialect poems as artificial; the language he used in both modes was already beginning to sound quaintly antiquated and overly mannered to some ears even in Dunbar's time and, certainly, a generation later. Although Mullen contrasts Dunbar's interest in approaching "a practice of transcribing the oral onto the page" to her own in writing as "a transformation of the oral into something that draws together different allusive possibilities in one utterance" ("Solo" 656), the artifice and archaism of Dunbar's diction suggests that he is actually doing some thing other than "transcribing the oral," a phrase that implies temporal imme diacy in the inscription and transparency in the reading process. The dependence of dialect poetry in general upon visually striking orthography and punctuation ironically renders it a profoundly textual genre. As Charles Bernstein and others have argued, dialect writing "doesn't so much transcribe words as it underscores the sensuous/sinuous materiality of language" (10). Literary dialect always involves a transformation or translation in its representation of speech. Nevertheless, characterizing Mullens poetry as both textual and dialectal amounts to proposing a fairly awkward genealogy. But situating Mullen in a "dialect poetry" tradition, following in the wake of work by Dunbar and other dialect poets, throws light on Mullens postmodern negotiations of the same imagined tension between orality and literacy. In other words, critic Elizabeth Frosts observation that Mullen is "employing and questioning concepts of the so-called 'black vernac ular' in texts that straddle the supposed divides between visual and speech-based poetics" can be productively extended backward to earlier generations of dialect poets, bypassing contemporary poets invested in oral subgenres such as slam poetry (137). The presentation of the spoken voice is valuable for Mullen, but speech manifests itself differently from the way it does in the work of, for example, innovative sound poet Tracie Morris, who has composed many poems that exist solely in the oral performance of them. In "Imagining the Unimagined Reader: Writing to the Unborn and Including the Excluded," Mullen observes of her own writing, "Although some of my poems would not suffer if they were heard but not read, others ought to be seen as well as heard" (203). For example, the virgule in the title of Mullens poem "Coo/Slur" divides words performing affection</page><page sequence="3">("coo") and degradation ("slur") in a manner that is not audible, and the poem itself consists of homophonic variations on colors that are split down the middle ("yell ow" and "viol let") textually, but not necessarily aurally. Even more conspicuous are the visual markers corresponding to omitted letters in the title of Mullen's S*PeRM**K*T (1992), which allow the reader to see the unheard "supermarket"1 that is the theme of the book. The physical appearance of Mullen's texts demonstrates her attention to textuality and her awareness of the limiting assump tions behind "any theory of African-American lit erature that privileges a speech-based poetics, or the trope of orality, to the exclusion of more writerly texts," a privileging that she claims "will cost us some impoverishment of the tradition" ("African" 670-671). In addition, the title of Mullen's Sleeping with the Dictionary (2002) attests to the importance of writing and of print — and, more specifically, of lexicography and the compilation of written language — to her project. Although Mullen's title reflects the role of the dictionary in structuring her book, as does the alphabetical organization of her poems, critics who acknowledge the book's form as an abecedarian usually stop short of calling it a dictionary.2 Several readers, including Mullen herself, have pointed out that her choice of The American Heritage Dictionary speaks to her dedication to this lexicographical project, one that was and is constructed through a usage panel of contributors whose opinions are summarized in "Usage Notes"; an example from the fourth edition includes the following sentence: "77 percent of the Usage Panel accepted the use of anticipate to mean 'to feel or to realize beforehand' and 'to look forward to'" ("Anticipate," usage note). What has been neglected is that this democratic compositional philosophy has been effectively borrowed and exceeded by Mullen.3 Like the pieces of Gertrude Stein's Tender Buttons (1914), which critics more commonly compare to Mullens earlier book Trimmings (1991), a few of the poems of Sleeping with the Dictionary, such as "Blah-Blah" and "Coo/ Slur," work well as inclusive and eclectic dictionary definitions, complete with examples of usage. Treating each of her poems like a dictionary entry allows us to recognize the assemblage of odd words jostling against each other — sometimes aggressively — as the product of various idiolects and dialects, just as the ideal multivocal American Heritage Dictionary entry should be. In fact, Mullen, citing Louis Cabri and Jeff Derksen's description of her approach in Trimmings, calls her language "less a disjunctive idiolect, more a layering and juxtaposing of com munolects" (Henning 13). The antiquated and nearly obsolete words and usages that are found everywhere in Mullens book preserve in amber the traces of the various directions taken in the historical development of the language even more scrupulously than the dictionary does. In addition, as Jessica Lewis Luck points out, Mullen's use of "'colonized' words" in poems like "Blah-Blah," many of which are included in the American Heritage, "calls attention to the history of despotism and exploitation contained within that linguistic 'heritage,'" which could "explain Sleeping with the Dictionary's close resonance with the phrase 'sleeping with the enemy'" (372). This is reminiscent of the postcolonial subject's relationship of linguistic antagonism to the metropole in John Agard's "Listen Mr. Oxford Don": "Dem accuse me of assault / on de Oxford dictionary / imagine a concise peaceful man like me" (44). To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, words, like works of art, are some times outlaws until they are classics, and the conflicts arising during that process of appropriation are often effaced or forgotten. Pointing out that Langston Hughes and Arna Bontemps were once on the usage panel for The American Heritage Dictionary, Mullen says in an interview with Cynthia Hogue that she is 36 Modem Language Studies 42.2</page><page sequence="4">actually trying to question those kinds of dis tinctions that are being made between the standard and the non-standard. I wouldn't say that standard American English is in any way a white language. It's a language that is the result of many peoples' contributions, (n. pag.) As a result, her work makes visible the invisible admission and incorporation of words or phrases from diverse sources into the standard American dialect, at which point it is inevitably granted "white" status. (We might think of the list provided by Tracie Morris of words of probable African and African American origin in "What is African American about African American Poetry?"4) It is no wonder that, although nineteenth-century American phi lologists could point to numerous words in the American language that had roots in the experiences of various ethnic groups in the United States, they could operate under the absurd assumption that "the only noncontributors were African Americans" (Cmiel 928). In using fragments and figments of Black Vernacular English alongside other dialects and registers of English, Mullen pushes against the perceived limitations of and boundaries between varieties of represented speech in writing. Mullens word games and puzzles, necessitating the discovery of implicit formulae in order to decipher the ciphered text, sensitize readers to what constitutes standard language through the manipulation of nonstandard language of all kinds, down to the level of phonemes and morphemes. These puzzles can consist of "dead metaphors" and clichés that have been broken apart in such a way that they entice the reader to piece them together. They can be puzzles so elaborate as to make the poems appear at first glance to be nonsense. In each case, Mullen is interested in disrupting and redirecting the reading process through these word games, and in making readers of various backgrounds aware of the cultural influ ences that inform their reading. In describing her penchant for puzzles, Mullen writes that "[sjolving such word puzzles models the activity of different readers decoding and comprehending alternative messages from the same text" ("Imagining" 203). Many of the metaphorical and métonymie puzzles created by Mullen, however, appear to have only one solution, not "alternative messages." Readers of her "Between," for example, are compelled to join only words that go together idiomatically: "shit" with "shinola," "rock" with "hard place," etc. Still, breaking from the conventional left-to-right reading process of written English (the poem is written in columns) permits the reader to begin from any point in the poem in constructing syntactic meaning. In addition, although the poem seems easily soluble in a prede termined way, a meaning is produced by the reader through the labor of that solution, which leaves open the possibility that other readers could solve the poem differently, or hear what Mullen calls "different allusive possibilities" ("Solo Mysterioso" 656). Michel de Certeau cites Descartes on a similar collaborative reading process, produced in the space "between two sorts of expectation in combination: the expec tation that organizes a readable space (a literality), and one that organizes a procedure necessary for the actualization of the work (a reading)": It is a strange fact that the principle of this reading activity was formulated by Descartes more than three hundred years ago, in discussing contemporary research on combinative systems and on the example of ciphers (chiffres) or coded texts: "And if someone, in order to decode a cipher written with ordinary letters, thinks of reading a B everywhere he finds an A, and reading a C where he finds a B, and thus to substitute for each letter the one that follows it in alphabetic order and if, reading in this way, articles 37</page><page sequence="5">he finds words that have a meaning, he will not doubt that he has discovered the true meaning of this cipher in this way, even though it could very well be that the person who wrote it meant something quite different..." (171) Just as Descartes's cipher refuses complete transpar ency even when one believes that one has "cracked the code," so to speak, so too do Mullens dialect puzzles invite the reader to take comfort in easily decoded messages only to confront ultimately the impossibility of sharing the idiolectal perspective that produced the puzzle and the necessity of pro ducing meaning from one's own idiolectal perspec tive. As she puts it, "Personal affirmations, cryptic salutations, covert denials, or other secret messages might be coded into other meaningful or meaningless utterances as divergent attitudes lurking in the text" (Henning 28). The passive voice Mullen uses here — cryptograms "might be coded," rather than "I might have coded" them — gestures towards her surrender of authorial control driven by a spirit of collaboration with the reader, even if the result of that collaboration causes meaning to "diverge" from that which was intended. Two prose poems from Sleeping with the Dictionary subject the most canonical writer of the Western literary tradition to this sort of puzzling. No longer wrestling, as Dunbar did, with the felt divide between literary dialect and existing poetic diction, Mullen re-imagines Shakespeare's language and translates it into another equally foreign tongue: that of antique slang. Mullen's "Dim Lady" is a rewriting of Shakespeare's Sonnet 130, which begins with the familiar line "My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun" (112). Shakespeare, of course, is reworking an already conventional blazon structure that depends upon an overestimation and idealiza tion of the beloved. However, as Helen Vendler writes, "This mock-blazon pretends to be a denigration, but is in fact a defense of the woman as she is, as rare as any" (556). Unlike those con ventional poems that would have the beloved's eyes shining like the sun, the speaker of Shakespeare's sonnet sees no resemblance between the sun and his lover's eyes. Rather than being a parodie revision of Shakespeare's, Mullen's poem is in dialogue with his, building upon, not contradicting, the linguistic as well as the thematic force of Sonnet 130. Mullen replaces the familiar conventions overturned in Shakespeare's poem with bizarre equivalents: the sun becomes the similarly bright "neon"; the snow becomes the also starkly white "Liquid Paper"; the red-and-white rose becomes a similarly variegated tablecloth at a chain restaurant (whose name, Shakey's, is a playful reference to Shakespeare's name). The result, quoted in its entirety below, is a third-order series of similes that is almost nonsensical without reference to the original sonnet, which in turn is meaningless without reference to the implied blazon that it challenges: My honeybunch's peepers are nothing like neon. Todays special at Red Lobster is redder than her kisser. If Liquid Paper is white, her racks are institutional beige. If her mop were Slinkys, dishwater Slinkys would grow on her noggin. I have seen tablecloths in Shakey's Pizza Parlors, red and white, but no such picnic colors do I see in her mug. And in some minty-fresh mouthwashes there is more sweetness than in the garlic breeze my main squeeze wheezes. I love to hear her rap, yet I'm aware that Muzak has a hipper beat. 38 Modem Language Studies 42.2</page><page sequence="6">I don't know any Marilyn Monroes. My ball and chain is plain from head to toe. And yet, by gosh, my scrumptious Twinkie has as much sex appeal for me as any lanky model or platinum movie idol who's hyped beyond belief. The comparisons derived from the natural world that make up Sonnet 130 are here replaced with "debased" commercial elements like Muzak and Twinkies, derivative imitations of music and cakes.5 Although neon is a natural gas, its most common format, as we are presented with it, is in signs advertising businesses or products. The wires, too, of Sonnet 130 have been shaped and transformed, just as the neon has, to create a commercial product: a Slinky. The woman of Shakespeare's sonnet has dun breasts, but Mullens woman has "racks" that are "institutional beige," a sign that she has inter nalized her corporate surroundings and is beginning to take on the colors of the workplace. But "institutional beige" is a provocative revision for another reason. Mullen's change from "dun" to "beige" effectively divests the poem of one of the central tensions lurking behind the implications of Shakespeare's parody for contemporary speakers and readers of the English language: the shifting sense of the word "black" colors our understanding of the disjunction between the beloved and the beauty ideal. Margreta de Grazia points out that "the important work that is being done on England's contact with Africa and on its cultural representa tions of that contact is making it increasingly difficult to dissociate in this period blackness from racial blackness — black from blackamoor" (106). "Dun" is brown; according to the Oxford English Dictionary, it is "of a dull or dingy brown colour," an unlikely color to use in describing the complexion of a white woman ("Dun," adj. 1). What constitutes a dark complexion is, of course, relative, depending upon the individual's perspective as well as the culture's, but the contemporary sense of "black" (to mean "of African descent" and not simply "brunette" or "dark-skinned European") is part of the revision of Sonnet 130 that must color Mullen's composition. Stephen Booth alerts us to the fact that "Shakespeare and his contemporaries regularly use black as if it were a simple antonym for 'beautiful'" (434). (This equation of blackness with ugliness results in the necessary paradox of the line "I am black but comely" from Song of Solomon, the King James version of the Bible being itself a Renaissance text, published only two years after Shakespeare's sonnets.6) There is, of course, strong critical resistance to thinking of the representation of Shakespeare's Dark Lady as a representation of a woman of African descent, as Marvin Hunt argues. Hunt situates his discussion in the historical context of a seventeenth-century England in which Africans were a strong presence, and in the literary context of a minor tradition of lyric poetry about the beauty of African women. He writes, "As we approach millennium's end, the dark lady is darker than ever; yet we are still extremely cautious... about approach ing her not only as a sign of womanness, but also of color" (386). But there is no indication that Mullen's beloved is even as dark as Shakespeare's. The color of the beloved's skin is not the only physical feature altered by Mullen; other substitutions also remove elements that would darken the subject of desire. Although it is a poetic convention, com paring hair to "wires" as Shakespeare does is racially charged.7 Mullen uses instead wire "Slinkys," a comparison that points to the degree of curl more than it does to the coarse texture of the hair. "Black" becomes "dishwater" in Mullen's version, an adjective associated most closely with blonde hair, and even the poem's title refers to the "dumb blonde" articles 39</page><page sequence="7">stereotype. This attention to hair is not, given the context of Mullen's work in general, presented neutrally. In an interview with Mullen conducted by Elizabeth Frost, Frost mentions that "[t]here is a lot about hairdos" in Muse &amp; Drudge, and Mullens response is that "if two black women are together long enough, they will talk about hair" (414). This obsession with hair permeates Sleeping with the Dictionary; the phrases "fried, dyed, laid to the side" and "Happy to Be Nappy," among others, appear in the poem "Jinglejangle." In Muse &amp; Drudge, too, the lines "naps in the back / if you can't stand / sit in your soul kitsch" and "tries no lie relaxation" gesture toward meanings that people intimately familiar with black cultures would have access to (7, 18), while others would be left outside of the intended readership.8 More important, Mullen calls her beloved a "dim lady" in response to the woman who has come to be known as Shakespeare's "Dark Lady." "Dark" can be an absolute value at the opposite end of the continuum from "light," but "dim" is in between, neither dark nor light. "Dishwater," too, describes the hair color as a dull shade of blonde, an in-between value. Mullen's rewriting of Shakespeare's sonnet leaves the beloved racially ambiguous in a way that ends up mimicking and gesturing back to — one could even say, decoding the archaic dialect of — the original poem. Booth's contextualizing of the ety mology of key words in the poem responds to an anticipated reading: a beloved with black hair and brown skin is likely to be black in a poem written today. To describe the object of the poem as "beige" with "dishwater" hair leaves her racial and ethnic background as fluid and unstable as Shakespeare's Dark Lady's would be read, in her context. The double-sense of "denigration" in Vendler's explication of the poem — she claims that the poem only "pretends to be a denigration" — unintentionally points to the darkness at the heart of the poem, which is avoided elsewhere in her explication. Mullen ambiguates the darkness in her poem and separates the two senses of "denigration," a term that coinci dentally generates an entire poem appearing just before "Dim Lady" in Sleeping with the Dictionary.9 In Trimmings, Mullen describes her relationship with the same beauty ideal overturned by Sonnet 130. She writes, "The words pink and white kept appearing as I explored the ways that the English language conventionally represents femininity. As a black woman writing in this language, I suppose I already had an ironic relationship to this pink and white femininity" (69). And this distance between the black woman writer and the idealized feminine object in Anglo-American culture (especially in literature and the arts) pervades the prose pieces of Trimmings. It is this same "pink and white femininity" that "Dim Lady," with a dose of irony, appears to reproduce and perpetuate. Marilyn Monroe may be the goddess next to whom this beloved happily falls short, but the beloved is still a "scrumptious Twinkie": she is just, in other words, another yellow-and-white over-processed confection. The structure set up by the Shakespearean model, and the resulting racially ambiguous description of the beloved as "beige" with "dishwater" hair, may imply resistance to the kind of femininity exemplified by the "lanky model / or platinum movie idol who's hyped beyond belief," but the language upon which "Dim Lady" depends is created by the same popular culture that produces this feminine ideal. The culture that produced an over-processed Marilyn Monroe from Norma Jean Baker is ultimately that which turns music into Muzak, the mellow and watered-down music we hear in elevators and at the dentists office: back ground music. But, when the Muzak takes over the foreground — when it is in excess — it no longer blends in insidiously and seamlessly with its envi ronment. It is no longer inoffensively pleasant. So function the excesses of language in "Dim Lady." 40 Modem Language Studies 42.2</page><page sequence="8">"Dim Lady" is made up of ugly language, which, as Hank Lazer writes of Mullens work elsewhere, exudes a "dotted dense lyricism," "whose ugliness is an ungainly beauty, a disruptive cacophony" (44 45), and, as Juliana Spahr writes, "is highly poetic, assonant, and rhythmical, but not in predictable ways" (94).10 The word "cacophony," in fact, comes up often in responses to Mullens work. One might say that the poem "suffers" from excessive assonance and alliteration: take, for example, the difficult-to-read lines, "there is more sweetness / than in the garlic breeze my main squeeze wheezes." It suffers from excessive internal rhyme and meter; the line "My ball and chain is plain from head to toe" is written in an exaggerated iambic pentameter, with a perfect correspondence of word to foot. Most notably, however, the poem suffers simply from deliberately bad writing. The synonyms used in revising Shakespeare's sonnet are more or less outdated slang. They include "peepers," "honeybunch," "kisser," "racks," "noggin," "mug," "squeeze," "wheezes," "gosh," and "scrumptious." The inclusion of these words qualifies "Dim Lady" as a dialect poem, one that revels in its archaism. Even the verb form of "hype," a slang word that sounds resolutely contemporary, has its origins in 1920s and 1930s American slang; the first sense, dating from 1926, means "To short change, to cheat; to deceive, to con, esp. by false publicity" ("Hype" v.1), and the second, dating from 1938, means "stimulated, worked up (as if from the effects of a hypodermic injection" ("Hype" v.2). In its exploitation of slangs ugly side, the poem ends up a response to Walt Whitmans "Slang in America," an essay in which he sings the praises of the inven tiveness and vitality of American language. He writes that slang "is the wholesome fermentation or eructation of those processes eternally active in language, by which froth and specks are thrown up, mostly to pass away; though occasionally to settle and permanently chrystallize" (431-432). The slang of "Dim Lady," then, consists largely of words that have passed away rather than crystal lized, words that are conspicuous because they sound old-fashioned. Or, rather, they are words that have nearly passed away, since most of us understand words like "peepers" and "kisser" despite the fact that they are not truly part of our lexicon. Mullen's choice of early to mid-twentieth-century slang feels temporally distant (in that it is almost completely out of use) but is familiar enough (in that there are still people living for whom the slang was once alive; moreover, the rest of us know these words well from film, television, and music recordings).11 Like Whitman, she believes that users, not dictionaries, vitalize language.12 However, "Dim Lady" illustrates how important sensitivity to the processes by which pieces of language "settle and permanently chrys tallize" is for Mullen. As she points out, the language of "Dim Lady" was culled from her "Dictionary of Slang" and "[u]sually by the time slang gets published in dictionaries, it's already been abandoned by its creators" (Henning 63). The use of archaic words in Sleeping with the Dictionary illustrates the manner in which dictionaries freeze and fossilize language (especially so-called dialects and slang) in a moment in time, as dictionaries serve "as a record of social history, of mass attitudes, beliefs, fads, and taboos prevailing at the time the dictionary was constructed" (Guralnik 56). In this way, dictionaries are reposi tories, entombing language. This is especially the case with The American Heritage Dictionary, which makes transparent just how the materials for this repository were collected by sometimes giving the percentage of those surveyed who approve a partic ular usage. "Dim Lady" heightens readers' awareness of language that becomes natural frequently without our noticing, and of how some language becomes standard, leaving other language to become non standard, at which point the difficulty that that nonstandard language poses for some readers allows articles 41</page><page sequence="9">it to function as a sort of code. Furthermore, Mullen aims to re-sensitize all speakers and readers of her work in a way that informs how these speakers and readers approach language outside of her work. Pearcy argues that Mullen "thinks of her relationship to poetry as a project of recycling or salvaging standardised language" (n. pag.), and in this recycling she defamiliarizes language that we knew, that we thought we saw, because it was everywhere. Mullens interest in working with archaic slang and "bad writing" apparently comes in part from her felt alienation from the language, and her awareness early in life of operating inside and outside of different registers. In an interview with Barbara Henning, she traces this alienation to a childhood in which she never felt truly at home in her language: My attraction to the minor and the marginal, to the flavor of difference in language, has something to do with this sense of heteroglossia that was part of the environment of my child hood in Texas. The Southern dialect was both familiar and foreign to me, since I grew up in working-class and middle-class black commu nities in the south, and in a family divided between people from the North and people from the South, all of whom were educated speakers of standard English. (22) As she says later in the interview, Mullen thinks of her writing "as being marginal to all of the different communities that have contributed to the poetic idiom of [her] work, but at the same time it is important to [her] that [she] work in the interstices ... occupying] the gap that separates one from the other" (22). She deliberately pursues her estrange ment from every linguistic position in order to produce work that is, ironically, informed by every linguistic position with which she comes in contact. Her attraction to diverse registers points to what is essentially an attraction to the exotic, and this interest is regionally based. When she was writing Tree Tall Woman (1981), Mullen tells Hogue, my idea about black culture was very specific to being Southern, eating certain foods, and having certain religious beliefs. I have a broader sense of what blackness is, what African-ness is, or what a collection of cultures might be, where before, I think my idea of blackness was somewhat provincial. Or definitely, it was regional, (n. pag.) Mullens writing, then, is concerned with how the acceptability and adoption of language is based not only on race, class, and gender, but also region, among other factors. Her writing emerges from the awareness of how language that is designated "bad" by one community of speakers and writers (or by a prescriptive dictionary) becomes productive and attention-worthy for another, or how a metaphor that is asleep or dead for one linguistic community can be alive for another. Sleeping with the Dictionary is thus dominated by playfully and thrillingly bad writing. I have already mentioned the outdated slang found in "Dim Lady"; its companion piece, "Variation on a Theme Park," also adopts bad writing. Mullen returns to Sonnet 130 in this poem, using organizing principles that differ from those in "Dim Lady." Instead of substi tuting words on a semantic basis, she makes alpha betically proximate substitutions, generated by a modified Oulipian n+7 exercise: My Mickey Mouse ears are nothing like sonar. Colorado is far less rusty than Walt's lyric riddles. If sorrow is wintergreen, well then Walt's breakdancers are dunderheads. 42 Modem Language Studies 42.2</page><page sequence="10">If hoecakes are Wonder Bras, blond Wonder Bras grow on Walt's hornytoad. I have seen roadkill dam aged, riddled and wintergreen, but no such roadkill see I in Walts checkbook. And in some purchases there is more deliber ation than in the bargains that my Mickey Mouse redeems. I love to herd Walt s sheep, yet well I know that muskrats have a far more platonic sonogram. I grant I never saw a googolplex groan. My Mickey Mouse, when Walt waddles, trips on garbanzos. And yet, by halogen-light, I think my loneliness as reckless as any souvenir bought with free coupons. We end up here with what appears to be even more nonsense than in "Dim Lady." Still, even amidst the nonsense that is "Variation on a Theme Park," there is some contextual sense: "mouse," "ears," and "sonar" could, and perhaps should, belong to the same sentence (perhaps evoking a bat?), even if they were chosen mainly for their proximity to "mistress," "eyes," and "sun," respectively. Similarly, there is a subtextual anti-consumerist narrative that yokes the Walt Disney Company with "checkbook," "purchases," "bargains," "redeems," and "coupons." Throughout the poem, Mullen leaves us clues. Perhaps most importantly, the terms are internally consistent: "white," for example, appears always as "wintergreen." Like "neon" in "Dim Lady," the sense of "wintergreen" has diverged from its natural source and has now become associated more strongly with consumer products such as chewing gum, mints, and toothpaste. Even more markedly than "Variation on a Theme Park," Mullens poem "Kirstenography" is essentially a phonetic translation in which she keeps most of the pronouns, prepositions, articles, and auxiliary verbs recognizable, but replaces other parts of the sentence with words that are near-homophones. The replacements end up phonetically similar to the original words, but are semantically arbitrary. "Kirstenography" is literally "the writing of Kirsten" or "Kirstens writing," but as it contains the word "stenography," it leads us to think of its language as a code standing in for something else, which is what it turns out to be. The poem separates reading from comprehension: it isn't until well after reading that the meaning is deciphered. Like dialect writing — in fact, some of the words used in the poem, such as "putty" and "shear," are misspellings that have been used conventionally in American literature to rep resent nonstandard pronunciations — this writing inhibits the reading process. What normally happens almost instantaneously for a competent reader (our understanding of how words in a sentence relate to one another) ends up taking some time. It returns the reader to a virtual state of early literacy, forcing a reading experience similar to the beginning reader s experience of "sounding out." It forces articulation, vocalizing what would be silent reading. A few sentences from the poem are quoted below: 1. K was burn at the bend of the ear in the mouth of Remember. She was the fecund chill burn in her famish. She came into the word with a putty smoother, a handsewn farther, and a yodeler cistern. 2. It shook a few ears until they cold talc to gather, tall yolks, shear sacreds, heave a conversion or a dish cushion. 3. They all loved shapely over laughter. articles 43</page><page sequence="11">Here are their probable translations: 1. K was born at the end of the year in the month of December. She was the second child born in her family. She came into the world with a pretty mother, a handsome father, and an older sister. 2. It took a few years until they could talk together, tell jokes, share secrets, have a conversation or a discussion. 3. They all lived happily ever after. As Michel de Certeau writes, "the schoolchild learns to read by a process that parallels his learning to decipher; learning to read is not a result of learning to decipher: reading meaning and deciphering letters correspond to two different activities, even if they intersect" (168). When "sounding out" words, a reader is decoding, not reading. When we read "Kirstenography," we end up mimicking this process on a larger scale: we are not sounding out letter by letter, but word by word. We must arrange mean ingless words together to form larger structures and phrases — for example, "bend of the ear" sounds like "end of the year" — in order to provide ourselves with the context we need for translation. Meaning is only generated by the reader once he or she rec ognizes pieces of narratives that are part of his or her oral inheritance; to quote de Certeau, "cultural memory (acquired through listening, through oral tradition) alone makes possible and gradually enriches the strategies of semantic questioning whose expectations the deciphering of a written text refines, clarifies, or corrects" (168). Both oral and literate resources are then nec essary to decode the poem. Although most review articles of Sleeping with the Dictionary that mention "Kirstenography" discuss the poems sound play, it is worth noting that the replacement words are not only determined by phonetic similarity ("yodeler cistern" for "older sister"), but also visual ("mouth" for "month," where the "u," in most typographical fonts, is simply an upside-down "n") and semantic (the relationship between "loved" and "laughter" on one hand, in the replacement sentence, and "happily" on the other, in the original sentence, cited in example #3) similarity — all are factors that shape our ability to learn to read the poem. Like much of Mullen's work, the poem exemplifies what John Shoptaw calls "lyric cryptography," leaving a reader "listening for what familiar words and phrases the line echoes or calls to mind" (227). In the end, the poem is a nonsense poem, but not the kind of nonsense that can be caught with spell-check. In an essay titled "Beyond Auditory Coding," David LaBerge uses a sentence that replaces common words with homophones: "The buoy and the none tolled hymn they had scene and herd a pear of bear feat in the haul." He argues, "If visual words were coded into word sounds before they made contact with linguistic comprehension levels, then there should be no disruptive effect due to the spelling variations of the sentence, so long as the familiarity of the visual words is controlled" (245). But, of course, that is not the case: the sentence is much more difficult to read when "coded into word sounds," as he puts it. Moreover, homophonic sentences should be even easier to read than those of "Kirstenography," where the words neither look nor sound exactly as they should. But, somehow, after a while, Mullen's readers are able to make sense of "Kirstenography," just as they are able to make sense of "Variation on a Theme Park." We are admitted into the dialect shared by the sisters, a sort of "twin language" or cryptophasia hinted at by the line about "talc[ing] to gather, tall[ing] yolks, [and] shear [ing] sacreds." 44 Modem Language Studies 42.2</page><page sequence="12">In part, our ability to make sense of "Kirstenography" derives from the fact that the poem teaches you the terms for decoding it. Formulaic constructions like "handsome father" make it easier to understand what's going on, and hearing the phrase repeated gives several contexts in which to understand it. The process of understanding clicks because we recognize the patterns. We recognize, for example, that "smoother and farther," in con junction, echo "mother and father," and that "putty smoother" and "handsewn farther" represent for mulaic constructions that separately — and especially together — are familiar to us. Moreover, "handsome father" is consistently encrypted as "handsewn far ther." And "Kirstenography" ends with a variation on the sentence that ends so many classic fairy tales: "They all loved shapely over laughter" (or, "They all lived happily ever after"). Although many of the breadcrumbs marking the path have been eaten, enough remain to help us navigate through the poem. "Kirstenography" makes us aware of our cultural heritage broadly speaking, aware of the stories we know because they were passed down to us some where, probably as children, whether that cultural heritage is American, broadly Western, or not. Again, this forced awareness of how selected cultural elements become standardized drives Mullens work. She begins her poem "European Folk Tale Variant" with the following sentence: "The way the story goes, a trespassing towheaded pre-teen barged into the rustic country cottage of a nuclear family of anthropomorphic bruins." This version of the story of "Goldilocks and the Three Bears" may appear obscure at first glance, precisely because this is not "the way the story goes." This is a "translation" designed to produce a moment of cultural identifi cation and alienation that wouldn't happen if readers were not forced to do the work. The story never calls her a "girl"; she is a "pre-teen," "the incorrigible pre-adolescent," "this flaxen-haired vixen," "the youthful offender," "platinum blonde delinquent," "the puerile hoodlum," "the wayward youth." We may laugh to see the bears' porridge referred to as "the ursine honey eaters' whole grain breakfast cereal" — it is too thesaurus-driven — but that is because we recognize, suddenly, how we never questioned the linguistic fixity of "bears' porridge." Like dictionary definitions, the entries in a thesaurus, that close cousin to the dictionary explored by Mullen in poems like "Mantra for a Classless Society, Or Mr. Roget's Neighborhood," are necessarily imprecise (A does not equal A). As Emily P. Beall writes in her discussion of this poem, "referencing a word such as 'destitute' in the thesaurus will elicit suitable but by no means exact synonyms for that word — and this discrepancy is often due to the positive or negative class-based connotations many words carry" (131). The imprecision of the thesaurus entry illus trates the fact that, not only are perfectly equivalent synonyms theoretically impossible, each word will have a slightly different meaning for one reader than it will for another. "Kirstenography," "European Folk Tale Variant," and "Mantra for a Classless Society" are not con ventional dialect poems, but they remind readers of that other kind of phonetic translation. Read aloud, "Kirstenography" in fact begins to sound like a dialect poem (for example, in the sentence cited in example #2). Throughout Sleeping with the Dictionary, Mullen uses pieces of various dialects and languages, especially Spanish,13 always aware of which audiences have access to which languages. Mullen's writing, in other words, is always aware of its reader, of who is being left out and who is being explicitly included.14 If, as Ong claims, formula and cliché are best understood in the context of the verbal art forms of oral traditions (38), then Mullen is clearly engaging with these traditions in unconventional ways.15 Through decomposing the cliché, she reformulates articles 45</page><page sequence="13">oral structures. To return to the example of "Between," cited earlier in this essay, isolating the components of idioms gives new life to previously fossilized words. Using the material of oral composition, but rearranging it almost beyond recognition, Mullen calls attention to idiom by making it strange again. From Tree Tall Woman to Sleeping with the Dictionary, this has been a constant in Mullen's ever-changing poetry. Building upon the resources of orality begins in her first book with family idioms — a mode between idiolects and dialects resources — in poems like "Momma Sayings" and extends to advertising jingles and slogans in S*PeRM**K*T, merging and transforming a familiar campaign and pieces of several common expressions into "Ivory says pure nuff and snow- / flakes be white enough to do the dirty work." The cliché is being opened up and made more productive than it was in its entrenched version, its racial implications exposed. In the examples above, the structures of orality are being resisted, but the materials are not. In other cases, such as "Kirstenography," the formulaic sentence structure is what makes the piece familiar, even if the words sound slightly strange. The goal in either case is not necessarily to make original or new images and metaphors (a goal of "literate" art, according to Ong), but to mine the existing formulaic language in an original way. During a panel discussion at the 2003 MLA convention, Mullen admitted to a penchant for similes, not caring whether they "are subversive, or corny and lame" (one could add, "clichéd"), because she likes to salvage all of the devices that "they say are bad." Strange similes abound in Sleeping with the Dictionary: of course, Mullen's rewritings of Sonnet 130 are necessarily composed of them, but so, for example, is "Wipe that Simile off your Aphasia." Like rhyme — in fact, Mullen says that she sees similes as "rhyming with culture" — similes present themselves as a straightforward "this-is like-that" formulation. Unlike metaphors, which she says are supposed to be more advanced because they "don't show what they are doing," Mullen prefers formulae that can be dismantled like a machine (to "show what they are doing") so that readers may reassemble them again with a new appreciation. Manipulating language that is "corny," "lame," or "bad" — such as archaism, slang, dialect, etc. — Mullen creates puzzles that urge us to confront the historical and social specificity of the linguistic perspectives we bring to reading. 46 Modem Language Studies 42.2</page><page sequence="14">NOTES 2 In fact, the title of Mullens book may be pronounced either "supermarket" or "spermkit." Stephen Yenser points to one of the paragraphs in S*PeRM**K*T in claiming, "Mullen also wants us to think of her title as a variation on the PERMKIT that one might pick up (along with much else) at the grocery store" (167). A notable exception is Jessica Lewis Luck, who calls the book "a kind of ordered lexicon or dictionary but a 'dense' one, crowded with different forms, sounds, and meanings and demanding concentration from its readers" (378). Although The American Heritage Dictionary presumed to be democratic, its usage panel was originally restricted to a small group of the culturally elite, including "only 11 women and fewer ethnic minorities," making it less democratic in practice than it was in theory (Ottenhoff275). Historically, the American Heritage emerged as a relatively conservative dictionary after the publication of the third edition of Webster's in 1961, which was believed to be too permissive and descriptive by critics. During this panel discussion, Tracie Morris asks, "How bereft would nonblack language be without words like buddy and daddy and okay? In fifty years, when words like dope, fly, fresh, yo, be as a habitual verb, been as a temporal verb, stupid, chill, mack, max, dissed, whoa and funky are fully incorporated into the American lexicon, will they go the way of pom-poms and fried chicken, in that their con struction as African American aesthetics will disappear?" "Debased" is Mullen's term; as she says in an interview with Cynthia Hogue, she conceives of S*PeRM**K*T as an attempt to try "to think about the language in which we are immersed, bombarded with language that is commercial, that is a debased language" (n. pag.). The line is often revised in modern-day translations to "black and comely." As Ariel Bloch and Chana Bloch write in The Song of Songs: A New Translation: "Translations vary between 'black am I and beautiful' (Septuagint) and 'I am very dark, but comely' (RSV). This reflects a genuine ambiguity inherent in the Hebrew, where the conjunctive ve- may be used either in its common meaning 'and' or in an adversative sense" (140). Stephen Booth suggests otherwise, emphasizing the conventionality of the comparison without referring to the racial implications of wiry hair: "Comparisons of golden hair to golden wires were traditional and commonplace . To modern readers, at home in a world of industrial wiring and wire fences, the simile seems grotesque. To Renaissance writers and readers, the comparison of hair to wires apparently suggested a likeness to threads of beaten gold used in jewelry" (454). However, a secondary definition of "wiry" in the Oxford English Dictionary is "Resembling wire in form and texture; of tough and springy strands. Used esp. of hair, or of the leaves or stems of plants," and, coincidentally, an early example of usage comes from Shakespeare ("Wiry" adj.1 def. 2). As Pearcy claims, for Mullen, "a black audience is figured as producing a specific and comparative canniness: colored hearing colored, sounds darker, back vowels lower, down there deeper" (n. pag.). Or, as Mullen herself states in Trimmings, "Traces of black dialect and syntax, blues songs and other articles 47</page><page sequence="15">culturally specific allusions enter the text from the linguistic contributions of Afro-Americans to the English language." "Culturally specific allusions" might include, besides puns about African-American hair grooming and straightening processes, the following lines from Muse &amp; Drudge: "pass the paperbags / whether vein tests / the wild blue / blood to the bone" (42). Tests presuming to indirectly determine the proportions of white to black racial makeup, such as the so-called paper bag and blue vein tests, are references that are largely internal to African-American culture. Mullens "Denigration" uncovers the racial element hidden in the etymology and sound of commonly used terms, such as "niggling," "picayune," "niggardly," etc. Interestingly, Mullen shares her use of ugly language with Shakespeare, building in "Dim Lady" upon what was merely a suggestion in Sonnet 130. The original word of which "wheezes" is an equivalent is already unliterary in Shakespeare's version: "reeks." Booth writes that, although the word "reeks" need not connote the "simple insult" it would today, and that the word could then be used neutrally to suggest "ideas of emitting vapor and of vapor emitted," it was nevertheless the case that "both the verb and the noun were already well on their way toward their modern meanings in Shakespeare's time" (454). Although many of the words used by Mullen, such as "peepers" and "mug," reach back centuries, they resonate most strongly with the period from 1920 to 1960. For example, "peepers" is likely to call up the popular 1938 song "Jeepers Creepers," with its line "Where'd you get those peepers?" "Kisser" might remind a reader of Ralph Kramden of The Honeymooners, who habitually threatened his wife that he would hit her "right in the kisser." During a panel discussion at the 2003 MLA convention, Mullen remarked that language is made by human beings, and that all speakers are "flavoring the language." Mullen does not treat the titular dictionary as sacred but as the trace of human activity within the language. In fact, the title poem regards the dictionary as a "versatile partner" and companion, and jokingly proposes sexual communion with the book. As Mullen says in an interview with Emily Allen Williams, "Spanish is always in the background. It's that other language that cohabits with English. I studied Spanish in school, even though I am not fluent in it" (702). In her interview with Hogue, Mullen discusses her poetics of inclusion and exclusion in relation to Muse &amp; Drudge. In writing it, she says that she "thought a lot about what is going to exclude readers and what is going to include readers. At various times, people will feel very strongly their exclusion and that will trouble them and be uncomfortable" (n. pag.). Despite the likelihood that every reader will feel as if the text is inaccessible at times, Mullen hopes that "[t]here are other aspects of the book that will allow them to stick with it, to persist through the rough passages. There will be moments of insight and moments of familiarity and connection with the text as opposed to those moments of alienation, estrangement and feeling left out. I wanted there to be enough of those moments of inclusion for everyone so that they can tolerate the moments of feeling their exclusion" (n. pag.). As Cummings writes, "the range of her references requires individual erudition as well as a variety of cultural back grounds to decipher" (7). 48 Modem Language Studies 42.2</page><page sequence="16">As Spahr writes of Mullens poetry, "The creative economy here emphasizes talking differently through reuse and recombination. This form of'talking different' is similar to Ong's theory of orality in which originality is in the reshuffling of previous themes and formulas" (103). I agree with Spahr that Mullens use of formulae is a borrowing from oral traditions as they are described by Ong, but I consider Mullens dismantling of them on a structural level too dramatic to qualify as "similar" to Ong's descriptions of oral composition.
