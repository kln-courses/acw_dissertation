To assess whether total bone mass is reduced in asthma total body calcium was measured by in vivo neutron activation analysis in patients receiving various treatments for asthma and compared with results from normal controls and patients with rheumatoid arthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica. Compared with controls total body calcium was reduced by 13-6% (p&lt;0-001) in patients with asthma receiving daily oral corticosteroids but by only 9-0% (p&lt;0*005) in a similar group of patients who had received oral calcium supplements at the start of their cortico steroid treatment. Total body calcium was also reduced in a group of patients receiving only inhaled corticosteroids (8-8%; p&lt; 0-001) but not significantly reduced in a small group of patients with asthma who had never received these drugs. When compared with controls a group of patients matched for age and for dose of corticosteroids given for rheumatoid arthritis had a similar reduction in total body calcium to the patients with asthma receiving daily oral treatment (17-7%; p&lt;0-001), but no such reduction was shown in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica. These findings suggest that the risk of bone loss with low dose oral corticosteroids is similar in asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. Further work is required to assess the clinical relevance of small losses of bone associated with the use of inhaled corticosteroids. Introduction Since Cushing's original description of the syndrome in 1932 it has been recognised that supraphysiological concentrations of endogenous corticosteroids are associated with excess bone loss.1 The introduction of cortisone as a therapeutic agent was followed very shortly by case reports of spontaneous fractures during treatment,2 and subsequently radiological osteoporosis was re? ported at various skeletal sites.34 The cause of corticosteroid induced osteoporosis is now better understood5 but there remains controversy about the dose and duration of treatment with synthetic corticosteroids necessary to induce osteoporosis.68 Whether or not bone loss can be prevented by altering the route or timing of drug administration89 remains uncertain. There is also continuing controversy whether patients with some diseases may be less susceptible.10" As there is a relative paucity of data on bone mass in asthmatics we have carried out measurements of total body calcium in groups of patients with bronchial asthma treated with oral and inhaled corticosteroids and compared the results with those in people who have not received steroids. The results were also compared from those from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica receiving regular oral corticosteroid treatment and from controls matched for age and sex. Patients and methods We measured total body calcium in 70 patients with asthma (28 men, 42 women). The total group was subdivided according to current and previous treatment. Group 1 consisted of 23 patients (eight men, 15 women) who were receiving regular oral corticosteroids and had been doing so for at least two years. Group 2 consisted of a further 13 patients (two men) who were also receiving regular oral corticosteroids but who had received oral calcium supplements as calcium lactate gluconate three tablets a day (elemental calcium dose 1 2 g daily) at the start of their corticosteroid treatment and for two to 20 years thereafter. Group 3 consisted of 22 patients (11 men) whose only regular corticosteroid treatment was given by the inhaled route either as beclomethasone 100 ug four times daily or as betamethasone 200 ug four times daily. Sixteen patients (six men) in group 3 had also received a mean of 2*2 booster courses of oral corticosteroids, usually beginning with 40 mg prednisolone daily and reducing to nothing over seven to 10 days.

The results from the four groups of patients with asthma were compared with those from 40 controls (20 men).u '? The results from patients in group 1 were further compared with those from 27 patients (eight men) with definite or classical rheumatoid arthritis,16 matched for daily dose of prednisolone, and 12 patients (3 men) with polymyalgia rheumatica17 who were receiving similar daily doses of oral corticosteroids. All patients and controls who had abnormalities of calcium biochemistry or medical conditions known to be associated with secondary osteoporosis were excluded. The corticosteroid dose for each patient was calculated retrospectively from the case records, supplemented when necessary by information from the patient. The total dose prescribed was expressed as the daily dose of prednisolone or equivalent averaged over the duration of treatment. Data on booster courses of the drugs were taken both from the case records and by direct questioning of the patient. Total body calcium was measured by in vivo neutron activation analysis using the Edinburgh Medical Research Council cyclotron. Patients were irradiated with neutrons for 40 seconds while standing in a rigid polyethy? lene activation enclosure. Patients were then transferred to a shadow shield whole body counter, where y radiation induced by the reaction calcium-48 (n, y) calcium-49 was measured for 20 minutes. The patient's total body calcium was calculated in grams by comparison with the energy spectrum from an activated anthropomorphic phantom of human dimensions con? taining a known quantity of calcium. Repeated measurements of the phantom gave a long term precision of 1-8% for a radiation dose of 13 mSv (1*3 rem).14 Normalisation was carried out by expressing individual results as a percentage of the expected normal value for the patient's skeletal size (arm span) in both sexes and menopausal state in women.14 The in vivo precision of the technique was 2*9%.18 Statistical methods?Results were analysed by Student's / test for unpaired variables.

By using Chauvenet's criterion19?a statistical technique designed to eliminate extreme values considered to occur by chance?two grossly aberrant total body calcium values from a woman in each of groups 1 and 2 were removed, leaving a total of 68 patients with asthma, whose results are reported.

No significant differences were found between the patient groups with regard to age or corticosteroid treatment except that the patients with asthma had received oral steroids for longer than the patients with rheumatoid arthritis (7 4 years; p&lt;0001) and polymyalgia rheumatica (8*8 years; p&lt;0*001). Comparison of normalised results in these three groups with controls showed a reduction in mean total body calcium in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (17*7%; p&lt;0'001) but none in those with polymyalgia rheumatica (fig 2). Compared with the group with polymyalgia bone mass was reduced in the patients with asthma (13*2%; p&lt;0'02) and rheumatoid arthritis (17-3%; p&lt;0*001). The apparent difference in mean total body calcium between the patients with asthma and those with rheumatoid arthritis did not reach statistical significance (0-1 &gt;p&gt;0'05). The reduction in total body calcium was not related to the duration of treatment or the total steroid dose (daily dose x duration) in any of the groups but was correlated with the mean daily dose of prednisolone in those patients with rheumatoid arthritis (r= -0605; p&lt;0 001). Discussion Oral corticosteroid treatment has previously been associated with reduced bone mass in patients with bronchial asthma.810 These</page><page sequence="3">BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL VOLUME 293 6 DECEMBER 1986 1465 studies compared treated patients with normal controls using different measurements of forearm bone mass. Though unlikely, the possibility that bone mass might be reduced in asthma as a consequence of the disease itself was not considered. As bones contain 99% of the body's calcium content20 it is a reasonable assumption that total body calcium is a measurement of total bone mass, particularly as it is extremely well correlated with the total bone mineral content of the skeleton measured by dual photon absorptiometry .21 Hence this study confirms that reduced total bone mass does occur in patients with bronchial asthma treated with daily oral corticosteroids (group 1) when compared both with age matched normal controls and with young asthmatics who had never received steroids (group 4). Though this latter group was significantly younger than the controls, other studies have failed to show a relation between total body calcium and age in men or premenopausal women,14 suggesting that the loss of bone in group 1 was attributable to steroid treatment rather than to age or disease. fig 2?Total body calcium of patients receiving corticosteroid treatment expressed as percentage of mean of control population. Shaded area represents normal values (mean and 1 SD). Bars are means. The reduction in mean total body calcium of 13*6% in group 1 was substantial. Postmenopausal patients with crush fractures have a mean reduction in total body calcium of 16-20%,a 24 suggesting that many patients with asthma treated with steroids are at risk of osteoporotic fractures. Indeed two patients in group 1 had sustained at least one atraumatic crush fracture before the measurement of total body calcium and a further patient had recurrent problems with multiple rib fractures. Prevention of corticosteroid induced osteoporosis in patients with asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and other diseases remains a severe therapeutic problem.5 The use of alternate day corticosteroid regimens has not been shown to be advantageous.910 In this study five patients in groups 1 and 2 who had received an alternate day regimen of corticosteroids for the first two to five years of treatment had a total bone mass which did not differ from that of patients who had received continuous daily treatment. Despite higher daily doses and a longer duration of corticosteroid treatment a small group of patients (group 2) who had received oral calcium supplements at the start of treatment had a slightly greater mean total body calcium than those in group 1 (4*6%; 0* l&gt;p&gt;0*05). This suggests that the use of oral calcium supplements alone given at the start of corticosteroid treatment should be further investigated as a possible means of preventing o? teoporosis. Other studies aimed at overcoming the calcium malabsorption known to be associated with corticosteroid treatment25 have shown some benefit with 25-hydroxy vitamin D26 but not with 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D.27 The use of inhaled corticosteroids in asthma is almost certainly associated with a reduction in systemic side effects compared with oral treatment28 ? but suppression of the hypothalamic-adrenal axis may occur with large doses.3?-32 There is little doubt that the main portion of the aerosol dose is deposited in the mouth and swallowed,33 allowing gastrointestinal as well as pulmonary absorp? tion. The finding that total body calcium was reduced in patients in group 3 by a mean of 8*8% compared with controls is therefore of concern. Sixteen of the 22 patients had received booster courses of oral corticosteroids, and such intermittent treatment has been associated with minor reductions of bone mass in patients with asthma.8 The six patients who had never received oral treatment, however, had some of the lowest individual values of total body calcium (fig 1). This suggests that inhaled corticosteroids might be at least in part responsible for the reduction in group 3. The widespread and increasing use of high dose corticosteroid inhalers34 suggests that further studies of bone mass in patients so treated should be undertaken. The pending development of inhaled corticosteroids which have an improved topical to systemic ratio33 35 should be encouraged. The effects of corticosteroids on bone mass in patients with asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and polymyalgia rheumatica were compared (fig 2). Both patients with asthma and those with rheumatoid arthritis had reduced bone mass compared with patients treated for polymyalgia rheumatica but we were unable to confirm previous studies,11 12 including our own preliminary data,13 which suggested that corticosteroid treated patients with rheumatoid arthritis were more susceptible to bone loss than patients with asthma treated with similar daily doses. This study shows a small reduction in mean total body calcium (4*3%) in steroid treated patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared with asthmatics. As we have previously shown that total body calcium is reduced by 5*0 6*8% in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have never received corticosteroids,13 this reduction in bone mass may be attributable to the effects of the disease process, which causes appreciable bone loss at peripheral sites.36 Total body calcium is inversely related to the daily dose of prednisolone in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (r=?0*605; p&lt;0*001). This finding raised the hypothesis that corticosteroid induced bone loss might occur early in the course of treatment,15 and a recent longitudinal study has lent support to this theory.37 Lack of a similar relation between total body calcium and daily steroid dose in asthma may reflect the wider fluctuations in individual steroid doses in these patients. The explanation for the normal bone mass in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica is not clear. Women with polymyalgia rheumatica were older than those in the two other groups and the magnitude of the corticosteroid induced bone loss may not be apparent because of the substantial yearly 1*5% correction after the menopause.14 At present there is litde convincing evidence for increased or decreased susceptibility to corticosteroid induced bone loss in patients with asthma or rheumatoid arthritis, though the position in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica may require further studies including larger numbers of subjects.
