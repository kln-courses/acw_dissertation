<plain_text><page sequence="1">Personally Speaking Influence Without Anxiety: Sir Charles G. D. Roberts -and Me By Irving Massey I 'M afraid to start rereading Roberts now, lest my topic slip through my fingers. A dozen years ago I was searching for a birthday present for a twelve-year- old boy. I was in the basement of the big downtown Goodwill store in Buffalo, looking at shelves of secondhiand books. My eye fell on a set of Sir Charles G. D. Roberts, in a green and black cloth binding: obviously, exactly the sort of thing that no one would want: who ever wants large solid sets of books by forgotten authors? I remembered, though, with some embarrassment, that I myself had read a great deal of Roberts when I was a boy; could my friend's son possibly enjoy him too? I flipped open a volume, planning to read a page or two to see whether the set might do for a noncrucial gift. To my astonish- ment, perplexity, and even, I must admit, to my slight horror, I found my own style staring me in the face. This was where, for better or for worse, I had learned to write. All sorts of thoughts flashed through my mind. (What a trite sentence! assuredly not one for which Sir Charles could be held accountable.) How had it happened? I had certainly never studied Sir Charles G. D. Roberts. I hadn't been taught to admire him-or taught anything else about him, for that mat- ter. I had read other nature writers just as eagerly when I was around twelve- the entertaining but superficial Ernest Thompson Seton, for instance-yet I could detect no influence of their style in mine. I concluded that I must have experienced what is sometimes called imprinting (a concept unfortunately out of favor among most psychologists at the moment). 1 At some particularly im- pressionable point in my development I had been exposed to a style that served my needs at that time, and the exposure had led to what might be described as a "take": in mechanistic terms, something that might be compared to what happens when a photographic plate is exposed to light, or an ovum to sperma- tozoa. It seemed that I had been forever inseminated by the mind of Sir Charles G. D. Roberts, without my conscious participation in the process. The thought was, obviously, disturbing. To be sure, I don't write anthropomorphic stories with vulpine protagonists, and the stylistic mannerisms that I believe I have absorbed from Sir Charles may not be discernible to others, but the 'See John Colombo, "The Critical Period Concept," Psychological Bulletin XIC (March 1982): 260-275. II4</page><page sequence="2">affinities are undoubtedly there. Even my choice of writing about "Sir Charles Goddamn Roberts," as he was referred to by Marian Engel, another Canadian practitioner of the animal story (and, as is well known, few Canadian writers are free of the temptation of writing about animals), cannot be completely dis- sociated from Roberts's choice of writing about Red Fox. Both represent the attraction of a naive romantic primitivism, and that primitivism, coupled with the particular Canadian Latinate flavor of Roberts's prose, is evidently what drew me to Roberts, and made me accept the imprint of his style. It can be adapted to quite other purposes (that interposed adverb, "quite," is Robert- sian), but the perspective is similar, whether I am writing about "simple" Yid- dish poetry, or about "basic" sexuality, and the semicolons and subordinate constructions are still there, with the deibit, the pace. Besides, now that I think of it, as far as subject matter is concerned, it is not merely a coincidence that I have written a book on metamorphosis, a book largely peopled with animals (The Gaping Pig). But what if my own experience needs to be generalized? It may not mat- ter very much if the imprinting I seem to have undergone was helpful, harm- ful, or indifferent in its effects on me, but did what had happened to me happen to others? The question was not negligible. For one thing, it raised the possibil- ity that minor authors might routinely influence even major ones, since some- one who was, unlike myself, destined to become a great writer could have been reading Sir Charles G. D. Roberts, or his equivalent, at an impressionable age. (I think of Pushkin's having been influenced-consciously, though-by the trivial French poet Parny.) It also suggested the possibility that a weak style need not necessarily cripple a good one; for, although my own style has surely not improved upon its model, it has turned certain recognizable features of Roberts's style to purposes remote from his; by analogy, one could surmise that a greater imitator could freely adjust and modify the original, making it available to deeper resonances than were ever considered for the template. Of course, some might maintain that Roberts was himself a great fiction writer. (I will not be dealing with his poetry.) Perhaps he fits into the Fiedlerian category of the popular mythic author whom we read not for the originality of his style or the subtleties of his moods, but for certain general messages that are conveyed with strength by his work as a whole. Roberts writes a great deal about fighting, but perhaps, after all, that is what life is mainly about. In any event, even if we decide to cast Roberts in the role of minor writer, that in itself need not imply that he is uninteresting. The entire question of "minor" writing has been raised as a major issue in critical theory by Louis Renza, in "A White Heron" and the Question of Minor Literature. 2 (Renza could almost as well 2Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1984. It will be evident that I am working with a much more "minor" conception of "minor literature" than Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari in their important work, Kafka: Pour une litterature mineure (Paris: Minuit, 1975). Still, they insist, almost as if they had Roberts in mind, that even an author writing in a major literary language must find "his own wilderness" (p. 33); in Kafka's case too, a "wilderness" largely peopled with animals. I I5</page><page sequence="3">iI6 THE KENYON REVIEW have used Roberts's own "The Heron in the Reeds" as his example: its theme runs parallel to Sarah Orne Jewett's.) The whole problem of canon formation and the shifting significance of "the minor" is subjected to exhaustive scrutiny by Renza, who holds no brief for the accredited works presumed central to any given tradition. He goes so far as to suggest that literary criticism itself could take a leaf from the modesty of the "minor" work, and show the courage to call its own authority into question (p. 42). He also argues plausibly that the minor work deserves a consciously minor kind of criticism (p. 41): a critical approach that takes the minor work's particular qualities into consideration and identifies in them values not available through the works that are para- mount in the canon. At the very least, it is certainly important to find a way of talking about these nonstandard works that does not overwhelm them with grandiose comparisons and references to significant sources; an idiom needs to be found that does justice in appropriate terms to their special characteris- tics. Nevertheless, after all these preliminaries, I am still afraid to start reading. Part of my hesitation has to do with the difficulties I am bound to have in specifying resemblances between my style and that of Roberts; and as I have said, if I begin to read, and to analyze what I am reading, I will lose the awareness of what, exactly, my style shares with Sir Charles's, though I am perfectly aware of what it is as long as I don't try to define it. The other deter- rent is the necessity of using my own workaday prose as the subject of analysis. Not even the most determined narcissist could enjoy the prospect of thrusting his unedited platitudes on a reader, even if such a procedure is necessary to make a point: yet how can one help doing so, if the characteristics of the style that are being sought are embedded in those very commonplaces and the habits of thought they reflect? In order to avoid multiplying causes of tedium, I have adopted the expedient of taking examples of my style from the essay that I am now composing. Anyone who suspects me of deliberately manufacturing sen- tences in the style of Roberts is welcome to explore the remainder of my oeuvre. (Some might suggest that The Uncreating Word is, in fact, perceptibly Robertsian.) Others may ask: given the difficulties involved in using oneself as an ex- ample, as well as the possibility that the phenomenon one is trying to study may be widespread, would I not have done better to take another person's writing as my first illustration? The answer is that the phenomenon is, in any case, hard to demonstrate, even in one's own case, and if one lacks the kind of detailed knowledge that one has only of one's own biography one cannot be sure it is there at all. What I am trying to describe is not influence in general (something in itself often difficult to prove at the level of style), but a specific formx of influence, to which only one's own awareness and one's own percep- tions can provide full witness. Accordingly, in this essay I will confine myself to my experience, reserving the consideration of other cases to a later time. Anyone who thinks of pursuing the subject outside an autobiographical con-</page><page sequence="4">IRVING MASSEY 117 text might wish to consider as a model Jeffrey Mehlman's chapter, "The Suture of an Allusion: Lacan with Leon Bloy," in Legacies of Anti-Semitism in France.3 Mehlman tries to show that Lacan's style, with its gnomic, oracular tone, unconsciously echoes the voice of the weirdly anti-Semitic philosopher and novelist Leon Bloy, even in the midst of Lacan's commentary on Freud (Mehlman, pp. 23-27). But to return to matters less notable, if not entirely unrelated: I will begin my rereading of Roberts with Red Fox, in a copy purchased, not inappro- priately, in Antigonish, Nova Scotia, where I now own an abandoned upland farmstead. (God knows that, as a boy in the Saint Urbain Street ghetto of Montreal, when I was reading Roberts, I never expected to find myself any- where near the Maritimes, much less imagined that I would one day own a farm there, or anywhere else: least of all an "upland" farm, particularly since I've never been quite sure what that word means, but Roberts uses it, as does another author with New Brunswick connections: Willa Catlter.) I will have to read straight through first, rather than assay the text from the opening sen- tence. Now, having gone through it, I can summarize the story for those to whom it is not familiar. The book begins with the doing to death of Red Fox's father by a pair of mongrel hounds who belong to a young farmer, Jabe. Strongest and cleverest of the orphaned litter, Red Fox avoids the doom that befalls several of his siblings as they learn through trial and error the laws of the northern wilderness. A boy, a "friend of the forest people," rescues Red Fox from the noose of a wild grape vine. Then the seasons begin to rotate. Red Fox finds himself a vixen. As winter grows harsh, dangers multiply: from sky and snow, owl, trap and porcupine. Eagles, migrating bees, and pestilence make a nightmare of the summer, which ends in a devastating fire. The boy finally captures the fox to prevent his being killed, but, unable to tame him, sells him to a purchaser who claims to represent a zoo. In fact, the man is a buyer for a Hunt Club "in one of the great states farther south. . . ." There, Red Fox escapes the organized pack only by hitching a ride in the back of a passing farm wagon, which takes him to the secure solitudes of a new and still wilder mountain range. But what of the style of Roberts's simple story, and of its putative affin- ities with mine? There is something I can tell at first glance, as I look at the opening paragraph. The sentences tend towards the periodic; they compromise successfully between Latin and English structure, with a sufficiency of subor- dinate phrases or clauses, but a straightforward, no-nonsense order (that sentence of my own only half-intentionally illustrates what I am trying to define). Roberts's second and third sentences read as follows: 3Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1983.</page><page sequence="5">11I 8 THE KENYON REVIEW The musical and irregularly blended cadence, now swelling, now diminishing, seemed a fit accompaniment to the tender, thin-washed colouring of the landscape which lay spread out under the grey and lilac lights of the approaching sunrise. The level country, of mixed woodland and backwoods farm, still showed a few white patches here and there where the snow lingered in the deep hollows; but all over the long, wide southward-facing slopes of the uplands with their rough woods broken by occasional half- cleared, hillocky pastures, the spring was more advanced. (Harmondsworth, Middlesex: Puffin Books, 1976, p. 15) (The third sentence has allowed itself the luxury of a delayed verb at the end.) Another sentence that seems to me typical of Roberts in similar ways is on pp. 52-53: "The whirring coveys of the partridge went volleying down the aisles of golden birch, their strong brown wings making a cheerful but sometimes startling noise; and the sombre tops of the fir groves along the edge of the lower fields were loud with crows." In addition to the rather complex phrasal structure, this sentence displays the binary form, with the dividing semicolon, that is common in Roberts's style (and in mine). There is also a con- sistent drag towards literary effects that are just slightly too distinct for the presumably homey, "natural" subject matter. "Volleying" is a long word to launch along the aisles of golden birch; the retraction of "cheerful" in favor of "sometimes startling" combines a qualifier ("sometimes") with two conflicting impressions ("cheerful" and "startling"), all within a single phrase, favoring compression over a more extended, prosaic construction such as "making a cheerful noise, although. . . ." (I think of this self-negating trick, with its im- pacted adverb ["sometimes"], as another mannerism of mine: "for, although my own style has surely not improved upon its model, it has . . ." [p. 115 of this essay]. The transferred epithet at the end (Professor Charles Garton suggests "hypallage" as a rhetorical term for this trope)-"tops . . . loud with crows"9 -confirms the impression that the scene is being given full literary treatment, yet without the least sense of artificiality being produced. There is a slightly formulaic rhetoric at work which seems to convey the author's respect towards his subject, rather than any deficiency of feeling. To return to page one of Red Fox: "The music of the dogs' voices, melodious though it was, held something sinister in its sweetness-a sort of menacing and implacable joy." It took me a long time to correct the habit of using a single dash in the place of a colon; and I can never refrain from in- troducing just one more parenthetical or appositional phrase. I must also con- fess that "menacing and implacable joy" ("implacable" comes back on p. 55) is exactly the sort of phrase of which I might be guilty, in my not infrequently gloomy and sinister moments -or, at least, might have to delete. (I see that I have not been as successful as I thought I had been in getting rid of the single</page><page sequence="6">IRVING MASSEY II9 dash. And, in this case, I haven't even deleted my equivalent - "gloomy and sinister"-of Roberts's offending phrase; in fact, I realize that I just picked up "sinister" from that same sentence of Roberts.) Roberts's tendency towards the periodic is evident in his treatment even of a brief descriptive formula such as the one quoted above ("menacing and implacable"). The "and" between the ad- jacent modifiers emphasizes the status of each as an independent element in the sentence, tending to create its own context of action. (See also "the vast and austere dawn," p. 130; "another and less monotonous quest," p. 150; "vivid and spiteful sparks," p. 164.) As I go from detail to detail, I begin to sense an affinity between Roberts's style and that of another author who wrote about foxes, though, of course, in a very different spirit: David Garnett. (Not as different, still, as that of Garnett's friend, Sylvia Townsend Warner, who said of a fox cub that it had paws "soft as raspberries."4 Could there be something other than mere subject matter that connects the two writers, the one Edwardian, the other Georgian? This is another general question that will have to be referred to another occa- sion: Is Roberts's writing typical, in its basic lineaments, of his period? Whatever continuities one might find, Garnett's style is certainly more clipped and bracing: for all the appearance of prissiness in the language of the later writer's surrealist masterpiece, it is no longer laced with the neoclassical stereo- types, innocent of any ironic overtones, that abound in Roberts, and that I must still labor to avoid: "rosy veil," p. 15; "rose-fringed curtain," p. 19; "eye of the morning," p. 19; "school of life," p. 29. Occasionally Roberts will allow one of his periphrases to lure him into the ridiculous: "their mating was cemented with the blood of the long-eared victim" (p. 67). Whether because of the seventeen years that separate Red Fox from Lady into Fox, or simply because Garnett had a stricter intellect, these sentimental tags have vanished. Like myself, too, perhaps because of a certain defect in imaginative mo- mentum, Roberts also has to make a deliberate effort to vary his vocabulary and avoid repetition: the fox, in order to "dishearten" his pursuers, conceives a stratagem which may prove "discouraging" (p. 22). The "notable marauder" (pp. 106-107) returns after one sentence as the "audacious raider." Roberts has a tendency to wash his woods repeatedly in tender hues of lilac and saffron (p. 98 and passim), and even the occasionally successful "volleying" recurs rather fre- quently (pp. 158, 161). Perhaps another generalization can be attempted at this point, one that has to do with the intrinsic character of Roberts's writing, rather than merely with his relation to other authors. I wonder whether the earmark of Roberts's style is not simply that the abstract often becomes the vehicle for the concrete. Of the foxhounds, he says, "More than half their time and energy were spent in solving the riddles which their quarry kept propounding to them" 4See p. 28 in Eleanor Perenyi, "The Good Witch of the West," New York Review of Books, Vol. 32, no. 12 (July 18, 1985): 27-30.</page><page sequence="7">I20 THE KENYON REVIEW (p. 21, emphasis mine). The vixen's cubs "would nip and maul and worry her till patience was no longer a virtue. . .".(p. 29). Here the phrasing goes beyond mere anthropomorphic projection into vulpine behavior; the introduction of the personified abstraction "patience," unexpectedly raised to a still higher degree of abstraction by "virtue" (that is, the vixen was tolerant not merely because she was patient, but because she was displaying the virtue of patience), overrides and displaces the trivial action of the sentence. Of Red Fox himself, Roberts remarks, "In his tenacious memory a grudge was growing which might some day, if occasion offered, exact sharp payment" (p. 54). It is the grudge, not the fox, which will exact payment. "Engrossed in the pursuit of experience and provender, Red Fox had no time for loneliness" (p. 52). This is not an or- dinary jocular zeugma: the abstract noun "experience" is deliberately put on the same footing as "provender" in order to subordinate the physical to the abstract. In another case, the mother eagle is said to be not merely searching, but "questing" along the slopes of Ringwaak (p. 130). Somewhere just over Roberts's horizon there lurks the ideal of a Miltonic phrasing, to the level of which he would like to see his subject matter elevated, so that indeed a Mil- tonic language would not be unsuited to it. The sky looks harmless enough to a fox cub, but it may conceal awful dangers: "the vast blue spaces overhead ... yet held such appalling shapes of doom" (p. 34). It is this attitude of Roberts that I was trying to define by saying that his formulaic rhetoric conveys respect for his subject. He is not inflating his language to dignify a trivial or minor theme. Hard as it may be to imagine, there is no "pathetic fallacy" or failure to confront the necessities of the objec- tive correlative in Roberts. To begin with, he grasps his material, animal, or commonplace subjects in a context of abstraction because he already experi- ences them as embodying abstractions.5 The abstractions are not added after- wards as decorations or fancied improvements on essentially insignificant materials. All the significance is already in those materials. But at this point I find myself reconsidering what it is that I'm trying to prove. Is it that Roberts's prose in general has some valuable tone or quality to which the patches of successful writing are just a local testimony? Or, on the contrary, can one claim for Roberts's stories only limited stylistic virtues which redeem in small measure a general mediocrity of purpose and of mind; is he an author who offers one the trifling values of a good adventure story, but little else? There is probably some degree of truth in both these appraisals; but, 5A classic sample of the stylistic matrix in which Roberts still worked was given on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation during a program on AIDS, on Sept. 22, 1985. A nineteenth-century historian of the cholera outbreak in the 1 830s described the upper classes' callousness towards the sufferings of the poor during the early stages of that epidemic. Only when the wealthy realized that the living conditions of the lower classes were contributing to the spread of the epidemic in their own ranks did they respond, the scourge finally "wringing from fear what pity would not grant." This is a style that derives in turn, of course, from much earlier sources, some of them eminently respectable: "poscia, piui che il dolor,pote il digiuno" ("then starvation was stronger than sorrow"). Dante, Inferno 33, 1. 75.</page><page sequence="8">IRVING MASSEY I2I why, if what I am primarily trying to establish is that Roberts's style had an especially strong effect on mine, should I feel the need to evaluate his work in the first place? The reasons seem twofold, and somewhat paradoxical. On the one hand, I need to show that, if a process something like imprinting took place, the effect was disproportionate to the cause, and that Roberts's work had a ma- jor effect on my way of expressing myself simply because I read him at a cer- tain stage in my development, rather than because his work was in itself worth- while. On the other hand, if the entire truth be told, I also probably want to justify my source in order to justify myself: in order to show that I wasn't such a fool, after all, to take Roberts as a model, I have to show that Roberts himself wasn't entirely a fool either. There would be little point in having been influenced by an author whose highest achievement lay in sentences such as, "As for the Boy, . . . there was not a stain of cowardice in his whole make-up" (p. 90)-the Boy, who therein resembles the woodchuck, of whom we learn that "there was not a drop of craven blood in his sturdy little heart" (p. 148). Roberts undeniably reminds us all too often of what was bad in Kipling. My affinity for certain shallow elements in Roberts no doubt records the depth of my own consciousness in those areas, but I may also have been drawn to more substantial qualities in Roberts which, if more difficult to give a name to, are nonetheless there. Without exaggerating Roberts's importance, one can take satisfaction in what he did well. What is best in an author is not necessarily disqualified by the less good things that jostle it. Whatever one may think of Roberts's formal poetry, there is a natural and quite beautiful poetic cadence in many of his prose sentences: ". . . but here and there a light, belated flake still loitered down" (pp. 62-63). As the pace of the action in Red Fox picks up (chapter vii), the sentences seem to grow simpler and shorter, without alto- gether losing their neoclassical allure. The book moves from event to event with conviction and speed in chapters xiii (drought) and xiv (fire). At times, also, Roberts knows how to abandon his rhetoric for a moment of direct real- ism. The captured porcupine in chapter vii looked as if he had been "dragged through a knothole" (p. 88). But Roberts's description of the swarming bees has an almost Virgilian richness and velocity about it (compare Georgics iv): Jabe Smith looked for a very fine swarm from that populous commonwealth, and he had a nice new hive, pale pink outside and fresh rubbed with honey-water inside, to offer to the emigrants as their new home. Presently there was a louder buzzing within the yellow hive, and an electric shock went through the yellow clusters outside. Among the combs might be heard a series of tiny, angry squeaks, as the queen bee sought to sting to death her young rivals still im- prisoned in their waxen cells, and was respectfully but firmly restrained by her atten- dants. Foiled in these amiable intentions, the long, slim, dark queen at last rushed ex- citedly to the door, darted out through the clusters, and sprang into the air. In a mo- ment, like foam before a great wind, the black clusters melted away; and the air above the bean-patch and the currant-bushes was suddenly thick with whirling, wildly hum- ming bees, the migrating queen at their centre.</page><page sequence="9">I22 THE KENYON REVIEW Attenuated to the transparency almost of a cloud, yet held together by a strange cohesion, like a nebula soon to condense into a world, the swarm, revolving about its own mystic centre, moved slowly across the garden.... (pp. 139-140) The genre of this passage is familiar from other naturalist writing in the late nineteenth century, with its breathless astonishment at the ordered mysteries of nature. (See the last chapter of my Uncreating Word.)6 Compare, for instance, the flocking of the starlings at the beginning of book v in Lautrea- mont's Maldoror, plagiarized from a scientific source, not to mention Maeter- linck's bees (The Life of the Bee was translated in 1901, not long before Red Fox was written). At the same time, it is very much Roberts's own; Roberts knew about bees at first hand simply because he had, as a boy, kept his own hives. In the passage before this one, Roberts speaks of the bees' society in the conventional terms of functional order, leading naturally to - what else? - the classic imperialist move. The hive "had prospered, and multiplied, and grown overfull" (pp. 138-139). "It was time for a migration. It was time that a strong colony should go forth... ." (p. 139). But what goes on in the swarm is far less reassuring and predictable than their "traditions of sweetness, order, and in- dustry" (p. 139) would lead one to expect. It is not just that they turn out to be unmanageable, ending up by driving even the settled fox family out of its lair, after having abandoned their own domesticated condition. It is rather that they circle around some center which neither Jabe Smith nor, for that matter, anyone else, can envisage for them. The bees are there to illustrate the principle of metaphor, which is that it must remain outside any particular metaphor, and cannot be captured in any or in all metaphors. The bees can be put in a hive, but they do not belong to a hive, and, if they stay in it, they stay in it only by accident, rather as the abstract idea temporarily animates a metaphor. As I have been saying, the per- sonified abstractions that touch Roberts's whole silly enterprise with dignity do not represent rhetorical flourishes to be charitably ignored as the weaknesses of an otherwise sensible writer (see, for instance, Alec Lucas's introduction to Roberts's The Last Barrier).7 They represent the assumption that the force of the natural world (expressed in a body) may have something in common with the force of the mind (expressed in an abstraction), so that, for instance, the bees, as they gather to swarm, themselves convey the power of a thought in its inception. Mutatis mutandis, in this "wild surmise" Roberts is not far from the late teleological chapters of the Critique of Judgment (Part II, #61 ff.); we can- not exactly prove that nature and mind are interrelated4, but neither can we ig- nore the news from their common border. The idea is a difficult one to con- front directly, but it cannot be altogether avoided either. As I suggested earlier, 6Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1970. 7Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1958, p. vii.</page><page sequence="10">IRVING MASSEY I23 when we fall into the galloping vortex "whose heat was already searching hungrily under the thickets far ahead" (p. 160), or when we admit ruefully, with Red Fox, that "fortune, having seen him fumble one opportunity, would not offer him another that same night" (p. 100), we are not simply relapsing in- to the routines of the pathetic fallacy. Rather, we are recognizing a principle that searches hungrily under the thickets of nature for a way to express itself, not committing itself to any specific formulation, but testing any that comes to hand-or mouth. To repeat: like the wild bees, whether they pass through one hive or another, the principles or abstractions that inhabit the physical world cannot settle in language; they can only traverse words, occasionally leaving a metaphor as the record of their passage. A metaphor is, after all, only the tangible conclusion to an idea. Like a yo-yo for which the momentum has been provided by the mind's invisible wrist, it is at the end of a process that begins in abstraction, and it borrows its energy from the abstraction that preceded it. By the time it is articulated, it has begun to lose connection with its source. It has then become what Shelley referred to at this stage as the "fading coal" of poetry. It would be only reasonable to object that any romantic nature writing, no matter how trivial, could be dignified by the kind of philosophy that I have been invoking in order to interpret Roberts. No doubt this is true. It can also not be denied that the exalted claims I have been making apply to Roberts only in an oblique way, and not as a description of his conscious purpose. It is only from indirect evidence that I have been able to arrive at such a formulation of what he was doing and of what he wanted to do in his work. He certainly did not articulate such intentions explicitly, though something of the sort may have been what he was grasping to express in "The Poetry of Nature," especially in his comments on Keats.8 Perhaps the clearest sign for me of validity in the point I have been trying to make is something I have mentioned earlier: the complete lack of irony, or, on the other hand, of literariness, in some of the most literary and obviously rhetorically formulaic of his rhetorical formulae. Apparently Roberts neither recognized that these were formulae (so using them as literal truth), nor that they might have been turned to ironic purpose. Without being naively medieval, his abstractions nevertheless walk around the forest floor almost as if they were so many foxes or chickens, be they called "Fortune," "Prudence," or "Memory." So-all in all-though perhaps, of course, only as a result of strenuous special pleading-maybe I don't need to feel so bad about my style's having been influenced by Sir Charles G. D. Roberts's. Certainly, as I go back over the book there are sentences about which I feel immediately, This is my variety of 8Selected Poetry and Critical Prose (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1974), pp. 276-281." .. . the poetry of earth, or, in other words, the quality which makes for poetry in exter- nal nature . . . may work with equal effect through austerity or reticence or limitation or change. It may use the most common scenes, the most familiar facts and forms, as the vehicle of its most penetrating and most illuminating message" (p. 276).</page><page sequence="11">I24 THE KENYON REVIEW sentence. This is where I learned to write, for better or for worse. "It may have been mere rash folly on his part, or it may have been the extreme of confidence in his mother's ability to protect him even at long range; but he certainly showed himself lacking in wholesome apprehensiveness . . ." (p. 147). Perhaps I was like that fox cub, overconfident in my mother's protection, apparently venture- some yet unconsciously cloning a father: in fact, the "father of Canadian Literature," if not my own long-suffering father, who would have made it easier for me to write this essay if he had not thrown out the diary I kept when I was reading Roberts, in which he had found ungenerous references to himself. My father, by the way, was of the opinion that he had learned his style from Gibbon, another favorite subject for analysts of prose rhythms.9 It is tempting for me to find an autobiographical metaphor even in a passage such as the following. During the drought, Roberts says, The streams shrank, the wells in the settlement grew scant and roiled, the forest pools dried up, leaving tangles of coarse, prostrate weeds and ugly spaces of scum-encrusted mud. Under this mud, before it dried, the water insects and larvae and small crustaceans buried themselves in despairing disgust. Many of the frogs followed this wisely tempor- izing example; while others, more venturesome and impatient, set out on difficult migra- tions, questing for springs that the drought could not exhaust. (p. 150) It would be easy enough to labor the analogy by following the frogs on their difficult migration, but in fact I have not migrated all that far. Even if one finds another pool, it can only be the same. In this case it can be recognized by its tangles of epithets, by the spaces created by its semicolons; IO by the proces- sionalsl of clauses, phrases, and appositives that keep one hoping or hopping: 12 "questing [once more] for springs that the drought could not ex- haust." To change the subject briefly: what kinds of social ideals can be associated with Roberts's undertaking? For the most part, he seems to repre- sent little more than a Boy Scout mentality of terrier courage and tender sym- pathy. Occasionally, as I have remarked, colonial/imperialist tones are also easy to detect. Yet these are not all, either. Mutatis mutandis, Roberts reminds one in his social thinking more of Gobineau than of Kipling: his apparently simplified values derive from a doctrine of fundamental depth. When con- 9Their enterprise has not grown any more practicable over, the past two generations, it one is to judge by D. W. Harding's Words into Rhythm (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1976) as compared with Morris W. Croll's Style, Rhetoric, and Rhythm (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1966). 10For passages in my text illustrating these features, see, respectively, p. 114, par. 2: "To my astonishment . . . and, in the next paragraph: "At some particularly impressionable point . . ."

In a word, he is not so much a Fascist aristocrat as a Rousseauist: he demands that mankind exhibit the seeds of nobility it was dowered with. It seems an amusing irony that Gobineau should say, of Roberts's very stamping ground, that Quand la nature physique n'est pas impregnde de la nature morale, elle donne -peu d'emotions a l'dme, et c'est pourquoi les scenes les plus eblouissantes du Nouveau- Monde ne sauraient jamais egaler les moindres aspects de l'ancien.13 (When the physical world is not impregnated with the moral, it conveys few emotions to the soul: that is why the most dazzling scenes of the New World can never equal the most insignificant aspects of the Old.) The irony is doubled by the fact that what is arguably Gobineau's best story, "La Chasse au caribou," takes place in that least Old-Worldly of the American territories, Newfoundland. Both authors are believers in what Roberts calls "the great game" (p. 185). As surely as Gobineau, if less obviously, Roberts has not only an ethics but an ethos: the ethos of solitude. Roberts may not be sufficiently wary of cliches, but, as I have said, perhaps because he uses them so unself-con- sciously they often seem to be mere truths. (On type versus stereotype, see the end of Ruth Amossy's "Stereotypes and Representation in Fiction.")14 In the end, stereotypically or not, one must go where the pack-and, even more important, the modish scarlet hunters associated with it-cannot follow. Con- tradictorily enough, cliche must escape itself; by its very nature, never being at one with itself, it is compelled to go in search of its lost meaning; dogged by the formal dress of sadism, by the dapper enemies of meaning, the true hunter, in the guise of Red Fox, must find a way to get away from himself as the institutionalized red-vested huntsman. Alone with God one can engender the abstract truths that slip behind the cliche, that may sometimes be trapped in it but that will escape again. One must only find a place sufficiently pure that truth will again be possible. But is absolute solitude necessary for such an attempt? We are accustomed to dismissing pleas for aloneness as romantic silliness. It is not possible for anything of interest or of substance to happen to someone who is entirely alone. In fact, all that does happen is that the solitary becomes bored, then unhappy, then confused: pure solitude produces only sterile suffering; the very '3Comte de Gobineau, Joseph Arthur, Nouvelles II: Nouvelles asiatiques (Paris: Pauvert, 1960), p. 337. It must be admitted, though, that, whatever the case for Gobineau's, Roberts's biography does not bear the stamp of moral authority. See John C.

This is probably true. But, just as, for the nonreligious, within the apparent nonsense of every religion there may be some germ of psychological or philosophical interest, so within a doctrine of solitude there may be, even for normally sociable people, a kernel of value to be discovered amidst its implausibilities. What is at stake here then, I believe, is something more than the question of whether descriptive nature writing (Roberts's genre) as such can be great, though this is in itself a major issue and has been much debated since Pope and Lessing in the eighteenth century. (Douglas Bush once said to me that Keats's "Ode to Autumn" was not a poem of the first importance, since it was only about nature, whereas, of course, the proper study of mankind ....) What is at issue behind this question, and more decisively, is the legitimacy of solitude: of a notion such as that of, say, Captain Joshua Slocum, of sailing alone around the world. The concern with solitude is, as is well known, an ubi- quitous concomitant of Canadian culture, for all of Canada's recent urbaniza- tion. Until some three million square miles of the North have melted, the sense of isolation or loneliness, whether romantic, existential, or practical, will re- main a necessary ingredient of Canadian consciousness, an ingredient perhaps best exemplified in the "Susanna Moodie" poems of Margaret Atwood. What still has to be decided is whether this fact implies that the Canadian genius labors under a fatal disability, as Edgar Friedenberg, for instance, maintains in Deference to Authority. An alternative possibility is that a philosophy of solitude may entail experiences that have their own importance and their own profundity. Such questions are implicit throughout Roberts's work, for example, in the sixth chapter of Red Fox. After their heroic cooperation in the defeat of a snowy owl that had attacked the vixen, the foxes creep back into their lair, dragging their fearsome prize. A wandering mink slips by, eyes the vast white shape lying in the mouth of the burrow, and darts into his runway beneath the ice of the brook. "And the bright emptiness of the cold settled down once more upon the forest" (p. 79). That bright emptiness is what remains after even the most intimate and intense collaboration. It is something that can be perceived by only one mind.'5 It cannot be known in the sharing, and it negates all mutuality, as well as the very basis for ideas concerning intersubjectivity. We need to be with someone else in order to think and in order to create, but we probably indulge an illusion when we believe that we think or create with someone else. This conviction of mine may even help to explain my choice of topic for this essay, as well as my title. I may have learned something of my style from Roberts, but in the end there is no possible association between us, because minds stand separate: there can be no "anxiety of influence" where there is, in the end and necessarily, only radical detachment. My renewed '5See chapter III, on literature and the monad, of my forthcoming book, Find You the Vir- tue (Fairfax, Virginia: George Mason University Press).</page><page sequence="14">IRVING MASSEY 127 awareness of Roberts came about simply through an accident; I had forgotten him for forty years. The presence, the assistance, or the emotional cooperation of another person may be necessary at some point to enable us to think or work in a certain way, but it may be only in the begetting and conceiving of children that we actually produce something together. Alone, and knowing that no mind can participate with another's in creation, we pretend, in play with each other, that we make something collectively. We borrow to beget - not jointly engender - beauty. Feeding on the immediate past of a rela- tionship, or strengthened by it, at the moment of creation we turn to God and ourselves for actual inspiration, even when it seems to be coming from another person. So the eventual solitude of the fox is like the condition that we are necessarily in when we need to communicate with the sources of knowledge, and no one can do more. Emerging from the snowstorms of our confusion, our days are, again necessarily, always such as are followed by "a clear sky of steel and buff that promise[d] . . . a night of merciless cold . . ." (p. 99). Roberts may be a minor author; nevertheless, he provides, whether by choice or by accident, a conduit for a kind of perception that has to be taken seriously, together with the predicaments that it forces us to recognize.16 The history of my relationship with Sir Charles G. D. Roberts has afforded me an opportunity to glance back over, if not to reconsider thoroughly, a number of issues that have been of concern to me at various times. These in- clude the following possibilities, in the order in which they are mentioned in this essay: that some features of style may be learned by imprinting; that we may need to develop a specialized approach to the field of "minor literature"; that the relation of abstraction to personification as well as to metaphor needs to be reassessed, along with the relation of stereotypes to meaning; finally, that, despite the frequent popularity of existentialism during the past century, the condition of solitude still has some dimensions that have not been, and ought to be, explored. From the point of view of aesthetics, the most important of these prob- lems is undoubtedly the relation of abstraction to metaphor, where I suggest a change of balance in favor of abstraction, proposing that the literary metaphor is like the Shelleyan "ash" ("Ode to the West Wind") or "fading coal" ("Defence of Poetry"). From a more general point of view, the most significant of the topics con- sidered would seem to be the importance of solitude, and, in terms of my title, the relation, if any, of that question to the problem of influence. I seem at the same time to acknowledge an extreme form of influence and to deny influence entirely. On the one hand, I speak of having had Roberts's style "printed" on 161 would like to thank Professors Richard Abrams, Ann Colley, and Albert Cook, as well as Rachel Massey, for their helpful suggestions.</page><page sequence="15">128 THE KENYON REVIEW me -certainly in some sense a social experience. On the other hand, I deny the presence of the conditions that usually accompany influence: a struggle either to acquire or reject a style, dependence, anxiety, or resentment. Not having been aware that Roberts's style had affected me, I could not very well have been anxious about its influence. That influence, having been both uncon- scious and completely forgotten, did not even really leave me in a state of con- tinuing relation to my model. One might argue, though, that beyond a certain point there never is, in any case, such a relation; faced with certain necessities, one finds that one has no sources. There is no Virgil behind one, nor, for that matter, is there a Beatrice before. I have been suggesting that the condition of solitude implied in Roberts's writing is, in some respects, a more realistic basis for a philosophy of creation than the condition of sociality. In a word, the model that Roberts's writing would have provided, had I studied it with a view to imitating it, would have been the same one I arrived at by forgetting it: the model of radical isola- tion. It was, in a sense, the very fact of my alienation from my source, rather than any prolonged involvement with Roberts's work, which guaranteed that my thinking would be, in the end, consistent with his own.</page></plain_text>
