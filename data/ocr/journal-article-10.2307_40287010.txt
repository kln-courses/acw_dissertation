<plain_text><page sequence="1">86 THE LIGHTNING BROTHERS PROJECT : THE 1988 AND 1989 FIELD SEASONS Bruno David1, Ian McNiven2, Josephine Flood3, Val Attenbrow4 and Robin Frost5 INTRODUCTION In 1988 we began a research project in Wardaman country, Northern Territory (Fig.1). The project centres on the rock art located to the immediate northeast of the Victoria River and to the south of Katherine. The rock art itself currently forms an integral part of Wardaman lore, and is largely seen by Wardaman people not so much as 'art' but as an expression of the land and of the Dreaming beings which give identity to the land (cf. Frost et ai in press; Merlan 1989). As our research interests combined both archaeological and anthropological aspects, we were interested from the onset in documenting not only the rock art, but also aspects of the contemporary narrative tradition which today gives the art meaning to Wardaman people. This paper introduces the various research questions which have given rise to the project, outlines the fieldwork undertaken during the first two field seasons in Wardaman country, and documents some preliminary results of this research. SOME THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS A central issue in the Lightning Brothers project concerns our interest in exploring patterns of change and stability in Aboriginal prehistory, an interest which we wish to research through an investigation of rock art. More specifically, we are interested in investigating dynamics of land use through space and time, including analyses of inter-regional alliances and resource use, in what is today Wardaman country. This involves a primary commitment to the investigation of the establishment and breakdown of continuities and discontinuities in the distribution of archaeological materials through time and space. We began the project understanding that it had become customary amongst Australian archaeologists to look at changes in prehistoric Aboriginal society as the sum of a series of relatively distinct 'traditions' (e.g. Flood 1983; Mulvaney 1975; White and O'Connell 1982). Although dissatisfaction with such approaches has become more common in recent literature (and this is perhaps most evident in discussions which followed the 'Intensification Debate' [cf. Beaton 1983; Lourandos 1983, 1984]), we are still often confronted with a dual division of Australian Aboriginal prehistory at the expense of an investigation of the possible social dynamics which may have resulted in the observed changes. It may be that Aboriginal prehistory in many parts of Australia can be divided into two or more temporal units, but it does not follow that an adequate understanding of the past will result from a simple classification of the socio-cultural traits that make up each temporal unit. On the contrary, an understanding of Aboriginal society, both past and present, can result only from an understanding of the processes that lead to the maintenance of certain traits and of modifications or total abandonment of others. In other words, we must enquire how things become, and to do so we must understand the conditions under which they (1) originate, and (2) are retained or rejected. The basic premise underlying the Lightning Brothers project is therefore that to understand the origins of any new socio-cultural trait, we must go beyond the trait itself, to an understanding of the historical contexts under which it originated.</page><page sequence="2">David. McNiven, Flood, Attenbrow and Frost 87 Figure 1 Location of study area Underlying our long-term aims is the belief that the structure of material behaviour is an expression of socio-cultural identity (Hodder's [1986] material culture as meaningfully constituted). If this is so. changes in the structure of material items reflect changes in the structure of behaviour. Consequently, an identification of prehistoric change in social landscapes will benefit from an investigation of the structure of material items, as well as from an analysis of changes in the items themselves. In this spirit, the current project began as an examination not only of the forms of paintings, stencils and engravings in Wardaman country, but of the organisation of pictures on rock surfaces and across the broader landscape. The identification of structure in the archaeological record through time and space may prove vital to understanding changes in human behaviour through the course of the prehistory of the region. Yet before structural changes can be investigated, we must firstly be able to identify the relative (at least) antiquity of each art form on a rock wall, keeping in mind that any rock surface (with or without pre-existing rock pictures) forms an already structured canvas upon which new structures are added. In other words, we must begin by identifying rock picture types and their relative and/or absolute antiquity We have tackled this problem in a number of ways. During the 1988 field season, we concentrated entirely on field surveys and on the recording of rock art and contemporary oral traditions (with the help of anthropologist and linguist Francesca Merlan, Anthropology Department, University of Sydney). By completion of that year, 83 sites located around Yingalarri (Ingaladdi) were recorded, with the addition of six sites from the Jalijbang area (19 km from Yingalarri). The reasons for concentrating research around Yingalarri was to try to obtain as much information as possible on rock picture types in a single area, including the documentation of a large sample of super-impositions upon which a relative chronology could be built. Some preliminary results of this work have been published elsewhere (David et ai 1990a; David et ai 1990b; Flood et ai in press; Frost et ai in press; Merlan 1989), work having concentrated so far on the construction of rock picture typologies. Preliminary conclusions so far include a fundamental proposition with respect to the nature of changes in rock art forms: whilst there may have been important technical changes as well as changes in picture forms, the spatial (intra-regional) distribution of the dominant picture forms and</page><page sequence="3">88 The Lightning Brothers Project techniques appears to have been extensive throughout the duration of the painting/ engraving/stencilling tradition in what is now Wardaman country and beyond. Both the paintings and engravings appear to have close affinities with the art to the west and south of Wardaman country, but not to the north. Although we still have little indication of the antiquity of engravings, Mulvaney's (1975) excavations at Yingalarri 1 (Ingaladdi) revealed engraved sandstone fragments in pre-5000 BP contexts, indicating that this art form has at least this antiquity. Paintings of various forms have been dated at a number of sites (see below) to more recent times. This may indicate that during this time there have been close cultural contacts with the west and south (given a westerly and southerly distribution of such engraved and painted forms), and that there have been no major changes in the broad structure of inter- regional alliance networks through the broader region during this period. This point, however, needs considerably more attention before it is to be accepted uncritically. In order to shed more light on the antiquity of the rock art currently located in Wardaman country, we therefore concentrated in 1989 on investigations of the chronology of the rock art. This involved excavation as well as further rock art and site recording. Four excavations were undertaken: (1 ) Yiwarlarlay 1 . This site is located on Delamere Station, and is also known as the Lightning Brothers site (Arndt 1962). It is a medium-sized shelter located in a sandstone outcrop. The shelter walls are covered with engravings and paintings, many of which are today flaking off the walls. The site was excavated by B. David and I. McNiven. It was excavated as it contained examples of a painting type which we needed to date: two extremely large striped anthropomorphs (one over 4 m high, and one possessing a headdress) who are associated with a large number of zoomorphs and other anthropomorphs (often female) around them. Such paintings are extremely important in current Wardaman narrative tradition, and are found in a relatively large number of site complexes throughout Wardaman country and nearby Victoria River region (cf. David étal. 1990b; Frost etal. in press; Lewis and Rose 1988). At Yiwarlarlay 1 the paintings are exfoliating from the rock wall, and it was hoped that excavations would reveal in situ fragments of both painted and unpainted cortex in the deposit. This proved to be the case: whereas unpainted cortex was found throughout the excavated deposits, painted cortex was found only in post-European levels. Thusarchaeologically, it is concluded that the Lightning Brothers paintings are a post-European phenomenon, although it does not necessarily follow that the story system is post-European. On the contrary, given that paintings are only one expression of the landscape to current Wardaman people, it is likely that the Yiwarlarlay region has for long been of importance to local Aboriginal people (although its prehistoric Dreaming affiliations remain unknown), but that it was not until population displacements late last century and earlier this century that the identity of the land was shown in the shape of the painted Lightning Brothers. In other words, the post-European emergence of large, paired, striped figures at Yiwarlarlay may signal the emergence of a specific type of territorial marker there. This point has been briefly discussed elsewhere (David et al. 1990b), and forms a focus of the 1990 field season. Two radiocarbon results have been obtained for this site: Modern (Wk-1549), dating the beginnings of high deposition rates of all cultural materials; and, 444 ± 87 BP (R11882, NZA860), near the base of occupation deposits. (2) Delamere 3. This shelter is also located at Yiwarlarlay, but occurs on the opposite side of the sandstone outcrop in which Yiwarlarlay 1 is found. The excavations (by I. McNiven) were undertaken at this site for comparisons with the Yiwarlarlay 1 excavations. Furthermore, exfoliating engravings at Delamere 3 offered the opportunity to provide a minimum age for the engravings through the extraction of micro-particles of organic matter from the cortex which has accumulated over the engravings. Alan Watchman (A.N.U.) is currently analysing cortex from this site in the hope that enough datable material can be obtained. Two radiocarbon dates have been obtained from this excavation: 380 ± 60 BP (Wk-1672), which</page><page sequence="4">David, McNiven, Rood, Attenbrow and Frost 89 dates the beginnings of high deposition rates of cultural materials at the site; and Modern (R1 1948, NZA1 1 65), being an AMS date from a tiny charcoal fragment found in a crack in the bedrock near the base of occupational deposits. This sample may well have fallen from the surface during excavation as this area was generally devoid of in situ charcoal. It is treated as a post- depositions intrusion given its location below sample Wk-1672 and its anomalous stratigraphie location. This date, along with a full report on the Delamere 3 excavations, will be further discussed in a future site report. (3) Mennge-ya 1. This site was excavated by V. Attenbrow and B. David. Its rock wall contains two large paired, striped anthropomorphs and associated figures (Fig.2). The painted surfaces do not appear to be exfoliating (unlike that at Yiwarlarlay 1 ), but nodules of used ochre were recovered from the upper units of the excavation, indicating a possible recent antiquity for the paintings. The material excavated from this site is not yet fully analysed, and radiocarbon dates have not yet been obtained. Figure 2 Striped figures at Mennge-va. Val Attenbrow excavating (photo by Bruno David, published with permission of the Wardanian Council) (4) Jalijbang 2. Jalijbang 2, located near Mennge-ya 1 , has a rock wall containing a number of Cleland Hills-type pecked faces. The rock art from this site has been reported by Lewis and McCausland (1987) who suggest that it may be related in some way to similar motifs found near Alice Springs. Given their hypothesised great antiquity near Alice Springs, the engravings at Jalijbang 2 may also have considerable antiquity. Since Jalijbang 2 was the</page><page sequence="5">90 The Lightning Brothers Project first site known to have this motif type associated with occupational deposits, we were hoping that the excavations may have revealed something about its antiquity. Material from the Jalijbang 2 excavations (undertaken by B. David) are still being analysed, but conclusions that can be drawn from this excavation to date include the following: (a) the radiocarbon dates obtained from the excavation show that occupation began some- time before 1000 BP; (b) although pecked trident/bird track shapes and abraded grooves may have considerable antiquity in the region, they continued to be made during the mid- to late-Holocene; and (c) pecked faces at the site are likely to post-date the mid-Holocene, as one such face occurs on a low boulder in the river bed. It is unlikely that the pecking would have survived the significantly wetter pre-3000 BP conditions. In addition, the present regime of annual flooding, and weathering through water action today, makes it likely that this pecking is considerably younger. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH By documenting the (pre-) historical contexts under which certain rock art forms have emerged we hope to get a better understanding of the socio-cultural conditions of change and stability in the prehistory of the region. A fundamental aspect of this is an understanding of the nature of past and present alliance networks, which are currently being investigated through analyses of the distribution of rock art forms and techniques through space and time. So far, preliminary analyses of the distribution of rock paintings around the Yingalarri waterhole has failed to identify any major change in painting types through time (David et al. 1 990a). The Yingalarri paintings are stylistically similar to those found to the south and west, and appear to be late Holocene in age (the arguments for this have been presented in David ef ai 1990a). Furthermore, similar distributions of what appear to be considerably older engravings may indicate that there have been no major changes in inter-regional alliances during the past 5000 to 7000 years at least. Within this broader context, however, the last 150 years appears to have witnessed a major increase in the creation of very large, paired and striped anthropomorphic paintings. This may relate to a post-contact increase in the creation of a very specific form of highly visual territorial markers (David et al. 1990b). This question forms one of the central themes of the 1990 field season, which is geared towards gathering further information on the antiquity of such paintings. Peter Hiscock (University of the Northern Territory) is undertaking detailed investigations of the stone artefacts from the excavated sites, one of the principal aims being to see if observed changes in the rock art are associated with changes in stone artefact forms and/or technologies. Whilst results to date, in the form of in situ ochres and exfoliated painted wall cortex at Yiwarlarlay 1, Delamere 3 and Mennge-ya, point to a late-Holocene antiquity (last 400 years or so) for most of the rock paintings studied so far, considerably more attention needs to focus on the antiquity of the rock art before these issues can be adequately addressed. It is towards such an end that the 1990 field season was geared.
