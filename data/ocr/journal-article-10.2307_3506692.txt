<plain_text><page sequence="1">Byron's Greek Canto: The Anatomy of Freedom Byron's concern with freedom is a commonplace of criticism and history - by now, indeed, something of a bore. Like Wordsworth's 'recollection' and Keats's 'sensuousness' it is one of those large abstractions which blot out the minute particulars of an intellectual landscape; we cannot see the trees for the wood. In Byron's case there is a double danger. To begin with, Byron's landscape, his perceptive structure, has never been given the attention accorded to Wordsworth's or Keats's, or even mapped out. Mountain ranges labelled 'freedom' and 'energy', coves marked 'homosexuality' and 'incest', emerge fleetingly from the mists of a terra incognita; then the clouds settle again. In the second place, we delimit the few outlines we have. His energy is seen as largely 'psychic' and rarely 'pneumatic',1 as emotional rather than intellectual (though contemporaries, including many among his severer critics, thought otherwise). Freedom is political liberalism - its activity is on the practical plane, and involves taking sides, being committed. This is certainly part of what the idea meant for Byron, and Canto II of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage is the hymn of freedom in that sense. It is a sustained threnos over an enslaved people and a vanished culture - a lost world. But it is more than that. My aim in the present paper is not to reactivate a faded Philhellenism but to show that Byron's world is an inner as well as an outer landscape. Canto II is a complex structure some of whose strands have become meaningless to us today - the idea of a country as a temenos, of a city as a celebration, of nature as a matrix of the divine-human which issues as art (above all as architecture) and as the deeds of great men. Gods and men work and strive together in the Iliad, or on the Par- thenon frieze. These ideas were not obsolete in the early nineteenth century: even as late as 1839 Christopher Wordsworth sees 'the whole land of ATTICA' as 'a sacred TEMENOS, whose boundaries were Seas and Mountains, and whose PROPYLAEA was the Temple of Minerva [actually of Neptune] on the promontory of Sunium'.2 This is precisely Byron's vision, and may be an echo of Byron's verse. To do the job properly I should have to consider Canto II within its total context. In particular, Canto I would have to be subjected to as close a scrutiny as its successor.3 This is impossible in the space at my disposal. Nor can I go into the psychological bases of Canto II: into Byron's feelings of personal frustration and rebellion (particularly against the tyranny of his mother), his curiosity about Levantine sexual mores (stimulated by his classical reading4 and the verse of 1 The distinction is of course Pauline (see the First Epistle to the Corinthians, a text to which I shall be making frequent reference). The Authorized Version translates 'psychikos anthropos' in Chapter 2 as 'natural man'; this is the 'natural man' that Blake sees 'rising up against the spiritual man [in Wordsworth] continually'. Blake's final comment on Wordsworth's I815 Poems could stand as a 'Key to the Gates' of Childe Harold: 'Imagination is the Divine Vision not of the World, or of Man, nor from Man as he is a Natural Man, but only as he is a Spiritual Man. Imagination has nothing to do with Memory.' 2 Christopher Wordsworth: Greece: Pictorial, Descriptive, Historical (London, 1839), p. 128. 3 Canto I, though about Portugal and Spain, was written in Greece and Turkey, and its stances are modified by Byron's eastern experiences. It opens with an evocation of Delphi, and Parnassus is re-invoked at the canto's mid-point (stanza 40). Thus the Apollonian note sounds from the beginning. 4 Compare the amusing account of Juan's education in Don Juan I, stanzas 4I-5.</page><page sequence="2">BERNARD BLACKSTONE I73 'Anacreon' Moore and Hafiz and Sa'di), or his sense of the tour as a genuine pilgrimage - a voyage of self-exploration (though of this something must be said in a moment). One pointer cannot be ignored. The Giaour, written shortly after Byron's return from Greece, is an extrovert key to Canto II's introvert locks. It isolates and focuses the bigger work's life/death antithesis- the poles which dominate Byron's entire opus and which here function as freedom/bondage. Greece is 'living Greece no more!', and 'He who hath bent him o'er the dead' in 'The first dark day of nothing- ness' is best equipped to savour the Hellenic paradox of death-in-life and life-in- death. The poem moves between tomb and tomb. The first covers a true patriot, Themistocles: 'When shall such hero live again ?'. The last is of a failed hero, the Giaour: 'He pass'd - nor of his name and race | Hath left a token or a trace'. The answer to the question prompted by the tomb of Themistocles lies in a much closer identification of a man with his impersonal destiny than the Giaour could achieve.' But a key is not a lock and the simple formulae life equals liberty and death equals slavery are too monodic for the intricate counterpoint of Childe Harold, which compasses many forms of life and many kinds of death, including that dying-into- life of which Goethe and the Sufis speak. But they establish our termini, between which a triple woof plays as Power, Knowledge, and Love. These are the moving strands of Canto I - and, indeed, of Byron's total work, from the triple epigraph of Hours of Idleness at the outset, to Manfred's 'The Tree of Knowledge is not that of Life' in the middle, and on to the incantation of The Deformed Transformed ('Shadows of beauty! I Shadows of power! ... The form of the Stoic... !') and the 'ditty of tradition's days' which speaks of power, love, and wisdom in Part v of the second canto of The Island. We call Byron's masterpiece Childe Harold and forget the Pilgrimage; this is con- venient but deceptive. Pilgrimages are important occasions. The pilgrim travels to a shrine for atonement, healing, illumination, self-discovery. Christian goes in search of the Heavenly City; this is also Harold's quest, and Bunyan's City of Destruction is Byron's 'Sin's long labyrinth' at Newstead Abbey. If we question the equivalence of the two starting-points, let us remember that both are dream- poems2 and that in dreams conventional values are commonly reversed. Byron is tracing in the Pilgrimage the paradigm established in The Ancient Mariner and restated in Alastor and Endymion. Further back, we meet with Piers Plowman, whose House of Unity is perhaps nearest to Byron's goal, and Dante, moving through the three worlds. St Paul too is a pilgrim (Hebrews xi. 13) identified by faith with the fathers 'of whom the world was not worthy: they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth' (xI. 38). Of their classical and biblical predecessors I have written at length in an earlier essay.3 1 A penetrating recent study of Byron, Jerome J. McGann's Fiery Dust (Chicago, I968), re- produces as frontispiece the manuscript of stanza 73 of Canto ni in which similar questions are answered by a fivefold 'Byron' scrawled over the page. 2 'This protracted dream' is Byron's final definition (iv, 185) of his poem. 3 The Lost Travellers (London, I962). Elijah may be one of the 'fathers' St Paul is thinking of, and is worth mentioning here in view of Blake's identification of him with Byron in the dedication of The Ghost of Abel.</page><page sequence="3">I74 Byron's Greek Canto The intermeshing of the Pauline and the Byronic scene - the Mediterranean as geography, as theology, as history, and as psychology, one might say - deserves a paper (or a book) to itself. There were profound sympathies and dyspathies. Byron prefers Socrates to St Paul in I808, though they 'agree in their opinion of marriage'.l Pauline theology is a major ingredient of the early Calvinism taught him by May Gray, who 'used to come to bed with him and play tricks with his person' when he was nine years old.2 The love-power-wisdom syndrome is a Pauline commonplace,3 summed up in 'Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God' (I Corinthians I. 24) where Christ is himself the divine love. Arriving in Athens on Christmas Day I809, Byron finds himself in St Paul's city as well as that of Socrates - and in Mohammed's city which has superseded them both. The triple antithesis has emerged throughout the tour - Hobhouse's prose account expresses it in more detail, though less vividly, than Byron's verse. The two travellers move through St Paul's major stations (Malta, Troas, Ephesus, Athens, Corinth, Nicopolis, and later Rome) with a keen eye for the sic transit gloria. 'The worship of St Andrew', Hobhouse notes at Patras, 'who was crucified in the place, has succeeded to that of Diana Laphria, the Olympian Jupiter, and the Bacchus of Calydon'. At Ephesus, Byron reports (letter of 3 May I8I0 to Henry Drury), 'The Temple has almost perished, and St. Paul need not trouble himself to epistolize the present brood of Ephesians, who have converted a large church built entirely of marble into a mosque, and I don't know that the edifice looks the worse for it'.4 All this passes into the texture of Childe Harold: 'The Cross descends, thy Minarets arise, | And the pale Crescent sparkles in the glen' (II, 38), a line which reverses the Christian triumph of Canto I, 35: 'Red gleamed the Cross, and waned the Crescent pale'. We cannot doubt that at the various stages of his journey Byron would remember the formidable figure who had gone before him- and if he forgot, Hobhouse was there to remind him. Byron's knowledge of the Bible compares with Ruskin's: 'Of the Scriptures, it is certain that Lord Byron was a frequent and almost daily reader' Moore tells us; and we have other evidence. Now Byron's interests, whether in theology, history, or art, were always ad hominem: and in the New Testament there is only one fully-realized figure to set beside that of Christ. With 'that powerful Apostle',5 he would sense some deep affinities. Both were expatriates, both were wanderers, both were travelling from margins to centres. The Pax Ottomanica like the Pax Romana covered the Mediterranean world in a net of power divorced from wisdom, alien to love. In Athens, once that world's cultural centre, Byron found an enslavement worse than the Roman domination. From the temenos of the Olympeion, an emblem of divine power, he looks up to the Parthenon crowning the Acropolis with wisdom and with the goddess's love for her holy city. Around him stretch the two hundred or so churches and the multitude of mosques which Hobhouse omits to number. His mind goes back to the 1 Letter to R. C.

Plato's reconciliation of wisdom and power in the Republic, and of wisdom and love in the Symposium, is theoretical, as against the Apostle's life-drama, his self-giving in love and suffering for the infant Church.1 Byron's adjective 'powerful' is signifi- cant here: the Christian dynamis is implicitly contrasted with Hellenic speculation. St Paul 'bears in his body the marks of the Lord Jesus' (Galatians vi. 17) and 'runs a race' for an incorruptible crown (I Corinthians IX. 24-5). When he came to translate the apocryphal Pauline epistles in 1817 in the Armenian convent at Venice Byron would note the same tokens of wisdom, power, and love. And when, finally, he prepared for death at Missolonghi, the apostolic 'I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved' (II Corinthians XII. 15) passes into his swan-song: The hope, the fear, the jealous care ... -this is St Paul's solicitude; and so is the self-giving: Yet, though I cannot be beloved, Still let me love.2 II Byron and Hobhouse arrived in Athens on Christmas Day I809. The date has that odd appropriateness, in view of Byron's role as esemplast and saviour, which characterizes so many of his avatars. His lodging is in the shadow of the Acropolis, close to the 'Capuchin convent' where he was to find shelter in his second sojourn and which enclosed the classical choragic monument of Lysicrates. Before long we find him musing in the Olympeion: a power emblem, as I have suggested, but enclosing a wisdom emblem3 since one of its pillars had until recently been occupied by a Stylite. He looks up to the Parthenon, a wisdom emblem, but now also a power emblem as a Turkish fortress and powder magazine. This is the kind of synthesis he liked - or which, at any rate, triggered off his peculiarly 'esemplastic' imagination. It chimed, probably, with the riot of antitheses in his own nature. He remembers St Paul and the Hebraic background of Christianity as he invokes the guardian deity of the city: Ancient of days! august Athena! where, Where are thy men of might ? thy grand in soul ? (nI, 2) 'Ancient of days' - the majestic biblical epithet conflates with 'august Athena' to focus the personal-historic, the classical-Hebraic moment. This is Coleridge's 'secondary Imagination' powerfully at work. Even as a wisdom emblem the Parthenon is multivalent: first a temple, then a church, now a mosque. We look at history through trifocal lenses. We look at history, but we enter into it too, in the living present. This is not Dyer's The Ruins of Rome, or Thomson's Liberty, abstract surveys. The spectator is a 1 I am not preferring the one way to the other, or forgetting the death of Socrates; my concern is with linking up life-and-thought patterns. 2 'On This Day I Complete My Thirty-sixth Year.' 3 For this extended sense of 'wisdom' see below, pp. 179 ff.</page><page sequence="5">176 Byron's Greek Canto participant, entering what he observes 'on the Fiery Chariot of his Contemplative Thought'l: we shift from description into drama, from Paradise Lost into Hamlet. So skilful is the transition that we hardly note what has happened when the invocation 'Ancient of days! august Athena!' flows into the peremptory and ironic 'Son of the Morning, rise! approach you here!' (II, 3). This 'Son of the Morning' is almost certainly, as E. H. Coleridge suggests,2 a Greek tout crouching at the foot of one of the pillars in the Olympeion - a degenerate descendant of the Stoics and Epicureans of A.D. 50 to whom St Paul delivered his address on the Areopagus.3 With this 'Son of the Morning' we are still in a trifocal world: ethnically a Greek, a descendant of Plato and Alexander, topically an Oriental, ironically a fallen Lucifer: 'How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!' (Isaiah xiv). Paul had looked round on the sebasmata of the ancient cult, still standing and still venerated; Byron begs forbearance for the ruins of these monuments from the ruined descendants of the Greeks who had rejected Paul: 'What will this babbler say?' Echoes of Chapter Fourteen of Isaiah continue into the sombre stanzas 5-8: Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we ? art thou become like unto us? Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee...

Well didst thou speak, Athena's wisest son! 'All that we know is, nothing can be known.' And there we have it in little - ambition, thought, passion: power, knowledge, love. From the skull we expand to the temples and contract again to 'the narrow 1 Blake, A Vision of the Last Judgment. 2 Poetical Works of Lord Byron, edited by E. H. Coleridge (London, I905), p. I63. All quotations are from this one-volume edition. 3 Acts xvII. 23-8. St Paul and Byron are both displaced persons, both speak as expatriates to bondsmen. Each proclaims in his own way a 'resurrection', the one to a new life in Christ, the other to a reinsertion in the stream of history. For both, the enemy is 'superstition', the acceptance of irrational beliefs and values. Both cast a cyclic glance backwards over the course of history (the Knox translation, which also reads 'your monuments' for 'your devotions', makes this clearer: 'And he has given to each the cycles it was to pass through and the fixed limits of its habitation'). 4 St Paul's 'Ye are the temples of the Holy Ghost' may be glanced at here.</page><page sequence="6">BERNARD BLACKSTONE 177 house';1 microcosmic and macrocosmic, civic and geographical narrowings and widenings succeed each other to mesh a complex unparalleled in English and perhaps in European poetry, but whose nearest affinity is Dante.2 From enslaved, fragmented Athens where the triple theme is concentrated in monument and myth, Canto II expands to the heights and depths and breadths of 'this consecrated land'. Now, for the first time, the note of hope is heard. The landscape itself is resistant to tyranny, has an in-built power and majesty: Where'er we tread 'tis haunted, holy ground; No earth of thine is lost in vulgar mould .. .3 Each hill and dale, each deepening glen and wold Defies the power which crushed thy temples gone. (Stanza 88) I shall return to this stanza for other purposes; for the moment let us appreciate the peculiarly Byronic sense of earth as matrix of spiritual power - which of course is fully classical.4 A brooding compassion spreads its wings over 'the fairy land' (as he calls it in The Giaour, where the exquisite couplets following line 6 give a 'feminine' expression to the defiantly masculine projection here).5 The deep tenderness and the capacity for self-giving which were stifled aspects of Byron's nature (and which he never managed to fuse with any human-to-human relation- ship, unless that with Edleston) find an object in the enslaved landscape of Greece. To say this is to say also that for him landscape is very much more than landscape, and to raise the whole time-space complex within which he worked and which is not the context of his contemporaries - apart from Blake. This is a development of the man/war/nature/beneficence theme of Canto I, but charged with an emotional and intellectual force which lifts it out of the spectatorial. In Canto II Byron identifies himself completely with the situation, with the struggle. Moving from the Iberian to the Hellenic scene, we pass from 'open war', the 'clang of conflict on the heath' (I, 38) to 'the scenes of vanished war' (II, 40); but the agon is not less intense for being muted. Greece is ideogrammatic as Spain or Portugal was not. She stands for the human spirit itself, and what happens to her is of concern to the race. Canto II is Byron's Prelude in a number of senses. One of these, the biographical, I mention briefly below (pp. 187-9); another, the topographical, substitutes 'the Archipelago' for the Lake District, a wider stage than Wordsworth's, embracing temporal as well as spatial dimensions: 1 I discuss this expansion-retraction technique in '"The Loops of Time": Spatio-Temporal Patterns in Childe Harold', Ariel, 2, no. 4 (October 1971), 5-17. 2 Power, knowledge, and love are the architects even of hell in Dante (Inferno, In, 5-6). Dante's heaven, Byron notes in his diary for 29-30 January I82I, 'is all love, and glory and majesty' - which, if we understand intellectual splendour by 'glory', repeats the formula. 3 One of those keen Byronic aperfus which always surprise and delight. The perfection of Greek art is a property of the landscape itself: within Attica, at least, there is not a mountain peak or range which traces an ugly or insignificant curve. 'Form' is used in its philosophical sense, as the shaping 'soul' of an entity; 'mould' is the material matrix of elements, physical forces, etc., within which the form works. The theme is Platonic (compare 'the one Spirit's plastic stress' which 'sweeps through the dull dense world' in stanza 43 of Adonais) and presents the notion of freedom at its most elemental: spirit asserting itself against the restrictions of matter. This is the aristocracy of landscape, a classical good taste to which Byron's mind reverted amidst the more melodramatic statements of the Alps and the Appenines (compare Canto iv, 73, 74). 4 I have touched on this point in my second paragraph above, and related it to love and literature in Byron, I, Lyric and Romance, Writers and their Work, 215 (London, 1970), p. 29. 5 The Giaour is a choric drama and this first strophe is sung by a company of Athenian women.</page><page sequence="7">178 Byron's Greek Canto we are in the full flood of history. Parnassus and Helicon are as real and as numi- nous as Skiddaw and Helvellyn in their actuality, but they surpass the latter in their universality of reference, mythical and historical - and, in I809, in their dramatic participation in the freedom struggle. That this has not, physically, begun, does not matter: the mountains themselves catch us up into a dimension of freedom which is out of time and out of space. 'Great things are done when men and mountains meet.' For Wordsworth's stasis Byron substitutes a to-and-fro wash of warring forces at the centre of which he stands as psychopomp: a punctum indifferens whence life is regained through sacrifice. Unless these deeper resonances are heard in Childe Harold we shall remain deaf to its enormous power over the European thought and action of its day. By I809 power, love, and wisdom had silted away from Athens along the tides of conquest and ambition and flight into bywaters, of which the most significant was Ali Pasha's court at Joannina. Power is certainly here; love has declined into lust; wisdom is no longer Socratic, but disperses itself in monasteries or narrows itself to dervishes and 'santons'.1 This is the fragmentation of the city. Eccentricity is emphasized by the fact that it is not at Joannina that Byron finds Ali, but at Tepalene, a minor strong point. Here power concentrates, but it is 'lawless law' (stanza 47), neither the wisdom-rooted power of Hellas at its best, nor the prag- matic discipline of British might under whose protection (and we should not forget this) Byron is making his pilgrimage. Yet a nexus connects all these power-points. Blake puts it at its most concise: 'Twas the Greeks' love of war Turn'd Love into a Boy, And Woman into a Statue of Stone- And away fled every Joy.2 The Spider, on board which Byron sails to Greece, is 'a little warlike world within', a power-concentration. Wisdom is reduced to pragmatism, to the figure of the lone Chieftain, who majestic stalks, Silent and feared by all - not oft he talks With aught beneath him, if he would preserve That strict restraint, which broken, ever balks Conquest and Fame: but Britons rarely swerve From law, however stern, which tends their strength to nerve. (Stanza 19) All well and good, but Lieutenant Oliver's image is not so different from Ali's: In marble-paved pavilion, where a spring Of living water from the centre rose, Whose bubbling did a genial freshness fling And soft voluptuous couches breathed repose, ALI reclined, a man of war and woes: Yet in his lineaments ye cannot trace, While Gentleness her milder radiance throws Along that aged venerable face, The deeds that lurk beneath, and stain him with disgrace. (Stanza 62) 1 Byron's Arabic studies, begun at Malta (and interrupted by the affaire with 'fair Florence') may nevertheless, taking into account his fantastic powers of assimilation, have given him some insight into Islam. 2 'Why Was Cupid a Boy... ?' (Blake, Complete Writings, edited by Geoffrey Keynes (London, I966), p. 552).</page><page sequence="8">BERNARD BLACKSTONE I79 In both figures violence is latent underneath an impassive mask. But what of the 'soft voluptuous couches'? In Ali's case For boyish minions of unhallowed love The shameless torch of wild desire is lit... On the Spider it is a 'rosy Urchin', the 'schoolboy Midshipman', who 'guides the docile crew'.1 In both passages the phrases I have quoted are cancelled in the published version; which makes them, perhaps, the more striking. Power - violence - is the great deviant of both love and wisdom. Its links are with death rather than with life. Byron distrusts it, while recognizing its universal empire. His final confrontation comes in the Coliseum stanzas of Canto Iv: but this lies outside our present survey. Here, then, as with the Rhineland robber-barons of Canto II, 'Power dwelt amidst her passions' (III, 48); but the tenderness of love, which even they felt, is strangely absent. So is the feminine component itself; where it exists personally, as in the 'fair Florence' stanzas (30-5), the tone is cynical ('The paltry prize is hardly worth the cost'); where it is historical, as in the Actium stanzas, the tone is ironic (' . . . where once was lost { A world for Woman, lovely, harmless thing'); where it is mythological, evoking Calypso, sad Penelope, dark Sappho (29, 39) the tone is elegiac; where it is reportage, as on the sexual habits of the Suliotes, it functions in a sadistic context. The captured girl is made to 'sing us a song on the fall of her Sire'; the sabre Shall win the young bride with her long flowing hair, And many a maid from her mother shall tear. A deleted manuscript reading is 'Shall win the young minions .. .'. We are still in Ali Pasha's world. It is sexually eclectic, and this would suit Byron; but he would disapprove of the cruelty. This is a sexual world in which freedom is lost. The round dance here, as on the deck of the Spider (stanza 2 I), is an image of restriction. And what of wisdom? Exiled from Athena's city, her native realm, her disjecta membra are perhaps to be discovered in the sites of forgotten oracles, or in Christian monasteries, or in the tekkes of 'santons' and whirling dervishes. Byron is willing to entertain all these possibilities. He travels with an open mind.2 There is a sensitive response to each noetic centre, a constant readjustment of wave-length. Standing, though he did not know it, on the site of buried Dodona, he responds with a Miltonic pathos: Oh! where, Dodona! is thine aged Grove, Prophetic Fount, and Oracle divine. . . ? (Stanza 53) 1 Needless to say, this projection of the little warlike world as a triple ideogram bears no necessary relation to fact. It is in the poet's imagination that the ship stands, like the Hymettan hive I discuss below, and Ali's palace, for a power-love-wisdom complex. 'Apollo's rosy boys' of Moore's Anacreon seem to have been pervasively in Byron's mind during this first pilgrimage. Vice is a 'Cherub- hydra' in i, 65. And of course there is the cancelled stanza on Beckford (printed in Poetical Works, edited by E. H. Coleridge, 7 vols (London, I90I-4), vnI, 7), to personalize the paederastic theme. But it is a warship like Lieutenant Oliver's which explodes, as it were, in The Island, into antinomian and heterosexual contexts. (See below, p. I86, note i.) 2 It is amusing, from this angle, to read Byron and Hobhouse side by side. Hobhouse lives in a world of classical values tempered with Protestant convention; Islam is abhorrent to him, and Orthodoxy contemptible.</page><page sequence="9">I8o Byron's Greek Canto This is the note re-sounded at the close of his long love-affair with Greece, in the 1823 fragment 'Aristomenes': The Gods of old are silent on their shore, Since the great Pan expired, and through the roar Of the Ionian waters broke a dread Voice which proclaimed 'the Mighty Pan is dead'. How much died with him!l Immediately before stanza 53 comes the delightful picture of 'monastic Zitza', that 'small, but favoured spot of holy ground' where Byron is able to refresh himself after his long sea and land journey. The hospitality of the monks is noted, and its connexion with the peace and 'pure pleasure' of the setting: Then let his length the loitering pilgrim lay, And gaze, untired, the Morn - the Noon - the Eve away. (Stanza 50) This same mountain-wisdom is implicit in the earlier ideogram of the Monk of Athos2 who dwells 'Where things that own not Man's dominion dwell': More blest the life of godly Eremite, Such as on lonely Athos may be seen, Watching at eve upon the Giant Height, Which looks o'er waves so blue, skies so serene, That he who there at such an hour hath been Will wistful linger on that hallowed spot. (Stanza 27) Physical height fuses intimately with spiritual in these conflations. We note the shift from the ironical presentation of the hermit Honorius in Canto I, stanza 20. Islam is sketchily presented in Canto ii of Childe Harold. 'Some grave Moslem to devotion stoops' in the confines of Ali Pasha's palace, and the Muezzin's call, 'There is no god but God! - to prayer - lo! God is great!' is recorded (stanza 59), as are 'Ramazani's fast', and 'the Prophet's tomb' (77). It is in The Curse of Minerva, with its syncretism of Greek and Islamic culture as against the northern barbarism, and in the Turkish tales, with their Sufic love-ethos, that we find some hints of Byron's growing involvement. We know that his early interest was in Sa'di and Hafiz, and the Koran which, he noted in I807, 'contains most sublime poetical passages, far surpassing European poetry'. His original intent, in his first pilgrimage, was to visit Persia. There is no doubt that the monolithic faith of Islam appealed to him, as did the solemn beauty of its graveyards and mosques and its bisexual permissiveness. Reading the second volume of Professor Clarke's Travels (1812) he writes to congratulate him: 'I doat upon the Druzes, but who the deuce are they with their Pantheism? I shall never be easy till I ask them the 1 Poetical Works, p. 543. The poem is eloquent of Byron's regret for 'the fair humanities of old religion'; but technically it is a sad decline from the splendours of the Childe Harold stanza. This is a very tired Byron. 2 Compare the fragment 'The Monk of Athos' (Poetical Works, p. 246) with its praise of 'Heavenly Contemplation' kindling 'her hallowed fire' and the conflation of natural with human sanctity. 'I once travelled three thousand miles to get amongst silent people', he writes in his 1813 Journal (16 November), and Gray's Latin alcaics written at the Grande Chartreuse in I741 seem as clearly in his mind as are the closing stanzas of the Elegy.</page><page sequence="10">BERNARD BLACKSTONE i8i question. How much you have traversed! I must resume my seven league boots and journey to Palestine.' We may regret that he did not do so, and that the inter- lude of his marriage and separation diverted him from what might have been his real life-work as a pontifex maximus between two worlds. III The Byron who had written 'Maid of Athens, ere we part' on the eve of his departure for Istanbul in early March 181o, was not the same Byron who returned in mid-July. This was a more mature and a vastly better-informed Byron. He had seen the workings of power at its centre, Istanbul, and its circumference, Tepalene. He had visited Ephesus, and the site of Troy, and Mount Athos. He had got the feel of the land, its curious three-tiered identity moving between antiquity, Byzantium, and the Turcocracy. Though Childe Harold's dates of composition are noted by Byron himself as 'Joannina in Albania - Begun Oct. 3 t 1809. Conclu- ded, Canto 2nd, Smyrna, March 28th, I8Io', a good deal of revision was done after his return to Athens, just as a good deal of addition followed upon his return to England. The persona of the hero itself shifts from a medieval model (the Childe) to a mythical (Apollo). Like St Paul, Byron can be 'all things to all men'1 but this is a solar characteristic too: the sun shines indifferently on the world, on base and brave, while retaining its own 'virtue'. Again, one notes the Annabella fiasco as deflecting this clear Apollonian progress. We have to thank her for the dying glories of Cantos iiI and iv, subsiding all too soon into the frivolities of Beppo and the clever pastiche of Don Juan. The final sections of Canto II have been shown by W. A. Borst2 to have been written later than March I8IO. This means that the stanzas we are now about to consider are not 'impromptus'; they represent the mature reflection of a crucial decade. Dodona, Zitza, even Outrakey with its wild Suliotes dancing in the 'circling cove', Stamboul and Athos and Ephesus, all these disparate energies are brought to a focus in the Hymettan epiphany which concludes the second canto. Here we are back in Attica, but not in Athens. We desert the city for the surround- ing mountains. 'The City' is Athens, but it is also Stamboul, emphatically hjpolis for the Greeks of Byron's day and ours. For six threnodic stanzas (79-84) we have tasted 'the bondsman's peace' and 'the lightsome tumult on the shore' in Constantine's city. This is Greece not merely in tears, but in disrepute. Can she be restored ? Who is there to restore her? A thousand years scarce serve to form a state; An hour may lay it in the dust: and when Can Man its shattered splendour renovate, Recall its virtues back, and vanquish Time and Fate? (Stanza 84) The doctrine, in our age of 'instant statedom', is not popular; one begins to see a reason for the present-day playing-down of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. It is offensive 1 See 'This day with the Pacha, the next with a shepherd' (letter to Mrs Byron, 30 July I8Io, Letters and Journals, ed. Prothero, I, 295). The 'solar' quality of'the Knight' is anyway not in doubt; it is quite clear in the Knight's Tale, in Malory, and explicit in so late a rendering as The Lady of Shalott. 2 Lord Byron's First Pilgrimage (New Haven, Connecticut, I948). And E. H. Coleridge points out that 'Stanzas lxxxviii-xc are not in the MS, but were first included in the 7th edn., I814'.</page><page sequence="11">Byron's Greek Canto to suggest that states need millenia to develop; it is still more offensive, in our era of faceless men, to suggest that man, as 'a man', an individual standing out from the mass, can 'renovate', 'recall', or 'vanquish' anything.' With stanza 85 we are back in Attica and a new kind of threnos begins. And yet how lovely in thine age of woe, Land of lost gods and godlike men, art thou! We are lifted at once from the flats of the Bosphorus. The words speak of loss, the rhythm speaks of rebirth. The verse is stripped for action. Hope enters through the landscape. 'Lost gods' - but if 'lovely', how a land 'of woe'? Where there is paradox, there is always progression. If the landscape remains inviolate, folly and corruption sink back into it, wisdom and heroism arise from it. Thy fanes, thy temples to thy surface bow, Commingling slowly with heroic earth, Broke by the share of every rustic plough. (Stanza 85) It is from this same heroic earth that the new generations of heroes are born. This is a wisdom of man in vital contact with his natal soil, the rustic counterpart of the wisdom of the city I adumbrated at the outset of this essay. All 'monuments of mortal birth ... perish in turn', Byron notes, as do these fanes and temples, 'save well-recorded Worth'. But the stanza ends with a colon, not a full stop; and the next stanza continues: Save where some solitary column mourns Above its prostrate brethren of the cave; Save where Tritonia's airy shrine adorns Colonna's cliff, and gleams along the wave. It mentions, too, the 'gray stones and unmolested grass' of some half-forgotten warrior. In other words, life triumphs through perishing in its natural context, passing through a Heracleitan fire-earth-water-air cycle, and returning as human to its ancient empire.2 The stanza is itself woven of fire-earth-air-water strands - as unconscious to Byron as they are to most of his readers who respond, nevertheless, to its elemental stresses. This sense of life living itself through multiple patterns of earth, man, history, and art, and using time rather than being used by it, is possible only to traditional cultures. Equally unconscious to Byron, probably, is the fact of assimilation. What, or rather who, is this solitary column that mourns? Who is the heroic earth which receives the ancient fanes and temples? Just as surely as Basho himself was, or became, the 'old pond' into which the frog plopped in his famous haiku, so Byron 1 Thus Jerome J. McGann, in 'The Gaze of Wonder and the Desolate Heart' (Fiery Dust, p. I49) comments on Byron's 'Away with words! draw near' (Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, iv, 108): 'We cannot "draw near" the scene itself, but we can and must look upon the emotional expressions of Byron to understand the meaning of the place.' Such a comment means that the idea of the poet, or prophet, as representative man has been lost to modern criticism, and with it the idea of poetic experience as transcending time. But this is what 'Byron' is about. Again McGann's 'But Greece is lovely even in death for she is the "Shrine of the Mighty" who lived ages before and who live on in the memory that lingers in the landscape' (p. I60) misses the point of Byron's identification. 2 Compare 'Cinis sum, cinis terra est, terra dea est, I Ergo ego mortua non sum' (Corpus inscriptionum Latinarum (Berlin, 1894), Vol. vI, part 4, quoted in Paul Schmitt's 'Ancient Mysteries in the Society of Their Time', in The Mysteries, edited by Joseph Campbell, Bollingen Series 30 (New York, 1955), p. II3. I82</page><page sequence="12">BERNARD BLACKSTONE is the earth into which the temples sink, and the column which stands, like Wordsworth's tree, 'of many one', as both object and subject of a mental landscape. Here we pass in and out of space as, earlier, we had passed in and out of time; from macrocosm to microcosm. Man constitutes himself, or is constituted by destiny, a matrix of creative energies. As surely as Wordsworth was and knew himself to be 'a dedicated spirit singled out for holy purposes', so Byron was (and with much more evidence in his impact on history) singled out at this moment as representative man, as homo europaeus, focusing and directing creative and liberating currents. It is at this moment that the knight-errant fuses with the Sun-god: the 'Romaunt', up to now oddly without a 'Donna', finds its centre: 'Ben sem, ben sem Beatrice!' Canto ii began with Pallas Athene; it ends with Phoebus Apollo. We pass from wisdom to wisdom, but the second wisdom is potent, drawing its energies from the sun, directing them to the earth; no longer dependent on human modalities. Athene was too much bound up with her city, with her 'men of might', her 'grand in soul'. 'The Lord of the unerring bow'1 admits no such devolutions of power; his incarnations, when he deigns to project them, are in the extrahuman and therefore the metaphysically 'pure', the untroubled by concepts: in gold, in the eagle, in the dolphin, the lion, the bee. This numinous terror of Apollo2 is felt right through the range of his classical avatars. Yet these may, once in a thousand years perhaps, be anthropomorphic: Pythagoras the golden-thighed was one such, and perhaps Alexander- and now, perhaps, Byron? Shelley certainly saw him like this, and others in his age - Coleridge, for a fleeting moment: 'his eyes are open portals of the sun: things of light, and for light'. That Byron felt it to be so himself is clear from the whole later tenor of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage: to Beatrice's 'come degnasti d'accedere al monte' he might well have riposted: 'Ben son, ben son Apollo!'. The mount is Hymettus. After our long circuit of wisdom, love, and power in Canto ii we end with a mountain and a beehive. The stage is our original one, Attica; but now we look down on Athens, 'the beloved city of Cecrops', from a 'specular mount', Hymettus, and with the bee's compound vision. Compare the monodic, deprived picture of 'august Athena': A schoolboy's tale, the wonder of an hour! The Warrior's weapon and the Sophist's stole Are sought in vain, and o'er each mouldering tower, Dim with the mist of years, gray flits the shade of power (Stanza 2) with the polychrome of Yet are thy skies as blue, thy crags as wild; Sweet are thy groves, and verdant are thy fields, Thine olive ripe as when Minerva smiled, And still his honied wealth Hymettus yields; There the blithe Bee his fragrant fortress builds, 1 Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, iv, 161. This, and the two stanzas which follow, give us Byron's closest expression of the Apollonian identification in its three-fold pattern: 'a dream of Love' (162), 'Might And Majesty' (61i) 'with. . . brow all radiant'. 2 The fate of the great German scholar, K. O. Miiller, a foremost authority on the Apollo 'myth' who persistently denied the identification of Phoebus with Helios, is cautionary. He died of sunstroke at Delphi. 13 I83</page><page sequence="13">I84 Byron's Greek Canto The free-born wanderer of thy mountain-air; Apollo still thy long, long summer gilds, Still in his beams Mendeli's marbles glare: Art, Glory, Freedom fail - but Nature still is fair. (Stanza 87) Polychrome, polymorph, polysemantic in every sense is this wonderful stanza. Let us circle it for a moment, as the bee circles its hive. It is Attica, with Hymettus as its centre, its Mount Meru. We have an exact proportioning: three lines to Attica as both wild and verdant, as rocky yet sweet with olive-groves; three to Hymettus as also sweet, but this time with honey (nectarous, the food of the gods); three lines to Attica again as a whole, with a distant view of Mount Penteli, and a 'lastjudgement': nature still is fair. But these last three lines are not a mere repetition of the first three: they are suffused with the Apollonian radiance streaming from the central section, from the bee. Byron's own point of departure for these Hymettan flights was the Capuchin 'convent' centring on the choragic monument, a polygonal structure used as a library (a 'bookhive'), and the road to the summit of Hymettus was by way of two other monasteries, Kaisariani and Asteri: the first, dedicated to the Virgin, is built on the foundations of a temple of Aphrodite whose sacred spring, celebrated by Ovid, is still flowing today. The Virgin replaces Venus, but this remains a matriarchy, as is the bee-hive; as will be Venice, icon of Cybele the Great Mother, and Rome, the Niobe of Nations. The feminine component is gathered up into the Apollonian immensity; Minerva's olive is not forgotten in the circuits of Apollo's bee. This inclusiveness is the 'note' of Byron, as an equally dynamic exclusiveness' is the note of Wordsworth. Wordsworth's vision excludes the feminine, and his mountains reject any interflow of the sexual with the mythical, of the historical with the personal. 'Another race hath been, and other palms are won.' Byron's vision merges present with past, physical with metaphysical. It fuses as it distinguishes - gathers into a single arc landscape, the artist's eye, the husbandman's satisfaction, the bee's ecstasy and the bee's unfailing, dutiful service. We smell the thyme in 'fragrant fortress', for the hive is a mountain in miniature; similarly, 'honeyed wealth' is yielded by Hymettus, not simply by the hive. If Greece is 'living Greece no more' (The Giaour, 91), it is still a leonine structure, sweet in decay as Samson's lion, a home for bees. Such entities, having in themselves the germs of their own regeneration, cannot (like modern democracies) be destroyed. The stanza moves in and out of historical time. The initial 'Yet' is historical, but 'skies' and 'crags', air and earth, time and space, rapidly initiate us into a time out of time, where Minerva lives on in her olive, and Apollo is endlessly present in his beams and his bees. Apollo, a literary counter for the Augustans, here comes powerfully to life. The dynamis resides in the structure of the stanza, as I hope to demonstrate in a moment. On the mountain, it is active in the rock-masses themselves, in the person of the poet who climbs them, in the sun which irradiates them, and in the bee which gathers honey from the flowers springing from their soil. We are in a complex power-wisdom structure in which poet, bee, mountain, sun, and god are separate functions but not separate entities. The bee, Sir Thomas Browne's 'monarchical 1 Of which The Recluse, I ('Home at Grasmere'), lines I42-5I, is a classic expression: 'A whole without dependence or defect, | Made for itself, and happy in itself.'</page><page sequence="14">BERNARD BLACKSTONE spirit', sails over enslaved Athens. Too small to be enslaved, he balances the enormous divinity of the sun-god: bees may be seen as mobile lenses focusing solar energy and wisdom. Their hum is the spheric music. As emblems of wisdom they figure on ancient coins. The Homeric hymn to Apollo speaks of bees as oracular. Later studies have called attention to their plastic intelligence, their semantic dances.1 We are in a humming world of time meshed with eternity, man with god, strength with sweetness. This is the world of Shakespeare's bees in Henry V, 'the singing masons building roofs of gold'.2 Milton comes nearest to Byron and Shakespeare here, and possibly Byron had his great picture of Athens and 'flowrie hill Hymettus, with the sound | Of Bees industrious murmur' in mind as he wrote.3 If so, we might also surmise that the brilliant technical accomplishment of the versification is a response to Milton's challenge; in particular, the caesural shifts (3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2+, 2, 2, 3) have a Miltonic flexibility, though there is no enjambement. The stanza moves in contras- ted couplets: (i) aesthetic, as the epithets announce: blue, wild, sweet, verdant; (2) economic: ripe olive, honied wealth; (3) political: fortress, free-born; (4) mythical: Apollo, Mendeli's marbles. The final alexandrine undoes the web woven in the four couplets, working backward: art (Mendeli's marbles), glory (Apollo), freedom (the wanderer) fail, but nature (skies and crags) still is fair. Yet, paradoxically, the web remains intact in its natural warp and woof, which survives the human. Looking more closely, we detect a semantic enjambement working through the closed couplets. This is a considerable technical feat, which puts simple enjambe- ment to shame. The aesthesis of the first couplet is not uniform: blue and verdant are visual, sweet and wild are gustatory and tactile (we feel the wildness of the crags as we climb them). The two lines constitute a double chiasmus, the second inverting the adjective/noun order (and thereby securing a poignant emphasis). More than this, verdant transcends the aesthetic, being not just 'green' but also 'green and abundant', vernal - and so pointing on to the ripe olive of the second couplet. Wild similarly encloses the notion of 'untamed', anticipating 'The free-born wanderer of thy mountain air', as sweet looks forward to 'fragrant'. Moreover, crags themselves form a wild fortress, and blue sky is the home of mountain air. The second and third couplets grow out of the first. This is the horizontal nexus. The perpendicular link, to become overt in 'Apollo's beams' in the fourth couplet, is already asserted: skies and crags are up here, groves and fields are down there.4 The second couplet therefore is not purely economic: ripeness and wealth are dependent on blue skies and verdant groves. 'Thine olive ripe as when Minerva 1 Karl Von Frisch, The Dancing Bees, translated by Dora Ilse (London, I954). 2 Writing 'Where are its golden roofs? Where those who dared to build?' in his meditation on the Palatine, 'the Imperial Mount' in Canto Iv, Stanzas 107-9, Byron is remembering Shakespeare's line. For the bee as a symbol of generation and regeneration, see Kathleen Raine, 'The Sea of Time and Space', Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, 20 ( 957), 318-37. Blake's 'What are those golden Builders doing?' also comes to mind. 3 Also, no doubt, the Georgics: His quidam signis atque haec exempla secuti esse apibus partem divinae mentis et haustus aetherios dixere... (Iv, 219) while the 'blithe bee' couplet echoes Virgil's 'medicatis sedibus' (65) and 'nare per aestatem liquidam' (59). 4 Thus the first couplet of stanza 87 anticipates the descending movement of stanzas 87-8. I85</page><page sequence="15">Byron's Greek Canto smiled' transposes the olive as oil-bearer into a cult symbol; Minerva sounds the noetic note which is shortly to be responded to by Apollo in the fourth couplet. With 'Minerva' we pass into 'great time', or rather into a meshing of this with historical time. But line 4 is Byron's most daring stroke: 'And still his honied wealth Hymettus yields'. A stroke possible only to one who has approached Athens by sea, as Byron had many a time, and noted the outline that the couchant lion Hymettus makes against the northern sky. For this is the lion of Samson's riddle, 'the strong' out of which, though dead, 'came forth sweetness', the sweetness of honey and murmuring bees.' At this point Hymettus stands for enslaved Greece, for life-in-death; it is the positive expression of the 'He who hath bent him o'er the dead' couplets of The Giaour. So that here too, if I am right, the Hebraic sublimity fuses, as in the initial stanzas of Canto II, with the Hellenic sophrosyne: the Byzantine nexus of Kaisariani. I have no space to do it here, but any reader who is interested may take his copy of Canto ii, stanza 87 and draw lines from 'skies' to 'groves', from 'crags' to 'fields', and from 'blue' to 'sweet', from 'wild' to 'verdant'. The criss-crossing this produces in the first couplet may be extended down through the whole compass of the stanza: 'honied wealth' to 'fragrant fortress', for instance, and 'fortress' again to 'wanderer'; 'Minerva' to 'Apollo'; 'marbles' to 'olive'. This kind of'visual aid' is the best way of demonstrating the enormous semantic complexity of this one stanza of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, its meshing of 'contrary states'. I have called this 'semantic enjambement', and we have traced it in the first and second couplets. The third couplet, links 'honied wealth' with the 'blithe Bee' who is Apollo's messenger to Hymettus, as the lark, in Blake's poem, is 'Los's messenger to Eden'. Byron makes the bee central to his stanza. Perhaps remembering the lines of Milton cited above, he plays on the bee's hard/soft connotations (furry, buzzing), inverting them, 'blithe Bee' / 'fragrant fortress' (the fortress should be hard - the 'b' sound; the bee should be soft and furry - the 'f' sound); and then combining them - 'the free-born Wanderer of thy mountain-air' -in a great release - 'Off you go!' - of the bee into the blue skies and wild crags of the first couplet. We are on debatable ground here, with our f's and b's; what sounds soft to one ear may sound hard to another. The fourth couplet restores us to the conceptual: Apollo still thy long, long summer gilds, Still in his beams Mendeli's marbles glare ... The conceptual, but not the abstract. I have already commented on the reality of Apollo for Byron. It is beautifully evident here in what can only be called the honesty of Byron's vision, the quality which endeared him to Ruskin. With 'Mendeli' (Pendeli) we pass from Hymettus into another segment of the Attic temenos: not so 'wild', since this mountain was the great source of the marble which built the Parthenon and the other temples. Pendeli is scarred with quarries, which do not add to its beauty: 'Mendeli's marbles glare'. They glare 'in his beams'. And they glare because of him, or the Pantheon which includes him. The human, even the 1 In The Island (1823) 'the Imaginative Image returns by the seed of Contemplative Thought'. The context is now tropical, but the basic oxymoron is the same: the warship 'Like a huge lion in the sun asleep', enclosing tyranny and love, and attracting 'the Proas' flitting chain, I Like summer bees that hum around his mane' bringing their gifts of sweetness and 'flower-power' ('the... flitting chain') (n, Io). When the component of love is withdrawn, the warship becomes 'a floating dungeon' (iv, I5). I86</page><page sequence="16">BERNARD BLACKSTONE I87 human celebrating the divine, feeds upon and destroys the natural. 'Wordsworth's eyes avert their ken { From half of half uman fate'; Byron's eyes, even in this culminat- ing vision of Greece as the interpenetration of the human and the divine, take in the detritus, 'The fury and the mire of human veins'. 'Life feeds on life', as Blake said; and the life of the gods feeds on the life of man and his planet. This is Byron's Mount of Transfiguration, but we do not stay on the heights. Stanza 88 takes us down to the plains: Where'er we tread 'tis haunted, holy ground; No earth of thine is lost in vulgar mould, But one vast realm of Wonder spreads around, And all the Muse's tales seem truly told, Till the sense aches with gazing to behold The scenes our earliest dreams have dwelt upon; Each hill and dale, each deepening glen and wold Defies the power which crushed thy temples gone: Age shakes Athena's tower, but spares gray Marathon. Now the concentrated, out-of-time moment of stanza 87, the up-thrust of the mountain, where the flow from couplet to couplet follows the bee's flight in its up-and-down undulation (responding to air-currents, mountain contours, etc.), is exchanged for a horizontal sweep in the dimension of time. The soaring bee has gone and 'we tread' the ground, holy and haunted as it may be; we have lost the dual dimension and are in the circuits of history, even personal history ('our earliest dreams' recalling Harrow schooldays) as well as the edax tempus which brings us back, in a brilliant peripeteia, to the 'mouldering tower' of the opening stanzas. 'Each deepening glen and wold' emphasizes the feminine component of the canto, Coleridge's 'deep romantic chasm' in Kubla Khan; our planes are horizontal - 'One vast realm of Wonder spreads around' - or abyssal - 'each deepening glen and wold'. The final line ('Age shakes Athena's tower, but spares gray Marathon') contrasts the vulnerability of the vertical and the horizontal, the masculine and the feminine. This is Byron's version of the Tao Te Ching: 'The Valley Spirit never dies. It is named the Mysterious Female.' And of course, if we care to push the analogy further, into the fields of Byron 'psycho-analysis' where we draw upon the multiple layers of his verse rather than on the multiple facets of gossip about him, there are stretches of androgyny to explore. One such remains to be noted, though its full discussion falls outside our present field of discourse. The original manuscript ends with stanza 92, an invitation to the lonely exiled heart to visit Greece and empathize with her sorrows. 'When wandering slow by Delphi's sacred side' the Lost Traveller will 'scarce regret the region of his birth', finding a new motherland in 'congenial earth'. This indeed is a Paradise Lost to the human spirit. The stanza is a fitting conclusion to this Greek canto. But shortly after his return to England Byron had news of the death of Edleston, the Cambridge choirboy for whom he had felt a 'violent, though pure, love and passion'. As Professor Marchand points out, 'the most idealized of Byron's attachments were those that still bore the aura of innocence',1 and his reference in the same note to Mary Duff, Byron's Beatrice, suggests that these 1 Marchand, Byron: A Biography, I, Io8 note. John Wain's reference to 'the various youths with whom he had homosexual entanglements' is less discriminating ('Byron: The Search for Identity', London Magazine, 5, No. 7 (July 1958), 44-57 (p. 45) ).</page><page sequence="17">I88 Byron's Greek Canto loves were essentially bi-sexual or a-sexual.' I have no doubt that 'The little shep- herd in his white capote' who at Zitza 'Doth lean his boyish form along the rock' (stanza 52) reminded Byron of the surpliced Edleston effectively counterpointing the sodomitic Tepelene vistas soon to be encountered. The name Edleston anagram- matizes as 'Eden Lost', a velleity which would not escape Byron's punning mind. Greece is a ruined paradise, her islands are 'Those Edens of the Eastern wave' in The Giaour, and what one might call the 'Alcibiadic' undertone (the linking of wisdom/Socrates with love/Socrates and power/Socrates) of Canto ii is a formidable nexus. Byron's first Edleston threnos (stanza 9) comes - that is, is inserted - in the very midst of the initial Minerva-Zeus stanzas; the second concludes the canto, following directly upon the Hymettus epiphany. Plainly what Byron is trying to do is to relate a personal ecstasy and a personal tragedy with the total ideogram of Greece. This is his basic technique throughout Childe Harold's Pilgrimage of course, but here its poignancy lies in its ambivalence. Greece is ambivalence - is freedom and slavery, is love and sadism and superstition. The little shepherd leans his boyish form along the rock as Edleston posed against the chapel walls of Trinity: this is innocence. But when Byron leaves the mount of Zitza he descends to a plain where very different values prevail. Byron never solved this dilemma, and perhaps we should not expect him to. The whole of Canto II is an epos of fragmentation. Its honesty, when we can bring ourselves to admit it, is impressive. There are shoals and whirlpools here, bypassed in the later Cantos. Glimpses of a unity - which we saw at the outset of this paper as the pilgrim's goal - are caught on hill-tops (the Acropolis at the beginning, Hymettus at the end, Zitza in the middle) but are lost in the plains; even the triumphant resistance of the Greek landscape- Each hill and dale, each deepening glen and wold Defies the power which crushed thy temples gone -can be desecrated by antiquarians: 'The rifled urn, the violated mound' (stanza 90) of Marathon restates the indignant moral of the Olympeion. So too, in the personal realm of which Greece is the great ideogram, corruption2 and death can strike without warning at the most cherished relationships: Thou too art gone, thou loved and lovely one! Whom Youth and Youth's affections bound to me. (Stanza 95) 'Self-exiled Harold' returns home to find himself without a home - without mother, beloved friend, 'and now the more than friend'. The irony of 'Will scarce regret the region of his birth' is poignant: What is my Being! thou hast ceased to be! Nor staid to welcome here thy wanderer home, Who mourns o'er hours which we no more shall see 1 Egeria topples over into Aspasia, of course, and no one quite knows what to make of Virgil's Alexis; this is a bivalence familiar to every confessor. But neither aspect cancels out the other. 2 'Hobhouse wrote in his diary on June 6 18Io: "messenger arrived from England - bringing a letter from Hodgson to B - tales spread - the Edleston is accused of indecency" ' (Marchand, i, 245 n.) The shock of this to Byron would be great, and the feeling that his own 'passion' for Edleston (however 'pure') might have contributed to his lapse (if this were verified) would undoubtedly distress him. I believe it is an important element (together with the death of his mother about the same time) in the accretion of the guilt syndrome which is 'expansed' in the Turkish Tales.</page><page sequence="18">BERNARD BLACKSTONE 189 Would they had never been, or were to come! Would he had ne'er returned to find fresh cause to roam! 'Self-exiled' is now 'Fate-exiled': the Erinyes are closing in. The identification with Greece is complete: ' 'Tis Greece, but living Greece no more!', the objective correlative of 'What is my Being! thou hast ceased to be!' and of There, Thou! - whose Love and Life together fled, Have left me here to love and live in vain. (Stanza 9) And thus the stars, from which love is 'drawn' (Don Juan, II, 212), stand now in mocking confederacy with time to withdraw. Freedom is lost, and at the close of Canto II the buoyant Byron of 'The sails were filled, and fair the light winds blew, | As glad to waft him from his native home' (i, I2) has become 'The wandering outlaw of his own dark mind' (III, 3) whose journeys henceforth are obsessionally undirected, delivered up to the compulsive unconscious tides.
