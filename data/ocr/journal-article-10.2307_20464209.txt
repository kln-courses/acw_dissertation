<plain_text><page sequence="1">Unlearning the Lesson: Wedekind, Nietzsche, and Educational Reform at the Turn of the Century Jennifer Ham Moritz: "I'd rather be a cart horse than go to school." (4)1 -Spring Awakening As a young student in the Swiss town of Aarau, just south of the Jura Mountains, Frank Wedekind, the future author of Spring Awakening and Pandora's Box, experienced firsthand the methods and effects of modern pedagogy. The Aarau Kantonschule, which Wedekind (and later Albert Ein stein) attended, was the first secular Humanistisches Gymnasium in the coun try and one of the cornerstones in a sweeping pedagogical reform that sought to educate citizens in German-speaking nations. Humanistic high schools, like Wedekind's, provided the spaces, curricula, and mechanisms for molding youth into a disciplined, hard-working elite, whose self-image and aesthetic values were grounded in a high culture inherited from a dis tant Greco-Roman past. Proper initiation into high culture was to play an important role in the formation of national character and prestige, both central to the international prominence of the new German state. Indebted to the Greek notion of paideia, this approach to learning assumed the perfectibility of human nature as something attainable through the pursuit of worthy ideals.2 The design of this neo-humanist project of education (Bildung), popularized much earlier in Germany by Johann Gottfried Herder and Wilhelm von Humboldt, was largely a culti vation of the inner self through mastery of classical subjects. By providing mankind with Humanitiitsideale, with proper values and character models to emulate, this pedagogy was intended to initiate students into the process of becoming truly human, in short, to "humanize" them. In reality, howev er, in the late nineteenth century, the age of Darwin and industrialization, the practice of building human character (humanistische Bildung) was a much less lofty process. This later adaptation of neo-classical educational ideology was informed by a deep suspicion of instinctive life, one largely devoted to denying Darwin's claim that humans had evolved from animals, and like them were governed by lowly animal impulses.3 Despite the lofty ideals of his own education, the picture Wedekind paints of Gymnasium life is less one of humane edification than one designed to subdue, punish, Jennifer Ham 49</page><page sequence="2">and tame. Instead of elevating the student to a quasi divine human state, humanistic education reduced pupils to the level of beasts of burden-as Moritz notes in his comment preferring the life of a cart horse to that of a student. Wedekind most likely shared Moritz's sentiment, having been described himself as "ein unsicherer, ja im ganzen ein schlechter Schiiler" (Kutscher 18; "an insecure, certainly, a poor student on the whole"). Like several educational reformers at the turn of the century, Wedekind envisioned a break from schooling of the past with its focus on training the mind through slavish imitation, memorization, and censorship. Instead he espoused a new modern pedagogy harnessing the power of the physical organism itself, its intuition and impulse-a pedagogy that would elicit and shape desire, not repress it. From his early Gymnasiastenlyrik and his well-known adolescent play Spring Awakening: A Tragedy of Childhood (1891) to his novel Mine Ha-Ha: or The Physical Education of Young Girls (1901), Wedekind advocated for school reform as a means of "life reform" (Lebensreform). Inspired by Nietzsche, Wedekind sought to strip away the deadening effects of centuries of repression and liberate vital forces through education. Schwarze Padagogik For centuries, German-speaking schools dominated pupils with a so called schwarze Pddagogik (Rutschky 129). In addition to establishing order and control, the purpose of this "black pedagogy" (which evolved to a large extent from flagellation rituals in the medieval church) was both to toughen the child for later life and to instrumentalize his or her body and senses in favor of socially defined functions. 'A boy has a back; when you hit it he understands" was a favorite maxim of the time. Parallels between unruly children and animals were quite common, an association that per sisted late into the eighteenth century as is evident in the musings of a schoolmaster in a poem by George Crabbe (1754-1832): Students like horses on the road, Must be well lashed before they take the load; They may be willing for a time to run, But you must whip them ere the work be done. (qtd. in Cubberly 289) The will of the child must be broken before learning can take place. Teach ers, such as the hated Teacher Lampel in Max und Moritz (1865), were often depicted as subjugators, much like animal tamers, with implement in hand-a rod, cane, paddle, ruler or strap-ready to inflict blows on their pupils. Unruly children like "Suppen-Kaspar" or the "Daumenlutscher" in Heinrich Hoffmann's well-known children's classic Der Struwwelpeter (1847), often suffered cruel fates such as starvation, being burned, eaten, dipped in ink, or having their thumbs cut off. Corporal punishment, a cal 50 Unlearning the Lesson</page><page sequence="3">culated indictment against the child's natural drives, was deemphasized in German schools after 1900 but was not formally outlawed until the 1970s.4 La Douceur des Peines As was true in society at large, sovereign, visible forms of power in schools yielded to invisible ones as school administrations invented gen tler, more humane ways of controlling student desires through internal softer disciplinary methods, what Foucault describes as milder forms of pain, la douceur des peines (Foucault 8-1 1). The whipping post was gradually replaced by the stuffed or wooden donkey, the Eselskopf with the dunce cap, and the rod with a mere threat of expulsion and public humiliation. In place of corporal punishment, doled out in public by a single authority fig ure, usually the teacher or rector, students were controlled by psychologi cal pressures produced by nearly impossible academic demands, rigorous examinations, and private disciplinary hearings conducted by faculty com mittees. Geistesdressur: Mental Dressage Drawing upon his own classroom experiences in Aarau, Wedekind dramatizes this grievous reality of schooling at the turn of the century in Spring Awakening: A Tragedy of Childhood (1891). In Act II of the play, Wedekind depicts two schoolboys, the fifteen-year-old Moritz Stiefel and Melchior Gabor, his classmate at the Gymnasium, commiserating about the excessive mental stress created by this "humanistic" pedagogy and the "damned homework" (4). I woke up thinking about verb forms! And during breakfast and walking to school I conjugated till I was blue in the face.... I only hope I can keep up this pace. I'll work my butt off if I have to. Ernst has failed six times since school started. Three times in Greek, twice in Knochenbruch's class, and the last time in Literature. I only failed five times-but I won't fail again. At least if Ernst fails, he won't shoot himself.... I just can't fail again. And if I do, well, I'll just see if I can't manage to break my neck. (17) Student suicides, such as the notorious Steglitzer Schilermord case in a suburb of Berlin, were a prevalent and growing embarrassment for Ger man schools during this period. By Wedekind's day, an incredible forty percent of male adolescent suicides were attributed to undue stress and failure in school (Neubauer 169).5 The Kantonschule in Aarau had had its share of student suicide cases as well. Of those on record, two pupils named Rotner and Ruetschi shot themselves in 1880. Wedekind wrote a letter to his friend Adolf V6gtlin a year later informing him that a first-year student, Franz Oberli, had also committed suicide: Jennifer Ham 51</page><page sequence="4">Letzten Freitag schwanzte Frank Oberlin die Schule. Samstagsmorgen um 4 Uhr nimmt er sein Geschichtsbuch und geht in den Schachen, um Geschichte zu repetieren. Zwei Stunden spater, um 6 Uhr, fand man seinen Leichnam, der in der Telli von der Aare aufs Land geworfen war. (Wedekind, Gesammelte Briefe 26) Last Friday Frank Oberlin cut school. Saturday morning at 4 o'clock he took his history book and went to the embankment to review his history lessons. Two hours later at 6 o'clock his body was found washed up on the banks of the Aare River. Yet another student, Moritz Duirr, a member of the literary club Senatus Poeticus, which Wedekind founded at the school, killed himself in the alpine ice regions in winter of 1885 (Kutscher 21). A fellow student attests to the unsettling effect these suicides had on young Wedekind at the time: "[Er] wurde durch und durch geschiittelt. Er kniete vor der Bank nieder und tauchte sein Taschentuch ins Blut und Stunden lang redete Schibler im finstersten Tal auf ihn ein, bis er schliesslich wieder zu sich kam" (Kutscher 18; "[He] was completely shaken. He knelt down in front of the bench and dipped his handkerchief in the blood, and for hours Schibler talked to him in that darkest valley until he came back to himself"). These actual suicides and the ensuing controversy are at the heart of scenes in Spring Awakening, as Wedekind indicates: "The concept emerged after the third scene and was constructed from my own experiences and from the experiences of my school comrades. Almost every scene depicts an actual experience" (Wedekind, Prosa 942-43). Wedekind's classmate Mortiz Diirr was in fact the central impetus for the creation of the play's suicidal teen Moritz Stiefel cited above. Wedekind memorialized these tragic school sui cides of his youth in the play and even dedicated the play to parents and teachers in the hope of enlisting them in his attack on an education system sorely in need of reform. Through his adolescent tragedy, Wedekind brings to public awareness the causal connection between the "softer" forms of discipline and student suicides. Slates of exams and grading scales were designed to give students the impression that they alone were in control of their academic success or failure. The students of Spring Awakening recognize the school's disingenu ous use of examinations and the hypocrisy of such a system. As Moritz says: "What do we have to go to school for anyway? So they can give us examinations! And why do they have to give us examinations? So they can fail us! Seven of us have to fail because the classroom only holds sixty" (4 5).6 Examinations defined normalcy and deviance from standards as Fou cault observed in Discipline and Punish: "Normal must be measured and defined in order to exert an influence on individuals. This is the role of the examination in the disciplinary society" (Foucault 184-92). Designed to strengthen character and a sense of national pride, 52 Unlearning the Lesson</page><page sequence="5">Wedekind portrays humanistic pedagogy as producing conformity, embar rassment, and in extreme cases suicide. In a bitterly ironic passage in Spring Awakening, the Gymnasium's headmaster focuses on the very reality that drove Moritz to suicide as he attempts to console the dead boy's father: "Very likely we would not have been able to promote him in any case" (36), to which a teacher adds, 'And even if we had promoted him, he would most certainly have had to stay back next spring anyway!" (Wedekind, Prosa 290).7 A fellow student exclaims, "You think I don't have to study all night too? If he'd learned his Literary History of Greece, he wouldn't have had to kill himselfl" (36). In a grim, literal sense, Moritz's life was ended by his ignorance of Greek literature: he failed an exam, and the thought that he would not be promoted literally mortified him. Shame and Desire Moral condemnation is heaped upon Moritz. The Pastor condemns the youth to everlasting death, and the boy's own father disowns his son, exclaiming, "He was no son of mine! He was no son of mine! I never liked him even as a child!" (35). Teachers and relatives also blame Moritz entire ly: "Dissolute-dissipated-debauched-depraved-and degenerate!" (35) and regret the shame he has brought to the family name. The alleged rea son for the suicide, namely Moritz's "depravity," was actually his curiosity about sexuality and his feelings of desire rooted in his body, which he had been taught to view as a matter of shame and embarrassment. Moritz asks, "Do you think that-that our sense of shame is something we learn?" (4 5). Wedekind's critique of the role schools play in inculcating shame is probably derived from Nietzsche, whom he read into the early morning hours.8 In Human All Too Human, Nietzsche argues that shame is not innate from birth, but rather an emotion humans are taught to associate with secrecy and mystery (69-70). The pedagogy of shaming Melchior experi enced was meant to manipulate students into lives of rectitude.9 Sum moned before a faculty court for causing his friend Moritz's suicide by pro viding him the facts of life in an explicitly illustrated dialog, Melchior finds himself on trial in the conference room under the ironic portrait gazes of the liberal educators Johann Pestalozzi (1746-1827) and Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712-78). It is clear that Pestalozzi and Rousseau would hardly have approved of the sordid and unjust inquisition that headmaster Sonnenstich subjects Melchior to. The headmaster insists that Melchior answer his leading questions about the anatomical diagram: "Does this obscene document owe its conception to you?" Melchior answers, "Yes. But sir, would you please show me just one obscenity in it?" Sonnenstich: "You will answer the precisely formulated questions which I will put to you with a simple and unassuming Yes or No!" (34). Melchior, posed a damning question, is Jennifer Ham 53</page><page sequence="6">found guilty despite his protestations: "I wrote nothing but what is a very well known fact to all of you.... Please show me where there is one offense against decency" (34). The headmaster's only response is to shame Melchior and refer him to the "Manual for the Three-Hour Course in Agglutinative Volapiik!" an obscure academic tome, useless in providing any answers to their questions about physical desire (34). Rousseau and Pestalozzi In his novel Emile, Rousseau argues that children are naturally good, "noble savages" untainted by original sin, and should not be subject to coer cive pedagogies. Education should not be abstract or external to the child, but rather should evolve from the child's instincts and inborn propensities. Like Locke, who also explicitly criticized corporal punishment in education, Pestalozzi stressed the primacy of natural phenomena and sensation over intellectual concepts in the natural learning patterns of children (Locke 123). According to this pedagogy, children were encouraged to explore objects through their senses in their natural environment as a basis for sub sequent generalizations. Pestalozzi's "object lessons" (later appropriated by Freud) were exercises in induction, beginning with concrete objects and pro gressing seamlessly to more abstract ideas. Both Pestalozzi and Rousseau advocated learning from "experience" rather than from verbal lessons or principles, a methodology reiterated in the "pedagogy of experience" of Christian Gotthilf Salzmann (1744-181 1), the "German Rousseau." This divide between prescriptive book learning and induction from real experi ence was one of the significant rifts in pedagogical theory during this era. However much experience itself might have been the ideal of the Enlightenment pedagogy of Pestalozzi and Rousseau, the treatment of stu dents portrayed in Spring Awakening seems the complete inversion of these ideals. Not surprisingly, since the Gymnasium offers no experiential knowl edge, Moritz fails to see the purpose of even attending. "What do we have to go to school for anyway?" (4). The authoritative texts at the core of their curriculum cannot satisfy their natural curiosity, for example, about sexuality. "Why have an encyclopedia that doesn't answer the most obvi ous question in the world!" (7). Kaiser Wilhelm II convened a national conference on education in Kassel in 1890 to bring these very concerns to a national level, exposing traditional book learning as hopelessly remote and sorely lacking any natural connections to students' own life experi ences. It is this widely publicized school controversy (Schulstreit) that Wedekind dramatizes in Spring Awakening. Experience as Teacher Reformers, like Pestalozzi, believed that Paukschulen ("cram schools") that practiced a kind of academic dressage (Geistesdressur), actually 54 Unlearning the Lesson</page><page sequence="7">weakened character by failing to teach students to reason and experience for themselves, to discover new truths and values. "We're so weak," exclaims Moritz (6). Unreflective cramming, especially of past historical events, turns students into weak academic scribes, slavishly beholden to the truths of a culture created by "educational philistines" (Bildungsphilister), a term Nietzsche used continually to connote small minded academic pedants like the aptly named Sonnenstich, Affenschmalz, Kniippeldick, Fliegentod, and the other rectors and teachers featured in Spring Awakening. Nietzsche diagnosed modern man, like such philistines, as suffering from a weakened personality (geschwachten Personlichkeit), whose creativity has been paralyzed by an education oversaturated with historical models and received ideas.10 In the essay "Zirkusgedanken" ("Thoughts on the Circus"), Wedekind insists on the priority of experience in education, contrasting the perform ance of trapeze artists with tightrope walkers: Die eine, die Trapezkiinstlerin, erfreut sich eines stabilen, die Seiltanzerin dagegen schwebt in labilem Gleichgewicht. . . . erstere hat ihren Stiitzpunkt... uiber sich, letztere hingegen hat ihn unter sich in dem kaum zollbreiten Band.... Daraus ergibt sich nun bei jener die Innehal tung des Gleichgewichtes als etwas Selbstverstandliches, wahrend diese, die Seiltanzerin, sich dasselbe jeden Augenblick von neuem erkampfen muB. (Wedekind, Prosa 883) The one, the trapeze artist, enjoys a stable balance, the tightrope walker on the other hand sways in a labile balance.... the first has a fixed point above, the latter on the other hand has it in a scarcely one inch wide rope below her... the former trusts in balance as something that can be taken for granted, the latter, the tightrope walker has to constantly be reassert ing it afresh each moment. The trapeze artist places her confidence in the ability of the trapeze to hold her up; the tightrope walker, on the other hand, is dependent on her own ability to continually reassert her balance. Wedekind contrasts these two outlooks, which he terms the "abstrakt-erhabener" and "real-praktischer" forms of idealism: an abstract idealism anchored in an idea from above, outside oneself, or a realistic idealism rooted in one's own practical experi ence under one's feet below (Wedekind, Prosa 888). Wedekind suggests that an education grounded in experience rather than in acquired cultural norms will develop strength and "elasticity," the ability to adapt and survive.1I Anti-education: School of the Unconscious Nietzsche, himself a teacher in Basel, denounced rote learning and "unnatural methods of education" as actually being "keine wirkliche Bil dung mehr sondern nur noch das Wissen um Bildung, das lediglich in Jennifer Ham 55</page><page sequence="8">einem 'Bildungs-Gedanken'. . . resultiert" (Sdmtliche Werke 1: 273; "no real education at all, only a kind of knowledge of education, something that results in an idea of education").'2 According to the iconoclastic philoso pher, students acquire the idea of an education, a pseudo-education, rather than actually becoming educated. They need to recover from this artificial educative process, to practice a kind of "unlearning," to return to their natural "uncivilized" selves. This project of recovering oneself does not involve a dubious and high ly problematic return to origins, as if beneath civilization one could redis cover the persistence of an original humanity. Nor is this restoration to health and strength a matter of mimicry or representation, neither of which are creative gestures. For Nietzsche, recovering means simply for getting the lesson, becoming culturally innocent. Only by obliterating consciousness can all of one's contradictory drives and instincts flourish in uninhibited authenticity. For Nietzsche, this is the true educative process, directed at curing oneself of the prevailing pathogenic culture and one's enthrallment with others, thus restoring humanity to its origi nal instinctual vigor. Wedekind's answer to Nietzsche's call for an anti-pedagogy can be found in Mine Ha-Ha: or The Physical Education of Young Girls (1901).13 The novel, which relates the daily lives of students in a country boarding school hermetically sealed off from the rest of the world by high walls, is narrated by an elderly former pupil, Hidalla, now a teacher herself. At the institute, a white house surrounded by a green campus and nearby theater, instruction is based on physical training aimed at achieving harmony and grace. Through experience and daily disciplined instruction in comport ment, gymnastics, swimming, dance, and music, the pupils overcome the dichotomy between nature and morality, body and mind; as Hidalla says, they "mit den Huiften denken lernten" (Wedekind, Prosa 190; "learned to think with their hips"). Unlike the reigning pedagogy in Spring Awakening, focused on improving the mind through memorization of facts, this schooling is aimed first at the perfectibility of the body. Mine Ha-Ha presents readers with Wedekind's antidote to the existing educational crisis, "eine Bildungsmethode, die das Geistige ganzlich auss chlieBt" (Kutscher 205; "a pedagogical method, that entirely excludes the intellect") focusing instead on an elastic, anti-cerebral physicality. As Hidalla reports, every day the young innocent girls in white smocks improved themselves through carefully monitored strength, grace, and flexibility exercises led by their teacher, Gertrud. Vom ersten Tag an hatte man mich hergenommen und auf den Handen gehen lassen. Zwei der Madchen hielten mir dabei die Beine hinauf. Das Haar hing mir auf den Fugboden, das Kleid fiel mir vom Giirtel her in den Nacken. So ging ich mit den Beinen hoch in der Luft auf den Steinfliesen 56 Unlearning the Lesson</page><page sequence="9">durchs Zimmer, am Nachmittag, bis es Zeit zum Baden war, wurde musiziert. (Wedekind, Prosa 198) From the first day onward, I was allowed to walk on my hands. Two of the girls held my legs up. My hair hung down to the floor and my dress fell from my belt onto my neck. So I went across the room on the tiles with my legs high in the air. We played music all afternoon until it was time to go swimming. This utopian Schule des Unbewufiten, or "school of the unconscious," is a different sort of dressage (Dressur) where few words are spoken, where the teachers train students' muscle memory with taps of a baton much like animal trainers, and where students eventually know each other so instinctively that they can read each other's thoughts, as if sharing one natural consciousness. Hidalla encounters a horse pulling a wagon, looks the animal in the eyes and intuits a human connection: "Ich sah die Augen und fiihlte, dag ich ein menschliches Wesen vor mir hatte" (Wedekind, Prosa 210; "I saw the eyes and felt that I had a human being before me") .14 Even the way the horse held its feet, its proud affect, the fire in its gaze, its quiet strength, the way it shook its head, seems to her to be human, remi niscent of her teacher-friend Gertrud or the young boys she had met, as if those human figures had been trained into animals, a kind of reverse anthropomorphism. The natural consciousness the students share with each other extends beyond them and unites them with other animal forms. For both Nietzsche and Wedekind, recovering one's animality through education represents a breakthrough, not a Fall in need of corporal punish ment and humiliation. Once they reach puberty, the students go out into the world where they must adapt to a harsher social reality. A natural pedagogy similar to the one depicted in Mine Ha-Ha was insti tuted at several well-known experimental schools in the School Reform movement in Germany and Switzerland.15 Like Hidalla's and Emile's, many of these schools were established out in the countryside, in the "pedagogical provinces," as Goethe termed them in his well-known Bil dungsroman, Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship. Hermann Lietz established a network of such "rural education homes" (Landerziehungsheime), modeled after the English boarding schools in the tradition of Cecil Reddie's experi mental Abbotsholme School in England, which he used as a setting in his play Emlohstobba (Abbotsholme spelled backwards). The English reformer Reddie wanted to train boys in how to live. He regretted that leisure "without which true education is impossible" had disappeared and that schools had become "steam-driven factories for turning out by the dozen hastily crammed candidates for examinations" (Neubauer 170). Lietz similarly proposed that the authoritarian methods, rote memoriza tion, and abstract thinking in the traditional German Unterrichtsschule be replaced by a pedagogy like the kind at Abbotsholme, one centered on free Jennifer Ham 57</page><page sequence="10">movement and group loyalty designed to bring teacher and student closer together and encourage self-discipline, individual responsibility, and leader ship (Schmid 78). To this end, Lietz opened a country boarding school in Ilsenburg in 1898 and a middle school in Haubinda in 1901. It was in Haubinda that the famous pedagogue Gustav Wyneken began as a teacher and later founded the Freie Schulgemeinde Wickersdorf in the Thuringer Forest in 1898. Teachers and students at these schools engaged in a pedagogic rap port alternating between the medieval Germanic notion of Gefolgschaft (ret inue), reliant on commitment, comradeship and group allegiance, and Pada gogischer Eros, a sort of mutual teacher-student love inspired by Platonic relationships in ancient Greece. Wedekind recreates this Greek and Ger manic ideal relationship of tutelage between teacher and student in the relationship between Hidalla and Gertrud in Mine Ha-Ha.'6 Wyneken, credited with founding the German Youth Movement and the scouting movement (Wandervogel), called for "intellectual loosening up" so that "the muscles of our brain do not wither" and "we can exercise our moral lungs" (Wyneken 252-53). This sentiment was echoed by his school's co-founder, Paul Geheeb, who went on to establish the Odenwald schule around 1910 where mornings began with an "air bath," student exercises conducted outside in the nude, designed to educate the body and open the mind.17 The pedagogy in this vein that comes closest to Wedekind's in Mine Ha Ha is that of the Swiss educator and musician Emile Jaques-Dalcroze. Artur Kutscher claims that the educational utopia depicted in Mine Ha-Ha inspired Dalcroze's influential concept of rhythmische Erziehung ("rhythmic education") which he employed in the school he established in Geneva and later in the garden-city of Hellerau, near Dresden (Kutscher 205). Like the boarding school in Mine Ha-Ha, Hellerau included both a main house, the House of the People, an impressive theater for festivals and even a sys tem of sounding bells. The Hellerau school was part of the "Life Reforma tion" (Lebensreform) movement, a daily hygiene designed to heal and renew human existence through the rediscovery of primal nature and the practice of new cultural values. The aim of such schooling is to renounce the artifi ciality of metropolitan culture and to free up the process of learning through movement and non-verbal forms of expression, through music, dance, pantomime, and play, and to encourage the development of a holis tic personality. By using the body as a means of expression and as a con duit leading back to its natural rhythms, a unity between body, mind, and soul becomes possible. Dalcroze called this pedagogy rhythmische Gymnastik ("rhythmic gymnastics"), described here by one of Dalcroze's benefactors at a performance in Dresden: Dann aber begannen die Ubungen. Und ich erlebte, was wohl jeder Men sch mit unverdorbenen Sinnen und mit dem geheimen, oft schiichtern 58 Unlearning the Lesson</page><page sequence="11">verborgenen Glauben an reines Menschentum erlebt, wenn er diese Ubungen sieht. Man kann nicht gleich sagen, was es ist, was einen so anzieht und zugleich befreit und gefangen nimmt, aber man spurt unmit telbar und mit jener Gewissheit... dass hier die Krafte des Menschen zu einer neuen Synthese verbunden werden. Ich fiihlte mich dem Ursprung alles Lebendigen nahe. Ich wusste, dass unser in Gewohnheiten trage gewordener Organismus, KUrper und Geist, hier von einer bestimmten Seite aus erneuert und verjiingt werden konnte.... so durchzuckte mich dieses Erlebnis der rhythmisch bewegten Korper. (Thern-Maier 6) Then the exercises began. And I experienced, what probably every person with unspoiled senses and a secret often shy belief in pure humanity experiences, when he sees these exercises. One cannot say immediately what it is, what is so attractive and at the same time freeing and riveting, but one senses directly and with certainty . .. that here the strengths of the human being are bound in a new synthesis. I felt close to the origin of everything living. I knew that our organism, body and mind so tired by habits, could become renewed and rejuvenated.... the experience of these rhythmically moving bodies ran through me. Jacques-Dalcroze provided such exercises to his solfege students to improve their perception of musical rhythm through physical movement. He hoped to counteract the arrhythmia of modern life, harmonize the body and the spirit, and celebrate the positive influence that rhythmic move ments of the body have upon intellectual development. A similar use of rhythmic physical exercise called eurhythmy (meaning beautiful or harmo nious rhythm) was popularized by Rudolf Steiner and is still practiced in what are now internationally known Waldorfschulen. The girls in Mine Ha Ha must master such disciplined dance movements in harmonious balance before they are allowed to dance publicly at the school's Festspielhaus. Wedekind himself practiced the widespread pedagogy of body culture (Korperkultur), so popular at the time. He supported nudist culture, per formed gymnastics regularly, and fostered a similar pedagogy with his own children, who learned to walk on their hands and perform on balancing balls. "In seinem Arbeitszimmer befand sich bis zuletzt eine holzerne Kugel von 1/2 m Durchmesser sowie eine breite Trommel, mit denen er und Frau und Kinder Gleichgewichts- und Laufiibungen vornahmen" (Kutscher 205; "In his work room was a wooden ball about half a meter in diameter and a broad drum, which he used in balancing and running exercises with his wife and children"). Not only did Wedekind argue and attempt to demonstrate, as did many advocates of Korperkultur, that a disciplined body cultivated a strong character, he also believed in the body's own ability to instruct. The students in Mine Ha-Ha demonstrate that consistent condi tioning and disciplining of the body suspends the critical mind by focusing it on forms and sensations. The mind forgets its cultural lessons and is able through physical training to overcome itself. Like the "elasticity" of Jennifer Ham 59</page><page sequence="12">the circus performers of "Zirkusgedanken," physical activity becomes a model for thinking. Wedekind's inspiration and kindred spirit in the poetics of physical edu cation was the "vitalist philosophy" (Lebensphilosophie) of Nietzsche and Schopenhauer. Rejecting the supremacy of the intellect and its privileged focus on intellectual reflection, this theory anticipated the demise of the educational elite (Bildungsbiirgertum) and its self-proclaimed responsibility of upholding the nation's cultural tradition. For Nietzsche, educated man is separated from himself by merit of his schooling and culture. He is bereft of and nostalgic for his innocence and the elusive promise of libera tion. For him, effective education is the recuperation from the barbarism of culture and the "civilizing process." Both Wedekind and Nietzsche, like Freud, railed against what they saw as the depleted vital energy of Western sophisticates. Both called for liber ation. Not the liberation one attains from mastering a skill or area of knowledge, but rather the act of "unlearning," of trusting one's desires, one's instincts, the ultimate form of resistance. This is the starting point of many radical pedagogies at the time. In many ways, Wedekind's theater itself was a kind of reform school (Korrektionsanstalt). As for most adher ents of Lebensphilosophie, the task of philosophy, psychology, and pedagogy needed to shift from censoring and destroying desire to recovering and cultivating it. For Wedekind the source of true knowledge was the body: from it stems the desire to know, without it there is no knowing at all and no revitalization of culture, only ressentiment.

Vor allem versuchte er uns zu eigener Anschauung zu erziehen und nichts einfach hinzunehmen ohne Pr?fung und ?berlegung" (Seehaus 24; "My father was, I believe, what one would call a pedagogical genius. . . . Above all, he tried to raise us according to our own views and not to simply accept things without testing and reflection"). 12. See Adorno's discussion of this notion of pseudo-education. For salient texts by Nietzsche on education, see "Schopenhauer as Educator," "On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life," and "David Strauss, the Confessor and the Writer" in Untimely Meditations; "On the Future of our Educational Institutions" and "The Improvers of Humanity" in Twilight of the Idols, Thus Spoke Zarathustra; and to lesser extent the preface to the second edition of Gay Science. For secondary sources on Nietzsche and education, see Bingham, Cooper, Gordon, Johnston, and Peters. 13. This work has been recently adapted into two films: Innocence (2004) and The Fine Art of Love: Mine Ha-Ha (2005). 14. This passage is reminiscent of Nietzsche's empathetic encounter with a horse being whipped on a square in Turin before the philosopher lapsed into madness. 15. See Albisetti, Eley, Lamberti, Olson, Ringer, and Schmid for extensive discus sions of the school reform movement in Germany. 16. Both young Walter Benjamin and Klaus Mann attended these experimental schools, the schools at Haubinda and Odenwald, respectively, and had similarly close relationships with Wyneken and Geheeb. These experiences inspired Martin Walser's depiction of daily life at the Benjamenta Institute in Jakob von Gunten (1909) and Mann's own work Anja und Esther. 17. See Mann for a description of the daily routine at Odenwald: "Der Tagesverlauf . . . begann mit einem Dauerlauf im Walde und kalten Duschen; zwischen den Unterrichtsstunden des Vormittags gab es ein 'Luftbad' auf einer eingez?unten H?gelwiese, zu der man im Trabe lief und wo, die Jungen von den M?dchen getren nt, splitternackt Frei?bungen gemacht wurden" (137; "the day started with a run in the woods followed by a cold shower; during a break between lessons there was an 'air bath' on a fenced in hill field which one jogged to and where, the boys sepa rated from the girls, one performed open air exercises stark naked").
