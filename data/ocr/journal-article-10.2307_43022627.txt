<plain_text><page sequence="1">Searching for God or Medusa through Allusion in Abbey's Desert Solitaire David D. Joplin In Desert Solitaire , Edward Abbey claims that he has come to the desert to find a "bedrock" epistemology that will allow him to know "God or Medusa face to face" (6). Although direct contact with the desert land- scape plays prominently in his search, his rich use of the literary past through allusion provides a philosophical context for his views. Some of the allusions are transparent; others are so deeply embedded within the narrative that they offer but faint glimpses of the works they refer- ence and often must be carefully inferred. Both kinds, however, must be dealt with because Abbey uses epistemological implications from them to frame his own ideas. When factored into the narrative as a whole, the allusions present a complex web of conflicting pictures. While they sometimes reinforce Abbeys own romantic response to nature, more often they provide touchstones to counter such views. The competing pictures present a romantic world of mystery and wonder that collides with a hard-edged empirical world of mere surface. The resulting exis- tential tug of war between head and heart goes largely unresolved. By focusing upon a few representative examples, I hope to demonstrate how allusion works in these directions to shape Abbey's search for meaning. Although I consider a number of authors and works he alludes to, I give more attention to those that play most prominently in shaping his epistemology: Thoreau, Emerson, Coleridge, Milton, Wordsworth, Keats, and the Bible.1 Abbey sets up his narrative through Thoreau and Emerson, enabling him to frame his search for "bedrock" within a specific episte- mological tradition. This occurs early in chapter 1, in which he offers what amounts to his thesis statement. The passage runs as follows: I am here not only to evade for a while the clamor and filth and confusion of the cultural apparatus but also to confront, imme- diately and directly if it's possible, the bare bones of existence, the elemental and fundamental, the bedrock which sustains us. I want to be able to . . . meet God or Medusa face to face. (6) Western American Literature 43.2 (Summer 2008): 103-27</page><page sequence="2">John DePuy. LANDSCAPE ARCH. 2008. Ink and watercolor on paper. 28" X 41". Courtesy of the artist. 104 Western American Literature Summer 2008 Abbeys desire to "evade . . . [the] confusion of the cultural apparatus" invokes Emerson's "Nature," where people are advised not to build upon "the sepulchers of the fathers" but instead to "enjoy an original relation to the universe" (3). Allusion to Thoreau is also transparent. In Waiden , Thoreau asserts that he "went to the woods ... to front only the essential facts of life," to "work . . . downward through the . . . slush of opinion, and prejudice, and tradition, and delusion, and appearance" to find "hard bottom and rocks in place, which we can call reality , and say, This is, and no mistake" (343, 350). That Abbey draws upon the two romantics is widely acknowledged. Edward S. Twining, among others, states that Abbey "comes" from the "Emersonian-Thoreauvian tradi- tion of thinking and writing" ("Roots" 25) and that "Thoreau . . . seems as close to being Abbey's spiritual and intellectual father as anyone could be" ("Edward Abbey" 4).2 After positioning himself within the romantic tradition through Emerson and Thoreau, Abbey launches his own investigation into the meaning he seeks. To do so, he looks in two distinct directions. One challenges idealism central to the works he seems to pay tribute to and the other, paradoxically, reconfirms many of the ideals he has chal- lenged. In both cases, he works through allusion to establish his views. The result is a dialectic of opposing epistemologies that allows compet- ing views to coexist. First, I shall consider how Abbey uses allusion</page><page sequence="3">David D. Joplin IOS to question romantic idealism, Christian humanism, and the Judeo- Christian tradition. As we shall see, this side of his thought is rooted in empiricism and at its extreme veers toward an existential darkness - the "Medusa" side of the equation. Abbey's challenge of romantic idealism is easy to point out. One instance is an allusion to Thoreau's sand foliage in Waiden that undercuts Thoreau's idea about a divine presence overlooking man's development. To recap briefly, in his sand foliage passage, Thoreau describes sand on an embankment near Waiden thawing in the spring as a picture of ere- ation. As Thoreau watches the sun melt the snow, he imagines that he is "in the laboratory of the Artist who made the world and [him]" (546). As he sees the melting snow mix with sand and flow downhill, taking various shapes and designs, he is reminded of the process of creation. From the melting ooze arise plants, insects, birds, and mankind. As Thoreau puts it, "What is man but a mass of thawing clay?" (547). And later he emphasizes the common unity shared by people and the earth when he poses, "Shall I not have intelligence with the earth? Am I not partly leaves and vegetable mould myself?" (389). The direction of his creation imagery depicts an essential energy, epitomized by the sun, act- ing upon a mass of earth, snow, and mud to form plants, birds, animals, and, by inference, man. Thus, under the hand of the "Artist," people come into being out of the generative forces of nature. Allusion to Thoreau's sand foliage shows Abbey moving in an opposite direction. In Desert Solitaire's chapter "Down the River," Abbey describes a raft trip he and Ralph Newcomb made through Glen Canyon before Lake Powell was finished. He reverses the process from Thoreau's sand foliage passage when he imagines Newcomb and himself melting back into nature. As the two friends drift "farther still into the visionary world of Glen Canyon," we are told that "configurations are beginning to fade, distinctions shading off into blended amalgams of man and man, men and water, water and rock" (185). The two men are slowly merging with nature, losing their individuality: We are merging, molecules getting mixed. Talk about inter- subjectivity - we are both taking on the coloration of river and canyon, our skin as mahogany as the water on the shady side, our clothing coated with silt, our bare feet caked with mud and tough as lizard skin, our whiskers bleached as the sand - even our eyeballs, what little you can see of them between the lids, have taken on a coral-pink, the color of the dunes. And we smell, I suppose, like catfish. (185)</page><page sequence="4">106 Western American Literature Summer 2008 He stresses the point, stating that as he floats down the river, he feels "a pleasure almost equivalent to that first entrance - from the outside - into the neck of the womb," which he describes as "a rebirth backward in time and into primeval liberty" (154, 155). His experience re-occurs in another chapter, "Havasu," but this time as a picture of self-annihilation into nature: "I slipped by degrees into lunacy, me and the moon, and lost to a certain extent the power to distinguish between what was and what was not myself: looking at my hand I would see a leaf trembling on a branch" (200). Clearly, Abbey reverses Thoreau. Whereas Thoreau pictured coming into being out of nature under the agency of an "Artist" and on another occasion as nature "radiat[ing] from [him] accordingly" (334), Abbey imagines dissolving backward into nature in what amounts to a dissolution of the self. The different directions are profound. Thoreau shows a world orga- nized and directed by a higher agency; Abbey does not. For Thoreau, the direction of human experience is forward through higher states; for Abbey, at least in these passages, it is backward into antecedent prime- val states. One can see how his pull backward constitutes ontological regression: rather than the self evolving into greater awareness as would be the case for Thoreau, it slips into dissolution, possibly even losing what awareness it had to begin with. Despite the allusion to Thoreau, Abbey manages to set off in a completely opposite direction. He further plays off Waiden to undercut Thoreau s confident idealism that advocates higher worlds. Thoreau knows absolutes absolutely; Abbey absolutely does not. The dynamic between the two along this axis becomes apparent through Abbey's allusion to Thoreaus playing the flute. On sev- eral occasions in Waiden , Thoreau associates playing the flute with a meta- physical awakening. One example is his playing the flute to perch that were "charmed" by the music (423). Along these lines, Waiden itself becomes a "flute" to "charm" the reader to a higher life. This is most apparent in "Higher Laws." There Thoreau shows the effect of a flute on John Farmer, who is representative of those who have fallen into a platonic sleep: But the notes of the flute came home to his [John Farmer's] ears out of a different sphere from that he worked in, and suggested work for certain faculties which slumbered in him. ... A voice said to him, Why do you stay here and live this mean moiling life, when a glorious existence is possible for you? Those same stars twinkle over other fields than these. But how to come out of this condition and actually migrate thither? (468) Music from the flute, as it were, draws one up into a higher realm.</page><page sequence="5">David D. Joplin 107 Abbey subtly alludes to Thoreau's flute imagery, but to a much dif- ferent effect. Whereas Thoreau uses the flute to evoke an awareness of the divine, Abbey uses the recorder - a flute-like instrument - to distance himself from it as, for instance, in "Terra Incognita: Into the Maze." Although the philosophical context must be inferred from the chapter, the link to Thoreau remains clear. At one point, Abbey and his friend Robert Waterman engage in a philosophical discussion about ideas ranging from the poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke to the existential effect of naming things. Unable to conclude anything, he states, "And so in the end the world is lost again. No, the world remains . . . and it is we who are lost. Again. Round and round, through the endless labyrinth of thought - the maze" (257). A little later in the same scene, he Ucut[s] a few holes at odd intervals in [a] drinking straw, creating a sort of crude recorder, and play[s] a few tunes in a barbarous scale never heard before this side of the Atlas Mountains" (259-60). But unlike Thoreau's flute that evocatively affirms "a glorious existence" in a "different sphere," Abbey's "barbarous" notes suggest an epistemological uncertainty. The message of these passages is clear enough at face value, but when draw- ing upon Thoreau through allusion, their ideas are heightened. Unlike Thoreau's, Abbey's music suggests that John Farmer has little to wake to beyond his ordinary daylight world.3 Abbey counters Thoreau's transcendental ideas yet again when he offers his take on "imagination." Contrast between the two through allusion shows that, for Abbey, imagination is psychological and limit- ing rather than existentially essential and liberating as is the case for Thoreau. Abbey states, If a man's imagination were not so weak, so easily tired, if his capacity for wonder not so limited, he would abandon for- ever such fantasies of the supernal. He would learn to perceive in water, leaves and silence more than sufficient of the absolute and marvelous, more than enough to console him for the loss of the ancient dreams. (177) This view of "imagination" delimits, as brought out by contrast to Tho- reau's essential view: "The amount of it is, the imagination, give it the least license, dives deeper and soars higher than Nature goes" (529). For Thoreau, the imagination opens one's awareness to the solid fact as well as to metaphysical possibilities, thus elevating one's awareness through nature to realms beyond. For Abbey, any such reaches toward the "super- nal" constitute nothing more than fantasies.</page><page sequence="6">108 Western American Literature Summer 2008 Abbey's much more limited view of the imagination, in contrast to Thoreau's, is further emphasized in a richly allusive passage that infers that nature circumscribes the imagination rather than the opposite: Under the desert sun, in that dogmatic clarity, the fables of theology and the myths of classical philosophy dissolve like mist. The air is clean, the rock cuts cruelly into flesh; . . . Whirlwinds dance across the salt flats, a pillar of dust by day; the thornbush breaks into flame at night. What does it mean? It means nothing. It is as it is and has no need for meaning. The desert lies beneath and soars beyond any possible human qualification. (194) The thrust of the passage suggests that nature is an end unto itself; imagination does not lie beyond, above, or within it, as is the case for Thoreau. Additionally, the last sentence simultaneously echoes and subverts Thoreau's statement through its structure and language. Close reading is necessary to make the point. First, we must place the two statements side by side for careful comparison: The amount of it is, the imagina- The desert lies beneath and soars tion, give it the least license, dives beyond any possible human quali- deeper and soars higher than Na- fication. ture goes. Abbey's statement structurally echoes Thoreau's with its subject/com- pound verb pattern: "desert lies and soars." Syntactically, this parallels Thoreau's "imagination dives and soars." Second, the passages share similar verbs. "Soars" appears in both, while Abbey's "lies beneath" is correlative to Thoreau's "dives deeper." Such continuity of verbs com- bined with structural similarities draw the two statements together in a way that sets off Abbey's contrary view. This becomes more obvious if we rewrite Thoreau's statement to accommodate Abbey's thought. All that would have to be done is to substitute Abbey's key nominais for Thoreau's. This involves simply replacing Thoreau's subject "imagina- tion" with Abbey's subject "desert" (a synecdoche for "Nature"), while simultaneously substituting Thoreau's "Nature" with Abbey's "human qualification." No structural alteration in the sentence pattern would be necessary to accommodate the substitutions. The revised statement would run something like this: The amount of it is, the Desert, give it the least license, dives deeper and soars higher than human qualification goes. One can begin to appreciate how Abbey has once again played off</page><page sequence="7">John DePuy. EMERGENCE SERIES. 1990. Ink and watercolor on paper. 28" X 41". Courtesy of the artist. David D. Joplin 109 of Thoreau to make an opposite point, made much the more glaring insofar as "imagination" drops completely out of the picture. Such must be the case because, ontologically considered, "imagination" for Abbey has a psychological locus - it is a "human qualification" that leads to weakness. The opposite is true for Thoreau. First of all, for Thoreau, "human qualification" assumes divine qualities (Emerson's "god in ruins") that Abbey will not concede, and, second, for Thoreau, "imagination" is a divine attribute accessible through nature, whose function, partly, is to wake people like John Farmer to higher lives. Abbey recognizes no such force within or beyond phenomena. Apparently, for him, at least as far as a window into any higher realm is concerned, nature is a dead end, ostensibly impenetrable to an imagination that rises no higher than its human locus. Admittedly, this is a subtle reading of the passage, yet one verified by its consistency to Abbey's thought and his use of allusions. That these are often subtle and complex has been noted by others. Rothman observes that "Abbey's use of the poetic past is often . . . indirect . . . extending] into extraordinarily subtle echoes" (53), and Bryant acknowledges that in using allusions, Abbey often "simply provides an echo" and that many of his "references may be only glancing associations" (14). My reading thus falls in line with heretofore recognized tendencies in Abbey's work.</page><page sequence="8">HO Western American Literature Summer 2008 Allusion to Emerson in the previous passage further emphasizes Abbey's view that nature is a closed window to higher meaning. His insistence that nature "means nothing" and "has no need for mean- ing" inversely echoes Emerson's assertion that "every natural fact is a symbol of some spiritual fact" (23). His attempt to explore the Maze in "Terra Incognita: Into the Maze" also confirms this point because the Maze (a topographical feature) is a metaphor for a maze of experience, philosophy, religion, and culture that seekers after truth must work through. That Abbey has to abort his efforts due to inclement weather has its metaphoric implications. Additionally, the translation of "Terra Incognita," part of the chapter's title, is an obvious pointer: "Earth Unknown." From this angle, Emerson's "spiritual fact" is further sub- verted behind the "natural fact" (23), because Emerson's "natural fact[s]" conduce to "spiritual fact[s]" of clarity and certainty, while Abbey's do not. For him, anything behind the solid earth is unknown. Thus far, allusions have enabled Abbey to present a bleak picture of a romantically shallow landscape. In "Serpents of Paradise," an earlier chapter, he lays the foundation for this bleak picture through allusions to Coleridge's "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner." This occurs through his gopher snake account. On his stomach, watching an apparent mating ritual between two gopher snakes, Abbey suddenly offers a blessing: "For godsake let them go in peace, I tell myself. Wish them luck and (if lovers) innumerable offspring, a life of happily ever after. Not for their sake alone but for your own" (21). He concludes with a lesson he feels compelled to "spread": "All men are brothers. . . . We are obliged ... to spread the news, painful and bitter though it may be for some to hear, that all living things on earth are kindred" (21). Abbey's experience echoes the Mariner's encounter with the water snakes and thus draws the poem's epistemology to bear, which becomes the fulcrum from which Abbey works. After he has shot the albatross and his crew has died, the Mariner watches some water snakes around his ship and suddenly blesses them in a "spring of love" (524). At this point, inasmuch as the Mariner has become aware of a higher world, the curse is broken, he can now "pray," and the albatross falls off his neck (524). At the end of the poem, the Mariner sums up his lesson: He prayeth well, who loveth well Both man and bird and beast. He prayeth best, who loveth best All things both great and small;</page><page sequence="9">David D. Joplin 111 For the dear God who loveth us, He made and loveth all (529) Abbey's parallels to Coleridge's poem are fairly obvious. Both rely upon insight through experience with snakes, both hinge on blessing the snakes, and both end with a summation of the lesson learned. To this extent, the two are on the same page. But Abbey parts company from Coleridge through implications of just exactly what Abbey's "news" is. Coleridge's message advances spiritual knowledge about the unity of higher and lower worlds - the Mariner had not recognized the provenance of spirit before he shot the albatross. Abbey's message, on the other hand, while ringing with positive implications of a global community, nevertheless does not hinge on spiritual connections, as does Coleridge's. Juxtaposition through allusion brings out existential nuances of Abbey's snake experience, but ironically they remain quietly in the background of his primary point, which is planetary "brother- hood." In this subtle way, Abbey plays off Coleridge's poem to advance his probe into the philosophical "bedrock" he seeks. "Serpents of Paradise" contains several other references to famous literary texts. Early in the chapter when Abbey contemplates killing a rattlesnake, he states, "I'm a humanist; I'd rather kill a man than a snake" (17), which echoes Robinson Jeffers's poem "Hurt Hawks": "I'd sooner, except the penalties, kill a man than a hawk" (165). This con- nection, to some extent, lands him in the humanist camp (as does his "lesson" from the snake experience: "all men are brothers"). David M. Pozza's assertion that Abbey's remark is "a revision of Robinson Jeffers' 'antihumanisť statement" epitomizes much of the critical commentary (14), as does Rothman's argument that it is "an obvious inversion of Jeffers's 'Inhumanism'" (66).^ Most agree that the allusion helps define Abbey's own brand of humanism, one which places humans on equal footing with the non-human world. Little need be added to the work already done in this regard. However, it has not been acknowledged that Abbey here also alludes to Milton's "Areopagitica." In this case, his allusion serves to reject Christian humanism as represented by Milton, to repudiate classical, literary, and philosophical traditions as useful in the search for meaning, and to reject the Judeo-Christian tradition itself. All told, these multiple layers supply important additional pieces to Abbey's epistemological picture. The allusion to Milton is not difficult to see either. Early in the "Areopagitica," Milton argues for the value of books, stating that "books are not absolutely dead things, but do contain a potency of life in them</page><page sequence="10">112 WESTERN AMERICAN LITERATURE SUMMER 2008 to be as active as that soul was whose progeny they are; nay, they do preserve as a vial the purest efficacy and extraction of that living intel- lect that bred them" (720). Milton goes on to say that "unless wariness be used, as good almost kill a man as kill a good book : who kills a man kills a reasonable creature, God's image; but he who destroys a good book, kills reason itself, kills the image of God, as it were, in the eye" (720, emphasis added). Abbey's assertion that he'd "rather kill a man than a snake" alludes to Milton's "as good almost kill a man as kill a good book." Abbey replaces Milton's "book" with "snake," but otherwise the two are strikingly similar. The Milton reference enables Abbey to further define his stance as a "humanist." Milton, it must be remembered, epitomizes Renaissance humanism, that flowering of learning that glorifies man as primate of God's creation. Abbey brings this tradition into the picture through the echo of Milton. From this angle, his declaration that he is a "humanist" must be read as a pun, meaning that he is no humanist at all in Milton's terms.-* The fact that Abbey would rather kill a man than a snake - the very creature at the center of mischief in Paradise Lost - emphasizes the point. Needless to say, he is being ironic; he is not advocating violence to save nature. This point has been well made by Rothman, who states that "Abbey's joke about 'humanism' is inspired" (66). The irony deepens when Milton is drawn into the picture through the extremity of Abbey's claim. Don Scheese acknowledges that Abbey "acquires a biocentric outlook" (308), one antithetic to Milton's humanism, as is apparent in Raphael's creation account to Adam in Paradise Lost , in which Milton presents man as God's "master work, the end / Of all yet done" (163) and commands man to "Subdue [nature], and throughout dominion hold" over "every living thing that moves on the earth" (163). Abbey further levels the Miltonic hierarchy when he gets down on his "belly" to better view the snakes. In Milton, the snake is reduced to crawling on its belly, cursed by God for having tempted Eve. But Abbey offers no "curse," and it is he, not a creature, that is reduced to crawling on his belly. If a "curse" exists, then it must be the curse of "anthropocentrism" that, from Abbey's perspective, prevents one from finding an essential "bedrock," as implied when he laments "descend[ing] to ... anthropomorphism" in his evaluation of the gopher snakes' behavior (21). Although he is not explicitly referring to Milton, Bryant nevertheless anchors the point in his comment that in the "Serpents of Paradise," the "Eden story is turned neatly upside down" (7). Epistemologically, the snake account with its allusion to Milton extends equal value to all living things.</page><page sequence="11">John DePuy. BEARS EARS (UTAH). 2003. Ink and watercolor on paper. 28Mx41". Courtesy of the artist. David D. Joplin 113 Yet another angle of Abbey's complex and subtle allusion to Milton derives from Milton's elevating books to such grand heights, equating them with living things containing God's own "reason." The play of Abbey's thought against Milton's suggests that such a conclusion has been hastily drawn. Further, books as such are metonymies of the tradi- tions that produce them. Thus in rejecting books as a means to find the bedrock he seeks, Abbey rejects the "cultural apparatus" behind them (6). From this perspective, more than just Renaissance humanism is rejected insofar as "good books" are much more widely inclusive. An even deeper layer is added: by rejecting Milton, Abbey implic- itly rejects the entire Christian tradition with which Milton is so intimately connected. He lays the groundwork for this direction of his thought at the beginning of the chapter through its title, "Serpents of Paradise," which evokes the Garden of Eden myth. But unlike in the creation myth, serpents in Desert Solitaire are not agents of deception but coequals with people, as previously demonstrated. Second, he alludes to the book of Job to oppose the Judeo -Christian tradition. In the opening lines of the first paragraph, he describes the desert wind: "Not until the afternoon does the wind begin to blow, raising dust and sand in funnel- shaped twisters that spin across the desert briefly, like dancers, and then collapse - whirlwinds from which issue no voice or word except the</page><page sequence="12">114 WESTERN AMERICAN LITERATURE SUMMER 2008 forlorn moan of the elements under stress" (15). This reminds us of God speaking to Job "out of the whirlwind" (38:1 ). In Abbey's account, how- ever, the message from phenomena is not from God and has nothing to do with people; its only message is to announce the "forlorn moan of the elements under stress." He returns to this theme later in the passage mentioned about imagination. To make the point, I place the cogent portion before us again: Whirlwinds dance across the salt flats, a pillar of dust by day; the thornbush breaks into flame at night. What does it mean? It means nothing. It is as it is and has no need for meaning. (194) Abbey's mention of "whirlwinds" (again), "pillar of dust," and "the thorn- bush [that] breaks into flame at night" allude to biblical passages in which God speaks through nature. The "whirlwind" allusion has been noted; in Exodus, God leads the Israelites by day with a "pillar of a cloud" and "by night in a pillar of fire" (13:21) and again when an "angel of the Lord appear[s] unto him [Moses] in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush" (3:2). These allusions subvert the biblical texts insofar as any presence of God within nature or otherwise drops out of the picture completely. Allusions to Milton and to biblical texts are important because they allow Abbey further to shape his ideas about relationships among nature, people, tradition, and a higher realm. He first questions spiritual and philosophical traditions in general through rejecting Milton's "good books" and then focuses on the Judeo -Christian tradition to reject its creation myth that places God and man over nature. In context with the references to Thoreau, Emerson, and Coleridge, we can see Abbey piecing together a cosmology. Its details present nature as having its own value and meaning (if any) independent of people. And if a higher world even exists, it is remote, shadowy - removed from any direct par- ticipation with nature and people, aloof like Shelley's Mont Blanc. It is also worth mentioning that "Serpents of Paradise" is the second chapter and thus its allusions serve as bedrock for the narrative. Abbey returns to the Christian tradition later but with a different tack. He now uses literary references to question Christianity's efficacy to supply meaning. One instance can be found in "Down the River." There he plays off of Christian hymns to infer the failure of religion to supply answers to essential questions. Involved in a philosophical conversation with Ralph Newcomb, Abbey asks, "For godsake where do we come from?" (162). The ensuing brief exchange between the two dismisses the question as unknowable and ostensibly not important:</page><page sequence="13">David D. Joplin 115 "Who knows." "Where are we going?" "Who cares." "Who?" "Who." Words fail. I draw the rusty harmonica from my shirt pocket and play old folksongs. (162) Abbey then continues with "the Sunday-morning songs out of [his] boy- hood: What a friend we have in Jesus . . . . Leaning , leaning , leaning on the everlasting arms" and concludes with "We Shall Gather by the River" (163). Ironically, ideas and assumptions within the hymns would seem- ingly provide answers to their questions, a fact which plays against the accumulated effect of the passage, suggesting knowledge about origin (where do we come from?) and destiny (where are we going?) is beyond reach and probably not even important anyway because nobody cares. Dragging ideas about God into the picture through allusions to Christian hymns emphasizes the rejection of traditional answers to such questions. The darkest and most overt rejection of the Christian tradition, however, manifests itself undoubtedly in "Rocks" through the Billy-Joe narrative with its allusions to the crucifixion and redemption. Although the parallels between Jesus and Billy-Joe as a savior figure are limited, Billy-Joe's youthful innocence nevertheless does represent saintly quali- ties of purity and innocence that could ostensibly save a culture gripped by greed and materialism. Billy-Joe alone among the group is untouched by greed. He is along not for any selfish reasons but to help his father, Albert T. Husk. And it is Billy-Joe who has misgivings about Graham (his father's would-be partner, who ends up killing him) all along, warn- ing his family that this man suspiciously "smiled too much" (69). In this respect, Billy-Joe's innocence gives him a moral clarity superior to the more experienced adults. As for the father, Terrell Dixon claims that Husk is "appropriately" named because he is "the spiritually empty man who prospects the Canyon country," a shell with no heart (37). It is not a far reach to see how Billy-Joe's yet Unfällen nature epitomizes quali- ties of innocence and purity that could prevent his world from being consumed by greed, anger, and selfishness. Suffering also plays a major role. Abbey describes the boy's desperate condition after he has fallen off the cliff and awakens the next morning, half-dead: "The rising sun discovered the boy still alive, stirring feebly in the sand. After some time, moaning softly, he got up on his knees. One eye was swollen shut. His left arm hung limply from a dislocated</page><page sequence="14">John DePuy. SUN ARCH SERIES I. 2004. Oil on canvas. 36" x 48". Courtesy of the artist. 116 Western American Literature Summer 2008 shoulder. When he tried to lift his arm a wave of pain surged through his body. Nausea rose from his bowels" (75). In context, the boys suffering calls to mind the suffering of Jesus after he was scourged. Also, like Jesus, Billy-Joe does not deserve any of the pain inflicted upon him. At this point, Abbey plays against the crucifixion to show a much different world. This occurs through complex layers of allusion. One is the sun/Son pun. The "rising sun" is described as watching the badly injured boy. In this case, the "rising sun" is not the resurrected Son of Man, as would be traditionally expected, but rather, as we find out a little later, it is "the inescapable eye of the golden desert sun" and noth- ing more (79). Furthermore, the image of the "eye" here is not the tra- ditional representation of Gods eye, watching and helping. It is merely the sun.6 The contrast between Abbey's stark reality and the Christian mythos has a chilling effect. The quality of visions the suffering boy experiences adds another dimension to the biblical allusions. Within the context of the crucifix- ion imagery, one would anticipate that near death, one has a heightened awareness of divine presence. However, this is not the case for Billy-Joe. Suffering more and more, he has visions not of redemption at the hands of a divine being but rather of an ethereal beauty. Abbey describes how the suffering boy sees a bush "alive, each of its many branches writhing</page><page sequence="15">David D. Joplin 117 in a sort of dance and all clothed in a luminous aura of . . . fiery blue, flame-like yellow. As he watched the bush became larger, more active, brighter and brighter. Suddenly it exploded into fire" (76)7 However, just as one expects the voice of God to speak, Billy-Joe devolves into "whimpering," acutely aware of his suffering from which he receives no relief (76). The bush, previously alive with radiance, now becomes just a bush, nothing more. Rather than God watching his agonizing effort to survive, "ravens [watch] him go, croaking with satisfaction" (77). Exhausted and now near death, suffering greatly, the boy finally reaches a dry wash with a dead cottonwood tree. This becomes his cross. Abbey's description is stark and unmistakable: "He crawled into the shade of a giant cottonwood tree, long dead, that lay across the stream- bed with its roots exposed and its bare limbs pointing up the canyon" (78). After a flashflood washes the tree with the naked boy clinging to its branches into the river, an eerie account follows of the boy's floating down the river: "And as the tree drifted . . . through the immense silence, the light came down on his naked body from above" (79). Traditionally, "silence" and "light" attend spiritual awakening, but here they do not. Abbey's sun rises no higher than the sky from which its light and heat "[sear] his flesh" and "[bake] his brain within its skull" (79). Billy-Joe is finally discovered and an attempt is made to save his life. But "after three days" of lingering near death, he slips away. In contrast, three days after his death, Jesus is resurrected. Billy-Joe, on the other hand, finds relief only in death, which is a dead end, just like nature itself with its physical boundaries that are seemingly impenetrable. All through the account, from his suffering to finding the tree and finally dying, crucifixion imagery creates a sobering effect. Just as in the previous cases, allusion distances the narrative from Christian episte- mologa Abbey cannot affirm a world of divine love and eternal life. Instead, he presents a universe in which nature replaces a supreme being and looks indifferently down upon the plight of man. In this account, even the blameless and innocent end up dead and unredeemed. Allusion allows Abbey to make his point concisely, economically, and very powerfully. At this point in the narrative, Abbey is at his darkest. He has found Medusa rather than God. Thus far, we've seen how Abbey uses allusion to question and some- times reject romantic idealism and religion. Common to both is an inabil- ity to see beyond the physical world. Not encountering a spiritual impulse or God through phenomena, he finds rock-hard surface. In this regard, he has aligned himself with the British empirical tradition, a fact empha- sized through references to Samuel Johnson. Abbey states that "to refute</page><page sequence="16">118 Western American Literature Summer 2008 the solipsist or the metaphysical idealist all that you have to do is take him out and throw a rock at his head: if he ducks he's a liar" (97). This hints at James BoswelPs account of Samuel Johnson's refuting Bishop Berkeley's idealism by "striking his foot with mighty force against a large stone, till he rebounded from it," stating, "I refute it thus" (122). BoswelPs colorful account shows Johnson's rejecting subjective for empirical expe- rience.8 The empirical Abbey has been well recognized in critical com- mentary. Twining, for example, acknowledges that Abbey's "is primarily a skeptical and empirical mind" ("Edward Abbey" 10) and that he was "essentially ... a contemporary American product of the Enlightenment . . . [and thus] a rationalist and, in a fundamental sense, a materialist" ("Roots" 21). Russell Burrows adds that "Abbey strove to stay within the bounds of Locke's careful, rational empiricism" (285). This orientation, needless to say, is consistent with Abbey's rejection of Thoreau and oth- ers who are rooted in idealism, as noted earlier. The empirical Abbey, however, with his concomitant darkness is only part of the picture. He does not rest there. Instead, he paradoxically finds himself just as often pulled in the opposite direction, which comprises the second facet of his thought. During these moments, he is swept up into a higher world of mystery and wonder to show his romantic side. Along these lines, Harold Alderman describes Abbey as "a nontheological mystic whose religious temperament could find no doctrinal expression" (141). Be this as it may, when it comes to admit- ting a higher world actually exists, Abbey balks. He cannot bring him- self to do it, as exemplified in the chapter "Tukuhnikivats, the Island in the Desert": after trying for "cosmic intuitions" on top of the mountain, he "end[s] up earthbound as always" (227). And herein allusion, again, comes prominently into play. Since Abbey cannot affirm a higher world in so many words, he allows romantic works to speak for him. In these instances, however, he takes a different approach. This time, he lets them stand. This quietly keeps alive metaphysical possibilities that else- where Abbey has either rejected or delimited. In this way, the darkness of his empirical side counters the brightness of his romantic one, letting Wordsworth, Keats, and Byron play pivotal roles. An important example is the incorporation of a line from Words- worth's "It Is a Beauteous Evening, Calm and Free." In "Down the River," Abbey describes a relaxing evening after a day's rafting: "It is a beauteous evening , calm and free!1 This is word for word the first line of</page><page sequence="17">David D. Joplin 119 Wordsworth's sonnet (159), But here Abbey does not set up a contrast- ing agenda as he so often does in other instances. Instead, he simply continues with romantic descriptions of the landscape. Because he does not counter Wordsworth's poem, its epistemology spills unqualified into Abbey's narrative and thus competes with sections of his writing that give contrary views. For example, in the sonnet, Wordsworth makes claims with which the self-consciously "earthbound" Abbey would undoubtedly quarrel if he stopped to think about them. Wordsworth states, "The gentleness of heaven broods o'er the Sea: / Listen! the mighty Being is awake, / And doth with his eternal motion make / A sound like thunder - everlastingly." Throughout the narrative, Abbey has repeatedly balked at such unabashed affirmation of a divine pres- ence through nature. But here he lets it stand, and that he does so demonstrates how allusion keeps the competing view alive. For that matter, Abbey himself states that "the romantic view, while not the whole of truth, is a necessary part of the whole truth" (167). When he is "feeling" and not "thinking," he is drawn into nature along romantic channels - the very ones he resists through his rational thought. The reference to Wordsworth's sonnet is interesting for another rea- son. In the sestet, Wordsworth assures his daughter Caroline that God is with her even if others "know it not." Such an idea affirms a divine force independent of self-conscious awareness. If this is the case, then Abbey's inability to sustain participation with the romantic side of nature does not cancel it. It's there; he just can't find it or hold on to it when he does. Allusions such as this one alongside those that reject or delimit the divine in nature keep the debate alive: Abbey just can't make up his mind, as he's pulled this way and that, epitomizing his predicament. It must be added that the allusion to Wordsworth's sonnet is direct and unmistakable, whereas many other works are invoked with much more subtlety so that connections must be inferred. This would seem to provide greater provenance to the more direct ones and by extension to their ideas. In that case, Abbey privileges the romantic rather than the empirical side of the equation, with his "heart" gaining the upper hand. Yet another instance that allows romantic ideals to stand can be found in "Water" through allusion to Wordsworth's "Surprised by Joy - Impatient as the Wind." This poem draws upon a higher world from which Wordsworth experiences a momentary felt presence of his dead daughter, Catherine: Surprised by joy - impatient as the Wind I turned to share the transport - Oh! with whom</page><page sequence="18">120 WESTERN AMERICAN LITERATURE SUMMER 2008 But Thee [Catherine], deep buried in the silent tomb, That spot which no vicissitude can find? The allusion is to the opening phrase "Surprised by joy," which Abbey echoes in his description of a flash flood: "Surprised by delight, I stood there in the heat, the bright sun, the quiet afternoon" (120), Inasmuch as the romantic epistemology of the poem is not countered, its assump- tion of a higher world is drawn into Abbey's passage. From this vantage, "delight" infers a spiritual antecedent correlative to the raw energy of the "flash flood" - the object of "delight." Ironically, the tables are now turned as Abbey briefly glimpses nature through Emerson's eye, counter- ing the earlier view that argued against the "natural fact" as a "symbol of some spiritual fact." Also in "Water," Abbey draws from Keats's "Endymion" for a similar effect. The allusion occurs in the description of a desert oasis: "the tiny oasis formed by the drilled well, its windmill and storage tank" make "a distinctive human contribution" to the desert landscape (126). He goes on to say, "The windmill with its skeleton tower and creaking vanes is an object of beauty as significant in its way as the cottonwood tree, and the open tank at its foot, big enough to swim in, is a thing of joy to man and beast, no less worthy of praise than the desert spring" (126, emphases added). The passage brings to mind the opening lines of Keats's poem: A thing of beauty is a joy for ever: Its loveliness increases; it will never Pass into nothingness; but still will keep A bower quiet for us, and a sleep Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing. (1205) Abbey's two phrases "object of beauty" and "thing of joy" echo the first line of the poem, which collapses the two phrases into a single statement that syntactically (noun plus prepositional phrase, used nominally) and semantically (quality of joy in nature) matches Abbey's phrases. In addition, the tone of Abbey's passage approximates the tone of the poem: both are quiet, almost reverential toward their topics. And the topic for both writers is nature - the object linked to "beauty." For Keats, this includes the "sun, the moon, / Trees old, and young," and "daffodils I With the green world they live in" (1205) - and so on; for Abbey, it is a "desert oasis." Keats goes on to say how this "beauty" provides a comfort for a troubled spirit: "in spite of all, / Some shape of beauty moves away the pall / From our dark spirits" (1205). Once the</page><page sequence="19">David D. Joplin 121 bridge is built through recognition of the poem, all of these ideas pass unabated into Abbey's passage. In addition, when Abbey presents the windmill with its water tank as having been subsumed by the desert landscape, he alludes to the second stanza of the Keats poem, which extends beauty to encompass man-made items that themselves have become organically linked to the landscape, in this case a temple: Nor do we merely feel these essences [beauty in nature] For one short hour; no, even as the trees That whisper round a temple become soon Dear as the temple's self, so does the moon, The passion poesy, glories infinite, Haunt us till they become a cheering light Unto our souls ... (1205-6) The "temple" has become existentially unified with nature ("trees" and "moon") to affect consciousness. Abbey's "oasis" with its "windmill" - his "thing of joy" - is presented along similar lines, as a "distinctive human contribution" to the landscape that has become part and parcel of nature itself and thus a contributor to beauty, which, in Keats's words, is the "cheering light / Unto our souls." Abbey would likely never use such language; and he does not have to because Keats uses it for him through the allusion. Here, as in the case of Wordsworth's poems, Abbey lets the epistemological implications stand uncontested. The romantic impulse is thus not checked, as it is often elsewhere in the narrative. In drawing on Keats, one can see much more clearly how the romantic side of Abbey is swept up by his heart as he feels the beauty radiant within nature. Allusions such as these draw a romantic depth into Abbey's nar- rative that competes with the rational side of his experience.9 When factored together, romantic and empirical views established largely through allusions collide, creating a tug of war between head and heart. In this respect, one can spot two Abbeys: one who thinks with his head and another who feels through his heart, swept up into wonder. Competition between the two lies at the bottom of the narra- tive and comprises Abbey's core experience. The conflicting views often culminate in supreme moments of romantic irony in which Abbey no sooner gives one view than he takes it away. That the paradox is never resolved partly explains the narrative's enduring power. This conflict at the center of Desert Solitaire has been widely acknowledged. Bryant, for example, states that Abbey "struggles] with his own oscillation between romanticism and hard-eyed realism" (13). Burrows frames the conflict</page><page sequence="20">122 Western American Literature Summer 2008 as a dialectic between epistemologa and ontology, as knowledge com- petes with being. Put in Abbey s language, at one moment he sees God, at another Medusa. The final kind of allusions I will address epitomizes this vacillation between opposing epistemologies. These occur in short passages that soar toward epiphany but then suddenly reverse to fall back into familiar empirical territory. The result is a comic effect that allows contradictory views to coexist. But before dealing with how allusion contributes to the picture, we must examine a representative passage to demonstrate how it juxtaposes the two realities against each other. One example comes early in the narrative, a description of a beautiful desert evening: [F]or the time being . . . the air is untroubled, and I become aware for the first time today of the immense silence in which I am lost. Not a silence so much as a great stillness - for there are a few sounds: the creak of some bird in a juniper tree, an eddy of wind which passes and fades like a sigh, the ticking of the watch on my wrist - slight noises which break the sensation of absolute silence . . . , overwhelming peace. A suspension of time, a continuous present. If I look at the small device strapped to my wrist the numbers, even the sweeping second hand, seem meaningless, almost ridiculous. ... [F]or a few moments I feel and realize that I am very much alone. There is nothing to do but return to the trailer, open a can of beer, eat my supper. (11-12) Through the diction and tone used in the first paragraph, the reader anticipates an imminent spiritual insight since "immense silence," "great stillness," "overwhelming peace," and "suspension of time" point in the direction of a mystical experience, a possibility consistent with the sublime, serene, majestic, almost reverential tone. But just as Abbey approaches the expected epiphany, he suddenly changes directions. Instead of discovering a divine presence, he goes home to drink beer. The jolting turn from one world to another is further stressed by the structure of the passage. Juxtaposition of the one-sentence concluding paragraph to the much longer first paragraph emphasizes the abrupt reversal. The sudden turn with its comic incongruity questions the pos- sible transcendence in the first paragraph, thus both are sustained.</page><page sequence="21">David D. Joplin 123 The two worlds held up in the quoted section are transparent enough at face value, but allusion adds to the picture. Through its tonal shift and structure, the passage invokes Byron's Don Juan . To make the point, I offer stanza 38 of canto 1, which briefly describes Juan's back- ground and education: Sagest of women, even of widows, she [Inez, Juan's mother] Resolved that Juan should be quite a paragon, And worthy of the noblest pedigree: (His sire was Castile, his dam from Aragon). Then for accomplishments of chivalry, In case our lord the king should go to war again, He learned the arts of riding, fencing, gunnery, And how to scale a fortress - or a nunnery. (904) Byron maintains a serious tone until the last line, which suddenly and unexpectedly undercuts the first seven lines. In a similar fashion, Abbey's conclusion - the single sentence, second paragraph - takes a completely unexpected turn that undercuts the much longer first paragraph, as noted. And like Byron's, Abbey's sudden reversal is a terse statement tacked onto the end of a serious discourse. In this respect, although one is prose and the other ottava rima, one can see how Abbey's passage tonally and struc- turally matches Byron's poem, comically reversing itself to undermine, but not to cancel, the main idea. The allusion emphasizes the effect. Additionally, the comic juxtaposition of opposites creates romantic irony, which, as is well known, lies at the heart of Donjuán.10 The allu- sion to Byron's poem amplifies the romantic irony of Abbey's passage. This further contributes to the narrative as a whole because romantic irony plays such a major role, embedded as it is in the conflict between opposing views. Finally, the allusion also draws upon Byron's own skep- ticism about romantic idealism, which in turn works against the serious component of Abbey's passage. Needless to say, Byron does not shy away from attacking such things in Don Juan Finally, we are left wondering what exactly Abbey has found. He frames his quest as an effort to find out if the world is deeper than stone surface - the "God or Medusa" of his thesis. But to say which he has discovered or to piece together a cosmology in any sharply defined way remains difficult. While some allusions cancel romantic channels of Abbey's thought, others just as powerfully restore them, and still oth- ers allow for both to exist simultaneously. To get the complete picture, contrasting parts must be engaged to see how they play against each other to form a larger whole. At times, one wonders if Abbey himself</page><page sequence="22">124 Western American Literature Summer 2008 is not confused as he is pulled in different directions. It may be that, epistemologically, he epitomizes the urge to accommodate secular and spiritual experience within a higher principle, but in a world where, for many, traditions that normally answer such questions have failed. In any event, ultimately, he faces a conundrum that he cannot resolve. Like Matthew Arnold, Abbey is u[w]andering between two worlds" (Arnold 187). But unlike for Arnold, for Abbey "one" is not "dead" and "the other powerless to be born" (Arnold 187) - both are there; he just can- not seem to put them together in a definitive way, or at least in a way that satisfies his urge to know a final truth. If there is a final truth Abbey points to, it must be one that in some mysterious way contains both God and Medusa - but held at arm's length through some even higher force perhaps. If this is true, would the next chapter about Abbey's search for meaning need to address Abbey and Blake? Notes 1 . As Abbey criticism has aptly demonstrated, Desert Solitaire can scarcely be engaged without some mention of how Abbey has used the literary and intellectual past. Among the most comprehensive studies of allusion is prob- ably David J. Rothman's "'I'm a humanist': The Poetic Past in Desert Solitaire ." Rothman sees allusion as central to the book, commenting that Abbey's "cun- ning use of what we could call the imaginative past . . . [which] includes as much literature, philosophy, music, political theory, and other humanistic realms as possible - is in fact crucial to his mission as a writer" (48). Rothman's purpose is to offer "readings" of how "Abbey engages" literary and philosophical tradi- tions through a "wide range of techniques" (51). My essay builds upon such studies by specifically focusing on how allusions shape epistemologa a topic not heretofore addressed in this particular way. In addition, my study, for the most part, concentrates on allusions Rothman and others have not recognized. For a review of criticism of Abbey's use of allusion, see Rothman 69nl. 2. Abbey himself has not been silent on the topic. Much of his essay "Down the River with Henry Thoreau" is a meditation on Thoreau's and Emerson's thought. He states, "Thoreau's mind has been haunting mine now for most of my life" (Down the River 13). For a more comprehensive critical survey of Abbey's connection to Thoreau, see Paul T. Bryant's "The Structure and Unity of Desert Solitaire " 16-17. 3. Abbey was well aware of Thoreau s use of the flute. In Down the River with Henry Thoreau," he imagines a conversation between Emily Dickinson and Thoreau in which Thoreau answers Dickinson's question, "raising his flute" (Down the River 22). In the same essay, ostensibly in connection to Waiden , Abbey goes on to wonder what "tunes" Thoreau played "on that flute of his" (23). James M. Cahalan has noted Abbey's attraction to the flute and his connection to Thoreau through it: "During 1949-50, in addition to his</page><page sequence="23">David D. Joplin 125 ongoing work in philosophy and English, Abbey continued to take flute classes, doing quite well at what became his chosen, lifelong instalment (perhaps in imitation of his hero, Thoreau). . . . That fall, ... he met Jean Schmechel, who retained ... an image of him walking down the street 'playing the flute like Pan'" (40). Abbey describes his own playing as follows: "Coyotes howl at us . . . when I rile them some with my flute - they seem partial to 'Greensleeves,' played on the upper register" (Down the River 62). His knowledge of Thoreau and his own interest in playing the flute ground the allusion in Desert Solitaire . 4. See Rothman 65-66 for his full treatment of the allusion. 5. Abbeys allusion to John Donne's "Meditation 17" in "The Dead Man at Grandview Point" further undermines Christian humanism. In contemplating death, Abbey muses, "Each man's death diminishes me? Not necessarily" (214). This echoes Donne's well-known passage beginning, "No man is an island, entire of itself. . . . Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind" (1278). Like Milton, Donne sees man as the apex of God's creation. Earlier in the meditation, Donne writes that "all of mankind is of one author and is one volume, when one man dies, one chapter is not torn out of the book but translated into better language. ... God's hand is in every translation" (1277-78). In contrast, Abbey sees death in purely physical terms, as a "ruth- less, brutal process" whose end mark is decomposition into nature (214). 6. For a background of the "image of the eye," see Ananda K. Cooma- raswamy's "Windows of the Soul." Coomaraswamy gives an erudite summary of the world's scriptures on the significance of the divine "eye." Representative is Meister Eckhart's statement, "The eye with which I see God is the same eye with which God sees in me: my eye and God's eye, that is one eye and one vision, one knowledge and one love" (qtd. in Coomaraswamy 54). 7. Thanks to my colleague William Johnson, a former Idaho Writer-in- Residence, who pointed out to me that this is another play on the burning bush. I am indebted to both Johnson and Alexandra H. Olsen of the University of Denver for their close reading of early drafts and subsequent helpful suggestions. 8. Abbey admired Johnson and felt at least some kinship with him. To explain why he writes, Abbey says, "I write to make a difference. 'It is always a writer's duty,' said Samuel Johnson, 'to make the world better'" ( One Life 178). In an interview, he makes a similar statement: "Entertainment is a good and sufficient reason to write. However, the writers I most admire have some moral purpose in mind. Samuel Johnson said it is a writer's duty to make the world better. I'll go along with that" (Abbey, "Interview" 55). 9. For commentary on Abbey's allusion to Keats's "On First Looking into Chapman's Homer," see Rothman 51-52. 10. For an in-depth study of romantic irony, see Anne K. Mellor's English Romantic Irony, especially chapter 1, "The Paradigm of Romantic Irony," and chapter 2, "Byron: 'Half Dust, Half Deity.'" Mellor refers to Donjuán as "that locus classicus of English romantic irony" (31).</page><page sequence="24">126 Western American Literature Summer 2008 11. See, for example, the "Dedication" in Donjuán , especially stanzas 1 through 8, where Byron attacks the "Lakers." Also see stanza 205 of canto 1, where Byron targets Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey. Although Byron is playful in his attacks, the underlying skepticism about romantic views con- tained within the poetry remains clear. Works Cited Abbey, Edward.
