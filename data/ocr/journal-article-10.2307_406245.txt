The larger European reception accorded the works of Per Olof Sundman has been exclusively positive. The French translation of The Expedition prompted Le Monde's literary page to proclaim "a renewal of Swedish literature," and Michel Butor's preface to the novel was lavish in praise and admiration. A British critic described Sundman as a "serious novelist trying to evolve new techniques for the novel, a form which has become all too suburban in our English language." In Germany, the novel Two Days, Two Nights was described by Helmut Heissenbfittel as "incomparable in contemporary European literature, " and Alfred Andersch greeted Sundman's ap- pearance on the literary scene as "ein literarisches Weltereignis." In Per Olof Sundman: Writer of the North, Lars Warme addresses himself to the reasons behind Sundman's literary successes, to the "subtext" of his authorship and the qualities which render it an important contribution to the Western novelistic tradition. After a biographical sketch in which Warme emphasizes the important formative factors for Sundman's authorship- his lengthy stay in the barren reaches of Norrland where he encountered a form of speech of unparalleled precision and exactitude, his absorption of the teachings of the Uppsala school of philosophy and of the behaviorists, and his political activities as a member of the Swedish parliament and of the Nordic Council-, the author analyzes all Sundman's work to date. It is not, perhaps, surprising that the chapters on the short story collections and on the two expedition novels should be the most rewarding, as these are far and away the strongest works to come from Sundman's pen. While adapting his method to each</page><page sequence="2">166 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Winter 1986 of the works under discussion (The Flight of the Eagle as documentary novel, The Story of Sdm as Icelandic saga, for instance), Warme's study derives its cohesion and importance from his perspicacious pursuit of the two dominant practical and philosophical concerns in Sundman's corpus: politics and language. As a political writer, Sundman is concerned with man as a political animal, in the Aristotelian sense of the term, with exploring the social realities of mankind and with exposing the social structures and the mechanisms which underlie functioning societies and which have far-reaching ramifications for the individuals in them. Sundman contends that: A person must be placed in relation to other people and to an environment in order to have significance and form. An isolated person simply does not exist. Or, to borrow a formulation from mathematics: a human being must be expressed in something-in an environment and, most particularly, in fellow human beings (p. 40). But, as Warme cogently argues, Sundman's perception of the pervasively political nature of human reality has extensive consequences for his art. The author incisively and insightfully analyzes Sundman's unique style as a function of this perception. Confronted, like most modern novelists, with a crisis in the state of language, Sundman's strategy is at the opposite extreme of that chosen by Joyce in his effort to reconquer language. Like the practitioners of the nouveau roman, Sudman is imbued with an innate respect for the "freedom" and even autonomy of every conceivable object, including his fellow man, and consequently refuses to go beyond the surface of phenomena, to speculate about inner processes or psychological motivations. He possesses an acute awareness of language as the repository of conventions and traditional patterns of apprehending reality and rejects all linguistic forms which contaminate objects with a nonexistent interiority and anthropomorphism (a tendency which Warme convincingly traces back to Sundman's repudiation of Freud in favor of Pavlov's reflexology and Watson's behaviorism). Sundman works instead to revitalize language and literature through a strengthening of its fibers from within, through an intensity of precision and exactitude of language which the New Statesman valorizes as "Sundman's relentless and devastating style." The author is, then, simply a recorder of facts, literature a revelation of facts about which the reader must draw his or her own conclusions. Warme continues on to argue persuasively that Sundman's frequently ambiguous and inconclusive endings are a further demonstration of his phenomenological con- cerns. His prose seems suffused by a kind of provocative mysticism, a mysticism not metaphysical but human, not psychological but ontological. This tendency is grounded in an epistemological nihilism characteristic of much of contemporary literature, but the combination of the extremely precise observation of detail and the refusal to indulge in interpretation or evaluation of phenomena imparts to Sundman's prose an aesthetic effect of hallucinatory clarity and impenetrable mystery and enigma. Although Warme's book might have benefited from a more conscientious copy editor, the fact remains that it is an important work not only for Scandinavianists but for anyone interested in the state of the Western novel and of the potentialities of that form for aesthetically rendering our fragile and fractionate reality.
