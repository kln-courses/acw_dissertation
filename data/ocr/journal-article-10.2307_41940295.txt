<plain_text><page sequence="1">718 Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs Demystifying Gnostic Scientismi Steve Fuller Thomas powerful Less framework Ys "Gnostic for Scientism understanding and the the Prohibition movement of of Questions" modern science suggests in a powerful framework for understanding the movement of modern science in public affairs. However, I sometimes felt that Lessi was more interested in using "gnosticism" as a catchall term to stigmatize all defenses of evolutionary theory than actually to reveal the gnostic character of those defenses, when they are indeed gnostic. Therefore, I shall argue that gnostic scientism should be understood as a more circumscribed, but no less significant, phenomenon than Lessi claims. As Lessl's own examples show, it is more prevalent in biology than physics, but not all Darwinists are gnostics. I begin by recalling what it is about gnosticism that has tra- ditionally led to its anathematization by a wide range of religious and political authorities. There are two general ways of thinking about the relationship between the ideal and the real, especially as it is played out in humans as "mind" and "matter." One way is to suppose that each is incomplete without the other, the other that the two are irreconcilable opposites. In the former case, matter is necessary to realize the mind's capacities; in the latter, it drags down or inhibits those capacities. The for- mer way thus aims for an integration of mind and matter, whereas the latter way aims for the purification of mind from matter. In each set of alternatives, the latter is the way of the gnostic. There is considerable controversy over who is and is not rightly seen as a gnos- tic, since the term is usually applied pejoratively. For example, in his early "human- ist" writings, which were influenced by Hegel's secularization of Christian eschatology, Marx was not a gnostic. However, as Marxists increasingly stressed the need for a revolutionary break with past political practice, their gnostic tendencies came into view. Generally speaking, a rough-and-ready test for gnosticism is to ask whether ordinary people can come to a radically different understanding of their world without destroying that world in the process. The gnostic says no for three reasons: a rather literal belief in the power of ideas to change the world, such that truly revolutionary ideas contain the potential for mass destruction; a vivid sense of popular resistance to new ideas that combines contempt and awe of "the masses"; and an overriding distrust in the legitimacy of existing institutions. Gnosticism is elusive because it has licensed extreme responses on both ends of the political spectrum. For example, that consummate anti-democrat Plato is rea- sonably counted as a gnostic because he connected the fall of Athens to the corrup- tion of civic virtue that came from the volatile intellectual climate fostered by the Steve Fuller is Professor of Sociology at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom.</page><page sequence="2">Forum 719 sophists. Plato held that public displays of dialectical virtuosity cloud political judg- ment to such an extent that the dialectic must be cultivated esoterically until initi- ates have learned to be discriminating in its application, so as not to incite the masses unnecessarily. At the same time, however, self-styled revolutionaries of the modern period, ranging from the English Puritans to the French republicans and the Marxist party vanguard, have proceeded from Plato's gnostic premises to con- clusions that radically democratized the social order, precisely by inciting the masses to overturn established hierarchies. Note that whichever extreme they occupy, gnostics do not work within the polit- ical establishment because they see themselves as accountable to a higher law to which only their party has access. This is the most damning charge that the conser- vative political theorist Eric Voegelin lodged against gnosticism in many profound historical studies of the phenomenon.1 It also helps explain Lessl's main complaint against his scientific gnostics, namely, their "prohibition of questions" over funda- mentals, which in turn reflects a contempt for the intellectual standing of the public. Rhetorically speaking, such prohibition may be manifested as disparagement, demo- nization, or suppression, depending on the political means at the gnostic's disposal. A Brief Genealogy of Scientific Gnosticism There is a well-established tradition in the historiography of early modern science that appeals to gnostic elements. These elements are typically grounded in a "dou- ble truth doctrine," which is to say, one for the gnostic elite and the other for the conformist masses. The ideological stratification of Plato's Republic is the model for this sensibility, which is detectable in activities ranging from Galileo's fabrication of experiments for public consumption to Newton's secret forays into alchemy and divination. However, the anchor point for this tradition is the schism that arose in twelfth-century Islam between Baghdad's leading theologian, Al Ghazali, and the distinguished philosopher- jurist of Cordoba, Averroes.2 Al Ghazali and Averroes agreed that the Qur'an presents serious interpretive dif- ficulties for the reader, both in terms of internal inconsistencies and contradictions with facts known by other means. Averroes proposed the double truth doctrine as a way out, namely, that philosophers should secretly sort out truth from falsity in the Qur'an, while the Qur'an's validity continues to be promulgated as religious propaganda. Al Ghazali treated this proposal as blasphemous for placing human above divine intelligence: Truth is one and for all. The fact that authorities are in conflict may mean that a higher- order integration of knowledge sources is needed or, in the worst case, that reality is ultimately mysterious. It certainly does not imply that philosophy can adjudicate in private the truth of theological claims. Secular accounts of this debate today present Al Ghazali and Averroes as, respectively, the voices of religious fundamentalism and scientific modernity. As a</page><page sequence="3">720 Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs retrospective judgment, there is some justification. Islam's scientific contributions began to decline shortly after the schism, as Averroes' followers migrated to Western Europe, where they pursued philosophy free of theological strictures (mainly because Christian authorities could not enforce their will as easily as Muslim ones). Averroists were responsible for the European rediscovery of the Aristotelian corpus (which injected materialism and empiricism into a philosoph- ical culture heretofore dominated by Plato) and the idea that even God is bound by the laws of nature (and hence theology may be safely ignored in the conduct of science). Averroism bore its most lasting fruit in the school of natural philosophers at the University of Padua who trained Galileo. However, some deeper questions may be asked about this episode that vindicate Lessl's worries about today's version of scientific gnosticism. Is it not strange to hold simultaneously that truth is universal yet only an elite is mentally fit to grasp it? Even without Al Ghazali's interests in stabilizing the Muslim community, there is a conceptual problem that the West has failed to address adequately, as it gradually recoiled from the Enlightenment project of integrating science into people's lives. Put the point in perspective: Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson lacked the problem of harmonizing scientific and religious concerns that came to haunt intel- lectuals after the French Revolution of 1789. In this respect, the vexed history of positivism - a movement born of the failure of that revolt - has updated the history of Platonism for the modern period. Auguste Comte's vision of a clergy of scientific experts would have replaced the Roman Catholic Church, just as Plato would have had specially trained philosopher-kings replace the ruling families of Athens.3 The deep problem here is epitomized in the observation that, by definition, "progress" can never occur all at once. The very concept implies that most people are out of step with an elite few. But whereas traditional elitists used this observa- tion to justify perpetual rule by aristocratic deference, progressives would have the people come to match their "betters." But how does one then proceed? Does one imagine, as Lenin did, a party vanguard that drags the backward masses kicking and screaming? Or, does one engage in a subtler version of the same strategy, say, through Platonic myth-making or even the sort of mass civic education that John Stuart Mill and John Dewey championed as a concomitant of democratic political participation? Or, finally, does one conclude, as Hegel did, that the very elite status of so-called progressive truths is itself a sign that perhaps the truths themselves have yet to be completely realized and hence require more sustained open exposure to the rest of society? The Leninist option is pure gnosticism. Mill's and Dewey's middle way, a democ- ratized Platonism, is captured by the idea of state-funded public education at the primary and secondary school levels. Hegel's fully antignostic solution was the modern (that is, Humboldtian) university, which aspires to be the institution of universal enlightenment. Its much vaunted (and periodically derided) ideal of the</page><page sequence="4">Forum 721 "scholar-teacher" is designed to remove the elite character of new research by requiring its incorporation into the curriculum. Although the rhetoric surrounding this ideal has become banal, when taken seriously it has attracted vehement oppo- sition. The modern university's defenders have struggled to show that the benefits of opening up knowledge claims to wider scrutiny outweigh the worst gnostic nightmares. If in the past traditionalists had feared that the free promulgation of new knowledge would destabilize the social order, nowadays "academic capitalists" allege that economic dynamism would be brought to a halt, given the lack of incen- tive to innovate in a completely free market for ideas.4 Both old and new school gnostics share an interest in knowledge as a medium for concentrating, not distrib- uting, power in society. If the university lived up to its Hegelian aspiration, there would be no question about whether intelligent design theory, evolution by natural selection, or for that matter the genetic bases for social traits would be researched and taught. All of them would, on the principle that knowledge is dangerous only when a few are in a posi- tion to turn it to their advantage, be it by virtue of possessing a holy writ, a Ph.D., or a patent. Once again, it is much easier to pay lip service to this ideal than to put it into practice. In particular, the free movement of ideas in a university setting is bound to result in the interpénétration of positions whose gnostic power - for good or ill - had been tied to their spiritual purity or, to continue the economic metaphor, their protected markets. Thus, while I support the teaching and research of intelligent design theory in mainstream universities, it is not in the spirit of the establishment of departments of Creation and Darwinian Science in "separate but equal" facilities on opposite sides of the campus. Rather, I would expect the cross- listing of courses and collaboration of faculty that one normally finds between any two intellectually overlapping disciplines. Among other things, I would hope that Creationists come to see that some of their concerns better are addressed by Darwinists than if left to their own devices - and vice versa.5 If this proposal seems controversial, that may be because biology provides a particular hotbed for gnostic science. Gnostic Science or Just Gnostic Biology? Lessi is certainly correct that contemporary biology is a site for the gnostic mind in action. However, there are more obvious cases than the Darwinists eager to silence Creationist opponents. I refer here to those Darwinists - often the very ones Lessi cites (for example, Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin) - who are keen to dis- credit and prohibit research in the broad areas covered by "sociobiology" and "evo- lutionary psychology." Sometimes these gnostic Darwinists suggest alternative lines of research that would deal more effectively with, say, racial, gender, and other sig- nificant human differences than projects specifically oriented to genetic differences.</page><page sequence="5">722 Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs However, the more common response is to conjure up the specter of Nazi eugenics as sufficient grounds for discouraging a deepening of our knowledge of the rela- tionship between human inheritance and achievement.6 The gnostic presumption here is that the temptations of forbidden genetic knowledge are so great that even citizens of scientifically literate liberal democra- cies - and even with the benefit of hindsight from the Nazi experience - will be prone to repeat the mistakes of the past. Best, then, that these matters be left to eso- teric specialists in the relevant branches of biology, who will ultimately provide an account of the genetic basis of humanity that is fit for popular and policy con- sumption. In the hands of Gould and his occasional co-author, Niles Eldredge, this retreat to esoterica occurs in the course of claiming that evolution acts on multiple ontological levels, ranging from the subcellular to the superorganic. Each requires its own distinct expertise, an account of which must be provided in any compre- hensive theory of evolution. Moreover, these levels are presumed to be of potentially equal causal significance and hence not reducible to "unstable packages of genetic information," as Eldredge says of Richard Dawkins's "selfish gene" hypothesis.7 It would be difficult to overestimate the impact that this version of gnostic Darwinism has had on the social sciences. Sociology textbooks regularly define the realm of "the social" as covering features of the human condition that are relatively untouched by biological causation, especially evolution, even though the most resilient forms of social life - ranging from kinship ties to religious affiliation - have drawn on what can only be called "folk biology" to legitimate themselves. Moreover, sociologists of knowledge should question the ultimate validity of con- ferring metaphysical significance on the contingencies surrounding biology's insti- tutionalization into multiple specialties.8 After all, the most persuasive case that there are multiple levels of biological reality is the presumption that the distinct methods and theories associated with biology's current subfields reflect modes of epistemic access appropriate to these levels. The impetus on both sides of the disciplinary divide for sociology to distinguish itself sharply from biology has accelerated with the disasters associated with Nazi and Soviet eugenic policies.9 While sociology fought many boundary disputes throughout the late nineteenth and early twentiethth centuries, the disciplinary combatants were usually philosophy, law, psychology, economics, or even litera- ture.10 By contrast, the intellectual trade between sociology and biology was rela- tively free and two-way. No less than Auguste Comte had originally argued for the necessity of a science of sociology by appealing to the emergent properties of that intellectually enhanced ape, Homo sapiens. Some of this early openness remains among the minority in both disciplines who still find the idea of "group selection" a useful explanation for human altruism and who associate the persistence of classes and castes with the manipulation of breeding patterns to harden naturally occurring genetic variation into species-like races.11</page><page sequence="6">Forum 723 For these reasons, the gnostic tendencies identified by Lessi pertain more specif- ically to the multiply vexed status of biological knowledge, especially in the twenti- eths century, than any generalized hostilities between science and religion. Indeed, among the most concerted opposition to the rimescale required by Darwin's grad- ualist account of evolution was that from the physics community of his day, notably Lord Kelvin.12 Moreover, the popularizing work of Paul Davies and Steven Hawking continues the long tradition of traffic between physics and theology that started with Newton's image of space and time as the divine sensorium (or "interface," as we would say today). More controversially, but still recognizably within physical sci- ence, some cosmologists believe that interesting scientific findings are to be made by supposing that the universe was constructed so that we may understand it. Specifically, had the parameters of nature's laws been slightly different, we would not be here to observe them. This is little more than the argument from design turned into an empirical research program. When associated with Aristotle and Leibniz, this was called the principle of sufficient reason. Nowadays it is simply known as the "anthropic principle."13 Prolegomena to the Hidden History of Gnostic Biology If modern biology is the main source of what Lessi calls "gnostic science," then a genealogy begs to be written. One striking anchor point is that the biologists most opposed to an interpénétration of biology and theology have tended to specialize in invertebrates and other "lower organisms."14 Both Darwin and Gould were experts on mollusks. Darwin's leading German defender, Ernst Haeckel, worked on sea urchins, and E. O. Wilson was a distinguished entomologist before founding socio- biology.15 Akin to the leveling of secular hierarchies promised by gnostic revolu- tionaries is a vision of species egalitarianism, such that differences between humans and nonhumans are portrayed as matters of degree, not kind. Monotheistic theol- ogy is a clear target here because of the privileged status it accords to humans as having been created "in the image and likeness of God." A less noted consequence is that the secular successor of theology, the idea of a non-natural human science with its own theories and methods ( Geisteswissenschaft ), is equally out of place in the pan-Darwinian universe.16 Despite their more publicized differences, both Gould and Wilson are united in treating the social sciences as little more than a repository of data to be explained by biology, the only question being what sort of biology: one that focuses on the selection of genes (Wilson) or organisms (Gould). To be sure, the latter permits much greater scope for the shaping of environmental contingencies, but nothing sufficiently self-contained and regular to enable a sci- ence of the human to flourish. Still less remarked is the tendency of gnostic biologists to be skeptical of the power of conventional politics to alter the course of evolutionary processes. In</page><page sequence="7">724 Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs practice, many turn out to be libertarians who mask their cynicism with strident defenses of unlimited "free trade" and "academic freedom." Herbert Spencer's "Social Darwinism" is an example of the former, but I want to look briefly at the latter through Darwin's German bulldog, Haeckel. Haeckel's public notoriety began with a debate over the teaching of evolution in the recently unified German school system in 18 77 }7 This debate occurred in the wake of socialist calls for insurrection in order to remove the artificial constraints that class divisions placed on natural selection, which left to its own devices would sweep away the stupid rich in favor of the clever poor.18 Given this explosive com- bination of ideas and actions, many argued that Darwinism should be kept out of the schools, at least until it had become empirically better grounded. Haeckel would have none of this, arguing that any powerful idea could be used by anyone inter- ested in obtaining power, a point he proved by explaining how Bismarck's fellow aristocrats might turn Darwinism to their advantage. However, Haeckel was no political conservative, but simply committed to the promotion of Darwinism under any political regime. In other words, he was indifferent to the prospect of scientific disinterestedness shading into political opportunism.19 Absent from Haeckel's defense of Darwinism was any consideration of the social responsibility of the scientist, the normative concomitant of state-licensed acade- mic freedom. This is in striking contrast to Haeckel's principal opponent, the cellu- lar pathologist Rudolf Virchow.20 Virchow was a prominent member of the Progressive Party, which was in the forefront of labor reform and suffrage extension in the political minefield that was Bismarck's Germany. Despite recognizing more than a grain of truth in Darwinism, Virchow believed that if academics did not reg- ulate their discourse, their guild privileges as free inquirers would be suspended by the Iron Chancellor.21 Virchow provides an example of the much more open boundary between biol- ogy and theology that has been promoted by medical scientists and naturalists working on vertebrates, that is, the animal phylum that includes humanity. For example, when the 18th-century Scottish jurist - and amateur orangutan observer - Lord Monboddo famously proposed a version of species continuism that hypothesized a "missing link" between apes and humans, he had in mind a sec- ular version of the biblical idea that animals "devolved" from humans, but like humans could be redeemed through education. Anthropomorphism could thus be epistemologically justified, if all species are more or less corrupt, but ultimately per- fectible, versions of the human template. Even without the assumption of per- fectibility, anthropomorphism continued to be pursued as a heuristic in animal psychology until the early twentieth century, by which time it had been method- ologically challenged by C. Lloyd Morgan and experimentally undermined by Edward Thorndike. But even then, the rejection of anthropomorphism did not imply that humans differed only in degree from other animals.22</page><page sequence="8">Forum 725 However, the best witness to the blurring of theological and biological concerns is probably Darwin's original bulldog, Thomas Henry Huxley, a trained surgeon and relatively late convert to evolution. Darwin changed Huxley's mind in a way Lamarck and Spencer had not. Huxley's widely translated essays and speeches were largely responsible for modern science's assumption of much of the pastoral and educational authority traditionally held by religion and theology.23 However, what distinguished Huxley most clearly from such latter-day popularizers of evolution as Gould or Richard Dawkins was his interest in focusing the social function of science on counteracting the worst inertial tendencies of evolution. Just as medical science's understanding of the nature of disease is essential to prevention and cure, so too - Huxley held - knowledge of evolutionary biology is needed for drafting effective legislation. The analogy here was meant to be quite exact: Legislation, like medical treatment, is designed to reverse the state of the body (politic). This normatively inspired rejection of evolution led to a famous falling out between Huxley and Spencer that was memorialized in Huxley's 1893 Romanes Lecture, a document that would repay close scrutiny today.24 In sum, it argued that to be human is neither to succumb to evolutionary forces (that is, adaptationism) nor to wish them away (that is, mysticism). Rather, it is to systematically resist evo- lution, mainly through rule of law and application of science. Whereas Huxley's contemporaries puzzled over how humans could strive to do things against their nature, his examples make clear that what he had in mind was more a reorganiza- tion of the social and technical environment in which naturally occurring human behavior would be differentially selected.25 I stress the profoundly antignostic cast of Huxley's approach to Darwinism because of the studied distance that Darwin's more gnostic defenders have kept from Huxley in recent years.26 Unlike Huxley himself, today's gnostic biologists have "prohibited questions" by either discouraging public discussion of Darwinism altogether or restricting such discussion to those with the right credentials - or, in keeping with the naturalistic scruples of its proponents, the right psychological makeup.27 Lessi has certainly identified the symptoms, but the cure may require revisiting the rhetorical practice of Darwin's most sophisticated defender.

Both types of opponents to the university are tackled in Steve Fuller, Knowledge Management Foundations (Woburn Mass.: Butterworth-Heinemann, 2002), esp. chap. 4. 5. Moreover, there are good historical reasons for hoping for such interpénétration. First, both posi- tions have the argument from design for the existence of God as their conceptual template. That is, they presuppose that there is an order to nature that needs to be explained somehow. Second, some leading developments in the neo-Darwinian synthesis have been done by people inspired by fath- oming the divine intellect. The most explicit example may be Theodosius Dobzhansky, The Biology of Ultimate Concern (New York: New American Library, 1967). 6.

It is worth noting that the anthropic principle is taken seriously by the 1979 Nobel Prize winner in physics and self-proclaimed atheist Steven Weinberg. See Weinberg, Facing Up: Science and Its Cultural Adversaries (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2001), esp. 46, 68-59. 14. It is worth noting that both "biology" and "invertebrate" were coined by the first modern exponent of evolution, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, at the dawn of the nineteenth century. Widely misunderstood and derided in his day, Lamarck argued for the continuity of the species so as to justify the devel- opment of lower into higher forms through the hereditary transmission of traits acquired in one's lifetime. 15. Especially after reading Segerstrale's Defenders of the Truth , I am not fully convinced that Wilson counts as a gnostic biologist, since he has been very forthright - in a manner reminiscent of his old Harvard colleague B. F. Skinner - in advancing his controversial views for public discussion. However, a reader of Wilson's Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge (New York: Alfred Knopf, 1998) cannot help but be struck by his demonization of the social sciences.</page><page sequence="10">Forum 727 16. A critical history of social science's roots in theology is John Milbank, Theology and Social Theory (Oxford, UK: Blackwell, 1990). 17. The German debate over the teaching of evolution is recounted in that classic chronicle of "secular humanism," J. M. Robertson, A History of Free-Thought in the Nineteenth Century (London: Watts &amp; Watts, 1929), 327-29. Nowadays Haeckel is best known as the proponent of the developmental law "ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny," which has inspired everything from Nietzsche's "ontology recapitulates philology" (which Heidegger then turned into an exact, if obscure, science) to Piaget's "genetic epistemologa" Gould's most scientifically respected book was on this topic: Ontogeny and Phylogeny (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1977). However, at least until World War II, Haeckel was known as the author of the best-selling The Riddle of the Universe (Die Weltraetsel), first published in 1899 and comparable to Kuhns The Structure of Scientific Revolutions in its impact on the public understanding of science. This book, which inspired the rhetoric of the logical posi- tivists, consisted of showing how a thoroughgoing scientific materialism ("monism") would either resolve or dissolve seven classic metaphysical conundra. For our purposes, this book is interesting in that it strikes an opening gnostic chord by explaining the failure of 19th-century science to bring about a social revolution in terms of a conspiracy of reactionary clerics and lawyers, the remedy for which in the twentieth century will be "free societies of monists," presumably free of any conven- tional political apparatus. 18. The person most closely associated with these views was the co-founder of the German Social Democratic Party, August Bebel. However, Bebel moderated his position after a spell in prison for treason. He then counseled his fellow socialists to work within the parliamentary system, which led the Social Democrats to become the single strongest party by the eve of World War I. However, by that time, the Social Democrats were so integral to the German political establishment that, in evo- lutionary terms, it had become "overadapted" and thus incapable of realizing the Marxist goal of a truly classless society. This failure unleashed another round of gnostic politics by, on the one hand, cynics like Roberto Michels who asserted the eventuality of co-optation, and on the other, revolu- tionaries like Lenin who reasserted the need for violent overthrow. On Bebel's debts to evolution- ary theory, see Robert Richards, Darwin and the Emergence of Evolutionary Theories of Mind and Behavior (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987), 526-28. Interestingly, Bebel's views about the class system as an impediment to evolutionary processes have been recently revived in British sociology, in light of what Conrad Waddington called "epigenetic landscapes" (that is, organized transformations of the physical environment that result in differential patterns of socially relevant traits, such as rates of reproduction and mortality, otherwise known as economic inequality). See Dickens, Social Darwinism, 110-16. Waddington's career would repay sustained study. Professor of animal genetics at Edinburgh University, Waddington was a Marxist who advocated the creation of the "Science Studies Unit" that effectively founded the field by that name. See Steve Fuller, Thomas Kuhn: A Philosophical History for Our Times (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000), 327-31. Shortly before his death in 1975, Waddington penned the enthusiastic review of E. O. Wilson's Sociobiology in the New York Review of Books that triggered a quarter- century backlash from leftist scientists still smarting over the embarrassment of Lysenkoism. 19. This particular slippery slope is discussed in Fuller, Science, 66. Haeckel co-founded the Monist League, whose indifference to party politics eventually made it easy prey to Nazi co-optation, as illustrated in the career of the ethologist Konrad Lorenz. See Richards, Darwin, 532-36. This indif- ference played out differently in the United States, where the Monist League spawned Open Court Press and various "rationalist" magazines of popular philosophy and public affairs, such as Reason and The Skeptic.</page><page sequence="11">728 Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs 20. In the 1860s, Virchow first identified cancer as a significant biomedical research area, in which Germany remained the world leader until the end of World War II. See Robert Proctor, The Nazi War on Cancer (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1999), 18. 2 1 . For the next 50 years this perspective served as a backdrop to eloquent defenses of academic respon- sibility - traveling unfortunately under the name of "value-free inquiry" - by, among others, Ernst Mach and Max Weber, who were also active in the liberal parties of, respectively, Austria and Germany. Accordingly, academics met their social responsibility for training the nation's youth by drawing a publicly clear distinction between theoretical hypotheses and established facts, submit- ting the former to the test of the latter, and encouraging students to draw their own conclusions. Arguably, the long-term failure of academics to agree on just how to draw such a distinction - nowadays dignified as the ineliminably "theory-laden" nature of data and the "underdetermination" of theory choice by data - reflects a lack of a sufficiently common set of interests that would merit guild privileges. Since academics cannot agree on what is theory and what is data, their powers of mutual persuasion yield to any variety of nonacademic sources that draw the distinction for them. A good history of this issue is Robert Proctor, Value-Free Science? (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1991). 22. For a history of anthropomorphism, see Eileen Crist, Images of Animals (Philadelphia, Pa.: Temple University Press, 1999). The turn away from anthropomorphism in animal psychology is usually presented as the prehistory of behaviorism. But behaviorism, understood as a research program for flattening the distinction between the mental powers of humans and nonhumans, was an unin- tended beneficiary. Take Morgan's Canon, which enjoins the research not to postulate higher men- tal powers when lower ones would suffice to explain an animal's behavior. This was designed, not to make humans appear more animal-like, but rather to make it harder to attribute to animals prop- erties that might turn out to be uniquely human. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Morgan was a student of T. H. Huxley, who was also keen on reasserting the uniqueness of the human within the strictures of evolutionary theory. See Richards, Darwin, 375-85. In later life, Morgan turned his pen to phi- losophy, in which he espoused the doctrine of "emergent evolution." 23. This is the light in which Huxley's famous confrontation with Bishop Wilberforce should be seen. Darwinism was originally accepted by broad church Christians but rejected by both high and low churchers who felt their epistemic authority was directly under fire. See Alvar Ellegard, Darwin and the General Reader (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988). It is worth noting that in Britain, the phrase "public understanding of science" continues to have Huxley's proselytizing connotation. Here readers are invited to compare the activities of the American Association for the Advancement of Science with those of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. 24. The controversy caused by this lecture is recounted in Richards, Darwin , 316-19. 25. B. F. Skinner's operant conditioning paradigm of behaviorism is compatible with Huxley's vision, though Huxley would have probably rejected Skinner's reductionist rhetoric as unnecessarily antag- onizing his audience. 26. Two examples stand out: (1) Stephen Jay Gould, Rocks of Ages (New York: Vintage Books, 1999), where Huxley is portrayed as holding Gould's own view that science and religion are separate but equal sources of truth (except for the Romanes Lecture, which is dismissed for contradicting Darwin's own dicta: see 195-96). (2) Philip Kitcher, Science , Truth, and Democracy (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2001), esp. chap. 12, where Huxley is criticized precisely for holding a view close to the one that we attribute to him here. Kitcher is an "epistemic paternalist" who believes that public deliberation of scientific knowledge claims would do more harm than good in the current political climate, given the ignorance and depravity of most people. Indeed, Kitcher even tries (in chap. 8) to dragoon John Stuart Mill into his cause by arguing that Mill would have prohibited, say,</page><page sequence="12">Forum 729 the publication of race-IQ correlations, given its potential for harm. Unfortunately, Kicher misses the point of On Liberty. For Mill, "free speech" is justifiably curtailed only when claims are made about particular people who may then be subject to abuse by others, as in a newspaper's "name and shame" campaign. Science - even as conducted on and about human beings - differs in that its findings are presented in the most general terms (for example, the actual subjects remain anony- mous) and hedged with ceteris paribus clauses that keep the exact policy implications open to fur- ther deliberation. 27. This argumentative turn is criticized in Steve Fuller, "Mortgaging the Farm to Save the Sacred Cow," Studies in History and Philosophy of Science 25 (1994): 251-61. Darwin's philosophically trained defenders are especially prone to ad hominem attacks, for example that Creationists are incapable or duplicitous when it comes to seeking out negative evidence for their views. Interestingly, these charges are never made in relation to Darwinists' own ability or inclination to do the very same thing. From a rhetorical standpoint, this is a strange state of affairs, since attempts to undermine the opponent's integrity are usually linked with attempts to shore up the defendant's.</page></plain_text>
