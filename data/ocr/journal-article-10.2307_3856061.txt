Proceed- ings of a meeting of the Research Seminar in Archaeology and Related Subjects held at the Institute of Archaeology, London University. Duckworth, London, 1969. Pp. xxvi+58i; pls. 8. Price Â£7. 7s. This formidable inter-disciplinary symposium expounds and discusses the problems, conceptual and methodological, of the study of the great adaptive shifts in food production that were seminal in the growth of civilizations. Its scope is very wide. In Part I the environmental background and patterns of exploitation are considered. Part II considers methods of investigation of the domestication of plants and animals from a diversity of genetical, palynological, phylogenetic, archaeological, physical anthropological, ethnographical, and historical standpoints. Part III comprises studies of regional and local evidence for domestication, while Part IV deals with the history of the domestication of particular groups of animals. Part V contains general studies of human nutrition, and the book ends with reflections on the significance of domestication by Professor Piggott. While these papers range over four continents and fifteen millennia and more, the work's central concern is with the origins of agriculture and animal domestication in the Near East. They illustrate how great has been the access of knowledge on these subjects during the past twenty years; but more, they show how vital is the contribution of natural scientific disciplines to their interpretation, and how important are the con- tributions that the archaeologist and historian can make in the provision of evidence of value to scientists. Certain remarkable contributions, in particular those of Harris, Hawkes, Zohary, Darlington, and Flannery, show vividly the need for most of us to revise our assumptions and conceptions of what the 'neolithic revolution' comprised. Indeed, the work presents a special challenge for Egyptologists; for it shows clearly how far studies of early agriculture, domestication of animals, irrigation, and the origins of communal and urban life in Egypt lag behind those in the rest of the Near East. No doubt the physical character of the Nile valley, where basin irrigation has been practised on an annual silt deposit for millennia, poses special practical and methodological problems. But the importance of surveying for and discovering sites, and above all of providing properly stratified and statistically adequate bone, seed, pollen, and dung samples stands out-more especially as the effect on such material remains of the new irrigation regime introduced by the Sudd el-'Ali is uncertain. This, then, is a remarkable work, to which justice cannot be done in a brief notice. There are at least a dozen papers which are directly relevant to ancient Egypt and its Near Eastern neighbours, many of which contain new or uncollected material, and for these alone the book should stand on all Egyptological shelves; but it is best read as a whole, for only thus does one attain a full understanding of this many-sided evolu- tionary and social topic. The editors deserve the greatest credit for the very large administrative effort that the organization of this seminar must have involved, and for their modest, scrupulous, and accurate editing; but even greater thanks for conceiving the idea of this fruitful meeting. The publishers have produced the book most handsomely, and in remarkably quick time, since the seminar was only held in May 1968. H. S.
