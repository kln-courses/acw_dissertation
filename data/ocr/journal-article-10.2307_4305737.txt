<plain_text><page sequence="1">WRITING ABOUT SCIENCE FOR CHILDREN MILLICENT E. SELSAM T O WRITE about science for chil- dren an author needs to know sci- ence, to know children, and to know how to write-particularly to un- derstand how to communicate with children on their level. It is natural for children to be curious and to ask questions. This is also char- acteristic of most scientists at work. They might be said to have maintained a child's curiosity about the world in which they live, and their mode of working is to ask questions, even as children do. The form of questions asked by younger children is most often that of identity-seeking. Children pick up a caterpillar, a beetle, a shell, or the eggs of some sea animal and want to know the name of it. Having found out the name, they lose interest and usually soon forget the name. I have learned through the years not to tell them the name. Now I never know what the ob- ject is, no matter how familiar. I say "let's find out" and look it up with them in a simple guide, hoping to encourage the habit of looking up such things for themselves. As a help to remembering the name, I try to encourage them to do something with the object found. If children's interests are to be maintained and encouraged to develop it should be possible to incorporate these techniques into the writing of books. It was in this way that I was induced to write a book called Terry and the Caterpillars.' I had known all my adult life that caterpillars spin cocoons but I had never seen them actually do it. Op- posite me on the island lived a little girl who kept bringing me caterpillars. We put some huge ones in jars with some twigs and leaves of the plants on which they were found. The following week both of us saw, for the first time in our lives, the spinning of the cocoon. I saw the effect of this simple scientific obser- vation on the child, felt the excitement myself, and realized that here science met child in a way that could produce a good book. But how does the writer communicate the excitement of the discovery? It is not enough to say, "Here is an exciting thing. See the way a caterpillar spins a cocoon." The role of the writer is to write the book so that a child can feel he is participating in an observation or a discovery. It should send him out looking for his own caterpillars imme- diately. A good science book is not just a col- lection of facts. The biology text Life, by George Gaylord Simpson and collabo- rators, asks, "Are you being a scien- tist when you count the sand grains on Coney Island beach? No. It is true you are gathering facts, perhaps carefully, but you are probably crazy."2 Scientists gather facts that are rela- tive to some theory to be tested or ex- tended. They have well-formed ideas of what is worth studying at any given time. All scientific work is thus ap- proached with an hypothesis in mind. The very essence of science is the search for general rules, which when found, are summarized in laws and the- ories. In biology we can think of gen- eralizations such as the cell doctrine, gene theory, the theory of evolution. For example, Darwin's concept of evo- ' Millicent SeIsam, Terry and the Caterpillars (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1962). 2 George Gaylord Simpson, Colin S. Pittendrigh, and Lewis H.

This one concept, by linking many facts, helped to integrate the field of biology. The purpose of science books should not be to fill a child's head with facts but to give him some idea of the great advances in science made by the linking of many observable facts into funda- mental concepts. A good science book leads to an ap- preciation of the methods of science. Scientists find the answers to their questions by observing and experiment- ing. Children are excellent observers, and if they are given a chance to look at things themselves, they will begin to ap- preciate the kind of patience and effort that goes into careful observation. Sci- ence books should encourage this habit of careful observation. A good book on the seashore should move the reader to go out and examine for himself the wonderful life at the edge of the sea. A good astronomy book should turn the reader's eye to the sky and make him want to buy a small telescope. A good nature book should stimulate a young person to hear, see, smell, and taste things-to use all of his senses to ob- serve. Observation of natural facts should lead to an interest in discovering the cause of the processes and activities ob- served. Questions of this kind can best be answered by experiment. The late George Sarton, the famous historian of science, had this to say about develop- ing an appreciation of the scientific method in young people: One may begin [science training] with the purely descriptive parts which require only some power of observation and memory. Thus a good deal of astronomy, geology, anatomy, botany, and zoology, etc. can be explained in a very simple way. The fundamental methods of science can be illustrated by means of easy experiments, and thus will the spirit of experi- mental philosophy gradually inform the minds of the pupils. It is, of course, this that matters above all. It is perfectly possible-and it is not even difficult-to inculcate the scientific spirit . . . upon children in various proportions according to the age and intelligence of each. . e . No attempt should be made to teach too many facts; there is no point in that. One fact well understood, if possible by means of personal experiments, is more than a hundred learned by rote.3 Good science books should certainly avoid incorrect concepts such as teleol- ogy, which explains everything in na- ture in terms of purpose. Statements likes "birds suddenly leave one locality and fly hundreds of miles to another place so that they will have food and a warmer climate in the new location" seem to close off all further inquiry. A great deal of serious scientific study is being devoted to the migration of birds. Experiments have led to theories about the length of day influencing the reproductive organs-and to theories about how the whole process may have originated far back in the sequence of ice-age times when birds were forced to move further south. A scientific presentation of migration gives the facts as known to date from observa- tion and experimentation, gives the best theories available, and shows what areas are still to be explored. It avoids the easy and incorrect use of words like "so that," "nature wants or prefers," etc. Lucretius, the great Roman poet of science of the first century B.C., in his epic poem "On the Nature of Things" had this to say on the subject of teleol- ogy almost two thousand years ago. s George Sarton, The History of Science and the New Humanism (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Uni- versity Press, 1937), pp. 129-30.</page><page sequence="3">98 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY . . . Avoid I beg you, teleology With all my heart I long that you should shun this fault of reasoning. Through prudent fear and foresight in advance This blunder miss: Don't ever think that eyes were made In order that the human race might have the power to see. Ideas like these which men proclaim are false in reasoning, Abysmally confound effect with cause. Nothing at all was brought to be in all our human frame In order that the human race might use it. What is brought to be creates its use. Vision existed not at all Before the light of eyes was brought to be.4 Another common and equally incor- rect concept is anthropomorphism, which sees everything in nature from a human point of view. In an article en- titled "The Evolution of Mind" in the June, 1957, issue of Scientific American, Norman L. Munn tells an ancient Chi- nese story which illustrates the naYve human attitude in this matter. "Chuang Tzu and Hui Tzu were standing on the bridge across the Hao River. Chuang Tzu said, 'Look how the minnows are shooting to and fro! How joyful they are!' 'You are not a fish,' said Hui Tzu, 'How can you know that the fishes are joyful?' 'You are not I,' answered Chuang Tzu, 'How can you know I do not know about the joy of the fishes? ... I know it from my own joy of the water."'5 Mr. Munn then points out that mod- ern psychology does its best to stop this kind of anthropomorphic approach and tries to find out how the animal's mind works by studying its behavior. The study of animal behavior is f as- cinating enough when it is based on the results of observation and experiment in the field and is not beclouded with an approach that ascribes human char- acteristics to animals. The question of accuracy with re- gard to matters of fact in a science book is actually of much less importance than the goals above discussed. On this sub- ject, I want to quote from an article by Eva L. Gordon of Cornell University entitled "Reviewing and Selecting Na- ture Books for Children." She says: Accuracy . . . is not simply a matter of correct factual detail. . . . Accuracy seems a much more complex matter than avoidance of vagueness or misstatement. It implies, for one thing, discrimination between proved or demon- strable truth, and hypothesis. An explanation of the origin of the universe or a description of the habits and appearance of prehistoric animals may be stated not as what we believe to be possible on the basis of evidence we have, but in terms as positive as might be used to tell how one made his garden or to describe the appearance and behavior of a pet cat. Accuracy means also, a willingness to say, "I don't know," and in general, avoidance of sweeping statements and sparing use of such words as "all," "every," and "always." It means, too, careful expression in terms not necessarily technical, but at least not in conflict with scientific language that will come into the child's later experience. . . . Good perform- ance in this matter of careful expression, always practiced by some authors, seems to be shown increasingly in the newer books, sometimes in judicious use of scientific names, and frequently in the use of well-defined, care- fully explained terms instead of awkward, written-down expressions.6 Good science books should commu- nicate some of the excitement of dis- covery-and the triumph that goes with the solution of scientific problems. They should make a young person understand why Archimedes could jump out of his 'Lucretius De rerurm natuirae 823-26, 832-36. Set in English verse by Alban Dewes Winspear (New York: S. A.

Books about science should help young people to see that our human goals must be shaped by science and that science must be enriched by human hopes and ideals. With man's new con- trol of the forces of nature-with atomic power and earth satellites- science books can help to develop the idea that science is not mere knowledge of things independent of our human purposes or merely a means of giving us material comforts and gadgets but is part of the fabric of our lives. The methods of science can be used to create rational attitudes free of superstition and prejudice. Two subjects where non-scientific attitudes are readily observable are evolution and sex. Without evolution there is no science of biology, and yet it is impossible to sell a book about evolution for the elementary grades. Dinosaurs are acceptable. There are plenty of books for younger children on this subject, but a careful examina- tion will reveal how few of them make it understood that the age of the dino- saur was a great reptilian upsurge fol- lowed by an age in which mammals de- veloped and that this process is part of the evolutionary development of all animals. Even in textbooks for the sixth, seventh, and eighth grade, the word "evolution" will not be found, al- though various aspects of the subject may be covered. The new revision of the elementary science studies is mak- ing a great point of this omission of evolution from the curriculum, and new studies will undoubtedly include it. But it is not now possible to sell a trade book on evolution to libraries in the same numbers that you can sell any other science book-even though it may have good or better reviews. There seems to be a wall of prejudice on this subject that is not talked about but which nevertheless operates. I can offer as an example a book I wrote entitled Around the World with Darwin.7 This is a simple account of Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle, but it has had one-third the sale of my other books. The same "wall" operates with books on sex-even in animals, let alone hu- mans. I wrote a book called the Court- ship of A nimals,8 which was well re- viewed, and yet this book is selling less than half as many copies as the other books in the same animal-behavior series. By the time a young person is thirteen or fourteen he can walk into any bookstore and buy a paperback explaining sex from A to Z. But before that time he cannot even learn about courtship and mating in the animal world and see himself in perspective in the world of nature. Squeamishness on the part of parents, teachers, and librarians makes for squeamishness on the part of publishers, and so very few books on evolution and sex are pub- lished. There are many other non-scientific attitudes that abound among us. But these will decline in proportion to the number of good science books read by the new generation. By good science books, to repeat, I mean those that show the methods of science at work, that elucidate basic principles of science and are not a mere assembly of facts, that convey something of the beauty and excitement of science, and that interest young people in thinking up good ques- tions for new young scientists to test by experiment.
