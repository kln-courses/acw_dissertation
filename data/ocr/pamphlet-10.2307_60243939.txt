For aid in the execution of this task, Mr. Spencer acknowledges his indebtedness to Professor Huxley and Dr. Hooker, who not only supplied him with information where his own was deficient, but also looked through the proof-sheets, pointing out errors of detail into which he had fallen; or, as he expresses it in the preface to his second volume, furnished him with valuable criticisms, and took the trouble of check¬ ing the numerous statements of fact on which the argu¬ ments proceed. The candour of Mr. Spencer in this acknowledgment of his dependence upon others for information, and of his indebtedness for correction and criticism, is only equalled by his polemic chivalry in his review of Professor Owen's theory of the vertebrate skeleton. He prefaces his strictures by the following confession :—" We confess that nearly all we know of this department of biology" (the bony structure of the vertebrata), " has been learnt from his lectures and writings. We pretend to no independent investigations, but merely to such knowledge of the phenomena as he has furnished us with. Our position, then, is such that, had Professor Owen simply enunciated his generalisations, we should have accepted them on his authority. But he has brought forward evidence to prove them. By so doing, he has tacitly appealed to the judgment of his readers and hearers —has practically said, ' Here are the facts; do they not warrant these conclusions ?' And all we propose to do, is</page><page sequence="4">4 spencer's biological hypothesis. to consider whether the conclusions are warranted by the facts brought forward." The position here assumed is not only just, but generous. It is just, in that the reviewer judges of Professor Owen's conclusions from the facts adduced in their support; it is generous, in that he holds himself in readiness to accept Professor Owen's generalisations on his own authority, without any proof whatever. It is, of course, to be pre¬ sumed that this profession of generosity is to be accepted with all the abatements demanded by the interests of science. Science cannot afford to be generous, and it is peculiarly unscientific, as it is unphilosophical and unwise, to accept generalisations on the mere authority of any man. The chief object of these references to Mr. Spencer's relation to the facts with which he deals in his work on biology, is to vindicate the class to which he belongs from the charge of presumption, in undertaking to judge of the warrantableness of the conclusions which scientists have deduced from the phenomena of nature. Mr. Spencer con¬ fesses that he is not a scientist in the ordinary acceptation of the term. He is not a chemist; he is not an astronomer; he is not a physiologist; he is not a molecular or atomic physicist; he does not profess to be a geologist or a botanist; but he, nevertheless, claims the right of judging of the con¬ clusions arrived at by the foremost of the practical investi¬ gators in these departments of the wondrous phenomena of nature. If a man come forth out of any of these departments with his conclusions, and refer, in proof of their validity, to facts, Mr. Spencer will meet him with all the courtesy and grace of a knight-errant; but he will give him to understand that he must face him in a logical tournament before he has earned his scientific spurs. He will trust him as a witness of what he has seen with the telescope or miscroscope, or of what has been revealed to him under the torture of the crucible, or the stroke of the hammer, or the all but atom- disclosing radiance of the electric beam ; but as soon as he passes from testimony to inference, he will apply to his conclusions tests furnished, not by the laws of matter, but</page><page sequence="5">THE TERM EVOLUTION EQUIVOCAL. 5 by the laws of mind, to which, by the very fact of his attempt at inference, he has appealed. What Mr. Spencer has done in his review of Professor Owen, theologians claim the right to do in his own case. " All they propose to do is to consider whether his con¬ clusions are warranted by the facts brought forward"— facts, be it observed, which he, like themselves, has merely at second-hand. In estimating his work on biology, they raise no other questions than he himself has raised in his treatment of the works of others. They simply ask what are his conclusions, and what are the facts to which he appeals in support of them In general terms, his conclusions may be characterised by the one word evolution. The term biology means simply the science of life, .and Mr. Spencer's hypothesis, on which he has built up this system of biology developed in these two volumes, is evolutionary. The term evolutionary is here employed advisedly, because of the equivocalness of the term evolution. As evolution simply signifies the process of evoking, or rolling out, something already existing, at least in its elements (which is more than Mr. Spencer admits), it has been employed by parties differing widely both in regard to the agencies and instruments by which the process of evolvement or evocation, has been effected, or conducted. A man who holds that the present order of things—embracing the orderly arrangements of the universe, and the fauna and flora of our earth—has been evoked or evolved from previously created, or previously existing, suitable material, by the skill and power of an infinitely wise and an infinitely powerful Architect, may, nevertheless, be called an evolutionist. Or a man may entertain the crude notions of a Democritus or a Lucretius, recently eulogised before the British Association, and regard the existing order as evolved from atoms equipped with hooks and claws, and be none the less entitled to rank as an evolutionist; or he may differ from Lucretius as much as a modern worker in the domain of molecular physics differs from a man absolutely destitute of the rudest appliance of</page><page sequence="6">6 SPENCER'S BIOLOGICAL HYPOTHESIS. the laboratory, and yet belong to this wide-reaching category. Democritus and Lucretius, Dr. Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck, Mr. Charles Darwin and Professor Huxley, Dr. Tyndall and Mr. Herbert Spencer, theist and atheist, believers in a personal God, and those who, stripping God of the attribute of personality, would identify Him with nature, and deny that He possesses any independent ante- mundane or extramundane life—may all, so far as the signi¬ fication of the term is concerned, be designated evolutionists. In a word, the term is equivocal, and therefore misleading, until it is defined, it may be used to designate a general class, but only where the design is to express the very general notion, that those embraced under the class agree in holding that the present order of things is the outcome, whether by natural or supernatural agency, of previously existing states of matter. As soon as it is proposed to treat of an evolutionary hypothesis, it is demanded alike by per¬ spicuity and honesty, that it be differentiated from others bearing the same general class-name. Mr. Spencer's hypothesis differs from all the evolutionary hypotheses which, as far as I am aware, have hitherto been broached. He is not, it is scarcely necessary to say, a Lucretian, and he is not a Darwinian of the type of Dr. Erasmus Darwin, or Lamarck, or even of Mr. Charles Darwin. He rejects every theory which might militate in any way against the assumption that mind has nothing to do, either directly or indirectly, with the evolutionary process; and therefore he will not admit that there exists in organisms even a primordial impulse impelling them to unfold into more heterogeneous forms. Had he been in the vicinity of Professor Tyndall on the occasion of his recent Manchester recantation, when he admitted that "every¬ where throughout our planet we notice this tendency of the ultimate particles of matter to run into symmetric forms," and affirmed that " the very molecules seem instinct with a desire for union and growth," he would have warned him that he was treading on the margin of very dangerous con¬ cessions, and would have informed him that, not " tendency</page><page sequence="7">SPENCER'S HYPOTHESIS PURELY MECHANICAL. 7 to unfold," but " liability to be unfolded," * is the present position of the advanced thinkers of the evolutionary school. Nor is he satisfied even with this safeguard against the intrusion of mind. He is careful to add, as a qualifying clause, that even this " liability to be unfolded" arises from the actions and reactions of organisms and their fluctuating environments." His hypothesis may be termed the mechanical-genesis hypothesis. Adaptation becomes, in his hands, "direct equilibration;" and Mr. Darwin's "natural selection" is translated into "indirect equilibration." But whilst he criticises, or rejects, or modifies, all previous scientific hypotheses, the chief design of his work is to overthrow the Scripture doctrine of special creations. Singling out this doctrine, which he entitles a hypothesis, he says—" Either the multitudinous kinds of organisms that now exist, and the still more multitudinous kinds that have existed during past geologic eras, have been from time to time separately made ; or they have arisen by insensible steps, through actions such as we see habitually going on. Both hypotheses," he adds, " imply a cause. The last, certainly as much as the first, recognises this cause as inscrutable. The point at issue," he alleges, " is how this inscrutable cause has worked in the production of living forms. This point, if it is to be decided at all, is to be decided only by the examination of evidence. Let us inquire which of these antagonistic hypotheses is most con¬ gruous with established facts." -f- It will be seen from this statement that Mr. Spencer admits a cause, but holds this cause to be inscrutable. In this he claims agreement with what he is pleased to designate the creation hypothesis, which he rejects. Now this is not a fair account of the views of his opponents in regard to the ultimate cause. Creationists do not regard the ultimate cause as inscrutable. They do hold that the ultimate cause cannot be known to perfection ; but this is a very different thing from holding that they know nothing whatever about that cause. * " Principles of Biology," Vol. I., pp. 430-1. t Ibid, Vol. I., pp. 331-2.</page><page sequence="8">8 spencer's biological hypothesis. The point here raised is in fact the chief point at issue, Mr. Spencer alleges that the ultimate cause is inscrutable ; and here the issue is joined. We do not admit the right of any man to refer phenomena to a cause which is inscrutable ; for the very obvious reason, that before the reference is thought of, he must observe something in the phenomena warranting and suggesting the reference. No such reference is ever made by any intelligent being, except on the obser¬ vance of qualities or actions in the phenomena which can, in his estimation, be accounted for only on the assumption that a cause possessing certain attributes has produced them. This is, of course, all one with saying that before he makes the reference he has some conception of the cause to which he makes it. Mr. Spencer regards the unthink- ableness of the creation hypothesis a sufficient reason for rejecting it. This hypothesis, he remarks, "implies the establishment of a relation in thought between nothing and something—a relation of which one term is absent —an impossible relation."* Now if it be impossible to esta¬ blish a relation in thought between nothing and some¬ thing, or to establish a relation where one term of the relation is wanting, how are we to establish a relation between the phenomena of the universe and an alleged inscrutable cause An inscrutable cause is an unknown cause, and with an unknown thing no relation can be imagined. The term of the relation represented by the unknown cause, is a term which cannot be present to- thought, and must, therefore, be regarded as not furnishing the additional element of the relation, which, according to Mr. Spencer, is indispensable " to the framing of coherent thought." Judged, therefore, by his own crucial test of all truth, and his own postulated condition of all thinking, this position is indefensible. It is not only unphilosophical to ascribe phenomena to an inscrutable cause, but the ascrip¬ tion is absolutely unthinkable. Let any man make the experiment, and he will soon be convinced that the thing adventured is impossible even in imagination. Of an inscrut- * " Principles of Biology," Vol. I., p. 336.</page><page sequence="9">his ultimate unknowable, yet manifested! 9 able thing, nothing can be affirmed save that it is inscrut¬ able, and to it nothing implying knowledge of it can be ascribed or referred ; and of all the imaginable predicates, the predicate proposed by the evolutionists is at the farthest remove from admissibility. The predicate embraces the entire phenomena of the entire universe, including the evolutionist himself; whilst the something of which all these are predicated is, in his own view of it (if view of the inscrutable be possible), absolutely unknowable and un¬ known It is well that the laws of thought will not permit even the ablest philosopher to conduct with impunity a process of thinking involving an absolute absurdity. Of the truth of this maxim, Mr. Spencer's writings furnish abundant illustrations; and of these, one of the most notable is his account of the manifestation of this same inscrutable cause. In his " First Principles," * he informs us that " matter and motion, as we know them, are differently conditioned manifestations of force;" and, in the very same breath, he affirms that this same force, of which matter and motion are the manifestations, "must forever remain unknown"! It would seem impossible to write down two sentences more palpably at variance than these. First, we are told that force manifests itself under the conditions furnished by matter and motion; and then we are told that these "differently conditioned manifestations" of it give us no information whatever of what force is! That is, force manifests itself, and yet does not make itself manifest! When a man can believe that a thing can be, and at the same time not be, he may be able to believe that a thing can manifest itself, and yet impart no information respecting itself. On the relation of matter to force, Mr. Spencer is exceedingly unphilosophical. He regards matter as simply a condition of the manifestation of force. This is exactly the reverse of the actual relation, and involves the subordi¬ nation of a substance to its own qualities. Matter sustains * " First Principles," p. 169.</page><page sequence="10">10 spencer's biological hypothesis. to force no such relationship. Of the force referred to, matter is the source; and were there no matter in existence, there would not only be no manifestation of this, force, but there would be no such force to be manifested. The force in question is not an entity existing outside and independent of matter, availing itself of matter as a medium of manifesta¬ tion ; it is itself the offspring of the qualities of matter, and through it matter reveals itself. The fact is, Mr. Spencer's notion of the relation in question would reduce matter to the rank of an occasional cause, and, stripping it of all claim to causal efficiency, would make the elements of which it consists a source of perpetual delusion. It is not only the common conviction of mankind, but it is the conviction of those who have investigated most thoroughly the domain of molecular physics, that matter is the possessor, and not the mere revealer of force. It is unnecessary formally to establish this position. The physical sciences are founded upon it. The astronomer, and the molecular physicist, alike proceed upon the assump¬ tion that the forces with which they are dealing, are not extra-material entities, but qualities or attributes inherent in matter itself. This fact is fatal to the claims put forth in behalf of Mr. Spencer's "ultimate of ultimates," as it reduces it to the category of a mere quality of matter. A mere quality can never take the rank of an ultimate cause. An ultimate cause, and especially the ultimate of ultimates, must exist prior to, and independent of, all things except itself, and must account for their existence. This a mere quality cannot do. As it implies, from its very nature, the existence of a substance in which it inheres, and without which it can have no being, it is manifest that it cannot be regarded as antecedent to that substance, or independent of it. As all this is true of force in its relations to matter, it follows, of necessity, that force cannot be regarded as the ultimate cause from which this stupendous universe, with its fauna and flora, has come forth. But even though it were conceded that there is outside and independent of matter, a distinct entity called force,</page><page sequence="11">HIS ULTIMATE REDUCED TO "PUSH" AND "PULL." 11 it is difficult to see how this concession would aid the cause of the Spencerian evolutionist; for either this entity is possessed of intelligence, or it is not If it be intelligent, and display that intelligence in the determi¬ nation of ends to be wrought out, and the adaptation of means for working out the ends determined, it must be possessed of all the essential attributes of personality— must be capable of purpose and contrivance—must, in fact, possess reason and will, as well as power. In a word, it must be the very entity for whose existence theologians contend—it must be God. If, however, it do not possess intelligence and will, it is, ipso facto, disqualified for the exercise of the imperial prerogatives assigned to it by the evolutionists. Stripped of all ambiguity, what is this entity As described by men of science, its functions are expressed by the two terms, attraction and repulsion, or, to use the popular language of Dr. Tyndall, by the terms "push" and " pull." Will any man, who has any regard for his reputa¬ tion, venture to say that all the phenomena of the universe are the offspring of "push" and "pull"? Does anyone imagine that any amount of pushing and pulling would ever originate matter Does any evolutionist believe that, by pushing and pulling, matter absolutely neutral, if there could be such a substance, could be invested with diverse attributes ; or that one kind of matter could be differentiated into the distinct elements which actually exist Or, to go farther back, can any intelligent being believe that, prior to the existence of any substance, whether material or spiritual, there could be any such actions as are expressed by "push" and "pull"? He who speaks of "push" and "pull" as ultimate, simply uses language without import. The idea attempted defies thought. Let Mr. Spencer test it by his own crucial test of all truth—let him try a mental presen¬ tation of "push" and "pull" where there is nothing to push or pull, and nothing to be pushed or pulled, and he will find that the elements necessary to coherent thought are wanting. Common sense repudiates the Spencerian ultimate as</page><page sequence="12">12 SPENCER'S BIOLOGICAL HYPOTHESIS. absolutely unthinkable. If, as all admit, out of nothing nothing comes, there can be no "push" or "pull" apart from an antecedent pusher or puller. Nor is this all; for this same principle of causality demands the existence of suitable materials to be pushed and pulled. To take an example from magnetic pushing and pulling; "push" and "pull," intelligently regulated, will account for the syste¬ matic grouping of iron filings around the poles of a magnet; but if one substitute for the magnet, a piece of lead, or for the iron filings, a number of marbles, he will find that there will be neither pushing nor pulling, and that the systematic grouping which elicited his admiration in the former case is altogether wanting in the latter. And as it is with proximate, so it is with more remote effects. The "push" and "pull" incident to gravitation will account for the movement of our earth around the sun, and for the modifi¬ cations of its orbit, which extend over cycles embracing, perhaps, more than a million of years ; but let there be a globe of iron, or even of carbon, or of any other single element of matter, hung in the place of our wondrously con¬ stituted orb, and "push" and "pull" may put forth upon it all their might through all the a^ons of the coming eternity, without originating a single form of animal or vegetable life, much less an organism possessing conscious intellect and will. In a word, the evolution hypothesis advocated by Mr. Spencer breaks down at the very outset. It is only by veiling itself in a haze of so-called first principles, which seem plausible in the abstract, that it can for a moment impose upon any intelligent being. Its ultimate cause, which it dignifies with the superb title of " the ultimate of ultimates," on which it hangs the mighty burden of the entire universe, is absolutely unthinkable, except as a quality or attribute of those substances for whose existence and phenomena it undertakes to account. In other words, the only conditions under which force is thinkable as having existence at all, are such as to render it simply preposterous to assign to it the position of</page><page sequence="13">A QUALITY CANNOT BE ULTIMATE. 13 the ultimate cause. If there can be no force apart from a substance, material or immaterial; and if the qualities or attributes of a substance cannot be the cause of the sub¬ stance in which they inhere, it must follow that force, which is itself but a quality, cannot be the ultimate cause of all substances and of all phenomena. However limited our knowledge of the ultimate cause may be, we know of a certainty that it cannot be the mere quality of something else. That which is subordinate and dependent cannot be ultimate. Wrong in his conception of the ultimate cause, Mr. Spencer is also in error as to the ultimate question at issue respecting its operation. The question is not, as stated by him, " how has it worked ?" but the far easier one, " has it worked with design ?" These are very different questions, presenting widely different problems. It is one thing to en¬ quire how the operations of nature are carried on, and another to enquire whether they are so carried on as to indicate a design. So diverse are these enquiries, that the one may be successfully prosecuted where the other transcends finite capacity. A passage which I take the liberty of quoting from a sermon by Professor Huxley, on " The Origin of Species," will enable us to judge of the warrantableness of the distinction referred to, and of the comparative feasibility of the two lines of investigation. " The student of nature," says this eminent physiologist, " wonders the more, and is astonished the less, the more conversant he becomes with her operations ; but of all the perennial miracles she offers to his inspection, perhaps the most worthy of admiration is the development of a plant or of an animal from its embryo. Examine the recently-laid egg of some common animal, such as a salamander or a newt. It is a minute spheroid, in which the best microscope will reveal nothing but a structureless sac, enclosing a glairy fluid, holding granules in suspension. But strange possibilities lie dormant in that semi-fluid globule. Let a moderate supply of warmth reach its watery cradle, and the plastic matter undergoes changes so rapid, and yet so steady and purpose-like in their sue-</page><page sequence="14">14 SPENCER'S BIOLOGICAL HYPOTHESIS. cession, that one can only compare them to those operated by a skilled modeller upon a formless lump of clay. As with an invisible trowel, the mass is divided and sub-divided into smaller and smaller portions, until it is reduced to an aggregation of granules not too large to build withal the finest fabrics of the nascent organism. And then, it is as if a delicate finger traced out the line to be occupied by the spinal column, and moulded the contour of the body; pinching up the head at the one end and the tail at the other, and fashioning flank and limb into due salamandrine proportions in so artistic a way, that, after watching the process hour by hour, one is almost involuntarily possessed by the notion that some more subtle aid to vision than an achromatic would show the hidden artist, with his plan before him, striving with skilful manipulation to perfect his work." * Now if we are to trust the testimony of Professor Huxley, who has watched with an achromatic the very process about which the enquiry is raised, our verdict must be given against Mr. Spencer's statement of the question at issue in this controversy. According to Professor Huxley, the question raised by Mr. Spencer cannot be answered. The how of the operation by which that semi-fluid globule is transformed into the resultant organism, is the very point on which physiological research has thus far shed no light. But whilst science cannot answer Mr. Spencer's question, it can answer the one raised by creationists. While it cannot detect the artist in the act of moulding the plastic material into the nascent organism, it declares that the changes which take place are "so steady and purpose-like in their succession," that " one is involuntarily possessed by the notion" that if he had keener vision he would see the artist at work. In a word, the facts of embryology, as testified to by Professor Huxley, on whose testimony Mr. Spencer acknowledges he has to depend, reveal a process of modelling in harmony with a plan. The how of the process is not revealed—the trowel, and the hand that wields it so * " Lay Sermons," &amp;c, pp. 260, 261.</page><page sequence="15">THE ULTIMATE CAUSE WORKS WITH DESIGN. 15 dexterously, elude all scrutiny—but voluntarily, or involun¬ tarily, the observer becomes possessed of the notion or the conviction that the mystic process is carried forward under the guidance of a designing mind. Whether, then, we enquire into Mr. Spencer's doctrine of the unknowableness of the ultimate cause, or into his posi¬ tion in regard to the question respecting its operation, we find his views to be indefensible. In the one case he is at war with philosophy, and in the other, with the inevitable convictions generated by a careful observation of the chief phenomena in question. Science proves that, behind matter and its qualities, there is a cause which works with design. Reserving for a future lecture the specific arguments by which Mr. Spencer endeavours to sustain his hypothesis, it is proposed, at present, simply to examine his reasons for rejecting the doctrine of special creation. His first reason is that there is a presumption against it because of its association with primitive beliefs. " The pri¬ mitive beliefs of the race respecting the structure of the heavens were wrong; and the notions which replaced them were successively less wrong. The original belief respect¬ ing the form of the earth was wrong; and this wrong belief survived the first civilisations. The earliest ideas that have come down to us concerning the natures of the elements were wrong; and only in quite recent times has the composition of matter in its various forms been better understood. The interpretations of mechanical facts, of meteorological facts, of physiological facts, were at first wrong. In all these cases men set out with beliefs which, if not absolutely false, contained but small amounts of truth disguised by immense amounts of error. Hence," Mr. Spencer concludes, " the hypothesis that living beings resulted from special creations, being a primitive hypothesis, is probably an untrue hypo¬ thesis. If the interpretations of nature given by aboriginal men were erroneous in other directions, they were most likely erroneous in this direction. It would be strange if, while these aboriginal men failed to reach the truth in so</page><page sequence="16">16 SPENCER'S BIOLOGICAL HYPOTHESIS. many cases where it is comparatively conspicuous, they yet reached it where it is comparatively hidden." Mr. Spencer tries to strengthen this argumentum ad invidiam by classing this primitive belief with the abandoned conceptions of fetichism and polytheism, and the various anthropomorphic conceptions of the unknown cause, which he alleges are " everywhere fading away." If all the other parts of the story put into our minds in childhood have long since been rejected, this remaining part of it, he expects, will ere long be relinquished also.* On this argument, or rather attempt to create prejudice against the doctrine attacked, it may be remarked— I. The principle on which this objection to the doctrine of creation is founded, is strangely out of harmony with the position assumed by Mr. Spencer, in his " First Princi¬ ples," in regard to ancient and widely-prevalent beliefs. In his " Principles of Biology," he assumes that the proba¬ bility is against the truth of a primitive hypothesis, whilst in his " First Principles" he takes the ground, that the pro¬ babilities are always in favour of " beliefs which have long existed and are widely diffused." \ Now, if there be, in the wide range of human beliefs, one of which it can be said that it has existed long, and is widely diffused, it is that belief against which Mr. Spencer here urges the invidious argument of an a priori improbability. The belief in question is as old, and as widely spread, as the human race. There is no well-authenticated instance of any section or tribe of our species, which has not possessed the conviction that the universe, together with its living organisms, is the workmanship of an Almighty Creator. If this be an un¬ questionable fact, does it not follow, on Mr. Spencer's own showing, in his " First Principles," that there exists a very strong probability in favour of the truth of the new belief which he here antagonises on the assumption that the prob¬ abilities are against it If his own principles are to be carried out in estimating this ancient, universal belief, there will be found, as the residuum, the primary, ineffaceable * " First Principles," pp. 333-6. f Ibid, pp. 3, 4.</page><page sequence="17">BEGS THE QUESTION. 17 truth, that whatever exhibits marks of design must have had an intelligent author. When all the superstitions and crude notions wherewith the belief in creation has been associated, have been dissipated, this conviction abides. Constituted as the human mind is, it cannot ignore the evidence of the operation of mind presented in the universe, and must reject, as unphilosophical, any system of biology which dispenses with intelligence in the structure of earth's fauna and flora. 2. That it assumes that man's primitive estate was that of a savage. As this assumption is contrary to historical facts, and has nothing to rest upon save a few remains of pre¬ historic man, which admit of interpretations differing widely from that put upon them by scientists of the school of Mr. Spencer, he need not be surprised if this, his primary assumption, be rejected as a mere begging of the question. 3. That it assumes that all the tribes of the human race, existing throughout the earth at the time the remains in question were deposited, were in the estate indicated by the remains. Granting that the remains prove the savage estate of the individual and of the tribe to which he belonged, does it follow that other tribes, inhabiting other and more congenial regions of the earth, were in the same estate Men of science have need to be reminded of what the doctrine of Scripture on this point is. Scripture does not teach that the human race retained its moral integrity, or that each of the families into which it was divided retained the know¬ ledge possessed by the common ancestor. On the contrary, it tells a sad story of apostasy, dispersion, and degradation —a degradation retarded by special Divine interposition in the case of some, but allowed to go on in the case of others. If the morally degraded wandered away from the primitive seat of the race, and descended lower and lower in the scale the farther they receded from the parent stock and penetrated into uncongenial environments, might it not be expected that their remains would testify, as the remains in question do, to a low estate of civilisation But what is there in all this to warrant the sweeping generalisation</page><page sequence="18">18 SPENCER'S BIOLOGICAL HYPOTHESIS. assumed by Mr. Spencer as a premiss from which to argue Do these instances, exhumed from European caves, warrant the conclusion, that the tribes resident in the Asiatic fontal centre, were, at the time indicated, in the same estate of social degradation Never was there a more unwarrant¬ able inference; and yet it is assumed by some of the most eminent scientists of the day as absolutely unchallengeable 4. In the next place it may be remarked, that the belief in the doctrine of a special creation can be proved, and has been proved historically, as well as by internal evidence, to have been handed down to us, not by savages, but by men whose writings demonstrate that they have no mental or moral superiors in the school of Mr. Spencer. On the score of its credibility, as well as of its harmony with scientific facts, we can afford to compare the cosmogony of Moses, or David, or Isaiah, or Paul, or Peter, with the biology of Herbert Spencer any day, notwithstanding all the advan¬ tage he has derived from the writings of Tyndall and Huxley, or the prelections of Professor Owen. 5. However little store Mr. Spencer may set by primitive beliefs, if primitive man had not been possessed of some, he would never have ascribed the phenomena of his environ¬ ment to any cause whatever. And if we are to speak of the necessity of some of these beliefs as compared with others, we would specify one which is subversive of that form of the evolution hypothesis which he has set forth in his biology. The belief referred to is the intuitive, innate con¬ viction, that a phenomenon implies the existence and operation of a cause. This primary belief is universal, and involves the principle that the phenomenon reveals the attributes of the cause concerned in its production. It is, therefore, irreconcilable with the position, which is really the ultimate one of Mr. Spencer's biology—viz., that the ultimate cause is inscrutable. Either the principle which ascribes inscrutability to a cause is universal, or it is not. If it be universal, it must apply to immediate and proximate causes as well as to ultimate; and if so, the immediate cause, to which we instinctively refer the phenomenon, is to</page><page sequence="19">BELONGS TO AN EXTINCT FAMILY OF BELIEFS. 19 us, at the time of the reference, inscrutable and therefore unknown ; in which case the reference is as unintelligent as it is unwarrantable. If it be alleged that it is not universal, but true only of the ultimate cause, the question arises, on what authority is this limitation of the dark attribute of inscrutability to the case of the ultimate cause made As already shown, there can be no reason for regarding the thing pronounced inscrutable a cause at all, which is not equally valid for denying its inscrutability. This belief is as old as humanity, and as wide as the human race; and it is fatal, not only to the specific argument which Mr. Spencer has tried to draw from the other alleged primitive beliefs with which the belief in the doctrine of a special creation is found to be associated, but fatal to the funda¬ mental principle of his whole system, which postulates the inscrutability of the ultimate cause. 6. Moreover, it were very easy for the advocates of the doctrine of special creation to retort this argumentum ad invidiam. Evolutionists should be the last to reproach their opponents with holding opinions " belonging to an almost extinct family of beliefs." It is not so long ago since we were told, on the high authority of the president of the British Association, that the evolution hypothesis was as old as the Greek philosophy. Now, however, if we are to credit Mr. Spencer, " it is a conception born in times of comparative enlightenment." We are quite ready to compare the enlightenment of the age of Moses with that of the age of Democritus, or to compare the prophets of Israel with the sages of Greece. And if we were to pass in review the various evolution hypotheses from the time of the Greek evolutionists to Mr. Spencer, we might be able to show that the one advocated by him belongs to a very large family of not only almost, but altogether, extinct' hypotheses. Where now is the hypothesis of Thales, who held that water is the original of all things, and that God is the intelligence who from water formed all beings or the hypothesis of Anaximander, who substituted an abso¬ lutely indeterminate thing called infinity for the elementary</page><page sequence="20">20 SPENCER S BIOLOGICAL HYPOTHESIS. water of Thales or the hypothesis of Anaximines, who traced all things to air or that of Anaxagoras, who referred all things to a number of primitive elements called by him homceomeriae Where now is the hypothesis of Pytha¬ goras, who deduced all things from a monad, embracing in its constitution both matter and spirit fused together into an absolute unity of substance or the same hypothesis as more fully developed into hylozoism by his followers What scientist would now accept, unmodified, the atomic theory of Democritus, who represented all things as pro¬ ceeding from eternal atoms possessing the same qualities and specific gravity, and differing only in size; and that their general compounds, such as lead and iron, differ from each other merely in the arrangement of their atoms It is questionable whether even Professor Tyndall or Mr. Spencer would embark in the business of world-building with a stock of such atoms, however diverse in size, or how¬ ever unlimited in number. With atoms whose qualities are generated by their own movements, and whose movements are not the offspring of their previously existing qualities, it is more than probable that even our modern atomic chiefs might fail to construct even our inorganic world. And as to their entering upon the task with such material as water, or air, or the primitive elements of Anaximines, or the monad of Pythagoras, of course this were out of the question altogether. This brief review of some of the evolutionary hypotheses is sufficient to prove that, however it may be with others, evolutionists should be the last to speak of the presumption which exists against an opinion found associated with " an almost extinct family of beliefs." If Mr. Spencer's hypo¬ thesis is to be judged upon this principle, it must be con¬ demned ; for it is associated with a class of speculations which no scientist, except for the purpose of producing a temporary sensation, would entertain or endorse for a moment. Equally liable to retort is our author's next reason for rejecting the doctrine of a special creation. He alleges</page><page sequence="21">OPPOSED TO FACTS. 21 that it is not countenanced by a single fact. " No one," he says, " ever saw a special creation." " No one," he adds, " ever found proof, of an indirect kind, that a special creation had taken place." Quoting a remark of Dr. Hooker's, he continues, " Naturalists who suppose new species to be miraculously originated, habitually suppose the origination to occur in some region remote from human observation. Wherever the order of organic nature is exposed to the view of zoologists and botanists, it expels this conception ; and the conception survives only in connection with ima¬ gined places, where the order of organic phenomena is unknown."* Here is an appeal to facts, and we accept the authority invoked. It is a fact that no one ever saw a new species of organism created ; but it is also a fact that no one ever saw one brought into existence by a process of evolution; and it is a fact that no one ever found proof, of an indirect kind, that such an evolution of new species had taken place. Wherever the order of organic nature is exposed to the view of zoologists and botanists, as in the case already quoted from Professor Huxley's sermon on the origin of species, it expels the Spencerian conception of evolution without the intervention of intelligence, and supplants it by the irresistible conviction that the process of organisation is under the guidance of a skilful artist; and the conception for which the authority of facts is claimed by Mr. Spencer survives only in connection with flights of the so-called scientific imagination, by which the vision is prolonged backwards beyond the boundary of experimental evidence. There is not a single fact presented in these two volumes which gives the slightest countenance to the hypothesis which its author advocates; nor is there one which, when fully analysed, does not add strength to the argu¬ ment in support of a presiding intelligence and a special creation. After the author had reached the 351st page of his first volume, he felt constrained to make the following confes- * " Principles of Biology," Vol. 1., p. 336.</page><page sequence="22">22 SPENCER'S BIOLOGICAL HYPOTHESIS. sion :—" Though the facts at present assignable in direct proof that, by progressive modifications, races of organisms that are apparently distinct may result from antecedent races are not sufficient, yet there are numerous facts of the order required." Is this not a distinct and explicit acknow¬ ledgment that no one has ever seen the evolution of a new species If he regards this fact as furnishing an argument against special creation, how can he refuse to admit its force as against his own evolution hypothesis But if he has not direct proof sufficient for the establishing of this hypothesis, he has, he informs us, " numerous facts of the order required." What are these facts Here they are :—" It has been shown beyond all question, that unlike- nesses of structure gradually arise among descendants from the same stock. We find that there is going on a modi¬ fying process of the kind alleged as the source of specific differences—a process which, though slow in its action, does, in time, produce conspicuous changes—a process which, to all appearance, would produce in millions of years, and under the great varieties of conditions which geological records imply, any amount of change."* And yet he con¬ fesses that the palaeontology of these records cannot be held to prove evolution, and that only some few of them yield it support! -f- Such, then, are the facts ; what is their value in this argument It will be observed that while Mr. Spencer speaks of the gradual rise of unlikenesses of structure among descendants from the same stock, he has not .ventured to say that these have, in any instance, amounted to the origination of a new species, and that he confesses that palaeontology does not furnish a single instance. All he says is, that this fact is of the order required! His hypothesis requires structural change, and here is a fact of this class. It is true the change to which it testifies is not great enough for his purpose ; but it " bears as great a ratio to the brief period in which it has been produced," as the whole change required "bears to * " Principles of Biology," Vol I., p. 351. f Ibid, p. 399.</page><page sequence="23">CHANGES REQUIRED DO NOT EXIST. 23 that vast period during which living forms have existed on the earth." This is very like a confession which Mr. Darwin makes at the close of his remarks on the effects of increased or decreased use of parts. "Although man," he concludes, " may not have been much modified during the latter stages of his existence through the increased or decreased use of parts, the facts now given show that his liability in this respect has not been lost; and we positively know that the same law holds good with the lower animals." Such is his confession ; what is his conclusion With an inferential boldness that brooks no barrier, he adds:— " Consequently we may infer, that when, at a remote epoch, the progenitors of man were in a transitional state, and were changing from quadrupeds into bipeds, natural selection would probably have been greatly aided by the inherited effects of the increased or dim¬ inished use of the different parts of the body"!* It is truly painful to observe in the writings of these really able men, so persistent an endeavour to establish their favourite hypotheses by facts which they are compelled to admit do not furnish the evidence required. Frustrated by the facts, not only of historic and prehistoric times, but of palaeontology also, they overleap the boundary of experi¬ mental evidence, and assume transitions and structural changes which they have failed to prove. When the facts adduced, even as estimated by themselves, do not give the slightest indication of a specific change, they comfort them¬ selves with the reflection that changes of the class observed must, if continued long enough, effect the change required! Of course, a change of the right kind, however small in amount, if increased by however small an increment, must, if unchecked, at some future epoch of duration, amount to the quantum required ; but only if unchecked. Ay, there's the rub—only on the assumption that the change shall be unchecked! What warrant is there for this assumption Certainly there is none in the phenomena of the observed changes of the cosmos. * " Descent of Man," Vol. I., p. 121.</page><page sequence="24">24 SPENCER'S BIOLOGICAL HYPOTHESIS. Speaking of the external factors of evolution, Mr. Spencer refers to the fact, that our earth, in its annual motion round the sun, does not move constantly along a rigid, unvarying curve, but along a curve constant in its inconstancy—now approaching a circle, and anon an ellipse. This change is a very slow one, and the cycle which embraces its extremes has the astounding range of one or two millions of years. Now suppose that an astronomer, who was not aware of the demonstrations of La Place, were watching the movements of our globe referred to, and observed that, in a given period, the divergence towards a more eccentric curve amounted to several miles, might he not, if he reasoned with Mr. Spencer and the evolutionists, begin to apprehend an elongation of the major axis of its orbit, and a shortening of the minor, which must eventually evolve extremes of heat and cold absolutely destructive of organic life in our world As an evolutionist, he might thus reason ; but the scientific astronomer would inform him that his fears were groundless, and had their origin in a too narrow induction. He would allay his alarm by assuring him that this variation in the orbit of the earth has its limits, and that when these were reached, the apparently errant orb would swing gra¬ dually back to the less hazardous curve. Now we charge upon the evolutionists the perpetration of a like error, in their argument from the observed structural changes which have been induced, or developed, in vegetable and animal organisms. The organic variation has been shown, again and again, to have bounds set to it which it cannot pass. Even Mr. Darwin, as quoted by Mr. Spencer, remarks that "'sports' are extremely rare under nature, but far from rare under cultivation." And Mr. Spencer himself admits* that competent judges do not doubt that our extremely variable domestic animals have become variable under the changed conditions im¬ plied in domestication, and holds that these animals were constant prior to their subjection to man. Is this not a palpable surrender of the very citadel of evolution It * " Principles of Biology," Vol. I., p. 262.</page><page sequence="25">VARIATION ESSENTIAL TO SPECIFIC LIFE. 25 is neither more nor less than an acknowledgment that constancy is the rule, whilst variation is the exception; or, as Mr. Spencer puts it, "the wild race maintains its type with great persistence," whilst " the domestic race frequently produces individuals more unlike the average type than the parents are." * " The life of a species, like that of an individual," he says, "is maintained by the unequal and ever-varying actions of incident forces on its different parts." 7 This is conclusive, but it is conclusive against the evolu¬ tion hypothesis. If, as Mr. Spencer has shown, variation is essential to specific life, what becomes of the notion, that by the operation of this same law of variation, new species can be originated Can the causes which are held to be capable of transmuting one species into another, be held capable of rendering such transmutation impossible If uni¬ formity, as " inter-breeding" demonstrates, produces specific deterioration, whilst variation, as those skilled in cattle- breeding inform us, promotes the well-being, and tends to the perfection of the species, surely it is most unwarrantable to infer, that variation may eventually result in specific destruction by improving one species into another. It is no wonder, then, that these two classes of related facts led Mr. Spencer to enunciate the foregoing remarkable law of specific life. The law, as we have seen, is universal, extend¬ ing to the very orbs of heaven. The stability of the universe, as well as the stability of the species of earth's fauna and flora, is maintained by variations which are limited and bounded by an unseen power which ever acts in reference to the original type, and maintains its image, substantially, in every individual movement or organism, through the instrumentality of the very forces which evolu¬ tionists regard as all-potent to effect its destruction. The case of a particular family, in which digital variation occurred, adduced in support of the evolution hypothesis, \ will serve to illustrate this point. The case is * " Principles of Biology," Vol. I., p. 261. f Ibid, p. 286. % Ibid, pp. 258-60.</page><page sequence="26">26 SPENCER'S BIOLOGICAL HYPOTHESIS. cited from an essay by Dr. Struthers, and the conclusion drawn is quoted with approval by Mr. Spencer. After stating the history of the variation through four genera¬ tions, Dr. Struthers, referring to a daughter who was born with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, says, " In this, the most interesting sub-branch of the descent, we see digital increase, which appeared in the first generation on one limb, appearing in the second on two limbs, the hands ; in the third on three limbs, the hands and one foot; in the fourth on all the four limbs. There is as yet no fifth generation in uninterrupted transmission of the variety. The variety does not yet occur in any number of the fifth generation of Esther's descendants" (the female ancestor to whom the variety is traced back), " which con¬ sists as yet only of three boys and one girl, whose parents were normal, and of two boys and two girls, whose grand¬ parents were normal. It is not known whether, in the case of the great-grandmother, Esther P the variety was original or inherited." Such is the case ; what conclusion does it warrant? Does it prove that variation may go on indefinitely or does it prove that it is held in check by a specific law restraining it, like the motions of the planets, within unalterable limits The case proves that the normal type rules; for in the generations specified, only six instances of variation occur, whilst there are one hundred and two of the normal type If Mr. Spencer can adduce nothing in favour of his hypo¬ thesis better than a woman who has acquired, through the mystic process of evolution, three digits more than her great-grandmother, he had better be a little more modest in his averments about the absence of evidence in support of the doctrine of a special creation. It would, indeed, seem as if he felt the weakness and unprofitableness of this argu¬ ment ; for he immediately tries to buttress it with an a priori borrowed from his " First Principles," to the effect, that an idea which cannot be presented to the mind in a definite shape or form, is a false idea, and is to be rejected. In addition to what has been said on the point here raised,</page><page sequence="27">SPENCER ABANDONS HIS CRUCIAL TEST. 27 when speaking of the impossibility of regarding an inscrut¬ able thing as a cause, it may be sufficient to cite a passage from Mr. Spencer's " Principles of Psychology," from which it appears that he does not always regard the unimaginable- ness of a thing as a sufficient reason for rejecting it. Avowing " the belief that mind and nervous action are the subjective and objective faces of the same thing," he con¬ fesses that "we remain utterly incapable of seeing, and even of imagining, how the two are related. Mind," he adds, " still continues to us a something without any kin¬ ship to the other things; and from the science which discovers by introspection the laws of this something, there is no passage by transitional steps to the sciences which discover the laws of these other things." * Here, then, is a belief which caniiot abide the crucial test of one of Mr. Spencer's first principles, and yet he holds it!' If he can hold this belief despite its inconceivableness, with what show of consistency can he reject, on the ground of its inconceivableness, the belief in.the doctrine of a special creation To quote his own words, at the close of this argument against the Scripture doctrine, if " belief, properly so-called, implies a mental representation of the thing believed ; and," as he confesses, " no such mental repre¬ sentation is here possible." how can he believe that there is any relation between " those thoughts and feelings which constitute consciousness," and the action of the nervous system In a word, then, even though the doctrine objected to were that of the creation of an organism, ex nihilo, Mr. Spencer could not consistently reject it on the ground specified. As the common and Scriptural doctrine, so far as organisms is concerned, is not that of a direct creation ex nihilo, but a mediate creation out of previously existing matter, Mr. Spencer is constrained to frame his objection so as to meet this aspect of the question. This hypothesis, he alleges, involves, ultimately, " the creation of force ; and the creation of force is just as inconceivable as the creation of matter." He asks, " The myriad atoms * " Principles of Psychology," Vol. I., pp. 140-56.</page><page sequence="28">28 SPENCER'S BIOLOGICAL HYPOTHESIS. going to the composition of the new organism, all of them previously dispersed through the neighbouring air and earth, does each, suddenly disengaging itself from its com¬ binations, rush to meet the rest, unite with them into the appropriate chemical compounds, and then fall with certain others into its appointed place in the aggregate of complex tissues and organs ?" This, he says, is " to assume a myriad of supernatural impulses, differing in their directions and amounts, given to as many different atoms," and is, there¬ fore, " a multiplication of mysteries rather than a solution of a mystery. Every one of these impulses, not being the result of a force locally existing in some other form, implies the creation of force ; and the creation of force is just as inconceivable as the creation of matter." Now, it will be observed that Mr. Spencer has some difficulty in bringing his mental-representation principle into conflict with the doctrine of the creation of organisms out of existing matter. Not only is the doctrine, on his own showing, capable of mental presentation, but he has himself given us a sketch of the process. He has figured the atoms disengaging themselves and entering into new combinations, and taking, as if by magic, their places in the aggregate of complex tissues and organs. He has put before us a process not unlike the process of crystallisation, so beautifully described by Professor Tyndall in his " Fragments of Science," and in his late Manchester lecture on " Crystalline and Molecular Forces," and one which is actually realised in the evolution of the animal from the embryo, as described by Professor Huxley. In the following passage, Dr. Tyndall gives a very graphic sketch of the process by which, materialists allege, the thing pronounced by Mr. Spencer to be inconceivable, may be done. " And now let us pass from what we are accustomed to regard as a dead mineral to a living grain of corn. When it is examined by polarised light, chromatic phenomena similar to those noticed in crystals are observed. And why Because the architecture of the grain resembles the</page><page sequence="29">CONTRADICTS TYNDALL'S HYPOTHESIS. 29 architecture of the crystal. In the grain also the molecules are set in definite positions, and in accordance with their arrangement they act upon the light. But what has built together the molecules of the corn I have already said, regarding crystalline architecture, that you may, if you please, consider the atoms and molecules to be placed in position by a power external to themselves. The same hypothesis is open to you now. But if in the case of crystals you have rejected this notion of an external architect, I think you are bound to reject it now, and to conclude that the molecules of the corn are self-posited by the forces with which they act upon each other. It would be poor philosophy to invoke an external agent in the one case, and to reject it in the other. " Instead of cutting our grain of corn into slices, and subjecting it to the action of polarised light, let us place it in the earth, and subject it to a certain degree of warmth. In other words, let the molecules, both of the corn and of the surrounding earth, be kept in that state of agitation which we call warmth. Under these circumstances, the grain, and the substances which surround it, interact, and a definite molecular architecture is the result. A bud is formed; this bud reaches the surface, where it is exposed to the sun's rays, which are also to be regarded as a kind of vibratory motion. And as the motion of common heat with which the grain and the substances surrounding it were first endowed, enabled the grain and these substances to exercise their attractions and repulsions, and thus to coalesce in definite forms, so the specific motion of the sun's rays now enables the green bud to feed upon the carbonic acid and the aqueous vapour of the air. The bud appropriates those constituents of both for which it has an elective attraction, and permits the other constituent to resume its place in the air. Thus the architecture is carried on. Forces are active at the root, forces are active in the blade, the matter of the earth and the matter of the atmosphere are drawn towards the root and blade, and the plant augments in size. We have in succession the bud,</page><page sequence="30">30 SPENCER'S BIOLOGICAL HYPOTHESIS. the stalk, the ear, the full corn in the ear; the cycle of molecular action being completed by the production of grains similar to that with which the process began. " Now there is nothing in this process which necessarily eludes the conceptive or imagining power of the purely human mind. An intellect the same in kind as our own would, if only sufficiently expanded, be able to follow the whole process from beginning to end. It would see every molecule placed in its position by the specific attractions and repulsions exerted between it and other molecules, the whole process and its consummation being an instance of the play of molecular force. Given the grain and its environment, the purely human intellect might, if suffi¬ ciently expanded, trace out a priori every step of the process of growth, and by the application of purely mechanical principles demonstrate that the cycle must end, as it is seen to end, in the production of forms like that with which it began. A similar necessity rules here to that which rules the planets in their circuits round the sun. " You will notice that I am stating my truth strongly, as at the beginning we agreed it should be stated. But I must go still further, and affirm that in the eye of science the animal body is just as much the product of molecular force as the stalk and ear of corn, or as the crystal of salt or sugar. Many of the parts of the body are obviously mechanical. Take the human heart, for example, with its system of valves, or take the exquisite mechanism of the eye or hand. Animal heat, moreover, is the same in kind as the heat of a fire, being produced by the same chemical process. Animal motion, too, is as directly derived from the food of the animal, as the motion of Trevethyck's walking-engine from the fuel in its furnace. As regards matter, the animal body creates nothing ; as regards force, it creates nothing. ' Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature ?' All that has been said, then, regarding the plant may be re-stated with regard to the animal. Every particle that enters into the composition of</page><page sequence="31">SPENCER FAILS IN APPLYING HIS CRUCIAL TEST. 31 a muscle, a nerve, or a bone, has been placed in its position by molecular force. And unless the existence of law in these matters be denied, and the element of caprice intro¬ duced, we must conclude that, given the relation of any molecule of the body to its environment, its position in the body might be determined mathematically. Our difficulty is not with the quality of the problem, but with its com¬ plexity; and this difficulty might be met by the simple expansion of the faculties which we now possess. Given this expansion, with the necessary molecular data, and the chick might be deduced as rigorously and as logically from the egg as the existence of Neptune from the disturbances of Uranus, or as conical refraction from the undulatory theory of light." * So far, therefore, as Mr. Spencer's own crucial test is concerned, Dr. Tyndall has shown that the doctrine of creation out of existing matter can abide the ordeal. It may be said, and is said, that the hypothesis postulates " the necessary molecular data," or, as Mr. Spencer says, organic matter, to begin with; but if vital, and chemical, and me¬ chanical forces be, as the school of Mr. Spencer would have us believe, both quantitative and qualitative equivalents, surely one who is master of the laws of chemical and mechanical forces ought to be able to construct living organ¬ isms, without creating a new force. If vital forces be the same both in quality and quantity with chemical and mechanical forces, there can be no difficulty about producing vegetable or animal embryos. It was doubtless this fact which led him to fall back, by way of supplement, on the creation ex nihilo hypothesis, which he h'ad, in his own opinion, already demolished. The doctrine of a creation out of existing matter, involves, ultimately, the doctrine of " the creation of force; and the creation of force is just as inconceivable as the creation of matter." This is the fable of the wolf and the lamb over again. If you did not do it, your father or grandfather did, and you must pay the forfeit. * "Fragments of Science," pp. 116-119.</page><page sequence="32">32 SPENCER'S BIOLOGICAL HYPOTHESIS. Here, then, is a plain issue raised by Mr. Spencer, and we accept it. The question at issue is simply this—Does the disintegration and reintegration of matter imply the crea¬ tion of force? The mere statement of the question is sufficient for any man competent to form an opinion on the subject in dispute. If the process referred to involves the creation of a force not " locally existing in some other form," how is it that processes of disintegration and integration can be carried on by chemists, who have confessedly no power of creating new forces The disengagement of atoms, and the recombination of them into new compounds, pronounced impossible except on the assumption of the creation of a new force not locally existing in some other form, take place in every instance of chemical analysis and synthesis, without any such adventitious aid. All that is needed in either case is an operator possessing the requisite know¬ ledge of the elements concerned. If the chemist can perform such wonders in his laboratory without the help of a new force, is it incredible that the author of the elements should be able to employ them in the construction of living organisms There is no escape here possible to an evolu¬ tionist of the school of Spencer. If vital force be the correlate of chemical and mechanical, the origination of life cannot, as Mr. Spencer alleges, imply the creation of a force not previously existing. It is, therefore, only on the assumption that vital force is not the correlate of mere material forces, that Mr Spencer's objection can have any meaning. The thing assumed, however, is fatal to his biological hypothesis, which rests, ultimately, on the con¬ vertibility of material forces into vital. Assuming that those who hold the doctrine of special creation regard the demonstration of divine power made in the origination of species as designed solely for the benefit of mankind, Mr. Spencer asks, to whom was the demonstration made? As "the great majority of these supposed special creations took place before mankind existed, to what purpose," he asks, "were the millions of these demonstrations which took place on the earth when</page><page sequence="33">MANIFESTS IGNORANCE OF DOCTRINE OF CREATION. 33 there were no intelligent beings to contemplate them Did the Unknowable thus demonstrate His own power to Himself? Few," he remarks, "will have the hardihood to say that any such demonstration was needful. There is no choice but to regard them either as superfluous exercises of power, which is a derogatory supposition; or as exercises of power that were necessary because species could not be otherwise produced, which is also a derogatory sup¬ position." * Now, in the first place, no person properly instructed in the Scriptures would, for a moment, think of representing the entire series of creative acts as having for their sole end the demonstration of the power of God to man. Other ends by no means derogatory to the Creator may be assumed, such as delight in the exercise of His wisdom, and power, and bounty, and sovereignty. Mr. Spencer assumes that if His acts had not reference to man alone, they must have been designed to demonstrate His power to Himself, or were necessary because species could not be otherwise produced—both of which suppositions, he alleges, are derogatory. As we have seen, the alternative assumed is not the only one open to the advocates of special creations. Besides the one mentioned above, the student of the Bible can specify many others. It were not a derogatory sup¬ position that God, in those remote creations, was demon¬ strating His attributes to other orders of intelligences of which the Scriptures speak, and against whose existence science has no facts to urge. Or it might be said in reply, that as the Author of the earth, with its successive orders of vegetable and animal organisms, knew that in the latter days scoffers would arise, who would call in question His existence, and endeavour to prove that all organic forms were evolved from uncreated matter, by an impersonal power resident in matter itself, or conditioned by it, He so ordered the manifestations of life on our globe, as to show that the links of the great biological chain have been separately created, and not consecutively evolved. * " Principles of Biology," Vol. I., p. 339. C</page><page sequence="34">34 SPENCER'S BIOLOGICAL HYPOTHESIS. And lastly, it may be observed, that if this earth were to furnish a text-book for geologists, it was necessary that it should be printed before it was published or read. If our earth was to instruct men, and serve as a school for their mental and moral discipline, it was essential that, prior to their matriculation, it should be properly furnished. That admirable scholastic arrangements have been made, is attested by the earnest competition and enthusiasm dis¬ played by the ever-increasing band of scientists who crowd its halls; and few who have thoroughly investigated the problems prepared for them, have ever imagined that they were propounded by a blind, unintelligent, unconscious force. Mr. Spencer regards it as an objection to the doctrine of special creation, that beings endowed with capacities for wide thought and high feeling did not exist on our globe millions of years before man appeared. The answer has been given already, and is obvious. It is simply this—Our globe was not fit at an earlier stage to receive such beings. Special creation does not set aside order and adaptation ; and is perfectly consistent with an original incandescent state of our globe watched over by the Creator, who, at the proper stages in its history, introduced such organisms as were suited to its condition, and fitted to prepare it as a dwelling-place for man. Equally unhappy is the argument against design drawn from the structure of animals of prey, exhibiting, as such structures do, countless pain-inflicting appliances—appli¬ ances which have been doing their deadly work all through the geological eras. " How happens it," our author asks, " that animals were so designed as to render this bloodshed necessary ?" * For the advocate of design, he alleges, there is but the one alternative—-viz., that the Creator was either unable or unwilling to make animals so as to avoid the infliction of such misery. Still greater, he thinks, is the difficulty when we consider that branch of the arrangement in which provision is made for the support of the inferior by the sacrifice of the superior, as in the case of parasites. * "Principles of Biology," Vol. I., p. 341.</page><page sequence="35">ASSUMES BENEFICENCE AS ESSENTIAL TO DESIGN. 35 To these objections we reply, that they assume several things which are not conceded. I. They assume that the design of creation, as held by teleologists, is the production of the greatest possible amount of happiness throughout the entire orders of organic, sentient life. For this assumption, there is no warrant to be found either in tele¬ ology, or in nature. There is a manifest subordination running throughout the whole chain of sentient existence, from the mollusk to the man. No inferior order lives for itself or simply for its own enjoyment. It is a link in a series constituting one great whole, from which no member can be removed without causing universal detriment, and the final link of which lives, not for himself, but for Him to whom he owes his being. The theology of the whole maybe expressed in one sentence: each inferior order not for itself, but for a higher; all the inferior for man, and man for God. Such is the testimony of the organic worlds, and such is the doctrine of man's moral nature and of the Word of God. In this system there is suffering, but it is none the less in harmony with the facts. 2. Mr. Spencer's objections assume that if we cannot point out a beneficent design, there is no proof of design at all. Such an objection may possibly have force with one under the fascination of an hypothesis which he would fondly sustain against all comers ; but no man, whose mind is not warped by prejudice, can for a moment believe that benevolence is a necessary element in design. Any arrange¬ ment embracing means for the attainment of a definite end carries with it evidence of design, and is so regarded by all men as soon as the arrangement and the end are appre¬ hended. It matters not whether the end be benevolent or malign, whether the arrangement be ingenious or clumsy, the moment the connexion between the means employed and the end aimed at, is discovered, the mind instinctively infers a design and a designer. The horn of the sword-fish, the teeth of the lion, the talons of the eagle, are regarded by all men, whether evolutionists or creationists, as instru¬ ments of design ; and the philosopher who challenges the</page><page sequence="36">36 SPENCER'S BIOLOGICAL HYPOTHESIS. evidence does but proclaim his folly, and reveal his pre¬ judice. 3. It is obvious that Mr. Spencer's objections to the doctrine of design are drawn, not from the facts under investigation, but from certain inferences in regard to the effects of this doctrine upon our views of the character of the Creator. He finds organisms not constructed so as to prevent suffering, and immediately concludes that organisms have not been designed. Why Because the designer must have either been unable or unwilling to design them so as to prevent suffering. This alternative he thinks fatal to the doctrine of design, as it either casts an imputation on the Divine character or involves a limitation of the Divine power.* Now, as we have already seen, our recognition of the marks of design does not depend upon the character of the end aimed at in the contrivance, but simply upon the adap¬ tation of the means to the attainment of the end, whatever the end may be. Constituted as we are, it is absolutely impossible to discover such adaptation without immediately inferring a design and a designer. This is a first principle, which the human mind cannot relinquish without doing violence to its own constitution. It is, in fact, but another form of the principle, that every effect must have a cause. In view of this fact, it is manifest that the only course open to the impugner of the doctrine of design, is to meet the teleologist on the question of fact, and to prove that animal and vegetable organisms bear in their structure no traces of design. If he cannot do this (and Mr. Spencer's work on Biology, by leaving it not only undone but unattempted, is sufficient proof that he cannot), he must surrender at discretion. Instead of facing the facts and divesting them of those marks of design which the human mind instinc¬ tively recognises, our author carefully evades the real question at issue, and raises an entirely distinct one respect¬ ing the effect of the doctrine of design upon our views of the Divine character. This procedure is as unmanly as it * "Principles of Biology," Vol. 1., p. 341.</page><page sequence="37">"SPENCER'S DILEMMAS EXAMINED. 37 is unphilosophical and unscientific. It is unmanly not to face the facts presented in the structures of the fauna and flora of our world ; and it is unphilosophical and unscientific not to follow out, to their legitimate conclusions, irrespec¬ tive of imaginary ulterior consequences, the principles revealed by a fair analysis of the phenomena they present. With a philosopher, the question is not, " What effect will a fair interpretation of these facts have upon some other doctrine ?" but simply," What do the facts, fairly interpreted, teach ?" To borrow a manly and truly philosophical sentiment, uttered by Professor Huxley in his address before the late meeting of the British Association, " Logical consequences are the scarecrows of fools and the beacons of wise men."* Theologians are not afraid of the logical consequences of the doctrine of design upon their views of the Divine character; nor will Mr. Spencer be able to turn them aside from the question at issue, by hanging up, for the thousandth time, the old weather-beaten scare¬ crow of optimism, fashioned, to suit his own purpose, out of the straw of a false speculative theology. Of course, if the God of the Bible be the God assumed in Mr. Spencer's critique on His works, and the end aimed at by Him be the end ascribed to Him by His reviewer, it might be difficult to reconcile the actual phenomena of the organic world with the character of such a Being. If the Creator possess but two attributes—benevolence and power —and if His design in creation be the production of the greatest possible amount of happiness, it might puzzle the ablest of optimists to reconcile those pain-inflicting con¬ trivances which abound in the actual organic arrangement, with the character, and aim, and capacities of this optimistic Deity. But as the God of the Bible possesses more attributes than the two specified, and sets before Him higher ends than the mere happiness of His creatures—as He is holy and just, as well as almighty and benevolent, and regards the interests of His moral creatures as superior to those of the mere sentient orders of animal organisms, and considers * "Fortnightly Review," Nov., 1874, p. 577.</page><page sequence="38">38 SPENCER'S BIOLOGICAL HYPOTHESIS. their moral culture a higher end than their happiness, yea, has linked their happiness to their moral and spiritual character, and set His own glory before them as their highest end, and the source of their highest enjoyment—-as this is the character, and these the aims, of the God of the Bible, Mr. Spencer's objections are as irrelevant as the premises on which they are based are false. As our critic cannot take in the whole issues of the mighty cycle em¬ braced in that plan of which these phenomena strewn on the shores of time are but the initial movements, it is nothing short of arrogance to pronounce, as he has ventured to do, upon the moral character of the Author of the system. 4. Mr. Spencer's objections proceed upon the assumption, that a theory which does not account for every class of phenomena, however remotely connected with the subject under investigation, is, ipso facto, discredited. For example, as in the present instance, if the advocate of design cannot solve the problem of the ultimate design of the various orders of animal and vegetable organisms, he is not to be permitted to speak of the immediate and proximate design of these closely correlated kingdoms of nature. If he cannot tell why, or for what ultimate end, God made great whales, and then constructed sword-fish equipped with a weapon for their destruction, he must be told that he has failed to prove that either whales or sword-fish are the offspring of design If a teleologist cannot tell why God created acari to burrow in the skin and torture man, he has failed to prove that either man or his tormentors exhibit marks of intelligent purpose! If he cannot take in the vast range of organic relations (embracing, as multitudinous orders do, organisms which nothing but the most powerful microscope can reveal), and grasp the scheme of creation in its entirety, he is not entitled to speak of any class of relations as evincing contrivance In a word, so long as anything remains unexplained, nothing is explained. Will any scientist accept this prin¬ ciple Will any astronomer venture to affirm that Kepler had explained nothing, when he enunciated the law that</page><page sequence="39">INCONSISTENT IN BELIEVING THE INCONCEIVABLE. 39 "planets revolve in elliptic orbits about the sun, which occupies the common focus of all these orbits," because he had not then discovered the second great law, that " if a line be drawn from the centre of the sun to any planet, this line, as it is carried forward by the planet, will sweep over equal areas in equal portions of time"? Or, is it to be held that the foregoing laws explain nothing, because Kepler had yet to ponder the relations of the members of the solar system for seventeen years before he discovered the third law, that the squares of the periodic times of the planets are to each other as the cubes of their mean distances from the sun Are all these laws to be repudiated, because their discoverer was not able to tell why the orbits of the planets and satellites should be ellipses rather than any other curve, or to tell, as Newton has done, what power holds these mighty masses " steady in their swift career, producing the most exquisite harmony of motion, and a uniformity of result as steady as the march of time." * Will Mr. Spencer abandon the evolution hypothesis, because, as confessed by himself, it does not explain the connexion of consciousness with nervous action Will he give up his hypothesis because of its failure to explain this mysterious relationship Tele- ologists are entitled to press this question with all the con¬ fidence of an a fortiori, for they are asking evolutionists to give up a hypothesis for which there is no positive proof, and which fails, absolutely and confessedly, at the most important point in the evolutionary sequence; whilst, on the other hand, the doctrine of design is engraven on every organism within the realm of organic nature, and engraven so manifestly, that the ablest advocate of the evolution hypothesis—the philosopher of the school— has nothing to advance against it, save certain consequences which he alleges flow from it—consequences which, as we have already seen, lie only against a speculative, theological optimism, which has no basis in the word of God. In a word, then, it is only by petty criticisms, based on the assumption that the theology of the Bible is optimistic, * Mitchell's " Orbs of Heaven," p. 71.</page><page sequence="40">40 SPENCER'S BIOLOGICAL HYPOTHESIS. that this prince of evolutionists can make even a show of argument against the doctrine of design in creation. His assumption is false, and his critique pointless and worthless. To use his own language in his estimate of the doctrine he assails, his hypothesis must be pronounced worthless— "worthless by its derivation," from Democritus and Lu¬ cretius ; " worthless in its intrinsic incoherence," as de¬ manding continuity, and yet admitting the existence of impassable gulfs between the most important elements in the series ; " worthless as absolutely without evidence," no evolutionist having as yet been able to point to the evolution of a single new fertile species from any other; " worthless as not supplying an intellectual need," failing, as it does, to conform to the primary belief that evidence of design implies the existence of a designer; " worthless as not satisfying a moral want," repudiating, as it does, the very idea of the existence of a personal, moral intelligence, who sustains to us the relations of Creator, Governor, and Judge. " We must, therefore, consider it as counting for nothing, in opposition to" that Scripture doctrine of Creation which fulfils all these conditions, and meets all the intellectual and moral requirements of our nature. Constituted as man is, he cannot rest in any theory of this wondrous universe, which does not place an omnipotent moral Intelligence first in the absolute order of existence, as the efficient cause of all forces, whether chemical, mechanical, vital, or mental.
