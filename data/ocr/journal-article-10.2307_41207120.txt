All communications should be ad- dressed to: Editor, The American Scholar, i8ii Q Street, N. W., Washington, D. С 20009. Because of space limitations we cannot guarantee to print all letters received. - Editor René Wellek is to be thanked for his dis- cussion of the arguments for the "death of literature" in the Winter 1972-73 issue of The American Scholar. It is unfortunate, however, that his justifiable scorn for those who predict a nonlinguistic and nonliterary future has led him to reject out-of-hand all arguments against value judgment as a component of criticism. Wellek argues for the concept of "quality" as a "criterion of literaure" by simply proving that "literature" has existed since Classical times. Obviously this does not demonstrate the exist- ence of a concept of "quality"; it merely proves that there has been a category labeled "litera- ture" into which certain works have been put. Wellek faults Fiedler for turning toward "the folksy, the sentimental, the direct expression of simple feelings," in short, "subliterature." He fails to recognize that the very "Children's Hour" cited by Fiedler, and seemingly disap- proved of by Wellek, is generally classed as literature, albeit "bad" literature. What is meant by good and bad, art and nonart? Un- fortunately, Wellek and other proponents of the judgmental approach to criticism seem unable to tell us - instead they recite histories of the category "literature." Wellek states in conclusion that, while the forms of literature will change, "as long as there is man in any conceivable shape he will create - that is, speak, express and communicate in writing and in print his observations, his feelings, his desires .... Doubts about the exact limits of literature cannot obviate the difference between art and nonart, great and bad art. . . ." Advertising "literature" represents a communication of the feelings and desires of man, a probing into "the nature of the world around him." How is Wellek to distinguish this form, which he rejects, from his literature? Finally, Wellek imagines that "doubts about language" will make the poet "suspicious of the debasement of the word in propaganda, ad- vertising and bad journalism." What is meant by debasement? Change? And is the poet to be immune to change? If he is, we shall no doubt find the definition of the frozen form "litera- ture" much easier to formulate. Margaret Sharon Fearey Ann Arbor, Michigan Mr. Wellek replies: Mrs. Fearey asks me to write a treatise on the nature of litera- ture and criticism. I can refer her to my (and Austin Warren's) Theory of Literature (1948), which contains a chapter on "Evalua- tion." There we formulated general criteria of judgment, such as coherence, complexity, multivalence, et cetera. More concretely, a recognition of quality in specific texts can be learned from books such as I. A. Rich- ards's Practical Criticism (1929) or Brooks and Warren, Understanding Poetry (1938). There is also an immediate recognition of quality al- luded to in my paper when I speak about "the difference between Shakespeare and a news- paper poem, a story by Tolstoy and one in True Confessions/' a judgment that could be demonstrated by detailed comparison. Any teacher of composition will know why he flunked one paper and gave an A to another and would be able to explain it to his student. Mrs. Fearey is mistaken in brushing aside the historical argument: there are good reasons why we read Shakespeare rather than another con- temporary dramatist such as Henry Glapthorne, or Milton rather than Sir Richard Blackmore. The canon of great writers has been established by generations of readers and critics who had a sense of quality. Argument stops if one simply denies value and quality in life and literature. The new barbarism is installed. Any clarity about the nature of art will ex- clude advertising from it, however socially use- ful it may be and whatever ingenuity it may require in devising. If we recognize that language should be gram- matical, accurate, and precise, we must deplore the debasement of the word so obvious today. I don't see how one can deny the fact that there 365</page><page sequence="2">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR is a rising tide of illiteracy even among repu- table writing that cannot be called merely change. Horrifying examples are, for instance, collected in today's New York Times Book Re- view by Katherine Fassenden under the title "Pouring Over Grammar" (January 7, 1973). Mrs. Fearey's letter seems to be a deplorable example of current confusion on elementary matters. If taken literally, her denial of judg- ment, value, or the difference between good and bad art would lead to a complete leveling down, to anarchy and nihilism, to an abolition of criticism (meaning selection, discrimination). Her views on language would mean that any change is welcome, however obfuscating, base, and even vile. Let us hope that she does not really mean it. # # # As a regular reader of The American Scholar, your article, "The Age of Overutiliza- tion," in the Winter 1972-73 issue was read with a great deal of interest. As a trustee of a 314B CHP Agency, I fully agree. Your points were well taken regarding overutilization, although your article was over- simplified and overgeneralized in dealing with the broad and highly complex subject of health care. I often fall into this same trap. As a chiropractor, I still cringe slightly at your "Quacks and Chiropractors," but I am old enough to have survived the clichés and worn phrases of Morris Fishbein. It is with a greater concern that I tend to view health care. My "cringing" or, for that matter, my personal feelings are really unim- portant. The important fact remains that peo- ple are paying a fantastic price, 70 billion dollars yearly, and receiving poor health care. I am fully cognizant that any brief article or letter dealing with such a complex entity as our fragmented and inefficient health care system tends to add to the frustrations. However, I would like to offer the proposition that, as health providers, we humble our egos and view patients as people; then sit down and talk with one another, to provide a system or program for the prevention of disease and the caring of the ill. I admire the medical profession for many of its life saving methods and its scientific ap- proaches, although I am at a loss to find scien- tific reasoning in your nonscientific "Chiro- practic manipulation, which we physicians feel does harm by tearing muscles." I don't accept this statement; but if I did, how did the "peo- ple with back trouble feel better" with torn muscles? In closing, I offer the chiropractic profession has faults, many faults. I also offer the medical profession has many faults. I offer that our total health delivery picture has many faults; but I offer that our answers will be found - not by name-calling, but rather by total compassion for people. Stanley С Kerby, D. C. Santa Fe, New Mexico Dr. Mengis replies: I do not see that Dr. Kerby and I have a basic difference of opinion regarding the reckless overinflation of medical costs and procedures and empire-building prev- alent in this country for the past five years. If I alluded to quacks and chiropractors in one phrase it is surely because chiropractic medicine has failed to police its field of endeavor as well as it should have in years past. I am personally familiar with several chiropractors in my own locale, and regard them as honest and com- petent, and know that they render relief of muscle aches and pain with their manipulation and that they are prompt to advise medical consultation when it is indicated. In addition, I also know several doctors of medicine who are familiar with and use manipulation for muscle strains, et cetera. That does not change the fact that, in the long run, manipulation of spastic muscle causes microscopic tears and bleeding that eventuate in fibrosis. I have been an advocate of universal health insurance since I was in medical school in the days of Harry S. Truman, have taken my lumps for that advocacy from self-righteous fools in organized medicine, and I hate to see the peo- ple's effort toward that goal subverted into ex- pensive air-castles benefitting not the sick but the opportunist provider. # # # I quite agree with Michael Arbib (Winter, 1972-73) that the computer is a dumb critter compared to the human mind, not only be- cause of the mind's complexity, as you said, but because the mind is made of living tissue which is an entirely different building ma- terial from wires and diodes. We make a mis- take in assuming that living tissue is passive like man-made mechanisms. Could man create a mechanism that would start with a simple design such as an amino acid molecule, evolve on its own to a reproductive cell and on to an intelligent creature such as man? There must be something dynamic in the delicate forces of protein molecules that we may never be able to measure, yet we have a means of detecting, called "intuition." By in- 366</page><page sequence="3">THE READER REPLIES tuition this dynamic something seems to be an "impulse to act" because it has resulted in an evolution toward forms having ever greater freedom to act. Life is a natural result because life is activity. In fact from the sub- atomic particles on up, everything in this uni- verse is in action, so is it not intuitively sensible to think of creation as the result of a cosmic "impulse to act"? This makes the cosmos dynamic, and to my mind this makes sense. I heartily endorse your idea that intuition can be a valuable partner of science. Carl N. Sanford Atlanta, Georgia Mr. Arbib replies: While grateful for Mr. Sanford's enthusiasm, I am not clear we are using words the same way. Our knowledge of the activity of protein molecules is surely due to the science of biochemistry rather than to our intuition. Again, talk of a cosmic "impulse to act" seems like a misapplication of intuition - to see the complexity of the universe in overly anthropomorphic terms. I would not have thought passivity was the distinctive mark of the machine. Perhaps the point is that we do not think of machines as evolving. However, the social organism which is now evolving is built on man-machine sym- biosis, and as we evolve new machines, (for instance, cars) so do we evolve new patterns of social organization (witness Los Angeles). Finally, may I take this opportunity to sug- gest that the theme of Lionel Trilling's "Mind in the Modern World" is very much in harmony with mine. While neither of us is sanguine about the evolution of our society, neither of us sees "mind at the end of its tether," in H. G. Wells's phrase. However, we are both disturbed by those who downgrade mind in these complex times. We need the discipline of the humanities to help us set our goals, we need the discipline of science to provide mech- anisms for achieving some of them, while others require advances in psychology and soci- ology. My plea for a marriage of science and intuition requires the intuition of the average citizen to be honed by science and the hu- manities to a far greater degree than current education seems to provide. # # # Roger du Beam in his comment (Winter issue) on the women's symposium offers a num- ber of sound points, but he is too roundabout in his approach and moreover speaks from mere opinion. I prefer to rely on precedent attested by scholarship, for which I refer you to Frazer's Golden Bough, abridged edition (1951), p. 113. Comment on the passage is superfluous: "Among the Gallas (S. Ethiopia), when a woman grows tired of the cares of housekeep- ing, she begins to talk incoherently and to de- mean herself extravagantly. This is a sign of the descent of the holy spirit Callo upon her. Immediately her husband prostrates himself and adores her; she ceases to bear the humble title of wife and is called 'Lord,' domestic duties have no further claim on her, and her will is a divine law." I am, sir, Yours Callo, Callay, L. O. MacDuff New York, New York As a participant in the "Women on Women" forum in the Autumn Scholar, I am torn be- tween the desire to see the whole thing buried as quickly as possible, and the desire to clarify, lest the flounderings of what a comment calls "so many incisive minds" give comfort to The Enemy. The latter urge, I see, is greater, and I have set down my own brief version here: On a certain day, eight women, a number of whom had never seen or talked to one another before, assembled in New York from their various cities, went into a room, sat around a table. A tape recorder was turned on. A ques- tion incomprehensible to everyone there, whose very intention was shrouded in mystery, was slipped, like a paper bag, over one's head. Then for the entire time, the eight women, singly and collectively, tried to fight their way out of the bag. The comments that fell onto the tape that day were spillage from that fight to get out of the bag. Why didn't someone say, "Let's abandon this question, and talk about what we can talk about?" Interesting. Eight women of good will and much professional self-discipline, felt com- mitted, upon the slightest of directives, to an impossible goal (feelings of loyalty to the direct- ing person should not be discounted). Spontaneity in the struggle there certainly was. And spontaneity became the byword when I beheld the typescript of that session, with its half-uttered thoughts all strangling inside the paper bag. For the sake of spontaneity, we were honor-bound to change nothing except what might be garbled by the tape. Here I am reminded of an emblem of my childhood. Whatever one did, or didn't do, it 367</page><page sequence="4">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR was said: "There is a Watchbird, watching you." And so I see, upon picking up the Autumn Scholar, that this spontaneous struggle to get out of a verbal paper bag has been subjected to a solemn explication de texte and found to be lacking. What else is new? Con- sciousness-raising session? When was that sup- posed to have happened? No, no! We were in the bag the whole time! Was it all, then just a bit of mischief wreaked, intentionally or not, by the utterer of those first, sibylline words? No, not that pri- marily, either. What it was was yet another proof that spontaneity as a form is as rotten now as it always was. And that the Living Theater of the Absurd will swallow us all, if we don't watch out. Norma Rosen Cambridge, Massachusetts # # # So the Scholar has finally dealt with the troublesome Woman Question, by publishing a transcript of a taped private discussion by dis- tinguished women on the subject. In the last five years, you have never published a similar discussion: any other broad topics, whether youth, justice, et cetera, have been subjected either to lengthy and separate analyses by various experts, or you have reprinted a pub- lic symposium with moderator, in which the participants spoke in long paragraphs for public aural consumption. Why the use in this case of a (for the Scholar) unique format? Why not ask the same women for separate brief articles from the beginning, instead of as an after- thought? Then something important might have been said! As it was, these writers were asked to be profound out loud and en masse, and they have ended sounding like a gaggle of geese, one voice blurring into the next. In any "conversa- tion," as this must be defined, much of the burden of communication is carried non- verbally, and all the nuances and continuity thus conveyed are inevitably lost to us. Since it is impossible thus to follow who is saying what in this format, the result is an apparent demonstration, once again, of the "shallowness" of women's minds. You have clearly shown what these women - and all others - have lost in their attempt to win deserved recognition as serious human beings: by co- operating with you in this discussion/conversa- tion, these distinguished minds have lost their distinguishability. No wonder, in Patricia Mc- Laughlin's words, they did not seem "immune to confusion." What chance did you give them to demonstrate coherence in their own chosen medium, the written word? With friends like the unconsciously (?) male chauvinist Hiram Haydn, who needs enemies? Judith H. Balfe Upper Montclair, New Jersey There is no reason for Melville Cane to put down woman's attempt to better her condition by calling it "griping." When blacks explain their inequities and workers fight for a fair wage, would he dismiss their problems as "grip- ing," or would he perhaps feel that their deep needs deserve a more exact word? Roger du Beam's letter was superficially clever, flip, wordy and full of irrelevant ma- terial, with no attempt to deal with any more vital question in the women's movement than the use of Ms. If a woman's actual words jarred his taste and prejudices, "why did you not edit them out," - or at least edit his letter? I had looked forward to some comprehensive male comments based on men's superior logic and grasp of the total problem. Are these really the best letters you received about the women's forum? Gradually we conclude that a good deal of men's comment on women's liberation is shal- low, fearful and entirely unworthy of them. "Look out, women! You may lose more than you gain!" Thus men reveal that they cannot bear to face any loss of dominance, even though in the long run such loss might become more gain than they dream. Lois Goeltz Knoxville, Tennessee If 4F W The Autumn Scholar includes two articles which discuss the role of women in society. Neville Maxwell ("The China Nixon Didn't See") points out that the cultural revolution in China has produced an apparently classless society where women participate equally in both urban and agricultural positions. The forum, "Women on Women," strikes home the fact that in our society, most "lower-class ladies" have not yet become involved in women's equalization movements. Is it coincidental that two such divergent ap- proaches to sexual equality were published in the same volume? Janet N. Rehm San Diego, California 368</page></plain_text>
