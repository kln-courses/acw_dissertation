<plain_text><page sequence="1">My Egypt The Irony of the American Dream Karal Ann Marling M Y EGYPT BY CHARLES DEMUTH (1883-1935) remains one of the great enigmas of American art (fig. 1). This monumental portrayal of a grain elevator- specifically, the John W. Eshelman and Sons silo near the center of the artist's native Lancaster, Pennsylvania-is a recognized American master- piece.1 As such, the picture is ritually invoked, an emblem of precisionist ambivalence toward the im- agery of industrial mass culture during the eco- nomic boom of the 192os.2 Yet critics of the day and modern scholars have given My Egypt cursory attention; indeed, their comments on its substance Karal Ann Marling is associate professor of art history and American studies, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. The author wishes to thank James M. Dennis of the De- partment of Art History, University of Wisconsin-Madison, for his patient encouragement, for his unflagging interest in this study over the past two years, and for his benign skepticism. 1 S.

For example, see Matthew Baigell, A History of American Painting (New York: Praeger Publishers, 1971), p. 219, fig. 11-3, and Barbara Rose, American Art Since 900o (rev. ed.; New York: Praeger Publishers, 1975), p. 91, fig. 4-30. Art historians have been particularly concerned with Demuth's cubo-realist treatment of industrialmechanistic themes and the stylistic relationship between precisionism and the development of American modernism: see John I.

A statement issued in 1935 by Stieglitz's An American Place gal- lery sagely noted that "[My Egypt] has a history, its history may some day be known. A slow process, this knowing, knowing history. hard to know. the painting may then be seen, be received. hard to see, to receive."4 Tracing the history of My Egypt is a hard and a slow process precisely because, as the elliptical prose of the gallery brochure suggests, the painting is bound up with the experiential di- mension of American history. Only against such a fluid backdrop can the iconic significance of the grain elevator in the American 1920S and the re- lationship of that symbol to the portentous title, My Egypt, be seen and received. 3 Critical discussion of Demuth by his contemporaries is ably summarized and reviewed by David Gebhard, "Charles Demuth and the Twenties," in David Gebhard and Phyllis Pious, Charles Demuth: The Mechanical Encrusted on the Living (Santa Barbara: University of California Art Gallery, 1971), pp. 8-12. The most sweeping claims for the significance of Demuth's ironic elision of commonplace, technological iconography and a brittle, aloof sensibility-the two components of My Egypt-have been made by literary historians and critics: Dickran Tashjian, Skyscraper Primitives: Dada and the American Avant-Garde, 19I0-I925 (Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 1975), esp. pp. 213-14, and Bram Dijkstra, The Hieroglyphics of a New Speech: Cubism, Stieglitz and the Early Poetry of William Carlos Williams (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1969), esp. pp. 156, 172. For a close comparison between the imagery of De- muth's architectural paintings and Williams's poetry, see James Guimond, The Art of William Carlos Williams: A Discovery and Possession of America (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1969), pp. 48-51.

Breslin, "William Carlos Williams and Charles Demuth: Cross-Fertilization in the Arts," Journal of Modern Languages 6, no. 2 (April 1977): 248-63.

Andrew Ritchie, in the first major mono- graph on the artist, observed that Demuth turned to oil painting and to industrial subject matter around 1920 and thereafter reserved the weighty medium almost exclusively for mechanistic themes.5 In contrast to his decorative flower pieces and studies of colonial architecture, where motifs float upon the indeterminate void of blank paper, the artist systematically took possession of the en- tire working surface in his oils of the late 192os, the largest and most fully resolved of which is My Egypt. Emily Farnham, Demuth's recent biog- rapher, goes on to posit that after 1922 his rapidly failing health necessitated a careful selection of medium. Thus when Demuth chose to undertake large-scale oil paintings, in contrast to watercolors and temperas "which extracted a relatively small toll from his slight reserve of strength," his deci- sion can be taken as a clear mark of the importance of the endeavor.6 The spate of oil compositions of 1927 and 1928, including the poster portraits of Eugene O'Neill and William Carlos Williams, be- came for Farnham poignant "farewell tokens of affection" painfully completed in the shadow of death.7 My Egypt of 1927 assumes fresh meaning in this context: it is painted in oil, it is nearly a yard in height, and it is possessed of a ponderous presence unmatched in Demuth's corpus of work. It is reasonable to infer that the onset of diabet- ic attacks around 1919, the diagnosis of illness in 1920, his confinement in a Morristown, New Jer- sey, sanatorium for insulin treatments in 1922, and the gloomy medical prognostications which haunted him throughout the decade had some bearing on Demuth's new iconographic interests. Furthermore, it was with this new iconographic penchant that Demuth introduced his so-called ironic titles. The halo of smoke wreathing a stand of factory stacks was called Incense of a New Church (1921); a marching file of similar chimneys became End of the Parade (1920); Demuth's hometown grain elevator was dubbed My Egypt.8 While Milton 5Ritchie, Demuth, pp. 14-15.

End of the Parade (1920) is of particular interest because it was owned by William Carlos Williams; it is now in the collection of Mr. and Mrs. Paul H. Williams. Brown dismisses these titular references as "witty postscripts to ... [a] prosaic vision," other com- mentators have detected, in the ironic disparity be- tween his deadpan factory scenes and his enigmat- ic, allusive tag lines, a sardonic attack on the indus- trial pragmatism of the era, a lampoon that may, according to the disposition of the critic, be viewed as indicative of Demuth's dry humor or his aloof dada appreciation for the artistic blague.9 Irony is, by literary definition, an acerbic mode of conceal- ment: apparent and intended significance are re- versed; what might be expected is contrasted with what occurs; words, or in Demuth's case, words and pictures, stand in opposition to their literal meanings.10 Small wonder, then, that in the face of Demuth's ironic machines frustrated exegetes de- spair of arriving at a simple sense of his complex intentions and conclude that Demuth was a kind of cracker-barrel apostate of the Roaring Twenties, a Lost Generation dyspeptic who reduced Marcel Duchamp's savage metairony to the level of the McGuffey reader. There is, of course, ample evidence to support the contention that Demuth's twin interests in in- dustry and irony reflected a sustained relationship with Duchamp, Francis Picabia, and their social circles. Critics Barbara Rose and Bram Dijkstra have shown that a hard-boiled "debunking" trend in American thought, most visibly represented in the 1920S by H. L. Mencken, George Jean Nathan, and Sinclair Lewis, came into focus somewhat ear- lier for the literary and painterly avant-garde of New York and made dada "the first international art movement in which the Americans had a head start."" The movement coalesced around three intersecting salons of which Demuth was a charter 9 Brown, American Painting, p. 111. Whereas historians and critics are unanimous in calling Demuth's titles "ironic," many ignore the very duality and ambiguity upon which irony is premised in their determination to make a given work mean one thing or another. They are particulary inclined to interpret Demuth's phrases as outright condemnations of heartless, dirty industry, or cynical effusions of dada bitterness. Frequently, too, the relationship of Demuth's titles to his images is handled inferentially, if at all. Thus Friedman describes the factory ven- tilators of After All ... (1933, Norton Gallery and School of Art, West Palm Beach, Florida) in a manner which makes the paint- ing sardonic rather than ironic; it depicts "the monstrous ap- purtenances of modern industry pushing the venerable town out of the century" (Precisionist View, p. 25). Similarly, Guimond sees a "dry irony" in Incense of a New Church because it reveals "the absurd difference between the wealth and power of Amer- ican society and its drabness and insensitivity" (Art of William Carlos Williams, p. 51). 10 Tashjian explores the nature of irony as it may apply to Demuth's titles (Skyscraper Primitives, pp. 213-14). 11 Rose, American Art, p. 77. Dijkstra breaks the New York avant-garde into these three groups (Hieroglyphics, p. 22). 27</page><page sequence="4">Winterthur Portfolio Fig. 2. Charles Demuth, The Purple Pup, ca. 1918.

Dijkstra (Hieroglyphics, p. 84) suggests that Williams minimized Stieglitz's role in the dada coven and omitted data about him because of a later quarrel over the price of a work by John Marin. Chapter 26 of Williams's Autobiography (pp. 151-56) draws a telling por- trait of the artist's stylistic maturation during these years by scarcely mentioning Demuth at all. Instead, the essay consists of an extended description of a 1916 party attended by all those who would become central actors in the drama of the dada avant-garde-Arensberg, Williams himself, Duchamp, Picabia, Man Ray, and, one presumes, the Charles Demuth of the title; pp. 151-56. Williams's relevant writings are collated in Dickran Tashjian, ed.,A Recognizable Image: William Carlos Williams on Art and Artists (New York: New Directions Publishing Corp., 1978). At least three Demuth watercolors of the period 1915-20, along with several texts, bear wit- ness to his friendship with Duchamp. The Purple Pup of 1918 (fig. 2), for example, depicts Demuth in the company of a red-nosed Duchamp, sampling the delights of cafe society at the Greenwich Vil- lage bar O'Neill later immortalized in The Iceman Cometh.13 Demuth was the principal American de- 13 See Peter Arms Wick, notes on The Purple Pup, a 1918 watercolor subtitled Cafe Interior: Self-Portrait with Marcel Duchamp, in "Some Recent Acquisitions," Bulletin of the Museum of Fine Arts 60, no. 322 (1962): 15 1, and (;enauer, introduction to Demuth, unpaginated. According to Wick, ca. 1917 and 1919 versions of this cafe interior also exist. That of 1919, entitled At "The Golden Swan" Sometimes Called "Hell Hole," provides a strik- ing portrait of Duchamp. Demuth's friendship with Duchamp, which was particularly warm during the period between the Frenchman's arrival in New York in 1915 and the emergence of the American's ironic style around 1920, is amply documented; for example, see Calvin Tompkins and the Editors of Time-Life Books, The World of Marcel Duchamp (New York: Time-Life Books, 1966), pp. 37-38.

Mutt Fountain (fig. 3) at the Society of In- dependent Artists 1917 show; as late as 1929 De- muth told Steiglitz that Duchamp's "big glass thing [Large Glass] ... is still the great picture of our time."'4 The dada aesthetic constructed in New York by Picabia and Duchamp took shape around an ironic attack on the machine, on the shiny in- dustrial culture that threatened to turn man into a machine, on the fusty traditional outlook that en- couraged artists to divorce their work from the mechanical crisis of the age. The parameters if not the depths of Franco-American dada are easily perceived. Duchamp's assertion that "the only works of art America has given are her plumbing and her bridges" is the premise buttressing the ironic indifference or metairony of his Fountain.15 14 Demuth's letter to critic Henry McBride, demanding a new exhibition for the Fountain, is quoted by Garnett McCoy, "Reaction and Revolution, 1900-193o," Art in America 153, no. 4 (August-September 1965): 81. Demuth to Stieglitz, February 5, 1928, is quoted by Farnham, Demuth, p. 12. 15 Demuth's pithy poem "For Richard Mutt," published in the second issue of the Blind Man, along with a Stieglitz photo- graph of Fountain, supports Duchamp's hyperbolic contention that "the only works of art America has given are her plumbing and her bridges" while anticipating his own developing concept of the possibilities inherent in the ironic mode. According to Demuth, "one must say everything-then no one will know / To know nothing is to say a great deal" (see Blind Man 2, nos. 1-2 [April-May 1917]: 6). Fig. 4. Charles Demuth, Box of Tricks.

The intent of Picabia's Young American Girl in the State of Nudity-a naked spark plug displayed like a cheesecake pinup on the cover of 29I magazine-is equally clear.16 It is just as clear that Demuth's equation of meticulous machine portraiture and the ironic title originated in the ambience of New York dada. Nevertheless, the particular biographi- cal framework in which that equation was forged raises the question of whether Demuthian irony can reasonably be approached through direct analogy to Duchamp's sensibility. Because a sense of a feeling for the character of Demuth's irony is a major stumbling block to the exposition of My Egypt, it is worth examining sev- eral of his early ironic paintings in their own right. A Box of Tricks, a tempera begun in 1919, was the first of Demuth's ironic exercises (fig. 4). The pic- ture, a view from Smith's Cove toward the town of East Gloucester, Massachusetts, abuts two dis- similar and geographically distant structures under a canopy of cubist force lines: in the foreground 16 William Innes Homer, "Picabia's Jeune Fille Americaine dans l'Etat de Nudite and Her Friends," Art Bulletin 58, no. i (March 1975): 110-15. 29</page><page sequence="6">Winterthur Portfolio stands the fish processing shed on the Gorton-Pew wharf, and close behind it looms the steeple of the East Gloucester Church also painted in 1919, in a far more conventional fashion, by Childe Has- sam.17 The composition conflates factory with church so thoroughly that the target of Demuth's supposed animus becomes difficult to locate. Is the boxy factory of today the tricky proposition or the boxy church of yesterday? Dijkstra has hypothesized that the use of fragmented planes in Demuth's industrial works, as well as the con- comitant compression of the focal center, in- variably signal conflicting emotions.18 Both imagis- tic tension and a tense ambiguity of attitude do inform Box of Tricks. That title forcibly knots to- gether three discrete kinds of prestidigitation which express, in turn, three aspects of a temporal continuum: the contemporary magic of the assem- bly line, the colonial magic of meetinghouse reli- gion, and, lurking outside the historical fixity of the objects depicted, the artist-magician who trans- forms visual fact into aesthetic vision.19 Thus De- muth can assume an aesthetic stance external to the contents of his pictorial space. His chosen van- tage point, outside the picture plane, permitted the artist to look back into his own view of American history and to act as a detached, ironic commen- tator on it. This sense of position lays perverse stress on the autobiography of the artist who ap- propriates salient aspects of the national heritage to his own self-definition. Whether Demuth en- dorsed the controlling American dreams or rec- ognized them as fleeting illusions, he still acknowl- edged their bearing on his own value system. Time-personal and historical-and identity- both personal and national-are the wellsprings of Demuth's irony. These tensions, conjoined yet never resolved by the use of irony, were the dominant themes of Demuth's correspondence with Stieglitz during the 1920S. To Stieglitz he divulged irreconcilable de- sires to "feel," as he put it, "'in' America" and to 17 Hassam's painting is reproduced in Portrait of a Place, Some American Landscape Painters in Gloucester.

The factory appears in Joseph E. Garland, The Gloucester Guide: A Retrospective Ramble (Gloucester, Mass.: Gloucester 35oth Anniversary Celebration, 1973), p. 77, fig. 13. The building is certainly not a "steel mill," maintained by Tashjian, Skyscraper Primitives, p. 210. 18 Dijkstra, Hieroglyphics, p. 156. 19 Tashjian also believes that the title Box of Tricks may refer to a magic act performed by the artist (Skyscraper Primitives, p. 210). remain firmly apart from her, in order to shield himself from the national disinterest in the artist's mission. On the one hand, he rejoiced because his poster portrait of William Carlos Williams, I Saw the Figure Five in Gold, "looks almost American," with its cacophony of engines, flashing lights, and billboards. But he also harbored the suspicion that enforced detachment is the fate of the American painter: "America," he lamented, "doesn't really care-still, if one is really an artist and at the same time an American, just the not caring, even though it drives one mad, can be artistic material."20 Since irony could bridge the chasm between his genuine attraction to the visual facts of American life and his genuine disaffection with a culture which sel- dom felt a need for the artist's interpretation of that reality, irony became, in Demuth's lexicon, as American as mom's apple pie. David Gebhard points out that Demuth's irony was particularly irksome to his contemporaries on those occasions when his titles were simultaneously cryptic, literary, and "heavily laden with the cul- tural baggage of the past, immediate or far dis- tant."21 A notable example of this genre is Aucassin et Nicolette (fig. 5). Whereas the picture presents mundane American fact-the water tower and smokestack of the old Lancaster textile mill that became the P. Lorillard tobacco factory-the title is an exotic allusion to a thirteenth-century chante- fable, a picaresque tale of lovers endlessly separated and reunited.22 Tashjian relates the kind of irony which sets up a tension between a visual image de- scriptive of the mechanical world of today and a verbal title descriptive of the romantic values of 20 Demuth to Stieglitz, October lo, 1921, December 12, 1929, and August 15, 1927, Alfred Stieglitz Papers, Beinecke Library, Yale University.

See alsoAucas- sin and Nicolette and Other Mediaeval Romances and Legends, trans. and ed. Eugene Mason (New York: Everyman's Library, 1951), pp. 4-42. The choice of this tobacco factory by Demuth may also have biographical connotations, in that the Demuth family business was tobacco. Herbert S. Levy notes: "It would be hard to conceive of anyone who had deeper roots in the soil of Lan- caster than Charles Demuth. He was born at 109 North Lime Street, this City, on November 3, 1883, of a family which has been part of the community scene continuously since 1736 and which has operated its famous tobacco shop, the oldest in America, since 1770. Charles lived most of his life at 120 East King Street, Lancaster, next to the tobacco shop, [and] created many of his masterpieces in that house" ("Charles Demuth of Lancaster," Journal of the Lancaster County Historical Society 68, no. 2 [1965]: 44). 30</page><page sequence="7">31 Fig. 5.

(Co- lumbus Museum of Art, gift of Fer- dinand Howald.) yesterday to dada and to Duchamp, whose titular irony serves to break down the visual autonomy of the work of art. Moreover, Tashjian detects Picabia's sexual preoccupations in the spectacle of the bulbous tank and the thrusting tower mated in the name of courtly love.23 At best, this analysis makes Aucassin et Nicolette a bon mot, a witty exercise in aesthetic sleight of hand. If this reading is cor- rect, however, the title is a mere throwaway; the picture could just as well have been called Baucis and Philemon, an appellation with perhaps greater ironic potential in that Demuth's towers are not newly minted but yawn together under the weight of their advanced years. And a sardonic simile be- tween factories and metamorphosed trees has the advantage of condemning the contents of the pic- ture more roundly. We are left in the end with Aucassin et Nicolette because that phrase had specific meaning for Demuth. Indeed, the title, by virtue of 23 Tashjian, Skyscraper Primitives, p. 213. a close formal relationship with his observation of the old factory, marks the artist's rediscovery of a personal memory of the old fable. Williams's Autobiography intermingles two sig- nificant events of 1903: one, his first meeting with Demuth "over a dish of prunes at Mrs. Chain's boarding house on Locust Street" in Philadelphia; the other, his discovery of"the wonders of 'Aucas- sin and Nicolette,' the prose and the verse alternat- ing."24 Although poet and painter met often dur- ing the intervening years, Demuth's illness in the early 192os effectively detached him from the New York social scene and renewed a close relationship with Williams, a doctor of medicine. In 1920, for example, Williams quoted Demuth at length in his "Prologue to 'Kora in Hell' "; in the same year De- muth dedicated Machinery (Metropolitan Museum of Art), one of the first independent factory com- positions, to Williams.25 Thus Demuth's confronta- 24 Williams, Autobiography, p. 52. 25 William Carlos Williams, Selected Essays of William Carlos Williams (New York: Random House, 1954), p. 26. My Egypt</page><page sequence="8">Winterthur Portfolio tion with death, framed by the ripening friendship with Williams, partially explains his rationale in calling an American factory scene Aucassin et Nicolette. The poetic narrative makes the pair of ruined towers the locus of reunion.26 Demuth's Lancaster towers can be read as emblematic of his reunion with Williams, the fledgling poet who in- troduced him to the minstrel's lay so long ago. At the same time, the phrase "Aucassin et Nicolette" illuminates a complex relationship between a visual image, rich in historical and personal resonance, and a literary analogue, laden with quite a differ- ent burden of cultural and autobiographical con- notations. It calls attention to the artist as the con- trolling intellect whose memories and powers of observation affect an unlikely, even shocking, par- allel. The full meaning of the simile remains prob- lematic as optical certainty dissolves into the free play of nonvisual associations; Demuth's method is essentially poetic. Demuth's repeated appeals to American per- sonal and literary history and his controlling ten- sion between fact and allusion are not unique in the early 1920S. Multivalent historical allusion and irony also dominate the poetic aesthetic of the period. The twin towers of Aucassin et Nicolette tremble in the same rarified atmosphere of "The Waste Land" (1922), T. S. Eliot's "heap of broken images," a cairn of fragmentary memories where the flowers of April fade and reappear in novel guises beneath evocative phrases culled from The Canterbury Tales, Ecclesiastes, and the Grail Legends.27 Eliot, and Ezra Pound in the "Homage to Sextus Propertius" (1919), employed the weight 26 In Demuth's version of Aucassin et Nicolette, an architec- tural talisman of America's industrial history meets a literary legend of Europe's past with which it shares, in the artist's view, a striking affinity. The romance sung by the thirteenth-century minstrel tells the story of Aucassin, barred by his artistocratic father from marriage to Nicolette, a beautiful girl of unknown parentage, ransomed from the Saracens. The wicked Count de Beaucaire imprisons her in a tower; when she manages to escape, Nicolette is pursued by soldiers of the watch and takes refuge in the shadows of another ruined tower, in which Aucas- sin languishes. Their whispered reunion presages eventual marriage, after countless trials and travels. The death-in-life implications of the towers may have some bearing on the elegiac tone of My Egypt. Octavio Paz, Marcel Duchamp: Appearance Stripped Bare, trans. Rachel Phillips and Donald Gardner (New York: Viking Press, 1978), pp. 64-69, draws an extended anal- ogy between the Large Glass and mythic treatments of the male- female theme. More important here, however, is his discussion of the courtly love tradition and "the amatory code of Provence" in the context of the Large Glass on pp. 156-60. 27 Maynard Mack, Leonard Dean, and William Frost, eds., Modern Poetry, vol. 7, English Masterpieces: An Anthology of Imagi- native Literature from Chaucer to T.

See notes on lines 1, 23, and 24-26 of "The Waste Land." and cadence of historical allusion for ironic ends; a "partial, brutalized present" was exposed through pointed contrast with a lush and resonant past.28 Arturo Schwarz's iconological analysis of the Large Glass discloses an analogous interplay of similes: Duchamp's thwarted marriage of modern ma- chines is an arcane "agricultural machine," a re- statement of the Isis/Osiris myth, wedding Earth and Sky in a rite of castration and regeneration.29 Williams's imagistic verse related irony to identity in a manner closely allied to Demuth's particular sensibility.30 The poem "March" (1920), for in- stance, juxtaposes the humble facts of a New Jersey spring, "a flower or two picked from mud or from among wet leaves," with precise descriptions of masterworks in the history of art, "the pyramids, our pyramids-stript of the polished stone that used to guard them."31 The pyramids, in a derelict state, represent the continual rebirth of human creativity, as Williams's immediate observation of muddy flowers represents the generative force of nature. The poet's creative outburst-the process of writing his tribute to the month of March- occurs at the imaginative point of juncture between and above these two orders of fact. In 1925, with his historical manifesto In the American Grain, Williams rejected simile in favor of precise, realistic description alone: his bifurcated view of the American experience equated allusion with a shopworn, pernicious European outlook- the legacy of Puritanism-whereas American vir- tue resided in home truths.32 The local became the 28 Dijkstra, Hieroglyphics, p. 53. 29 Arturo Schwarz, "The Alchemist Stripped Bare in the Bachelor, Even," in d'Harnoncourt and McShine, Duchamp, p. 90. 30 Breslin ("Williams and Demuth," pp. 250-58) and Guimond (Williams, pp. 42-49) have proved that a significant number of Williams's poems of these years of renewed intimacy are literal transcriptions of Demuth's pictures. Jerome Mazzaro (William Carlos Williams: The Late Poems [Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1973], p. 30) and Dijkstra (Hieroglyphics, p. 53) detect Demuth's influence in the linguistic economy of Spring and All, a 1923 collection of poems dedicated to Demuth. 31 "March," in William Carlos Williams, The Complete Poems of William Carlos Williams, I906-I938 (Norfolk, Conn.: New Di- rections Publishing Corp., 1938), pp. 299-303. According to an undated letter to Williams from Hilda Doolittle, assistant editor of the Egoist, cited in the "Prologue to 'Kora in Hell' " (1920), "March" was written in 1916 and was presumably revised before 1920. 32 Tashjian (Skyscraper Primitives, p. 113) discusses In the American Grain as an "affirmative culmination of his Dada pre- occupations which railed against America's cultural orientation toward Europe." In the context of American art, Williams's most forceful statement of this position appears in "The Ameri- can Background," an obliquely eulogistic essay on Stieglitz first published in Waldo Frank et al., eds., America and Alfred Stieglitz (New York: Literary Guild, 1932), pp. 9-32, and reprinted in Williams, Selected Essays, pp. 134 ff. 32</page><page sequence="9">My Egypt matrix of the universal. Demuth's painterly style anticipated Williams's insistence on the American implications of precise description. Despite De- muth's cubism, his eye was that of a nineteenth- century luminist; his fastidious literalism harkened back to the chaste linear style of early self-taught painters.33 Style established a temporal continuity between the old and the new America; it reunited Demuth with "the orderly colonial architecture which filled the landscape" of his Lancaster child- hood.34 Demuth's Lancaster grain elevator, My Egypt, was a culminating reprise of themes, methods, and relationships pieced together in a biographical con- text haunted by the shadow of death. The history of My Egypt-a history comprised of the earlier fac- tories, of Duchampian machines which conflate Egyptian mythology with modern technology, of Williams's pyramids of personal regeneration-can be known with some degree of certainty. Butjust as surely My Egypt must be seen and received. De- muth's art is not history nor is his poetry analytic prose. There is no forgotten scrap of documenta- tion or verse that will cleanly solve the cabalistic mysteries of the picture; the picture must be that text. The most striking feature of the painting is the monumentality of the central structure. That pictorial quality and the huge silos, reassessed in the light of the title, conjure up visions of the elephantine columns of Luxor or Karnak. Yet the triangular patterns of the diagonal force lines, the subtle but insistent angles of the shed roofs, and the isolation of the image against the piercing clar- ity of the sky all locate the primary analogue at the Great Pyramid of Egypt, the primordial funerary monument of the Western world. The painting is constructed of pyramidal forms. The pyramid/ elevator was Demuth's memorial to himself. It was truly, then, his Egypt, a personal emblem of death constructed in terms of the American monument which dominates the skyline of Lancaster.35 33 Davidson, "Cubism and the Early Modernist," p. 129. 34 Sam Hunter, Modern American Painting and Sculpture (New York: Dell Publishing Co., 1959), pp. 99-104. Baigell makes the interesting related observation that "like the hero of Edith Wharton's Hudson River Bracketed (1928), who found in an old house on the river an embodiment of the past, Demuth found his images within the context of an American history made both instant and prematurely aged" (History of American Painting, p. 220). 35 Robert B. Riley ("Grain Elevators: Symbols of Time, Place and Honest Building," AIA Journal 66, no. 13 [November 1977]: 50) explores a number of the symbolic connotations of such structures in history, including Lewis Mumford's interpretation of"the royal granary as a symbol of urbanization in the ancient Orient." The pyramid, however, is as multivalent in its implications as an ironic picture by Demuth. Rudolf Wittkower's essay on eighteenth-century Egyptomania traces Etienne-Louis Boullee's bizarre architectural imagery back to trecento Ital- ian tombs which used the pyramid as a symbol of immortality.36 The historical, supramortal endur- ance of the Egyptian monument had special rel- evance, given Demuth's practice of merging his persona with American history. The sleek primary forms of the Eshelman elevator were, in terms of the mechanics of vertical grain storage, the epitome of contemporary technology, crowning bleak remnants of ancient brick and timber "flathouses" and compressing them to the very margins of existence within the scene.37 Begun in 9199 on the foundations of a waterpowered gristmill that predates 1842 (fig. 6), their concrete columns are, in terms of local antiquity, towering monuments to evolutionary continuity. Yet the finality of these cool, pristinely modern shapes dic- tates that the Pennsylvania elevator would outlast Demuth. The artist's choice of the word "my" iron- ically yoked together two parallel historical sys- tems. That ironic tension was reconciled in De- muth's fragile existence in a modern present, but, paradoxically, because Demuth's identity was coex- tensive with his artistic irony, My Egypt-as artifact and idea-ensured his immortality. In effect, De- 36 Rudolf Wittkower, Studies in the Italian Baroque (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1975), p. 260 and figs. 338-39. 37 Riley ("Grain Elevators," pp. 50, 52) distinguishes be- tween the visual characteristics of vertical and horizontal stor- age systems and traces the development of the cylindrical con- crete elevator. The earliest known example was built in 19oo on the outskirts of Minneapolis, and the technique had seeped back toward the East by World War I, aided by more favorable insurance rates for concrete structures. Although concrete was adopted first by large terminal elevators and "only replaced wood construction in small country elevators" gradually, the Eshelman plant was clearly "new" in the Lancaster of the 1920S. I am grateful to John Ward Willson Loose, president of the Lancaster County Historical Society, for a thorough investiga- tion of the construction history of the Eshelman plant, which highlights two important facts: first, the elevator of My Egypt was a new, aggressively modern element on the Lancaster skyline when Demuth sketched it; second, the silos were, as the painting suggests, additions to older, existing facilities on the site. According to Loose, "The Eshelman mill originally was a regular water-powered grist mill . . . [and] the Eshelman pro- prietorship began in 1842. In 1907 they built a large mill and elevator, all of which was destroyed by fire in 1910. A larger facility was built at once, and in 1917 the firm was incorporated. In 1919J. W. E. &amp; Sons built an even larger mill in addition to the 19 1 facility, and at this time the silos were built." He specu- lates that the older structure visible at the lower edges of My Egypt may be "very old buildings located along West Walnut Street, north of the silos" and the 1911 plant, incorporating "much of the salvageable portion of the fire-damaged 1907 structure" (Loose to author, October 11,1978). 33</page><page sequence="10">Winterthur Portfolio Fig. 6.

"What do you look forward to?" asked a reporter in 1929. "The past," Demuth replied.38 But the most compelling reason for placing the ironic focus at the point of intersection between Lancaster and Giza is the tradition which holds that the pyramids were grain elevators, not tombs. Ac- cording to classicist I. E. S. Edwards, the legend predates the fifth century, when Julius Honarius quoted an older text to prove that the pyramids were Joseph's granaries, where corn was stored during the seven years of plenty. Although Arab scholars of the ninth century dismissed the story, it turned up again in the chronicles of the Baron d'Anglure in 1395 and is reflected in the mosaic decoration of a dome in the church of San Marco in Venice.39 The Hertel edition (1758-60) of Ripa's Iconologia revived the trope: thefatto storico sagro, or 38 Charles Demuth, "Confessions," Little Review 12, no. 2 (May 1929): 30. 39 I.

Demuth need not have pored over the pages of Ripa, of course, however much his ironic disparity between image and import in- vokes the arcana of the eighteenth century. Duchamp, who abandoned work on the Large Glass (fig. 7) in 1923, was engaged in his own specula- 40 Edward A.

The Hertel Ripa is a rich source of pyramid lore: Contention is illustrated by Romulus standing before a pyramid which pre- sages his future glory as sole ruler of Rome; Smell makes the pyramid of Bellus an omen of a life which will end calamitously; Greed warns Darius that shame awaits those who pry too deeply into the mysteries of the pyramids; see pls. 158, 114, 115. 34</page><page sequence="11">My Egypt 35</page><page sequence="12">Winterthur Portfolio tions on the Egyptian pyramid motif and was a living index to the emblematic tradition. It is suggestive that the Glass was first exhibited publicly in 1926-27, and within months Demuth began work on his largest and most carefully conceived industrial canvas.4' Whatever the source, Demuth's knowledge of the silo/pyramid conceit is confirmed by the painting no less than by the necromantic title. If irony allowed Demuth to externalize his deepest feelings under the protective armor of ur- bane wit, then irony served him well. His con- temporaries treated the picture as a specimen of brittle humor, not a nostalgic cri de coeur.42 But this misinterpretation is a tribute to the success of De- muth's deliberate effort to lay a false trail. On one level, My Egypt is a joking commentary on topics as timely to the 1920S as the morning paper. By 1927, the smoldering kitsch of Theda Bara's Cleopatra and the rotogravure extravaganza of mummies' curses that greeted Howard Carter's discovery of Tutankhamen's tomb in 1922 had flowered in the precious boudoir accessories, mantel clocks, and cigarette cases of art deco. Egyptomania was as up to date as the lotus-strewn advertisement for filter- tipped Murads.43 Le Corbusier prefaced Towards a New Architecture of 1923 with eight glossy photo- graphs of American grain elevators which the au- thor likened to the primal forms of Egypt-the pyramids and the temple at Luxor: "The American grain elevators and factories," are "the magnificent First Fruits of the New Age. The American En- gineers overwhelm with their calculations our ex- piring architecture."44 The sophisticated viewer of 41 d'Harnoncourt and McShine (Duchamp, p. 296) list the Grand Verre as Cat.

Barbara Rose, "The Politics of Art, Part II," Artforum 7, no. 5 (January 1969): 44-45, also equates the irony in Demuth's My Egypt with the "witty and whimsical title." 43 The Egyptomania of the period is amply discussed in Bevis Hillier, The World of Art Deco (New York: E. P. Dutton, 1971), pp. 33 ff. Bara's Cleopatra was made in 1917, but the vamp/biblical/mid-Eastern epic enjoyed even greater popularity in the 1920S; see Marjorie Rosen, Popcorn Venus (New York: Avon Books, 1973), pp. 98-120. 44 Le Corbusier, Towards a New Architecture, trans. Frederich Etchells (New York: Praeger Publishers 1927), pp. 27-33. Prof. Robert L. Alexander of the University of Iowa has kindly called my attention to the fact that Wilhelm Worringer's influential Egyptian Art also makes explicit photographic comparisons be- tween American grain elevators and ancient Egyptian architec- ture. Although the first English edition is dated 1928, Alexander suggests that it is still possible that up-to-date New York circles, and especially those interested in Egyptian mat- ters, might have known Worringer's text earlier, in the original German. 1927 can be forgiven for chortling over Demuth's lighthearted reference to American technological genius or to the crass commercialism that machine-tools Egyptian art for the delectation of the pharaohs of Woolworth's: under the heading of irony, either or both conclusions are appropri- ate. They are the Janus-faces of America described in Williams's In the American Grain. There is one contemporary analogue to My Egypt that may have a direct and meaningful bear- ing on Demuth's picture. The sketches for My Egypt (fig. 8) and the photograph of the site pub- lished by Faison demonstrate that the artist altered the spatial components of perceived reality in sev- eral radical ways. He panned in on the structure, for instance, and by so doing blocked the horizon line.45 Thus the elevator, pictorially, became a self-sufficient barrier between the observer and the landscape. The grain elevator as the point of de- marcation between cosmos and chaos-between the land and the urban scene, between the agrarian past and the industrial present-is also an image which haunts the American novel of the 1920s. It was an era of historical and fictional reclamation of a national identity.46 Sinclair Lewis's Main Street, serialized between 1919 and 1920, hinged on the symbolic status of the Gopher Prairie silo, a metaphor for the existential dilemma of Carol Kennicott and, by extension, for that of the Ameri- can nation. On one side of the local Lyman Cass wheat elevator lies the prairie-indifferent, vast, and pregnant with its own history: "[Carol] looked across the silent fields to the west. She was con- scious of an unbroken sweep of land to the Rock- ies, . . . a dominion which will rise to unexampled greatness when other empires have grown senile. Before that time, she knew, a hundred generations of Carols will aspire and go down in tragedy devoid of palls and solemn chanting, the humdrum inevitable tragedy of struggle against inertia." On the other side of the elevator lies the mechanized world of "cheap motor cars, telephones, ready- made clothes . . . kodaks, phonographs . . . bridge-prizes, oil-stocks [and] motion pictures."47 My Egypt confronts the tragedy of an American 45 See Faison, "Fact and Art," p. 127, fig. 1 1. The double pencil sketch was formerly in the collection of Robert E.

The drama played out against the enigma of the American landscape is as timeless as the pyramids and as transitory as the flash of ironic wit. Lewis Mumford drew a similar distinction be- tween the agrarian and the technological realms in 1923. The countryside, he mused, might soon "re- turn to the old gods of handicraft, while the city becomes more rigidly and emphatically mechan- ical." What touched off Mumford's train of thought was a recent unspecified book published in Berlin which juxtaposed art with engineering, as Le Corbusier was doing: "[Side] by side with these paintings and sculptures there are photographs of grain elevators, automobiles and office buildings which exemplify the peculiar felicities of machine-work.... Who doubts that a great part of the success of these new buildings is due to the fact that the designer did not attempt to model his grain elevator after an Egyptian temple?"48 While the old gods and the new vied for homage at his Lancaster temple, Demuth telescoped, and so ne- 48 Lewis Mumford, "Beauty and the Industrial Beast," New Republic 35, no. 444 (June 6, 1923): 38. gated, time by laying claim instead to a place in the American landscape. The timeless appeal of Demuth's image is, at least in part, a function of the status of the grain elevator as an American place marker, albeit pin- ning down by its primal thrust a trackless prairie landscape at some geographic remove from east- ern Pennsylvania. Technological historian Robert Riley notes that "generations of painters and pho- tographers and novelists have found [the elevators] ... symbols of life on the Great Plains."49 In a curi- ous way, Demuth's obsessive concern with building an impenetrable industrial wall that blocks the viewer's movement toward the spacious vista im- plied by the azure sky-the daytime source of the nighttime searchlight beams that bring the silos into heightened prominence, and the redemptive agent that bleaches the arching trail of factory soot-provokes interest in what cannot be seen. The haunting, palpable presence of a vast out- 49 Riley, "Grain Elevators," p. 5o.

Thus Demuth's towering silo marks the point at which My Egypt crosses the frontier dividing personal symbol from compelling national myth, Lancaster from the eternal American West. Whether "going west" signaled the journey to that final Elysium on the other side of the Gates of Hercules, to Ponce de Leon's fountain of rebirth, or to Thoreau's "terrestrial paradise [which is] ... the preservation of the World," the magnetism of the virgin land always just beyond the edges of settled existence has exerted a constant, dominant pull upon the American imagination.50 The pro- tean connotations of the West, in their very lack of uniform definition, afford suggestive possibilities for an elegiac reading of a painting premised on ironic tensions and ambiguities. When Henry Nash Smith challenged the efficacy of the American ro- mance of the West, arguing that "a system which revolved about a half-mystical conception of na- ture ... was powerless to confront issues arising from the advance of technology," he, like Demuth, used the modern symbolism of industrial progress to undercut the venerable myth of an agrarian Eden.51 My Egypt, too, poises the reality of the ma- chine against the myth of the garden, a hortus con- clusus of the spirit.52 Of particular importance for Demuth's My Egypt is the fact that the Eden of the American frontier has served as a kind of substitute for the cultural surety afforded by ancient national his- 50 Henry David Thoreau, "Walking," in The Writings of Henry David Thoreau, vol. 9 (Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1893), pp. 266-67. Strong analogical support for the idea that the Eshelman elevator is a vehicle of movement through vast space, over time, comes from two dominant elements within the painting: the funnel-like shapes of the silos, which are the only firmly three-dimensional forms in My Egypt, and the row of four gaping vents surmounting the structure. These forms not only suggest but duplicate contemporary treatments of the ocean liner by American cubo-realists. For example, see Charles Sheeler's photograph, The Funnel (1927, William H. Lane Collection), reproduced in Tashjian, A Recognizable Image, p. 79, fig. 45, an image which, with My Egypt, stands behind the exhaust vents of Sheeler's famed Upper Deck (1929, Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University). The same iconographic and formal vocabulary dominates Gerald Murphy's The Liner (1924), a lost painting reproduced at the time in both L'Espirit nouveau and the Bulletin de l'effort moderne; see John Willet, Art and Politzcs in the Weimar Period: The New Sobriety, 19I7-I933 (New York: Pantheon Books, 1978), p. 1 14. 51 Smith, Virgin Land, p. 259. See also Roderick Nash, Wil- derness and the American Mind (rev. ed.; New Haven: Yale Uni- versity Press, 1973). 52 This is the theme explored by Leo Marx, The Machine in the Garden: Technology and the Pastoral Ideal in American (New York: Oxford University Press, 1964). tory. Literary historians Frank Bergon and Zeese Papanikolas see the West in this light, as an ongo- ing alternative to historical tradition: "The country had no past, but it did have a West, a faraway, romantic place that could serve as a basis for myth. And the West did become an epic, an epic that did not exist in one poem or several, or in one histori- cal moment or another, but in a consciousness and a yonder."53 In Demuth's historical moment, the American myth attained the status of epic tragedy in F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925). Fur- thermore, Fitzgerald's imagistic focus on the cruel modernity of the present, his contempt for a mechanistic civilization that repudiates both tradi- tion and history, and his method of contrasting the vulgar reality of West Egg with the mythic values of a rhetorically conceived frontier parallel the com- ponents of Demuth's tragic statement with un- canny accuracy.54 Fitzgerald's ideographs of the modern 1920S- the monstrous eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg, Gatsby's shirts, the Washington Heights flat with "the de- spairing figure on the couch, bleeding fluently, and trying to spread a copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes of Versailles"-like Demuth's, be- tray the ironic influence of Eliot and his snatches of Jazz Age slang.55 Yet behind those symbols of a "new world, material without being real," of "a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty," lurked Gatsby's hidden western past and the portent of an orgiastic future, a fountain of youth, and dreams- come-true which will redeem the promise of the frontier: "'Can't repeat the past?' [Gatsby] cried incredulously. 'Why, of course you can!' "56 The dreams of this modern Ponce de Leon sour when his boundless imagination can feed only upon the tawdry artifacts of the industrial present. Gatsby must die when the illusion of the frontier myth comes full circle to expire upon the suburban Long Island shoreline where it began. Nevertheless, in the lyrical rhapsody which ends the novel, Fitzgerald pays tribute to the beauty and magic of the American dream of the redemptive out-there: 53 Frank Bergon and Zeese Papanikolas, eds., introduction to Looking Far West: The Search for the American West in History, Myth, and Literature (New York: New American Library, 1978), p. 8. 54 Edwin Fussell, "Fitzgerald's Brave New World," in The Great Gatsby: A Study, ed.

Its van- ished trees . . . had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory en- chanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something com- mensurate to his capacity for wonder.57 Demuth took greater pains to mask "his sense of loss by comparing the grain elevators with the pyramids of antiquity, . . . titling them My Egypt," but the sheer immensity of the historical pressures held in tenuous check by the ironic grimace of his ideograph shrouds a romanticism as epic as Fitzgerald's.58 Beyond the inessential towers of Lancaster, the fresh green myth of a temporal and spiritual yonder glimmers and beckons. In My Egypt, America's "not caring" became "artistic ma- terial" insofar as ironic indifference to the tangible artifacts of modernity exposed the power of the intangible, timeless dream. Demuth's audience, like Fitzgerald's pioneer, is "compelled into an aesthetic contemplation" of the golden illusion of the way west.59 In his analysis of the Puritan imagination, his- torian Sacvan Bercovitch detects a similar creative dualism-"the eschatological anthropomorphism of allegory-become-symbol"-which accounts for thematic consistencies in American thought from Walt Whitman through Herman Melville and Wil- liam Faulkner.60 Bercovitch argues that combining the scriptural allegory of deliverance with the his- torical fact of their harrowing journey to the west- ern wilderness allowed the New England Puritans to elevate the secular landscape of the New World, and the lives of the "saints" who lived there, into the realm of redemptive history, and thus set the stage for the remarkable flowering of the Ameri- can dream. Two aspects of this transformative pro- cess have unique relevance for Demuth's inter- pretation of that national dream in My Egypt. First, the historical specificity with which the Puritan mind understood the biblical quest for salvation encouraged them "to fuse in one configuration the telos of the saint, the theocracy, and the country at 57Gatsby, p. 238. 58 Rose, American Art, p. 90. 59 See note 20 above, and Gatsby, p. 238. 60 Sacvan Bercovitch, ed., The American Puritan Imagination: Essays in Revaluation (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1974), pp. 13, 15. This argument is developed in Sacvan Ber- covitch, The Puritan Origins of the American Self (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1975), esp. chap. 5, pp. 187 ff. large.""6 Demuth's conflation of the private and the public-the personal and the national-is spec- ified not only by the possessive of his title but also by his chosen imagery, at once local and autobio- graphical, broadly symbolic, and almost cosmically inclusive. A new Moses, Demuth is bent on de- liverance from an Egypt of the historical present and is bound for the spiritual Canaan awaiting the American pilgrim in the mythic yonder. Second, Puritan natural theology "turns on a unique na- tional locale-a 'wilderness,' a 'city,' a ripening 'garden of God' qualitatively different from all other plots of ground in a fallen world. Or rather, a discovery, not an interpretation, of the locale; for the colonists held that the significance was there from eternity, inscribed in prophecy and promise, like the figural landscape of Pilgrim's Progress."62 Demuth's title forces consideration of the ways in which his figural landscape-home place, indus- trial city, expansive wilderness, pastoral garden of ripening grain-is unlike the tradition-laden Old World realm he invokes. The shock waves of dis- junction generated by irony underscore Demuth's own discovery of the spiritual promise latent in the scene he surveys. Demuth, to be sure, is not a Puritan divine, de- spite his asperity of style. Nor is he a faithful com- mentator on those aspects of the myth represented by the fictional lives of Carol Kennicott and Jay Gatsby. But Demuth is, perhaps, our greatest painterly prophet of the great American dream of the redemptive quest westward, an artistic pilgrim in search of the Terra Bimene of eternal regenera- tion. That Demuth saw the creative act in terms of an ineffable quest, moving from the perimeters of knowledge past the frontiers of the unknown, is demonstrated by his own brief statement on the comprehension of art, published in 1929: "Across the final surface-the touchable bloom-if it were a peach-of any fine painting is written for those who dare to read that which the painter knew, that which he hoped to find out, that which he- whatever!"63 Demuth's tantalizing "whatever" is the insoluble mystery of My Egypt. 61 Bercovitch, American Puritan Imagination, p. 13. 62 Bercovitch, American Puritan Imagination, pp. 13-14. It is worth noting that Hunter attempts to explain My Egypt by ref- erence to what he calls an undercurrent of "puritanical re- straint" in the painter's artistic personality: "One feels that De- muth was not so much concerned to spiritualize matter, in the sense of the motif-a grain elevator-or the pigment itself, as he was to dematerialize it, to reduce everything to its minimal expressive equivalent in art" (Modern American Painting, pp. 99-103). 63 Charles Demuth, "Across a Greco Is Written," from Cre- ative Art (September 1929), quoted in Sidney Janis, Abstract and Surrealist Art in America (New York: Reynal &amp; Hitchcock, 1944), P- 37. 39</page></plain_text>
