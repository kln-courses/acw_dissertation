Price summary: Recent analysis of the imperial cult has argued that it can be best understood in terms of the lack of a fundamental division between gods and humans at Rome: worshiping a human as a god was accordingly not a trans- gressée act. This paper challenges this interpretation, demonstrating that gods and humans were indeed usually conceived as separate species of being. The imperial cult was thus transgressive in theory; however, it primarily operated in contexts where that could be overlooked and the worship of humans as gods accordingly appeared unproblematic. 1. THE PROBLEM THE MOST IMPORTANT BOOK ON THE ROMAN IMPERIAL CULT IN THE LAST decade or more is certainly Ittai Gradeis Emperor Worship and Roman Religion. In a superb and wide-ranging study, Gradei gives persuasive and impressive accounts of a variety of issues relating to the cult, including the worship of the emperor s genius and of the Numen Augustum , and the important dis- tinctions to be made between state worship, municipal worship, and private worship: this enables him to clarify much that had puzzled earlier scholars or had been misunderstood by them. * Versions of the ideas developed in this paper were first delivered as a lecture at the Triennial Meeting of the Hellenic and Roman Societies in Cambridge; they were subsequently explored before audiences at Columbia University, Princeton University, Dartmouth College, Oxford University, and Yale University. I am grateful for the comments I have received on those occasions. I should also like to thank those who have commented on drafts of the paper: Michael Peachin, Tony Woodman, TAPA's anonymous referees, and above all the late Simon Price.

Levene One major aspect of Gradel's model, however, deserves more detailed consideration than it has so far received. Gradei claims that many of the conceptual problems that people have seen in the imperial cult can be shown not to be problems at all, once one appreciates that the Romans' conception of gods was far removed from our own.1 According to Gradei, gods were not seen by the Romans as being of a different "species" from humans2; divinity was not an absolute category, but a relative category, reflecting the status of the individual worshiped relative to the worshiper. Hence any model of the imperial cult which sees it as potentially transgressive, or as needing to smooth over the problem of a person occupying two distinct conceptual categories, is simply mistaken, the product of a Jewish/Christian-influenced reading of gods and humans as fundamentally distinct. On Gradeis model, to worship a living human as a god at Rome was not conceptually problematic in any way: gods and humans were distinguished by status but not by kind. Objections by Romans to worshiping emperors (or other living humans) as gods reflected not a sense that treating humans as divine was illegitimate in principle, but rather that this particular human did not deserve so exalted a status, or did not deserve to have it officially recognized within the state cult.3 Gradei was not the first to postulate such a reading of the imperial cult as based on the 1 This of course assumes that it is legitimate to discuss Roman religion in terms of "the Romans' conception of gods" at all. Such belief-centred accounts of Roman religion became unfashionable for a time among scholars: see in particular Price 1980: 42-43; Price 1984a: 7-11; Phillips 1986, esp. 2697-711, for the argument that Roman religion should be analyzed in terms of its functional role rather than through the mentality of its practitioners. This scholarly movement was an important corrective to earlier readings which appeared to rest on the tacit Christianizing assumptions that dogmatic belief was the defining feature of religion, and that Roman religious practice, which manifestly did not rest on such dogmatic belief, was accordingly an empty shell. However, as various more recent scholars have argued, the wiping out of mentality went too far: for while "belief" was not the primary criterion by which the Romans assessed the correctness or otherwise of religious behavior, Roman writings on religion, as on other topics, constantly present, explicitly or implicitly, accounts of the conceptual assumptions underlying religious prac- tices and religious narratives, and indeed it is often hard to make sense of those practices and narratives without taking into account the underlying assumptions. See, e.g., Linder and Scheid 1993; Feeney 1998: 12-46; Bendlin 2000; King 2003. 2 Gradei 2002, esp. 25-32, 71-72, 101-3, 321-36, 349-56. The zoological language, and in particular the word "species", whose implications I shall be discussing at some length below, are Gradel's own (2002: 26). 3 See, e.g., Gradei 2002: 146-49 for an analysis of the hostile reactions of Roman writers to Caligula's imitations of Olympian gods.</page><page sequence="3">Defining the Divine in Rome 43 fundamental unity of the divine and the human, but he has followed it through far more systematically than any earlier scholar had done.4 The issue may be more easily understood by providing some parallels (these parallels are my own, not Gradeis, but I think that they represent his argument fairly). If one takes the paired concepts "ruler" and "subject," these in various contexts may be treated as antithetical. But if a "subject" becomes a "ruler," we would not regard it as transgressive, or feel that some major conceptual boundary has been breached. We might argue that certain of such moves from "subject" to "ruler" were illegitimate, either because proper procedures were not followed, or because this particular "subject" was too lowly a person to deserve to become a "ruler." But those would be objections to specific instances, and would not suggest any broader conceptual problems with the change from one status to the other. We may contrast (for example) the dichotomy male/female. Here, it is certainly possible that in particular instances a person may move from one status to the other: it is not uncommon nowadays for this to be accomplished via surgical and other medical procedures, and even in Roman times people were believed to have changed sex.5 But there is little doubt that such transformations were perceived at Rome as transgressing a natural boundary, and most people would take a similar view today, even though it is more widely accepted in the modern West that the male/female boundary is as much a conventional as a biological distinction. So the question about the divine/human boundary at Rome is whether it is closely analogous to a status distinction like ruler/subject (as Gradei argues), or whether (as was usually assumed in the past) it is better understood as a fundamental natural distinction, as male/female was seen to be, even if the boundary (as also the male/female boundary) was a permeable one. The ob- ject of this paper is to argue the latter: that, contrary to what Gradei claims, divine and human were regularly seen at Rome6 as being of different "species." 4GradeFs position was prefigured by Nock 1928: 30-33 = Nock 1972: 144-47; see also Toynbee 1947, esp. 126: "To the Greeks and Romans, men and gods were not on two completely separate and differentiated levels ... They occupied either end, as it were, of a single sliding scale"; also Clauss 1999: 30-31: "Gottheiten sind unsterbliche Menschen. Menschen sind demnach sterbliche Gottheiten, was sagen will, daß die Grenze zwischen beiden durchaus überschreitbar war." 5 See, e.g., Plin. HN 7.36: ex feminis mutari in mares non estfabulosum ("transforma- tions from women into men are not mythical"), offering various examples, including one to which he was an eye-witness; cf. also Gell. 9.4.14-15. 6 1 shall in this paper draw mainly on Latin texts for my evidence, with Greek evidence cited only occasionally and for comparative purposes. This is not because Roman reli- gious thought existed in a vacuum separate from Greek: the two formed part of a single</page><page sequence="4">44 D. S. Levene Gradel's argument has not been universally accepted,7 but a proper answer to him has not so far been provided. Before I begin, I should raise one immediate problem with Gradeis posi- tion. Gradei does in fact acknowledge that many Roman literary texts assume a boundary between the divine and the human not unlike that postulated by Judaism or Christianity: the most familiar is Cicero's De natura deorum , but many other examples could be given too. However, Gradel's claim is that these are not representative of Roman conceptions of the divine, since they are philosophical texts, and while he does also admit that, in the high Empire and later, philosophical concepts gradually became more mainstream (and the influence of Christianity also began to make a difference), the worship of humans in the later Republic, and its development into the imperial cult in the late 1st century b.c.e. and 1st century c.e., was not, he claims, affected by this.8 However, this argument seems to require that we make a more rigorous division between philosophical and non-philosophical ideas in the Roman world than is ever warranted. While it should never be claimed that one can uncomplicatedly equate philosophical ideas with everyday ones, philosophy, no less than other genres of ancient writing, was necessarily developed in the context of the conceptual frameworks familiar to the wider society.9 The very least that can be said is that philosophical arguments have to be so framed as to make sense to their chief contemporary audiences, and in fact the influences are often far closer even than that; certainly any distinctions one would wish to make between philosophical and popular conceptions should be carefully complex (cf. Feeney 1998: 47-75; Graf 2003), as is apparent not only in the well-known Roman religious borrowings from Greece, but no less when Greek writers under the Ro- man empire wrote about religious phenomena which were either distinctively Roman or were shared between Greeks and Romans alike. Nevertheless, differences remained, some of which I shall mention below. Moreover, the language of godhood in Greek and Latin was significantly different in ways which appear to have a bearing on the nature of the contrast between divine and human: see Price 1984b. Hence we cannot safely employ Greek texts as evidence for Roman thought in this area, unless we have prior reason to think that the two are identical in the particular respects under consideration. 7 His position has been accepted by (e.g.) Gordon and Reynolds 2003: 261; also cf. the review of the book by Stevenson 2003. However, many of the books reviewers remained skeptical, including Scheid 2004: 244; Herz 2005: 642; Wheeler 2003: 3-4; Wardle 2004. 8 Gradei 2002: 30-31, 266-68, 328-30, 333-34, 350-69. 9 See, e.g., Beard 1986 for the way in which the inconclusive debates of Cicero's De natura deorum and De divinatione dramatize contentious and unresolved points in con- temporary understandings of the gods.</page><page sequence="5">Defining the Divine in Rome 45 circumscribed, and not simply assumed. Indeed, Gradei himself, in order to maintain his position, is compelled to extend "philosophy" well beyond the limits one would usually assume, adding to philosophical texts per se those "with a distinct philosophical flavour."10 As an example of the latter he of- fers Horace, Carm. 3.5.1-4, but it is frankly hard to imagine a non-circular definition of "philosophical flavor" that would attribute it to those lines of Horace, which have no unambiguously philosophical language or conceptual apparatus.11 We should not, as I said, assume that philosophical and non-philosophical concepts are identical either; and thus in this paper I, like Gradei, shall largely eschew philosophical texts for my primary evidence. But the fact that an abso- lute boundary between human and divine is assumed in ancient philosophy at least demonstrates that postulating a similar boundary between human and divine in other areas of ancient ideology is not anachronistic, even if it may be mistaken, and if we were in fact to find it mirrored elsewhere it would not be particularly surprising. Indeed, the challenge for Gradei might appear to be the greater one: to explain how the notion of an absolute division appeared so readily and so widely in different philosophical schools if it did not form a standard part of the Roman thought-world. 2. NATURAL KINDS The first issue that we need to consider is what exactly it would mean to have such a boundary, and how exactly it would be identified. It is uncontroversial that men and gods, in Roman eyes, shared many, perhaps most, qualities: almost all gods were conceived as anthropomorphic, and were generally pre- sumed to think and act in ways not unlike the ways that humans do; there are also, however, certain qualities, notably immortality, which were assumed to belong to the realm of gods rather than humans (I shall discuss this point in more detail below). But these facts by themselves entail neither the presence nor the absence of a boundary, any more than the shared possession or lack of shared possession of particular qualities do in any other context. Creatures that are conceived as part of the same group commonly share some quali- ties but not all (for example, people commonly differ in hair-color, but few would deny that people of different hair-color are all human). Groupings may 10 Gradei 2002: 333 with nl 14. 11 On the language of those lines of Horace, and on the word credidimus in particular, which might mistakenly be thought to reflect a skeptical attitude by Horace to belief in Jupiter's rule, see Nisbet and Rudd 2004: 82-83.</page><page sequence="6">46 D. S. Levette also be hierarchically nested, such that members of a group may be divided into different sub-groups, whose members may or may not themselves share particular qualities, and the identification of two beings as members of dif- ferent sub-groups is perfectly compatible with both of them being members of a single broad group; and in such cases the sub-groups may themselves be firmly divided from one another, or it may be possible to move between them. Hence we cannot determine the way in which the Romans conceptualized the distinction between gods and men without a wider consideration of the way in which they categorized the world in general. Did they, for example, actually think that the natural world was made up of creatures of different "species," with more or less unbreachable boundaries between them? And if so, what qualified a creature for membership of one or another group? Our own concept of "species" is nowadays broadly a scientific one, as- sociated with evolutionary theory; but the basic idea long predates the rise of modern zoology and botany, and there are strong a priori reasons for sus- pecting that the division of the natural world into "species" is a fundamental human way of viewing the world. All known societies appear to share the perception that the world consists of broadly discontinuous "natural kinds," each reproducing "after its kind" (to use the biblical phrase),12 and sharing a bundle of features with other members of its "kind."13 This does not, of course, mean that the set of particular "kinds" within each society maps closely onto a modern scientist's account of biological "species." Only members of a society which paid close attention to the precise distinctions between populations of tropical fish would share the evolutionary scientist's understanding that there are more than 700 species of cichlids in Lake Malawi (and almost as many more in the neighboring Lakes Victoria and Tanganyika)14; for other societies cichlids might well be assumed to be a single "kind." Conversely, members of certain societies may divide groups of creatures into separate "kinds" where the zoologists would prefer to see sub-groups within a single species.15 For 12 Genesis 1:11-12,21,24-25. 13 For the general point see Atran 1990: 17, 28; also Atran 1998, which includes various critiques of the author's position along with his responses. "Bundle of features" in this case does not merely mean morphological features, but includes the role the animal plays in its natural environment: Atran 1990: 29 speaks of "an ecological distinction that marks a morpho-geographical gap in the readily perceptible local economy of nature." For the specifics of how this operates in a traditional society, note the important research of Ralph Bulmer and his various collaborators among the Karam of New Guinea: esp. Bulmer and Tyler 1968; Bulmer and Menzies 1972; Bulmer and Menzies 1973. 14 The classic study of this fascinating phenomenon is by Fryer and lies 1972. 15 Cf. Bulmer and Tyler 1968: 335.</page><page sequence="7">Defining the Divine in Rome 47 this reason anthropologists have often preferred to avoid the word "species" when discussing other societies: thus Ralph Bulmer speaks of "speciemes," Brett Berlin of "generic taxa," and Scott Atran of "generic species."16 Similarly, those "kinds" in a culture's taxonomie framework may themselves form part of larger groupings, or may be subdivided into smaller ones.17 But in all cases it appears to be accepted that there are fundamental groupings of "natural kinds," and that all living beings belong in one or other group. What allows members of a culture to define a particular "kind"? One might feel that I have already answered that question, when I spoke in the last paragraph of "reproducing 'after its kinď ... and sharing a bundle of features with other members of its 'kind.'" But that is a description, not a definition. Shared features and natural reproduction may be the way in most cases in which members of a society identify creatures as being members of one or another "kind," but they do not appear to be the things that define the "kind." This is apparent not least because in most societies the possibility appears to be left open of a creature being a member of a "kind" despite not possessing the typical features of other members and/or sharing in reproduction with them. In certain instances a member of one "kind" can lose one or more of the features that one might consider "core," but still be considered a member of the "kind" - tigers, as we all know, have stripes, but a stripeless tiger may still be unambiguously perceived as a tiger. In other instances the reproductive boundary may be breached as (for example) a being spontaneously switches from one "kind" to another.18 This allows us to conclude that in most societies, and in particular those societies where membership of a "kind" is determined by traditional cultural criteria rather than our scientific ones,19 what qualifies 16 See Berlin 1992, esp. 90; Atran 1998: 550. 17 Atran 1990: 17; cf. Boyer 1990: 105, and note also the discussion of Karam classifica- tions in Bulmer and Menzies 1973: 99. 18 Atran 1990: 29; for specific examples see, e.g., Bulmer 1968: 634; Bulmer and Tyler 1968: 335; Bulmer and Menzies 1973: 101-4; Dwyer 1976; also Bulmer and Menzies 1972: 473 for an explanation of why this does not undermine the generalization that the natural world consists of distinct species. 19 The most common scientific definition of a species is in terms of membership of a group that is reproductively isolated from other groups, with "membership" in a group defined by being born to members of those groups (so, e.g., Mayr 1942: 120; Coyne and Orr 2004, esp. 25-48, 61-72), though slightly different definitions have sometimes been proposed (for a recent example, see, e.g., Baker and Bradley 2006; cf. also the survey of alternative views by Coyne and Orr 2004: 447-72). This creates a certain amount of fuzziness, especially in cases where reproductive isolation is generated by physical dis- tance rather than the unwillingness of creatures to mate with certain others within the same geographic range (cf. Coyne and Orr 2004: 39-40). It also follows from scientific</page><page sequence="8">48 D. S. Levene a being for membership of a "kind" is nothing more or less than an "essence": what makes a tiger a tiger is not being born from another tiger, or indeed the possession of stripes (or other tiger-like qualities), but some indefinable "tigerness" - and this is true even if in practice "tigerness" correlates more or less precisely with having stripes and being born from other tigers.20 Cross-cultural comparisons would thus lead us to expect something similar for Rome, and indeed our evidence strongly suggests exactly that. The Romans did indeed divide up the natural world into "kinds," which each reproduced "after its kind."21 Lucretius 2.661-66 is a clear statement of this,22 but in some ways even more revealing is Pliny, HN 8.17323: observatum ex duobus diversis generibus nata tertii generis fieri et neutri parentium esse similia eaque ipsa, quae sunt ita nata, non gignere in omni animalium genere; idcirco mulas non parere, est in annalibus nostris peperisse saepe, verum prodigii loco habitům. Theophrastus vulgo parere in Cappadocia tradit, sed esse id animal ibi sui generis. It has been noted that animals born from two different kinds are of a third kind and similar to neither parent, and the actual creatures so born do not produce offspring in any kind of animal; consequently mules do not give birth. According to our annals they have frequently given birth, but that is treated as a prodigy. Theophrastus reports that they commonly give birth in Cappadocia, but that there this animal is a kind in its own right. definitions that "membership of the same species" is a non-transitive relationship: every creature is of the same species as its parents, yet every creature has ancestors which were of different species from itself. 20Atran 1990, esp. 58-62; cf. D'Andrade 1995: 176-77; cf. also Gelman and Hirschfeld 1999, arguing that this tendency to view the world in essentialist terms is a broader one rather than specific to the domain of biology. This "essentialist" understanding of biologi- cal kinds, although widely accepted, is however not wholly uncontroversial, and has been questioned in whole or part: see, e.g., Kalish 1995; Strevens 2000; Kalish 2002. 21 This is true even though there is no single Latin word which corresponds precisely to these "kinds." The most common word in this context is genust but this word may be used for higher or lower taxonomie categories as well - it can, for example, be used both of the human race as a whole, and of particular groups of humans, or of an entire class of being such as "fish," and of particular groups of fish. 22 On the role of fixed zoological kinds in Lucretius's thought, and its relationship to accounts of speciation in earlier writers (above all Plato), see Campbell 2000. 23 Cf. Plin. HN 7.5 for a general statement of the existence of distinct natural kinds.</page><page sequence="9">Defining the Divine in Rome 49 Pliny is here dealing with the common knowledge that reproduction is found across certain "kinds,"24 but argues that it does not conflict with the sense that the natural world is composed of distinct kinds, because the resulting offspring are sterile. What, then, of cases where the resulting offspring is not sterile?25 In those cases, either we are not dealing with a genuine hybrid, but a completely separate "kind,"26 or else we have a prodigy - in other words, a case where a natural boundary has been transgressed. Either of these interpre- tations maintains the basic concept that horses and donkeys are of separate "kinds," with a clear boundary between them. The idea that for the Romans membership of a "kind" was defined in essentialist terms, rather than through reproduction or properties, likewise emerges from a variety of places. If a woman gives birth to an elephant - or indeed a snake - the fact of so bizarre a birth may be regarded as a prodigy, showing that boundaries of this sort cannot be crossed without transgression, but it is still an elephant (or snake) that is produced, not a large human with a long nose or a thin human without limbs.27 Apes may be close to humans in terms of the qualities they possess, but they are emphatically not human.28 Conversely, it is possible for humans to have qualities associated with animals while remaining human: Pliny ( HN 7.23) describes a race of men ( genus hominum) who have the heads of dogs and who bark like dogs.29 All of these 24 For other examples of hybrid breeding, see, e.g., Plin. HN 7.30 (= Duris of Samos FGrH 76 F 48), 8.42-43; contrast 8.213, where Pliny discusses "hybridity" between wild and domesticated animals, but here appears to regard them as different versions of the same "kind." 25 Mules have occasionally (even outside Roman prodigy narratives) been known to give birth, something usually impossible to achieve because, while donkeys and horses share a common ancestor in the (evolutionarily) near past (which is why they are able to produce offspring at all), they have different numbers of chromosomes, so a mule has 32 from the horse parent and 31 from the donkey. Various genetic mechanisms have been proposed to explain how mules may nevertheless give birth in rare cases: see, e.g., Chandley 1981; Zong and Fan 1989. 26 Cf. also Plin. HN 10.189-90 for the ability to reproduce as the defining characteristic of something being a "kind" in its own right. 27 See Plin. HN 7.34; cf. Sil. Pun. 3.415-41. 28 Plin. HN 8.215. 29 This whole section of Pliny is illustrating the variety that can be subsumed under the general heading of "humanness": see Beagon 2005: 40-6. So, for example, he discusses people with one eye (7.10) or feet turned backwards (7.11) or with eight toes (7.23) or heads growing beneath their shoulders (7.23); the variety of attributes which Pliny regards</page><page sequence="10">50 D. S. Levene passages support the general point: that for the Romans, as for other cultures, all beings were members of "kinds," and membership in a "kind" was deter- mined primarily by the possession of the essence of that "kind," which only secondarily correlated with the possession of particular qualities typically associated with each "kind." So how can we determine whether gods and humans were thought of by Romans as members of the same "kind"? If I am right to argue that mem- bership of a "kind" was conceived by the Romans in essentialist terms, then that immediately gives us a problem: for if we are dealing with unseen es- sences rather than empirically detectable qualities, the only way to establish conclusively how members of a foreign society would categorize creatures into different groupings is to ask them directly - and there are no Romans around for us to ask. But although we cannot do this, we can at least sug- gest an approach which would be a reasonable proxy for asking directly, and which would enable us to draw a moderately firm conclusion. If gods and humans were conceived as being of separate "kinds," we would expect to find (a) indications of an essential divine nature that is different from the human nature: that the divine/human dichotomy was not merely a pair of antithetical categories, but was marked by some sort of barrier between them that could be crossed only in exceptional circumstances; and (b) that these correlated broadly (if not precisely) with the possession of a cluster of attributes that was distinctive to each group.30 Conversely, if gods and humans were conceived of as the same "kind," we would not expect to find these things. In Section 3 I shall be examining precisely this issue, and shall be arguing that the evidence strongly supports the assertion of humans and gods being conceived by the Romans as being in separate categories. Before I enter that discussion, however, I need to consider two possible objections to my meth- odology. Both objections are easily answerable in their main contentions, but at the same time both raise good issues about the possible scope and significance of what I am doing here, issues to which I shall return towards the end of the paper. as compatible with "being human" is vast. Conversely at HN 8. 1 Pliny shows that qualities that one might regard as distinctively human, such as understanding language and the possession of certain moral qualities, are found in elephants - yet they remain elephants, not humans. See Beagon 1992: 139-44; Beagon 2005: 48-50. 30 Compare the definition of "speciemes" by Bulmer and Tyler 1968: 349: "groups of creatures marked off from all other animals known to them [the Kar am] by multiple distinctions of appearance, habitat and behaviour, and not including recognised sub- groupings marked off from each other in a similar way."</page><page sequence="11">Defining the Divine in Rome 51 (A) The first objection is to note that the criteria I am using are taken from Roman accounts of the natural world; but, it might be objected, the gods are not part of the "natural world," and so it does not make sense to assess them by those criteria. It is true that the language of natural history was used in this context by Gradei himself, as I noted above; but this does not mean that it is justifiable to extend his perhaps casual language into the heuristic of an entire paper. Two responses to this can be given. The first might appear facile, but nev- ertheless still has force: if we are not entitled to treat the divine employing biological taxonomies, then that itself would appear to mark a fundamental separateness between the divine and the human world which would under- mine Gradeis model of "relative divinity." To raise this objection would thus appear to be to concede the case. The second response is to observe that it is generally the case in all soci- eties that supernatural entities are conceived as analogous to entities in the natural world, with "essences" that allow them to be categorized according to very similar criteria to those used for biological entities.31 Admittedly those supernatural entities are often conceived of as possessing properties which are not found in the natural world, and indeed are sometimes radically counter- intuitive when seen from the perspective of the natural world32; nevertheless it usually makes sense to examine them according to a taxonomie system that is similar to the one used in the natural world.33 If the Romans did not con- ceive of gods in such a way, then that would itself be a remarkable departure from the usual structures within which the divine is generally understood. Accordingly, our fundamental assumption should be that treating the hu- man/divine relationship in a manner analogous to biology is an acceptable approach, unless we find direct evidence demonstrating that this does not accord with Roman attitudes. But while this objection is not strong in itself, it is certainly the case that we would expect significant differences between the way in which things are categorized in the supernatural world by comparison with the natural world. In particular, the fact that we do not generally have direct empirical access to supernatural entities means that there is likely to be much more fuzziness both in the categories and in the properties that they are imagined to possess34; 31 Boyer 1994; cf. Ellen 1979: 21; Atran 2002: 93. 32 Boyer 1994: 34-35, 94. 33 Cf. Boyer 1994: 153-54, 161-62, 171-72. 34 Cf. Atran 2002: 94.</page><page sequence="12">52 D. S. Levene and this will inevitably have an important bearing on the way in which we construct their relationship with humans. This issue does not matter for the main purpose of demonstrating that a distinction between gods and humans exists, but it has a major bearing on how we should understand that distinc- tion: I shall discuss this point further in Section 4. (B) The second objection is that although I largely eschew the evidence of philosophy for the purposes of this argument, as I discussed in Section 1, 1 will be making extensive use of another form of literary evidence that some readers might find no less problematic, namely poetry. It might be argued that the images of the gods that we find in poetry are fundamentally liter- ary constructs, derived partly from the traditions of Greek literature, partly from the poets' imaginations; it is therefore not acceptable to employ them in a discussion such as this, which is seeking to elucidate the conception of the divine at Rome, rather than the way it is employed within the fictions of verse literature.35 This is a fair criticism up to a point: it is certainly the case that I shall in this argument be brushing fairly lightly over some significant generic dis- tinctions and not engaging closely with the nuances of the context in which these passages were written. But here too, my position is defensible. Poetic texts are not as strongly divorced from broader Roman religious conceptions as is sometimes assumed. As Denis Feeney has demonstrated, while poets engage in acknowledged fictions when narrating stories about the gods, their descriptions do not sit in a fantasy (Greek?) universe divorced from Roman religious thought and practice, but are constantly intertwined with religious thought,36 not least because religious thought itself is not monolithic and not 35 Note the famous analysis of the divine by the pontifex Scaevola quoted in August. De civ. D. 4.27, presumably transmitted to him through Varro (cf .Antiquitates rerum divina- rum fr. 7 Cardauns = August. De civ. D. 6.5). According to Scaevola, the gods of the poets are separate from those of civic society, because the poets falsely ascribe immoral actions to the gods. The general argument is of course as old as Xenophanes DK 2 IBI 1-12, but the specific separation of poetry from civic religion is more distinctive. Cf. Lieberg 1982, who traces Scaevola's tripartite theology (poetry/civic cult/philosophy) through a wide range of ancient writers, finding its roots in thinkers like Epicurus who were willing to participate in civic cult while rejecting poetic accounts of the gods. 36 Feeney 1998, a corrective to his earlier and largely dismissive account of the relevance of poetry to understanding Roman theological discourse in Feeney 1991: 103-6 (though contrast Feeney 1991: 178-80, where he offers a more nuanced reading of the relationship between Roman religious thought and the representation of gods of the Aeneid&gt; which pre- figures his later work). Graf 1988 makes a similar argument about Ovid's Metamorphoses in particular: that Ovid, even while acknowledging the fictionality of his stories about</page><page sequence="13">Defining the Divine in Rome 53 held dogmatically.37 Moreover, the texts I am examining rarely have as their primary aim to analyze the relationships between gods and men; they simply assume certain sorts of relationships between them. It is those underlying as- sumptions that I am seeking to elucidate, assumptions which appear in texts in other genres also, though less commonly, for the simple reason that it is rare for non-poetic and non-philosophical texts to thrust the gods and their relationships with humans into the center of attention. But here too, although questions of genre do not need to be addressed in order for my case to be demonstrated, it would be a mistake to assume that those questions are entirely irrelevant. Even if I am drawing primarily on poetry simply because that is where the best evidence is to be found, it is still worth asking the question why this is the case: why so much of the evidence comes from poetry, and how that should affect our understanding of the role that the divine/human distinction plays in Roman thought. This question too I shall examine towards the end of the paper. 3. WHAT IS A GOD? The most obvious place to begin examining the ways in which Romans cat- egorized humans and gods is the point where people move from one status to the other: in other words, narratives of apotheosis. The mere existence of apotheosis naturally tells us nothing at all about whether it was conceived as transgressing a fixed boundary or simply as a change in status; but the form the narratives take is more interesting. There are several such narratives in divine activities, adjusts them so as to relate them more closely to Roman religion. More generally on the dynamic relationship between mythical stories and civic religious prac- tice, see also Scheid 1993; Riipke 2004; and especially the challenging paper of Feeney 2004, which argues that literary accounts of sacrifice do not reflect (or fail to reflect) an externally existing truth, but rather are part of a process of constructing a meaning for a ritual which had no agreed function within Roman society. It is worth observing that Varro specifically comments that popular beliefs about the gods were close to the poetic ones ( Antiquitates rerum divinarum fr. 19 Cardauns = August. De civ. D. 4.32). 37 On this important point, cf. King 2003, emphasizing the range of religious beliefs on any topic that might legitimately be held within the Roman religious system. As will be seen, this point is very relevant to the ultimate conclusions of this paper, though King is primarily interested in the possibility that different individuals might hold different beliefs while engaging in the same cultic act, whereas my focus is rather on the possible range of conceptual assumptions that might be held even by a single individual in different religious or literary contexts. Cf. Feeney 1998: 14-21, adapting to a different context Paul Veyne's notion of "brain-balkanisation" ( Veyne 1988: 41-57). See further below, Section 4.</page><page sequence="14">54 D. S. Levette Oviďs Metamorphoses , for example38 - and that fact is revealing in itself, be- cause Oviďs Metamorphoses is structured around transformations between different kinds, not transformations which breach no natural boundaries.39 The very fact that so many of the transformations in Ovid are apotheoses strongly implies that such apotheoses were seen as transgressive in the same way as the other transformations in the work, such as the metamorphoses of people into plants and animals, are. The details of the narratives in Ovid are also revealing. Here, for example, is his account of the apotheosis of Hercules {Met. 9.251-55, 262-70): "nec nisi materna Vulcanum parte potentem sentiet. aeternum est a me quod traxit, et expers atque inmune necis, nullaque domabile fiamma. idque ego defunctum terra caelestibus oris accipiam ..." interea quodcumque fuit populabile flammae, Mulciber abstulerat, nec cognoscenda remansit Herculis effigies, nec quicquam ab imagine ductum matris habet, tantumque Iovis vestigia servat. utque novus serpens posita cum pelle senecta luxuriare solet, squamaque nitere recenti, sic ubi mortales Tirynthius exuit artus, parte sui meliore viget, maiorque videri coepit et augusta fieri gravitate verendus. "Nor will he feel the power of Vulcan except with the maternal part of him; what he has drawn from me is eternal and untouched and unharmed by death and cannot be overcome by any fire. When that is quit of the earth I shall receive it into the celestial realm Meanwhile Vulcan had snatched away whatever could be ravaged by fire, nor did a recognizable image of Hercules remain, nor did he have anything drawn from the form of his mother, and only kept the traces of Jupiter. And just as a new snake blooms when it has laid down its old 38 On apotheoses in the Metamorphoses , see Feeney 1991: 205-14. 39 Cf. Feeney 1991: 194: "The cosmogony [at the beginning of the Metamorphoses] establishes the rules of the game, the fundamental boundaries whose limits the poem's transgressions will explore. Gods, humans, and animals belong each in their own sphere (1. 69-78)." Zgoll 2004: 243-44 suggests that Ovid is anomalous among Augustan poets in explicitly using the language of metamorphosis to describe apotheosis; but other writers too use language of it which allows for metamorphosis, even if not explicitly requiring that interpretation, such as fieri/ esse deus (see Zgoll 2004: 258-59).</page><page sequence="15">Defining the Divine in Rome 55 age with its skin, and glows with its fresh scales, so, when Hercules stripped off his mortal limbs, the better part of him was strong, and he began to look larger and become awe-inspiring with august dignity. A similar account of Hercules' apotheosis is found in pseudo-Seneca, Hercules Oetaeus 1966-68: quidquid in nobis tui mortale fuerat, ignis evictum tulit: paterna cáelo, pars data est flammis tua. Whatever in me had been mortal, derived from you, the fire has overcome and carried off. My paternal part has been given to heaven, your part to the flames. Hercules was, of course, of dual parentage - a human mother and a divine father. The interesting thing in these narratives is that this dual parentage is conceived of in terms of separate essences, which Hercules possesses from both parents. His apotheosis thus consists of burning away the human side and leaving only the divine side. It is hard to see how this can sit naturally with a concept of relative divinity: it appears to require that the divine and the human are fundamentally distinct from one another.40 A slightly different form of apotheosis, but one whose assumptions once again seem to require that deity is an absolute rather than a relative quality, is found in the story of Castor and Pollux. According to the most widely told version of the myth, Castor had a human father, Pollux a divine father. Pollux was hence destined for deification, Castor for the underworld; but out of love for his brother Pollux begged his father to allow them to share their lives, and so they alternated between the underworld and heaven.41 Here, at least in surviving Roman accounts, no details are given about the "nature" of the one brother which qualified him for heaven, and of the other which 40 For similar though briefer and less explicit descriptions of Hercules' deification, see Cic. Div. 1.47, Stat. Silv. 3.1.6-7. Cf. also Ov. Met. 4.539-41 (Ino and Melicerta), 13.949-53 (Glaucus), 14.600-7 (Aeneas), 14.824-28 (Romulus), 15.840-51 (Caesar); also Val. Max. 1.8.8 and 4.5.6 (likewise on Caesar), and Ov. Fast. 4.550-60 (Ceres' attempt to make Triptolemus immortal). All of these indicate, among other things, that deification occurs by virtue of abandoning the mortale corpus. Compare Price 1987, studying the apotheoses of Roman emperors as represented at their funerals, esp. Price 1987: 73-77, showing that these apotheoses were modeled on the traditional accounts of the apotheoses of Hercules and Romulus, and like them assumed that the emperors' mortal part was destroyed while his divinity ascended to heaven. 41 For the story, see, e.g., Ov. Fast. 5.714-20, Sil. Pun. 13.804-5 (cf. 9.295), Hyg. Fab. 80.</page><page sequence="16">56 D. S. beverie qualified him for the underworld alone; nor how the sharing of positions was effected. But that there is some fundamental human and divine nature which under normal circumstances would lead to such separate destinies is simply assumed: the possibility that (for example) Castor and Pollux would equally qualify for divine status by being equal objects of cult worship is not raised as a possibility in any account. Indeed, the Romans were able to conceive of gods who received no cult at all. An example is Aurora, the goddess of the dawn. That she is a goddess is widely assumed in literary sources, and her most famous myth - the story of her love for Tithonus - is premised on her divinity and the gap between her and a mere human. But there is no evidence for any cult of Aurora any- where in the Roman world42 - a point that Ovid makes some play with (Met. 13.587-90): omnibus inferior, quas sustinet aureus aether, (nam mihi sunt totum rarissima templa per orbem) diva tamen, veni, non ut delubra diesque des mihi sacrificos caliturasque ignibus aras. I am inferior to all the goddesses whom the golden heaven supports (for I have the fewest temples in the whole world), but am still a goddess; I have not come so that you give me shrines and sacrificial festivals and altars to be hot with flames. Rarissima here is of course a euphemism for "none"; Aurora s point is that one can be a god even without temples.43 The existence of worship is not ir- relevant, but she implies that it provides a god with increased status within the 42 The Roman goddess Mater Matuta, who received extensive cultic worship, may have in origin been a dawn goddess, and was occasionally interpreted as such in antiquity: so Lucr. 5.656-57, and cf. Prise. Gramm. Lat. 2.76.18: matutinus a Matuta , quae significai Auroram vel, ut quidam , AeuKO0éav ("matutinus is derived from Matuta, which means Aurora, or, as some say, Leucothea") . However, from the late Republic onwards it was the alternative identification mentioned by Priscian, with the sea-goddess Leucothea, which dominated (esp. Ov. Fast. 6.545), and the connection with Aurora was generally suppressed. SeeWissowa 1912: 110-12. 43 Ovid here is adapting Thetis's words to Zeus at II. 1.515-16: x' аттоет' ... ö&lt;pp' èO eiôéu) / öaaov èytb цета rcãaiv епчцотатт] 0sóc; ei[ii ("or refuse ... so that I may know well how much I am the least honored goddess of all"; cf. Hopkinson 2000: 187-88). In Homer, however, Thetis's words stand as a potential rebuke to Zeus if he should refuse her request. Ovid's Aurora simply acknowledges her inferiority as a fact - in particular, she implies her inferiority to Thetis, cults of whom certainly existed (see, e.g., Hdt. 7.191.2, Paus. 3.14.4).</page><page sequence="17">Defining the Divine in Rome 57 class of divinities,44 not that it makes the difference between being a divinity and not being one. Conversely, one could, at least in theory, be honored as a god without being one. Thanks to her exceptional beauty, Psyche in Apuleius, Met. 4.28.3-30.3 (cf. 4.32.2, 4.34.5, 5.28.9-10) is widely taken for Venus, and accordingly receives worship and prayers. It is true that in this case her acolytes believe that they are worshiping Venus, but the assumption of the story is that nevertheless the honor accrues to Psyche herself - which is what generates Venus's hostility to her, as not only are her traditional shrines neglected (4.29.3), but she feels that Psyche has taken what rightfully belongs to Venus herself (see esp. 4.30.3: meos honores usurpaverit," usurped my honors"). But Venus's complaint goes beyond a feeling of personal slight; it is that a fundamental transgression has taken place. Although Psyche may look like and (more importantly) be treated as a goddess, she is not one (as Venus caustically remarks at 4.30. 1-2) - until she finally achieves apotheosis and her inner nature is brought to match her external appearance (cf. below).45 A fundamental division between the human and the divine is also assumed in a famous passage of Livy ( Praef. 6-7): quae ante conditam condendamve urbem poeticis magis decora fabulis quam incorruptis rerum gestarum monumentis traduntur, ea nec adfirmare пес refellere in animo est. datur haec venia antiquitati ut miscendo humana divinis primordia urbium augustiora faciat; et si cui populo licere oportet consecrare origines suas et ad deos referre auctores, ea belli gloria est populo Romano ut cum suum conditorisque sui parentem Martern potissimum ferat, tam et hoc gentes humanae patiantur aequo animo quam impérium patiuntur. The traditions from before the city was founded or planned are more suited to the stories of poetry than the unsullied monuments of history: my intention is neither to endorse or deny them. Antiquity is given a concession which makes the origins of cities more august by the intercourse of human and divine. And if any people should be allowed to sanctify its origins and to claim the gods as its originators, the Roman people has such glory in war that when it names Mars in particular as its father and the father of its founder, human races ought to accept this too with equanimity, just as they accept our empire. 44 Ovid frequently makes play with the idea of a hierarchy within the divine: cf., e.g., Met. 1.171-74, 14.589-90 (see Galinsky 1975: 170-71). Although (here and elsewhere) he treats it in a humorous fashion, the notion that the divine world is organized hierarchi- cally reflects Roman religious practice: see Scheid 1999. 45 See James 1987: 142-45, 164-65.</page><page sequence="18">58 D. S. Levene Livy's assumption here is that the human and the divine occupy essentially different spheres; the claim that they can mix belongs to poetry rather than history. Because of Rome's greatness he is prepared to concede the traditional stories of her divine origin, albeit without actively affirming their truth, but the implicit assumption is that divine and human are not such as to mix with one another in the real world - the "mixture" in question, as the specific reference to Mars's siring of Romulus indicates, being primarily conceived of in sexual terms. Just as with animal species, humans and gods should not usually be expected to breed with one another.46 Similar assumptions seem to underlie a delightful episode from 74-73 B.c.E.47 The Roman publicani in Boeotia ruled that Amphiaraus was not a god: the reason that this mattered to them was that were he a god, his shrine at Oropus would be tax-exempt. The Oropans appealed to the Roman senate, who established a commission to investigate, and the commission concluded that Amphiaraus was indeed a god. The problem may in part have been that Amphiaraus was a /zeros,48 and that was not a category that existed at Rome: 46 Livy's position here is admittedly an extreme one in its general denial of divine-human intermingling; other authors, faced with the same issue, were prepared to allow that such things occurred (see Wiseman 2002), though typically treating it as a striking exception rather than a general rule. Similarly, Lycus at Sen. HF 448 lays it down as a principle that "the mortal race cannot be joined to heaven" {mortale cáelo non potest iungi genus) , though the generalization is immediately corrected by Amphitryon, who notes that in fact many gods have been born through precisely such parentage (Sen. HF 449). 47 Our knowledge of the episode primarily comes from a long inscription ( SIG 747) re- cording the various rulings. One of the commissioners who ruled in favor of Amphiaraus's divinity, it appears from the inscription (747.1 1-12), was Cicero, and Cicero, as I discuss below, referred to the episode thirty years later in Nat. D. 3.49, without however mention- ing his own involvement in it. 48 The issue in Greece was admittedly more complicated still, because Amphiaraus, originally a "hero," achieved wide-ranging recognition which was more typical of a god than a hero, and thus was often called a "god," with his rites accordingly closer to those of divine cult than hero-cult: see Farnell 1921: 58-62. See, e.g., Paus. 1.34.2-5, where he is repeatedly referred to as 0eôç. This is however only an extreme example of a general tendency, since even lesser hero-cults could blend into divine ones (cf. Nock 1944). For the ambiguity of his status in Roman writing, compare Varro, Antiquitates rerum divinarum fr. 31 Cardauns = Tert. Ad nat. 2.7.1-2, both for the idea that Amphiaraus was a "hero," and for the corresponding denial that he qualifies as a god; but note also Antiquitates rerum divinarum fr. 32 Cardauns = Serv. Auct. on Aen. 8.275, where he is treated as one of the gods, albeit only one local to the Thebans.</page><page sequence="19">Defining the Divine in Rome 59 the general rule was that either one was a god or one was a human.49 The inscription admittedly does not record either the reason for the publicam s original ruling, or the reason for the commission's overturning it, and it may be that the issues were not primarily theological - the publicani obviously had a financial interest in trying to enlarge their tax-base, and the com- mission may have been doing nothing more than maintaining precedent, since the decree of Sulla, and the subsequent senatus consultum , which had established the rights of the shrine of Amphiaraus at Oropus, had referred to him as Gecoi Ацсркхрсшн - "the god Amphiaraus."50 However, Cicero, Nat . D. 3.49, referring to the episode, says that the publicanï s reasoning was that "they denied that anyone who had at one time been human was immortal" (negabant immortalis esse ullos qui aliquando homines fuissent). Granted that the publicani did not have the final word on this matter, the fact that they could use such an argument at all indicates that Livy s cool approach towards divine-human intermingling in his Preface was far from unique to him: and the elaborate procedure by which their decision was overturned likewise shows that their position could not easily be dismissed, despite the officially sanctioned worship at Rome of such (alleged) former humans as Quirinus/ Romulus, Hercules, and Castor and Pollux. Moreover, the way in which it is overturned, rather than allowing for an intermediate category between divine and human, still accepts the fundamental dichotomy between the two, while placing Amphiaraus on the opposite side of the line. Thus Cicero, Div. 1.88, in conformity with the conclusion that he had reached as commissioner (n47 above), refers to Amphiaraus as someone worshiped as a deus (though see also n48 above). All of these examples demonstrate that, just as we would expect for dif- ferent "kinds," gods and humans were conceived by the Romans as having different essences, which exist independently of whether they receive worship. 49 On the absence of intermediate categories between gods and men at Rome (unlike Greece), see Beard, North, and Price 1998: 1 .3 1 . It is interesting to note that, faced with the question of whether Mars really did sire Romulus (cf. above, n46), the Greek Dionysius of Halicarnassus argues that the true sire may have been not a god, but a daimon , one of a class of beings who fall between humans and gods and may accordingly mate with either (Ant. Rom. 1.77.3). No Latin writer, even those like Livy who are clearly uncom- fortable with the Romulus story, offers this sort of intermediate figure as a solution to the problem of his parentage. 50SIG 747 .48, 54-55; cf. 747.5. The body of the inscription is translated from a Latin original (see Mommsen 1885: 268 = Mommsen 1908: 495), and Geóç here is thus presum- ably translating an original deus.</page><page sequence="20">60 D. S. Levene The next question is whether these categories do, as we would also expect, broadly correspond to separate properties. There are certain minor details of gods' lives which appear to be particular to them, and to separate them from humans. There is a strong sense, for example, that gods are intrinsically blessed: that is why Roman love-poets compare their bliss in love to a divine existence.51 Gods eat different food and drink from humans: the gods' everyday diet is nectar and ambrosia.52 These things are trivial in themselves - after all, rich people are typically both happier53 and eat better food than poor people, but that does not add up to a claim that the rich are literally a different kind of being from the poor. But it is not the possession of individual properties alone that suggests a fundamental division between gods and men: it is the existence of a cluster of such properties in association with suggestions of a natural distinction such as those I discussed above. In the case of food, for example, an especially revealing passage is Apuleius, Met. 6.23.4-5. Jupiter here is reassuring Venus that her son Cupid will not be marrying a mere mortal: et ad Venerem conlata facie "nee tu," inquit "filia, quicquam contristere пес prosapiae tantae tuae statuque de matrimonio mortali metuas. iam faxo nuptias non impares sed legitimas et iure civili congruas," et ilico per Mercurium arripi Psychen et in caelum perduci iubet et porrecto ambrosiae poculo "sume," inquit "Psyche, et immortalis esto, пес umquam digredietur a tuo nexu Cupido sed istae vobis erunt perpetuae nuptiae." And turning his face to Venus he said, "And do not, my daughter, be at all de- pressed nor afraid for your great lineage and position through marriage to a mortal. I shall now make the marriage not an unequal one but legitimate and in accord with civil law." And he straightaway ordered Psyche to be seized by Mercury and brought to heaven. He held out a cup of ambrosia to her, and said "Psyche, consume this, and be immortal, nor will Cupid ever depart from your embrace, but your marriage will be eternal." Here the eating of ambrosia is not simply an incidental feature of the divine lifestyle, but it directly correlates with the intrinsic divine nature, such that a mortal who eats the food becomes divine in a form of apotheosis.54 Similarly, the blessedness of the gods is not merely an incidental product of their status, but is connected to their fundamental nature, as at Valerius Maximus 9.2.ext. 1 1, who complains that Nature has made humans subject to physical suffering, 51 See, e.g., Prop. 2.14.9-10, 2.15.39-40. 52 E.g., Ov. Pont. 1.10.11-12. 53 For recent research on this, see Stevenson and Wolfers 2008. 54 Compare Ov. Met. 14.606-7 (discussed below).</page><page sequence="21">Defining the Divine in Rome 61 and that "the condition of heavenly strength has been denied to the human condition" ( habitumque caelestis roboris humanae condicioni denegatimi). More generally, the distinctive properties that are associated with the divine are numerous. The most familiar, of course, is immortality, which is so commonly used as a marker of separation between gods and men that illustrations are hardly needed. Instead we should offer some slight words of caution. While it is certainly true that mortales is a virtual synonym for "human" in Latin,55 and immortales the most common qualifier for gods,56 all humans, while obviously mortal, were also in a sense immortal, because they were widely presumed to possess a spirit that would last beyond death,57 and the dead were themselves held to be divine - the di Manes,58 albeit a divin- ity of a different sort from that of the celestial gods.59 What matters more is that there is a general, even if not precise, correlation between immortality and divinity - which is exactly what one would expect to see, given that we are dealing with an essentialist definition of the divine "kind" rather than a definition in terms of shared properties. An especially revealing passage from this perspective is the exchange between Aeneas and the Sibyl in Ovid, Met. 14.123-39: "seu dea tu praesens, seu dis gratíssima," dixit, "numinis instar eris semper mihi, meque fatebor muneris esse tui, quae me loca mortis adire, 55 Compare Gell. 13.29, where Fronto, discussing Claudius Quadrigarius's use of mortales instead of homines (fr. 76P), argues that the former word, while admittedly poetic, was appropriate for Quadrigarius to employ in this case, because it encompassed the entire population. 56 Gradei 2002: 32 argues that Hor. Epist. 2.2. 187-88 indicates that the Romans saw the Genius as a mortal god, dying at the same time as the person to whom it was linked. This is, however, contradicted by Apuleius, De deo Soc. 151, and is based on a misinterpretation of Horace: see Brink 1982: 389-90, 442-43. 57 This point is particularly emphasized by Gradei 2002: 32, who argues from it that "death" for the Romans (as also other societies) was in part socially constructed, and hence in the case of emperors it was easy to redefine death as something different. This is true, but does not support the conclusion that Gradei needs for his argument, because, as I show in the main text, the "something different" that the death of an apotheized emperor is redefined as was not seen by the Romans themselves as merely a social construct, but as reflecting an actual difference in the manner of the spirit's survival. 58 So, e.g., Varro, Antiquitates rerum divinarum fr. 210 Cardauns) = August. De civ. D. 8.26 (cf. also Plut. Quaest. Rom. 14). 59 Compare Cic. Nat. D. 3.49 (quoted above), where the publicani deny that anyone who had been human could ever be immortalis - presumably in this case not associating the attribute of immortality with the dead. Cf. also Cic. Phil 1.13, Plin. HN 2.27.</page><page sequence="22">62 D. S.

"Whether you are a goddess in person, or one most pleasing to the gods," he said, "you will always be the equivalent of a god for me, and I will confess myself bound to your service, you who were willing for me to approach the places of death, and to escape the places of death after seeing it. In recompense for these services, once I have returned to the breezes of the air I will establish temples to you, and will pay to you the honor of incense." The prophetess looked at him, and with a deep sigh said "I am not a goddess, and nor should you reward a human person with the honor of sacred incense, nor ignorantly fall into error. Eternal light without end was offered to me, if I had surrendered my virginity to Phoebus, who loved me. But while he was still hoping for it, while he was desiring to seduce me in advance with gifts, he said 'Cumaean virgin, choose what you wish, and take what you have wished for.' I showed him a pile of dust that I had scooped up, and foolishly asked to have as many birthdays as it had grains of dust. But I forgot to ask also that the years be ones of constant youth." Aeneas s original offer, with its implication that "being favored by the gods" is itself sufficient to warrant divine worship, might appear to support a picture of relative rather than absolute divinity: it is the Sibyl's benefactions towards him, not her possession of particular qualities, that makes her worthy of wor- ship. Nor even is the Sibyl's response, saying that she is not a god, and hence not worthy, sufficient to undermine that, since that alone could mean simply that she is denying that she is of appropriate status, not that there is some absolute criterion for divinity that she has failed to meet.60 But the detail of 60 Compare Gradei 2002: 59, 140-44 on the refusals of divinity by various emperors, notably Tiberius (see also below, nl04). Gradei however fails to note the terms in which Tac. Ann. 4.38.1 couches one such refusal: Tiberius, not unlike the Sibyl in Ovid, rejects divinity on the grounds that he is "mortal" ( mortalem)&gt; which does imply that he is lack- ing an actual physical quality associated with divinity.</page><page sequence="23">Defining the Divine in Rome 63 Oviďs discussion shows that the Sibyl's rejection is not on the grounds of status, but lack of immortality (had she accepted Apollo's offer of "eternal light without end," she implies, she would indeed have been a god). In fact, in her case she is not a god even though she has something remarkably close to divine immortality, namely a lifespan of uncountable length, albeit without eternal youth to go with it.61 A similar point emerges from Virgil, Aen. 6.304: when it is said of Charon that he is "now old, but the old age for a god is fresh and green" ( iam senior , sed cruda deo viridisque senectus), the key is that, even for a god commonly represented as old, his "age" is quite unlike that of mortals, but has the qualities more usually associated with youth. Not only the possession of immortality matters, but also the process of acquiring it. For a mortal human to become an immortal god required a physical transformation: either death itself, through which one became one of the di Manes , or apotheosis, which allowed one to be an immortal divinity with a more individual identity. With regard to the latter, the language used in descriptions of apotheosis (discussed above) strongly implies that the process of creating an immortal god by purging mortality is a quasi-physical process quite different from the survival of the spirit beyond death, and sometimes this point is indicated by particular details. These details do not (of course) reflect with any precision "what the Romans thought happened in apotheosis," since they are entirely works of imaginative construction, and it is unlikely in any case that there was a closely defined Roman belief as to "what happened in apotheosis." But they bear witness to the sense that it was felt appropri- ate to describe an apotheosis in terms that implied that something concrete was happening in the creation of immortality. So, for example, at Ovid, Met. 14.603-7 Venus turns Aeneas into a god not (in this instance) by destroying his mortal parts, but by purifying them and anointing him, touching his lips with nectar and ambrosia (compare the deification of Psyche through drinking ambrosia at Apuleius, Met. 6.23 quoted above). Similar is the death of Caesar in Ovid, Met. 15.844-48: suique Caesaris eripuit membris nec in aera solvi passa recentem animam caelestibus intulit astris. 61 Compare Gell. 2.16.10, criticizing his teacher Sulpicius Apollinaris, who had solved a problem in Aeneid 6.764 (the fact that the line conflicts with the normal story, accord- ing to which Silvius Aeneas was born after Aeneas's death) by interpreting longaevo in that line to mean not "aged," but "long and unending" - i.e., divine. Gellius admires the ingenuity of the solution, but points out the flaw: that there is a fundamental difference between a long life and an unending immortal one.</page><page sequence="24">64 D. S. beverie dumque tulit, lumen capere atque ignescere sensit emisitque sinu. She snatched the fresh soul of her Caesar from his limbs, nor did she allow it to be dissolved into the air, but brought it to the stars of heaven. And while she carried it, she felt it catch the light and ignite, and she let it go from her breast. It is true that the alternative to deification Ovid here envisages for Caesar is not survival in the underworld, but Epicurean-style dissolution of the soul; but the process by which Caesar is turned into a god is an individual one which bears little relationship to any account of the survival of the soul after death.62 No less revealing is that gods are generally assumed not only to be differ- ent from humans in their essential nature, but to look different.63 While (with occasional exceptions) they are generally imagined as anthropomorphic, even anthropomorphic gods are perceptually different from humans: they are commonly described as larger, more beautiful, and with a quality of light emerging from their form,64 unless they have made some effort to conceal it. We have already seen this repeatedly in apotheosis narratives: at Ovid, Met. 9.263-70, for example (quoted above), Hercules in losing his mortal essence also changes his appearance. When Neptune deified Ino he "made new her appearance" (Ovid &gt;Met. 4.541 :faciemque novavit); on Romuluss deification as Quirinus "a handsome appearance and one more worthy of the high couches came over him" (Ovid, Met 14.827-28: pulchra subit fades et pulvinaribus 62 Compare also Val. Max. 4.5.6 for the suggestion that the manner of Caesar's death shows that he was in fact being deified, not dying: in hune modum non homines expiranty sed di immortales sedes suas repetunt ("this is the way not that men expire, but that the immortal gods return to their homes"). On the notion of "returning" here, see Wardle 1997: 336-42, arguing that Valerius (unlike Ovid) consistently presents Caesar even during his lifetime as a god temporarily confined in a human body, who returns to the divine world on his death. 63 See Pfitzer 1924: 314-15. On this issue it is worth comparing the enlightening study of Vernant 1 99 1 : 27-49. Vernant's primary interest is in the archaic Greek period, and not all of his analysis (especially that related to the conception of the mortal body) should be assumed to be applicable to the Roman conceptual universe. However, his understanding of the divine body as "taking to an extreme all the qualities and bodily values that are present in humans in a form that is always diminished, derivative, faltering, and precari- ous" (Vernant 1991: 31) is illuminating for the Roman material no less than the Greek. 64 Note the widespread practice in ancient art of representing both gods and godlike rulers with rays of light emerging from their heads; see Bergmann 1998. More generally, emperors were depicted in literature and art having a beauty that is beyond the human; see Clauss 1999: 264-65.</page><page sequence="25">Defining the Divine in Rome 65 altis / dignior) ,65 When the dead Caesar appears to Cassius in Valerius Maximus, he does so "more august than human trappings" (1.8.8: humano habitu au- gustiorem); the vision of the to-be-deified Augustus that his father had before his birth, according to Suetonius, Aug. 94.6, was of someone "of greater than mortal appearance" ( mortali specie ampliorem).66 In a verse inscription ( CIL VI 21521 = CLE 1 109) the mourner imagines his dead relative telling him that he has become a god: he is both larger than he was in life and glowing with light.67 And the same ideas repeatedly recur in other contexts. The story of Semeie, for example, is premised on the idea that Jupiter - and, by implica- tion, the other gods too - are in their natural form far more than any human can endure to see.68 When Hannibal in Silius Italicus is granted a vision of the gods, he sees them with "limbs of fire" (Pun. 12.72 7: flammea membra). Divine epiphanies are regularly preceded by a brilliant light.69 Descriptions of divine disguise lead to the same conclusions. Gods, even anthropomorphic gods, are regularly described as disguising themselves by "adopting a mortal form" or "abandoning the divine form," the assumption being that the ap- pearances of humans and gods were usually distinct.70 Even more revealing is when the disguise is imperfect.71 When Virtue disguises herself as Manto in Statius, Theb. 10.646, her divine nature is betrayed by (among other things) her "over-large stride" (nimiique gradus). Aeneas, though failing to recognize his mother at the opening of the Aeneidy tells her that "you do not have the face of a mortal, nor does your voice sound human" (Aen. 1 .327-28: haud tibi vultus / mortalis , пес vox hominem sonat ). Admittedly this might be read as mere flattery - there was a topos going back to Homer, Od. 6.149 (a passage 65 Cf. also Julius Proculus's vision of the deified Romulus at Ov. Fast. 2.503-4. 66 For the same idea, compare, e.g., Val. Max. 1.7 ext. 1, 1.8.6, Frontin. Str. 1.1 1.10, Sil. Pun. 15.21. Note also Gordon 1979: 13-15, arguing that the colossal size of many cult- statues was self-consciously related by the Greeks and Romans to their sense that gods were properly understood to be larger than humans; it is worth comparing the practice of representing emperors, too, with colossal statues (cf. Clauss 1999: 306-1 1, who similarly relates it to the sense that gods were larger than human). 67 On the religious significance of the descriptive language in this inscription, see Selter 2006, esp. 62-65. 68 See, e.g., Ov. Met. 3.273-308; cf. Feeney 1998: 105-6. 69 So, e.g., Verg. Aen. 2.590-91, 3.151; Ov. Fast. 1.94. 70 So, e.g., Verg. Aen. 5.619,9.657; Ov.Met. 1.213,8.626, 11.203; Sen. Phaedr. 294-5; Calp.

Vernant 1991: 43-45. 71 Compare Vernant 1991: 43: "As well-camouflaged as a god may be in the skin of a mortal, there is something 'off,' something in the otherness of the divine presence that remains strange and disconcerting even when the god is in disguise."</page><page sequence="26">66 D. S. beverie imitateci here) of praising mortals by suggesting that they looked divine.72 But that very topos suggests that the normal assumption was that mortals and gods generally looked quite different, and in this case, even apart from the fact that we would not normally understand Aeneas as the purveyor of Odyssean flattery, he appears to be recognizing something genuine in his mother's appearance.73 And indeed, when she finally reveals herself, not only her light and her scent are divine, but "the true goddess was revealed by her gait" (1.405: vera incessu patuit dea).74 Another respect in which gods typically differ from humans is in their loca- tion.75 Gods are often defined as being "somewhere else": the use of caelicolae as a virtual synonym for "gods," is an obvious example,76 as is the distinction between di superi and the di inferi - the "gods above" and the "gods below," both sharing the feature that they are not part of the ecology of the human world. Here it must be admitted that there is a good deal of flexibility at the margins. Sea gods live in the sea; nature spirits, such as wood or water nymphs, are often assumed to inhabit part of the natural world,77 and even with the Olympian gods there is a constant ambiguity about their relationship to their 72 Cf., e.g., Q. Lutatius Catulus, fr. 2 Courtney ap. Cic. Nat. D. 1.79; Prop. 2.2; Ov. Am. 3.11.47, Her. 18.67-68; Stat. Theb. 4.746-47; CLE 1988.17-19; on the topos, cf. Lieberg 1962.

Met. 3.609-12, where Acoetes recognizes a boy as divine from the fact that he does not look mortal in "clothing, appearance, and gait" (3.609: cultum faciemque gradumque); and tells his companions that "a god is in that body" (3.612: corpore numen in isto est). Cf. Feeney 1998: 106. 75 Compare Plin. HN 8.225-28 for the significance of location in characterizing dif- ferent animal species. 76Ennius's famous line Romulus in caelo cum dis genitalibus aevum/degit (Ann. 1 10-1 1 Skutsch: "Romulus passes his life in heaven with the creator gods") is relevant here, not only for the sentiment, but for the fact that it appears to have become proverbial, to judge from its being parodied in Martial 13.16 (probably imitating Lucilius; cf. Sen. Apocol. 9.5, and see Skutsch 1985: 261-62) and its frequent appearance (again apparently in parodie contexts) in Pompeian graffiti ( CIL IV 3135, 7353, 8568, 8995). On the Ennian line, and in particular on the meaning of genitalibusy see Jocelyn 1989. 77 A useful illustration of this is Ov. Fast. 3.285-348, where Faunus and Picus teach Numa how to bring Jupiter out of the sky down to earth. See in particular 3.292, where Egeria says that Faunus and Picus are Romani numen utrumque soli ("both spirits of Roman sor), and 3.314-16, where they explain that, unlike Jupiter, "our spirits have their own territory; we are rustic gods who hold power in the high mountains" (habent fines numina nostra suos. / di sumus agrestes et qui dominemur in altis / montibus).</page><page sequence="27">Defining the Divine in Rome 67 temples and cult images78: whether the images merely represent them, or if the god is in some sense present in the temple and identical with the image79 - the language used of them, and the stories narrated about them, veer between these two apparently incompatible assumptions.80 But even in these cases the regular assumption is that the gods - even if perhaps localized somewhere within the human world - are so placed as to be separated from normal hu- man contact.81 Cicero, Har. resp. 62 says that it is impossible for gods to roam the world and talk to humans the way they do in myth - and while we should grant that Cicero is saying this in order to bolster his argument (he is trying to boost the importance of the divine sign he has actually received by noting that it is the best one could possibly get), he did not need to have made such a comment at all, and would be unlikely to have done so unless he felt that it corresponded to a broader feeling at Rome that gods and humans occupied separate spheres. Ovid seems to be reflecting such an opinion when at Fast. 78 Compare Lipka 2009: 1 1-30, on temples and cult images as "spatial foci" of the gods in question. 79 So, e.g., at Cic. Div. Caec. 3 the Sicilians complain that Verres' theft of sacred images means that they no longer have gods to whom they can appeal. Cic. Verr. 2.4.129 refers to the Capitol as "Jupiter's home on earth" ( terrestri domicilio lovis) - the implication however being that Jupiter's primary home is in heaven. 80 See, e.g., the story of the evocatio of Juno from Veii to Rome. In the version of this in Livy 5.22.3-7, Juno is apparently present in the image (Livy refers to moving "the gods themselves," ipsos . . . deos - and speaks of the assenting and self-moving statue as dea); but the version in Val. Max. 1.8.3 seems to assume that the actual Juno is in heaven, and the image simply represents her ( iamque non simulacrum , sed ipsam caelo Iunonem petitam portare se credentes ). See Ando 2003a: 338 = Ando 2003b: 233-4, who however does not comment on the version in Valerius. More generally on the ambiguity, and its crucial role in allowing cults to spread beyond their original location, cf. Lane Fox 1986: 133-37; Ando 2008: 21-42; Rüpke 2010; note also the extended study of Steiner 2001, esp. 79-134, 157-84, who addresses the conceptual issues at stake in their full complexity, though her primary interest is in Greece of earlier periods rather than comparable phenomena at Rome. Contra Johnston 2008, who argues not only that "animation rituals," inviting the god to enter the statue, are less widespread than had often been supposed (she suggests that they are a Neoplatonic invention of late antiquity), but that it was not common for gods to be thought to exist in their statues (see esp. 448-50). But Johnston's argument on the latter point overlooks a good deal of evidence (such as the texts cited here) where accounts of divine statues are premised on the literal presence of the gods in them. 81 The major exception to this was the Lares and other household deities, whose images were kept within the house, and so - in as much as the image was identified with the god (above, n80) - the god to that extent shared in a human habitation.</page><page sequence="28">68 D. S. beverie 6.3-4, as a preface to his Hesiod-style account of his meeting with Juno, he suggests that others may object that "no divine powers have been seen by a mortal" (6.4: nulla . . . mortali numina visa) - though he then goes on to argue that as a poet, and in particular as a poet of the sacred, he is allowed to look on the gods' faces (6.5-8; cf. 6.23-24). 82 We can compare the point that Catullus makes (64.384-86; cf. 406-8), 83 that while such divine visitations may have taken place in the past, they no longer do so.84 It is true that there are many counterexamples to the broad generalizations that Cicero, Ovid, and Catullus make here: places where the gods were assumed to engage directly with humans in a more or less contemporary world.85 Within historical times, Castor and Pollux were thought to have appeared at Rome following the battle of Pydna in 168 b.c.e. (Cic., Nat. D. 2.6, Val. Max. 1.8.1, Plin. HN 7.86), Mars to have participated in the Roman defence of Thurii against the Lucani in 282 b.c.e. (Val. Max. 1.8.6, Amm. Marc. 24.4.24), Apollo when the emperor Maximinus Thrax besieged Aquileia in 238 c.E.(Hdn. 8.3.8-9); there are also a large number of votive inscriptions and literary accounts which refer to the appearance of the gods to their worshipers. But in the overwhelming majority of these, the form in which the gods appear is distanced from that of regular human contact; they are seen in dreams, or are invisible presences, or appear to their worshipers at times of religious celebration.86 The gods, even when participating in the human world, do so in a way that makes their distance from that world apparent. An interesting instance of this comes with a passage which might at first sight appear to represent an exception to the rule (Plaut. Rud. 1-16): qui gentis omnis mariaque et terras movet, eiius sum civis civitate caelitum. ita sum ut videtis splendens stella candida, signum quod semper tempore exoritur suo hic atque in caelo: nomen Arcturo est mihi. noctu sum in caelo clarus atque inter deos, inter mortalis ambulo interdius. 82 As Littlewood 2006: 8 observes, Ovid's readers have by this point in any case seen him conversing with gods on many previous occasions, and so will hardly take this ob- jection seriously. 83 Cf. Ov. Fast. 1.247-50, Met. 1.148-49. For the general idea, see Feeney 1998: 104-7. 84 Compare Feeney 1991: 344-59 on the way the entire narrative of Statius's Thebaid is founded on a "geography" dividing the universe into the three realms of the underworld, earth, and heaven. 85 On divine epiphanies, see esp.

In the community of the heavenly ones, I am the fellow-citizen of the one who moves all peoples and seas and lands. I am, as you see, a star shining bright, a sign which always arises at its proper time here and in heaven: my name is Arcturus. By night I am bright in heaven and among the gods, by day I walk among mortals. And other signs come to earth from the sky: the Commander of gods and men, Jupiter, dispatches us, different ones among different peoples, so that we get to know the deeds and behavior, the dutifulness and loyalty of men, according to how each man is assisted by wealth. The people who pursue false lawsuits on false testimony, and the ones who in court disavow money, I report their names in writing to Jupiter. Every day he knows who is seeking evil here. In this, the prologue to the play spoken by the star Arcturus, we have on the face of things a counterexample to the generalization I was making above: a divine being who habitually spends half his life not separate from humans, but walking the streets among them. But in fact the underlying premises of the passage assume the contrary. This is of course a joke by Plautus - during the daytime, when stars are manifestly not in the sky, where else are they going to be except down among us on earth? More importantly, the assumption is that while the stars may occupy this dual position, the other gods are constantly in heaven (6: in caelo . . . atque inter deos ), where they form their own society (2: civitate ), and Jupiter's sphere is so separate from ours that his access to information about what people are doing on earth depends on the informa- tion supplied by these intermediaries. Even if we grant (as we should) that the details of the picture are humorous and fanciful, it is entirely congruent with the assumptions about the gods' physical separateness that we see elsewhere. Wherever the gods may be - even if that is in remote parts of the natural world, or indeed in the temples of a city,87 which were after all the homes to no humans - their most common haunts are somewhere apart from humans. 87 Cf. Ando 2003a: 334-36 = Ando 2003b: 230-32, citing Cic. Leg. 2.26 (also Livy 5.52.2 for the idea that the landscape of Rome was intrinsically "full of gods," deorum ... plenus). The point in Cicero is that the Romans, like the Greeks, saw the gods as</page><page sequence="30">70 D. S. Levene Another obvious respect in which the gods differ from humans is in the possession of unusual powers. Here too the differentiation may appear so obvious that some cautions should be offered if we are not to overstate the case. Power is to some extent a relative rather than an absolute thing; and it is clear that the powers assumed to be possessed by the gods varied greatly, as also did the powers possessed by humans. Some - perhaps most - gods were assumed to work within a limited sphere: the god Robigus, for example, appears to have been defined solely in terms of his effects (for good or ill) on crop blight.88 And humans too could be more or less powerful: the power possessed by an emperor far outweighed that of a slave working in the mines. It is not at all clear that if one is ranking powers, the limited powers wielded by minor gods are inevitably greater than the wide-ranging powers of a human emperor. And to that extent a focus on powers might appear to support the notion of "relative" divinity: for someone to be worshiped, all that is required is that that person's power be significantly greater than that of the worship- ers, not that there are some absolute abilities that the person worshiped is required to demonstrate. But this, while true, runs the risk of overstating the case in the opposite direction. For while it is true that individual gods' powers, like the powers of individual humans, varied, it is also the case that the gods, when thought of as a class, were viewed by the Romans as having a distinct set of powers which humans did not possess.89 One episode where this distinction is made is in the address of the Sun to Phaethon in Ovid, Met. 2.56-60: sors tua mortalis, non est mortale quod optas. plus etiam quam quod superis contingere fas est nescius adfectas; placeat sibi quisque licebit, non tarnen ignifero quisquam consistere in axe me valet excepto. Your lot is mortal, and what you desire is not mortal. In your ignorance you are aspiring to even more than what can be rightfully obtained by the gods above; inhabiting the same cities as they did; however, as Cicero also notes, they did so specifically by designating shrines within the city where the gods were deemed to dwell. 88 See Varro, Ling. 6.16; Ov. Fast. 4.901-42 (Robigo); Gell. 5.12.14. 89 As the daughters of Minyas say in Ov. Met. 4.272-73, "true gods can do everything" (omnia veros t posse deos) - though Ovid goes on to note that they make the mistake of failing to include Bacchus in the class of "true gods" (4.273). Compare Scheid 1999: 200-1 = Scheid 2005: 80-83 on the way in which Roman polytheism would parcel out a general notion of "the divine" among different deities reflecting different aspects of divine action.</page><page sequence="31">Defining the Divine in Rome 71 each of them may do as he pleases, but none of them is strong enough to stand on the chariot apart from me. This passage acknowledges the differentiation of divine powers, such that the Sun has unique abilities which no other god, even Jupiter, can match - but it also makes a sharp distinction between the abilities of divine beings en masse and those of mortals.90 The key phrase here is plus etiam : Phaethon is a mortal, yet he is aspiring to something which is beyond even the gods. More generally, the collective powers of gods are clear from prodigy narra- tives such as those in Livy: prodigies are presumed to indicate the displeasure of the gods en masse , not any particular god; the gods accordingly often have to be propitiated en massey and the ill effects if they fail to be propitiated likewise come from the gods collectively. So, to pick one famous example, at Livy 27.23.4 the Romans fail to obtain the pax deum , which is directly said to lead to the deaths of the consuls Marcellus and Crispinus. Similarly Cicero tells the people that there was a divine providence in the exposure of the Catilinarian conspiracy (Cat. 3.18): quamquam haec omnia, Quirites, ita sunt a me administrata ut deorum im- mortalium nutu atque Consilio et gesta et provisa esse videantur. idque cum coniectura consequi possumus, quod vix videtur humani consili tantarum rerum gubernatio esse potuisse, tum vero ita praesentes his temporibus opem et auxilium nobis tulerunt ut eos paene oculis videre possimus. nam ut illa omittam, visas nocturno tempore ab occidente faces ardoremque caeli, ut fulminum iactus .... But all of these things, citizens, have been so managed by me that they seem to have been done and foreseen by the will and plans of the immortal gods. We can learn that partly by inference (it hardly seems possible that human plans could have controlled such vast events) but also indeed they have in person at this time brought aid and help to us, such that we could almost see them with our eyes. I will leave out that torches have been seen in the west at night, and blazing in the sky, the tossing of thunderbolts .... Cicero here makes a clear distinction between what could be attributed to humans, and what can be presumed to come from the actions of the gods, and he links the latter to the prodigies that have been seen. Here too the idea that divine power is simply relative to the worshiper does not seem to be at 90 It is worth noting that emperors, when spoken of as gods, were often assumed to possess not merely ordinary human powers wielded to an exceptional degree, but pow- ers that one would usually characterize as supernatural: see Ando 2000: 386-92; cf. Nock 1928: 32 = Nock 1972: 145; Clauss 1996: 427-30; Clauss 1999: 342-53.</page><page sequence="32">72 D. S. beverie issue. Instead, Cicero suggests, being part of the divine world involves the pos- session of powers which are intrinsically unlike those found among humans. The gods are in particular frequently suggested to have direct access to human minds, being able to know their secret thoughts,91 or indeed to alter them in uncanny ways. So Cicero, Har. resp. 39 (cf. Pis . 46, Mil 84-86) attributes the "insanity" of Clodius to the activity of the gods working on human minds, and compares it to the actions of the gods seen on the tragic stage in driving characters such as Athamas mad: this, he implies, is the typical form that divine punishment takes. 4. CONCLUSIONS The evidence that I presented in Section 3 demonstrates that, contrary to Gradeis claim, it was commonplace at Rome to conceive of divinity as an absolute rather than a relative category. Gods were conceived as having a nature which was fundamentally distinct from humans, and which was associated with a group of properties which were, if not unique to the divine, at any rate typically associated with it with a high degree of regularity. This meets all the criteria for demonstrating that gods and humans were not imagined as being part of the same "kind" with different statuses, but were rather imagined as being entirely different "kinds." But this conclusion itself leads to some puzzling consequences, and ones that deserve further exploration. For while Gradei is (as I have shown) mistaken to suggest that the Romans conceived of divinity as relative, and hence, we may reasonably deduce, is also wrong to suggest that worshiping an emperor as a god was conceptually unproblematic, he nevertheless does suc- cessfully demonstrate that in most contexts the worship of emperors as gods was treated as something unproblematic. When rulers are offered a series of honors by their subjects, divine honors are often not separated out as if they were something startling and different: they are mixed in with other sorts of honors, sometimes even in the same lists.92 There are relatively few occasions where emperors are criticized for accepting divine worship: indeed, in one passage of Tacitus {Ann. 4.38.4-5) Tiberius is, on the contrary, criticized for noř accepting divine worship, a refusal which, it is suggested, shows his degen- erate nature.93 And there are endless examples in practice of people offering 91 So, e.g., Val. Max. 7.2 ext. 8. 92 Cf. Lendon 1997: 161-62. 93 On this passage, and in particular on the difficult question of how far Tacitus endorses these criticisms, see Martin and Woodman 1989: 186-93; Pelling 2010.</page><page sequence="33">Defining the Divine in Rome 73 cult to emperors and other human benefactors, without the slightest hint of any conceptual problems that might arise from doing so. An earlier scholarly generation would presumably have attributed this to mere flattery on the part of the worshipers, but that hardly seems to fit the numerous instances when we have no particular reason to think that they even expected the emperor to be aware of the worship, such as worship in private contexts, especially by people of lower status.94 So while Gradei is wrong to argue that the imperial cult was unproblematic owing to the Romans' conception of divinity being relative rather than absolute, it appears that in many - perhaps most - of the contexts in which the imperial cult actually operated, his argument has a great deal to offer. One broad point that may help us towards an explanation is that, while it is true, as I said, that the Romans regularly categorized "divinity" as something absolute, we have reason to suspect that the boundaries of what entities did and did not possess the quality of divinity to be a very fuzzy one.95 To un- derstand the point I am making here, we can once again provide an analogy from biological kinds. Tigers and leopards are, on any account, clearly distinct "kinds": while they possess many, perhaps most, properties in common (both are large solitary nocturnal tropical-dwelling predatory felines with dark markings on a tawny background), they are unproblematically categorized as distinct whether in scientific or popular conceptions. But the absolute differ- ences between the two groups may not help when one is attempting to assign individuals to them on the basis of imperfect information - if, for example, one is trying to decide which kind the fleetingly-glimpsed large cat which is killing the village's livestock should be deemed to fall into. In the case of tigers and leopards the question can of course be resolved as more information is acquired: their typical properties, while similar, are sufficiently distinct if the animal is killed or captured or simply perceived more clearly. But with gods and other supernatural beings no such ultimate resolution is available. I mentioned above (Section 2) that it is commonplace in many societies that the criteria by which supernatural entities are identi- fied are loose and contestable, precisely because there can be no empirical criteria for determining what does and does not fall into different categories. And I have already noted that the typical qualities associated with the divine 94 See the discussion by Gradei 2002: 198-212, esp. 207-12 on the practice of libations to the emperor. 95 Gradei 2002: 30-31, in challenging Price's model of how the imperial cult operated, denies that fuzziness of this sort existed, but his grounds for this denial largely depend on accepting the "relative" conception of divinity against which I have been arguing.</page><page sequence="34">74 D. S. Levette essence at Rome were not invariably associated with them. Hence, even more than with "kinds" in the natural world, it is always open to someone to insist or deny that a particular being is a god, even if that perception would not always be shared by other members of the society. The sheer breadth of the population of the divine world is presumably relevant here.96 Alongside the familiar gods of myth, one finds also the regular deification of abstract qualities97 like virtus and fides , a practice which leaves open whether these figures are conceived of as beings with an independent personal existence as firm as that imagined for Mars or Venus (who themselves, after all, can in many contexts be seen as the embodiments of the qualities of war or love), or whether they are thought of as qualities which may be divine, but which are not sharply distinguished from qualities which are not deified, or indeed from other aspects of divinity.98 One can add the large number of indigenous gods from Italy and elsewhere with a less defined literary personality, as well as beings such as Fauns or nymphs. It is because of this fuzziness that Latin writers will occasionally speak of certain more marginal divine figures as "half- gods"99: not because they are necessarily conceived of as somehow less divine or more human, but rather because there are no clear definitions which will allow us to determine which figures fall inside and which outside the proper boundaries of "divinity." This gives us a general understanding of how a solid sense of gods and men as distinct could go hand in hand with an insistence that certain men were nevertheless to be classified among the gods. But more is needed: for, as I said, the willingness to see an emperor as unproblematically divine appears to be highly context-dependent, and this too requires explanation.100 96 Cf. Feeney 1998: 84-92. 97 Or so the practice is often called: see however the criticism of this and related scholarly terminology by Fears 1981: 830-33. 98 On divine abstractions at Rome, see, e.g., Axtell 1907; Fears 1981; Fishwick 1987-2005: 2.1.454-74; Feeney 1998: 87-92; and most recently Clark 2007, esp. 21-28 and 35-38 on the fluid boundaries between deified qualities and other qualities which might similarly receive literary or artistic personification but happened not to receive public cult, and also between deified qualities and gods like Jupiter who themselves were thought in certain contexts to embody those qualities. 99 The word semideus can be used literally of heroes who are "half-god" by virtue of having one human and one divine parent (so, e.g., Stat. Theb. 3.518, 5.373, 9.376; Achil. 2.77); but it is also used of unquestionably non-human figures like nymphs and Fauns (e.g., Ov. Her. 4.49, Met 1.192, Ж 82; Stat. Theb. 6.11 2; Val. Flacc. Arg. 6.223), the Egyptian gods, which are physically half-animal (so Luc. 8.832), or of once-human figures like the spirits of the dead (Luc. 9.7). 100 For my argument here, it is worth comparing the important article by Woolf 1997. Woolf argues that the widespread modern scholarly interpretation of ancient religion as</page><page sequence="35">Defining the Divine in Rome 75 One possibility might be to conclude that my argument has pointed only to a partial truth: that while gods and humans were conceptualized as distinct "kinds" in Latin literature , in Roman ritual they were, much as Gradei argues, conceptualized as the same "kind." On this model, in other words, we have within Roman culture two incompatible conceptual schemes, rather than a general "Roman" account of gods and men as distinct "kinds" which is ignored in certain ritual (and perhaps other) contexts. Such incompatible conceptualizations are not at all unlikely in principle (cf. nlOO above). However, in the particular case here, even if we accept that ritual is a discourse which can carry propositional meaning, it is difficult to see how it would be possible from ritual to derive general conceptions of the categories "human" and "divine" (as opposed to the status of the particular ritual participants). Conceptual generalities of this sort are hard to articulate without linguistic discourse; and this paper has demonstrated that the avail- able textual evidence for the generic "kinds" of "human" and "divine" marks them as distinct. It is therefore not unreasonable to conclude that it is within Roman culture as a whole, not just literature, that humans and gods were conceptualized as distinct. The problem then becomes one of understanding why that distinction sometimes appeared salient and sometimes did not.101 If we cannot simply explain away the imperial cult as unproblematic per se at Rome, we need to be far more sensitive to context, and seek to understand why in certain contexts the problems of worshiping a human as a god imposed themselves when they did not in others. "essentially homologous with the social and political structures of ancient societies" (1997: 72) is excessively narrow, and fails to do justice to the sheer complexity of ancient religious thought and practice; he draws attention to myth as one area with an importance which is not captured by the "polis-religion" model. Woolf 's emphasis is however different from mine, since he is more interested in broadening the areas of religious experience under consideration than in accounting for apparent contradictions between those different areas. Cf. also Feeney 1991: 45-46 and Feeney 1998: 14-21 for how ideas of the divine in the ancient world differed dramatically depending on the context in which they were experienced, though he is more interested in the mismatch between literary and cultic manifestations of religion, and at one point dismisses the variations between different literary genres as the product of "literary or social decorum" (1998: 16); see contra Levene 1997, and the argument below. 101 Compare Lendon 1997: 165-72, with a rather more functionalist argument tend- ing to the same general conclusion: that the worship of emperors was bound up with the overall structure of honor in the Roman empire (via, for example, the acquisition of imperial priesthoods by ambitious provincials), which gave people a strong personal interest in not questioning it, however little the deeds or personality of any particular emperor might seem to warrant his being so extravagantly honored.</page><page sequence="36">76 D. S. Levette In an earlier article I argued that panegyric was one context where the question is especially insistent.102 The fact that a work was part of the genre of panegyric intrinsically imposed on both speakers and listeners questions about the absolute truth or falsehood of claims made within it, whereas in other genres, including other genres of oratory, precisely the same claims could be entirely unproblematic, because there issues of truth and falsehood were not equally central.103 It seems plausible that epic and dramatic poetry, though for entirely different reasons and entirely different ways, are places where the question of the exact definition of gods and humans imposed it- self more strongly. Precisely because the boundaries of fictionality in poetry were themselves fuzzy, and poets' stories, while in certain respects related to the truth, were not felt to be constrained by it, license was given to the poeťs invention, and imagined details about the lives and behavior of the gods were liberally supplied. In these stories assumptions could be spelled out, assumptions which in other contexts were left unexpressed and hence did not need to be at the forefront of one's mind when honoring an emperor as divine. This is not to say that representations of divine emperors in poetry are themselves problematic: it is in fact unlikely that they were, since the same license for fiction would allow a poet to attribute straightforwardly to an emperor all sorts of attributes which would be considered the province of the divine. The problem of the imperial cult would arise only in cases where those assumptions of divinity, such as are spelled out in poetry (and also, in quite a different way, in philosophy), were brought to the fore, but in contexts where their truth-claims could not be ignored. It seems plausible to suggest, for example, that the stiff terms in which Tiberius, Claudius, and Nero declined official cult to themselves in letters to the provinces104 says little or nothing about their personalities, and less than one might think about the nature of the cult as a religious practice. It rather indicates that this very specific context, a request to the emperor for a direct decision on his own worship, demanded that an account of his divinity be given in absolute terms. In a more mundane sphere, the exigencies of Roman tax-law forced a decision on the divinity or 102 See Levene 1997. 103 For the general approach, and the way in which in ancient religions (and indeed other belief-systems) inconsistencies and dissonances maybe overlooked in one context while imposing themselves in others, see Versnel 1990, esp. 1-35. 104 Tiberius: SEG 11. 922-23, Tac.
